Via Guru Anerobic:

- 1/ Technological - guns, knives, axes, clubs..i.e. 'arms' 
- 2/ Physical – strength, fighting ability, health 
- 3/ Psychological - confidence, experience, intelligence, adrenal control 
- 4/ Financial – money, assets, land 
- 5/ Legal - national/international law, police, lawyers 

The wider and more developed the classes of weapons you have the more likely you will be able to cope with and survive emergencies of all types; medical emergencies, government crackdowns, street attacks, robberies, business failures, meteor strikes
