      <description>&lt;p&gt;Fukuoka, Natural Farming, and the Developing World&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Buddhism and Agriculture - Part 3&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Dr Trent Brown August 8, 2020&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In his later life, Masanobu Fukuoka became very concerned with using natural farming to solve real-world problems. This was reflected in the progression of ideas in his writings. In his first book, The One-Straw Revolution, Fukuoka (1978/2009) outlined the philosophy and practice of natural farming. In his final book, Sowing Seeds in the Desert (Fukuoka, 1996/2012), he provided a more concrete manifesto of how natural farming can provide solutions to some of the world’s most pressing challenges. This includes a strong focus on some of the major issues affecting farming communities in developing countries.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Fukuoka became highly prominent within the global sustainable farming movement, with his texts ‘One Straw Revolution’ and ‘The Road Back to Nature’ selling millions of copies in various languages.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The morning sun shone through the leaves of the pine trees in the garden and illuminated gold the web of an orb spider cast above the door. We were meeting with Hiroki Fukuoka, the grandson of Masanobu Fukuoka, the founder of natural farming.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
