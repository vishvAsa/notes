The flip side on "inappropriate technology" is the famous parable of "Chesterton's Fence": if you come across a gate in a field and see no reason why its should be there, do not remove it until you have figured out why it was put there in the first place. Millennia of hard earned handed down tradition and agricultural and ecological knowledge is being lost year after year, every time an old farmer dies without heirs. In many cases we have passed the point of no return: we will have to argue in the dark.

A more recent example from Akita prefecture in Japan, where dwarf apple trees were introduced to orchards. The owls could not perch or nest in these trees so before anyone understood it rodent populations exploded.
