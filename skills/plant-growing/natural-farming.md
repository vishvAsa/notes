- Masanobu Fukuoka's natural farming, "Do-Nothing Farming" . aka sahaja-kRShi.


## Techniques

### Negative
no = minimal as per some like Kawaguchi, Bhaskar Save.

- no tilling
  - ploughing is unnecessary, as the soil is aerated by the roots of plants and the movement of soil organisms.
- no weeding
  - sowing at opportune times, so that one’s crops grow and establish themselves before weeds have the chance to proliferate
- no fertilizers
- no pesticides
- no pruning

### Positive
- Clay seed balls.
- Mulching to prevent water evaporation.
  - “Live mulching” is promoted with cover crops of a mix of monocotyledons (like millets) and leguminous dichotyledons (like beans)
  - straw mulching

#### Natural fertlization
- vIresh near aikAntika uses sheep shit.
- bIjAmRta as per Palekar's Zero Budget (ZBNF) farming.
  - cow dung water + urine + soil + lime. Similarly, "jIvAmRta".
  - 1 cow per 30 acres per Palekar's ZBNF.


## Advantages
