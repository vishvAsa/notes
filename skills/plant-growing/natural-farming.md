- Masanobu Fukuoka's natural farming, "Do-Nothing Farming" . aka sahaja-kRShi.

## Objectives
### Dr Venkat's opinion
- Increase "pore space" between soil particles; whence roots suck nutrients and water. Hence, organic matter is introduced. 
- Soil organisms convert organic base into ingestible nutrients. Soil organisms weigh over 20x weight of life over the soil.
- Must provide them air and water. Not chemicals.


## Techniques

### Negative
no = minimal as per some like Kawaguchi, Bhaskar Save.

- no tilling
  - ploughing is unnecessary, as the soil is aerated by the roots of plants and the movement of soil organisms.
- no weeding
  - sowing at opportune times, so that one’s crops grow and establish themselves before weeds have the chance to proliferate
- no fertilizers
- no pesticides
- no pruning

### Positive
- Clay seed balls.
- Mulching to prevent water evaporation.
  - “Live mulching” is promoted with cover crops of a mix of monocotyledons (like millets) and leguminous dichotyledons (like beans)
  - straw mulching

#### Natural fertlization
- vIresh near aikAntika uses sheep shit.
- bIjAmRta as per Palekar's Zero Budget (ZBNF) farming.
  - cow dung water + urine + soil + lime. Similarly, "jIvAmRta".
  - 1 cow per 30 acres per Palekar's ZBNF.


## Advantages
- Much less labor.


## Examples (India)

- Raghava of Aikanthika farm (20 acres) near dAvaNagere. Lives off coconut income and farm produce.
- Neighbor shankara-gauDa + wife sunItA and son from next tAluku to aikAntika (eg. [YT1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FemPDobdpwg&t=297s), [YT2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1_f2R1AjG8g) ) work 2hrs a day.
- madhu - grows paddy without pesticides.
- vIresha near rAghava's farm
- Subhash Palekar and followers.
- Dr Venkat (1923-2011) India's Permaculture pioneer. He utilized the Permaculture teachings of Bill Mollison and traditional Indian practices to create Permaculture concepts tailored to the Indian subcontinent.
