## Communal holding
Oft people pool resources, buy a big chunk of land, divide it out, develop and maintain it collectively.  
Eg. See [India page](/notes/skills/plant-growing/places/india).

### Farm plots
Companies sell "farm-plots" near bengaLUru, which are smaller than full farms (eg. .25 acre), but larger than a residential plot.
