(Palaveri village till 1991.)

Rice and pulses were alternatively harvested.  
Rice was grown in rainy season.  

Rice was sown and  
leaves from boundary trees were felled for fertilization.  
No chemical fertilizers or borewells were used.

Rain water was gathered in ponds, and used for later pulse growing. 

Vegetables were grown in home-yards, fertilized by kitchen waste.
