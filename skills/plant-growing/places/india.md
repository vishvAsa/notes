### Land holding restrictions
- Laws
  - 1963 land ceiling act, followed by 2020 amendment. 
  - Prohibition of Transfer of Certain Lands or the Karnataka SC/ST Act of 1978
- 10 units (45 acres) in KA (true after the reform?). Can build on 10% of the area.
- Oft, agricultural land can't be used for other purposes.

### Buying
- Oft, there's litigation from claimants (eg. sc/st-s, relatives). 
- Lawyers check the documents going back to old times. Dishonest ones ignore dispute possiblities - hoping for a share in future settlement.
