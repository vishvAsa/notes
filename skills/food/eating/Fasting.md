## Procedure
### Intermittent fasting
Eat only within an 8hr window. Fast the remaining 16 hours.

### Periodic fasting
- No food for 24 hours periodically

#### Breaking fast
- "Further, it doesn’t make ecological sense to break a fast with only a small amount (given food availability), no animal would “leave the table with room to spare” after starvation." 

### Activity
- "It goes w/out saying that when u fast u should be active - HIIT, RT, etc. This is HUNTER MODE, 'Destruction & Reconstruction', Autophagy - the primal processes for health which modern life suppresses."

## Motivation
- "As a biological organism the human body is adaptive; more than that, it is antifragile, this is an important distinction in that things that are antifragile need stress to improve. ... nature delivers nutrition in an unbalanced ... supply of food matters just as much as its constituents."
- "Too much information in the form of constant feeding dulls the senses and causes harm. ... As anyone who has fasted for 36hrs or more knows, eyesight improves and sense of smell becomes more intense."
- "that aging and disease back off in the face of hunger"

## Stages
- Post prandial state: After eating, when the stomach and intestines are absorbing nutrients from food. 4-6hrs.
  - glycolysis, the body normally derives energy from glucose in the blood stream which comes from carbohydrate in food.
  - Glucose which isn't used straightaway is converted into glycogen and stored in the liver and muscles.
- post-absorptive' state: body has to create energy from the breakdown of its own reserves. 
  - hepatic glycogen is converted back into glucose for energy. 
  - Once the glycogen stores are near depletion, 12-24hrs later depending on activity levels, the body creates glucose/energy from non-carbohydrate sources such as fat and amino acids (gluconeogenesis). 
  - After 2-3 days of fasting the body switches' to the muscle sparing process of lipolysis/ketosis.
