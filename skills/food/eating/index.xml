      <description>Procedure Length Intermittent fasting Eat only within an 8hr window. Fast the remaining 16 hours.
Periodic fasting  Fasting 2 to 5 days straight. Mark Baker recommends 2+ weeks inbetween.  Activity  &amp;ldquo;It goes w/out saying that when u fast u should be active - HIIT, RT, etc. This is HUNTER MODE, &amp;lsquo;Destruction &amp;amp; Reconstruction&amp;rsquo;, Autophagy - the primal processes for health which modern life suppresses.&amp;rdquo;  Sustenance during long fasts  &amp;ldquo;Fasts of up to 24hrs can be done free of food - some people may prefer not to eat any food as &amp;ldquo;it is easier to fast than to diet&amp;rdquo;, but longer fasts should include some calories.</description>

Never aim to say ’I am full’ after eating; instead aim to say: ’I won’t be hungry for 4 hours.’. Do not eat to relieve boredom or to take a break. Let it not be the dominant source of Ananda - use buddhi instead to gain Ananda from dhArmika-kAryas!
Example: Okinawans stop eating before they are 80% full: they say this to themselves before eating.</description>
