      <description>Best choice: organic cold pressed oils. For deep frying - go for sesame oil (traditional hindu choice) or coconut oil.
Production Cold pressed Cold pressed oils are obtained by physical pressing of the seeds, fruits &amp;amp; nuts and forcing the oil out. This is the same as the traditional process to extract oils.
Refined oils Refined oils are the oils that are extracted through the use of solvents and through bleaching and deodorizing processes.</description>
