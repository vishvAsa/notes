      <description>Freezing Store all foods at 0 F or lower to retain vitamin content, color, flavor and texture. Freezing preserves cooked food for long durations.
Defrosting Never defrost foods in a garage, basement, car, dishwasher or plastic garbage bag; out on the kitchen counter, outdoors or on the porch. There are three safe ways to defrost food: in the refrigerator, in cold water, or in the microwave. [Ref] Refreezing:
It is safe to refreeze, provided you did not introduce or allow the multiplication of bacteria during thawing.</description>
