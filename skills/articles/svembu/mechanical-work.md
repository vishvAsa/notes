We need enough self-discipline so we can get things done but not so much that the work becomes so routine and mechanical it doesn't give us any joy. We need just enough structure to keep things sane but not so much that it becomes stifling. How do we achieve that balance? That balance between structure and unstructure is not static, it is a dynamic evolving thing. A product in its very early stages will need very loose structure so we maximize our freedom to explore. As we approach a public release, we need to become much more structured.

People who understand this dynamic balance produce great creative work. When we work as a team, we need people with the creative flair and people who bring discipline. In projects I personally manage, I always have a person to impose discipline on me when I need it!
