I want to put the social media abuse in perspective.  I live and work in villages and I visit many villages in Tamil Nadu, particularly very poor areas as part of our school initiative.  I see only love and affection and absolutely no hostility of any kind. I have received enormous outpouring of love via email and via direct messages.  

I have never once received the kind of hate you encounter on media like Twitter. The people who are doing this on Twitter are not causing me damage, but create a distorted image of Tamil Nadu. 

I have strong philosophical and political convictions but I would not make it personal abuse.  These attacks only strengthen my resolve and don't weaken it. 

My only concern is that good people may see these attacks and become afraid.  Do not be afraid! Social media is quite far from reality on the ground and may be bringing out the worst in people. Adopt a motto of service with a smile and people respond extremely positively.+++(5)+++  Do not be afraid to do good things! üôè
