Last week I met a smart Odiya entrepreneur (and Zoho customer) hailing from a small village, and he spoke halting English but his Hindi is quite decent. He was forced to use English to speak to me. My speaking halting Hindi mixed with English words would have been easier for us to do business. That is what I am aiming to get to.

In Tamil Nadu we learned English to do business globally, because you speak the language of your customer, you don't get to dictate what the customer speaks. 

Now that globalization is going in reverse, we have to rely on India's own vast domestic market ($4+ trillion GDP and growing!).  The link language of the Indian customer is Hindi and this is not just in Hindi-speaking states. You can get by with Hindi in Hyderabad or Bhvaneshwar or in Kolkata. Unlike English, no one in India judges you for speaking broken Hindi - they appreciate your effort.

This is how a practical business person thinks.

You can attack me all you want but if you are a business person, you would be smart to take this advice! 

I am generally immune to being mercilessly attacked so thank you for wasting your time rather than fighting out how to get ahead in life 😁 🙏
