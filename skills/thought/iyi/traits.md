- Smugness and unwarrented arrogance which lead to underestimation of the opponent. \[[VO16](http://www.vox.com/2016/4/21/11451378/smug-american-liberalism)\]

## Counter-traditionism
Note that the below is to be contrasted with "reform within tradition" types.

- Lack of deep intelligence and respect (to the point of deep disaffection) for time-tested classical/ naturally selected thought despite education [NNT16](https://medium.com/@nntaleb/the-intellectual-yet-idiot-13211e2d0577#.lepgset6y).
- Lack of regard for tranditional community structure

## Revolution
- Revolutionary tendencies
- Inability to deliver promised goods.
  - "In the manifest failure of their abilities, they take credit for their intentions." â€“E. Burke
- Eventual disenchantment of those they want to "reform".


## Bad data
- Lack of "care for data" juxtaposing abstraction in high IQ people [MT15](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2015/12/23/lutika-somakhyo%E1%B8%A5-pravada%E1%B8%A5/).
- This jinxes those who otherwise have high IQs.

## Poor n-th order thinking
- "Typically, the IYI get the first order logic right, but not second-order (or higher) effects making him totally incompetent in complex domains. " \[[NNT16](https://medium.com/@nntaleb/the-intellectual-yet-idiot-13211e2d0577#.lepgset6y)\]

## Contrast with grounded wisdom

- Need to understand the opponent, applying the principle of charity, rather than responding with disgust. \[[VO16](http://www.vox.com/2016/4/21/11451378/smug-american-liberalism), \]
