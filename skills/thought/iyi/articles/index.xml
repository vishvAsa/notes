      <description>&lt;p&gt;In chapter 2 of @jsaideepak &amp;rsquo;s book, he draws our attention to the concepts of Modernity and Rationality that were used by the European colonizers as whetstones for validity of concepts and practices. Interesting to see this normative inversion with respect to Lindy&amp;rsquo;s Principle.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You might have come across statements like &amp;ldquo;This is the 21st century. Why are you still sporting a religious mark on your forehead?&amp;rdquo; The hidden assumption here is that sporting religious marks is a pre-modern practice. So, why are you, being a sane person, still following it? In this paradigm, a pre-modern practice or an idea is viewed with suspicion+++(5)+++. Furthermore, suppose you insist on the practice being valid, you may have come across, &amp;ldquo;Can you prove what are its benefits?&amp;rdquo;. Again, the assumption is that you are required to prove the validity with respect to a model of the world that is acceptable to the modern society.+++(4)+++ This is the famous rationality that Lemurs go ga-ga over. &amp;ldquo;Oh you cannot prove it ? Then it is irrational. How can you continue a practice which is irrational ? &amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Source - &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/OGSaffron/status/796270938195165185&#34;&gt;OGS16&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Q: What is it that intellectuals find so attractive about Maoist, Naxalite, and separatist ideologies? A: They are intellectual in origin.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;.. Redner shows that intellectuals have literally intellectualized the world, resulting in people being disenchanted with it.+++(4)+++ From cultural dimensions like art, religion, ethics, politics, all the way to philosophy and so on, intellectualization has degraded it all. Which is precisely why intellectuals tend to be hated and despised by their own people because the people often find them disgraceful.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
