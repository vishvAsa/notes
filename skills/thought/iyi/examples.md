> been talking to someone with an IQ clearly above 150 a bit recently. makes it clear that raw intelligence falls short if you don't know enough basic factual information. ie just reading some history books allows you to stand on shoulders and takedown ppl way faster CPU-wise. i should be clear i think this person's IQ is 150 as a *floor* i bet higher for sure. the raw CPU and RAM is colossal. - rAzib [TW](https://twitter.com/razibkhan/status/1452111614749159425)
