While I'm deeply skeptical about the institution of the Nobel Prize, sometimes one is pushed to make a comment or two.  The kind of lay justifications or causes they append to their pronouncement are sometimes amusing/irritating. Like, this year, they could have simply said that they are giving the prize for the discovery of regulatory T cells (Tregs). Of course, a layman would not understand what that means, but would be equally or even more confused by their citation.
