Given that the American Ivies are in the news these days, many think that they have recently declined. It is true that there was a big downward plummet following the kR^iShNamukha riots organized by piNDaka’s backers to overthrow the nAri~NgapuruSha. 

However, those who are discerning and have interacted with Ivies for long know that even in the late 1990s-early 2000s. All of them had great science and math faculties; however, these were not in a position to fight the storm being brewed up in the fake knowledge disciplines. The said sci/math faculty could be categorized into 3 large groups in this regard: 

1. Apolitical. Despite their high IQ, they had the vaguest grasp of history and politics. Hence, they simply could not discern the origin and intent of movements in the fake disciplines. 
2. Due to a certain ethno-religious background or New Atheism being dominant in these faculties,they actually bought into the navyonmAda coming from the fake discipline faculty. Even scientists with some or a lot of good scientific ideas fell prey to this (e.g., Gould, Lewontin, Trivers). These acted as bridgeheads to bring navyonmAda into the science faculties. 
3. The guilt-ridden folks: a lot of the faculty of ultimately European ancestry felt a sense of guilt for slavery, Nazism, fascism etc. that their people had engaged in. Hence, they felt they had to perform dAna-s and utsarga-s to redeem themselves from these pApa-s.They were convinced that nayvonmAda provided the mArga for such abhyudaya. 
   
Hence, they passively or actively let the navyonmAda principles overtake them. Belonging to the elite, they were little affected by these, even as the lower class Europoids, prAchya-s and bhArata-s took the brunt of its downside. In a sense, they were happy with this as their potent academic competitors were being shafted. It was becoming clear by ~2002-3 that prAchya-s and bhArata-s, if given a level playing field, could challenge the high seats occupied by them in a short while. By favoring navyonmAda they could not only get prAyashchitta but also drive a nail into those rising competitors for elite status. Now like varuNa’s mace it has turned against shrutAyudha.
