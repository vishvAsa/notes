Subjective and objective insight
The black American scientist Sylvester Gates mentioned a curious personal anecdote in a talk. To paraphrase him, when he was in college, he had to take a calculus course. He mentioned how he could cut through differentiation as it was a largely mechanical process. Then came integration, where he said he was stuck with the problems involving multiple substitutions to arrive at the final integral. The inability to crack difficult problems of that genre gave him a headache, and he fell asleep. Something happened to him in his sleep that when he awoke, he suddenly emerged with a new understanding to solve those problems, and they no longer seemed difficult.&#43;&#43;&#43;(5)&#43;&#43;&#43; We can completely identify with that experience of his. However, it was not a night’s sleep that flipped the switch in our case. We had to wait for that testosterone burst, that elixir of masculinity, which allows males to perform great acts.&#43;&#43;&#43;(4)&#43;&#43;&#43; We clearly remember how, a few months before it, we struggled to derive the equations of certain loci for which we had figured out mechanical constructions. But, upon the passage to manhood, suddenly we found ourselves possessed of svāyambhuva insights that allowed us to penetrate such problems with ease — it was as if the doors to a deeper realm of understanding had been opened. Other people have told us of similar experiences — we recently heard from a friend how he had a phase transition at some point in his life (overlapping with puberty), which made him suddenly grasp a mathematical entity that had previously defied him and led him to pursuing a degree in physics.">

<p>Subjective and objective insight</p>
<p>The black American scientist Sylvester Gates mentioned a curious
personal anecdote in a talk. To paraphrase him, when he was in college,
he had to take a calculus course. He mentioned how he could cut through
differentiation as it was a largely mechanical process. Then came
integration, where he said he was stuck with the problems involving
multiple substitutions to arrive at the final integral. The inability to
crack difficult problems of that genre gave him a headache, and he fell
asleep. Something happened to him in his sleep that when he awoke, he
suddenly emerged with a new understanding to solve those problems, and
they no longer seemed difficult.+++(5)+++ We can completely identify with that
experience of his. However, it was not a night’s sleep that flipped the
switch in our case. We had to wait for that testosterone burst, that
elixir of masculinity, which allows males to perform great acts.+++(4)+++ We
clearly remember how, a few months before it, we struggled to derive the
equations of certain loci for which we had figured out mechanical
constructions. But, upon the passage to manhood, suddenly we found
ourselves possessed of svāyambhuva insights that allowed us to penetrate
such problems with ease — it was as if the doors to a deeper realm of
understanding had been opened. Other people have told us of similar
experiences — we recently heard from a friend how he had a phase
transition at some point in his life (overlapping with puberty), which
made him suddenly grasp a mathematical entity that had previously defied
him and led him to pursuing a degree in physics.</p>
<p>Our life-history-associated flips may be relatively easily explained in
neurological terms — the gonadal hormones are known to trigger extensive
neurogenesis, and these new neurons and the reorganization of neuronal
connections, which they case seem to provide the firepower for
apprehending mathematical and conceptual ideas that were previously
difficult to process.</p>
<p>However, the experience narrated by Gates is of a
different kind. He definitely did not grow a bunch of neurons over his
nap, but it seems his “subconscious” kept working and churned up the
solution back to his conscious mind on awakening. Such experiences are
not isolated. In fact, they might have played a big role in the history
of science in the form of dream revelations.</p>
<p>We first learnt of this
from the famous story of how August von Kekulé solved the structure of
benzene in a dream. Subsequently, we learnt of several other examples:</p>
<ol>
<li>Ramanujan obtained formulae concerning several elliptic integrals from the goddess Śri in a dream.</li>
<li>Niels Bohr had a dream of electrons revolving like planets around the nucleus in fixed orbits.</li>
<li>Dmitri Mendeleev had a dream of the periodic table of elements.</li>
<li>AR Wallace had a dream while suffering from a tropical fever in the Far East that left him with the evolutionary theory.</li>
</ol>
<p>We have never made any of our
major scientific discoveries in a dream. However, we have had a couple
of mathematical problems, and the path to their solution appear in
dreams — these were very rare events — we had exactly two so far in
life!</p>
<p>While the pubertal and the dream switches might seem like different
things, we hold that they have a commonality. Both are marked with the
acquisition of a new insight after which the world might not appear to
be the same. Before the switch, there was no way of solving the problem
with a purely workmanly approach. That switch happens at a
“subconscious” level, but it impinges into conscious action with a
fundamentally changed framework that allows you to see a new order or a
system where none seemed to exist before — <em>everything makes sense in
this framework but not outside it</em>.</p>
<p>This has implications for the process of science. It has become popular
to tell students that science is generated via the “scientific method”,
whose realization is seen as a major development for science itself.
Ideas related to the formalism of the scientific method are widespread.
<a href="https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2013/08/03/big-science-and-grant-driven-science-and-how-discoveries-are-made/">As we have discussed
before</a>,
we encounter them in the nyāya (+vaiśeṣika) theory of knowledge
production wherein from a kalpanā (tentative hypothesis) we proceed to a
nirṇītā if it passes the test (vinigamaka) as opposed to the alternative
hypothesis. The established hypothesis becomes the theory or siddhānta.</p>
<p>A similar formulation emerged the Occident starting with the pioneering
work of the French savant Rene Descartes (apparently, he got this
framework in a dream) and culminating in the Jewish thinker Karl Popper
who presented a clear
<a href="https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2013/08/03/big-science-and-grant-driven-science-and-how-discoveries-are-made/">“flow-chart”</a>
encompassing hypothesis generation, prediction, testing and
falsification. That such a formalism sprung up convergently across
cultures implies that there might be something deep to them. In general,
we agree it is a good way to understand how science works. However, we
should stress that this is not how it actually happens.</p>
<p>The actual process of scientific discovery depends heavily on the
welling up of those perspective-changing insights from the subconscious
to the conscious that we mentioned above (for why we term it
perspective-changing, see below).+++(4)+++ However, it should not be held that
the profound perspective-shift that bubbles up to you is necessarily
<em>scientifically</em>correct even if it were mathematically beautiful,
technically sound, or seemingly robust as a device. It has to be tested
against actual data. Here is where the Popperian idea of making a
prediction based on it and testing it comes in.</p>
<p>We have several famous
examples of how the perspective-changing explanation might be beautiful
but scientifically wrong. We could mention the great German astrologer
<a href="https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2005/08/14/johannes-kepler/">Johannes Kepler</a> ‘s
original planetary model, where he fitted each of the five Platonic
solids between the orbits of the six then known planets. He felt he had
stumbled upon a profound insight: “The intense pleasure I have received
from this discovery can never be told in words…” However, the
predictions of this model did not fit the mass of astronomical
observations, the great legacy of Tycho Brahe. Where Kepler emerged as a
scientist was in his ultimate rejection of this hypothesis despite its
beauty (he drew a diagram of it rivaling the hand of Leonard da Vinci
himself) and personal appeal. Thus, the role of the Popperian process
was relatively limited in this example of how science actually happened.
The Popperian hypothesis rejection did not result in an automatic path
ahead for Kepler. Indeed, he might have been consigned the heap of many
a forgotten scientist had he stopped there. Kepler’s effort in
constructing his original model and testing it provided him with many
insights into the problem at hand. He also had key observations that did
not fit his initial hypothesis in his head. These provided the grist for
his renewed attack on the problem.</p>
<p>Here again the subconscious churning
through the paths taken by the great yavanācārya-s, Archimedes and
Apollonius, going back to the <a href="https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2012/10/23/a-personal-discursion-on-conic-sections/">Delian oracle of
Apollo</a>
resulted in Kepler arriving at the correct hypothesis that was striking
in its generality, even if more abstruse than the earlier one for the
pre-Newtonian layman.</p>
<p>From a neurological perspective, this subconscious production of science
is not surprising. It is well known that most of our neural processes,
which might be termed thinking, are unconscious. Even in a conscious
experience, like vision, there is an enormous amount of neural
calculation and information processing that we are entirely unaware of.
In fact, it might even be dangerous for a regular individual to be
exposed to this data, its processing, and its presentation. This is
strikingly illustrated by the case of the black English artist savant,
Stephen Wiltshire, whose very existence might be denied by people who
have not seen him in action. However, his extraordinary capture of
visual detail comes at the cost of strong autistic traits that are
potentially fitness-nullifying. Indeed, on very rare occasions, such
capacities might get unmasked by brain injury, as in the case of Jason
Padgett, suggesting that natural selection is likely working to keep
them masked rather than expressed. Hence, the subconscious, which is
screened from the conscious, is the most likely seat where the
perspective-shifting insight arises.</p>
<p>We hold that there is a pure
Platonic realm of mathematics and “linguistic content” that contains the
foundation of “all knowledge” of existence. The conscious surfing of
this realm is likely not possible for most people. Many of those who are
able to access it often have a cost, such as being on the autistic
spectrum.+++(5)+++  Thus, this realm is in part surfed only subconsciously by
most.</p>
<p>Anyone who has solved a difficult (to the person in doing the job)
scientific or mathematical problem knows the sensation Kepler talks
about — that first-person experience. The perspective-changing insight
usually comes first, but it is in a sense “raw”, i.e., the details are
not precise at all, but there is something in the subconscious that
tells you that you have the right solution. It feels as if the “surfing”
process apprehends it in the Platonic realm, but its clarity is smudged
when it is dredged up to the conscious realm. After that, there is a
workmanly phase wherein one implements the solution in concrete terms.
In this phase, one’s intelligence and breadth of knowledge are vital
determinants of how well one converts the insight into the finished
product of a scientific discovery or a mathematical theorem. What
emerges usually has a formalism that allows it to be communicated
mechanically to the recipient. However, this communication, as well as
its reception by peers, might not be easy. A common adage goes that once
you announce a new insight, your peers first ridicule it — this is
usually because they are not in possession of the new framework you
have, and even to apply it mechanically, they need at least a limited
perspective-shift. Eventually, the peers learn to apply it mechanically
and see that it gives correct results. This causes them to shift towards
the new framework even if they do not fully grasp it. Finally, the flip
occurs in the minds of the peers and a subset of them might declare the
discovery as trivial or claim that they knew it all along — this in part
stems from a total conversion that makes them lose their prior framework
(some of this is capture in the <a href="https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2013/08/03/big-science-and-grant-driven-science-and-how-discoveries-are-made/">paradigm shift
model</a>
of the Jewish thinker Thomas Kuhn).</p>
<p>In the end, all this still lies in the domain of what might be termed
the objective because once the insight is gained, it can be formally
transferred to others by a mechanical procedure. For example, most
Indian “crackers” in our days who exuberantly integrated all manner of
complicated functions often did not have any insight into calculus —
they had merely mastered its protocol. On the other end, there might be
mathematicians turgid with formalism who think all common presentations
of calculus are fundamental flawed. In between are the reasonable
practitioners who know that there is a certain insight, which becomes
very natural at a certain point in one’s study of the field. Once one
knows this, it no longer seems like a black box but as natural a
procedure as 2+2=4 (unless you are possessed by the <a href="https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2021/10/31/the-rise-of-navyonmada-the-subversion-of-the-mahamleccha-s-cinanusara-and-beyond/">Neo-American
disease</a>).
Thus, for many who have “mastered” calculus, the original perspective
shifts that its discoverers might have had are no longer very important.+++(5)+++
Because of this one might also see a devolution of the field if the
continuity with the original insight is lost. We believe that a good
example of this is the loss of the great astronomical insights of
Āryabhaṭa in Hindu astronomy until it was in a sense rediscovered by the
Nambūtiri school or their (as yet unknown) predecessors. This might also
be a major factor in the loss of technological insights, such as the
Antikythera mechanism of the Archimedean tradition or the yantra-s of
Āryabhaṭa or king
<a href="https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2011/04/21/the-mechanical-the-magical-and-the-fantastic-2/">Bhoja</a>.
This might even happen in our age.</p>
<p>In any case, the bottom line is that these perspective shifts, once
realized, can be transferred to others. Hence, we see this as being in
the domain of “science” or objective knowing. However, over the years,
we have come to realize that there is an equivalent of this switch that
intrudes into the subjective domain that might not be entirely
transferable, at least by the same way we transfer the objective
insights. There are several versions of this straddling domain between
the purely subjective and the objective.</p>
<p>To explore this, we start with
the existence of hard biological barriers that stand in the way of the
first-person experience of one group from being replicated in the other.
An easily understood case of this comes from the innate differences
between men and women (notwithstanding the neo-American simulacrum of
West Asian diseases of the mind, which tells you that they do not
exist). One domain where this is very apparent is vision — men and women
literally see things differently. Women tend to see a greater richness
of color than men, especially in the middle wavelengths of the visual
range, and men see finer detail (especially changing light intensity)
and subtler movements than women.+++(4)+++ While we do not entirely understand
the biology behind this, it may proximally stem partly from the
X-chromosomal linkage of opsin genes, which encode visual sensors, and
partly from the massive role of testosterone in modeling the visual
cortex during development. There may be good teleologies for this going
back to our evolutionary past, especially given that primates are very
visual animals, which recognize color on faces (among other things for
mate choice), and the behavioral differences between males and females
in several primate lineages. Thus, males and females have distinct
subjective experiences of color and detail conditioned by their
biological differences — this is analogous to the pubertal neural
transformations that lead to new insights. However, in this case, the
first-person experience of one group cannot be replicated by the other
due to the fundamental biological distinction between them.</p>
<p>This leads us to the question as to whether, in some cases, this barrier
to the subjective experience can be turned off by a switch such that you
see things in a wholly new way — something analogous to man being able
to suddenly see all the gradation of colors a woman was talking about
that he never understood. For this, let us consider the effects of
<a href="https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2007/04/18/keshi-visham/">N,N-Dimethyltryptamine
(DMT)</a>.
Those who have not had a DMT experience (that includes us, to be clear),
can get some picture of the self-reported objective part. For example, a
survey of 561 DMT users [Footnote 1] showed significant coherence in
the prominent features experienced by them. They reported an encounter
with a “being, guide, spirit, alien or helper” that appeared “conscious,
intelligent, and benevolent” and “continued to exist after the
encounter”. The majority also stated that they received “a message or a
prediction of the future”. We cannot make complete sense of what they
experienced, but we can agree that the compound made them see something
unusual. However, the users also show a significant trend of saying that
the experience results in a profound change of world view, and they did
not see things the same way after it. For example, more than half of
those who identified as “atheists” no longer did so after the
experience.+++(5)+++ Thus, no amount of explaining or description of the
experience in an objective sense can flip the perspective switch for
those who have not gone through it. Therefore, this tells us that there
is a perspective switch in the subjective realm, similar to what we see
in the objective sphere in the scientific process; however, that cannot
be simply transmitted through a formal framework to others. Instead, one
may have to subject oneself to the compound to see if such a shift might
be experienced in the first person.</p>
<p>Indeed, the commonality and
distinction between these subjective and objective perspective changes
is illustrated by the lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) experiences that
are said to produce both objective scientific perspective shifts, which
can be formally communicated, and subjective ones which result in a
“changed perspective on existence,” which seem untransmittable.</p>
<p>The limiting case of the subjective perspective-shift is something that
educated Hindus can understand; however, others might find it incredibly
difficult to grasp. At a general level, it might be something that
overlaps with the flipping of the switch, which occurs with psychedelic
compounds, but, typically, the Hindu praxis related to it does not go
via such compounds. This may be termed, for the lack of a better word,
“brahmānanda.” While the use of the term brahmānanda might indicate that
we are privileging Advaita vedānta, we should clarify that it is not the
case. The percipient, either due to a yogasādhanā or vicāra has a switch
flip within him, which shines the light of a profound subjective
experience, that might be liked to awakening from a dream. In the
regular dream world, one is conscious and doing things with a unified
first-person experience despite the absence of much sensory input. In
that state, one takes that experience to be reality. But when one
awakens, one realizes that it was not reality but some “illusion”.
Similarly, in the brahmānanda experience, the percipient is said to
awaken from the everyday world into that new brahmānanda state, at which
point he sees the everyday world just like a dream. Some such condition
and transformation into it is widely accepted in H tradition (including
the vedabāhya schools). What they differ in is the ontological status
they accord it and the theological framework into which they incorporate
it.+++(5)+++ We will not labor on this point because educated H will get right
away, and others probably will make no sense of what we are talking
about.</p>
<p>There are more “secular” examples in the same general domain that again
a subset of people can find difficult or impossible to apprehend. Below
we give a couple of such anecdotes. To understand the “reality” of
subjective experience, one has to be able to appreciate what is called,
in modern Occidental philosophical terminology, the “hard-problem” of
consciousness. It goes hand-in-hand with the “first-person-experience”
available for mental reflection; it is given the technical term quale
(plural: qualia). Simply put, the hard problem is then the question of
how we can get to the qualia from an understanding of all the
biochemistry and biophysics (the “easy problem”).</p>
<p>This is a
philosophically difficult chasm to bridge between the objective realm of
science and the subjective realm of consciousness. A physicist with a
prodigious head once asked us if we felt that the “human brain” and
“consciousness” were the last great frontier of biology, which would
draw the biggest brains in the field. We responded that it might suck in
the big brains but that there were more fundamental problems in biology.
This led us to talk about consciousness, and soon we realized that he
thought consciousness was the same as the biochemistry and biophysics of
the brain. Hard as we tried, he could neither apprehend the very
existence of qualia nor the concept of the philosophical zombie — it
almost seemed like he was one. We put this aside as simply an issue with
our attempt at explaining the concept to him. More recently, we had a
similar conversation with a set of friends. Of the two of them, one, who
was formerly a physicist, again simply failed to apprehend the concept
of qualia or that the hard problem could even exist. The other one, a
biologist with a reasonable general knowledge of neurobiology, had
considerable difficulty grasping the existence of qualia. He fumbled
along, insisting, like many before him, that they must be just
“illusions” not unlike optical illusions. However, midway into the
conversation, a switch suddenly flipped within him. He exclaimed
something like: “I get what you are saying! This is profound, a hard
problem indeed! Now I see why this might be a big issue.” In this case,
we could not transfer an algorithm to him for making the switch —
something within him flipped while he was trying to process our words
and imagery objectively.</p>
<p>We finally come to the specific case where there seems to be an
interaction between the subjective and objective domains of knowing. We
illustrate it with an example that would make the typical modern
occidentally conditioned scientists (usually one with left-liberal
beliefs) very uncomfortable (though the protagonists in the narrative
are Occidental scientists). The narrator somehow felt we would “get it”
even if we do not <em>believe</em>him. A senior colleague told an elderly
biochemist of European ancestry of his observations on the apparent
“ghostly” transmission of information from deceased individuals to those
born after them in West Africa. The senior colleague had systematically
gathered this information and presented what may be termed objective
data with statistics to support his contention that this unbelievable
thing (in the modern paradigm) happens. Unlike some who would have
normally laughed it off, our biochemist heard out his colleague
attentively and studied his data. He found nothing wrong in the report
but could not believe that what his colleague told him could really
happen. He felt there could be other mundane explanations. The said
biochemist, himself a man of travel and adventure, was interested in the
anthropology and genetics of certain human diseases prevalent in West
Africa. Hence, he had the chance to travel there and check things out
with the tribesmen himself. What he saw in “pratyakṣa” — the subjective
first-person experience he had in West Africa — caused a dramatic
perspective shift. After this first-hand encounter, he began believing
what his senior colleague had presented to be true, even if he did not
have an explanation for it. He did not publish it because he knew others
would have the same disbelief as him unless perhaps they reproduced his
experience for themselves — something not easily achieved when it needs
serious fieldwork among the tribes of West Africa.</p>
<p>This is not restricted to the domain of such unusual things, though it
might be enriched there. We have had at least one personal example of
the same in ordinary science in our youth. A researcher had published an
unusual scientific discovery whose full implication he did not grasp.
When we read it, we realized how unusual it was and the major
implications of it being true. However, we simply could not get
ourselves to believe it, for it was not easy to reproduce it by any
means at our disposal in our youth. We also found that other respected
researchers in the field could not reproduce it and disregarded it.
However, a few years later, we were able to reproduce it for ourselves
and see it plainly with our own eyes. At that point, we managed to
develop a formalism to present it quite plainly to the rest of the
community. Seeing our presentation, several saw its reality and started
claiming it as their profound discovery! Because it was in the realm of
the objective, once the formalism was presented, people could make the
flip by following it. However, to develop that, we had to have a
first-person experience of it — enter a state of being a believer —
before proselytizing it. However, not all such flips necessarily result
in correct insights.+++(4)+++ Some of those could be false, both in the domain of
science and religion.</p>
<p>Finally, why do we call it a “perspective shift”? Early on, we read of a
mathematical construct that led us to an analogy of how these insights
work. It is the famous construct of a 2D world — the flatland. For the
flatlander, objects accessing and using the third dimension for motion
will mysteriously appear and vanish. Moreover, a flatlander moved into
the third dimension will suddenly acquire X-ray vision into other
flatlanders. Thus, the insights we have discussed in this note have the
feel of such a vision of a flatlander suddenly gaining access to 3D
space; hence, we term them perspective shifts. Might such a thing also
apply to our 3D space? Some rare people, like <a href="https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2007/04/23/visualizing-higher-dimensions/">Henri Poincare and Alicia
Stott</a>,
the daughter of the well-known mathematician Boole, had the capacity to
“see” 4D space.+++(5)+++ Thus, Stott was able to construct shadows and
cross-sections of 4D and higher dimensional objects in 3D space and make
discoveries in this regard. This led to the great mathematician Coxeter
using her extraordinary ability to assist his geometrical research even
though she had never formally attended college. This was a genetic
siddhi, elements of which she got from her parents and passed on to her
son. For the typical individual, there might even be an inhibition
against such special insights, for it could come at a fitness cost, as
noted above.</p>
<p>In this regard, we note the case of a fellow graduate
student who was a virtuoso programmer. One day he had a mental quake,
after which he remarked to us how he was apprehending 4D space naturally
and seeing hyper-Platonic solids. Sadly, a few months later, he lapsed
into dysfunctionality with a severe mental condition.</p>
