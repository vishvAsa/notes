I've some really bad news for Indians but it might give 1 explanation for our terrible performance after independence. The Department of Health and Human Services of the USA releases a list of cases where it has confirmed scientific fraud by data manipulation and faking from 2011 to date. A basic analysis of this data reveals the following summarized in the below table. It summarize the count of science fraud cases by population of origin: Indian (all of H origin);European, Chinese etc. The percentage of the total fraud cases and the number per million of involved in cheating. These are all the cases where the DHHS office of integrity has unequivocally determined that cheating was done in research funded by public money & almost all of this cheating relates to biochemistry/molecular biology. 

origin count percentage cheaters.ppm  
European 27 45.0 0.1368474  
Indian 20 33.3 6.2893082  
Chinese 7 11.7 1.8469657  
West Asian 4 6.7 0.3809524  
Korean 1 1.7 0.5882353  
Japanese 1 1.7 0.7692308

It has an unusually high count of Indian fraudsters which simply cannot be by chance alone and reflects some deep problem. Though I'm FC myself I must mention that probably all the fraudsters are forward caste so in a sense it reflects on the nation's elite. Let me be blunt - about 1/3 of the fraudsters are v1s. That a H in USA is ~46 times more likely than a person of European ancestry to commit fraud is not something to explain or wish away.+++(5)+++ It is a serious and deep rooted problem. 

Keeping this in the background one may then ask the question that the English have left the country a while back and why did we not bounce back. Nehru, Gandhi all that is fine but here staring at you are numbers that suggest there is something even more serious which cannot be put aside. Ask questions: why we had the difficulty we had for making an indigenous aeronautical engine, assault rifle?  
Our science sucks as the American says and faking it does not let you make in the long run. 
This is something the Indian government should be paying highest attention to rather than setting up hare-brained cash for papers schemes.  

First get the basics right starting at school cheaters by region: 

TN/Ker: 7; Tel: 4; Bengal: 2; Sindh+Panjab: 2; Hindi belt: 3; Maharashtra: 1; Karnata: 1

I cannot hold it against a white professor if he is wary of hiring a deshI grad student; why even a deshI prof should be. A claim was made that the overrepresentation of Indians in the data presented in the above thread was an artefact because we had normalized by the overall populations in the US. First this claim is rather specious for Indians are seen as committing 1/3 of the fraud while those of European descent 45% of them. That is not the proportion of Indians and those of Eu descent in biomedical research. Obviously we used the overall populations for that was the first thing available to us with reasonable numbers. 


Of course we were also working on a more precise normalization with the actual numbers of researchers in biomedical research. However, these numbers are hard to come by.  
In a publication in the Nature magazine we have some numbers for 2017: there are about 69000 bmrs in the USA of which 40020 are of European descent. The total Indian bmrs can be estimated as approximately ~4235.507, Chinese ~12235.908, Koreans ~3929.609,Japanese ~3058.977 to give a reliable total for Asians around 23500. Now those numbers can swing a bit but that is close to the upper limit for Indians.  
The hardest to estimate are the West Asians. Israelis are reasonably estimable based on something mentioned on Haaretz but the rest are unclear. But given that others are not exceeding Israelis by any larger number we get ~1725. So with all this we get the below table.

So Indians are still overrepresented and the probability of this being by chance alone is a very low probability something like ~10^-10. So there is no point trying to say there is no problem or claim it is an artefact
