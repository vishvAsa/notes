      <description>Overview It is very important to critique a paper or a talk, understand its shortcomings, suggest future improvements. Thence, incremental research occurs.
General loop: Find area. Find problem in a given area. Find solution strategy for a given problem. Implement solution, evaluate, communicate.
Popular research mode: Knowing and heavily using old techniques: take a few hammers, hit everything with it. Finding new techniques is rare and hard.
OFTEN, perturb the problem and extrapolate a solution.</description>
