## Central pleasure of solving problems

The pleasure is great when you are tackling a problem,

- which you are certain is worth tackling - guaranteeing enthusiastic
effort;
- requires you to invest an amount of thought and effort which is
neither too small nor too huge in order to start reaping rewards;
like activation energy in chemistry
- you feel confident about making significant progress towards a
solution - or even about solving it.
