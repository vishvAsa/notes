title: Notes

## Desiderata
- Easy to navigate to topic of interests (on a variety of devices)
- Highlights a summary (सूत्रमन्त्रादिरूपेण) decision for execution, separate from exploratory notes.
- Highlights evocatively core ideas and wonders. Tight focus on essence - Learning involves repeated summarization.
  - In math - Record important patterns of ideas and solution strategies, with examples/ counter-examples and important results.
- Builds complex ideas based on clear simple ideas.
- Easy to update, refactor.

## Forms
- सम्बन्ध-जालम् - Mind-map
- सूत्र-वृक्षः - Outline tree
- दीर्घलेखाः - Essays
  - "Graph embedded in 2d as linked text" इव
- विस्तार-पत्राणि - Spreadsheet tables
  - उदाहरणम्
    - व्याकरण-पत्त्राणि    
- Annotations and highlights on top of others' content.

## Media
### Web pages
- Have easy navigation (sub)site-level menus
- Have table-of-content tree menu
- Limit page size - navigation can be boring. Split to multiple pages.
  - Transclude pages with javascript as needed (for printing etc..)
- Summarize: At the top of the page, and repeatedly later as necessary.
  - Also summarize into sUtra-s from point of view of execution.
- When reading original works, add annotations in alternate color, size, style etc..
- Use an system which facilitates easy updates - markdown + jekyll/ hugo + github + wiki-like-theme.

## Typed texts
- I love to read typed texts since they can be searched, digized and saved on the cloud, presented in various ways etc..

### Organization
- I typically like to save texts (with notes) as markdown files, transformed into html by Hugo static website generator for online presentation and reference (using the [sanskrit-documentation-theme](https://github.com/sanskrit-coders/sanskrit-documentation-theme-hugo)).
- I like to separate out different chapters/ parts into separate files, so that the text does not become overwhelming (scrolling can be an irritant).
- For repeated sections, I like to use javascript includes. For example, the same set of verses may appear in multiple pages - rather than having to maintain/ fix/ annotate the same text in multiple files, I just create a separate file and include it where needed.

## Annotation
### Markdown text presented with Hugo
- I mark specially important words by making them **bold** or _italic_. Eg. the verb and the main subject in a sanskrit verse.
- To save labor upon rereading, I add text (indicating meaning or root or ellipsis/ अध्याहार) presented in a different font. Eg. संवृतः, कलः+++(=स्थानान्तरनिष्पन्नः)+++, ध्मातः. +++(यद्यपि प्रत्ययविध्यर्थो गर्गादीनां पाठः)+++ अस्त्य् अन्यत्.
  - This I also use to mark corrected text. Eg. अतः 'गावी'शब्दः गौः इत्यर्थे +++(~~न~~)+++ अपशब्दः ।
- I like to scores phrases or verses for beauty or importance - 1/5 to 5/5. Eg: न चेदानीम् आचार्याः सूत्राणि कृत्वा निवर्तयन्ति ॥+++(5)+++
- For long notes, I use collapsible html details and footnotes.
- doubtful places (marked with ??)
- I like to use a very reader-friendly way of writing sanskrit. For example, I split sanskrit text - eg. इत्य् अलम्, rather than इत्यलम्. More details in the [sanskrit/lekhanam](/sanskrit/lekhanam/) page.

### Physical books

With physical books, I like to mark (with a pencil):

- words that are new to me (with meanings)
- words and phrases that I find beautiful
- grammatical flaws, or doubtful places (marked with ??)
- printing mistakes that I correct
- (In case of particularly difficult verses) - पद-endings (with vertical lines), their vibhakti-s (on top of word endings, numbered १-७, with additional markings as in _१'_ to distinguish words related to distinct objects terminating in the same vibhakti)
- my scores for beauty for (nearly) each verse - 1/5 to 5/5.
    - Sometimes these marks prefixed with क (to indicate that beauty in plot twist is being measured), र (to indicate rasa-beauty etc..)

### Google play ebook notes
- (automatic backup in Drive): [bit.ly/vv-play-notes](http://bit.ly/vv-play-notes). (Summarized in [this pic (see pic info)](https://photos.google.com/album/AF1QipOJQqymltNQMs7RHBz8rD2lWoa3EuEofzhzcYn5/photo/AF1QipPUr0S_cMva23_SAuLpR5J8CFc3kdOacKIn_Cu1).)
- Note: Mistakes in the backup tend to occur more with books Google would need to OCR-ed (because they don't have digitized "flowing" text).
- Example: [https://goo.gl/C9j3Vs](https://goo.gl/C9j3Vs).

- I use a temperature scale for marking verses: 4/4= red 3/4=yellow 2/4=green 1/4=blue (since there are only 4 highlighting colors in google play).
