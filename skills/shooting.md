## Lead poisoning prevention
-Don’t smoke, eat, or drink on the range. You are ingesting just that much more lead in doing so.
-Don’t shoot on an indoor range that does not ventilate by pulling combustion products AWAY from the shooting line. If you MUST shoot on a range with poor ventilation, use an OSHA approved mask.
– DON’T SWEEP with a broom on an indoor range. The floor is COVERED in lead salts, and brooming puts them back in the air.
-Once you are done shooting on an indoor range, wash your hands immediately. If you can take a shower and change clothes ASAP, all the better.
-Lastly, DON’T go to bed after shooting indoors until you take a shower and wash your hair. You hair traps lots of lead particles that will transfer to your pillow, and then to your mouth/nose while sleeping.
