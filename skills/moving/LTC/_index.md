## General entitlement
### Hometown  LTC
- admissible  irrespective  of  the distance. In the Four year block two home-town trips are eligible in two calendar year blocks. The present blocks are 2022-2023, 2024-2025 and so on.  
- An employee whose family lives away from his headquarters can avail this concession for himself every year in lieu of all concessions.
- Any  one  hometown LTC may  be  converted to all India LTC. 

### ALL  INDIA  LTC
- Admissible in lieu of one of two Home town concessions in 4 year block.
- A  employee  and  family  can  visit anywhere  in  India  once  in  a  block  of  04  years. Current ALL INDIA BLOCK period 2018-21. 

### Solo LTC
Instead of concessions  under  this  scheme,  one  choose  to  avail  of  leave  travel  concession  for  self  only  to  visit  the  hometown  every  year - if family stays away there.

### Block years and carry forward of LTC
-  A Government servant and his family may avail LTC in different groups at different times during a block year of two or four years. The concession will be counted against the block of two or four years within which the outward journey commenced. - Rule 9.
- A Government servant who is unable to avail LTC within a particular block of two or four years can avail the same within the first year of the next block of two or four years.
- In respect of officials entitled to Home town LTC, the concession can be carried forward to the first year of the next block only if the official is entitled to a carried forward LTC to Home town for that year. Example.--Suppose an official is entitled to two concessions during the two blocks of 2022-2023 and 2024-2025.
  1. In respect of 2022-2023, he can avail the concession to Home town
     before the grace period, i.e., by 31-12-2024. Then he is entitled to carry forward his LTC to anywhere in India to be availed before the grace period, i.e., by 31-12-2026.
  2. In the above case, suppose the official avails of LTC to Home town after 31-12-2024, this will be debited against the block 2024-2025 and hence he will not be entitled to "anywhere in India LTC". In this case, he will lose his entitlement for 2022-2023 by not availing it before the grace period.- Rule 10.
- The Government servant and his family can visit either the same place or different places. -Rule 11.
