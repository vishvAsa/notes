      <description>Situational awareness In stationary water, the direction of the wind may be determined from the waves. Or one may use the sail.
Preparing the boat While sailing, the fin under the center board should be down in the water. The aft fin/ skeg is always down.
Mechanics The sail and the fin operate on the same principle as an airplane wing. Critical forces are lift and drag. The lift generated by the sail is at an angle to the orientation of the board defined by the relative orientation of the sail.</description>
