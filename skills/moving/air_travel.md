## Factors affecting price

### Travel date/ day

Tickets cost more in certain months.

Tickets tend to cost more on Fridays, saturday, sunday, than on weekdays (especially monday).

### Airport demand/ competition

Flights from Dallas or houston probably cost less than flights from austin.

### Operation costs

Some airlines are cheaper than others.

#### Fuel costs

This constitutes a major part of the operating costs.

Airlines which have access to cheaper fuel - either due to a stockpile (Southwest Airlines in 2000-2009), or geographic location (Emirates airlines) can offer lower prices.

#### Cheap international airlines

Try Sri Lankan or Korean airlines.

## Alliances

The operating areas of any airline is limited. People often end up using multiple airlines to complete their journey. Alliances of airlines can offer tickets for such journeys - thus geographically diverse alliances are advantageous to the business of individual airlines.

## Customer retention programs

### Rewards

They offer incentives for customer loyalty with rewards which correspond to the number of miles traveled.

## Related businesses

To make extra money, they sell products on flights, and offer lounges at various airports.

## Travel agencies

Online and offline agencies sell tickets/ reservations on behalf of airlines, car rental agencies and hotels.

Clubbing these reservations together may result in lower costs for the consumer.

## Hotel reservations

Expedia seemed to keep a 70$ margin on reservations (which was discounted for its employes).

## Air-Ticket sales

It is often advantageous to call an agent - especially for international travel - to look for the best deal: some airlines are not listed on travel search websites.
