At best 1 acre per cow to graze (Midwest uses 5 acres per cow). Plus if you want to grow your own hay then that's another acre per cow.

When fertile, the cow makes a special sound in the morning. 

## Kanchi area practice
In Palaveri village, cows used to be daily left to graze in the village common grazing area, followed by cowherds. There, they mate.  
brAhmaNa-s used to let cows go there when fertile.  
Old cows were fed till they died, then they were buried out of town.
