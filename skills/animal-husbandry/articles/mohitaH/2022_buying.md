## Buying experiences
cow with male calf = lower price

This one was very super but he will sell only after 6 months for some strange reason, doesn’t want to sell right now, I’m guessing he’s hopeful she will give good amount of milk (she’s pregnant right now) so he can ask for more money than what he will get now.

This is from tharparkar breed, a very excellent but very rare breed , only a few thousands survive now, but this is from a village poochcheena which is just 2.75 kms from Pakistan border in Jaisalmer district, trying to avoid that long traveling as the aadhaana program is near, also even though the cow is not costly, asking only 35k on phone, but transport (to sonepat) will be almost equal from that far. We have one tharparkar already.. 

## Transport
Now while the cost of cow might not be much, in the past year alone, transport costs have risen from 12-14 rs to 20-21 rs per km for cow transport. Over a long distance it translates to 15-20k rupees or sometimes even more.




> how does rearing buffalos compare to rearing cows?

Somewhere between desi and videshi cows, people still keep them because you get money for their meat - Same model as the west follows for its cows.

An average buffalo sells for 25k for meat, her calf also goes above 20k at one-one and a half year of age , 3-4 years of age and it goes for 50-60k
