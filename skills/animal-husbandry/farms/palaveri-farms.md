(Palaveri village near kAnchIpuram, till 1991.)


Most village houses had cows.  
They were fed grass from a nearby patch in the morning;  
and later they were driven to a large common pasture outside the village.  

v1-s wouldn't always send their cows there.  
When the cow was in heat (as it happened during certain months), it made a peculiar sound.  
Then, they would send their cows with the other cattle to the large pasture; where they would get impregnated naturally.  

The kine used to drink water and be bathed when needed from the far side of the rain-fed village lake. 

Cows and calves were never slaughtered or sold for slaughter.  
People used to go around cows in a pradaxiNa manner when they encountered them.
