We had a gopa family in srivilliputtur who used to keep all dry cows with themselves until death. Only change would be that these cows would be fed only dry feed and not fresh grass. Post death, they would be sold off where the carcass would be skinned for leather industry. But nowadays this is becoming rare among the gopa (konar) families unfortunately
