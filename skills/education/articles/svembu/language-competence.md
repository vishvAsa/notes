Yesterday our high school age students, our teachers and I agreed on a concrete goal: students should be able to write a short essay in Tamil without error by Jan 1 2021. "பிழையில்லாமல் தமிழில் எழுதுவோம்" as the goal reads in Tamil. I have a deeper reason for this goal. 

Tamil is an ancient language where Spoken Tamil (ST) has diverged substantially from written formal Literary Tamil (LT) and in effect every Tamil student learns two languages side by side.  LT is very strict. This is known as [Diglossia](https://en. m. wikipedia. org/wiki/Diglossia) among linguists.

Literary Tamil (LT) has a strict grammar (probably the strictest among Indian languages apart from Sanskrit ) and is unforgiving about error. Guess what? Computer programming languages also have strict grammar and are unforgiving about error. As I explained to the kids . I told the kids that learning to write clean grammatically correct Literary Tamil has many similarities to how you program a computer. I have long noticed this about Literary Tamil and I dabble in programming languages, so I have an interest in comparative linguistics. 

So we have taken this pledge and the students have promised to put in their best effort to write clean grammatically correct Tamil without a single error by Jan 1 2021. Regardless of any connection to programming, this is a worthwhile concrete goal.  🙏
