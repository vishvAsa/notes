I have come to believe that much of higher education, particularly in fields like engineering or software, is best provided in the context of work. Contextual, experiential and relevant: that's how we describe the @ZohoSchools educational philosophy. 

Abstract principles don't take root in our minds unless we see those principles put into action. In that sense, theory should come after practice. We must first remove the fear about learning something new and that can only happen by getting our hands dirty and feet wet. 

In a crucial sense, our R&D projects are educational projects as well. We learn by doing and the learning cannot be separated from the doing.We apply this educational and learning philosophy in everything we venture into.üôè
