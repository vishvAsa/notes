This essay caught my attention. https://t.co/EH6RVpMZPk "most classicists ... can't sight-read a complex Latin text all that well." Most CS professors cannot code well. Most EE professors cannot design circuits or motors. And so on - these are open secrets in academia. In fact, engineering faculty in many prestigious universities in the US disdain practical engineering. The disconnect was already obvious when I was a PhD student in the early 1990s. It has only gotten worse. Why did this happen? Publish or perish reward system.

The way academic tenure is granted in big research universities mandates that you publish novel research in prestigious publications to have any hope of tenure. With practically useful work it is difficult to ensure novelty and prestige. Hence such work is to be avoided. 

Instead focus on increasingly esoteric and abstract problems, often made up problems where it is easy to ensure "uniqueness". After all if nobody understands the work, it is pretty unique, right? As academic publications become ever more abstract, it becomes the norm.

I was actually actively discouraged as a PhD student from writing plainly and simply. I was told "People might conclude the ideas in your paper are trivial". The end result is that far too many professors get detached from reality. 

Facing that prospect, I decided to code. üôè
