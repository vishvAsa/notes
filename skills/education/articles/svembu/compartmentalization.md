title = "Compartmentalization"
+++

One problem that comes with modernity is ultra-specialization and the resulting compartmentalization of fields of knowledge and of life itself. Fields that became ultra specialized and compartmentalized go stale, similar to what happens to crop land. So does life itself. Efficiency dictates that we "outsource" our children to schools and our elderly to old age homes. Yet in that process we lose an organic life essence. Due to my being in a village, I am surrounded by kids and elderly and that brings me the joys of my childhood.

As the saying goes, in the quest to make a living, we have forgotten how to live. It is important to connect back to that life giving essence. That's the goal of spiritual economics. It acknowledges the necessity to make a living and places that in the context of life.
