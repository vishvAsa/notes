We have been very running a skills training program in one of our rural centers for the past 2 months, with the goal of hiring people who do well in it. We have not required a college degree to enroll but most people who show up are people with degrees and no jobs. What is surprising is the number of fancy sounding degrees such as "MBA in HR" we see. One person with that degree dropped out of training after 3 days because he said "I want a job relevant to my degree". He didn't even want to try.+++(5)+++ His mother - having spent her savings on the MBA in HR degree for her son - approached us again because she wants him to get a job and she cannot understand why he dropped out. These degrees are doing active damage, not just waste time and money.

What India needs are maker jobs, not paper jobs. The investment made to create that MBA in HR program should have built a factory instead. We need apprenticeship programs, not fancy degrees. This has to start in rural India first because there is vast surplus labour here.
