title = "Magnet schools"
+++


In the US there are schools known as magnet schools that enrich high IQ kids. Many H along with east Asians put in tremendous effort to get their kids in there.  
Once in those schools there is tremendous pressure on those kids to build shiny portfolios to look like superstars.  
Among Americans there is considerable emphasis on the appearance of the package rather than substance inside.  
With respect to the appearance there is again a certain emphasis on trying to look like an all-rounder -- essentially a pseudo-allrounder rather than be focused on your genuine strengths.


## Science

The Hindus & East Asians in such magnet schools & their parents are also under great pressure to look like scientists by interning in real science labs.  
What the system, parents & kids don't realize is that good scientists are mostly born not made & no amount of interning can be useful in a serious way if you dont have that capacity for science. Among other things they just don't realize that for being effective in science you need to acquire a large body of knowledge: perhaps reading is even more important than just hanging out in a lab.+++(5)+++  
Many just don't seem to get it  
that if you have no interest/capacity in Newton's mechanics or mathematics or chemistry of aromaticity you might lack the scientific background to be effective in biology.

Most scientists again don't have interest in being allrounders in things like social service or sports.  
So don't expect them to focus on those while neglecting a broad base in science.+++(5)+++  
Science as profession is only meant for some. The rest can be useful high IQ contributors to society & take an amateur interest in science at best. On the whole I found East Asians doing their homework much better than H

## Jews vs Hindus
was thinking about some of these issues having just finished interviewing a bunch of young people aspiring study in sciences. It's obvious the same groups over-represented here have an edge even in my anecdotal samples. However, the Jews do still seem to hold edge in certain matters wrt to the other 2 groups named there. That edge does'nt come from IQ.  
I think H elite & J are quite matched in verbal IQ.  
East Asians less so though the persevere more.  
J have something else +++(mutual help??)+++ beyond IQ that is most lacking in the H. Sadly, this might be behind many H failures as a group (not individuals).
