In the US there are schools known as magnet schools that enrich high IQ kids. Many H along with east Asians put in tremendous effort to get their kids in there.  
Once in those schools there is tremendous pressure on those kids to build shiny portfolios to look like superstars.  
Among Americans there is considerable emphasis on the appearance of the package rather than substance inside.  
With respect to the appearance there is again a certain emphasis on trying to look like an all-rounder -- essentially a pseudo-allrounder rather than be focused on your genuine strengths.
