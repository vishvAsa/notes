The divergence between education & accreditation/keys to the cartel has deepened enormously in the American academe. Many from India (myself included) sought that academe primarily for the latter function although for difference reasons. But in the least it offered educational opportunities outside the classroom, such as through technology access, libraries, talks by experts & sometimes peers. However, that role is diminishing over the years & accreditation remains the most powerful thing going for universities despite their capture by navyonmAda. 

Real education is something that both teacher & student enormously benefit from. I still think that is best achieved via the old model where there is a "lock and key" relationship between the two. There is where I think the H system of the teacher & student finding each other remains relevant for the transmission of knowledge; especially special knowledge that cannot be yet easily learnt & expressed & transmitted by machines. It is a separate question as to whether the machine will eventually get there. But even if it does it might be in some man's service.
