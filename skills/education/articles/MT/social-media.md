In most countries they don't let you ride a motorized cycle, smoke tobacco or imbibe ethanol until a certain age. I believe SM should also not be made available to kids until a similar age. It can be more destructive for females than males. But the current occidentalism flowing into other cultures might not accept such sex differences even if they stare at the face. 

Onw has to develop a thick skin in both real life and SM  
but it is much more likely that this can be
developed in real life than on SM.  
SM offers an opportunity to find truly likeminded people  
unlike IRL where you are usually saddled with  
a relatively limited choice  
which at least for some people in the upper tail of the IQ distribution can find unsatisfying.+++(5)+++  

But doing time with a diversity of people IRL  
can help a person develop some degree of mental balance  
before heading off to SM  
to find the closer mental fits. 

Again that is still not real because those people are physically far away  
and there is nothing like having a real life shared experience.
