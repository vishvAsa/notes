Many Indians still don't get it. Use your hard work and ingenuity to produce goods and services for the country. Don't use all that energy to crack a silly exam. It's a sad commentary on our dysfunctional culture, on our economy, on lack of opportunities for our youth. I was part of that crowd in my youth. Judging myself by my entrance exam rank. Feeling inferior or superior based on a single number. We have to outgrow that. Don't be too hung up on these badges (be it JEE, CAT, UPSC). If you are so smart, try to make the world a better place.

The UPSC exam has its origins with the ICS examination system which originated in the 1850s with the birth of the Raj and end of EIC rule. The ICS system in turn was inspired by the ancient Chinese bureaucratic system.  

The super selective ICS exam had the objective of picking v v v smart British youth capable of governing a large, strange, incomprehensible landmass, with immense dangers and immense opportunities. Does the exam need to be that selective AND "sought after" in our times? No

It can simply take the form of an aptitude test - akin to CAT, along with an interview process where a strong resume with solid academic credentials and / or rich work experience can help matters. You don't need to be a savant to be an administrator.

You needed to be one in 1870.

I lived in the midst of such deshI "crackers"
their focus was honed by millions of years,
going back to when a chimp placed a nut to anvil
and thunderously brought down the hammer
delighting in the delectable kernel at hand
Then I learnt the chIna-s were crackers par excellence
