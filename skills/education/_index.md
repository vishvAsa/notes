## Language
Sanskrit learning [tips](/sanskrit/meta/learning) elsewhere. 

Just 5-10 minutes daily on https://www.duolingo.com/ results in major cumulative progress.

Try the ASSIMIL stuff or Speakly (which has Spanish but not Portuguese).

## History
Recounting "this day in hindu history" type events is an good way to introduce historical and civilizational sense. (Especially for parents of male kids.)
