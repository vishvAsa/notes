A lot of people homeschool kids in the US. In California, it's really easy. Many Christians and Muslims homeschool because they don't want their kids indoctrinated. I pulled out my kids from publish high school (homeschooled for a year and then they did early college -- high school from community college). Both landed in good colleges.

Hindus here don't homeschool because -- 1) they don't know better [immigrants, still figuring the system out], 2) both parents want to earn [so bringing up of kids is totally outsourced], 3) they don't understand the perils of the public school system here, 4) parents would rather earn and buy an expensive home in a 'good' school district. As a result of all this - Hindu kids get brainwashed, become antiHindu and eventually become atheists by 25 years of ago (approx) [you may have noticed many Hindu youngsters in the forefront of free-gaza and all that. And they get ideas into their head that if their parents tell them to marry in their jAti then the parents are castiests! About 40% Hindus here marry outside Hindu community and a huge number marry across jAtis - so traditions get totally lost.

Now the awareness is growing - I am part of a Hindu group who is homeschooling kids in the bay area. There are a lot of conferences for homeschoolers and a bunch of other resources. People are more concerned about the wokeness (gender stuff) than about losing Hindu identity (but due to the former they start realizing the latter).

Both -- not realizing that their kids are away from them all day long (8-5), in the evenings homework, weekends shuttle to classes! No time for anything else (compare to Ms here ... if the kids go to public school - they hang together in a mob, and in the evening a mulla comes to teach them). 

I know many Hindu parents now whose kids are atheists and who are sad and repentant. But time's gone. Even if they don't disown - what's the point? Their values are totally different now. People are starting to realize ... not many. 

Some of the parents are sending at least to after school (or before school) Hindu programs -- e.g. agastya gurukulam online programs. And new schools like (Aum school) are coming up. So there is hope but unfortunately still a high percentage is still asleep... 

Unfortunately, even institutions like Chinmaya Mission who run balavihar are turning out more secular kids (it depends on the area but in the bay area they don't quite instill the Hindu identity ... they get into pseudo vedanta and kids think it doesn't matter what religion you follow!)
