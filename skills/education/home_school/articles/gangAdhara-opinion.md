## Prerequisites
After our own experience in Homeschooling and listening to our various mentors. Here are three most important things that form the foundation for successful homeschooling

### Foundation #1
Wife and Husband have to agree that Homeschooling/Unschooling is the way forward. It is important to invest time to figure out why you both are embracing homeschooling. It is ok for wife and husband to have differing opinions on ways to homeschool (it is natural and that difference in methods of Homeschooling is required, kids will adapt easily). 
However the consensus to homeschool between the two of you has to be rock solid.

### Foundation #2
One parent must have time, to spend with the kid. The amount of time may vary as per age of kid. If both parents are busy all the time, it clearly won't work. One parent should be fully invested in the development of the child. More than teaching the child, observing the child is very important. Once we understand the kid's natural ways of learning and adapt to it, Homeschooling is a cakewalk

### Foundation #3
Hoping that kid will join the rat race at some point of time in life, dilutes your whole attempt of Homeschooling. Homeschooled/Unschooled kids grow up to be wholesome individuals with unique aspirations and ability to handle far more stress and competition in real world. 

## Approach
1. Kids won't need parents after they cross about 9 or 10yrs (like they need you at younger ages). This is your time to maximize your chances of blissful moments with them. If we are eager to teach them, the blissful moments just evaporate. What is left is stress. 

2. Focus on observing the strengths of your kids. Allow them to do things that they want (instead of the set path they are expected to). Win their confidence. You must be the go-to persons for their problems. This is very important. 

### Tips
3. If kids are sleeping for good number of hours, it is a good indication that things are going well. If they are not, try to see how they can spend that extra energy (inside the house). For example, if they want to jump on the bed for an hour, let them. If possible you also jump with them and let them know you like it. If you are worried that bed will be spoiled, think again. 

4. Kitchen is a very good laboratory for kids. Involve them in preparing food. They will be amazed by the colourful veggies, various sounds and shapes of vessels, smells, fire. Kids love responsibility, trust them and give them responsibilities in kitchen.

omeschooling kids have so much time and opportunity to try and fail so many times that they bcom well rounded individuals with good capacity to handle stress and competition (bcos their journey is inward)

## Employment goals
Employability is important. 

### Goals
For my Unschooling kids who are 10+ now. The only guidance given is that they should be earning the respect of the society they live in. Be useful to the society and think beyond their own needs. When they are useful to the society and solving  issues that matters to people in a humane way. Money will automatically find them.

However if homeschooling methods are more focused towards getting a well paying job. Better to not homeschool in the first place. Nowadays conevtional education is more focussed on high paying jobs. Many (not all) of the reputed companies which offer high paying jobs are talking about disruptive products. Not integration of humanity.

If the kid naturally wants to get into academics and a job, that must not be discouraged as well. It is important to be kid centric and go with the flow of the kid's thought and needs.

### Outcomes
Usually when a Homeschooled kid goes to a regular job, it is more or less a dilution of their life (unless it is a well thought plan by the kid).   Earning a livelihood for their own family is too less a challenge for their skills and wisdom. They can be more valuable to the society around them (than only working for betterment of own family).
