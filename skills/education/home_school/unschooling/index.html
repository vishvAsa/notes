<li>Unschooling is an educational method and philosophy that advocates learner-chosen activities as a primary means for learning.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Unschooling is education whereby the learner determines <em>what</em> he learns (content, pace, depth), <em>when</em> he learns it (any age, or not at all), <em>where</em> his learns (home, community, online or school) and <em>how</em> he learns (self-taught, teacher-taught, facilitated, classroom, apprenticeship, online, correspondence, book, video, game, experiential, lecture, volunteering, project, job, or travel).&rdquo;</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>&ldquo;Hunter-gatherers have nothing akin to school. Adults believe that children learn by observing, exploring, and playing, and so they afford them unlimited time to do that. In response to my survey question, ‚ÄòHow much time did children in the culture you observed have for play?‚Äô, the anthropologists unanimously said that the children were free to play nearly all of their waking hours, from the age of about four (when they were deemed responsible enough to go off, away from adults, with an age-mixed group of children) into their mid- or even late-teenage years (when they would begin, on their own initiatives, to take on some adult responsibilities). For example, Karen Endicott, who studied the Batek hunter-gatherers of Malaysia, reported: ‚ÄòChildren were free to play nearly all the time; no one expected children to do serious work until they were in their late teens.‚Äô &quot;</li>
<li>&ldquo;This is very much in line with Groos‚Äôs theory about play as practice. The boys played endlessly at tracking and hunting, and both boys and girls played at finding and digging up edible roots. They played at tree climbing, cooking, building huts, and building other artefacts crucial to their culture, such as dugout canoes. They played at arguing and debating, sometimes mimicking their elders or trying to see if they could reason things out better than the adults had the night before around the fire. They playfully danced the traditional dances of their culture and sang the traditional songs, but they also made up new ones. They made and played musical instruments similar to those that adults in their group made. Even little children played with dangerous things, such as knives and fire, and the adults let them do it, because ‚ÄòHow else will they learn to use these things?‚Äô They did all this, and more, not because any adult required or even encouraged them to, but because they wanted to. They did it because it was fun and because something deep inside them, the result of aeons of natural selection, urged them to play at culturally appropriate activities so they would become skilled and knowledgeable adults.&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;In another branch of my research I‚Äôve studied how children learn at a radically alternative school, the Sudbury Valley School, not far from my home in Massachusetts. It‚Äôs called a school, but is as different from what we normally think of as ‚Äòschool‚Äô as you can imagine. The students ‚Äî who range in age from four to about 19 ‚Äî are free all day to do whatever they want, as long as they don‚Äôt break any of the school rules. The rules have nothing to do with learning; they have to do with keeping peace and order. To most people, this sounds crazy. How can they learn anything? Yet, the school has been in existence for 45 years now and has many hundreds of graduates, who are doing just fine in the real world, not because their school taught them anything, but because it allowed them to learn whatever they wanted. And, in line with Groos‚Äôs theory, what children in our culture want to learn when they are free turns out to be skills that are valued in our culture and that lead to good jobs and satisfying lives. When they play, these students learn to read, calculate, and use computers with the same playful passion with which hunter-gatherer kids learn to hunt and gather. They don‚Äôt necessarily think of themselves as learning. They think of themselves as just playing, or ‚Äòdoing things‚Äô, but in the process they are learning.<br>
When Chanoff and I studied Sudbury Valley graduates for our paper ‚ÄòDemocratic Schooling: What Happens to Young People Who Have Charge of Their Own Education?‚Äô, we asked about the activities they had played as students and about the careers they were pursuing since graduation. In many cases, there was a direct relationship between the two. Graduates were continuing to play the activities they had loved as students, with the same joy, passion, and creativity, but now they were making a living at it. There were professional musicians who had played intensively with music when they were students, and computer programmers who had spent most of their time as students playing with computers. One woman, who was the captain of a cruise ship, had spent much of her time as a student playing on the water, first with toy boats and then with real ones. A man who was a sought-after machinist and inventor had spent his childhood playfully building things and taking things apart to see how they worked. None of these people would have discovered their passions in a standard school, where extensive, free play does not occur. In a standard school, everyone has to do the same things as everyone else.<br>
&hellip;Not all children learn these lessons easily; bullies exist. But social play is by far the most effective venue for learning such lessons, and I suspect that children‚Äôs strong drive for such play came about, in evolution, primarily for that purpose. Anthropologists report an almost complete lack of bullying or domineering behaviour in hunter-gatherer bands. &quot; <a href="https://aeon.co/essays/children-today-are-suffering-a-severe-deficit-of-play">AE19</a></li>
