I follow standard board texts + chandamama/ ambulimama for tamil, telugu, math. Have engaged native-speaking neighbors for the former two. Math - he works out problems by himself by following the textbook.

Also, I get him to read namma Ura rasikaru for kannaDa; sanxepa-rAmAyaNam (vempaTi kuTUmba shAstri) for sanskrit.

Once certain reading material is finished, I replace it with something else.

Teachers

- Ta - neighbor बालकृष्णः
- भरतनाट्यम् - अनुपमा (भूदेवीनृत्यशाला)

## 2022-12
Switched out of agastya gurukulam; started home-schooling with neighbor support.

Teachers

- Ta, Eng (Cambridge text), Math - neighbor उमा
- Telugu - श्रीदेवी वेङ्कटेशपत्नी। 

<details><summary>Reasons for switching out</summary>

- AG was not responsive to emails (response rate degradation was noted). Complaints and suggestions went unheeded.
- Supratyaya needed more focus in tamiL, telugu and math since he already had good sanskrit background and support thanks to his family upbringing.

He loved "khAn academy kids" app.  
He strengthened English alphabet and number knowledge
Purchased byju 3 year plan - but that was useless.

Liked watching approved educational cartoons, like Dr. Binocs; Aumsome.

Taught him kannaDa and devanAgarI letters just by taking him on walks and reading house-name-boards.

## 201901
Learned English alphabets by going around and reading out letters in Mountain View.

Attended a play-home for a few hours each day for about 2 months.

By 7/26/2019, got some story time (eg. Lost bear (houghton muffin)).

## 2017-09
Started walking.  

Started speaking (Grandparent visits lasted 5+ mo stretches)- 

- sanskrit with father,  
- kannaDa with mother and her side
- hebbAr tamIL with paternal grandparents.

Folks (including maternal grandfather) expressed fears about language acquisition delay due to multilingualism. (Turned out to be unfounded)

Acquired some English from cartoons and surroundings.  
Daily visits to park and library (for story time!).

Watched cartoons (eg. Thomas Train, Blippi)
