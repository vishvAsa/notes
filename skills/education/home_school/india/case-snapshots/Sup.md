Switched to new vocal karNATaka-sangIta teacher - neighbour **राजलक्ष्मी**. 1k monthly.

From tiruppAvai, he had memorized 1, 29, 30 since they're required for shAtr-murai. Set to start तिरुवाय्मुऴि।

Previous karNATaka-sangIta teacher was slow (to accommodate newcomers), repeatitive and a bit more playful.

I follow standard board texts + chandamama/ ambulimama for tamil, telugu, math. Have engaged native-speaking neighbors for the former two. Math - he works out problems by himself by following the textbook.

Also, I get him to read "namma Ura rasikaru" for kannaDa; "sanxepa-rAmAyaNam" (vempaTi kuTUmba shAstri) for sanskrit.

Once certain reading material is finished, I replace it with something else.

Teachers

- Ta - neighbor बालकृष्णः . He started teaching him divyaprabandha-s as well. 
- भरतनाट्यम् - अनुपमा (भूदेवीनृत्यशाला)

## 2022-12
Switched out of agastya gurukulam; started home-schooling with neighbor support.

Teachers

- Ta, Eng (Cambridge text), Math - **neighbor उमा**
- Telugu - **श्रीदेवी वेङ्कटेशपत्नी**। 

<details><summary>Reasons for switching out</summary>

- AG was not responsive to emails (response rate degradation was noted). Complaints and suggestions went unheeded.
- Supratyaya needed more focus in tamiL, telugu and math since he already had good sanskrit background and support thanks to his family upbringing.

He loved "**khAn academy kids**" app.  
He strengthened English alphabet and number knowledge
Purchased byju 3 year plan - but that was useless.

Started speaking (Grandparent visits lasted 5+ mo stretches)-
