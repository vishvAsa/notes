### Initial state
ममाश्चर्यम् ईक्षत - प्रथमकक्ष्याया आरभ्य "हिन्दी"भाषां शिक्षतः। अधुना केन्द्रीयविद्यालये सप्तम-कक्ष्यायां पठन्न् अपि देवनागरी-पङ्क्तीम् एकां बहून् दोषान् विहाय पठितुं न शक्नोति, न च लेखितुम्!

He does samidAdhAna, sandhyAvandana (without understanding anything), but does not now anything about rAmAyaNa or mahAbhArata; asks me if I don't feel uncomfortable about what others say walking around in uttarIya etc.. No clue about the 4 varNa-s and their duties.
