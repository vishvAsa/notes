## Purpose

Avoid the discomfort of having to squint at the sun. Or remove glare
from either the computer screen or from reflected light. Or improve
visibility at night.

## Choices

Buy some light safety glasses which fit over prescription eye-glasses,
with either smoke or yellow tinted lenses. Sunglasses should ideally
cover the entire visual range where the sun strikes the eyes: even the
top. For this reason, clip-on sunglasses are inadequate.

Or Use Prescription sun glasses or sun glasses which fit over glasses.
