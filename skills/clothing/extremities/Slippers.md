## Eco-friendliness
- Choices: Rubber, jute, leather. 
- But, many rubber/ jute slippers come with plastic straps and soles - not biodegradable.


## Comparison with shoes

### Adherance

Slippers in general, adhere more lightly to the bottom of the feet than
shoes do. Among slippers too, there are different levels of adherence.

walking is more cumbersome if adherence to feet is low. But, slippers
which have higher adherance usually require socks for comfort, often
because of the sweat and heat generated by close contact.

### Adherence, protection, ease of wearing

Slippers offer lower protection from the surroundings.

Slippers are usually easier to wear than shoes, which often require
tying of lace. Shoes that donâ€™t require lace-tying are generally looser
and more uncomfortable during brisk walks.

### Coolness

Much cooler in summer.

## Absorbant soles

Prefer slippers with absorbant, possibly antimicrobial soles - they are
more comfortable and less smelly in summer.

## High adherance slippers

### Beach socks

Like shoes, with nylon mesh top. Require socks. Available in walmart.
