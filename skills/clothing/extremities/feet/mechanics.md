## Hard soles
Eg. Clogs [Wi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clog).

Doesn't flex under the ball of the foot, so can be hard to walk. Solutions

- allowance for the heel to lift over the sole itself (eg. no/ low covering around the heel).
- Shoe in two pieces, heel through to ball and ball to toes; connected by hinges or leather strips. 
- Curved upwords from under the fore-balls of the feet (Metatarsalgia).
- Tooth under ball of the feet (Eg. Geta)
