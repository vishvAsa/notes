## Heavy or formal use

Use water proof, breathable boots, with minimal heaviness. It must be
usable even on formal occasions.

### Lace

Shoes that donâ€™t require lace-tying are generally looser and more
uncomfortable during brisk walks.

There are shoes which can be easily (un)tied by just pulling a loop. Use
these.

Use easy to tie lace: lock/ elastic/ speed/ quick/ lace.

### Avoid plastic shoes

Leather boots, rather than plastic boots, are breathable.

### Quality of manufacture

Shoes bought from good companies, though more expensive, last longer.

## Comparison with slippers

See slipper section.

## Necessity of socks

See discussion about high-adherance slippers in the slippers section.
