## Importance of right clothing

Norwegian proverb: There is no such thing as bad weather, only bad
clothing.

### Importance of right attitude

The body can function well in extreme conditions, when the right
attitude is adapted. It is possible to wear an attitude suitable for the
cold, as eskimos do: one can welcome the cold temperature rather than
shun it. Similarly, one can welcome dryness and hot weather.

However, one must guard against the risk of inflicting damage to the
body by so tolerating extreme conditions.

## Goodness of fit

For full-arm clothes, sleeves should fit well: otherwise, it returns in
discomfort in the wrist as a result of repeated strain resulting from
putting an over-sized sleeve out of the way while working.

### Things to check while trying out pants

Breath should not be forced or restricted while wearing the pants and
sitting.

A wallet with credit/ debit cards, cash, ID.

## Repairs

Use good fabric glue : common ones do not stick well. Glue tapes are
hard to peel and use.
