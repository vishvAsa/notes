      <description>Belt Useful not only for holding up pants tightly to the waist, ensuring good weight distribution, but also enables attachments like pouches.
Buy a synthetic material belt, ideally one which can be used in professional circumstances, with very little metal (no big belt buckle), so that it need not be removed for airport security checks.
Cargo pants/ shorts Can be found in military stores or online. Professional look is achievable.</description>

      <description>General strategy Layer up Dressing with multiple layers of clothing essential, due to the wide use of heated buildings. It also insulates better.
Wear a warm clothing a few minutes before stepping out - then, air will be trapped inside the clothes.
Accesorize use faceguards, gloves, etc.. for extremities. This provides additional comfort. Eg: a hood not attached to the jacket provides improved mobility.
Maintenance Look for machine washable and dryable clothes.</description>

      <description>Shoes Heavy or formal use Use water proof, breathable boots, with minimal heaviness. It must be usable even on formal occasions.
Lace Shoes that donâ€™t require lace-tying are generally looser and more uncomfortable during brisk walks.
There are shoes which can be easily (un)tied by just pulling a loop. Use these.
