One further point that may help connect the dots: the tweet from Kaushik Gangopadhyay makes this point that "liberals imagine a world without history". This is indeed the heart of the matter, but this ahistoric approach is not restricted to liberals or marxists. The current mathematical tradition, as popularized by Bourbaki - is highly axiomatic and non-historic. This particular movement cuts across all histories - often even to western gods like gauss or euler. As Kaushik indicates, many of us prefer a historic approach to mathematics, and I believe that does make for better pedagogy, but that's not the current fashion. The folks publishing at "Annals of Mathematics" and all these top places tend to be of the non-historical or axiomatic type for the large part.
