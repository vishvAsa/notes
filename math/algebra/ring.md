## Ring
\\(<set, *, +>\\): generalizes \\(<Z, *, +>\\). Division ring.

### Ideal I of Ring R
Eg: Even numbers, multiples of 3 or 4. **Principle Ideal** is generated by 1 number.

### Polynomial ring
The set of polynomials with coefficients taken from a field is  a commutative ring. (Z/2Z)(t).

## Field
Division ring with commutative *. Eg: Q, R, C; not Z.

For prime p: GF(p) or Z/pZ or \\(F_{p}\\) or \\(Z_{p}\\): contains both additive, multiplicative subgroup (\\(F^{*}\\)); Euclid's alg proves inverse for latter. \\(Z/p^{n}Z : n>1\\) not a field.

Size of any finite field is a prime power (Find proof); A finite field is a vector space in n dimensions. 2 equisized finite fields are isomorphic.

## Polynomial representation of \htext{\\(GF(p^n)\\){GF p n}}
Eg: \\(GF(p^{2}): (Z/2Z)(t)/ (t^{2}+1)\\) is a finite field. The elements are from the polynomial ring. Operations are performed modulo the polynomial.

## Ordered field
Field which is also an ordered set, with \\(x+y < x+z\\) if \\(y<z\\) and \\(xy>0\\) if both above 0.

So, \\(x^{2}>0\\); multiplication by +ve (but not -ve) x maintains inequality direction; for \\(0<x<y\\), \\(0<y^{-1}<x^{-1}\\).
