## Specification
Use vectors \\(\in \set{0,1}^{n}\\). Or use an indicator function: \\(I_{S}(x) = 1\\) if \\(x \in S\\).

### Variants
Multiset/ Bag: set with repeats. Class: set of sets.

## Operations
\\(\cup, \cap, -, \Delta\\); universal set U.

### Product
Set (Cartesian) product of sets, \\(A \times B = \set{(a, b)| a \in A \land b \in B}\\).

Subsets of product of sets, or relations, are considered elsewhere.

### Disjoint union
A union of disjoint sets, with each element subscripted by the set it originates from.

### Properties
Connections to logic: De Morgan laws.

## Impossible sets
S : set of all sets which are not members of themselves: See if S is a member of itself.

## Metric spaces and topology
See topology survey.

## Partition of set S
A mutually disjoint \\(\set{S_i}\\) such that \\(\cup_i S_i = S\\).
