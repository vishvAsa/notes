Sort of apropos the last RT from Sridhar Vembu: I learnt some interesting factoids from an engineer: 

### Power generation
The Chinese have vastly superior power generation to other nations.

- China: 10073 Terawatt-hours (TWh; tera=10^12)
- USA: 4387 TWh
- India: 1824 TWh

So while India produces a lot, it is nowhere in the league of the two above it. So indeed, power will be a major shortcoming to field AIs at home.

### Efficiency
American AI chips/GPUs are, on average, calculated as yielding about 58% more tokens per joule. So they are clearly more energy efficient than anything the  Chinese have been able to field (despite their grandiose claims of superefficient photonic chips: no one has seen them really deploy anything like that). 

### India outlook
However, this gets balanced out by the fact that they produce vastly more power and most of that goes for industry rather than residential consumption. 

India will, at best, get second-rate chips/gpus from the Occident. Hence, it will be hit with a double whammy of lower power production and inefficient chips.

3. So far only the Dutch can produce the deep-UV lithography machines needed to make the highest end chips. Their export by the Dutch is tightly controlled by their rotten soybean overlord, the mahAmlechCha. Hence, neither chIna-s nor India is going to be able receive any such tech for their endogenous fabrication.

Hence, the frontier of AI remains inaccessible for India as things stand. The power factor remains a barrier even for nations with cutting edge tech capabilities like Germany, which has the capacity to achieve the Dutch UV-lithography.
