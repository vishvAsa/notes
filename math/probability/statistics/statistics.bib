  abstract = {The purpose of model selection algorithms such as All Subsets, Forward
	Selection, and Backward Elimination is to choose a linear model on
	the basis of the same set of data to which the model will be applied.
	Typically we have available a large collection of possible covariates
	from which we hope to select a parsimonious set for the eificient
	pre- diction of a response variable. Least Angle Regression (" LARS"),
	a new model selection algorithm, is a useful and less greedy version

@BOOK{hastie-elements,
  title = {The Elements of Statistical Learning, Second Edition: Data Mining,
	Inference, and Prediction},
  publisher = {Springer},
  year = {2009},
  author = {Hastie, Trevor and Tibshirani, Robert and Friedman, Jerome},
  series = {Springer Series in Statistics},
  edition = {2nd ed. 2009. Corr. 3rd printing},
  month = {September},
  abstract = {During the past decade there has been an explosion in computation
	and information technology. With it have come vast amounts of data
	in a variety of fields such as medicine, biology, finance, and marketing.
	The challenge of understanding these data has led to the development
	of new tools in the field of statistics, and spawned new areas such
	as data mining, machine learning, and bioinformatics. Many of these
	tools have common underpinnings but are often expressed with different
	terminology. This book describes the important ideas in these areas
	in a common conceptual framework. While the approach is statistical,
	the emphasis is on concepts rather than mathematics. Many examples
	are given, with a liberal use of color graphics. It should be a valuable
	resource for statisticians and anyone interested in data mining in
	science or industry. The book's coverage is broad, from supervised
	learning (prediction) to unsupervised learning. The many topics include
	neural networks, support vector machines, classification trees and
	boosting---the first comprehensive treatment of this topic in any
	book. This major new edition features many topics not covered in
	the original, including graphical models, random forests, ensemble
	methods, least angle regression \& path algorithms for the lasso,
	non-negative matrix factorization, and spectral clustering. There
	is also a chapter on methods for ” wide” data (p bigger than n),
	including multiple testing and false discovery rates. Trevor Hastie,
	Robert Tibshirani, and Jerome Friedman are professors of statistics
	at Stanford University. They are prominent researchers in this area:
	Hastie and Tibshirani developed generalized additive models and wrote
	a popular book of that title. Hastie co-developed much of the statistical
	modeling software and environment in R/S-PLUS and invented principal
	curves and surfaces. Tibshirani proposed the lasso and is co-author
	of the very successful An Introduction to the Bootstrap. Friedman
	is the co-inventor of many data-mining tools including CART, MARS,
	projection pursuit and gradient boosting.},
