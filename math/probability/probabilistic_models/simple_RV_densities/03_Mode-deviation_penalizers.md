For the important exponential decay for squared deviation from mean, see exponential distribution family chapter.

Exponential decay and bilateral-exponential decay distributions are described elsewhere.

## Inverse squared decay
Aka Cauchy distribution. Parameters: mean/ mode \\(\mean\\), height-at-mean parameter \\(h\\). The pdf is \\(C(x; \mean, h) = \pi^{-1} (\frac{h}{(x - \mean)^{2} + h^{2}})\\).

### Limited to positive deviation
Aka half-Cauchy distribution. Parameters: mean/ mode \\(m\\), height-at-mean parameter \\(h\\). Range of the random variable is \\([m, \infty]\\). The pdf is \\(C(x; \mean, h) = 2\pi^{-1} (\frac{h}{(x - m)^{2} + h^{2}})\\).
