      <description>Aka random process. T-valued random variable/ state sequence indexed by \(r\in R\) (often time): visualize as a time-series - a directed graph which is a straight line.
Multiple coin toss processes Consider a sequence of coin tosses. Let \(X_i\) model the outcome of the i-th toss.
Bernoulli process: iid bernoulli trials: the same coin is tossed multiple times, that is \(\forall i: X_i \distr p\). Resulting from such a process is the Binomial distribution for \(\sum_i X_i\).</description>

      <description>Many models often propose that behind the production of a sequence of observations, there are (possibly hidden/ latent) changes in internal state. They allow transition from one state to another to be stochastic.
Let the state at time t be \(X_{t}\). Let \(V\) be the set of possible states.
Assumptions about state transitions Dependence solely on prior state A model which assumes the Markov property described below is often convenient to represent states.</description>

      <description>Problem Suppose that one observed RV \(\seq{Z_n}\) and a filtration or a series of events \(\seq{F_n}\), with the property that \(F_n \supseteq F_{n-1}\).
Suppose further that: \(E[|Z_{n}|] &amp;lt; f(n) &amp;lt; \infty\), that \(Z_n\) is fully determined when \(F_n\) is observed, and \(E[Z_{n}|F_{n-1}] = Z_{n-1}\) (or \(E[Z_{n}|F_{n-1}] - Z_{n-1} = 0\)).
This process is the martingale \(\seq{Z_n}\) wrt filtration \(\seq{F_n}\).
Example The filtration can correspond to the observation of a sequence of random variables \(\seq{X_n}\).</description>

      <description>Model Subsequence/ prefix probabilities: notation First, one models the probability \(Pr(w_n|w_{1:n-1})\) of a word \(w_n\) coming after \(n-1\) words \(w_{1:n-1}\).
Occurrence near sentence terminals We want to use the notation \(w_n|w_{1:n-1}\), with \(n\) fixed, for considering the event where \(w_n\) appears after the string \(w_{k+1:n-1}\) appearing at the beginning of a sentence - distinct from the case where \(w_{1:k}\) is some specific string. We accomplish this by setting \(w_{1:k} = @^k\), where \(@\) represents a special &amp;lsquo;sentence terminal&amp;rsquo; word.</description>

      <description>Observations, states \((X_i)\) are called features/ covariates/ predictor/ input/ observed variables. \(\seq{L_i}\) is the unobserved response/ state variable sequence. \(X_i\), being a partially dependent of \(L_i\), can be viewed as a partial observation of the state \(L_i\).
The state space is \(ran(L_i)\), while the observation space is \(ran(X_i)\).
Use These models are not only used for deriving models for \(f_X\), but also for determining the state sequence \(L\) given \(X\).</description>
