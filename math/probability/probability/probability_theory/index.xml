      <description>Sample/ state space States/ sample points Consider the output of a stochastic system. This output can be considered to be characterized as the state of a system. If two outputs are distinguishable from one another, then they can be interpreted as correspond to different states of the system.
Specification with state variables Two states or outputs are distinguishable by differing assignments \((x_i)\) to certain features or variables \((X_i)\).
Sample space notation Sample space of a statistical experiment: \(\gO\) or S.</description>

      <description>Example applications, modeling intricacies, various interpretations of probability are discussed in the probabilistic modeling survey.
Probability measure The following axiomatization is common to both frequentist and subjective interpretation of probability.
Take sample space \(S\), sigma algebra \(F\). The probability measure is a special measure \(v:F \to [0,1]\); so operates over sets, like CDF. Additionally, the general additivity property (described in algebra survey) is usually assumed.
Other properties of the measure: should be countably additive over disjoint sets: \(\gs\) additive; \(v(\gO) = 1\).</description>
