## Themes
Discover better, more realistic graph generators. Discover more realistic algorithms for various tasks like finding shortest path.

## Applications
Epidemology. Spread of ideas. Movie/ book recommendation.

### Electric network analysis
Kirchoff current (y) and voltage (x) laws, Ohm's law: edge current sources f: \\(Ax=b, A^{T}y=f, y=CAx\\). Elimination in A: rows independent if not loop; Formation of spanning tree; so r=n-1. So, left nullspace basis = loops = m-n+1. Implies **Euler Formula**: n - m + loops = 1.
