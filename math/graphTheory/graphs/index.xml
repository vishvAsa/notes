      <title>Clique tree of G</title>

      <description>Look at maximal cliques, pick a set of such cliques so that every edge is in some clique, make corresponding clique-nodes, make a tree by adding paths between cliques passing through shared-vertex-set nodes.
Eg: 1-2-3 has clique tree (1,2)-2-(2,3).
G can have multiple clique tree.
Junction tree property Take any path in the clique tree between cliques \(C_1\) and \(C_2\); then \(C_1 \inters C_2\) appears in every shared-vertex-set node inbetween them.</description>

      <title>Random walks on G</title>

      <description>Markov process with state graph G Take a Markov chain with probability matrix \(P_{u, v} = \frac{1}{deg(u)}\). \(\pi_{v}=\frac{d(v)}{2|E|}\). \chk
Hitting and cover times Hitting time \(h_{u,v}\): expected time to get to v from u. Commute time: \(C_{u,v} = h_{u,v} + h_{v, u}\). \(h_{u,v}&amp;lt;2|E|\) \why.
Cover time C(G) = \(\max_{v}\) E[time to hit all nodes starting from v]. \(C(G) &amp;lt; 4|V||E|\) \why.
Connection with resistive electric networks Let every \(e\in E\) have resistance 1, thence get n/w N(G).</description>

      <title>Vertex set: metrics, norms</title>

      <description>Similarity measures between u and v are inverses of distance metrics.
Based on paths and random walks  (shortest path).  Katz measure \(sim(u,v) = \sum_{l=1}^{\infty} \gb^{l}|paths_{u,v}(l)|\). Matrix of scores, \(K = \sum_{i=1}^{\infty} \gb^{i}A^{i}\).
The damping parameter \(K = (I - \gb A)^{-1} - I\) if the sum converges. Use \(A = U\EW U^{*}\): EW decomposition, with \(\ew_{i}\) ordered in descending order. \(\sum_{i=1}^{\infty} \gb^{i}A^{i} = U(\sum_{i=1}^{\infty} \gb^{i}\EW^{i})U^{*}\) does not converge \(\forall \gb \geq 0\) and multiplication by \(\infty\) is not well defined.</description>
