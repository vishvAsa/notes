Title: How to cocluster affiliation networks? How to use affiliation networks in link prediction?

Participants: Nagarajan Natarajan, vishvAs vAsuki.

Proposal:
Evaluate various algorithms (including an extension of the Tarjan algorithm) for coclustering affiliation networks. Evaluation of the resulting clusterings of groups will be done by seeing if it is a useful feature for doing link prediction in the user-user network. We will do this by seeing if link prediction, done using only this clustering, performs better than selection of random edges as the predicted links.

We will also see if we can use the affiliation network directly in link prediction by using it as part of a Katz-like similarity measure among nodes.

Data:
We have obtained and prepared data for the Orkut network. So, we have a social network among users and an affiliation network between users and groups.
