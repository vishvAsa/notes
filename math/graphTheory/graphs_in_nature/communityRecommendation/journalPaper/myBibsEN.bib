  title = {Multilevel Algorithms for Partitioning Power-Law Graphs},
  booktitle = {IEEE International Parallel \& Distributed Processing Symposium (IPDPS)},
  year = {2006},
  abstract = {Graph partitioning is an enabling technology for parallel processing
	as it allows for the effective decomposition of unstructured computations
	whose data dependencies correspond to a large sparse and irregular
	graph. Even though the problem of computing high-quality partitionings
	of graphs arising in scientific computations is to a large extent
	well understood, this is far from being true for emerging HPC applications
	whose underlying computation involves graphs whose degree distribution
	follows a power-law curve. This paper presents new multilevel graph
	partitioning algorithms that are specifically designed for partitioning
	such graphs. It presents new clustering-based coarsening schemes
	that identify and collapse together groups of vertices that are highly
	connected. An experimental evaluation of these schemes on 10 different
	graphs show that the proposed algorithms consistently and significantly
	outperform existing state-of-the-art approaches.},

  abstract = {In this paper, the term tensor refers simply to a multidimensional

	allow for efficient storage and computation. First, we study sparse
	tensors, which have the property that the vast majority of the elements
	are zero. We propose storing sparse tensors using coordinate format
	and describe the computational efficiency of this scheme for various
	mathematical operations, including those typical to tensor decomposition
	algorithms. Second, we study factored tensors, which have the property
	that they can be assembled from more basic components. We consider
	two specific types: a Tucker tensor can be expressed as the product
	of a core tensor (which itself may be dense, sparse, or factored)
	and a matrix along each mode, and a Kruskal tensor can be expressed
	as the sum of rank-1 tensors. We are interested in the case where
	the storage of the components is less than the storage of the full
	tensor, and we demonstrate that many elementary operations can be
	computed using only the components. All of the efficiencies described
	in this paper are implemented in the Tensor Toolbox for MATLAB.},

	of a Tucker3 algorithm, which serves as the compression method, (2)
	the optimality theorem of the CANDELINC model, which ensures that
	the compressed array preserves the original variation maximally,
	and (3) a set of guidelines for how to incorporate optional constraints.
	The compression approach is tested on two large data sets and shown
	to speed up the estimation of the model up to 40 times. The developed
	algorithms can be downloaded from http:\\newton.mli.kvl.dk\foodtech.html.},

  abstract = {Symmetric tensors of order larger than two arise more and more often
	in signal and image processing and automatic control, because of
	the recent complementary use of high-order statistics (HOS). However,
	very few special purpose tools are at our disposal for manipulating
	such objects in engineering problems. In this paper, the decomposition
	of a symmetric tensor into a sum of simpler ones is focused on, and
	links with the theory of homogeneous polynomials in several variables
	(i.e. quantics) are pointed out. This decomposition may be seen as
	a formal extension of the eigenvalue decomposition (EVD), known for
	symmetric matrices. By reviewing the state of the art, quite surprising
	statements are emphasized, that explain why the problem is much more
	complicated in the tensor case than in the matrix case. Very few
	theoretical results can be applied in practice, even for cubics or
	quartics, because proofs are not constructive. Nevertheless in the
	binary case, we have more freedom to devise numerical algorithms.Symmetrische
	Tensoren einer Ordnung von mehr als zwei kommen in der Signal- und
	Bildverarbeitung immer ofter vor, weil man in neuerer Zeit verstarkt
	Statistiken hoherer Ordnung verwendet. Es sind jedoch sehr wenige
	spezielle Werkzeuge zur Handhabung solcher Objekte in technischen
	Problemen verfugbar. In diesem Beitrag steht die Zerlegung eines
	symmetrischen Tensors in eine Summe einfacherer Tensoren im Mittelpunkt,
	und es werden Verbindungen zur Theorie homogener Polynome in mehreren
	Variablen ('Quantics') aufgezeigt. Diese Zerlegung kann man als formale
	Erweiterung der Eigenwertzerlegung betrachten, wie sie fur symmetrische
	Matrizen bekannt ist. In einem Uberblick uber den Stand der Technik
	werden recht uberraschende Feststellungen betont; sie erklaren, warum
	das Problem im Tensorfall viel komplizierter ist als im Matrixfall.
	Sehr wenige theoretische Resultate sind praktisch anwendbar, selbst
	fur drei- oder vierdimensionale Falle, da die Beweisfuhrung nicht
	konstruktiv ist. Nichtsdestoweniger haben wir im binaren Fall mehr
	Freiheiten bei der Auslegung numerischer Algorithmen.Les tenseurs
	symetriques d'ordre superieur a deux apparaissent de plus en plus
	en traitement de signaux et d'images ainsi qu'en automatique, a cause
	de l'usage complementaire recent des statistiques d'ordre eleve Malgre
	cela, tres peu d'outils specialises sont diponibles. Dans cet article,
	la decompostion d'un tenseur symetrique en une somme de tenseurs
	plus simples est presentee, et des liens avec la theorie des polynomes
	homogenes de plusieurs variables (quartiques) sont mis en evidence.
	Cette decomposition peut etre vue comme une extension formelle de
	la decomposition en vecteurs propres connue pour les matrices symetriques.
	Notre etat de l'art met en avant des points surprenants expliquant
	pourquoi ce probleme est plus complexe dans le cas des tenseurs que
	dans le cas des matrices. Tres peu de resultats theoriques peuvent
	etre appliques, meme pour les cubiques et les quatriques, parce que
	les preuves ne sont pas constructives. Malgre tout, dans le cas binaire,
	nous disposons de plus de liberte pour concevoir des algorithmes
	numeriques.},

  abstract = {In many problems involving the solution of a system of nonlinear equations,
	it is necessary to keep an approximation to the Jacobian matrix which
	is updated at each iteration. Computational experience indicates
	that the best updates are those that minimize some reasonable measure
	of the change to the current Jacobian approximation subject to the
	new approximation obeying a secant condition and perhaps some other
	approximation properties such as symmetry. In this paper we extend
	the affine case of a theorem of Cheney and Goldstein on proximity
	maps of convex sets to show that a generalization of the symmetrization
	technique of Powell always generates least changes updates. This
	generalization has such broad applicability that we obtain an easy
	unified derivation of all the most successful updates. Furthermore,
	our techniques apply to interesting new cases such as when the secant
	condition might be inconsistent with some essential approximation
	property like sparsity. We also offer advice on how to choose the
	properties which are to be incorporated into the approximations and
	how to choose the measure of change to be minimized.},

  abstract = {Link analysis typically focuses on a single type of connection, e.g.,
	two journal papers are linked because they are written by the same
	author. However, often we want to analyze data that has multiple
	linkages between objects, e.g., two papers may have the same keywords
	and one may cite the other. The goal of this paper is to show that
	multilinear algebra provides a tool for multilink analysis. We analyze
	five years of publication data from journals published by the Society
	for Industrial and Applied Mathematics. We explore how papers can
	be grouped in the context of multiple link types using a tensor to
	represent all the links between them. A PARAFAC decomposition on
	the resulting tensor yields information similar to the SVD decomposition
	of a standard adjacency matrix. We show how the PARAFAC decomposition
	can be used to understand the structure of the document space and
	define paper-paper similarities based on multiple linkages. Examples
	are presented where the decomposed tensor data is used to find papers
	similar to a body of work (e.g., related by topic or similar to a
	particular author's papers), find related authors using linkages
	other than explicit co-authorship or citations, distinguish between
	papers written by different authors with the same name, and predict
	the journal in which a paper was published.},

	is formulated as the requirement that the solution must be on the
	Grassmann manifold, and Newton’s method on the manifold is used.
	In each Newton iteration a Sylvester equation is to be solved. We
	discuss the properties of the Sylvester equation and conclude that
	for large problems preconditioned iterative methods can be used.
	Preconditioning techniques are discussed Numerical examples from
	signal subspace computations are given in which the matrix is Toeplitz
	and we compute a partial singular value decomposition corresponding
	to the largest singular values. Further we solve numerically the
	problem of computing the smallest eigenvalues and corresponding eigenvectors
	of a large sparse matrix that has been slightly modified.}

	the interpretation of frequency transformed multi-channel {EEG} of
	channel x frequency x time data. The multi-way decomposition method
	Parallel Factor (PARAFAC), also named Canonical Decomposition (CANDECOMP),
	was recently used to decompose the wavelet transformed ongoing {EEG}
	of channel x frequency x time (Miwakeichi, F., Martinez-Montes, E.,

	Decomposing {EEG} data into space-time-frequency components using
	parallel factor analysis. Neuroimage 22, 1035-1045). In this article,
	{PARAFAC} is used for the first time to decompose wavelet transformed
	event-related {EEG} given by the inter-trial phase coherence (ITPC)
	encompassing {ANOVA} analysis of differences between conditions and
	{5-}way analysis of channel x frequency x time x subject x condition.
	A flow chart is presented on how to perform data exploration using
	the {PARAFAC} decomposition on multi-way arrays. This includes (A)
	channel x frequency x time {3-}way arrays of F test values from a
	repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) between two stimulus
	conditions; (B) subject-specific {3-}way analyses; and (C) an overall
	{5-}way analysis of channel x frequency x time x subject x condition.
	The {PARAFAC} decompositions were able to extract the expected features
	of a previously reported {ERP} paradigm: namely, a quantitative difference
	of coherent occipital gamma activity between conditions of a visual
	paradigm. Furthermore, the method revealed a qualitative difference
	which has not previously been reported. The {PARAFAC} decomposition
	of the {3-}way array of {ANOVA} F test values clearly showed the
	difference of regions of interest across modalities, while the {5-}way
	analysis enabled visualization of both quantitative and qualitative
	differences. Consequently, {PARAFAC} is a promising data exploratory
	tool in the analysis of the wavelets transformed event-related {EEG}.},

	based only on local information, the underlying normalized cut functional
	is not a suitable measure for the quality of clustering. Further,
	even with a suitable similarity measure, we show that the first few
	eigenvectors of such adjacency matrices cannot successfully cluster
	datasets that contain structures at different scales of size and
	density. These findings provide theoretical explanations to some
	empirically observed characteristics of these methods. Based on our
	theoretical analysis, a second contribution of this paper is a novel
	diffusion based measure to evaluate the coherence of individual clusters.
	Our measure can be used in conjunction with any graph-based clustering
	method (global, top-down, bottom-up), it is scale-free and can determine
	coherent clusters at all scales. We present simple examples where
	various spectral clustering algorithms fail, whereas clustering utilizing
	this coherence measure finds the correct clusters at all scales.},

	of the most effective methods in continuous optimization. It responds
	to the growing interest in optimization in engineering, science,
	and business by focusing on the methods that are best suited to practical
	problems.Drawing on their experiences in teaching, research, and
	consulting, the authors have produced a textbook that will be of
	interest to students and practitioners alike. Each chapter begins
	with the basic concepts and builds up gradually to the best techniques
	currently available.Because of the emphasis on practical methods,
	as well as the extensive illustrations and exercises, the book is
	accessible to a wide audience. It can be used as a graduate text
	in engineering, operations research, mathematics, computer science,
	and business. It also serves as a handbook for researchers and practitioners
	in the field.Above all, the authors have strived to produce a text
	that is pleasant to read, informative, and rigorous - one that reveals
	both the beautiful nature of the discipline and its practical side.MMOR
	Mathematical Methods of Operations Research, 2001: "The book looks
	very suitable to be used in an graduate-level course in optimization
	for students in mathematics, operations research, engineering, and
	others. Moreover, it seems to be very helpful to do some self-studies
	in optimization, to complete own knowledge and can be a source of
	new ideas.... I recommend this excellent book to everyone who is
	interested in optimization problems."},
