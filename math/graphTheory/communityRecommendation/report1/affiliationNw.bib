  abstract = {A variety of clustering algorithms have recently been proposed to
	handle data that is not linearly separable; spectral clustering and
	kernel k-means are two of the main methods. In this paper, we discuss
	an equivalence between the objective functions used in these seemingly
	different methods--in particular, a general weighted kernel k-means
	objective is mathematically equivalent to a weighted graph clustering
	objective. We exploit this equivalence to develop a fast, high-quality
	multilevel algorithm that directly optimizes various weighted graph
	clustering objectives, such as the popular ratio cut, normalized
	cut, and ratio association criteria. This eliminates the need for
	any eigenvector computation for graph clustering problems, which
	can be prohibitive for very large graphs. Previous multilevel graph
	partitioning methods, such as Metis, have suffered from the restriction
	of equal-sized clusters; our multilevel algorithm removes this restriction
	by using kernel k-means to optimize weighted graph cuts. Experimental
	results show that our multilevel algorithm outperforms a state-of-the-art
	spectral clustering algorithm in terms of speed, memory usage, and
	quality. We demonstrate that our algorithm is applicable to large-scale
	clustering tasks such as image segmentation, social network analysis
	and gene network analysis.},
