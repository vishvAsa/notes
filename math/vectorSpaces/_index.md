For numerical analysis, conditioning, stability, differnce equations, differential equations: see Numerical analysis ref.

## Characterization of research effort
See linear algebra survey.

## Interpretations and applications
Not necessarily just an abstraction of geometric 3-D or 2-D spaces. Many other things modelled by fixed length sequences of numbers.

### Modelling the real world
A number can represent a weight, height etc.. It could mean a certain combination of weight, height etc..

### Functions as vectors
#### Using coefficients
Take the polynomial \\(P(x, t)\\) of degree 6 with coefficients given by the vector t. Thus, one can 

#### Using the domain
See function spaces section.
