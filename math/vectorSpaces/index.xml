      <description>Definition, basic operations A sequence of n elements of \(f\), v, is a vector.
Addition, scalar multiplication Addition of vectors is naturally defined: \((u + v)_i = u_i + v_i\). Scalar multiplication is similarly defined.
Geometric model: coefficient sequence Can be interpreted as a point in the cartesian space \(F^{n}\); but which point? That depends on what the basis vectors model, the units, the inner product between them.
As a combination of standard basis vectors Define standard basis vectors: \(e_i\) as a vector with 1 in the ith position, 0 elesewhere.</description>

      <description>Properties Linear independence A set of vectors \(\set{t_i}\) is linearly independent if, for all i, \(t_i\) can&amp;rsquo;t be written as a linear combination of \(\set{t_{j}: j \neq i}\).
Associated hyperplanes Supporting hyperplane to C at boundary pt p: All C must lie on one side of the hyperplane.
Separating hyperplanes between sets.
Span of vectors in S Contains all linear combos of vectors in S. Any linear subspace expressible as Ax = 0.</description>

      <description>Containment of convex combinations X is convex if, for every \(\set{x_{i}} \subseteq X\), its convex combination is in X. For convex combinations \(c\), \([x, y \in C \implies c(x, y) \in C] \equiv [\set{x_i} \subseteq C \implies c((x_i)) \in C]\): from induction. extend this to possibly infinite number of points to get Jensen&amp;rsquo;s inequality!
Containment of line-segments Equivalently, convex combination of any pair of pts in X is in X: Can get the former condition by induction on number of points combined.</description>

      <title>Differential function</title>

      <description>Definition Fixed direction differential fn Aka directional derivative.
Fixing the direction \(v\), \(D_v(f)\) can be taken to map \(x\) to \(D_v(f)(x)\). So, \(D_v(f)(x): V \to F\) is a constricted version of the differential function \(D(f)(x)\).
\(df(x; h) = D_h(f)(x)= \lim_{\change t \to 0} \frac{f(x+\change th) - f(x)}{\change t} = \frac{d}{dt}|_{t=0}f(x + th)\). Aka Gateaux differential.
Alternate notation: \(\gradient_{h}(f(x)) \) : not the gradient vector, but its applicaiton in a certain direction.</description>

      <title>Homogenous forms</title>

      <description>As Polynomials Homogenous Forms refer to homogenous polynomials of degree k. They can be viwed as \(f:V^{k} \to F\).
They can be written as Tensor vector products, as in the case of quadratic forms.
Importance Differential functions of order \(k\) are actually homogenous forms.
Quadratic form Representation \(x^{*}Bx = \sum_{i,j} B_{i,j}x_{i}x_{j}\).
Reformulation: \(tr(x^{}Bx) = tr(Bxx^{})\).
Symmetrification If \(x^{}Bx \in R\): As \(B = H+ H&amp;rsquo; = \frac{B+B^{}}{2} + \frac{B-B^{}}{2}\), skew hermitian part can be ignored: \(x^{}Bx = x^{*}Hx\).</description>

      <description>Properties Obeys Conjugate symmetry, bilinearity, homogeniety, non negativity, positive definiteness.
Bilinearity: linear in a and b separately: \((\ga a)^{}(\beta b) = \conj{\ga}\beta a^{}b\). +++(Range of \(\dprod{)+++\) need not be \(\Re\).}
\(\dprod{Ax + x, y} = \dprod{x, A^{*}y + y}\).
Orthogonality If \(\dprod{x, y} = 0\), \(x\) orthogonal to y.
Associated norm Defines norm \(\norm{x}^{2} = \dprod{x,x}\).
\(\triangle\) ineq holds: Take \(\norm{x- y}^{2} = \dprod{x - \)y\(, x-y}\), expand it, use cauchy schwartz.</description>

      <description>Semi-norm properties Aka pre-norm. Obeys triangle inequality, non negativity, homogeniety / scalability (\(\norm{cv} = |c|\norm{v}\)). But, not necessarily +ve definiteness (\(\norm{x} = 0\) iff \(x\) = 0.).
Norm: Defining properties A seminorm which obeys positive definiteness (\(\norm{x} = 0\) iff \(x\) = 0.). Often triangle inequality is the only non trivial property to verify. Prenorm omits trinagle inequality.
All norms are metrics (see topology ref).
Variants Absolute norms \(\norm{a} = \norm{|a|}\).</description>

      <description>Majorization Take \(a, b \in C^{m}\), rearrange in descending\
order to get \(\set{a_{[i]}}, \set{b_{[i]}}\); and in ascending order to get \(\set{a_{(i)}}, \set{b_{(i)}}\). \(a \oleq b\) (b majorizes a) if \(\sum_{i=1}^{m} a_{i} = \sum_{i=1}^{m} b_{i}, \sum_{i=1}^{k}a_{[i]} \leq \sum_{i=1}^{k}b_{[i]} \forall k\). \(\equiv\) notion from using ascending order and saying a majorizes b.
Interleaving If a majorizes \(b \in R^{n}\), \(\exists g \in R^{n-1}\) interleaved among a such that g majorizes \(b&amp;rsquo; = b_{1:n-1}\).</description>

      <description>For properties which arise when viewed as metric space, eg: compactness, boundedness, connectedness etc.., see topology ref.
Properties of \(R^{n, C^{n}\) See properties of k-cells in R in analysis of functions over fields ref.
Completeness of \(R^{n, C^{n}\) Take vector seq \((x_{i}) \to x\). If V is over R or C, \((x_{i}) \to x\) iff it is a Cauchy seq wrt norm: from equiv property over R and C.
Dimension of V This is the maximal size of any linearly independent set of vectors in V.</description>

      <description>Vector space V over field F Vector space is closed under linear combination of a set of &amp;lsquo;basis&amp;rsquo; vectors: A commutative group wrt +. Linear dependence of vectors: Any of the vectors expressible as a linear combo of the others.
Basis sets of n-degree polynomials (\(P_n\)) and matrices also define vector spaces.
