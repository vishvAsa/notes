## As Polynomials
Homogenous Forms refer to homogenous polynomials of degree k. They can be viwed as \\(f:V^{k} \to F\\).

They can be written as Tensor vector products, as in the case of quadratic forms.

### Importance
Differential functions of order \\(k\\) are actually homogenous forms.

## Quadratic form
### Representation
\\(x^{*}Bx = \sum_{i,j} B_{i,j}x_{i}x_{j}\\).

Reformulation: \\(tr(x^{*}Bx) = tr(Bxx^{*})\\).

### Symmetrification
If \\(x^{*}Bx \in R\\): As \\(B = H+ H' = \frac{B+B^{*}}{2} + \frac{B-B^{*}}{2}\\), skew hermitian part can be ignored: \\(x^{*}Bx = x^{*}Hx\\).

### Connection to triple matrix product
Similarly, in D = ABC has \\(D_{i,j} = a_{i,:}Bc_{i}\\).

## Generalizations
### Monomial
\\(f(x) = c \prod x_i^{a_i}\\).

### Posynomial
Sum of monomials. Used to define geometric programming.
