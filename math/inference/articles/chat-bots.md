Large language models like Galactica and ChatGPT can spout nonsense in a confident, authoritative tone. This overconfidence - which reflects the data they’re trained on - makes them more likely to mislead. 

In contrast, real experts know when to sound confident, and when to let others know they’re at the boundaries of their knowledge. Experts know, and can describe, the boundaries of what they know. 

Building large language models that can accurately decide when to be confident and when not to will reduce their risk of misinformation and build trust.
