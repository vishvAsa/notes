      <description>Propositional logic: 0th order logic Limitations &amp;lsquo;Harry is sick&amp;rsquo; or &amp;lsquo;sick&amp;rsquo; can be handled, but not &amp;lsquo;x is sick&amp;rsquo;.
First order predicate logic Propositional logic with predicates, quantifiers. See Propositional logic section: many properties carry over.
Limitations Can&amp;rsquo;t talk about relations over relations. Eg: G(R(x,y),z).
Fuzzy logic Could be 0.7 correct: not just correct or incorrect.
Temporal logic Entailment. Also see co operator in distributed computing ref.</description>

      <description>Proving validity of theorems We are given a set of axioms and valid statements/ additional rules of inference \(S = \set{s_i}\). Does \(S \implies^{*} p\)? Or is \(p \equiv q\)? So, want to see if a certain relationship between propositions holds.
This is akin to the search for proofs.
Use rules of inference Eg: Modus ponens: \((p \land (p \implies q)) \implies q\). Strengthening and weakening of implications.
De Morgan law: \(\lnot(p \land q) \equiv \lnot p \lor \lnot q\).</description>

      <description>Theme Ontology is concerned with entities: their classification and relationship. Every entity has certain properties.
Motivation The main benefit of ontology is that one can reason about an entity using general statements about the corresponding entity type.
Ontologies are very useful, for example, in the case of understanding speech - where many different words (eg: man, indian .. ) are used to hint at the same entity.
Entity-types Entities having several properties in common can be viewed as being instances of a single entity-type.</description>

      <description>Aka formula.
Language Syntax All sentences are written with symbols/ words drawn from some alphabet, in a formal language. A statement/ formula is said to be well formed if it makes sense according to some formal grammar.
Values The most basic statements are the values T / TRUE and F/ FALSE.
Semantics Corresponding to languages of various levels of expressiveness, there are Logics/ calculii which specify the semantics. They, for example, specify what &amp;lsquo;P&amp;rsquo;, \(\lnot P\) etc.</description>
