## Propositional logic: 0th order logic
### Limitations
'Harry is sick' or 'sick' can be handled, but not 'x is sick'.

## First order predicate logic
Propositional logic with predicates, quantifiers. See Propositional logic section: many properties carry over.


### Limitations
Can't talk about relations over relations. Eg: G(R(x,y),z).

## Fuzzy logic
Could be 0.7 correct: not just correct or incorrect.

## Temporal logic
Entailment. Also see co operator in distributed computing ref.
