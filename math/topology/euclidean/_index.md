See \cite{hallStevens}.
Deals with \\(R^{k}\\), the Euclidian \\(k\\) space, which is described in the vector spaces survey.

Considers metric properties such as distances between points. Perpendiculars, parallels, projections.

Relationship between angles at the intersection of a line with parallels or in a triangle (and other polygons). Similarity and congruence of triangles (and other polygons). Angle bisectors, Medians in a triangle intersect at incenter, circumcenter.

Circle; lines, angles, triangles, chords, arcs in circles. Tangents, Intersection of circles. Ellipsoids, spheres.

Polytopes: an object in \\(R^n\\) whose boundary surfaces are flat. Convex polytopes: polytopes which are also convex sets.

## Area/ volume
The notion of area/ volume in case of euclidean spaces corresponds to the box (Lebesgue) measure over the euclidean space. This is described in the vector spaces survey.

Ellipse, circle. Surface area of n-ball: \\(\frac{dV_{n}}{dr}\\).

The r-radius \\(n-1\\) hypersphere \\(S^{n-1} = \set{x \in R^{n}: \norm{x} = r}\\): a n-1 dim manifold. Encloses a n-ball with volume \\(V_{n} = \frac{\pi^{\frac{n}{2}}r^{n}}{\Gamma(\frac{n}{2}+1)}\\) \why.

## Trigonometry
Obvious with the right construction: sin (A+B) = sin A cos B + cos A sin B. cos (A+B) = cos A cos B - sin A sin B. Trigonometry in triangle calculations. \\(\sin^{-1} x, \cos^{-1} x\\).
