There are two distinct types of careers:

- One where achieving success is highly accessible and predictable (doctor, programmer, plumber, architect).
- The other where chance plays a huge role in achieving success (musician, author, startup founder, youtuber).

If you want to pursue an unpredictable career, you can’t treat it the same as a regular job. What works in the predictable world doesn't work in a world where randomness dominates in what makes it and what doesn't. You need to unlearn almost everything and work differently:

Instead of:

- Hard work → Trial & error
- Focus → Many things at once
- Optimization → 80/20 rule
- Consistency → Intensity
- Avoid distractions → Embrace randomness
- Practice 10,000 hours → 10,000 bets
- Goals → Stay in the game
- Efficiency → Slack in the system

I'm not convinced everyone truly prefers the second, but I think many people pursue the second while believing they're in the first.
