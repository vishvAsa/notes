There is this technocratic idea that Economics is a scientific discipline like Physics. Not true. Subject to the "conservation law" that the world cannot consume what it has not produced yet, economic relationships arise from our personal, social, cultural and moral choices. A productive community can express a moral preference for an egalitarian ethos. At Zoho, we express a moral preference for all of us having the same food and setting for everyone i.e, no special executive dining rooms. No economic law dictates a "correct" course here.

As I once joked, I made a choice to invest in designing an LTE modem vs buying a private jet! Again no economic law can dictate this choice. Yet, these choices greatly influence economic outcomes and the overall well being of a community.

Political economy - and economics is explicitly political outside of the "conservation law", which sets a mathematical boundary - is about how a company or community makes these choices of where to commit resources. LTE modem or private jet? Bullet trains or rural broadband? I respect politicians more than economists for this reason: politicians grapple with the political economy choices, however (very!) imperfectly, while economists pretend to give objective answers from their mathematical models. Most of those models are garbage in, garbage out.

India's curse is that among Asian nations, India has had the most economists advising us. East Asian nations like Japan or Taiwan or South Korea have historically produced few economists. I see a direct connection between their prosperity and their producing few economists! We must get rid of the technocratic obsession with credentialed economists and go by experience and observation on the ground. We must always keep the political economy of choices in mind, governed by our cultural and social ethos. Good politics is good economics.


## On Krugman
(Source: https://threader.app/thread/1470219919711113216)

Krugman is contesting the idea that inflation hits low-income households hard. Low income households CONSUME a far greater proportion of their income than high income households. When CONSUMER prices go up, all consumers feel poorer but low income households feel the worst. Anyone with a grasp of reality knows this. Every politician of every party knows how rising consumer prices lose them elections.

Yet we have a genius Nobel economist questioning this basic premise. Krugman is my poster child for academic economics having gone horribly wrong. The rot runs far deeper in academia. Fields as diverse as Electrical Engineering and Psychology have become increasingly detached from reality. We must not accord the academic priesthood the automatic presumption of expertise but evaluate their claims carefully. üôè 

### Trade policy
Krugman has written a NYT piece attacking Trump's trade policy against China, which attempted to (but failed to) reduce persistent,  decades-long US trade deficits and Krugman never mentions the word "debt"! I will analyze why the policy failed. 

First, the obvious consequences of those persistent trade deficits, particularly in manufactured goods are:

- a) Explosion in US debt with the US becoming a largest net debtor from being a net creditor nation
- b) The erosion of the US manufacturing base which destroyed know-how
- c) The loss of manufacturing base resulted in loss of good wage jobs for non-college-going workers
- d) Rising US foreign debt obligations were recycled back (invested) in US stock and real estate markets blowing monster bubbles in both, which mostly benefited the wealthy
- d) Loss of high paying manufacturing jobs combined with financial and real estate bubbles resulted in massive increase in inequality
- e) The US imported goods and created "token-distribution" services jobs (aka bullshit jobs) to claim those goods, an erosion of real skills

Trump's tariff policy failed to yield quick results because the erosion of industrial capability and skills in the US, which arose from decades of flawed policy, cannot be reversed so quickly with tariffs. It would take a decade for the US to regain its industrial base.

All of the above have been fairly obvious to many economic observers for a while, yet @paulkrugman's grasp of basic economics and how industry works is so weak he cannot see it. He represents the bankruptcy of academic macro.

This matters to us in India because US-trained economists like @APanagariya and Raghuram Rajan have been pushing essentially the same line as Krugman: liberalize import of manufactured goods, don't worry about persistent trade deficits and so on. That policy course is bad for India. India needs to develop strong manufacturing know-how and skill base. That is the only way to ensure well-paying jobs for our workers, particularly the vast majority without college degrees. It takes time to develop that industrial base and we need clear policy support.

Finally two books that challenge the Krugman line and must read for us in India:
