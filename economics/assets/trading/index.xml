      <description>These are especially useful for highly liquid items Eg: negotiable securities. Portfolio decisions can be based on looking at the chart for the appropriate time period. With a chart, one can observe features like support and resistence levels. Thence, one can decide whether it is a good time to buy or sell an equity.
This is because charts contain in them the evaluations of large fund managers etc.. But that can be misleading in case of bubbles.</description>

      <description>Anticipated trade One agent makes a deal with another to buy a certain amount of an ’underlying’ security on a specified future date at a certain ’strike’ price. To satisfy this deal, the seller is obliged to buy the security - if he does not already hold it - on or before the due-date.
Motivation The seller is betting that the market price of the security on or before the due-date will be lower than the set price; and the buyer is betting that the market price will exceed the set-price on or after the due-date.</description>

      <description>Definition The buyer of an option gains the right (not obligation) to buy or sell (depending on the option type) an underlying security (100 shares in case of a standard option) at a specified strike price per share by a certain expiration day in case of American-style options (which we consider here), or exactly on a certain day in case of European-style options.
The seller of such an option is called a writer.</description>

      <description>Here we consider basic (possibly multi-step) actions involving various negotiable instruments in the market.
Buying and selling Basic actions in a stock market are to buy or sell a security. The securities exchange has programs/ machines which effectively communicate the price of various stocks based on what prices people are asking/ willing to pay for them - by recording these bids.
Market price order A market order is an order to buy or sell a stock at the current market price.</description>
