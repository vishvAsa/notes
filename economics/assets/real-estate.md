## Communal ownership
### History
Once upon a time joint families thrived and jointly owned property. In 1900s they disappeared. Also since then, there are hardly any takers for hindu joint family ownership/ taxation structure(reason being "next generation won't think like you").

Some religious sects appear able to manage large land holdings over the long term. Eg. Radhasoami Satsangh's dayAlbAgh near agra had 1200 green acres by 2020.

### Risks
Government risk: with a single stroke they can take away the lands as they did with land ceiling, tenant owner etc.. applied to hindu temples and institutions in 1960s.
