## Public goods

### Traits

#### Non-exclusion

Once the good has been provided - possibly with the support of certain people, there is no good way of excluding others (including unconnected ’free-riders’) from using it.

#### Non-rivalry

Use of the good by a person does not make it less enjoyable or worthwhile for other users.

### Examples

Fresh air, pleasant weather. More controversial examples: roads.

### Funding

Provision of public goods is often done by the government.

#### Private sponsorship

A limited group of consumers (aka the K-group) could sponsor public goods - and tolerate free-riders.

### Media

Information in the form of songs, visual performances, books which were once private, is increasingly being digitally copied and distributed using computers - mainly by enthusiasts acting against the wishes of publishers, who hold the copyright, and often with the approval of the original artists.

#### Videos

Websites like youtube allow sharing videos. Copyrighted work may be sought using services like projectfreetv etc..

#### Books

bookz or ebooks channels on the undernet (good as of 2004-2011).

## Private

Aka market goods. Eg: food.

### Access vs ownership

For low-idling items, like a microwave: it is better to own the item. High idling items, like a power drill, car, jewels are better rented.

### Price and rationing

#### Rationing

Rationing is a mechanism for distributing goods to people.

#### Price rationing

Price balances demand and supply in the market. The pricing of goods with money is described in the money section.

##### Industrial vs investment demand

Prices are driven often by current demand and supply: aka industrial demand. Prices may also be driven by speculation about future demand and supply relative to other goods/ currency: aka investment demand. Investment demand can be very fickle, and speculation may be mistaken.

##### Elasticity of demand

The efficacy of increasing price in decreasing demand varies. In case of elastic demand/ prices, demand smoothly decreases with increasing price.

In case of inelastic demand, consumers are willing to pay higher price without decreasing demand. This is especially true in case essential commodities - like petroleum or food; or in case of addictive commodities - like psychotropic drugs.

#### Non-price rationing

Artificially restricts demand to keep price below the equilibrium. Ensures that rich folk don’t get everything in the time of shortages. Ration coupons, books, queues, taxes.

### Swaps/ barter

Internet has facilitated barter: Eg: swaptree for books.
