      <description>&lt;p&gt;Gold imports are counted as &amp;ldquo;consumption&amp;rdquo;, but most Indians would consider gold to be a form of long term insurance, a form of savings. All of us know of families that tapped into their gold &amp;ldquo;reserves&amp;rdquo; to pay for college, to start a business, to pay for healthcare and so on. India imported nearly $50 billion of gold last year; possibly even more gold got into India unofficially. Indians are treating gold as a &amp;ldquo;reserve asset&amp;rdquo; and long term it is a better reserve asset than US dollar, treasuries, Euro, Yen etc. Gold is the people&amp;rsquo;s reserve asset.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
