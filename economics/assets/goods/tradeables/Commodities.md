## Price trends

Commodity prices are highly sensitive to (speculation about) the supply situation (relative to demand). This leads to great volatility.

## Long term investment suitability

Historically, most commodities have only keep up with inflation. In the long term, Investing in commodities is essentially betting against inflation (and to an extant human ingenuity given war, disease etc).

## Oil

Oil is used in distribution of goods and services. Only a few nations produce it, and they form a cartel - OPEC - which can often arbitrarily increase price as a way to bargain for concessions from their buyers. But, the cartel is slightly inefficient because various producers often violate agreements due to self interests.

When its price increases, the value of all common goods increases.

## Gold
### Safe Gold and MMTC-PAMP
No annual storage fees for 5 years. Only 3% GST at time of purchase. 

Both MMTC-PAMP and Digital Gold India have appointed IDBI Trusteeship Services Ltd as their trustee. Among other things, the trustee ensures the quality of the gold and that the gold sold to investors is segregated and available in the vaults. The gold held in the vaults is also insured against any loss.
