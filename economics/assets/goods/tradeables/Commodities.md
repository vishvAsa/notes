## Price trends

Commodity prices are highly sensitive to (speculation about) the supply situation (relative to demand). This leads to great volatility.

## Long term investment suitability

Historically, most commodities have only keep up with inflation. In the long term, Investing in commodities is essentially betting against inflation (and to an extant human ingenuity given war, disease etc).

## Oil

Oil is used in distribution of goods and services. Only a few nations produce it, and they form a cartel - OPEC - which can often arbitrarily increase price as a way to bargain for concessions from their buyers. But, the cartel is slightly inefficient because various producers often violate agreements due to self interests.

When its price increases, the value of all common goods increases.

<details><summary>Recommendations</summary>

- Navratan, Bhima
- Abaran jewelry, Praveen Jewels
- Shubh Jewellers (which is the outlet of a manufacturing firm) used to charge a bit more extra on gold rate but no making charges
- GRT but have not tried in Bangalore.
- Jayanagar 4th block has series of Gold Jewellery shops. All are reliable from quality standpoint, one can bargain based on making charges and design.

</details>

#### Strategy
- Look for the making charges when you invest. It can go upto 36%..üò£. Be very clear in your mind that you will not get carried away with the designs and will stick to basic designs with very low making charges. You can tell them beforehand that you are looking for making charges below 10% or 5%. (5% is a very optimistic figure .. All these big brands have high making charges)
