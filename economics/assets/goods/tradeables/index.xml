      <description>&lt;p&gt;(Excluding precious metals used as currency)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;price-trends&#34;&gt;Price trends&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Commodity prices are highly sensitive to (speculation about) the supply situation (relative to demand). This leads to great volatility.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;long-term-investment-suitability&#34;&gt;Long term investment suitability&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Historically, most commodities have only keep up with inflation. In the long term, Investing in commodities is essentially betting against inflation (and to an extant human ingenuity given war, disease etc).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;oil&#34;&gt;Oil&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Oil is used in distribution of goods and services.
