Hereâ€™s howðŸ‘‰ Well, kudos to the Employees&amp;rsquo; Deposit-Linked Insurance (EDLI) scheme.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Under EDLI, all folks with an EPF account are eligible for a free life insurance cover.For those unaware, EPF stands for Employee Provident Fundâ€”a retirement benefits scheme under which monthly contributions are made by the employee and employer to the employee&amp;rsquo;s EPF account.The amount collected, along with interest, is then provided to the employee on retirement.The insurance cover ranges from a minimum of â‚¹2.5 lakh to a maximum benefit of â‚¹7 lakh, calculated according to the deceasedâ€™s salary drawn in the last 12 months of employment.In case of an unfortunate demise of the account holder, the nominee(s) of the EPF account has to fill a form to claim insurance benefits, called Form 5 IF, which has to be submitted to the EPF commissionerâ€™s office with the required documents.A lump-sum payout is then credited directly to the nomineeâ€™s bank account.Whatâ€™s the catch? You have to be an active contributor to the EPF scheme prior to demise.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
