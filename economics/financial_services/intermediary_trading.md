Basic negotiable securities tradings actions are considered elsewhere.

## Role in markets

Intermediary traders buy and sell items, holding them for a short time while it changes hands between long-term investors. In doing so, they make a profit.

So, they focus strongly on the guessing and taking advantage of the motives of investors - aka front-running investors.

### Liquidity, cost

The benefit they provide is in bringing greater liquidity to assets, buy supplying a sea of ready purchasing and selling power. So, an investor wanting to find a seller or a buyer has a easier time.

The disadvantage is that they increase the costs to investors: sellers receive less while buyers would pay more than if they were dealing directly with each other.
