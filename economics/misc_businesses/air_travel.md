## Factors affecting price

### Travel date/ day

Tickets cost more in certain months.

Tickets tend to cost more on Fridays, saturday, sunday, than on weekdays (especially monday).

### Airport demand/ competition

Flights from Dallas or houston probably cost less than flights from austin.

### Operation costs

Some airlines are cheaper than others.

#### Fuel costs

This constitutes a major part of the operating costs.

Airlines which have access to cheaper fuel - either due to a stockpile (Southwest Airlines in 2000-2009), or geographic location (Emirates airlines) can offer lower prices.

#### Cheap international airlines

Try Sri Lankan or Korean airlines.

## Alliances

The operating areas of any airline is limited. People often end up using multiple airlines to complete their journey. Alliances of airlines can offer tickets for such journeys - thus geographically diverse alliances are advantageous to the business of individual airlines.

## Customer retention programs

### Rewards

They offer incentives for customer loyalty with rewards which correspond to the number of miles traveled.

## Related businesses

To make extra money, they sell products on flights, and offer lounges at various airports.

## Travel agencies

Online and offline agencies sell tickets/ reservations on behalf of airlines, car rental agencies and hotels.

Clubbing these reservations together may result in lower costs for the consumer.

## Hotel reservations

Expedia seemed to keep a 70$ margin on reservations (which was discounted for its employes).

## Air-Ticket sales

It is often advantageous to call an agent - especially for international travel - to look for the best deal: some airlines are not listed on travel search websites.

### For travel inside USA

Look at Orbitz and expedia. Check Southwest website, as it is not listed in these.

### Agents

EDESTINATIONS INC 1-800-949-FARE (rAjIv: works 7 days a week)

## Car rentals

Car rentals seem to be cheaper on the internet - due to greater competition and clarity for the customer.

## Communication networks

These networks provide infrastructure and services like internet access, (mobile) telephony, cable television etc..

## Mobile connections

Mobile connection services are either prepaid or postpaid.

### Prepaid services

With these services, customers buy a certain quanta of incoming and outgoing connections of various types.

### Postpaid services

This is offered to credit-worthy customers.

#### Contracts

People are attracted to enter into a contract in which they agree to use a company’s mobile connection services for a certain period of time, in exchange for incentives such as discounts on attractive mobile devices.

The cost of these devices and incentives provided to sales agents is, of course, recovered from the profits earned using the customer’s business.

##### Group contracts

Aka family plans. Companies try to attract the close contacts of a customer to use the same network by offering reduced prices for groups of people.

##### Early termination

Early termination involves payment of certain fees. If a person is terminating the contract early because he is abroad, this fee may often be waived in USA.

##### Renewal

Companies offer to renew the contract before the termination \[**Incomplete**\]
