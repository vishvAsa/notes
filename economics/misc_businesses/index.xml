      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;fundamentals&#34;&gt;Fundamentals&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The basic problem in advertising is finding the audience who is likely to buy the product/ service (target audience).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;placement-and-position&#34;&gt;Placement and position&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There may be place for a limited number of advertisements to be displayed in a certain venue. Yet, there may be several advertisers competing for those places. Further they may be interested in gaining favorable placement in the ad-list.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;coupon-distribution&#34;&gt;Coupon distribution&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Consider a seller wanting to advertise inventory to target customers, or wanting to spur business. In exchange for a share in the resulting sales revenue, Internet coupon distribution companies like groupon make a seller’s discount-coupons available to customers. Customers are attracted by the prospect of getting goods/ services at a cheaper rate. The sellers are attracted by the prospect of undiscounted business the customer’s visit may generate.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;retail-vs-wholesale&#34;&gt;Retail vs wholesale&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Retail business focuses on distributing goods to consumers, while making a profit. Wholesalers focus on selling goods in bulk at a lower price to other businesses and distributors. Eg in USA: Sam’s club, costco. In India: Metro.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;price-discrimination&#34;&gt;Price discrimination&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Different people are willing to pay different prices for the same product, and retailers try to exploit this.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In general, retailers try to distinguish the two types of customers by offering lower prices only to those who participate in some undesirable process which costs extra time and attention- eg: waiting for a certain day to make a purchase, committing to purchase in advance, gathering coupons.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;agriculture&#34;&gt;Agriculture&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;resources&#34;&gt;Resources&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Agriculture requires non-saline water, fertile land, seeds, labor. Of these, overall, water is often most scarce.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;artificial-production&#34;&gt;Artificial production&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Research is on to produce meat in-vitro.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;demand-and-supply&#34;&gt;Demand and supply&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;past&#34;&gt;Past&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The discovery of agriculture enabled mass, reliable food production. For most of history, we have had a food surplus. When there was a famine in one country, one could rely on imports from another.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;forecast&#34;&gt;Forecast&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Human population is growing.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;bet-contract&#34;&gt;Bet contract&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;2-outcomes&#34;&gt;2 outcomes&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Consider an event E. A bet between two people (A and B) is a contract which says that if E comes to pass (usually by a specified time), person A will pay an amount x to B; otherwise if E doesn’t happen, B will pay y to A.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;y is called the bet liability.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h4 id=&#34;viability-of-the-bet&#34;&gt;Viability of the bet&lt;/h4&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Rational B (who is not risk-averse) will enter the contract if according to his evaluation of &lt;em&gt;a&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;a__x&lt;/em&gt; - (1 - &lt;em&gt;a&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;em&gt;y&lt;/em&gt; ≥ 0 or @#a \geq \frac{y}{x+y}#@. Rational A will similarly enter the contract only if \(a \leq \frac{y}{x+y}\).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;process-design-productivity-and-quality&#34;&gt;Process design: Productivity and quality&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;How to transform the shop-floor/ assembly process and the procurement/ design process to increase quantity and quality?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;quality-quantity-trade-off&#34;&gt;Quality/ quantity trade-off&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When the focus is on quantity, quality often suffers, as workers are provided incentives and punishments which, focusing on quantity, largely ignore quality. Quality control is often postponed to a later stage.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Toyota process, observing that correcting/ tolerating mistakes can be costly, tries to ensure that they get it right the first time - workers have the ability to stop the assembly-line in order to fix a mistake when they make/ detect it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;credit-cards&#34;&gt;Credit cards&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Credit cards are a relatively safe way for lenders to encourage public borrowing while making purchases - that way, they can make a profit.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Stores - possibly getting a commission - often offer credit cards (with attractive terms) under their brand-name to their customers; but they are actually managed by banks.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The necessary infrastructure is managed by one of a handful of companies - like Visa, MasterCard, AmericanExpress etc..&lt;/p&gt;</description>
