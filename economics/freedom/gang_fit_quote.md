title = "Money vs Freedom: GangFit"

From GangFit 3 by Mark Baker/ GuruAnaerobic:

> There are 2 types of individual who trade freedom for money.
>
> 1 The employed (millions of these). They spend all their weekdays working for money. They earn money so they can pay bills and feel free at the weekend  
> 2 The individual who is never satisfied - they want more money. The business owner/megarich, entrepreneur, wanker, etc. They are boring show-offs and even more boring company; they only talk about making money. Men like this surround themselves with plastic women and sports cars. Women like this are childless, depressed, and drink too much wine.

> There are 3 types of individual who trade money for freedom:
> 1 The hobo/tramp/homeless/drop-out (take out the drug addict, those with mental problems). This life is tough - the heroically naïve Chris McCandless ended up dying in a bus in Alaska  
> 2 The purposely unemployed, on welfare (gainfully or ungainfully)  
> 3 Those who work just enough to spend the majority of time doing what they like (selfemployed/part-time employee/entrepreneur/creator, etc.)  
> 
> There are 4 types of individual where money vs freedom is irrelevant.  
> 1 The individual who has investments, passive income, a business run by others, an automated income stream, etc, Anything which brings in money with minimal time involved. Money flows into their pockets whatever they are doing  
> 2 Someone who has sold a business, made a mint in some way), and no longer needs to work. These people may choose to spend some of their time only on projects/ideas/social enterprises which interests them – more interesting than playing golf until they die (another form of zombiefication)  
> 3 Professional artisans/writers who love their work. Their idea of freedom is doing their work and being paid for it. Work and freedom are the same thing  
> 4 The landed, gentry, aristocrat; those with inherited wealth/assets; and rich kids'. The aristos conserve and pass on their wealth to the next generation (as is their duty), the rich kids blow it on parties, drugs - then start a fashion chain or similar, which usually fails.  
> 
> It is far better to focus on being free (escaping entrapment) than having money. The average numbskull response, “Stupid advice. You can't be free without money!” Of course, numbskull – freedom with no money isn't freedom, it’s mostly hell. Concentrating on true freedom (in today's society) necessitates being hyper-concerned with money, but not allowing money to enslave you. In fact you have to be almost paranoid about money (but not in the way an employed person is paranoid about it) because you understand that the right sort of money, how it flows to you, how it's created, has the power to transform your life and allow you to permanently escape the rat race.

> Gang Fit chooses the freedom route over the money route but doesn't want starvation or deprivation to come with the freedom, even though it is prepared to risk those in the pursuit of freedom.  
> First note: It may come with it for a while, but don't be a fucking weakling - being scared of having no money keeps millions of zombies at work.   
> Second note: You won't realise that suffering is good for you whilst you're in it; only later on when you look back on it. It's deep, very deep - possibly the deepest part of having achieved something; that you went through immense suffering.  
> Maybe Gang Fit is wrong; it's possible that suffering is a vital part of growth. The forging of the warrior mind and a full wallet.
> 
> 2 types of freedom (which don't involve suffering, living on nothing: i.e Chris McCandless Syndrome)
> The freedom to not have to do anything you don't want to do  
> As above, but with the additional freedom to do whatever you feel like doing, whenever you feel like doing it.
> 
> Read 'A Millionaire at $500 Per Week’ later in Gang Fit about this - you'll see that anyone who is motivated and has a brain bigger than walnut can achieve the former. Why don't parents tell their kids? Why doesn't school teach it? They say that school prepares kids for life. Improves their chances” – what does that even mean? Being free (not trapped) and having no problems is the best fucking thing to happen to anybody, they should be teaching that at school. Brainwashed kids have been brainwashed by adults who themselves have been brainwashed. 
> ... The majority of people in your street are not free. You are literally surrounded by zombies; people who traded freedom (their time) for money, They are so mentally undeveloped they don't even know it. Yet they are not idiots in the low IQ, dribbling, retarded, butt-ugly face sort of way. Being free has nothing to do with IQ, education, knowledge, blah, blah..if it was, ...
