I wanted to identify my ideal business opportunity, and try to make a living out of it. And if that didn&amp;rsquo;t work, I was going to look for the 2nd best opportunity, and give that a shot. And so on.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The idea was to do things in series until something worked. This sounded very reasonable at the time, but that feeling didn&amp;rsquo;t last long.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>High vs low predictability businesses</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;There are two distinct types of business activities:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;One where achieving success is highly accessible and predictable (accountant, plumber, dentist).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The other where success is dominated by chance, good timing, and randomness (musician, author, startup founder, youtuber).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you want to pursue unpredictable businesses, you canâ€™t treat them as a regular job. What works at your regular workplace doesn&amp;rsquo;t work in a world where randomness dominates in what makes it and what doesn&amp;rsquo;t. You need to unlearn almost everything and work differently. Instead of:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>On FIRE movement</title>

Almost everyone I know who retired after a grueling career went into retirement unprepared, and their life went downhill fast. The &amp;lsquo;Always Be Compounding&amp;rsquo; attitude during the deferring phase gets in the way of exercising the muscle that leads to discovering what we truly like and dislike.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
