      <title>Poverty</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Poverty used to mean absolute lack of basic necessities - food, clothing, shelter, healthcare, goods. Today they are available but the poor have to incur debt to consume them because they are not part of the value chain of production, i.e they don&amp;rsquo;t derive income from production.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This problem of poverty as the &amp;ldquo;inability to be part of the value chain of production&amp;rdquo; rather than as the &amp;ldquo;absolute unavailability of basics&amp;rdquo; is global in scope and occurs in developed countries too. It is spreading everywhere. That is the essence of the rise of inequality.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Rat race</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;(Source: https://threader. app/thread/1349171803357212672)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One of the psychological and spiritual effects of concentration of talent (which is what large scale urbanization ultimately is about) is the &amp;ldquo;rat race&amp;rdquo;. Large urban areas don&amp;rsquo;t give us space - the sheer physical room, and young children acutely perceive that lack of space. If you are talented and caught in that rat race, moving to a smaller community may cure it.  You will simply stop caring about many of the &amp;ldquo;prestige traps&amp;rdquo; that afflict our minds - what brands of clothes, shoes, phones, cars and so on and on.  That is profoundly liberating!&lt;/p&gt;</description>
