title = "Poverty"

Poverty used to mean absolute lack of basic necessities - food, clothing, shelter, healthcare, goods. Today they are available but the poor have to incur debt to consume them because they are not part of the value chain of production, i.e they don't derive income from production.

This problem of poverty as the "inability to be part of the value chain of production" rather than as the "absolute unavailability of basics" is global in scope and occurs in developed countries too. It is spreading everywhere. That is the essence of the rise of inequality.
