From GangFit 3 by Mark Baker/ GuruAnaerobic:

## State of freedom
### Trading freedom for money
There are 2 types of individual who trade freedom for money.

1 The employed (millions of these). They spend all their weekdays working for money. They earn money so they can pay bills and feel free at the weekend  
2 The individual who is never satisfied - they want more money. The business owner/megarich, entrepreneur, wanker, etc. They are boring show-offs and even more boring company; they only talk about making money. Men like this surround themselves with plastic women and sports cars. Women like this are childless, depressed, and drink too much wine.


### Trading money for freedom
There are 3 types of individual who trade money for freedom:
1 The hobo/tramp/homeless/drop-out (take out the drug addict, those with mental problems). This life is tough - the heroically naïve Chris McCandless ended up dying in a bus in Alaska  
2 The purposely unemployed, on welfare (gainfully or ungainfully)  
3 Those who work just enough to spend the majority of time doing what they like (selfemployed/part-time employee/entrepreneur/creator, etc.)  

### No Money vs freedom tradeoff 
There are 4 types of individual where money vs freedom is irrelevant.  
1 The individual who has investments, passive income, a business run by others, an automated income stream, etc, Anything which brings in money with minimal time involved. Money flows into their pockets whatever they are doing  
2 Someone who has sold a business, made a mint in some way), and no longer needs to work. These people may choose to spend some of their time only on projects/ideas/social enterprises which interests them – more interesting than playing golf until they die (another form of zombiefication)  
3 Professional artisans/writers who love their work. Their idea of freedom is doing their work and being paid for it. Work and freedom are the same thing  
4 The landed, gentry, aristocrat; those with inherited wealth/assets; and rich kids'. The aristos conserve and pass on their wealth to the next generation (as is their duty), the rich kids blow it on parties, drugs - then start a fashion chain or similar, which usually fails.  

## Freedom >Money
It is far better to focus on being free (escaping entrapment) than having money. The average numbskull response, “Stupid advice. You can't be free without money!” Of course, numbskull – freedom with no money isn't freedom, it’s mostly hell. Concentrating on true freedom (in today's society) necessitates being hyper-concerned with money, but not allowing money to enslave you. In fact you have to be almost paranoid about money (but not in the way an employed person is paranoid about it) because you understand that the right sort of money, how it flows to you, how it's created, has the power to transform your life and allow you to permanently escape the rat race. 

### Gangfit goals
Gang Fit chooses the freedom route over the money route but doesn't want starvation or deprivation to come with the freedom, even though it is prepared to risk those in the pursuit of freedom.  
First note: It may come with it for a while, but don't be a fucking weakling - being scared of having no money keeps millions of zombies at work.   
Second note: You won't realise that suffering is good for you whilst you're in it; only later on when you look back on it. It's deep, very deep - possibly the deepest part of having achieved something; that you went through immense suffering.  
Maybe Gang Fit is wrong; it's possible that suffering is a vital part of growth. The forging of the warrior mind and a full wallet.

#### Education
Read 'A Millionaire at $500 Per Week’ later in Gang Fit about this - you'll see that anyone who is motivated and has a brain bigger than walnut can achieve the former. Why don't parents tell their kids? Why doesn't school teach it? They say that school prepares kids for life. Improves their chances” – what does that even mean? Being free (not trapped) and having no problems is the best fucking thing to happen to anybody, they should be teaching that at school. Brainwashed kids have been brainwashed by adults who themselves have been brainwashed.

... The majority of people in your street are not free. You are literally surrounded by zombies; people who traded freedom (their time) for money, They are so mentally undeveloped they don't even know it. Yet they are not idiots in the low IQ, dribbling, retarded, butt-ugly face sort of way. Being free has nothing to do with IQ, education, knowledge, blah, blah..if it was, ...

### Non-goals
What keeps people trapped at work or in their business is they think they need enough money so they can have whatever they want in life – a nice house, a supercar, yacht, international travel, and other clichés. That isn't the right way to think; if you believe it, it will become the manacles around your ankles. Don't be just another fool who has been taken in by the marketing of what a “good life” means. 

### Freedom first
The first and most important step into the land of your childhood dreams is to have enough money so you don't have to do anything you don't want to do. It is far easier to do the latter than the former. If you have expensive tastes (and ambitions) the first may take $10million, the second only $500 per week. If your outgoings are low you could be free from slavery forever for only $300 per week.

The thing which makes people most miserable is spending their days doing stuff they don't want to do. Can you imagine that? Being born so you can spend 45 years of your working life trapped in something you hate, bored out of your brain but convincing yourself it's necessary?...

If you have more free time because you are not doing the 9 to 5 you have more opportunity to research and start things which make you more money. So your first aim is to be free from employment, then create your empire. Whoever heard of a slave creating an empire? 

Money should make you free - that's the whole f**king point of having it. It shouldn't make you a slave. Wanting a gold watch and a supercar before you are free means you'll be a slave forever.

## Degrees of freedom
2 types of freedom (which don't involve suffering, living on nothing: i.e Chris McCandless Syndrome)

- The freedom to not have to do anything you don't want to do  
- As above, but with the additional freedom to do whatever you feel like doing, whenever you feel like doing it.
