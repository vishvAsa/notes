To facilitate and encourage saving for large expenses in the future, governments often provide tax breaks for special investment accounts for retirement, medical expenses and children’s education (college funds).

## Taxation-deferred funds

Incomes earned using these special accounts are exempt from taxes while they stay within the fund. However, withdrawals, which are only under very restricted circumstances, are taxed.

Eg: Individual Retirement Account \[IRA\] in USA.

## Profit-tax free funds

Money may be taxed at the time it is deposited in the fund, while withdrawals are tax-free. This may be relatively advantageous because higher incomes usually attract a higher tax rate.

Examples:
- Roth IRA in USA - no capital gains tax.
- Various life insurance funds in India. (Unlike ELSS, they don't attract long term gains tax as of 2018.)

### PPF in India
- government managed with rate of interest determined by them (2019: 7.9)
- Contribution limits annual (2019):  Rs 500 to Rs 1.5 lakh, max 12 investments 
- special legal protection which cannot be attached by any Indian court

#### Withdrawals
- After 5 years, before 15 years - premature closure : 1% penalty.
- allowed partial withdrawal (<50%) from the 7th financial year and the amount of withdrawal is also tax-free. 

#### Maturity
A PPF subscriber can extend their PPF account after 15 years of maturity period. but, in order to do so, one has to submit Form H within one year of the PPF account maturity. One can extend the PPF account beyond 15 years in 5 years' block, which means no more than 5-year extension can be done at one time.
