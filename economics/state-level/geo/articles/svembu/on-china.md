China has built far more housing and infrastructure than needed and far more factories than needed for her own consumption. China has overworked her people & as a result has destroyed her demographics. 

India needs more factories, housing & infrastructure but needs balance. India must aim for balance between imports and exports and there is no sense trying to become the "factory for the world" like China. We also must spend time nurturing our families, our cultural and civilizational roots. Development does not have to mean losing ourselves. 🙏
