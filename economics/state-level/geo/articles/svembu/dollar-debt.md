title = "Dollar debt"

Dollar strength is almost entirely due to the level of dollar-denominated debt in the global financial system, much of it not involving US entities nor under Fed regulation.

The world is being strangled by designating so much of its debt in "dollars", as Fed dollars get scarce.. That also explains why countries with massive trade surpluses are seeing their currencies plunge against the dollar. Dollar-denominated debt vastly exceeds trade flows because trade surpluses become dollar-reserves and the reserves then get multiplied into dollar liabilities.
