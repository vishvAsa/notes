      <description>&lt;p&gt;(Source: &lt;a href=&#34;https://threader.app/thread/1452847643164504066&#34;&gt;https://threader.app/thread/1452847643164504066&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For years I’ve been arguing (against most analysts focusing on China, I should add) that much of the GDP “growth” generated by Chinese investment in property and infrastructure should not be considered part of China’s GDP on a basis comparable to that of other countries.

In early Victorian England, the best way to get into influential posts in government was through patronage and &amp;ldquo;knowing the right people&amp;rdquo; Not through competitive exams at all. This is evident both in literature and in memoirs of the period. Anthony Trollope the great author who was hired by the British Post Office in 1834 wrote about his &amp;ldquo;selection&amp;rdquo;:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The problem with the “there will always be an elite so why not us?” logic is that it refers to natural laws of history what were actually the results of hours of labor.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The WASP Establishment was born of two groups intermingling:&lt;/p&gt;</description>
