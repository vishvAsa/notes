      <description>Economies generally keep cycling through periods of booms and busts (described below). This is due to heuristic way in which demand and supply are balanced.

During this time, the industries’ economic value - or at least their evaluation by the securities market- grows.</description>

      <description>GDP growth usually requires investment in business enterprise. But, investments may have returns either in the short-term or in the long-term. Investment which responds to consumer demand yields immediate benefits, and is often favored.

Consumer demand and public debt Individuals borrow money, and they have to repay them.</description>

If the country where the disaster occurs is advanced - like Japan or USA, effect on the GDP may not even be noticeable both in the short and the long term.</description>
