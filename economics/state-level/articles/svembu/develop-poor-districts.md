Here is the kind of problem I often think about: Take a very poor district in India. What does it take for it to become one of the rich places in the world? How does per capita GDP go from $1K to $25K-50K? What is "catch up"? How long would it take? 

It comes down to having skills and know-how in the workforce and developing those skills require employers who will invest in that workforce to develop those skills and know-how. So going from $1K to $25K is the process of employers and the workforce advancing together. Employers and workforce advancing together to develop skills and know-how needs commitment to the cause, discipline to stay the course, curiosity to learn new things and ultimately the faith that it can be done. We have to find these within ourselves. An inner journey first.

The good news is that the time to catch up has been shrinking. I believe it can be done in about 15-20 years today and it used to take 30-50 years. Why? Technologies have widely diffused. Second, new fundamental breakthroughs are slowing and that allows faster catch up.
