Risks to the global trading system. The US Fed is trapped between two contradictory objectives:

- a) keep the sputtering globalization model alive
- b) save American society from even more division and conflict

a) Globalization demands the US Fed has to serve the bottomless demand for dollar funds in the "offshore" market or the so-called Eurodollar market as @JeffSnider_AIP has explained before.

b) serving the needs of people who lost jobs and poor communities needs domestic funds. 

The US Fed's attempt to save globalization only causes even more extreme division and conflict within American society. In that sense, the Fed has already lost all control of monetary policy. The only logical end game is the end of the USD driven global trade system. Can this extremely broken system continue for another decade? I am skeptical.It is in the self-interest of the US itself to gently transition out of the dollar based reserve currency and global trading system. It can help by de-dollarizing the debt of developing countries. 

What would come after the present dollar based system collapses due to the fundamental contradiction faced by the Fed? A gold based global settlement system is my preference, one that avoids countries getting into excessive debt with each other. End to vendor financed trade!
