Inflation from 2000 to 2022

Gold price: 8.4% per year  
Money supply growth: 6.8% per year  
Oil price: 4.7% per year  
Median house: 4.6% per year  
Education: 4.6% per year  
Medical services: 3.4% per year  
CPI+++(=consumer price index)+++: 2.6% per year  
Deposit yields: <2%  
Apparel: flat  
Electronics, software: down   

As @saylor would say, inflation is a vector.

The price of scarce things tend to go up more in line with money supply growth, while tech and offshoring make other things radically abundant, which pulls the CPI calculation down.

If something compounds by 4.6% per year, then after 23 years the price is 2.8x what it was at the start of the period. Thatâ€™s pretty big.

I think medical services and education on this particular list are understated, tho. Hospital services in particular are way higher.
