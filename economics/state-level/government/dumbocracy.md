Here we examine problems of democracy and briefly consider alternative systems of government

## Problems
- The "one person one vote" paradigm prominent in democracies rests on an unnatural, false assumption: That all men are equal in their abilities and judgement.
- Politicians compete for attention and approval of masses (who in heterogeneous countries like India tend to be bottom heavy - ie dominated by incompetents). So, their legislative goals and administration becomes flawed.
    - "As ordinary citizens are encouraged to take part in the political life of the country, they have the power to directly influence the outcome of government policies through the democratic procedures of voting, campaigning and the use of press. The result is that government policies may be more influenced by non-specialist opinions and thereby the effectiveness compromised."
    - Politicians spend far more time gathering money for reelection (not to mention their own retirement) than on sincere government. [US2019](https://bulletin.represent.us/much-time-congress-members-spend-fundraising/)
- Political instability
    - this hinders general progress and business (which prefer stable guidelines)
    - This is exploited by our national and civilizational enemies.
- Short-termism
- Susceptibility to intolerant demographically growing communities (eg. fanatical Muslims and Christians). This leads to the destruction of national ethos over generations.
- Susceptibility to propaganda by manipulation of public opinion and opposition (see [subversion](../subversion/) page)
- Corruption
- Relatively more inefficient and harder to pivot.
    - Almost no truly effective organization is a democracy (esp. in our society). No company (let alone successful ones) is a democracy. No military is run democratically. Same with ISRO or police or administrative cadres.

## General assessments
- DV Gundappa in his "maisUru divAnaru" part of "jNApaka-chitra-shAle": [audio-1.5x p1](https://archive.org/details/dvg-jnapaka-chitra-shaale-maisUrina-dIvAnaru-1.5x/24_Upasamhara_p1.mp3), [p2](https://archive.org/details/dvg-jnapaka-chitra-shaale-maisUrina-dIvAnaru-1.5x/25_Rashtra_Samasthithiya_Mulasuthra_p1.mp3).
- "Machiavelli put the idea that democracies will tend to cater to the whims of the people,  who follow false ideas to entertain themselves, squander their reserves, and do not deal with potential threats to their rule until it is far too late."

## Monarcy + aristocracy
### Ideals
- Plato argues that only Kallipolis, an aristocracy led by the unwilling philosopher-kings (the wisest men), is a just form of government.

### Risks
- Top down enforcement of monotheism on pagan socieities
  - Example
    - Akhenaten's Atenism (Egyptians returned to polytheism.)
    - Constantine and successors in Rome. (Julian repaganized - but christians returned after his death.)
    - Vladimir of the Kievan rUs, became Orthodox Christian for alliance with Basil.
    - Rinchan of Kashmir.
    - Jogaila of Lithuania, who became Catholic for alliance with Poles.
    - Haakon and Sigurd Haakonsson, Jarls in norway. (His son Haakon Sigurdarson rebelled briefly.)

### Consensus
- Consensus-based (rather than election-based) appointments, successions and leadership choices lead to more harmonious outcomes and organizations which whole-heartedly pivot when necessary. Eg. Japanese companies [hbr article](https://hbr.org/1971/03/what-we-can-learn-from-japanese-management), japanology pages.

### Realizations
- Mysore kingdom under the Wodeyars and their chief ministers (divAns) was one of the best administered states in the world. The chief minister was chosen based on merit from the administrative and engineering services, for a limited term. They tended to be highly effective, sincere, and incorruptible rulers. They were supported by an elected "prajA-pratinidhi-sabhA", who could only make suggestions to the chief minister who could dispense with the recommendations as he thought fit. The state of Karnataka which succeeded it pales in comparison.

## Rigged democracies
- Singapore has a strong de-ghettoisation policy: every electoral constituency is chinese majority; so less voice for malay islamists. The legacy of Lee Kuan Yew stays strong.
- Share-based system: Every citizen living as of today (for example) gets a share in the nation. The total number of shares remains constant over time (just as in a company). Every time he has a child, he/ she forfeits a portion of his share to the child. Once he dies, his shares are divided among his children. So, if the muslim community grows from 10% to 50% in a hundred years, the problem is not as severe: they will continue to have only 10% share in the national political power.

## Vote buying
- George Washington was getting voters drunk to vote for him all the way back in 1758

## Sick rhetoric
> Adams frequently called Hamilton a “bastard brat” & made fun of him for being poor.  
Hamilton called Adams fat and small.  
Pro Jefferson papers called Adams “hermaphrodital”.  
The Adams campaign responded that Jefferson was born of a “half-breed Indian squaw” & labeled Jefferson the pro-incest candidate.   
Charles Lee publicly accused Washington of trying to assassinate him.  
Newspapers called Andrew Jackson’s mom a prostitute.  
Jackson openly regretted not having shot Henry Clay or hanged John Calhoun.
