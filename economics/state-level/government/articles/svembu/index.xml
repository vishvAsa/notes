      <description>&lt;p&gt;Some population data.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Chennai: 5 million (1990) to 11.5.million (2022)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Bengaluru: 4 million (1990) to 13 million (2022)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Singapore has only 6 million people in total.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Over 30 years, Chennai added 6.5 million people, Bengaluru added 9 million.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;How can infrastructure keep up?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There is a subtle mathematical issues with scaling of urban population that is important to understand. &lt;em&gt;Infrastructure per capita&lt;/em&gt; has to go up and that means tax as a percentage of GDP has to go up to support large urban infrastructure. Our political system is unable to do it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Politics</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As a boy, I considered politics in my future. I am not in that camp that fashionably considers politics as &amp;ldquo;dirty&amp;rdquo;. In fact, politics is the only way a society resolves important social questions peacefully. The alternative is to resolve them not-peacefully, i.e, war. I had not considered business at all as a path until much later. No one who knew me in boyhood and as a young adult would remotely consider me &amp;ldquo;savvy&amp;rdquo; enough to be in business. My mother would not trust me to go to the store to buy anything (even now she doesn&amp;rsquo;t ðŸ˜‚).&lt;/p&gt;</description>
