title = "Bad appointments"
+++

I'm trying to think of historical examples of appointments to important positions that were as deeply, wildly, ball-breakingly stupid as that of RFK Jr. to HHS.

Some that come to mind:

1. Trofim Lysenko's appointment to lead Soviet Agricultural science

2. when Carter appointed Theodore Sorensen a conscientious objector in World War II (!!!) as head of the CIA.
