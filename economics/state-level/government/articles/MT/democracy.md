While I don't have a democracy fetish, I agree that if reasonably operational it at least gives an opportunity for course correction. The pa~nchanetraka confederation has ensured that democracy is fraught with danger for most nations other than its members +++(via "revolutions")+++. An exception is Japan, with a large homoethnic population. 

Those like India with a wider ethnic spectrum are more vulnerable to mlechCha attacks. But it does seem things have changed. 

Today, we believe that despite their self-congratulatory indices, their democracies have developed serious flaws (unless they are largely homoethnic small states). Against this backdrop an objective observer will realize that India today has a superior democracy than most occidental potentates. However, the machinations of the latter, directly, or through their marUnmatta allies, means this might not be for long.
