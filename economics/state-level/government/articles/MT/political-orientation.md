Political orientation is something that rises from deep within; as we have noted before, it has a biological basis. There might be some truth to its relationship with polymorphism in odorant receptors.+++(4)+++ 

There is something like reaching your "preferred station" -- an equilibrium. Some people reach that point early in life (that was my case). However, due to environment, others might not immediately do so. The journey to the fixed point might be a gradual spiral or through chaotic fluctuations. Many go through chaos in the 20s/30s but in small number it may take them till their 50s to get to their home. Yet they all converge. 

Because of chaos in the 20s/30s that several experience, their friends/fellow travelers might express regret or frustration over their "sudden change".+++(5)+++ In reality, they are simply finding their home. 

A careful observation on this SM can, however usually reveal a person's true home, even if they are fluctuating through a range of outward expressions. A student of H politics interested in making predictions regarding H future performance should make note of this. 

So far things are keeping with the historical trajectory of the H. The premise is that if political orientation is coming from deep within, it could be determinant of the historical trajectory.+++(4)+++ This would amount to how H have reacted to the non-self & what has factors determined how they drew boundaries. Some of it would be deeply discomforting.

However, this is often hard to discern at the micro-level for the movement towards ones political fixed point is idiosyncratic, often accelerated by life experiences with the non-self.
