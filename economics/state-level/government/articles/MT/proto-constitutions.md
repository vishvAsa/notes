One aside: It is important for H history writers when writing their own history to pay careful attention to the development of the unified Arya states of the vaidika age starting from the ones on the steppe to those in northern India. The roots of the H nation lie therein with the way the internal rivalries were handled & the conception of the ever-expanding Arya horizon was developed. The emergence of a new constitution in India in form of the much malign puruShasUkta build off an old IE foundation & the accommodation of the niShada-sthapati-s finally culminating in the grand constitution which is give  via the mouth of the pitAmaha of the kuru-s. The path to this lies in the various discussion in the shruti, such as that discussed in the RT, that give the pramANa for the H state.
