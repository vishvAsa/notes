+++

Public servants and those who otherwise depend on public funding fall into unethical practices like accepting bribes, lying, delay and coercion because their seniors compel them to do so - either explicitly or unwittingly as a result of the unrealistic or wrong expectations, or because of a desire for personal profit, or for job security.

## Bad expectations

For example, during the Chinese famine, officials presented Mao with fake fields and yields during his inspections. NYPD cops, whose anti-crime activity was being tracked using statistics, registered fewer cases, and were coerced into unnecessary pat-downs, tickets and arrests.
