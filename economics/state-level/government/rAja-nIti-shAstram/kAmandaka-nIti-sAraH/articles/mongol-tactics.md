Re-reading Nitisara after learning of the Mongols brings new insights to us.

We find Kamandaka employing para-mongolic tactics like displaying bodies to terrorize people; Subutei-style feigned retreats; use of "bad" people as arrow-fodder; purposefully losing battles to let enemies get back to their camps & attack them later; use of catapults and mortar machines in non-siege warfare; emptying of markets, villages and cities before plundering them etc etc.. 

There is also a frequent mention of encircling enemy troops after scattering them. While this appears common sense on face, it reminds us of the Mongol Nerge, their traditional hunting style later used in war.

Thus, we wonder if Kamandaka lived close to the times of Alkhans & learned these from them. Or perhaps we're carrying too much inertia from reading about them.
