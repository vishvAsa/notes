Two of Kautilya's work were present in 11thC Spain: The andalusian jurist al-Turtushi refers to one Muntakhab-ul-Jawahir as guide for Kings, composed by one Shanaq, undoubedly Kautilya; and also refers to his Canakya-Niti by the name Kitab Shanaq fi al-Tadbir.

> "A very comprehensive Arabic Mirror for Princes entitled Siraj-ul-Mulk was compiled in 1122 by Abu Bakr Muhammad bin al-Walid al-Turtushi (1059– 1127), who was born in Spain and had visited Iran and Iraq. Here he met the Seljuq vizier Nizam-ul-Mulk Tusi (1018-92) and was greatly impressed by Tusi's scholarship and political acumen. Even the earlier Mirror for Princes had drawn upon stories in Kalila wa Dimna, as translated from Pahlavi (old Persian) by Ibn-ul-Muqaffa (died 756). Turtushi's work also shows a definite debt to the same source, Kalila wa Dimna. He also refers to Muntakhab-ul-Jawahir (Selected Gems) composed by the Indian Shanaq (Chanakya) as a guide for the monarch. This text, the Kitab Shanaq fi al-Tadbir, was in fact the celebrated Chanakya- Niti, a collection of political aphorisms in Sanskrit, not to be confused with the Arthashastra ascribed to Kautilya or Chanakya”.

Suleyman held a copy of Pancatantra in his library, al-Turtushi seems to have Canakyaniti directly along with another treatise which might be Subhashita.

Wrt Pancatantra, Moriz Winternitz was astute in his assertion that it was the most far travelled book after the Bible.
