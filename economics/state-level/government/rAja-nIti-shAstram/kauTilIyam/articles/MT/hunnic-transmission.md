The kharoShThI arthashAstra digest manuscript collected in TSP by Nassim Khan & described by Strauch with possible relationship to the chAkShushIya arthashAstra indicates how the tradition might have been transmitted to central Asia by the kuShANa-s; the said document was likely composed in the kuShAna empire & buried at an old shrine/college in what's today "Khyber Pakhtunkhwa". 

However, we should mention that the central Asia connection was already there even in the kauTilIya text which mentions sAmUra pelts -- sable pelt (?) which steppe Iranians use.

Sternbach also recovered several maxims of chANakya from C.Asian fragments in Qara Khitai/Uighur domains; As an aside, the Jewish indologist Sternbach used the correct term Greater India, unlike denialist terms South Asia etc of other white indologists.

There is a Mongol manuscript known as the subhAShita-ratnanidhi with arthashAstra maxims in a later Chingizid era script. Sternbach also noticed survivals of these maxims among the Kalmykian Oirat Mongols.
