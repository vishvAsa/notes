The man who did the most damage to American industry was Jack Welch, as the CEO of GE. The Boeing engineering disaster had roots in Welch's deeply flawed management doctrines which were spread across American industry by his acolytes. This has to be understood in India too.

He sacrificed sound engineering at the altar of finance and created debt fueled phantom profits at GE Capital that nearly destroyed GE during the Great Financial Crisis. He destroyed morale, culture and loyalty at GE with his brutal layoffs-as-strategy and took pride in it.

The fact that he was the most celebrated CEO in his time tells you how bad philosophy could cause so much damage. Corporate America is still recovering from Jack Welch. Corporate India would be wise to re-examine the unexamined subconscious ideas we have imbibed from him.
