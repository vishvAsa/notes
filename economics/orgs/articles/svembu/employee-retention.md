title = "Employee retention"
+++

Startup founders often ask me about how to reduce employee attrition. At Zoho, I ask our managers "What have we done to deserve the loyalty and commitment of our employees?" This reverses the question from "why do people leave us" to "why should they stay with us?"+++(5)+++

When we truly internalize the question "what have I done to deserve loyalty and commitment" everything changes. We stop worrying about people leaving. Instead we start to feel profound gratitude for people who choose to stay with us and we don't ever take them for granted.+++(5)+++ That's important. In too many organizations, the committed and loyal employees are taken for granted. It often feels the company has no gratitude. Expressing gratitude in a variety of ways is a very important part of asking "what have we done to deserve commitment". üôè
