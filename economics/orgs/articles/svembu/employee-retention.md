title = "Employee retention"
+++

Startup founders often ask me about how to reduce employee attrition. At Zoho, I ask our managers "What have we done to deserve the loyalty and commitment of our employees?" This reverses the question from "why do people leave us" to "why should they stay with us?"+++(5)+++

When we truly internalize the question "what have I done to deserve loyalty and commitment" everything changes. We stop worrying about people leaving. Instead we start to feel profound gratitude for people who choose to stay with us and we don't ever take them for granted.+++(5)+++ That's important. In too many organizations, the committed and loyal employees are taken for granted. It often feels the company has no gratitude. Expressing gratitude in a variety of ways is a very important part of asking "what have we done to deserve commitment". üôè

## Attracting talent
(Source: https://threader.app/thread/1361066220695543809)

The most important factor in the success of any project or initiative is "do we have passionate, committed and talented people who will put their heart and soul into it and want it to succeed?" You cannot find such people. You have to let them find you.  

We cannot scale an initiative or the company faster than the rate at which we attract such people.So how do we attract and retain people like this? I humbly submit that understanding why people volunteer to do selfless service to others would be a good way to start. So for example, understanding how @SadhguruJV or @Amritanandamayi attract a passionate group of volunteers will teach us more about attracting people to an initiative than all the HR manuals in the world.I consider myself only a humble student of this process.üôè
