We tend to think only in terms of "what disadvantages to poor rural areas have".  As an optimist, I look at the advantages instead.  To be an entrepreneur requires you to be an optimist and have a kind of faith that can only be termed religious. Let me list the advantages. 2

The biggest advantage is the availability of people who are willing and eager for an opportunity and are grateful to anyone who extend it.+++(5)+++  Entrepreneurship is primarily about creating that opportunity, serving the unserved.  That is deeply satisfying and is also sustainable.

The second big advantage is the availability of land at fairly low cost and as a result low rents.  Almost every project - a school, a product development centre, a factory, a clinic - needs land and buildings and that cost often dominates the cost of a project in urban areas. 

Finally, space! Once you get used to a lot of open space, it is hard to not want it! Young children absolutely love open space and they teach us something. Space also gives a feeling of possibility.  This has been an early motivation for me.
