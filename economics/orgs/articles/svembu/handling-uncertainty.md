In building any know-how intensive product, you face an essential uncertainty in project schedule and cost. Know-how intensive product, new team that has not built the exact product before and precise schedule are an impossible trinity. That drives CFOs and planners crazy! This is a major reason India has lagged behind in know-how intensive industry.

The best of Indian industry is largely driven by a project management discipline that values precise schedules and cost estimates.+++(5)+++ That's normally a good thing. Except when it is not. Knowing when that project management discipline does not apply is wisdom. Even when we know it, applying it in a real world context is hard. "Why are we slipping" comes too readily!+++(5)+++

I use the phrase "embrace uncertainty" instead of "experience certainty" with our teams.4/ "Embrace uncertainty" is a slogan to remind ourselves the essential or irreducible nature of the uncertainty.+++(5)+++ Project managers often try to "derisk" projects and again normally a good instinct. The trouble is we cannot derisk essential uncertainty!

So how do we manage it? To manage the "embrace uncertainty" style project, the leadership needs strong trust in a team and the team has to trust that the leadership backs them strongly. The team has to respect that the leadership knows and understands the technology challenges involved. The mutual trust and respect between leadership and the project team is a non-negotiable requirement to "embrace uncertainty" together. Once we have that established, we use the sophisticated project management approach known as "crossing the river by feeling the stones".+++(5)+++ "Crossing the river by feeling the stones" is a very apt description because it conveys the tentative plodding progress you make in such "experience uncertainty" ( know-how intensive) projects. We celebrate small successes.+++(5)+++ We celebrate major milestones. We endure setbacks. 

I will conclude with a concrete example.Right now, in real time, that is how Zoho Meeting is making progress, ploddingly, one tentative step at a time.The team knows I stand with them. I review the details of the technology. We celebrate small successes. We will do it! üôè
