If an R&D project ever goes smoothly according to a schedule, by definition it is not an R&D project! Such projects are characterized by "unknown unknowns", things we don't know that we don't know. We have to find ways to deal with that essential, irreducible uncertainty.

My definition of R&D here is not just fundamental scientific or technological breakthroughs. It includes doing things a particular team has not done and has no access to people who have done it before. A lot of advanced industrial know how is in that category for India. A new industry coming up in a rural area, where no one with previous expertise will move, has to accept the task of figuring many things out on their own, supplemented by online learning. I call that the "Eklayvya Strategy" and the Dronacharya here is the online learning.

One thing such projects cannot burden themselves with is a firm schedule. When I start a new initiative, with a lot of unknown unknowns, I don't set a schedule. Instead we seek to achieve and celebrate small milestones and victories. It is a voyage of self-discovery. üôè
