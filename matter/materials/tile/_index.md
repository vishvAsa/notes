## Choice parameters
- Outside, water becomes a very important factor in cold climates, since only a small amount of moisture can freeze in winter months and crack the tile. So, water absorption, measured in percentage is considered.
- Temperature feel
  - Some floors feel very cold. Eg. Marble floors, cement.
- Parking tiles: consider modulus of rupture. Crazing (cracking) resistence. Scratch hardness.
- Resistence to staining, household chemicals.
- Color and pattern retention
- Surface smoothness and finish. Antislip tiles have tiny dot protrusions.
- Surface flatness. Deviation in rectangularity (Less gaps in joins).
- Tile size. Larger tiles mean fewer joints. Better appearence. But potentially weaker (unless made thicker).
  - It is difficult to maintain grout lines. While the tiles themselves are low-maintenance, the grout lines require sealing to avoid moisture and mildew seeping in.

## Natural stone.
- Granite: Sadarahalli
- Beetham Cherla from AP
- Tandoor from AP

## Cement tiles
### Attangudi tiles
- Great patterns. Mud,cement and oxide.
- tested and proved for hundred years in Chettinad region mansions
- Small cracks may develop if not laid well. May fade and become whitish.
