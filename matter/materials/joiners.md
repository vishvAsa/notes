## Joiners
- Cabinet hinges
  - INR 35 per peice.
  - can open without needing clearance to the side.
- L clamp
  - 2 inch - Rs 2 per piece on IndiaMart; retails 10 / piece

## Screws
- Avoid minus / flathead screws - prone to slippage during operation. Star (Phillips) scews better, hex-star and square hole screws even better.
- Woodworking screws have a tapered head - so head does not stick out.
- self-threading screws for steel - 3Rs per peice (2021)

## Welding tools
- Rods - 1 pack - 280 Rs (2021)

## Soldering
- 60% tin and 40% lead solder, ~ Sn37Pb will become liquid at 183 degrees C
- Lead substitutes
  - bismuth is in short supply since it’s a by-product of lead mining. Silver, on the other hand, is in adequate supply but has a cost disadvantage. Zinc is also in good supply but oxidizes easily and can result in brittle solders.
- lead-free solder (Sn99 Ag0.3 Cu0.7, SAC387 = Sn95.5Ag3.8Cu0.7) melts at about 217 degrees C (419F). 
  - stronger.  
  - lead-free solders don’t spread at any point during reflow. Less likely to have voids.
- Sn0.7Cu  Melting point 227 deg C.

### Flux
removes any oxidized metal from the surfaces to be soldered, seals out air thus preventing further oxidation, and by facilitating amalgamation, improves wetting characteristics of the liquid solder,

Resin/ rosin fluxes are popular. Oft integrated into the core of the solder wire.

## Stapler
- Kangaro is an Indian manufacturer.
- Kangaro Stapler HD 23S24 is heavy duty. Good for binding books.
- Gun tackers staple into wood!

## Staple pins
Size - 23mm/6mm (H=height)
