#### Diamond blades 
- have diamond in the outer circles; which get worn off with use. 
- Bonding material which holds the diamonds have different wear-rates- so can be soft, medium or hard. Generally, softer materials use harder blades, harder materials use softer blades. soft/ medium bond for marble, ceramic.
- Can be continuous, segmented or serrated (turbo). 
  - Cooling helps extend blade life. Blade segment groves, serrations and holes - air flow helps cool the blade.
  - Continuous & serrated cuts are cleaner. Serrated bits force material out of the way as blade rotates. 

#### Usage
Can be used in wet and dry modes (to cool the blade).

### Saw
Descending order of preference
- Alert - blades can break - wear protection!

- Table circle saw

#### Reciprocating saws
- Pendulum Jigsaw with sightline channel (better visibility)
  - Pendulum movement, where the blade goes back and forth as well as up and down, helps go through thick wood pieces more quickly.
- Electric sabre saw
  - Can get cheaper reciprocating saw attachement for drills 
  - Harder to control than jigsaw
- Hand saw
- Hack saw
