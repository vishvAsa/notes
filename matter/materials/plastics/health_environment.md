## Ocean pollution composition
Thermoplastics amount to well over 95% of all plastic found during ocean studies. Polyurethanes, however, account for less than 2% of all waste detected during ocean surveys. Thermoplastics, with their weak inter-strand bonds, produce microplastics.

Synthetic fibres to make up a good share of microplastics found in waters. In fact, itâ€™s been suggested that more than 4,500 fibres can be released per gram of clothing per wash, according to the Plastic Soup Foundation.
