## Categories
- In thermoplastics, no molecular bonds are holding the individual strands of polymer together. Itâ€™s held together by weak ionic forces, called Van Der Waal forces.

## Polypropylene 
- PP Pipes- supposed to be good ([EWG](https://www.ewg.org/healthyhomeguide/plumbing-and-pipes/)), but used for agriculture in India.

## Polyethylene
- Pex (cross-linked polyethylene)- b or a 
- flexible!

### Negatives
- Rodents seem to enjoy chewing on.
- PEX cannot be used outdoors unless it has a UV blocking coating.
- leeches some organics: [EM17](https://www.fondriest.com/news/not-drop-drink-plastic-pipes-leaching-chemicals-drinking-water.htm).

## Polyurethane
- Individual PU strands cross-link with strong bonds (unlike common thermoplastics, where strands are held together by VDW forces).
- UV stability would be an issue with aromatic PU 
- aliphatic ones are slow reacting and expensive
- Polyurethane does not degrade well in evironment - something like 1% top per year

### Environmental impact
Dubious claim - "When polyurethane breaks down in the environment, it will not break down into its individual polymer strands. Instead, individual bonds are broken down between molecules, releasing individual molecules into the environment. These molecules are almost exclusively inert compounds that will not react or accumulate toxicity in natural environments."

## Acrylate polymers
- "they won't survive 100s of years - after a few years light heat and moisture will break them down into component chemicals (rather than microplastics)".

### Acrylic resin
- a thermoplastic or thermosetting plastic substance derived from acrylic acid, methacrylic acid or other related compounds.
- Acrylic resin is considered extremely weatherproof. This makes it ideal for outdoor applications. In solid form acrylic resin can last for decades. It does not yellow when exposed to sunlight, even after many years.

## Poly-vinyl-acetate
- thermoplastic, odourless, tasteless
- Fevicol is a Poly Vinyl Acetate emulsion.

### Biodegradability
- there is no evidence that glue products are found in the environment. In fact, a number of microorganisms like algae, yeast, lichens, and bacteria actually degrade polyvinyl acetate.

## Epoxy
-  a thermosetting polymer made from a monomer that contains at least two epoxide groups. The term epoxy can be used for the cured end product or any of the basic components within epoxy resins.
- Epoxy resins can be homopolymerized or cross-linked into a three dimensional network using curatives. A broad assortment of curatives are available for ambient or thermal-curing and include polyfunctional acids, amines, phenols, thiols, alcohols and anhydrides, and are often known as curing agents or hardeners.
- Uses: Strong glues, some paint, outstanding electrical insulators.

## Lycra/ spandex
- like wetsuits, very elastic. When putting a garment with spandex in the dryer, it tends to dry out and the strands break meaning the garment loses compression power.

## Nylon
- light, tough. 
- Easily melts. 
- Hydrophilic. Degrades (into microplastics and small threadlets) when exposed to rain and sun.
