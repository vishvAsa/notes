## Asian Paints SmartCare Damp Proof Ultra White
- PU hybrid polymers and reinforcing acrylic fibers.
- PU is biodegradable but not acrylic.
- Bridges cracks - provides water proofing (10 yrs guarantee with top coat).
- 10 deg temperature reduction.

## Aerogel based application
- aerogel is basically porous material
- a silicone + polyurethane type material most likely. The latter would be less because  UV stability would be an issue with aromatic PU and aliphatic ones are slow reacting and expensive.
