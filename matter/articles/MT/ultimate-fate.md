Unlike the neutron, which has a half-life of 879 or 888 seconds, the proton will live for at least 10^34 years. If current physics is true and the proton doesn't decay, the universe is believed to ultimately end up a collection of cold iron spheres. It will be so far removed in time that it really means nothing to anything on earth but a strange endpoint for those who seek meaning in conscious existence.

<details><summary>Quantum tunneling fate (द्रष्टुं नोद्यम्)</summary>

Quantum tunneling is a quantum mechanics phenomenon where particles can pass through energy barriers they classically couldn't, with extremely low probability—like a ball rolling through a hill instead of over it.

Stable nuclei seem permanent, but over 10^10^26+ years, tunneling enables rare fusions/fissions, gradually converting all matter to iron-56 (most stable, lowest energy state). No nucleus is truly eternal in an infinite timeline.

In the far future without proton decay, iron-56 nuclei form cold iron stars. Over 10^10^26 to 10^10^76 years, quantum tunneling triggers their collapse into black holes (possibly neutron stars first). These black holes then evaporate via Hawking radiation into subatomic particles over further eons.
