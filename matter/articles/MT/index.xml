      <description>&lt;p&gt;Feynman:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“It [the Fine Structure Constant alpha] has been a mystery ever since it was discovered more than fifty years ago, and all good theoretical physicists put this number up on their wall and worry about it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In classical physics, you can calculate the radius of an electron as a spherical object. In quantum mechanics, you can calculate the average radius of the smallest atom. If an electron is entirely converted to electromagnetic radiation, you can calculate the wavelength of that photon. All these numbers are related to each other by that dimensionless number, the Fine Structure Constant. Thus, the classical, quantum and relativistic realms are connected by it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
