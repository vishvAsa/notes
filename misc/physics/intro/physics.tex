\section{Energy}
Work $w = \int_{a}^{b}fds$ , energy, power. The law of conservation of energy. Potential and keinetic energy. Heat. Escape velocity.

\section{Thermodynamics}
Molecular motion. Thermodynamic equilibrium is an equivalence relation.

Closed thermodynamic system: Change in the internal energy U = (Enthalpy) Heat supplied + work done.

Work/ energy: PV = nRT. Engines: external combustion and internal combustion. PV curve; cyclical processes, Isothermic and adiabatic processes. Area of a cycle: No perfect engine law. Carnot cycle. Refridgeration and compressors. The total entropy of any isolated thermodynamic system tends to increase over time, approaching a maximum value. Definition of Absolute Zero temperature. Boltzmann distribution of energy at temperature T. Heat: Conduction, convection, radiation. Stefan Boltzmann law. Radiation and absorption spectra.

\section{Electricity}
Charge: attraction and repulsion. The inverse square law. Lines of force, flux. Find charge inside a surface: Gauss' law. Electric potential energy; electric potential. Potential contours, electric field. Potential difference and force.

\subsection{Magnetism}
The Hall effect. Magnetic field B as force per unit moving charge: $\textbf{F} = q\textbf{v}\times\textbf{B}$; Relative direction of B. Natural magnets: electric dipoles. Electromagnets. Construction of electric motors and mechanical electricity generators. AC and DC.

\section{Quantum mechanics}
Matter waves. Quanta: Photoelectric effect.

\section{Relativity}
Conservation of energy and mass.

\part{Modelling important situations}
\section{Periodic Motion}
Longitudonal and transverse waves. Frequency, amplitude. Equation for displacement about a point; relationship with circular motion.

\section{Hydrodynamics}
Incompressible fluids. Bernoulli's law relates density, gravity, fluid velocity. Flight of airplanes and helicopters. Buoyancy. Viscosity.

\section{Electric circuits}
Electric current, resistivity, conductance. Resistance in a wire related to resistivity, thickness and length: The molecular view. V=IR. Heat generated by resistance. Kirchoff's law of voltage and current conservation in loops: linear equations solved using linear algebra \cite{strang}. Capacitors. Capacitance: charge stored, potential difference; plate surface area, distance, dipole moment. Electric transmission using earth and a wire.

\section{Electronics}
Semiconductors. Silicon, germanium. Positive and negative doping.

Diodes: The np junction. .5V to .7V barrier. Forward bias. Reverse bias: breakdown after 5V.
