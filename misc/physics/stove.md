## Rocket stove
- Good YT explanation [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TmWvLyaGdk).
- Types: L and J shapes.

### Key principles
- Chimney effect - height of the chimney is directly proportional to the pressure with which cold air gets sucked in. One leaves generous space to suck in air from under the mesh which holds the wood fuel sticks.
  - Must clean up ash buildup at the bottom so as to not block air. 
- Efficient, limited combustion: Only a small part of the wood ever burns - very efficiently at that, at high temperature.
  - One needs to keep pushing the wood in - with hand or with gravity to keep the stove burning.
  - Combustion, air-sucking and cooking efficiency keeps increasing with temperature increase. So, the stove body is ideally well insulated.
