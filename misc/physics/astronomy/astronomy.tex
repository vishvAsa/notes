\chapter{Star patterns}
Over the lifetime of a person, stars (excluding the sun), despite their high speeds relative to earth, appear stationary - fixed points in the sky.

\section{Constellations}
Aka maNDala by hindu-s. Constellations are patterns of stars which aid in describing locations of various celestial objects. They are associated with colorful tales which motivated the ancients of various cultures.

Various stars in a constellation are often identified with greek letters - like apha centauri, alpha virginis.

\subsection{Zodiac}
Aka rAshi by hindu-s. This is a series of 12 constellations (one for each month, roughly) which form a band in the sky, through which visible objects of the solar system (saura-maNDala) wander. This is a result of the thin shape of the solar system. Each of these occupies roughly 30 degrees of the 360 degree band.

\subsubsection{nakShatra-s}
Hindu-s divided the zodiac into 27 equal sections, each subdivided into 4 pAda-s (identified by a unique syllable). Each nakShatra naturally falls within one or two rAshi-s, and is associated with 1+ stars (though it may be named after a different maNDala to the north or south of the zodiac belt).

\subsubsection{Astrology}
Aka jyotiShya by hindu-s. Ancients of various cultures hypothesised that the position of planets/ moon/ sun in various rAshi-s have predictive ability. This is rejected within the scientific method due to lack of evidence and the Occam razor.

janma-nakShatra is determined by the position of the moon; while western astrology relies on position of sun to make predictions.

\subsection{Other constellations}
\subsubsection{Catalogue}
\begin{itemize}
\item Orion the hunter with a belt/ prajApati disguised as a stag head (mRRigaShiras) pierced by an arrow.
\subitem Found to the north of the zodiac.
\subitem Ardra or betelguese is a dying red giant star at the top.
\subitem al-nIlam/ soma - second star in the arrow- is blue.
\subitem The arrow points to sirius/ mRRiga-vyAdha at one side and aldebran on the other.

\item Ursa major the big bear/ big dipper/ saptarShi maNDala.
\subitem The second point of light is actually vashiShTha - arundhatI pair, the latter being dimmer. This is actually a 6-stars which include 2 binary star systems.

\item Canis major the hunter's dog. 
\subitem Sirius/ mRRiga-vyAdha who shot prajApati is a very bright star (brightest after the sun), 6 light years away.
\end{itemize}
