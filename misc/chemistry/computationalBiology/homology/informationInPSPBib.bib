	abstract = "Comparative modeling predicts the three-dimensional structure of a given protein sequence (target) based primarily on its alignment to one or more proteins of known structure (templates). The prediction process consists of fold assignment, target-template alignment, model building, and model evaluation. The number of protein sequences that can be modeled and the accuracy of the predictions are increasing steadily because of the growth in the number of known protein structures and because of the improvements in the modeling software. Further advances are necessary in recognizing weak sequence-structure similarities, aligning sequences with structures, modeling of rigid body shifts, distortions, loops and side chains, as well as detecting errors in a model. Despite these problems, it is currently possible to model with useful accuracy significant parts of approximately one third of all known protein sequences. The use of individual comparative models in biology is already rewarding and increasingly widespread. A major new challenge for comparative modeling is the integration of it with the torrents of data from genome sequencing projects as well as from functional and structural genomics. In particular, there is a need to develop an automated, rapid, robust, sensitive, and accurate comparative modeling pipeline applicable to whole genomes. Such large-scale modeling is likely to encourage new kinds of applications for the many resulting models, based on their large number and completeness at the level of the family, organism, or functional network.",

Most of our modeled proteins fall into the comparative or homology modeling (CM) category, and some are fold recognition (FR) targets. The key feature of our structure prediction strategy in CASP6 was an attempt to optimally select structural templates and to make accurate sequence-structure alignments. Template selection was based mainly on consensus results of multiple sequence searches. Likewise, the consensus of multiple alignment variants (or lack of it) was used to initially delineate reliable and unreliable alignment regions. Structure evaluation approaches were then used to identify the correct sequence-structure mapping. Our results suggest that in many cases use of multiple templates is advantageous. Selecting correct alignments even within the context of a three-dimensional structure remains a challenge. Together with more effective energy evaluation methods the simultaneous relaxation/refinement of a ``frozen'' backbone inherited from the template is likely needed to see a clear progress in tackling this problem. Our analysis also suggests that human input has little to contribute to automatic methods in modeling high homology targets. On the other hand, human expertise can be very valuable in modeling distantly related proteins and critical in cases of unexpected evolutionary changes in protein structure.",

	abstract = "MOTIVATION: The level of sequence conservation between related nucleic acids or proteins often varies considerably along the sequence. Both regions with high variability (mutational hot-spots) and regions of almost perfect sequence identity may occur in the same pair of molecules. The reliability of an alignment therefore strongly depends on the level of local sequence similarity. Especially in regions of high variability, many alignments of almost equal quality exist, and the optimal alignment is highly arbitrary. RESULTS: We discuss two approaches which deal with the inherent ambiguity of the alignment problem based on the computation of the partition function over all canonical pairwise alignments. The ensemble of possible alignments can be described by the probabilities P(ij) of a match between position i in the first and position j in the second sequence. Alternatively, we introduce a probabilistic backtracking procedure that generates ensembles of suboptimal alignments with correct statistical weights. A comparison between structure based alignments and large samples of stochastic alignments shows that the ensemble contains correct alignments with significant probabilities even though the optimal alignment deviates significantly from the structural alignment. Ensembles of suboptimal alignments obtained by stochastic backtracking can be used as input to any bioinformatics method based on pairwise alignment in order to gain reliability information not available from a single optimal alignment.

RESULTS: For 38% of the entire genome of Mycoplasma genitalium, sequence similarity to a protein with a known structure can be recognized using a new sequence alignment algorithm. When comparing genomes of M. genitalium and Escherichia coli, > 80% of M. genitalium proteins have a significant sequence similarity to a protein in E. coli and there are > 40 examples that have not been recognized before. For all cases of proteins with significant profile similarities, there are strong analogies in their functions, if the functions of both proteins are known. The results presented here and other recent results strongly support the argument that such proteins are actually homologous. Assuming this homology allows one to make tentative functional assignments for > 50 previously uncharacterized proteins, including such intriguing cases as the putative beta-lactam antibiotic resistance protein in M. gentalium. CONCLUSIONS: Using a new profile-to-profile alignment algorithm, the three-dimensional fold can be predicted for almost 40% of proteins from a genome of the small bacterium M. genitalium, and tentative function can be assigned to almost 80% of the entire genome. Some predictions lead to new insights about known functions or point to hitherto unexpected features of M. genitalium."

	abstract = "Modeling a protein structure based on a homologous structure is a standard method in structural biology today. In this process an alignment of a target protein sequence onto the structure of a template(s) is used as input to a program that constructs a 3D model. It has been shown that the most important factor in this process is the correctness of the alignment and the choice of the best template structure(s), while it is generally believed that there are no major differences between the best modeling programs. Therefore, a large number of studies to benchmark the alignment qualities and the selection process have been performed. However, to our knowledge no large-scale benchmark has been performed to evaluate the programs used to transform the alignment to a 3D model. In this study, a benchmark of six different homology modeling programs-- Modeller, SegMod/ENCAD, SWISS-MODEL, 3D-JIGSAW, nest, and Builder--is presented. The performance of these programs is evaluated using physiochemical correctness and structural similarity to the correct structure. From our analysis it can be concluded that no single modeling program outperform the others in all tests. However, it is quite clear that three modeling programs, Modeller, nest, and SegMod/ ENCAD, perform better than the others. Interestingly, the fastest and oldest modeling program, SegMod/ ENCAD, performs very well, although it was written more than 10 years ago and has not undergone any development since. It can also be observed that none of the homology modeling programs builds side chains as well as a specialized program (SCWRL), and therefore there should be room for improvement.",

	abstract = "We describe a comparative protein modelling method designed to find the most probable structure for a sequence given its alignment with related structures. The three-dimensional (3D) model is obtained by optimally satisfying spatial restraints derived from the alignment and expressed as probability density functions (pdfs) for the features restrained. For example, the probabilities for main-chain conformations of a modelled residue may be restrained by its residue type, main-chain conformation of an equivalent residue in a related protein, and the local similarity between the two sequences. Several such pdfs are obtained from the correlations between structural features in 17 families of homologous proteins which have been aligned on the basis of their 3D structures. The pdfs restrain C alpha-C alpha distances, main-chain N-O distances, main-chain and side-chain dihedral angles. A smoothing procedure is used in the derivation of these relationships to minimize the problem of a sparse database. The 3D model of a protein is obtained by optimization of the molecular pdf such that the model violates the input restraints as little as possible. The molecular pdf is derived as a combination of pdfs restraining individual spatial features of the whole molecule. The optimization procedure is a variable target function method that applies the conjugate gradients algorithm to positions of all non-hydrogen atoms. The method is automated and is illustrated by the modelling of trypsin from two other serine proteinases.",

To ameliorate this problem, we have developed an automated method that optimizes both the alignment and the model implied by it. This task is achieved by a genetic algorithm protocol that starts with a set of initial alignments and then iterates through re-alignment, model building and model assessment to optimize a model assessment score. During this iterative process: (i) new alignments are constructed by application of a number of operators, such as alignment mutations and cross-overs; (ii) comparative models corresponding to these alignments are built by satisfaction of spatial restraints, as implemented in our program MODELLER; (iii) the models are assessed by a variety of criteria, partly depending on an atomic statistical potential. When testing the procedure on a very difficult set of 19 modeling targets sharing only 4-27% sequence identity with their template structures, the average final alignment accuracy increased from 37 to 45% relative to the initial alignment (the alignment accuracy was measured as the percentage of positions in the tested alignment that were identical to the reference structure-based alignment). Correspondingly, the average model accuracy increased from 43 to 54% (the model accuracy was measured as the percentage of the C(alpha) atoms of the model that were within 5 A of the corresponding C(alpha) atoms in the superposed native structure). The present method also compares favorably with two of the most successful previously described methods, PSI-BLAST and SAM. The accuracy of the final models would be increased further if a better method for ranking of the models were available."

These problems become magnified with automatic modelling processes, as there is no human input to correct mistakes. As such we have benchmarked several stand-alone strategies that could be implemented in a workflow for automated high-throughput homology modelling. These include three new sequence-structure alignment programs: 3D-Coffee, Staccato and SAlign, plus five homology modelling programs and their respective loop building methods: Builder, Nest, Modeller, SegMod/ENCAD and Swiss-Model. The SABmark database provided 123 targets with at least five templates from the same SCOP family and sequence identities [\&le;]50%. Results: When using Modeller as the common modelling program, 3D-Coffee outperforms Staccato and SAlign using both multiple templates and the best single template, and across the sequence identity range 2050%. The mean model RMSD generated from 3D-Coffee using multiple templates is 15 and 28% (or using single templates, 3 and 13%) better than those generated by Staccato and Salign, respectively. 3D-Coffee gives equivalent modelling accuracy from multiple and single templates, but Staccato and SAlign are more successful with single templates, their quality deteriorating as additional lower sequence identity templates are added. Evaluating the different homology modelling programs, on average Modeller performs marginally better in overall modelling than the others tested. However, on average Nest produces the best loops with an 8% improvement by mean RMSD compared to the loops generated by Builder. Contact: r.m.jackson@leeds.ac.uk.

To address this issue, we employ a comprehensive benchmark set of 1,489 medium-size proteins that cover the PDB at the level of 35% sequence identity and identify templates by structure alignment. With homologous proteins excluded, we can always find similar folds to native with an average rms deviation (RMSD) from native of 2.5 A with approximately 82% alignment coverage. These template structures often contain a significant number of insertions/deletions. The tasser algorithm was applied to build full-length models, where continuous fragments are excised from the top-scoring templates and reassembled under the guide of an optimized force field, which includes consensus restraints taken from the templates and knowledge-based statistical potentials. For almost all targets (except for 2/1,489), the resultant full-length models have an RMSD to native below 6 A (97% of them below 4 A). On average, the RMSD of full-length models is 2.25 A, with aligned regions improved from 2.5 A to 1.88 A, comparable with the accuracy of low-resolution experimental structures. Furthermore, starting from state-of-the-art structural alignments, we demonstrate a methodology that can consistently bring template-based alignments closer to native. These results are highly suggestive that the protein-folding problem can in principle be solved based on the current PDB library by developing efficient fold recognition algorithms that can recover such initial alignments.",

As structural classifications traditionally act as the gold standard of homology this poses a challenge in benchmarking them. RESULTS: We present a novel approach which allows an accurate benchmark of these methods against the CATH structural classification. We then apply this approach to assess the accuracy of a range of publicly available methods for remote homology detection including several profile-profile methods (COMPASS, HHSearch, PRC) from two perspectives. Firstly in distinguishing homologous domains from non-homologues and secondly in annotating proteomes with structural domain families. PRC is shown to be the best method for distinguishing homologues. We show that SAM is the best practical method for annotating genomes, whilst using COMPASS for the most remote homologues would increase coverage. Finally we introduce a simple approach to increase the sensitivity of remote homologue detection by up to 10%. This is achieved by combining multiple methods with a jury vote.",
