title: Rich vs Poor

---

- Rich countries use unfair trade practices etc.. to suck much more money out of poorer countries than they provide in "aid" - [TheRulesVid1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWSxzjyMNpU). [Fact-sheet](http://therules.org/inequality-video-fact-sheet/) excerpts here:
    
- Richest 200 people have about [$2.7 trillion](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-11-01/the-world-s-200-richest-people.html), which is more than the poorest 3.5 billion people, who have only [$2.2 trillion](http://www.guardian.co.uk/money/2006/dec/06/business.internationalnews_) combined.
- Poor countries: rich countries wealth ratio has been increasing and now stands at about 1:80. From the United Nations Development Program’s 1999 [Human Development Report](http://hdr.undp.org/en/reports/global/hdr1999/).
- The amount of aid that rich countries give to developing countries each year, about $130 billion, comes from the OECD Aid Statistics report.
- The claim that corporations steal more than $900 billion from developing countries each year through tax avoidance comes from a 2012 report from [Global Financial Integrity](http://iff.gfintegrity.org/iff2012/2012report.html).
- The claim that developing countries pay $600 billion each year in debt service comes from the World Bank’s [International Debt Statistics](http://data.worldbank.org/data-catalog/international-debt-statistics) databank.
- The claim that developing countries lose about $500 billion each year as a consequence of trade rules imposed by rich countries (through the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank) comes from Robert Pollin’s 2003 book [Contours of Descent](http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ro8ebd53RX4C&printsec=frontcover&dq=Contours+of+Descent&hl=en&sa=X&ei=qiZvUbfRL6ml0wX-1IHIAg&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q&f=false).
- If we could quantify the value of that land we could have added a huge amount to the $2 trillion stack of cash that the video depicts flowing from poor to rich.
