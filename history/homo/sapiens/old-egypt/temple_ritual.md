## Sanctuary design
"The concept of a main sanctuary for a main deity of a temple with subsidiary sanctuaries for other deities with the main sanctuary being a small, dark chamber & daily rites being done to it at morning, mid-day & evening — paralleling the गर्भगृह-परिवार-नित्यार्चन model of आगम-s. Note that the Egyptian temple is a microcosmic image of creation, with innermost sanctuary of the temple representing the primeval island which emerged out of the primordial ocean & creation of life begun. The temple pillars represent the waves of that primordial ocean." [GA](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1269985785341546496.html)

### Inaguration
Via [GA](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1269985785341546496.html) : Note also the consecration rite the Egyptians had for consecrating new icons of deities. They called it “opening of the mouth”, a rite that was later used in post-mortuary contexts too. But in the temple context, this is the ritual performed with sacred tools to “enliven” the deity at a new temple. Just like our नेत्रोनमीलन where we carefully “open” the eyes of the deity. Our logic is that the mantra-installed deity “sees” us & is thus ritually “alive”. 

Via [GA](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1269985785341546496.html) : What was the Egyptian logic behind the opening of the mouth? They understood the deity primarily in its capacity to receive offerings from worshipers. That’s what made the icon ritually alive. Thus, the mouth was opened with consecrated tools.

Via [GA](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1269985785341546496.html) : A very unique feature of the Egyptian temple is that when the deity becomes ritually alive, the wall paintings become alive too. These wall paintings include the entire series of the daily rites. So, the daily rites are perpetually performed, even if the priests are gone!

## Ritual access
Via [GA](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1269985785341546496.html) : The daily rites for the god of the temple are of course done for the good of all in the kingdom but it was not open for much (if at all) public access. To the ancient Egyptians, it was very clear that the temple was not a place for the congregation of the faithful but the deity’s house on earth. This is very much the idea in Hindu dharma; albeit more generous in terms of public presence at temples. The temple rites are defined as parārtha-for the good of others—but the public need not be at the temple at all.

The priests have to undergo cleansing ceremonies & rites before they can enter the temple. And only the most senior priest can enter the innermost sanctuary.


## utsava-s
Via [GA](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1269985785341546496.html) : The Egyptian goddess Hathor/Het-Heru would annually leave her sacred centre at Dendera (Old name: Iunet) for a 100-mile upstream boat ride to Edfu (Old name: Behdet), where she will get married to Horus/Heru at a great temple there. Reminds one of आगमिक-विवाहोत्सव. 

## Daily ritual
Daily rites were done at morning, mid-day & evening.
