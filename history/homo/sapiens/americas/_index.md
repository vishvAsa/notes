## Demographic fall
### Spanish America
Amerindians were still more than half of the population of Spanish America at the time of Napoleon. Far less than that now. Differences in birth rates & lifespans matter a lot.

Spanish America had 14 million people in Napoleon’s time - 3.2 million criollos (whites, many with Amerindian ancestry), 2 million mixed (mulatos, mestizos, zambos, etc), 8 million Amerindians, & 1 million blacks. All were ruled by 30,000 peninsulares - Spaniards born in Spain.
