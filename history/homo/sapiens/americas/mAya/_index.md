## Revolts
### Caste war
The Caste War of Yucatán (1847–1901) began with the revolt of culturally Native Maya people of the Yucatán Peninsula against the culturally European (and in the elite, racially Caucasian) Latino population, called Yucatecos. The latter had long held political and economic control of the region. Spaniards, Havanans, & New Orleanians (French? Southerners?) aided the Whites. A lengthy war ensued between the Yucateco forces in the northwest of the Yucatán and the independent Maya in the southeast.


Composition of Mexican population changed dramatically in 19th century- from 33% Mestizo in 1800 to 53% Mestizo in 1910.

### Chiapas rebellion
The Mayan Zapatista Army (EZLN) on January 1, 1994, the day when the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) came into effect, issued its First Declaration from the Lacandon Jungle and its Revolutionary Laws.
