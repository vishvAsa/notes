## Hindu Japanology
- Awakening of interest - esp after Admiral Togo's victory
    - "Here again a certain resonance was felt in bhArata. The great patriot Lokamanya Tilak who had discovered ancient evolutionary connections between the Shinto pantheon and that of the Indo-Europeans tacitly admitted that Hindus may learn from the uShAputra-s. Some of his followers even went to Japan to study their ways. With that things had come a full circle, over 1200 years ago the emperor Shomu had personally welcomed a bharadvAja brAhmaNa from Southern India who performed the installations of indra, sarasvatI and others." \[[MT13](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2013/08/15/the-moment-of-silence/)\]
