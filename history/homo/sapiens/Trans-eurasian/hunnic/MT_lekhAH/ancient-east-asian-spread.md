Did the Initial Upper Paleolithic feature the 1st East Asian invasion of Western Eurasia? Long Long before the Huns or Turks? The IUP in archaeological terms stretches from Mongolia to Central Europe & in the south includes West Asia. Chronologically it is between the last Middle Image Paleothic phase & the new bladelet technologies ~50-35KYBP. The authors of the study have obtained ancient autosomal DNA from a IUP site in Bulgaria & rather than showing affinities to Western Eurasians is related to East Asians, including the ancient Tianyuan man. 

This suggests Image that the ancient East Asian lineage that contributed present East Asians and first Americans was once more widespread and reached as far as Eastern Europe. This might correlate with at least part of the IUP. In the west this East Asian lineage seems to have become extinct & not seen in modern Western Eurasian populations. The authors also suggest that these East Asian related people had "Neanderthal ancestors a few generations back in their family history". 

Who wiped them out in the West and how?
