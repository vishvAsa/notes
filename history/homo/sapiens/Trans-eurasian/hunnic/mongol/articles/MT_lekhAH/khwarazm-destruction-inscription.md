The famous Chingiz stone inscription talking of the destruction of marUnmatta-s of the Khwarizm empire. 

> When Činggis Qan, despoiling the Sartayul people, dismounting, the noblemen of the entire Mongol nation had gathered (at) Buqa Sočiyai  
> (i.e. When Činggis Qan, having subjugated the Sartayul (= Muslim) people set up camp and the noblemen of the entire Mongol nation had gathered at Buqa Sočiyai.)  
> Yisüngge, when long-distance shooting, shot (an arrow) at long distance to 335 aldas,  
> (i.e. When Yisüngge shot at the long distance (shooting contest), he shot an arrow 335 fathoms.)

Here Yissunge Mergen is the son of Qasar, brother of the Khan. There is an interesting etymology in action here. The word for the marUnmatta-s in Mongolic is sartaghul which is ultimately derived from the Sanskrit word sArtha-vAha = a businessman taking merchandise (caravan-man). The word itself might have entered Mongolic via an Iranic intermediary. The Mongols seem to have initially encountered the marUnmatta-s as tradesman. Indeed, the Khan wanted to establish trading routes to the Mongol territory when his embassy was slaughtered by the Ms leading to the famous retaliation destroying the empire of Mohammad Khwarizm Shah. 

This archery contest was in the early 1220s as the Mongols were returning from that campaign. de Rachewiltz thinks the stone itself might have been a funerary monument for Yissunge who died aged 80 in 1270. 

Another etymological curiosity. The place where the Mongols held the context is called Buqa Sochighai. Buqa= bull; sochighAi = gets frightened. "The place where the bull gets frightened". Now IEanists reconstruct a PIE word bhow or bhew for bull. Was the buqa an transfer from an IE source? Might be paralled by PIE word for ox which is seen in Skt as ukSha. It has been transferred to Turkic as okur. These might related to the transfer of pastoral cattle rearing technology from the Indo-Iranians of steppe to the steppe Altaic peoples.
