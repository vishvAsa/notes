Order of Chingiz Khan's 9 children through his 1st wife Börte (sons in brackets):

- Qojin
- (Jochi)
- (Chaghatai)
- (Ögedei)
- Checheyigen
- Alaqa
- Tümelün
- (Tolui)
- Al Altan

4 sons + 5 daughters who survived to adulthood AFAI can tell; don't know if any others died young. Good success for  her. Börte joined the Khan ~1178 CE around age 18. She bore her first daughter around 20 & was kidnapped around 21-22 which resulted in the uncertainty of the paternity of Jochi. Al Altan was born ~1196 CE. That would mean she was ~36 then, close to the limit of safe child-bearing. 

Given that there is no evidence in Mongol sources that she employed wet-nurses to feed her kids it is likely she was doing it herself. Which would mean she was having a kid every ~2 years. This in turn suggests she did not lose any in infancy. She & the Khan were rather productive through thick & thin as it included some years of rather tough fighting like the battle of Dalan Balzhut where then Khan suffered a major defeat & was reduced to few followers & had to retreat south close to the Jin empire of the Jurchen. But by the time he returned he now had finished his business of family & was ready for the great wars that followed. 

A totemic pole of Börte where the mother of the Mongol nation is worshipped at banks of the Khukh Nuur lake near the Khar Zurkh Mountain in northern Mongolia.
