The famous tale of the Indian rhinoceros & Mongols turning away from India as narrated by Saghang Sechen from Igor de Rachewiltz et al's convenient romanized edition.

> Thereupon, when he (i.e. Činggis Qan), following the same course, rode against India, on crossing the mountain defile called Candanarang (“Brilliant Peak') Pass, a wild animal called the serü (“rhinoceros'), which had a single horn on top of its head, came swiftly towards him; it made obeisance, kneeling three times before the Lord. While everyone marvelled at it, the Lord spoke thus and said, 
> 
> “That vajra-seat of India, so-called,  
> Is said to be the country where the sublime  
> Buddhas and Bodhisattvas of yore, and  
> The powerful Holy Rulers were born.  
> Now, why is it that this speechless wild animal  
> Makes obeisance thus, like a man?  
> If we go there (i.e. to India), we will perhaps  
> Be punished (by Heaven)?  
> Could Heaven Above, my father, have warned me?' 
> 
> He wheeled around and returned home.
