A tolerant syncretic religion founded by Mani the Iranian (For details, see Agama page). Taken up later by the Uighur.

Uyghur khagan Boku Tekin (759â€“780) converted to the religion in 763 after a 3 days discussion with its preachers, the Babylonian headquarters sent high rank clerics to Uyghur, and Manichaeism remained the state religion for about a century before the collapse of the Uyghur Khaganate in 840.
