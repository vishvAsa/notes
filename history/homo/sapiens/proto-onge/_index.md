## Early Indian Hunter Gatherer settlement
- There were early hunter gatherer (=IHG) groups - currently reflected in isolated Indian tribes. Those close to the un-admixed old Indian H-G are the south Indian tribes from the Tamil country like the Irula, Malayan, Kadar, Pulliyar and Paniya. They are the deeply divergent mainland sister group of the Onge/Jarawa of the Andamans. A represent a remnant population of early out of Africa immigrants who first reached India. There they might have mixed with one or more preexisting archaic Homo (one might have been the Denisovans) but the details of that are limited. These old Indian HG tribes share a deep ancestry with the Onge, Papuans, Naasioi and Australians. 
- IVC (see below) + IHG gave rise to pre-Aryan Indians (confusingly called ancestral south Indians  / ASI by Reich etal).

## sunDaland
Denisovans were overrun at first contact with humans in Sundaland. The Denisovans that the Negritos of Bataan in the Philippines & Papuans in Papua encountered were very distinctive, & the Negritos mixed with them ~24% more than the Papuans.

## Replacement in SE Asia
- the austroasiatic, tai, burman and austronesian expansion into se asia is about a 80% replacement of the indigeneous hohabanian
