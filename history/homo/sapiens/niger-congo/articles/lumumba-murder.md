"A Patriot Elected Prime minister of an Independent country,killed, dissolved in Acid, Only teeth as a remembrance left" authorised by CIA, President of USA & executed by Belgium,all for Uranium,for it's Bombs (Hiroshima & Nagasaki) & then Coup d'tetat. Sounds similar?

Patrice Emery Lumumba was born as Elias Okitasombo on July 2, 1925 in Onalua, a village in the Kasai Oriental. After receiving basic education in local school, he settled in Stanleyville (now Kisangani), a city in the northeastern part of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. By 1950s, Patrice Lumumba was squarely involved in Congolese politics. In 1958, he helped create the Mouvement National Congolais (MNC), a pro-independence party in the Congo. MNC was unique among Congolese political parties. It was not organized along ethnic or tribal line.

Belgians saw him as a communist, who he wasn't, threw him in Jail in 1959, released him after riots, invited him for independence conference. Once he helped the Congo win its independence, he was determined to make sure African voice was heard. He was a Pan African Nationalist. After two round-table conferences in early 1960, Congolese and Belgian delegates returned to the Congo to recognize its independence on June 30, 1960. By this point, Lumumba had been chosen to be the country’s prime minister, serving with the president, Joseph Kasa-Vubu.

Meanwhile, when Congo was under Belgian Rule, it supplied Vast Uranium resources to the U.S, During WW II , US sought to secure all the uranium from the Shinkolobwe mine in present-day Democratic Republic of Congo for its atomic bomb project. The ore was richest in the world. Even after other Uranium sources were found elsewhere & this region of Congo still had the richest Source. Vast military Belgian & NATO air base was built at Kamina in western Katanga, “for the defence of Central Africa against what they saw as international Communism”.

After Patrice Lumumba came in,he had been asked by some businessmen in New York whether Americans would still have access to uranium, as they had when the Belgians ran the country. Lumumba’s response was unequivocal. “Belgium doesn’t produce any uranium,” he pointed out, Lumumba’s progressive-populist proposals & his opposition to the Katanga secessionist movement (which was led by the white-ruled colonial states of southern Africa & proclaimed its independence from the Congo on July 11, 1960) angered an array of foreign & local interests. Belgian colonial state, companies extracting the Congo’s mineral resources, of course, the leaders of white-ruled southern African states. (With whom the U.S had an agreement,yet again for Uranium & chose to ignore Apartheid) orchestrated Secession in Katanga region. On 11 July, the rich province of Katanga, where the Belgian “Mining Union” reigns, secedes under the leadership of Moïse Tshombe. South Kasai threatens to do the same. 

26 August 1960, Allen Dulles, the director of the CIA, decide to remove Lumumba as ordered by Oval Office. Patrice Lumumba approaches the United Nations, the U.S & the west for help. But help is denied. He decides to call fo help from the Soviet Union against the Katanga Secessionists who are backed by US & Belgium. With the help of agitators hired for the occasion – he had a budget of $100,000, a considerable sum at the time – the CIA station chief organised anti-Lumumba demonstrations that often degenerated into violence. On 5 September, Kasavubu dismissed Lumumba & replaced him.

The CIA believes the time has come to get down to business coup d’état on 14 September 1960, Colonel Mobutu seized power for the first time with the military. Lumumba was arrested. He is sent to Katanga rebels who are his arch enemies. Pres Eisenhower & British Foreign Secretary Sir Alec Douglas-Home “stressed that now is the time to get rid of Lumumba.” British Prime Minister Harold MacMillan called Lumumba a “Communist stooge”. Belgium’s Minister of African Affairs ordered Lumumba’s " Elimination". On January 17, 1961, Lumumba, two political associates were moved via airplane to another area. For hours, the three men were brutally tortured by Belgian/ Congolese officers.There, they were all fatally shot by a firing squad. See the Glorification of Crime.

AFP, which collected a testimony, reports that 3 days later the bodies were moved again to delete any possibility of tracking. A Belgian Officer Soete said he was accompanied by “another man” & a few Congolese when they cut up the corpses with saws & dissolved them in ACID. A Belgian officer took his two Golden teeth as Souvenir. In 2013, the US state department admitted that President Eisenhower had authorised the Murder of Patrice Lumumba. The two teeth of Lumumba are yet to be returned amid a Covid Spike in 2021.

Congolese independence hero Patrice Lumumba's body was dissolved in acid, but a tooth was later found. Belgium admits at last in 2021 that it was responsible fo his murder. So much,for American Democracy & Colonial European NATO human rights!!!!🙄 

While mourning the assassination of her husband, Patrice, the first prime minister of the DRC, she led a protest march on Valentine’s Day 1961, stripped to the waist. It was a gesture that,was iconic in its position. When will the World learn!!!! Last letter to Wife 

> "I know/feel in my very heart of hearts that sooner or later my people will rid themselves of all their enemies, foreign/domestic,that they will rise up as one to say no to the shame degradation of colonialism/regain their dignity in pure light of day. We are not alone. Africa, Asia the free liberated people in every corner of the globe will ever remain at the side of the millions of Congolese who will not abandon the struggle until the day when there will be no more colonizers,no more of their mercenaries in our country. Neither brutal assaults, nor cruel mistreatment, nor torture have ever led me to beg for mercy,I prefer to die with my head held high, unshakable faith, and the greatest confidence in the destiny of my country rather than live in slavery & contempt for sacred principles. History will one day have its say; it will not be the history taught in the United Nations, Washington, Paris, or Brussels, however, but history taught in the countries that have rid themselves of colonialism and its puppets. Africa will write its own history. Do not weep for me, my companion; I know that my country, now suffering so much,‘will be able to defend its independence, its freedom. Long live Congo! Long live Africa!"

This is by far one of the most inspiring letters one could read. Especially, the way he was killed.

Any Pan African Nationalist Leader, who vouched for a common African Currency has been eliminated along the same template. Natural Resources and Ethnic Diversity used as a tool to do this.

This is neither promoting Atrocity Literature nor against Whites Or Blacks/Browns. One who knows his own Hstory & of the World always rules the world. Decide if you read correct History or ones written by "Victors of Barbarian Adventures". Reconciliation/Redemption is Easier!
