Israel ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡± is Client state of US/West, with more Sovereignty and Slightly independent foreign policy. 

We'll also look at the reasons for slightly more Sovereignty- Many people told me that Israel is Sovereign country, Well lemme tell ya that it's not. It's pure client state of US/West and there is no harm accepting this truth. A client state is a state which is subservient to powerful state or dependent politically, economically, and Militarily on bigger power. There are many names to this term like Vassal state, satellite state, dominion state etc. Depending on situations we use different names.

As we all know that for now USAðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ is sole hegemonic superpower of world (not going to remain for too long). It controls or uses nations as it's clients which means dominating them economically, Military and bit culturally (Pop, Hollywood, Phub etc.) I'll explain further - Domination like:

- Economically- Dollar, Oils, Investment
- Militarily- By having permanent military base.
- I explained about culturally above.


Client state works with bigger superpower in securing it's (Bigger powerful state) strategic interests all around the world or in particular region where client state is present. Interests include economically, militarily, culturally, political dominance.

Let's come to Israel ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡±, and how it's client state for now. Following are reasons -

- Politically - Since the formation of state of Israel in 1948 it has enjoyed a tremendous political support from its Big powerful state like US and West. Infact US recognised Israel as state the day it declared its independence, and we all know west and US doesn't do a sh*t without interests. Plus Israel depends too much on pro Israeli lobbyist organization to get it things done in US govt. One such organisation is AIPAC. Infact US congress decides many key fundings for Israeli military and technology stuff. Due to powerful Jewish lobbyist organization Israel is kinda immune to evil terms and conditions of being a client state of US. But it's still a client state.
- Economically- US is major investment partner in Israel's economy not now but since it's creation. Israel is nothing without any help from US/West, a war torn deserted country with negligible resource becomes paradise in Middle East. It's not all Israeli made - a majority chunk comes from the help of US and West. Today the kind of Israel we see couldn't be possible without help of US/West. It's just impossible to outperform in situation like Israel faces. Large no of buyers of Israeli startups comes from US. Plus it receives huge chunk of aids also.
- Militarily- Israel is one of the top purchaser of US/West arms and equipments. Infact world famous Iron dome is also made with the cooperation of US. Ofcourse Israelis have contributed by far large but still. Israel uses American guns like m416, m4a1 etc. Infact Israel is also purchaser of so called crown jewel of American Technology the F-35 fighter jets and we all know whom Americans give this machine - And not to forget when Turkey was kicked out from F-35 program just because it purchased Russian S-400. 
- Culturally- I already talked about this earlier. Won't go further.

Why Israel is never condemned for taking parts of Lebanon and some parts of Syria? Why it always gets support for its military actions from US/West? Why no condemnation? Because it's client state and US/West have their interest to use Israel as their base to assert dominance in Middle East. How come Israel operates so boldly in different territories in that region. Because they have full support of West/US and this is their client state privilege. 

If Foreign country's military base in your soil then your're not free. There is a military base of US on soil of Israel, which strongly compromises it's Sovereignty like nothing else. Having physical military presence is serious pressure point. Currently US has 1 permanent military base in Israel in Dimona, Negev.

Israel never takes any such actions which might upset US/West. It cancelled it's deals with China just because US has said it to do. Israel foreign policy almost aligns with interests of US/West in middle East.

By this we come to conclusion that yes Israel ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡± is indeed client state of US/West. And if you're client state and have permanent military base of foreign country on your soil then you're not Sovereign. But i don't think so that it gonna last long now. Because decline of US/West is inevitable in near future probably 2-3 decades from now and Rise of Asia is inevitable. So that client state relationship might break badly.
