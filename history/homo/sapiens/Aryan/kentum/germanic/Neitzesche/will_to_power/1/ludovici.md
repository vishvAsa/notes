### PREFACE.



1.

Concerning great things one should either be silent or one should speak loftily:—loftily—that is to say, cynically and innocently.



2.

What I am now going to relate is the history of the next two centuries. I shall describe what will happen, what must necessarily happen: *the triumph of Nihilism.* This history can be written already; for necessity itself is at work in bringing it about. This future is already proclaimed by a hundred different omens; as a destiny it announces its advent everywhere, for this music of to-morrow all ears are already pricked. The whole of our culture in Europe has long been writhing in an agony of suspense which increases from decade to decade as if in expectation of a catastrophe: restless, violent, helter-skelter, like a torrent that will *reach its bourne,* and refuses to reflect—yea, that even dreads reflection.



3.

On the other hand, the present writer has done little else, hitherto, than *reflect and meditate,* like an instinctive philosopher and anchorite, who found his advantage in isolation—in remaining outside, in patience, procrastination, and lagging behind; like a weighing and testing spirit who has already lost his way in every labyrinth of the future; like a prophetic bird-spirit that *looks backwards* when it would announce what is to come; like the first perfect European Nihilist, who, however, has already outlived Nihilism in his own soul—who has out-grown, overcome, and dismissed it.



4.

For the reader must not misunderstand the meaning of the title which has been given to this Evangel of the Future. "*The Will to Power: An Attempted Transvaluation of all Values*"—with this formula a *counter-movement* finds expression, in regard to both a principle and a mission; a movement which in some remote future will supersede this perfect Nihilism; but which nevertheless regards it as a *necessary step,* both logically and psychologically, towards its own advent, and which positively cannot come, except *on top of* and *out of* it. For, why is the triumph of Nihilism *inevitable* now? Because the very values current amongst us to-day will arrive at their logical conclusion in Nihilism,—because Nihilism is the only possible outcome of our greatest values and ideals,—because we must first experience Nihilism before we can realise what the actual worth of these "values" was.... Sooner or later we shall be in need of *new values.*



### A PLAN.

1. Nihilism is at our door: whence comes this most gruesome of all guests to us?—To begin with, it is a mistake to point to "social evils," "physiological degeneration," or even to corruption as a cause of Nihilism. This is the most straightforward and most sympathetic age that ever was. Evil, whether spiritual, physical, or intellectual, is, in itself, quite unable to introduce Nihilism, *i.e.,* the absolute repudiation of worth, purpose, desirability. These evils allow of yet other and quite different explanations. But there is one *very definite explanation* of the phenomena: Nihilism harbours in the heart of Christian morals.

2. The downfall of Christianity,—through its morality \(which is insuperable\), which finally turns against the Christian God Himself \(the sense of truth, highly developed through Christianity, ultimately revolts against the falsehood and fictitiousness of all Christian interpretations of the world and its history. The recoil-stroke of "God is Truth" in the fanatical Belief, is: "All is false." Buddhism of *action*....\).

3. Doubt in morality is the decisive factor. The downfall of the *moral* interpretation of the universe, which loses its *raison d'être* once it has tried to take flight to a Beyond, meets its end in Nihilism. "Nothing has any purpose" \(the inconsistency of one explanation of the world, to which men have devoted untold energy,—gives rise to the suspicion that all explanations may perhaps be false\). The Buddhistic feature: a yearning for nonentity \(Indian Buddhism has no fundamentally moral development at the back of it; that is why Nihilism in its case means only morality not overcome; existence is regarded as a punishment and conceived as an error; error is thus held to be punishment—a moral valuation\). Philosophical attempts to overcome the "moral God" \(Hegel, *Pantheism*\). The vanquishing of popular ideals: the wizard, the saint, the bard. Antagonism of "true" and "beautiful" and "good."

4. Against "purposelessness" on the one hand, against moral valuations on the other: how far has all science and philosophy been cultivated heretofore under the influence of moral judgments? And have we not got the additional factor—the enmity of science, into the bargain? Or the prejudice against science? Criticism of Spinoza. Christian valuations everywhere present as remnants in socialistic and positivistic systems. *A criticism of Christian* morality is altogether lacking.

5. The Nihilistic consequences of present natural science \(along with its attempts to escape into a Beyond\). Out of its practice there finally *arises* a certain self-annihilation, an antagonistic attitude towards itself—a sort of anti-scientificality. Since Copernicus man has been rolling away from the centre towards *x*.

6. The Nihilistic consequences of the political and politico-economical way of thinking, where all principles at length become tainted with the atmosphere of the platform: the breath of mediocrity, insignificance, dishonesty, etc. Nationalism. Anarchy, etc. Punishment. Everywhere the *deliverer* is missing, either as a class or as a single man—the justifier.

7. Nihilistic consequences of history and of the "practical historian," *i.e.,* the romanticist. The attitude of art is quite unoriginal in modern life. Its gloominess. Goethe's so-called Olympian State.

8. Art and the preparation of Nihilism. Romanticism \(the conclusion of Wagner's *Ring of the Nibelung*\).

## 1. NIHILISM

* * *

1. Nihilism As an Outcome of the Valuations and Interpretations of Existence Which Have Prevailed Heretofore.



2.

What does Nihilism mean?—*That the highest values are losing their value.* There is no bourne. There is no answer to the question: "to what purpose?"



3.

Thorough Nihilism is the conviction that life is absurd, in the light of the highest values already discovered; it also includes the *view* that we have not the smallest right to assume the existence of transcendental objects or things in themselves, which would be either divine or morality incarnate.

This view is a result of fully developed "truthfulness": therefore a consequence of the belief in morality.



4.

What *advantages* did the Christian hypothesis of morality offer?

\(1\) It bestowed an intrinsic value upon men, which contrasted with their apparent insignificance and subordination to chance in the eternal flux of becoming and perishing.

\(2\) It served the purpose of God's advocates, inasmuch as it granted the world a certain *perfection* despite its sorrow and evil—it also granted the world that proverbial "freedom": evil seemed full of *meaning*.

\(3\) It assumed that man could have a *knowledge* of absolute values, and thus granted him *adequate perception* for the most important things.

\(4\) It prevented man from despising himself as man, from turning against life, and from being driven to despair by knowledge: it was a self-preservative measure.

In short: Morality was the great *antidote* against practical and theoretical Nihilism.



5.

But among the forces reared by morality, there was *truthfulness*: this in the end turns against morality, exposes the *teleology* of the latter, its interestedness, and now the *recognition* of this lie so long incorporated, from which we despaired of ever freeing ourselves, acts just like a stimulus. We perceive certain needs in ourselves, implanted during the long dynasty of the moral interpretation of life, which now seem to us to be needs of untruth: on the other hand, those very needs represent the highest values owing to which we are able to endure life. We have *ceased* from attaching any worth to what we know, and we *dare* not attach any more worth to that with which we would fain deceive ourselves—from this antagonism there results a process of dissolution.



6.

This is the *antinomy*: In so far as we believe in morality, we condemn existence.



7.

The highest values in the service of which man ought to live, more particularly when they oppressed and constrained him most—these *social values, owing to their tone-strengthening* tendencies, were built over men's heads as though they were the will of God or "reality," or the actual world, or even a hope of a world to come. Now that the lowly origin of these values has become known, the whole universe seems to have been transvalued and to have lost its significance—but this is only an intermediate stage.



8.

The consequence of *Nihilism* \(disbelief in all values\) as a result of a moral valuation:—*We have grown to dislike egotism* \(even though we have realised the impossibility of altruism\);—*we have grown to dislike what is most necessary* \(although we have recognised the impossibility of a *liberum arbitrium* and of an "intelligible freedom"\[1\]\). We perceive that we do not reach the spheres in which we have set our values—at the same time those other spheres in which we live have *not* thereby gained *one iota* in value. On the contrary, we are *tired,* because we have lost the main incentive to live. "All in vain hitherto\!"



9.

"Pessimism as a preparatory state to Nihilism."



10.

A. Pessimism viewed as strength—*in what respect?* In the energy of its logic, as anarchy, Nihilism, and analysis.

B. Pessimism regarded as collapse—*in what sense?* In the sense of its being a softening influence, a sort of cosmopolitan befingering, a "tout comprendre," and historical spirit.

*Critical tension*: extremes make their appearance and become dominant.



11.

*The logic of Pessimism leads finally to Nihilism: what is the force at work?*—The notion that *there are no values,* and *no purpose*: the recognition of the part that moral valuations have played in all other lofty values.

Result: *moral valuations are condemnations, negations; morality is the abdication of the will to live....*


\[1\] This is a Kantian term. Kant recognised two kinds of Freedom—the practical and the transcendental kind. The first belongs to the phenomenal, the second to the intelligible world.—TRANSLATOR'S NOTE.




12.

The Collapse of Cosmopolitan Values.

*A.*

Nihilism will have to manifest itself as a *psychological condition, first* when we have sought in all that has happened a purpose which is not there: so that the seeker will ultimately lose courage. Nihilism is therefore the coming into consciousness of the long *waste* of strength, the pain of "futility," uncertainty, the lack of an opportunity to recover in some way, or to attain to a state of peace concerning anything—shame in one's own presence, as if one had *cheated* oneself too long.... The purpose above-mentioned might have been achieved: in the form of a "realisation" of a most high canon of morality in all worldly phenomena, the moral order of the universe; or in the form of the increase of love and harmony in the traffic of humanity; or in the nearer approach to a general condition of happiness; or even in the march towards general nonentity—any sort of goal always constitutes a purpose. The common factor to all these appearances is that something will be *attained,* through the process itself: and now we perceive that Becoming has been aiming at *nothing,* and has achieved nothing. Hence the disillusionment in regard to a so-called *purpose in existence,* as a cause of Nihilism; whether this be in respect of a very definite purpose, or generalised into the recognition that all the hypotheses are false which have hitherto been offered as to the object of life, and which relate to the whole of "Evolution" \(man *no longer* an assistant in, let alone the culmination of, the evolutionary process\).

Nihilism will manifest itself as a psychological condition, in the second place, when man has fixed a totality, a systematisation, even an organisation in and behind all phenomena, so that the soul thirsting for respect and admiration will wallow in the general idea of a highest ruling and administrative power \(if it be the soul of a logician, the sequence of consequences and perfect reasoning will suffice to conciliate everything\). A kind of unity, some form of "monism":' and as a result of this belief man becomes obsessed by a feeling of profound relativity and dependence in the presence of an All which is infinitely superior to him, a sort of divinity. "The general good exacts the surrender of the individual ..." but lo, there is no such general good\! At bottom, man loses the belief in his own worth when no infinitely precious entity manifests itself through him—that is to say, he conceived such an All, *in order to be able to believe in his own worth.*

Nihilism, as a psychological condition, has yet a third and last form. Admitting these two *points of view*: that no purpose can be assigned to Becoming, and that no great entity rules behind all Becoming, in which the individual may completely lose himself as in an element of superior value; there still remains the *subterfuge* which would consist in condemning this whole world of Becoming as an illusion, and in discovering a world which would lie beyond it, and would be a *real* world. The moment, however, that man perceives that this world has been devised only for the purpose of meeting certain psychological needs, and that he has no right whatsoever to it, the final form of Nihilism comes into being, which comprises *a denial of a metaphysical world,* and which forbids itself all belief in a *real* world. From this standpoint, the reality of Becoming is the only reality that is admitted: all bypaths to back-worlds and false godheads are abandoned—but *this world is no longer endured, although no one wishes to disown it.*

What has actually happened? The feeling of worthlessness was realised when it was understood that neither the notion of "*Purpose*" nor that of "*Unity*" nor that of "*Truth*" could be made to interpret the general character of existence. Nothing is achieved or obtained thereby; the unity which intervenes in the multiplicity of events is entirely lacking: the character of existence is not "true," it is *false*; there is certainly no longer any reason to believe in a *real* world. In short, the categories, "Purpose," "Unity," "Being," by means of which we had lent some worth to life, we have once more divorced from it—and the world now appears *worthless* to us....

*B.*

Admitting that we have recognised the impossibility of *interpreting* world by means of these three categories, and that from this standpoint the world begins to be worthless to us; we must ask ourselves whence we derived our belief in these three categories. Let us see if it is possible to refuse to believe in them. If we can *deprive them of their value,* the proof that they cannot be applied to the world, is no longer a sufficient reason for *depriving that world of its value*.

Result: *The belief* in the categories of reason\[2\] is the cause of Nihilism—we have measured the worth of the world according to categories *which can only be applied to a purely fictitious world.*

Conclusion: All values with which we have tried, hitherto, to lend the world some worth, from our point of view, and with which we have therefore *deprived it of all worth* \(once these values have been shown to be inapplicable\)—all these values, are, psychologically, the results of certain views of utility, established for the purpose of maintaining and increasing the dominion of certain communities: but falsely projected into the nature of things. It is always man's *exaggerated ingenuousness* to regard himself as the sense and measure of all things.


\[2\] This probably refers to Kant's celebrated table of twelve categories. The four classes, quantity, quality, relation, and modality, are each provided with three categories.—TRANSLATOR'S NOTE.




13.

Nihilism represents an intermediary pathological condition \(the vast generalisation, the conclusion that there *is no purpose* in anything, is pathological\): whether it be that the productive forces are not yet strong enough—or that *decadence* still hesitates and has not yet discovered its expedients.

*The conditions of this hypothesis*:—That there is *no truth*; that there is no absolute state of affairs—no "thing-in-itself." *This alone is Nihilism, and of the most extreme kind.* It finds that the value of things consists precisely in the fact that these values are *not* real and never have been real, but that they are only a symptom of strength on the part of the *valuer,* a simplification serving the *purposes of existence.*



14.

*Values and their modification* are related to the *growth of power of the valuer.*

The measure of *disbelief* and of the "freedom of spirit" which is tolerated, viewed as an *expression of the growth of power.*

"Nihilism" viewed as the ideal of the *highest spiritual power,* of the over-rich life, partly destructive, partly ironical.



15.

What is *belief*? How is a belief born? All belief assumes that *something is true.*

The extremest form of Nihilism would mean that *all* belief—all assumption of truth—is false: because no real world is at hand. It were therefore: only an *appearance seen in perspective,* whose origin must be found in us \(seeing that we are constantly in need of a narrower, a shortened, and simplified world\).

This should be realised, that the extent to which we can, in our heart of hearts, acknowledge appearance, and the necessity of falsehood, without going to rack and ruin, is the *measure of strength.*

In this respect, Nihilism, in that it is the *negation* of a real world and of Being, might be *a divine view of the world.*



16.

If we are disillusioned, we have not become so in regard to life, but owing to the fact that our eyes have been opened to all kinds of "desiderata." With mocking anger we survey that which is called "*Ideal*": we despise ourselves only because we are unable at every moment of our lives to quell that absurd emotion which is called "Idealism." This *pampering* by means of ideals is stronger than the anger of the *disillusioned one.*



17.

*To what extent does Schopenhauerian Nihilism continue to be the result of the same ideal as that which gave rise to Christian Theism?* The amount of certainty concerning the most exalted desiderata, the highest values and the greatest degree of perfection, was so great, that the philosophers started out from it as if it had been an *a priori* and *absolute fact*: "God" at the head, as the *given quantity*—Truth. "To become like God," "to be absorbed into the Divine Being"—these were for centuries the most ingenuous and most convincing desiderata \(but that which convinces is not necessarily true on that account: it is *nothing more nor less than convincing.* An observation for donkeys\).

The granting of a *personal-reality* to this accretion of ideals has been unlearned: people have become atheistic. But has the ideal actually been abandoned? The latest metaphysicians, as a matter of fact, still seek their true "reality" in it—the "thing-in-itself" beside which everything else is merely appearance. Their dogma is, that because our world of appearance is so obviously *not* the expression of that ideal, it therefore cannot be "true"—and at bottom does not even lead back to that metaphysical world as cause. The unconditioned, in so far as it stands for that highest degree of perfection, cannot possibly be the reason of all the conditioned. Schopenhauer, who desired it otherwise, was obliged to imagine this metaphysical basis as the antithesis to the ideal, as "an evil, blind will": thus it could be "that which appears," that which manifests itself in the world of appearance. But even so, he did not give up that ideal absolute—he circumvented it....

\(Kant seems to have needed the hypothesis of "intelligible freedom,"\[3\] in order to relieve the *ens perfectum* of the responsibility of having contrived this world as it is, in short, in order to explain evil: scandalous logic for a philosopher\!\).


\[3\] See Note on p. 11.





18.

*The most general sign of modern times*: in his own estimation, man has lost an infinite amount of *dignity.* For a long time he was the centre and tragic hero of life in general; then he endeavoured to demonstrate at least his relationship to the most essential and in itself most valuable side of life—as all metaphysicians do, who wish to hold fast to the *dignity of man,* in their belief that moral values are cardinal values. He who has let God go, clings all the more strongly to the belief in morality.



19.

Every purely *moral* valuation \(as, for instance, the Buddhistic\) *terminates in Nihilism*: Europe must expect the same thing\! It is supposed that one can get along with a morality bereft of a religious background; but in this direction the road to Nihilism is opened. There is nothing in religion which compels us to regard ourselves as valuing creatures.



20.

The question which Nihilism puts, namely, "to what purpose?" is the outcome of a habit, hitherto, to regard the purpose as something fixed, given and exacted *from outside*—that is to say, by some supernatural authority. Once the belief in this has been unlearned, the force of an old habit leads to the search after *another* authority, which would *know how to speak unconditionally,* and could *point to* goals and missions. The authority of the *conscience* now takes the first place \(the more *morality* is emancipated from theology, the more imperative does it become\) as a compensation for the *personal authority.* Or the authority of *reason.* Or the *gregarious instinct* \(the herd\). Or history with its *immanent* spirit, which has its goal in itself, and to which one can *abandon oneself.* One would like to *evade* the *will,* as also the *willing* of a goal and the risk of setting oneself a goal. One would like to get rid of the responsibility \(*Fatalism* would be accepted\). Finally: Happiness and with a dash of humbug, the *happiness of the greatest number.*

It is said:—

\(1\) A definite goal is quite unnecessary.

\(2\) Such a goal cannot possibly be foreseen. Precisely now, when *will* in its *fullest strength* were *necessary,* it is in the *weakest* and most *pusillanimous* condition. *Absolute mistrust concerning the organising power* of the will.



21.

*The perfect Nihilist.*—The Nihilist's eye *idealises in an ugly sense,* and is inconstant to what it remembers: it allows its recollections to go astray and to fade, it does not protect them from that cadaverous coloration with which weakness dyes all that is distant and past. And what it does not do for itself it fails to do for the whole of mankind as well—that is to say, it allows it to drop.





22.

Nihilism. It may be *two things*:—

A. Nihilism as a sign of *enhanced spiritual strength*: active Nihilism.

B. Nihilism as a sign of the *collapse* and *decline* of spiritual *strength*: passive Nihilism.



23.

Nihilism, a *normal* condition.

It may be a sign of *strength*; spiritual vigour may have increased to such an extent that the *goals* toward which man has marched *hitherto* \(the "convictions," articles of faith\) are no longer suited to it \(for a faith generally expresses the exigencies of the *conditions of existence,* a submission to the authority of an order of things which *conduces* to the *prosperity,* the *growth* and *power* of a living creature ...\); on the other hand, a sign of *insufficient* strength, to fix a goal, a "wherefore," and a faith for itself.

It reaches its *maximum* of relative strength, as a powerful *destructive* force, in the form of *active Nihilism.*

Its opposite would be *weary* Nihilism, which no longer attacks: its most renowned form being Buddhism: as *passive* Nihilism, a sign of weakness: spiritual strength may be fatigued, *exhausted,* so that the goals and values which have prevailed *hitherto* are no longer suited to it and are no longer believed in—so that the synthesis of values and goals \(upon which every strong culture stands\) decomposes, and the different values contend with one another: *Disintegration,* then everything which is relieving, which heals, becalms, or stupefies, steps into the foreground under the cover of various *disguises,* either religious, moral, political or æsthetic, etc.



24.

Nihilism is not only a meditating over the "in vain\!"—not only the belief that everything deserves to perish; but one actually puts one's shoulder to the plough; *one destroys.* This, if you will, is illogical; but the Nihilist does not believe in the necessity of being logical.... It is the condition of strong minds and wills; and to these it is impossible to be satisfied with the negation of judgment: the *negation by deeds* proceeds from their nature. Annihilation by the reasoning faculty seconds annihilation by the hand.



25.

*Concerning the genesis of the Nihilist.* The courage of all one really *knows* comes but late in life. It is only quite recently that I have acknowledged to myself that heretofore I have been a Nihilist from top to toe. The energy and thoroughness with which I marched forward as a Nihilist deceived me concerning this fundamental principle. When one is progressing towards a goal it seems impossible that "aimlessness *per se*" should be one's fundamental article of faith.





26.

*The Pessimism of strong natures.* The "wherefore" after a terrible struggle, even after victory. That something may exist which is a hundred times *more important* than the question, whether we feel well or unwell, is the fundamental instinct of all strong natures—and consequently too, whether the *others* feel well or unwell. In short, that we have a purpose, for which we would not even hesitate to *sacrifice men,* run all risks, and bend our backs to the worst: *this is the great passion*.



* * *



2. Further Causes of Nihilism.



27.

*The causes of Nihilism*: \(1\) *The higher species is lacking, i.e.,* the species whose inexhaustible fruitfulness and power would uphold our belief in Man \(think only of what is owed to Napoleon—almost all the higher hopes of this century\).

\(2\) *The inferior species* \("herd," "ass," "society"\) is forgetting modesty, and inflates its needs into *cosmic* and *metaphysical* values. In this way all life is *vulgarised*: for inasmuch as the *mass* of mankind rules, it tyrannises over the *exceptions,* so that these lose their belief in themselves and become *Nihilists.*

All attempts to *conceive of a new species* come to nothing \("romanticism," the artist, the philosopher; against Carlyle's attempt to lend them the highest moral values\).

The result is that higher types are *resisted*.

*The downfall and insecurity of all higher types.* The struggle against genius \("popular poetry," etc.\). Sympathy with the lowly and the suffering as a *standard* for the *elevation of the soul*.

The *philosopher is lacking,* the interpreter of deeds, and not alone he who poetises them.



28.

*Imperfect* Nihilism—its forms: we are now surrounded by them.

All attempts made to escape Nihilism, which do not consist in transvaluing the values that have prevailed hitherto, only make the matter worse; they complicate the problem.



29.

*The varieties of self-stupefaction.* In one's heart of hearts, not to know, whither? Emptiness. The attempt to rise superior to it all by means of emotional intoxication: emotional intoxication in the form of music, in the form of cruelty in the tragic joy over the ruin of the noblest, and in the form of blind, gushing enthusiasm over individual *men* or distinct *periods* \(in the form of hatred, etc.\). The attempt to work blindly, like a scientific instrument; to keep an eye on the many small joys, like an investigator, for instance \(modesty towards oneself\); the mysticism of the voluptuous *joy* of eternal emptiness; art "for art's sake" \("le fait"\), "immaculate investigation," in the form of narcotics against the disgust of oneself; any kind of incessant work, *any* kind of small foolish fanaticism; the medley of all means, illness as the result of general profligacy \(dissipation kills pleasure\).

\(1\) As a result, feeble will-power.

\(2\) Excessive pride and the humiliation of petty weakness felt as a contrast.



30.

The time is coming when we shall have to pay for having been *Christians* for two thousand years: we are losing the equilibrium which enables us to live—for a long while we shall not know in what direction we are travelling. We are hurling ourselves headlong into the *opposite* valuations, with that degree of energy which could only have been engendered in man by an *overvaluation* of himself.

Now, everything is false from the root, words and nothing but words, confused, feeble, or over-strained.

*\(a\)* There is a seeking after a sort of earthly solution of the problem of life, but in the same sense as that of the *final triumph* of truth, love, justice \(socialism: "equality of persons"\).

*\(b\)* There is also an attempt to hold fast to the *moral ideal* \(with altruism, self-sacrifice, and the denial of the will, in the front rank\).

*\(c\)* There is even an attempt to hold fast to a "Beyond": were it only as an antilogical *x*; but it is forthwith interpreted in such a way that a kind of metaphysical solace, after the old style, may be derived from it.

*\(d\)* There is an attempt to read the phenomena of life in such a way as to arrive *at the divine guidance of old,* with its powers of rewarding, punishing, educating, and of generally conducing to a something *better* in the order of things.

*\(e\)* People once more believe in good and evil; so that the victory of the good and the annihilation of the evil is regarded as a *duty* \(this is English, and is typical of that blockhead, John Stuart Mill\).

\(f\) The contempt felt for "naturalness," for the desires and for the ego: the attempt to regard even the highest intellectuality of art as a result of an impersonal and disinterested attitude.

\(g\) The Church is still allowed to meddle in all the essential occurrences and incidents in the life of the individual, with a view to consecrating it and giving it a *loftier* meaning: we still have the "Christian State" and the "Christian marriage."



31.

There have been more thoughtful and more destructively thoughtful\[4\] times than ours: times like those in which Buddha appeared, for instance, in which the people themselves, after centuries of sectarian quarrels, had sunk so deeply into the abyss of philosophical dogmas, as, from time to time, European people have done in regard to the fine points of religious dogma. "Literature" and the press would be the last things to seduce one to any high opinion of the spirit of our times: the millions of Spiritists, and a Christianity with gymnastic exercises of that ghastly ugliness which is characteristic of all English inventions, throw more light on the subject.

European *Pessimism* is still in its infancy—a fact which argues against it: it has not yet attained to that prodigious and yearning fixity of sight to which it attained in India once upon a time, and in which nonentity is reflected; there is still too much of the "ready-made," and not enough of the "evolved" in its constitution, too much learned and poetic Pessimism; I mean that a good deal of it has been discovered, invented, and "created," but not caused.




\[4\] *zerdachtere*.




32.

Criticism of the Pessimism which has prevailed hitherto. The want of the eudæmonological standpoint, as a last abbreviation of the question: what is the *purpose* of it all? The reduction of gloom.

*Our* Pessimism: the world has not the value which we believed it to have,—our faith itself has so increased our instinct for research that we are *compelled* to say this to-day. In the first place, it seems of less value: *at first it is felt* to be of less value,—only in this sense are we pessimists,—that is to say, with the will to acknowledge this transvaluation without reserve, and no longer, as heretofore, to deceive ourselves and chant the old old story.

It is precisely in this way that we find the pathos which urges us to seek for *new values.* In short: the world might have far more value than we thought—we must get behind the *naïveté of our ideals,* for it is possible that, in our conscious effort to give it the highest interpretation, we have not bestowed even a moderately just value upon it.

What has been *deified*? The valuing instinct inside the *community* \(that which enabled it to survive\).

What has been *calumniated*? That which has tended to separate higher men from their inferiors, the instincts which cleave gulfs and build barriers.



33.

Causes effecting the *rise of Pessimism*:—

\(1\) The most powerful instincts and those which promised most for the future have hitherto been *calumniated,* so that life has a curse upon it.

\(2\) The growing bravery and the more daring mistrust on the part of man have led him to discover the fact that *these instincts cannot be cut adrift from life,* and thus he turns to embrace life.

\(3\) Only the most *mediocre,* who are not *conscious* of this conflict, prosper; the higher species fail, and as an example of degeneration tend to dispose all hearts against them—on the other hand, there is some indignation caused by the mediocre positing themselves as the end and meaning of all things. No one can any longer reply to the question: "Why?"

\(4\) Belittlement, susceptibility to pain, unrest, haste, and confusion are steadily increasing—the materialisation of all these tendencies, which is called "civilisation," becomes every day more simple, with the result that, in the face of the monstrous machine, the individual *despairs* and *surrenders.*



34.

Modern Pessimism is an expression of the uselessness only of the *modern* world, not of the world and existence as such.



35.

The "preponderance of *pain over pleasure"* or the reverse \(Hedonism\); both of these doctrines are already signposts to Nihilism....

For here, in both cases, no other final purpose is sought than the phenomenon pleasure or pain.

But only a man who no longer dares to posit a will, a purpose, and a final goal can speak in this way—according to every healthy type of man, the worth of life is certainly not measured by the standard of these secondary things. And a *preponderance* of pain would be possible and, *in spite of it,* a mighty will, a *saying of yea* to life, and a holding of this preponderance for necessary.

"Life is not worth living"; "Resignation"; "what is the good of tears?"—this is a feeble and sentimental attitude of mind. "*Un monstre gai vaut mieux qu'un sentimental ennuyeux.*"



36.

The philosophie Nihilist is convinced that all phenomena are without sense and are in vain, and that there ought to be no such thing as Being without sense and in vain. But whence comes this "There ought not to be?"—whence this "sense" and *this standard*? At bottom the Nihilist supposes that the sight of such a desolate, useless Being is *unsatisfying* to the philosopher, and fills him with desolation and despair. This aspect of the case is opposed to our subtle sensibilities as a philosopher. It leads to the absurd conclusion that the character of existence *must perforce afford pleasure to the philosopher* if it is to have any right to subsist.

Now it is easy to understand that happiness and unhappiness, within the phenomena of this world, can only serve the purpose of *means*: the question yet remaining to be answered is, whether it *will ever be possible* for us to perceive the "object" and "purpose" of life—whether the problem of purposelessness or the reverse is not quite beyond our ken.



37.

The development of *Nihilism out of Pessimism.* The denaturalisation of *Values.* Scholasticism of values. The values isolated, idealistic, instead of ruling and leading action, turn *against* it and condemn it.

Opposites introduced in the place of natural gradations and ranks. Hatred of the order of rank. Opposites are compatible with a plebeian age, because they are more easy to grasp.

The *rejected* world is opposed to an artificially constructed "true and valuable" one. At last we discover out of what material the "true" world was built; all that remains, now, is the rejected world, and to the account of our reasons for *rejecting it we place our greatest disillusionment.*

At this point *Nihilism* is reached; the directing values have been retained—nothing more\!

This gives rise to *the problem of strength and weakness*:—

\(1\) The weak fall to pieces upon it;

\(2\) The strong destroy what does not fall to pieces of its own accord;

\(3\) The strongest overcome the directing values.

*The whole condition of affairs produces the tragic age.*

3. The Nihilistic Movement As an Expression of Decadence.



38.

Just lately an accidental and in every way inappropriate term has been very much misused: everywhere people are speaking of "*Pessimism*,"  and there is a fight around the question \(to which some replies must be forthcoming\): which is right—Pessimism or Optimism?

People have not yet seen what is so terribly-obvious—namely, that Pessimism is not a problem but a *symptom,*—that the term ought to be replaced by "Nihilism,"—that the question, "to be or not to be," is itself an illness, a sign of degeneracy, an idiosyncrasy.

The Nihilistic movement is only an expression of physiological decadence.



39.

*To be understood*:—That every kind of decline and tendency to sickness has incessantly been at work in helping to create general evaluations: that in those valuations which now dominate, decadence has even begun to preponderate, that we have not only to combat the conditions which present misery and degeneration have brought into being; but that all decadence, previous to that of our own times, has been transmitted and has therefore remained an *active force* amongst us. A universal departure of this kind, on the part of man, from his fundamental instincts, such universal decadence of the valuing judgment, is the note of interrogation *par excellence,* the real riddle, which the animal "man" sets to all philosophers.



40.

*The notion "decadence":—Decay, decline,* and *waste,* are, *per se,* in no way open to objection;they are the natural consequences of life and vital growth. The phenomenon of decadence is just as necessary to life as advance or progress is: we are not in a position which enables us to *suppress* it. On the contrary, reason *would have it retain its rights.*

It is disgraceful on the part of socialist-theorists to argue that circumstances and social combinations could be devised which would put an end to all vice, illness, crime, prostitution, and poverty.... But that is tantamount to condemning *Life* ... a society is not at liberty to remain young. And even in its prime it must bring forth ordure and decaying matter. The more energetically and daringly it advances, the richer will it be in failures and in deformities, and the nearer it will be to its fall. Age is not deferred by means of institutions. Nor is illness. Nor is vice.



41.

Fundamental aspect of the nature of decadence: *what has heretofore been regarded as its causes are its effects.*

In this way, the whole perspective *of the problems of morality* is altered.

All the struggle of morals against vice, luxury, crime, and even against illness, seems a *naïveté,* a superfluous effort: there is no such thing as "*improvement*" \(a word against *repentance*\).

Decadence itself is not a thing *that can be withstood*: it is absolutely necessary and is proper to all ages and all peoples. That which must be withstood, and by all means in our power, is the spreading of the contagion among the sound parts of the organism.

Is that done? The very *reverse* is done. It is precisely on this account that one makes a stand on behalf of *humanity.*

How do the *highest values* created hitherto stand in relation to this fundamental question in *biology*? Philosophy, religion, morality, art, etc.

\(The remedy: militarism, for instance, from Napoleon onwards, who regarded civilisation as his natural enemy.\)



42.

All those things which heretofore have been regarded as the *causes of degeneration,* are really its effects.

But those things also which have been regarded as the *remedies* of degeneration are only *palliatives* of certain effects thereof: the "cured" are *types of the degenerate.*

*The results of decadence*: vice—viciousness; illness—sickliness; crime—criminality; celibacy—sterility; hysteria—the weakness of the will; alcoholism; pessimism, anarchy; debauchery \(also of the spirit\). The calumniators, underminers, sceptics, and destroyers.



43.

Concerning the notion "decadence." \(1\) Scepticism is a result of decadence: just as spiritual debauchery is.

\(2\) Moral corruption is a result of decadence \(the weakness of the will and the need of strong stimulants\).

\(3\) Remedies, whether psychological or moral, do not alter the march of decadence, they do not arrest anything; physiologically they do not count.

A peep into the *enormous futility* of these pretentious "reactions"; they are forms of anæsthetising oneself against certain fatal symptoms resulting from the prevailing condition of things; they do not eradicate the morbid element; they are often heroic attempts to cancel the decadent man, to allow only a minimum of his *deleterious influence* to survive.

\(4\) Nihilism is not a cause, but only the *rationale* of decadence.

\(5\) The "good" and the "bad" are no more than two types of decadence: they come together in all its fundamental phenomena.

\(6\) The *social problem* is a result of *decadence.*

\(7\) Illnesses, more particularly those attacking the nerves and the head, are signs that the *defensive* strength of strong nature is lacking; a proof of this is that irritability which causes pleasure and pain to be regarded as problems of the first order.



44.

*The most common types of decadence*: \(1\) In the belief that they are remedies, cures are chosen which only precipitate exhaustion;—this is the case with Christianity \(to point to the most egregious example of mistaken instinct\);—this is also the case with "progress."

\(2\) The *power of resisting* stimuli is on the wane—chance rules supreme: events are inflated and drawn out until they appear monstrous ... a suppression of the "personality," a disintegration of the will; in this regard we may mention a whole class of morality, the altruistic, that which is incessantly preaching pity, and whose most essential feature is the weakness of the personality, so that it *rings in unison,* and, like an over-sensitive string, does not cease from vibrating ... extreme irritability....

\(3\) Cause and effect are confounded: decadence is not understood as physiological, and its results are taken to be the causes of the general indisposition:—this applies to all religious morality.

\(4\) A state of affairs is desired in which suffering shall cease; life is actually considered the cause of all ills—*unconscious* and insensitive states \(sleep and syncope\) are held in incomparably higher esteem than the conscious states; hence a *method* of life.



45.

Concerning the hygiene of the "weak." All that is done in weakness ends in failure. Moral: do nothing. The worst of it is, that precisely the strength required in order to stop action, and to cease from reacting, is most seriously diseased under the influence of weakness: that one never reacts more promptly or more blindly than when one should not react at all.

The strength of a character is shown by the ability to delay and postpone reaction: a certain ἀδιαφορία is just as proper to it, as involuntariness in recoiling, suddenness and lack of restraint in "action," are proper to weakness. The will is weak: and the recipe for preventing foolish acts would be: to have a strong will and to do nothing—contradiction. A sort of self-destruction, the instinct of self-preservation is compromised.... *The weak man injures himself*.... That is the decadent *type*.

As a matter of fact, we meet with a vast amount of thought concerning the means wherewith *impassibility* may be induced. To this extent, the instincts are on the right scent; for to do nothing is more useful than to do something....

All the practices of private orders, of solitary philosophers, and of fakirs, are suggested by a correct consideration of the fact, that a certain kind of man is most *useful to himself* when he hinders his own action as much as possible.

*Relieving measures*: absolute obedience, mechanical activity, total isolation from men and things that might exact immediate decisions and actions.



46.

*Weakness of Will*: this is a fable that can lead astray. For there is no will, consequently neither a strong nor a weak one. The  multiplicity and disintegration of the instincts, the want of system in their relationship, constitute what is known as a "weak will"; their co-ordination, under the government of one individual among them, results in a "strong will"—in the first case vacillation and a lack of equilibrium is noticeable: in the second, precision and definite direction.



47.

That which is inherited is not illness, but a *predisposition to illness*: a lack of the powers of resistance against injurious external influences, etc. etc, broken powers of resistance; expressed morally: resignation and humility in the presence of the enemy.

I have often wondered whether it would not be possible to class all the highest values of the philosophies, moralities, and religions which have been devised hitherto, with the values of the feeble, the *insane* and the *neurasthenic* in a milder form, they present the same evils.

The value of all morbid conditions consists in the fact that they magnify certain normal phenomena which are difficult to discern in normal conditions....

*Health* and *illness* are not essentially different, as the ancient doctors believed and as a few practitioners still believe to-day. They cannot be imagined as two distinct principles or entities which fight for the living organism and make it their battlefield. That is nonsense and mere idle gossip, which no longer holds water. As a matter of fact, there is only a difference of degree between these two living conditions: exaggeration, want of proportion, want of harmony among the normal phenomena, constitute the morbid state \(Claude Bernard\).

Just as "evil" may be regarded as exaggeration, discord, and want of proportion, so can "good" be regarded as a sort of protective diet against the danger of exaggeration, discord, and want of proportion.

*Hereditary weakness* as a *dominant* feeling: the cause of the prevailing values.

*N.B.*—Weakness is in demand—why?... mostly because people cannot be anything else than weak.

*Weakening considered a duty*: The weakening of the desires, of the feelings of pleasure and of pain, of the will to power, of the will to pride, to property and to more property; weakening in the form of humility; weakening in the form of a belief; weakening in the form of repugnance and shame in the presence of all that is natural—in the form of a denial of life, in the form of illness and chronic feebleness; weakening in the form of a refusal to take revenge, to offer resistance, to become an enemy, and to show anger.

*Blunders* in the treatment: there is no attempt at combating weakness by means of any fortifying system; but by a sort of justification consisting of moralising; *i.e.,* by means of *interpretation.*

Two totally different conditions are *confused*: for instance, the *repose of strength,* which is essentially abstinence from reaction \(the prototype of the gods whom nothing moves\), and the *peace of exhaustion,* rigidity to the point of anæsthesia. All these philosophic and ascetic modes of procedure aspire to the second state, but actually pretend to attain to the first ... for they ascribe to the condition they have reached the attributes that would be in keeping only with a divine state.



48.

*The most dangerous misunderstanding.*—There is one concept which apparently allows of no confusion or ambiguity, and that is the concept *exhaustion.* Exhaustion may be acquired or inherited—in any case it alters the aspect and *value of things.*

Unlike him who involuntarily *gives* of the superabundance which he both feels and represents, to the things about him, and who sees them fuller, mightier, and more pregnant with promises,—who, in fact, *can* bestow,—the exhausted one belittles and disfigures everything he sees—he impoverishes its worth: he is detrimental....

No mistake seems possible in this matter: and yet history discloses the terrible fact, that the exhausted have always been *confounded* with those with the most abundant resources, and the latter with the most detrimental.

The pauper in vitality, the feeble one, impoverishes even life: the wealthy man, in vital powers, enriches it. The first is the parasite of the second: the second is a bestower of his abundance. How is confusion possible?

When he who was exhausted came forth with the bearing of a very active and energetic man \(when degeneration implied a certain excess of spiritual and nervous discharge\), he was *mistaken* for the wealthy man. He inspired terror. The cult of the madman is also always the cult of him who is rich in vitality, and who is a powerful man. The fanatic, the one possessed, the religious epileptic, all eccentric creatures have been regarded as the highest types of power: as divine.

This kind of strength which inspires terror seemed to be, above all, divine: this was the starting-point of authority; here *wisdom* was interpreted, hearkened to, and sought. Out of this there was developed, everywhere almost, a *will* to "deify," *i.e.,* to a typical degeneration of spirit, body, and nerves: an attempt to discover the road to this higher form of being. To make oneself ill or mad, to provoke the symptoms of serious disorder—was called getting stronger, becoming more superhuman, more terrible and more wise. People thought they would thus attain to such wealth of power, that they would be able to *dispense* it. Wheresoever there have been prayers, some one has been sought who had something to give away.

What led astray, here, was the experience of intoxication. This increases the feeling of power to the highest degree, therefore, to the mind of the ingenuous, it is *power.* On the highest altar of power *the most intoxicated man* must stand, the ecstatic. \(There are two causes of *intoxication*: superabundant life, and a condition of morbid nutrition of the brain.\)





49.

*Acquired,* not inherited exhaustion: \(1\) inadequate *nourishment,* often the result of ignorance concerning diet, as, for instance, in the case of scholars; \(2\) erotic precocity: the damnation more especially of the youth of France—Parisian youths, above all, who are already dirtied and ruined when they step out of their *lycées* into the world, and who cannot break the chains of despicable tendencies; ironical and scornful towards themselves—galley-slaves despite all their refinement \(moreover, in the majority of cases, already a symptom of racial and family decadence, as all hypersensitiveness is; and examples of the infection of environment: to be influenced by one's environment is also a sign of decadence\); \(3\) alcoholism, not the instinct but the habit, foolish imitation, the cowardly or vain adaptation to a ruling fashion. What a blessing a Jew is among Germans\! See the obtuseness, the flaxen head, the blue eye, and the lack of intellect in the face, the language, and the bearing; the lazy habit of stretching the limbs, and the need of repose among Germans—a need which is not the result of overwork, but of the disgusting excitation and over-excitation caused by alcohol.



50.

*A theory of exhaustion.*—Vice, the insane \(also artists\), the criminals, the anarchists—these are not the *oppressed* classes, but *the outcasts* of the community of all classes hitherto.

Seeing that all our classes are permeated by these elements, we have grasped the fact that *modern society* is not a "society" or a "body," but a diseased agglomeration of Chandala,—a society which no longer has the strength even to *excrete*.

To what extent living together for centuries has very much deepened *sickliness*:

modern virtuee   \}  
modern intellect \} as forms of disease.  
modern science  \}  




51.

*The state of corruption.*—The interrelation of all forms of corruption should be understood, and the Christian form \(Pascal as the type\), as also the socialistic and communistic \(a result of the Christian\), should not be overlooked \(from the standpoint of natural science, the *highest* conception of society according to socialists, is the lowest in the order of rank among societies\); the "Beyond" —corruption: as though outside the real world of Becoming there were a world of Being.

Here there must be no compromise, but selection, annihilation, and war—the Christian Nihilistic standard of value must be withdrawn from all things and attacked beneath every disguise ... for instance, from modern *sociology, music,* and *Pessimism* \(all forms of the Christian ideal of values\).



Either one thing *or* the other is true—that is to say, tending to elevate the type man....

The priest, the shepherd of souls, should be looked upon as a form of life which must be suppressed. All education, hitherto, has been helpless, adrift, without ballast, and afflicted with the contradiction of values.

52.

If Nature have no pity on the degenerate, it is not therefore immoral: the growth of physiological and moral evils in the human race, is rather the *result* of *morbid and unnatural morality.* The sensitiveness of the majority of men is both morbid and unnatural.

Why is it that mankind is corrupt in a moral and physiological respect? The body degenerates if one organ is *unsound.* The *right of altruism* cannot be traced to physiology, neither can the right to help and to the equality of fate: these are all premiums for degenerates and failures.

There can be no *solidarity* in a society containing unfruitful, unproductive, and destructive members, who, by the bye, are bound to have offspring even more degenerate than they are themselves.



53.

Decadence exercises a profound and perfectly unconscious influence, even over the ideals of science: all our sociology is a proof of this proposition, and it has yet to be reproached with the fact that it has only the experience of *society in the process of decay,* and inevitably takes its own decaying instincts as the basis of sociological judgment.

The *declining* vitality of modern Europe formulates its social ideals in its decaying instincts: and these ideals are all so like those of *old and effete* races, that they might be mistaken for one another.

The *gregarious instinct,* then,—now a sovereign power,—is something totally different from the instinct of an *aristocratic society*: and the value of the sum depends upon the value of the units constituting it.... The whole of our sociology knows no other instinct than that of the herd, *i.e.,* of a *multitude of mere ciphers*—of which every cipher has "equal rights," and where it is a virtue to be——naught....

The valuation with which the various forms of society are judged to-day is absolutely the same with that which assigns a higher place to peace than to war: but this principle is contrary to the teaching of biology, and is itself a mere outcome of decadent life. Life is a result of war, society is a means to war.... Mr. Herbert Spencer was a decadent in biology, as also in morality \(he regarded the triumph of altruism as a desideratum\!\!\!\).

54.

After thousands of years of error and confusion, it is my good fortune to have rediscovered the road which leads to a Yea and to a Nay.

I teach people to say Nay in the face of all that makes for weakness and exhaustion.

I teach people to say Yea in the face of all that makes for strength, that preserves strength, and justifies the feeling of strength.

Up to the present, neither the one nor the other has been taught; but rather virtue, disinterestedness, pity, and even the negation of life. All these are values proceeding from exhausted people.

After having pondered over the physiology of exhaustion for some time, I was led to the question: to what extent the judgments of exhausted people had percolated into the world of values.

The result at which I arrived was as startling as it could possibly be—even for one like myself who was already at home in many a strange world: I found that all prevailing values—that is to say, all those which had gained ascendancy over humanity, or at least over its tamer portions, could be traced back to the judgment of exhausted people.

Under the cover of the holiest names, I found the most destructive tendencies; people had actually given the name "God" to all that renders weak, teaches weakness, and infects with weakness.... I found that the "good man" was a form of self-affirmation on the part of decadence.

That virtue which Schopenhauer still proclaimed as superior to all, and as the most fundamental of all virtues; even that same pity I recognised as more dangerous than any vice. Deliberately to thwart the law of selection among species, and their natural means of purging their stock of degenerate members—this, up to my time, had been the greatest of all virtues....

One should do honour to the *fatality* which says to the feeble: "perish\!"

The opposing of this fatality, the botching of mankind and the allowing of it to putrefy, was given the name "God" One shall not take the name of the Lord one's God in vain....

The race is corrupted—not by its vices, but by its ignorance: it is corrupted because it has not recognised exhaustion as exhaustion: physiological misunderstandings are the cause of all evil.

Virtue is our greatest misunderstanding.

Problem: how were the exhausted able to make the laws of values? In other words, how did they who are the last, come to power?... How did the instincts of the animal man ever get to stand on their heads?...

4. The Crisis: Nihilism and the Idea of Recurrence.



55.

Extreme positions are not relieved by more moderate ones, but by extreme *opposite* positions. And thus the belief in the utter immorality of nature, and in the absence of all purpose and sense, are psychologically necessary attitudes when the belief in God and in an essentially moral order of things is no longer tenable.

Nihilism now appears, *not* because the sorrows of existence are greater than they were formerly, but because, in a general way, people have grown suspicious of the "meaning" which might be given to evil and even to existence. One interpretation has been overthrown: but since it was held to be *the* interpretation, it seems as though there were no meaning in existence at all, as though everything were in vain.

\*\*\*

It yet remains to be shown that this "in vain\!" is the character of present Nihilism. The mistrust of our former valuations has increased to such an extent that it has led to the question: "are not all 'values' merely allurements prolonging the duration of the comedy, without, however, bringing the unravelling any closer?" The "long period of time" which has culminated in an "in vain," without either goal or purpose, is the *most paralysing* of thoughts, more particularly when one sees that one is duped without, however, being able to resist being duped.

\*\*\*

Let us imagine this thought in its worst form: existence, as it is, without either a purpose or a goal, but inevitably recurring, without an end in nonentity: "*Eternal Recurrence.*"

This is the extremest form of Nihilism: nothing \(purposelessness\) eternal\!

European form of Buddhism: the energy of knowledge and of strength drives us to such a belief. It is the most *scientific* of all hypotheses. We deny final purposes. If existence had a final purpose it would have reached it.

\*\*\*

It should be understood that what is being aimed at, here, is a contradiction of Pantheism: for "everything perfect, divine, eternal," *also* leads *to the belief in Eternal Recurrence.* Question: has this pantheistic and affirmative attitude to all things also been made possible by morality? At bottom only the moral God has been overcome. Is there any sense in imagining a God "beyond good and evil"? Would Pantheism in *this* sense be possible? Do we withdraw the idea of purpose from the process, and affirm the process notwithstanding? This were so if, within that process, something were *attained* every moment—and always the same thing. Spinoza won an affirmative position of this sort, in the sense that every moment, according to him, has a logical necessity: and he triumphed by means of his fundamentally logical instinct over a like conformation of the world.

\*\*\*

But his case is exceptional. If every *fundamental trait of character,* which lies beneath every act, and which finds expression in every act, were recognised by the individual as *his* fundamental trait of character, this individual would be driven to regard every moment of his existence in general, triumphantly as good. It would simply be necessary for that fundamental trait of character to be felt in oneself as something good, valuable, and pleasurable.

\*\*\*

Now, in the case of those men and classes of men who were treated with violence and oppressed by their fellows, *morality* saved life from despair and from the leap into nonentity:. for impotence in relation to mankind and *not* in relation to Nature is what generates the most desperate bitterness towards existence. Morality treated the powerful, the violent, and the "masters" in general, as enemies against whom the common man must be protected—*that is to say, emboldened, strengthened.* Morality has therefore always taught the most profound *hatred* and *contempt* of the fundamental trait of character of all rulers—*i.e., their Will to Power.* To suppress, to deny, and to decompose this morality, would mean to regard this most thoroughly detested instinct with the reverse of the old feeling and valuation. If the sufferer and the oppressed man were *to lose his belief* in his right to contemn the Will to Power, his position would be desperate. This would be so if the trait above-mentioned were essential to life, in which case it would follow that even that will to morality was only a cloak to this "Will to Power," as are also even that hatred and contempt. The oppressed man would then perceive that he stands *on the same platform* with the oppressor, and that he has no individual privilege, nor any *higher rank* than the latter.

\*\*\*

On the *contrary*\! There is nothing on earth which can have any value, if it have not a modicum of power—granted, of course, that life itself is the Will to Power. Morality protected the *botched* and *bungled* against Nihilism, in that it gave every one of them infinite worth, metaphysical worth, and classed them altogether in one order which did not correspond with that of worldly power and order of rank: it taught submission, humility, etc. *Admitting that the belief in this morality be destroyed,* the botched and the bungled would no longer have any comfort, and would perish.

This *perishing* seems like *self-annihilation,* like an instinctive selection of that which must be destroyed. The *symptoms* of this self-destruction of the botched and the bungled: self-vivisection, poisoning, intoxication, romanticism, and, above all, the instinctive constraint to acts whereby the powerful are made into *mortal enemies* \(training, so to speak, one's own hangmen\), *the will to destruction* as the will of a still deeper instinct—of the instinct of self-destruction, of the Will to Nonentity.

\*\*\*

Nihilism is a sign that the botched and bungled in order to be destroyed, that, having been deprived of morality, they no longer have any reason to "resign themselves," that they take up their stand on the territory of the opposite principle, and *will also exercise power* themselves, by compelling the powerful to become their hangmen. This is the European form of Buddhism, that *active negation,* after all existence has lost its meaning.

\*\*\*

It must not be supposed that "poverty" has grown more acute, on the contrary\! "God, morality, resignation" were remedies in the very deepest stages of misery: *active* Nihilism made its appearance in circumstances which were relatively much more favourable. The fact, alone, that morality is regarded as overcome, presupposes a certain degree of intellectual culture; while this very culture, for its part, bears evidence to a certain relative well-being. A certain intellectual fatigue, brought on by the long struggle concerning philosophical opinions, and carried to hopeless scepticism *against* philosophy, shows moreover that the level of these Nihilists is by no means a low one. Only think of the conditions in which Buddha appeared\! The teaching of the eternal recurrence would have learned principles to go upon \(just as Buddha's teaching, for instance, had the notion of causality, etc.\).

\*\*\*

What do we mean to-day by the words "botched and bungled"? In the first place, they are used *physiologically* and not politically. The unhealthiest kind of man all over Europe \(in all classes\) is the soil out of which Nihilism grows: this species of man will regard eternal recurrence as damnation—once he is bitten by the thought, he can no longer recoil before any action. He would not extirpate passively, but would cause everything to be extirpated which is meaningless and without a goal to this extent; although it is only a spasm, or sort of blind rage in the presence of the fact that everything has existed again and again for an eternity—even this period of Nihilism and destruction. The value of such a *crisis* is that it *purifies,* that it unites similar elements, and makes them mutually destructive, that it assigns common duties to men of opposite persuasions, and brings the weaker and more uncertain among them to the light, thus taking the first step towards a new *order of rank* among forces from the standpoint of health: recognising commanders as commanders, subordinates as subordinates. Naturally irrespective of all the present forms of society.

\*\*\*

What class of men will prove they are strongest in this new order of things? The most moderate—they who do not *require* any extreme forms of belief, they who not only admit of, but actually like, a certain modicum of chance and nonsense; they who can think of man with a very moderate view of his value, without becoming weak and small on that account; the most rich in health, who are able to withstand a maximum amount of sorrow, and who are therefore not so very much afraid of sorrow—men who are *certain of their power,* and who represent with conscious pride the state of strength to which man has attained.

\*\*\*

How could such a man think of Eternal Recurrence?



56.

*The Periods of European Nihilism.*

*The Period of Obscurity*: all kinds of groping measures devised to preserve old institutions and not to arrest the progress of new ones.

*The Period of Light*: men see that old and new are fundamental contraries; that the old values are born of descending life, and that the new ones are born of ascending life—*that all old ideals* are unfriendly to life \(born of decadence and determining it, however much they may be decked out in the Sunday finery of morality\). We *understand* the old, but are far from being sufficiently strong for the new.

*The Periods of the Three Great Passions*: contempt, pity, destruction.

*The Periods of Catastrophes*: the rise of a teaching which will sift mankind ... which drives the weak to some decision and the strong also.

## 2 HISTORY OF EUROPEAN NIHILISM
**II.**

**CONCERNING THE HISTORY OF EUROPEAN NIHILISM.**

* * *

*\(a\)* Modern Gloominess.



57.

My friends, we had a hard time as youths; we even suffered from youth itself as though it were a serious disease. This is owing to the age in which we were born—an age of enormous internal decay and disintegration which, with all its weakness and even with the best of its strength, is opposed to the spirit of youth. Disintegration—that is to say, uncertainty—is peculiar to this age: nothing stands on solid ground or on a sound faith. People live for the morrow, because the day-after-to-morrow is doubtful. All our road is slippery and dangerous, while the ice which still bears us has grown unconscionably thin: we all feel the mild and gruesome breath of the thaw-wind—soon, where we are walking, no one will any longer *be able* to stand\!



58.

If this is not an age of decay and of diminishing vitality, it is at least one of indiscriminate and arbitrary experimentalising—and it is probable that out of an excess of abortive experiments there has grown this general impression, as of decay: and perhaps decay itself.

*Concerning the history of modern gloominess.*

The state-nomads \(officials, etc.\): "homeless"—.

The break-up of the family.

The "good man" as a symptom of exhaustion.

Justice as Will to Power \(Rearing\).

Lewdness and neurosis.

Black music: whither has real music gone?

The anarchist.

Contempt of man, loathing.

Most profound distinction: whether hunger or satiety is creative? The first creates the *Ideals of Romanticism.*

Northern unnaturalness.

The need of Alcohol: the "need" of the working classes.

Philosophical Nihilism.



60.

The slow advance and rise of the middle and lower classes \(including the lower kind of spirit and body\), which was already well under way before the French Revolution, and would have made the same progress forward without the latter,—in short, then, the preponderance of the herd over all herdsmen and bell-wethers,—brings in its train:—

\(1\) Gloominess of spirit \(the juxtaposition of a stoical and a frivolous *appearance* of happiness, peculiar to noble cultures, is on the decline; much suffering is allowed to be *seen* and *heard* which formerly was borne in concealment\);

\(2\) Moral hypocrisy \(a way of *distinguishing* oneself through morality, but by means of the values of the herd: pity, solicitude, moderation; and not by means of those virtues which are recognised and honoured outside the herd's sphere of power\);

\(3\) A *really* large amount of sympathy with both pain and joy \(a feeling of pleasure resulting from being herded together, which is peculiar to all gregarious animals—"public spirit," "patriotism," everything, in fact, which is apart from the individual\).



61.

Our age, with its indiscriminate endeavours to mitigate distress, to honour it, and to wage war in advance with unpleasant possibilities, is an age of the *poor.* Our "*rich people*"—*they* are the poorest\! The real *purpose* of all wealth has been forgotten.



62.

*Criticism of modern man*:—"the good man," but corrupted and misled by bad institutions \(tyrants and priests\);—reason elevated to a position of authority;—history is regarded as the surmounting of errors;—the future is regarded as progress;—the Christian state \("God of the armies"\);—Christian sexual intercourse \(as marriage\);—the realm of "justice" \(the cult of "mankind"\);—"freedom."

The *romantic* attitudes of the modern man;—the noble man \(Byron, Victor Hugo, George Sand\);—taking the part of the oppressed and the bungled and the botched: motto for historians and romancers;—the Stoics of duty;—disinterestedness regarded as art and as knowledge;—altruism as the most mendacious form of egoism \(utilitarianism\), the most sentimental form of egoism.

All this savours of the eighteenth century. But it had other qualities which were not inherited, namely, a certain *insouciance,* cheerfulness, elegance, spiritual clearness. The spiritual tempo has altered; the pleasure which was begotten by spiritual refinement and clearness has given room to the pleasure of colour, harmony, mass, reality, etc. etc. Sensuality in spiritual things. In short, it is the eighteenth century of Rousseau.



63.

Taken all in all, a considerable amount of *humanity* has been attained by our men of to-day. That we feel this is in itself a proof of the fact that we have become so sensitive in regard to small cases of distress, that we somewhat unjustly overlook what has been achieved.

Here we must make allowances for the fact that a great deal of decadence is rife, and that, through such eyes, our world *must appear* bad and wretched. But these eyes have always seen in the same way, in all ages.

\(1\) A certain hypersensitiveness, even in morality.

\(2\) The quantum of bitterness and gloominess, which pessimism bears with it in its judgments—both together have helped to bring about the preponderance of the other and *opposite* point of view, that things are not well with our morality.

The fact of credit, of the commerce of the world, and the means of traffic—are expressions of an extraordinarily mild *trustfulness* in men.... To that may also be added—

\(3\) The deliverance of science from moral and religious prejudices: a very good sign, though for the most part misunderstood.

In my own way, I am attempting a justification of history.



64.

*The second appearance of Buddhism.*—Its precursory signs: the increase of pity. Spiritual exhaustion. The reduction of all problems to the question of pleasure and pain. The glory of war which calls forth a counter-stroke. Just as the sharp demarcation of nations generates a counter-movement in the form of the most hearty "Fraternity." The fact that it is impossible for religion to carry on its work any longer with dogma and fables.

The *catastrophe of Nihilism* will put an end to all this Buddhistic culture.



65.

That which is most sorely afflicted to-day is the instinct and will of *tradition*: all institutions which owe their origin to this instinct, are opposed to the tastes of the age.... At bottom, nothing is thought or done which is not calculated to tear up this spirit of tradition by the roots. Tradition is looked upon as a fatality; it is studied and acknowledged \(in the form of "heredity"\), but people will not have anything to do with it. The extension of one will over long periods of time, the selection of conditions and valuations which make it possible to dispose of centuries in advance—this, precisely, is what is most utterly anti-modern. From which it follows, that disorganising principles give our age its specific character.



66.

"Be simple"—a demand which, when made to us complicated and incomprehensible triers of the heart and reins, is a simple absurdity.... Be natural: but even if we are unnatural—what then?



67.

The means employed in former times in order to arrive at *similarly constituted* and lasting types, throughout long generations: entailed property and the respect of parents \(the origin of the faith in gods and heroes as ancestors\).

Now, the *subdivision of property* belongs to the opposite tendency. The centralisation of an enormous number of, different interests in one soul: which, *to that end,* must be very strong and mutable.





68.

Why does everything become *mummery.*—The modern man is lacking in unfailing instinct \(instinct being understood here to mean that which is the outcome of a *long period of activity in the same occupation* on the part of one family of men\); the incapability of producing anything perfect, is simply the result of this lack of instinct: one individual alone cannot make up for the schooling his ancestors should have transmitted to him.

What a morality or book of law creates: that deep instinct which renders *automatism* and perfection possible in life and in work.

But now we have reached the opposite point; yes, we wanted to reach it—the most extreme consciousness, through introspection on the part of man and of history: and thus we are practically most distant from perfection in Being, doing, and willing: our desires—even our will to knowledge—shows how prodigiously decadent we are. We are striving after the very reverse of what *strong races* and *strong natures* will have—understanding is an *end*....

That Science is possible in the way in which it is practised to-day, proves that all elementary instincts, *the instincts which ward off danger and protect life,* are no longer active. We no longer save, we are merely spending the capital of our forefathers, even in the way in which we *pursue knowledge*.



69.

*Nihilistic trait*.

*\(a\)* In the *natural sciences* \("purposelessness"\), causality, mechanism, "conformity to law," an interval, a remnant.

*\(b\)* Likewise in *politics*: the individual lacks the belief in his own right, innocence; falsehood rules supreme, as also the worship of the moment.

*\(d\)* Likewise in *political economy*: the abolition of slavery: the lack of a redeeming class, and of *one who justifies*—the rise of anarchy. "Education"?

*\(d\)* Likewise in *history*: fatalism, Darwinism; the last attempts at reconciling reason and Godliness fail. Sentimentality in regard to the past: biographies can no longer be endured\! \(Phenomenalism even here: character regarded as a mask; there are no facts.\)

*\(e\)* Likewise in *Art*: romanticism and its *counter-stroke* \(repugnance towards romantic ideals and lies\). The latter, morally, as a sense of greatest truthfulness, but pessimistic. Pure "artists" \(indifference as to the "subject"\). \(The psychology of the father-confessor and puritanical psychology—two forms of psychological romanticism: but also their counter-stroke, the attempt to maintain a purely artistic attitude towards "men"—but even in this respect no one dares to make the *opposite* valuation.\)



70.

*Against* the teaching of the influence of *environment* and external causes: the power coming from inside is infinitely *superior*; much that appears like influence acting from without is merely the subjection of environment to this inner power.

Precisely the same environment may be used and interpreted in opposite ways: there are no facts. A genius is *not* explained by such theories concerning origins.



71.

"*Modernity*" regarded in the light of nutrition and digestion.

Sensitiveness is infinitely more acute \(beneath moral vestments: the increase of pity\), the abundance of different impressions is greater than ever. The *cosmopolitanism* of articles of diet, of literature, newspapers, forms, tastes, and even landscapes. The speed of this affluence is *prestissimo*; impressions are wiped out, and people instinctively guard against assimilating anything or against taking anything *seriously* and "digesting" it; the result is a weakening of the powers of digestion. There begin a sort of *adaptation* to this accumulation of impressions. Man unlearns the art of *doing,* and *all he does is to react* to stimuli coming from his environment. *He spends his strength,* partly in the process of *assimilation,* partly in *defending himself,* and again partly in *responding to stimuli. Profound enfeeblement of spontaneity*:—the historian, the critic, the analyst, the interpreter, the observer, the collector, the reader,—all reactive talents,—*all* science\!

Artificial *modification* of one's own nature in order to make it resemble a "mirror"; one is interested, but only epidermally: this is systematic coolness, equilibrium, a steady *low* temperature,  just beneath the thin surface on which warmth, movement, "storm," and undulations play.

Opposition of *external* mobility to a certain *dead heaviness and fatigue*.



72.

Where must our modern world be classed—under exhaustion or under increasing strength? Its multiformity and lack of repose are brought about by the highest form of *consciousness.*



73.

Overwork, curiosity and sympathy—our *modern vices.*



74.

A contribution to the characterisation of "*Modernity.*"—Exaggerated development of intermediate forms; the decay of types; the break-up of tradition, schools; the predominance of the instincts \(philosophically prepared: the unconscious has the greater value\) after the appearance of the *enfeeblement of will power* and of the will to an end *and* to the means thereto.



75.

A capable artisan or scholar cuts a good figure if he have his pride in his art, and looks pleasantly and contentedly upon life. On the other hand, there is no sight more wretched than that of a cobbler or a schoolmaster who, with the air of a martyr, gives one to understand that he was really born for something better. There is nothing better than what is good\! and that is: to have a certain kind of capacity and to use it. This is *virtù* in the Italian style of the Renaissance.

Nowadays, when the state has a nonsensically oversized belly, in all fields and branches of work there are "representatives" over and above the real workman: for instance, in addition to the scholars, there are the journalists; in addition to the suffering masses, there is a crowd of jabbering and bragging ne'er-do-wells who "represent" that suffering—not to speak of the professional politicians who, though quite satisfied with their lot, stand up in Parliament and, with strong lungs, "represent" grievances. Our modern life is extremely *expensive,* thanks to the host of middlemen that infest it; whereas in the city of antiquity, and in many a city of Spain and Italy to-day, where there is an echo of the ancient spirit, the man himself comes forward and will have nothing to do with a representative or an intermediary in the modern style—except perhaps to kick him hence\!



76.

The pre-eminence of the *merchant* and the *middleman,* even in the most intellectual spheres: the journalist, the "representative," the historian \(as an intermediary between the past and the present\), the exotic and cosmopolitan, the middleman between natural science and philosophy, the semi-theologians.





77.

The men I have regarded with the most loathing, heretofore, are the parasites of intellect: they are to be found everywhere, already, in our modern Europe, and as a matter of fact their conscience is as light as it possibly can be. They may be a little turbid, and savour somewhat of Pessimism, but in the main they are voracious, dirty, dirtying, stealthy, insinuating, light-fingered gentry, scabby—and as innocent as all small sinners and microbes are. They live at the expense of those who have intellect and who distribute it liberally: they know that it is peculiar to the rich mind to live in a disinterested fashion, without taking too much petty thought for the morrow, and to distribute its wealth prodigally. For intellect is a bad domestic economist, and pays no heed whatever to the fact that everything lives on it and devours it.



78.

Modern Mummery

The motleyness of modern men and its charm Essentially a mask and a sign of boredom.

The journalist.

The political man \(in the "national swindle"\).

Mummery in the arts:—
> 
> 
> The lack of honesty in preparing and schooling oneself for them \(Fromentin\);

> The Romanticists \(their lack of philosophy and science and their excess in literature\);

> The novelists \(Walter Scott, but also the monsters of the *Nibelung,* with their inordinately nervous music\);

> The lyricists.


"Scientifically."

Virtuosos \(Jews\).

The popular ideals are overcome, but not yet *in the presence of the people*:

The saint, the sage, the prophet.



79.

*The want of discipline in the modern spirit* concealed beneath all kinds of moral finery.—The show-words are: Toleration \(for the "incapacity of saying yes or no"\); *la largeur de sympathie* \(= a third of indifference, a third of curiosity, and a third of morbid susceptibility\); "objectivity" \(the lack of personality and of will, and the inability to "love"\); "freedom" in regard to the rule \(Romanticism\); "truth" as opposed to falsehood and lying \(Naturalism\); the "scientific spirit" \(the "human document": or, in plain English, the serial story which means "addition"—instead of "composition"\); "passion" in the place of disorder and intemperance; "depth" in the place of confusion and the pell-mell of symbols.



80.

*Concerning the criticism of big words.*—I am full of mistrust and malice towards what is called "ideal": this is my *Pessimism,* that I have recognised to what extent "sublime sentiments" are a source of evil—that is to say, a belittling and depreciating of man.

Every time "progress" is expected to result from an ideal, disappointment invariably follows; the triumph of an ideal has always been a *retrograde movement*.

Christianity, revolution, the abolition of slavery, equal rights, philanthropy, love of peace, justice, truth: all these big words are only valuable in a struggle, as banners: not as realities, but as *show-words,* for something quite different \(yea, even quite opposed to what they mean\!\).



81.

The kind of man is known who has fallen in love with the sentence "*tout comprendre à est tout pardonner"* It is the weak and, above all, the disillusioned: if there is something to pardon in everything, there is also something to contemn\! It is the philosophy of disappointment, which here swathes itself so humanly in pity, and gazes out so sweetly.

They are Romanticists, whose faith has gone to pot: now they at least wish to look on and see how everything vanishes and fades. They call it *l'art pour l'art,* "objectivity," etc.



82.

*The main symptoms of Pessimism*:—Dinners at Magny's; Russian Pessimism \(Tolstoy, Dostoiewsky\); æsthetic Pessimism, *l'art pour l'art,* "description" \(the romantic and the anti-romantic Pessimism\); Pessimism in the theory of knowledge \(Schopenhauer: phenomenalism\); anarchical Pessimism; the "religion of pity," Buddhistic preparation; the Pessimism of culture \(exoticness, cosmopolitanism\); moral Pessimism, myself.



83.

"*Without the Christian Faith*" said Pascal, "you would yourselves be like nature and history, *un monstre et un chaos.*" We fulfilled this prophecy: once the weak and optimistic eighteenth century had *embellished* and *rationalised* man.

*Schopenhauer* and *Pascal.*—I none essential point, Schopenhauer is the first who *takes up Pascal's* movement again: *un monstre et un chaos,* consequently something that must be negatived ... history, nature, and man himself\!

"*Our inability to know the truth* is the result of our *corruption,* of our moral *decay*" says Pascal. And Schopenhauer says essentially the same. "The more profound the corruption of reason is, the more necessary is the doctrine of salvation"—or, putting it into Schopenhauerian phraseology, negation.



84.

*Schopenhauer as an epigone* \(state of affairs before the Revolution\):—Pity, sensuality, art, weakness of will, Catholicism of the most intellectual desires—that is, at bottom, the good old eighteenth century.

*Schopenhauer's* fundamental misunderstanding of the *will* \(just as though passion, instinct, and desire were the essential factors of will\) is typical: the depreciation of the will to the extent of mistaking it altogether. Likewise the hatred of willing: the attempt at seeing something superior—yea, even superiority itself, and that which really matters, in non-willing, in the "subject-being *without* aim or intention." Great symptom of *fatigue or of the weakness of will*: for this, in reality, is what treats the passions as master, and directs them as to the way and to the measure....



85.

The undignified attempt has been made to regard Wagner and Schopenhauer as types of the mentally unsound: an infinitely more essential understanding of the matter would have been gained if the exact decadent type which each of them represents had been scientifically and accurately defined.



86.

In my opinion, Henrik Ibsen has become very German. With all his robust idealism and "Will to Truth," he never dared to ring himself free from moral-illusionism which says "freedom," and will not admit, even to itself, what freedom is: the second stage in the metamorphosis of the "Will to Power" in him who lacks it. In the first stage, one demands justice at the hands of those who have power. In the second, one speaks of "freedom," that is to say, one wishes to "shake oneself free" from those who have power. In the third stage, one speaks of "equal rights"—that is to say, so long as one is not a predominant personality one wishes to prevent one's competitors from growing in power.



87.

The Decline of *Protestantism*: theoretically and historically understood as a half-measure. Undeniable predominance of Catholicism to-day: Protestant feeling is so dead that the strongest *anti-Protestant* movements \(Wagner's *Parsifal,* for instance\) are no longer regarded as such. The whole of the more elevated intellectuality in France is *Catholic* in instinct; Bismarck recognised that there was no longer any such thing as Protestantism.



88.

Protestantism, that spiritually unclean and tiresome form of decadence, in which Christianity has known how to survive in the mediocre North, is something incomplete and complexly valuable for knowledge, in so far as it was able to bring experiences of different kinds and origins into the same heads.



89.

What has the German spirit not made out of Christianity\! And, to refer to Protestantism again, how much beer is there not still in Protestant Christianity\! Can a crasser, more indolent, and more lounging form of Christian belief be imagined, than that of the average German Protestant?... It is indeed a very humble Christianity. I call it the Homœopathy of Christianity\! I am reminded that, to-day, there also exists a less humble sort of Protestantism; it is taught by royal chaplains and anti-Semitic speculators: but nobody has ever maintained that any "spirit" "hovers" over these waters. It is merely a less respectable form of Christian faith, not by any means a more comprehensible one.



90.

*Progress.*—Let us be on our guard lest we deceive ourselves\! Time flies forward apace,—we would fain believe that everything flies forward with it,—that evolution is an advancing development.... That is the appearance of things which deceives the most circumspect. But the nineteenth century shows no advance whatever on the sixteenth: and the German spirit of 1888 is an example of a backward movement when compared with that of 1788.... Mankind does not advance, it does not even exist. The aspect of the whole is much more like that of a huge experimenting workshop where some things in all ages succeed, while an incalculable number of things fail; where all order, logic, co-ordination, and responsibility is lacking. How dare we blink the fact that the rise of Christianity is a decadent movement?—that the German Reformation was a recrudescence of Christian barbarism?—that the Revolution destroyed the instinct for an organisation of society on a large scale?... Man is not an example of progress as compared with animals: the tender son of culture is an abortion compared with the Arab or the Corsican; the Chinaman is a more successful type—that is to say, richer in sustaining power than the European.



* * *



*\(b\)* The Last Centuries.



91.

Gloominess and pessimistic influence necessarily follow in the wake of enlightenment. Towards 1770 a falling-off in cheerfulness was already noticeable; women, with that very feminine instinct which always defends virtue, believed that immorality was the cause of it. Galiani hit the bull's eye: he quotes Voltaire's verse:

"Un monstre gai vaut mieux  
Qu'un sentimental ennuyeux."  


If now I maintain that I am ahead, by a century or two of enlightenment, of Voltaire and Galiani—who was much more profound, how deeply must I have sunk into gloominess\! This is also true, and betimes I somewhat reluctantly manifested some caution in regard to the German and Christian narrowness and inconsistency of Schopenhauerian or, worse still, Leopardian Pessimism, and sought the most characteristic form \(Asia\). But, in order to endure that extreme Pessimism \(which here and there peeps out of my *Birth of Tragedy\),* to live alone "without God or morality," I was compelled to invent a counter-prop for myself. Perhaps I know best why man is the only animal that laughs: he alone surfers so excruciatingly that he was *compelled* to invent laughter. The unhappiest and most melancholy animal is, as might have been expected, the most cheerful.



92.

In regard to German culture, I have always had a feeling as of *decline.* The fact that I learned to know a declining form of culture has often made me *unfair* towards the whole phenomenon of European culture. The Germans always follow at some distance behind: they always go to the root of things, for instance:—



Dependance upon foreigners; *Kant*—Rousseau, the sensualists, Hume, Swedenborg.

*Schopenhauer*—the Indians and Romanticism, Voltaire.

*Wagner*—the French cult of the ugly and of grand opera, *Paris,* and the flight into *primitive barbarism* \(the marriage of brother and sister\).

The law of the *laggard* \(the provinces go to Paris, Germany goes to France\).

How is it that precisely *Germans discovered the Greek* \(the more an instinct is developed, the more it is *tempted* to run for once into its opposite\).

Music is the last breath of every culture.



93.

*Renaissance and Reformation.*—What does the Renaissance prove? That the reign of the "individual" can be only a short one. The output is too great; there is not even the possibility of husbanding or of capitalising forces, and exhaustion sets in step by step. These are times when everything is *squandered,* when even the strength itself with which one collects, capitalises, and heaps riches upon riches, *is squandered.* Even the opponents of such movements are driven to preposterous extremes in the dissipation of their strength: and they too are very soon exhausted, used up, and completely sapped.

In the Reformation we are face to face with a wild and plebeian counterpart of the Italian Renaissance, generated by similar impulses, except that the former, in the backward and still vulgar North, had to assume a religious form—there the concept of a higher life had not yet been divorced from that of a religious one.

Even the Reformation was a movement for individual liberty; "every one his own priest" is really no more than a formula for *libertinage.* As a matter of fact, the words "Evangelical freedom" would have sufficed—and all instincts which had reasons for remaining concealed broke out like wild hounds, the most brutal needs suddenly acquired the courage to show themselves, everything seemed justified ... men refused to specify the kind of freedom they had aimed at, they preferred to shut their eyes. But the fact that their eyes were closed and that their lips were moistened with gushing orations, did not prevent their hands from being ready to snatch at whatever there was to snatch at, that the belly became the god of the "free gospel," and that all lusts of revenge and of hatred were indulged with insatiable fury.

This lasted for a while: then exhaustion supervened, just as it had done in Southern Europe; and again here, it was a low form of exhaustion, a sort of general *ruere in servitium*.... Then the *disreputable* century of Germany dawned.



94.

*Chivalry*—the position won by power: its gradual break-up \(and partial transference to broader and more bourgeois spheres\). In the case of Larochefoucauld we find a knowledge of the actual impulses of a noble temperament—together with the gloomy Christian estimate of these impulses.

The *protraction of Christianity* through the *French Revolution.* The seducer is Rousseau; he once again liberates woman, who thenceforward is always represented as ever more interesting—*suffering.* Then come the slaves and Mrs. Beecher-Stowe. Then the poor and the workmen. Then the vicious and the sick—all this is drawn into the foreground \(even for the purpose of disposing people in favour of the genius, it has been customary for five hundred years to press him forward as the great sufferer\!\). Then comes the cursing of all voluptuousness \(Baudelaire and Schopenhauer\), the most decided conviction that the lust of power is the greatest vice; absolute certainty that morality and disinterestedness are identical things; that the "happiness of all" is a goal worth striving after \(*i.e.,* Christ's Kingdom of Heaven\). We are on the best road to it: the Kingdom of Heaven of the poor in spirit has begun.—Intermediate stages: the bourgeois \(as a result of the *nouveau riche*\) and the workman \(as a result of the machine\).

Greek and French culture of the time of Louis XIV. compared. A decided belief in oneself. A leisure-class which makes things hard for itself and exercises a great deal of self-control. The power of form, the will to form *oneself.* "Happiness" acknowledged as a purpose. Much strength and energy *behind* all formality of manners. Pleasure at the sight of a life that is *seemingly so easy.* The *Greeks* seemed like *children* to the French.



95.

*The Three Centuries.*

Their different kinds of *sensitiveness* may perhaps be best expressed as follows:—

*Aristocracy*: Descartes, the reign of *reason,* evidence showing the sovereignty of the *will*.

*Feminism*: Rousseau, the reign of *feeling,* evidence showing the sovereignty of the senses; all lies.

*Animalism*: Schopenhauer, the reign of *passion,* evidence showing the sovereignty of animality, more honest, but gloomy.

The seventeenth century is *aristocratic,* all for order, haughty towards everything animal, severe in regard to the heart, "austere," and even free from sentiment, "non-German," averse to all that is  burlesque and natural, generalising and maintaining an attitude of sovereignty towards the past for it believes in itself. At bottom it partakes very much of the beast of prey, and practises asceticism in order to remain master. It is the century of strength of will, as also that of strong passion.

The eighteenth century is dominated by *woman,* it is gushing, spiritual, and flat; but with intellect at the service of aspirations and of the heart, it is a libertine in the pleasures of intellect, undermining all authorities; emotionally intoxicated, cheerful, clear, humane, and sociable, false to itself and at bottom very rascally....

The nineteenth century is more *animal,* more subterranean, hateful, realistic, plebeian, and on that very account "better," "more honest," more submissive to "reality" of what kind soever, and *truer*; but weak of will, sad, obscurely exacting and fatalistic. It has no feeling of timidity or reverence, either in the presence of "reason" or the "heart"; thoroughly convinced of the dominion of the desires \(Schopenhauer said "Will," but nothing is more characteristic of his philosophy than that it entirely lacks all actual *willing*\). Even morality is reduced to an instinct \("Pity"\).

Auguste Comte is *the continuation of the* eighteenth *century* \(the dominion of the heart over the head, sensuality in the theory of knowledge, altruistic exaltation\).

The fact that *science* has become as sovereign as it is to-day, proves how the nineteenth century has *emancipated itself* from the dominion of *ideals.* A certain absence of "needs" and wishes makes our scientific curiosity and rigour possible—this is our kind of virtue.

Romanticism is the *counterstroke* of the eighteenth century; a sort of accumulated longing for its grand style of exaltation \(as a matter of fact, largely mingled with mummery and self-deception: the desire was to represent *strong nature* and *strong passion*\).

The nineteenth century instinctively goes in search of *theories* by means of which it may feel its *fatalistic, submission to the empire of facts* justified. Hegel's success against sentimentality and romantic idealism was already a sign of its fatalistic trend of thought, in its belief that superior reason belongs to the triumphant side, and in its justification of the actual "state" \(in the place of "humanity," etc.\).—Schopenhauer: we are something foolish, and at the best self-suppressive. The success of determinism, the genealogical derivation of *obligations* which were formerly held to be absolute, the teaching of environment and adaptation, the reduction of will to a process of reflex movement, the denial of the will as a "working cause"; finally—a real process of re-christening: so little will is observed that the word itself becomes *available* for another purpose. Further theories: the teaching of *objectivity,* "will-less" contemplation, as the only road to truth, *as also* to *beauty* \(also the belief in "genius," in order to have *the right to be submissive*\); mechanism, the determinable rigidity of the mechanical process; so-called "Naturalism," the elimination of the choosing, directing, interpreting subject, on principle.

Kant, with his "practical reason," with his *moral fanaticism,* is quite eighteenth century style; still completely outside the historical movement, without any notion whatsoever of the reality of his time, for instance, revolution; he is not affected by Greek philosophy; he is a phantasist of the notion of duty, a sensualist with a hidden leaning to dogmatic pampering.

*The return to Kant* in our century means a *return to the eighteenth century,* people desire to create themselves a right to the *old ideas* and to the old exaltation—hence a theory of knowledge which "describes limits," that is to say, which admits *of the option of fixing a Beyond to the domain of reason.*

*Hegel's* way of thinking is not so very far removed from that of Goethe: see the latter on the subject of Spinoza, for instance. The will to deify the All and Life, in order to find both *peace* and *happiness* in contemplating them: Hegel looks for reason everywhere—in the presence of reason man may be *submissive* and resigned. In Goethe we find a kind of *fatalism* which is almost *joyous* and *confiding,* which neither revolts nor weakens, which strives to make a totality out of itself, in the belief that only in totality does everything seem good and justified, and find itself resolved.



96.

The period of *rationalism*—followed by a period of *sentimentality.* To what extent does Schopenhauer come under "sentimentality"? \(Hegel under intellectuality?\)



97.

The seventeenth century *suffers* from *humanity* as from a *host of contradictions* \("*l'amas de contradictions*" that we are\); it endeavours to discover man, to *co-ordinate him,* to excavate him: whereas the eighteenth century tries to forget what is known of man's nature, in order to adapt him to its Utopia. "Superficial, soft, humane"—gushes over "humanity."

The seventeenth century tries to banish all traces of the individual in order that the artist's work may resemble life as much as possible. The eighteenth century strives *to create interest in the author* by means of the work. The seventeenth century seeks art in art, a piece of culture; the eighteenth uses art in its propaganda for political and social reforms.

"Utopia," the "ideal man," the deification of Nature, the vanity of making one's own personality the centre of interest, subordination to the propaganda of *social ideas,* charlatanism—all this we derive from the eighteenth century.

The style of the seventeenth century: *propre exact et libre.*

The strong individual who is self-sufficient, or who appeals ardently to God—and that obtrusiveness and indiscretion of modern authors—these things are *opposites.* "Showing-oneself-off"—what a contrast to the Scholars of Port-Royal\!

Alfieri had a sense for the *grand style.*

The hate of the *burlesque* \(that which lacks dignity\), *the lack of a sense of Nature* belongs to the seventeenth century.



98.

*Against Rousseau.—Alas\!* man is no longer sufficiently evil; Rousseau's opponents, who say that "man is a beast of prey," are unfortunately wrong. Not the corruption of man, but the softening and moralising of him is the curse. In the sphere which Rousseau attacked most violently, the *relatively* strongest and most successful type of man was still to be found \(the type which still possessed the great passions intact: Will to Power, Will to Pleasure, the Will and Ability to Command\). The man of the eighteenth century must be compared with the man of the Renaissance \(also with the man of the seventeenth century in France\) if the matter is to be understood at all: Rousseau is a symptom of self-contempt and of inflamed vanity—both signs that the dominating will is lacking: he moralises and seeks the *cause* of his own misery after the style of a revengeful man in the *ruling* classes.



99.

*Voltaire—Rousseau.*—A state of nature is terrible; man is a beast of prey: our civilisation is an extraordinary *triumph* over this beast of prey in nature—this was *Voltaires* conclusion. He was conscious of the mildness, the refinements, the intellectual joys of the civilised state; he despised obtuseness, even in the form of virtue, and the lack of delicacy even in ascetics and monks.

The *moral depravity* of man seemed to pre-occupy *Rousseau*; the words "unjust," "cruel," are the best possible for the purpose of exciting the instincts of the oppressed, who otherwise find themselves under the ban of the *vetitum* and of disgrace; *so that their conscience is opposed to their indulging any insurrectional desires.* These emancipators seek one thing above all: to give their party the great accents and attitudes of *higher Nature*.



100.

*Rousseau*; the rule founded on sentiment; Nature as the source of justice; man perfects himself in proportion as he approaches *Nature* \(according to Voltaire, in proportion *as he leaves Nature behind*\). The very same periods seem to the one to demonstrate the progress of *humanity* and, to the other, the increase of injustice and inequality.

Voltaire, who still understood *umanità* in the sense of the Renaissance, as also *virtù* \(as "higher culture"\), fights for the cause of the "*honnêtes gens*" "*la bonne compagnie*" taste, science, arts, and even for the cause of progress and civilisation.

*The flare-up occurred towards 1760*: On the one hand the citizen of Geneva, on the other *le seigneur de Ferney.* It is only from that moment and henceforward that Voltaire was the man of his age, the philosopher, the representative of Toleration and of Disbelief \(theretofore he had been merely *un bel esprit*\). His envy and hatred of Rousseau's success forced him upwards.

"*Pour 'la canaille' un dieu rémunérateur et vengeur*"—Voltaire.

The criticism of both standpoints in regard to the *value of civilisation.* To Voltaire nothing seems finer than the *social invention*: there is no higher goal than to uphold and perfect it. *L'honnêteté* consists precisely in respecting social usage; virtue in a certain obedience towards various necessary "prejudices" which favour the maintenance of society. *Missionary of Culture,* aristocrat, representative of the triumphant and ruling classes and their values. But Rousseau remained a *plebeian,* even as *hommes de lettres,* this was *preposterous*; his shameless contempt for everything that was not himself.

The *morbid feature* in Rousseau is the one which happens to have been most admired and *imitated.* \(Lord Byron resembled him somewhat, he too screwed himself up to sublime attitudes and to revengeful rage—a sign of vulgarity; later on, when Venice restored his equilibrium, he understood what *alleviates most* and does the *most good ... l'insouciance*.\)

In spite of his antecedents, Rousseau is proud of himself; but he is incensed if he is reminded of his origin....

In Rousseau there was undoubtedly some brain trouble; in Voltaire—rare health and lightsomeness. *The revengefulness of the sick*; his periods of insanity as also those of his contempt of man, and of his mistrust.

Rousseau's defence of *Providence* \(against Voltaire's Pessimism\): he *had need of* God in order to be able to curse society and civilisation; everything must be good *per se,* because God had created it; man *alone has corrupted man.* The "good man" as a man of Nature was pure fantasy; but with the dogma of God's authorship he became something probable and even not devoid of foundation.

*Romanticism* à la *Rousseau*: passion \("the sovereign right of passion"\); "naturalness"; the fascination of madness \(foolishness reckoned as greatness\); the senseless vanity of the weak; the revengefulness of the masses elevated to the position of *justice* \("in politics, for one hundred years, the leader has always been this invalid"\).



101.

*Kant*: makes the scepticism of Englishmen, in regard to the theory of knowledge, *possible* for Germans.

\(1\) By enlisting in its cause the interest of the German's religious and moral needs: just as the new academicians used scepticism for the same reasons, as a preparation for Platonism \(*vide* Augustine\); just as Pascal even used *moral* scepticism in order to provoke \(to justify\) the need of belief;

\(2\) By complicating and entangling it with scholastic flourishes in view of making it more acceptable to the German's scientific taste in form \(for Locke and Hume, alone, were too illuminating, too clear—that is to say, judged according to the German valuing instinct, "too superficial"\).

*Kant*: a poor psychologist and mediocre judge of human nature, made hopeless mistakes in regard to great historical values \(the French Revolution\); a moral fanatic *à la* Rousseau; with a subterranean current of Christian values; a thorough dogmatist, but bored to extinction by this tendency, to the extent of wishing to tyrannise over it, but quickly tired, even of 'scepticism; and not yet affected by any cosmopolitan thought or antique beauty ... a *dawdler* and a *go-between,* not at all original \(like *Leibnitz,* something between mechanism and spiritualism; like *Goethe,* something between the taste of the eighteenth century and that of the "historical sense" \[which *is* essentially a sense of exoticism\]; like *German music,* between French and Italian music; like Charles the Great, who mediated and built bridges between the Roman Empire and Nationalism—a dawdler *par excellence*\).



102.

In what respect have the *Christian* centuries with their Pessimism been *stronger* centuries than the eighteenth—and how do they correspond with the *tragic* age of the Greeks?

The nineteenth century *versus* the eighteenth. How was it an heir?—how was it a step backwards from the latter? \(more lacking in "spirit" and in taste\)—how did it show an advance on the latter? \(more gloomy, more realistic, *stronger*\).



103.

How can we *explain* the fact that we feel something in common with the *Campagna romana?* And the high mountain chain?

Chateaubriand in a letter to M. de Fontanes in 1803 writes his first impression of the *Campagna romana.*

The President de Brosses says of the *Campagna romana*: "Il fallait que Romulus fût ivre quand il songea à bâtir une ville dans un terrain aussi laid."

Even Delacroix would have nothing to do with Rome, it frightened him. He loved Venice, just as Shakespeare, Byron, and Georges Sand did. Théophile Gautier's and Richard Wagner's dislike of Rome must not be forgotten.

Lamartine has the language for Sorrento and Posilippo.

Victor Hugo raves about Spain, "parce que aucune autre nation n'a moins emprunté à l'antiquité, parce qu'elle n'a subi aucune influence classique."



104.

The *two great attempts* that were made to overcome the eighteenth century:

*Napoleon,* in that he called man, the soldier, and the great struggle for power, to life again, and conceived Europe as a political power.

*Goethe,* in that he imagined a European culture which would consist of the whole heritage of what humanity had *attained to* up to his time.

German culture in this century inspires mistrust—the music of the period lacks that complete element which liberates and binds as well, to wit—Goethe.

The pre-eminence of *music* in the romanticists of 1830 and 1840. Delacroix. Ingres—a passionate musician \(admired Gluck, Haydn, Beethoven, Mozart\), said to his pupils in Rome: "Si je pouvais vous rendre tous musiciens, vous y gagneriez comme peintres"—likewise Horace Vernet, who was particularly fond of Don Juan \(as Mendelssohn assures us, 1831\); Stendhal, too, who says of himself: "Combien de lieues ne ferais-je pas à pied, et à combien de jours de prison ne me soumetterais-je pas pour entendre *Don Juan ou le Matrimonio segreto*; et je ne sais pour quelle autre chose je ferais cet effort." He was then fifty-six years old.

The borrowed forms, for instance: Brahms as a typical "Epigone," likewise Mendelssohn's cultured Protestantism \(a former "soul" is turned into poetry posthumously ...\)

—the moral and poetical substitutions in Wagner, who used *one* art as a stop-gap to make up for what another lacked.

—the "historical sense," inspiration derived from poems, sagas.

—that characteristic transformation of which G. Flaubert is the most striking example among Frenchmen, and Richard Wagner the most striking example among Germans, shows how the romantic belief in love and the future changes into a longing for nonentity in 1830-50.



106.

How is it that German music reaches its culminating point in the age of German romanticism? How is it that German music lacks Goethe? On the other hand, how much Schiller, or more exactly, how much "Thekla"\[5\] is there not in Beethoven\!

Schumann has Eichendorff, Uhland, Heine, Hoffman, Tieck, in him. Richard Wagner has Freischütz, Hoffmann, Grimm, the romantic Saga, the mystic Catholicism of instinct, symbolism, "the free-spiritedness of passion" \(Rousseau's intention\). The *Flying Dutchman* savours of France, where *le ténébreux* \(1830\) was the type of the seducer.

*The cult of music,* the revolutionary romanticism of form. Wagner *synthesises* German and French romanticism.


\[5\] Thekla is the sentimental heroine in Schiller's *Wallenstein.*—TRANSLATOR'S NOTE.




107.

From the point of view only of his value to Germany and to German culture, Richard Wagner is still a great problem, perhaps a German misfortune: in any case, however, a fatality. But what does it matter? Is he not very much more than a German event? It also seems to me that to no country on earth is he less related than to Germany; nothing was prepared there for his advent; his whole type is simply strange amongst Germans; there he stands in their midst, wonderful, misunderstood, incomprehensible. But people carefully avoid acknowledging this: they are too kind, too square-headed—too German for that. "Credo quia absurdus est": thus did the German spirit wish it to be, in this case too—hence it is content meanwhile to believe everything Richard Wagner wanted to have believed about himself. In all ages the spirit of Germany has been deficient in subtlety and divining powers concerning psychological matters. Now that it happens to be under the high pressure of patriotic nonsense and self-adoration, it is visibly growing thicker and coarser: how could it therefore be equal to the problem of Wagner\!



108.

The Germans *are* not yet anything, but they are *becoming* something; that is why they have not yet any culture;—that is why they cannot yet have any culture\!—They are not yet anything: that means they are all kinds of things. They are *becoming* something: that means that they will one day cease from being all kinds of things. The latter is at bottom only a wish, scarcely a hope yet. Fortunately it is a wish with which one can live, a question of will, of work, of discipline, a question of training, as also of resentment, of longing, of privation, of discomfort,—yea, even of bitterness,—in short, we Germans *will* get something out of ourselves, something that has not yet been wanted of us—we want something *more*\!

That this "German, as he is not as yet"—has a right to something better than the present German "culture"; that all who wish to become something better, must wax angry when they perceive a sort of contentment, an impudent "setting-oneself-at-ease," or "a process of self-censing," in this quarter: that is my second principle, in regard to which my opinions have not yet changed.



* * *



*\(c\)* Signs of Increasing Strength.



109.

First Principle: everything that characterises modern men savours of decay: but side by side with the prevailing sickness there are signs of a strength and powerfulness of soul which are still untried. *The same causes which tend to promote the belittling of men,* also force *the stronger and rarer individuals upwards to greatness.*



110.

*General survey: the ambiguous* character of our *modern world*—precisely the same symptoms might at the same time be indicative of either *decline* or *strength.* And the signs of strength and of emancipation dearly bought, might in view of traditional \(or *hereditary*\) appreciations concerned with the feelings, be *misunderstood* as indications of weakness. In short, *feeling,* as a *means of fixing valuations,* is not *on a level with the times.*

*Generalised*: Every valuation is always *backward*; it is merely the expression of the conditions which favoured survival and growth in a much earlier age: it struggles against new conditions of existence out of which it did not arise, and which it therefore necessarily misunderstands: it hinders, and excites suspicion against, all that is new.



111.

*The problem of the nineteenth century.*—To discover whether its strong and weak side belong to each other. Whether they have been cut from one and the same piece. Whether the variety of its ideals and their contradictions are conditioned by a higher purpose: whether they are something higher.—For it might be *the prerequisite of greatness,* that growth should take place amid such violent tension. Dissatisfaction, Nihilism, *might be a good sign.*



112.

*General survey.*—As a matter of fact, all abundant growth involves a concomitant process of *crumbling to bits* and *decay*: suffering and the symptoms of decline *belong* to ages of enormous progress; every fruitful and powerful movement of mankind has always *brought about* a concurrent Nihilistic movement. Under certain circumstances, the appearance of *the extremest* form of Pessimism and actual *Nihilism* might be the sign of a process of incisive and most essential growth, and of mankind's transit into completely new conditions of existence. *This is what I have understood.*





113.

*A.*

Starting out with a thoroughly courageous *appreciation* of our men of to-day:—we must not allow ourselves to be deceived by appearance: this mankind is much less effective, but it gives quite different pledges of *lasting strength,* its tempo is slower, but the rhythm itself is richer. *Healthiness* is increasing, the real conditions of a healthy body are on the point of being known, and will gradually be created, "asceticism" is regarded with irony. The fear of extremes, a certain confidence in the "right way," no raving: a periodical self-habituation to narrower values \(such as "mother-land," "science," etc.\).

This whole picture, however, would still be *ambiguous*: it might be a movement either of *increase* or *decline* in Life.

*B.*

The belief in "progress"—in lower spheres of intelligence, appears as increasing life: but this is self-deception;
> 
> 
> in higher spheres of intelligence it is a sign of *declining* life.


Description of the symptoms.

The unity of the aspect: uncertainty in regard to the standard of valuation.

Fear of a general "in vain."



Nihilism.



114.

As a matter of fact, we are no longer so urgently in need of an antidote against the first Nihilism: Life is no longer so uncertain, accidental, and senseless in modern Europe. All such tremendous *exaggeration* of the value of men, of the value of evil, etc., are not so necessary now; we can endure a considerable diminution of this value, we may grant a great deal of nonsense and accident: the *power* man has acquired now allows of a *lowering* of the means of discipline, of which the strongest was the moral interpretation of the universe. The hypothesis "God" is much too extreme.



115.

If anything shows that our *humanisation* is a genuine sign of *progress,* it is the fact that we no longer require excessive contraries, that we no longer require contraries at all....

We may love the senses; for we have spiritualised them in every way and made them artistic;

We have a right to all things which hitherto have been most *calumniated.*



116.

*The reversal of the order of rank.*—Those pious counterfeiters—the priests—are becoming Chandala in our midst:—they occupy the position of the charlatan, of the quack, of the counterfeiter, of the sorcerer: we regard them as corrupters of the will, as the great slanderers and vindictive enemies of Life, and as the *rebels* among the bungled and the botched. We have made our middle class out of our servant-caste—the Sudra—that is to say, our people or the body which wields the political power.

On the other hand, the Chandala of former times is paramount: the *blasphemers,* the *immoralists,* the independents of all kinds, the artists, the Jews, the minstrels—and, at bottom, all *disreputable* classes are in the van.

We have elevated ourselves to *honourable* thoughts,—even more, we determine what honour is on earth,—"nobility." ... All of us to-day are *advocates of life.*—We *Immoralists* are to-day the *strongest* power: the other great powers are in need of us ... we re-create the world in our own image.

We have transferred the label "Chandala" to the *priests,* the *backworldsmen,* and to the deformed *Christian society* which has become associated with these people, together with creatures of like origin, the pessimists, Nihilists, romanticists of pity, criminals, and men of vicious habits—the whole sphere in which the idea of "God" is that of *Saviour....*

We are proud of being no longer obliged to be liars, slanderers, and detractors of Life....



117.

*The advance* of the nineteenth century upon the eighteenth \(at bottom we *good Europeans* are carrying on a war against the eighteenth century\):

\(1\) "The return to Nature" is getting to be understood, ever more definitely, in a way which is quite the reverse of that in which Rousseau used the phrase—*away from idylls and operas\!*

\(2\) Ever more decided, more anti-idealistic, more objective, more fearless, more industrious, more temperate, more suspicious of sudden changes, *anti-revolutionary*;

\(3\) The question of *bodily health* is being pressed ever more decidedly in front of the health of "the soul": the latter is regarded as a condition brought about by the former, and bodily health is believed to be, at least, the prerequisite to spiritual health.



118.

If anything at all has been achieved, it is a more innocent attitude towards the senses, a happier, more favourable demeanour in regard to sensuality, resembling rather the position taken up by Goethe; a prouder feeling has also been developed in knowledge, and the "reine Thor"\[6\] meets with little faith.


\[6\] This is a reference to Wagner's *Parsifal.* The character as is well known, is written to represent a son of heart's affliction, and a child of wisdom—humble, guileless, loving, pure, and a fool.—TRANSLATOR'S NOTE.




119.

We "*objective people.*"—It is not "pity" that opens up the way for *us* to all that is most remote and most strange in life and culture; but our accessibility and ingenuousness, which precisely does not "pity," but rather takes pleasure in hundreds of things which formerly caused pain \(which in former days either outraged or moved us, or in the presence of which we were either hostile or indifferent\). Pain in all its various phases is now interesting to us: on that account we are certainly *not* the more pitiful, even though the sight of pain may shake us to our foundations and move us to tears: and we are absolutely not inclined to be more helpful in view thereof.

In this *deliberate* desire to look on at all pain and error, we have grown stronger and more powerful than in the eighteenth century; it is a proof of our increase of strength \(we have *drawn closer* to the seventeenth and sixteenth centuries\). But it is a profound mistake to regard our "romanticism" as a proof of our "beautified souls." We want *stronger* sensations than all *coarser* ages and classes have wanted. \(This fact must not be confounded with the needs of neurotics and decadents; in their case, of course, there is a craving for pepper —even for cruelty.\)

We are all seeking conditions *which are emancipated from* the bourgeois, and to a greater degree from the priestly, notion of morality \(every book which savours at all of priestdom and theology gives us the impression of pitiful *niaiserie* and mental indigence\). "Good company," in fact, finds everything insipid which is not forbidden and considered compromising in bourgeois circles; and the case is the same with books, music, politics, and opinions on women.





120.

*The simplification of man in the nineteenth century* \(The eighteenth century was that of elegance, subtlety, and generous feeling\).—Not "return to nature"; for no natural humanity has ever existed yet. Scholastic, unnatural, and antinatural values are the rule and the beginning; man only reaches Nature after a long struggle—he never turns his "back" to her.... To be natural means, to dare to be as immoral as Nature is.

We are coarser, more direct, richer in irony towards generous feelings, even when we are beneath them.

Our *haute volée,* the society consisting of our rich and leisured men, is more natural: people hunt each other, the love of the sexes is a kind of sport in which marriage is both a charm and an obstacle; people entertain each other and live for the sake of pleasure; bodily advantages stand in the first rank, and curiosity and daring are the rule.

Our attitude towards *knowledge* is more natural; we are innocent in our absolute spiritual debauchery, we hate pathetic and hieratic manners, we delight in that which is most strictly prohibited, we should scarcely recognise any interest in knowledge if we were bored in acquiring it.

Our attitude to *morality* is also more natural. Principles have become a laughing-stock; no one dares to speak of his "duty," unless in irony. But a helpful, benevolent disposition is highly valued. \(Morality is located in *instinct* and the rest is despised. Besides this there are few points of honour.\)

Our attitude to *politics* is more natural: we see problems of power, of the quantum of power, against another quantum. We do not believe in a right that does not proceed from a power which is able to uphold it. We regard all rights as conquests.

Our valuation of *great men and things* is more natural: we regard passion as a privilege; we can conceive of nothing great which does not involve a great crime; all greatness is associated in our minds with a certain standing-beyond-the-pale in morality.

Our attitude to *Nature* is more natural: we no longer love her for her "innocence," her "reason," her "beauty," we have made her beautifully devilish and "foolish." But instead of despising her on that account, since then we have felt more closely related to her and more familiar in her presence. She does *not* aspire to virtue: we therefore respect her.

Our attitude towards *Art* is more natural: we do not exact beautiful, empty lies, etc., from her; brutal positivism reigns supreme, and it ascertains things with perfect calm.

In short: there are signs showing that the European of the nineteenth century is less ashamed of his instincts; he has gone a long way towards acknowledging his unconditional naturalness and immorality, *without bitterness*: on the contrary, he is strong enough to endure this point of view alone.

To some ears this will sound as though *corruption* had made strides: and certain it is that man has not drawn nearer to the "Nature" which Rousseau speaks about, but has gone one step farther in the civilisation before which Rousseau *stood in horror.* We have grown *stronger,* we have drawn nearer to the seventeenth century, more particularly to the taste which reigned towards its close \(Dancourt, Le Sage, Renard\).



121.

*Culture* versus *Civilisation.*—The culminating stages of culture and civilisation lie apart: one must not be led astray as regards the fundamental antagonism existing between culture and civilisation. From the moral standpoint, great periods in the history of culture have always been periods of corruption; while on the other hand, those periods in which man was deliberately and compulsorily *tamed* \("civilisation"\) have always been periods of intolerance towards the most intellectual and most audacious natures. Civilisation desires something different from what culture strives after: their aims may perhaps be opposed....



122.

*What I warn people against*: confounding the instincts of decadence with those of *humanity*;

Confounding the *dissolving means* of civilisation *and those which necessarily promote decadence,* with *culture*;

Confounding *debauchery,* and the principle, "laisser aller," with the *Will to Power* \(the latter is the exact reverse of the former\).





123.

The unsolved problems which I set anew: the *problem of civilisation,* the struggle between Rousseau and Voltaire about the year 1760. Man becomes deeper, more mistrustful, more "immoral," stronger, more self-confident—and therefore "*more natural*"; that is "progress." In this way, by a process of division of labour, the more evil strata and the milder and tamer strata of society get separated: so that *the general facts* are not visible at first sight.... It is a sign of *strength,* and of the self-control and fascination of the strong, that these stronger strata possess the arts in order to make their greater powers for evil felt as something "*higher*" As soon as there is "progress" there is a transvaluation of the strengthened factors into the "good."



124.

Man must have the *courage* of his natural instincts restored to him.—

*The poor opinion* he has of himself must be destroyed \(*not* in the sense of the individual, but in the sense of the *natural* man ...\)—

The *contradictions* in things must be eradicated, after it has been well understood that we were responsible for them—

*Social idiosyncrasies* must be stamped out of existence \(guilt, punishment, justice, honesty, freedom, love, etc. etc.\)—

An advance towards "*naturalness*": in all political questions, even in the relations between parties, even in merchants', workmen's, or contractors' parties, only *questions* of *power* come into play:— "what one *can* do" is the first question, what one ought to do is only a secondary consideration.



125.

Socialism—or the *tyranny* of the meanest and the most brainless,—that is to say, the superficial, the envious, and the mummers, brought to its zenith,—is, as a matter, of fact, the logical conclusion of "modern ideas" and their latent anarchy: but in the genial atmosphere of democratic well-being the capacity for forming resolutions or even for coming *to an end* at all, is paralysed. Men follow—but no longer their reason. That is why socialism is on the whole a hopelessly bitter affair: and there is nothing more amusing than to observe the discord between the poisonous and desperate faces of present-day socialists—and what wretched and nonsensical feelings does not their style reveal to us\!—and the childish lamblike happiness of their hopes and desires. Nevertheless, in many places in Europe, there may be violent hand-to-hand struggles and irruptions on their account: the coming century is likely to be convulsed in more than one spot, and the Paris Commune, which finds defenders and advocates even in Germany, will seem to have been but a slight indigestion compared with what is to come. Be this as it may, there will always be too many people of property for socialism ever to signify anything more than an attack of illness: and these people of property are like one man with one faith, "one must possess something in order *to be* some one." This, however, is the oldest and most wholesome of all instincts; I should add: "one must desire more than one has in order to *become* more." For this is the teaching which life itself preaches to all living things: the morality of Development. To have and to wish to have more, in a word, *Growth*—that is life itself. In the teaching of socialism "a will to the denial of life" is but poorly concealed: botched men and races they must be who have devised a teaching of this sort. In fact, I even wish a few experiments might be made to show that in a socialistic society, life denies itself, and itself cuts away its own roots. The earth is big enough and man is still unexhausted enough for a practical lesson of this sort and *demonstratio ad absurdum*—even if it were accomplished only by a vast expenditure of lives—to seem worth while to me. Still, Socialism, like a restless mole beneath the foundations of a society wallowing in stupidity, will be able to achieve something useful and salutary: it delays "Peace on Earth" and the whole process of character-softening of the democratic herding animal; it forces the European to have an extra supply of intellect,—that is to say, craft and caution, and prevents his entirely abandoning the manly and warlike qualities,—it also saves Europe awhile from the *marasmus femininus* which is threatening it.



126.

The most favourable obstacles and remedies of modernity:

\(1\) Compulsory *military service* with real wars in which all joking is laid aside.

\(2\) *National* thick-headedness \(which simplifies and concentrates\).

\(3\) Improved *nutrition* \(meat\).

\(4\) Increasing *cleanliness* and wholesomeness in the home.

\(5\) The predominance of *physiology* over theology, morality, economics, and politics.

\(6\) Military discipline in the exaction and the practice of one's "duty" \(it is no longer customary to praise\).



127.

I am delighted at the military development of Europe, also at the inner anarchical conditions: the period of quietude and "Chinadom" which Galiani prophesied for this century is now over. Personal and *manly* capacity, bodily capacity recovers its value, valuations are becoming more physical, nutrition consists ever more and more of flesh. Fine men have once more become possible. Bloodless sneaks \(with mandarins at their head, as Comte imagined them\) are now a matter of the past. The savage in every one of us is *acknowledged,* even the wild animal. *Precisely on that account,* philosophers will have a better chance. —Kant is a scarecrow\!



128.

I have not yet *seen* any reasons to feel discouraged. He who acquires and preserves a *strong will,* together with a broad mind, has a more favourable chance now than ever he had. For the *plasticity* of man has become exceedingly great in democratic Europe: men who learn easily, who readily adapt themselves, are the rule: the gregarious animal of a high order of intelligence is prepared. He who would command finds those who *must* obey: I have Napoleon and Bismarck in mind, for instance. The struggle against strong and unintelligent wills, which forms the surest obstacle in one's way, is really insignificant Who would not be able to knock down these "objective" gentlemen with weak wills, such as Ranke and Renan\!



129.

*Spiritual enlightenment* is an unfailing means of making men uncertain, weak of will, and needful of succour and support; in short, of developing the herding instincts in them. That is why all great artist-rulers, hitherto \(Confucius in China, the Roman Empire, Napoleon, Popedom—at a time when they had the courage of their worldliness and frankly pursued power\) in whom the ruling instincts, that had prevailed until their time, culminated, also made use of the spiritual enlightenment—or at least allowed it to be supreme \(after the style of the Popes of the Renaissance\). The self-deception of the masses on this point, in every democracy for instance, is of the greatest possible value: all that makes men smaller and more amenable is pursued under the title "progress."





130.

The highest equity and mildness as a condition of *weakness* \(the New Testament and the early Christian community—manifesting itself in the form of utter foolishness in the Englishmen, Darwin and Wallace\). Your equity, ye higher men, drives you to universal suffrage, etc.; your "humanity" urges you to be milder towards crime and stupidity. In the *end* you will thus help stupidity and harmlessness to conquer.

*Outwardly*: Ages of terrible wars, insurrections, explosions. *Inwardly*: ever more and more weakness among men; *events* take the *form of excitants.* The Parisian as the type of the European extreme.

*Consequences*: \(1\) Savages \(at first, of course, in conformity with the culture that has reigned hitherto\); \(2\) *Sovereign individuals* \(where *powerful* barbarous *masses* and emancipation from all that has been, are crossed\). The age of greatest stupidity, brutality, and wretchedness in the masses, and *in the highest individuals.*



131.

An incalculable number of higher individuals now perish: but he who *escapes their fate* is as strong as the devil. In this respect we are reminded of the conditions which prevailed in the Renaissance.

How are *Good Europeans* such as ourselves distinguished from the patriots? In the first place, we are atheists and immoralists, but we take care to support the religions and the morality which we associate with the gregarious instinct: for by means of them, an order of men is, so to speak, being prepared, which must at some time or other fall into our hands, which must actually *crave* for our hands.

Beyond Good and Evil,—certainly; but we insist upon the unconditional and strict preservation of herd-morality.

We reserve ourselves the right to several kinds of philosophy which it is necessary to learn: under certain circumstances, the pessimistic kind as a hammer; a European Buddhism might perhaps be indispensable.

We should probably support the development and the maturation of democratic tendencies; for it conduces to weakness of will: in "Socialism" we recognise a thorn which prevents smug ease.

Attitude towards the people.. Our prejudices; we pay attention to the results of cross-breeding.

Detached, well-to-do, strong: irony concerning the "press" and its culture. Our care: that scientific men should not become journalists. We mistrust any form of culture that tolerates news-paper reading or writing.

We make our accidental positions \(as Goethe and Stendhal did\), our experiences, a foreground, and we lay stress upon them, so that we may deceive concerning our backgrounds. We ourselves *wait* and avoid putting our heart into them. They serve us as refuges, such as a wanderer might require and use—but we avoid feeling at home in them. We are ahead of our fellows in that we have had a *disciplina voluntatis.* All strength is directed to the *development of the will,* an art which allows us to wear masks, an art of understanding *beyond* the passions \(also "super-European" thought at times\).

This is our preparation before becoming the law-givers of the future and the lords of the earth; if not we, at least our children. Caution where marriage is concerned.

*The twentieth century.*—The Abbé Galiani says somewhere: "*La prévoyance est la cause des guerres actuelles de l'Europe. Si l'on voulait se donner la peine de ne rien prévoir, tout le monde serait tranquille, et je ne crois pas qu'on serait plus malheureux parce qu'on ne ferait pas la guerre.*" As I in no way share the unwarlike views of my deceased friend Galiani, I have no fear whatever of saying something beforehand with the view of conjuring in some way the cause of wars.

A condition of excessive *consciousness,* after the worst of earthquakes: with new questions.

It is the time of the *great noon, of the most appalling enlightenment*: my particular kind of *Pessimism*: the great starting-point.

\(1\) Fundamental contradiction between civilisation and the elevation of man.

\(2\) Moral valuations regarded as a history of lies and the art of calumny in the service of the Will to Power \(of the will of the *herd,* which rises against stronger men\).

\(3\) The conditions which determine every elevation in culture \(the facilitation of a *selection* being made at the cost of a crowd\) are the *conditions* of all growth.

\(4\). *The multiformity* of the world as a question of *strength,* which sees all things in the *perspective of their growth.* The moral Christian values to be regarded as the insurrection and mendacity of slaves \(in comparison with the aristocratic values of the *ancient world\).*
