## CONTENTS 
Neither the table of contents nor the headings in the text are Nietzsche's; both were introduced by the German editors to create the impression of a major systematic work. They are retained here with minor modifications to assist those who want to locate notes discussing particular problems. See also the comprehensive index, made especially for this edition.

A Note on This Edition 
For the present volume I enlisted as a collaborator R. J. Hollingdale, author of Nietzsche: The Man and His Philosophy (University of Louisiana Press, 1965). I made a new translation of Book I, and he furnished new translations of Books II, III, and IV, which I sub sequently corrected and revised very extensively, after comparing them with the original German, sentence for sentence. I am also responsible for the notes and the editorial apparatusindeed, for the volume as a whole. 
W.K. 
Editor's Introduction 
THE WILL TO POWer is a very famous and interesting book, but its stature and its reputation are two very different things. Indeed, the nature and contents of the book are as little known as its title is familiar. In a way this is odd because the book has been so widely cited and discussed; but in the history of ideas one finds perpetually that Hegel was right when he said in the preface to his first book: "What is well-known is not necessarily known merely because it is well-known." 
Two false views of The Will to Power have had their day, in turn. The first was propagated by Elisabeth Förster-Nietzsche, the philosopher's sister, when she first published the book after his death: for a long time, it was widely held to represent Nietzsche's crowning systematic achievement, to which one had to turn for his final views. Alfred Bäumler began his postscript to the handy one volume edition of the work (Kröner's Taschenausgabe, vol. 78, 1930): "The Will to Power is Nietzsche's philosophical magnum opus. All the fundamental results of his thinking are brought to gether in this book. The aversion of its author against systematizers must not deter us from calling this work a system." Philosophically, Bäumler was a nobody, but the editions of Nietzsche's works for which he wrote his postscripts were the most convenient and least expensive and read very widely. Being a Nazi, Bäumler was called to Berlin as professor of philosophy after Hitler came to power. His ideas about Nietzsche were accepted not only by large numbers of Germans but also by many of Nietzsche's detractors outside Germany. Ernest Newman, for example, admits in the fourth volume of his Life of Richard Wagner (1946) that his account of Nietzsche relies heavily on Bäumler's "masterly epitome of Nietzsche's thinking, Nietzsche, Der Philosoph und Politiker" (p. 335). 
After World War II this view of The Will to Power was dis

THE WILL TO POWER credited along with the Nazis; and in the process the book itself was discredited, too. The gist of the new view was that The Will to Power is not worth reading at all. The man who has done more for this new myth than anyone else is Karl Schlechta, whose edi tion of Nietzsche's works in three thin-paper volumes (Werke in drei Bänden, 1954-1956) created something of an international sensation particularly the third volume with its odd handling of The Will to Power and its lengthy "Philological Postscript." A passage from the postscript makes clear what is at stake: "The Will to Power contains nothing new, nothing that could surprise anyone who knows everything N published or intended to pub lish" (p. 1,403). 
This is as untenable as Bäumler's view: the book contains a good deal that has no close parallel in the works Nietzsche fin ished; for example, but by no means only, much of the material on nihilism in Book I, some of the epistemological reflections in Book III, and the attempts at proofs of the doctrine of the eternal recurrence of the same events and scores of brilliant formulations. But Schlechta's express view matters much less than what he did to The Will to Power; and matters are further complicated by the fact that what he did and what he said he did are two different things. 
He did away with the systematic arrangement of the older editions and with the title The Will to Power and offered the material in his third volume under the heading "Aus dem Nachlass der Achtzigerjahre," that is, "From the unpublished manuscript material of the eighties." And he claimed that his arrangement was faithful to the manuscripts and chronological (manuskriptgetreu chronologisch, p. 1,393), although in fact it is neither. 
This question cannot be avoided here because it would be unscholarly and perverse to reproduce the old systematic arrange ment in this translation if a far superior arrangement of the material had been made available in 1956. But Schlechta's arrangement is utterly pointless, and indeed explicable only as an over-reaction against the Bäumler view: it represents an attempt to render The Will to Power all but unreadable. 
Suppose, first of all, Schlechta's arrangement did follow the manuscripts faithfully; even then it could not claim to be chrono logical. For as Schlechta himself notes in passing in his postscript (p. 1,396), Nietzsche had the habit of using over and over old notebooks that had not yet been completely filled, and of writing 
EDITOR'S INTRODUCTION 
XV in them now from the front toward the back, now from the back toward the front; and sometimes he filled right-hand pages only, at other times left-hand pages only. And Erich Podach claims in Ein Blick in Notizbücher Nietzsche's ("A Glance into Nietzsche's Notebooks," 1963) that "Nietzsche as a rule used his notebooks from back to front" (p. 8). Plainly, an arrangement that was really faithful to the manuscripts would not be an arrangement at all, but simply chaotic and almost literally unreadable. 
Moreover, Podach shows in the same book (pp. 202-206) that Schlechta did not always follow the manuscripts (see my notes on sections 2 and 124 below). Nor did Schlechta merely fail to consult the manuscripts, using the printed text of the stand ard edition instead; he did not even make a point of consulting the twenty-odd pages of notes at the end of the 1911 edition where scores of departures from the manuscripts are registered, 
Even if it is granted that by taking these departures into account the present translation is philologically preferable to Schlechta's edition, it may seem odd that the old systematic arrangement has been followed here once again. There are two reasons for this. First, for all its faults, this arrangement has the virtue of making it easy for the reader to locate passages and to read straight through a lot of notes dealing with art or religion or the theory of knowledge. Provided one realizes that one is perusing notes and not a carefully wrought systematic work, the advantages of such an arrangement outweigh the disadvantages. But would it not have been possible to improve the systematic arrangement? This brings us to the second reason for following the old editions, there is something drastically wrong with schol arly translations that are not based on, do not correspond to, and cannot be easily checked against any original. This translation should be useful to scholars and critics, philosophers and historians, professors and students; it should be possible to cite it and also to find in it passages cited by others; and it should be easy to compare the text with readily available German editions. 
2 
The question still remains to be answered: what is the nature of this strange work? The answer is plain: it offers a selection from Nietzsche's notebooks of the years 1883 through 1888. These notes were not intended for publication in this form, andTHE WILL TO POWER 
the arrangement and the numbering are not Nietzsche's. Alto gether, this book is not comparable to the works Nietzsche finished and polished, and we do him a disservice if we fudge the distinction between these hasty notes and his often gemlike aphorisms. Super ficially they may look alike, and the numbering contributes to this appearance, but in both style and content the difference is considerable. 
To remind the reader of the difference, the approximate date of composition is furnished in brackets after the number of each note, and every attempt has been made to preserve the stylistic character of the original. The temptation to complete sentences, spruce up the punctuation, and turn jottings into attractive epi grams has been resisted with a will. And in my notes I have called attention to passages in Nietzsche's late books in which some of these notes have been put to use sometimes almost literally, but often with an interesting and perhaps unexpected twist. And in some notes I offer cross references to other passages in which Nietzsche takes a different tack. 
A generation ago, many readers might have felt that if this book did not offer Nietzsche's final system, it could surely be ignored. But now that people have become used to reading the notebooks of Gide, Kafka, and Camus, for example, without taking them for anything but what they are, there is no need to downgrade Nietzsche's notes because they are mere notes. Of course, the reason he did not use some of them in his later works, although he could have included a lot of them quite easily in a chapter of aphorisms in Twilight of the Idols, was that many of them did not altogether satisfy him. Whether he used or did not use them, these notes obviously do not represent his final views: in his last active year, 1888, he completed five books; during the immediately preceding two years, another two. So we clearly need not turn to his notes to find what he really thought in the end. But it is fascinating to look, as it were, into the workshop of a great thinker; and Nietzsche's notes need not fear comparison with the notes of other great writers. On the contrary. 
Nietzsche often employs three or four periods as a punctuation mark to indicate that a train of thought is not concluded. Since this device is so regularly employed in English to indicate omissions, dashes (two if there are a lot of periods) have been substituted in this translation to avoid misunder standing. And not all of Nietzsche's eccentricities have been retained; e.g., his frequent use of dashes before other punctuation marks. Also, I have sometimes started new paragraphs where the German editors run on. 
EDITOR'S INTRODUCTION

3 
The history of the text can be given briefly. Nietzsche himself had contemplated a book under the title The Will to Power. His notebooks contain a great many drafts for title pages for this and other projected works, and some of the drafts for this book suggest as a subtitle: Attempt at a Revaluation of All Values. Later on Nietzsche considered writing a book of a somewhat different nature (less aphoristic, more continuous) under the title Revalua tion of all Values, and for a time he conceived of The Antichrist, written in the fall of 1888, as the first of the four books com prising the Revaluation of All Values. 
In 1901, the year after Nietzsche's death, his sister published her first version of The Will to Power in volume 15 of her edition of his collected works, arranging 483 notes under topical headings. In 1904 she included 200 pages of additional notes "from The Will to Power" in the last volume of her biography of Nietzsche, to help its sales. And in 1906 another edition of the collected works offered a new version of The Will to Power in two volumes: the new material was mixed in with the old, and the total number of notes now came to 1,067. In the so-called Grossoktay edition of Nietzsche's Werke the same 1,067 notes appear in volumes 15 and 16, and volume 16 (1911) also features an appendix which contains "uncertain aphorisms and variants," numbered 1,068 through 1,079; "plans, dispositions, drafts" (pp. 413-67); a post script (pp. 471-80); a list furnishing the numbers of the notebooks in which each of the notes and drafts was found; and notes indicating small departures from the manuscripts. I have made abundant use of these notes in the pages that follow, sometimes citing the volume in which they are found as “1911.94 For these notes were not reprinted in the otherwise superior Musarion edi tion of Nietzsche's Werke, in which the Will to Power comprises volumes 18 and 19. The other material found in 1911 is offered in that edition, too, except that the list of the notebooks is super seded by a list giving the approximate date of composition of each of the 1,067 notes. The dates given in the following pages in brackets, immediately after the number of each note, are taken from that list. 
Where departures from the MSS are indicated in the editorial notes in the following pages and no authority is cited, the information is derived from 1911. 
THE WILL TO POWER 
The handiest edition of the work is probably the one-volume edition in Kröner's Taschen edition, volume 78, published in 1930 with Alfred Bäumler's postscript (discussed above). Kröner has seen fit to reprint these Nietzsche editions, complete with Bäum ler's postscripts. On close examination, however, it appears that some changes have been made in Bäumler's remarks about The Will to Power, although this is not indicated anywhere. This edi tion contains none of the scholarly apparatus. 
In 1940 Friedrich Würzbach published his own rearrangement of the notes of The Will to Power, under the title "The Legacy of Friedrich Nietzsche: Attempt at a new interpretation of all that happens and a revaluation of all values, from the unpub lished manuscript material and arranged in accordance with Nietzsche's intentions." The claim that these notes rather than the books Nietzsche finished represent his legacy is as untenable as the boast that this or any- arrangement can claim the sanction of Nietzsche's own intentions. The bulk of Würzbach's material was taken from The Will to Power, but he also included some other notes (all of them previously published in the Grossoktav edition and the Musarion edition), and he amalgamated notes of all periods, from 1870 to 1888. On pages 683-97 he furnished the dates, but he nowhere indicated the numbers of the notes in the standard edition of The Will to Power. This edition was trans lated into French but has won no acceptance in Germany or among scholars elsewhere. 
What needs to be said about the standard arrangement fol lowed in the present translation I said in my Nietzsche in 1950; "To arrange the material, Frau Förster-Nietzsche chose a four line draft left by her brother, and distributed the notes under its four headings. Nietzsche himself had discarded this draft, and there are a dozen later ones, about twenty-five in all; but none of these were briefer than this one which listed only the titles of the four projected parts and thus gave the editor the greatest pos sible freedom. (It was also the only draft which suggested "Zucht und Züchtung" as the title of Part IV, and Frau Förster-Nietzsche may have been charmed by these words, although her brother, as we shall see, did not consider 'breeding a function of race.) His

own attempt to distribute some of his notes among the four parts of a later and more detailed plan was ignored, as was the fact that Nietzsche had abandoned the entire project of The Will to Power in 1888. ... Moreover, the Antichrist, however provoca tive, represents a more single-minded and sustained inquiry than any of Nietzsche's other books and thus suggests that the major work of which it constitutes Part I for at least was for a while intended to form Part I] was not meant to consist of that maze of incoherent, if extremely interesting, observations which have since been represented as his crowning achievement. While he intended to use some of this material, he evidently meant to mold it into a coherent and continuous whole; and the manner in which he utilized his notes in his other finished books makes it clear that many notes would have been given an entirely new and unexpected meaning. 
"The publication of The Will to Power as Nietzsche's final and systematic work blurred the distinction between his works and his notes and created the false impression that the aphorisms in his books are of a kind with these disjointed jottings. Ever since, The Will to Power, rather than the Götzen-Dämmerung [Twilight of the Idols), Antichrist, and Ecce Homo, has been searched for Nietzsche's final position, and those who find it strangely incoherent are led to conclude that the same must be true a fortiori of his parva opera. 
"The two most common forms of the Nietzsche legend can thus be traced back to his sister. In the manner just indicated, she unwittingly laid the foundation for the myth that Nietzsche's thought is hopelessly incoherent, ambiguous, and self-contradictory; and by bringing to her interpretation of her brother's work the heritage of her late husband (a prominent anti-Semite whose ideology Nietzsche had excoriated on many occasions), she pre pared the way for the belief that Nietzsche was a proto-Nazi" 
(Prologue, section I). 
Four years later, in 1954, when I published The Portable Nietzsche and presented four complete works as well as selections from Nietzsche's other books, notes, and letters, all arranged in chronological order, I included a few notes from The Will to Power under such headings as “NOTES (1887)" with footnotes reading: "Published as part of The Will to Power by Nietzsche's executors." 
Schlechta's edition of 1956 thus did not require me to change 
U 
THE WILL TO POWER my mind about The Will to Power. But it may seem odd that in the light of my own estimate of The Will to Power I should have decided to publish a translation. The explanation is simple. 
Nietzsche's late works had to be made available first of all. Toward that end I made entirely new translations of Thus Spoke Zarathustra, Twilight of the Idols, The Antichrist, and Nietzsche contra Wagner (all included in The Portable Nietzsche), and more recently of Beyond Good and Evil (with commentary, 1966), The Birth of Tragedy and The Case of Wagner (with commentary, 1967), and Ecce Homo (1967). And I collaborated on a new translation of the Genealogy of Morals (1967). Beginning with Zarathustra, then, all of Nietzsche's later works will be available in new translations. At that point The Will to Power should be made accessible, too, for those who cannot read these notes in the original German. 
To be sure, there is an old translation, done by Anthony M. Ludovici for The Complete Works of Friedrich Nietzsche, edited by Dr. Oscar Levy. Originally published in 1914, the two volumes of The Will to Power were "revised afresh by their translator" for the edition of 1924, and reprinted without further revision in 1964. Dr. Levy was probably quite right when in a prefatory note he called Ludovici "the most gifted and conscientious of my collaborators," but unfortunately this does not mean that Ludo vici's translations are roughly reliable. Even in the revised version, the heading of section 12, for example, refers to "Cosmopolitan Values" instead of "Cosmological Values." Let us say that Ludo vici was not a philosopher, and let it go at that. It would be pointless to multiply editorial notes in order to catalogue his mis translations. But as long as we shall never mention him in the notes, one other example may be permissible. Section 86 begins: "Your Henrik Ibsen has become very clear to me." Evidently confusing deutlich (clear) and deutsch, Ludovici renders this: "In my opinion, Henrik Ibsen has become very German." 
On the surface, Nietzsche seems easy to read, at least by comparison with other philosophers. In fact, however, his style poses unusual difficulties, and anyone who has taken the trouble to compare most of the existing translations with the originals must realize how easy it is to miss Nietzsche's meaning, not merely 
EDITOR'S INTRODUCTION 
occasionally but in section upon section. The reasons are not diffi cult to find. 
Nietzsche loved brevity to the point of ellipsis and often attached exceptional weight to the nuances of the words he did put down. Without an ear for the subtlest connotations of his brilliant, sparkling German, one is bound to misunderstand him. Nietzsche is Germany's greatest prose stylist, and his language is a delight at every turn like a poet's more than that of all but the very greatest poets. 
At the same time Nietzsche deals with intricate philosophical questions, especially but not only in The Will to Power, and who ever lacks either a feeling for poetry or some knowledge of these problems and their terminology is sure to come to grief in trying to fathom Nietzsche, sentence for sentence, as a translator must. 
Yet Nietzsche's writings have an appeal that those of most other philosophers—and of all other German philosophers-lack. People turn to him for striking epigrams and brilliant formula tions; they remember phrases out of context; indeed, he is more often than not read out of context-casually, carelessly, as if the details did not matter. If one turns to translations whether the old ones of The Complete Works or the more recent paperback versions that flaunt their modernity-one usually falls victim to translators who have read him that way. 
In addition to all this, Nietzsche writes as a "good European" (his coinage), alluding freely to Greek and Roman, French, Italian, and German literature and history, and he uses foreign phrases when they have nuances that might easily be lost in German, If we simply rendered all such phrases into English, not only subtle shades of meaning would be lost but infinitely more important --something of this European flavor. If we simply left them all in the original, most students would be stumped by them; hence I have offered English translations in footnotes, with apologies to those who do not need them. Occasionally, no English equiva lents are offered because the meaning seems so obvious, usually because the words are almost the same in English. 
Similarly, some of the men referred to are identified in notes. In all such matters compromises seem unavoidable: to identify all would be insufferable, to identify none would leave even some scholars baffled, and no mean could answer every student's needs without at the same time striking some others as superfluous. 
Precisely the same consideration applies to all other notes. 
xxii 
THE WILL TO POWER 
Listing all parallel passages at every point would swell the editorial notes beyond all reason; after all, there are many indices to Nietzsche's collected works (three different ones by Richard Oehler—for the Grossoktav edition, the Musarion edition, and Kröner's Taschen edition and one by Karl Schlechta for his edition, as well as one in English for The Collected Works), and my recent translations furnish indices for individual works. More over, cross references and indices always do harm as well as good, especially in Nietzsche's case: there is no substitute for reading his main works straight through, giving attention to the movement of his thought and to the context in which various things are said. But if no passages were cited in which Nietzsche put to use the notes his sister published posthumously in The Will to Power, the following pages would be as misleading as all previous editions, English and German. 
As it is, this translation offers a great deal of information not to be found in any German edition, though it owes a great deal to the editorial apparatus of the Grossoktav edition and a little to that of the Musarion edition. It should facilitate a better understanding of Nietzsche, of the nineteenth century, and perhaps also of some of the problems with which he dealt-and therefore of the twentieth century, too. 
Even in this introduction Nietzsche should have the last word. So I shall conclude by citing one of his drafts for a preface --not included in any previous edition of The Will to Power, but found in the Musarion edition of the works (volume XIV, pp. 373 f.):

EDITOR'S INTRODUCTION 
xxiii 
The Germans of today are no thinkers any longer: something else delights and impresses them. 
The will to power as a principle might be intelligible to them. 
It is precisely among the Germans today that people think less than anywhere else. But who knows? In two gen erations one will no longer require the sacrifice involved in any nationalistic squandering of power and in becoming stupid. 
(Formerly I wished I had not written my Zarathustra in German.) 
ACKNOWLEDGMENTS 
When Jason Epstein talked me into doing more Nietzsche transla tions, and I talked him into doing The Will to Power, I did not foresee that this volume would present even a fraction of the difficulties that it did raise. At one point I abandoned the project altogether, but Jason Epstein was ever patient and kind, and Berenice Hoffman's innumerable editorial queries were more than patient and, like Jason Epstein's persistence, never annoying. To say that they were helpful would be an understatement. No trans lator or author could ask for more cooperation from his editors. 
Further, I am indebted to Professor Dr. Hahn at the Goethe and Schiller-Archiv, Nationale Forschungs- und Gedenkstätten der klassischen deutschen Literatur in Weimar, East Germany, for sending me the reproductions of Nietzsche manuscripts that appear at the front of this volume, and for granting me permission to pub lish them. These pictures have not been published previously and contain passages that have never before appeared in print in any language. 
W. K.On the Editions of THE WILL TO POWER 
THE FIRST EDITION appeared in 1901 in volume XV of Nietzsche's Werke (in the so-called Grossoktav edition). The title page read 
NACHGELASSENE WERKE. 
Der Wille zur Macht. Versuch einer Umwerthung aller Werthe. 
(Studien und Fragmente.) 
VON Friedrich Nietzsche. 
LEIPZIG Druck und Verlag von C. G. Naumann 
1901. 
In English: "Works Not Published by Nietzsche, The Will to Power. Attempt at a Revaluation of All Values. (Studies and Fragments.) By Friedrich Nietzsche." The facing left page was headed "Nietzsche's Werke" and subtitled "Zweite Abtheilung. Band XV. (Siebenter Band der zweiten Abtheilung.)" The first eight volumes, comprising the first section of the works, contained Nietzsche's books; the second section, of which this was the seventh volume, offered his Nachlass. 
The editors were Peter Gast, Ernst Horneffer, and August Horneffer. On the last page of her preface, Nietzsche's sister wrote: "But I emphasize expressly that I myself am not the editor of this volume but at most a collaborator in the most modest sense of that word. The only circumstance that permits me to write this preface is that the collected edition of my brother's works is published at my behest, and hence the heaviest part of the responsi bility, with all its cares and fights, has been resting on my shoulders for many years now. This 15th volume is to be considered as the 
XXviii 
THE WILL TO POWER 
culmination of the perennial, troublesome, conscientious labors of the editors: Peter Gast, Ernst and August Horneffer ..." 483 sections (490 pages) plus 23 pages of Nietzsche's plans, and another 23 pages of editorial notes. The editors did not have time to do the job as they themselves felt it ought to be done, because Elisabeth Förster-Nietzsche, as head of the Nietzsche Archive, insisted that the volume be published in a hurry. There were recriminations between her and the brothers Horneffer, and they left the Archive. 
The second edition of 1906, in the so-called Taschen edition of the Werke (for the different editions of the works in German see the bibliography at the end of my translation of The Birth of Tragedy and The Case of Wagner in one volume, Vintage Books, New York 1967), followed roughly the same plan as the first edition but comprised 1,067 sections. Peter Gast checked all the material against Nietzsche's manuscripts, which he is said to have been able to decipher better than anyone else, and he seems to have had a fairly free hand in Books I and III. 
The reprint of 1911 (in vols. XV and XVI of the revised edition of the Grossoktav edition) follows the text of 1906, but Dr. Otto Weiss contributed an appendix of invaluable scholarly notes on the manuscripts. 
In the so-called Musarion edition (23 vols., 1920-29), pub lished by the Musarion Verlag in Munich, the text of 1906 and 1911, which had been published by Kröner in Leipzig, is reprinted in vols. XVIII and XIX, but the apparatus differs in two impor tant respects from the edition of 1911: on the basis of the informa tion given by Dr. Weiss on p. 480 fit, a table is included that furnishes the approximate date of composition for every one of the 1,067 sections, and the editorial notes listing departures from the manuscripts are omitted. Indeed, these notes are found only in the edition of 1911, and the list of dates appears only in the Musarion edition. These two editions are therefore the most 
scholarly and helpful, that of 1911 being by far the best. 
No subsequent edition has made any important scholarly contribution. The editions of Bäumler, Würzbach, and Schlechta are discussed in the Editor's Introduction to the present edition, and the editorial notes contain many examples showing how Schlechta's edition is less faithful to the manuscripts than the edition of 1911, notwithstanding his explicit claims which have been widely taken on credit on both sides of the Atlantic. 
EDITIONS OF The Will to Power 
XXLX Finally, it may be noted that Bäumter's first edition of Der Wille zur Macht, in volume 78 of Kröners Taschen edition (1930) presented the work as one of Nietzsche's books: the title page mentions no editors. In the reprint in Sämtliche Werke in zwölf Bänden, 12 vols., Kröner, Stuttgart 1964-65, the text follows vol ume 78 with the same pagination, but the title page adds "Ausge wählt und geordnet von Peter Gast unter Mitwirkung von Elisabeth Förster-Nietzsche" (selected and arranged by Peter Gast with the aid of Elisabeth Förster-Nietzsche); and in a postscript (pp. 711 15) to his editorial afterword (pp. 699-711-a slightly revised version of the earlier afterword, though neither the publisher nor Bäumler calls attention to the fact that some changes have been made) Alfred Bäumler deals briefly with Karl Schlechta's and Erich Podach's criticisms of the editing of Nietzsche's Nachlass.

Commentary on the FACSIMILES 
In the Bibliography of my. Nietzsche (Princeton, N. J., Princeton Uni versity Press, 1950), which was omitted in the paperback edition (New York, Meridian Books, 1956), I stated: 
"Any work on Nietzsche might seem merely provisional, pending the publication of all hitherto suppressed words and sentences. Such an inference, however, would be unwarranted. The principles which guided Gast and Frau Förster-Nietzsche in making omissions are very plain—from their published Nietzsche interpretations, from the explanations which accompany some of the omissions (WM [Der Wille zur Macht]), from the context, and from the nature of those cen sored passages which have been published from time to time; e.g., by Hofmiller and Podach. Some unkind comments on Frau Förster-Nietz sche, Richard Wagner, anti-Semitism, the German Reich, and Christi anity were suppressed; but there is no reason whatever for believing that the hitherto withheld material includes anything of significance that would have corroborated Frau Förster-Nietzsche's version of her brother's thought. It is therefore quite unlikely that future editions of Nietzsche's works will necesitate any radical revision of an interpre tation which does justice to the material so far published" (p. 385). 
In spite of the attention Karl Schlechta's edition of Nietzsche's works received in the popular press, and notwithstanding uninformed and mis leading reviews of Podach's last two works in some leading American philosophical periodicals, nothing that has been brought to light from Nietzsche's manuscripts from 1950 until 1966 is of any philosophical importance. I have dealt in detail with this matter in an article on "Nietz sche in the Light of His Suppressed Manuscripts," in Journal of the History of Philosophy, October 1964 (IL.2), pp. 205-225, which will be included in a forthcoming third revised edition of my Nietzsche. There is no need for covering the same ground here. But I present the selections from Nietz sche's notebooks that have become known as The Will to Power, without feeling apologetic about not having spent years studying the manuscripts in Weimar. Let others do that; let philological cleanliness flourish! But I doubt that the results will be philosophically rewarding. For all my interest in Nietzsche, I still believe as firmly as ever that the books he finished are his legacy, and that his notebooks are of secondary interest—as I explained in section I of the second chapter of my Nietzsche. Far from feeling any keen desire to know everything he ever jotted down, I feel more nearly like an intruder when I scrutinize a manuscript page, trying to decipher 
552 
THE WILL TO POWER 
some note that was never intended to be read by anyone else, much less to be published. 
To do a decent job on notes that have long been in print is one thing many of them are extremely interesting, but the way in which they have been published so far is open to many objections. I am offering a trans lation with notes that are intended to clarify both the nature of this material and hundreds of particular points. But going out of one's way to dredge up a few more personal remarks that have not been published so far is not a job that appeals to me. Nietzsche's view of Wagner, Germans, anti-Semites, and Christians are on record in his books; The Will to Power contains much similar material, and so do the notes not incorporated in The Will to Power but included in the Grossoktay edition and the Musarion edition of his works. There is no need to spice this volume with a few allegedly sensational revelations, alla tedesca (to use a phrase from Ecce Homo, second chapter, first section), in the manner that has become popular in Germany. 
Nevertheless, I am including in this volume (preceding the text) several facsimile pages. In The Will to Power there was some indication that in a few places something had been omitted, or that a section consisted of an excerpt from a longer note. In these cases I requested photostats of the manuscript pages from the Goethe-Schiller Archiv in Weimar, in East Germany, where the manuscripts that were formerly in the Nietzsche Archiv are now housed. After some correspondence, Professor Hahn, the Director, graciously sent me eight photostats, with permission to publish them--but this permission does not cover reproduction elsewhere. 
These are not typical pages, nor pages picked at random: Each was requested because there was evidence that the previously printed texts were inadequate. These pages contain some material that has never been published before, either in German or in English; they also show the German editors at their arbitrary worst and perhaps most important they give the reader some idea of the appearance of the manuscripts. Those able to read some German may discover to their surprise how little they can decipher of these pages, and how difficult it is in places to decide in what order these notes should be printed. By way of contrast, Nietz sche's letters and finished manuscripts are often quite beautiful and, in general, not particularly difficult to read. 
In keeping with what I have said, I shall not transcribe or translate these pages in full. Instead I shall offer a detailed but brief analysis of each page. 
The Roman numerals below refer to the reproduced facsimile pages in the present volume. The alphabetic letters in parentheses do not appear on the facsimile pages but are given below to facilitate dicussion of lines within the facsimile pages. 
Analysis of Facsimile Pages I-III The first three pages are consecutive ones (46-48) from a notebook identified in the archives as W II, 1, Nr. 157. Approximate date: Spring Fall, 1887. 
APPENDIX 
553 
I: The first seven lines (a) were published as the beginning of section 124 and are translated in the first seven lines of our edition. 
The following six lines (b), assigned a different number by Nietzsche himself, have not been published to date. 
The last eight lines (c), again set off by a different number by Nietz sche himself, constitute section 736, entire. 
II: The first line ("The problem of civilization spirit everything") was not published. 
A horizontal line across the page clearly divides what follows into two separate notes, of which the second has a title of its own. Yet Nietzsche assigned the number 80 to both the same number he placed over the first seven lines on the preceding page, which were published as the beginning of section 124. 
The German editors published lines 2-5 (d) as the continuation and conclusion of section 124 (the final paragraph in the present volume). Lines 6-10 (e), which comprise a separate paragraph in Nietzsche's MS, were omitted in the editions of 1906 and 1911, and in all subsequent editions. However this omission is not indicated in the editorial apparatus, 1911, p. 500. In the first edition of 1901, on the other hand, section 36 contains everything to which Nietzsche had assigned the number 80: the first seven lines on the preceding page, followed by all of the material on this page, excepting only the first line (which Nietzsche apparently did not mean to include), and the final sentence of the second paragraph, of which it was duly said in the editorial apparatus (p. 531): "A short sentence has been Omitted here." A translation of the material not included in section 124 will be found in my note on that section. 
The material below the horizontal line (f) was published as section 117. In 1911, p. 500, it is duly noted that the editors added five words at the end of this section (to clarify the meaning); but Schlechta follows the printed text, as usual, and not the MS. 
III: The first eight lines (g), set off from what follows by a horizontal line across the page, were printed as section 883 (1901, section 439). 
The next seven lines (h), not published in the edition of 1901, were published as section 612; and the immediately following two lines (i), though set off by another horizontal line and crossed out along with the last four lines on the page, were also published as the conclusion of section 612. 
The final four lines () were printed by Nietzsche himself, as the beginning of section 24 of "Skirmishes," in Twilight of the Idols (Portable Nietzsche, p. 529). 
The editorial notes at the end of 1911 offer no comments on either section 883 or section 612. 
A note on Schlechta's handling of this material: In vol. III, Schlechta prints some of this material on pp. 531 f, in the following sequence: (a) and (d) as one note; (c); (f)-deviating from the MS as noted above; (h) and (i) as one note; and finally (g). 
In sum: the way the notes on these three pages have been published is a mess; but as long as we keep in mind that we are dealing with mere 
554 
THE WILL TO POWER 
notes, the arrangement is hardly very important, and even Nietzsche scholars did not lose much by the "suppression" of (b) and (e). For that matter, (e) was actually published in 1901, with the exception of one very dispensable sentence; and all of this material is included in my note on section 124. 
Discovery: (b), published here for the first time, contains one re markable aphorism, entitled "On the Genealogy of Christianity-It re quires more courage and strength of character to turn back than to go on. To turn back without [?] cowardice is more difficult than to go on with [?] cowardice." 
Facsimile Pages IV and V These are consecutive pages (15-16) from a notebook identified in the archives as W II, 2, Nr. 158. Approximate date: Spring-Fall, 1887. 
IV: The first seven lines (k), which form a unit and were assigned number 279 by Nietzsche, have not been published until now. 
The rest of the material (1) on that page, which was assigned number 280 by Nietzsche, was printed as section 172, along with its continuation on the next page, 
V: but a little less than two lines (m), beginning at the end of line 7 and ending with the second word of line 9, were deleted in print; and in 1911, p. 502, it is duly noted that "one sentence has been omitted here." It is not stated that a few words, added by Nietzsche in the lower right hand corner, were also omitted, perhaps because they could not be de ciphered with any assurance. The same comments apply to the correspond ing section (119) in the edition of 1901. 
(k) and (m) contain a few words that are extremely hard to de cipher, but the over-all meaning is clear enough, and these "suppressed" passages add nothing of interest to what Nietzsche said in The Antichrist, In the following translations "..." indicates that I cannot read the writing with any certainty. 
(k): Salvation is of the Jews--the founder of Christianity said (John 4.22) And one has believed this! ! ! 
If one admits to oneself the first impression or merely instinct [?]: ... bad taste, bigots' sentimentality, nothing but repulsive symbols in the foreground; and the ... air of the nook and conventicle:-one does not sympathize. 
Pilate, 
(m): In the whole history of the spirit there is no more brazen kind of lie, no more premeditated ... 
Facsimile Pages VI and VII In the note on section 815 (1911, p. 512) we read: "A second part of this aphorism, dealing with Richard Wagner, has been omitted." Schlechta, who follows the printed versions without indicating any omission, as is his general practice, lends this section special emphasis by placing it at 
APPENDIX 
555 
the end of his edition, leaving the last half of the page on which it ends blank, and then printing section 256, which comprises only two lines, on the facing page, centered. 
VI is from Mp XVI, 3, Nr. 232, p. 17 (inside). Approximate date: Summer-Fall 1888. This is no mere note but a carefully written page with a great many corrections. What is crossed out is made illegible--this pro cedure was characteristic of Nietzsche-and the corrections are written very clearly, though the writing is very small because this material had to be squeezed between lines, Because of its smallness, some of it is not easy to read, especially in facsimile; but all of it can be deciphered with practical certainty. 
The first nine and a half lines were printed as section 815 (section 367 in the edition of 1901); what follows has never been published so far. A complete translation follows, after a description of facsimile page VII. 
VII is identified by the archives as W II, 4, Nr. 160, p. 19, and appears to be a draft for the second part of VI, with which it agrees literally in large part. 
Translation of the Suppressed Second Part of Section 815 I take the most disagreeable case, the case of Wagner. Wagner, under the spell of his incredibly pathological sexuality, which was the curse of his life, knew only too well what an artist forfeits when he loses his free dom, his respect for himself. He is condemned to be an actor. His very art becomes for him a constant attempt to escape, a means of self-oblivion, of self-narcosis-it eventually changes and determines the character of his art, Such an "unfree" man requires a hashish world, strange, heavy, envelop ing vapors, every kind of exoticism and symbolism of the ideal, merely in order to be rid for once of his own reality--he requires Wagnerian music. 
A certain catholicity of the ideal above all is almost sufficient proof in the case of an artist of self-contempt, of "morass": the case of Baudelaire in France, the case of Edgar Allan Poe in America, the case of Wagner in Germany. - Need I still add that Wagner also owes his success to his sensuality? that his music attracts the lowest instincts to him, to Wagner? that this holy conceptual vapor of the ideal, of three-eighths Catholicism, is one more art of seduction? (it permits one to expose oneself to the magic, ignorant, innocent, Christian Who would risk the word, the proper word, for the ardeurs of the Tristan music? I put on gloves when I read the score of Tristan — Wagnerianism, which keeps spreading, is a relatively light epidemic of sensuality that does not realize this"; against Wagnerian music every caution seems appropriate to me. 
COMMENTS ON THE DRAFT (PAGE VII) Compared with VI, which I have translated, the draft offers nothing of great interest. In the final version respect (Achtung: the word is emphasized by Nietzsche and therefore easy to locate, also in my translation) has been written above another word that has been crossed out: with the help556 
THE WILL TO POWER 
of the draft, we can tell that the word Nietzsche crossed out was "reverence" (Ehrfurcht). Indeed, in the draft Nietzsche crossed out Achtung to substi tute Ehrfurcht. In the end, he returned to "respect." There would be no point here to a more detailed comparison, 
Facsimile Page VIII Identified by the Archive as W II, 7, Nr. 163, p. 136. Approximate date: 1884. Lines 8-12 were printed as section 834 (section 61 in the edition of 1901). In the edition of 1911, but not in that of 1901, we find the comment (p. 512): "Taken from a note about Richard Wagner." 
The last seven lines on this page were evidently put down at a later time; they comprise a separate note, and they are singularly difficult to decipher. 
A partial translation of the note from which section 834 was ex cerpted follows: "..." indicates that I cannot decipher the writing with any certainty. 
TRANSLATION The impact of Wagner's art is deep; it is above all heavy, immensely heavy: why is this? The depth and above all heavy, immensely heavy impact of Wagner's art does not really belong to the music of Wagner: it is Wagner's general pathos with which his art overpowers; it is the tremendous persuasive power of his edifice, it is his holding bisa breath, of his extreme feeling that refuses to let go, it is the frightening length of his pathos by virtue of which he triumphs and always will triumph. Whether with such a pathos one is a "genius"? Or even could be one? [At this point, section 834 follows, ending with a dash. Then the note proceeds:] Another question .. .whether Wagner, precisely because he had such pathos, is German? is a German? Or does ... 
COMMENT These are clearly hasty jottings that do not add up to an aphorism. If anyone wants to know what the later Nietzsche "really" thought of Wagner, he should begin by reading The Case of Wagner and Nietzsche contra Wagner. Next, he should look up the passages on Wagner in Nietzsche's other late works. Only then should one turn to Nietzsche's posthumously published notes and correspondence. Whoever has done all this, is not likely to feel any anxiety or indignation because he knows that there are still a few jottings in Nietzsche's notebooks that have not yet been published. 
There are many topics with which Nietzsche never dealt as fully in his books as he did with Wagner, or with Christianity, or with the Germans: for example, but by no means only, some philosophical problems. Aad 
* Alemanhalten; anhalten (holding) is the conjecture of Professor Michael Curschmann of the German Department at Princeton University, who also helped me by deciphering a few other words that had stumped me. 
APPENDIX 
557 
the editors had no reason to suppress interesting notes on the theory of knowledge, or on determinism, or on aesthetics. It is this material that makes The Will to Power important. 
The palpable intent of the philosopher's sister to present The Will to Power as the systematic work that Nietzsche did not live to finish, was absurd. But the semi-systematic arrangement that allows us to read, one after another, a lot of notes that deal with related topics, jotted down over a period of time, may have the very opposite effect of that intended by her at least when the material is presented in the manner attempted in the present volume. So far from finding any final system, we look into a vast studio, full of sketches, drafts, abandoned attempts, and unfinished dreams. And in the end we should be less tempted than ever to mistake a random quotation for an ultimate position. This is not to say that Nietz sche never arrived at any conclusions. He did, but to know what they were one has to read his books. 
## INDEX 
The German editors' arrangement of Nietzsche's notes is far from ideal, and their table of contents is apt to give the false impression that those interested in morality, for example, need to turn only to sections 253-405. Any systematic arrangement of these notes would leave much to be desired; but the Index should help to give readers a more adequate idea of the con tents of this volume. 
Most of the work on this Index was done by Andrew Neal Sears in June, 1966, the month he graduated from Princeton University with bigh honors in philosophy. He made use of the work already done by Stephen R. Watson, and of a name index started some years ago by Stephen Brown, now M.D. It is a pleasure to express my gratitude to all three of them, and also to Princeton's excellent program of undergraduate research assistant ships. 
I supervised the work and at various stages made hundreds of additions.

R, J. HOLLINGDALE is an English writer, best kaown for his book Nietzsche: The Man and His Philosophy. 
PHILOSOPHY 
THE WILL POWER 
Nietzsche's notebooks, kept by him during his most produc tive years, offer a fascinating glimpse into the workshop and mind of a great thinker, and compare favorably with the notebooks of Gide and Kafka, Camus and Wittgenstein. The Will to Power, compiled from the notebooks, is one of the most famous books of the past hundred years, but few have studied it. Here, at last, is the first critical edition in any language. 
Down through the Nazi period The Will to Power was often mistakenly considered to be Nietzsche's crowning sys tematic labor; since World War II it has frequently been denigrated, just as fallaciously, as being not worth reading. In fact, it represents a stunning selection from Nietzsche's notebooks, in a topical arrangement that enables the reader to find what Nietzsche wrote on nihilism, art, morality, re ligion, the theory of knowledge, and whatever else inter ested him. But no previous edition-even in the original German-shows which notes Nietzsche utilized subse quently in his works, and which sections are not paralleled in the finished books. Nor has any previous edition furnished a commentary or index. 
Walter Kaufmann, in collaboration with R. J. Hollingdale, brings to this volume his unsurpassed skills as a Nietzsche translator and scholar. Professor Kaufmann has included the approximate date of each note. His running footnote com mentary offers the information needed to follow Nietzsche's train of thought, and indicates, among other things, which notes were eventually superseded by later formulations, and where all German editions, including the very latest, depart from the manuscripts. The comprehensive index serves to guide the reader to the extraordinary riches of this book. Cover design by Muriel Nasser
