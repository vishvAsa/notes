1. The Mechanical Interpretation of the World.



618.

Of all the interpretations of the world attempted heretofore, the *mechanical* one seems to-day to stand most prominently in the front. Apparently it has a clean conscience on its side; for no science believes inwardly in progress and success unless it be with the help of mechanical procedures. Every one knows these procedures: "reason" and "purpose" are allowed to remain out of consideration as far as possible; it is shown that, provided a sufficient amount of time be allowed to elapse, everything can evolve out of everything else, and no one attempts to suppress his malicious satisfaction, when the "apparent design in the fate" of a plant or of the yolk of an egg, may be traced to stress and thrust in short, people are heartily glad to pay respect to this principle of profoundest stupidity, if I may be allowed to pass a playful remark concerning these serious matters. Meanwhile, among the most select intellects to be found in this movement, some presentiment of evil, some anxiety is noticeable, as if the theory had a rent in it, which sooner or later might be its last: I mean the sort of rent which denotes the end of all balloons inflated with such theories.

Stress and thrust themselves cannot be "explained," one cannot get rid of the *actio in distans.* The belief even in the ability to explain is now lost, and people peevishly admit that one can only describe, not explain that the dynamic interpretation of the world, with its denial of "empty space" and its little agglomerations of atoms, will soon get the better of physicists: although in this way *Dynamis* is certainly granted an inner quality.



619.

The triumphant concept "*energy*" with which our physicists created God and the world, needs yet to be completed: it must be given an inner will which I characterise as the "*Will to Power*"—that is to say, as an insatiable desire to manifest power; or the application and exercise of power as a creative instinct, etc. Physicists cannot get rid of the "*actio in distans*" in their principles; any more than they can a repelling force \(or an attracting one\). There is no help for it, all movements, all "appearances," all "laws" must be understood as *symptoms* of an *inner* phenomenon, and the analogy of man must be used for this purpose. It is possible to trace all the instincts of an animal to the will to power; as also all the functions of organic life to this one source.





620.

Has anybody ever been able to testify to a *force\!* No, but to *effects,* translated into a completely strange language. Regularity in sequence has so spoilt us, *that we no longer wonder at the wonderful process.*



621.

A force of which we cannot form any idea, is an empty word, and ought to have no civic rights in the city of science: and the same applies to the purely mechanical powers of attracting and repelling by means of which we can form an image of the world—no more\!



622.

*Squeezes and kicks* are something incalculably recent, evolved and not primeval. They presuppose something which holds together and *can* press and strike\! But how could it hold together?



623.

There is nothing *unalterable* in chemistry: this is only appearance, a mere school prejudice. We it was who *introduced* the unalterable, taking it from metaphysics as usual, Mr. Chemist. It is a mere superficial judgment to declare that the diamond, graphite, and carbon are identical. Why? Simply because no loss of substance can be traced in the scales\! Well then, at least they have something in common; but the work of the molecules in the process of changing from one form to the other, an action we can neither see nor weigh, is just exactly what makes one material something different—with specifically different qualities.



624.

*Against* the physical *atom.*—In order to understand the world, we must be able to reckon it up; in order to be able to reckon it up, we must be aware of constant causes; but since we find no such constant causes in reality, we *invent* them for ourselves and call them atoms. This is the origin of the atomic theory.

The possibility of calculating the world, the possibility of expressing all phenomena by means of formulæ—is that really "understanding"? What would be understood of a piece of music, if all that were calculable in it and capable of being expressed in formulas, were reckoned up?—Thus "constant causes", things, substances, something "unconditioned," were therefore *invented*;—what has been attained thereby?



625.

The mechanical concept of "movement" is already a translation of the original process into the *language of symbols of the eye and the touch.*

The concept *atom,* the distinction between the "seat of a motive force and the force itself," is a *language of symbols derived from our logical and physical world.*

It does not lie within our power to alter our means of expression: it is possible to understand to what extend they are but symptomatic. To demand an *adequate means of expression is nonsense*: it lies at the heart of a language, of a medium of communication, to express *relation* only.... The concept "truth" is *opposed to good sense.* The whole province of truth—*falseness* only applies to the relations between beings, not to an "absolute." There is no such thing as a "being in itself" \(*relations* in the first place constitute being\), any more than there can be "knowledge in itself."



626.

"*The feeling of force* cannot proceed from movement: feeling in general cannot proceed from movement."

"Even in support of this, an apparent experience is the only evidence: in a substance \(brain\) feeling is generated through transmitted motion \(stimuli\). But generated? Would this show that the feeling did *not* yet exist there *at all*? so that its appearance would *have* to be regarded as the *creative act* of the intermediary—motion? The feelingless condition of this substance is only an hypothesis\! not an experience\! Feeling, therefore is the *quality* of the substance: there actually are substances that feel."

"Do we learn from certain substances that they have *no* feeling? No, we merely cannot tell that they have any. It is impossible to seek the origin of feeling in non-sensitive substance."—*Oh what hastiness\!*





627.

"To attract" and "to repel", in a purely mechanical sense, is pure fiction: a word. We cannot imagine an attraction without a *purpose.—* Either the will to possess one's self of a thing, or the will to defend one's self from a thing or to repel it—*that* we "understand"; that would be an interpretation which we could use.

In short, the psychological necessity of believing in causality lies in the *impossibility of imagining a process without a purpose*: but of course this says nothing concerning truth or untruth \(the justification of such a belief\)\! The belief in *causæ* collapses with the belief in τέλει \(against Spinoza and his causationism\).



628.

It is an illusion to suppose that something is *known,* when all we have is a mathematical formula of what has happened; it is only *characterised, described;* no more\!



629.

If I bring a regularly recurring phenomenon into a formula, I have facilitated and shortened my task of characterising the whole phenomenon, etc. But I have not thereby ascertained a "law," I have only replied to the question: How is it that something recurs here? It is a supposition that the formula corresponds to a complex of really unknown forces and the discharge of forces; it is pure mythology to suppose that forces here obey a law, so that, as the result of their obedience, we have the same phenomenon every time.



630.

I take good care not to speak of chemical "*laws*": to do so savours of morality. It is much more a question of establishing certain relations of power: the stronger becomes master of the weaker, in so far as the latter cannot maintain its degree of independence,—here there is no pity, no quarter, and, still less, any observance of "law."



631.

The unalterable sequence of certain phenomena does not prove any "law," but a relation of power between two or more forces. To say, "But it is precisely this relation that remains the same\!" is no better than saying, "One and the same force cannot be another force."—It is not a matter of *sequence,* but a matter of *interdependence,* a process in which the procession of moments do *not* determine each other after the manner of cause and effect....

The separation of the "action" from the "agent"; of the phenomenon from the *worker* of that phenomenon: of the process from one that is not process, but lasting, *substance,* thing, body, soul, etc.; the attempt to understand a life as a sort of shifting of things and a changing of places; of a sort of "being" or stable entity: this ancient mythology established the belief in "cause and effect," once it had found a lasting form in the functions of speech and grammar.



632.

The "regularity" of a sequence is only a metaphorical expression, not a fact, just *as if* a rule were followed here\! And the same holds good of "conformity to law." We find a formula in order to express an ever-recurring kind of succession of phenomena: but that does not show that we have *discovered a law*; much less a force which is the cause of a recurrence of effects. The fact that something always happens thus or thus, is interpreted here as if a creature always acted thus or thus as the result of obedience to a law or to a lawgiver: whereas apart from the "law" it would be free to act differently. But precisely that inability to act otherwise might originate in the creature itself, it might be that it did not act thus or thus in response to a law, but simply because it was so constituted. It would mean simply: that something cannot also be something else; that it cannot be first this, and then something quite different; that it is neither free nor the reverse, but merely thus or thus. *The fault lies in thinking a subject into things.*



633.

To speak of two consecutive states, the first as "cause," and the second as "effect," is false. The first state cannot bring about anything, the second has nothing effected in it.



It is a question of a struggle between two elements unequal in power: a new adjustment is arrived at, according to the measure of power each possesses. The second state is something fundamentally different from the first \(it is not its effect\): the essential thing Is, that the factors which engage in the struggle leave it with different quanta of power.



634.

*A. criticism of Materialism.*—Let us dismiss the two popular concepts, Necessity and Law, from this idea: the first introduces a false constraint, the second a false liberty into the world. "Things" do not act regularly, they follow no *rule:* there are no things \(that is our fiction\); neither do they act in accordance with any necessity. There is no obedience here: for, the fact that *something is* as it is, strong or weak, is not the result of obedience or of a rule or of a constraint....

The degree of resistance and the degree of superior power—this is the question around which all phenomena turn: if we, for our own purposes and calculations, know how to express this in formulas and "laws," all the better for us\! But that does not mean that we have introduced any "morality" into the world, just because we have fancied it as obedient.

There are no laws: every power draws its last consequence at every moment. Things are calculable precisely owing to the fact that there is no possibility of their being otherwise than they are.

A quantum of power is characterised by the effect it produces and the influence it resists. The adiaphoric state which would be thinkable in itself, is entirely lacking. It is essentially a will to violence and a will to defend one's self against violence. It is not self-preservation: every atom exercises its influence over the whole of existence—it is thought out of existence if one thinks this radiation of will-power away. That is why I call it a quantum of "*Will to Power*"; with this formula one can express the character which cannot be abstracted in thought from mechanical order, without suppressing the latter itself in thought.

The translation of the world of effect into a *visible* world—a world for the eye—is the concept "movement." Here it is always understood that *something* has been moved,—whether it be the fiction of an atomic globule or even of the abstraction of the latter, the dynamic atom, something is always imagined that has an effect—that is to say, we have not yet rid ourselves of the habit into which our senses and speech inveigled us. Subject and object, an agent to the action, the action and that which does it separated: we must not forget that all this signifies no more than semeiotics and—nothing real. Mechanics as a teaching of *movement* is already a translation of phenomena into man's language of the senses.



635.

We are in need of "unities" in order to be able to reckon: but this is no reason for supposing that "unities" actually *exist.* We borrowed the concept "unity" from our concept "ego,"—our very oldest article of faith. If we did not believe ourselves to be unities we should never have formed the concept "thing." Now—that is to say, somewhat late in the day, we are overwhelmingly convinced that our conception of the concept "ego" is no security whatever for a real entity. In order to maintain the mechanical interpretation of the world theoretically, we must always make the reserve that it is with fictions that we do so: the concept of *movement* \(derived from the language of our senses\) and the concept of the *atom* \(= entity, derived from our psychical experience\) are based upon a *sense-prejudice* and a *psychological prejudice.*

Mechanics formulates consecutive phenomena, and it does so semeiologically, in the terms of the senses and of the mind \(that all influence is *movement*; that where there is movement something is at work moving\): it does not touch the question of the causal force.

The *mechanical* world is imagined as the eye and the sense of touch alone could imagine a world \(as "moved"\),—in such a way as to be calculable,—as to simulate causal entities "things" \(atoms\) whose effect is constant \(the transfer of the false concept of subject to the concept atom\).

The mixing together of the concept of numbers, of the concept of thing \(the idea of subject\), of the concept of activity \(the separation of that which is the cause, and the effect\), of the concept of movement: all these things are phenomenal; our eye and our *psychology* are still in it all.

If we eliminate these adjuncts, nothing remains over but dynamic quanta, in a relation of tension to all other dynamic quanta: the essence of which resides in their relation to all other quanta, in their "influence" upon the latter. The will to power, not Being, not Becoming, but a *pathos*—is the elementary fact, from these first results a Becoming, an influencing....



636.

The physicists believe in a "true world" after their own kind; a fixed *systematising of atoms* to perform necessary movements, and holding good equally of all creatures, so that, according to them, the "world of appearance" reduces itself to the side of general and generally-needed Being, which is accessible to every one according to his kind \(accessible and also adjusted,—made "subjective"\). But here they are in error. The atom which they postulate is arrived at by the logic of that perspective of consciousness; it is in itself therefore a subjective fiction. This picture of the world which they project is in no way essentially different from the subjective picture: the only difference is, that it is composed simply with more extended senses, but certainly with *our* senses.... And in the end, without knowing it, they left something out of the constellation: precisely the necessary *perspective factor,* by means of which every centre of power—and not man alone—constructs the rest of the world *from its point of view*—that is to say, measures it, feels it, and moulds it according to its degree of strength.... They forgot to reckon with this perspective-fixing power, in "true being,"—or, in school-terms, subject-being. They suppose that this was "evolved" and added;—but even the chemical investigator needs it: it is indeed *specific Being,* which determines action and reaction according to circumstances.

*Perspectivity is only a complex form, of specificness.* My idea is that every specific body strives to become master of all space, and to extend its power \(its will to power\), and to thrust back everything that resists it. But inasmuch as it is continually meeting the same endeavours on the part of other bodies, it concludes by coming to terms with those \(by "combining" with those\) which are sufficiently related to it—*and thus they conspire together for power.* And the process continues.



637.

Even in the inorganic world all that concerns an atom of energy is its immediate neighbourhood: distant forces balance each other. Here is the root of *perspectivity,* and it explains why a living organism is "egoistic" to the core.



638.

Granting that the world disposed of a quantum of force, it is obvious that any transposition of force to any place would affect the whole system—thus, besides the causality of *sequence,* there would also be a dependence, *contiguity,* and *coincidence.*





639.

The only possible way of upholding the sense of the concept "God" would be: to make *Him not* the motive force, but the condition of *maximum power,* an *epoch;* a point in the further development of the *Will to Power;* by means of which subsequent evolution just as much as former evolution—up to Him—could be explained.

Viewed mechanically, the energy of collective Becoming remains constant; regarded from the economical standpoint, it ascends to its zenith and then recedes therefrom in order to remain eternally rotatory. This "*Will to Power*" expresses itself in the *interpretation in the manner in which the strength is used.*—The conversion of energy into life; "life in its highest power" thenceforward appears as the goal. The same amount of energy, at different stages of development, means different things.

That which determines growth in Life is the economy which becomes ever more sparing and methodical, which achieves ever more and more with a steadily decreasing amount of energy.... The ideal is the principle of the least possible expense....

The only thing *that is proved* is that the world is *not* striving towards a state of stability. Consequently its zenith must not be conceived as a state of absolute equilibrium....

The dire necessity of the same things happening in the course of the world, as in all other things, is not an eternal determinism reigning over all phenomena, but merely the expression of the fact that the impossible is not possible; that a given force cannot be different from that given force; that a given quantity of resisting force does not manifest itself otherwise than in conformity with its degree of strength;—to speak of events as being necessary is tautological.



* * *



2. The Will to Power as Life.

* * *

*\(a\) The Organic Process.*



640.

Man imagines that he was present at the generation of the organic world: what was there to be observed, with the eyes and the touch, in regard to these processes? How much of it can be put into round numbers? What rules are noticeable in the movements? Thus, man would fain arrange all phenomena as if they were *for the eye and for the touch,* as if they were forms of motion: he will discover *formules* wherewith to *simplify* the unwieldy mass of these experiences.

*The reduction of all phenomena* to the level of men with senses and with mathematics. It is a matter of making *an inventory of human experiences:* granting that man, or rather the *human eye and the ability to form concepts,* have been the eternal witnesses of all things.



641.

A plurality of forces bound by a common nutritive process we call "Life." To this nutritive process all so-called feeling, thinking, and imagining belong as means—that is to say, \(1\) in the form of opposing other forces; \(2\) in the form of an adjustment of other forces according to mould and rhythm; \(3\) the form of a valuation relative to assimilation and excretion.



642.

The bond between the inorganic and the organic world must lie in the repelling power exercised by every atom of energy. "Life" might be defined as a lasting form of *force-establishing processes,* in which the various contending forces, on their part, grow unequally. To what extent does counter-strife exist even in obedience? Individual power is by no means surrendered through it. In the same way, there exists in the act of commanding, an acknowledgment of the fact that the absolute power of the adversary has not been overcome, absorbed, or dissipated. "Obedience," and "command," are forms of the game of war.



643.

The Will to Power *interprets* \(an organ in the process of formation has to be interpreted\): it defines, it determines gradations, differences of power. Mere differences of power could not be aware of each other as such: something must be there which *will* grow, and which interprets all other things that would do the same, according to the value of the latter. In sooth, all interpretation is but a means in itself to become master of something. \(Continual *interpretation* is the first principle of the organic process.\)



644.

Greater complexity, sharp differentiation, the contiguity of the developed organs and functions, with the disappearance of intermediate members—if *that* is *perfection,* then there is a Will to Power apparent in the organic process by means of whose *dominating, shaping,* and *commanding* forces it is continually increasing the sphere of its power, and persistently simplifying things within that sphere, it *grows* imperatively.

"Spirit" is only a means and an instrument in the service of higher life, in the service of the elevation of life.



645.

"*Heredity,*" as something quite incomprehensible, cannot be used as an explanation, but only as a designation for the identification of a problem. And the same holds good of "*adaptability.*" As a matter of fact, the account of morphology, even supposing it were perfect, *explains* nothing, it merely describes an enormous fact. *How* a given organ gets to be used for any particular purpose is not explained. There is just as little explained in regard to these things by the assumption of *causæ finales* as by the assumption of *causæ efficientes.* The concept "causa" is only a means of expression, no *more*; a means of designating a thing.





646.

They are analogies; for instance, our *memory* may suggest another kind of memory which makes itself felt in heredity, development, and forms. Our *inventive* and experimentative powers suggest another kind of inventiveness in the application of instruments to new ends, etc.

That which we call our "*consciousness*" is quite guiltless of any of the essential processes of our preservation and growth; and no human brain could be so subtle as to construct anything more than a machine—to which every organic process is infinitely superior.



647.

*Against Darwinism.*—The use of an organ does *not* explain its origin, on the contrary\! During the greater part of the time occupied in the formation of a certain quality, this quality does not help to preserve the individual; it is of no use to him, and particularly not in his struggle with external circumstances and foes.

What is ultimately "useful"? It is necessary to ask, "Useful for what"?

For instance, that which promotes the *lasting powers* of the individual might be unfavourable to his strength or his beauty; that which preserves him might at the same time fix him and keep him stable throughout development. On the other hand, a *deficiency,* a state of *degeneration,* may be of the greatest possible use, inasmuch as it acts as a stimulus to other organs. In the same way, a *state of need* may be a condition of existence, inasmuch as it reduces an individual to that modicum of means which, though it *keeps him together,* does not allow him to squander his strength.—The individual himself is the struggle of parts \(for nourishment, space, etc.\): his development involves the *triumph,* the *predominance,* of isolated parts; the *wasting away,* or the "development into organs," of other parts.

The influence of "environment" is nonsensically *overrated* in Darwin, the essential factor in the process of life is precisely the tremendous inner power to shape and to create forms, which merely *uses, exploits* "environment."

The new forms built up by this inner power are not produced with a view to any end; but, in the struggle between the parts, a new form does not exist long *without* becoming related to some kind of semi-utility, and, according to its use, develops itself ever more and more perfectly.



648.

"Utility" in respect of the acceleration of the speed of evolution, is a different kind of "utility" from that which is understood to mean the greatest possible stability and staying power of the evolved creature.



649.

"Useful" in the sense of Darwinian biology means: that which favours a thing in its struggle with others. But in my opinion the *feeling of being surcharged,* the feeling accompanying an *increase in strength,* quite apart from the utility of the struggle, is the actual *progress*: from these feelings the will to war is first derived.



650.

Physiologists should bethink themselves before putting down the instinct of self-preservation as the cardinal instinct of an organic being. A living thing seeks above all to *discharge* its strength: "*self-preservation"* is only one of the results thereof.—Let us beware of *superfluous* teleological principles\!—one of which is the whole concept of "self-preservation."\[4\]




\[4\] See *Beyond Good and Evil,* in this edition, Aph. 13.




651.

The most-fundamental—and most primeval activity of a protoplasm cannot be ascribed to a will to self-preservation, for it absorbs an amount of material which is absurdly out of proportion with the needs of its preservation: and what is more, it does *not* "preserve itself" in the process, but actually falls to *pieces....* The instinct which rules here, must account for this total absence in the organism of a desire to preserve itself: hunger is already an interpretation based upon the observation of a more or less complex organism \(hunger is a specialised and later form of the instinct; it is an expression of the system of divided labour, in the service of a higher instinct which rules the whole\).





652.

It is just as impossible to regard *hunger* as the *primum mobile,* as it is to take self-preservation to be so. Hunger, considered as the result of insufficient nourishment, means hunger as the result of a will to power *which can no longer dominate* It is not a question of replacing a loss, it is only later on, as the result of the division of labour, when the Will to Power has discovered other and quite different ways of gratifying itself, that the appropriating lust of the organism is *reduced* to hunger—to the need of replacing what has been lost.



653.

We can but laugh at the false "*Altruism*" of biologists: propagation among the amœbæ appears as a process of jetsam, as an advantage to them. It is an excretion of useless matter.



654.

The division of a protoplasm into two takes place when its power is no longer sufficient to subjugate the matter it has appropriated: procreation is the result of impotence.

In the cases in which the males seek the females and become one with them, procreation is the result of hunger.



655.

The weaker vessel is driven to the stronger from a need of nourishment; it desires to get under it, if possible to become *one* with it. The stronger, on the contrary, defends itself from others; it refuses to perish in this way; it prefers rather to split itself into two or more parts in the process of growing. One may conclude that the greater the urgency seems to become one with something else, the more weakness in some form is present. The greater the tendency to variety, difference, inner decay, the more strength is actually to hand.

The instinct to cleave to something, and the instinct to repel something, are in the inorganic as in the organic world, the uniting bond. The whole distinction is a piece of hasty judgment.

The will to power in every combination of forces, *defending itself against the stronger and coming down unmercifully upon the weaker, is more correct.*

N. B. *All processes may be regarded as "beings".*



656.

The will to power can manifest itself only against *obstacles;* it therefore goes in search of what resists it—this is the primitive tendency of the protoplasm when it extends its *pseudopodia* and feels about it. The act of appropriation and assimilation is, above all, the result of a desire to overpower, a process of forming, of additional building and rebuilding, until at last the subjected creature has become completely a part of the superior creature's sphere of power, and has increased the latter.—If this process of incorporation does not succeed, then the whole organism falls to pieces; and the *separation* occurs as the result of the will to power: in order to prevent the escape of that which has been subjected, the will to power falls into two wills \(under some circumstances without even abandoning completely its relation to the two\).

"Hunger" is only a more narrow adaptation, once the fundamental instinct of power has won power of a more abstract kind.



657.

What is "passive"?
>
>
> To be hindered in the outward movement of grasping: it is thus an act of resistance and reaction.


What is "active"?

> To stretch out for power.


"Nutrition"...

"Procreation"...

"Pleasure"...

> Is a feeling of power \(presupposing the existence of pain\).




658.

\(1\) The organic functions shown to be but forms of the fundamental will, the will to power,—and buds thereof.

\(2\) The will to power specialises itself as will to nutrition, to property, to *tools,* to servants \(obedience\), and to rulers: the body as an example.—The stronger will directs the weaker. There is no other form of causality than that of will to will. It is not to be explained mechanically.

\(3\) Thinking, feeling, willing, in all living organisms. What is a desire if it be not: a provocation of the feeling of power by an obstacle \(or, better still, by rhythmical obstacles and resisting forces\)—so that it surges through it? Thus in all pleasure pain is understood.—If the pleasure is to be very great, the pains preceding it must have been very long, and the whole bow of life must have been strained to the utmost.

\(4\) Intellectual functions. The will to shaping, forming, and making like, etc.



* * *



*\(b\) Man.*



659.

*With the body as clue.*—Granting that the "*soul*" was only an attractive and mysterious thought, from which philosophers rightly, but reluctantly, separated themselves—that which they have since learnt to put in its place is perhaps even more attractive and even more mysterious. The human *body,* in which the whole of the most distant and most recent past of all organic life once more becomes living and corporal, seems to flow through, this past and right over it like a huge and inaudible torrent; the body is a more wonderful thought than the old "soul." In all ages the body, as our actual property, as our most certain being, in short, as our ego, has been more earnestly believed in than the spirit \(or the "soul," or the subject, as the school jargon now calls it\). It has never occurred to any one to regard his stomach as a strange or a divine stomach; but that there is a tendency and a predilection in man to regard all his thoughts as "inspired," all his values as "imparted to him by a God," all his instincts as dawning activities—this is proved by the evidence of every age in man's history. Even now, especially among artists, there may very often be noticed a sort of wonder, and a deferential hesitation to decide, when the question occurs to them, by what means they achieved their happiest work, and from which world the creative thought came down to them: when they question in this way, they are possessed by a feeling of guilelessness and childish shyness. They dare not say: "That came from me; it was my hand which threw that die." Conversely, even those philosophers and theologians, who in their logic and piety found the most imperative reasons for regarding their body as a deception \(and even as a deception overcome and disposed of\), could not help recognising the foolish fact that the body still remained: and the most unexpected proofs of this are to be found partly in Pauline and partly in Vedantic philosophy. But what does *strength of faith* ultimately mean? Nothing\!—A strong faith might also be a foolish faith\!—There is food for reflection.

And supposing the faith in the body were ultimately but the result of a conclusion; supposing it were a false conclusion, as idealists declare it is, would it not then involve some doubt concerning the trustworthiness of the spirit itself which thus causes us to draw wrong conclusions?

Supposing the plurality of things, and space, and time, and motion \(and whatever the other first principles of a belief in the body may be\) were errors—what suspicions would not then be roused against the spirit which led us to form such first principles? Let it suffice that the belief in the body is, at any rate for the present, a much stronger belief than the belief in the spirit, and he who would fain undermine it assails the authority of the spirit most thoroughly in so doing\!



660.

*The Body as an Empire.*

The aristocracy in the body, the majority of the rulers \(the fight between the cells and the tissues\).

Slavery and the division of labour: the higher type alone possible through the *subjection* of the lower to a function.



Pleasure and pain, not contraries. The feeling of power.

"Nutrition" only a result of the insatiable lust of appropriation in the Will to Power.

"Procreation": this is the decay which supervenes when the ruling cells are too weak to organise appropriated material.

It is the *moulding* force which will have a continual supply of new material \(more "force"\). The masterly construction of an organism out of an egg.

"The mechanical interpretation": recognises only quantities: but the real energy is in the quality. Mechanics can therefore only describe processes; it cannot explain them.

"Purpose." We should start out from the "sagacity" of plants.

The concept of "meliorism": *not* only greater complexity, but greater *power* \(it need not be only greater masses\).

Conclusion concerning the evolution of man: the road to perfection lies in the bringing forth of the most powerful individuals, for whose use the great masses would be converted into mere tools \(that is to say, into the most intelligent and flexible tools possible\).



661.

Why is all *activity,* even that of a *sense,* associated with pleasure? Because, before the activity was possible, an obstacle or a burden was done away with. Or, rather, because all action is a process of overcoming, of becoming master of, and of *increasing* the *feeling of power*? The pleasure of thought. Ultimately it is not only the feeling of power, but also the pleasure of creating and of contemplating the *creation:* for all activity enters our consciousness in the form of "works."



662.

Creating is an act of selecting and of finishing the thing selected. \(In every act of the will, this is the essential element.\)



663.

All phenomena which are the result of intentions may be reduced to *the intention of increasing power.*



664.

When we do anything, we are conscious of a *feeling of strength;* we often have this sensation before the act—that is to say, while imagining the thing to do \(as, for instance, at the sight of an enemy, of an obstacle, which we feel *equal to*\): it is always an accompanying sensation. Instinctively we think that this feeling of strength is the cause of the action, that it is the "motive force." Our belief in causation is the belief in force and its effect; it is a transcript of our experience: in which we identify force and the feeling of force.—Force, however, never moves things; the strength which is conscious "does not set the muscles moving." "Of such a process we have no experience, no idea." "We experience as little concerning force as a motive power, as concerning the *necessity* of a movement." Force is said to be the constraining element\! "All we know is that one thing follows another;—we know nothing of either compulsion or arbitrariness in regard to the one following the other. Causality is first invented by thinking compulsion into the sequence of processes. A certain "understanding" of the thing is the result—that is to say, we humanise the process a little, we make it more "familiar"; the familiar is the known habitual fact of *human compulsion associated with the feeling of force.*



665.

I have the intention of extending my arm; taking it for granted that I know as little of the physiology of the human body and of the mechanical laws of its movements as the man in the street, what could there be more vague, more bloodless, more uncertain than this intention compared with what follows it? And supposing I were the astutest of mechanics, and especially conversant with the formulæ which are applicable in this case, I should not be able to extend my arm one whit the better. Our "knowledge" and our "action" in this case lie coldly apart: as though in two different regions.—Again: Napoleon carries out a plan of campaign—what does that mean? In this case, everything concerning the consummation of the campaign is *known,* because everything must be done through words of command: but even here subordinates are taken for granted, who apply and adapt the general plan to the particular emergency, to the degree of strength, etc.



666.

For ages we have always ascribed the value of an action, of a character, of an existence, to the *intention,* to the *purpose* for which it was done, acted, or lived: this primeval idiosyncrasy of taste ultimately takes a dangerous turn provided the lack of intention and purpose in all phenomena comes ever more to the front in consciousness. With it a general depreciation of all values seems to be preparing: "All is without sense."—This melancholy phrase means: "All sense lies in the intention, and if the intention is absolutely lacking, then sense must be lacking too." In conformity with this valuation, people were forced to place the value of life in a a life after death, or in the progressive development of ideas, or of mankind, or of the people, or of man to superman; but in this way the *progressus in infinitum* of purpose had been reached: it was ultimately necessary to find one's self a place in the process of the world \(perhaps with the disdæmonistic outlook, it was a process which led to nonentity\).

In regard to this point, "*purpose*" needs a somewhat more severe criticism: it ought to be recognised that an action *is never caused by a purpose;* that an object and the means thereto are interpretations, by means of which certain points in a phenomena are selected and accentuated, at the cost of other, more numerous, points, that every time something is done for a purpose, something fundamentally different, and yet other things happen; that in regard to the action done with a purpose, the case is the same as with the so-called purposefulness of the heat which is radiated from the sun: the greater part of the total sum is squandered; a portion of it, which is scarcely worth reckoning, has a "purpose," has "sense"; that an "end" with its "means" is an absurdly indefinite description, which indeed may be able to command as a precept, as "will," but presupposes a system of obedient and trained instruments, which, in the place of the indefinite, puts forward a host of determined entities *\(i.e.* we imagine a system of *clever* but narrow intellects who postulate end and means, in order to be able to grant our only known "end," the rôle of the "cause of an action,"—a proceeding to which we have no right: it is tantamount to solving a problem by placing its solution in an inaccessible world which we cannot observe\).

Finally, why could not an "end" be merely an *accompanying feature* in the series of changes among the active forces which bring about the action—a pale stenographic symbol stretched in consciousness beforehand, and which serves as a guide to what happens, even as a symbol of what happens, *not* as its cause?—But in this way we criticise *will* itself: is it not an illusion to regard that which enters consciousness as will-power, as a cause? Are not all conscious phenomena only final phenomena—the lost links in a chain, but apparently conditioning one another in their sequence within the plane of consciousness? This might be an illusion.



667.

Science does *not* inquire what impels us to will: on the contrary, it *denies* that *willing* takes place at all, and supposes that something quite different has happened—in short, that the belief in "will" and "end" is an illusion. It does not inquire into the *motives* of an action, as if these had been present in consciousness previous to the action, but it first divides the action up into a group of phenomena, and then seeks the previous history of this mechanical movement—but *not* in the terms of feeling, perception, and thought; from this quarter it can never accept the explanation: perception is precisely the matter of science, *which has to be explained.*—The problem of science is precisely to explain the world, *without* taking perceptions as the cause: for that would mean regarding *perceptions* themselves as the *cause* of perceptions. The task of science is by no means accomplished.

Thus: either there is *no* such thing as will,—the hypothesis of science,—or the will is *free*. The latter assumption represents the prevailing feeling, of which we cannot rid ourselves, even if the hypothesis of science were *proved.*

The popular belief in cause and effect is founded on the principle that free will *is the cause of every effect:* thereby alone do we arrive at the feeling of causation. And thereto belongs also the feeling that every cause is *not* an effect, but always only a cause—if will is the cause. "Our acts of will are *not necessary*"—this lies in the very *concept of "will."* The effect necessarily comes *after* the cause—that is what we feel. It is merely a *hypothesis* that even our willing is compulsory in every case.



668.

"To will" is not "to desire," to strive, to aspire to; it distinguishes itself from that through the *passion of commanding.*

There is no such thing as "willing," but only the willing of *something:* the *aim* must not be severed from the state—as the epistemologists sever it. "Willing," as they understand it, is no more possible than "thinking": it is a pure invention.

It is essential to willing that something should be *commanded* \(but that does not mean that the will is carried into effect\).

The general *state of tension,* by virtue of which a force seeks to discharge itself, is not "willing."



669.

"Pain" and "pleasure" are the most absurd *means of expressing* judgments, which of course does not mean that the judgments which are enunciated in this way must necessarily be absurd. The elimination of all substantiation and logic, a yes or no in the reduction to a passionate desire to have or to reject, an imperative abbreviation, the utility of which is irrefutable: that is pain and pleasure. Its origin is in the central sphere of the intellect; its prerequisite is an infinitely accelerated process of perceiving, ordering, co-ordinating, calculating, concluding: pleasure and pain are always final phenomena, they are never causes.

As to deciding what provokes pain and pleasure, that is a question which depends upon the *degree of power:* the same thing, when confronted with a small quantity of power, may seem a danger and may suggest the need of speedy defence, and when confronted with the consciousness of greater power, may be a voluptuous stimulus and may be followed by a feeling of pleasure.

All feelings of pleasure and pain presuppose a *measuring of collective utility* and *collective harmfulness*: consequently a sphere where there is the willing of an object \(of a condition\) and the selection of the means thereto. Pleasure and pain are never "original facts."

The feelings of pleasure and pain are *reactions of the will* \(emotions\) in which the intellectual centre fixes the value of certain supervening changes as a collective value, and also as an introduction of contrary actions.



670.

*The belief in "emotions"*—Emotions are a fabrication of the intellect, an invention of *causes* which do not exist. All general *bodily sensations* which we do not understand are interpreted intellectually—that is to say, a *reason* is sought why we feel thus or thus among certain people or in certain experiences. Thus something disadvantageous dangerous, and strange is taken for granted, as if it were the cause of our being indisposed; as a matter of fact, it gets *added to* the indisposition, so as to make our condition thinkable.—Mighty rushes of blood to the brain, accompanied by a feeling of suffocation, are *interpreted* as anger: the people and things which provoke our anger are a means of relieving our physiological condition. Subsequently, after long habituation, certain processes and general feelings are so regularly correlated that the sight of certain processes provokes that condition of general feeling, and induces vascular engorgements, the ejection of seminal fluid, etc.: we then say that the "emotion is provoked by propinquity."

*Judgments* already inhere in pleasure and pain: stimuli become differentiated, according as to whether they increase or reduce the feeling of power.

*The belief in willing.* To believe that a thought may be the cause of a mechanical movement is to believe in miracles. The *consistency of science* demands that once we have made the world *thinkable* for ourselves by means of pictures, we should also make the emotions, the desires, the will, etc., *thinkable*—that is to say, we should *deny* them and treat them as *errors of the intellect.*



671.

Free will or no free will?—There is *no such thing* as "*Will*": that is only a simplified conception on the part of the understanding, like "matter."

*All actions must first be prepared and made possible mechanically before they can be willed.* Or, *in most cases* the "*object*" of an action enters the brain only after everything is prepared for its accomplishment. The object is an inner "stimulus"—nothing *more.*



672.

The most proximate prelude to an action relates to that action: but *further back still* there lies a preparatory history which covers *a far wider field:* the individual action is only a factor in a much more extensive and *subsequent* fact. The shorter and the longer processes are not reported.



673.

The theory of *chance:* the soul is a selecting and self-nourishing being, which is persistently extremely clever and creative \(this *creative* power is commonly overlocked\! it is taken to be merely passive\).

I recognised the *active* and creative *power* within the accidental.—Accident is in itself nothing more than *the clashing of creative impulses.*



674.

Among the enormous multiplicity of phenomena to be observed in an organic being, that part which becomes *conscious* is a mere means: and the particle of "virtue," "self abnegation," and other fanciful inventions, are denied in a most thoroughgoing manner by the whole of the remaining phenomena. We would do well to study our organism in all its immorality....

The animal functions are, as a matter of fact, a million times more important than all beautiful states of the soul and heights of consciousness: the latter are an overflow, in so far as they are not needed as instruments in the service of the animal functions. The whole of *conscious* life: the spirit together with the soul, the heart, goodness, and virtue; in whose service does it work? In the greatest possible perfection of the means \(for acquiring nourishment and advancement\) serving the fundamental animal functions: above all, the *ascent of the line of Life.*

That which is called "flesh" and "body" is of such incalculably greater importance, that the rest is nothing more than a small appurtenance. To continue the chain of life *so that it becomes ever more powerful*—that is the task.

But now observe how the heart, the soul, virtue, and spirit together conspire formally to thwart this purpose: as *if they* were the object of every endeavour\! ... The *degeneration of life* is essentially determined by the extraordinary *fallibility of consciousness,* which is held at bay least of all by the instincts, and thus commits the gravest and profoundest *errors.*

Now could any more insane extravagance of vanity be imagined than to measure the *value* of existence according to the *pleasant or unpleasant feelings of this consciousness*? It is obviously only a means: and pleasant or unpleasant feelings are also no more than means.

According to what standard is the objective value measured? According to the quantity of *increased* and *more organised power* alone.



675.

The value of all *valuing.*—My desire would be to see the agent once more identified with the action, after action has been deprived of all meaning by having been separated in thought from the agent; I should like to see the notion of doing *something,* the idea of a "purpose," of an "intention," of an object, reintroduced into the action, after action has been made insignificant by having been artificially separated from these things.

All "objects," "purposes," "meanings," are only manners of expression and metamorphoses of the one will inherent in all phenomena; of the will to power. To have an object, a purpose, or an intention, in fact *to will* generally, is equivalent to the desire for *greater strength,* for fuller growth, and for the *means* thereto *in addition.*

The most general and fundamental instinct in all action and willing is precisely on that account the one which is least known and is most concealed; for in practice we always follow its bidding, for the simple reason that we *are* in ourselves its bidding....

All valuations are only the results of, and the narrow points of view in *servings this* one will: valuing *in itself* is nothing save this, *—will to power.*



To criticise existence from the standpoint of any one of these values is utter nonsense and error. Even supposing that a process of annihilation follows from such a value, even so this process is in the service of this will.

The *valuation of existence itself\!* But existence is this valuing itself\!—and even when we say "no," we still do what we *are.*

We ought now to perceive the *absurdity* of this pretence at judging existence; and we ought to try and discover *what* actually takes place there. It is symptomatic.



676.

*Concerning the Origin of our Valuations.*

We are able to analyse our body, and by doing so we get the same idea of it as of the stellar system, and the differences between organic and inorganic lapses. Formerly the movements of the stars were explained as the effects of beings consciously pursuing a purpose: this is no longer required, and even in regard to the movements of the body and its changes, the belief has long since been abandoned that they can be explained by an appeal to a consciousness which has a determined purpose. By far the greater number of movements have nothing to do with consciousness at all: *neither have they anything to do with sensation.* Sensations and thoughts are extremely *rare* and *insignificant* things compared with the innumerable phenomena occurring every second.

On the other hand, we believe that a certain conformity of means to ends rules over the very smallest phenomenon, which it is quite beyond our deepest science to understand; a sort of cautiousness, selectiveness, co-ordination, and repairing process, etc. In short, we are in the presence of an *activity* to which it would be necessary to ascribe an *incalculably higher and more extensive intellect* than the one we are acquainted with. We learn to *think less of* all that is conscious: we unlearn the habit of making ourselves responsible for ourselves, because, as conscious beings fixing purposes, we are but the smallest part of ourselves.

Of the numerous influences taking effect every second, for instance, air, electricity, we feel scarcely anything at all. There might be a number of forces, which, though they never make themselves felt by us, yet influence us continually. Pleasure and pain are very rare and scanty phenomena, compared with the countless stimuli with which a cell or an organ operates upon another cell or organ.

It is the phase of the *modesty of consciousness.* Finally, we can grasp the conscious ego itself, merely as an instrument in the service of that higher and more extensive intellect: and then we may ask whether all conscious *willing,* all conscious *purposes,* all *valuations,* are not perhaps only means by virtue of which something essentially *different is attained,* from that which consciousness supposes. We *mean*: it is a question of our *pleasure* and *pain* but pleasure and pain might be the means whereby we *had something to do* which lies outside our consciousness.



This is to show how very *superficial* all conscious phenomena really are; how an action and the image of it differ; how *little* we know about what *precedes* an action; how fantastic our feelings, "freewill," and "cause and effect" are; how thoughts and images, just like words, are only signs of thoughts; the impossibility of finding the grounds of any action; the superficiality of all praise and blame; how *essentially our* conscious life is composed of *fancies* and *illusion*; how all our words merely stand for fancies \(our emotions too\), and how the *union of mankind* depends upon the transmission and continuation of these fancies: whereas, at bottom, the real union of mankind by means of procreation pursues its unknown way. Does this belief in the common fancies of men really *alter* mankind? Or is the whole body of ideas and valuations only an expression in itself of unknown changes? *Are there* really such things as will, purposes, thoughts, values? Is the whole of conscious life perhaps no more than *mirage*? Even when values seem to *determine* the actions of a man, they are, as a matter of fact, doing something quite different\! In short, granting that a certain conformity of means to end might be demonstrated in the action of nature, without the assumption of a ruling ego: could not *our* notion of purposes, and our will, etc., be only a *symbolic language* standing for something quite different—that is to say, something not-willing and unconscious? only the thinnest semblance of that natural conformity of means to end in the organic world, but not in any way different therefrom?



Briefly, perhaps the whole of mental development is a matter of the *body:* it is the consciously recorded history of the fact that a *higher body is forming.* The organic ascends to higher regions. Our longing to know Nature is a means by virtue of which the body would reach perfection. Or, better still, hundreds of thousands of experiments are made to alter the nourishment and the mode of living of the *body*: the body's consciousness and valuations, its kinds of pleasure and pain, are *signs of these changes and experiments. In the end, it is not a question concerning man; for he must be surpassed.*



677.

*To what Extent are all Interpretations of the World Symptoms of a Ruling Instinct.*

The *artistic* contemplation of the world: to sit before the world and to survey it. But here the analysis of æsthetical contemplation, its reduction to cruelty, its feeling of security, its judicial and detached attitude, etc., are lacking. The artist himself must be taken, together with his psychology \(the criticism of the instinct of play, as a discharge of energy, the love of change, the love of bringing one's soul in touch with strange things, the absolute egoism of the artist, etc.\). What instincts does he sublimate?

The *scientific* contemplation of the world: a criticism of the psychological longing for science, the desire to make everything comprehensible; the desire to make everything practical, useful, capable of being exploited—to what extent this is anti-æsthetic. Only that value counts, which may be reckoned in figures. How it happens that a mediocre type of man preponderates under the influence of science. It would be terrible if even history were to be taken possession of in this way—the realm of the superior, of the judicial. What instincts are here sublimated\!

The religious contemplation of the world: a criticism of the religious man. It is not necessary to take the moral man as the type, but the man who has extreme feelings of exaltation and of deep depression, and who interprets the former with thankfulness or suspicion without, however, seeking their origin in *himself* \(nor the latter either\). The man who essentially feels anything but free, who sublimates his conditions and states of submission.

The *moral* contemplation of the world. The feelings peculiar to certain social ranks are projected into the universe: stability, law, the making of things orderly, and the making of things alike, are *sought* in the highest spheres, because they are valued most highly,—above everything or behind everything.

What is *common* to all: the ruling instincts *wish to be regarded* as *the highest values in general,* even as the *creative* and *ruling powers.* It is understood that these instincts either oppose or overcome each other \(join up synthetically, or alternate in power\). Their profound antagonism is, however, so great, that in those cases in which they *all* insist upon being gratified, a man of very thorough *mediocrity* is the outcome.





678.

It is a question whether the origin of our apparent "knowledge" is not also a mere offshoot of our *older valuations,* which are so completely assimilated that they belong to the very basis of our nature. In this way only *the more recent* needs engage in battle *with results of the oldest needs.*

The world is seen, felt, and interpreted thus and thus, in order that organic life may be preserved with this particular manner of interpretation. Man is *not* only an individual, but the continuation of collective organic life in one definite line. The fact that *man* survives, proves that a certain species of interpretations \(even though it still be added to\) has also survived; that, as a system, this method of interpreting has not changed. "Adaptation."

Our "dissatisfaction," our "ideal," etc., may possibly be the *result* of this incorporated piece of interpretation, of our particular point of view: the organic world may ultimately perish owing to it just as the division of labour in organisms may be the means of bringing about the ruin of the whole, if one part happen to wither or weaken. The *destruction* of organic life, and even of the highest form thereof, must follow the same principles as the destruction of the individual.



679.

Judged from the standpoint of the theory of descent, *individuation* shows the continuous breaking up of one into two, and the equally continuous annihilation of individuals *for the sake of a few* individuals, which evolution bears onwards; the greater mass always perishes \("the body"\).

The fundamental phenomena: *innumerable individuals are sacrificed for the sake of a few,* in order to make the few possible.—One must not allow one's self to be deceived; the case is the same with *peoples* and *races*: they produce the "body" for the generation of isolated and valuable *individuals,* who continue the great process.



680.

I am opposed to the theory that the individual studies the interests of the *species,* or of posterity, at the cost of his own advantage: all this is only apparent.

The excessive importance which he attaches to the *sexual instinct* is not the *result* of the latter's importance to the species, for procreation is the actual performance of the individual, it is his greatest interest, and therefore it is his *highest expression of power* \(not judged from the standpoint of consciousness, but from the very centre of the individual\).



681.

The *fundamental errors* of the biologists who have lived hitherto: it is not a matter of the species, but of rearing stronger individuals \(the many are only a means\).

Life is *not* the continuous adjustment of internal relations to external relations, but will to power, which, proceeding from inside, subjugates and incorporates an ever-increasing quantity of "external" phenomena.

These biologists *continue* the moral valuations \("the absolutely higher worth of Altruism," the antagonism towards the lust of dominion, towards war, towards all that which is not useful, and towards all order of rank and of class\).



682.

In natural science, the moral depreciation of the *ego* still goes hand in hand with the overestimation of the *species.* But the species is quite as illusory as the ego: a false distinction has been made. The ego is a hundred times *more* than a mere unit in a chain of creatures; it is the chain *itself,* in every possible respect, and the species is merely an abstraction suggested by the multiplicity and partial similarity of these chains. That the individual is *sacrificed* to the species, as people often say he is, is not a fact at all: it is rather only an example of false interpretation.



683.

The formula of the *"progress"-superstition* according to a famous physiologist of the cerebral regions:—

*"L'animal ne fait jamais de progrès comme espèce. L'homme seul fait de progrès comme espèce.*"

No.





684.

*Anti-Darwin.*—The *domestication of man:* what definite value can it have, or has domestication in itself a definite value?—There are reasons for denying the latter proposition.

Darwin's school of thought certainly goes to great pains to convince us of the reverse: it would fain prove that the influence of domestication may be profound and fundamental. For the time being, we stand firmly as we did before; up to the present no results save very superficial modification or degeneration have been shown to follow upon domestication. And everything that escapes from the hand and discipline of man, returns almost immediately to its original natural condition. The type remains constant, man cannot "*dénaturer la nature*."

Biologists reckon upon the struggle for existence, the death of the weaker creature and the survival of the most robust, most gifted combatant; on that account they imagine a *continuous increase in the perfection of all creatures.* We, on the contrary, have convinced ourselves of the fact, that in the struggle for existence, accident serves the cause of the weak quite as much as that of the strong; that craftiness often supplements strength with advantage; that the *prolificness* of a species is related in a remarkable manner to that species *chances of destruction*....

*Natural Selection* is also credited with the power of slowly effecting unlimited metamorphoses: it is believed that every advantage is transmitted by heredity, and strengthened in the course of generations \(when heredity is known to be so capricious that ...\); the happy adaptations of certain creatures to very special conditions of life, are regarded as the result of *surrounding influences.* Nowhere, however, are examples of *unconscious selection* to be found \(absolutely nowhere\). The most different individuals associate one with the other; the extremes become lost in the mass. Each vies with the other to maintain his kind; those creatures whose appearance shields them from certain dangers, do not alter this appearance when they are in an environment quite devoid of danger.... If they live in places where their coats or their hides do not conceal them, they do not adapt themselves to their surroundings in any way.

The *selection of the most beautiful* has been so exaggerated, that it greatly exceeds the instincts for beauty in our own race\! As a matter of fact, the most beautiful creature often couples with the most debased, and the largest with the smallest. We almost always see males and females taking advantage of their first chance meeting, and manifesting no taste or selectiveness at all.—Modification through climate and nourishment—but as a matter of fact unimportant.

There are no *intermediate forms.—*

The growing evolution of creatures is assumed. All grounds for this assumption are entirely lacking. Every type has its *limitations*: beyond these evolution cannot carry it.



*My general point of view. First proposition*: Man as a species is *not* progressing. Higher specimens are indeed attained; but they do not survive. The general level of the species is not raised.

*Second proposition*: Man as a species does not represent any sort of progress compared with any other animal. The whole of the animal and plant world does not develop from the lower to the higher.... but all simultaneously, haphazardly, confusedly, and at variance. The richest and most complex forms—and the term "higher type" means no more than this—perish more easily: only the lowest succeed in maintaining their apparent imperishableness. The former are seldom attained, and maintain their superior position with difficulty, the latter are compensated by great fruitfulness.—In the human race, also, the *superior specimens,* the happy cases of evolution, are the first to perish amid the fluctuations of chances for and against them. They are exposed to every form of decadence: they are extreme, and, on that account alone, already decadents.... The short duration of beauty, of genius, of the Cæsar, is *sui generis:* such things are not hereditary. The *type* is inherited, there is nothing extreme or particularly "happy" about a type——It is not a case of a particular fate, or of the "evil will" of Nature, but merely of the concept "superior type": the higher type is an example of an incomparably greater degree of complexity a greater sum of co-ordinated elements: but on this account disintegration becomes a thousand times more threatening. "Genius" is the sublimest machine in existence—hence it is the most fragile.

*Third propositio:*: The domestication \(culture\) of man does not sink very deep. When it does sink far below the skin it immediately becomes degeneration \(type: the Christian\). The wild man \(or, in moral terminology, the *evil* man\) is a reversion to Nature—and, in a certain sense, he represents a recovery, a *cure* from the effects of "culture." ...



685.

*Anti-Darwin.*—What surprises me most on making a general survey of the great destinies of man, is that I invariably see the reverse of what to-day Darwin and his school sees or *will* persist in seeing: selection in favour of the stronger, the better-constituted, and the progress of the species. Precisely the reverse of this stares one in the face: the suppression of the lucky cases, the uselessness of the more highly constituted types, the inevitable mastery of the mediocre, and even of those who are *below mediocrity.* Unless we are shown some reason why man is an exception among living creatures, I incline to the belief that Darwin's school is everywhere at fault. That will to power, in which I perceive the ultimate reason and character of all change, explains why it is that selection is never in favour of the exceptions and of the lucky cases: the strongest and happiest natures are weak when they are confronted with a majority ruled by organised gregarious instincts and the fear which possesses the weak. My general view of the world of values shows that in the highest values which now sway the destiny of man, the happy cases among men, the select specimens do not prevail: but rather the decadent specimens,—perhaps there is nothing more interesting in the world than this *unpleasant* spectacle....

Strange as it may seem, the strong always have to be upheld against the weak; and the well-constituted against the ill-constituted, the healthy against the sick and physiologically botched. If we drew our morals from reality, they would read thus: the mediocre are more valuable than the exceptional creatures, and the decadent than the mediocre; the will to nonentity prevails over the will to life—and the general aim now is, in Christian, Buddhistic, Schopenhauerian phraseology: "It is better not to be than to be."

I *protest* against this formulating of reality into a moral: and I loathe Christianity with a deadly loathing, because it created sublime words and attitudes in order to deck a revolting truth with all the tawdriness of justice, virtue, and godliness....

I see all philosophers and the whole of science on their knees before a reality which is the reverse of "the struggle for life," as Darwin and his school understood it—that is to say, wherever I look, I see those prevailing and surviving, who throw doubt and suspicion upon life and the value of life.—The error of the Darwinian school became a problem to me: how can one be so blind as to make *this* mistake?



That *species* show an ascending tendency, is the most nonsensical assertion that has ever been made: until now they have only manifested a dead level. There is nothing whatever to prove that the higher organisms have developed from the lower. I see that the lower, owing to their numerical strength, their craft, and ruse, now preponderate,—and I fail to see an instance in which an accidental change produces an advantage, at least not for a very long period: for it would be necessary to find some reason why an accidental change should become so very strong.

I do indeed find the "cruelty of Nature" which is so often referred to; but in a different place: Nature is cruel, but against her lucky and well-constituted children; she protects and shelters and loves the lowly.

In short, the increase of a species' power, as the result of the preponderance of its particularly well-constituted and strong specimens, is perhaps less of a certainty than that it is the result of the preponderance of its mediocre and lower specimens ... in the case of the latter, we find great fruitfulness and permanence: in the case of the former, the besetting dangers are greater, waste is more rapid, and decimation is more speedy.



686.

Man as he has appeared up to the present is the embryo of the man of the future; *all* the formative powers which are to produce the latter, already lie in the former: and owing to the fact that they are enormous, the more *promising for the future* the modern individual happens to be, the more *suffering* falls to his lot. This is the profoundest concept of *suffering.* The formative powers clash.—The isolation of the individual need not deceive one—as a matter of fact, some uninterrupted current does actually flow through all individuals, and does thus unite them. The fact that they feel themselves isolated, is the *most powerful spur* in the process of setting themselves the loftiest of aims: their search for happiness is the means which keeps together and moderates the formative powers, and keeps them from being mutually destructive.



687.

*Excessive intellectual* strength sets *itself* new goals; it is not in the least satisfied by the command and the leadership of the inferior world, or by the preservation of the organism, of the "individual."

We are *more* than the individual: we are the whole chain itself, with the tasks of all the possible futures of that chain in us.

3. Theory of the Will to Power and of Valuations.



688.

*The unitary view of psychology.*—We are accustomed to regard the development of a vast number of forms as compatible with one single origin.

My theory would be: that the will to power is the primitive motive force out of which all other motives have been derived;

That it is exceedingly illuminating to substitute *power* for individual "happiness" \(after which every living organism is said to strive\): "It strives after power, after *more* power";—happiness is only a symptom of the feeling of power attained, a consciousness of difference \(it does not strive after happiness: but happiness steps in when the object is attained, after which the organism has striven: happiness is an accompanying, not an actuating factor\);

That all motive force is the will to power; that there is no other force, either physical, dynamic, or psychic.

In our science, where the concept cause and effect is reduced to a relationship of complete equilibrium, and in which it seems desirable for the *same* quantum of force to be found on either side, *all idea of a motive power is absent*: we only apprehend results, and we call these equal from the point of view of their content of force....

It is a matter of mere experience that change never ceases: at bottom we have not the smallest grounds for assuming that any one particular change must follow upon any other. On the contrary, any state which has been attained would seem almost forced to maintain itself intact if it had not within itself a capacity for not desiring to maintain itself.... Spinoza's proposition concerning "self-preservation" ought as a matter of fact to put a stop to change. But the proposition is false; the contrary is true. In all living organisms it can be clearly shown that they do everything not to remain as they are, but to become greater....



689.

*"Will to power" and causality.*—From a psychological point of view the idea of "cause" is our feeling of power in the act which is called willing—our concept effect is the superstition that this feeling of power is itself the force which moves things....

A state which accompanies an event and is already an effect of that event is deemed "sufficient cause" of the latter; the tense relationship of our feeling of power \(pleasure as the feeling of power\) and of an obstacle being overcome—are these things illusions?

If we translate the notion "cause" back into the only sphere which is known to us, and out of which we have taken it, we cannot imagine *any change* in which the will to power is not inherent. We do not know how to account for any change which is not a *trespassing* of one power on another.

Mechanics only show us the results, and then only in images \(movement is a figure of speech\); gravitation itself has no mechanical cause, because it is itself the first cause of mechanical results.

The will to *accumulate force* is confined to the phenomenon of life, to nourishment, to procreation, to inheritance, to society, states, customs, authority. Should we not be allowed to assume that this will is the motive power also of chemistry?—and of the cosmic order?

Not only conservation of energy, but the minimum amount of waste; so that the only reality is this: *the will of every centre of power to become stronger*—not self-preservation, but the desire to appropriate, to become master, to become more, to become stronger.

Is the fact that science is possible a proof of the principle of causation—"From like causes, like effects"—"A permanent law of things"—"Invariable order"? Because something is calculable, is it therefore on that account necessary?

If something happens thus, and thus only, it is not the manifestation of a "principle," of a "law," of "order." What happens is that certain quanta of power begin to operate, and their essence is to exercise their power over all other quanta of power. Can we assume the existence of a striving after power without a feeling of pleasure and pain, *i.e.* without the sensation of an increase or a decrease of power? Is mechanism only a language of signs for the concealed fact of a world of fighting and conquering quanta of will-power? All mechanical first-principles, matter, atoms, weight, pressure, and repulsion, are not facts in themselves, but interpretations arrived at with the help of psychical fictions.

Life, which is our best known form of being, is altogether "will to the accumulation of strength"—all the processes of life hinge on this: everything aims, not at preservation, but at accretion and accumulation. Life as an individual case \(a hypothesis which may be applied to existence in general\) strives after the maximum feeling of power; life is essentially a striving after more power; striving itself is only a straining after more power; the most fundamental and innermost thing of all is this will. \(Mechanism is merely the semeiotics of the results.\)



690.

The thing which is the cause of the existence of development cannot in the course of investigation be found above development; it should neither be regarded as "evolving" nor as evolved ... the "will to power" cannot have been evolved.



691.

What is the relation of the whole of the organic process towards the rest of nature?—Here the fundamental will reveals itself.



692.

Is the "will to power" a kind of will, or is it identical with the concept will? Is it equivalent to desiring or commanding; is it the will which Schopenhauer says is the essence of things?

My proposition is that the will of psychologists hitherto has been an unjustifiable generalisation, and that there is no such thing as this sort of will, that instead of the development of one will into several forms being taken as a fact, the character of will has been cancelled owing to the fact that its content, its "whither," was subtracted from it: in Schopenhauer this is so in the highest degree; what he calls "will" is merely an empty word. There is even less plausibility in the will to live: for life is simply one of the manifestations of the will to power; it is quite arbitrary and ridiculous to suggest that everything is striving to enter into this particular form of the will to power.



693.

If the innermost essence of existence is the will to power; if happiness is every increase of power, and unhappiness the feeling of not being able to resist, of not being able to become master: may we not then postulate happiness and pain as cardinal facts? Is will possible without these two oscillations of yea and nay? But who feels happiness? ... Who will have power? ... Nonsensical question\! If the essence of all things is itself will to power, and consequently the ability to feel pleasure and pain\! Albeit: contrasts and obstacles are necessary, therefore also, relatively, units which trespass on one another.



694.

According to the obstacles which a force seeks with a view of overcoming them, the measure of the failure and the fatality thus provoked must increase, and in so far as every force can only manifest itself against some thing that opposes it, an element of unhappiness is necessarily inherent in every action. But this pain acts as a greater incitement to life, and increases the will to power.



695.

If pleasure and pain are related to the feeling of power, life would have to represent such an increase in power that the difference, the "plus," would have to enter consciousness. A dead level of power, if maintained, would have to measure its happiness in relation to depreciations of that level, *i.e.* in relation to states of unhappiness and not of happiness.... The will to an increase lies in the essence of happiness: that power is enhanced, and that this difference becomes conscious.

In a state of decadence after a certain time the opposite difference becomes conscious, that is decrease: the memory of former strong moments depresses the present feelings of happiness in this state comparison reduces happiness.



696.

It is not the satisfaction of the will which is the cause of happiness \(to this superficial theory I am more particularly opposed—this absurd psychological forgery in regard to the most simple things\), but it is that the will is always striving to overcome that which stands in its way. The feeling of happiness lies precisely in the discontentedness of the will, in the fact that without opponents and obstacles it is never satisfied. "The happy man": a gregarious ideal.



697.

The normal discontent of our instincts—for instance, of the instinct of hunger, of sex, of movement—contains nothing which is in itself depressing; it rather provokes the feeling of life, and, whatever the pessimists may say to us, like all the rhythms of small and irritating stimuli, it strengthens. Instead of this discontent making us sick of life, it is rather the great stimulus to life.

\(Pleasure might even perhaps be characterised as the rhythm of small and painful stimuli.\)



698.

Kant says: "These lines of Count Verri's \(*Sull' indole del piacere e del dolore;* 1781\) I confirm with absolute certainty: 'Il solo principio motore dell' uomo è il dolore. Il dolore precede ogni piacere. Il piacere non è un essere positivo.'"\[5\]




\[5\] *On the Nature of Pleasure and Pain.* "The only motive force of man is pain. Pain precedes every pleasure. Pleasure is not a positive thing."—Tr.




699.

Pain is something different from pleasure—I mean it is not the latter's opposite.

If the essence of pleasure has been aptly characterised as the feeling of increased power \(that is to say, as a feeling of difference which presupposes comparison\), that does not define the nature of pain. The false contrasts which the people, and consequently the language, believes in, are always dangerous fetters which impede the march of truth. There are even cases where a kind of pleasure is conditioned by a certain rhythmic sequence of small, painful stimuli: in this way a very rapid growth of the feeling of power and of the feeling of pleasure is attained. This is the case, for instance, in tickling, also in the sexual tickling which accompanies the coitus: here we see pain acting as the ingredient of happiness. It seems to be a small hindrance which is overcome, followed immediately by another small hindrance which once again is overcome—this play of resistance and resistance overcome is the greatest excitant of that complete feeling of overflowing and surplus power which constitutes the essence of happiness.

The converse, which would be an increase in the feeling of pain through small intercalated pleasurable stimuli, does not exist: pleasure and pain are not opposites.

Pain is undoubtedly an intellectual process in which a judgment is inherent—the judgment harmful, in which long experience is epitomised. There is no such thing as pain in itself. It is not the wound that hurts, it is the experience of the harmful results a wound may have for the whole organism, which here speaks in this deeply moving way, and is called pain. \(In the case of deleterious influences which were unknown to ancient man, as, for instance, those residing in the new combination of poisonous chemicals, the hint from pain is lacking, and we are lost.\)

That which is quite peculiar in pain is the prolonged disturbance, the quivering subsequent to a terrible shock in the ganglia of the nervous system. As a matter of fact, nobody suffers from the cause of pain \(from any sort of injury, for instance\), but from the protracted disturbance of his equilibrium which follows upon the shock. Pain is a disease of the cerebral centres—pleasure is no disease at all.

The fact that pain may be the cause of reflex actions has appearances and even philosophical prejudice in its favour. But in very sudden accidents, if we observe closely, we find that the reflex action occurs appreciably earlier than the feeling of pain. I should be in a bad way when I stumbled if I had to wait until the fact had struck the bell of my consciousness, and until a hint of what I had to do had been telegraphed back to me. On the contrary, what I notice as clearly as possible is, that first, in order to avoid a fall, reflex action on the part of my foot takes place, and then, after a certain measurable space of time, there follows quite suddenly a kind of painful wave in my forehead. Nobody, then, reacts to pain. Pain is subsequently projected into the wounded quarter—but the essence of this local pain is nevertheless not the expression of a kind of local wound, it is merely a local sign, the strength and nature of which is in keeping with the severity of the wound, and of which the nerve centres have taken note. The fact that as the result of this shock the muscular power of the organism is materially reduced, does not prove in any way that the essence of pain is to be sought in the lowering of the feeling of power.

Once more let me repeat: nobody reacts to pain: pain is no "cause" of action. Pain itself is a reaction; the reflex movement is another and earlier process—both originate at different points....





700.

The message of pain: in itself pain does not announce that which has been momentarily damaged, but the significance of this damage for the individual as a whole.

Are we to suppose that there are any pains which "the species" feel, and which the individual does not?



701.

"The sum of unhappiness outweighs the sum of happiness: consequently it were better that the world did not exist"—"The world is something which from a rational standpoint it were better did not exist, because it occasions more pain than pleasure to the feeling subject"—this futile gossip now calls itself pessimism\!

Pleasure and pain are accompanying factors, not causes; they are second-rate valuations derived from a dominating value,—they are one with the feeling "useful," "harmful," and therefore they are absolutely fugitive and relative. For in regard to all utility and harmfulness there are a hundred different ways of asking "what for?"

I despise this pessimism of sensitiveness: it is in itself a sign of profoundly impoverished life.



702.

Man does not seek happiness and does not avoid unhappiness. Everybody knows the famous prejudices I here contradict. Pleasure and pain are mere results, mere accompanying phenomena—that which every man, which every tiny particle of a living organism will have, is an increase of power. In striving after this, pleasure and pain are encountered; it is owing to that will that the organism seeks opposition and requires that which stands in its way.... Pain as the hindrance of its will to power is therefore a normal feature, a natural ingredient of every organic phenomenon; man does not avoid it, on the contrary, he is constantly in need of it: every triumph, every feeling of pleasure, every event presupposes an obstacle overcome.

Let us take the simplest case, that of primitive nourishment; the protoplasm extends its pseudopodia in order to seek for that which resists it,—it does not do so out of hunger, but owing to its will to power. Then it makes the attempt to overcome, to appropriate, and to incorporate that with which it comes into contact—what people call "nourishment" is merely a derivative, a utilitarian application, of the primordial will to become stronger.

Pain is so far from acting as a diminution of our feeling of power, that it actually forms in the majority of cases a spur to this feeling,—the obstacle is the stimulus of the will to power.



703.

Pain has been confounded with one of its subdivisions, which is exhaustion: the latter does indeed represent a profound reduction and lowering of the will to power, a material loss of strength—that is to say, there is *\(a\)* pain as the stimulus to an increase or power, and *\(b\)* pain following upon an expenditure of power; in the first case it is a spur, in the second it is the outcome of excessive spurring.... The inability to resist is proper to the latter form of pain: the provocation of that which resists is proper to the former.... The only happiness which is to be felt in the state of exhaustion is that of going to sleep; in the other case, happiness means triumph.... The great confusion of psychologists consisted in the fact that they did not keep these two kinds of happiness—that of falling asleep, and that of triumph—sufficiently apart. Exhausted people will have repose, slackened limbs, peace and quiet—and these things constitute the bliss of Nihilistic religions and philosophies, the wealthy in vital strength, the active, want triumph, defeated opponents, and the extension of their feeling of power over ever wider regions. Every healthy function of the organism has this need,—and the whole organism constitutes an intricate complexity of systems struggling for the increase of the feeling of power....



704.

How is it that the fundamental article of faith in all psychologies is a piece of most outrageous contortion and fabrication? "Man strives after happiness," for instance—how much of this is true? In order to understand what life is, and what kind of striving and tenseness life contains, the formula should hold good not only of trees and plants, but of animals also. "What does the plant strive after?"—But here we have already invented a false entity which does not exist,—concealing and denying the fact of an infinitely variegated growth, with individual and semi-individual starting-points, if we give it the clumsy title "plant" as if it were a unit. It is very obvious that the ultimate and smallest "individuals" cannot be understood in the sense of metaphysical individuals or atoms; their sphere of power is continually shifting its ground: but with all these changes, can it be said that any of them strives after happiness?—All this expanding, this incorporation and growth, is a search for resistance; movement is essentially related to states of pain: the driving power here must represent some other desire if it leads to such continual willing and seeking of pain.—To what end do the trees of a virgin forest contend with each other? "For happiness"?—For power\! ...

Man is now master of the forces of nature, and master too of his own wild and unbridled feelings \(the passions have followed suit, and have learned to become useful\)—in comparison with primeval man, the man of to-day represents an enormous quantum of power, but not an increase in happiness\! How can one maintain, then, that he has striven after happiness?..



705.

But while I say this I see above me, and below the stars, the glittering rat's-tail of errors which hitherto has represented the greatest inspiration of man: "All happiness is the result of virtue all virtue is the result of free will"\!



Let us transvalue the values: all capacity is the outcome of a happy organisation, all freedom is the outcome of capacity \(freedom understood here as facility in self-direction. Every artist will understand me\).



706.

"The value of life."—Every life stands by itself; all existence must be justified, and not only life,—the justifying principle must be one through which life itself speaks.

Life is only a means to something: it is the expression of the forms of growth in power.



707.

The "conscious world" cannot be a starting-point for valuing: an "objective" valuation is necessary.

In comparison with the enormous and complicated antagonistic processes which the collective life of every organism represents, its conscious world of feelings, intentions, and valuations, is only a small slice. We have absolutely no right to postulate this particle of consciousness as the object, the wherefore, of the collective phenomena of life: the attainment of consciousness is obviously only an additional means to the unfolding of life and to the extension of its power. That is why it is a piece of childish simplicity to set up happiness, or intellectuality, or morality, or any other individual sphere of consciousness, as the highest value: and maybe to justify "the world" with it.



This is my fundamental objection to all philosophical and moral cosmologies and theologies, to all wherefores and highest values that have appeared in philosophies and philosophic religions hitherto. A kind of means is misunderstood as the object itself: conversely life and its growth of power were debased to a means.

If we wished to postulate an adequate object of life it would not necessarily be related in any way with the category of conscious life; it would require rather to explain conscious life as a mere means to itself....

The "denial of life" regarded as the object of life, the object of evolution\! Existence—a piece of tremendous stupidity\! Any such mad interpretation is only the outcome of life's being measured by the factors of consciousness \(pleasure and pain, good and evil\). Here the means are made to stand against the end—the "unholy," absurd, and, above all, disagreeable means: how can the end be any use when it requires such means? But where the fault lies is here—instead of looking for the end which would explain the necessity of such means, we posited an end from the start which actually excludes such means, *i.e.* we made a desideratum in regard to certain means \(especially pleasurable, rational, and virtuous\) into a rule, and then only did we decide what end would be desirable....

Where the fundamental fault lies is in the fact that, instead of regarding consciousness as an instrument and an isolated phenomenon of life in general, we made it a standard, the highest value in life: it is the faulty standpoint of *a parte ad totum,*—and that is why all philosophers are instinctively seeking at the present day for a collective consciousness, a thing that lives and wills consciously with all that happens, a "Spirit," a "God." But they must be told that it is precisely thus that life is converted into a monster; that a "God" and a general sensorium would necessarily be something on whose account the whole of existence would have to be condemned.... Our greatest relief came when we eliminated the general consciousness which postulates ends and means—in this way we ceased from being necessarily pessimists.... Our greatest indictment of life was the existence of God.



708.

*Concerning the value of "Becoming."*—If the movement of the world really tended to reach a final state, that state would already have been reached. The only fundamental fact, however, is that it does not tend to reach a final state: and every philosophy and scientific hypothesis \(*e.g.* materialism\) according to which such a final state is necessary, is refuted by this fundamental fact.

I should like to have a concept of the world which does justice to this fact. Becoming ought to be explained without having recourse to such final designs. Booming must appear justified at every instant \(or it must defy all valuation: which has unity as its end\); the present must not under any circumstances be justified by a future, nor must the past be justified for the sake of the present. "Necessity" must not be interpreted in the form of a prevailing and ruling collective force or as a prime motor; and still less as the necessary cause of some valuable result. But to this end it is necessary to deny a collective consciousness for Becoming,—a "God," in order that life may not be veiled under the shadow of a being who feels and knows as we do and yet *wills* nothing: "God" is useless if he wants nothing; and if he do want something, this presupposes a general sum of suffering and irrationality which lowers the general value of Becoming. Fortunately any such general power is lacking \(a suffering God overlooking everything, a general sensorium and ubiquitous Spirit, would be the greatest indictment of existence\).

Strictly speaking nothing of the nature of Being must be allowed to remain,—because in that case Becoming loses its value and gets to be sheer and superfluous nonsense.

The next question, then, is: how did the illusion Being originate \(why was it obliged to originate\);

Likewise: how was it that all valuations based upon the hypothesis that there was such a thing as Being came to be depreciated.

But in this way we have recognised that this hypothesis concerning Being is the source of all the calumny that has been directed against the world \(the "Better world," the "True world" the "World Beyond," the "Thing-in-itself"\).

\(1\) Becoming has no final state, it does not tend towards stability.



\(2\) Becoming is not a state of appearance, the world of Being is probably only appearance.

\(3\) Becoming is of precisely the same value at every instant; the sum of its value always remains equal: expressed otherwise, it has no value; for that according to which it might be measured, and in regard to which the word value might have some sense, is entirely lacking. The collective value of the world defies valuation; for this reason philosophical pessimism belongs to the order of farces.



709.

We should not make our little desiderata the judges of existence\! Neither should we make culminating evolutionary forms \(*e.g.* mind\) the "absolute" which stands behind evolution\!



710.

Our knowledge has become scientific to the extent in which it has been able to make use of number and measure. It might be worth while to try and see whether a scientific order of values might not be constructed according to a scale of numbers and measures representing energy.... All other values are matters of prejudice, simplicity, and misunderstanding. They may all be reduced to that scale of numbers and measures representing energy. The ascent in this scale would represent an increase of value, the descent a diminution.

But here appearance and prejudice are against one \(moral values are only apparent values compared with those which are physiological\).



711.

Why the standpoint of "value" lapses:—

Because in the *"whole process of the universe" the work of mankind does not come under consideration*; because a general process \(viewed in the light of a system\) does not exist.

Because there is no such thing as a whole; because no *depreciation of human* existence or human aims can be made in regard to something that does not exist.

Because "necessity," "causality," "design," are merely useful "*semblances.*"

Because the aim is *not* "the increase of the sphere of consciousness," *but the increase of power*; in which increase the utility of consciousness is also contained; and the same holds good of pleasure and pain.

Because a mere *means* must not be elevated to the highest criterion of value \(such as states of consciousness like pleasure and pain, if consciousness is in itself only a means\).

Because the world is not an organism at all, but a thing of chaos; because the development of "intellectuality" is only a means tending relatively to extend the duration of an organisation.

Because all "desirability" has no sense in regard to the general character of existence.





712.

"God" is the culminating moment: life is an eternal process of deifying and undeifying. *But withal there is no zenith of values,* but only a zenith of *power.*

Absolute *exclusion of mechanical and materialistic interpretations.* they are both only expressions of inferior states, of emotions deprived of all spirit \(of the "will to power"\).

*The retrograde movement front the zenith* of development \(the intellectualisation of power on some slave-infected soil\) may be shown to be the *result* of the highest degree of energy *turning against* itself, once it no longer has anything to organise, and utilising its power in order to *disorganise.*

*\(a\)* The ever-increasing *suppression* of societies, and the latter's subjection by a smaller number of stronger individuals.

\(b\) The ever-increasing suppression of the privileged and the strong, hence the rise of democracy, and ultimately of *anarchy,* in the elements.



713.

*Value* is the highest amount of power that a man can assimilate—a man, not mankind\! Mankind is much more of a means than an end. It is a question of type: mankind is merely the experimental material; it is the overflow of the ill-constituted—a field of ruins.





714.

Words relating to values are merely banners planted on those spots where a *new blessedness* was discovered—a new *feeling.*



715.

The standpoint of "value" is the same as that of the *conditions* of *preservation* and *enhancement,* in regard to complex creatures of relative stability appearing in the course of evolution.

There are no such things as lasting and ultimate entities, no atoms, no monads: here also "permanence" was first introduced by ourselves \(from practical, utilitarian, and other motives\).

"The forms that rule"; the sphere of the subjugated is continually extended; or it decreases or increases according to the conditions \(nourishment\) being either favourable or unfavourable.

"Value" is essentially the standpoint for the increase or decrease of these dominating centres \(pluralities in any case; for "unity" cannot be observed anywhere in the nature of development\).

The means of expression afforded by language are useless for the purpose of conveying any facts concerning "development": the need of positing a rougher world of stable existences and things forms part of our *eternal desire for preservation.* We may speak of atoms and monads in a relative sense: and this is certain, *that the smallest world is the most stable world ...*. There is no such thing as will: there are only punctuations of will, which are constantly increasing and decreasing their power.
