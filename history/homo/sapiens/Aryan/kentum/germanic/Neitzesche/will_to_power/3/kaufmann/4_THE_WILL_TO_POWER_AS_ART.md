IV. THE WILL TO POWER AS ART

794 (March-June 1888)

Our religion, morality, and philosophy are decadence forms of man.

The countermovement: art.

795 (1885-1886) 124

The artist-philosopher. Higher concept of art. Whether a man can place himself so far distant from other men that he can form them? (Preliminary exercises: (1) he who forms himself, the hermit; (2) the artist hitherto, as a perfecter on a small scale, working on material.)

796 (1885-1886)

The work of art where it appears without an artist, e.g., as body, as organization (Prussian officer corps, Jesuit order). To what extent the artist is only a preliminary stage.

The world as a work of art that gives birth to itself

797 (1885-1886)

The phenomenon "artist" is still the most transparent:-to see through it to the basic instincts of power, nature, etc.! Also those of religion and morality!

"Play," the useless as the ideal of him who is overfull of strength, as "childlike." The "childlikeness" of God, pais paizon.125

THE WILL TO POWER which art appears in man like a force of nature and disposes of him whether he will or no: as the compulsion to have visions and as a compulsion to an orgiastic state. Both conditions are rehearsed in ordinary life, too, but weaker: in dream and in intoxication.

But the same antithesis obtains between dream and intoxica tion: both release artistic powers in us, but different ones: the dream those of vision, association, poetry; intoxication those of gesture, passion, song, dance.

799 (March-June 1888)

In the Dionysian intoxication there is sexuality and volup tuousness: they are not lacking in the Apollinian. There must also be a difference in tempo in the two conditions-- The extreme calm in certain sensations of intoxication (more strictly: the retardation of the feelings of time and space) likes to be reflected in a vision of the calmest gestures and types of soul. The classical style is essentially a representation of this calm, simplification, abbreviation, concentration the highest feeling of power is con centrated in the classical type. To react slowly; a great con sciousness; no feeling of struggle.

800 (March-June 1888)

The feeling of intoxication, in fact corresponding to an in crease in strength; strongest in the mating season: new orgáns, new accomplishments, colors, forms; "becoming more beautiful" is a consequence of enhanced strength.127 Becoming more beautiful as the expression of a victorious will, of increased co-ordination, of a harmonizing of all the strong desires, of an infallibly per pendicular stress, Logical and geometrical simplification is a consequence of enhancement of strength; conversely the apprehen sion of such a simplification again enhances the feeling of strength-High point of the development: the grand style.

Ugliness signifies the decadence of a type, contradiction and lack of co-ordination among the inner desires_signifies a decline in organizing strength, in "will," to speak psychologically.

The condition of pleasure called intoxication is precisely an

exalted feeling of power— The sensations of space and time are altered: tremendous distances are surveyed and, as it were, for the first time apprehended; the extension of vision over greater masses and expanses; the refinement of the organs for the apprehension of much that is extremely small and fleeting; divination, the power of understanding with only the least assistance, at the slightest suggestion; "intelligent" sensuality strength as a feeling of dominion in the muscles, as suppleness and pleasure in movement, as dance, as levity and presto, strength as pleasure in the proof of strength, as bravado, adventure, fearlessness, indifference to life or death— All these climactic moments of life mutually stimulate one another; the world of images and ideas of the one suffices as a suggestion for the others: in this way, states finally merge into one another though they might perhaps have good reason to remain apart. For example: the feeling of religious intoxication and sexual excitation (two profound feelings, co-ordinated to an almost amazing degree. What pleases all pious women, old or young? Answer: a saint with beautiful legs, still young, still an idiot). Cruelty in tragedy and sympathy ( also normally co ordinated-) Spring, dance, music all competitions between the sexes-and even that Faustian "infinity in the breast."

Artists, if they are any good, are (physically as well) strong, full of surplus energy, powerful animals, sensual; without a certain overheating of the sexual system a Raphael is unthinkable Making music is another way of making children; chastity is merely the economy of an artist and in any event, even with artists fruitfulness ceases when potency ceases Artists should see nothing as it is, but fuller, simpler, stronger: to that end, their lives must contain a kind of youth and spring, a kind of habitual intoxication.

801 (Spring-Fall 1887; rev. Spring-Fall 1888)

The states in which we infuse a transfiguration and fullness into things and poetize about them until they reflect back our fullness and joy in life: sexuality; intoxication; feasting; spring; victory over an enemy, mockery; bravado; cruelty; the ecstacy of religious feeling. Three elements principally: sexuality, intoxica tion, cruelty-all belonging to the oldest festal joys of mankind, all also preponderate in the early "artist."

Conversely, when we encounter things that display this trans

422

THE WILL TO POWER

figuration and fullness, the animal responds with an excitation of those spheres in which all those pleasurable states are situated and a blending of these very delicate nuances of animal well being and desires constitutes the aesthetic state. The latter appears only in natures capable of that bestowing and overflowing fullness of bodily vigor; it is this that is always the primum mobile. The sober, the weary, the exhausted, the dried-up (e.g., scholars) can receive absolutely nothing from art, because they do not possess the primary artistic force, the pressure of abundance: whoever can not give, also receives nothing.

"Perfection": in these states in the case of sexual love especially) there is naively revealed what the deepest instinct recognizes as higher, more desirable, more valuable in gen eral, the upward movement of its type; also toward what status it really aspires. Perfection; that is the extraordinary expansion of its feeling of power, riches, necessary overflowing of all limits.

802 (Spring-Fall 1887)

Art reminds us of states of animal vigor; it is on the one hand an excess and overflow of blooming physicality into the world of images and desires; on the other, an excitation of the animal functions through the images and desires of intensified life;

an enhancement of the feeling of life, a stimulant to it.

How can even ugliness possess this power? In so far as it still communicates something of the artist's victorious energy which has become master of this ugliness and awfulness; or in so far as it mildly excites in us the pleasure of cruelty (under certain con Jitions even a desire to harm ourselves, self-violation--and thus the feeling of power over ourselves).

803 (1883-1888)

"Beauty" is for the artist something outside all orders of rank, because in beauty opposites are tamed; the highest sign of power, namely power over opposites, moreover, without tension; --that violence is no longer needed; that everything follows, obeys, so easily and so pleasantly--that is what delights the artist's will to power.

804 (Spring-Fall 1887)

Origin of the beautiful and ugly. 128_Biological value of the beautiful and the ugly.-- That which is instinctively repugnant to us, aesthetically, is proved by mankind's longest experience to be harmful, dangerous, worthy of suspicion: the suddenly vocal aesthetic instinct (e.g., in disgust) contains a judgment. To this extent the beautiful stands within the general category of the biological values of what is useful, beneficent, life-enhancing-but in such a way that a host of stimuli that are only distantly associated with, and remind us only faintly of, useful things and states give us the feeling of the beautiful, i.e., of the increase of the feeling of power (not merely things, therefore, but also the sensations that accompany such things, or symbols of them).

Thus the beautiful and the ugly are recognized as relative to our most fundamental values of preservation. It is senseless to want to posit anything as beautiful or ugly apart from this. The beautiful exists just as little as does the good, or the true. In every case it is a question of the conditions of preservation of a certain type of man: thus the herd man will experience the value feeling of the beautiful in the presence of different things than will the exceptional or over-man.

It is the perspective of the foreground, which concerns itself only with immediate consequences, from which the value of the beautiful (also of the good, also of the true) arises.

All instinctive judgments are shortsighted in regard to the chain of consequences: they advise what is to be done immediately. The understanding is essentially a brake upon immediate reactions on the basis of instinctive judgments: it retards, it considers, it looks further along the chain of consequences.

Judgments concerning beauty and ugliness are shortsighted (they are always opposed by the understanding.-) but per suasive in the highest degree; they appeal to our instincts where they decide most quickly and pronounce their Yes and No before the understanding can speak,

The most habitual affirmations of beauty excite and stimulate each other; once the aesthetic drive is at work, a whole host of other perfections, originating elsewhere, crystallize around "the

particular instance of beauty." It is not possible to remain objective, or to suspend the interpretive, additive, interpolating, poetizing power (-the latter is the forging of the chain of affirmations of beauty). The sight of a "beautiful woman"

Thus 1. the judgment of beauty is shortsighted, it sees only the immediate consequences;

2. it lavishes upon the object that inspires it a magic con ditioned by the association of various beauty judgments that are quite alien to the nature of that object. To experience a thing as beautiful means: to experience it necessarily wrongly—(which, incidentally, is why marriage for love is, from the point of view of society, the most unreasonable kind of marriage).

805 (1883-1888) On the genesis of art. That making perfect, seeing as per fect, which characterizes the cerebral system bursting with sexual energy (evening with the beloved, the smallest chance occurrences transfigured, life a succession of sublime things, "the misfortune of the unfortunate lover worth more than anything else"): on the other hand, everything perfect and beautiful works as an un conscious reminder of that enamored condition and its way of seeing-every perfection, all the beauty of things, revives through contiguity128a this aphrodisiac bliss. (Physiologically: the creative instinct of the artist and the distribution of semen in his blood ) The demand for art and beauty is an indirect demand for the ecstasies of sexuality communicated to the brain. The world become perfect, through "love" -

806 (1883-1888)

Sensuality in its disguises: (1) as idealism ("Plato"), peculiar to youth, creating the same kind of concave image that the beloved in particuar assumes, imposing an encrustation, magnification, transfiguration, infinity upon everything—; (2) in the religion of love: "a handsome young man, a beautiful woman," somehow divine, a bridegroom, a bride of the soul; (3) in art, as the "embellishing" power: as man sees woman and, as it were, makes her a present of everything excellent, so the sensuality of the artist puts into one object everything else that he honors and

1234 Nietzsche uses the English term, as in Genealogy III, section 4.

esteems-in this way he perfects an object ("idealizes" it). Woman, conscious of man's feelings concerning women, assists his efforts at idealization by adorning herself, walking beautifully, dancing, expressing delicate thoughts: in the same way, she practices modesty, reserve, distance--realizing instinctively that in this way the idealizing capacity of the man will grow. (Given the tremendous subtlety of woman's instinct, modesty remains by no means conscious hypocrisy: she divines that it is precisely an actual naive modesty that most seduces a man and impels him to overestimate her. Therefore woman is naive from the subtlety of her instinct, which advises her of the utility of innocence. A deliberate closing of one's eyes to oneself-Wherever dissembling produces a stronger effect when it is unconscious, it becomes unconscious.)

807 (Summer-Fall 1888)

What a tremendous amount can be accomplished by that intoxication which is called "love" but which is yet something other than love! But everyone has his own knowledge of this. The muscular strength of a girl increases as soon as a man comes into her vicinity; there are instruments to measure this. When the sexes are in yet closer contact, as, e.g., at dances and other social events, this strength is augmented to such a degree that real feats of strength are possible: in the end one scarcely believes one's own eyes or one's watch. In such cases, to be sure, we must reckon with the fact that dancing in itself, like every other swift movement, brings with it a kind of intoxication of the whole vascular, nervous, and muscular system. So one has to reckon with the combined effects of a twofold intoxication. And how wise it is at times to be a little tipsy!

. There are realities that one may never admit to oneself; after all, one is a woman; after all, one has a woman's pudeurs

Those young creatures dancing over there are obviously beyond all reality: they are dancing with nothing but palpable ideals; what is more, they even see ideals sitting around them: the mothers! Opportunity to quote Faust- They look incomparably better when they are a little tipsy like that, these pretty creatures-oh, how well they know that, too. They actually become amiable because they know it.

Finally, they are also inspired by their finery; their finery is426

THE WILL TO POWER

their third intoxication: they believe in their tailors as they believe in their God and who would dissuade them from this faith? This faith makes blessed! And self-admiration is healthy! Self admiration protects against colds. Has a pretty woman who knew herself to be well dressed ever caught cold? Never! I am even assuming that she was barely dressed. 129

808 (March-June 1888)

Do you desire the most astonishing proof of how far the transfiguring power of intoxication can go?- "Love" is this proof: that which is called love in all the languages and silences of the world. In this case, intoxication has done with reality to such a degree that in the consciousness of the lover the cause of it is extinguished and something else seems to have taken its place-a vibration and glittering of all the magic mirrors of Circe

Here it makes no difference whether one is man or animal; even less whether one has spirit, goodness, integrity. If one is subtle, one is fooled subtly; if one is coarse, one is fooled coarsely; but love, and even the love of God, the saintly love of "redeemed souls," remains the same in its roots: a fever that has good reason to transfigure itself, an intoxication that does well to lie about itself And in any case, one lies well when one loves, about oneself and to oneself: one seems to oneself transfigured, stronger, richer, more perfect, one is more perfect Here we discover art as an organic function: we discover it in the most angelic instinct, "love"; we discover it as the greatest stimulus of life.mart thus sublimely expedient even when it lies---

But we should do wrong if we stopped with its power to lie: it does more than merely imagine; it even transposes values. And it is not only that it transposes the feeling of values: the lover is more valuable, is stronger. In animals this condition produces new weapons, pigments, colors, and forms; above all, new move ments, new rhythms, new love calls and seductions. It is no different with man. His whole economy is richer than before,

427 more powerful, more complete than in those who do not love. The lover becomes a squanderer: he is rich enough for it. Now he dares, becomes an adventurer, becomes an ass in magnanimity and innocence; he believes in God again, he believes in virtue, because he believes in love; and on the other hand, this happy idiot grows wings and new capabilities, and even the door of art is opened to him. If we subtracted all traces of this intestinal fever from lyricism in sound and word, what would be left of lyrical poetry and music? - L'art pour l'art perhaps: the virtuoso croaking of shivering frogs, despairing in their swamp- All the rest was created by love.

809 (March-June 1888)

All art exercises the power of suggestion over the muscles and senses, which in the artistic temperament are originally active: it always speaks only to artists-it speaks to this kind of a subtle flexibility of the body. The concept "layman" is an error. The deaf man is not a species of the man with good hearing.

All art works tonically, increases strength, inflames desire (i.c., the feeling of strength), excites all the more subtle recollec tions of intoxication--there is a special memory that penetrates such states: a distant and transitory world of sensations here comes back.

The ugly, i.e., the contradiction to art, that which is excluded from art, its No-every time decline, impoverishment of life, impotence, disintegration, degeneration are suggested even faintly, the aesthetic man reacts with his No. The effect of the ugly is depressing; it is the expression of a depression. It takes away strength, it impoverishes, it weighs down

The ugly suggests ugly things; one can use one's states of health to test how variously an indisposition increases the capacity for imagining ugly things. The selection of things, interests, and questions changes. A state closely related to the ugly is encountered in logic, too: heaviness, dimness. Mechanically speaking, equilib rium is lacking: the ugly limps, the ugly stumbles: antithesis to the divine frivolity of the dancer.

The aesthetic state possesses a superabundance of means of communication, together with an extreme receptivity for stimuli and signs. It constitutes the high point of communication and

transmission between living creatures-it is the source of languages. This is where languages originate: the languages of tone as well as the languages of gestures and glances. The more complete phenomenon is always the beginning: our faculties are subtilized out of more complete faculties. But even today one still hears with one's muscles, one even reads with one's muscles.

Every mature art has a host of conventions as its basis-in so far as it is a language. Convention is the condition of great art, not an obstacle

Every enhancement of life enhances man's power of com munication, as well as his power of understanding. Empathy with the souls of others is originally nothing moral, but a physiological susceptibility to suggestion: "sympathy," or what is called "altru ism," is merely a product of that psychomotor rapport which is reckoned a part of spirituality (induction psycho-motrice, Charles Féré thinks). One never communicates thoughts: one communi cates movements, mimic signs, which we then trace back to thoughts.

810 (Spring-Fall 1887)

Compared with music all communication by words is shame less; words dilute and brutalize; words depersonalize; words make the uncommon common.

811 (March-June 1888)

It is exceptional states that condition the artist--all of them profoundly related to and interlaced with morbid phenomena so it seems impossible to be an artist and not to be sick.

Physiological states that are in the artist as it were molded into a "personality" and that characterize men in general to some degree:

1. intoxication: the feeling of enhanced power; the inner need to make of things a reflex of one's own fullness and perfection;

2. the extreme sharpness of certain senses, so they under stand a quite different sign language--and create one-the con dition that seems to be a part of many nervous disorders cxtreme mobility that turns into an extreme urge to communicate; the desire to speak on the part of everything that knows how to make signs--; a need to get rid of oneself, as it were, through sigas

BOOK THREE: Principles of A New Evaluation

429

and gestures; ability to speak of oneself through a hundred speech media-an explosive condition. One must first think of this con dition as a compulsion and urge to get rid of the exuberance of inner tension through muscular activity and movements of all kinds; then as an involuntary co-ordination between this move ment and the processes within (images, thoughts, desires) -as a kind of automatism of the whole muscular system impelled by strong stimuli from within-; inability to prevent reaction; the system of inhibitions suspended, as it were. Every inner move ment (feeling, thought, affect) is accompanied by vascular changes and consequently by changes in color, temperature, and secretion. The suggestive power of music, its "suggestion mentale";

3. the compulsion to imitate: an extreme irritability through which a given example becomes. contagious--a state is divined on the basis of signs and immediately enacted— An image, rising up within, immediately turns into a movement of the limbs a certain suspension of the will-(Schopenhauer!!!) A kind of deafness and blindness towards the external world--the realm of admitted stimuli is sharply defined.

This is what distinguishes the artist from laymen (those susceptible to art): the latter reach the high point of their susceptibility when they receive; the former as they give--so that an antagonism between these two gifts is not only natural but desirable. The perspectives of these two states are opposite: to demand of the artist that he should practice the perspective of the audience of the criticm) means to demand that he should impoverish himself and his creative power It is the same here as with the difference between the sexes: one ought not to demand of the artist, who gives, that he should become a woman that he should receive.

Our aesthetics hitherto has been a woman's aesthetics to the extent that only the receivers of art have formulated their ex perience of "what is beautiful?" In all philosophy hitherto the artist is lacking.

This, as the foregoing indicates, is a necessary mistake; for the artist who began to understand himself would misunder stand himself: he ought not to look back, he ought not to look at all, he ought to give.

It is to the honor of an artist if he is unable to be a critic otherwise he is half and half, he is "modern."

430

THE WILL TO POWER

812 (March-June 1888) I set down here a list of psychological states as signs of a full and flourishing life that one is accustomed today to condemn as morbid. For by now we have learned better than to speak of healthy and sick as of an antithesis: it is a question of degrees. My claim in this matter is that what is today called "healthy" represents a lower level than that which under favorable circum stances would be healthy---that we are relatively sick

The artist belongs to a still stronger race. What would be harmful and morbid in us; in him is nature But one objects to us that it is precisely the impoverishment of the machine that makes possible extravagant powers of understanding of every kind of suggestion: witness our hysterical females.

An excess of sap and force can bring with it symptoms of partial constraint, of sense hallucinations, susceptibility to sugges tion, just as well as can impoverishment of life: the stimulus is differently conditioned, the effect remains the same. But the after effect is not the same; the extreme exhaustion of all morbid natures after their nervous eccentricities has nothing in common with the states of the artist; who does not have to atone for his good periods. He is rich enough for them; hie is able to squander with out becoming poor.

As one may today consider "genius" as a form of neurosis, so perhaps also the artistic power of suggestion and indeed our artists are painfully like hysterical females!!! But that is an objec tion to "today," not to "artists."....

Inartistic states: those of objectivity, mirroring, suspended will—(Schopenhauer's scandalous misunderstanding when he took art for a bridge to the denial of life)- Inartistic states: among those who become impoverished, withdraw, grow pale, under whose eyes life suffers:--the Christian.

813 (1888)

The modern artist, in his physiology next-of-kin to the hys teric, is also distinguished by this morbidity as a character. The hysteric is false--he lies from love of lying, he is admirable in every art of dissimulation unless his morbid vanity plays a trick

BOOK THREE: Principles of A New Evaluation

431

on him. This vanity is like a continual fever that requires nar cotics and does not shrink from any self-deception, any farce, that promises momentary relief. (Incapacity for pride and the continual need for revenge for a deeply ingrained self-contempt--this is almost the definition of this kind of vanity.).

The absurd irritability of his system, which turns all expe riences into crises and introduces the "dramatic" into the smallest accidents of life, robs him of all calculability: he is no longer a person, at most a rendezvous of persons and now this one, now that one shoots forward with shameless assurance. Precisely for this reason, he is great as an actor: all these poor will-less people whom doctors study so closely astonish one with their virtuosity in mimicry, transfiguration, assumption of almost any desired character.

814 (Spring-Fall 1887; rev. Spring-Fall 1888)

Artists are not men of great passion, whatever they may like to tell us and themselves. And this for two reasons: they lack any sense of shame before themselves (they observe themselves while they live; they spy on themselves, they are too inquisitive) and they also lack any sense of shame before great passion (they exploit it as artists). Secondly, however, their vampire, their talent, grudges them as a rule that squandering of force which one calls passion. If one has a talent, one is also its victim: one lives under the vampirism of one's talent.

One does not get over a passion by representing it: rather, it is over when one is able to represent it. (Goethe teaches other wise; but here it seems that he wanted to misunderstand himself from delicatezza. 180)

815 (Summer-Fall 1888) The rationale of life. A relative chastity, a prudent caution on principle regarding erotic matters, even in thought, can belong to the grand rationale of life even in richly endowed and complete natures. This principle applies especially to artists, it is part of their best wisdom of life. Completely non-suspect voices have lent sup

*** Delicacy of feeling, tact-consideration for the women who had inspired him.

432

THE WILL TO POWER port to this opinion: I name Stendhal and Th. Gautier, also Flaubert. The artist is perhaps necessarily a sensual man, generally excitable, susceptible in every sense to stimuli, meeting the very suggestion of a stimulus halfway even from afar. This notwith standing, he is on the average, under the pressure of his task, of his will to mastery, actually moderate, often even chaste. His dominant instinct demands this of him: it does not permit him to expend himself in any casual way. The force that one expends in artistic conception is the same as that expended in the sexual act: there is only one kind of force. An artist betrays himself if he succumbs here, if he squanders himself here: it betrays a lack of instinct, of will in general; it can be a sign of decadence in any case, it devalues his art to an incalculable degree 131

Their habitual manner, their unreasonableness, their ignorance about themselves, their indifference to "eternal values," their seriousness in "play" their lack of dignity; buffoon and god side by side; saint and canaille- Imitation as an instinct, commanding.- Artists of ascending life-artists of declining life: do they not belong to all phases? — Yes!132

817 (Spring-Fall 1887; rev. Spring-Fall 1888)

Would any link at all be missing in the chain of art and science if woman, if the works of women were missing?

métier---precisely because in these things she perfects herself, be cause she here obeys the only artistic impulse she has-she wants to please

But what has woman to do with the passionate indifference of the true artist, who assigns more importance to a sound, a breath, a heyday!183 than to himself? who strains with every finger to reach his innermost secrets? who accords no value to anything that cannot become form that cannot surrender itself, make itself public ). Art as it is practiced by the artist-do you not grasp what it is: an attempt to assassinate all pudeurs?134

Only in this century has woman ventured to turn to literature ( vers la canaille plumière écrivassière, 135 in the words of old Mirabeau): she dabbles in writing, she dabbles in art, she is los ing her instincts. But why? if one may ask.

818 (Nov. 1887-March 1888)

One is an artist at the cost of regarding that which all non artists call "form" as content, as "the matter itself." To be sure, then one belongs in a topsy-turvy world: for henceforth content becomes something merely formal-our life included.

819 (1883-1888)

A sense for and a delight in nuances (-the real mark of modernity), in that which is not general, runs counter to the drive that delights and excels in grasping the typical: like the Greek taste of the best period. There is an overpowering of the fullness of life in it; measure becomes master; at bottom there is that calm of the strong soul that moves slowly and feels repug Dance toward what is too lively. The general rule, the law, is honored and emphasized: the exception, conversely, is set aside, the nuance obliterated. The firm, powerful, solid, the life that reposes broad and majestic and conceals its strength--that is what "pleases"; i.e., that corresponds to what one thinks of oneself.

THE WILL TO POWER

820 (1885)

In the main, I agree more with the artists than with any philosopher hitherto: they have not lost the scent of life, they have loved the things of "this world"—they have loved their senses. To strive for "desensualization": that seems to me a misunderstand ing or an illness or a cure, where it is not merely hypocrisy or self-deception. I desire for myself and for all who live, may live, without being tormented by a puritanical conscience, an ever greater spiritualization and multiplication of the senses; indeed, we should be grateful to the senses for their subtlety, plenitude, and power and offer them in return the best we have in the way of spirit. What are priestly and metaphysical calumnies against the senses to us! We no longer need these calumnies: it is a sign that one has turned out well when, like Goethe, one clings with ever-greater pleasure and warmth to the "things of this world":-- for in this way he holds firmly to the great conception of man, that man becomes the transfigurer of existence when he learns to transfigure himself, 188

821 (March-June 1888)

Pessimism in art? The artist gradually comes to love for their own sake the means that reveal a condition of intoxication: extreme subtlety and splendor of color, definiteness of line, nuances of tone: the distinct where otherwise, under normal conditions, distinctness is lacking. All distinct things, all nuances, to the extent that they recall these extreme enhancements of strength that intoxi cation produces, awaken this feeling of intoxication by association: the effect of works of art is to excite the state that creates art intoxication.

What is essential in art remains its perfection of existence, its production of perfection and plenitude; art is essentially affirma

But the Goncourts? — The things they display are ugly: but that they dis play them comes from their pleasure in the ugly. It's no good! If you think otherwise, you're deceiving yourselves. How liberat ing is Dostoevsky!

822 (1888) If my readers are sufficiently initiated into the idea that "the good man" represents, in the total drama of life, a form of exhaus tion, they will respect the consistency of Christianity in conceiving the good man as ugly. Christianity was right in this.

For a philosopher to say, "the good and the beautiful are one," is infamy; if he goes on to add, "also the true," one ought to thrash him. Truth is ugly.

We possess art lest we perish of the truth.

-To awaken deceased ideals in all their merciless severity and brutaliy, as the most magnificent monsters they are.

A joyful delight in the psychological insight into the sinu osity and unconscious play-acting of all moralized artists.

-The falsity of art-to bring to light its immorality.

-To bring to light "basic idealizing powers" (sensuality, intoxication, superabundant animality).

...THE WILL TO POWER

First: one seeks for oneself a less artistic public, which loves

unconditionally (mand soon kneels down before the person). The superstition of our century, the superstitious

belief in the "genius," helps. Second: one harangues the obscure instincts of the dissatis

fied, ambitious, self-disguised spirits in a democratic age:

importance of poses. Third: one transfers the procedures of one art to the other

arts, confounds the objectives of art with those of knowl edge or the church or racial interests (nätionalism) or philosophy-one pulls all the stops at once and awakens

the dark suspicion that one may be a god. Fourth: one flatters women, sufferers, the indignant, one

makes narcotics and opiates dominant in art, too. One tickles the cultured, readers of poets and ancient stories.

825 (Spring-Fall 1887) The division into "public hall" and "private chamber"; in the former one has to be a charlatan today, in the latter one is deter mined to be a virtuoso and nothing more! The specific "genius" of our century spans this division, is great in both: the great charlatanry of Victor Hugo and Richard Wagner, but coupled with so much genuine virtuosity that they satisfied even the most refined artistic connoisseurs. Hence their lack of greatness: their perspective was continually changing, now directed to the coarsest demands, now to the most refined...

827 (Spring-Fall 1887)

Modern art as an art of tyrannizing. A coarse and strongly defined logic of delineation; motifs simplified to the point of formulas; the formula tyrannizes. Within the delineations a wild multiplicity, an overwhelming mass, before which the senses become confused; brutality in color, material, desires. Examples: Zola, Wagner; in a more spiritual order, Taine. Thus: logic, mass and brutality.

828 (1883-1888)

In regard to painters: tous ces modernes sont des poètes qui ont voulu être peintres. L'un a cherché des drames dans l'histoire, l'autre des scènes de moeurs, celui-ci traduit des religions, celui-là une philosophie.110 One imitates Raphael, another the early Italian masters; landscape artists employ trees and clouds to make odes and elegies. No one is simply a painter; all are archaeologists, psychologists, theatrical producers of this or that recollection or theory. They enjoy our erudition, our philosophy. Like us, they are full and overfull of general ideas. They like a form, not for the sake of what it is, but for the sake of what it expresses. They are sons of a scholarly, tormented, and reflective generation-a thousand miles removed from the old masters, who did not read and only thought of feasting their eyes.

The intuition of yet more distant; unexplored worlds; dis dain for the boulevards- For nationalism, let us not deceive our selves, is merely another form of exoticism,

Romantic musicians relate what exotic books have made of them: one would like to experience exotic things, passions after the Florentine and Venetian taste: in the end one contents one self with seeking them in pictures. The essential thing is the type of new desire, the wish to imitate and to experience the lives of others, disguise, dissimulation of the soul- Romantic art is only a makeshift substitute for a defective "reality."

The attempt to do new things: revolution, Napoleon. Napo leon, the passion of new possibilities of the soul, an expansion of the soul.

If one understands by artistic genius the greatest freedom under the law, divine frivolity, facility in the hardest things, then Offenbach has even more right to the name "genius" than Wagner. Wagner is heavy and ponderous: nothing is more foreign to him than moments of the most high-spirited perfection, such as this buffoon Offenbach achieves five or six times in almost every one of his buffooneries.143 But perhaps one might understand some thing else by the word genius.144_

"Dramatic music" nonsense! It is simply bad music "Feel ing," "passion" as surrogates when one no longer knows how to achieve an exalted spirituality and the happiness that attends it (e.g., that of Voltaire). Technically, "feeling" and "passion" are easier--they presuppose much poorer artists. Recourse to drama betrays that an artist is more a master of false means than of genuine means. We have dramatic painting, dramatic lyrics, etc.

BOOK THREE: Principles of A New Evaluation

441 a genuine conflict over "principles"—for as musicians we laugh at Herbart's velleities in this realm as much as we do at Schopen hauer's. In fact, this results in a great difficulty: we no longer know on what basis to found the concepts "model," "mastery," "perfection"-we grope blindly in the realm of values with the instinct of old love and admiration; we come close to believing "what is good is what pleases us"

It awakens my mistrust when Beethoven is everywhere quite innocently described as a "classicist": I would strictly maintain that in the other arts one understands by a classicist an artist of the opposite type of Beethoven's. But when even the complete and obvious disintegration of style in Wagner, his so-called dramatic style, is taught and honored as "exemplary," as "mastery," as "progress," my impatience reaches its height. The dramatic style in music, as Wagner understands it, is the renunciation of style in general, on the presupposition that something else is a hundred times more important than music, namely the drama. Wagner can paint, he employs music for something other than music, he empha sizes poses, he is a poet; finally, he appealed to "beautiful feelings" and "heaving bosoms" like all artists of the theater and with all this he won over the women and even those in need of culture: but what is music to women and those in need of culture! They have no conscience for art; they do not suffer when all the princi pal and most indispensable virtues of an art are trampled under foot and mocked for the benefit of secondary objectives (as ancilla148 dramaturgica). What is the point of extending the means of expres sion if that which expresses, art itself, has lost the law of its being! The picturesque pomp and power of tones, the symbolism of sound, rhythm, colors of harmony and disharmony, the suggestive significance of music, the whole sensuality of music which Wagner has brought into dominance call this Wagner recognized in music, drew out of it, developed. Victor Hugo did something similar to language; but already today the French are asking themselves whether, in Hugo's case, it was not a corruption of language whether, with the increase of sensuality in language, reason, spirit uality, the profound obedience to law in language have not been de pressed? That the poets in France have become sculptors, that the musicians in Germany have become actors and culture-mongers-- are these not signs of decadence?

839 (Spring-Fall 1887; rev. Spring-Fall 1888)

Today we have a musical pessimism, even among the non musical. Who has not met him, who has not cursed him the wretched youth who tortures his piano into cries of despair, who single-handed heaves forward the mud of the gloomiest gray-brown harmonies? This identifies one as a pessimist. But whether this also identifies one as a musician? I cannot be made to think so. The Wagnerian pur sang140 is unmusical; he succumbs to the ele mental powers of music somewhat as a woman succumbs to the will of her hypnotist-and in order to be able to do this, he must not be made suspicious by a severe and subtle conscience in rebus musicis et musicantibus.150 I said "somewhat as" , but perhaps we have more than a metaphor here. Consider the means for pro ducing effects that Wagner prefers to use and had for the most part to invent for himself): they are strangely similar to those with which a hypnotist achieves his effect (his choice of tempo and tonal color for his orchestra; the repellent avoidance of logic and squareness in his rhythm; the lingering, soothing, mysterious, hysterical quality of his "endless melody").- And is the condi tion to which the Lohengrin prelude, for example, reduces its hear ers, especially women, essentially different from a somnambulistic trance?

I heard an Italian woman who had just listened to the prelude in question say, with those entranced eyes that Wagneriennes know how to affect: "come si dorme con questa musica!"151

I distinguish between courage in the face of people, courage in the face of things, and courage in the face of paper. The latter was, e.g., the courage of David Strauss. I distinguish further be tween courage before witnesses and courage without witnesses: the courage of a Christian, of a believer in God in general, can never be courage without witnesses--this fact alone degrades it. I dis tinguish, finally, courage rooted in temperament and courage rooted in fear of fear: a particular instance of the latter type is moral courage. There should also be added courage from despair.

Wagner possessed this kind of courage. His situtaion regard ing music was, at bottom, desperate. He lacked the two things needed to make a good musician: nature and culture, a predis position toward music and training and schooling in music. He possessed courage: he made a principle of what he lacked-he invented a style of music for himself. “Dramatic music," as in vented by him, is the music he was capable of making-Wagner's limitations define this concept.

And he was misunderstood! Was he misunderstood? Five-sixths of modern artists are in this position. Wagner is their savior; five-sixths is in any case the "lowest estimate." In every instance in which nature has shown herself inexorable and in which on the other hand culture has remained accidental, tenta tive, dilettante, the artist turns instinctively--what am I saying? cnthusiastically to Wagner: "half did he drag him, half he sank," as the poet says.153

THE WILL TO POWER cannot be measured by the "beautiful feelings" he arouses: leave that idea to females. But according to the degree to which he approaches the grand style, to which he is capable of the grand style. This style has this in common with great passion, that it disdains to please; that it forgets to persuade; that it commands; that it wills - To become master of the chaos one is; to compel one's chaos to become form: to become logical, simple, unam biguous, mathematics, law--that is the grand ambition here.— It repels; such men of force are no longer loved a desert spreads around them, a silence, a fear as in the presence of some great sacrilege- All the arts know such aspirants to the grand style: why are they lacking in music? No musician has yet built as that architect did who created the Palazzo Pitti Here lies a problem. Does music perhaps belong to that culture in which the domain of men of force of all kinds has ceased? Does the concept grand style ultimately stand in contradiction to the soul of music to the "woman" in our music?--

I here touch upon a cardinal question: where does our entire music belong? The ages of classical taste knew nothing to com pare with it: it began to blossom when the Renaissance world had attained its evening, when "freedom" had departed from morals and even from men:-is it part of its character to be counter-Renaissance? Is it the sister of the Baroque style, since it is in any case its contemporary? Is music, modern music, not already decadence?

Once before I pointed to this question: whether our music is not a piece of counter-Renaissance in art? whether it is not next of-kin to the Baroque style? whether it has not grown up in con tradiction to all classical taste, so that all ambitions to become classical are forbidden to it by its nature?

The answer to this first-rank question of values would not remain in doubt if the proper inferences had been drawn from the fact that music achieved its greatest ripeness and fullness as roman ticism--once again as a movement of reaction against classicism.

Mozart-a delicate and amorous soul, but entirely eighteenth century, even when he is serious.-- Beethoven the first great romantic, in the sense of the French conception of romanticism, as Wagner is the last great romantic-both instinctive opponents of classical taste, of severe style-to say nothing of "grand" style.

A romantic is an artist whose great dissatisfaction with him self makes him creativewho looks away, looks back from him self and from his world.

845 (1885-1886)

Is art a consequence of dissatisfaction with reality? Or an expression of gratitude for happiness enjoyed? In the former case, romanticism, in the latter, aureole and dithyramb in short, art of apotheosis): Raphael, too, belongs here; he merely had the falsity to deify what looked like the Christian interpretation of the world. He was grateful for existence where it was not specifically Christian.

The moral interpretation makes the world unbearable. Chris tianity was the attempt to "overcome" the world by it; i.e., to negate it. In praxi, such a murderous attempt of insanity-an insane self-elevation of man above the world-resulted in making man gloomy, small, and impoverished: only the most mediocre and harmless type of man, the herd type, profited by it, was advanced by it, if you like.
