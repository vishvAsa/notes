## 1. The Doctrine of Order of Rank

854 (1884) In the age of suffrage universel, i.e., when everyone may sit in judgment on everyone and everything, I feel impelled to re establish order of rank.

855 (Spring-Fall 1887)

What determines rank, sets off rank, is only quanta of power, and nothing else.

856 (1885-1886)

.

The will to power.- How those men would have to be con stituted who took upon themselves this revaluation. Order of rank as order of power: war and danger the presupposition for a rank to retain the conditions of its existence. The grandiose prototype: man in nature- the weakest, shrewdest creature making himself master, subjugating the stupider forces.

857 (Jan.-Fall 1888)

I distinguish between a type of ascending life and another type of decay, disintegration, weakness. Is it credible that the question of the relative rank of these two types still needs to be posed?

858 (Nov. 1887-March 1888)

What determines your rank is the quantum of power you are: the rest is cowardice.

458

THE WILL TO POWER

859 (1883-1888) Advantage of detachment from one's age. In a state of de tachment from both movements, individualistic and collectivistic morality-for even the former does not recognize order of rank and would grant one the same freedom as all. My ideas do not re volve around the degree of freedom that is granted to the one or to the other or to all, but around the degree of power that the one or the other should exercise over others or over all, and to what extent a sacrifice of freedom, even enslavement, provides the basis for the emergence of a higher type. Put in the crudest form: how could one sacrifice the development of mankind to help a higher species than man to come into existence?

860 (1884)

Of rank. The terrible consequence of "equality"-finally, everyone believes he has a right to every problem. All order of rank has vanished.

861 (1884)

A declaration of war on the masses by higher men is needed! Everywhere the mediocre are combining in order to make them selves master! Everything that makes soft and effeminate, that serves the ends of the "people" or the "feminine," works in favor of suffrage universel, i.e., the dominion of inferior men. But we should take reprisal and bring this whole affair (which in Europe commenced with Christianity) to light and to the bar of judgment.

862 (1884)

A doctrine is needed powerful enough to work as a breeding agent: strengthening the strong, paralyzing and destructive for the world-weary.

Cf. section 1053 below and 462 above.

BOOK FOUR: Discipline and Breeding

459 The annihilation of the decaying races. Decay of Europe. The annihilation of slavish evaluations. Dominion over the earth as a means of producing a higher type.-- The annihilation of the tartuffery called "morality" (Christianity as a hysterical kind of honesty in this: Augustine, Bunyan).- The annihilation of suf frage universel; i.e., the system through which the lowest natures prescribe themselves as laws for the higher. The annihilation of mediocrity and its acceptance. (The onesided, individuals peoples; to strive for fullness of nature through the pairing of opposites: race mixture to this end).— The new courage-10 a priori truths (such truths were sought by those accustomed to faith!), but a free subordination to a ruling idea that has its time: e.g., time as a property of space, etc.

2. The Strong and the Weak

863 (Jan-Fall 1888) The concept "stronger and weaker man" reduces itself to the idea that in the first case a great deal of force is inherited- he is a summation in the second, as yet little inadequate in heritance, splintering of that which is inherited). Weakness can be an inaugural phenomenon: "as yet little"; or a terminal phe nomenon: "no more."

The starting point is where great force is, where force is to be discharged. The mass, as the sum of the weak, reacts slowly; defends itself against much for which it is too weak- of which it can make no use; does not create, does not advance.

This in opposition to the theory that denies the strong indi vidual and believes "the mass does it." It is the same difference as between two separated generations: four or five generations may lie between the active agent and the massa chronological differ ence,

The values of the weak prevail because the strong have taken them over as devices of leadership.

460

THE WILL TO POWER

: 864 (March-June 1888)

Why the weak conquer. In summa: the sick and weak have more sympathy, are "more humane" : the sick and weak have more spirit, are more changeable, various, entertaining-more ma licious: it was the sick who invented malice. (A morbid precocious ness is often found in the tickety, scrofulous and tubercular.) Esprit: quality of late races: Jews, Frenchmen, Chinese. (The anti Semites do not forgive the Jews for possessing "spirit" -and money. Anti-Semites-another name for the underprivileged.")

The sick and weak have had fascination on their side: they are more interesting than the healthy: the fool and the saint--the two most interesting kinds of man closely related to them, the "genius." The great "adventurers and criminals" and all men, es pecially the most healthy, are sick at certain periods in their lives: --the great emotions, the passions of power, love, revenge, are accompanied by profound disturbances. And as for decadence, it is represented in almost every sense by every man who does not die too soon:---thus he also knows from experience the instincts that belong to it:--almost every man is decadent for half his life.

Finally: woman! One-half of mankind is weak, typically sick, changeable, inconstant--woman needs strength in order to cleave to it; she needs a religion of weakness that glorifies being weak, loving, and being humble as divine: or better, she makes the strong weak—she rules when she succeeds in overcoming the strong. Woman has always conspired with the types of decadence, the priests, against the "powerful," the "strong," the men— Woman brings the children to the cult of piety, pity, love: the mother represents altruism convincingly..

Finally: increasing civilization, which necessarily brings with it an increase in the morbid elements, in the neurotic-psychiatric and criminal. An intermediary species arises: the artist, restrained from crime by weakness of will and social timidity, and not yet ripe for the madhouse, but reaching out inquisitively toward both spheres with his antennae: this specific culture plant, the modern artist, painter, musician, above all novelist, who describes his mode of life with the very inappropriate word "naturalism"- Lunatics, criminals, and "naturalists" are increasing: sign of a growing cul

461

ture rushing on precipitately-.e., the refuse, the waste, gain im portance the decline keeps pace.

Finally: the social hodgepodge, consequence of the Revolution, the establishment of equal rights, of the superstition of "equal men." The bearers of the instincts of decline (of ressentiment, dis content, the drive to destroy, anarchism, and nihilism), including the slave instincts, the instincts of cowardice, cunning, and canaille in those orders that have long been kept down, mingle with the blood of all classes: two, three generations later the race is no longer recognizable-everything has become mob. From this there results a collective instinct against selection, against privilege of all kinds, that is so powerful and self-assured, hard, and cruel in its operation, that the privileged themselves actually soon succumb to it: whoever still wants to retain power flatters the mob, works with the mob, must have the mob on its side-the "geniuses" above all: they become heralds of those feelings with which one moves the masses-the note of sympathy, even reverence, for all that has lived a life of suffering, lowliness, contempt, persecution, sounds above all other notes (types: Victor Hugo and Richard Wag ner). The rise of the mob signifies once again the ascendancy of the old values.

Such an extreme movement in respect of tempo and means as our civilization represents, shifts men's center of gravity: those men who matter most, who have, as it were, the task of compensating for the vast danger of such a morbid movement;—they will become procrastinators par excellence, slow to adopt, reluctant to let go, and relatively enduring in the midst of this tremendous change and mixture of elements. In such circumstances, the center of gravity necessarily shifts to the mediocre: against the dominion of the mob and of the eccentric (both are usually united), mediocrity consolidates itself as the guarantee and bearer of the future. Thus emerges a new opponent for exceptional menor a new seduction, Provided they do not accommodate themselves to the mob and try to fiatter the instincts of the "disinherited," they will have to be "mediocre" and "solid." They know: mediocritas is also aurea indeed, it alone disposes of money and gold of all that glitters ) -And once more the old virtue, and the entire dated world of the ideal in general, gains a body of gifted advocates. Result:

* Mediocrity is also gold.

462

THE WILL TO POWER mediocrity acquires spirit, wit, genius it becomes entertaining, it seduces.

Result.- A high culture can stand only upon a broad base, upon a strong and healthy consolidated mediocrity. Science and even artwork in its service and are served by it. Science could not wish for a better situation: it belongs as such to a mediocre kind of man-it is out of place among the exceptional-it has nothing aristocratic, and even less anything anarchistic, in its instinct.

The power of the middle is, further, upheld by trade, above all trade in money: the instinct of great financiers goes against every thing extreme--that is why the Jews are at present the most con serving power in our intensely threatened and insecure Europe. They can have no use for revolution, socialism, or militarism: if they desire and employ power, even over the revolutionary party, this is only a consequence of the aforesaid and not a contradiction. They need occasionally to arouse fear of other extreme tendencies by demonstrating how much power they have in their hands. But their instinct itself is unswervingly conservative and mediocre" Wherever there is power, they know how to be powerful; but the employment of their power is always in one direction. The honor able term for mediocre is, of course, the word "liberal."

Reflection.- It is absurd to assume that this whole victory of values is antibiological: one must try to explain it in terms of an interest life has in preserving the type "man" even through this method of the dominance of the weak and underprivileged—: otherwise, man would cease to exist?--Problem

The enhancement of the type fatal for the preservation of the species? Why?

History shows: the strong races decimate one another: through war, thirst for power, adventurousness; the strong affects: wasteful ness-(strength is no longer hoarded, spiritual disturbance arises through excessive tension); their existence is costly; in brief-they

ruin one another; periods of profound exhaustion and torpor supervene: all great ages are paid for--- The strong are subsequently weaker, more devoid of will, more absurd than the weak average.

They are races that squander. "Duration" as such has no value: one might well prefer a shorter but more valuable existence for the species. It would remain to be proved that, even so, a richer yield of value would be gained than in the case of the shorter existence; i.e., that man as summation of strength acquires a much greater quantum of mastery over things if life is as it is. We stand before a problem of economics

865 (Spring-Fall 1887)

An attitude that cals itself. "idealism" and that will not allow mediocrity to be mediocre, or woman to be woman. No uni formity! Let us be clear how dearly a virtue is bought; and that virtue is not something of average desirability, but a noble mad Dess, a beautiful exception, with the privilege of strong feelings

866 (Spring-Fall 1887; rev. Spring-Fall 1888)

The need to show that as the consumption of man and man kind becomes more and more economical and the "machinery" of interests and services is integrated ever more intricately, a counter movement is inevitable. I designate this as the secretion of a luxury surplus of mankind: it aims to bring to light a stronger species, a higher type that arises and preserves itself under different condi tions from those of the average man, My concept, my metaphor for this type is, as one knows, the word "overman."

On that first road which can now be completely surveyed, arise adaptation, leveling, higher Chinadom, modesty in the instincts, satisfaction in the dwarfing of mankind-a kind of stationary level of mankind. Once we possess that common economic management of the earth that will soon be inevitable, mankind will be able to find its best meaning as a machine in the service of this economy as a tremendous clockwork, composed of ever smaller, ever more subtly "adapted" gears; as an ever-growing superfluity of all dominating and commanding elements, as a whole of tremendous force, whose individual factors represent minimal forces, minimal values.

In opposition to this dwarfing and adaptation of man to a

THE WILL TO POWER

specialized utility, a reverse movement is needed the production of a synthetic, summarizing, justifying man for whose existence this transformation of mankind into a machine is a precondition, as a base on which he can invent his higher form of being.

He needs. the opposition of the masses, of the "leveled," a feeling of distance from them! he stands on them, he lives off them. This higher form of aristocracy is that of the future. Morally speaking, this overall machinery, this solidarity of all gears, repre sents a maximum in the exploitation of man; but it presupposes those on whose account this exploitation has meaning. Otherwise it would really be nothing but an overall diminution, a value di minution of the type man--a regressive phenomenon in the grand style.

It is clear, what I combat is economic optimism: as if increas ing expenditure of everybody must necessarily involve the in creasing welfare of everybody. The opposite seems to me to be the case; expenditure of everybody amounts to a collective loss: man is diminished-so one no longer knows what aim this tre mendous process has served. An aim? a new aim?--that is what humanity needs.

To fight upward out of that chaos to this form requires a compulsion: one must be faced with the choice of perishing or prevailing. A dominating race can grow up only out of terrible and violent beginnings. Problem: where are the barbarians of the twentieth century? Obviously, they will come into view and consolidate themselves only after tremendous socialist crises—they will be the elements capable of the greatest severity toward themselves and able to gurantee the most enduring will.

869 (1885-1886)

The most powerful and most dangerous passions of man, of which he can most easily perish, have been outlawed so com pletely that the most powerful men themselves have become im possible or have had to feel evil—"harmful and forbidden.” This loss is considerable, but hitherto it has been unavoidable: now that a host of counterforces has been reared by the temporary suppression of those passions (of lust for power, pleasure in change and deception), it is again possible to unloose them: they will no longer possess their old savagery. We permit ourselves a tame barbarism: just look at our artists and statesmen.

870 (1884)

The root of all evil: that the slavish morality of meekness, chastity, selflessness, absolute obedience, has triumphed--ruling natures were thus condemned (1) to hypocrisy, (1) to: torments of conscience-creative natures felt like rebels against God, un certain and inhibited by eternal values.

The barbarians showed that the ability for restraint was not at home among them: they feared and slandered the passions and drives of nature:-also the view of the ruling Caesars and classes. On the other hand, the suspicion arose that all moderation was weakness, or a sign of growing old and weary (thus La Rochefoucauld suspected that "virtue" was a pretty word among those who could no longer take any pleasure in vice). Moderation itself was represented as a matter of severity, self-conquest, asceti cism, as a fight with the devil, etc. The natural delight of aesthetic natures in measure, the enjoyment of the beauty of measure, was466

overlooked or denied, because one desired an anti-eudaemonistic morality.

The faith in the pleasure of moderation--that pleasure of the rider on a fiery steed!—has been lacking hitherto. - The mediocrity of weaker natures has been confused with the modera

tion of the strong!

In summa: the best things have been slandered because the weak or the immoderate swine have cast a bad light on them and the best men have remained hidden—and have often mis understood themselves.

871 (Nov, 1887-March 1888)

The vicious and unbridled: their depressive influence on the value of the desires. It was the dreadful barbarism of custom that, especially in the Middle Ages, compelled the creation of a veritable "league of virtue"-together with an equally dreadful exaggeration of that which constitutes the value of man. Struggling "civilization" (taming) needs every kind of irons and torture to maintain itself against terribleness and beast-of-prey natures.

Here a confusion is quite natural, although its influence has been fatal: that which men of power and will are able to demand of themselves also provides a measure of that which they may permit themselves. Such natures are the antithesis of the vicious and unbridled: although they may on occasion do things that would convict a lesser man of vice and immoderation.

Here the concept of the "equal value of men before God" is extraordinarily harmful; one forbade actions and attitudes that were in themselves among the prerogatives of the strongly con stituted as if they were in themselves unworthy of men. One brought the entire tendency of the strong into disreputę when one erected the protective measures of the weakest (those who were weakest also when confronting themselves) as a norm of value.

Confusion went so far that one branded the very virtuosi of life (whose autonomy offered the sharpest antithesis to the vicious and unbridled) with the most opprobrious names. Even now one believes one must disapprove of a Cesare Borgia; that is simply laughable. The church has excommunicated German emperors on account of their vices: as if a monk or priest had any right to join in a discussion about what a Frederick II may demand of him

self. A Don Juan is sent to hell: that is very naive. Has it been noticed that in heaven all interesting men are missing? Just a hint to the girls as to where they can best find their salvation. If one reflects with some consistency, and moreover with a deepened insight into what a "great man" is, no doubt remains that the church sends all "great men" to hell-it fights against all "great ness of man."

872 (1884)

The rights a man arrogates to himself are related to the duties he imposes upon himself, to the tasks to which he feels equal. The great majority of men have no right to existence, but are a misfortune to higher men.

873 (1884) Misunderstanding of egoism on the part of common natures who know nothing whatever of the pleasure of conquest and the insatiability of great love, nor of the overflowing feeling of strength that desires to overpower, to compel to itself, to lay to its heart the drive of the artist in relation to his material, Often it is merely the penchant for activity that is looking for a field of action.

In ordinary "egoism" it is precisely the "non-ego," the profoundly average creature, the species man, who desires to preserve himself: if this is perceived by rarer, subtler, and less average men, it enrages them, For they judge: "we are nobler! Our preservation is more important than that of those cattle!"

The words that immediately follow in the MS have been omitted in all editions: "I do not yet grant the failures [den Missrathenen] the right. There are also peoples that are failures (missrathene Völker]." While these words in a note not intended for publication (first printed in 1911, p. 512) sound ominous, it is clear from Nietzsche's books that he is not thinking of the Jews, the Poles, the Russians, or any other peoples whom the Nazis later decimated.

468

THE WILL TO POWER

When lesser men begin to doubt whether higher men exist, then the danger is great! And one ends by discovering that there is virtue also among the lowly and subjugated, the poor in spirit, and that before God men are equal which has so far been the non plus ultra of nonsense on earth! For ultimately, the higher men measured themselves according to the standard of virtue of slaves _found they were "proud," etc., found all their higher qualities reprehensible.

When Nero and Caracalla sat up there, the paradox arose: "the lowest man is worth more than that man up there!" And the way was prepared for an image of God that was as remote as possible from the image of the most powerful--the god on the cross!

875 (1884)

The higher man and the herd man. When great men are lacking, one makes demigods or whole gods out of the great men of the past: the outbreak of religion demonstrates that man no longer delights man ("no, nor woman neither," with Hamlet). Or: one brings many men together into one heap as a parliament and hopes they will be equally tyrannical.

"Tyrannization" is the quality of great men; they make lesser men stupid.

876 (1888)

The best example of the degree to which a plebeian agitator of the mob is incapable of comprehending the concept "higher nature" is provided by Buckle. The view he combats so passion ately that "great men," individuals, princes, statesmen, geniuses, generals are the levers and causes of all great movements-is in stinctively misunderstood by him, as if it meant that what is essential and valuable in such "higher men" were their capacity for setting masses in motion: in short, their effect.

But the "higher nature" of the great man lies in being dif ferent, in incommunicability, in distance of rank, not in an effect of any kind even if he made the whole globe tremble.

The misunderstanding attacked here is widespread among those who have attempted popular expositions of Nietzsche. Again and again, the view

The Revolution made Napoleon possible: that is its justifi cation. For the sake of a similar prize one would have to desire the anarchical collapse of our entire civilization. Napoleon made nationalism possible: that is its excuse.

The value of a man (apart from his morality or immorality, naturally; for with these concepts the value of a man is not even touched) does not reside in his utility; for it would continue to exist even if there were no one to whom he could be of any use. And why could not precisely that man who produced the most disastrous effects be the pinnacle of the whole species of man: so high, so superior that everything would perish from envy of him?

878 (Spring-Fall 1887)

To appraise the value of a man according to how useful he is to men, or how much he costs, or what harm he does them that is as much-or as little as to appraise a work of art accord ing to the effects it produces. But in this way, the value of a man in comparison with other men is not even touched upon. "Moral evaluation," in so far as it is a social evaluation, measures men exclusively according to the effects they produce. A man with a taste of his own, enclosed and concealed by his solitude, incom municable, reserved- an unfathomed man, thus a man of a higher, at any rate a different species: how should you be able to evaluate him, since you cannot know him, cannot compare him?

Moral valuation has resulted in the greatest obtuseness of judgment: the value of a man in himself is underrated, almost over looked, almost denied. Remnant of naive teleology: the value of man only in relation to men.

Preoccupation with morality places a spirit in a low order of rank: he lacks the instinct for privilege, the a parte, the feeling of freedom of creative natures, of the children of God" (or of the devil).

Replacement of morality by the will to our goal, and conse quently to the means to it.

881 (Spring-Fall 1887; rev. Spring-Fall 1888)

Order of rank:- What is mediocre in the typical man? That he does not understand the necessity for the reverse side of things: that he combats evils as if one could dispense with them; that he will not take the one with the other---that he wants to erase and extinguish the typical character of a thing; a condition, an age, a person, approving of only one part of their qualities and wishing to abolish the others. The "desirability" of the mediocre is what we others combat: the ideal conceived as something in which nothing harmful, evil, dangerous, questionable, destructive would remain. Our insight is the opposite of this: that with every growth of man, his other side must grow too; that the highest man, if such a concept be allowed, would be the man who represented the anti thetical character of existence most strongly, as its glory and sole justification Commonplace men can represent only a tiny nook and corner of this natural character: they perish when the multi plicity of elements and the tension of opposites, i.e., the pre conditions for greatness in man, increases. That man must grow better and more evil is my formula for this inevitability

Most men represent pieces and fragments of man: one has to add them up for a complete man to appear. Whole ages, whole peoples are in this sense somewhat fragmentary; it is perhaps part of the economy of human evolution that man should evolve piece by piece. But that should not make one forget for a moment

471 that the real issue is the production of the synthetic man; that lower men, the tremendous majority, are merely preludes and re hearsals out of whose medley the whole man appears here and there, the milestone man who indicates how far humanity has advanced so far. It does not advance in a single straight line; often a type once achieved is lost again with all the tensions of the past three hundred years, for example, we have not yet reattained the man of the Renaissance, and the man of the Renais sance, in turn, is inferior to the man of antiquity).7.

by employing one against the other and reserving freedom for itself..

885 (Nov. 1887-March 1888)

I have grasped this much: if one had made the rise of great and rare men dependent upon the approval of the many (assum ing that the latter knew what qualities belonged to greatness and also at whose expense all greatness evolves) -Well, there would never have been a single significant man!

That the course of things makes its way independently of the approval of the great majority: that is why a few astonishing things have insinuated themselves on the earth.

886 (Spring-Fall 1887)

The order of rank of human values.

a. One should not evaluate a man according to individual works. Epidermal actions. Nothing is rarer than a personal action. A class, a rank, a race, an environment, an accident--anything is more likely to be expressed in a work or act than is a "per sonality? [eine "Person").

b. One should not assume in any case that many men are "personalities." And then some are several personalities, most are none. Wherever the average qualities preponderate, on which the preservation of a type depends, being a personality would be a waste, a luxury, it would be senseless to demand a "personality." They are bearers, tools of transmission.

c. The "personality," a relatively isolated fact; considering the far greater importance of continuation and averageness, almost something antinatural. For the production of a personality one needs early isolation, a compulsion to an existence of defense and combat, something like an incarceration, a greater power of self-definition; and above all a much lower impressionability than that of the average man, whose humanity is contagious.

First question concerning order of rank: how solitary or how gregarious one is. (In the latter case, one's value resides in the qualities that secure the survival of one's herd, one's type; in the former, in that which distinguishes, isolates, defends one, and makes one's solitariness possible.)

Consequence: one should not evaluate the solitary type from

BOOK FOUR: Discipline and Breeding

473 the viewpoint of the gregarious, nor the gregarious from the view point of the solitary.

Viewed from a height, both are necessary; their antagonism is also necessary-and nothing should be banished more thoroughly than the "desirability" that some third thing might evolve out of the two ("virtue" as hermaphroditism). That is as little "desirable" as the approximation and reconciliation of the sexes. To evolve further that which is typical, to make the gulf wider and wider

Concept of degeneration in both cases: when the herd starts to acquire the qualities of the solitary, and the latter the qualities of the herd-in short, when they approximate each other. This concept of degeneration has nothing to do with moral evaluation.

887 (Spring-Fall 1887)

Where one must seek the stronger natures. The ruin and degeneration of the solitary species is much greater and more ter rible; they have the instincts of the herd, the tradition of values, against them; their instruments of defense, their protective in stincts, are from the beginning not sufficiently strong or certain -chance must be very favorable to them if they are to prosper (--they prosper most often in the lowest and socially most aban doned elements; if one looks for personality, that is where one finds it much more certainly than in the middle classes!).

The strata and class struggle that aims at "equality of rights" --once it is more or less over, the war against the solitary per sonality will begin. (In a certain sense, the latter can maintain and develop himself most easily in a democratic society: namely, when the coarser means of defense are no longer necessary and habits of order, honesty, justice, and trust are part of the usual con ditions.)

The strongest must be bound most firmly, watched, laid in chains, and guarded if the instinct of the herd has its way. For them a regime of self-control, ascetic detachment, or "duty" in exhausting work in which one completely loses oneself.

equipped with the virtues of the machine (he must learn to experience the states in which he works in a mechanically useful way as the supremely valuable states; hence it is necessary to spoil the other states for him as much as possible, as highly danger ous and disreputable).

The first stumbling block is the boredom, the monotony, that all mechanical activity brings with it. To learn to endure this-- and not only endure it—to learn to see boredom enveloped in a higher charm; this has hitherto been the task of all higher school ing. To learn something that is of no concern to us, and to find one's "duty" precisely in this "objective activity; to learn to value pleasure and duty as altogether separate things--that is the in valuable task and achievement of higher schooling. This is why the philologist has hitherto been the educator as such; because his activity provides the model of sublime monotony in action; under his banner the young man learns to "grind"': first prerequisite for future efficiency in the fulfillment of mechanical duties (as civil servant, husband, office slave, newspaper reader, and soldier). Such an existence perhaps requires a philosophical justification and transfiguration more than any other; agreeable feelings in general must be relegated to a lower rank by some sort of infallible court of appeal; “duty in itself," perhaps even the pathos of reverence in regard to everything disagreeable and this demand speaking imperatively from beyond any question of utility, amusement, purpose The mechanical form of existence as the highest, most venerable form of existence, worshiping itself ( type: Kant as a fanatic of the formal concept "thou shalt").S

The economic valuation of ideals hitherto—i.e., selection of certain affects and states, selected and reared at the expense of others. The lawgiver (or the instinct of society) selects a number of states and affects through whose operation a regularity in performance is guaranteed (namely, a mechanical performance as a consequence of the regular requirements of those affects and states).

Supposing that these states and affects contain painful in

Cf. Twilight, "Skirmishes," section 29 (Portable Nietzsche, p. 532), where these ideas receive the definitive formulation,

gredients, then a means must be found to overcome these painful ingredients through a value-idea designed to make displeasure seem valuable and therefore pleasurable in a higher sense. Re duced to a formula: "How can something disagreeable become agreeable?" For example, when our obedience, our submission to the law, attain honor through the strength, power, self-over coming they entail. As do our consideration for the community, the neighbor, the fatherland, our "humanization," our "altruism," "heroism."

That one should like to do disagreeable things--that is the object of ideals.

Absurd and contemptible form of idealism that would not have mediocrity mediocre and, instead of feeling a sense of triumph at a state of exceptionalness, becomes indignant over cowardice, falsity, pettiness, and wretchedness. One should not desire these things to be different! and should make the gulf wider! — One should compel the higher kind of man to sever himself from the others through the sacrifices he has to make to his state of being.

Chief viewpoint: establish distances, but create no antitheses. Dissolve the intermediate forms and reduce their influence: chief means of preserving distances.

Hatred for mediocrity is unworthy of a philosopher: it is almost a question mark against his "right to philosophy." Pre cisely because he is an exception he has to take the rule under his protection, he has to keep the mediocre in good heart.

894 (Spring-Fall 1887)

What I fight against: that an exceptional type should make war on the rule-instead of grasping that the continued existence of the rule is the precondition for the value of the exception. For example, the ladies who, instead of feeling their abnormal thirst for scholarship as a distinction, want to disrupt the status of woman in general.

The increase of force despite the temporary decline of the individual:

still possible for the weak and suffering; to implant solidarity as an instinct against the instinct of

fear and servility; struggle against accident, also against the accident of "great

897 (Jan-Fall 1888) Whover reflects upon the way in which the type man can be raised to his greatest spendor and power will grasp first of all that he must place himself outside morality; for morality has been essentially directed to the opposite end: to obstruct or destroy that spendid evolution wherever it has been going on. For such an evolution does indeed consume so great a quantity of men in its service that a reverse movement is only too natural: the weaker, more delicate, intermediate existences need to take sides against that gloriousness of life and strength; and to that end they have to acquire a new valuation of themselves by virtue of which they can condemn life in this highest plenitude, and where possible destroy it. A tendency hostile to life is therefore characteristic of morality, in so far as it wants to overpower the types of life.

898 (Spring-Fall 1887)

The strong of the future. That which partly necessity, partly chance has achieved here and there, the conditions for the production of a stronger type, we are now able to comprehend and consciously will: we are able to create the conditions under which such an elevation is possible.

Until now, "education" has had in view the needs of society: not the possible needs of the future, but the needs of the society of the day. One desired to produce "tools" for it. Assuming the wealth of force were greater, one could imagine forces being subtracted, not to serve the needs of society but some future need.

Such a task would have to be posed the more it was grasped to what extent the contemporary form of society was being so powerfully transformed that at some future time it would be unable to exist for its own sake alone, but only as a tool in the hands of a stronger race.

The increasing dwarfing of man is precisely the driving force that brings to mind the breeding of a stronger race-a race that would be excessive precisely where the dwarfed species was weak

478

THE WILL TO POWER

and growing weaker (in will, responsibility, self-assurance, ability to posit goals for oneself).

The means would be those history teaches: isolation through interests in preservation that are the reverse of those which are average today; habituation to reverse evaluations; distance as a pathos; a free conscience in those things that today are most under valued and prohibited.

The homogenizing of European man is the great process that cannot be obstructed: one should even hasten it. The necessity to create a gulf, distance, order of rank, is given eo ipso not the necessity to retard this process.

As soon as it is established, this homogenizing species requires a justification: it lies in serving a higher sovereign species that stands upon the former and can raise itself to its task only by doing this. Not merely a master race whose sole task is to rule, but a race with its own sphere of life, with an excess of strength for beauty, bravery, culture, manners to the highest peak of the spirit; an affirming race that may grant itself every great luxury strong enough to have no need of the tyranny of the virtue imperative, rich enough to have no need of thrift and pedantry, beyond good and evil; a hothouse for strange and choice plants.

Main consideration; not to see the task of the higher species in leading the lower (as, e.g., Comte does), but the lower as a base upon which higher species performs its own tasks--- upon which alone it can stand.

The conditions under which a strong and noble species main tains itself (regarding spiritual discipline) are the reverse of those which govern the "industrial masses," the shopkeepers à la Spencer,

That which is available only to the strongest and most fruit ful natures and makes their existence possible-leisure, adventure, disbelief, even dissipation--would, if it were available to mediocre natures, necessarily destroy them and actually does. This is where industriousness, rule, moderation, firm "conviction" have their place-in short, the "herd virtues”: under them this intermediate type of man grows perfect.

The happiness and self-contentment of the Lazzaroni16 or the "bliss" of "beautiful souls" or the consumptive love of Herrn huteristic17 pietists prove nothing regarding order of rank among men. As a great educator, one would have to scourge such a race of "blessed people" mercilessly into unhappiness. The danger of dwarfing, of relaxation is present at once:-against Spinozistic or Epicurean happiness and against all relaxation in contemplative states. But if virtue is the means to such a happiness, very well, then one has to become master over virtue, too.

I absolutely cannot see how one can later make up for having failed to go to a good school at the proper time. Such a man does not know himself; he walks through life without having learned to walk; his flabby muscles reveal themselves with every step. Sometimes life is so merciful as to offer this hard schooling once more later: sickness for years perhaps, that demands the most extreme strength of will and self-sufficiency; or a sudden calamity, affecting also one's wife and child, that compels one to a form of activity that restores energy to the slack fibers and toughness to the will to live. The most desirable thing is still under all circumstances a hard discipline at the proper time, i.e., at that age at which it still makes one proud to see that much is de manded of one. For this is what distinguishes the hard school as a good school from all others that much is demanded; and sternly demanded; that the good, even the exceptional, is demanded as the norm; that praise is rare, that indulgence is nonexistent; that blame is apportioned sharply, objectively, without regard for talent or antecedents.

One needs such a school from every point of view: that

To be able to command and also proudly to obey; to stand in the ranks, but also capable at any time of leading; to prefer danger to comfort; not to weigh the permitted and the forbidden on a shopkeeper's scales; to be a foe more of the petty, sly, parasitic, than of the evil.- What does one learn in a hard school?

I also want to make asceticism natural again: in place of the aim of denial, the aim of strengthening; a gymnastics of the will; abstinence and periods of fasting of all kinds, in the most spiritual realm, too; a casuistry of deeds in regard to the opinions we have regarding our strengths; an experiment with adventures and arbitrary dangers.

1. asceticism: one has hardly the courage so far to display its natural utility, its indispensability in the service of the education of the will. Our absurd pedagogic world, before which the "useful civil servant" hovers as a model, thinks it can get by with "in struction," with brain drill; it has not the slightest idea that something else is needed first-education of will power; one devises tests for everything except for the main thing: whether one can will, whether one may promise; the young man finishes school without a single question, without any curiosity even, con cerning this supreme value-problem of his nature;

2. fasting: in every senseeven as a means of preserving the delicacy of one's ability to enjoy all good things (e.g., occasion ally to stop reading, listening to music, being pleasant; one must have fast days for one's virtues, too);

3. the "monastery": temporary isolation, accompanied by strict refusal, e.g., of letters; a kind of most profound self-reflection and self-recovery that desires to avoid, not "temptations,” but "duties": an escape from the daily round; a detachment from the tyranny of stimuli and influences that condemns us to spend our strength in nothing but reactions and does not permit their accu mulation to the point of spontaneous activity (one should observe our scholars from close up: they think only reactively, i.e., they have to read before they can think);

4. feasts: One has to be very coarse in order not to feel the presence of Christians and Christian values as an oppression beneath which all genuine festive feelings go to the devil. Feasts include: pride, exuberance, wantonness; mockery of everything serious and Philistine; a divine affirmation of oneself out of animal plenitude and perfection-one and all states which the Christian cannot honestly welcome. The feast is paganism par excellence;

To feel stronger-or in other words, joy-always presupposes a comparison (but not necessarily with others, but with oneself in the midst of a state of growth and without one's first knowing in how far one is making comparisons-).

Artificial strengthening: whether by stimulating chemicals or by stimulating errors ("delusions"):

e.g., the feeling of security such as a Christian possesses; he feels strong in being able to trust, to be patient and composed: he owes this artificial strength to the illusion of being protected by a god;

e.g., the feeling of superiority: as when the caliph of Morocco is allowed to see only globes upon which his three united kingdoms occupy four-fifths of the surface;

e.g., the feeling of uniqueness: as when the European imagines that the march of culture takes place in Europe, and when he seems to himself to be a kind of abridged world process, or when the Christian makes all existence in general revolve around the "salvation of man."

It is a question of where one feels the pressure, the con straint: according to where this is, a different feeling of being stronger will be produced. A philosopher, e.g., feels in the midst of the coolest, most transmontane abstraction acrobatics like a fish in water, while colors and tones oppress him; to say nothing of the dim desires that which others call "the ideal."

918 (Jan.-Fall 1888) One would make a fit little boy stare if one asked him: "Would you like to become virtuous?"- but he will open his eyes wide if asked: "Would you like to become stronger than your friends?"

One must learn in time to command just as much as to obey, One must learn modesty, tact in modesty: that is, to confer distinction and to honor by being modest; the same with trust to confer distinction, to honor.

For what does one have to atone most? For one's modesty; for having failed to listen to one's most personal requirements; for having mistaken oneself; for having underestimated oneself; for having lost a good ear for one's instincts: this lack of reverence for oneself revenges itself through every kind of deprivation: health, friendship, well-being, pride, cheerfulness, freedom, firm ness, courage. One never afterward forgives oneself for this lack of genuine egoism: one takes it for an objection, for a doubt about a real ego.

Marginal note on a niaiserie anglaise 22- "Do not unto others what you would not have them do unto you." That counts as wisdom; that counts as prudence; that counts as the basis of morality-as the "golden rule." John Stuart Mill believes in it (and what Englishman does not?) But this rule does not brook the slightest attack. The calculation, "do nothing that ought not to be done to you," prohibits actions on account of their harm ful consequences: the concealed premise is that an action will always be requited. But what if someone holding the Principe23 in his hand were to say: "It is precisely such actions that one must perform, to prevent others from performing them first to deprive others of the chance to perform them on us"?

Nonetheless, the rule is valuable because it betrays a type of man: it is the instinct of the herd that finds its formula in this Tule---ope is equal, one takes oneself for equal: as I to you, thus you to me. Here there is a real belief in an equivalence of actions that in all actual circumstances simply does not exist. Not every action can be returned: between actual "individuals" there are no equal actions, consequently no "requital" - When I do something, I am very far from thinking that anyone else can do much the same: it belongs to me- One cannot pay me back, it will always be another" action that is perpetrated against me.

926 (Nov. 1887-March 1888)

Against John Stuart Mill.- I abhor his vulgarity, which says: "What is right for one is fair for another"; "what you would not, etc., do not unto others'; which wants to establish all human intercourse on the basis of mutual services, so that every action appears as a kind of payment for something done to us. The presupposition here is ignoble in the lowest sense: here an equiv alence of value between my actions and yours is presupposed; here the most personal value of an action is simply annulled (that which cannot be balanced or paid in any way.--).

"Reciprocity" is a piece of gross vulgarity; precisely that something I do may not and could not be done by another, that no balance is possible (except in the most select sphere of "my equals," inter pares ), that in a deeper sense one never gives back, because one is something unique and does only unique things—this fundamental conviction contains the cause of aristocratic segregation from the masses, because the masses be lieve in "equality" and consequently in equivalence and "reci procity."

"Should one follow one's feelings?"-That one should put one's life in danger, yielding to a generous feeling and under the impulse of a moment, that is of little value and does not even characterize one. Everyone is equally capable of that—and in this resolution, a criminal, a bandit, and a Corsican certainly excel decent people.

A higher stage is; to overcome even this pressure within us and to perform a heroic act not on impulse--but coldly, raisonnable, without being overwhelmed by stormy feelings of pleasure. The same applies to compassion: it must first be habitually sifted by reason; otherwise it is just as dangerous as any other affect.

Blind indulgence of an affect, totally regardless of whether it be a generous and compassionate or a hostile affect, is the cause of the greatest evils.

Greatness of character does not consist in not possessing these affects on the contrary, one possesses them to the highest degree-but in having them under control. And even that without any pleasure in this restraint, but merely because

Whether it be compassion or anger or revenge-that one stakes one's life on it does not make any value difference. How many have sacrified their lives for pretty girls-and, worse, even their health! If one has the temperament, one instinctively chooses what is dangerous; e.g., adventures in speculation if one is a philosopher; or in immorality if one is

virtuous. One kind of man will risk nothing, another wants risks. Are we others despisers of life? On the contrary, we seek life raised to a higher power, life lived in danger - 24 But that, to repeat it, does not mean we want to be more virtuous than others. Pascal, e.g., wanted to risk nothing25 and remained a Christian: perhaps that was virtuous. One always makes sacrifices.

930 (Nov. 1887-March 1888)

How much advantage man sacrifices, how little "self-in terested” he is! All his affects and passions demand their rights— and how remote from the prudent utility of self-interest is an affect!

One does not desire "happiness"; one must be English to be able to believe that man always seeks his advantage 26 Our desires want to violate things with a protracted. passion—their accumulated strength seeks resistance.

931 (Spring-Fall 1887) The affects are one and all useful, some directly, others indirectly; in regard to utility, it is quite impossible to fix any scale of valueseven though in economic terms the forces of nature are one and all good, i.e., useful, and also the source of so much terrible and irrevocable fatality. The most one could say is that the most powerful affects are the most valuable, in as much as there are no greater sources of strength.

25 An allusion to Pascal's famous wager that God exists (Pensées, avail able in many editions and translations; in the bilingual edition by H. F. Stewart, with an English translation on facing pages, and notes and an intro duction, Routledge and Kegan Paul, London 1950, pp. 116-21). For a critical analysis, see my Critique of Religion and Philosophy, section 49.

Cf. also Jean-Marie Guyau, Esquisse d'une morale sans obligation ni sanction (F. Alcan, Paris 1885), p. 212: "Il y avait donc dans le pari de Pascal un élément qu'il n'a pas mis en lumière. Il n'a guère vu que la crainte du risque, il n'a pas vu le plaisir du risque." (There is in the wager of Pascal an element he did not make clear. He saw only the fear of risk, he did not see the pleasure of risk.)

THE WILL. TO POWER

932 (Spring-Fall 1887) Well-meaning, helpful, good-natured attitudes of mind have not come to be honored on account of their usefulness, but because they are states of richer souls that are capable of bestowing and have their value in the feeling of the plenitude of life. Observe the eyes of benefactors: what one sees is the antithesis of self denial, of hatred for the moi, of "Pascalism."

933 (Spring-Fall 1887)

In Summa: domination of the passions, not their weakening or extirpation! The greater the dominating power of a will, the more freedom may the passions be allowed.

The "great man" is great owing to the free play and scope of his desires and to the yet greater power that knows how to press these magnificent monsters into service,

The "good man" is at every stage of civilization the harmless and the useful combined: a kind of mean; the expression of the general consciousness of the kind of man whom one has no reason to fear but whom one must nonetheless not despise.

Education essentially the means of ruining the exceptions for the good of the rule 27 Higher education:28. essentially the means of directing taste against the exceptions for the good of the mediocre.

Only when a culture has an excess of powers at its disposal can it also constitute a hothouse for the luxury cultivation of the exception, the experiment, of danger, of the nuance:--this is the tendency of every aristocratic culture.

934 (Spring-Fall 1887)

Nothing but questions of strength: how far to prevail against the conditions that preserve society and against its prejudices? how far to unchain one's terrible qualities through which most people perish? how far to oppose truth and reflect on its most

questionable sides?-how far to oppose suffering, self-contempt, pity, sickness, vice, with the query as to whether one cannot become master of them? (What does not destroy us makes us stronger20.-)..finally: how far to acknowledge in one's mind the rule, the commonplace, the petty, good, upright, the average nature, without letting oneself be vulgarized by them?- Hardest test of character: not to let oneself be ruined through seduction by the good. The good as luxury, as subtlety, 30 as vice.

935 (Fall 1888)

936 (Nov, 1887-March 1888)

Aristocracy. Herd-animal ideals. Now culminating as the highest value standard of "society": attempt to give them a cosmic, even a metaphysical value.- Against them I defend aristocracy.

A society that preserves a regard and delicatesse for freedom must feel itself to be an exception and must confront a power from which it distinguishes itself, toward which it is hostile, and on which it looks down.

The more I relinquish my rights and level myself down, the more I come under the dominion of the average and finally of the majority. The presupposition inherent in an aristocratic society for preserving a high degree of freedom among its members is the extreme tension that arises from the presence of an antagonistic drive in all its members; the will to dominate

THE WILL TO POWER in rank, you will also abolish all strong love, lofty attitudes, and the feeling of individuality,

Toward a true psychology of the society based on freedom and equality- What diminishes?.

The will to self-responsibility, sign of the decline of autonomy; efficiency in defense and attack, also in the most spiritual things: the power of commanding; the sense of reverence, subservience, ability to keep silent; great passion, the great task, tragedy, cheer fulness.

937 (Spring-Fall 1887) Augustin Thierry read in 1814, what De Montlosier had said in his work De la monarchie française: he answered with a cry of indignation and commenced his work. That emigrant had said: Race d'affranchis, race d'esclaves arrachés de nos mains, peuple tributaire, peuple nouveau, licence vous fut octroyée d'être libres, et non pas à nous d'être nobles; pour nous tout est de droit, pour vous tout est de grâce, nous ne sommes point de votre communauté; nous sommes un tout par nous-mêmes.82

938 (1884)

How the aristocratic world increasingly bleeds itself and makes itself weaker! Because of the nobility of its instincts it throws away its privileges and because of the refinement of its hyper-culture it takes an interest in the people, the weak, the poor, the poetry of the petty, etc.

939 (1885-1886)

There is a noble and dangerous carelessness that permits a profound inference and insight: the carelessness of the self-assured and overrich soul that has never troubled about friends but knows only hospitality, and practices, and knows how to practice,

* "Tribe of freedmen, tribes of slaves torn from our hands, tributary people, new people, license has been granted to you to be free, but not to us to be noble; for us everything is a right, for you everything is a matter of grace; we are not part of your community; we are entire by ourselves."

BOOK FOUR: Discipline and Breeding

495

only hospitality-heart and home open to anyone who cares to enter, whether beggar or cripple or king. This is genuine geniality: whoever has that, has a hundred "friends" but in all probability not a single friend.

940 (1884)

The teaching mêden agan38 applies to men of overflowing strength-not to the mediocre. The enkrateia34 and askēsis35 is only a stage toward the heights: the "golden nature" is higher.

"Thou shalt"_unconditional obedience in Stoics, in the Christian and Arab orders, in the philosophy of Kant (it is im material whether to a superior or to a concept).

Higher than "thou shalt" is "I will” (the heroes); higher than "I will" stands: "I am" (the gods of the Greeks).

The barbarian gods express nothing of the pleasure of re straint--are neither simple nor frivolous nor moderate.

941 (Summer-Fall 1883)

The meaning of our gardens and palaces (and to this extent also the meaning of all desire for riches) is: to remove disorder and vulgarity from sight and to build a home for nobility of soul.

The majority, to be sure, believe they will acquire higher natures when those beautiful, peaceful objects have operated upon them: hence the rush to go to Italy and on travels, etc.; all reading and visits to theatres. They want to have themselves formed that is the meaning of their cultural activity! But the strong, the mighty want to form and no longer to have anything foreign about them!

Thus men also plunge into wild nature, not to find themselves but to lose and forget themselves in it. "To be outside oneself as the desire of all the weak and the self-discontented.

THE WILL TO POWER not speaking here of the little word "von" or of the Almanach de Gotha:38 parenthesis for asses.) When one speaks of "aristocrats of the spirit," reasons are usually not lacking for concealing some thing; as is well known, it is a favorite term among ambitious Jews. For spirit alone does not make noble; rather, there must be something to ennoble the spirit. What then is required? Blood.37

943 (1885)

What is noble?38

-Care for the most external things, in so far as this care forms a boundary, keeps distant, guards against confusion.

- Apparent frivolity in word, dress, bearing, through which a stoic severity and self-constraint protects itself against all im modest inquisitiveness.

Slowness of gesture, and of glance. There are not too many valuable things: and these come and wish to come of themselves to the valuable man. We do not easily admire.

-Endurance of poverty and want, also of sickness.

-Avoidance of petty honors and mistrust of all who praise readily: for whoever praises believes he understands what he praises: but to understand...Balzac, that typical man of ambition, has revealed it--comprendre c'est égaler 39

-Our doubt as to the communicability of the heart goes deep; solitude not as chosen but as given.

-The conviction that one has duties only to one's equals, toward the others one acts as one thinks best: that justice can

** "'The Almanach de Gotha, which has existed since 1763, published since 1871 botki in French and German, gives a particular account of all the royal and princely families of Europe ..." (Encyclopaedia Britannica, 11th ed., vol. I, p. 712). The word von is the mark of nobility in this sense, and when Friedrich Schiller, for example, was elevated to the nobility his name became Friedrich von Schiller.

37 When Heinrich Härtle quoted this note in Nietzsche und der National sozialismus (Eher, Zentralverlag der NSDAP, Munich 1937), p. 55, he omitted the "parenthesis for asses," without indicating that anything had been omitted. This was entirely typical of the Nazis' use of Nietzsche. For a discussion of this note, see my Nietzsche, Chapter 10, near the end

*Cf. the last chapter of Beyond Good and Evil, which bears the same title. According to 1911, p. 513, this section was originally intended for use in the preface to the second edition of) Mixed Opinions and Aphorisms, the second volume of Human, All-Too-Hunian.

be hoped for (unfortunately not counted on) only inter pares.40

An ironic response to the "talented," the belief in a nobility by birth in moral matters too.

-Always to experience oneself as one who bestows honors, while there are not many fit to honor one.

Always disguised: the higher the type, the more a man requires an incognito. If God existed, he would, merely on grounds of decency, be obliged to show himself to the world only as a man.

-The ability for otium,t the unconditional conviction that although a craft in any sense does not dishonor, it certainly takes away nobility. No "industriousness" in the bourgeois sense, how ever well we may know how to honor and reward it, or like those insatiably cackling artists who act like hens, cackle and lay eggs and cackle again.

-We protect artists and poets and those who are masters in anything; but as natures that are of a higher kind than these, who have only the ability to do something, merely "productive inen," we do not confound ourselves with them.

--Pleasure in forms; taking under protection everything formal, the conviction that politeness is one of the greatest virtues; mistrust for letting oneself go in any way, including all freedom of press and thought, because under them the spirit grows com fortable and doltish and relaxes its limbs.

Delight in women, as in a perhaps smaller but more deli cate and ethereal kind of creature. What joy to encounter creatures who have only dancing, foolishness, and finery in their heads! They have been the delight of every very tense and profound male soul whose life was weighed down with great responsibilities.

--Pleasure in princes and priests, because they preserve the belief in differences in human values even in the valuation of the past, at least symbolically and on the whole even actually.

--Ability to keep silent: but not a word about that in the presence of listeners.

-Endurance of protracted enmities: lack of easy recon cilability.

* Among equals. But see The Antichrist, which is later: "When the ex ceptional human being treats the mediocre more tenderly than himself and his peers, this is not mere courtesy of the heart-it is simply his duty" (section 57; Portable Nietzsche, p. 647).

THE WILL TO POWER

-Disgust for the demagogic, for the "enlightenment," for "being cozy,"42 for plebeian familiarity.

---The collection of precious things, the needs of a high and fastidious soul; to desire to possess nothing in common. One's own books, one's own landscapes.

-We rebel against experiences, good and bad, and are slow to generalize. The individual case: how ironic we feel toward the individual case if it has the bad taste to pose as the rule!

-We love the naive and naive people, but as spectators and higher natures; we find Faust just as naive as his Gretchen.

We esteem the good very little, as herd animals: we know that in the worst, most malignant, hardest men a priceless golden drop of goodness is often concealed, that outweighs all mere benevolence of milk souls.

-We consider that a man of our kind is not refuted by his vices, por by his follies. We know that we are hard to recognize, and that we have every reason to give ourselves foregrounds.

944 (Jan-Fall 1888)

What is noble? - That one constantly has to play a part. That one seeks situations in which one has constant need of poses. That one leaves happiness to the great majority: happiness as peace of soul, virtue, comfort, Anglo-angelic shopkeeperdom à la Spen cer. That one instinctively seeks heavy responsibilities. That one knows how to make enemies everywhere, if the worst comes to the worst even of oneself. That one constantly contradicts the great majority not through words but through deeds.

945 (1886-1887)

Virtue (e.g., in the form of truthfulness) as our noble and dangerous luxury; we must not refuse the disadvantages it brings with it.

What is chastity in a man? That his sexual taste has remained noble; that in eroticis he likes neither the brutal nor the morbid nor the prudent.

948 (Nov. 1887-March 1888) The "concept of honor": resting on the faith in "good society," in chivalrous basic traits, in the obligation continually to maintain poise. Essentiaf: that one does not think one's life important; that one insists unconditionally on good manners on the part of every one with whom one comes in contact (at least, when they do not belong to "us"); that one is neither familar, nor genial, nor merry, nor modest, except inter pares; that one always maintains poise.

949 (Nov. 1887-March 1888)

That one stakes one's life, one's health, one's honor, is the consequence of high spirits and an overflowing, prodigal will: not from love of man but because every great danger challenges our curiosity about the degree of our strength and our courage.

of those who have a right to such questionable questions, the strongest souls of today, whose best control is over themselves: is it not time, now that the type "herd animal" is being evolved more and more in Europe, to make the experiment of a fundamental, artificial and conscious breeding of the opposite type and its virtues? And would it not be a kind of goal, redemption, and justification for the democratic movement itself if someone arrived who could make use of it-by finally producing beside its new and sublime development of slavery (-that is what European democracy müst become ultimately) a higher kind of dominating and Caesarian spirits who would stand upon it, maintain themselves by it, and elevate themselves through it? To new, hitherto impos sible prospects, to their own prospects? To their own tasks?

955 (1885)

To view the contemporary European makes me very hopeful: an audacious ruling race is developing on the basis of an extremely intelligent herd mass. It will not be long before the movement for the cultivation of the latter will no longer have the foreground all to itself.

The same conditions that hasten the evolution of the herd animal also hasten the evolution of the leader animal.

Law-giving moralities are the principal means of fashioning man according to the pleasure of a creative and profound will, provided that such an artist's will of the first rank has the power in its hands and can make its creative will prevail through long periods of time, in the form of laws, religions, and customs. Such men of great creativity, the really great men according to my under standing, will be sought in vain today and probably for a long

time to come: they are lacking; until, after much disappointment, one must begin to comprehend why they are lacking and that nothing stands more malignantly in the way of their rise and evolu tion, today and for a long time to come, than what in Europe today is called simply "morality"-as if there were no other morality and could be no other the aforementioned herd-animal morality which is striving with all its power44 for a universal green-pasture happiness on earth, namely for security, absence of danger, comfort, the easy life, and ultimately, if all goes well," hopes to do away with any kind of shepherd or bellwhether. The two doctrines it preaches most often are: "equal rights" and "sympathy with all that suffers!' -and it takes suffering itself to be something that must absolutely be abolished. That such rideas as these are still modern gives one a bad opinion of modernity.

Whoever has thought profoundly about where and how the plant man has hitherto grown most vigorously must conclude that this has happened under the reverse conditions: that the danger ousness of his situation must grow to tremendous proportions, that his power of invention and dissembling must struggle up be neath protracted oppression and compulsion, that his will to live must be enhanced to an unconditional will to power and to over power, and that danger, severity, violence, danger in the street as well as in the heart, inequality of rights, concealment, stoicism, the art of experiment, devilry of all kinds, in short the opposite of all the herd thinks desirable, are necessary for the elevation of the type man. A morality with such reverse intentions, which desires to train men for the heights, not for comfort and mediocrity, a morality with the intention of training a ruling caste---the future masters of the earth-must, if it is to be taught, appear in as sociation with the prevailing moral laws, in the guise of their terms and forms. That for this, however, many transitional means of deception must be devised, and that, because the lifetime of a single man signifies virtually nothing in relation to the accomplish ment of such protracted tasks and aims, the very first thing to be done is the rearing of a new kind of man, in whom the duration of the necessary will and the necessary instinct will be guaranteed through many generations-a new master type and caste-all this

is as obvious as is the protracted and not easily expressible etcetera of this idea.

To prepare a reversal of values for a certain strong kind of man of the highest spirituality and strength of will and to this end slowly and cautiously to unfetter a host of instincts now kept in check and calumniated whoever reflects on this becomes one of us, the free spirits-to be sure, a different kind of free spirit" from those before us; for the latter wanted approximately the op posite of what we do. To us, it seems to me, belong above all the pessimists of Europe, the poets and thinkers of an enraged idealism, in so far as their discontent with all existence involved them at least by logical necessity in a discontent with present-day man; also certain insatiably ambitious artists who unhesitatingly and unconditionally fight for the special rights of higher men and against the "herd animal" and who, by means of the seductions of art, lull to sleep all herd instincts and herd cautiousness in choice spirits; thirdly and finally all those critics and historians who courageously carry forward the happily-begun discovery of the world of anti quity-it is the work of the new Columbus, the German spirit (for we still stand at the beginning of this conquest). For in the world of antiquity there reigned a different, more lordly morality than today; and the man of antiquity, raised in this morality, was a stronger and deeper man than the man of today—he alone has hitherto been "the man that has turned out well." But the seductive power that antiquity exercises on such well-turned-out, i.e., strong and enterprising, souls is the most subtle and effective of all anti democratic and anti-Christian influences even today, as at the time of the Renaissance.

962 (1885)

A great man a man whom nature has constructed and in vented in the grand style. what is he?

First: there is a long logic in all of his activity, hard to survey because of its length, and consequently misleading; he has the ability to extend his will across great stretches of his life and to despise and reject everything petty about him, including even the fairest, "divinest" things in the world.

Secondly: he is colder, harder, less hesitating, and without fear of "opinion"; he lacks the virtues that accompany respect and "respectability," and altogether everything that is part of the "virtue of the herd.” If he cannot lead, he goes alone; then it can happen that he may snarl at some things he meets on his way.

Third: he wants no "sympathetic" heart, but servants, tools; in his intercourse with men he is always intent on making some thing out of them. He knows he is incommunicable: he finds it tasteless to be familiar; and when one thinks he is, he usually is not. When not speaking to himself, he wears a mask. He rather lies than tells the truth: it requires more spirit and will.47 There is a solitude within him that is inaccessible to praise or blame, his own justice that is beyond appeal.

963 (Spring-Fall 1887)

The great man is necessarily a skeptic48 (which is not to say that he has to appear to be one), provided that greatness consists in this: to will something great and the means to it. Freedom from any kind of conviction is part of the strengh of his will. Thus it accords with that "englightened despotism" exercised by every great passion. Such a passion takes the intellect into its service; it has the courage even for unholy means; it removes scruples; it permits itself convictions, it even needs them, but it does not submit to them. The need for faith, for anything unconditional

14 The theme of the mask and the need for masks is more fully developed in Beyond Good and Evil. For the many relevant passages see the index to my translation (New York: Vintage Books, 1966).

This note was put to use in The Antichrist, section 54 (Portable Nietz sche, pp. 638-39).506

THE WILL TO POWER in Yes and No, is a proof of weakness; all weakness is weakness of will. The man of faith, the believer, is necessarily a small type of man. Hence "freedom of spirit," i.e., unbelief as an instinct [is a precondition of greatness.]49

964 (1884)

The great man feels his power over a people, his temporary coincidence with a people or a millenium; this enlargement in his experience of himself as causa and voluntas is misunderstood as "altruism"; it drives him to seek means of communication: all great men are inventive in such means. They want to embed themselves in great communities, they want to give a single form to the multifarious and disordered; chaos stimulates them.

Misunderstanding of love. There is a slavish love that submits and gives itself; that idealizes, and deceives itself—there is a divine love that despises and loves, and reshapes and elevates the beloved.

To gain that tremendous energy of greatness in order to shape the man of the future through breeding and, on the other hand, the annihilation of millions of failures, and not to perish of the suffering one creates, though nothing like it has ever existed!

965 (1884) The revolution, confusion, and distress of peoples is, in my view, inferior to the distress of great individuals during their development. One must not let oneself be deceived: the many distresses of all the small constitute a sum only in the feelings of powerful human beings. To think of oneself in moments of great danger, to derive advantage from the disadvantage of many: this can be, in the case of a very high degree of deviation, a sign of a great character who manages to master his compassionate and just impulses.

Thus a drive as master, its opposite weakened, refined, as the impulse that provides the stimulus for the activity of the chief drive.

The highest man would have the greatest multiplicity of drives, in the relatively greatest strength that can be endured. Indeed, where the plant "man" shows himself strongest one finds instincts that conflict powerfully (e.g., in Shakespeare), but are controlled.

967 (1885)

Whether one does not have the right to account all great men evil? This cannot be shown in a pure state in all individual cases. Often they have been capable of masterly dissimulation and assumed the outward forms and gestures of great virtues. Often they honored virtue seriously and with a passionate hard ness against themselves, but out of cruelty: seen from a distance, this is deceptive. Many misunderstood themselves; not infrequently a great task calls forth great qualities, e.g., justice. The essential point is: the greatest perhaps also possess great virtues, but in that case also their opposites. I believe that it is precisely through the presence of opposites and the feelings they occasion that the great man, the bow with the great tension, develops.

968 (1886-1887)

In great men, the specific qualities of life injustice, false hood, exploitation-are at their greatest. But in so far as they have had an overwhelming effect, their essence has been most misunderstood and interpreted as goodness. Type: Carlyle as interpreter.50

to Cutting remarks about Carlyle are also found in The Gay Science, section 97 ("Garrulity from inner satisfaction with noise and confused feelings; e.g., in Carlyle"); in Beyond Good and Evil, section 252; in Twi light, "Skirmishes," sections 1 and 12 (he is also mentioned in section 44); in The Antichrist, section 54; and in sections 27, 312, 343, 455, 747 above.

THE WILL TO POWER

969 (Spring-Fall 1887)

In general, every thing is worth as much as one has paid for it. This does not hold, to be sure, if one takes the individual in isolation; the great capabilities of the individual are utterly out of proportion to what he himself has done, sacrificed, and suffered for them. But if one considers his family history, one discovers the history of a tremendous storing up and capital accumulation of strength through all kinds of renunciation, struggle, work, and prevailing. It is because the great man has cost so much, and not because he appears as a miracle and gift of heaven and "chance," that he has become great: "heredity" a false concept. One's forebears have paid the price for what one is.

970 (1883-1888)

Danger in modesty.---- To adapt ourselves too early to the tasks, societies, everyday life and everyday work, in which chance has placed us, at a time when neither our strength nor our goal has yet entered our consciousness with the force of law; the all too-early certainty of conscience, comfortableness, sociability thus achieved, this premature resignation that insinuates itself into our feelings as a release from inner and outer unrest, pampers and holds one back in the most dangerous fashion. To learn to feel respect after the fashion of those like us," as if we ourselves had no measure in us and no right to determine values; the effort to evaluate as others do, against the inner voice of our taste, which is also a form of conscience, becomes a terrible, subtle constraint: if there is not finally an explosion, with a sudden bursting asunder of all the bonds of love and morality, then such a spirit becomes withered, petty, effeminate, and factual.

The opposite is bad enough, but better nonetheless: to suffer from one's environment, from its praise as well as from its blame, wounded by it and festering inwardly without betraying the fact; to defend oneself with involuntary mistrust against its love, to learn silence, perhaps concealing it behind speech,51 to create for oneself nooks and undiscoverable solitudes for moments of relief,

971 (Nov. 1887-March 1888)

Men who are destinies, who by bearing themselves bear destinies, the whole species of heroic bearers of burdens: oh how they would like to rest from themselves for once! how they thirst for strong hearts and necks, so as to be free from what oppresses them, at least for a few hours! And how vainly they thirst! - They wait; they look at everything that passes; no one approaches them with as much as a thousandth part of their suffering and passion, 63 no one divines in what way they are waiting-At length, at length they learn their first piece of worldly prudence-not to wait any more; and soon another one: to be genial, to be modest, from now on to endure everyone, to endure everything-in short, to endure even a little more than they have endured so far.

6. The Highest Man as Legislator

of the Future

97204 (1884)

Legislators of the future. After having tried in vain for a long time to attach a definite concept to the word "philosopher" for I found many contradictory characteristics I recognized at last that there are two distinct kinds of philosopher:

1. those who want to ascertain a complex fact of evaluations (logical or moral);

2. those who are legislators of such evaluations.

The former try to master the world of the present or the past by concentrating and abridging the multiplicity of events through signs: their aim is to make previous events surveyable,

* Leiden. * Leidenschaft.

According to 1911, p. 513, this section was composed by the editor from two drafts, but Schlechta, too, follows all previous editions in printing it as a single note. Roughly the first half of this material was put to use in Beyond Good and Evil, section 211.

510

THE WILL TO POWER comprehensible, graspable, and usable they assist the task of man to employ all past things for the benefit of his future.

The latter, however, are commanders; they say: "Thus it shall be!" They alone determine the "whither" and the "wherefore," what is useful and what constitutes utility for men; they dispose of the preparatory work of scientific men, and all knowledge is for them only a means for creation. This second kind of philosopher rarely prospers; and their situation and danger is indeed fearful. How often they have deliberately blindfolded themselves simply so as not to have to behold the narrow ledge that separates them from a plunge into the abyss; e.g., Plato, when he convinced himself that the "good" as he desired it was not the good of Plato but the "good in itself," the eternal treasure that some man, named Plato, had chanced to discover on his way! This same will to blindness dominates the founders of religions in a much coarser form: theit "thou shalt" must not by any means sound in their ears like "I will they dare to fulfill their task only as the command of a god; only as an "inspiration" is their value legislation a bearable burden under which their conscience is not crushed.

As soon as these two means of comfort, that of Plato and that of Mohammed, have fallen away and no thinker can relieve his conscience with the hypothesis of a "god" or "eternal values," the claim of the legislator of new values rises to a new fearfulness never yet attained. From then on, those elect on whom the suspicion of having such a duty begins to dawn, try to see if they cannot, "at the right moment," elude it, as their greatest danger, through some kind of detour; for example, by convincing themselves that the task has already been accomplished, or cannot be accomplished, or that their shoulders are not strong enough for such burdens, or that they are already overburdened with other, more immediate tasks, or that even this new, distant duty is a seduction and temptation, drawing them away from all other duties, a sickness, a kind of madness. Many may indeed succeed in eluding it: history is full of the traces of men who have eluded this task, and of their bad consciences. Usually, however, there came to these men of fate that redeeming hour, that autumnal hour of ripeness, in which they had to do what they did not even "want to do and the deed of which they had hitherto been most afraid fell easily and unsought from the tree, as an involuntary deed, almost as a gift.

The human horizon. One can conceive philosophers as those who make the most extreme efforts to test how far man could elevate himself-- Plato especially: how far his strength will reach. But they do it as individuals; perhaps the instinct of the Caesars, of founders of states, etc., was greater, as they pondered how far man might be driven in his evolution and under "favorable con ditions." But they had an insufficient understanding of the nature of favorable circumstances. Great question: where has the plant "man" hitherto grown up most magnificently? For this question the study of comparative history is necessary.

974 (Fall 1888)

A fact, a work is eloquent in a new way for every age and every new type of man. History always enunciates new truths.

975 (1885-1886)

To remain objective, hard, firm, severe in carrying through an idea-artists succeed best in this; but when one needs men for this (as teachers, statesmen, etc., do), then the repose and coldness and hardness soon vanish. With natures like Caesar and Napoleon, one gets some notion of "disinterested" work on their marble, whatever the cost in men. On this road lies the future of the highest men: to bear the greatest responsibility and not collapse under it.— Hitherto, the delusions of inspiration were almost always needed in order not to lose one's faith in one's right and one's hand.

Why the philosopher rarely turns out well. His requirements include qualities that usually destroy a man:

danger of going to pieces;

The really royal calling of the philosopher (as expressed by Alcuin the Anglo-Saxon): prava corrigere, et recta corroborare, et sancta sublimare.55

978 (1885) The new philosopher can arise only in conjunction with a ruling caste, as its highest spiritualization. Great politics, rule over the earth, are at hand; complete lack of the principles that are needed.

979 (1885)

Fundamental thought: the new values must first be created we shall not be spared this task! For us the philosopher must be a legislator. New types. (How the highest types hitherto [e.g., Greeks) were reared: to will this type of "chance" consciously.)

980" (1885)

Assuming one thinks of a philosopher as a great educator, powerful enough to draw up to his lonely height a long chain of generations, then one must also grant him the uncanny privi leges of the great educator. An educator never says what he himself thinks, but always only what he thinks of a thing in relation to the requirements of those he educates. He must not be detected in this dissimulation; it is part of his mastery that one believes in his honesty. He must be capable of employing every mcans of discipline:37 some he can drive toward the heights only

with the whips of scorn; others, who are slugglish, irresolute, cowardly, vain, perhaps only with exaggerated praise. Such an educator is beyond good and evil; but no one must know it.

981 (Spring-Fall 1887) Not to make men "better," not to preach morality to them in any form, as if "morality in itself," or any ideal kind of man, were given; but to create conditions that require stronger men who for their part need, and consequently will have, a morality (more clearly: a physical-spiritual discipline) that makes them strong!

Not to allow oneself to be misled by blue eyes or heaving bosoms: greatness of soul8 has nothing romantic about it. And unfortunately nothing at all amiable.

982 (1884) One must learn from war: (1) to associate death with the interests for which one fights that makes us venerable; (2) one must learn to sacrifice many and to take one's cause seriously enough not to spare men; (3) rigid discipline, and to permit one self force and cunning in war.

Education in those rulers' virtues that master even one's benevolence and pity: the great cultivator's virtues (“forgiving one's enemies" is child's play by comparison), the affect of the creator must be elevated no longer to work on marble! - The exceptional situation and powerful position of those beings (com pared with any prince hitherto): the Roman Caesar with Christ's soul.50

984 (1884) Greatness of soul is inseparable from greatness of spirit. 60 For it involves independence; but in the absence of spiritual greatness, independence ought not to be allowed, it causes mischief, even through its desire to do good and practice "justice." Small spirits must obey-hence cannot possess greatness.

The higher philosophical man, who has solitude not because he wishes to be alone but because he is something that finds no equals: what dangers and new sufferings have been reserved for him precisely today, when one has unlearned belief in order of rank and consequently does not know how to honor and under stand this solitude! Formerly the sage almost sanctified himself in the mind of the crowd by going apart in this way—today the hermit sees himself surrounded as if by a cloud of gloomy doubts and suspicions. And not merely on the part of the envious and

Ashton (Chicago, Henry Regnery, 1961), the end of the section on "Self-Identification with the Opponent"; and Kauf mann, "Jaspers Relation to Nietzsche," in From Shakespeare to Existen tialism (Garden City: Doubleday Anchor Books, 1960, p. 300). In a nutshell: for Jaspers this phrase represents one of the most amazing at tempts to bring together again into a higher unity what (Nietzsche] has first separated and opposed to each other..Nietzsche imagines without any power of vision and unrealizably the synthesis of the ultimate opposi tion." For me the same phrase represents "the very heart of Nietzsche's vision of the overman. Being capable of both sympathy and hardness, of loving and ruling, not using claws though having them ..."

"Seelengrösse nicht zu trennen von geistiger Grösse. This is one of the occasional passages in which it is tempting to translate Geist and geistig as intellect and intellectual; for these would come closer to Nietzsche's mean ing here. It is important to realize that when Nietzsche uses these terms he generally means neither spirit alone nor intellect alone but also mind, wit, and esprit. But if we used spirit in one passage, wit in another, intellect in a third, and mind elsewhere, something of considerable importance would be lost. It seems better to ask the reader to kep in mind what Geist means, and that "spirit" always stands for Geist.

This whole matter, of course, transcends philological niceties; what is at stake is one of the most crucial points of Nietzsche's philosophy: he was not an irrationalist. And all the men he most admired were, without excep tion, great intellects—but not merely great intellects. Cf. sections 876 f above.

wretched: he must sense misunderstanding, neglect, and super ficiality even in all benevolence shown him. He knows that crafty cunning of narrow-minded pity that feels itself good and holy when it tries to "save" him from himself, perhaps by means of more comfortable situations or more orderly, more reliable company—indeed, he will have to admire the unconscious instinct of destruction with which all the spiritually mediocre go to work against him, with a perfect faith in their right to do so!

It is necessary for these men of incomprehensible loneliness to wrap themselves vigorously and boldly in the cloak of external, spatial solitude, too; that is part of their prudence. Even cunning and disguise are needed today if such a man is to preserve him self, to keep himself aloft, in the midst of the dangerous, down dragging currents of the age. Every attempt to endure in the present, to endure the present, every approach to the men and aims of today, he will have to atone as if it were his own special sin; and he may marvel at the concealed wisdom of his nature that, after every such attempt, at once draws him back to himself by means of sickness and bad accidents.

The most difficult and highest form of man will succeed most rarely: thus the history of philosophy reveals a superabundance of failures, of accidents, and an extremely slow advance; whole mil lennia intervene and overwhelm what had been achieved; the continuity is broken again and again. It is an appalling history-- the history of the highest man, the sage.

THE WILL TO POWER What is most harmed is precisely the memory of the great, for the semi-failures and the failures misunderstand them and vanquish them by means of "successes." Every time "an influence" shows itself, a mob crowds upon the scene; the chatter of the petty and the poor in spirit is a terrible torment for the ears of those who remember with a shudder that the destiny of humanity depends upon the attainment of its highest type.

From my childhood I have pondered the conditions for the existence of the sage, and I will not conceal my joyous conviction that he is again becoming possible in Europe-perhaps only for a short time.

988 (1885)

We new philosophers, however, not only do we start by describing the actual order of rank and differences in the value of men, we also desire precisely the opposite of an assimilation, an equalization:03 we teach estrangement in every sense, we open up gulfs such as have never existed before, we desire that man should become more evil than he has ever been before. In the meantime, we are still strangers to and from one another. We have many reasons to be hermits and to put on masks—we shall therefore be poor at looking for those like us. We shall live alone and probably suffer the torments of all seven solitudes. But if we should come across one another, one may wager that we mistake or mutually deceive one another.

990 (1885) I forgot to say that such philosophers are cheerful and that they like to sit in the abyss below a perfectly clear sky: they need different means from other men for enduring life; for they suffer differently (namely, as much from the profundity of their con tempt for man as from their love for man).- The most suffering animal on earth invented for itself laughter.

991 (1885-1886) On the misunderstanding of "cheerfulness." Temporary relief from a protracted tension; the high spirits, the saturnalia of a spirit that is dedicating and preparing itself for protracted and terrible decisions. The "fool" in the form of "science."

993 (1885)

It is a comfort to me to know that above the steam and filth of human lowlands there is a higher, brighter humanity, very small in number (for everything outstanding is by its nature rare): one belongs to it, not because one is more talented or more virtuous or more heroic or more loving than the men below, but because one is colder, brighter, more far-seeing, more solitary; because one endures, prefers, demands solitude as happiness, as privilege, indeed as a condition of existence; because one lives among clouds and lightning as among one's own kind, but equally among rays of sunlight, drops of dew, flakes of snow, and every thing that necessarily comes from the heights and, when it moves, moves eternally only in the direction from above to below. Aspirations toward the heights are not ours.-- Heroes, martyrs, geniuses and enthusiasts are not still, patient, subtle, cold, slow enough for us.

How do men attain great strength and a great task? All the virtues and efficiency of body and soul are acquired laboriously and little by little, through much industry, self-constraint, limi tation, through much obstinate, faithful repetition of the same labors, the same renunciations, but there are men who are the heirs and masters of this slowly-acquired manifold treasure of virtue and efficiency--because, through fortunate and reasonable marriages, and also through fortunate accidents, the acquired and stored-up energies of many generations have not been squandered and dis persed but linked together by a firm ring and by will. In the end there appears a man, a monster of energy, who demands a monster of a task. For it is our energy that disposes of us; and the wretched spiritual game of goals and intentions and motives is only a foreground-even though weak eyes may take them for the matter itself.

996 (1885-1886) The sublime man has the highest value, even if he is terribly delicate and fragile, because an abundance of very difficult and rare things has been bred and preserved together through many generations.

At the same time I seemed to myself irrevocably incarcerated in my philology and teaching--in an accident and makeshift of

At the same time I grasped that my instinct went into the oppo site direction from Schopenhauer's: toward a justification of life, even at its most terrible, ambiguous, and mendacious; for this I had the formula "Dionysian."

Against the theory that an "in-itself of things" must neces sarily be good, blessed, true, and one, Schopenhauer's interpre tation of the "in-itself” as will was an essential step; but he did not understand how to deify this will: he remained entangled in the moral-Christian ideal. Schopenhauer was still so much subject to the dominion of Christian values that, as soon as the thing-in itself was no longer "God" for him, he had to see it as bad, stupid, and absolutely reprehensible. He failed to grasp that there can be an infinite variety of ways of being different, even of being

We have emancipated ourselves from fear of reason, the ghost that haunted the eighteenth century: we again dare to be absurd, childish, lyrical-in one word: "we are musicians." We are as little afraid of the ridiculous as of the absurd. The devil finds that the tolerance of God works in his favor: even more, he is interesting as one who has been mis understood and slandered from of old-we rescue the honor of the devil.

We no longer separate the great from the terrible. We include together the good things, in their complexity, and the worst things: we have overcome the absurd "desirability" of former days (which desired increase of the good without increase of the evil). Cowardice before the ideal of the Renaissance has receded_we even dare to aspire to its mores. Intolerance toward the priest and the church has come to an end at the same time; “it is immoral to believe in God"_but precisely this seems to us the best justification of such faith.

We have granted all these things their rights. We are not afraid of the reverse side of "good things" (-we seek them: we are brave and curious enough); e.g., of Hellenism, of morality, of reason, of good taste (we compute the losses one sustains with all such precious things; one almost makes oneself poor with such a precious thing---). Just as little do we conceal from ourselves the reverse side of bad things.

Is there a more dangerous aberration than contempt for the body? As if it did not condemn all spirituality to become sickly

to the vapeurs of “idealism"!

Whatever Christians and idealists have devised has neither rhyme nor reason: we are more radical. We have discovered the "smallest world" as that which is decisive everywhere.72

The way our streets are paved, good air in our room,73 food --we grasp their value; we have taken all the necessities of exist ence seriously and despise all "beautiful-soulism" as a kind of "levity and frivolity." What was formerly most despised has been brought to the front.

1017 (Spring-Fall 1887)

In place of the "natural man" of Rousseau, the nineteenth century has discovered a truer image of "man"-it has had the courage to do so. On the whole, the Christian concept "man" has thus been reinstated. What one has not had the courage for is to call this “man in himself" good and to see in him the guarantee of the future. Neither has one dared to grasp that an increase in the terribleness of man is an accompaniment of every increase in culture; in this, one is still subject to the Christian ideal and takes its side against paganism, also against the Renaissance concept of virtù. But the key to culture is not to be found in this way: and in praxi one retains the falsification of history in favor of the "good man" (as if he alone constituted the progress of man) and the socialist ideal (i.e., the residue of Christianity and of Rousseau in the de-Christianized world).

The struggle against the eighteenth century: its supreme over coming by Goethe and Napoleon. Schopenhauer, too, struggles against it; but he involutarily steps back into the seventeenth century-he is a modern Pascal, with Pascalian value judgments without Christianity. Schopenhauer was not strong enough for a new Yes.

1019 (Spring-Fall 1887; rev. Spring-Fall 1888)

On the pessimism of strength.- In the inner psychic economy of the primitive man, fear of evil predominates. What is evil? Three things: chance, the uncertain, the sudden. How does primi tive man fight against evil? He conceives it as reason, as power, even as a person. In this way he establishes the possibility of entering into a kind of treaty with it and in general to exercise influence over it in advance-to forestall it.

—Another expedient is to assert that its malice and harm fulness is merely appearance: one interprets the consequences of chance, of the uncertain and sudden as well meant, as meaningful,

14 The Musarion edition, vol. XLX. p. 431, actually gives the date as follows: "1018: 86-87." As usual, it bases its information on 1911, where we are told on p. 494 that 1018 comes from "N XLII, 77"--and on p. 480, that the MS identified as "N XLII" belongs to the period 1886/87. The editors did not notice that the contents of the note rules out 1886.

527 -A third means: one interprets the bad above all as "de served": one justifies evil as punishment.

-In summa one submits to it: the whole religio-moral inter pretation is only a form of submission to evil. The faith that a good meaning lies in evil means to abandon the struggle against it.

Now the whole history of culture represents a diminution of this fear of chance, the uncertain, the sudden. For culture means learning to calculate, to think causally, to forestall, to believe in necessity. With the increase of culture, man can do without that primitive form of submission to ills (called religion or morality), that “justification of evil." Now he makes war on "ills"-he abolishes them. Indeed, a state is possible in which the sense of security and belief in law and calculability enter consciousness in the form of satiety and disgust--while the delight in chance, the uncertain and sudden becomes titillating.

Let us dwell a moment on this symptom of highest culture I call it the pessimism of strength, Man no longer needs a "justifi cation of ills"; "justification" is precisely what he abhors: he enjoys ills pur, cru; he finds senseless ills the most interesting. If he formerly had need of a god, he now takes delight in a world disorder without God, a world of chance, to whose essence belong the terrible, the ambiguous, the seductive.

In such a state it is precisely the good that needs "justifying," i.e., it must be founded in evil and danger or involve some great stupidity: then it still pleases. Animality no longer arouses horror; esprit and happy exuberance in favor of the animal in man is in such ages the most triumphant form of spirituality. Man is now strong enough to be ashamed of any faith in God: he may again play the advocatus diaboli. If he in praxi advocates the preservation of virtue, he does it for reasons that recognize in virtue a subtlety, a cunning, a form of lust for gain and power.

This pessimism of strength also ends in a theodicy, i.e., in an absolute affirmation of the world—but for the very reasons that formerly led one to deny it—and in this fashion to a conception of this world as the actually-achieved highest possible ideal.

1020 (Nov. 1887-March 1888) The chief kinds of pessimism:

THE WILL TO POWER

the pessimism of sensibility (excessive irritability with a

preponderance of unpleasurable feelings); the pessimism of "unfree will" (in other words: a lack of

strength in resisting stimuli); the pessimism of doubt (a distaste for everything firm, for

all grasping and touching).

The psychological states proper to these can all be observed in the madhouse, even if in a somewhat exaggerated form. Also "nihilism" (the penetrating feeling of -"nothingness").

But where does the moral pessimism of Pascal belong? the metaphysical pessimism of the Vedanta philosophy? the social pessimism of the anarchists (or of Shelley)? the pessimism of sympathy (like that of Leo Tolstoy, Alfred de Vigny)?

Are all these not likewise phenomena of decay and sickness? To give excessive weight to moral values or to fictions of the "beyond" or to social distress or to suffering in general: every such exaggeration of a narrow viewpoint is in itself already a sign of sickness. Likewise the preponderance of No over Yes!

What must not be confused with all this: pleasure in saying No and doing No out of a tremendous strength and tension derived from saying Yes-peculiar to all rich and powerful men and ages. A luxury, as it were; also a form of bravery that opposes the terrible; a sympathetic feeling for the terrible and questionable because one is, among other things, terrible and questionable: the Dionysian in will, spirit, taste.

2. My recognition and identification of the traditional ideal, the Christian, even where the dogmatic form of Christianity has been abandoned. The dangerousness of the Christian ideal lies in its value feelings, in that which can do without conceptual expression: my struggle against latent Christianity (e.g., in music, in socialism).

3. My struggle against the eighteenth century of Rousseau,

against his "nature," his "good man," his belief in the dominion of feeling—against the softening, weakening, moralization of man: an ideal born of hatred for aristocratic culture; in praxi, the dominion of the feelings of unbridled ressentiment, devised as a banner for the struggle (the morality of guilt feelings of the Christian, the morality of ressentiment a posture of the mob).

4. My struggle against romanticism, in which Christian ideals and the ideals of Rousseau unite, but compounded with a nostalgia for the old days of priestly-aristocratic culture, for virtù, for the "strong human being" something extremely hybrid; a false and impersonated strong humanity that values extreme states in general and sees in them a symptom of strength ("cult of passion"; an imitation of the most expressive forms, furore espressivo, not out of plenitude but out of a lack).- (What in the nineteenth century is born of a relative plenitude, with gusto: cheerful music, etc.; among poets, e.g., Stifter and Gottfried Keller are signs of greater strength, inner well-being, than- Grand technique and inventiveness, the natural sciences, history (?)80. products of relative strength, self-confidence of the nineteenth century.)

5. My struggle against the predominance of the herd instincts now that science makes common cause with them; against the inward hatred with which every kind of order of rank and distance are treated.

1022 (Spring 1887-March 1888) From the pressure of plenitude, from the tension of forces that continually increase in us and do not yet know how to discharge themselves, there arises a condition like that preceding a storm: the nature we constitute becomes dark. This, too, is "pessimism"

A doctrine that puts an end to such a condition by command ing something or other—a revaluation of values by virtue of which the accumulated forces are shown a way, a whither, so they explode into lightning flashes and deeds-certainly does not need to be a doctrine of happiness: by releasing force that had been com pressed and dammed to the point of torment it brings happiness.

To press everything terrible into service, one by one, step by step, experimentally: this is what the task of culture demands; but until it is strong enough for this, it must oppose, moderate, veil, even curse all this,

Everywhere that a culture posits evil, it gives expression to a relationship of fear, thus a weakness,

Thesis: everything good is the evil of former days made serviceable. Standard: the greater and more terrible the passions are that an age, a people, an individual can permit themselves, because they are capable of employing them as means, the higher stands their culture;&1 the more mediocre, the weaker, the more submissive and cowardly a man is, the more he will posit as evil: it is with him that the realm of evil is most comprehensive. The basest man will see the realm of evil (i.e., of that which is for bidden and hostile to him) everywhere.

The most powerful man, the creator, would have to be the most evil, in as much as he carries his ideal against the ideals of other men and remakes them in his own image. Evil here means: hard, painful, enforced.

Such men as Napoleon must come again and again and con firm the belief in the autocracy of the individual; but he himself was corrupted by the means he had to employ and lost noblesse of character. If he had had to prevail among a different kind of man he could have employed other means; and it would thus not

seem to be a necessity for a Caesar to become bad.

1027 (Spring-Fall 1887)

Man is beast and superbeast;82 the higher man is inhuman and superhuman: these belong together. With every increase of great ness and height in man, there is also an increase in depth and terribleness: one ought not to desire the one without the other or rather: the more radically one desires the one, the more radically one achieves precisely the other.

1028 (Spring-Fall 1887)

Terribleness is part of greatness: let us not deceive ourselves.

1029 (1884-1886)

I have presented such terrible images to knowledge that any "Epicurean delight" is out of the question. Only Dionysian joy is sufficient: I have been the first to discover the tragic.88 The Greeks, thanks to their moralistic superficiality, misunderstood it. Even

"Unrier und Ubertier. Cf. the note to section 877 above, for a passage in which Nietzsche calls Napoleon "this synthesis of the inhuman and superhuman"-Unmensch und Ubermensch, Ubertier is strictly analagous to Ubermensch, overman, and is a coinage. Untier is an established German word and means monster, beast.

83 This may sound so mad that few if any readers will understand what Nietzsche means. Plato's and Aristotle's approaches to tragedy were moralistic, and they failed to understand tragedy; so did Schopenhauer and, in various ways, others who wrote about it. Nietzsche's suggestion, first offered in The Birth of Tragedy, at the very end of section 7, is that tragedy is born of an insight into the utter terror and absurdity of existence and of a despair so profound that only the sublime beauty of the great tragedies can engender a "Dionysian joy . . . sufficient" to save man.

resignation is not a lesson of tragedy, but a misunderstanding of it! Yearning for nothingness is a denial of tragic wisdom, its opposite!

1030 (1883-1888) A full and powerful soul not only copes with painful, even terrible losses, deprivations, robberies, insults; it emerges from such hells with a greater fullness and powerfulness; and, most essential of all, with a new increase in the blissfulness of love. I believe that he who has divined something of the most basic conditions for this growth in love will understand what Dante meant when he wrote over the gate of his Inferno: "I, too, was created by eternal love."84

1031 (Spring-Fall 1887)

To explore the whole sphere of the modern soul, to have sat in its every nook-my ambition, my torture, and my happiness.

Really to overcome pessimism-a Goethean eye full of love and good will as the result,

1032 (1883-1885) 86

The first question is by no means whether we are content with ourselves, but whether we are content with anything at all.86 If we affirm one single moment, we thus affirm not only ourselves but all existence.87 For nothing is self-sufficient, neither in us our selves nor in things, and if our soul has trembled with happiness and sounded like a harp string just once, all eternity was needed

It is doubtful that this section really helps us to "understand what Dante meant," or that it is very well considered; after all, it is a mere note and was not embodied in a book. But the point seems to be that there is an ultimate connection between the most terrible suffering and the best love.

to produce this one event and in this single moment of affirmation all eternity was called good, redeemed, justified, and affirmed.

1033 (March-June 1888) The affirmative affects: pride, joy, health, love of the sexes, enmity and war, reverence, beautiful gestures and manners, 98 strong will, the discipline of high spirituality, will to power, gratitude toward earth and life-everything that is rich and desires to bestow and that replenishes and gilds and immortalizes and deifies life-the whole force of transfiguring virtues, every thing that declares good and affirms in word and deed.

We few or many who again dare to live in a dismoralized world, we pagans in faith: we are probably also the first to grasp what a pagan faith is: - to have to imagine higher creatures than man, but beyond good and evil; to have to consider all being higher as also being immoral. We believe in Olympus--and not in the "Crucified.”

1035 (Spring-Fall 1887; rev. Spring-Fall 1888)

Latter-day man has employed his power of idealization in regard to a god chiefly to make the god more and more moral. What does that signify?—Nothing good, a diminution of the strength of man.

For in itself the opposite would be possible; and there are indications of this. God conceived as an emancipation from morality, taking into himself the whole fullness of life's antitheses and, in a divine torment, redeeming and justifying them: God as the beyond and above of the wretched loafers' morality of "good and evil."

1037 (Spring-Fall 1887)

Let us remove supreme goodness from the concept of God: it is unworthy of a god. Let us also remove supreme wisdom; it is the vanity of philosophers that is to be blamed for this mad notion of God as a monster of wisdom; he had to be as like them as possible. No! God the supreme power---that suffices! Every thing follows from it, "the world" follows from it!

-And how many new gods are still possible! As for myself, in whom the religious, that is to say god-forming, instinct occasion ally becomes active at impossible times---how differently, how variously the divine has revealed itself to me each time!

So many strange things have passed before me in those time less moments that fall into one's life as if from the moon, when one no longer has any idea how old one is or how young one will yet be—I should not doubt that there are many kinds of gods There are some one cannot imagine without a certain halcyon and frivolous quality in their make-up Perhaps light feet are even an integral part of the concept "god"- Is it necessary to elaborate that a god prefers to stay beyond everything bourgeois and rational? and, between ourselves, also beyond good and evil?

1039 (March-June 1888)

And how many new ideals are, at bottom, still possible! Here is a little ideal I stumble upon once every five weeks on a wild and lonely walk, in an azure moment of sinful happiness. To spend one's life amid delicate and absurd things; a stranger to reality; half an artist, half a bird and metaphysician; with no care for reality, except now and then to acknowledge it in the manner of a good dancer with the tips of one's toes; always tickled by some sunray of happiness; exuberant and encouraged even by misery-for misery preserves the happy man; fixing a little humorous tail even to the holiest things: this, as is obvious, is the ideal of a heavy, hundredweight spirit-a spirit of gravity.

From the soul's school of war 02 (Dedicated to the brave, the cheerful, the temperate.)

I should not like to undervalue the amiable virtues; but greatness of soul is not compatible with them. Even in the arts, the grand style excludes the pleasing.

My new path to a "Yes".- Philosophy, as I have hitherto understood and lived it, is a voluntary quest for even the most detested and notorious93 sides of existence. From the long ex perience I gained from such a wandering through ice and wilder ness, I learned to view differently all that had hitherto philoso phized: the hidden history of philosophy, the psychology of its great names, came to light for me. "How much truth can a spirit endure, how much truth does a spirit dare?"—this became for me the real standard of value, 94 Error is cowardice every achieve ment of knowledge is a consequence of courage, of severity toward oneself, of cleanliness toward oneself Such an experimental philosophy as I live anticipates experimentally even the possibilities of the most fundamental nihilism; but this does not mean that it must halt at a negation, a No, a will to negation. It wants rather to cross over to the opposite of this to a Dionysian affirmation of the world as it is, without subtraction, exception, or selection—it wants the eternal circulation: the same things, the same logic and illogic of entanglements. The highest state a philosopher can attain: to stand in a Dionysian relationship to existence--my for mula for this is amor fati.95

It is part of this state to perceive not merely the necessity of those sides of existence hitherto denied, but their desirability; and not their desirability merely in relation to the sides hitherto affirmed (perhaps as their complement or precondition), but for

537 their own sake, as the more powerful, more fruitful, truer sides of existence, in which its will finds clearer expression.

It is also part of this state to depreciate that side of existence which alone has been affirmed hitherto; to perceive the origin of this valuation and how little a Dionysian value standard for existence is obliged to it: I pulled up and perceived what it really was that here affirmed (on one hand, the instinct of the suffering; on the other the instinct of the herd; and thirdly, the instinct of the majority against the exceptions...).

Thus I guessed to what extent a stronger type of man would necessarily have to conceive the elevation and enhancement of man as taking place in another direction: higher beings, beyond good and evil, beyond those values which cannot deny their origin in the sphere of suffering, the herd, and the majority--I sought in history the beginnings of this construction of reverse ideals (the concepts "pagan," "classical," "noble" newly discovered and expounded).

The most spiritual men feel the stimulus and charm of sensuous things in a way that other men—those with "fleshly

1. We want to hold fast to our senses and to our faith in them—and think their consequences through to the end! The nonsensuality of philosophy hitherto as the greatest nonsensicality of man.

3. Our valuations are a part of this building; they em phasize and underline. Of what significance is it if entire religions say: "all is bad and false and evil"! This condemnation of the entire process can only be a judgment of the ill-constituted!

4. To be sure, the ill-constituted can be the greatest sufferers and the most subtle? The contented could be of little value?

Dionysus: sensuality and cruelty. Transitoriness could be interpreted as enjoyment of productive and destructive force, as continual creation.

1050 (March-June 1888)

The word "Dionysian" means: an urge to unity, a reaching out beyond personality, the everyday, society, reality, across the abyss of transitoriness: a passionate-painful overflowing into darker, fuller, more floating states; an ecstatic affirmation of the total character of life as that which remains the same, just as powerful, just as blissful, through all change; the great pantheistic sharing of joy and sorrow that sanctifies and calls good even the most terrible and questionable qualities of life; the eternal will to procreation, to fruitfulness, to recurrence; the feeling of the necessary unity of creation and destruction.

The world "Apollinian" means: the urge to perfect self sufficiency, to the typical "individual," to all that simplifies, dis stinguishes, makes strong, clear, unambiguous, typical: freedom under the law.

The further development of art is as necessarily tied to the antagonism between these two natural artistic powers as the further development of man is to that between the sexes. Plenitude of power and moderation, the highest form of self-affirmation in a cool, noble, severe beauty: the Apollinianism of the Hellenic will.

This antithesis of the Dionysian and the Apollinian within the Greek soul is one of the great riddles to which I felt myself drawn when considering the nature of the Greeks. Fundamentally I was concerned with nothing except to guess why precisely Greek Apollinianism had to grow out of a Dionysian subsoil;

The highest and most illustrious human joys, in which exist ence celebrates its own transfiguration, come, as is reasonable, only to the rarest and best-constituted men; and even to these only when they themselves and their ancestors have lived long, preparatory lives directed to this goal, and not even in the knowledge of this goal. Then an overflowing wealth of the most multifarious forces and the most dextrous power of "free willing" and lordly command dwell amicably together in one man; the spirit is then as much at home in the senses as the senses are at home in the spirit; and whatever takes place in the spirit must enkindle a subtle extraordinary happiness and play in the senses. And also the other way around! Consider this reverse process in the case of Hafiz; even Goethe, however much more faintly, gives us an idea of this occurrence. It is probable that with such perfect and well-constituted men the most sensual functions are finally transfigured by a symbol-intoxication of the highest spiri tuality: they experience a kind of deification of the body in them selves and are as distant as possible from the ascetic philosophy of the proposition "God is a spirit"—and this shows clearly that

* Nietzsche first introduced the contrast of the Dionysian and Apollinian in The Birth of Tragedy, his first book. In his later works there are relatively few references to the Apollinian, and the Dionysian comes to be contrasted more and more with the Christian, as in section 1,052 below. The spirit of these two juxtapositions is not at all the same, and the conception of the Dionysian changes accordingly. In the former contrast, neither element is given preference: note, e.g., the penultimate paragraph of section 1,050. In the later contrast, Nietzscbe uses Dionysus as the symbol of his own world view.

These reflections on The Birth of Tragedy-apparently in connection with the section on that book in Ecce Homo help our understanding of Nietzsche's first work.

BOOK FOUR: Discipline and Breeding the ascetic is the "ill-constituted man," who calls good only a something-in-itself, and indeed a something that judges and con demns--and also calls it "God."

From that height of joy where man feels himself to be altogether a deified form and a self-justification of nature, down to the joy of healthy peasants and healthy half-human animals, this whole, long, tremendous light and color scale of happiness, the Greeks, not without the grateful shudder of him who is initiated into a mystery, not without much caution and pious silence, called by the divine name: Dionysus.- What do any latter-day men, the children of a fragmentary, multifarious, sick, strange age, know of the range of Greek happiness; what could they know of it! Whence would the slaves of "modem ideas" derive a right to Dionysian festivals!

When the Greek body and the Greek soul "bloomed," and not in conditions of morbid exaltation and madness, there arose that mysterious symbol of the highest world-affirmation and trans figuration of existence that has yet been attained on earth. Here we have a standard by which everything that has grown up since is found too short, too poor, too narrow. One only needs to pronounce the word "Dionysus" in the presence of the best latter day names and things, in the presence of Goethe perhaps, or Beethoven, or Shakespeare, or Raphael-at once we feel that our best things and moments have been judged. Dionysus is a judge! - Have I been understood?

There can be no doubt that the Greeks sought to interpret the ultimate mysteries "of the destiny of the soul" and everything they knew concerning education and purification, above all con cerning the immovable order of rank and inequality of value between man and man, on the basis of their Dionysian experi ences: here is the great depth, the great silence, in all matters Greek-one does not know the Greeks as long as this hidden subterranean entrance lies blocked. Importunate scholar's eyes will never see anything in these things, however much scholarship still has to be employed in this excavation. Even the noble zeal of such friends of antiquity as Goethe and Winckelmann here has something unpermitted, even immodest about it.

To wait and to prepare oneself; to await the emergence of new sources; to prepare oneself in solitude for strange faces and voices; to wash one's soul ever cleaner from the marketplace

THE WILL TO POWER dust and noise of this age; to overcome everything Christian through something supra-Christian, and not merely to put it aside-for the Christian doctrine was the counterdoctrine to the Dionysian; to rediscover the South in one and to spread out above one a bright, glittering, mysterious southern sky; to re conquer southern health and hidden powerfulness of soul; step by step to become more comprehensive, more supranational, more European, more Near Eastern, finally more Greek-for the Greek was the first great union and synthesis of everything Near Eastern, and on that account the inception of the European soul, the dis covery of our "new world": whover lives under such imperatives, who knows what he may not encounter one day? Perhaps a new day!

1052 (March-June 1888)

The two types: Dionysus and the Crucified.97_- To determine: whether the typical religious man [is] 98 a form of decadence (the great innovators are one and all morbid and epileptic); but are we not here omitting one type of religious man, the pagan? Is the pagan cult not a form of thanksgiving and affirmation of life? Must its highest representative not be an apology for and deifica tion of life? The type of a well-constituted and ecstatically over flowing spirit! The type of a spirito! that takes into itself and redeems the contradictions and questionable aspects of existence!

It is here I set the Dionysus of the Greeks: the religious affirmation of life, life whole and not denied or in part; (typical that the sexual act arouses profundity, mystery, 100 reverence).

Dionysus versus the "Crucified": there you have the anti

The last section of Ecce Homo reads, in full: " Have I been under stood? - Dionysus versus the Crucified ..."

* The word "is" was supplied by the German editors.

* In the MS Typus, which the German editors very sensibly changed to Geist. This does not mean that the MS reads: "The type of a type"; the whole clause that follows "spirit" appears in the German original between

Typus and Typus, which makes the slip readily understandable.

100 The reading of "mystery" is uncertain; but see section 148 above. The same idea is found in The Birth of Tragedy, at the beginning of section 8, and above all in section 4 of the last chapter of Twilight (Portable Nietzsche, p. 561 f). But Aristophanes and some Greek vase paintings sug gest a somewhat different perspective.

BOOK FOUR: Discipline and Breeding thesis. It is not a difference in regard to their martyrdom-it is a difference in the meaning of it. Life itself, its eternal fruitfulness and recurrence, creates torment, destruction, the will to annihila tion. In the other case, suffering the "Crucified as the innocent one"-counts as an objection to this life, as a formula for its condemnation. One will see that the problem is that of the meaning of suffering: whether a Christian meaning or a tragic meaning. In the former case, it is supposed to be the path to a holy existence; in the latter case, being is counted as holy enough to justify even a monstrous amount of suffering. The tragic man affirms even the harshest suffering: he is sufficiently strong, rich, and capable of deifying to do so. The Christian denies even the happiest lot on earth: he is sufficiently weak, poor, disinherited to suffer from life in whatever form he meets it. The god on the cross is a curse on101 life, a signpost to seek redemption from life; Dionysus cut to pieces is a promise of life: it will be eternally reborn and return again from destruction, 102

101 In the MS the definite article, needed in German before "life," is missing, but it was added by the German editors and appears in all editions.

In sum: this section is in many ways typical of the whole book. It was written in extreme haste, and it would be an understatement to say that it was not polished for publication; but for all that it is remarkable as a document that aids our understanding of Nietzsche, as a prose passage, and for the ideas it expresses.

Schlechta's edition, as usual, does not follow the MS but the standard editions, ignoring the information furnished in 1911 (p. 514 in this case).

III. THE ETERNAL RECURRENCE

1053 (1884)

My philosophy brings the triumphant idea of which all other modes of thought will ultimately perish. It is the great cultivating idea: the races that cannot bear it stand condemned; those who find it the greatest benefit are chosen to rule.

1054 (1885-1886)

The greatest of struggles: for this a new weapon is needed.

The hammer: to provoke a fearful decision, to confront Europe with the consequences: whether its will "wills" destruction.

Prevention of reduction to mediocrity. Rather destruction!

1055 (1885)

A pessimistic teaching and way of thinking, an ecstatic nihilism, can under certain conditions be indispensable precisely to the philosopher—as a mighty pressure and hammer with which he breaks and removes degenerate and decaying races to make way for a new order of life, or to implant into that which is degenerate and desires to die a longing for the end.

1056 (1884)

b) Means of disposing of it. 4. Its place in history as a mid-point.

Period of greatest danger. Foundation of an oligarchy above peoples and their interests:

education to a universally human politics. Counterpart of Jesuitism.

1058 (1883-1888)

The two greatest philosophical points of view (devised by Germans):

a) that of becoming, of development, b) that according to the value of existence (but the

wretched form of German pessimism must first be overcomel)—both brought together my me in a de

cisive way. Everything becomes and recurs eternally- escape is im possible. Supposing we could judge value, what follows? The idea of recurrence as a selective principle, in the service of strength (and barbarism!!).

Ripeness of man for this idea.

1059 (1884) 1. The idea (of the eternal recurrence):104 the presuppositions that would have to be true if it were true. Its consequences.

2. As the hardest idea: its probable effect if it were not prevented, i.e., if all values were not revalued.

3. Means of enduring it: the revaluation of all values. No longer joy in certainty but in uncertainty; no longer "cause and effect" but the continually creative; no longer will to preservation but to power; no longer the humble expression, "everything is merely subjective," but "it is also our work! Let us be proud of

it!

1060 (1884)

To endure the idea of the recurrence one needs: freedom from morality; new means against the fact of pain (pain con

ceived as a tool, as the father of pleasure; there is no cumulative consciousness of displeasure); the enjoyment of all kinds of un certainty, experimentalism, as a counterweight to this extreme fatalism; abolition of the concept of necessity; abolition of the "will"; abolition of "knowledge-in-itself."

Greatest elevation of the consciousness of strength in man, as he creates the overman.

1061 (1887-1888)

The two most extreme modes of thought the mechanistic and the Platonic-are reconciled in the eternal recurrence: both as ideals.

1062 (1885)

If the world had a goal, it must have been reached. If there were for it some unintended final state, this also must have been reached. If it were in any way capable of a pausing and becoming fixed, of "being," if in the whole course of its becoming it possessed even for a moment this capability of "being," then all becoming would long since have come to an end, along with all thinking, all "spirit." The fact of "spirit" as a form of becoming proves that the world has no goal, no final state, and is incapable of being.

The old habit, however, of associating a goal with every event and a guiding, creative God with the world, is so power ful that it requires an effort for a thinker not to fall into thinking of the very aimlessness of the world as intended. This notion that the world intentionally avoids a goal and even knows artifices for keeping itself from entering into a circular course--must occur to all those who would like to force on the world the ability for eternal novelty, i.e., on a finite, definite, unchangeable force of constant size, such as the world is, the miraculous power of infinite novelty in its forms and states. The world, even if it is no longer a god, is still supposed to be capable of the divine power of creation, the power of infinite transformations; it is supposed to consciously prevent itself from returning to any of its old forms; it is supposed to possess not only the intention but the means of avoiding any repetition; to that end, it is supposed to control every one of its movements at every moment so as to escape goals, final

547 states, repetitions- and whatever else may follow from such an unforgiveably insane way of thinking and desiring. It is still the old religious way of thinking and desiring, a kind of longing to believe that in some way the world is after all like the old beloved, infinite, boundlessly creative God--that in some way "the old God still lives" that longing of Spinoza which was expressed in the words "deus sive natura”:05 (he even felt "natura sive deus").

What, then, is the law and belief with which the decisive change, the recently attained preponderance of the scientific spirit over the religious, God-inventing spirit, is most clearly formulated? Is it not: the world, as force, may not be thought of as unlimited, for it cannot be so thought of; we forbid ourselves the concept of an infinite force as incompatible with the concept "force." Thus ---the world also lacks the capacity for eternal novelty.

1063 (1886-1887)

The law of the conservation of energy demands eternal recur

rence.

1064 (1885)

That a state of equilibrium is never reached proves that it is not possible. But in an indefinite space it would have to have been reached. Likewise in a spherical space. The shape of space must be the cause of eternal movement, and ultimately of all "imperfection."

That "force" and "rest," "remaining the same," contradict one another. The measure of force (as magnitude) as fixed, but its essence in flux.106

"Timelessness" to be rejected. At any precise moment of a force, the absolute conditionality of a new distribution of all its forces is given: it cannot stand still. "Change" belongs to the essence, therefore also temporality: with this, however, the neces sity of change has only been posited once more conceptually.

all things so as not to take them too seriously and to live at peace among them. To me, on the contrary, everything seems far too valuable to be so fleeting: I seek an eternity for everything: ought one to pour the most precious salves and wines into the sea?-- My consolation is that everything that has been is eternal: the

sea will cast it up again.

1066 (March-June 1888)

The new world-conception. The world exists; it is not something that becomes, not something that passes away. Or rather: it becomes, it passes away, but it has never begun to become and never ceased from passing away-it maintains itself in both. It lives on itself: its excrements are its food.

We need not worry for a moment about the hypothesis of a created world. The concept "create" is today completely indefin able,107 unrealizable; merely a word, a rudimentary survival from the ages of superstition; one can explain nothing with a mere word. The last attempt to conceive a world that had a beginning has lately been made several times with the aid of logical pro cedures generally, as one may divine, with an ulterior theological motive.

Lately one has sought several times to find a contradiction in the concept "temporal infinity of the world in the past" (regressus in infinitum): one has even found it, although at the cost of confusing the head with the tail. Nothing can prevent me from reckoning backward from this moment and saying "I shall never reach the end"; just as I can reckon forward from the same moment into the infinite. Only if I made the mistake-I shall guard against it—of equating this correct concept of a regressus in infinitum with an utterly unrealizable concept of a finite progres sus up to this present, only if I suppose that the direction (forward or backward) is logically a matter of indifference, would I take the head--this moment--for the tail; I shall leave that to you, my dear Herr Dühring!

I have come across this idea in earlier thinkers: every time it was determined by other ulterior considerations (mostly theological, in favor of the creator spiritus). If the world could in any way become rigid, dry, dead, nothing, or if it could reach a

state of equilibrium, or if it had any kind of goal that involved duration, immutability, the once-and-for-all (in short, speaking metaphysically: if becoming could resolve itself into being or into nothingness), then this state must have been reached. But it has not been reached: from which it follows

This is the sole certainty we have in our hands to serve as a corrective to a great host of world hypotheses possible in them seves. If, e.g., the mechanistic theory cannot avoid the conse quence, drawn for it by William Thomson,108 of leading to a final state, then the mechanistic theory stands refuted.

If the world may be thought of as a certain definite quantity of force and as a certain definite number of centers of force-and every other representation remains indefinite and therefore useless -it follows that, in the great dice game of existence, it must pass through a calculable number of combinations. In infinite time, every possible combination would at some time or another be realized, more: it would be realized an infinite number of times. And since between every combination and its next recurrence all other possible combinations would have to take place, and each of these combinations conditions the entire sequence of combina tions in the same series, a circular movement of absolutely identical series is thus demonstrated; the world as a circular movement that has already repeated itself infinitely often and plays its game in infinitum.

This conception is not simply a mechanistic conception; for if it were that, it would not condition an infinite recurrence of identical cases, but a final state. Because the world has not reached this, mechanistic theory must be considered an imperfect and merely provisional hypothesis.

THE WILL TO POWER

it to you in my mirror? This world: a monster of energy, without beginning, without end; a firm, iron magnitude of force that does not grow bigger or smaller, that does not expend itself but only transforms itself; as a whole, of unalterable size, a household with out expenses or losses, but likewise without increase or income; enclosed by "nothingness" as by a boundary; not something blurry or wasted, not something endlessly extended, but set in a definite space as a definite force, and not a space that might be "empty" here or there, but rather as force throughout, as a play of forces and waves of forces, at the same time one and many, increasing here and at the same time decreasing there; a sea of forces flow ing and rushing together, eternally changing, eternally flooding back, with tremendous years of recurrence, with an ebb and a flood of its forms; out of the simplest forms striving toward the most complex, out of the stillest, most rigid, coldest forms toward the hottest, most turbulent, most self-contradictory, and then again returning home to the simple out of this abundance, out of the play of contradictions back to the joy of concord, still affirm ing itself in this uniformity of its courses and its years, blessing itself as that which must return eternally, as a becoming that knows no satiety, no disgust, no weariness: this, my Dionysian world of the eternally self-creating, the eternally self-destroying, this mystery world of the twofold voluptuous delight, my "beyond good and evil," without goal, unless the joy of the circle is itself a goal; without will, unless a ring feels good will toward itself-do you want a name for this world? A solution for all its riddles? A light for you, too, you best-concealed, strongest, most intrepid, most midnightly men? - This world is the will to power and nothing besides!
