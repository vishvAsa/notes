CRITIQUE OF THE HIGHEST VALUES HITHERTO



## 1 CRITIQUE OF RELIGION

All the beauty and sublimity we have bestowed upon real and imaginary things I will reclaim as the property and product of man: as his fairest apology. Man as poet, as thinker, as God, as love, as power: with what regal liberality he has lavished gifts upon things so as to impoverish himself and make himself feel wretched! His most unselfish act hitherto has been to admire and worship and to know how to conceal from himself that it was he who created what he admired.?



### 1. Genesis of Religions

135 (March-June 1888)

On the origin of religion. In the same way as today the un educated man believes that anger is the cause of his being angry, spirit the cause of his thinking, soul the cause of his feeling--in short, just as there is still thoughtlessly posited a mass of psy chological entities that are supposed to be causes--so, at a yet more naive stage, man explained precisely the same phenomena with the aid of psychological personal entities. Those conditions that seemed to him strange, thrilling, overwhelming, he interpreted as obsession and enchantment by the power of a person. (Thus the Christian, the most naive and backward species of man today, traces hope, repose, the feeling of "redemption," back to psy chological inspiration by God: to him, as an essentially suffering and disturbed type, the feeling of happiness, resignation and repose naturally seems strange and in need of explanation.) Among intelligent, strong, and vigorous races it is mainly the epileptic who inspires the conviction that a strange power is here at work; but every related condition of subjection, e.g., that of the inspired man, of the poet, of the great criminal, of passions such as love and revenge, also leads to the invention of extra

 human powers. A condition is made concrete in a person, and when it overtakes us is thought to be effected by that person. In other words: In the psychological concept of God, a condition, in order to appear as effect, is personified as cause.

The psychological logic is this: When a man is suddenly and overwhelmingly suffused with the feeling of power and this is what happens with all great affects-it raises in him a doubt about his own person; he does not dare to think himself the cause of this astonishing feeling--and so he posits a stronger person, a divinity, to account for it.

In sumima: the origin of religion lies in extreme feelings of power which, because they are strange, take men by surprise: and like a sick man who, feeling one of his limbs uncommonly heavy, comes to the conclusion another man is lying on top of him, the naive homo religiosus divides himself into several persons. Religion is a case of "altération de la personalité." A sort of feel ing of fear and terror at oneself. But also a feeling of extraor dinary happiness and exaltation- Among the sick the feeling of health is sufficient to inspire belief in God, in the nearness of God.

136 (March-June 1888)

Rudimentary psychology of the religious man:- All changes are effects; all effects are effects of will (-the concept "nature," "law of nature" is lacking); all effects suppose an agent. Rudi mentary psychology: one is a cause oneself only when one knows that one has performed an act of will.

Result: when man experiences the conditions of power, the imputation is that he is not their cause, that he is not responsible for them: they come without being willed, consequently we are not their author: the will that is not free (i.e., the consciousness that we have been changed without having willed it) needs an external will.

Consequence: man has not dared to credit himself with all his strong and surprising impulseshe has conceived them as "passive," as "suffered," as things imposed upon him: religion is the product of a doubt concerning the unity of the person, an altération of the personality: in so far as everything great and

BOOK TWO: Critique of Highest Values strong in man has been conceived as superhuman and external, man has belittled himself-he has separated the two sides of him self, one very paltry and weak, one very strong and astonishing, into two spheres, and called the former "man," the latter "God."

He has continued to think in this way; in the period of the moral idiosyncrasy he did not interpret his exalted and sublime moral states as "willed," as "work" of the person. The Christian too divides his person into a mean and weak fiction which he calls man, and another which he calls God (redeemer, savior)

Religion has debased the concept "man"; its ultimate con sequence is that everything good, great, true is superhuman and bestowed only through an act of grace

137 (March-June 1888)

One way of raising man from the abasement produced by the subtraction of exalted and strong states as foreign conditions was the family theory. These exalted and strong states could at least be interpreted as the influence of our ancestors; we belonged together, in solidarity; we grow greater in our own eyes when we act according to a norm known to us.

Attempt by noble families to square religion with the feeling of their own worth. Poets and seers do the same; they feel proud, honored, and chosen for such an association--they attach great importance to not being considered at all as individuals, but merely as mouthpieces (Homer).

Step by step man takes possession of his exalted and proud states, he takes possession of his acts and works. Formerly one believed one was doing oneself an honor by denying responsibility for one's highest acts and attributing them to God. Absence of free will counted as that which imparted a higher value to an action: a god was conceived as its author.*

138 (1883-1888) Priests are the actors of something superhuman which they have to make easily perceptible, whether it be in the nature of

"In the MS this section is entitled "A form of religion for establishing human pride." And the MS version also contains the following sentence, crossed out by Nietzsche: "Another form of religion. The god elects, the god becomes man, and god dwells among men and leaves behind great benefactions. The local legend, eternally represented as "drama.""



(p88)



 ideals, gods, or saviors: in this they find their calling, for this their instincts serve them; to make everything as believable as possible they have to go as far as possible in posturing and posing; the shrewdness of their actor's art must above all aim at giving them a good conscience, by means of which alone is it possible to carry true conviction.

139 (March-June 1888)

The priest wants to have it understood that he counts as the highest type of man, that he rules-even over those who wield power--that he is indispensable, unassailable—that he is the strongest power in the community, absolutely not to be replaced or undervalued.

Means:5 he alone possesses knowledge; he alone possesses virtue; he alone has sovereign lordship over himself; he alone is in a certain sense God and goes back to the divinity; he alone is the intermediary between God and other people; the divinity punishes every opposition to, every thought directed against a priest.

Means: truth exists. There is only one way of attaining it: to become a priest. Everything good in society, in nature, in tra dition, is to be traced back to the wisdom of the priests. The holy book is their work. The whole of nature is only a fulfillment of the dogmas contained in it. There is no other source of the good than the priests. Every other kind of excellence is of a different order from that of the priest; e.g., that of the warrior.

Consequence: if the priest is to be the highest type, then the degrees which lead to his virtues must constitute the degrees of value among men. Study, emancipation from the senses, the non active, the impassible, absence of affects, the solemn; antithesis: the lowest order of man.

The priest has taught one kind of morality: in order that he shall be considered the highest type of man. He conceives an antithetical type: the chandala. To make these contemptible by every means provides a foil to the order of castes. The priest's extreme fear of sensuality is also conditioned by the insight that this is the most serious threat to the order of castes (that is, to order, in general) - Every "more liberal tendency" in puncto puncti throws the marriage laws overboard

Mittel, i.e., means in the sense of instrument.

(p140) (March-June 1888)

The philosopher as a further development of the priestly type:- has the heritage of the priest in his blood; is compelled, even as rival, to struggle for the same ends with the same means as the priest of his time; he aspires to supreme authority.

What gives authority when one does not have physical power in one's hands (no army, no weapons of any kind-)? How, in fact, does one gain authority over those who possess physical strength and authority? (They compete with the awe inspired by princes, by the victorious conqueror, by the wise statesman).

Only by arousing the belief that they have in their hands a higher, mightier strength-God. Nothing is sufficiently strong: the mediation and service of the priests is needed. They establish themselves as indispensable intermediaries: they need as condi tions of their existence: (1) belief in the absolute superiority of their God, belief in their God; (2) that there is no other, no direct access to God. The second demand alone creates the concept "heterodoxy," the first the concept "unbeliever" (i.e., one who believes in another God--).

141° (Jan-Fall 1888)

Critique of the holy lie. That the lie is permitted as a means to pious ends is part of the theory of every priesthood—to what extent it is part of their practice is the object of this inquiry.

But philosophers too, as soon as, with priestly ulterior mo tives, they form the intention of taking in hand the direction of mankind, at once also arrogate to themselves the right to tell lies: Plato before all. The most imposing is the twofold lie developed by the typically Aryan philosophers of the Vedanta: two systems contradictory in all their main features but for educational reasons alternating, supplementary and complementary. The lie of the one is intended to create a condition in which alone the truth of the other can become audible

How far does the pious lie of priests and philosophers go? — One must ask what presuppositions they require for the purpose

Sections 141-43 were utilized in the chapter on "The 'Improvers' of Mankind" in Twilight (Portable Nietzsche).



(p90)





of education, what dogmas they have to invent to satisfy these presuppositions.

First: they must have power, authority, unconditional credi bility on their side.

Secondly: they must have the whole course of nature in their hands, so that everything that affects the individual seems to be conditioned by their laws.

Thirdly: they must also possess a more extensive domain of power whose control eludes the eyes of its subjects: power of punishment in the beyond, in the after death"_and of course the means of discovering the way to bliss.

-They have to set aside the concept of a natural course of events: but since they are clever and thoughtful people they are able to promise a host of effects, conditioned, of course, by prayers or the strict observance of their laws.— They can, moreover, prescribe a host of things that are absolutely reasonable-provided only that they do not point to experience or empiricism as the source of this wisdom, but to revelation or the consequence of "the sternest penances."

The holy lie therefore applies principally: to the purpose of an action (--natural purpose, reason are made to vanish: a moral purpose, the fulfillment of a law, a service to God appears as purpose-): to the consequence of an action ( natural conse quence is interpreted as supernatural and, to produce a surer effect, the prospect of other, uncontrollable consequences is held out).

In this way a concept of good and evil is created that seems to be altogether divorced from the natural concept "useful," "harmful," "life-promoting," "life-retarding"—in so far as another life is imagined, it can even be directly inimical to the natural concept of good and evil.

In this way the famous "conscience" is at last created: an inner voice which does not measure the value of every action with regard to its consequences, but with regard to its intention and the degree to which this intention conforms with the "laws."

The holy lie therefore invented (1) a God who punishes and rewards, who strictly observes the law-book of the priests and is strict about sending them into the world as his mouthpieces and plenipotentiaries; (2) an afterlife in which the great punishment

These numbers are not found in the MS.

(p91) machine is first thought to become effective to this end the immortality of the soul; (3) conscience in man as the conscious ness that good and evil are permanent-that God himself speaks through it when it advises conformity with priestly precepts; (4) morality as denial of all natural processes, as reduction of all events to a morally conditioned event, moral effects (i.e., the idea of punishment and reward) as effects permeating all things, as the sole power, as the creator of all transformation; (5) truth as given, as revealed, as identical with the teaching of the priests: as the condition for all salvation and happiness in this life and the next.

In summa: what is the price of moral improvement?. Un hinging of reason, reduction of all motives to fear and hope (punishment and reward); dependence upon a priestly guardian ship, upon pedantic formalities which claim to express a divine will; the implanting of a "conscience" which sets a false knowing in place of testing and experiment: as if what should be done and what left undone had already been determined—a kind of castration of the seeking and forward-striving spirit; in summa: the worst mutilation of man that can be imagined presented as the "good man."

In practice, all the reason, the whole heritage of prudence, subtlety, caution which is the presupposition of the priestly canon, is afterwards arbitrarily reduced to a mere mechanism: conformity with the law itself counts as an end, as the highest end, life no longer has any problems; the whole conception of the world is polluted by the idea of punishment; with the object of representing the priestly life as the non plus ultra of perfection, life itself is transformed into a defamation and pollution of life; the concept "God" represents a turning away from life, a critique of life, even a contempt for it; truth is transformed into the priestly lie, the striving for truth into study of the scriptures, into a means of becoming a theologian

142 (Jan-Fall 1888) Toward a critique of the law-book of Manu. The whole book is founded on the holy lie. Was the well-being of mankind the inspiration of this system? Was this species of man, who believes in the interestedness of every action, interested or not in imposing this system? To improve mankind-how is this inten tion inspired? Where is the concept of improvement derived from?

THE WILL TO POWER

We find a species of man, the priestly, which feels itself to be the norm, the high point and the supreme expression of the type man: this species derives the concept "improvement" from itself. It believes in its own superiority, it wills itself to be superior in fact: the origin of the holy lie is the will to power

Establishment of rule: to this end, the rule of those concepts that place a non plus ultra of power with the priesthood. Power through the lie in the knowledge that one does not possess it physically, militarily--the lie as a supplement to power, a new concept of "truth."

It is a mistake to suppose an unconscious and naive develop ment here, a kind of self-deception-- Fanatics do not invent such carefully thought-out systems of oppression - The most cold blooded reflection was at work here; the same kind of reflection as a Plato applied when he imagined his "Republic." "He who wills the end must will the means"-all lawgivers have been clear in their minds regarding this politician's insight.

We possess the classic model in specifically Aryan forms: we may therefore hold the best-endowed and most reflective species of man responsible for the most fundamental lie that has ever been told- That lie has been copied almost everywhere: Aryan influence has corrupted all the world8

143 (March-June 1888) A lot is said today about the Semitic spirit of the New Testa ment: but what is called Semitic is merely priestly and in the racially purest Aryan law-book, in Manu, this kind of "Semitism," i.e., the spirit of the priest, is worse than anywhere else.

The development of the Jewish priestly state is not original: they learned the pattern in Babylon: the pattern is Aryan. When, later on, the same thing became dominant in a Europe with a preponderance of Germanic blood, this was in accordance with the spirit of the ruling race: a great atavism. The Germanic Middle Ages aimed at a revival of the Aryan order of castes,

Mohammedanism in turn learned from Christianity: the em ployment of the "beyond" as an instrument of punishment.

(p93) realm of organization-was bound to invite reflection and imita tion in every respect. Again Plato: but above all the Egyptians.

144 (1885)

Moralities and religions are the principal means by which one can make whatever one wishes out of man, provided one possesses a superfluity of creative forces and can assert one's will over long periods of time--in the form of legislation, religions, and customs.

145 (1884-1888) What an affirmative Aryan religion, the product of the ruling class, looks like: the law-book of Manu. (The deification of the feeling of power in Brahma: interesting that it arose among the warrior caste and was only transferred to the priests.)

What an affirmative Semitic religion, the product of a ruling class, looks like: the law-book of Mohammed, the older parts of the Old Testament. (Mohammedanism, as a religion for men, is deeply contemptuous of the sentimentality and mendaciousness of Christianity--which it feels to be a woman's religion.)

What a negative Semitic religion, the product of an oppressed class, looks like: the New Testament (min Indian-Aryan terms: a chandala religion).

What a negative Aryan religion looks like, grown up among the ruling orders: Buddhism.

It is quite in order that we possess no religion of oppressed Aryan races, for that is a contradiction: a master race is either on top or it is destroyed.10

In itself, religion has nothing to do with morality: but both descendants of the Jewish religion are essentially moralistic re

 ligions such as offer precepts about how one ought to live, and create a hearing for their demands by rewards and punishments.

147 (Spring-Fall 1887) Pagan-Christian. The affirmation of the natural, the sense of innocence in the natural, "naturalness," is pagan. The denial of the natural, the sense of degradation in the natural, unnaturalness, is Christian.

Petronius, e.g., was "innocent": compared with this happy man, a Christian is absolutely without innocence. But since ultimately the Christian status must be merely a natural condition -which, however, dares not conceive itself to be such-"Chris tian" signifies raising to a principle the counterfeiting of psy chological interpretations

148 (1883-1886)

The Christian priest is from the first a mortal enemy of sen suality: no greather antithesis can be imagined than the innocently awed and solemn attitude adopted by, e.g., the most honorable women's cults of Athens in the presence of the symbols of sex. The act of procreation is the mystery as such in all nonascetic re ligions: a sort of symbol of perfection and of the mysterious design of the future: rebirth, immortality.

149 (1880-1881) Belief in ourselves is the strongest fetter and the supreme whipping-on-and the strongest wing. Christianity should have made the innocence of man an article of faith—men would have become gods: belief was still possible in those days. 11

Karl Schlechta omits this section in his edition because he considers the source (Werke, XI, 310) "problematical": unlike almost all of the other sections in The Will to Power, this section is not supported by a reference to Nietzsche's notebooks. And the date is much earlier.

(p151) (1885-1886)

Religions are destroyed by belief in morality. The Christian moral God is not tenable: hence “atheism"-as if there could be

no other kinds of god.

Similarly, culture is destroyed by belief in morality. For when one discovers the necessary conditions out of which alone

it can grow, one no longer wants it (Buddhism).

152 (March-June 1888) Physiology of the nihilistic religions. Each and every nihilistic religion: a systematized case history of sickness employing re ligious-moralistic nomenclature.

With pagan cults, it is around the interpretations of the great annual cycles that the cult revolves. With the Christian cult, it is around a cycle of paralytic phenomena that the cult revolves

153 (Nov, 1887-March 1888) This nihilistic religion gathers together those decadence ele ments and the like that it finds in antiquity; namely:

a. the party of the weak and ill-constituted (the refuse of the antique world: that which it thrust out most forcefully);

b. the party of the morally-obsessed and antipagan;

c. the party of the politically weary and the indifferent (blasé Romans), those without a country for whom life was emptiness;

d. the party of those who were tired of themselves who were glad to participate in a subterranean conspiracy

154 (March-June 1888) Buddha against the "Crucified." Among the nihilistic religions, one may always clearly distinguish the Christian from the Buddhist. The Buddhist religion is the expression of a fine evening, a perfect

 sweetness and mildness--it is gratitude toward all that lies behind, and also for what is lacking: bitterness, disillusionment, ran cor; finally, a lofty spiritual love; the subtleties of philosophical contradiction are behind it, even from these it is resting: but from these it still derives its spiritual glory and sunset glow. ( Origin in the highest castes--)

The Christian movement is a degeneracy movement com posed of reject and refuse elements of every kind: it is not the expression of the decline of a race, it is from the first an agglomera tion of forms of morbidity crowding together and seeking one another out- It is therefore not national, not racially conditioned; it appeals to the disinherited everywhere; it is founded on a rancor against everything well-constituted and dominant: it needs a symbol that represents a curse on the well-constituted and dominant-It also stands in opposition to every spiritual movement, to all philosophy: it takes the side of idiots 18 and utters a curse on the spirit. Rancor against the gifted, learned, spiritually independent: it detects in them the well-constituted, the masterful.

155 (Spring-Fall 1887)

In Buddhism this thought predominates: "All desires, all that produces affects and blood, draw one toward actions"-only to this extent is one warned against evil. For action has no mean ing, action biods one to existence: but all existence has no meaning. They see in evil a drive toward something illogical: to the affirma tion of means to an end one denies. They seek a way of non existence and therefore they regard with horror all affective drives. E.g., take no revenge! be no one's enemy! - The hedonism of the weary is here the supreme measure of value. Nothing is further from Buddhism than the Jewish fanaticism of a Paul: nothing would be more repellent to its instincts than this tension, fire, un Test of the religious man, above all that form of sensuality that Christianity has sanctified with the name "love," Moreover, it is the cultured and even the overspirited orders that find satisfaction in Buddhism: a race satiated and wearied by centuries of philo sophical contentions, not, however, beneath all culture, like the classes from which Christianity arose Emancipation even from good and evil appears to be of the essence of the Buddhist ideal:

(p156) (Nov. 1887-March 1888)

A nihilistic religion (like Christianity),14 sprung from and appropriate to a people grown old and tame, having outlived all strong instincts-transferred step by step to another milieu, at length entering into youthful peoples which have not yet lived at all—very curious! The bliss of the close, the fold, the evening preached to barbarians and Germans! How thoroughly all that I first had to be barbarized, Germanized! To those who had dreamed a Valhalla: who found happiness only in war!A su pramational religion preached in a chaos where no nations even existed yet

157 (Jan.-Fall 1888)

The only way to refute priests and religions is this: to show that their errors have ceased to be beneficial that they rather do harm; in short, that their own "proof of power" no longer holds good

2. History of Christianity 26

158 (1888)

One should not confuse Christianity as a historical reality with that one root that its name calls to mind: the other roots from which it has grown up have been far more powerful. It is an

"The words I have placed in brackets are not found in the MS and were added by the German editors in 1906. Although this was expressly admitted in 1911, p. 501, Schlechta, who boasts of being faithful to the MSS, follows the standard editions, as usual. The editorial emendation could be improved by omitting the bracketed words and placing at the beginning of the section: "Christianity:...."

* Most of the sections that follow were utilized in The Antichrist (Portable Nietzsche),



(p98)



 unexampled misuse of words when such manifestations of decay and abortions as "Christian church," "Christian faith" and "Chris tian life" label themselves with that holy name. What did Christ deny? Everything that is today called Christian.

159 (Nov. 1887-March 1888)

The entire Christian teaching as to what shall be believed, the entire Christian "truth," is idle falsehood and deception: and precisely the opposite of what inspired the Christian movement in the beginning.

Precisely that which is Christian in the ecclesiastical sense is anti-Christian in essence: things and people instead of symbols; history instead of eternal facts; forms, rites, dogmas instead of a way of life. Utter indifference to dogmas, cults, priests, church, theology is Christian.

The Christian way of life is no more a fantasy than the Bud dhist way of life: it is a means to being happy.

160 (Nov. 1887-March 1888) Jesus starts directly with the condition the "Kingdom of Heaven" in the heart, and he does not find the means to it in the observances of the Jewish church; the reality of Judaism itself (its need to preserve itself) he regards as nothing; he is purely inward.

He likewise ignores the entire system of crude formalities governing intercourse with God: he opposes the whole teaching of repentance and atonement; he demonstrates how one must live in order to feel "deified"-and how one will not achieve it through repentance and contrition for one's sios: "Sin is of no account" is his central judgment.

Sin, repentance, forgiveness one of this belongs here—it is acquired from Judaism, or it is pagan.

161 (Nov, 1887-March 1888)16 The Kingdom of Heaven is a condition of the heart (-it is said of children "for theirs is the Kingdom of Heaven"): Not some

163 (Nov. 1887-March 1888) Neither by deeds nor in your heart should you resist him who harms you.

You should admit of no ground for divorcing your wife.

You should make no distinction between strangers and neighbors, foreigners and fellow countrymen.

You should be angry with no one, you should show contempt to no one. Give alms in secret. You should not want to become rich. You should not swear. You should not judge. You should be reconciled with foes; you should forgive. Do not pray publicly.

"Bliss" is not something promised: it is there if you live and act in such and such a way.17

164 (Nov. 1887-March 1888)

The entire prophet and miracle-worker attitude, the anger, the calling down of judgment is a dreadful corruption (e.g., Mark 6, 11. And whosoever shall not receive you ... verily I say unto you, it shall be more tolerable for Sodom and Gomorrha, etc.). The "fig tree" (Matt. 21, 18): Now in the morning as he re

17 The German editors added "Jesus commands" at the beginning of this section. They also omitted the third paragraph in the MS: "Perhaps also: one should castrate oneself." And the penultimate paragraph: "Let only good men be seen, let your light shine; who will enter heaven? who ever does the will of my father in heaven."

Schlechta, of course, reproduces the text of the standard editions, ignoring 1911, P, 501.

165 (Nov. 1887-March 1888)

In a quite absurd way, the doctrine of reward and punish ment has been crowded in: everything has thereby been ruined.

In the same way, the practice of the first ecclesia militans, 10 of the apostle (Paul 20 and his attitude, has been represented in a quite falsifying way as commanded, as predetermined

The subsequent glorification of the actual life and teaching of the first Christians: as if it had all been prescribed and the prescription merely followed

And as for the fulfillment of prophesies: what a mass of falsification and forgery!

166 (Nov. 1887-March 1888)

Jesus opposed the commonplace life with a real life, a life in truth: nothing was further from him than the stupid nonsense of an "eternalized Peter," an eternal personal survival. What he fights against is this exaggerated inflation of the "person": how can he desire to eternize precisely that?

In the same way he fights against hierarchy within the com munity: he does not promise that reward shall be proportionate to performance: how can he have meant punishment and reward in the beyond!

167 (Nov. 1887-March 1888)

Christianity: a naive beginning to a Buddhistic peace move ment in the very seat of ressentimen-but reversed by Paul into a pagan mystery doctrine, which finally learns to treat with the entire state organization-and wages war, condemns, tortures, swears, hates.

(p101)

Paul starts from the need for a mystery felt by the broad, religiously excited masses: he seeks a sacrifice, a bloody phantas magoria which will stand up in competition with the images of the mystery cults: God on the cross, blood-drinking, the unio mystica with the "sacrifice."

He seeks to bring the afterlife (the blissful, atoned afterlife of the individual soul) as resurrection into a causal relationship with that sacrifice (after the type of Dionysus, Mithras, Osiris).

He needs to bring the concept guilt and atonement into the foreground, not a new way of life (as Jesus himself had demon strated and lived) but a new cult, a new faith, a faith in a miraculous transformation ("redemption" through faith).

He understood what the pagan world had the greatest need of, and from the facts of Christ's life and death made a quite arbitrary selection, giving everything a new accentuation, shifting the emphasis everywhere--he annulled primitive Christianity as a matter or principle

The attempt to destroy priests and theologians culminated, thanks to Paul, in a new priesthood and theology in a new ruling order and a church.

The attempt to destroy the exaggerated inflation of the "person" culminated in faith in the "eternal person" (in concern for "eternal salvation"—), in the most paradoxical excess of personal egoism.

This is the humor of the situation, a tragic humor: Paul re erected on a grand scale precisely that which Christ had annulled through his way of living. At last, when the church was complete, it sanctioned even the existence of the state.

A god who died for our sins: redemption through faith; resurrection after death—all these are counterfeits of true Chris tianity for which that disastrous wrong-headed fellow [Paul]21 must be held responsible.

The exemplary life consists of love and humility; in a fullness of heart that does not exclude even the lowliest; in a formal re pudiation of maintaining one's rights, of self-defense, of victory in the sense of personal triumph; in faith in blessedness here on earth, in spite of distress, opposition and death; in reconciliation; in the absence of anger; not wanting to be rewarded; not being obliged to anyone; the completest spiritual-intellectual independence; a very proud life beneath the will to a life of poverty and service.

After the church had let itself be deprived of the entire Chris tian way of life and had quite specifically sanctioned life under the state, that form of life that Jesus had combatted and con demned, it had to find the meaning of Christianity in something else: in faith in unbelievable things, in the ceremonial of prayers, worship, feasts, etc. The concept "sin," "forgiveness," "reward" -all quite unimportant and virtually excluded from primitive Christianity--now comes into the foreground.

An appalling mishmash of Greek philosophy and Judaism; asceticism; continual judging and condemning; order of rank, etc.

170 (Nov. 1887-March 1888)

Christianity has from the outset transformed the symbolic into crudities:

1. the antithesis "real life" and "false" life: misunderstood as "this life" and "the life to come";

2. the concept "eternal life," the antithesis to transient personal life, as "personal immortality";

3. brotherhood on the basis of sharing food and drink to gether after the Hebrew-Arabic custom, as "the miracle of tran substantiation";

4. "resurrection—" understood as entry into "real life," as a state of "rebirth"; this is made into an historical eventuality which takes place some time or other after death;

5. the teaching that the son of man is the "Son of God," the living relationship between God and man; this is made into the "second person of the divinity"—the filial relationship to God of every man, even the lowliest, is abolished;

6. salvation through faith (namely, that there is no means of becoming a son of God except by following the way of life taught by Christ) reversed into the faith that one is to believe in some sort of miraculous subtraction of sins, accomplished not

through man but through Christ's deed:

With that, "Christ on the cross" had to be interpreted anew. This death in itself was not at all the main thing—it had been only one more sign of how one ought to behave in relation to the authorities and laws of this world: not to defend oneself- That had been the lesson.

171 (March-June 1888)

Toward a psychology of Paul.- The given fact is the death of Jesus. This has to be explained. That an explanation may be true or false has never entered the minds of such people as these: one day a sublime possibility comes into their heads: "this death could mean such and such”—and at once it does mean such and such! A hypothesis is proved true by the sublime impetus it imparts to its originator

"The proof of power": i.e., an idea is proved true by its effect ("by their fruits" as the Bible naively says); what inspires must be true—that for which one sheds one's blood must be true

Here, the sudden feeling of power that an idea arouses in its originator is everywhere accounted proof of its value:--and since one knows no way of honoring an idea other than by calling it true, the first predicate with which it is honored is the predicate "true" How otherwise could it be so effective? It was imagined by some power: if that power were not real, it could not be effective

The idea is understood to have been inspired: the effect that it exercises possesses something of the violence of a demonic in fluence

An idea that such a decadent is unable to resist, to which he completely succumbs, is thus "proved" true! ! !

None of these holy epileptics and seers of visions possessed a thousandth part of that integrity in self-criticism with which a philologist today reads a text or proves the truth of an historical event- Compared with us, they are moral cretins—22

That it does not matter whether a thing is true, but only what

(p104)





effect it produces absolute lack of intellectual integrity. Every thing is justified, lies, slander, the most shameless forgery, if it serves to raise the temperature until one "believes"

A systematic school of the means to seduction to a faith: contempt, on principle, for the spheres from which contradiction might come (the spheres of reason, philosophy and wisdom, mistrust, caution); a shameless praising and glorification of the doctrine, with constant reference to the fact that it was God who gave it--that the apostle signifies nothing that nothing here is to be criticized, but only believed, accepted; that it is the most extra ordinary grace and favor to receive such a doctrine of redemption; that the deepest gratitude and humility is the condition in which to receive it

The ressentiment which these lowly-placed persons feel toward everything held in honor is constantly gambled upon; that one represents this doctrine as a counterdoctrine in opposition to the wisdom of the world, to the power of the world, seduces them to it. It convinces the outcast and underprivileged of all kinds; it promises blessedness, advantage, privilege to the most insignificant and humble; it fills poor little foolish heads with an insane conceit, as if they were the meaning and the salt of the earth

All this, I repeat, one cannot sufficiently despise. We shall spare ourselves a critique of the doctrine; it suffices to observe the means it uses to know what it is one is dealing with. It identified with virtue, it shamelessly claimed for itself alone the whole fascinat ing force of virtue—it identified with the power of paradox and with the need felt by old civilizations for spice and absurdity; it amazed, it enraged, it provoked persecution and mistreatment

It is precisely the same well-pondered baseness with which the Jewish priesthood established its power and the Jewish church was created

One should distinguish: (1) that warmth of the passion "love" (resting on the subterranean basis of a heated sensuality); (2) the absolute ignobility of Christianity: --the continual exaggeration, the verbosity; - the lack of cool spirituality and irony; --the un military nature of all its instincts; the priestly prejudice against manly pride, against sensuality, the sciences, the arts.23

Paul: he seeks power in opposition to ruling Judaism his movement is too weak- Revaluation of the concept "Jew": the "race" is set aside but that means negating what is fundamental.

The "martyr," the "fanatic," the value of all strong faith

Christianity is the decadent form of the old world sunk into deepest impotence, so that the sickest and unhealthiest elements and desires come to the top.

Consequently, in order to create a unity, a resisting power, other instincts had to step into the foreground in short, a kind of calamity was needed such as that from which the Jews had acquired their instinct for self-preservation---

In this regard, the persecutions of the Christians were in valuable-a sense of community in danger, mass-conversion as the only means of putting an end to individual persecution (con sequently he takes as lightly as possible the concept "conver sión"-).

174 (Spring-Fall 1887; rev. Spring-Fall 1888) The Christian-Jewish life: here ressentiment did not pre dominate, Only the great persecutions could have developed this passion to this extent—the ardor of love as well as that of hatred.

When one sees ope's dearest sacrificed for one's faith, one becomes aggressive; we owe the triumph of Christianity to its per secutors.

The asceticism in Christianity is not specifically Christian: this is what Schopenhauer misunderstood: it only makes inroads into Christianity wherever asceticism also exists apart from Chris tianity.

Hypochondriac Christianity, the torturing and vivisection of the conscience, is in the same way only characteristic of a certain soil in which Christian values have taken root: it is not Chris tianity itself. Christianity has absorbed diseases of all kinds from morbid soil: one can only reproach it for its inability to guard against any infection. But that precisely is its essence: Christianity is a type of decadence.

(p106)





175 (Spring-Fall 1887; rev. Spring-Fall 1888) The reality upon which Christianity could be raised was the little Jewish family of the Diaspora, with its warmth and affection, with its readiness to help and sustain one another-munheard-of and perhaps not understood in the whole Roman Empire with its concealed pride of the "chosen" disguised as humility, with its innermost denial, untouched by envy, of all that is on top and possesses power and splendor. To have recognized in this a form of power, to have recognized that this blissful condition was com municable, seductive, infectious to pagans also--that was Paul's genius: to employ this store of latent energy, of prudent happiness for a "Jewish church of freer confession”--the entire Jewish ex perience and mastery of communal self-preservation under foreign rule, also Jewish propaganda-he divined that as his task. What he lit upon was just this absolutely unpolitical and withdrawn species of little people: their art of asserting themselves and pre vailing, cultivated through a number of virtues which constituted virtue in its entirety ("means by which a particular species of man preserves and enhances himself").

The principle of love derives from the little Jewish communi ties: it is a soul of the more passionate kind that glows here under the ashes of humility and wretchedness; this was neither Greek, por Indian, nor Germanic. The song in praise of love that Paul composed24 is nothing Christian, but à Jewish outburst of the eternal flame that is Semitic. If Christianity has done anything es sential psychologically, it is that it raised the temperature of the soul among those cooler and nobler races that were then on top; it was the discovery that the most wretched life can become rich and inestimable through a rise in temperature

It goes without saying that such a transference could not take place in respect to the ruling orders: the Jews and Christians had their bad manners against them and when allied to bad manners, strength and passion of soul are repellent and almost disgusting (-I see these bad manners whenever I read the New Testament).

* I Corinthians 13. The point Nietzsche makes here was utterly revo lutionary at that time and constitutes a major contribution to our under standing of Judaism and Christianity, even if the form of expression here is deliberately hyperbolical and paradoxical. For further discussion, see my Nietzsche, Chapter 12, section II.

(p107) One had to be related through lowliness and want to the type of lowly people who spoke here to feel their attraction

How one reacts to the New Testament is a test of whether one has any classical taste in one's bones (cf. Tacitus); whoever is not revolted by it, whoever does not honestly and profoundly sense something of foeda superstitio25 in it, something from which one withdraws one's hand as if to avoid being soiled, does not know what is classical. One must feel about the "cross" as Goethe did20.

176 (March-June 1888)

Reaction of the little people:- Love gives the greatest feeling of power. To grasp to what extent not man in general but a certain species of man speaks here. This is to be exhumed more precisely 27

"We are divine through love, we become 'children of God'; God loves us and wants nothing whatever from us save love"; this means: no morality, obedience, or activity produces that feeling of power that love produces; one does nothing bad from love, one does much more than one would do from obedience and virtue.

Here is the happiness of the herd, the feeling of community in great and small things, the living feeling of unity experienced as the sum of the feeling of life. Being helpful and useful and caring for others continually arouses the feeling of power; visible success, the expression of pleasure underlines the feeling of power; pride is not lacking, in the form of community, the abode of God, the "chosen."

What has in fact happened is that man has again experienced an altération of personality: this time he calls his feeling of love God. One must picture to oneself what the awakening of such a feeling is like: a kind of ecstasy, a strange language, a "gospel". it was this novelty that forbade him to ascribe love to himself he thought God was walking before him and coming alive within him.- "God descends to man," one's "neighbor" is transfigured into a god (in so far as he arouses the feeling of love). Jesus is

31 "Abominable superstition."

one's neighbor as soon as he is conceived as godhead, as a cause of the feeling of power.

177 (Jan.-Fall 1888)

The faithful are conscious that they are endlessly indebted to Christianity, and therefore conclude that its originator is a person age of the first rank- This conclusion is false, but it is typical of conclusions drawn by worshipers. Objectively considered, it is pos sible, first, that they are in error about the value of that for which they are indebted to Christianity: convictions prove nothing in favor of that of which one is convinced; in the case of religions they establish rather a suspicion against it-It is possible, secondly, that the debt to Christianity ought not to be ascribed to its founder but to the finished structure, to the whole thing, the church, etc. The concept originator" is so ambiguous it can even mean the accidental cause of a movement: the figure of the founder has been enlarged in proportion as the church has grown; but precisely this perspective of worship permits the conclusion that at some time or other this founder was something very uncertain and insecure, in the beginning. Consider with what degree of freedom Paul treats, indeed almost juggles with, the problem of the person of Jesus: someone who died, who was seen again after his death, who was delivered over to death by the Jews- A mere "motif": he then wrote the music to it- Azero in the beginning.28

179 (Nov. 1887-March 1888)

On the psychological problem of Christianity. The driving force is: ressentiment, the popular uprising, the revolt of the under privileged. (It is otherwise with Buddhism: this is not born out of a ressentiment movement but fights ressentiment because it leads to action.)

This peace party grasps that the renunciation of enmity in thought and deed is a condition of distinction and preservation.

* The final phrase is omitted in the standard editions.

(p109) Herein lies the psychological difficulty that has hampered the under standing of Christianity: the drive that created it forces one to fight against it as a matter of principle.

Only as a peace and innocence party has this insurrectionary movement any possibility of success: it must conquer through ex treme mildness, sweetness, softness; it grasps this by instinct Masterstroke: to deny and condemn the drive whose expression one is, continually to display, by word and deed, the antithesis of this drive

180 (Nov. 1887-March 1888)

Pretended youth. One is deceiving oneself if one imagines here a naive and youthful people rising up against an ancient cul ture; superstition has it that the deeper springs of life gushed forth anew in those classes of the lowliest people where Christianity grew and took root: one understands nothing of the psychology of Chris tianity if one takes it to be the expression of a newly arisen na tional youthfulness and racial invigoration. On the contrary: it is a typical form of decadence, the moral hypersensitivity and hysteria of a sick mishmash populace grown weary and aimless. The ex traordinary company that here gathered around this master-seducer Teally belongs wholly in a Russian növel: all the neuroses keep a rendezvous in them--the absence of duties, the instinct that every thing is really coming to an end, that nothing is worth while any more, contentment in a dolce far niente.20

The power and certainty of the future in the Jewish instinct, its tremendously tough will to exist and to power, lies in its ruling classes: those orders which primitive Christianity raised up are most clearly distinguished by the exhaustion of their instincts. On one händ, one has had enough: on the other, one is content with oneself, in oneself, for oneself.

Christianity as emancipated Judaism (in the same way as a local and racially conditioned nobility at length emancipates itself from these conditions and goes in search of related elements )

1. As church community) within the state, as an unpolitical structure;

2. As life, discipline, practice, art of living;

3. As religion of sin (of transgression against God as the only kind of transgression, as the sole cause of suffering in general), with a universal cure for it. There are only sins against God; men shall not judge acts done against men, nor demand a reckoning, except in the name of God, Ditto, all commands (love): every thing is associated with God and done to man for God's sake. A higher prudence lies in this a very narrow life, as with the Eskimos, is endurable only by the most peaceable and cautious disposition: Jewish-Christian dogma turns against sin in favor of the "sinner"--).

182 (Spring-Fall 1887) The Jewish priesthood had understood how to present every thing which it claimed as a divine precept, as obedience to a com mand of God also how to introduce whatever served to preserve Israel and make possible its existence (e.g., a number of works: circumcision, sacrificial, cult as the center of national conscious ness) not as nature, but as "God." This process continued; within Judaism, where the necessity for "works" was not felt (that is to say, as a means of segregation from the outside world), a priestly species of man could be conceived that behaved as the "noble nature" behaves toward the aristocracy; a classless and at the same time spontaneous priestliness of soul, which now, in order to contrast itself sharply with its opposite, attached value not to "works," but to the "disposition"

Fundamentally it was again the question of making a certain species of soul prevail: as it were, a popular uprising within a priestly people-a pietistic movement from below (sinners, publi cans, women, the sick). Jesus of Nazareth was the sign by which they recognized themselves. And again, in order to believe in them selves they need a theological transfiguration: they require nothing less than "the Son of God" to create a faith for themselves — And just as the priesthood had falsified the entire history of Israel, so again the attempt was here made to forge the history of mankind in general, so that Christianity might appear to be its most cardinal event. This movement could have arisen only on the soil of Juda ism, whose principal deed was to associate guilt with misfortune

(p111)

and to reduce all guilt to guilt against God: Christianity raised all this to the second power.

183 (Nov. 1887-March 1888)

The symbolism of Christianity is based on the Jewish, which had already resolved all reality (history, nature) into a holy un naturalness and unreality-which no longer recognized real history, which was no longer interested in natural consequences

184 (March-June 1888)

The Jews tried to prevail after they had lost two of their castes, that of the warrior and that of the peasant; in this sense they are the "castrated": they have the priests and then immedi ately, the chandala

As is only fair, a break develops among them, a revolt of the chandala: the origin of Christianity. .

Because they knew the warrior only as their master, they brought into their religion enmity toward the noble, toward the exalted and proud, toward power, toward the ruling orders they are pessimists from indignation

Thus they created an important new posture: the priest at the head of the chandala-against the noble orders

Christianity drew the ultimate conclusion of this movement: even in the Jewish priesthood it still sensed caste, the privileged, the noble—it abolished the priest

The Christian is the chandala who repudiates the priest-the chandala who redeems himself

That is why the French Revolution is the daughter and con tinuation of Christianity-its instincts are against caste, against the noble, against the last privileges

185 (Spring-Fall 1887)

The "Christian ideal": staged with Jewish subtlety. The basic psychological drives, its "nature":

the revolt against the ruling spiritual power;

attempt to make the virtues through which happiness is pos sible for the lowliest into the standard ideal of all values—to call it God: the instinct for preservation in the least vital classes;



(p112)



 to justify absolute abstention from war and resistance through this ideal—including obedience;

love of one another as consequence of love of God.

Artifice: to deny all natural mobilia and to transfer them to the spiritual realm beyond to exploit virtue and its veneration entirely for one's own ends, step by step to deny virtue to every thing non-Christian.

186 (Spring-Fall 1887) The profound contempt with which the Christian was treated in the noble areas of classical antiquity is of a kind with the present instinctive aversion to Jews: it is the hatred of the free and self respecting orders for those who are pushing and who combine timid and awkward gestures with an absurd opinion of their worth.

The New Testament is the gospel of a wholly ignoble species of man; their claim to possess more value, indeed to possess all value, actually has something revolting about it-even today,

187 (Spring-Fall 1887) How little the subject matters! It is the spirit that gives life! What stuffy and sickroom air arises from all that excited chatter about "redemption," love, blessedness, faith, truth, "eternal life"! Take, on the other hand, a really pagan book, e.g., Petronius, where fundamentally nothing is done, said, desired and valued but what by peevish Christian standards is sin, mortal sin even. And yet how pleasant is the purer air, the superior spirituality of its quicker pace, the liberated and overflowing strength that feels sure of the future! In the entire New Testament there is not one single bouffonnerie: but that fact refutes a book

188 (Spring-Fall 1887)

The profound unworthiness with which all life outside the Christian life is condemned: they are not content with thinking meanly of their real opponents, they require nothing less than a collective defamation of everything which is not themselves. Arro gance of holiness gets along famously with a base and crafty soul: witness the first Christians.

The future: they see they are well paid— Theirs is the most

(p113) uncleanly kind of spirit there is. The entire life of Christ is so presented as to help to justify the prophecies: he acts in this way in order that they may be justified

189 (Spring-Fall 1887)

The lying interpretation of the words, gestures and conditions of the dying: fear of death, for example, is systematically confused with fear of the "after death"_30:

190 (Spring-Fall 1887)

The Christians did as the Jews did and put into the mouth of their master and encrusted his life with what they conceived to be a condition of their existence and an innovation. At the same time they restored to him all proverbial wisdom-: in short, they repre sented their actual life and activity as obedience and thus, as sancti fied for their propaganda,

What it all depends upon can be gathered from Paul: it is not much. What remains is the elaboration of a type of saint on the basis of what they considered holy.

The entire "miraculous doctrine," including the resurrection, is a consequence of self-glorification by the community, which ascribed to its master in a higher degree whatever it thought itself capable of (it derived its strength from him—).

191 (Nov. 1887-March 1888)

Christians have never put into practice the acts Jesus pre scribed for them, and the impudent chatter about "justification by faith" and its unique and supreme significance is only the conse quence of the church's lack of courage and will to confess the works which Jesus demanded,

The Buddhist acts differently from the non-Buddhist; the Christian acts as all the world does and possesses a Christianity of ceremonies and moods.

"Faith" or "works"?- But that "works," the habit of certain works, should engender a certain evaluation and finally a certain disposition is as natural as it is unnatural that mere evaluation should produce "works."

Faith is a pons asinorum.8.1 The background is a profound conviction on the part of Luther and his kind of their incapacity for Christian works, a personal fact disguised beneath an extreme doubt as to whether activity of all kinds is not sin and the work of the Devil: so that the value of existence resides in single highly tensed conditions of inactivity (prayer, effusion, etc.). In the last resort he was right: the in stincts expressed in all the actions of the Reformers are the most brutal that exist. Only by an absolute turning away from them selves, by absorption in their opposite, only as an illusion ("faith”) was existence endurable to them.

movement of antiquity, formulated through the employment of the life, teaching and "words" of the founder of Christianity but inter preted in an absolutely arbitrary way after the pattern of funda mentally different needs; translated into the language of every already existing subterranean religion

It is the rise of pessimism ( while Jesus wanted to bring peace and the happiness of lambs): and moreover the pessimism of the weak, the inferior, the suffering, the oppressed.

Its mortal enemy is (1) power in character, spirit and taste; "worldliness"; (2) classical "happiness, the noble levity and skep ticism, the hard pride, the eccentric intemperance and the cool self sufficiency of the sage, Greek refinement in gesture, word, and form. Its mortal enemy is the Roman just as much as the Greek,

Attempt by antipaganism to found and make itself possible philosophically; predilection for the ambiguous figures of the old culture, above all for Plato, that instinctive Semite and anti-Hellene -also for Stoicism, which is essentially the work of Semites ( "dignity" as strictness, law, virtue as greatness, self-responsi bility, authority, as supreme sovereignty over one's own person this is Semitic. The Stoic is an Arabian sheik wrapped in Greek togas and concepts). 82

196 (Nov. 1887-March 1888) Christianity only takes up the fight that had already begun against the classical ideal and the noble religion.

In fact, this entire transformation is an adaption to the needs and the level of understanding of the religious masses of that time: those masses which believed in Isis, Mithras, Dionysus, the “Great Mother," and which desired of a religion: (1) hope of a beyond, (2) the bloody phantasmagoria of the sacrificial animal (the mys tery), (3) the redemptive deed, the holy legend, (4) asceticism, world-denial, superstitious "purification," (5) a hierarchy, a form of community. In short: Christianity accommodated itself to already existing and established antipaganism, to the cults that had been combatted by Epicurus-more precisely, to the religions of the lower masses, the women, the slaves, the non-noble classes.

We therefore have the following misunderstandings:

* Zeno of Citium, on Cyprus, the founder of the Stoic school, was prob ably a Semite.116

5. the whole world of corrupt imagination and morbid affects instead of a kindly and simple way of life, instead of a Buddhistic happiness attainable on earth;

6. an ecclesiastical order with priesthood, theology, cult, sacrament; in short, everything that Jesus of Nazareth had com batted;

7. miracles, all over, superstition: while the distinguishing mark of Judaism and earliest Christianity is its repugnance to miracles, its relative rationality...

The psychological presupposition: lack of knowledge and culture, ignorance which has forgotten all shame: imagine these impudent saints in Athens;

the Jewish instinct of the "chosen": they claim all the virtues for themselves without further ado, and count the rest of the world their opposites; a profound sign of a vulgar soul;

a complete lack of real aims, of real tasks, for which one needs other virtues than those of the bigot—the state took this work from their shoulders: these impudent people nonetheless behaved as if they had no need of the state. .

The founder of Christianity had to pay for having directed himself to the lowest class of Jewish society and intelligence. They conceived him in the spirit they understood- It is a real disgrace to have concocted a salvation story, a personal God, a personal redeemer, a personal immortality and to have retained all the mean ness of the "person" and "history” in a doctrine that contests the reality of all that is personal and historical

Nothing is less innocent than the New Testament. One knows from what soil. it sprang. This people of an inflexible self-will which knew how to prevail after it had lost every natural support and had long since forfeited its right to existence, and to that end had to raise itself up by unnatural, purely imaginary presupposi tions (as chosen people, as community of saints, as the people of the promise, as "church"): this people handled the pia frausa3 with such perfection, such a degree of "good conscience," that one cannot be sufficiently cautious when it preaches morality. When Jews step forward as innocence itself, then the danger is great: one should always have one's little fund of reason, mistrust, and malice to hand when one reads the New Testament,

People of the basest origin, in part rabble, outcasts - not only from good but also from respectable society, raised away from even the smell of culture, without discipline, without knowledge, without the remotest suspicion that there is such a thing as con science in spiritual matters; simply-Jews: with an instinctive ability to create an advantage, a means of seduction out of every superstitious supposition, out of ignorance itself.84

201 (Spring-Fall 1887) However modest one may be in one's demand for intellectual cleanliness, one cannot help feeling, when coming into contact with the New Testament, a kind of inexpressible discomfiture: for the unchecked impudence with which the least qualified want to raise their voice on the greatest problems, and even claim to be judges of such things, surpasses all measure. The shameless levity with which the most intractable problems (life, world, God, purpose

of life) are spoken of, as if they were not problems at all but simply things that these little bigots knew!

202 (Spring-Fall 1887; rev. Spring-Fall 1888)

This was the most fatal kind of megalomania there has ever been on earth: when these lying little abortions of bigots began to lay claim to the words "God," "Last Judgment," "truth," "love," "wisdom," "Holy Spirit" and with them made a boundary between themselves and "the world", when this species of man began to reverse values according to his own image, as if he were the mean ing, the salt, the measure, and the standard of all the rest one should have built madhouses for them and nothing more. That one persecuted them was a piece of ancient folly in the grand manner: that meant taking them too seriously, that meant making something scrious out of them.

The whole fatality was made possible by the presence in the world already of a similar kind of megalomania, the Jewish (once the chasm had opened up between the Jews and the Christian-Jews, the Christian-Jews had to employ once more and in an ultimate intensification for their own self-preservation the self-preservative procedures devised by the Jewish instinct -); on the other hand, Greek moral philosophy had already done everything to prepare the way for and to make palatable moral fanaticism even among Greeks and Romans-Plato, the great viaduct of corruption, who first refused to see nature in morality, who had already debased the Greek gods with his concept "good," who was already marked by Jewish bigotry (in Egypt?)

203 (Spring-Fall 1887; rev. Spring-Fall 1888) On the denaturing of morality. These little herd-animal vir tues do not by any means lead to "eternal life": to put them on show in this way, and oneself with them, may be very clever, but to him who keeps his eyes open even here, it remains in spite of all the most ludicrous of all plays. One does not by any means deserve a privileged position on earth and in heaven by attaining perfection as a little, good-natured sheep; one remains at best a little, good-natured, absurd sheep with horns provided one does not burst with vanity--as the court chaplains d035-or provoke scandal by posing as a judge. "

What a tremendous transfiguration of color here illumines the little virtues—as if they were the reflection of divine qualities!

The natural task and utility of every virtue is systematically hushed up; it is of value only with reference to a divine command, a divine model, only with reference to heavenly and spiritual goods. (Magnificent: as if it had to do with "salvation of the soul": but it was a means of "enduring" things here with as many beautiful feelings as possible.)

The law, the thoroughly realistic formalization of certain con ditions for the self-preservation of a community, forbids certain actions directed to certain ends, namely those that are directed against the community: it does not forbid the disposition that pro duces these actions for it needs these actions for other ends, namely against the enemies of the community. Then the moral idealist appears and says: "God beholds the heart: the action itself is nothing; one must exterminate the aggressive disposition that produces it-” Under normal conditions one laughs at this; only in those exceptional instances when a community lives absolutely outside the necessity of waging war for its existence does one lend an ear to such things. One abandons a disposition whose utility is no longer apparent.

This was the case, e.g., when Buddha appeared amidst a very peaceable and even spiritually exhausted community.

36 These words a dig at Hofprediger Stöcker, the leading German anti Semite of the time are found only in 1911, p. 502. This is also true of the title of this section. For Stöcker see also 89 and 191 above.

This was also the case with the earliest Christian community (also Jewish community), whose presupposition is the absolutely unpolitical Jewish society. Christianity could grow only in the soil of Judaism, i.e., amidst a people that had already renounced poli tics and lived a kind of parasitic existence within the Roman order of things. Christianity is a step further on: one is even more free to "emasculate" oneself-circumstances permit it.

One drives nature out of morality when one says "Love your enemies": for then the natural "Thou shalt love thy neighbor and hate thy enemy" in the law (in instinct) has become meaningless; then this love of one's neighbor must also find a new basis (as a kind of love of God). Everywhere, God is iriserted and utility withdrawn; everywhere the real origin of morality is denied: the veneration of nature, which lies precisely in the recognition of a natural morality, is destroyed at its roots

Whence comes the seductive charm of such an emasculated ideal of man? Why are we not disgusted by it as we are perhaps disgusted by the idea of a castrato? - The answer lies precisely here: the voice of a castrato does not disgust us, despite the cruel mutilation that is its condition: it has grown sweeter Just be cause the "male organ" has been amputated from virtue, a feminine note has been brought to the voice of virtue that it did not have before.

If we think, on the other hand, of the fearful hardship, danger, and accidents that a life of manly virtue brings with it--the life of a Corsican even today or that of the pagan Arab (which is similar even in its details to the life of the Corsican: their songs might have been written by Corsicans)-We grasp how precisely the most robust kind of man is fascinated and affected by this lust ful note of "goodness," of "purity". A shepherd's song--an idyl ---the "good man”: these things produce the strongest effect in ages when tragedy walks abroad.

But we have with this also recognized to what extent the "idealist" (-ideal-castrato) also emerges from a quite definite reality and is not merely a fantasist--he has arrived at the knowl edge that for his kind of reality such a coarse injunction forbidding definite actions has no meaning (because the very instinct for these actions has been weakened through long lack of practice, of need

(p121)

for practice). The castrator formulates a number of new self preservative measures for men of a quite definite species: in this he is a realist. His means of legislation are the same as those of the older legislators: the appeal to authority of all kinds, to "God," the employment of the concept "guilt and punishment"-ie., he makes use of all the appurtenances of the older ideal, only in a new interpretation, punishment, for example, made more inward (perhaps as the pang of conscience).

In practice this species of man goes under as soon as the ex ceptional conditions of his existence cease a kind of Tahiti and island happiness, as in the life of the little Jews in the provinces. Their only natural opponent is the soil from which they grew: against this they need to fight, against this they must let the offen sive and defensive affects grow again; their opponents are the adherents of the old ideal (—this species of enmity is championed on a grand scale by Paul in relation to Judaism, by Luther in rela tion to the priestly-ascetic ideal). The mildest form of this oppo sition is certainly that of the early Buddhists: perhaps no greater amount of work has been expended upon anything than upon the discouragement and weakening of feelings of emnity. The fight against ressentiment seems to be almost the first duty of the Bud dhist: only thus is peace of soul assured. To disengage oneself, but without rancor: that presupposes, to be sure, an astonishingly mild and sweet humanity-saints

The prudence of moral castrationism.-- How can one wage war against the manly affects and valuations? One possesses no means of physical force, one can wage only a war of cunning, sorcery, lies, in short "of the spirit."

First recipe: one claims virtue in general for one's ideal; one negates the older ideal to the point of presenting it as the antithesis of all ideals. For this one employs an art of defamation.

Second recipe: one sets up one's own type as the measure of value in general; one projects it into things, behind things, behind the fate of things—as God.

Third recipe: one sets up the opponent of one's ideal as the opponent of God; one fabricates for oneself the right to great pathos, to power, to curse and to bless.

Fourth recipe: one derives all suffering, all that is uncanny,



(p122)





fearful and fateful in existence from opposition to one's own ideal: -all suffering is punishment, even in the case of one's followers (unless it accompanies a test, etc.).

Fifth recipe; one goes so far as to conceive nature as the antithesis of one's own ideal; one regards it as a great test of patience, as a sort of martyrdom to endure natural conditions for very long; one practices dédain30 of mien and manners in respect to all "natural things."

Sixth recipe: the victory of unnaturalness, of the castrationist ideal, the victory of the world of the pure, good, sinless, blessed is projected into the future as conclusion, finale, great hope, as the "coming of the kingdom of God."

I hope that at this artificial inflation of a small species into the absolute measure of things one is still permitted to laugh?

205 (Spring-Fall 1887)

I do not like at all about that Jesus of Nazareth or his apostle Paul that they put so many ideas into the heads of little people, as if their modest virtues were of any consequence. We have had to pay too dearly for it: for they have brought the more valuable qualities of virtue and man into ill repute; they have set the bad conscience of the noble soul against its self-sufficiency; they have led astray, to the point of self-destruction, the brave, magnanimous, daring, excessive inclinations of the strong soul.

206 (Spring-Fall 1887)

In the New Testament, and specifically in the Gospels, I hear absolutely nothing "divine" speaking: much rather an indirect form of the most abysmal rage for defamation and destruction-one of the most dishonorable forms of hatred. It lacks all knowledge of the qualities of a higher nature. Clumsy abuse of all kinds of phili ştinism, the entire treasury of proverbs is laid claim to and fully utilized; was it necessary for a god to come in order to say to these publicans etc.

Nothing is more vulgar than this battle against the Pharisees with the aid of an absurd and impractical moral pretence, the peo ple have always taken pleasure in such a tour de force. The re proach of "hypocrisy!" coming from this mouth! Nothing is more

* Disdain.

(p123) vulgar than this kind of treatment of an opponent a most in sidious criterion of nobility or its reverse

207 (Nov. 1887-March 1888)

Primitive Christianity is abolition of the state: forbids oaths, war service, courts of justice, self-defense and the defense of any kind of community, the distinction between fellow countrymen and foreigners, and also the differentiation of classes.

Christ's example: he does not resist those who are harming him; he does not defend himself; he does more: he "turns the other cheek" (to the question: "Tell us whether thou be the Christ" he answers: "Hereafter shall ye see the Son of Man sitting on the right hand of power and coming in the clouds of heaven"). He forbids his disciples to defend him; he makes it clear that he could get help but will not.

Christianity is also abolition of society: it prefers all that society counts of little worth, it grows up among outcasts and the condemned, among lepers of all kinds, "sinners," "publicans," prostitutes, the most stupid folk (the "fishers"); it disdains the rich, the learned, the noble, the virtuous, the "correct"

of society: iz Outcasts blicans,"

208 (Nov. 1887-March 1888)

The war against the noble and powerful as it is waged in the New Testament is a war after the manner of Reynard the Fox and with the same methods: but always with priestly unction and a decided refusal to recognize one's own cunning.

209 (Nov, 1887-March 1888)

The gospel: the news that a gateway to happiness stands open for the poor and lowly--that all one has to do is free oneself from the institutions, traditions, guardianship of the upper classes: to this extent the rise of Christianity is nothing more than the typical socialist doctrine.

Property, gain, fatherland, rank and status, tribunals, police, state, church, education, art, the army: all are so many hindrances to happiness, errors, snares, works of the devil, upon which the gospel passes judgment--all typical of socialist doctrine.

In the background is insurrection, the explosion of a stored-up



(p124)



 antipathy towards the "masters," the instinct for how much happi ness could lie, after such long oppression, simply in feeling oneself free-- (Usually a sign that the lower orders have been too well treated, their tongues have already tasted a happiness forbidden them. It is not hunger that provokes revolutions, but that the people have acquired an appetite en mangeant37—).

210 (Spring-Fall 1887)

Read the New Testament as a book of seduction: virtue is appropriated in the instinct that with it one can capture public opinion--and indeed the most modest virtue, which recognizes the ideal sheep and nothing further (including the shepherd.--): a little, sweet, well-meaning, helpful, and enthusiastically cheer ful kind of virtue that expects absolutely nothing from the outside --that sets itself altogether apart from "the world." The most ab surd arrogance, as if on one hand the community represented all that is right, and on the other the world all that is false, eternally reprehensible, and rejected, and as if the destiny of mankind re volved about this fact. The most absurd hatred toward everything in power: but without touching it! A kind of inner detachment that outwardly leaves everything as it was (servitude and slavery; to know how to turn everything into a means of serving God and

virtue).

211 (Spring-Fall 1887; rev. Spring-Fall 1888)

Christianity is possible as the most private form of existence; it presupposes a narrow, remote, completely unpolitical society it belongs in the conventicle. A "Christian state," "Christian poli tics," on the other hand, are a piece of impudence, a lie, like for instance a Christian leadership of an army, which finally treats the "God of Hosts" as if he were chief of staff. The papacy, too, has never been in a position to carry on Christian politics; and when reformers indulge in politics, as Luther did, one sees that they are just as much followers of Machiavelli as any immoralist or tyrant.

212 (Nov. 1887-March 1888) Christianity is still possible at any time. It is not tied to any

BOOK TWO: Critique of Highest Values of the impudent dogmas that have adorned themselves with its name: it requires neither the doctrine of a personal God, nor that of sin, nor that of immortality, nor that of redemption, nor that of faith; it has absolutely no need of metaphysics, and even less of asceticism, even less of a Christian "natural science." Chris tianity is a way of life, not a system of beliefs. It tell us how to act; not what we ought to believe.

Whoever says today: "I will not be a soldier," "I care nothing for the courts," "I shall not claim the services of the police," "I will do nothing that may disturb the peace within me: and if I must suffer on that account, nothing will serve better to maintain my peace than suffering"-he would be a Christian.38

213 (Nov. 1887-March 1888)

Toward a history of Christianity. Continual change of milieu: Christian doctrine is therefore continually changing its emphasis Favoring of lowly and little people- The development of cari tasao_ The type "Christian" reassumes step by step everything that it originally negated (in the negation of which it endured ). The Christian becomes citizen, soldier, judge, worker, merchant, scholar, theologian, priest, philosopher, farmer, artist, patriot, politician, "prince"- he takes up again all the activities he has forsworn (self-defense, judgment, punishment, oath-taking, dis tinguishing between nation and nation, contempt, wrath-). The whole life of the Christian is at last exactly the life from which Christ preached deliverance

The church is what is as much a symptom of the triumph of the anti-Christian as the modern state, modern nationalism The church is the barbarization of Christianity.

214 (Nov. 1887-March 1888)

These have mastered Christianity: Judaism (Paul); Plato nism (Augustine); the mystery cult (doctrine of redemption, emblem of the "cross"); asceticism (enmity toward "nature," "reason," "the senses"--the Orient-).

215 (Spring-Fall 1887) Christianity as a denaturalization of herd-animal morality: accompanied by absolute misunderstanding and self-deception. Democratization is a more natural form of it, one less mendacious.

Datum: the oppressed, the lowly, the great masses of slaves and semi-slaves desire power,

First step: they make themselves free--they ransom them selves, in imagination at first, they recognize one another, they prevail.

Second step: they enter into battle, they demand recognition, equal rights, "justice."

Third step: they demand privileges (they draw the repre sentatives of power over to their side).

Fourth step: they demand exclusive power, and they get it--

In Christianity, three elements must be distinguished: (a) the oppressed of all kinds, (b) the mediocre of all kinds, (c) the dis contented and sick of all kinds. With the first element Christianity fights against the political nobility and its ideal; with the second element, against the exceptional and privileged (spiritually, physic ally-) of all kinds; with the third element, against the natural instinct of the healthy and happy.

When a victory is won, the second element steps into the fore ground; for then Christianity has persuaded the healthy and happy to its side (as warriors in its cause), likewise the powerful (as interested parties on account of the conquest of the mob) and now it is the herd instinct, the mediocre nature which is of value from any point of view, which gets its supreme sanction through Christianity. This mediocre nature at last grows so conscious of itself (---acquires courage for itself-) that it arrogates even politi cal power to itself

Democracy is Christianity made natural: a kind of "return to nature" after, on account of its extreme antinaturalness, it could be overcome by the opposite values.- Consequence: the aristo cratic ideal henceforth loses its naturalness ("the higher man," "noble," "artist," "passion," "knowledge," etc.; romanticism as cult of the exception, the genius, ctc.).

(p127)

216 (Spring-Fall 1887; rev. Spring-Fall 1888) When the "masters" could also become Christians. It lies in the instinct of a community (family, race, herd, tribe) to feel that the conditions and desires to which it owes its survival are valuable in themselves, e.g., obedience, reciprocity, consideration, moderation, sympathy-consequently to suppress everything that contradicts or stands in the way of them.

Likewise, it lies in the instinct of the rulers (be they indi viduals or classes) to patronize and applaud the virtues that make their subjects useful and submissive ( conditions and affects which may be as different as can be from their own).

The herd instinct and the instinct of the rulers agree in praising a certain number of qualities and conditions--but for differing reasons: the former from direct egoism, the latter from indirect egoism.

Submission of the master races to Christianity is essentially the consequence of the insight that Christianity is a herd religion, that it teaches obedience: in short, that Christians are easier to rule than non-Christians. With this hint, the pope recommends Christian propaganda to the emperor of China even today.

It should be added that the seductive force of the Christian ideal works most strongly perhaps upon such natures as love danger, adventure and opposition-as love all that involves risking themselves while at the same time engendering a non plus ultra of the feeling of power. Consider Saint Teresa, surrounded by the heroic instincts of her brothers:- Christianity here appears as a form of orgy of the will, of strength of will, as a heroic quixotism

When and where has any man of consequence resembled the Christian ideal at least in such eyes as a psychologist and student of man must have?-check all of Plutarch's heroes.

218 (Nov. 1837-March 1888)

Our pre-eminence: we live in the age of comparison, we can verify as has never been verified before: we are in every way the self-consciousness of history. We enjoy differently, we suffer dif ferently: our instinctive activity is to compare an unheard-of number of things. We understand everything, we experience every thing, we no longer have in us any hostile feelings. Although we may harm ourselves by it, our importunate and almost aniorous

inquisitiveness attacks, unabashed, the most dangerous things

"Everything is good”-it requires an effort for us to deny anything. We suffer if we should happen to be so unintelligent as to take sides against anything Fundamentally, it is we scholars who today best fulfill the teaching of Christ

219 (1885-1886) Irony against those who believe Christianity has been over come by the modern natural sciences, Christian value judgments have not by any means been overcome this way. "Christ on the cross" is the most sublime symbol—even today.

220 (Nov. 1887-March 1888)

The two great nihilistic movements: (a) Buddhism, (b) Christianity. The latter has only now attained to approximately the state of culture in which it can fulfill its original vocation-a level to which it belongs in which it can show itself pure.

221 (Nov, 1887-March 1888)

We have recovered the Christian ideal: it remains to determine its value:

www.

God, the faith in God, matter to us any longer? 'God' today merely a faded word, not even a concept any longer!) But as Voltaire says on his deathbed: 'only don't speak of that man there!'

(p129) 1. What values are negated by it? What does its counterideal comprise?— Pride, pathos of distance, great responsibility, exuber ance, splendid animality, the instincts that delight in war and con quest, the deification of passion, of revenge, of cunning, of anger, of voluptuousness, of adventure, of knowledge the noble ideal is negated: the beauty, wisdom, power, splendor and dangerous ness of the type "man"; the man who fixes goals, the "man of the future" (here Christianity appears as a logical consequence of Judaism ).

2. Can it be realized? — Yes, under the right climatic con ditions, as the Indian ideal was. Work is missing in both.— It detaches the individual from people, state, cultural community, jurisdiction; it rejects education, knowledge, cultivation of good manners, gain, commerce—it lets everything go that comprises the usefulness and value of man-it shuts him off by means of an idiosyncrasy of feeling. Unpolitical, antinational, neither aggressive nor defensive-possible only within the most firmly ordered political and social life, which allows these holy parasites to pro liferate at public expense

3. It is a consequence of the will to pleasure and to nothing else! "Blessedness" counts as something self-evident, which no longer requires any justification everything else (how to live and let live) is only a means to an end

But this way of thinking is base: fear of pain, of defilement, of corruption as a sufficient motive for letting everything go This is a wretched way of thinking--- Sign of an exhausted race One should not let oneself be deceived. ("Become as little chil dren"- of related nature: Francis of Assisi, neurotic, epileptic, a visionary, like Jesus.)

222 (Nov. 1887-March 1888)

The higher man is distinguished from the lower by his fear lessness and his readiness to challenge misfortune: it is a sign of degeneration when eudaemonistic valuations begin to prevail (-physiological fatigue, feebleness of will—). Christianity, with its perspective of "blessedness," is a mode of thought typical of a suffering and feeble species of man. Abundant strength wants to create, suffer, go under: the Christian salvation-for-bigots is bad music to it, and its hieratic posture an annoyance.



(p130)





223 (1885-1886) Poverty, humility, and chastity-dangerous and slanderous ideals, but, like poisons in the case of certain illnesses, useful cures, e.g., in the Roman imperial era.

All ideals are dangerous: because they debase and brand the actual; all are poisons, but indispensable as temporary cures.

224 (Nov. 1887-March 1888)

God created man happy, idle, innocent, and immortal: our actual life is a false, decayed, sinful existence, an existence of punishment- Suffering, struggle, work, death are considered as objections and question marks against life, as something that ought not to last; for which one requires a cure--and has a cure!

From the time of Adam until now, man has been in an abnormal state: God himself has sacrificed his son for the guilt of Adam, in order to put an end to this abnormal state: the natural character of life is a curse; Christ gives back the state of normality to him who believes in him: he makes him happy, idle and inno cent.-- But the earth has not begun to be fruitful without work; women do not bear children without pain; sickness has not ceased; the most devout believers have just as hard a time of it here as the least devout unbelievers. That man has been freed from death and sin (assertions which permit of no verification) -has been asserted by the church with all the more emphasis. "He is free from sin" — not through his own deed, not through a stern struggle on his part, but ransomed for freedom through the act of redemption-conse

quently perfect, innocent, paradisiacal

The true life is only a faith (i.e., a self-deception, a madness). The whole of struggling, battling, actual existence, full of splendor and darkness, only a bad, false existence: the task is to be redeemed from it.

"Man innocent, idle, immortal, happy"—this conception of "supreme desiderata" must be criticized above all. Why are guilt, work, death, suffering (and, from a Christian viewpoint, knowl edge ) contrary to the supreme desiderata?- The lazy Christian concepts "blessedness," "innocence," "immortality" —

(p131)

225 (Nov. 1887-March 1888)

The eccentric concept of "holiness" is lacking--"God" and "man” have not been torn asunder. "Miracles" are lacking--this sphere simply isn't there: the only sphere worth consideration is the "spiritual” (i.e., the symbolic-psychological). As decadence: pendant to "epicureanism". Paradise, as conceived by the Greeks, also only the "garden of Epicurus."

Any task is lacking in such a life:-- it desires nothing; a form of the "Epicurean gods;" all reason is lacking to set up any further goals, to have children:- everything has been attained.

226 (March-June 1888)

They despised the body: they left it out of the account: more, they treated it as an enemy. It was their delusion to believe that one could carry a "beautiful soul" about in a cadaverous abor

tion- To make this conceivable to others they needed to present the concept "beautiful soul" in a different way, to revalue the natural value, until at last a pale, sickly, idiotically fanatical crea ture was thought to be perfection, "angelic," transfiguration, higher man.

227 (Jan.-Fall 1888)

Ignorance in psychologicis the Christian bas no nervous sys tem-; contempt for, and a deliberate desire to disregard the demands of the body, the discovery of the body; the presupposition that this is in accordance with the higher nature of man, that it must necessarily be good for the soul; the systematic reduction of all bodily feelings to moral values; illness itself conceived as morally conditioned, perhaps as punishment or as testing or also as a state of salvation in which man becomes more perfect than he could be if he were healthy (Pascal's idea); under certain circumstances, making oneself sick deliberately.

228 (1883-1888)

What, then, is this struggle of the Christian "against nature"? Do not let us be deceived by his words and explanations! It is



(p132)



 nature against something that is also nature. With many it is fear, with some disgust, with others a certain spirituality, with the best, love of an ideal without flesh and desires, of an "abstraction from nature”--these try to live up to their ideal. It goes without saying that humility in place of self-reliance, anxious circumspection toward the desires, liberation from normal duties (whereby a higher feeling of rank is re-created), the incitement of a continual war over tremendous things, habituation to effusions of feeling all this composes a type: in this type the excitability of a degenerate body predominates, but this nervousness and the inspirations it induces are interpreted otherwise. The taste of natures of this kind tends (1) to subtlety, (2) to floweriness, (3) to extreme feelings.

Natural inclinations are satisfied, but under a new form of interpretation, e.g., as "justification before God," "the feeling of redemption through grace" (every undeniable pleasant feeling is interpreted thus! ), pride, voluptuousness, etc.

General problem: what will become of the man who defames' the natural, and denies and degrades it in practice? In fact, the Christian proves himself to be an exaggerated form of self-control: in order to restrain his desires he seems to find it necessary to extirpate or crucify them.

229 (March-June 1888)

Through the long succession of millennia, man has not known himself physiologically: he does not know himself even today. To know, e.g., that one has a nervous system (-but no "soul"-) is still the privilege of the best informed. But man is not content not to know in this case, One must be very humane to say "I don't know that," to afford ignorance.

If he is suffering or in a good mood, he has no doubt that he can find the reason for it if only he looks. So he looks for the reason-. In truth, he cannot find the reason, because he does not even suspect where he ought to look for it-- What happens? He takes a consequence of his condition for its cause; e.g., a work undertaken in a good mood (really undertaken because the good mood had provided the courage for it) succeeds: ecco, the work is the reason for the good mood. In fact, the success was deter mined by the same thing that determined the good mood—by the happy coordination of physiological forces and systems,

133

BOOK TWO: Critique of Highest Values He feels ill: and consequently he has not got over some worry, some scruple, some self-criticism.-- In truth, the man believes his ill condition is a consequence of his scruple, his "sin," his "self criticism"

But the condition of recovery returns, often after a profound exhaustion and prostration. "How is it possible for me to feel so free, so redeemed? It is a miracle; only a god can have performed that."- Conclusion: "He has forgiven me my sin"—

From this there follows a certain practice: to excite feelings of sin, to prepare the way for contrition, one has to reduce the body to a morbid and nervous condition. The method of doing this is well known. As one might expect, there is no suspicion of the causal logic of the case: there is a religious interpretation of the mortification of the flesh, it seems an end in itself, whereas it is only a means of making possible the morbid indigestion of repentance (the "idée fixe" of sin, the hypnotizing of the hen by the chalk line "sin").

The maltreatment of the body prepares the ground for the sequence of "feelings of guilt," i.e., a general state of suffering that demands an explanation

On the other hand, the method of "redemption" follows in the same way: one provokes all kinds of orgies of feeling by prayers, motions, gestures, oaths exhaustion follows, often abruptly, often in the form of epilepsy. And after a condition of deep somnolence comes the appearance of recovery—in religious language: "redemp tion."40a

230 (Jan.-Fall 1888)

Formerly one considered these conditions and consequences of physiological exhaustion more important than conditions of health and their consequences, because they are rich in the sudden, the fearful, the inexplicable and the incalculable. One was afraid: one postulated here a higher world. Sleep and dream, shadows, the night, natural terrors, have been held responsible for the creation of two worlds: above all, the symptoms of physiological exhaustion should have been considered in this regard. The ancient religions actually disciplined the pious into a condition of exhaustion in

The exhaustion is in this case a racial exhaustion: sleep, regarded psychologically, is only a symbol of a much deeper and longer compulsion to rest In practice it is death that works so seductively behind the image of its brother, sleep

The entire Christian training in repentance and redemption can be conceived as a deliberately provoked folie circulaire:41 but, as one might expect, producible only in predestined, that is, mor bidly inclined individuals.

233 (March-June 1888) Against remorse and the purely psychological treatment of it. To be unable to have done with an experience is already a sign of decadence. This reopening of old wounds, this wallowing in self-contempt and contrition, is one more illness, out of which no "salvation of the soul" can arise but only a new form of soul sickness

These "states of redemption" in the Christian are mere varia tions of one and the same diseased state-interpretations of the epileptic crisis by a certain formula supplied, not by science, but by religious delusion.

One is good in a sickly manner when one is sick- We now count the greater part of the psychological apparatus with which Christianity operated as forms of hysteria and epilepsy.

The entire practice of psychological healing must be put back

" An earlier name for manic-depressive insanity, sometimes rendered as alternating insanity.

(p135) on to a physiological basis: the "bite” of conscience as such is a hindrance to recovery-one must try to counterbalance it all by new activities, in order to escape from the sickness of self-torture as quickly as possible One should discredit the purely psycho logical practice of the church and the sects as harmful to health, One cannot cure an invalid by prayers and the exorcizing of evil spirits: the conditions of "repose" that supervene under the influ ence of such things are very far from inspiring confidence, in a psychological sense

One is healthy when one can laugh at the earnestness and zeal with which one has been hypnotized by any single detail of our life, when one feels that the "bite" of conscience is like a dog biting on a stone-when one is ashamed of one's remorse

Previous practice, which was purely religious and psycho logical, aimed only at a change in the symptoms: it held a man to be cured when he abased himself before the cross and swore to be a good man- But a criminal who with a certain sombre serious ness cleaves to his fate and does not slander his deed after it is done has more health of soul The criminals among whom Dos toevsky lived in prison were one and all unbroken natures are they not worth a hundred times more than a "broken" Christian?

(-I recommend that the "bite" of conscience be treated with Mitchell's cure42 )

234 (1883-1888) The "bite" of conscience: sign that the character is not equal to the deed. There is such a thing as a "bite" of conscience after good works: the unfamiliar in them, that which raises them out of the old milieu.—43

The "rest cure" of Dr. Silas Weir Mitchell (1829-1914, American), consisting primarily in isolation, confinement to bed, dieting, and massage. Cf. Genealogy I, section 6, where Nietzsche mentions isolation and over eating.

" With sections 233-35 compare section 10 of the first chapter of Twilight (Portable Nietzsche, p. 467): "Not to perpetrate cowardice against one's own acts! Not to leave them in the lurch afterward! The bite of conscience is indecent."

The influence of these passages and others on Sartre's The Flies is dis cussed in detail in my essay on "Nietzsche between Homer and Sartre: Five Treatments of the Orestes Story," in Révue Internationale de Philoso phie, 67 (1964.1), especially pp. 65-73.136

THL WILL TO POWER

ALLIONS,

235 (Spring-Fall 1887; rev. Spring-Fall 1888) Against remorse.-- I do not like this kind of cowardice toward one's own deeds; one should not leave oneself in the lurch at the onset of unanticipated shame and embarrassment. An extreme+4 pride, rather, is in order. After all, what is the good of it! No deed can be undone by being regretted; no more than by being "forgiven" or "atoned for." One would have to be a theo logian to believe in a power that annuls guilt: we immoralists prefer not to believe in "guilt." We hold instead that every action is of identical value at root--and that actions that turn against us may, economically considered, be nonetheless useful, generally desirable actions.

In any particular case we will allow that an act could easily have been spared us—but circumstances favored it. Which of us, if favored by circumstance, would not have gone through the entire gamut of crime?

One should never say on that account: "You should not have done this or that," but always: "How strange that I should not have done that a hundred times before!"

After all, very few actions are typical actions and real epit omes of a personality; and considering how little personality most men have, a man is seldom characterized by a single action, Acts of circumstance, merely epidermal, merely reflexes that respond to a stimulus: long before the depths of our being are touched by it, consulted about it. A rage, a reach, a knife thrust: what of per sonality is in that?45

A deed often brings with it a numbness and lack of freedom: so that the doer is as if spellbound at its recollection and feels as if he were an accessory of it. This spiritual disorder, a form of hypnotism, must be resisted at all cost: a single deed, whatever it may be, is, in comparison with everything one has done, a zero, and may be deducted without falsifying the account. The iniquitous interest that society may have in treating our entire existence from a single point of view, as if its meaning lay in bringing forth one single deed, should not infect the doer himself; unfortunately this

* This word is illegible in the MS and represents a conjecture by the German editors. See also the preceding footnote.

* Cf. Camus, The Stranger.

(p137)

happens almost all the time. That stems from the fact that a spiritual disturbance follows every deed with unusual consequences, whether these consequences are good or ill. Observe a lover who has received a promise, or a poet applauded by an audience: so far as torpor intellectualis is concerned, they differ in no way from an anarchist confronted with a search warrant.

There are actions which are unworthy of us: actions that, if regarded as typical, would reduce us to a lower class of man. Here one has only to avoid the error of regarding them as typical. There are other kinds of actions of which we are unworthy: exceptions born of a particular abundance of happiness and health, our high est floodtide driven so high for once by a storm, an accident: such actions and "works" are likewise not typical. One should never measure an artist by the standard of his works.

236 (Jan.-Fall 1888)

a. In proportion as Christianity still seems necessary today, man is still savage and fateful

b. From another point of view it is not necessary, but extremely harmful, although enticing and seductive because it cor responds to the morbid character of whole classes, whole types of contemporary. humanity-decadents of all kinds, they follow their inclinations when they aspire to Christianity

One must distinguish clearly between a. and b. In case a. Christianity is a cure, at least a means of taming ( under certain circumstances it serves to make sick; which can be useful in break ing savagery and brutality). In case b. it is itself a symptom of sickness, propagates decadence; here it works against a corroborat ing system of treatment, here it is the invalid's instinct against that which is good for him

237 (Jan.-Fall 1888)

The party of the serious, dignified, reflective: and opposed to them the savage, unclean, incalculable beast- merely a prob lem of animal taming--in which the animal tamer must be hard, fearsome and terror-inspiring toward his beasts.

All essential demands must be made with a brutal clarity, i.e., exaggerated a thousandfold:



(p138)





even the fulfilment of the demand must be represented in a coarsened way, so it may inspire awe, e.g., emancipation from the senses on the part of the Brahmins.

The struggle with the canaille and the cattle. If a certain tam ing and order is to be achieved, the chasm between these purified and reborn people and the remainder must be made as fearful as possible

This chasm increases in the higher castes their self-regard, their faith in that which they represent—hence the chandala. Con tempt and an excess of it is perfectly correct psychologically, that is to say, exaggerated a hundredfold, so that it may at least be copied. 48

238 (Jan-Fall 1888)

The struggle against the brutal instincts is different from the struggle against the sick instincts; to make sick may even be a means of mastering brutality. Christian psychological practice often leads to the conversion of a brute into a sick and consequently tame animal.

The struggle against brutal and savage natures must be a struggle using means that affect them: superstitions are indispensa ble and essential-47

239 (Nov, 1887-March 1888)

Our age is in a certain sense ripe (that is to say, decadent), as the age of Buddha was. Therefore a Christianity is possible, but without the absurd dogmas (the most repellent abortions of

antique hybridism).

240 (1885-1886)

Even granted that the Christian faith might not be disprova ble, Pascal thinks, nonetheless, that, in view of a fearful possibility that it is true, it is in the highest degree prudent to be a Christian.

The humor of European culture: one holds this to be true but does that. E.g., what is the point of the arts of reading and criti cism as long as the ecclesiastical interpretation of the Bible, Protes tant as well as Catholic, is cultivated as ever?

242 (Nov. 1887-March 1888)

One does not consider closely enough how barbarous the concepts are by which we Europeans still live. That men have been capable of believing that "salvation of the soul” depended on a book! - And they tell me this is still believed today.

What is the point of scientific education, criticism and herme neutics if such a lunatic exposition of the Bible as is still cultivated by the church has not yet turned the blush of shame into a perma Dent skin color?

243 (Spring-Fall 1887; rey. Spring-Fall 1888)

To consider: to what extent the fateful belief in divine provi dence—the most paralyzing belief for hand and reason there has



(p140)



 ever been still exists; to what extent Christian presuppositions and interpretations still live on under the formulas nature," "progress," "perfectibility," "Darwinism," under the superstitious belief in a certain relationship between happiness and virtue, unhappiness and guilt. That absurd trust in the course of things, in life," in the "instinct of life," that comfortable resignation that comes from the faith that if everyone only does his duty all will be well—this kind of thing is meaningful only by supposing a direc tion of things sub specie boni. Even fatalism, the form philosophi cal sensibility assumes with us today, is a consequence of this long belief in divine dispensation, an unconscious consequence: as if what happens were no responsbility of ours (-as though it were permissible to let things take their course: every individual self only a mode of absolute reality ).

".

.

244 (Nov. 1887-March 1888) It is the height of psychological mendaciousness in man to frame according to his own petty standard of what seems good, wise, powerful, valuable, a being that is an origin and "in-itself" -- and therewith to abolish in his mind the entire causal process by means of which any kind of goodness, any kind of wisdom, any kind of power exists and possesses value. In short, to posit elements of the most recent and contingent origin as not created but "in-themselves" and perhaps even as the cause of creation in general

Judging from experience, from every instance in which a man has raised himself significantly above the average of humanity, we see that every high degree of power involves freedom from good and evil and from strue" and "false," and cannot take into account the demands of goodness: we see that the same applies to every high degree of wisdom-goodness is abrogated in it as much as veracity, justice, virtue, and other popular fancies in valuation. Finally, every high degree of goodness itself: is it not patent that it presupposes a spiritual myopia and coarseness? in cluding the inability to distinguish at a distance between true and false, between useful and harmful? not to discuss the fact that a high degree of power in the hands of the highest degree of goodness would lead to the most calamitous consequences ("the abolition of evil") ? — In fact, one needs only to see what tendencies the

141

BOOK TWO: Critique of Highest Values "God of love" inspires in his believers: they ruin mankind for the sake of the good.” In practice, the actual constitution of the world has shown this same God to be the God of the extremest shortsightedness, devilry and impotence: which reveals how much value there is in this conception of him.

Knowledge and wisdom in themselves have no value; no more than goodness: one must first be in possession of the goal from which these qualities derive their value or nonvalue-- there could be a goal in the light of which great knowledge might repre sent a great disvalue (if, for instance, a high degree of deception were one of the prerequisites of the enhancement of life; likewise if goodness were perhaps able to paralyze and discourage the springs of the great longing) -

Taking our human life as it is, all "truth," all "goodness," all "holiness," all divinity" in the Christian style has up to now shown itself to be highly dangerous even now mankind is in danger of perishing through an idealism inimical of life.48

245 (Spring-Fall 1887)

Consider the damage all human institutions sustain if a divine and transcendent higher sphere is postulated that must first sanction these institutions. By then growing accustomed to seeing their value in this sanction (e.g., in the case of marriage), one has reduced their natural dignity; in certain circumstances denied it Nature has been ill-judged to the extent to which one has brought into honor the antinaturalness of a God. "Natural" has come to mean the same as "contemptible," "bad"

The fatefulness of a belief in God as the reality of the highest moral qualities: all actual values were therewith denied and sys tematically conceived as non-values. Thus antinaturalness as sumed the throne. With relentless logic one arrived at the absolute demand to deny nature.

246 (Jan-Fall 1888)

In moving the doctrine of selflessness and love into the fore ground, Christianity was in no way establishing the interests of

* In the MS this section follows a draft for Antichrist, section 47.



(p142)





the species, as of higher value than the interests of the individual. Its real historical effect, the fateful element in its effect, remains, on the contrary, in precisely the enhancement of egoism, of the egoism of the individual, to an extreme to the extreme of in dividual immortality). Through Christianity, the individual was made so important, so absolute, that he could no longer be sac rificed: but the species endures only through human sacrifice All "souls" became equal before God: but this is precisely the most dangerous of all possible evaluations! If one regards indi viduals as equal, one calls the species into question, one encourages a way of life that leads to the ruin of the species: Christianity is the counterprinciple to the principle of selection. If the degenerate and sick ("the Christian") is to be accorded the same value as the healthy ("the pagan"), or even more value, as in Pascal's judgment concerning sickness and health, then unnaturalness becomes law

This universal love of men is in practice the preference for the suffering, underprivileged, degenerate: it has in fact lowered and weakened the strength, the responsibility, the lofty duty to sacrifice men. All that remains, according to the Christian scheme of values, is to sacrifice oneself: but this residue of human sacrifice that Christianity.concedes, and even advises has, from the stand point of general breeding, no meaning at all. The prosperity of the species is unaffected by the self-sacrifice of this or that individual (whether it be in the monkish and ascetic manner or, with the aid of crosses, pyres, and scaffolds, as "martyrs”. of error). The species requires that the ill-constituted, weak, degenerate, perish: but it was precisely to them that Christianity turned as a conserving force; it further enhanced that instinct in the weak, already so powerful, to take care of and preserve themselves and to sustain one another. What is "virtue" and "charity" in Chris tianity if not just this mutual preservation, this solidarity of the weak, this hampering of selection? What is Christian altruism if not the mass-egoism of the weak, which divines that if all care for one another each individual will be preserved as long as possible?

If one does not feel such a disposition as an extreme im morality, as a crime against life, one belongs with the company of the sick and possesses its instincts oneself

Genuine charity demands sacrifice for the good of the species - it is hard, it is full of self-overcoming, because it needs human sacrifice. And this pseudo humaneness called Christianity wants it established that no one should be sacrificed

(p143)

247 (March-June 1888)

Nothing would be more useful or more to be encouraged than a thoroughgoing practical nihilism. As I understand all the phenomena of Christianity and pessimism, they say: "We are ripe for nonexistence; for us it is reasonable not to exist." This language of "reason" is also, in this case, the language of selective nature.

What, on the other hand, is to be condemned in the sternest terms is the ambiguous and cowardly compromise of a religion such as Christianity: more precisely, such as the church: which, instead of encouraging death and self-destruction, protects every thing ill-constituted and sick and makes it propagate itself

Problem: with what means could one attain to a severe form of really contagious nihilism: such as teaches and practices volun tary death with scientific conscientiousness ( and not a feeble, vegetable existence in expectation of a false afterlife--)?

One cannot sufficiently condemn Christianity for having de valuated the value of such a great purifying nihilistic movement, which was perhaps already being formed, through the idea of the immortal private person: likewise through the hope of resurrec tion: in short, through continual deterrence from the deed of nihilism, which is suicide

It substituted slow suicide: gradually a petty, poor, but durable life; gradually a quite ordinary, bourgeois, mediocre life,

etc.

248 (March-June 1888)

Christian moral quackery.- Pity and contempt succeed one another in quick alternation, and occasionally I get enraged, as at the sight of some mean crime. Here error is made a duty-a virtue; blundering is made into an art, the instinct for destruction systematized as "redemption"; here every operation becomes an injury, an amputation even of those organs whose energy is a precondition of any return to health. And the most that is achieved is never healing, but only the substitution of one set of evil symp toms for another

And this dangerous nonsense, this systematized disfiguring and castration of life, is counted holy, inviolable; to live in its service, to be an instrument of this healing art, to be a priest,



(p144)





makes one distinguished, venerable, makes one holy and even inviolable. Only divinity can be the author of this highest healing art; only as revelation can redemption be understood, as an art of grace, as the most undeserved gift granted to the creature.

First proposition: health of soul is regarded as sickness, as suspicious

Second proposition: the prerequisites of a strong and flourish ing life, strong desires and passions, count as objections to a strong and flourishing life.

Third proposition: all that threatens man with danger, all that might master and destroy him, is evil, is reprehensible--is to be torn from his soul by its roots.

Fourth proposition: man made harmless to himself and others, weak, prostrated in humility and modesty, conscious of his weak ness, the "sinner"- this is the most desirable type, and one that can also be produced with a little surgery to the soul

249 (Spring-Fall 1887)

What is it I protest against? That one should take this petty, peaceable mediocrity, this equilibrium of a soul that knows noth ing of the mighty motivation of great accumulations of strength, for something exalted, possibly even for the measure of man.

Bacon of Verulam says: Infimarum virtutum apud vulgus laus est, mediarum admiratio, supremarum sensus nullus. 49 Chris tianity, however, belongs, as a religion, to the vulgus: it has no feeling for the highest species of virtus.

250 (Spring-Fall 1887) Let us see what "the true Christian" does with all that which his instinct opposes:-he sullies and suspects the beautiful, the splendid, the rich, the proud, the self-reliant, the knowledgeable, the powerful in summa, the whole of culture: his object is to deprive it of a good conscience

251 (Jan.-Fall 1888)

Hitherto one has always attacked Christianity not merely in

The ordinary ruck has praise for the lowest virtues, admiration for the mediocre, and for the highest virtues no sense at all.

(p145) a modest way but in the wrong way. As long as one has not felt Christian morality to be a capital crime against life its defenders have had it all their own way. The question of the mere "truth" of Christianity-whether in regard to the existence of its God or the historicity of the legend of its origin, not to speak of Christian astronomy and natural science is a matter of secondary im portance as long as the question of the value of Christian morality is not considered. Is Christian morality worth anything, or is it a shame and digrace despite all the holiness of its arts of seduction? The problem of truth can slip away into hiding places of all kinds; and the greatest believers may finally avail themselves of the logic of the greatest unbelievers to create for themselves a right to affirm certain things as irrefutable-namely, as beyond the means of all refutation (this artifice is today called "Kantian Criticism").

252 (Nov: 1887-March 1888)

One should never forgive Christianity for having destroyed such men as Pascal. One should never cease from combating just this in Christianity: its will to break precisely the strongest and noblest souls. One should never rest as long as this one thing has not been utterly and completely destroyed: the ideal of man invented by Christianity, its demands upon men, its Yes and its No with regard to men. The whole absurd residue of Christian fable, conceptual cobweb-spinning and theology does not concern us; it could be a thousand times more absurd and we would not lift a finger against it. But we do combat the ideal that, with its morbid beauty and feminine seductiveness, with its furtive slander ous eloquence appeals to all the cowardices and vanities of wearied souls--and the strongest have their weary hours as if all that might, in such states, seem most useful and desirable trust, guilelessness, modesty, patience, love of one's fellows, resig nation, submission to God, a sort of unharnessing and abdication of one's whole ego-were also the most useful and desirable as such; as if the petty, modest abortion of a soul, the virtuous aver age-and-herd man, did not only take precedence over the stronger, more evil, covetous, defiant, prodigal, and therefore a hundred times more imperiled kind of man, but provided nothing less than the ideal, the goal, the measure, the highest desideratum for man kind in general. To erect this ideal was the most sinister tempta tion ever placed before mankind; for with it, the more strongly

.

(p146)





constituted exceptions and fortunate cases among men, in whom the will to power and to the growth of the whole type "man" took a step forward, were threatened with destruction; with the values of this ideal, the growth of these higher men, who for the sake of their superior claims and tasks also freely accept a life more full of peril (expressed economically: a rise in the cost of the undertaking in proportion to the decline in the probability of its success) would be attacked at the roots. What is it we combat in Christianity? That it wants to break the strong, that it wants to discourage their courage, exploit their bad hours and their oc casional weariness, convert their proud assurance into unease and distress of conscience, that it knows how to poison and sicken the noble instincts until their strength, their will to power turns backward, against itself-until the strong perish through orgies of self-contempt and self-abuse: that gruesome way of perishing of which Pascal provides the most famous example.



## 2 CRITIQUE OF MORALITY

### 1 Origin of Moral Valuations

253 (1885-1886)

For the Preface of The Dawnco An attempt to think about morality without falling under its spell, mistrustful of the seductiveness of its beautiful gestures and glances. A world we can revere, that is adequate to our drive to worship that continually proves itself-by providing guidance in the particular and the general : this is the Christian viewpoint in which we have all grown up.

Through an increase in our acuteness, mistrust, scientificality (also through a more ambitious instinct for veracity, thus under anti-Christian influences), this interpretation has grown more and more impermissible to us.

Subtlest way of escape: Kantian Criticism. The intellect dis putes its right to make interpretations of this sort as well as to

The first edition of The Dawn appeared in 1881; the second, with a new preface, in 1887. This heading has always been omitted so far.

.

(p147)

reject interpretations of this sort. One contents oneself with an increase in one's trust and faith, with a renunciation of all prova bility in matters of faith, with an inconceivable and superior "ideal" (God) as a stopgap.

The Hegelian way out, following Plato, a piece of roman ticism and reaction, at the same time a symptom of the historical sense, of a new strength: the "spirit" itself is the "self-revealing and self-realizing ideal": more and more of this ideal in which we believe manifests itself in the course of its "process," in "becom ing"- thus the ideal realizes itself; faith is directed into the future wheni, in accordance with its noble requirements, it can worship. In short,

1. God is unknowable for us and not demonstrable by us (the hidden meaning of the epistemological movement);

2. God is demonstrable but as something in process of be coming, and we are part of it, as witness our impulse toward the ideal (the hidden meaning of the historical movement),

*Observe; criticism is never directed at the ideal itself, but only at the problem, where the opposition to it originates: why it has not yet been achieved or why it is not demonstrable in small things and in great.

.

..

.

It makes all the difference whether one feels this state of distress as a state of distress from passion, from a yearning, or whether one barely reaches it as a problem after the utmost thought and with a certain force of historical imagination.

We discover the same phenomenon outside religion and philosophy: utilitarianism (socialism, democracy) criticizes the origin of moral evaluations, but it believes them just as much as the Christian does. (Naiveté: as if morality could survive when the God who sanctions it is missing! The "beyond" absolutely necessary if faith in morality is to be maintained.)

Basic problem: whence this omnipotence of faith? Of faith in morality? (-Which betrays itself in this, too, that even the basic conditions of life are falsely interpreted for the benefit of morality: despite our knowledge of the animal world and the world of plants. "Self-preservation": the reconciliation of altruistic and egoistic principles in the perspective of Darwinism.)



(p148)





..

254 (1885-1886) The inquiry into the origin of our evaluations and tables of the good is in absolutely no way identical with a critique of them, as is so often believed: even though the insight into some pudenda origobi certainly brings with it a feeling of a diminution in value of the thing that originated thus and prepares the way to a critical mood and attitude toward it.

What are our evaluations and moral. tables really worth? What is the outcome of their rule? For whom? in relation to what? - Answer: for life. But what is life? Here we need a new, more definite formulation of the concept "life.” My formula for it is: Life is will to power,

What is the meaning of the act of evaluation itself? Does it point back or down to another, metaphysical world? (As Kant still believed, who belongs before the great historical movement.) In short: where did it originate? Or did it not "originate"? Answer; moral evaluation is an exegesis, a way of interpreting. The exegesis itself is a symptom of certain physiological condi tions, likewise of a particular spiritual level of prevalent judg ments: Who interprets? - Our affects.

...

...

255 (1883-1888)

All virtues physiological conditions: particularly the principal organic functions considered as necessary, as good. All virtues are really refined passions and enhanced states..

Pity and love of mankind, as development of the sexual drive. Justice as development of the drive to revenge. Virtue as pleasure in resistance, will to power, Honor as recognition of the similar and equal-in-power.

256 (1887-1888)

I understand by "morality" a system of evaluations that partially coincides with the conditions of a creature's life.

* Shameful origin.

(p149)

257 (March-June 1888)

Formerly one said of every morality: "By their fruits ye shall know them." I say of every morality: "It is a fruit by which I recognize the soil from which it sprang."

258 (1885-1886)

My attempt to understand moral judgments as symptoms and sign languages which betray the processes of physiological pros perity or failure, likewise the consciousness of the conditions for preservation and growth-a mode of interpretations of the same worth as astrology, prejudices prompted by the instincts (of races, communities, of the various stages of life, as youth or decay, etc.).

Applied to the specific Christian-European morality: Our moral judgments are signs of decline, of disbelief in life, a prepara

tion for pessimism.

My chief proposition: there are no moral phenomena, there is only a moral interpretation of these phenomena. This interpre tation itself is of extra-moral origin.62

What does it mean that our interpretation has projected a contradiction into existence? Of decisive importance: behind all other other evaluations these moral evaluations stand in com mand. Supposing they were abolished, according to what would we measure then? And then of what value would be knowledge, etc., etc. ???

.

.

.

259 (1884) Insight: all evaluation is made from a definite perspective: that of the preservation of the individual, a community, a race, a state, a church, a faith, a culture.-- Because we forget that valua tion is always from a perspective, a single individual contains within him a vast confusion of contradictory valuations and con sequently of contradictory drives. This is the expression of the diseased condition in man, in contrast to the animals in which all existing instincts answer to quite definite tasks.

This contradictory creature has in his nature, however, a great method of acquiring knowledge: he feels many pros and

* Cf. section 266.



(p150)





cons, he raises himself to justice-to comprehension beyond es teeming things good and evil.

The wisest man would be the one richest in contradictions, who has, as it were, antennae for all types of men as well as his great moments of grand harmony-a rare accident even in us! A sort of planetary motion

260 (1883-1888)

"Willing": means willing an end. "An end" includes an evaluation. Whence come evaluations? Is their basis a firm norm, "pleasant" and "painful"?

But in countless cases we first make a thing painful by invest ing it with an evaluation.

The extent of moral evaluations: they play a part in almost every sense impression. Our world is colored by them.

We have invested things with ends and values: therefore we have in us an enormous fund of latent force: but by comparing values it appears that contradictory things have been accounted valuable, that many tables of value have existed (thus nothing is valuable "in itself").

Analysis of individual tables of value revealed that their erection was the erection of the conditions-often erroneous-of existence of a limited group for its preservation.

Observation of contemporary man reveals that we employ very diverse value judgments and that they no longer have any creative force--the basis, "the condition of existence," is now missing from moral judgment. It is much more superfluous, it is not nearly so painful. It becomes arbitrary. Chaos.

Who creates the goal that stands above mankind and above the individual? Formerly one employed morality for preservation: but nobody wants to preserve any longer, there is nothing to pre serve. Therefore an experimental morality: to give oneself a goal.

261 (1883-1888)

What is the criterion of a moral action? (1) its disinterested ness, (2) its universal validity, etc. But this is armchair moralizing. One must study peoples to see what the criterion is in every case, and what is expressed by it: a belief that "such a scheme of

(p151)

behavior is one of the first conditions of our existence." Immoral means "bringing destruction." Now, all the communities in which these propositions are discovered have perished: certain of these propositions have been reaffirmed again and again because every new community that arose had need of them again; e.g., "Thou shalt not steal." In ages when it was impossible to demand any feeling for the community (e.g., in the imperium Romanum), the drive was directed to "salvation of soul,” in religious language: or "the greatest happiness," in philosophical terms. For even the Greek moral philosophers no longer had any feeling for their polis. 63

262 (1888)

The necessity of false values. One can refute a judgment by proving its conditionality: the need to retain it is not thereby removed. False values cannot be eradicated by reasons any more than astigmatism in the eyes of an invalid. One must grasp the need for their existence: they are a consequence of causes which have nothing to do with reasons.

263 (1885)

To see and to demonstrate the problem of morality--that seems to me the new principal task. I deny that it has been done in previous moral philosophy.

264 (Nov. 1887-March 1888)

How false, how mendacious mankind has always been about the basic facts of its inner world! To close one's eyes to this, to speak and not to speak about that

265 (1885-1888)

There is lacking a knowledge and consciousness of the revo lutions that have already occurred in moral judgments, and of how fundamentally "evil" has several times been renamed "good." I indicated one of these displacements with the term "morality of

It is a good thing to take "right," "wrong," etc., in a definite, narrow, bourgeois sense, as in "Do right and fear no man": i.e., to do one's duty according to a definite rude scheme within which a community exists.

-Let us not think meanly of that which two thousand years of morality have bred in our spirit!

268 (Jan.-Fall 1888)

Two types of morality must not be confused: the morality with which the healthy instinct defends itself against incipient de cadence and another morality with which this very decadence defines and justifies itself and leads downwards.

The former is usually stoical, hard, tyrannical ( Stoicism itself was such a brake-shoe morality); the latter is enthusiastic, sentimental, full of secrets; it has the women and "beautiful feel ings" on its side ( primitive Christianity was such a morality).

269 (1883-1888)

To get the whole of moralizing into focus as a phenomenon. Also as a riddle. The phenomena of morality have occupied me like riddles. Today I would know how to answer the question: What does it mean that the welfare of my neighbor ought to possess for me a higher value than my own? but that my neighbor himself ought to assess the value of his welfare differently than I, that is, that he should subordinate it to my welfare? What is the meaning of that "Thou shalt," which even philosophers regard as "given"?

The apparently crazy idea that a man should esteem the actions he performs for another more highly than those he per forms for himself, and that this other should likewise, etc. (that one should call good only those actions that a man performs with an eye, not to himself, but to the welfare of another) has a mean



(p154)



 ing; namely, as the social instinct resting on the valuation that the single individual is of little account, but all individuals together are of very great account provided they constitute a community with a common feeling and a common conscience. Therefore a kind of training in looking in a certain definite direction, the will to a perspective that seeks to make it impossible to see oneself.

My idea: goals are lacking and these must be individuals'! We observe how things are everywhere: every individual is sacri ficed and serves as a tool. Go into the street and you encounter lots of "slaves." Whither? For what?

270 (Spring-Fall 1887)

How is it possible that a man has respect for himself with regard to moral values alone, that he considers everything else subordinate and of little worth compared with good, evil, improve ment, salvation of soul, etc.? e.g., Henri Fréd. Amiel.56 What is the meaning of the moral idiosyncrasy?- I mean in a psychological sense, also in a physiological sense; e.g., Pascal. That is, in cases where other great qualities were not lacking; also in the case of Schopenhauer, who obviously valued that which he did not and could not have—is it not the consequence of a merely habitual moral interpretation of actual states of pain and displeasure? is it not a definite kind of sensibility that does not understand the cause of its frequent feelings of displeasure but believes it explains them with moral hypotheses? So that even a transitory feeling of health and strength immediately appears, in the perspective of a "good conscience," to be illumined by the nearness of God, by the consciousness of redemption?--

Thus the man of moral idiosyncrasy has (1) either really acquired his worth through approximating society's model of virtue: "the good man," "the righteous"--a highly respectable condition of mediocrity: mediocre in all his abilities but decent, conscientious, solid, respected, trusty; (2) or he believes he has acquired it because he does not know how otherwise to understand all his states he is unknown to himself, so he interpretes himself in this way.

Morality as the only scheme of interpretation by which man can endure himself a kind of pride?

* Swiss philosophy professor, critic, and poet (1821-1881).

(p155)

271 (March-June 1888)

The predominance of moral values. Consequences of this predominance: the corruption of psychology, etc.; the universal fatality which follows from it. What does this predominance mean? What does it point to?

To a certain greater urgency for a definite Yes and No in this field. All kinds of imperatives have been employed to make moral values appear permanent; they have been commanded for the longest time they seem instinctive, like inner commands. Moral values reveal themselves to be conditions of the existence of society, in that they are felt to be beyond discussion. The practice, which is to say the utility, of agreement about the highest values has here acquired a kind of sanction. We observe that every means is employed to paralyze reflection and criticism in this field:- look at the attitude of Kant! not to speak of those who reject as im moral all "inquiry" here

272 (Spring-Fall 1887) My purpose: to demonstrate the absolute homogeneity of all events and the application of moral distinctions as conditioned by perspective; to demonstrate how everything praised as moral is identical in essence with everything immoral and was made possible, as in every development of morality, with immoral means and for immoral ends...; how, on the other hand, everything decried as immoral is, economically considered, higher and more essential, and how a development toward a greater fullness of life necessarily also demands the advance of immorality. "Truth" the extent to which we permit ourselves to understand this fact.

273 (1883-1888)

But don't worry: for one needs a great deal of morality to be immoral in this subtle way; I will speak in a parable:

A physiologist interested in a disease and an invalid who claims to be cured of it do not have identical interests. Let us suppose the disease is morality--for it is a disease and that we Europeans are the invalids: what subtle torment and difficulties would arise if we Europeans were at the same time inquisitive

(p156)





spectators and physiologists! Would we then really desire to be free of morality? Would we want to be? Quite apart from the question whether we could be. Whether we could be "cured." —

2. The Herd

274 (Spring-Fall 1887)

Whose will to power is morality? - The common factor in the history of Europe since Socrates is the attempt to make moral values dominate over all other values: so that they should be the guide and judge not only of life but also of (1) knowledge, (2) the arts, (3) political and social endeavors. "Improvement" the sole duty, everything else a means to it (or a disturbance, hin drance, danger: consequently to be combatted to the point of anni hilation-). A similar movement in China. A similar movement in India.

What is the meaning of this will to power on the part of moral values which has developed so tremendously on earth?

Answer:- three powers are hidden behind it: (1) the in stinct of the herd against the strong and independent; (2) the instinct of the suffering and underprivileged against the fortunate; (3) the instinct of the mediocre against the exceptional.-- Enor mous advantage possessed by this movement, however much cruelty, falseness, and narrow-mindedness have assisted it (for the history of the struggle of morality with the basic instincts of life is itself the greatest piece of immorality that has yet existed on earth--).

275 (1883-1888)

Very few manage to see a problem in that which makes our daily life, that to which we have long since grown accustomed our eyes are not adjusted to it: this seems to me to be the case especially in regard to our morality.

The problem "every man as an object for others" is the occasion of the highest honors: for himself—no!

The problem "thou shalt": an inclination that cannot ex plain itself, similar to the sexual drive, shall not fall under the general condemnation of the drives; on the contrary, it shall be their evaluation and judge!

(p157)

The problem of "equality," while we all thirst after dis stinction: here, on the contrary, we are supposed to make exactly the same demands on ourselves as we make on others. This is so insipid, so obviously crazy: but it is felt to be holy, of a higher rank, the conflict with reason is hardly noticed.

Sacrifice and selflessness as distinguishing, unconditional obe dience to morality, and the faith that one is everyone's equal before

it.

The neglect and surrender of well-being and life as distin guishing, the complete renunciation of making one's own evalua tions, and the firm desire to see everyone else renounce them too. "The value of an action is determined: everyone is subject to this valuation."

We see: an authority speaks-who speaks? One may forgive human pride if it sought to make this authority as high as possible in order to feel as little humiliated as possible under it. Therefore-God speaks!

One needed God as an unconditional sanction, with no court of appeal, as a "categorical imperator"— or, if one believed in the authority of reason, one needed a metaphysic of unity, by virtue of which this was logical

Now suppose that belief in God has vanished: the question presents itself anew: "who speaks?". My answer, taken not from metaphysics but from animal physiology: the herd instinct speaks. It wants to be master; hence its "thou shalt!” — it will allow value to the individual only from the point of view of the whole, for the sake of the whole, it hates those who detach themselves it turns the hatred of all individuals against them.

276 (1886-1887)

The whole of European morality is based upon what is use ful to the herd: the affliction of all higher, rarer men lies in this, that everything that distinguishes them enters their consciousness accompanied by a feeling of diminution and discredit, The strong points of contemporary men are the causes of their pessimistic gloom: the mediocre are, like the herd, little troubled with questions and conscience-cheerful. (On the gloominess of the strong: Pascal, Schopenhauer.)

The more dangerous a quality seems to the herd, the more thoroughly is it proscribed.



(p158)





277 (1883-1888) Morality of truthfulness in the herd. "You shall be knowable, express your inner nature by clear and constant signs--otherwise you are dangerous: and if you are evil, your ability to dissimulate is the worst thing for the herd. We despise the secret and un recognizable. Consequently you must consider yourself know able, you may not be concealed from yourself, you may not believe that you change." Thus: the demand for truthfulness presupposes the knowability and stability of the person. In fact, it is the object of education to create in the herd member a definite faith concem ing the nature of man: it first invents this faith and then demands "truthfulness."

278 (1885)

Within a herd, within any community, that is to say inter pares, 57 the overestimation of truthfulness makes good sense. Not to be deceived and consequently, as a personal point of morality, not to deceive! a mutual obligation between equals! In dealing with what lies outside, danger and caution demand that one should be on one's guard against deception: as a psychological preconditioning for this, also in dealing with what lies within. Mistrust as the source of truthfulness.

279 (1883-1888)

Toward a critique of the herd virtues.- Inertia operates (1) in trustfulness, since mistrust makes tension, observation, reflection necessary;— (2) in veneration, where the difference in power is great and submission necessary: so as not to fear, an attempt is made to love, esteem, and to interpret the disparity in power as disparity in value: so that the relationship no longer makes one rebellious;— (3) in the sense of truth. What is true? Where an explanation is given which causes us the minimum of spiritual effort (moreover, lying is very exhausting); (4) in sympathy. It is a relief to count oneself the same as others, to try to feel as they do, to adopt a current feeling: it is something passive com pared with the activity that maintains and constantly practices

67 Among equals.

(p159) the individual's right to value judgments (the latter allows of no rest); (5) in impartiality and coolness of judgment: one shuns the exertion of affects and prefers to stay detached, "objective"; (6) in integrity: one would rather obey an existing law than create a law oneself, than command oneself and others: the fear of commanding--: better to submit than to react;— (7) in toleration: the fear of exercising rights, of judging.

280 (Spring-Fall 1887)

The instinct of the herd considers the middle and the mean as the highest and most valuable: the place where the majority finds itself; the mode and manner in which it finds itself. It is therefore an opponent of all orders of rank, it sees an ascent from beneath to above as a descent from the majority to the minority. The herd feels the exception, whether it be below or above it, as something opposed and harmful to it. Its artifice with reference to the ex ceptions above it, the stronger, more powerful, wiser, and more fruitful, is to persuade them to assume the role of guardians, herdsmen, watchmen---to become its first servants:58 it has there with transformed a danger into something useful. Fear ceases in the middle: here one is never alone; here there is little room for misunderstanding; here there is equality; here one's own form of being is not felt as a reproach but as the right form of being; here contentment rules. Mistrust is felt toward the exceptions; to be an exception is experienced as guilt.

281 (March-June 1888)

When, following the instinct of the community, we make prescriptions and forbid ourselves certain actions, we quite reason ably do not forbid a mode of "being," a "disposition," but only a certain direction and application of this "being," this "disposition." But then the ideologist of virtue, the moralist, comes along and says: “God sees into the heart! What does it matter if you refrain from certain actions: you are no better for that!" Answer: My dear Sir Long-Ears-and-Virtuous, we have no desire whatever to be better, we are very contented with ourselves, all we desire is not to harm one another—and therefore we forbid certain actions

** Frederick the Great (King of Prussia from 1740 to 1786) called him self "the first servant of my state."



(p160)



 when they are directed in a certain way, namely against us, while we cannot sufficiently honor these same actions provided they are directed against enemies of the community against you, for instance. We educate our children in them; we cultivate them If we shared that “God-pleasing" radicalism that your holy madness recommends, if we were fools enough to condemn together with those actions the source of them, the "heart," the “disposition," that would mean condemning our own existence and with it its supreme prerequisite--a disposition, a heart, a passion we honor with the highest honors. By our decrees, we prevent this dispo sition from breaking out and expressing itself in an inexpedient way

-We are prudent when we make such law for ourselves, we are also moral-Have you no suspicion, however faint, what sacrifice it is costing us, how much taming, self-overcoming, severity toward ourselves it requires? We are vehement in our desires, there are times when we would like to devour each other- But the "sense of community" masters us: please note that this is almost a definition of morality.

282 (Fall 1888) The weakness of the herd animal produces a morality very similar to that produced by the weakness of the decadent: they understand one another, they form an alliance ( the great decadence religions always count on the support of the herd). In itself, there is nothing sick about the herd animal, it is even in valuable; but, incapable of leading itself, it needs a "shepherd". the priests understand that- The state is not intimate, not clan destine enough; "directing the conscience" eludes it. And that is how the herd animal has been made sick by the priest?---

283 (1883-1888)

Hatred for the privileged in body and soul: revolt of the ugly, ill-constituted souls against the beautiful, proud, joyous. Their means: inculpation of beauty, pride, joy: "there is no merit," "the danger is tremendous: one should tremble and feel ill," “natural ness is evil; it is right to oppose nature." Also "reason." (The anti natural as the higher).

Again it is the priests who exploit this condition and win the "people" over. "The sinner" in whom God has more joy than in

(p161)

the "just man." This is the struggle against "paganism" (the pang of conscience as the means of destroying harmony of soul).

The hatred of the average for the exceptional, of the herd for the independent. (Custom as true "morality."50) Turning against "egoism": only the "for another" has value. "We are all equal";— against lust for dominion, against "dominion" in general; against privilege; - against sectarians, free spirits, skeptics;- against philosophy (as opposing the tool-and-corner instinct); with philosophers themselves "the categorical impera tive," the essence of morality "universal and general."

284 (Spring-Fall 1887)

The conditions and desires that are praised: peaceable, fair, moderate, modest, reverent, considerate, brave, chaste, honest, faithful, devout, straight, trusting, devoted, sympathetic, helpful, conscientious, simple, mild, just, generous, indulgent, obedient, disinterested, unenvious, gracious, industrious

To distinguish: to what extent such qualities are conditioned as means to a definite aim and end (often an "evil" end); or as natural consequences of a dominating affect (e.g., spirituality) or expression of a state of distress, which is to say: as condition of existence (e.g., citizen, slave, woman, etc.).

Summa: they are none of them felt to be "good" for their own sake, but from the first according to the standards of society," *the herd," as means to the ends of society and the herd, as neces sary to their preservation and advancement, at the same time as the consequence of an actual herd instinct in the individual: thus in the service of an instinct which is fundamentally different from these conditions of virtue. For the herd is, in relation to the out side world, hostile, selfish, unmerciful, full of lust for dominion, mistrust, etc.

In the "shepherd" this antagonism becomes patent: he must possess opposite qualities to the herd.

Mortal enmity of the herd toward orders of rank: its instinct favors the leveller (Christ). Toward strong individuals (les souve rains) it is hostile, unfair, immoderate, immodest, impudent, in considerate, cowardly, mendacious, false, unmerciful, underhand, envious, revengeful.

** Die Sitte als eigentliche "Sirrlichkeit": mores as the essence of moral ity. Cf. section 265 above,



(p162)





285 (1884)

I teach: the herd seeks to preserve one type and defends itself on both sides, against those who have degenerated from it (crim inals, etc.) and those who tower above it. The tendency of the herd is directed toward standstill and preservation, there is nothing creative in it.

The pleasant feelings with which the good, benevolent, just man inspires us (in contrast to the tension, fear which the great, new man arouses) are our own feelings of personal security and equality: the herd animal thus glorifies the herd nature and then it feels comfortable. This judgment of comfort masks itself with fair wordsthus "morality" arises. But observe the hatred of the herd for the truthful.

286 (1883-1888)

Let one not be deceived about oneself! If one hears within oneself the moral imperative as it is understood by altruism, one belongs to the herd. If one has the opposite feeling, if one feels one's danger and abberration lies in disinterestėd and selfless actions, one does not belong to the herd.

287 (1883-1888) My philosophy aims at an ordering of rank: not at an in dividualistic morality.so The ideas of the herd should rule in the herd—but not reach out beyond it: the leaders of the herd require a fundamentally different valuation for their own actions, as do the independent, or the "beasts of prey," etc.

3. General Remarks on Morality

288 (March-June 1888)

Morality as an attempt to establish human pride. The theory of "free will" is antireligious. It seeks to create the right for man to think of himself as cause of his exalted state and actions: it is a form of the growing feeling of pride.

* Cf. section 361.

163

BOOK TWO: Critique of Highest Values Man feels his power, his "happiness," as they say: there must be "will" behind this state-otherwise it would not be his. Virtue is the attempt to set the fact of willing and having-willed before every exalted and strong feeling of happiness as a necessary ante cedent:- if the will to certain actions is regularly present in the consciousness, a feeling of power may be interpreted as its effect. This is merely a perspective of psychology: always based on the false presupposition that nothing belongs to us that we have not consciously willed. The entire theory of responsibility depends upon the naive psychology that the only cause is will and that one must be aware of having willed in order to believe in oneself as cause.

Comes the countermovement: that of the moral philos ophers, still subject to the same prejudice that one is responsible only for what one has willed. The value of man is posited as a moral value: consequently his morality must be a causa prima; 61 consequently there must be a principle in man, a "free will” as causa prima.- The idea behind it is: if man is not causa prima as will, then he is irresponsible consequently he has no business before the moral tribunal-virtue and vice would be automatic

and mechanical

In summa: so that man may respect himself he must be capable of doing evil.

289 (March-June 1888)

Play-acting as a consequence of the morality of "free will." It is a step in the development of the feeling of power itself to have caused one's own exalted states (one's perfection) - consequently, one immediately concludes, to have willed them

(Critique: All perfect acts are unconscious and no longer subject to will; consciousness is the expression of an imperfect and often morbid state in a person. Personal perfection as conditioned by will, as consciousness, as reasoning with dialectics, is a carica ture, a kind of self-contradiction- A degree of consciousness makes perfection impossible Form of play-acting.)

290 (Spring-Fall 1887)

The moral hypothesis with the object of justifying God was:

$1 First cause.



(p164)



 evil must be voluntary (merely so that the voluntariness of good ness can be believed in), and on the other hand: the object of evil and suffering is salvation.

The concept "guilt" as not extending back to the ultimate ground of existence, and the concept "punishment" as an educative benefit, consequently as the act of a good God.

Absolute dominion of moral valuation over all others: one did not doubt that God could not be evil and could not do any thing harmful, i.e., by "perfection" one meant merely a moral perfection.

291 (March-June 1888)

How false is the idea that the value of an action must depend upon that which preceded it in consciousness! And morality has been judged according to this, even criminality

The value of an action must be judged by its consequences say the Utilitarians to judge it by its origins implies an impossi bility, namely that of knowing its origins.

But does one know its consequences? For five steps ahead, perhaps. Who can say what an action will stimulate, excite, pro voke? As a stimulus? Perhaps as a spark to touch off an explo sion?- The Utilitarians are naive And in any case we must first know what is useful: here too they look only five steps ahead. They have no conception of the grand economy, which cannot do without evil.

One does not know the origin, one does not know the conse quences:- does an action then possess any value at all?

The action itself remains: its epiphenomena in consciousness, the Yes and the No that follow its performance: does the value of an action lie in its subjective epiphenomena? (that would be like assessing the value of the music according to the pleasure or displeasure it gives us-it gives its composer-). Obviously value feelings accompany it, a feeling of power, compulsion, impo tence; e.g., freedom, ease-put in another way: could one reduce the value of an action to physiological values: whether it is the expression of a complete or an inhibited life?02_ It may be that

62 In all editions the immediately following words in the MS have been omitted: "is it permitted to measure its value according to epiphenomena, such as pleasure and displeasure, the play of the affects, the feeling of dis charges, explosion, freedom...." Also the following words at the end of

(p165)

its biological value is expressed in this

If therefore an action can be evaluated neither by its origin, nor by its consequences, nor by its epiphenomena, then its value is "x," unknown

292 (Spring-Fall 1887)

On the denaturalization of morality. To separate the action from the man; to direct hatred or contempt against the "sin"; to believe there are actions that are good or bad in themselves.93

Restoration of "nature": an action in itself is perfectly devoid of value: it all depends on who performs it. One and the same "crime" can be in one case the greatest privilege, in another a stigma. In fact, it is the selfishness of the judges which interprets an action, or its performer, in relation to its utility or harmfulness to themselves ( or in relation to its similarity or unlikeness to them).

293 (March-June 1888)

The concept "reprehensible action" presents us with difficul ties. Nothing that happened at all can be reprehensible in itself: for one should not want to eliminate it: for everything is so bound up with everything else, that to want to exclude something means to exclude everything. A reprehensible action means: a repre hended world

And then further: in a reprehended world reprehending would also be reprehensible — And the consequence of a way of thinking that reprehended everything would be a way of living that affirmed everything If becoming is a great ring, then everything is equally valuable, eternal, necessary. In all correlations of Yes and No, of preference and rejection, love and hate, all that is expressed is a perspective, an interest of certain types of life: in itself, every thing that is says Yes.

294 (Jan.-Fall 1888)

Critique of subjective value feelings.

The conscience. For

BE

this section: "In sum, in the language of the church hymn: 'crawl, fly, and creep upon God's ways (Kreuch, fleuch und schleich auf Gottes Wegen).'"

43 Thus in the M$. In all editions: "It is a denaturalization of morality

to...."

(p166)





merly one concluded: the conscience reprehends this action; consequently this action is reprehensible. In fact, the conscience reprehends an action because it has been reprehended for a long time. It merely repeats: it creates no values. That which in the past decided to reprehend certain actions was not conscience: but the insight into (or the prejudice against) their consequences

The assent of the conscience, the pleasant feeling of "at peace with oneself," is of the same order as the pleasure of an artist in his work-it proves nothing at all

Self-contentment is as little a standard for that to which it relates as its absence is an argument against the value of a thing. We do not know nearly enough to be able to measure the value of our actions: in addition, it is impossible for us to be objective about them: even when we reprehend an action, we are not judges but interested parties.

If noble agitation accompanies an action, this proves noth ing about its value: an artist can go through the highest possible pathos of passion and bring forth something wretched. One should say rather that these agitations are a means of seduction: they Iure our eyes, our strength away from criticism, from caution, from suspicion, so that we perpetrate a stupidity they make us stupid

295 (1885-1886)

We are the heirs of the conscience-vivisection and self-cruci fixion of two millennia: in these we have had longest practice, in these lies our mastery perhaps, certainly our subtlety; we have conjoined the natural inclinations and a bad conscience.

A reverse attempt would be possible: to conjoin the unnatural inclinations, I mean the inclination for the beyond, for things con trary to sense, reason, nature, in short all previous ideals, which were all world-slandering ideals, with a bad conscience.

296 (Spring-Fall 1887)

The great crimes in psychology:

1. that all displeasure, all misfortune has been falsified with the idea of wrong (guilt). (Pain has been robbed of innocence);

2. that all strong feelings of pleasure (wild spirits, voluptu ousness, triumph, pride, audacity, knowledge, self-assurance and

(p167)

happiness as such) have been branded as sinful, as a seduction, as suspicious;

3. that feelings of weakness, inward acts of cowardice, lack of courage for oneself have been overlaid with sanctifying names and taught as being desirable in the highest degree;

4. that everything great in man has been reinterpreted as selflessness, as self-sacrifice for the sake of something else, some one else, that even in the man of knowledge, even in the artist, depersonalization has been presented as the cause of the greatest knowledge and ability;

5. that love has been falsified as surrender (and altruism), while it is an appropriation or a bestowal following from a super abundance of personality. Only the most complete persons can love; the depersonalized, the "objective," are the worst lovers (-one has only to ask the girls!) This applies also to love of God or of "fatherland"; one must be firmly rooted in oneself. (Egoism as ego-morphism, altruism as alter-ation.64

6. Life as punishment (happiness as temptation); the pas sions as devilish, confidence in oneself as godless.

This whole psychology is a psychology of prevention, a kind of immuring out of fear; on one hand the great masses (the under privileged and mediocre) seek to defend themselves by means of it against the stronger (-and to destroy them in their develop ment-), on the other all the drives through which they best prosper, sanctified and alone held in honor. Compare the Jewish priesthood.

297 (Spring-Fall 1887)

The vestiges of debasement of nature through moral tran scendence: value of selflessness, cult of altruism; belief in repay ment within the play of consequences; belief in "goodness," in "genius" even, as if the one and the other were consequences of selflessness; the continuance of the ecclesiastical sanction of bour geois life; absolute desire to misunderstand history (as an educative work toward moralization) or pessimism in the face of history (-the latter as much a consequence of the debasement of nature as that pseudo justification, as that not desiring to see that which the pessimist sees ).

"Morality for morality's sake"-an important step in its denaturalization: it itself appears as the ultimate value. In this phase it has permeated religion: e.g., in Judaism. And there is likewise a phase in which it separates itself again from religion and in which no God is "moral" enough for it: it then prefers the impersonal ideal - This is the case at present.

"Art for art's sake"- this is an equally dangerous principle: therewith one introduces a false antithesis into things-it culmi pates in a defamation of reality ("idealization" into the ugly). If one severs an ideal from reality one debases the real, one impov erishes it, one defames it. "The beautiful for the sake of the beautiful," "the true for the sake of the true," "the good for the sake of the good"---these are three forms of evil eye for the real.

-Art, knowledge, morality are means; instead of recogniz ing in them the aim of enhancing life, one has associated them with the antithesis of life, with "God"-also as the revelation of a higher world which here and there looks down upon us through them

"Beautiful and ugly," "true and false," "good and evil these distinctions and antagonisms betray certain conditions of existence and enhancement, not only of man but of any kind of firm and enduring complex which separates itself from its adver sary. The war that is thus created is the essential element; as a means of separation that strengthens isolation

I might designate the tendency of these reflections as moral istic naturalism: my task is to translate the apparently emancipated and denatured moral values back into their nature-i.e., into their natural "immorality."

4. How Virtue Is Made to Dominate

304 (Nov. 1887-March 1888)

Of the ideal of the moralists.66 This treatise deals with the grand politics of virtue. It is intended for the use of those whose interest must lie in learning, not how one becomes virtuous, but how one makes virtuous—how virtue is made to dominate. I even intend to prove that to desire the one--the domination of virtue— one absolutely must not desire the other; one automatically renounces becoming virtuous oneself. This is a great sacrifice: but such a goal is perhaps sufficient reward for such a sacrifice. And for even greater sacrifices! — And some of the most famous moral ists have risked as much. For they had already recognized and anticipated the truth, which is in this treatise to be taught for the first time, that one can achieve the domination of virtue only by the same means as those by which one can achieve domination of any kind, in any case not by means of virtue

This treatise, as already stated, deals with the politics of virtue: it posits an ideal of these politics, it describes them as they would have to be, if anything on this earth could be perfect. Now, no philosopher will be in any doubt as to the type of per fection in politics; that is Machiavellianism, But Machiavellianism pur, sans mélange, cru, vert, dans toute sa force, dans toute son apreté,07 is superhuman, divine, transcendental, it will never be achieved by man, at most approximated. Even in this narrower kind of politics, in the politics of virtue, the ideal seems never to have been achieved. Even Plato barely touched it. One discovers, if one has eyes for hidden things, traces in even the most uopreju

* In the MS this section begins: "Of great things one should not speak at all or speak with greatness: with greatness i.e., cynically and with inno cence."

In the standard editions these words are omitted, obviously to avoid duplication of the section the German editors placed at the beginning of The Will to Power. Schlechta ignores 1911 (p. 503) and reproduces the printed versions, not the text of the MS.

Plainly, this is a draft Nietzsche rejected. And it should be compared with Twilight, Chapter VII, section 5 (Portable Nietzsche, pp. 509-511), and, e.g., section 142 above.

(p171) diced and conscious moralists (and that is indeed the name for such politicians of morality, for every kind of founder of new moral forces) that show that they too have paid their tribute to human weakness. They all aspired, at least when they were weary, to virtue for themselves: first and capital error for a moralist who must as such be an immoralist in practice. That he must not appear to be so is another matter. Or rather, it is not another matter: such a fundamental self-denial (in moral terms, dissimula tion) is part of the canon of the moralist and his most specific duties: without it he will never attain to his kind of perfection. Freedom from morality, also from truth, for the sake of that goal that outweighs every sacrifice: for the sake of the domination of virtue—that is the canon. Moralists need the gestures of virtue, also the gestures of truth; their error begins only when they yield to virtue, when they lose domination over virtue, when they themselves become moral, become true. A great moralist is, among other things, necessarily a great actor; his danger is that his dis simulation may unintentionally become nature, while it is his ideal to keep his esse and his operari48 in a divine way apart; every thing he does must be done sub specie boni69__a high, remote, exacting ideal! A divine ideal! And indeed, it is said that the moralist imitates in that no less a model than God himself: God, the greatest of all immoralists in practice, who nonetheless knows how to remain what he is, the good God

The WILL TO POWER

307 (Spring-Fall 1887)

He who knows how all fame originates will be mistrustful even of the fame virtue enjoys.

308 (Spring-Fall 1887)

Morality is just as "immoral" as any other thing on earth; morality is itself a form of immorality

The great liberation this insight brings. Contradiction is re moved from things, the homogeneity of all events is saved

309 (Nov. 1887-March 1888)

There are those who go looking for immorality. When they judge: "This is wrong," they believe one should abolish and change it. I, on the contrary, cannot rest as long as I am not yet clear about the immorality of a thing. When I unearth it I recover my equanimity.

310 (Spring-Fall 1887) a. The paths to power: to introduce a new virtue under the name of an old one-to excite "interest" in it ("happiness" as its consequence and vice versa)--the art of slandering what stands in its way—to exploit advantages and accidents for its glorification --to turn its followers into fanatics by means of sacrifice and separation;-grand symbolism.

b. Power attained: (1) virtue as force; (2) virtue as seduc tion; (3) virtue as (court) etiquette.

311 (Spring-Fall 1887)

By which means does a virtue come to power?- By exactly the same means as a political party: the slandering, inculpation, undermining of virtues that oppose it and are already in power, by rebaptizing them, by systematic persecution and mockery. Therefore: through sheer "immorality."

What does a desire do with itself to become a virtue? Rebaptism; systematic denial of its objectives; practice in self

173

(p312) (Spring-Fall 1887; rev. Spring-Fall 1888)

Cruelty has been refined to tragic pity, so that it is denied the name of cruelty. In the same way sexual love has been refined to amour-passion; the slavish disposition to Christian obedience; wretchedness to humility; a pathological condition of the nervus sympathicus, e.g., to pessimism, Pascalism, or Carlylism, etc.

313 (March-June 1888)

It would arouse doubts in us concerning a man if we heard he needed reasons for remaining decent: certainly, we would avoid him. The little word "for" can be compromising in certain cases; one can even refute oneself now and then with a single "for.971 Now, if we hear further that such an aspirant to virtue needed bad reasons for remaining respectable, this would be no reason for us to feel an increased respect for him. But he goes further, he comes to us and tells us to our face: "Unbeliever, you are dis turbing my morality with your unbelief; as long as you do not believe in my bad reasons, which is to say in God, in a punish ment in the beyond, in freedom of will, you hamper my virtue-- Moral: unbelievers must be abolished: they hamper the moraliza tion of the masses."

314 (Nov. 1887-March 1888)

Our most sacred convictions, the unchanging elements in our supreme values, are judgments of our muscles.

315 (Spring-Fall 1887)

Morality in the valuation of races and classes. In view of the fact that the affects and fundamental drives in every race and

"Cf. The Antichrist, section 45.



(p174)





class express something of the conditions of their existence ( at least of the conditions under which they have prevailed for the longest time), to desire that they should be "virtuous" means:

that they change their character, shed their skin and blot out their past:

means that they should cease to be distinct:

means that they should begin to resemble one another in their needs and demands-more clearly: that they should perish

The will to a single morality is thereby proved to be a tyranny over other types by that type whom this single morality fits: it is a destruction or a leveling for the sake of the ruling type (whether to render the others no longer fearsome or to render them useful). "Abolition of slavery'_supposedly a tribute to "human dignity," in fact a destruction of a fundamentally different type (the undermining of its values and happiness ).

The qualities in which an opposing race or class is strong are interpreted as its most evil, worst qualities; for it is with those that it can harm us (-its "virtues" are defamed and rebaptized.-).

It counts as an objection against a man or people if they harm us; but from their point of view we are desirable, because we are such as one can make use of.

The demand for "humanization" (which quite naively believes itself to possess the formula for "what is human?") is a tartuffery, behind which a quite definite type of man seeks to attain domina tion: more exactly, a quite definite instinct, the herd instinct. "Human equality": which is concealed behind the tendency to make men more and more alike.

"Interestedness" with reference to communal morality. (Anti fice: to transform the great passions of lust for power and posses sions into protectors of virtue).

To what extent all kinds of businessmen and the avaricious, all who have to give and claim credit, find it necessary to become more and more alike in character and in conception of value: world trade and exchange of every kind extorts and, as it were, buys virtue.

The same applies to the state and to every kind of rule by means of officials and soldiers; likewise science, in order to work in security and with economy of its forces.-- Likewise the priest hood.

Here, therefore, a communal morality is enforced because it procures an advantage; and to make it victorious, war and force

(p175)

are practiced against immorality--with what "right"? With no right whatever: but in accordance with the instinct for self-preser vation. These same classes make use of immorality when it serves their purpose.

316 (Spring-Fall 1887)

The hypocritical show with which all civil institutions are whitewashed, as if they were products of morality-e.g., marriage; work; one's profession; the fatherland; the family; order; law. But since they are one and all founded on the most mediocre type of man, as protection against exceptions and exceptional needs, it is only to be expected that they are full of lies.

317 (Spring-Fall 1887; rev. Spring-Fall 1888) One should defend virtue against the preachers of virtue: they are its worst enemies. For they teach virtue as an ideal for everyone; they take from virtue the charm of rareness, inimitable Dess, exceptionalness and unaverageness—its aristocratic magic. One should also take a stand against the obdurate idealists who eagerly knock on all vessels and are satisfied when they ring hollow: what naiveté to demand the great and rare and then to establish, with rage and misanthropy, that they are absent. It is obvious, e.g., that a marriage is worth as much as those whom it joins together, i.e., that in general it will be something wretched and inept: no priest, no mayor can make anything else of it.

Virtue has all the instincts of the average man against it: it is unprofitable, imprudent, it isolates; it is related to passion and not very accessible to reason; it spoils the character, the head, the mind according to the standards of mediocre men; it rouses to enmity toward order, toward the lies that are concealed in every order, institution, actuality-it is the worst of vices, if one judges it by its harmful effect upon others.

-I recognize virtue in that (1) it does not desire to be recog nized; (2) it does not presuppose virtue everywhere, but precisely something else; (3) it does not suffer from the absence of virtue, but on the contrary regards this as the distancing relationship on the basis of which there is something to honor in virtue; it does not communicate itself; (4) it does not propagandize (5) it permits no one to judge it, because it is always virtue for itself;

(p176)





(6) it does precisely all that is generally forbidden: virtue, as I understand it, is the real vetitum?? within all herd legislation; (7) in short, it is virtue in the style of the Renaissance, virtù, moraline-free virtue.78

318 (Spring-Fall 1887)

Above all, gentlemen of virtue, you are not our superiors: we should like you to be a little more modest: it is a miserable self-interest and prudence that suggests your virtue to you. And if you had more strength and courage in you, you would not reduce yourselves to virtuous nonentities in this way. You make what you can of yourselves: partly what you must—what your circumstances force you to, partly what gives you pleasure, partly what seems useful to you. But if you do only what is in keeping with your inclinations, or what necessity demands of you, or what is useful to you, then you should neither praise yourselves nor let others praise you! One is a thoroughly small type of man if one is only virtuous; do not be misled about that! Men who have been in any way notable were never such virtuous asses: their innermost instinct, that of their quantum of power, did not find satisfaction that way: while, with your minimum of power, nothing can seem wiser to you than virtue. But you have numbers on your side; and in so far as you play the tyrant, we shall make war on you

319 (Spring-Fall 1887)

A virtuous man is a lower species because he is not a "per son" but acquires his value by conforming to a pattern of man that is fixed once and for all. He does not possess his value apart: he can be compared, he has his equals, he must not be an individual

Reckon up the qualities of the good man: why do they give us pleasure? Because we have no need to fight against them, be cause they impose upon us no mistrust, no need for caution, no marshalling of forces and severity: our laziness, good nature, frivolity, have a good time. It is this pleasant feeling in us that

72 What is forbidden.

"The coinage of a man who neither smoked nor drank coffee; cf. The Antichrist, section 2.

(p177)

we project out of us and bestow upon the good man as a quality, as a value.

320 (1888)

Virtue is under certain circumstances merely an honorable form of stupidity: who could be ill-disposed toward it on that account? And this kind of virtue has not been outlived even today. A kind of sturdy peasant simplicity, which, however, is possible in all classes and can be encountered only with respect and a smile, believes even today that everything is in good hands, namely in the "hands of God"; and when it maintains this proposition with the same modest certainty as it would that two and two make four, we others certainly refrain from contradicting. Why disturb this pure foolishness? Why darken it with our worries about man, people, goal, future? And even if we wanted to do it, we could not. They project their own honorable stupidity and goodness into the heart of things (the old God, deus myops,74 still lives among them!); we others—we read something else into the heart of things: our own enigmatic nature, our contradictions, our deeper, more painful, more mistrustful wisdom.

321 (Spring-Fall 1887; rev. Spring-Fall 1888)

He who finds virtue easy also laughs at it. It is impossible to maintain seriousness in virtue: one attains it and leaps beyond it

--whither? into devilry.

In the meantime, how intelligent all our wicked tendencies and impulses have become! how much scientific inquisitiveness plagues them! So many fishhooks of knowledge!

322 (Spring-Fall 1887)

-To associate vice so closely with something decidedly pain ful that at last one flees from vice in order to be rid of that which is associated with it. This is the famous case of Tannhäuser.

323 (Spring-Fall 1887) The patrons of virtue.-- Avarice, lust to rule, laziness, sim plicity, fear: all have an interest in the cause of virtue: that is why it stands so firm.

324 (Spring-Fall 1887)

Virtue is no longer believed in, its power of attraction is gone; to restore it, someone would have to know how to take it to market as an unfamiliar form of adventure and excess. It demands too much extravagance and narrow-mindedness of its believers not to have the conscience against it today. To be sure, precisely that may constitute its new charm for unconscionable and totally unscrupu lous people:- it is now what it never was before, a. vice.

325 (Jan-Fall 1888)

Virtue is still the most expensive vice: it should remain so!

326 (1883-1888)

Virtues are as dangerous as vices in so far as one lets them rule over one as authorities and laws from without and does not first produce them out of oneself, as one should do, as one's most personal self-defense and necessity, as conditions of precisely our own existence and growth, which we recognize and acknowledge independently of whether other men grow with us under similar or different conditions. This law of the dangerousness of imperson ally understood, objective virtue applies also to modesty: many of the choicest spirits perish through it. The morality of modesty is the worst form of softening for those souls for which it makes sense that they should become hard in time,

327 (Spring-Fall 1887)

One should reduce and limit the realm of morality step by step: one should bring to light and honor the names of the instincts

(p179)

that are really at work here after they have been hidden for so long beneath hypocritical names of virtue; out of respect for one's "honesty," which speaks more and more imperiously, one should unlearn the shame that would like to deny and lie away one's natural instincts. It is a measure of strength how far one can divest oneself of virtue; and a height can be imagined where the concept "virtue" is so understood that it sounds like virtù, Renaissance virtue, moraline-free virtue.75 But in the meantime-how distant we are from this ideal!

The reduction of the domain of morality: a sign of the progress of this ideal. Wherever one has not yet been capable of causal thinking, one has thought morally.

328 (Spring-Fall 1887; rev. Spring-Fall 1888)

In the end; what have I achieved? Let us not hide from our selves this most curious result: I have imparted to virtue a new charm--the charm of something forbidden. It has our subtlest honesty against it, it is spiced "cum grano salis"78 of the sting of scientific conscience; it smells old-fashioned and antique, so that at last it lures the refined and makes them inquisitive-in short, it appears as a vice. Only after we have recognized everything as lies and appearance do we regain the right to this fairest of false hoods, virtue. There is no court of appeal left that could deny it to us: only by exhibiting virtue as a form of immorality do we again justify it-it is classified and compared with reference to its fundamental significance, it is part of the fundamental im morality of all existence as a form of luxury of the first order, the haughtiest, dearest and rarest form of vice. We have removed its scowl and its cowl, we have rescued it from the importunity of the many, we have taken from it its absurd rigidity, its vacant expression, its stiff false hair, its hieratic muscular system,

329 (Spring-Fall 1887; rey, 1888)

be: one cannot serve a cause better than by persecuting it and hunting it down - This is what I have done.77

5. The Moral Ideal

A. Critique of Ideals

330 (1886-1887)

To tackle this in such a way as to abolish the word "ideal": critique of desiderata.

331 (1883-1888)

Very few are clear as to what the standpoint of desirability, every "thus it should be but is not" or even "thus it should have been," comprises: a condemnation of the total course of things. For in this course nothing exists in isolation; the smallest things bear the greatest, upon your little wrongful act stands the entire structure of the future, every critique of the smallest thing also condemns the whole. Now, granted that the moral norm, even as Kant understood it, has never been completely fulfilled and remains suspended over actuality as a kind of beyond without ever falling down into it, then morality would contain a judgment concerning the whole, which, however, still permits the question: whence does it derive the right to this judgment? How does the part come to sit as judge over the whole

And if this moral judging and dissatisfaction with actuality were in fact, as has been suggested, an ineradicable instinct, might this instinct not be one of the ineradicable stupidities and im modesties of our species?

But in saying this we do that which we censure; the stand point of desirability, of unauthorized playing-the-judge, is part of the character of the course of things, as is every injustice and imperfection-it is precisely our concept of "perfection" which is never satisfied. Every drive that desires to be satisfied expresses its dissatisfaction with the present state of things: what? is the whole perhaps composed of dissatisfied parts, which all have

" Utilized in Twilight, Chapter 1, section 36 (Portable Nietzsche, pp. 471-72).

(p181) desiderata in their heads? is the "course of things" perhaps precisely this "away from here? away from actuality!" eternal dissatisfaction itself? is desirability perhaps the driving force itself? is it deus?78

It seems to me important that one should get rid of the all, the unity, some force, something unconditioned; otherwise one will never cease regarding it as the highest court of appeal and baptizing it "God." One must shatter the all; unlearn respect for the all; take what we have given to the unknown and the whole and give it back to what is nearest, what is ours.

When, e.g., Kant says: "Two things70 remain forever worthy of reverence" (conclusion of the Critique of] Practical Reason)

-today we should sooner say: "Digestion is more venerable." The all would always bring the old problems with it "How is evil possible?" etc. Therefore, there is no all, there is no great sensorium or inventarium or storehouse of force.

332 (Nov. 1887-March 1888) A man as he ought to be: that sounds to us as insipid as "a tree as it ought to be."*80

333 (1883-1888)

Ethics: or "philosophy of desirability." — "Things ought to be different," "things shall be different": dissatisfaction would thus be the germ of ethics.

One could rescue oneself from it, firstly by selecting states in which one did not have this feeling; secondly by grasping the presumption and stupidity of it: for to desire that something should be different from what it is means to desire that everything should be different-it involves a condemnatory critique of the whole. 8v But life itself is such a desire!

** God. # "The starry heavens above me and the moral law within me."

This section was used in Twilight, in section 6 of the chapter "Morality as Anti-Nature" (Portable Nietzsche, pp. 491-92): “Let us finally consider how naive it is altogether to say: 'Man ought to be such and such!' Reality shows us an enchanting wealth of types, the abundance of a lavish play and change of forms..."

$1 At this point the MS still has the words: "It is to that extent...."



(p182)





To ascertain what is, as it is, seems something unspeakably higher and more serious than any "thus it ought to be," because the latter, as a piece of human critique and presumption, appears ludicrous from the start. It expresses a need that desires that the structure of the world should correspond with our human well being; also the will to bring this about as far as possible.

On the other hand, it is only this desire thus it ought to be" that has called forth that other desire to know what is. For the knowledge of what is, is a consequence of that question: "How? is it possible? why precisely so?" Wonder at the disagreement between our desires and the course of the world has led to our learning to know the course of the world. But perhaps the case is different: perhaps that "thus it ought to be" is our desire to overcome the world

334 (March-June 1888)

Today, when every "man ought to be thus and thus" is spoken with a grain of irony, when we are altogether convinced that, in spite of all, one will become only that which one is 82 (in spite of all: that means education, instruction, milieu, chance, and acci dent), we have learned to reverse cause and consequences in a curious way in moral matters-nothing perhaps distinguishes us more completely from the old believers in morality. We no longer say, e.g.: "Vice is the cause that a man also goes to ruin physio logically"'; and just as little: "A man prospers through virtue, it brings long life and happiness." Our view is rather that vice and virtue are not causes but only consequences. One becomes a decent man because one is a decent man: i.e., because one was born a

Cupitalist of good instincts and prosperous circumstances

If one comes into the world poor, of parents who have squandered everything and saved nothing, one is "incorrigible," which means ripe for prison or the madhouse

Today we no longer know how to separate moral and physio logical degeneration: the former is merely a symptom-complex of the latter; one is necessarily bad, just as one is necessarily ill

Bad: here the word expresses a certain incapacity associated physiologically with the degenerating type: e.g., weakness of will,

*Cf. the subtitle of Ecce Homo: "How One Becomes What One Is."

BOOK Two: Critique of Highest Values

183

insecure and even multiple "personality," inability to resist reacting to a stimulus and to "control" oneself, constraint before every kind of suggestion from the will of another. Vice is not a cause;

vice is a consequence

Vice is a somewhat arbitrarily limited concept designed to express in one word certain consequences of physiological degen eration. A universal proposition such as Christianity teaches."Man is evil"--would be justified if one were justified in taking the degenerate type as the normal type of man. But perhaps this is an exaggeration. To be sure, the proposition is correct wherever Christianity prospers and stays on top: for that demonstrates a morbid soil, a field for degeneration.

335 (Nov. 1887-March 1888) One cannot have too much respect for man when one sees how well he understands how to fight his way through, to endure, to turn circumstances to his own use, to overthrow his adversaries; but when one looks at his desires he appears the absurdest of animals

It is as if he required a playground of cowardice, laziness, weakness, lusciousness, submissiveness for the recreation of his strong and manly virtues: observe human desiderata, his "ideals." Desiring man recovers from the eternally valuable in him, from his deeds: he employs nothingness, the absurd, the valueless, the childish for his recovery. The spiritual poverty and lack of in ventiveness of this inventive and resourceful animal are terrible. The "ideal" is, as it were, the penalty man pays for the tremendous expenditure he has to meet in all actual and pressing tasks. When reality ceases, dream, weariness, weakness come along: "the ideal" is simply a form of dream, weariness, weakness

The strongest and the most powerless natures become equal when this condition overtakes them: they deify the cessation of work, of war, of passion, of tension, of oppositions, of "reality" in summa—the struggle for knowledge, the exertion of knowledge.

"Innocence"; that is their name for the ideal state of stupe faction; "blessedness": the ideal state of sloth; "love": the ideal state of the herd animal that no longer wants to have enemies. Therewith one has raised everything that debases and lowers man to an ideal.84

The more our desire for a thing grows, the more value we ascribe to that thing:85 if "moral values" have become the highest values, this betrays the fact that the moral ideal has been the least fulfilled to that extent it represented a "beyond all suffering," as a means to blessed ness), Mankind has embraced, with ever-increasing ardor, nothing but clouds: finally it called its despair, its impotence "God".

What is the counterfeiting aspect of morality?- It pretends to know something, namely what "good and evil” is. That means wanting to know why mankind is here, its goal, its destiny. That means wanting to know that mankind has a goal, a destiny

339 (Nov. 1887-March 1888)

The very obscure and arbitrary idea that mankind has a single task to perform, that it is moving as a whole toward some goal, is still very young. Perhaps we shall be rid of it again before it becomes a "fixed idea"

This mankind is not a whole: it is an inextricable multiplicity of ascending and descending life-processes it does not have a youth followed by maturity and finally by old age; the strata are twisted and entwined together--and in a few millennia there may still be even younger types of man than we can show today. Decadence, on the other hand, belongs to all epochs of mankind:

*Cf. R. B. Perry's General Theory of Value (1926). *Cf. Freud.

(p185) refuse and decaying matter are found everywhere; it is one of life's processes to exclude the forms of decline and decay.87

When Christian prejudice was a power, this question did not exist: meaning lay in the salvation of the individual soul; whether mankind could endure for a long or a short time did not come into consideration. The best Christians desired that it should end as soon as possible concerning that which was needful to the individual there was no doubt

The task of every present individual was the same as for a future individual in any kind of future: value, meaning, domain of values were fixed, unconditional, eternal, one with God. That which deviated from this eternal type was sinful, devilish, con demned

For each soul, the gravitational center of valuation was placed within itself: salvation or damnation! The salvation of the immortal soul! Extremest form of personalization For every soul there was only one perfecting; only one ideal; only one way to redemp tion- Extremest form of equality of rights, tied to an optical magnification of one's own importance to the point of insanity Nothing but insanely important souls, revolving about themselves with a frightful fear

No man believes now in this absurd self-inflation: and we have sifted our wisdom through a sieve of contempt. Nevertheless, the optical habit of seeking the value of man in his approach to an ideal man remains undisturbed: fundamentally, one upholds the perspective of personalization as well as equality of rights before the ideal, In summa: one believes one knows what the ultimate desideratum is with regard to the ideal man

This belief, however, is only the consequence of a dreadful deterioration through the Christian ideal: as one at once discovers with every careful examination of the "ideal type." One believes one knows, first that an approach to one type is desirable; sec ondly, that one knows what this type is like; thirdly, that every

* For a comparison with Oswald Spengler, who said in the preface to The Decline of the West that he owed "everything to Goethe and Nietzsche, see the Epilogue of my Nietzsche, footnote 2.

(p186)





deviation from this type is a regression, an inhibition, a loss of force and power in man

To dream of conditions in which this perfect man will be in the vast majority: even our socialists, even the Utilitarians have not gone farther than this.

In this way a goal seems to have entered the development of mankind: at any rate, the belief in progress towards the ideal is the only form in which a goal in history is thought of today. In summa: one has transferred the arrival of the "kingdom of God" into the future, on earth, in human form—but fundamentally one has held fast to the belief in the old ideal.

340 (Spring-Fall 1887)

The more concealed forms of the cult of the Christian moral ideal. The insipid and cowardly concept "nature" devised by nature enthusiasts (-without any instinct for what is fearful, implacable and cynical in even the most beautiful" aspects), a kind of attempt to read moral Christian "humanity" into nature Rousseau's concept of nature, as if "nature" were freedom, good ness, innocence, fairness, justice, an idyl..still a cult of Christian morality fundamentally.- Collect together passages to see what the poets really admired in, e.g., high mountains, etc.— What Goethe wanted from them-why he admired Spinoza, Com plete ignorance the presupposition for this cult

The insipid and cowardly concept "man" à la Comte and Stuart Mill, perhaps even the object of a cult. It is still the cult of Christian morality under a new name - The freethinkers, e.g., Guyau.

The insipid and cowardly concept "art" as sympathy with all that suffers and is ill-constituted (even history, e.g., Thierry's): it is still the cult of the Christian moral ideal.

And now, as for the entire socialist ideal: nothing but a clumsy misunderstanding of that Christian moral ideal.

341 (Nov. 1887-March 1888) The origin of the ideal. Investigation of the soil in which it grows.

a. Proceeding from the "aesthetic” states, in which the world is seen fuller, rounder and more perfect-: the pagan ideal: self

187

BOOK TWO: Critique of Highest Values affirmation predominates (one bestows). The highest type: the classical idealas the expression of the well-constitutedness of all the chief instincts. Therein the highest style: the grand style. Expression of the "will to power" itself. The instinct that is most feared dares to acknowledge itself.

b. Proceeding from states in which the world is seen emptier, paler, more diluted, in which "spiritualization" and nonsensuality assume the rank of perfection, in which the brutal, the animalic direct, the proximate are most avoided (one removes, one chooses---): the "sage," the "angel," priestly = virginal = igno rant, physiological characteristics of idealists of this sort the anemic ideal. Under certain circumstances it can be the ideal of those who represent the first ideal, the pagan (thus Goethe sees his "saint" in Spinoza).

c. Proceeding from states in which we find the world more absurd, worse, poorer, more deceptive than we suppose or desire can be consistent with embodying the ideal (-one negates, one destroys ): the projection of the ideal into the antinatural, anti actual, illogical; the state of him who thus judges ( the "impov erishment of the world as consequence of suffering: one takes, one no longer gives ): the antinatural ideal.

(The Christian ideal is an intermediate form between the second and third, now with the former, now with the latter pre dominating.)

The three ideals: a. either a strengthening of life (pagan) or b. a dilution of life (anemic) or c. a denial of life (-anti natural). The state of "deification" is felt: in the greatest abund ance in the most fastidious selectivity--in contempt for and destruction of life.

342 (Nov. 1887-March 1888)

a. The consistent type. Here it is grasped that one must not hate even evil, that one must not oppose it, that one must not make war even against oneself; that one should not merely acquiesce in the suffering that such a way of life entails; that one should live entirely in positive feelings; that one should take the side of one's opponent in word and deed; that through a superfe tation of the peaceable, good-natured, conciliatory, helpful, and loving states one impoverishes the soil in which other states grow



(p188)



 --that one requires a perpetual way of living. What is achieved here? The Buddhist type or the perfect cow.

This standpoint is possible only when no moral fanaticism prevails, i.e., when evil is hated, not for its own sake, but only because it opens the way to states that are harmful to us (unrest, work, care, entanglements, dependence).

This is the Buddhist standpoint: here sin is not hated, here the concept "sin" is lacking.

b. The inconsistent type. One wages war against evil-one believes that war for the sake of goodness does not have the moral consequences or effect on the character that war otherwise brings with it (and owing to which one detests it as evil). In fact, such a war against evil does much more fundamental harm than any kind of hostility of one person against another; and usually "the person" is reinterpolated as the opponent, at least in imagination (the devil, evil spirits, etc.). A hostile attitude of watching and spying on everything in us that is bad and might have a bad origin ends in a most tormented and anxious constitution: so that "miracles," reward, ecstasy, transcendent solutions now become desirable The Christian type: or the perfect bigot.

c. The stoical type. Firmness, self-control, imperturbability, peace as the inflexibility of a protracted will-profound quiet, the defensive state, the fortress, a warrior's mistrustfulness-firmness of principle; the union of will and knowledge; respect for oneself. Hermit type. The perfect "ox."

343 (1883-1888)

An ideal that wants to prevail or assert itself seeks to support itself (a) by a spurious origin, (b) by a pretended relationship with powerful ideals already existing, (c) by the thrill of mystery, as if a power that cannot be questioned spoke through it, (d) by defamation of ideals that oppose it, (e) by a mendacious doctrine of the advantages it brings with it, e.g., happiness, repose of soul, peace or the assistance of a powerful God, etc.— Toward a psy chology of the idealist: Carlyle, Schiller, Michelet.

BOOK Two: Critique of Highest Values

189

If one discovers all the defensive and protective measures by which an ideal maintains itself, is it then refuted? It has employed the means by which all living things live and grow they are one and all "immoral."

My insight: all the forces and drives by virtue of which life and growth exist lie under the ban of morality: morality as the instinct to deny life. One must destroy morality if one is to liberate life.

344 (Nov. 1887-March 1888)

Not to know oneself: prudence of the idealist. The idealist: a creature that has good reasons to be in the dark about itself and is prudent enough to be in the dark about these reasons too.

345.(1885-1886)

Tendency of moral development. Everyone desires that no doctrine or valuation of things should come into favor but that through which he himself prospers. The basic tendency of the weak and mediocre of all ages is, consequently, to weaken and pull down the stronger: chief means, the moral judgment. The attitude of the stronger toward the weaker is branded; the higher states of the stronger acquire an evil name.

The struggle of the many against the few, the commonplace against the rare, the weak against the strong one of the subtlest interruptions of this struggle occurs when the choice, subtle, more fastidious present themselves as the weak and repudiate the coarser means of power

346 (March-June 1888)

1. The pretended pure drive after knowledge in all philoso phers is dictated by their moral "truths"—is only apparently independent

2. The "moral truths," "thus one ought to act," are merely forms of consciousness of a tired instinct "thus and thus one does act among us." The "ideal" is supposed to restore and strengthen an instinct; it flatters man to be obedient where he is only an automaton.



(p190)





347 (Spring-Fall 1887)

Morality as a means of seduction.— "Nature is good, for a wise and good God is its cause. Who, then, is responsible for the 'corruption of mankind'? Its tyrants and seducers, the ruling orders--they must be destroyed”-: Rousseau's logic (compare Pascal's logic, which lays the responsibility on original sin).

Compare the related logic of Luther. In both cases a pretext is sought to introduce an insatiable thirst for revenge as a moral religious duty. Hatred for the ruling order seeks to sanctify itself (the "sinfulness of Israel": foundation of the power of the priest).

Compare the related logic of Paul. It is always God's cause in which these reactions come forth, the cause of right, of humanity, etc. In the case of Christ, the rejoicing of the people appears as the cause of his execution; an anti-priestly movement from the first. Even in the case of the anti-Semites it is still the same arti fice: to visit condemnatory judgments upon one's opponent and to reserve to oneself the role of retributive justice.

348 (Spring-Fall 1887)

Course of the struggle: the fighter tries to transform his oppo nent into his antithesis-in imagination naturally. He tries to have faith in himself to such a degree that he may have courage for the "good cause" (as if he were the good cause); as if his oppo nent were attacking reason, taste, virtue

The belief he needs as the strongest means of defense and attack is a belief in himself, which, however, knows how to mis understand itself as belief in God:— never to imagine the advan tages and utility of victory, but always victory for the sake of victory, as "the victory of God"- Every little community (even an individual) that finds itself involved in struggle tries to convince itself: "We have good taste, good judgment, and virtue on our side." - The struggle compels to such an exaggeration of self esteem

349 (Spring-Fall 1887; rev. Spring-Fall 1888)

Whatever kind of bizarre ideal one may follow (e.g., as "Christian" or as "free spirit" or as "immoralist" or as Reichs

(p191) deutscher88.-), one should not demand that it be the ideal: for one therewith takes from it its privileged character. One should have it in order to distinguish oneself, not in order to level oneself,

How comes it, this notwithstanding, that most idealists at once propagandize for their ideal, as if they could have no right to the ideal if everyone did not recognize it?- This, e.g., is what all those brave little women do who permit themselves to learn Latin and mathematics. What compels them? The instinct of the herd, I fear, terror of the herd: they fight for the "emancipation of women" because it is under the form of a generous activity, under the banner of "For others," that they can most prudently forward their own little private separatism.

Prudence of idealists to be only missionaries and "representa tives" of an ideal; they "transfigure" themselves in the eyes of those who believe in disinterestedness and heroism, Whereas: true heroism consists, in not fighting under the banner of sacrifice, devotion, disinterestedness, but in not fighting at all. “This is what I am; this is what I want: you can go to hell!"

350 (Spring-Fall 1887) Every ideal presupposes love and hate, reverence and con tempt. Either the positive feeling is the primum mobile89 or the negative feeling is. Hate and contempt are, e.g., the primum mobile in all ressentiment ideals.

B. Critique of the "Good Man,"

the Saint, etc.

351 (Jan.-Fall 1888)

The "good man." Or: the hemiplegia" of virtue. For every strong and natural species of man, love and hate, gratitude and revenge, good nature and anger, affirmative acts and negative acts, belong together. One is good on condition one also knows how to be evil; one is evil because otherwise one would not under stand how to be good. Whence, then, comes the sickness and

"A member of the German Reich. Bo First motive.

Paralysis of one side.



(p192)





ideological unnaturalness that rejects this doubleness—that teaches that it is a higher thing to be efficient on only one side? Whence comes the hemiplegia of virtue, the invention of the good man?

The demand is that man should castrate himself of those instincts with which he can be an enemy, can cause harm, can be angry, can demand revenge

This unnaturalness corresponds, then, to that dualistic con ception of a merely good and a merely evil creature (God, spirit, man); in the former are summarized all the positive, in the latter all the negative forces, intentions, states.

Such a manner of valuing believes itself to be "idealistic", it does not doubt that, in the conception of "the good," it has posited a supreme desideratum. At its peak, it imagines a state in which all that is evil is annulled and in which only good creatures actually remain. It does not even consider it settled that this antithesis of good and evil is conditional on the existence of both; on the contrary, the latter should vanish and the former remain, the one has a right to exist, the other ought not to be there at all

What is it really that desires this?

Much labor has been expended in all ages, and especially in the Christian ages, to reduce mankind to this half-sided efficiency, to the "good": even today there is no lack of those deformed and weakened by the church for whom this object coincides with "humanization" in general, or with the "will of God," or with "salvation of the soul.” The essential demand here is that mankind should do nothing evil, that it should under no circumstances do harm or desire to do harm. The way to achieve this is: the cas tration of all possibility of enmity, the unhinging of all the instincts of ressentiment, "peace of soul" as a chronic disease.

This mode of thought, with which a definite type of man is bred, starts from an absurd presupposition: it takes good and evil for realities that contradict one another (not as complementary value concepts, which would be the truth), it advises taking the side of the good, it desires that the good should renounce and oppose the evil down to its ultimate roots--it therewith actually denies life, which has in all its instincts both Yes and No. Not that it grasps this: it dreams, on the contrary, that it is getting back to wholeness, to unity, to strength of life: it thinks it will be a state of redemption when the inner anarchy, the unrest between those opposing value drives, is at last put an end to.. Perhaps there has never before been a more dangerous ideology,

(p193)

a greater mischief in psychologicis, than this will to good: one has reared the most repellent type, the unfree man, the bigot; one has taught that only as a bigot is one on the right path to god hood, only the bigot's way is God's way.

And even here, life is still in the right-life, which does not know how to separate Yes from Nom: what good is it to hold with all one's strength that war is evil, not to do harm, not to desire to negate! one wages war nonetheless! one cannot do otherwise! The good man who has renounced evil, afflicted, as seems to him desirable, with that hemiplegia of virtue, in no way ceases to wage war, have enemies, say No and act No. The Christian, for example, hates "sin"! Precisely because of his faith in a moral antithesis of good and evil the world has become for him overfull of things that must be hated and eternally combated. "The good man" sees himself as if surrounded by evil, and under the continual onslaught of evil his eye grows keener, he discovers evil in all his dreams and desires, and so he ends, quite reasonably, by considering nature evil, mankind corrupt, goodness an act of grace (that is, as impossi ble for man). In summa: he denies life, he grasps that when good is the supreme value it condemns life--

Therewith he ought to consider his ideology of good and evil as refuted. But one cannot refute an illness. And so he con ceives another life!

352 (Nov. 1887-March 1888)

The concept of power, whether of a god or of a man, always includes both the ability to help and the ability to harm. Thus it is with the Arabs; thus with the Hebrews. Thus with all strong races.

It is a fateful step when one separates the power for the one from the power for the other into a dualism-In this way, morality becomes the poisoner of life

353 (Nov. 1887-March 1888)

Toward a critique of the good man. Integrity, dignity, sense of duty, justice, humanity, honesty, straightness, good conscience are certain qualities really affirmed and approved for their own sake with these well-sounding words? or is it a case of qualities and states, in themselves of no particular value, being moved into

194

The WILL TO POWER a certain light in which they acquire value? Does the value of these qualities reside in them or in the use and advantage to which they lead (appear to lead, are expected to lead)?

Naturally, I do not mean by this an antithesis between ego and alterol in the judgment: the question is whether these qualities are supposed to have value on account of their consequences, either for the bearer of these qualities or for the environment, for society, for "humanity": or whether they have value in themselves

In other words: is it utility that bids one condemn, combat, deny the opposite qualities (untrustworthiness, falseness, per versity, lack of self-confidence, inhumanity----)? Is the essence of such qualities condemned, or only their consequences? In other words: would it be desirable that men with these latter qualities should not exist? In any event, that is what is believed. But here lies the error, the short-sightedness, the narrow-mindedness of nook egoism.

Otherwise expressed: would it be desirable to create condi tions in which all the advantage would be with the righteous-s0 that the opposite natures and instincts would be discouraged and slowly die out?

This is at bottom a question of taste and of aesthetics: would it be desirable that the "most respectable," i.e., most tedious, species of man should survive? the square, 02 the virtuous, the worthies, the good people, the straight, the "oxen"708

If one imagines the tremendous abundance of the "others" gode, then even the righteous no longer has a right to existence: he is no longer necessary and here one grasps that it is only coarse utility that has brought such an insufferable virtue into honor.

Perhaps desirability lies on precisely the other side: to create conditions in which the "righteous man" is reduced to the modest position of a "useful tool" -as the "ideal herd animal," at best herdsman: in short, conditions in which he no longer stands among the higher orders which require other qualities.

take over and over again: he has made a means to life into a standard of life; instead of discovering the standard in the highest enhancement of life itself, in the problem of growth and exhaus tion, he has employed the means to a quite distinct kind of life to exclude all other forms of life, in short to criticize and select life. I.e., man finally loves the means for their own sake and forgets they are means: so that they enter his consciousness as aims, as standards for aimsmi.e., a certain species of man treats the con ditions of its existence as conditions which ought to be imposed as a law, as "truth," "good," "perfection": it tyrannizes- It is a form of faith, of instinct, that a species of man fails to perceive its conditionality, its relativity to other species. At least, it seems to be all over for a species of man (people, races) when it becomes tolerant, allows equal rights and no longer thinks of wanting to be master

Atavism: wonderful feeling to be able to obey unconditionally for once.

Industry, modesty, benevolence, temperance are just so many hindrances to a sovereign disposition, great inventiveness, heroic purposiveness, noble being-for-oneself.

It is not a matter of going ahead (-for then one is at best a herdsman, i.e., the herd's chief requirement), but of being able to go it alone, of being able to be different.

359 (Spring-Fall 1887)

One must reckon up what had been accumulated as a conse quence of the highest moral idealism: how almost all other values had crystallized around the ideal. This proves that it has been desired longest and strongest--that is has not been attained; other wise it would have disappointed (or would have been followed by a more moderate valuation).95

The saint as the most powerful type of man- it is this idea that has elevated so high the value of moral perfection. One must imagine the whole of knowledge laboring to prove that the moral man is the most powerful, most godlike. The overcoming of

I have declared war on the anemic Christian ideal (together with what is closely related to it), not with the aim of destroying it but only of putting an end to its tyranny and clearing the way for new ideals, for more robust ideals

The continuance of the Christian ideal is one of the most desirable things there are even for the sake of the ideals that want to stand beside it and perhaps above it—they must have opponents, strong opponents, if they are to become strong.

Thus we immoralists require the power of morality: our drive of self-preservation wants our opponents to retain their strength it only wants to become master over them.96

Egoism and its problem! The Christian gloominess in La Rochefoucauld which extracted egoism from everything and thought he had thereby reduced the value of things and of virtues!

an expression of egoism, etc. In fact, the false valuation is aimed at the interests: (1) of those who are helped and aided, the herd; (2) it contains a pessimistic mistrustfulness of the basis of life; (3) it would like to deny the most splendid and best-constituted men; fear; (4) it wants to aid the subjected to their rights against their conquerors; (5) it brings with it a universal dishonesty, and precisely among the most valuable men,

Man is an indifferent egoist: even the cleverest thinks his habits more important than his advantage.

364 (1884)

Egoism! But no one has yet asked: what kind of ego? On the contrary, everyone unconsciously thinks every ego equal to every other ego. This is the consequence of the slaves theory of sufrage universel and "equality."

365 (1884)

The actions of a higher man are indescribably complex in their motivation: any such word as "pity" says nothing whatever. The most essential thing is the feeling "Who am I? who is the other in relation to me?"- Value judgments are continually at work.

366 (1885-1886)

That the history of all phenomena of morality could be sim plified in the way Schopenhauer believed.namely, so that pity is to be discovered as the root of all moral impulse hitherto-only a thinker denuded of all historical instinct, and one who had eluded in the strangest way even that strong schooling in history undergone by the Germans from Herder to Hegel, could have attained to this degree of absurdity and naiveté.

367 (1885)

My kind of "pity." This is a feeling for which I find no name adequate: I sense it when I see precious capabilities squan

Or when I see anyone halted, as a result of some stupid accident, at something less than he might have become. Or especially at the idea of the lot of mankind, as when I observe with anguish and contempt the politics of present-day Europe, which is, under all circumstances, also working at the web of the future of all men. Yes, what could not become of "man," if ! This is a97 kind of "compassion" although there is really no "passion" I share.98.

368 (1883-1888)

Pity a squandering of feeling, a parasite harmful to moral health, 99 "it cannot possibly be our duty to increase the evil in the world." If one does good merely out of pity, it is oneself one really does good to, and not the other. Pity does not depend upon maxims but upon affects;100 it is pathological. The suffering of others infects us, pity is an infection.

369 (1885-1886)

No egoism at all exists that remains within itself and does not encroach-consequently, that "allowable," "morally indifferent" egoism of which you speak does not exist at all.

"One furthers one's ego always at the expense of others;" "Life always lives at the expense of other life"-he who does not grasp this has not taken even the first step toward honesty with himself.

370 (Spring-Fall 1887)

The "subject" is only a fiction: the ego of which one speaks when one censures egoism does not exist at all.

(p200)





371 (1885-1886) The "ego"-which is not one with the central government of our naturel-is, indeed, only a conceptual synthesis thus there are no actions prompted by "egoism."

372 (1883-1888) As every drive lacks intelligence, the viewpoint of "utility" cannot exist for it. Every drive, in as much as it is active, sacrifices force and other drives: finally it is checked; otherwise it would destroy everything through its excessiveness. Therefore: the "un egoistic," self-sacrificing, imprudent, is nothing special-it is com mon to all the drives--they do not consider the advantage of the whole ego (because they do not consider at all!), they act contrary to our advantage, against the ego: and often for the ego-innocent in both cases!

373 (March-June 1888)

Origin of moral values 101— Egoism is of as much value as the physiological value of him who possesses it.

Every individual consists of the whole course of evolution (and not, as morality imagines, only of something that begins at birth). If he represents the ascending course of mankind, then his value is in fact extraordinary; and extreme care may be taken over the preservation and promotion of his development. (It is concern for the future promised him that gives the well-constituted individ ual such an extraordinary right to egoism.) If he represents the descending course, decay, chronic sickening, then he has little value: and the first demand of fairness is for him to take as little space, force, and sunshine as possible away from the well constituted. In this case, it is the task of society to suppress egoism (which sometimes expresses itself in absurd, morbid and rebel

A doctrine and religion of "love," of suppression of self-affirmation, of patience, endurance, helpfulness, of cooperation in word and deed, can be of the highest value within such classes, even from the point of view of the rulers: for it suppresses feelings of rivalry, of ressentiment; of envy

the all too natural feelings of the underprivilegedit even deifies a life of slavery, subjection, poverty, sickness, and inferiority for them under the ideal of humility and obedience. This explains why the ruling classes (or races) and individuals have at all times up held the cult of selflessness, the gospel of the lowly, the "God on the cross."

The preponderance of an altruistic mode of valuation is the consequence of an instinct that one is ill-constituted. The value judgment here is at bottom; "I am not worth much": a merely physiological value judgment; even more clearly: the feeling of impotence, the absence of the great affirmative feelings of power (in muscles, nerves, ganglia). This value judgment is translated into a moral or a religious judgment, according to the culture of this class ( the predominance of religious and moral judgments is always a sign of a lower culture-): it seeks to establish itself by relating to spheres in which it recognizes the concept "value" in general. The interpretation by means of which the Christian sinner believes he understands himself is an attempt to justify his lack of power and self-confidence: he would rather consider him self guilty than feel bad for no reason: it is a symptom of decay to require interpretations of this sort at all.

In other cases, the underprivileged man seeks the reason not in his "guilt" (as the Christian does), but in society: the socialist, the anarchist, the nihilist-in as much as they find their existence something of which someone must be guilty, they are still the closest relations of the Christian, who also believes he can better endure his sense of sickness and ill-constitutedness by finding someone whom he can make responsible for it. The instinct of revenge and ressentiment appears here in both cases as a means of enduring, as the instinct of self-preservation: just as is the preference for altruistic theory and practice.

Hatred of egoism, whether it be one's own (as with Chris tians) or another's (as with socialists), is thus revealed as a value judgment under the predominating influence of revenge; on the other hand, as an act of prudence for the self-preservation of the



(p202)





suffering by an enhancement of their feelings of cooperation and solidarity

Finally, even that release of ressentiment in the judging, re jecting, punishing of egoism (one's own or another's) is also, as already indicated, an instinct of self-preservation on the part of the underprivileged. In summa: the cult of altruism is a specific form of egoism that regularly appears under certain physiological conditions.

When the socialist with a fine indignation demands "justice," "right," "equal rights," he is merely acting under the impress of his inadequate culture that cannot explain why he is suffering: on the other hand, he enjoys himself; if he felt better he would re frain from crying out: he would then find pleasure in other things. The same applies to the Christian: he condemns, disparages, curses the "world" himself not excluded. But that is no reason for taking his clamor seriously. In both cases we are in the presence of invalids who feel better for crying out, for whom defamation is a relief.

374 (Spring-Fall 1887; rev. Spring-Fall 1888)

Every society has the tendency to reduce its opponents to caricatures--at least in imagination-and, as it were, to starve them. Such a caricature is, e.g., our "criminal.". Within the aristocratic Roman order of values, the Jew was reduced to a caricature. Among artists, the "philistine and bourgeois" become caricatures, among the pious, the godless; among aristocrats, the man of the people. Among immoralists it is the moralist: Plato,

for example, becomes a caricature in my hands.

375 (1883-1888)

All the drives and powers that morality praises seem to me to be essentially the same as those it defames and rejects: e.g., justice as will to power, will to truth as a tool of the will to power.

Man's growing inwardness. Inwardness grows as powerful drives that have been denied outward release by the establishment

of peace and society seek compensation by turning inward in concert with the imagination. The thirst for enmity, cruelty, re venge, violence turns back, is repressed;102 in the desire for knowl edge there is avarice and conquest; in the artist there reappears the repressed103 power to dissimulate and lie; the drives are trans formed into demons whom one fights, etc,

377 (1883-1888) Falsity. Every sovereign instinct has the others for its tools, retainers, flatterers: it never lets itself be called by its ugly name: and it countenances no praise in which it is not also praised in directly. All praise and blame in general crystallizes around every sovereign instinct to form a rigorous order and etiquette. This is one of the causes of falsity. *** Every instinct that struggles for mastery but finds itself under a yoke requires for itself, as strengthening and as support for its self-esteem, all the beautiful names and recognized values: so, as a rule, it ventures forth under the name of the "master" it is combatting and from whom it wants to get free (e.g., the fleshly desires or the desires for power under the dominion of Christian values).- This is the other cause of falsity.

Perfect naiveté reigns in both cases: the falsity does not be come conscious. It is a sign of a broken instinct when man sees the driving force and its "expression" ("the mask") as separate things—a sign of self-contradiction, and victorious far less often. Absolute innocence in bearing, word, affect, a "good conscience" in falsity, the certainty with which one grasps the greatest and most splendid words and postures-all this is necessary for victory.

In the other case: when one has extreme clearsightedness one needs the genius of the actor and tremendous training in self control if one is to achieve victory. That is why priests are the most skillful conscious hypocrites; then princes, whom rank and ancestry have endowed with a kind of acting ability. Thirdly, men of society, diplomats. Fourthly, women,

Basic idea: falsity seems so profound, so omnisided, the will so clearly opposed to direct self-knowledge and the calling of

things by their right names, that it is very highly probable that truth, will to truth is really something else and only a disguise. (The need for faith is the greatest brake-shoe on truthfulness.)

378 (1883-1888)

"Thou shalt not lie"; one demands truthfulness. But acknowl edgement of the factual (refusal to let oneself be lied to) has been greatest precisely among liars: they have recognized that just this popular "truthfulness" is not a fact. What is said is always too much or too little: the demand that one should denude one self with every word one says is a piece of naiveté.

One says what one thinks, one is "truthful," only under certain conditions: namely, that one is understood (inter pares),104 and understood with good will (once again inter pares). One conceals oneself in presence of the unfamiliar: and he who wants to attain something says what he would like to have thought of him, but not what he thinks. ("The powerful always lie.")

379 (Spring-Fall 1887)

The great nihilistic counterfeiting through artful misuse of moral values:

a. Love as depersonalization; also pity.

b. Only the most depersonalized intellect ("the philosopher") knows the truth, "the true being and nature of things."

c. The genius, the great human beings, are great because they do not seek their own advantage: the value of a man increases in proportion as he denies himself.

d. Art as the work of the "pure free-willed subject"; mis understanding of "objectivity."

e. Happiness as the end of life: virtue as means to an end.

The pessimistic condemnation of life by Schopenhauer is a moral one. Transference of herd standards into the realm of meta physics

The "individuum" meaningless, necessitating an origin in the "in-itself" (and an explanation of his existence as an "aberration"); parents only "accidental cause."- We are paying for the fact that science has not understood the individuum: he comprises the en tirety of life hitherto in one development, and is not its result.

a. decline of a people and corruption;106 b. rise of a people and virtue; c. zenith of a people ("its culture") as consequence of

moral elevation. 2. Systematic falsification of great human beings, the great creators, the great epochs:

one desires that faith should be the distinguishing mark of the great: but slackness, skepticism, "immorality," the right to throw off a faith, belong to greatness (Caesar, also Homer, Aristophanes, Leonardo, Goethe). One always sup presses the main thing, their "freedom of will”.

381 (Spring-Fall 1887)

Great lie in history: as if the corruption of the church were the cause of the Reformation! Only pretext and self-deception on the part of the instigators-strong needs were present whose brutality very much required a spiritual cloak.108

382 (Spring-Fall 1887; rev. Spring-Fall 1888)

Schopenhauer interpreted high intellectuality as liberation from the will; he did not want to see the freedom from moral prejudice which is part of the emancipation of the great spirit, the typical immorality of the genius; he artfully posited the only thing he held in honor, the moral value of "depersonalization," as the condition of spiritual activity, of "objective" viewing. "Truth," even in art, appears after the withdrawal of the will

I see a fundamentally different valuation cutting across all the moral idiosyncrasies; I know nothing of such an absurd dis tinction between "genius" and the moral and immoral world of the will. The moral man is a lower species than the immoral, a weaker species; indeedhe is a type in regard to morality, but

105 Cf. section 334 above; also 41-44 and Twilight, Chapter VI (Portable Nietzsche, p. 492 f).

101 See 150n above.

(p206)





not a type in himself; a copy, a good copy at best--the measure of his value lies outside him. I assess a man by the quantum of power and abundance of his will: not by its enfeeblement and extinction; I regard a philosophy which teaches denial of the will as a teaching of defamation and slandet - I assess the power of a will by how much resistance, pain, torture it endures and knows how to turn to its advantage; I do not account the evil and painful character of existence a reproach to it, but hope rather that it will one day be more evil and painful than hitherto 107

The high point of the spirit imagined by Schopenhauer was to attain to the recognition that there is no meaning in anything, in short, to recognize what the good man already instinctively does---He denies the possibility of a higher kind of intellect--he took his insight for a non plus ultra. Here spirituality is placed much lower than goodriess; its highest value (e.g., as art) would be to urge and prepare moral conversion: absolute domination of moral values.

Beside Schopenhauer I would characterize Kant: nothing Greek, absolutely antihistorical (his passage on the French Revo lution) and a moral fanatic (Goethe's passage on radical evil). Saintliness was in the background in his case, too.

I need a critique of the saint Hegel's value. "Passion."

Shopkeeper's philosophy of Mr. Spencer; complete absence of an ideal, except that of the mediocre man.

Fundamental instinctive principle of all philosophers and his torians and psychologists: everything of value in man, art, history, science, religion, technology must be proved to be of moral value, morally conditioned, in aim, means and outcome. Everything under stood in the light of the supreme value: e.g., Rousseau's question concerning civilization: "Does man become better through it?"-an amusing question, since the reverse is obvious and is precisely that which speaks in favor of civilization.

107 Italics supplied. In the original only "power" and "will" are empha sized. Sections 382-88 are of exceptional interest,

(p207)

The logic is: the desires often produce great misfortune consequently they are evil, reprehensible. A man must free himself from them: otherwise he cannot be a good man

This is the same logic as: "if thine eye offend thee, pluck it out." In the particular case in which that dangerous "innocent from the country," the founder of Christianity, recommended this practice to his disciples, the case of sexual excitation, the conse quence is, unfortunately, not only the loss of an organ but the emasculation of a man's character And the same applies to the moralist's madness that demands, instead of the restraining of the passions, their extirpation, Its conclusion is always: only the castrated man is a good man,

Instead of taking into service the great sources of strength, those impetuous torrents of the soul that are so often dangerous and overwhelming, and economizing them, this most shortsighted and pernicious mode of thought, the moral mode of thought, wants to make them dry up. 108

384 (1885-1886)

Overcoming of the affects? -No, if what is implied is their weakening and extirpation. But putting them into service: which may also mean subjecting them to a protracted tyranny (not only as an individual, but as a community, race, etc.). At last they are confidently granted freedom again: they love us as good servants and go voluntarily wherever our best interests lie.

385 (Spring-Fall 1887)

Moral intolerance is an expression of weakness in a man: he is afraid of his own "immorality," he must deny his strongest drives because he does not yet know how to employ them. Thus the most fruitful regions of the earth remain uncultivated the longest: the force is lacking that could here become master

 in rebus moralibus, 100 that the "good man," and nothing but the "good man," is something desirable and that the course of human evolution is directed toward the survival of the "good man" only (and that one must bend all one's efforts in that direction-). This is in the highest degree an uneconomic thought and, as stated, the acme of naiveté, nothing but the expression of the pleasing effect produced by the "good man" (-he arouses no fear, he permits one to relax, he gives what one is able to take).110

From a superior viewpoint one desires the contrary: the ever-increasing dominion of evil, the growing emancipation of man from the narrow and fear-ridden bonds of morality, the in crease of force, in order to press the mightiest natural powers the affects-into service.

zation, it was precisely the affects of love, goodness, pity, even those of justice, magnanimity, heroism, that were necessarily misunderstood: 111

It is richness in personality, abundance in oneself, over flowing and bestowing, instinctive good health and affirmation of oneself, that produce great sacrifice and great love: it is strong and godlike selfhood from which these affects grow, just as surely as do the desire to become master, encroachment, the inner certainty of having a right to everything. What according to common ideas are opposite dispositions are rather one disposition, and if one is not firm and brave within oneself, one has nothing to bestow and cannot stretch out one's hand to protect and support ...

How was one able so to transform these instincts that man thought valuable that which was directed against his self? when he sacrificed his self to another self. Oh the psychological wretched ness and mendaciousness that has hitherto laid down the law in the church and in church-infected philosophy!

If man is sinful through and through, then he ought only to hate himself. Fundamentally, he would have to treat his fellow men on the same basis as he treats himself, charity needs to be justified-its justification lies in the fact that God has commanded it. It follows from this, that all the natural instincts of man (the instinct of love, etc.) appear to be forbidden in themselves and only after they have been denied are they restored to their rights on the basis of obedience to God-Pascal, the admirable logician of Christianity, went so far! consider his relations to his sister. "Not to make oneself love"112 seemed Christian to him.

My final proposition is: that the actual man represents a much higher value than the “desirable" man of any ideal hitherto; that all "desiderata" with reference to man have been absurd and dangerous excesses through which a single type of man tried to establish his conditions of preservation and growth as a law for all mankind; that every "desideratum" of this kind ever brought into a position of dominance has reduced the value of man, his strength, his certainty of the future; that the nook-intellectuality and poverty. of spirit of man is most apparent, even today, when he desires; that man's ability to posit values has hitherto been too little developed for him to be just, not merely to the "desirable" values, but to the real values of man; that the ideal has hitherto been the actual force for disparaging the world and man, the poisonous vapor over reality, the great seduction to nothingness

393 (Spring-Fall 1887)

Thought about the most universal subjects is always behind the times: the ultimate "desiderata" for. mankind, for example, have never really been grasped as a problem by philosophers. They all naively postulate the "improvement" of man as if an intuition answered for us the question why we ought to "improve." TO what extent is it desirable that man should become more virtuous? or cleverer? or happier? Provided we do not already know the "wherefore" of mankind, such an outlook has no meaning; and if one desires one of these things, who knows, perhaps one is pre cluded from desiring the others. Is an increase in virtuousness compatible with an increase in cleverness and insight? Dubito;113 only too often I shall have occasion to show the reverse. Has virtuousness as a goal not hitherto been in the most rigorous sense incompatible with being happy? does it not, on the contrary, re quire misfortune, self-denial and self-mistreatment as a necessary means? And if the deepest insight were the goal, would one not then have to renounce the increase of happiness? and choose danger, adventure, mistrust, seduction as the road to insight And if one desires happiness, well, perhaps one has to become one of the "poor in spirit.”

394 (March-June 1888)

The universal deception and cheating in the realm of so called moral improvement.--- We do not believe that a man will become another if he is not that other already; i.e., if he is not, as is often the case, a multiplicity of persons, at least the embryos of persons. In this case, one can bring a different role into the foreground and draw "the former man” back- The aspect is changed, not the essence. That someone ceases to perform certain actions is a mere fatum brutumi14 that permits the most various interpretations. It is not always the case that the habit of a certain act is broken, the ultimate reason for it removed. He who is a criminal through fate and facility unlearns nothing, but learns more and more: and a long abstinence even acts as a tonic to his talent

113 I doubt [it]. 131 Brute fate.



(p212)





For society, to be sure, all that is of interest is precisely that someone no longer performs certain actions: to this end it removes him from those conditions in which he can perform certain actions; that is wiser, in any event, than to attempt the impossible, namely, to disrupt the fatality by which he is thus and thus. The church and in this it has done nothing but succeed and inherit from the philosophy of antiquity--proceeding from a different standard and desiring to save a "soul," the "eternal destiny" of a soul, first believes in the expiatory power of punishment and then in the obliterating power of forgiveness: both are deceptions of religious prejudice-punishment does not expiate, forgiveness does not ex tinguish, what is done is not undone. That someone forgets some thing is certainly not evidence that something has ceased to exist

A deed produces its consequences, within the man and out side the man, regardless of whether it is considered as punished, "expiated." "forgiven" and "extinguished," regardless of whether the church has in the meantime promoted the doer to a saint. The church believes in things that do not exist, in "souls;" it believes in effects that do not exist, in divine effects; it believes in states that do not exist, in sin, in redemption, in the salvation of the soul: it stays everywhere on the surface, at signs, gestures, words to which it gives an arbitrary meaning. It possesses a thoroughly thought-out method of psychological counterfeiting.

395 (1887-1888) "Jllness makes men better": this famous opinion, which one encounters throughout the centuries, in the mouth of the sage as often as in the mouth and maw of the people, makes one wonder. As to whether it is valid, one would like to ask; were morality and illness originally connected, perhaps? The "improve ment of man," regarded as a whole, e.g., the undeniable softening, humanizing, mellowing of the European within the last millennium

is it perhaps the result of long hidden and mysterious suffering and failure, abstinence, stunting? Has "illness" made the European “better"? Or, in other words; is our morality--Our modern sensi tive European morality, which may be compared with the morality of the Chinese--the expression of a physiological regression?

For one cannot deny that every period in history in which "man" has shown himself in exceptional splendor and power at once assumed an impetuous, dangerous, and eruptive character

under which humanity fared ill; and perhaps in those cases in which it seems otherwise, all that was lacking was the courage or subtlety to take psychology into the depths and to find there, too, the universal law: "the healthier, stronger, richer, more fruitful, more enterprising a man feels, the more 'immoral' he will be, too." A painful thought! in which one certainly ought not to indulge! If, however, one goes along with it for just a few moments, how astonishing the future seems then! What would then be paid for more dearly than precisely that which we are promoting with all our strength--the humanizing, the "improvement," the grow ing "civilization" of man? Nothing would be more costly than virtue: for one would in the end have turned the earth into a hospital: and ultimate wisdom would be "everyone as everyone else's nurse." To be sure, one would then possess that much desired "peace on earth"! But how little "delight in each other"! How little beauty, high spirits, daring, danger! How few "works." for the sake of which life on earth is worth while! And, alas, no more "deeds" whatever! Al great works and deeds that have re mained and have not been washed away by the waters of time were they not all in the profoundest sense immoralities?--

-

396 (Jan.-Fall 1888) The priests--and with them the semi-priests, the philosophers -have at all times called true any teaching whose educative effect was beneficial or seemed beneficial-which "improved." In this they resemble a naive quack and miracle man of the people, who, because he has used a poison as a cure, denies it is a poison "By their fruits shall ye know them-namely, our 'truths' ": that has been the reasoning of the priests to this day. With fateful results, they have expended their subtlety to make the "proof of power" (or "from their fruits”) pre-eminent, even decisive, above all other forms of proof. “What makes good must be good; what is good cannot lie"_that is their relentless conclusion ; "what bears good fruit must be true: there is no other criterion of truth"

But if "making better" counts as an argument, then making worse must count as a refutation, One can prove an error to be an error by testing the lives of those who espouse it: a mistake, a vice can refute This most indecent form of opposition, from behind and below, the doglike form of opposition, has not died out either: the priests, in so far as they are psychologists, have



(p214)





never discovered anything more interesting than to spiff at the secrets of their adversaries--they demonstrate their Christianity by looking about the "world" for filth. Especially with the first men of the world, with the "geniuses”: one will remember how Goethe has been attacked in Germany at all times (Klopstock and Herder were the first to provide a "good example" of this kind sticks to kind).

397 (Jan-Fall 1888) One must be very immoral in order to make morals by deeds. The means of the moralist are the most terrible means that have ever been employed; he who has not the courage for immorality in deeds is fit for anything, but he is not fit to be a moralist.

Morality is a menagerie; its presupposition is that iron bars can be more profitable than freedom, even for the prisoners; its other presupposition is that there exist animal-trainers who are not afraid of terrible means who know how to handle red-hot iron. This frightful species which takes up the fight against the wild animal is called "priest."

Man, imprisoned in an iron cage of errors, became a carica ture of man, sick, wretched, ill-disposed toward himself, full of hatred for the impulses of life, full of mistrust of all that is beauti ful and happy in life, à walking picture of misery: this artificial, arbitrary, recent abortion that the priests have pulled up out of their soil, the "sinner": how shall we be able, in spite of all, to justify this phenomenon?

In order to be fair to morality, we must put two zoological concepts in its place: taming of the beast and breeding of a particular species.

The priests have pretended at all times that they want to "improve" — But we others would laugh if an animal-trainer spoke of his "improved" animals. In most cases, the taming of a beast is achieved through the harming of a beast: the moral man, too, is not a better man but only a weaker one. But he is less harmful--115

11 Cf. Twilight, "The 'Improvers' of Mankind" (Portable Nietzsche, p. 501 i).

(p215)

398 (Jan.-Fall 1888)

What I want to make clear by all the means in my power:

a. that there is no worse confusion than the confusion of breeding with taming; which is what has been done Breeding, as I understand it, is a means of storing up the tremendous forces of mankind so that the generations can build upon the work of their forefathers--not only outwardly, but inwardly, organically growing out of them and becoming something stronger

b. that it is extraordinarily dangerous to believe that man kind as a whole will progress and grow stronger if individuals become flabby, equal, average Mankind is an abstraction: the goal of breeding, even in the case of a single individual, can only be the stronger man (the man without breeding is weak, ex travagant, unstable ).

6. Further Considerations for a

Critique of Morality

399 (1885-1886)

These are the demands I make upon you—however ill they may sound to you; that you should undertake a critique of the moral evaluations themselves. That you should call a halt to the moral impulse, which here demands submission and not a critique, with the question: "why submission?" That you should regard this demand for a "wherefore?", for a critique of morality, as precisely your present form of morality, as the sublimest form of morality, which does honor to you and to your age. That our honesty, our will not to deceive ourselves, must prove itself: why not?--- Before what tribunal? The will not to let oneself be de ceived is of different origin; a caution against being overpowered, exploited—one of life's instincts of self-defense. 110

114 The last sentence, omitted from all editions, has here been restored, and the penultimate sentence revised, in acordance with the MS and 1911, p. 504.

For the contrast implicit in the last two sentences see also The Gay Science, Book V, section 344, which is discussed at length in my Nietzsche, Chapter 12, section III.216

THE WILL. TO POWER

400 (1883-1888) The three assertions: The ignoble is the higher (protest of the "common man"); the antinatural is the higher (protest of the underprivileged);

the average is the higher (protest of the herd, of the "medi ocre").

Thus in the history of morality a will to power finds expres sion, through which now the slaves and oppressed, now the ill constituted and those who suffer from themselves, now the mediocre attempt to make those value judgments prevail that are favorable to them.

To this extent, the phenomenon of morality is, from a bio logical standpoint, highly suspicious. Morality has developed hitherto at the expense of: the rulers and their specific instincts, the well-constituted and beautiful natures, those who are in any sense independent and privileged.

Morality is therefore an opposition movement against the efforts of nature to achieve a higher type. Its effect is: mistrust of life in general (in so far as its tendencies are considered "im moral")-hostility toward the senses (in so far as the supreme values are considered to be opposed to the supreme instincts) degeneration and self-destruction of "higher natures," because it is precisely in them that the conflict becomes conscious.

401 (March-June 1888) The Values That Have Been on Top Hitherto

Morality as the supreme value, in all phases of philosophy (even among the skeptics). Result: this world is good for nothing, there must be a "real world."

What really determines the supreme value here? What is morality really? The instinct of decadence; it is the exhausted and disinherited who in this way take their revenge and play the master

Historical proof: the philosophers always decadents, always in the service of the nihilistic religions.

The instinct of decadence which appears as will to power. Introduction of its system of means: absolute immorality of means.

BOOK TWO: Critique of Highest Values General insight: supreme values hitherto are a special case of the will to power; morality itself is a special case of immorality.

Why the Opposing Values Always Succumbed 1. How was this really possible? Question: why did life, physiological well-constitutedness everywhere succumb? Why was there no affirmative philosophy, no affirmative religion?

The historical signs of such movements: the pagan religion. Dionysus versus the "Crucified." The Renaissance. Art.

2. The strong and the weak: the healthy and the sick; the exception and the rule. There is no doubt who is the stronger

General aspect of history: Is man therefore an exception in the history of life? -Objection to Darwinism. The means the weak employ to keep themselves on top have become instincts, "humanity," "institutions"

3. Proof of this dominion in our political instincts, in our social value judgments, in our arts, in our science.

The declining instincts have become master over the ascending instincts. The will to nothingness has become master over the will to life!

-Is this true? is there perhaps not a stronger guarantee of life in this victory of the weak and mediocre?is it perhaps only a means in the total movement of life, a slackening of tempo? a self-defense against something even worse?

-Suppose the strong had become master in everything, and even in moral valuation: let us draw the consequences of how they would think about sickness, suffering, sacrifice! Self-con tempt on the part of the weak would be the result; they would try to disappear and extinguish themselves. And would this be desirable?--and would we really want a world in which the in fluence of the weak, their subtlety, consideration, spirituality, pliancy was lacking?

We have seen two "wills to power" in conflict (in this special case: we had a principle, that of considering right those who hitherto succumbed, and wrong those who hitherto prevailed): we have recognized the "real world" as a "false world" and



(p218)



 morality as a form of immorality. We do not say: "The stronger is wrong."

We have grasped what it was that determined supreme value and why it became master over the opposing valuation, it was stronger numerically.

Now let us purify the opposite valuation of the infection and half-measures of the degeneration characteristic of the form in which it is known to us.

Restoration of nature: moraline-free.

402 (Jan.-Fall 1888)

Morality a useful error; more clearly in the case of the greatest and least prejudiced of its advocates, a lie that is con sidered necessary.

403 (1886-1887)

One may admit the truth to oneself to the point where one is sufficiently elevated no longer to require the disciplinary school of (moral]118 errorWhen one judges existence morally, it disgusts.

One should not invent unreal persons, e.g., one should not say "nature is cruel." Precisely the insight that no such central responsible being exists is a relief!

Evolution of man. a. To gain power over nature and in ad dition a certain power over oneself. (Morality was needed that man might prevail in his struggle with nature and the "wild animal.")

b. If power has been attained over nature, one can employ this power in the further free development of oneself: will to power as self-elevation and strengthening,

404 (1886-1887)

Morality as an illusion of the species, designed to motivate the individual to sacrifice himself to the future: apparently allow ing him an infinite value, so that by means of this self-conscious

Profoundest gratitude for that which morality has achieved hitherto; but now it is only a burden which may become a fatality! Morality itself, in the form of honesty, compels us to deny morality.

405 (1885-1886)

End 117

To what an extent the self-destruction of morality is still a part of its own force. We Europeans have in us the blood of those who died for their faith; we have taken morality to be serious and awesome, and there is nothing that we have not in some way sacrificed to it. On the other hand: our spiritual subtlety has es sentially been attained through conscience-vivisection. We do not yet know the "wither" toward which we are driven once we have detached ourselves from our old soil. But it was from this same soil that we acquired the force which now drives us forth into the distance, into adventures, thrusting us into the boundless, the un tried, the undiscovered we have no choice left, we have to be conquerors once we no longer have any country in which we are at home, in which we would want to preserve" things. A con cealed Yes drives us that is stronger than all our No's. Our strength itself will no longer endure us in the old decaying soil: we venture away, we venture ourselves: the world is still rich and undiscovered, and even to perish is better than to become half hearted and poisonous. Our strength itself drives us to sea, where all suns have hitherto gone down: we know of a new world

## 3 CRITIQUE OF PHILOSOPHY

### 1. General Observations

406 (1885-1886)

Let us get rid of a few superstitions about philosophers that have been common so far!

407 (1884)

Philosophers are prejudiced against appearance, change, pain, death, the corporeal, the senses, fate and bondage, the aimless.

They believe first in: absolute knowledge, (2) in knowledge for the sake of knowledge, (3) in an association between virtue and happiness, (4) in the comprehensibility of human actions. [They are] 118 led by instinctive moral definitions in which former cultural conditions are reflected (more dangerous ones).

408 (1884) What do philosophers lack? (a)118 an historical sense, (b) knowledge of physiology, (c) a goal in the future. The ability to formulate a critique without any irony or moral condemnation.

409 (1885)

Philosophers (1) have had from the first a wonderful capacity for the contradictio in adjecto; (2) they have trusted in concepts as completely as they have mistrusted the senses: they have not stopped to consider that concepts and words are our inheritance from ages in which thinking was very modest and unclear.

What dawns on philosophers last of all: they must no longer accept concepts as a gift, nor merely purify and polish them, but first make and create them, present them and make them con vincing. Hitherto one has generally trusted one's concepts as if

119 Not in the MS. The German editors made other minor changes in this note.

*Although the MS has (a), (b), (c), all previous editions have 1, 2,3.

(p221)

they were a wonderful dowry from some sort of wonderland: but they are, after all, the inheritance from our most remote, most foolish as well as most intelligent ancestors. This piety toward what we find in us is perhaps part of the moral element in knowledge. What is needed above all is an absolute skepticism toward all inherited concepts (of the kind that one philosopher perhaps possessed-Plato, of course--for he taught the reverse).

410 (1885-1886) For the Preface120

Deeply mistrustful of the dogmas of epistemology, I loved to look now out of this window, now out of that; I guarded against settling down with any of these dogmas, considered them harmful -and finally: is it likely that a tool is able to criticize its own fitness? - What I noticed was rather that no epistemological skepticism or dogmatism had ever arisen free from ulterior motives

-that it acquires a value of the second rank as soon as one has considered what it was that compelled the adoption of this point of view,

Fundamental insight: Kant as well as Hegel and Schopen hauer--the skeptical-epochistic attitude as well as the historicizing, as well as the pessimistic-have a moral origin. I saw no one who had ventured a critique of moral value feelings: and I soon turned my back on the meagre attempts made to arrive at a description of the origin of these feelings (as by the English and German Darwinists).

How can Spinoza's position, his denial and rejection of moral value judgments, be explained? (It was one consequence of his theodicy!)

411 (Spring-Fall 1887; rey. 1888)

Morality as supreme devaluation.- Either our world is the work and expression (modus) of God: in which case it must be supremely perfect (Leibniz's conclusion) - and one never doubted that one knew what constituted perfection—in which case evil must be only apparent (Spinoza is more radical, applying this to

130 This beading has been deleted in all previous editions. This section is discussed in my Nietzsche, Chapter 2, section II,



(p222)





the concepts good and evil), or must proceed from God's supreme purpose ( perhaps as consequence of a particular mark of favor by God, who allows a choice between good and evil: the privilege of not being an automaton; "freedom" at the risk of making a mistake, of choosing wrongly-e.g., see Simplicius in his com mentary on Epictetus).

Or our world is imperfect, evil and guilt are actual and determined and absolutely inherent in its nature; in which case it cannot be the real world: in which case knowledge is only the way to a denial of it, for the world is an error which can be known to be an error. This is the opinion of Schopenhauer on the basis of Kantian presuppositions. Pascal is even more desperate: he com prehended that, in that case, even knowledge must be corrupt and falsified--that revelation was needed even to understand that the world ought to be denied.

412 (1883-1888)

Because we are used to unconditional authorities we have come to need unconditional authorities:—this need is so strong that, even in a critical age such as Kant's, it showed itself superior to the need for criticism and was, in a certain sense, able to subject the entire work of critical reason and put it to its own uses. It proved its superiority once again in the following generation, which was necessarily drawn by its historical instinct toward a relativity of all authority, by pressing into its service even the Hegelian philosophy of evolution, history re-baptized philosophy, and pre senting history as the progressive self-revelation, self-surpassing of moral ideas. Since Plato, philosophy has been dominated by morality. Even in his predecessors, moral interpretations play a decisive role (with Anaximander, the perishing of all things as punishment for their emancipation from pure being; with Hera clitus, the regularity of phenomena as witness to the moral-legal character of the whole world of becoming).

413 (1885)

Ulterior moral motives have hitherto most obstructed the course of philosophy.

(p223)

223

414 (Jan.-Fall 1888) 121

In all ages, one has taken "beautiful feelings" for arguments, the "heaving bosom" for the bellows of divinity, convictions for a "criterion of truth," the need of an opponent for a question mark against wisdom: this falsehood, this counterfeiting, per meates the whole history of philosophy. The skeptics--respectable but rare_excepted, an instinct for intellectual integrity is nowhere evident. At last even Kant tried in all innocence to make this thinkers' corruption scientific by means of the concept "practical reason": he invented a reason expressly for those cases in which one would not need to bother about reason; namely, when the needs of the heart, when morality, when "duty" speaks.

ant tried in all cual integrity is pectable

415 (1885-1886)

Hegel: his popular side the doctrine of war and great men. Right is with the victorious: they represent the progress of man kind. Attempt to prove the dominion of morality by means of history.

Kant: a realm of moral values, withdrawn from us, invisible, real.

Hegel: a demonstrable development, a becoming-visible of the moral realm.

Let us not be deceived either in the Kantian or in the Hegelian manner:-We no longer believe in morality, as they did, and con sequently we have no need to found a philosophy with the aim of justifying morality. Neither the critical nor the historicist phil osophy has any charm for us in this respect:-So what charm has it, then?

416 (1885-1886)

The significance of German philosophy (Hegel): to evolve a pantheism through which evil, error, and suffering are not felt as arguments against divinity. This grandiose project has been misused by the existing powers (state, etc.), as if it sanctioned the rationality of whoever happened to be ruling.

 Schopenhauer, on the other hand, appears as a stubborn morality-man who, in order to justify his moral valuation, finally

becomes a world-denier. Finally a "mystic."

I myself have attempted an aesthetic justification: how is the ugliness of the world possible? I took the will to beauty, to persist in like forms, for a temporary means of preservation and recuperation: fundamentally, however, the eternally-creative appeared to me to be, as the eternal compulsion to destroy, associated with pain. The ugly is the form things assume when we view them with the will to implant a meaning, a new meaning, into what has become meaningless: the accumulated force which compels the creator to consider all that has been created hitherto as unacceptable, ill-constituted, worthy of being denied, ugly!--

417 (1883-1888)

My first solution: Dionysian wisdom. Joy in the destruction of the most noble and at the sight of its progressive ruin: in reality

joy in what is coming and lies in the future, which triumphs over existing things, however good. Dionysian: temporary identification with the principle of life (including the voluptuousness of the martyr).

My innovations. Further development of pessimism: in tellectual pessimism; critique of morality, disintegration of the last consolation. Knowledge of the signs of decay: veils with illusion every firm action; culture isolates, is unjust and therefore strong.

1. My endeavor to oppose decay and increasing weakness of personality, I sought a new center.

2. Impossibility of this endeavor recognized.

3. Thereupon I advanced further down the road of disin tegration where I found new sources of strength for individuals, We have to be destroyers! I perceived that the state of dis integration, in which individual natures can perfect themselves as never before is an image and isolated example of existence in general. To the paralyzing sense of general disintegration and in completeness I opposed the eternal recurrence.

418 (1883-1888)

One seeks a picture of the world in that philosophy in which

(p225)

we feel freest; i.e., in which our most powerful drive feels free to function. This will also be the case with me!

419 (1885) German philosophy as a whole-Leibniz, Kant, Hegel, Scho penhauer, to name the greatest..is the most fundamental form of romanticism and homesickness there has ever been: the longing for the best that ever existed. One is no longer at home anywhere; at last one longs back for that place in which alone one can be at home, because it is the only place in which one would want to be at home; the Greek world! But it is in precisely that direc tion that all bridges are broken-except the rainbow-bridges of concepts! And these lead everywhere, into all the homes and "fatherlands" that existed for Greek souls! To be sure, one must be very subtle, very light, very thin to step across these bridges! But what happiness there is already in this will to spirit uality, to ghostliness almost! How far it takes one from "pressure and stress," from the mechanistic. awkwardness of the natural sciences, from the market hubbub of "modern ideas"! One wants to go back, through the Church Fathers to the Greeks, from the north to the south, from the formulas to the Forms; one still relishes the exit from antiquity, Christianity, as an entrance to it, as in itself a goodly piece of the old world, as a glittering mosaic of ancient concepts and ancient value judgments. Arabesques, flourishes, rococo of scholastic abstractions-still better, that is to say subtler and thinner, than the peasant and mob reality of the European north, still a protest of higher spirituality against the peasants' war and mob rebellion that has become master of spiritual taste in northern Europe and has found its leader in the great "unspiritual man," Luther: in this respect, German philosophy is a piece of counter-Reformation, even of Renaissance, at least will to Renaissance, will to go on with the discovery of antiquity, the digging up of ancient philosophy, above all of the pre-Socratics—the most deeply buried of all Greek temples! A few centuries hence, perhaps, one will judge that all German philosophy derives its real dignity from being a gradual reclamation of the soil of antiquity, and that all claims to "originality" must sound petty and ludicrous in relation to that higher claim of the Germans to have joined anew the bond that seemed to be broken, the bond with the Greeks, the hitherto highest type of man, Today

(p226)





we are again getting close to all those fundamental forms of world interpretation devised by the Greek spirit through Anaxi mander, Heraclitus, Parmenides, Empedocles, Democritus, and Anaxagoras--we are growing more Greek by the day; at first, as is only fair, in concepts and evaluations, as Hellenizing ghosts, as it were: but one day, let us hope, also in our bodies! Herein lies (and has always lain) my hope for the German character!

420 (1884) I do not wish to persuade anyone to philosophy: it is inevit able, it is perhaps also desirable, that the philosopher should be a rare plant. I find nothing more repugnant than didactic praise of philosophy, as one finds it in Seneca, or worse, Cicero. Philosophy has little to do with virtue. Permit me to say that the scholar and scientist,122 too, are fundamentally different from the philoso pher.- What I desire is that the genuine concept of the philosopher should not utterly perish in Germany. There are so many half hearted creatures of all kinds in Germany who would be glad to conceal their ill-constitutedness beneath so noble a name.

421 (1884)

I have to set up the most difficult ideal of the philosopher. Learning is not enough! The scholar is the herd animal in the realm of knowledge who inquires because he is ordered to and because others have done so before him.

422 (1885)

Superstition about philosophers: confusion with scholars and scientists. As if values were inherent in things and all one had to do was grasp them! To what extent they study under the direc tion128 of given values (their hatred of appearance, the body, etc.). Schopenhauer concerning morality (mockery of utilitarianism). At last, confusion goes so far that one regards Darwinism as phil osophy: and now the scholars and scientists dominate. Even French men like Taine inquire, or think they inquire, without being already in possession of a standard of values. Prostration before "facts,"

DOOK Two: Critique of Highest Values a kind of cult. In reality, they destroy the existing evaluations.

Explanation of this misunderstanding. The man who can command rarely appears: he misinterprets himself. One positively wants to repudiate one's own authority and assign it to circum stances. In Germany, the esteem of the critic belongs to the history of awakening manhood. Lessing, etc. (Napoleon on Goethe). As a matter of fact, this movement was again reversed by German romanticism; and the fame of German philosophy depends on that, as if the danger of skepticism had thus been removed and faith could be proyed. Both tendencies culminate in Hegel: at bottom, he generalized German criticism and German romanticism-a kind of dialectical fatalism, but in honor of the spirit, in fact with the submission of the philosopher to reality. The critic prepares the way: no more!

With Schopenhauer the task of the philosopher dawns: the determination of value; still under the domination of eudaemonism.

The ideal of pessimism.

423 (March-June 1888)

Theory and practice 124_ Fateful distinction, as if there were an actual drive for knowledge that, without regard to questions of usefulness and harm, went blindly for the truth; and then, separate from this, the whole world of practical interests

I tried to show, on the other hand, what instincts have been active behind all these pure theoreticians how they have all, under the spell of their instincts, gone fatalistically for something that was "truth" for them for them and only for them. The con flict between different systems, including that between epistemo logical scruples, is a conflict between quite definite instincts (forms of vitality, decline, classes, races, etc.).

The so-called drive for knowledge can be traced back to a drive to appropriate and conquer: the senses, the memory, the instincts, etc. have developed as a consequence of this drive. The quickest possible reduction of the phenomena, economy, the accumulation of the spoils of knowledge (i.e., of world appro priated and made manageable)

Morality is such a curious science because it is in the highest degree practical: so that the position of pure knowledge, scientific integrity, is at once abandoned as soon as the claims of morality

12+ Cf. section 458 below.



(p228)



 must be answered. Morality says: I need many answers--reasons, arguments; scruples can come afterward, or not at all

"How should one act?” - If one considers that one is dealing with a sovereignly developed type that has "acted" for countless millennia, and in which everything has become instinct, expediency, automatism, fatality, then the urgency of this moral question must actually seem ridiculous.

"How should one act?"- Morality has always been a mis understanding: in reality, a species fated to act in this or that fashion wanted to justify itself, by dictating its norm as the universal norm.

"How should one act?" is not a cause but an effect. Morality follows, the ideal comes at the end,

-On the other hand, the appearance of moral scruples (in other words: the becoming-conscious of the values by which one acts) betrays a certain sickliness; strong ages and peoples do not reflect on their rights, on the principles on which they act, on their instincts and reasons. Becoming-conscious is a sign that real morality, i.e., instinctive certainty in actions, is going to the devil--- Every time a new world of consciousness is created, the moralists are a sign of damage, impoverishment, disorganization. The deeply instinctive are shy of logicizing duties: among them are found Pyrrhonic opponents of dialectics and of knowability in general - A virtue is refuted with a "for"

Thesis: the appearance of moralists belongs to an age in which morality is coming to an end,

Thesis: the moralist disintegrates the moral instincts, however much he may suppose himself to be their restorer,

Thesis: that which really drives the moralist is not the moral instincts but the instincts of decadence translated into the formulas of morality-- (he regards it as corruption when the instincts become uncertain).

Thesis: the instincts of decadence, which, through the mora lists, want to become master over the instinctive morality of strong races and ages, are

1. the instincts of the weak and underprivileged;

2. the instincts of the exceptions, the solitaries, the abandoned, of the abortus125 in what is lofty and what is petty.

3. the instincts of those habituated to suffering, who need

a noble interpretation of their condition and therefore must know as little as possible about physiology.

424 (1885) The tartuffery of scientific manners.120_- One must not affect scientific manners where the time has not yet come to be scientific; but even the genuine investigator has to abandon the vanity of affecting a kind of method for which fundamentally the time has not yet come. Just as he must not "falsify" things and thoughts at which he has arrived in another way by imposing on them a false arrangement of deduction and dialectic. Thus Kant falsified in his "morality" his inner psychological tendency; a more recent example is Herbert Spencer's ethics.

One should not conceal and corrupt the facts of how our thoughts have come to us. The profoundest and least exhausted books will probably always have something of the aphoristic and unexpected character of Pascal's Pensées. The driving forces and evaluations have long lain below the surface; what comes out is effect.

I fight all the tartuffery of false scientific manners:

1. in the demonstration, if it does not correspond to the genesis of thoughts;

2. in the claims to methods that are perhaps not yet possible at a certain stage of science;

3. in the claims to objectivity, to cold impersonality, where, as in the case of all valuations, we describe ourselves and our inner experiences in a couple of words. There are ludicrous forms of vanity, e.g., that of Saint-Beuve, who worried all his life that he had now and then exhibited real warmth and passion either "for" or "against," and would gladly have lied that fact out of his life.

425 (Nov. 1887-March 1888) "Objectivity" in the philosopher: moral indifference toward oneself, blindness toward good or ill consequences: lack of scruples about using dangerous means; perversity and multiplicity of charac ter considered and exploited as an advantage.

My profound indifference toward myself: I desire no advan 124 Wissenschaftlichkeit.



(p230)



 tage from my insights and do not avoid the disadvantages that accompany them. Here I include what might be called corruption of the character; this perspective is beside the point: I use my character, but try neither to understand nor to change it-the per sonal calculus of virtue has not entered my head for a moment. It seems to me that one shuts the door on knowledge as soon as one becomes interested in one's own case or, worse, the "saly ation of one's soul"!_ One must not take one's morality too seri ously and not let oneself be deprived of a modest right to its opposite

A sort of inherited wealth of morality is perhaps presupposed here: one senses that one can squander a lot of it and throw it out the window without really impoverishing oneself. Never to feel tempted to admire "beautiful souls", always to know oneself their superior. To encounter the monsters of virtue with an inward mockery; déniaiser la vertu127-a secret pleasure.

To revolve about oneself; no desire to become "better" or in any way "other." Too interested not to throw the tentacles or nets of every morality out to things

426 (March-June 1888)

Toward a psychology of the psychologist. Psychologists as they are possible only beginning with the nineteenth century: no longer those loafers who look a mere three or four steps ahead and are almost content to burrow inside themselves. We psychologists of the future--we have little patience with introspection: we almost take it for a sign of degeneration when an instrument tries "to know itself": we are instruments of knowledge and would like to possess all the naiveté and precision of an instrument-con sequently, we must not analyze ourselves, "know" ourselves. First mark of the self-preservative instinct of the great psychologist: he never seeks himself, he has no eyes for himself, no interest or curiosity in himself123. The great egoism of our dominating will requires that we shut our eyes to ourselves—that we must seem to be "impersonal," "désintéressé," "objective"!-oh, how much we are the opposite of this! Just because we are to an eccentric degree psychologists.

(p2). Critique of Greek Philosophy

427 (Nov. 1887-March 1888)

The appearance of the Greek philosophers from Socrates onwards is a symptom of decadence; the anti-Hellenic instincts come to the top

The "Sophist" is still completely Hellenic-including Anaxa goras, Democritus, the great lonians--but as a transitional form. The polis loses its faith in the uniqueness of its culture, in its right to rule over every other polis One exchanges cultures, i.e., "the gods"-one thereby loses faith in the sole prerogative of the deus autochthonus: Good and evil of differing origin are mingled: the boundary between good and evil is blurred. This is the "Sophist"_

The "philosopher," on the other hand, is the reaction: he desires the old virtue. He sees the grounds of decay 20 in the decay of institutions, he desires old institutions;-he sees the decay in the decay of authority: he seeks new authorities (travels abroad, into foreign literatures, into exotic religions ); he desires the ideal polis after the concept "polis" has had its day (approximately as the Jews held firm as a "people" after they had fallen into slavery).. They are interested in all tyrants: they want to restore virtue by force majeure.

Gradually everything genuinely Hellenic is made responsible for the state of decay (and Plato is just as ungrateful to Pericles, Homer, tragedy, rhetoric, as the prophets were to David and Saul). The decline of Greece is understood as an objection to the

128 "Of decay": uncertain reading; M$ illegible.



(p232)



 foundations of Hellenic culture: basic error of philosophers . Conclusion: the Greek world perishes. Cause: Homer, myth, the ancient morality, etc.

The anti-Hellenic development of the philosophers' value judgment:--the Egyptian ("life after death" as a court of law ); the Semitic (the "dignity of the sage," the "sheik");-the Pythago reans, the subterranean cults, silence, terrorization with a beyond, mathematics; the religious valuation, a kind of traffic with the cosmos;-the priestly, ascetic, transcendental;- dialectic--surely a repellent and pedantic concept splitting already in Plato? Decline of good taste in spiritual matters: one is already insensitive to the ugliness and noisiness of all direct dialectics.

Two decadence movements and extremes run side by side: (a) sensual, charmingly wicked: decadence, loving art and show, and (b) gloomy religio-moral pathos, Stoic self-hardening, Platonic slander of the senses, preparation of the soil for Christianity.

428 (March-June 1888)

How far psychologists have been corrupted by the moral idiosyncrasy:--not one of the ancient philosophers had the courage for a theory of the "unfree will" (i.e., for a theory that denies morality);-no one had the courage to define the typical element in pleasure, every sort of pleasure ("happiness") as the feeling of power: for to take pleasure in power was considered immoral; -no one had the courage to conceive virtue as a consequence of immorality (of a will to power) in the service of the species (or of the race or polis), for the will to power was considered immorality.

In the entire evolution of morality, truth never appears: all the conceptual elements employed are fictions; all the psychologica accepted are falsifications; all the forms of logic dragged into this realm of lies are sophistries. What distinguishes moral philosophers themselves is a complete absence of cleanliness and intellectual self-discipline: they take "beautiful feelings" for arguments: they regard their "heaving bosom" as the bellows of divinity- Moral philosophy is the scabrous period in the history of the spirit. 180

The first great example: in the name of morality, under the patronage or morality, an unheard-of wrong was perpetrated, in

*** Cf. section 414 above.

(p233)

fact a piece of decadence in every respect. One cannot insist too strongly upon the fact that the great Greek philosophers represent the decadence of every kind of Greek excellence and make it contagious "Virtue" made completely abstract was the greatest seduction to make oneself abstract: i. e., to detach oneself.

It is a very remarkable moment: the Sophists verge upon the first critique of morality; the first insight into morality:-they juxtapose the multiplicity (the geographical relativity) of the moral value judgments:--they let it be known that every morality can be dialetically justified; i.e., they divine that all attempts to give reasons for morality are necessarily sophistical a proposition later proved on the grand scale by the ancient philosophers, from Plato onwards (down to Kant);--they postulate the first truth that a "morality-in-itself," a "good-in-itself" do not exist, that it is a swindle to talk of "truth" in this field.

Where was intellectual integrity in those days?

The Greek culture of the Sophists had developed out of all the Greek instincts; it belongs to the culture of the Periclean age as necessarily as Plato does not: it has its predecessors in Heraclitus, in Democritus, in the scientific types of the old philosophy; it finds expression in, e.g., the high culture of Thucydides. And it has ultimately shown itself to be right: every advance in episte mological and moral knowlege has reinstated the Sophists Our contemporary way of thinking is to a great extent Heraclitean, Démocritean, and Protagorean: it suffices to say it is Protagorean, because Protagoras represented a synthesis of Heraclitus and Democritus.

(Plato: a great Cagliostro-remember how Epicurus judged him;131 how Timon, the friend of Pyrrho, judged him Is Plato's integrity beyond question?-- But we know at least that he wanted to have taught as absolute truth what he himself did not regard as even conditionally true; namely, the separate existence and separate immortality of "souls.")

429 (March-June 1888)

The Sophists are no more than realists: they formulate the values and practices common to everyone on the level of values

The WILL TO POWER

they possess the courage of all strong spirits to know their own immorality

Do you suppose perchance that these little Greek free cities, which from rage and envy would have liked to devour each other, were guided by philanthropic and righteous principles? Does one reproach Thucydides for the words he put into the mouths of the Athenian ambassadors when they negotiated with the Melians on the question of destruction or submission?

Only complete Tartuffes could possibly have talked of virtue in the midst of this terrible tension-or men living apart, hermits, refugees, and emigrants from reality--people who negated in order to be able to live themselves

The Sophists were Greeks: when Socrates and Plato took up the cause of virtue and justice, they were Jews or I know not what- Grote's tactics in defense of the Sophists are false: he wants to raise them to the rank of men of honor and ensigns of morality--but it was their honor not to indulge in any swindle with big words and virtues

430 (March-June 1888)

The great rationality of all education in morality has always been that one tried to attain to the certainty of an instinct: so that neither good intentions nor good means had to enter con sciousness as such. As the soldier exercises, so should man learn to act. In fact, this unconsciousness belongs to any kind of per fection: even the mathematician employs his combinations un consciously

What, then, is the significance of the reaction of Socrates, who recommended dialectics as the road to virtue and made mock when morality did not know how to justify itself logically?- As if this were not part of its value-without unconsciousness it is no good

Positing proofs as the presupposition for personal excellence in virtue signified nothing less than the disintegration of Greek instincts. They are themselves types of disintegration, all these great "virtuous men" and word-spinners.

In prari, this means that moral judgments are torn from their conditionality, in which they have grown and alone possess any meaning, from their Greek and Greek-political ground and soil, to be denaturalized under the pretense of sublimation. The great concepts "good" and "just" are severed from the presup

(p235) positions to which they belong and, as liberated "ideas," become objects of dialectic. One looks for truth in them, one takes them for entities or signs of entities: one invents a world where they are at home, where they originate

In summa: the mischief has already reached its climax in Plato. And then one had need to invent the abstractly perfect man as well:--good, just, wise, a dialectician-in short, the scare crow of the ancient philosopher: a plant removed from all soil; a humanity without any particular regulating instincts; a virtue that "proves" itself with reasons. The perfectly absurd "individuum" in itselfl unnaturalness of the first water

In short, the consequence of the denaturalization of moral values was the creation of a degenerate type of man-"the good man;" "the happy man," "the wise man."- Socrates represents a moment of the profoundest perversity in the history of values.

431 (1885-1886 and 1888)

Socrates.132. This reversal of taste in favor of dialectics is a great question mark. What was it that really happened?-- Socrates, the roturier133 who accomplished it, achieved by means of it victory over a more noble taste, the taste of the nobility: the mob achieved victory with dialectics. Before Socrates, the dialectical manner was repudiated in good society; one believed it compromised one; youth was warned against it. Why this display of reasons? Why should onę demonstrate? Against others one possessed authority. One commanded; that sufficed. Among one's own, inter pares, one possessed tradition, also an authority: and, finally, one "understood one another"! One simply had no place for dialectic. Besides, one mistrusted such public presentation of one's arguments. Honest things do not display their reasons in that way. There is something indecent about showing all one's cards. What can be "demonstrated" is of little worth.

The instinct of all party orators knows, moreover, that dia lectics inspire mistrust, that they are very unconvincing. Nothing is easier to expunge than the effect of a dialectician. Dialectics can

only be an emergency measure. One must experience an emerg ency, one must be obliged to extort one's rights: otherwise one makes no use of dialectics. That is why the Jews were dialecticians, why Reynard the Fox was one, why Socrates was one, One has a merciless weapon in one's hand. One can tyrannize with it. One compromises when one conquers. One leaves it to one's victim to prove that he is not an idiot. One makes others furious and helpless, while one remains the embodiment of cool, trium phant reasonableness oneself-one deprives one's opponent's in telligence of potency:

The irony of the dialectician is a form of mob revenge: the ferocity of the oppressed finds an outlet in the cold knife-thrust of the syllogism

In Plato, as a man of overexcitable sensuality and enthusiasm, the charm of the concept had grown so strong that he involuntarily honored and deified the concept as an ideal Form. Intoxication by dialectic: as the consciousness of exercising mastery over oneself by means of it as a tool of the will to power.

432134 (March-June 1888)

The problem of Socrates. The two antitheses: the tragic disposition, the Socratic disposition-measured according to the law of life.

To what extent the Socratic disposition is a phenomenon of decadence: to what extent, however, a robust health and strength is still exhibited in the whole habitus, in the dialectics, efficiency, and self-discipline of the scientific man the health of the plebeian; his wickedness, esprit frondeur,133 his cunning, his canaille au fond138 are held in check by shrewdness; "ugly").

Making ugly: self-mockery, dialectical dryness, shrewdness as tyrant in opposition to a "tyrant" (instinct). Everything is exaggerated, eccentric, caricature, in Socrates, a buffo with the instincts of Voltaire. He discover a new form of agon;137 he is the first fencing master to the leading circles of Athens; he represents

BOOK TWO: Critique of Highest Values nothing but the highest form of shrewdness: he calls it "virtue" (-he divined it to be deliverance: he was not shrewd from choice, it was de rigueur138); to have oneself under control, so as to go into battle with reasons and not with affects the cunning of Spinoza-the unravelling of the errors caused by affects) ;-to discover that one can capture anyone in whom one produces affects, to discover that affects proceed illogically; practice in self-mockery, so as to damage the feeling of rancor at its roots.

I try to understand from what partial and idiosyncratic states the Socratic problem derives: his equalization of reason = virtue = happiness. It was with this absurdity of a doctrine of identity that he fascinated: the philosophers of antiquity never again freed them selves from this fascination

Absolute lack of objective interest: hatred for science; the idiosyncrasy of feeling oneself as a problem. Socrates' acoustic hallucination: morbid element: When the spirit is rich and inde pendent it most resists any preoccupation with morality. How came it that Socrates was a monomaniac in regard to morality? In emergencies, “practical" philosophy steps at once to the fore. Morality and religion as chief interests are signs of an emergency.

433139 (March-June 1888) Shrewdness, clarity, severity and logicality as weapons against the ferocity of the drives. These must be dangerous and threaten destruction: otherwise there would be no sense in develop ing shrewdness to the point of making it into a tyrant. To make a tyrant of shrewdness:--but for that the drives must be tyrants. This is the problem. In those days it was a very timely problem. Reason became = virtue = happiness.

Solution: The Greek philosophers rest on the same funda mental facts of inner experience as Socrates: five steps from ex cess, from anarchy, from intemperance-all men of decadence. They need him as a physician; logic as will to power, to self mastery, to "happiness." The ferocity and anarchy of the instincts in the case of Socrates is a symptom of decadence. The super fetation of logic and of clarity of reason included. Both are abnor malities, both belong together.

Critique. Decadence betrays itself in this preoccupation with

 "happiness" (i.e., with "salvation of the soul," i.e., to feel one's condition as a danger). The fanaticism of its interest in "happi ness" indicates the pathological nature of the hidden cause: it was a life-or-death interest. To be reasonable or perish was the alternative before which they all stood. The moralism of the Greek philosophers indicates that they felt themselves to be in danger

434 (March-June 1888) Why everything resolved itself into play-acting.- The rudi mentary psychology that considered only the conscious motives of men (as causes), that took "consciousness" for an attribute of the soul, that sought a will (i.e., an intention) behind all action: it needed, first, only to answer "Happiness" to the question: What do men want? (one dared not say "Power": that would have been immoral);- consequently there is in all the actions of men the intention of attaining happiness. Secondly: if man does in fact not achieve happiness, why is it? Because he blunders in respect of the means.. What is unfailingly the means to happiness? Answer: virtue.- Why virtue?-- Because it is supremely rational and because rationality makes it impossible to err in the choice of means: it is as reason that virtue is the way to happiness. Dialectic is the constant occupation of virtue, because it excludes all clouding of the intellect and all affects.

In fact, man does not want "happiness." Pleasure is a feeling of power; if one excludes the affects, then one excludes the states that give the highest feeling of power, consequently of pleasure. The highest rationality is a cold, clear state very far from giving that feeling of happiness that intoxication of any kind brings with

The philosophers of antiquity combat everything that intoxi cates—that impairs the absolute coldness and neutrality of the consciousness- They were consistent with their false presupposi tion; that consciousness is the exalted, the supreme state, the precondition of perfection-whereas the opposite is true

To the extent that it is willed, to the extent that it is conscious, there is no perfection in action of any kind. The philosophers of antiquity were the greatest duffers in practice because they con demned themselves to be duffers in theory— In praxi, everything resolved itself into play-acting; and whoever saw through this,

(p239)

e.g., Pyrrho, judged as everyone did, namely that in goodness and integrity "little people” were far superior to philosophers.

All the more profound natures of antiquity were disgusted with the philosophers of virtue: they were looked upon as quarrel some and play actors. (Judgment on Plato: that of Epicurus, 140 that of Pyrrho).

Result: little people are superior to them in their way of living, in patience, in goodness and mutual assistance: approxi mately the claim made by Dostoevsky or Tolstoy for his muzhiks: they are more philosophical in practice, they meet the exigencies of life more courageously

435 (March-June 1888)

Toward a critique of the philosopher. It is a self-deception of philosophers and moralists to imagine that they escape decadence by opposing it. That is beyond their will; and, however little they acknowledge it, one later discovers that they were among the most powerful promoters of decadence.

[Let us take 141 the philosophers of Greece, e.g., Plato. He severed the instincts from the polis, from contest, from military efficiency, from art and beauty, from the mysteries, from belief in tradition and ancestors- He was the seducer of the nobility: he was himself seduced by the roturier Socrates---He negated all the presuppositions of the “noble Greek" of the old stamp, made dialectic an everyday practice, conspired with tyrants, pursued politics of the future and provided the example of the most com pleto severance of the instincts from the past. He is profound, passionate in everything anti-Hellenic

These great philosophers represent one after the other the typical forms of decadence: the moral-religious idiosyncrasy, an archism, nihilism (adiaphora),142 cynicism, obduracy, hedonism, reaction.

(p240)



 The question of "happiness," of "virtue," of "salvation of the soul" is the expression of physiological contradictoriness in these types of decline: their instincts lack a center of gravity, a purpose.

436 (1885-1886)

To what extent dialectic and faith in reason still rest on moral prejudices. With Plato we are, as former inhabitants of an intel ligible world of the good, still in possession of a heritage from that time: divine dialectic, as proceeding from the good, leads to all things good therefore, as it were, "backwards"--). Even Des cartes had a notion of the fact that in a fundamentally Christian moral mode of thought, which believes in a good God as the creator of things, only God's veracity guarantees to us the judgments of our senses. Apart from a religious sanction and guarantee of our senses and rationality where should we derive a right to trust in existence! That thinking is a measure of actuality--that what can not be thought, is not-is a rude non plus ultra of a moralistic trustfulness (in an essential truth-principle at the bottom of things), in itself a mad assumption, which experience contradicts every moment. We are altogether unable to think anything at all just as it is

437 (March-June 1888)

The real philosophers of Greece are those before Socrates 143 (--with Socrates something changes). They are all noble persons, setting themselves apart from people and state, 144 traveled, serious to the point of somberness, with a slow glance, no strangers to state affairs and diplomacy. They anticipate all the great concep tions of things: they themselves represent these conceptions, they bring themselves into a system. Nothing gives a higher idea of the Greek spirit than this sudden fruitfulness in types, than this in voluntary completeness in the erection of the great possibilities of the philosophical ideal.- I seen only one original figure in those

(p241) that came after: a late arrival but necessarily the last--the nihilist Pyrrho:-his instinct was opposed to all that had come to the top in the meantime: the Socratics, Plato, the artist's optimism145 of Heraclitus. (Pyrrho goes back, through Protagoras, to Democ ritus-).

Sagacious weariness: Pyrrho. To live a lowly life among the lowly. No pride. To live in the common way; to honor and believe what all believe. On guard against science and spirit, also against all that inflates

Simple: indescribably patient, carefree, mild. Apatheia, 148 or rather praótes,147 A Buddhist for Greece, grown up amid the tumult of the schools, a latecomer; weary; the protest of weariness against the zeal of the dialecticians; the unbelief of weariness in the importance of all things. He had seen Alexander, he had seen the Indian penitents. To such refined latecomers, everything lowly, everything poor, even everything idiotic is seductive. It has a narcotic effect: it relaxes (Pascal). On the other hand, in the midst of the crowd and confounded with everyone else, they feel a little warmth: these weary people need warmth

To overcome contradiction; no contest; no will to distinction; to deny the Greek instincts. (Pyrrho lived with his sister who was a midwife.) To disguise wisdom so that it no longer distinguishes; to cloak it in poverty and rags; to perform the lowliest offices: to go to market and sell suckling pigs

Sweetness; light; indifference; no virtues that require gestures: to be everyone's equal even in virtue: ultimate self-overcoming, ultimate indifference.

Pyrrho, like Epicurus, two forms of Greek decadence: related, in hatred for dialectics and for all theatrical virtues—these two together were in those days called philosophy—; deliberately hold ing in low esteem that which they loved; choosing common, even despised names for it; representing a state in which one is neither sick nor well, neither alive nor dead

Epicurus more naive, idyllic, grateful; Pyrrho more traveled, experienced, nihilistic-- His life was a protest against the great doctrine of identity (happiness = virtue = knowledge). One can

not promote the right way of life through science: wisdom does not make "wise"- The right way of life does not want happiness, turns away from happiness

438 (Spring 1888)

The struggle against the "old faith" as undertaken by Epicurus was, in a strict sense, a struggle against pre-existing Christianity a struggle against the old world grown senile and sick, already gloomy, 'moralized, soured by feelings of guilt.

Not the "moral corruption" of antiquity, but precisely its moralization is the prerequisite through which alone Christianity could become master of it. Moral fanaticism (in short: Plato) destroyed paganism, by revaluing its values and poisoning its innocence. .

We ought finally to understand that what was then destroyed was higher than what became master!

Christianity has grown out of psychological decay, could only take root in decayed soil.

439 (March-June 1888)

Scientific manners: as training or as instinct. In the Greek philosophers I see a decline of the instincts: otherwise they could not have blundered so far as to posit the conscious state as more valuable. Intensity of consciousness stands in inverse ratio to ease and speed of cerebral transmission. Among Greek philoso phers the reverse opinion about instinct prevailed: which is always a sign of weakened instincts.

We must in fact seek perfect life where it has become least conscious (i.e., least aware of its logic, its reasons, its means and intentions, its utility). The return to the facts of bon sens, of the bon homme, of the "little people" of all kinds. The stored-up in tegrity and shrewdness of generations which are never conscious of their principles and are even a little afraid of principles. The demand for a virtue that reasons is not reasonable A philo sopher is compromised by such a demand.

When morality

.

BOOK TWO: Critique of Highest Values equity-has been as it were stored up through the practice of a whole succession of generations, then the total force of this ac cumulated virtue radiates even into that sphere where integrity is most seldom found, into the spiritual sphere. In all becoming conscious there is expressed a discomfiture of the organism; it has to try something new, nothing is sufficiently adapted for it, there is toil, tension, strain-all this constitutes becoming-conscious--

Genius resides in instinct; goodness likewise. One acts perfectly only when one acts instinctively. Even from the viewpoint of morality, all conscious thinking is merely tentative, usually the reverse of morality. Scientific integrity is always ruptured when the thinker begins to reason: try the experiment of putting the wisest men on the most delicate scales by making them talk about morality—

It could be proved that all conscious thinking would also show a far lower standard of morality than the thinking of the same man when it is directed by his instincts.148

144 According to 1911, p. 505, "This aph. (sic, In fact these are not "aphorisms" but mere notes) replaces aph. 243 of the old vol. XV (the first edition of The Will to Power, published in 1901), which represents another formulation of the same content." Here is the other version:

"When enough subtlety, bravery, caution, and moderation have been collected through the practice of a long chain of generations, then the instinc tive power of such incorporated virtue radiates even into the most spiritual matters and that phenomenon becomes visible which we call intellectual integrity. This is very rare: among philosophers it is lacking:

"One can take the scientific manner or, morally speaking the intellectual integrity of a thinker, the subtlety, bravery, caution, and moderation that have become instinct in him and transposed even into the most spiritual matters, and place them on the most delicate scales--by letting him talk about morality: then the most famous philosophers show that their scientific manner is as yet only a conscious affair, a beginning, a 'good will,' some thing laborious—and as soon as their instincts begin to speak, as soon as they moralize, it is all over with the discipline and subtlety of their con science.

"The scientific manner whether mere training and external or the final result of long discipline and moral practice: in the former case it abdicates as soon as the instincts speak (e.g., the religious instincts or those of the concept of duty); in the latter case it replaces these instincts and no longer grants them admission, feeling they represent uncleanliness and seductions"

Although omitted in most editions, this version is printed in an appen dix in both the Grossoktay edition and the Musarion edition, as #1074. Schlechta omits it. It is included here not only as a matter of principle but also for three additional reasons; (1) it is interesting to see how the editors of the various editions proceeded; (2) it is even more interesting to be able to compare two, alternative drafts from Nietzsche's hand; and (3) parts of this draft compare very favorably with the one included in the text.



(p244)





441 (March-June 1888)

The struggle against Socrates, Plato, all the Socratic schools, proceeds from the profound instinct that one does not make men better when one represents to them that virtue is demonstrable and asks for reasons

Ultimately, it is the measly fact that the agonal instinct in all these born dialecticians compelled them to glorify their personal ability as the highest quality and to represent all other good things as conditioned by it. The anti-scientific spirit of this entire "phi losophy": it is determined to be in the right.

442 (March-June 1888)

This is extraordinary. We find from the beginning of Greek philosophy onwards a struggle against science with the means of an epistemology or skepticism: and with what object? Always for the good of morality

(Hatred for physicists and physicians.) Socrates, Aristippus, the Megarian school, the Cynics, Epicurus, Pyrrhoa general assault on knowledge for the good of morality

(Hatred for dialectics also.) A problem remains: they ap proach the Sophists in order to get rid of science. On the other hand, the physicists are all so completely subjected as to take up the schema of truth, 149 of real being, into the fundamentals of their science; e.g., the atom, the four elements (juxtaposition of beings to explain multiplicity and change-). Contempt for ob jective interest is taught: return to the practical interest, the personal utility of all knowledge

The struggle against science is directed against (1) its pathos (objectivity), (2) its means (i.e., against its utility), (3) its re sults (as childish).

It is the same struggle that is later conducted by the church in the name of piety: the church inherited the entire arsenal of antiquity for its struggle, Epistemology played in this the same role as it did in the case of Kant, in the case of the Indians-One does not want to be troubled by it: one wants one's hands free for one's "course."

What were they really defending themselves against? Against

199 "Truth" is an uncertain reading of an illegible word.

(p245) obligation, against legality, against the compulsion to go hand in hand- I believe one calls this freedom

Decadence manifests itself in this: the instinct of solidarity is so degenerate that solidarity is felt as tyranny: they want no authority, no solidarity, no lining up with the rank and file to adopt its ignobly stack pace. They hate the measured step, the tempo of science, they hate the lack of urgency, the perserverance, the indifference to himself of the man of science,

443 (March-June 1888)

Fundamentally, morality is hostile to science: Socrates was so already--and for this reason, that science takes things seriously that have nothing to do with "good" and "evil," consequently makes the feeling for "good" and "evil” seem less important. For morality demands that the whole man and all his forces should stand in its service: it considers it a squandering on the part of one not rich enough to squander when man concerns himself seriously with plants and stars. This is why scientific procedures rapidly declined in Greece once Socrates had introduced into science the disease of moralizing; the height attained in the dis position of a Democritus, Hippocrates, and Thucydides was not attained a second time.

444 (March-June 1888)

Problem of the philosopher and the man of science.--In fluence of age; depressive habits (staying-at-home à la Kant; overwork; insufficient nourishment of the brain; reading). More essentially: whether a tendency toward generalities is not already a symptom of decadence; objectivity as disintegration of the will ( to be able to stand so distant-) This presupposes a great adiaphora in regard to the powerful drives: a kind of isolation, exceptional stance, resistance in regard to the normal drives.

Type: desertion of the homeland; further and further afield; increasing exoticism; the old imperatives become dumb cer tainly this continual questioning "whither?" ("happiness") is a sign of disengagement from forms of organization, of a breaking loose.

Problem: whether the man of science is more of a symptom of decadence than the philosophers:-he is not disengaged as a

(p246)





whole, only a part of him is absolutely dedicated to knowledge, trained to one corner and perspective--he needs all the virtues of a strong race and health, great severity, manliness, shrewdness. He is a symptom more of a higher multiplicity of culture than of its weariness. The scholar of decadence is a bad scholar. While the philosopher of decadence has counted, hitherto at least, as the typical philosopher.

445 (Jan.-Fall 1888)

Nothing is rarer among philosophers than intellectual integrity: perhaps they say the opposite, perhaps they even believe it. But a condition of their entire occupation is that only certain truths are admitted; they know that which they have to prove; that they are at one over these "truths" is virtually their means of recognizing one another as philosophers. There are, e.g., moral truths. But a faith in morals is not a proof of morality: there are cases---and the case of the philosopher is one-in which such a faith is simply a piece of immorality.

446 (March-June 1888)

What, then, is regressive in the philosopher?- That he teaches that his qualities are the necessary and sole qualities for the attain ment of the "highest good" (e.g., dialectic, as with Plato). That he orders men of all kinds gradatim 150 up to his type as the highest. That he despises what is generally esteemed that he opens up á gulf between priestly values and worldly values. Thät he knows what is true, what God is, what the goal is, what the way is

The typical philosopher is here an absolute dogmatist;—if he has need of skepticism, it is so as to be able to speak dog matically about his main interest.

447 (March-June 1888)

The philosopher in opposition to his rivals; e.g., in opposi tion to science: then he becomes a skeptic; then he reserves to himself a form of knowledge that he denies the man of science; then he goes hand in hand with the priest so as not151 to arouse

160 By degrees.

151 "Not" is missing in the MS but was very reasonably inserted by the German editors.

(p247)

the suspicion of atheism, materialism; he regards an attack on himself as an attack on morality, virtue, religion, order-he knows how to discredit his opponents as "seducers" and "underminers": then he goes hand in hand with power.

The philosopher in a struggle with other philosophers-he tries to compel them to appear as anarchists, unbelievers, opponents of authority. In summa: in so far as he struggles, he struggles just as a priest does, just as priesthood does.

3. Truth and Error of Philosophers

448 (Manuscript source uncertain) 162 Philosophy defined by Kant as "the science of the limitations of reason!!!

449 (Spring-Fall 1887)

Philosophy as the art of discovering truth: according to Aristotle. Contradicted by the Epicureans, who made use of Aristotle's sensualistic theory of knowledge: they rejected the search for truth with irony: "Philosophy as an art of living."

450 (Spring-Fall 1887)

The three great naiveties: Knowledge as a means to happiness (as if--), as a means to virtue (as if ),

as a means to "denial of life"--to the extent that it is a means to disappointment-(as if-)

451 (Manuscript source uncertain) 168

That there should be a "truth" which one could somehow approach-!

452 (Jan.-Fall 1888)

Error and ignorance are fateful.

The view that truth is

(p248)





found and that ignorance and error are at an end is one of the most potent seductions there is. Supposing it is believed, then the will to examination, investigation, caution, experiment is paralyzed;

it can even count as criminal, namely as doubt concerning truth

“Truth” is therefore more fateful than error and ignorance, because it cuts off the forces that work toward enlightenment and knowledge.

The affect of laziness now takes the side of "truth" -- ("think ing is distress, misery!"); as do order, rule, happiness in possess ing, pride in wisdom--vanity in summa:-it is more comfortable to obey than to examine; it is more flattering to think "I possess the truth" than to see only darkness around one-above all: it is reassuring, it gives confidence, it alleviates life---it "improves" the character, to the extent that it lessens mistrust. "Peace of soul," "a quiet conscience": all inventions made possible only by pre supposing that truth has been found.- "By their fruits shall ye know them" "Truth" is truth, for it makes men better. The process goes on: everything good, all success, is placed to the credit of "truth."

This is the proof of strength:154 the happiness, the content ment, the well-being of the community, as of the individual, are henceforth understood as the consequence of belief in morality

The converse: ill success is attributed to lack of faith

453 (Jan.-Fall 1888)

The causes of error lie just as much in the good will as in the ill will156] of man-i in a thousand cases he conceals reality from himself, he falsifies it, so as not to suffer from his good for ill] 166 will. E.g., God as the director of human destiny: or the interpretation of his own petty destiny as if everything were con trived and sent with a view to the salvation of his soul—this lack of "philology," which to a more subtle intellect would have to count as uncleanliness and counterfeiting, is, on the average, per formed under the inspiration of good will. Good will, "noble feelings," "lofty states" are in the means they employ just as much

154 See Antichrist, sections 50 f (Portable Nietzsche); also in connection with sections 453-57.

*** Interpolated by Nietzsche, brackets mine. ** Interpolated by German editors, brackets mine.

(p249)

counterfeiters and deceivers as the affects repudiated by morality and called egoistic: love, hate, revenge.

Errors are what mankind has had to pay for most dearly: and, on the whole, it is the errors of "good will" which have harmed it most profoundly. The illusion that makes happy is more per nicious than that which has immediate bad consequences: the latter sharpens and purifies157 reason and makes it more mistrustful --the former lulls it to sleep..

Beautiful feelings, sublime agitations, are, physiologically speaking, among the narcotics: their misuse has precisely the same consequences as the misuse of any other opiate-neuras thenia

454 (1888)

Error is the most expensive luxury that man can permit him self; and if the error happens to be a physiological error, then it is perilous to life. What, consequently, has man hitherto paid for most dearly? For his "truths”: for they have all been errors in physiologicis

455 (Jan.-Fall 1888) Psychological confusions: the demand for belief-confused with the "will to truth" (e.g., in the case of Carlyle).158 But in the same way, the demand for unbelief has been confused with the "will to truth" ( the need to get free from a belief, for a hundred reasons: to be in the right against some "believers"). What inspires the skeptic? Hatred of the dogmatist-of a need for rest, a weariness, as in the case of Pyrrho,

The advantages that one anticipated from truth were ad vantages resulting from belief in it:-in itself, that is, truth could be altogether painful, harmful, fateful One likewise disputed the "truth" only when one promised oneself advantages from one's victory-.g., freedom from the ruling powers.

The methods of truth were not invented from motives of truth, but from motives of power, of wanting to be superior.

How is truth proved? By the feeling of enhanced power159— 107 Reading uncertain, word illegible. 168 Cf. Twilight, "Skirmishes," section 12 (Portable Nietzsche, p. 521).

Martyrs.- In order to combat anything founded on rever ence, the attacker must be possessed of a somewhat audacious, relentless, even shameless disposition--- Now if one considers that mankind has for millennia sanctified as truths only what was error, that is has even branded any critique of these as a sign of a wicked disposition, then one is bound to confess with regret that a goodly amount of immorality was needed to provide the initiative for aggression, in other words for reason

These immoralists should be forgiven for always having posed as "martyrs to truth": the truth is that it was not the drive to truth which made them negate, but disintegration, sacrilegious skepticism, pleasure in adventure. In other cases, it is personal rancor that drives them into the domain of problems--they combat problems in order to be in the right against particular people. But it is revenge above all that science has been able to employ— the revenge of the oppressed, those who had been pushed aside and, in fact, oppressed by the prevailing truth

Truth, that is to say, the scientific method, was grasped and promoted by those who divined in it a weapon of war—an in

What remained to be done was accomplished by persecution, passion and the insecurity of the persecuted.

mhatred grew and consequently the precondition for remaining scientific was diminished. Ultimately, they all wanted to be right in the same absurd fashion as their opponents — The words "conviction," "faith," the pride of martyrdom--these are the least favorable states for the advancement of knowledge. The opponents of truth at last reaccepted the entire subjective manner of deciding questions of truth, namely by poses, sacrifices, heroic resolutions and thus prolonged the dominion of antiscientific methods. As martyrs they compromised their own deed.

458 (March-June 1888) 101

Dangerous distinction between "theoretical" and "practical," e.g., in the case of Kant, but also in the case of the ancients: they act as if pure spirituality presented them with the problems of knowledge and metaphysics; they act as if practice must be judged by its own measure, whatever the answer of theory may be.

Against the former I direct my psychology of philosophers: their most alienated calculations and their "spirituality" are still only the last pallid impression of a physiological fact; the voluntary is absolutely lacking, everything is instinct, everything has been directed along certain lines from the beginning

Against the latter I ask whether we know of any other method of acting well than always thinking well; the latter is an action, and the former presupposes thought. Have we a different method for judging the value of a way of life from judging the value of a theory: by induction, by comparison?

The naive believe that we are better equipped here, that here we know what is "good"-philosophers repeat it. We con clude that a faith is here at work, nothing more

"One must not act"-said their more consistent brothers, the Buddhists, and conceived a rule of conduct to liberate one from actions

To accommodate oneself, to live as the "common man" lives, to hold right and good what he holds right: this is to submit to the herd instinct. One must take one's courage and severity so far as to feel such a submission as a disgrace. Not to live with two different standards.- Not to separate theory and practice!

459 (Jan.-Fall 1888) That nothing formerly held true is true What was formerly despised as unholy, forbidden, contemptible, fateful-all these flowers grow today along the lovely paths of truth.

This entire old morality concerns us no more: there is not a concept in it that still deserves respect. We have outlived it. we are no longer coarse and naive enough to have to let ourselves be deceived in this fashion- In more polite words: we are too virtuous for it. And if truth in the old sense was "truth" only because the old morality affirmed it, had a right to affirm it, then it follows that we no longer have need of any former truths, either Our criterion of truth is by no means morality: we refute an opinion by showing it to be dependent on morality, to be in spired by noble feelings.

All these values are empirical and conditional. But he who believes in them, who reverences them, refuses to recognize just this characteristic of them. Philosophers believe one and all in these values, and one form their reverence took was the attempt to inake a priori truths of them. The falsifying character of rever ence

Reverence is the supreme test of integrity: but in the entire history of philosophy there is no intellectual integrity--but only "love of the good"

The absolute lack of methods of testing the value of these values; secondly: reluctance to test values, to take them as being in any way conditional. In the case of moral values, all the antiscientific instincts came together with the object of excluding science

4. Further Considerations for a

Critique of Philosophy

461 (March-June 1888)

Why philosophers are slanderers. The treacherous and blind hostility of philosophers towards the senses162 how much of mob and middle class there is in this hatred!

The common people always consider an abuse of which they feel the ill consequences as an objection to that which is abused: all insurrectionary movements aimed against principles, whether political or economic, argue thus, with the idea of representing an abuse as being necessary to, and inherent in, the principle.

It is a miserable story: man seeks a principle through which he can despise men—he invents a world so as to be able to slander and bespatter this world: in reality, he reaches every time for nothingness and construes nothingness as "God," as "truth," and in any case as judge and condemner of this state of being.“

If one wants a proof of how profoundly and thoroughly the actually barbarous needs of man seek satisfaction, even when he is tamed and "civilized," one should take a look at the "leitmotifs" of the entire evolution of philosophy: a sort of revenge on reality, a malicious destruction of the valuations by which men live, an unsatisfied soul that feels the tamed state as a torture and finds a voluptuous pleasure in a morbid unraveling of all the bonds that tie it to such a state.

The history of philosophy is a secret raging against the pre conditions of life, against the value feelings of life, against partisan ship in favor of life. Philosophers have never hesitated to affirm a world provided it contradicted this world and furnished them with a pretext for speaking ill of this world. It has been hitherto the grand school of slander; and it has imposed itself to such an extent that today our science, which proclaims itself the advocate

143 At this point the German editors saw fit to omit the following lines:

"It is not the senses that deceive. Our nose, of which, as far as I know, no philosopher has ever spoken with due respect, is as yet the most delicate scientific (physikalisch) instrument in existence: it is capable of registering vibrations where even the spectroscope fails."

This section, including the passage just cited, was utilized by Nietzsche in Twilight, Chapters III and IV.



(p254)



 of life, has accepted the basic slanderous position and treated this world as apparent, this chain of causes as merely phenomenal. What is it really that hates here?

I fear it is still the Circe of philosophers, morality, that has here bewitched them into having to be slanderers forever-- They believed in moral "truths," they found there the supreme values what else could they do but deny existence more firmly the more they got to know it?--. For this existence is immoral— And this life depends upon immoral preconditions: and all morality denies life

Let us abolish the real world: and to be able to do this we first have to abolish the supreme value hitherto, morality. It suffices to demonstrate that even morality is immoral, in the sense in which immorality has always been condemned. If the tyranny of former values is broken in this way, if we have abolished the "real world," then a new order of values must follow of its own accord.

The apparent world and the world invented by a lie—this is the antithesis. The latter has hitherto been called the "real world," "truth," "God." This is what we have to abolish.

Logic of my conception:

1. Morality as supreme value (master over all phases of philosophy, even over the skeptics). Result: this world is good for nothing, it is not the "real world."

2. What here determines the supreme value? What is morality, really?— The instinct of decadence; it is the exhausted and dis inherited who take revenge in this fashion. Historical proof: phi losophers are always decadents in the service of the nihilistic religioas.

3. The instinct of decadence which appears as will to power. Proof: the absolute immorality of means throughout the entire history of morality.

General insight: the highest values hitherto are a special case of the will to power; morality itself is a special case of im morality.103

10 The short last paragraph was taken by the editors from another more detailed section. At this point the MS had merely: "In this whole movement we have recognized merely a special case of the will to power." The first edition (1901) followed the MS.

Schlechta omits the lines deleted in all other editions; he follows the standard edition and not the manuscript in the final paragraph; and he

464 (1885) I have named those who were unknowingly my workers and precursors. But where may I look with any kind of hope for my kind of philosopher himself, at the least for my need of new phi losophers 2165 In that direction alone where a noble mode of thought is dominant, such as believes in slavery and in many degrecs of bondage as the precondition of every higher culture; where a

prints the second half of the section, beginning with "The history of phi losophy..." (along with the conclusion that does not belong to it) a couple of pages before the first half.

104 The MS goes on: "In The Birth of Tragedy I gave hints concerning the relation of distress' and 'art'; personal education of the philosopher in solitude. The Dionysian."

Schlechta not only omits these lines, following the example of all previ ous editors; he also omits the second paragraph-in which, incidentally, the MS has "Napol." instead of Napoleonic."

creative mode of thought dominates that does not posit the happi ness of repose, the "Sabbath of Sabbaths" as a goal for the world, and honors even in peace the means to new wars;100 a mode of thought that prescribes laws for the future, that for the sake of the future is harsh and tyrannical towards itself and all things of the present; a reckless, "immoral" mode of thought, which wants to develop both the good and the bad qualities in man to their fullest extent, because it feels it has the strength to put both in their right place in the place where each needs the other. But he who thus looks for philosophers today, what prospect has he of finding what he is looking for? Is it not likely that, even with the best Diogenes lantern, he will search about in vain all day and all night? The age possesses the reverse instincts; it wants, first and above all, comfort; it wants, in the second place, publicity and that great actors' hubbub, that great drum banging that appeals to its fun fair tastes; it wants, thirdly, that everyone should fall on his face in the profoundest subjection before the greatest of all lies-it is called "equality of men"--and honor exclusively those virtues that level and equalize. But the rise of the philosopher, as I under stand him, is therewith rendered altogether impossible, notwith standing that it is thought in all innocence to be favorable to him. Indeed, all the world bewails today the evil situation of the phi losopher in earlier times, hemmed in between the stake, bad conscience, and the arrogant wisdom of the Church Fathers: the truth, however, is that precisely this was a much more favorable condition for the education of a powerful, comprehensive, cuoning and audaciously daring spirituality than the conditions of life at present. Today, another kind of spirit, namely the spirit of the demagogue, the spirit of the actor, perhaps also the scholarly beaver- and ant-like spirit, finds conditions favorable. But things are so much the worse even for superior artists: for are they not, almost all of them, perishing from a lack of inner discipline? They are no longer tyrannized over from without by a church's tables of absolute values or those of a court; thus they also no longer learn to develop their "inner tyrants," their will. And what is true of artists is true in a higher and more fateful sense of

465 (Summer-Fall 1888)

I understand by "freedom of spirit" something quite definite: being a hundred times superior167 to philosophers and other disciples of "truth" in severity towards oneself, in cleanliness and courage, in the unconditional will to say No where it is dangerous to say No.I treat previous philosophers as contemptible libertines hiding in the cloak of the woman "truth."
