## 1. General Observations

406 (1885-1886)

Let us get rid of a few superstitions about philosophers that have been common so far!

407 (1884)

Philosophers are prejudiced against appearance, change, pain, death, the corporeal, the senses, fate and bondage, the aimless.

They believe first in: absolute knowledge, (2) in knowledge for the sake of knowledge, (3) in an association between virtue and happiness, (4) in the comprehensibility of human actions. [They are] 118 led by instinctive moral definitions in which former cultural conditions are reflected (more dangerous ones).

408 (1884) What do philosophers lack? (a)118 an historical sense, (b) knowledge of physiology, (c) a goal in the future. The ability to formulate a critique without any irony or moral condemnation.

409 (1885)

Philosophers (1) have had from the first a wonderful capacity for the contradictio in adjecto; (2) they have trusted in concepts as completely as they have mistrusted the senses: they have not stopped to consider that concepts and words are our inheritance from ages in which thinking was very modest and unclear.

What dawns on philosophers last of all: they must no longer accept concepts as a gift, nor merely purify and polish them, but first make and create them, present them and make them con vincing. Hitherto one has generally trusted one's concepts as if

119 Not in the MS. The German editors made other minor changes in this note.

(p221)

they were a wonderful dowry from some sort of wonderland: but they are, after all, the inheritance from our most remote, most foolish as well as most intelligent ancestors. This piety toward what we find in us is perhaps part of the moral element in knowledge. What is needed above all is an absolute skepticism toward all inherited concepts (of the kind that one philosopher perhaps possessed-Plato, of course--for he taught the reverse).

410 (1885-1886) For the Preface120

Deeply mistrustful of the dogmas of epistemology, I loved to look now out of this window, now out of that; I guarded against settling down with any of these dogmas, considered them harmful -and finally: is it likely that a tool is able to criticize its own fitness? - What I noticed was rather that no epistemological skepticism or dogmatism had ever arisen free from ulterior motives

-that it acquires a value of the second rank as soon as one has considered what it was that compelled the adoption of this point of view,

Fundamental insight: Kant as well as Hegel and Schopen hauer--the skeptical-epochistic attitude as well as the historicizing, as well as the pessimistic-have a moral origin. I saw no one who had ventured a critique of moral value feelings: and I soon turned my back on the meagre attempts made to arrive at a description of the origin of these feelings (as by the English and German Darwinists).

How can Spinoza's position, his denial and rejection of moral value judgments, be explained? (It was one consequence of his theodicy!)

411 (Spring-Fall 1887; rey. 1888)

Morality as supreme devaluation.- Either our world is the work and expression (modus) of God: in which case it must be supremely perfect (Leibniz's conclusion) - and one never doubted that one knew what constituted perfection—in which case evil must be only apparent (Spinoza is more radical, applying this to

130 This beading has been deleted in all previous editions. This section is discussed in my Nietzsche, Chapter 2, section II,



(p222)





the concepts good and evil), or must proceed from God's supreme purpose ( perhaps as consequence of a particular mark of favor by God, who allows a choice between good and evil: the privilege of not being an automaton; "freedom" at the risk of making a mistake, of choosing wrongly-e.g., see Simplicius in his com mentary on Epictetus).

Or our world is imperfect, evil and guilt are actual and determined and absolutely inherent in its nature; in which case it cannot be the real world: in which case knowledge is only the way to a denial of it, for the world is an error which can be known to be an error. This is the opinion of Schopenhauer on the basis of Kantian presuppositions. Pascal is even more desperate: he com prehended that, in that case, even knowledge must be corrupt and falsified--that revelation was needed even to understand that the world ought to be denied.

412 (1883-1888)

Because we are used to unconditional authorities we have come to need unconditional authorities:—this need is so strong that, even in a critical age such as Kant's, it showed itself superior to the need for criticism and was, in a certain sense, able to subject the entire work of critical reason and put it to its own uses. It proved its superiority once again in the following generation, which was necessarily drawn by its historical instinct toward a relativity of all authority, by pressing into its service even the Hegelian philosophy of evolution, history re-baptized philosophy, and pre senting history as the progressive self-revelation, self-surpassing of moral ideas. Since Plato, philosophy has been dominated by morality. Even in his predecessors, moral interpretations play a decisive role (with Anaximander, the perishing of all things as punishment for their emancipation from pure being; with Hera clitus, the regularity of phenomena as witness to the moral-legal character of the whole world of becoming).

413 (1885)

Ulterior moral motives have hitherto most obstructed the course of philosophy.

414 (Jan.-Fall 1888) 121

In all ages, one has taken "beautiful feelings" for arguments, the "heaving bosom" for the bellows of divinity, convictions for a "criterion of truth," the need of an opponent for a question mark against wisdom: this falsehood, this counterfeiting, per meates the whole history of philosophy. The skeptics--respectable but rare_excepted, an instinct for intellectual integrity is nowhere evident. At last even Kant tried in all innocence to make this thinkers' corruption scientific by means of the concept "practical reason": he invented a reason expressly for those cases in which one would not need to bother about reason; namely, when the needs of the heart, when morality, when "duty" speaks.

ant tried in all cual integrity is pectable

415 (1885-1886)

Hegel: his popular side the doctrine of war and great men. Right is with the victorious: they represent the progress of man kind. Attempt to prove the dominion of morality by means of history.

Kant: a realm of moral values, withdrawn from us, invisible, real.

Hegel: a demonstrable development, a becoming-visible of the moral realm.

Let us not be deceived either in the Kantian or in the Hegelian manner:-We no longer believe in morality, as they did, and con sequently we have no need to found a philosophy with the aim of justifying morality. Neither the critical nor the historicist phil osophy has any charm for us in this respect:-So what charm has it, then?

416 (1885-1886)

The significance of German philosophy (Hegel): to evolve a pantheism through which evil, error, and suffering are not felt as arguments against divinity. This grandiose project has been misused by the existing powers (state, etc.), as if it sanctioned the rationality of whoever happened to be ruling.

 Schopenhauer, on the other hand, appears as a stubborn morality-man who, in order to justify his moral valuation, finally

becomes a world-denier. Finally a "mystic."

I myself have attempted an aesthetic justification: how is the ugliness of the world possible? I took the will to beauty, to persist in like forms, for a temporary means of preservation and recuperation: fundamentally, however, the eternally-creative appeared to me to be, as the eternal compulsion to destroy, associated with pain. The ugly is the form things assume when we view them with the will to implant a meaning, a new meaning, into what has become meaningless: the accumulated force which compels the creator to consider all that has been created hitherto as unacceptable, ill-constituted, worthy of being denied, ugly!--

417 (1883-1888)

My first solution: Dionysian wisdom. Joy in the destruction of the most noble and at the sight of its progressive ruin: in reality

joy in what is coming and lies in the future, which triumphs over existing things, however good. Dionysian: temporary identification with the principle of life (including the voluptuousness of the martyr).

My innovations. Further development of pessimism: in tellectual pessimism; critique of morality, disintegration of the last consolation. Knowledge of the signs of decay: veils with illusion every firm action; culture isolates, is unjust and therefore strong.

1. My endeavor to oppose decay and increasing weakness of personality, I sought a new center.

2. Impossibility of this endeavor recognized.

3. Thereupon I advanced further down the road of disin tegration where I found new sources of strength for individuals, We have to be destroyers! I perceived that the state of dis integration, in which individual natures can perfect themselves as never before is an image and isolated example of existence in general. To the paralyzing sense of general disintegration and in completeness I opposed the eternal recurrence.

418 (1883-1888)

One seeks a picture of the world in that philosophy in which

(p225)

we feel freest; i.e., in which our most powerful drive feels free to function. This will also be the case with me!

419 (1885) German philosophy as a whole-Leibniz, Kant, Hegel, Scho penhauer, to name the greatest..is the most fundamental form of romanticism and homesickness there has ever been: the longing for the best that ever existed. One is no longer at home anywhere; at last one longs back for that place in which alone one can be at home, because it is the only place in which one would want to be at home; the Greek world! But it is in precisely that direc tion that all bridges are broken-except the rainbow-bridges of concepts! And these lead everywhere, into all the homes and "fatherlands" that existed for Greek souls! To be sure, one must be very subtle, very light, very thin to step across these bridges! But what happiness there is already in this will to spirit uality, to ghostliness almost! How far it takes one from "pressure and stress," from the mechanistic. awkwardness of the natural sciences, from the market hubbub of "modern ideas"! One wants to go back, through the Church Fathers to the Greeks, from the north to the south, from the formulas to the Forms; one still relishes the exit from antiquity, Christianity, as an entrance to it, as in itself a goodly piece of the old world, as a glittering mosaic of ancient concepts and ancient value judgments. Arabesques, flourishes, rococo of scholastic abstractions-still better, that is to say subtler and thinner, than the peasant and mob reality of the European north, still a protest of higher spirituality against the peasants' war and mob rebellion that has become master of spiritual taste in northern Europe and has found its leader in the great "unspiritual man," Luther: in this respect, German philosophy is a piece of counter-Reformation, even of Renaissance, at least will to Renaissance, will to go on with the discovery of antiquity, the digging up of ancient philosophy, above all of the pre-Socratics—the most deeply buried of all Greek temples! A few centuries hence, perhaps, one will judge that all German philosophy derives its real dignity from being a gradual reclamation of the soil of antiquity, and that all claims to "originality" must sound petty and ludicrous in relation to that higher claim of the Germans to have joined anew the bond that seemed to be broken, the bond with the Greeks, the hitherto highest type of man, Today

(p226)





we are again getting close to all those fundamental forms of world interpretation devised by the Greek spirit through Anaxi mander, Heraclitus, Parmenides, Empedocles, Democritus, and Anaxagoras--we are growing more Greek by the day; at first, as is only fair, in concepts and evaluations, as Hellenizing ghosts, as it were: but one day, let us hope, also in our bodies! Herein lies (and has always lain) my hope for the German character!

420 (1884) I do not wish to persuade anyone to philosophy: it is inevit able, it is perhaps also desirable, that the philosopher should be a rare plant. I find nothing more repugnant than didactic praise of philosophy, as one finds it in Seneca, or worse, Cicero. Philosophy has little to do with virtue. Permit me to say that the scholar and scientist,122 too, are fundamentally different from the philoso pher.- What I desire is that the genuine concept of the philosopher should not utterly perish in Germany. There are so many half hearted creatures of all kinds in Germany who would be glad to conceal their ill-constitutedness beneath so noble a name.

421 (1884)

I have to set up the most difficult ideal of the philosopher. Learning is not enough! The scholar is the herd animal in the realm of knowledge who inquires because he is ordered to and because others have done so before him.

422 (1885)

Superstition about philosophers: confusion with scholars and scientists. As if values were inherent in things and all one had to do was grasp them! To what extent they study under the direc tion128 of given values (their hatred of appearance, the body, etc.). Schopenhauer concerning morality (mockery of utilitarianism). At last, confusion goes so far that one regards Darwinism as phil osophy: and now the scholars and scientists dominate. Even French men like Taine inquire, or think they inquire, without being already in possession of a standard of values. Prostration before "facts,"

DOOK Two: Critique of Highest Values a kind of cult. In reality, they destroy the existing evaluations.

Explanation of this misunderstanding. The man who can command rarely appears: he misinterprets himself. One positively wants to repudiate one's own authority and assign it to circum stances. In Germany, the esteem of the critic belongs to the history of awakening manhood. Lessing, etc. (Napoleon on Goethe). As a matter of fact, this movement was again reversed by German romanticism; and the fame of German philosophy depends on that, as if the danger of skepticism had thus been removed and faith could be proyed. Both tendencies culminate in Hegel: at bottom, he generalized German criticism and German romanticism-a kind of dialectical fatalism, but in honor of the spirit, in fact with the submission of the philosopher to reality. The critic prepares the way: no more!

With Schopenhauer the task of the philosopher dawns: the determination of value; still under the domination of eudaemonism.

The ideal of pessimism.

423 (March-June 1888)

Theory and practice 124_ Fateful distinction, as if there were an actual drive for knowledge that, without regard to questions of usefulness and harm, went blindly for the truth; and then, separate from this, the whole world of practical interests

I tried to show, on the other hand, what instincts have been active behind all these pure theoreticians how they have all, under the spell of their instincts, gone fatalistically for something that was "truth" for them for them and only for them. The con flict between different systems, including that between epistemo logical scruples, is a conflict between quite definite instincts (forms of vitality, decline, classes, races, etc.).

The so-called drive for knowledge can be traced back to a drive to appropriate and conquer: the senses, the memory, the instincts, etc. have developed as a consequence of this drive. The quickest possible reduction of the phenomena, economy, the accumulation of the spoils of knowledge (i.e., of world appro priated and made manageable)

Morality is such a curious science because it is in the highest degree practical: so that the position of pure knowledge, scientific integrity, is at once abandoned as soon as the claims of morality

12+ Cf. section 458 below.



(p228)



 must be answered. Morality says: I need many answers--reasons, arguments; scruples can come afterward, or not at all

"How should one act?” - If one considers that one is dealing with a sovereignly developed type that has "acted" for countless millennia, and in which everything has become instinct, expediency, automatism, fatality, then the urgency of this moral question must actually seem ridiculous.

"How should one act?"- Morality has always been a mis understanding: in reality, a species fated to act in this or that fashion wanted to justify itself, by dictating its norm as the universal norm.

"How should one act?" is not a cause but an effect. Morality follows, the ideal comes at the end,

-On the other hand, the appearance of moral scruples (in other words: the becoming-conscious of the values by which one acts) betrays a certain sickliness; strong ages and peoples do not reflect on their rights, on the principles on which they act, on their instincts and reasons. Becoming-conscious is a sign that real morality, i.e., instinctive certainty in actions, is going to the devil--- Every time a new world of consciousness is created, the moralists are a sign of damage, impoverishment, disorganization. The deeply instinctive are shy of logicizing duties: among them are found Pyrrhonic opponents of dialectics and of knowability in general - A virtue is refuted with a "for"

Thesis: the appearance of moralists belongs to an age in which morality is coming to an end,

Thesis: the moralist disintegrates the moral instincts, however much he may suppose himself to be their restorer,

Thesis: that which really drives the moralist is not the moral instincts but the instincts of decadence translated into the formulas of morality-- (he regards it as corruption when the instincts become uncertain).

Thesis: the instincts of decadence, which, through the mora lists, want to become master over the instinctive morality of strong races and ages, are

1. the instincts of the weak and underprivileged;

2. the instincts of the exceptions, the solitaries, the abandoned, of the abortus125 in what is lofty and what is petty.

3. the instincts of those habituated to suffering, who need

a noble interpretation of their condition and therefore must know as little as possible about physiology.

424 (1885) The tartuffery of scientific manners.120_- One must not affect scientific manners where the time has not yet come to be scientific; but even the genuine investigator has to abandon the vanity of affecting a kind of method for which fundamentally the time has not yet come. Just as he must not "falsify" things and thoughts at which he has arrived in another way by imposing on them a false arrangement of deduction and dialectic. Thus Kant falsified in his "morality" his inner psychological tendency; a more recent example is Herbert Spencer's ethics.

One should not conceal and corrupt the facts of how our thoughts have come to us. The profoundest and least exhausted books will probably always have something of the aphoristic and unexpected character of Pascal's Pensées. The driving forces and evaluations have long lain below the surface; what comes out is effect.

I fight all the tartuffery of false scientific manners:

1. in the demonstration, if it does not correspond to the genesis of thoughts;

2. in the claims to methods that are perhaps not yet possible at a certain stage of science;

3. in the claims to objectivity, to cold impersonality, where, as in the case of all valuations, we describe ourselves and our inner experiences in a couple of words. There are ludicrous forms of vanity, e.g., that of Saint-Beuve, who worried all his life that he had now and then exhibited real warmth and passion either "for" or "against," and would gladly have lied that fact out of his life.

425 (Nov. 1887-March 1888) "Objectivity" in the philosopher: moral indifference toward oneself, blindness toward good or ill consequences: lack of scruples about using dangerous means; perversity and multiplicity of charac ter considered and exploited as an advantage.

My profound indifference toward myself: I desire no advan 124 Wissenschaftlichkeit.

 tage from my insights and do not avoid the disadvantages that accompany them. Here I include what might be called corruption of the character; this perspective is beside the point: I use my character, but try neither to understand nor to change it-the per sonal calculus of virtue has not entered my head for a moment. It seems to me that one shuts the door on knowledge as soon as one becomes interested in one's own case or, worse, the "saly ation of one's soul"!_ One must not take one's morality too seri ously and not let oneself be deprived of a modest right to its opposite

A sort of inherited wealth of morality is perhaps presupposed here: one senses that one can squander a lot of it and throw it out the window without really impoverishing oneself. Never to feel tempted to admire "beautiful souls", always to know oneself their superior. To encounter the monsters of virtue with an inward mockery; déniaiser la vertu127-a secret pleasure.

To revolve about oneself; no desire to become "better" or in any way "other." Too interested not to throw the tentacles or nets of every morality out to things

426 (March-June 1888)

Toward a psychology of the psychologist. Psychologists as they are possible only beginning with the nineteenth century: no longer those loafers who look a mere three or four steps ahead and are almost content to burrow inside themselves. We psychologists of the future--we have little patience with introspection: we almost take it for a sign of degeneration when an instrument tries "to know itself": we are instruments of knowledge and would like to possess all the naiveté and precision of an instrument-con sequently, we must not analyze ourselves, "know" ourselves. First mark of the self-preservative instinct of the great psychologist: he never seeks himself, he has no eyes for himself, no interest or curiosity in himself123. The great egoism of our dominating will requires that we shut our eyes to ourselves—that we must seem to be "impersonal," "désintéressé," "objective"!-oh, how much we are the opposite of this! Just because we are to an eccentric degree psychologists.

(p2). Critique of Greek Philosophy

427 (Nov. 1887-March 1888)

The appearance of the Greek philosophers from Socrates onwards is a symptom of decadence; the anti-Hellenic instincts come to the top

The "Sophist" is still completely Hellenic-including Anaxa goras, Democritus, the great lonians--but as a transitional form. The polis loses its faith in the uniqueness of its culture, in its right to rule over every other polis One exchanges cultures, i.e., "the gods"-one thereby loses faith in the sole prerogative of the deus autochthonus: Good and evil of differing origin are mingled: the boundary between good and evil is blurred. This is the "Sophist"_

The "philosopher," on the other hand, is the reaction: he desires the old virtue. He sees the grounds of decay 20 in the decay of institutions, he desires old institutions;-he sees the decay in the decay of authority: he seeks new authorities (travels abroad, into foreign literatures, into exotic religions ); he desires the ideal polis after the concept "polis" has had its day (approximately as the Jews held firm as a "people" after they had fallen into slavery).. They are interested in all tyrants: they want to restore virtue by force majeure.

Gradually everything genuinely Hellenic is made responsible for the state of decay (and Plato is just as ungrateful to Pericles, Homer, tragedy, rhetoric, as the prophets were to David and Saul). The decline of Greece is understood as an objection to the

128 "Of decay": uncertain reading; M$ illegible.



(p232)



 foundations of Hellenic culture: basic error of philosophers . Conclusion: the Greek world perishes. Cause: Homer, myth, the ancient morality, etc.

The anti-Hellenic development of the philosophers' value judgment:--the Egyptian ("life after death" as a court of law ); the Semitic (the "dignity of the sage," the "sheik");-the Pythago reans, the subterranean cults, silence, terrorization with a beyond, mathematics; the religious valuation, a kind of traffic with the cosmos;-the priestly, ascetic, transcendental;- dialectic--surely a repellent and pedantic concept splitting already in Plato? Decline of good taste in spiritual matters: one is already insensitive to the ugliness and noisiness of all direct dialectics.

Two decadence movements and extremes run side by side: (a) sensual, charmingly wicked: decadence, loving art and show, and (b) gloomy religio-moral pathos, Stoic self-hardening, Platonic slander of the senses, preparation of the soil for Christianity.

428 (March-June 1888)

How far psychologists have been corrupted by the moral idiosyncrasy:--not one of the ancient philosophers had the courage for a theory of the "unfree will" (i.e., for a theory that denies morality);-no one had the courage to define the typical element in pleasure, every sort of pleasure ("happiness") as the feeling of power: for to take pleasure in power was considered immoral; -no one had the courage to conceive virtue as a consequence of immorality (of a will to power) in the service of the species (or of the race or polis), for the will to power was considered immorality.

In the entire evolution of morality, truth never appears: all the conceptual elements employed are fictions; all the psychologica accepted are falsifications; all the forms of logic dragged into this realm of lies are sophistries. What distinguishes moral philosophers themselves is a complete absence of cleanliness and intellectual self-discipline: they take "beautiful feelings" for arguments: they regard their "heaving bosom" as the bellows of divinity- Moral philosophy is the scabrous period in the history of the spirit. 180

The first great example: in the name of morality, under the patronage or morality, an unheard-of wrong was perpetrated, in

(p233)

fact a piece of decadence in every respect. One cannot insist too strongly upon the fact that the great Greek philosophers represent the decadence of every kind of Greek excellence and make it contagious "Virtue" made completely abstract was the greatest seduction to make oneself abstract: i. e., to detach oneself.

It is a very remarkable moment: the Sophists verge upon the first critique of morality; the first insight into morality:-they juxtapose the multiplicity (the geographical relativity) of the moral value judgments:--they let it be known that every morality can be dialetically justified; i.e., they divine that all attempts to give reasons for morality are necessarily sophistical a proposition later proved on the grand scale by the ancient philosophers, from Plato onwards (down to Kant);--they postulate the first truth that a "morality-in-itself," a "good-in-itself" do not exist, that it is a swindle to talk of "truth" in this field.

Where was intellectual integrity in those days?

The Greek culture of the Sophists had developed out of all the Greek instincts; it belongs to the culture of the Periclean age as necessarily as Plato does not: it has its predecessors in Heraclitus, in Democritus, in the scientific types of the old philosophy; it finds expression in, e.g., the high culture of Thucydides. And it has ultimately shown itself to be right: every advance in episte mological and moral knowlege has reinstated the Sophists Our contemporary way of thinking is to a great extent Heraclitean, Démocritean, and Protagorean: it suffices to say it is Protagorean, because Protagoras represented a synthesis of Heraclitus and Democritus.

(Plato: a great Cagliostro-remember how Epicurus judged him;131 how Timon, the friend of Pyrrho, judged him Is Plato's integrity beyond question?-- But we know at least that he wanted to have taught as absolute truth what he himself did not regard as even conditionally true; namely, the separate existence and separate immortality of "souls.")

429 (March-June 1888)

The Sophists are no more than realists: they formulate the values and practices common to everyone on the level of values

The WILL TO POWER

they possess the courage of all strong spirits to know their own immorality

Do you suppose perchance that these little Greek free cities, which from rage and envy would have liked to devour each other, were guided by philanthropic and righteous principles? Does one reproach Thucydides for the words he put into the mouths of the Athenian ambassadors when they negotiated with the Melians on the question of destruction or submission?

Only complete Tartuffes could possibly have talked of virtue in the midst of this terrible tension-or men living apart, hermits, refugees, and emigrants from reality--people who negated in order to be able to live themselves

The Sophists were Greeks: when Socrates and Plato took up the cause of virtue and justice, they were Jews or I know not what- Grote's tactics in defense of the Sophists are false: he wants to raise them to the rank of men of honor and ensigns of morality--but it was their honor not to indulge in any swindle with big words and virtues

430 (March-June 1888)

The great rationality of all education in morality has always been that one tried to attain to the certainty of an instinct: so that neither good intentions nor good means had to enter con sciousness as such. As the soldier exercises, so should man learn to act. In fact, this unconsciousness belongs to any kind of per fection: even the mathematician employs his combinations un consciously

What, then, is the significance of the reaction of Socrates, who recommended dialectics as the road to virtue and made mock when morality did not know how to justify itself logically?- As if this were not part of its value-without unconsciousness it is no good

Positing proofs as the presupposition for personal excellence in virtue signified nothing less than the disintegration of Greek instincts. They are themselves types of disintegration, all these great "virtuous men" and word-spinners.

In prari, this means that moral judgments are torn from their conditionality, in which they have grown and alone possess any meaning, from their Greek and Greek-political ground and soil, to be denaturalized under the pretense of sublimation. The great concepts "good" and "just" are severed from the presup

(p235) positions to which they belong and, as liberated "ideas," become objects of dialectic. One looks for truth in them, one takes them for entities or signs of entities: one invents a world where they are at home, where they originate

In summa: the mischief has already reached its climax in Plato. And then one had need to invent the abstractly perfect man as well:--good, just, wise, a dialectician-in short, the scare crow of the ancient philosopher: a plant removed from all soil; a humanity without any particular regulating instincts; a virtue that "proves" itself with reasons. The perfectly absurd "individuum" in itselfl unnaturalness of the first water

In short, the consequence of the denaturalization of moral values was the creation of a degenerate type of man-"the good man;" "the happy man," "the wise man."- Socrates represents a moment of the profoundest perversity in the history of values.

431 (1885-1886 and 1888)

Socrates.132. This reversal of taste in favor of dialectics is a great question mark. What was it that really happened?-- Socrates, the roturier133 who accomplished it, achieved by means of it victory over a more noble taste, the taste of the nobility: the mob achieved victory with dialectics. Before Socrates, the dialectical manner was repudiated in good society; one believed it compromised one; youth was warned against it. Why this display of reasons? Why should onę demonstrate? Against others one possessed authority. One commanded; that sufficed. Among one's own, inter pares, one possessed tradition, also an authority: and, finally, one "understood one another"! One simply had no place for dialectic. Besides, one mistrusted such public presentation of one's arguments. Honest things do not display their reasons in that way. There is something indecent about showing all one's cards. What can be "demonstrated" is of little worth.

The instinct of all party orators knows, moreover, that dia lectics inspire mistrust, that they are very unconvincing. Nothing is easier to expunge than the effect of a dialectician. Dialectics can

only be an emergency measure. One must experience an emerg ency, one must be obliged to extort one's rights: otherwise one makes no use of dialectics. That is why the Jews were dialecticians, why Reynard the Fox was one, why Socrates was one, One has a merciless weapon in one's hand. One can tyrannize with it. One compromises when one conquers. One leaves it to one's victim to prove that he is not an idiot. One makes others furious and helpless, while one remains the embodiment of cool, trium phant reasonableness oneself-one deprives one's opponent's in telligence of potency:

The irony of the dialectician is a form of mob revenge: the ferocity of the oppressed finds an outlet in the cold knife-thrust of the syllogism

In Plato, as a man of overexcitable sensuality and enthusiasm, the charm of the concept had grown so strong that he involuntarily honored and deified the concept as an ideal Form. Intoxication by dialectic: as the consciousness of exercising mastery over oneself by means of it as a tool of the will to power.

The problem of Socrates. The two antitheses: the tragic disposition, the Socratic disposition-measured according to the law of life.

To what extent the Socratic disposition is a phenomenon of decadence: to what extent, however, a robust health and strength is still exhibited in the whole habitus, in the dialectics, efficiency, and self-discipline of the scientific man the health of the plebeian; his wickedness, esprit frondeur,133 his cunning, his canaille au fond138 are held in check by shrewdness; "ugly").

Making ugly: self-mockery, dialectical dryness, shrewdness as tyrant in opposition to a "tyrant" (instinct). Everything is exaggerated, eccentric, caricature, in Socrates, a buffo with the instincts of Voltaire. He discover a new form of agon;137 he is the first fencing master to the leading circles of Athens; he represents

BOOK TWO: Critique of Highest Values nothing but the highest form of shrewdness: he calls it "virtue" (-he divined it to be deliverance: he was not shrewd from choice, it was de rigueur138); to have oneself under control, so as to go into battle with reasons and not with affects the cunning of Spinoza-the unravelling of the errors caused by affects) ;-to discover that one can capture anyone in whom one produces affects, to discover that affects proceed illogically; practice in self-mockery, so as to damage the feeling of rancor at its roots.

I try to understand from what partial and idiosyncratic states the Socratic problem derives: his equalization of reason = virtue = happiness. It was with this absurdity of a doctrine of identity that he fascinated: the philosophers of antiquity never again freed them selves from this fascination

Absolute lack of objective interest: hatred for science; the idiosyncrasy of feeling oneself as a problem. Socrates' acoustic hallucination: morbid element: When the spirit is rich and inde pendent it most resists any preoccupation with morality. How came it that Socrates was a monomaniac in regard to morality? In emergencies, “practical" philosophy steps at once to the fore. Morality and religion as chief interests are signs of an emergency.

433139 (March-June 1888) Shrewdness, clarity, severity and logicality as weapons against the ferocity of the drives. These must be dangerous and threaten destruction: otherwise there would be no sense in develop ing shrewdness to the point of making it into a tyrant. To make a tyrant of shrewdness:--but for that the drives must be tyrants. This is the problem. In those days it was a very timely problem. Reason became = virtue = happiness.

Solution: The Greek philosophers rest on the same funda mental facts of inner experience as Socrates: five steps from ex cess, from anarchy, from intemperance-all men of decadence. They need him as a physician; logic as will to power, to self mastery, to "happiness." The ferocity and anarchy of the instincts in the case of Socrates is a symptom of decadence. The super fetation of logic and of clarity of reason included. Both are abnor malities, both belong together.

Critique. Decadence betrays itself in this preoccupation with

128 Unavoidable. 190 See footnote to the preceding section.



(p238)



 "happiness" (i.e., with "salvation of the soul," i.e., to feel one's condition as a danger). The fanaticism of its interest in "happi ness" indicates the pathological nature of the hidden cause: it was a life-or-death interest. To be reasonable or perish was the alternative before which they all stood. The moralism of the Greek philosophers indicates that they felt themselves to be in danger

434 (March-June 1888) Why everything resolved itself into play-acting.- The rudi mentary psychology that considered only the conscious motives of men (as causes), that took "consciousness" for an attribute of the soul, that sought a will (i.e., an intention) behind all action: it needed, first, only to answer "Happiness" to the question: What do men want? (one dared not say "Power": that would have been immoral);- consequently there is in all the actions of men the intention of attaining happiness. Secondly: if man does in fact not achieve happiness, why is it? Because he blunders in respect of the means.. What is unfailingly the means to happiness? Answer: virtue.- Why virtue?-- Because it is supremely rational and because rationality makes it impossible to err in the choice of means: it is as reason that virtue is the way to happiness. Dialectic is the constant occupation of virtue, because it excludes all clouding of the intellect and all affects.

In fact, man does not want "happiness." Pleasure is a feeling of power; if one excludes the affects, then one excludes the states that give the highest feeling of power, consequently of pleasure. The highest rationality is a cold, clear state very far from giving that feeling of happiness that intoxication of any kind brings with

The philosophers of antiquity combat everything that intoxi cates—that impairs the absolute coldness and neutrality of the consciousness- They were consistent with their false presupposi tion; that consciousness is the exalted, the supreme state, the precondition of perfection-whereas the opposite is true

To the extent that it is willed, to the extent that it is conscious, there is no perfection in action of any kind. The philosophers of antiquity were the greatest duffers in practice because they con demned themselves to be duffers in theory— In praxi, everything resolved itself into play-acting; and whoever saw through this,

(p239)

e.g., Pyrrho, judged as everyone did, namely that in goodness and integrity "little people” were far superior to philosophers.

All the more profound natures of antiquity were disgusted with the philosophers of virtue: they were looked upon as quarrel some and play actors. (Judgment on Plato: that of Epicurus, 140 that of Pyrrho).

Result: little people are superior to them in their way of living, in patience, in goodness and mutual assistance: approxi mately the claim made by Dostoevsky or Tolstoy for his muzhiks: they are more philosophical in practice, they meet the exigencies of life more courageously

435 (March-June 1888)

Toward a critique of the philosopher. It is a self-deception of philosophers and moralists to imagine that they escape decadence by opposing it. That is beyond their will; and, however little they acknowledge it, one later discovers that they were among the most powerful promoters of decadence.

[Let us take 141 the philosophers of Greece, e.g., Plato. He severed the instincts from the polis, from contest, from military efficiency, from art and beauty, from the mysteries, from belief in tradition and ancestors- He was the seducer of the nobility: he was himself seduced by the roturier Socrates---He negated all the presuppositions of the “noble Greek" of the old stamp, made dialectic an everyday practice, conspired with tyrants, pursued politics of the future and provided the example of the most com pleto severance of the instincts from the past. He is profound, passionate in everything anti-Hellenic

These great philosophers represent one after the other the typical forms of decadence: the moral-religious idiosyncrasy, an archism, nihilism (adiaphora),142 cynicism, obduracy, hedonism, reaction.

(p240)



 The question of "happiness," of "virtue," of "salvation of the soul" is the expression of physiological contradictoriness in these types of decline: their instincts lack a center of gravity, a purpose.

436 (1885-1886)

To what extent dialectic and faith in reason still rest on moral prejudices. With Plato we are, as former inhabitants of an intel ligible world of the good, still in possession of a heritage from that time: divine dialectic, as proceeding from the good, leads to all things good therefore, as it were, "backwards"--). Even Des cartes had a notion of the fact that in a fundamentally Christian moral mode of thought, which believes in a good God as the creator of things, only God's veracity guarantees to us the judgments of our senses. Apart from a religious sanction and guarantee of our senses and rationality where should we derive a right to trust in existence! That thinking is a measure of actuality--that what can not be thought, is not-is a rude non plus ultra of a moralistic trustfulness (in an essential truth-principle at the bottom of things), in itself a mad assumption, which experience contradicts every moment. We are altogether unable to think anything at all just as it is

437 (March-June 1888)

The real philosophers of Greece are those before Socrates 143 (--with Socrates something changes). They are all noble persons, setting themselves apart from people and state, 144 traveled, serious to the point of somberness, with a slow glance, no strangers to state affairs and diplomacy. They anticipate all the great concep tions of things: they themselves represent these conceptions, they bring themselves into a system. Nothing gives a higher idea of the Greek spirit than this sudden fruitfulness in types, than this in voluntary completeness in the erection of the great possibilities of the philosophical ideal.- I seen only one original figure in those

14: This view was taken up by Karl Jaspers in his Psychologie der Weltan schauungen (1919) and by Martin Heidegger in Platons Lehre von der Walırheit ("Plato's Doctrine of Truth," 1942).

1* Word not clear in the MS: possibly "custom" (Sitte) rather than "state" (Staat),

(p241) that came after: a late arrival but necessarily the last--the nihilist Pyrrho:-his instinct was opposed to all that had come to the top in the meantime: the Socratics, Plato, the artist's optimism145 of Heraclitus. (Pyrrho goes back, through Protagoras, to Democ ritus-).

Sagacious weariness: Pyrrho. To live a lowly life among the lowly. No pride. To live in the common way; to honor and believe what all believe. On guard against science and spirit, also against all that inflates

Simple: indescribably patient, carefree, mild. Apatheia, 148 or rather praótes,147 A Buddhist for Greece, grown up amid the tumult of the schools, a latecomer; weary; the protest of weariness against the zeal of the dialecticians; the unbelief of weariness in the importance of all things. He had seen Alexander, he had seen the Indian penitents. To such refined latecomers, everything lowly, everything poor, even everything idiotic is seductive. It has a narcotic effect: it relaxes (Pascal). On the other hand, in the midst of the crowd and confounded with everyone else, they feel a little warmth: these weary people need warmth

To overcome contradiction; no contest; no will to distinction; to deny the Greek instincts. (Pyrrho lived with his sister who was a midwife.) To disguise wisdom so that it no longer distinguishes; to cloak it in poverty and rags; to perform the lowliest offices: to go to market and sell suckling pigs

Sweetness; light; indifference; no virtues that require gestures: to be everyone's equal even in virtue: ultimate self-overcoming, ultimate indifference.

Pyrrho, like Epicurus, two forms of Greek decadence: related, in hatred for dialectics and for all theatrical virtues—these two together were in those days called philosophy—; deliberately hold ing in low esteem that which they loved; choosing common, even despised names for it; representing a state in which one is neither sick nor well, neither alive nor dead

Epicurus more naive, idyllic, grateful; Pyrrho more traveled, experienced, nihilistic-- His life was a protest against the great doctrine of identity (happiness = virtue = knowledge). One can

(p242)





not promote the right way of life through science: wisdom does not make "wise"- The right way of life does not want happiness, turns away from happiness

438 (Spring 1888)

The struggle against the "old faith" as undertaken by Epicurus was, in a strict sense, a struggle against pre-existing Christianity a struggle against the old world grown senile and sick, already gloomy, 'moralized, soured by feelings of guilt.

Not the "moral corruption" of antiquity, but precisely its moralization is the prerequisite through which alone Christianity could become master of it. Moral fanaticism (in short: Plato) destroyed paganism, by revaluing its values and poisoning its innocence. .

We ought finally to understand that what was then destroyed was higher than what became master!

Christianity has grown out of psychological decay, could only take root in decayed soil.

439 (March-June 1888)

Scientific manners: as training or as instinct. In the Greek philosophers I see a decline of the instincts: otherwise they could not have blundered so far as to posit the conscious state as more valuable. Intensity of consciousness stands in inverse ratio to ease and speed of cerebral transmission. Among Greek philoso phers the reverse opinion about instinct prevailed: which is always a sign of weakened instincts.

We must in fact seek perfect life where it has become least conscious (i.e., least aware of its logic, its reasons, its means and intentions, its utility). The return to the facts of bon sens, of the bon homme, of the "little people" of all kinds. The stored-up in tegrity and shrewdness of generations which are never conscious of their principles and are even a little afraid of principles. The demand for a virtue that reasons is not reasonable A philo sopher is compromised by such a demand.

440 (Jan.-Fall 1888)

When morality

that is to say subtlety, caution, bravery,

243

.

BOOK TWO: Critique of Highest Values equity-has been as it were stored up through the practice of a whole succession of generations, then the total force of this ac cumulated virtue radiates even into that sphere where integrity is most seldom found, into the spiritual sphere. In all becoming conscious there is expressed a discomfiture of the organism; it has to try something new, nothing is sufficiently adapted for it, there is toil, tension, strain-all this constitutes becoming-conscious--

Genius resides in instinct; goodness likewise. One acts perfectly only when one acts instinctively. Even from the viewpoint of morality, all conscious thinking is merely tentative, usually the reverse of morality. Scientific integrity is always ruptured when the thinker begins to reason: try the experiment of putting the wisest men on the most delicate scales by making them talk about morality—

It could be proved that all conscious thinking would also show a far lower standard of morality than the thinking of the same man when it is directed by his instincts.148

144 According to 1911, p. 505, "This aph. (sic, In fact these are not "aphorisms" but mere notes) replaces aph. 243 of the old vol. XV (the first edition of The Will to Power, published in 1901), which represents another formulation of the same content." Here is the other version:

"When enough subtlety, bravery, caution, and moderation have been collected through the practice of a long chain of generations, then the instinc tive power of such incorporated virtue radiates even into the most spiritual matters and that phenomenon becomes visible which we call intellectual integrity. This is very rare: among philosophers it is lacking:

"One can take the scientific manner or, morally speaking the intellectual integrity of a thinker, the subtlety, bravery, caution, and moderation that have become instinct in him and transposed even into the most spiritual matters, and place them on the most delicate scales--by letting him talk about morality: then the most famous philosophers show that their scientific manner is as yet only a conscious affair, a beginning, a 'good will,' some thing laborious—and as soon as their instincts begin to speak, as soon as they moralize, it is all over with the discipline and subtlety of their con science.

"The scientific manner whether mere training and external or the final result of long discipline and moral practice: in the former case it abdicates as soon as the instincts speak (e.g., the religious instincts or those of the concept of duty); in the latter case it replaces these instincts and no longer grants them admission, feeling they represent uncleanliness and seductions"

Although omitted in most editions, this version is printed in an appen dix in both the Grossoktay edition and the Musarion edition, as #1074. Schlechta omits it. It is included here not only as a matter of principle but also for three additional reasons; (1) it is interesting to see how the editors of the various editions proceeded; (2) it is even more interesting to be able to compare two, alternative drafts from Nietzsche's hand; and (3) parts of this draft compare very favorably with the one included in the text.



(p244)





441 (March-June 1888)

The struggle against Socrates, Plato, all the Socratic schools, proceeds from the profound instinct that one does not make men better when one represents to them that virtue is demonstrable and asks for reasons

Ultimately, it is the measly fact that the agonal instinct in all these born dialecticians compelled them to glorify their personal ability as the highest quality and to represent all other good things as conditioned by it. The anti-scientific spirit of this entire "phi losophy": it is determined to be in the right.

442 (March-June 1888)

This is extraordinary. We find from the beginning of Greek philosophy onwards a struggle against science with the means of an epistemology or skepticism: and with what object? Always for the good of morality

(Hatred for physicists and physicians.) Socrates, Aristippus, the Megarian school, the Cynics, Epicurus, Pyrrhoa general assault on knowledge for the good of morality

(Hatred for dialectics also.) A problem remains: they ap proach the Sophists in order to get rid of science. On the other hand, the physicists are all so completely subjected as to take up the schema of truth, 149 of real being, into the fundamentals of their science; e.g., the atom, the four elements (juxtaposition of beings to explain multiplicity and change-). Contempt for ob jective interest is taught: return to the practical interest, the personal utility of all knowledge

The struggle against science is directed against (1) its pathos (objectivity), (2) its means (i.e., against its utility), (3) its re sults (as childish).

It is the same struggle that is later conducted by the church in the name of piety: the church inherited the entire arsenal of antiquity for its struggle, Epistemology played in this the same role as it did in the case of Kant, in the case of the Indians-One does not want to be troubled by it: one wants one's hands free for one's "course."

What were they really defending themselves against? Against

199 "Truth" is an uncertain reading of an illegible word.

(p245) obligation, against legality, against the compulsion to go hand in hand- I believe one calls this freedom

Decadence manifests itself in this: the instinct of solidarity is so degenerate that solidarity is felt as tyranny: they want no authority, no solidarity, no lining up with the rank and file to adopt its ignobly stack pace. They hate the measured step, the tempo of science, they hate the lack of urgency, the perserverance, the indifference to himself of the man of science,

443 (March-June 1888)

Fundamentally, morality is hostile to science: Socrates was so already--and for this reason, that science takes things seriously that have nothing to do with "good" and "evil," consequently makes the feeling for "good" and "evil” seem less important. For morality demands that the whole man and all his forces should stand in its service: it considers it a squandering on the part of one not rich enough to squander when man concerns himself seriously with plants and stars. This is why scientific procedures rapidly declined in Greece once Socrates had introduced into science the disease of moralizing; the height attained in the dis position of a Democritus, Hippocrates, and Thucydides was not attained a second time.

444 (March-June 1888)

Problem of the philosopher and the man of science.--In fluence of age; depressive habits (staying-at-home à la Kant; overwork; insufficient nourishment of the brain; reading). More essentially: whether a tendency toward generalities is not already a symptom of decadence; objectivity as disintegration of the will ( to be able to stand so distant-) This presupposes a great adiaphora in regard to the powerful drives: a kind of isolation, exceptional stance, resistance in regard to the normal drives.

Type: desertion of the homeland; further and further afield; increasing exoticism; the old imperatives become dumb cer tainly this continual questioning "whither?" ("happiness") is a sign of disengagement from forms of organization, of a breaking loose.

Problem: whether the man of science is more of a symptom of decadence than the philosophers:-he is not disengaged as a

(p246)





whole, only a part of him is absolutely dedicated to knowledge, trained to one corner and perspective--he needs all the virtues of a strong race and health, great severity, manliness, shrewdness. He is a symptom more of a higher multiplicity of culture than of its weariness. The scholar of decadence is a bad scholar. While the philosopher of decadence has counted, hitherto at least, as the typical philosopher.

445 (Jan.-Fall 1888)

Nothing is rarer among philosophers than intellectual integrity: perhaps they say the opposite, perhaps they even believe it. But a condition of their entire occupation is that only certain truths are admitted; they know that which they have to prove; that they are at one over these "truths" is virtually their means of recognizing one another as philosophers. There are, e.g., moral truths. But a faith in morals is not a proof of morality: there are cases---and the case of the philosopher is one-in which such a faith is simply a piece of immorality.

446 (March-June 1888)

What, then, is regressive in the philosopher?- That he teaches that his qualities are the necessary and sole qualities for the attain ment of the "highest good" (e.g., dialectic, as with Plato). That he orders men of all kinds gradatim 150 up to his type as the highest. That he despises what is generally esteemed that he opens up á gulf between priestly values and worldly values. Thät he knows what is true, what God is, what the goal is, what the way is

The typical philosopher is here an absolute dogmatist;—if he has need of skepticism, it is so as to be able to speak dog matically about his main interest.

447 (March-June 1888)

The philosopher in opposition to his rivals; e.g., in opposi tion to science: then he becomes a skeptic; then he reserves to himself a form of knowledge that he denies the man of science; then he goes hand in hand with the priest so as not151 to arouse

160 By degrees.

151 "Not" is missing in the MS but was very reasonably inserted by the German editors.

(p247)

the suspicion of atheism, materialism; he regards an attack on himself as an attack on morality, virtue, religion, order-he knows how to discredit his opponents as "seducers" and "underminers": then he goes hand in hand with power.

The philosopher in a struggle with other philosophers-he tries to compel them to appear as anarchists, unbelievers, opponents of authority. In summa: in so far as he struggles, he struggles just as a priest does, just as priesthood does.

3. Truth and Error of Philosophers

448 (Manuscript source uncertain) 162 Philosophy defined by Kant as "the science of the limitations of reason!!!

449 (Spring-Fall 1887)

Philosophy as the art of discovering truth: according to Aristotle. Contradicted by the Epicureans, who made use of Aristotle's sensualistic theory of knowledge: they rejected the search for truth with irony: "Philosophy as an art of living."

450 (Spring-Fall 1887)

The three great naiveties: Knowledge as a means to happiness (as if--), as a means to virtue (as if ),

as a means to "denial of life"--to the extent that it is a means to disappointment-(as if-)

451 (Manuscript source uncertain) 168

That there should be a "truth" which one could somehow approach-!

452 (Jan.-Fall 1888)

Error and ignorance are fateful.

The view that truth is

(p248)





found and that ignorance and error are at an end is one of the most potent seductions there is. Supposing it is believed, then the will to examination, investigation, caution, experiment is paralyzed;

it can even count as criminal, namely as doubt concerning truth

“Truth” is therefore more fateful than error and ignorance, because it cuts off the forces that work toward enlightenment and knowledge.

The affect of laziness now takes the side of "truth" -- ("think ing is distress, misery!"); as do order, rule, happiness in possess ing, pride in wisdom--vanity in summa:-it is more comfortable to obey than to examine; it is more flattering to think "I possess the truth" than to see only darkness around one-above all: it is reassuring, it gives confidence, it alleviates life---it "improves" the character, to the extent that it lessens mistrust. "Peace of soul," "a quiet conscience": all inventions made possible only by pre supposing that truth has been found.- "By their fruits shall ye know them" "Truth" is truth, for it makes men better. The process goes on: everything good, all success, is placed to the credit of "truth."

This is the proof of strength:154 the happiness, the content ment, the well-being of the community, as of the individual, are henceforth understood as the consequence of belief in morality

The converse: ill success is attributed to lack of faith

453 (Jan.-Fall 1888)

The causes of error lie just as much in the good will as in the ill will156] of man-i in a thousand cases he conceals reality from himself, he falsifies it, so as not to suffer from his good for ill] 166 will. E.g., God as the director of human destiny: or the interpretation of his own petty destiny as if everything were con trived and sent with a view to the salvation of his soul—this lack of "philology," which to a more subtle intellect would have to count as uncleanliness and counterfeiting, is, on the average, per formed under the inspiration of good will. Good will, "noble feelings," "lofty states" are in the means they employ just as much

154 See Antichrist, sections 50 f (Portable Nietzsche); also in connection with sections 453-57.

*** Interpolated by Nietzsche, brackets mine. ** Interpolated by German editors, brackets mine.

(p249)

counterfeiters and deceivers as the affects repudiated by morality and called egoistic: love, hate, revenge.

Errors are what mankind has had to pay for most dearly: and, on the whole, it is the errors of "good will" which have harmed it most profoundly. The illusion that makes happy is more per nicious than that which has immediate bad consequences: the latter sharpens and purifies157 reason and makes it more mistrustful --the former lulls it to sleep..

Beautiful feelings, sublime agitations, are, physiologically speaking, among the narcotics: their misuse has precisely the same consequences as the misuse of any other opiate-neuras thenia

454 (1888)

Error is the most expensive luxury that man can permit him self; and if the error happens to be a physiological error, then it is perilous to life. What, consequently, has man hitherto paid for most dearly? For his "truths”: for they have all been errors in physiologicis

455 (Jan.-Fall 1888) Psychological confusions: the demand for belief-confused with the "will to truth" (e.g., in the case of Carlyle).158 But in the same way, the demand for unbelief has been confused with the "will to truth" ( the need to get free from a belief, for a hundred reasons: to be in the right against some "believers"). What inspires the skeptic? Hatred of the dogmatist-of a need for rest, a weariness, as in the case of Pyrrho,

The advantages that one anticipated from truth were ad vantages resulting from belief in it:-in itself, that is, truth could be altogether painful, harmful, fateful One likewise disputed the "truth" only when one promised oneself advantages from one's victory-.g., freedom from the ruling powers.

The methods of truth were not invented from motives of truth, but from motives of power, of wanting to be superior.

How is truth proved? By the feeling of enhanced power159— 107 Reading uncertain, word illegible. 168 Cf. Twilight, "Skirmishes," section 12 (Portable Nietzsche, p. 521).

14 After "power" three illegible words follow in the MS: "of certainty, faith--"?



(p250)



 by utility-by indispensability--in short, by advantages (namely, presuppositions concerning what truth ought to be like for us to recognize it). But that is a prejudice: a sign that truth is not involved at all

What, e.g., is the meaning of the "will to truth" in the case of the Goncourts?160 in the case of the naturalists? - Critique of "objectivity."

Why know: why not rather be deceived? What one always wanted was faith and not truth Faith is created by means antithetical to the methods of research- they even exclude the latter-,

456 (March-June 1888)

457 (Jan-Fall 1888)

Martyrs.- In order to combat anything founded on rever ence, the attacker must be possessed of a somewhat audacious, relentless, even shameless disposition--- Now if one considers that mankind has for millennia sanctified as truths only what was error, that is has even branded any critique of these as a sign of a wicked disposition, then one is bound to confess with regret that a goodly amount of immorality was needed to provide the initiative for aggression, in other words for reason

These immoralists should be forgiven for always having posed as "martyrs to truth": the truth is that it was not the drive to truth which made them negate, but disintegration, sacrilegious skepticism, pleasure in adventure. In other cases, it is personal rancor that drives them into the domain of problems--they combat problems in order to be in the right against particular people. But it is revenge above all that science has been able to employ— the revenge of the oppressed, those who had been pushed aside and, in fact, oppressed by the prevailing truth

Truth, that is to say, the scientific method, was grasped and promoted by those who divined in it a weapon of war—an in

BOOK TWo: Critique of Highest Values strument of destruction- To make their opposition honorable, they needed, moreover, an apparatus similar in kind to that used by those they were attacking:—they adopted the concept "truth" just as ostentatiously and unconditionally as their opponents they became fanatics, at least they posed as such, because no other pose was taken seriously. What remained to be done was accomplished by persecution, passion and the insecurity of the persecuted.

mhatred grew and consequently the precondition for remaining scientific was diminished. Ultimately, they all wanted to be right in the same absurd fashion as their opponents — The words "conviction," "faith," the pride of martyrdom--these are the least favorable states for the advancement of knowledge. The opponents of truth at last reaccepted the entire subjective manner of deciding questions of truth, namely by poses, sacrifices, heroic resolutions and thus prolonged the dominion of antiscientific methods. As martyrs they compromised their own deed.

458 (March-June 1888) 101

Dangerous distinction between "theoretical" and "practical," e.g., in the case of Kant, but also in the case of the ancients: they act as if pure spirituality presented them with the problems of knowledge and metaphysics; they act as if practice must be judged by its own measure, whatever the answer of theory may be.

Against the former I direct my psychology of philosophers: their most alienated calculations and their "spirituality" are still only the last pallid impression of a physiological fact; the voluntary is absolutely lacking, everything is instinct, everything has been directed along certain lines from the beginning

Against the latter I ask whether we know of any other method of acting well than always thinking well; the latter is an action, and the former presupposes thought. Have we a different method for judging the value of a way of life from judging the value of a theory: by induction, by comparison?

The naive believe that we are better equipped here, that here we know what is "good"-philosophers repeat it. We con clude that a faith is here at work, nothing more

"One must act; consequently rules of conduct are needed" said even the skeptics of antiquity. The urgent need for a decision as an argument for considering something true!

"One must not act"-said their more consistent brothers, the Buddhists, and conceived a rule of conduct to liberate one from actions

To accommodate oneself, to live as the "common man" lives, to hold right and good what he holds right: this is to submit to the herd instinct. One must take one's courage and severity so far as to feel such a submission as a disgrace. Not to live with two different standards.- Not to separate theory and practice!

459 (Jan.-Fall 1888) That nothing formerly held true is true What was formerly despised as unholy, forbidden, contemptible, fateful-all these flowers grow today along the lovely paths of truth.

This entire old morality concerns us no more: there is not a concept in it that still deserves respect. We have outlived it. we are no longer coarse and naive enough to have to let ourselves be deceived in this fashion- In more polite words: we are too virtuous for it. And if truth in the old sense was "truth" only because the old morality affirmed it, had a right to affirm it, then it follows that we no longer have need of any former truths, either Our criterion of truth is by no means morality: we refute an opinion by showing it to be dependent on morality, to be in spired by noble feelings.

All these values are empirical and conditional. But he who believes in them, who reverences them, refuses to recognize just this characteristic of them. Philosophers believe one and all in these values, and one form their reverence took was the attempt to inake a priori truths of them. The falsifying character of rever ence

Reverence is the supreme test of integrity: but in the entire history of philosophy there is no intellectual integrity--but only "love of the good"

The absolute lack of methods of testing the value of these values; secondly: reluctance to test values, to take them as being in any way conditional. In the case of moral values, all the antiscientific instincts came together with the object of excluding science

4. Further Considerations for a

Critique of Philosophy

461 (March-June 1888)

Why philosophers are slanderers. The treacherous and blind hostility of philosophers towards the senses162 how much of mob and middle class there is in this hatred!

The common people always consider an abuse of which they feel the ill consequences as an objection to that which is abused: all insurrectionary movements aimed against principles, whether political or economic, argue thus, with the idea of representing an abuse as being necessary to, and inherent in, the principle.

It is a miserable story: man seeks a principle through which he can despise men—he invents a world so as to be able to slander and bespatter this world: in reality, he reaches every time for nothingness and construes nothingness as "God," as "truth," and in any case as judge and condemner of this state of being.“

If one wants a proof of how profoundly and thoroughly the actually barbarous needs of man seek satisfaction, even when he is tamed and "civilized," one should take a look at the "leitmotifs" of the entire evolution of philosophy: a sort of revenge on reality, a malicious destruction of the valuations by which men live, an unsatisfied soul that feels the tamed state as a torture and finds a voluptuous pleasure in a morbid unraveling of all the bonds that tie it to such a state.

The history of philosophy is a secret raging against the pre conditions of life, against the value feelings of life, against partisan ship in favor of life. Philosophers have never hesitated to affirm a world provided it contradicted this world and furnished them with a pretext for speaking ill of this world. It has been hitherto the grand school of slander; and it has imposed itself to such an extent that today our science, which proclaims itself the advocate

143 At this point the German editors saw fit to omit the following lines:

"It is not the senses that deceive. Our nose, of which, as far as I know, no philosopher has ever spoken with due respect, is as yet the most delicate scientific (physikalisch) instrument in existence: it is capable of registering vibrations where even the spectroscope fails."

This section, including the passage just cited, was utilized by Nietzsche in Twilight, Chapters III and IV.

 of life, has accepted the basic slanderous position and treated this world as apparent, this chain of causes as merely phenomenal. What is it really that hates here?

I fear it is still the Circe of philosophers, morality, that has here bewitched them into having to be slanderers forever-- They believed in moral "truths," they found there the supreme values what else could they do but deny existence more firmly the more they got to know it?--. For this existence is immoral— And this life depends upon immoral preconditions: and all morality denies life

Let us abolish the real world: and to be able to do this we first have to abolish the supreme value hitherto, morality. It suffices to demonstrate that even morality is immoral, in the sense in which immorality has always been condemned. If the tyranny of former values is broken in this way, if we have abolished the "real world," then a new order of values must follow of its own accord.

The apparent world and the world invented by a lie—this is the antithesis. The latter has hitherto been called the "real world," "truth," "God." This is what we have to abolish.

Logic of my conception:

1. Morality as supreme value (master over all phases of philosophy, even over the skeptics). Result: this world is good for nothing, it is not the "real world."

2. What here determines the supreme value? What is morality, really?— The instinct of decadence; it is the exhausted and dis inherited who take revenge in this fashion. Historical proof: phi losophers are always decadents in the service of the nihilistic religioas.

3. The instinct of decadence which appears as will to power. Proof: the absolute immorality of means throughout the entire history of morality.

General insight: the highest values hitherto are a special case of the will to power; morality itself is a special case of im morality.103

10 The short last paragraph was taken by the editors from another more detailed section. At this point the MS had merely: "In this whole movement we have recognized merely a special case of the will to power." The first edition (1901) followed the MS.

Schlechta omits the lines deleted in all other editions; he follows the standard edition and not the manuscript in the final paragraph; and he

Fundamental innovations: In place of "moral values," purely naturalistic values. Naturalization of morality.

In place of "sociology," a theory of the forms of domination,

In place of "society," the culture complex, as my chief interest (as a whole or in its parts).

In place of "epistemology," a perspective theory of affects (to which belongs a hierarchy of the affects; the affects trans figured; their superior order, their "spirituality").

In place of "metaphysics" and religion, the theory of eternal recurrence (this as a means of breeding and selection).

464 (1885) I have named those who were unknowingly my workers and precursors. But where may I look with any kind of hope for my kind of philosopher himself, at the least for my need of new phi losophers 2165 In that direction alone where a noble mode of thought is dominant, such as believes in slavery and in many degrecs of bondage as the precondition of every higher culture; where a

prints the second half of the section, beginning with "The history of phi losophy..." (along with the conclusion that does not belong to it) a couple of pages before the first half.

104 The MS goes on: "In The Birth of Tragedy I gave hints concerning the relation of distress' and 'art'; personal education of the philosopher in solitude. The Dionysian."

Schlechta not only omits these lines, following the example of all previ ous editors; he also omits the second paragraph-in which, incidentally, the MS has "Napol." instead of Napoleonic."

creative mode of thought dominates that does not posit the happi ness of repose, the "Sabbath of Sabbaths" as a goal for the world, and honors even in peace the means to new wars;100 a mode of thought that prescribes laws for the future, that for the sake of the future is harsh and tyrannical towards itself and all things of the present; a reckless, "immoral" mode of thought, which wants to develop both the good and the bad qualities in man to their fullest extent, because it feels it has the strength to put both in their right place in the place where each needs the other. But he who thus looks for philosophers today, what prospect has he of finding what he is looking for? Is it not likely that, even with the best Diogenes lantern, he will search about in vain all day and all night? The age possesses the reverse instincts; it wants, first and above all, comfort; it wants, in the second place, publicity and that great actors' hubbub, that great drum banging that appeals to its fun fair tastes; it wants, thirdly, that everyone should fall on his face in the profoundest subjection before the greatest of all lies-it is called "equality of men"--and honor exclusively those virtues that level and equalize. But the rise of the philosopher, as I under stand him, is therewith rendered altogether impossible, notwith standing that it is thought in all innocence to be favorable to him. Indeed, all the world bewails today the evil situation of the phi losopher in earlier times, hemmed in between the stake, bad conscience, and the arrogant wisdom of the Church Fathers: the truth, however, is that precisely this was a much more favorable condition for the education of a powerful, comprehensive, cuoning and audaciously daring spirituality than the conditions of life at present. Today, another kind of spirit, namely the spirit of the demagogue, the spirit of the actor, perhaps also the scholarly beaver- and ant-like spirit, finds conditions favorable. But things are so much the worse even for superior artists: for are they not, almost all of them, perishing from a lack of inner discipline? They are no longer tyrannized over from without by a church's tables of absolute values or those of a court; thus they also no longer learn to develop their "inner tyrants," their will. And what is true of artists is true in a higher and more fateful sense of

465 (Summer-Fall 1888)

I understand by "freedom of spirit" something quite definite: being a hundred times superior167 to philosophers and other disciples of "truth" in severity towards oneself, in cleanliness and courage, in the unconditional will to say No where it is dangerous to say No.I treat previous philosophers as contemptible libertines hiding in the cloak of the woman "truth."
