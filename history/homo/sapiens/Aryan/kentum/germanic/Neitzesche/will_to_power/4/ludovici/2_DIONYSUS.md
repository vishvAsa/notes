To *him who is one of Nature's lucky strokes,* to, him unto whom my heart goes out, to him who is carved from one integral block, which is hard, sweet, and fragrant—to him from whom even my nose can derive some pleasure—let this book be dedicated.

He enjoys that which is beneficial to him.

His pleasure in anything ceases when the limits of what is beneficial to him are overstepped.

He divines the remedies for partial injuries; his illnesses are the great stimulants of his existence.

He understands how to exploit his serious accidents.

He grows stronger under the misfortunes which threaten to annihilate him.

He instinctively gathers from all he sees, hears, and experiences, the materials for what concerns him most,—he pursues a selective principle,—he rejects a good deal.

He reacts with that tardiness which long caution and deliberate *pride* have bred in him,—he tests the stimulus: whence does it come? whither does it lead? He does not submit.

He is always in his own company, whether his intercourse be with books, with men, or with Nature.

He honours anything by choosing it, by conceding to it, by trusting it.



1004.

We should attain to such a height, to such a lofty eagle's ledge, in our observation, as to be able to understand that everything happens, *just as it ought to happen*: and that all "imperfection," and the pain it brings, belong to all that which is most eminently desirable.



1005.

Towards 1876 I experienced a fright; for I saw that everything I had most wished for up to that time was being compromised. I realised this when I perceived what Wagner was actually driving at: and I was bound very fast to him—by all the bonds of a profound similarity of needs, by gratitude, by the thought that he could not be replaced, and by the absolute void which I saw facing me.

Just about this time I believed myself to be inextricably entangled in my philology and my professorship—in the accident and last shift of my life: I did not know how to get out of it, and was tired, used up, and on my last legs.



At about the same time I realised that what my instincts most desired to attain was precisely the reverse of what Schopenhauer's instincts wanted—that is to say, a *justification of life,* even where it was most terrible, most equivocal, and most false: to this end, I had the formula "*Dionysian*" in my hand.

Schopenhauer's interpretation of the "absolute" as *will* was certainly a step towards that concept of the "absolute" which supposed it to be necessarily good, blessed, true, and integral, but Schopenhauer did not understand how to deify this will: he remained suspended in the moral-Christian ideal. Indeed, he was still so very much under the dominion of Christian values, that, once he could no longer regard the absolute as God, he had to conceive it as evil, foolish, utterly reprehensible. He did not realise that there is an infinite number of ways of being different, and even of being God.



1006.

Hitherto, moral values have been the highest values: does anybody doubt this? If we bring down the values from their pedestal, we thereby alter *all* values; the principle of their *order of rank* which has prevailed hitherto is thus overthrown.



1007.

Transvalue values—what does this mean? It implies that all spontaneous motives, all new, future, and stronger motives, are still extant; but that they now appear under false names and false valuations, and have not yet become conscious of themselves.

We ought to have the courage to become, conscious, and to affirm all that which has been *attained*—to get rid of the humdrum character of old valuations, which makes us unworthy of the best and strongest things that we have achieved.



1008.

Any doctrine would be superfluous for which everything is not already prepared in the way of accumulated forces and explosive material. A transvaluation of values can only be accomplished when there is a tension of new needs, and a new set of needy people who feel all old values as painful,—although they are not conscious of what is wrong.



1009.

The standpoint from which my values are determined: is abundance or desire active? ... Is one a mere spectator, or is one's own shoulder at the wheel—is one looking away or is one turning aside? ... Is one acting spontaneously, as the result of accumulated strength, or is one merely reacting to a goad or to a stimulus? ... Is one simply acting as the result of a paucity of elements, or of such an overwhelming dominion over a host of elements that this power enlists the latter into its service if it requires them? ... Is one a *problem* one's self or is one a *solution* already? ... Is *one perfect* through the smallness of the task, or *imperfect* owing to the extraordinary character of the aim? ... Is one genuine or only an *actor;* is one genuine as an actor, or only the bad copy of an actor? is one a representative or the creature represented? Is one a personality or merely a rendezvous of personalities? ... Is one ill from a disease or from surplus health? Does one lead as a shepherd, or as an "exception" \(third alternative: as a fugitive\)? Is one in need of dignity, or can one play the clown? Is one in search of resistance, or is one evading it? Is one imperfect owing to one's precocity or to one's tardiness? Is it one's nature to say yea, or no, or is one a peacock's tail of garish parts? Is one proud enough not to feel ashamed even of one's vanity? Is one still able to feel a bite of conscience \(this species is becoming rare; formerly conscience had to bite too often: it is as if it now no longer had enough teeth to do so\)? Is one still capable of a "duty"? \(there are some people who would lose the whole joy of their lives if they were *deprived* of their duty—this holds good especially of feminine creatures, who are born subjects\).



1010.

Supposing our common comprehension of the universe were a *misunderstanding,* would it be possible to conceive of a form of *perfection,* within the limits of which even such a *misunderstanding as this* could be sanctioned?

The concept of a *new* form of perfection: that which does *not* correspond to our logic, to our "beauty," to our "good," to our "truth," might be perfect in a *higher* sense even than our ideal is.



1011.

Our most important limitation: we must not deify the unknown; we are just beginning to know so little. The false and wasted endeavours.

Our "new world": we must ascertain to what extent we are the *creators* of our valuations—we will thus be able to put "sense" into history.

This belief in truth is reaching its final logical conclusion in us—ye know how it reads: that if there is anything at all that must be worshipped it is *appearance;* that *falsehood* and *not* truth is—divine.



1012.

He who urges rational thought forward, thereby also drives its antagonistic power—mysticism and foolery of every kind—to new feats of strength.

We should recognise that every movement is \(1\) *partly* the manifestation of fatigue resulting from a previous movement \(satiety after it, the malice of weakness towards it, and disease\); and \(2\) *partly* a newly awakened accumulation of long slumbering forces, and therefore wanton, violent, healthy.



1013.

Health and morbidness: let us be careful\! The standard is the bloom of the body, the agility, courage, and cheerfulness of the mind—but also, of course, how much *morbidness a man can bear and overcome,*—and convert into health. That which would send more delicate natures to the dogs, belongs to the stimulating means of *great* health.



1014.

It is only a question of power: to have all the morbid traits of the century, but to balance them I by means of overflowing, plastic, and rejuvenating power. The *strong* man.



1015.

*Concerning the strength of the nineteenth century.—*We are more mediæval than the eighteenth century; not only more inquisitive or more susceptible to the strange and to the rare. We have revolted against the *Revolution,* ... We have freed ourselves from the fear of reason, which was the spectre of the eighteenth century: we once more dare to be childish, lyrical, absurd, in a word, we are musicians. And we are just as little frightened of the *ridiculous* as of the *absurd.* The *devil* finds that he is tolerated even by God:\[6\] better still, he has become interesting as one who has been misunderstood and slandered for ages,—we are the saviours of the devil's honour.

We no longer separate the great from the terrible. We reconcile good things, in all their complexity, with the very *worst* things; we have overcome the *desideratum* of the past \(which wanted goodness to grow without the increase of evil\). The *cowardice* towards the ideal, peculiar to the Renaissance, has diminished—we even dare to aspire to the latter's morality. *Intolerance* towards priests and the Church has at the same time come to an end; "It is immoral to believe in God"—but this is precisely what we regard as the best possible justification of this belief.

On all these things we have conferred the civic rights of our minds. We do not tremble before the back side of "good things" \(we even look for it, we are brave and inquisitive enough for that\), of Greek antiquity, of morality, of reason, of good taste, for instance \(we reckon up the losses which we incur with all this treasure: we almost reduce ourselves to poverty with such a treasure\). Neither do we conceal the back side of "evil things" from ourselves.


\[6\] This is reminiscent of Goethe's *Faust,* See "Prologue in Heaven."—Tr.




1016.

*That which does us honour.*—If anything does us honour, it is this: we have transferred our seriousness to other things; all those things which have been despised and laid aside as base by all ages, we regard as important—on the other hand, we surrender "fine feelings" at a cheap rate.

Could any aberration be more dangerous than the contempt of the body? As if all intellectuality were not thereby condemned to become morbid, and to take refuge in the *vapeurs* of "idealism"\!

Nothing that has been thought out by Christians and idealists holds water: we are more radical. We have discovered the "smallest world" everywhere as the most decisive.

The paving-stones in the streets, good air in our rooms, food understood according to its worth: we value all the *necessaries* of life seriously, and *despise* all "beautiful soulfulness" as a form of "levity and frivolity." That which has been most despised hitherto, is now pressed into the front rank.



1017

In the place of Rousseau's "man of Nature," the nineteenth century has discovered a much *more genuine* image of "Man,"—it had the courage to do this.... On the whole, the Christian concept of man has in a way been reinstalled. What we have not had the courage to do, was to call precisely this "man *par excellence*," good, and to see the future of mankind guaranteed in him. In the same way, we did not dare to regard the *growth in the terrible side* of man's character as an accompanying feature of every advance in culture; in this sense we are still under the influence of the Christian ideal, and side with it against paganism, and likewise against the Renaissance concept of *virtù.* But the key of culture is not to be found in this way: and *in praxi* we still have the forgeries of history in favour of the "good man" \(as if he alone constituted the progress of humanity\) and the *socialistic ideal \(i.e.* the *residue* of Christianity and of Rousseau in the de-Christianised world\).



*The fight against the eighteenth century:* it meets with its *greatest conquerors* in *Goethe* and *Napoleon.* Schopenhauer, too, fights against the eighteenth century; but he returns involuntarily to the seventeenth—he is a modern Pascal, with Pascalian valuations, *without* Christianity. Schopenhauer was not strong enough to invent a *new yea.*

*Napoleon:* we see the necessary relationship between the higher and the terrible man. "Man" reinstalled, and her due of contempt and fear restored to woman. Highest activity and health are the signs of the great man; the straight line and grand style rediscovered in action; the mightiest of all instincts, that of life itself,—the lust of dominion,—heartily welcomed.



1018.

\(*Revue des deux mondes,* 15th February 1887. Taine concerning Napoleon\) "Suddenly the master faculty reveals itself: the *artist,* which was latent in the politician, comes forth from his scabbard; he creates *dans l'idéal et l'impossible.* He is once more recognised as that which he is: the posthumous brother of Dante and of Michelangelo; and verily, in view of the definite contours of his vision, the intensity, the coherence, and inner consistency of his dream, the depth of his meditations, the superhuman greatness of his conception, he is their equal: *son génie a la même taille et la même structure; il est un des trois esprits souverains de la renaissance italienne.*"

*Nota bene.* Dante, Michelangelo, Napoleon.





1019.

*Concerning the pessimism of strength.* In the internal economy of *the primitive* man's soul, the *fear* of evil preponderates. What is *evil\!* Three kinds of things: accident, uncertainty, the unexpected. How does primitive man combat evil?—He conceives it as a thing of reason, of power, even as a person. By this means he is enabled to make treaties with it, and generally to operate upon it in advance—to forestall it.

—Another expedient is to declare its evil and harmful character to be but apparent: the consequences of accidental occurrences, and of uncertainty and the unexpected, are interpreted as *well-meant,* as reasonable.

—A third means is to interpret evil, above all, as merited: evil is thus justified as a punishment.

—In short, *man submits to in* all religious and moral interpretations are but forms of submission to evil.—The belief that a good purpose lies behind all evil, implies the renunciation of any desire to combat it.

Now, the history of every culture shows a diminution of this *fear of the accidental, of the uncertain, and of the unexpected.* Culture means precisely, to learn to reckon, to discover causes, to acquire the power of forestalling events, to acquire a belief in necessity. With the growth of culture, man is able to dispense with that primitive form of submission to evil \(called religion or morality\), and that "justification of evil." Now he wages war against "evil,"—he gets rid of it. Yes, a state of security, of belief in law and the possibility of calculation, is possible, in which consciousness regards these things with tedium,—in which the joy of the accidental, of the uncertain, and of the unexpected, actually becomes a spur.

Let us halt a moment before this symptom of *highest* culture, I call it the *pessimism of strength.* Man now no longer requires a "justification of evil"; justification is precisely what he abhors: he enjoys evil, *pur, cru*; he regards purposeless evil as the most interesting kind of evil. If he had required a God in the past, he now delights in cosmic disorder without a God, a world of accident, to the essence of which terror, ambiguity, and seductiveness belong.

In a state of this sort, it is precisely *goodness* which requires to be justified—that is to say, it must either have an evil and a dangerous basis, or else it must contain a vast amount of stupidity: *in which case it still pleases.* Animality no longer awakens terror now; a very intellectual and happy wanton spirit in favour of the animal in man, is, in such periods, the most triumphant form of spirituality. Man is now strong enough to be able to feel ashamed of *a belief in God:* he may now play the part of the devil's advocate afresh. If in practice he pretends to uphold virtue, it will be for those reasons which lead virtue to be associated with subtlety, cunning, lust of gain, and a form of the lust of power.

*This pessimism of strength* also ends in a *theodicy, i.e.* in an absolute saying of yea to the world—but the same arguments will be raised in favour of life which formerly were raised against it: and in this way, in a conception of this world *as the highest ideal possible,* which has been effectively attained.



1020.

*The principal kinds of pessimism:—*

The pessimism of *sensitiveness* \(excessive irritability with a preponderance of the feelings of pain\).

The pessimism of the *will that is not free* \(otherwise expressed: the lack of resisting power against stimuli\).

The pessimism of *doubt* \(shyness in regard to everything fixed, in regard to all grasping and touching\).

The psychological conditions which belong to these different kinds of pessimism, may all be observed in a lunatic asylum, even though they are there found in a slightly exaggerated form. The same applies to "Nihilism" \(the penetrating feeling of nonentity\).

What, however, is the nature of Pascal's moral pessimism, and the *metaphysical pessimism* of the Vedânta-Philosophy? What is the nature of the *social pessimism* of anarchists \(as of Shelley\), and of the pessimism of compassion \(like that of Leo Tolstoy and of Alfred de Vigny\)?

Are all these things not also the phenomena of decay and sickness?... And is not excessive seriousness in regard to moral values, or in regard to "other-world" fictions, or social calamities, or *suffering* in general, of the same order? All such *exaggeration* of a single and narrow standpoint is in itself a sign of sickness. The same applies to the preponderance of a negative over an affirmative attitude\!

*In this respect we must not confound with the above:* the joy of saying and doing *no,* which is the result of the enormous power and tenseness of an affirmative attitude—peculiar to all rich and mighty men and ages. It is, as it were, a luxury, a form of courage too, which opposes the terrible, which has sympathy with the frightful and the questionable, because, among other things, one is terrible and questionable: the *Dionysian* in will, intellect, and taste.



1021.

*My Five "Noes."*

\(1\) My fight against *the feeling of sin* and the introduction of the notion of *punishment* into the physical and metaphysical world, likewise into psychology and the interpretation of history. The recognition of the fact that all philosophies and valuations hitherto have been saturated with morality.

\(2\) My identification and my discovery of the *traditional* ideal, of the Christian ideal, even where the dogmatic form of Christianity has been wrecked. The *danger of the Christian ideal* resides in its valuations, in that which can dispense with concrete expression: my struggle against *latent Christianity* \(for instance, in music, in Socialism\).

\(3\) My struggle against the eighteenth century of Rousseau, against his "Nature," against his "good man," his belief in the dominion of feeling—against the pampering, weakening, and moralising of man: an ideal born of the *hatred of aristocratic culture,* which in practice is the dominion of unbridled feelings of resentment, and invented as a standard for the purpose of war \(the Christian morality of the feeling of sin, as well as the morality of resentment, is an attitude of the mob\).

\(4\) My fight against *Romanticism,* in which the ideals of Christianity and of Rousseau converge, but which possesses at the same time a yearning for that *antiquity* which knew of sacerdotal and aristocratic culture, a yearning for *virtù,* and for the "strong man"—something extremely hybrid; a false and imitated kind of *stronger* humanity, which appreciates extreme conditions in general and sees the symptom of strength in them \("the cult of passion"; an imitation of the most expressive *forms, furore espressivo,* originating not out of plenitude, but out *of want\).*—\(In the nineteenth century there are some things which are born out of relative plenitude—*i.e.* out of *well-being;* cheerful music, etc.—among poets, for instance, Stifter and Gottfried Keller give signs of more strength and inner well-being than—. The great strides of engineering, of inventions, of the natural sciences and of history \(?\) are relative products of the strength and self-reliance of the nineteenth century.\)

\(5\) My struggle against the *predominance of gregarious instincts,* now science makes common cause with them; against the profound hate with which every kind of order of rank and of aloofness is treated.





1022.

From the pressure of plenitude, from the tension of forces that are continually increasing within us and which cannot yet discharge themselves, a condition is produced which is very similar to that which precedes a storm: we—like Nature's sky—become overcast. I hat, too, is "pessimism.".. A teaching which puts an end to such a condition by the fact that it *commands* something: a transvaluation of values by means of which the accumulated forces are given a channel, a direction, so that they explode into deeds and flashes of lightning-does not in the least require to be a hedonistic teaching: in so far as it *releases strength* which was compressed to an agonising degree, it brings happiness.



1023.

*Pleasure* appears with the feeling of power.

*Happiness* means that the consciousness of power and triumph has begun to prevail.

*Progress* is the strengthening of the type, the ability to exercise great will-power, everything else is a misunderstanding and a danger.



1024.

There comes a time when the old masquerade and moral togging-up of the passions provokes repugnance: *naked Nature;* when the *quanta* of *power* are recognised as *decidedly* simple \(as *determining rank*\); when *grand style* appears again as the result of great passion.





1025.

The purpose of culture *would have* us enlist everything terrible, step by step and experimentally, into its service; but before it is *strong enough* for this it must combat, moderate, mask, and even curse everything terrible.

Wherever a culture points to anything as evil, it betrays its *fear* and therefore weakness.

*Thesis:* everything good is the evil of yore which has been rendered serviceable. *Standard:* the more terrible and the greater the passions may be which an age, a people, and an individual are at liberty to possess, because they are able to use them as *a means, the higher is their culture:* the more mediocre, weak, submissive, and cowardly a man may be, the more things he will regard as *evil:* according to him the kingdom of evil is the largest. The lowest man will see the kingdom of evil \(*i.e.* that which is forbidden him and which is hostile to him\) everywhere.



1026.

It is not a fact that "happiness follows virtue"—but it is the mighty man who first *declares his happy state to be virtue.*

Evil actions belong to the mighty and the virtuous: bad and base actions belong to the subjected.

The mightiest man, the creator, would have to be the most evil, inasmuch as he makes his ideal prevail over all men in *opposition* to their ideals, and remoulds them according to his own image.



Evil, in this respect, means hard, painful, enforced.

Such men as Napoleon must always return and always settle our belief in the self-glory of the individual afresh: he himself, however, was corrupted by the means he had to stoop to, and had *lost noblesse* of character. If he had had to prevail among another kind of men, he could have availed himself of other means; and thus it would not seem *necessary* that a Cæsar *must become bad.*



1027.

Man is a combination of the *beast* and the *super-beast*; higher man a combination of the monster and the superman:\[7\] these opposites belong to each other. With every degree of a man's growth towards greatness and loftiness, he also grows downwards into the depths and into the terrible: we should not desire the one without the other;—or, better still: the more fundamentally we desire the one, the more completely we shall achieve the other.




\[7\] The play on the German words: "Unthier" and "Überthier," "Unmensch" and "Übermensch," is unfortunately not translatable.—Tr.




1028.

Terribleness belongs to greatness: let us not deceive ourselves.



1029.

I have taught the knowledge of such terrible things, that all "Epicurean contentment" is impossible concerning them. Dionysian pleasure is the only *adequate* kind here: *I was the first to discover the tragic.* Thanks to their superficiality in ethics, the Greeks misunderstood it. Resignation is not the lesson of tragedy, but only the misunderstanding of it\! The yearning for nonentity is the *denial* of tragic wisdom, its opposite\!



1030.

A rich and powerful soul not only gets over painful and even terrible losses, deprivations, robberies, and insults: it actually leaves such dark infernos in possession of still greater plenitude and power; and, what is most important of all, in possession of an increased blissfulness in love. I believe that he who has divined something of the most fundamental conditions of love, will understand Dante for having written over the door of his Inferno: "I also am the creation of eternal love."



1031.

To have travelled over the whole circumference of the modern soul, and to have sat in all its corners—my ambition, my torment, and my happiness.

Veritably to have *overcome* pessimism, and, as the result thereof, to have acquired the eyes of a Goethe—full of love and goodwill.



1032.

The first question is by no means whether we are satisfied with ourselves; but whether we are satisfied with anything at all. Granting that we should say yea to any single moment, we have then affirmed not only ourselves, but the whole of existence. For nothing stands by itself, either in us or in other things: and if our soul has vibrated and rung with happiness, like a chord, once only and only once, then all eternity was necessary in order to bring about that one event,—and all eternity, in this single moment of our affirmation, was called good, was saved, justified, and blessed.



1033.

The passions which *say yea.* I ride, happiness, health, the love of the sexes, hostility and war, reverence, beautiful attitudes, manners, strong will, the discipline of lofty spirituality, the will to power, and gratitude to the Earth and to Life: all that is rich, that would fain bestow, and that refreshes, gilds, immortalises, and deifies Life—the whole power of the virtues that *glorify*—all declaring things good, saying yea, and doing yea.



1034.

We, many or few, who once more dare to live in a world *purged of morality*, we *pagans* in faith, we are probably also the first who understand what a *pagan faith* is: to be obliged to imagine higher creatures than man, but to imagine them *beyond* good and evil; to be compelled to value all higher existence as *immoral* existence. We believe in Olympus, and *not* in the "man on the cross."





1035.

The more modern man has exercised his idealising power in regard to a *God* mostly by *moralising the latter* ever more and more—what does that mean?—nothing good, a diminution in man's strength.

As a matter of fact, the reverse would be possible: and indications of this are not wanting. God imagined as emancipation from morality, comprising the whole of the abundant assembly of Life's contrasts, and *saving* and *justifying* them in a divine agony. God as the beyond, the superior elevation, to the wretched *cul-de-sac* morality of "Good and Evil."



1036.

A humanitarian God cannot be *demonstrated* from the world that is known to us: so much are ye driven and forced to conclude to-day. But what conclusion do ye draw from this? "He cannot be demonstrated to *us*": the scepticism of knowledge. You all *fear* the conclusion: "From the world that is known to us quite a different God would be *demonstrable,* such a one as would certainly not be humanitarian"—and, in a word, you cling fast to your God, and invent a world for Him which *is unknown to us.*



1037.

Let us banish the highest good from our concept of God: it is unworthy of a God. Let us likewise banish the highest wisdom: it is the vanity of philosophers who have perpetrated the absurdity of a God who is a monster of wisdom: the idea was to make Him as like them as possible. No\! God *as the highest power*—that is sufficient\!—Everything follows from that, even—"the world"\!



1038

And how many new Gods are not still possible\! I, myself, in whom the religious—that is to say, the god-*creating* instinct occasionally becomes active at the most inappropriate moments: how very differently the divine has revealed itself every time to me\! ... So many strange things have passed before me in those timeless moments, which fall into a man's life as if they came from the moon, and in which he absolutely no longer knows how old he is or how young he still may be\! ... I would not doubt that there are several kinds of gods.... Some are not wanting which one could not possibly imagine without a certain halcyonic calm and levity.... Light feet perhaps belong to the concept "God". Is it necessary to explain that a *God* knows how to hold Himself preferably outside all Philistine and rationalist circles? also \(between ourselves\) beyond good and evil? His outlook is a *free* one—as Goethe would say.—And to invoke the authority of Zarathustra, which cannot be too highly appreciated in this regard: Zarathustra goes as far as to confess, "I would only believe in a God who knew how to *dance* ..."



Again I say: how many new Gods are not still possible\! Certainly Zarathustra himself is merely an old atheist: he believes neither in old nor in new gods. Zarathustra says, *"he would"*—but Zarathustra will not.... Take care to understand him well.

The type God conceived according to the type of creative spirits, of "great men."



1039.

And how many new *ideals* are not, at bottom, still possible? Here is a little ideal that I seize upon every five weeks, while upon a wild and lonely walk, in the azure moment of a blasphemous joy. To spend one's life amid delicate and absurd things; a stranger to reality, half-artist, half-bird, half-metaphysician; without a yea or a nay for reality, save that from time to time one acknowledges it, after the manner of a good dancer, with the tips of one's toes; always tickled by some happy ray of sunlight; relieved and encouraged even by sorrow —for sorrow *preserves* the happy man; fixing a little tail of jokes even to the most holy thing: this, as is clear, is the ideal of a heavy spirit, a ton in weight *of the spirit of gravity.*



1040.

*From the military-school of the soul.* \(Dedicated to the brave, the good-humoured, and the abstinent.\)

I should not like to undervalue the amiable virtues; but greatness of soul is not compatible with them. Even in the arts, grand style excludes all merely pleasing qualities.

\*\*\*

In times of painful tension and vulnerability, choose war. War hardens and develops muscle.

\*\*\*

Those who have been deeply wounded have the Olympian laughter; a man only has what he needs.

\*\*\*

It has now already lasted ten years: no sound any longer *reaches* me—a land without rain. A man must have a vast amount of humanity at his disposal in order not to pine away in such drought.\[8\]


\[8\] For the benefit of those readers who are not acquainted with the circumstances of Nietzsche's life, it would be as well to point out that this is a purely personal plaint, comprehensible enough in the mouth of one who, like Nietzsche, was for years a lonely anchorite.—Tr.




1041.

*My new road to an affirmative attitude.*—Philosophy, as I have understood it and lived it up to the present, is the voluntary quest of the repulsive and atrocious aspects of existence. From the long experience derived from such wandering over ice and desert, I learnt to regard quite differently everything that had been philosophised hitherto: the *concealed* history of philosophy, the psychology of its great names came into the light for me. "How much truth can a spirit *endure*; for how much truth is it *daring* enough?"—this for me was the real measure of value. Error is a piece of *cowardice* ... every victory on the part of knowledge, is the *result* of courage, of hardness towards one's self, of cleanliness towards one's self.... The kind of *experimental philosophy* which I am living, even anticipates the possibility of the most fundamental Nihilism, on principle: but by this I do not mean that it remains standing at a negation, at a *no,* or at a will to negation. It would rather attain to the very reverse—to a *Dionysian affirmation* of the world, as it is, without subtraction, exception, or choice—it would have eternal circular motion: the same things, the same reasoning, and the same illogical concatenation. The highest state to which a philosopher can attain: to maintain a Dionysian attitude to Life—my formula for this is *amor fati.*

To this end we must not only consider those aspects of life which have been denied hitherto, as: *necessary,* but as desirable, and not only desirable to those aspects which have been affirmed hitherto \(as complements or first prerequisites, so to speak\), but for their own sake, as the more powerful, more terrible, and more *veritable* aspects of life, in which the latter's will expresses itself most clearly.

To this end, we must also value that aspect of existence which alone has been affirmed until now; we must understand whence this valuation arises, and to how slight an extent it has to do with a Dionysian valuation of Life: I selected and understood that which in this respect says "yea" \(on the one hand, the instinct of the sufferer; on the other, the gregarious instinct; and thirdly, the *instinct of the greater number* against the exceptions\).



Thus I divined to what extent a stronger kind of man must necessarily imagine—the elevation and enhancement of man in another direction: *higher creatures,* beyond good and evil, beyond those values which bear the stamp of their origin in the sphere of suffering, of the herd, and of the greater number—I searched for the data of this topsy-turvy formation of ideals in history \(the concepts "pagan," "classical," "noble," have been discovered afresh and brought forward\).



1042.

We should demonstrate to what extent the religion of the Greeks was *higher* than Judæo-Christianity. The latter triumphed because the Greek religion was degenerate \(and decadent\).



1043.

It is not surprising that a couple of centuries have been necessary in order to link up again—a couple of centuries are very little indeed.



1044.

There must be some people who sanctify functions, not only eating and drinking, and not only in memory of them, or in harmony with them; but this world must be for ever glorified anew, and in a novel fashion.



1045.

The most intellectual men feel the ecstasy and charm of *sensual* things in a way which other men —those with "fleshy hearts"—cannot possibly imagine, and ought not to be able to imagine: they are sensualists with the best possible faith, because they grant the senses a more fundamental value than that fine sieve, that thinning and mincing machine, or whatever it is called, which in the language of the people is termed *"spirit"* The strength and power of the senses—this is the most essential thing in a sound man who is one of Nature's lucky strokes: the splendid beast must first be there—otherwise what is the value of all "humanisation"?



1046.

\(1\) We want to hold fast to our senses, and to the belief in them—and accept their logical conclusions\! The hostility to the senses in the philosophy that has been written up to the present, has been man's greatest feat of nonsense.

\(2\) The world now extant, on which all earthly and living things have so built themselves, that it now appears as it does \(enduring and proceeding slowly\), we would fain *continue building*—not criticise it away as false\!

\(3\) Our valuations help in the process of building; they emphasise and accentuate. What does it mean when whole religions say: "Everything is bad and false and evil"? This condemnation of the whole process can only be the judgment of the failures\!

\(4\) True, the failures might be the greatest sufferers and therefore the most subtle\! The contented might be worth little\!



\(5\) We must understand the fundamental *artistic* phenomenon which is called "Life,"—*the formative* spirit, which constructs under the most unfavourable circumstances: and in the slowest manner possible——The *proof* of all its combinations must first be given afresh: *it maintains itself.*



1047.

Sexuality, lust of dominion, the pleasure derived from appearance and deception, great and joyful gratitude to Life and its typical conditions—these things are essential to all paganism, and it has a good conscience on its side.—*That which is hostile to Nature* \(already in Greek antiquity\) combats paganism in the form of morality and dialectics.



1040.

An anti-metaphysical view of the world—yes, but an artistic one.



1049.

*Apollo's* misapprehension: the eternity of beautiful forms, the aristocratic prescription, "*Thus shall it ever be\!*"

*Dionysus*. Sensuality and cruelty. The perishable nature of existence might be interpreted as the joy of procreative and destructive force, as *unremitting creation.*



1050.

The word "*Dionysian*" expresses: a constraint to unity, a soaring above personality, the common-place, society, reality, and above the abyss of the *ephemeral*, the passionately painful sensation of superabundance, in darker, fuller, and more fluctuating conditions; an ecstatic saying of yea to the collective character of existence, as that which remains the same, and equally mighty and blissful throughout all change, the great pantheistic sympathy with pleasure and pain, which declares even the most terrible and most questionable qualities of existence good, and sanctifies them; the eternal will to procreation, to fruitfulness, and to recurrence; the feeling of unity in regard to the necessity of creating and annihilating.

The word "*Apollonian*" expresses: the constraint to be absolutely isolated, to the typical "individual," to everything that simplifies, distinguishes, and makes strong, salient, definite, and typical to freedom within the law.

The further development of art is just as necessarily bound up with the antagonism of these two natural art-forces, as the further development of mankind is bound up with the antagonism of the sexes. The plenitude of power and restraint, the highest form of self-affirmation in a cool, noble, and reserved kind of beauty: the Apollonianism of the Hellenic will.

This antagonism of the Dionysian and of the Apollonian in the Greek soul, is one of the great riddles which made me feel drawn to the essence of Hellenism. At bottom, I troubled about nothing save the solution of the question, why precisely Greek Apollonianism should have been forced to grow out of a Dionysian soil: the Dionysian Greek had need of being Apollonian; that is to say in order to break his will to the titanic, to the complex, to the uncertain, to the horrible by a will to measure, to simplicity, and to submission to rule and concept. Extravagance, wildness, and Asiatic tendencies lie at the root of the Greeks. Their courage consists in their struggle with their Asiatic nature: they were not given beauty, any more than they were given Logic and moral\! naturalness: in them these things are victories, they are willed and fought for—they constitute the *triumph* of the Greeks.



1051.

It is clear that only the rarest and most lucky cases of humanity can attain to the highest and most sublime human joys in which Life celebrates its own glorification; and this only happens when these rare creatures themselves and their forbears have lived a long preparatory life leading to this goal, without, however, having done so consciously. It is then that an overflowing wealth of multifarious forces and the most agile power of "free will" and lordly command exist together in perfect concord in one man; then the intellect is just as much at ease, or at home, in the senses as the senses are at ease or at home in it; and everything that takes place in the latter must give rise to extraordinarily subtle joys in the former. And *vice versâ:* just think of this *vice versâ* for a moment in a man like Hafiz; even Goethe, though to a lesser degree, gives some idea of this process. It is probable that, in such perfect and well-constituted men, the most sensual functions are finally transfigured by a symbolic elatedness of the highest intellectuality; in themselves they feel a kind of *deification of the body* and are most remote from the ascetic philosophy of the principle "God is a Spirit": from this principle it is clear that the ascetic is the "botched man" who declares only that to be good and "God" which is absolute, and which judges and condemns.

From that height of joy in which man feels himself completely and utterly a deified form and self-justification of nature, down to the joy of healthy peasants and healthy semi-human beasts, the whole of this long and enormous gradation of the light and colour of *happiness* was called by the Greek—not without that grateful quivering of one who is initiated into secret, not without much caution and pious silence—by the godlike name: *Dionysus.* What then *do* all modern men—the children of a crumbling, multifarious, sick and strange age *know* of the *compass* of Greek happiness, how *could* they know anything about it\! Whence would the slaves of "modern ideas" derive their right to Dionysian feasts\!

When the Greek body and soul were in full "bloom," and not, as it were, in states of morbid exaltation and madness, there arose the secret symbol of the loftiest affirmation and transfiguration of life and the world that has ever existed. There we have a *standard* beside which everything that has grown since must seem too short, too poor, too narrow: if we but pronounce the word "Dionysus" in the presence of the best of more recent names and things, in the presence of Goethe, for instance, or Beethoven, or Shakespeare, or Raphael, in a trice we realise that our best things and moments are *condemned.* Dionysus is a *judge\!* Am I understood? There can be no doubt that the Greeks sought to interpret, by means of their Dionysian experiences, the final mysteries of the "destiny of the soul" and everything they knew concerning the education and the purification of man, and above all concerning the absolute hierarchy and inequality of value between man and man. There is the deepest experience of all Greeks, which they conceal beneath great silence,—*we do not know the Greeks* so long as this hidden and sub-terranean access to them remains obstructed. The indiscreet eyes of scholars will never perceive anything in these things, however much learned energy may still have to be expended in the service of this excavation—; even the noble zeal of such friends of antiquity as Goethe and Winckelmann, seems to savour somewhat of bad form and of arrogance, precisely in this respect. To wait and to prepare oneself; to await the appearance of new sources of knowledge; to prepare oneself in solitude for the sight of new faces and the sound of new voices; to cleanse one's soul ever more and more of the dust and noise, as of a country fair, which is peculiar to this age; to *overcome* everything Christian by something super-Christian, and not only to rid oneself of it,—for the Christian doctrine is the counter-doctrine to the Dionysian; to rediscover the *South* in oneself, and to stretch a clear, glittering, and mysterious southern sky above one; to reconquer the southern healthiness and concealed power of the soul, once more for oneself; to increase the compass of one's soul step by step, and to become more supernational, more European, more super-European, more Oriental, and finally more *Hellenic*—for Hellenism was, as a matter of fact, the first great union and synthesis of everything Oriental, and precisely on that account, the *beginning* of the European soul, the discovery of *our "new* world":—he who lives under such imperatives, who knows what he may not encounter some day? Possibly—a *new dawn\!*



1052.

*The two types; Dionysus and Christ on the Cross.* We should ascertain whether the typically *religious* man is a decadent phenomenon \(the great innovators are one and all morbid and epileptic\); but do not let us forget to include that type of the religious man who is *pagan.* Is the pagan cult not a form of gratitude for, and affirmation of, Life? Ought not its most representative type to be an apology and deification of Life? The type of a well-constituted and ecstatically overflowing spirit\! The type of a spirit which absorbs the contradictions and problems of existence, and which *solves* them\!

At this point I set up the *Dionysus* of the Greeks: the religious affirmation of Life, of the whole of Life, not of denied and partial Life \(it is typical that in this cult the sexual act awakens ideas of depth, mystery, and reverence\).



Dionysus *versus* "Christ"; here you have the contrast. It is *not* a difference in regard to the martyrdom,—but the latter has a different meaning. Life itself—Life s eternal fruitfulness and recurrence caused anguish, destruction, and the will to annihilation. In the other case, the suffering of the "Christ as the Innocent One" stands as an objection against Life, it is the formula of Life's condemnation.—Readers will guess that the problem concerns the meaning of suffering; whether a Christian or a tragic meaning be given to it. In the first case it is the road to a holy mode of existence; in the second case *existence itself is regarded as sufficiently holy* to justify an enormous amount of suffering. The tragic man says yea even to the most excruciating suffering: he is sufficiently strong, rich, and capable of deifying, to be able to do this; the Christian denies even the happy lots on earth: he is weak, poor, and disinherited enough to suffer from life in any form. God on the Cross is a curse upon Life, a signpost directing people to deliver themselves from it;—Dionysus cut into pieces is a *promise* of Life: it will be for ever born anew, and rise afresh from destruction.
