## 3 WOP AS SOCIETY AND INDIVIDUAL

III. THE WILL TO POWER AS SOCIETY AND INDIVIDUAL

1. Society and State

716 (March-June 1888) Basic principle: only individuals feel themselves responsible. Multiplicities are invented in order to do things for which the individual lacks the courage. It is for just this reason that all com munalities and societies are a hundred times more upright and instructive about the nature of man than is the individual, who is too weak to have the courage for his own desires

The whole of "altruism" reveals itself as the prudence of the private man: societies are not "altruistic" towards one another

The commandment to love one's neighbor has never yet been extended to include one's actual neighbor. That relationship is still governed by the words of Manu: "We must consider all coun tries that have common borders with us, and their allies, too, as our enemies. For the same reason, we must count all their neigh bors as being well-disposed toward us."

The study of society is so invaluable because man as society is much more naive than man as a "unit." "Society" has never regarded virtue ás anything but a means to strength, power, and order.

How simple and dignified is Maniu when he says: "Virtue could scarcely endure by its own strength. Fundamentally it is only the fear of punishment that keeps men within bounds and leaves everyone in peaceful possession of his own."92

717 (Nov. 1887-March 1888)

The state organized immorality-internally: as police, penal law, classes, commerce, family; externally: as will to power, to war, to conquest, to revenge.

How does it happen that the state will do a host of things that the individual would never countenance?- Through division of responsibility, of command, and of execution. Through the interposition of the virtues of obedience, duty, patriotism, and

BOOK THREE: Principles of A New Evaluation

383 loyalty. Through upholding pride, severity, strength, hatred, revenge -in short, all typical characteristics that contradict the herd type.

718 (Nov. 1887-March 1888)

None of you has the courage to kill a man, or even to whip him, or even to--but the tremendous machine of the state over powers the individual, so he repudiates responsibility for what he does (obedience, oath, etc.)

--Everything a man does in the service of the state is con trary to his nature.

-in the same way, everything he learns with a view to future state service is contrary to his nature.

This is achieved through division of labor (so that no one any longer possesses the full responsibility):

the lawgiver—and he who enacts the law;

the teacher of discipline and those who have grown hard and severe under discipline.

719 (Spring-Fall 1887)

A division of labor among the affects within society: so indi viduals and classes produce an incomplete, but for that reason more useful kind of soul. To what extent certain affects have remained almost rudimentary in every type within society (with a view to developing another affect more strongly).

Justification of morality: economic (the intention to exploit individual strength to

the greatest possible extent to prevent the squandering

of everything exceptional); aesthetic (the formation of firm types, together with pleasure

in one's own type); political (the art of enduring the tremendous tension between

differing degrees of power); physiological (as a pretended high evaluation in favor of the

underprivileged or mediocrem for the preservation of the weak).

720 (1886-1887)

The most fearful and fundamental desire in man, bis drive

384

THE WILL TO POWER

for power--this drive is called "freedom”- must be held in check the longest. This is why ethics, with its unconscious instinct for education and breeding, has hitherto aimed at holding the desire for power in check: it disparages the tyrannical individual and with its glorification of social welfare and patriotism emphasizes the power-instinct of the herd.

721 (Spring-Fall 1887)

Inability to acquire power: its hypocrisy and shrewdness: as obedience (subordination, pride in duty, morality-); as sub mission, devotion, love (idealization, deification of him who commands as compensation and indirect self-transfiguration); as fatalism, resignation; as "objectivity"; as self-tyranny (Stoicism, asceticism, "emancipation from the self," "sanctification"); as criticism, pessimism, indignation, torment; as "beautiful soul," "virtue," "self-deification," "detachment," "unspotted by the world," etc. (the insight into an inability to acquire power disguised as dédain). In all this there is expressed the need to exercise some sort of power nonetheless, or to create for one self the temporary appearance of powermas intoxication.

Men who want power for the sake of the happiness power provides: political parties.

Other men who want power even accompanied by obvious disadvantages and sacrifices in happiness and well-being: the ambitious.

Other men who want power merely because it would other wise fall into other hands upon which they do not want to be dependent.

722 (1886-1887)

Critique of "justice" and "equality before the law": what is really supposed to be abolished through this? Tension, enmity, hatred. — But it is an error to suppose that "happiness" will be increased in this way: Corsicans, e.g., enjoy more happiness than Continentals.

723 (Nov. 1887-March 1888)

Reciprocity, the hidden intention to claim reward: one of the

385

BOOK THREE: Principles of A New Evaluation most insidious forms of the diminution of the value of man. It brings with it that "equality" which depreciates the distancing gulf as immoral

724 (Spring-Fall 1887) What "useful” means is entirely dependent upon the inten tion, the wherefore? The intention, the "goal," is again entirely dependent on the degree of power. Therefore utilitarianism is not a foundation but only a theory of consequences, and absolutely cannot be made obligatory for everyone.

725 (Summer-Fall 1883) Formerly one had the theory of the state as a calculating utility: now one has the practice as well. The age of kings is past because the peoples are no longer worthy of them: they do not want to see the symbol of their ideal in kings, but a means for their profit. That is the whole truth!

726 (Spring-Fall 1887)

Attempt on my part to grasp the absolute rationality of social judgment and evaluation (naturally without the desire to deduce moral conclusions).

the degree of psychological falsity and opacity needed to sanctify the affects essential for preservation and enhancement of power in order to create a good conscience for them).

the degree of stupidity needed to maintain the possibility of common rules and valuations in addition education, supervision of the elements of culture, training).

the degree of inquisition, mistrust, and intolerance needed to deal with the exceptions as criminals and to suppress them—to give them a bad conscience, so they suffer their exceptionalness as a disease.

727 (Spring-Fall 1887) Morality essentially a shield, a means of defense; to this extent a sign of the immature (armored, stoical).

The mature man has, above all, weapons: he attacks.386

THE WILL TO POWER

Instruments of war transformed into instruments of peace (from scales and armor, feathers and hair).

728 (March-June 1888)

It is part of the concept of the living that it must grow that it must extend its power and consequently incorporate alien forces. Intoxicated by moral narcotics, one speaks of the right of the individual to defend himself; in the same sense one might also speak of his right to attack: for both-and the second even more than the first-are necessities for every living thing: -

aggressive and defensive egoism are not matters of choice, to say nothing of "free will," but the fatality of life itself.

In this case it is all the same whether one has in view an individual or a living body, an aspiring "society." The right to punish (or the self-defense of society) is at bottom called a "right" owing to a misuse of the word. A right is acquired through treaties--but self-protection and self-defense do not rest on the basis of a treaty. At least a people might just as well designate as a right its need to conquer, its lust for power, whether by means of arms or by trade, commerce and colonization the right to growth, perhaps. A society that definitely and instinctively gives up war and conquest is in decline: it is ripe for democracy and tlie rule of shopkeepers-- In most cases, to be sure, assurances of peace are merely narcotics.

729 (Nov. 1887-March 1888)

The maintenance of the military state is the last means of all of acquiring or maintaining the great tradition with regard to the supreme type of man, the strong type. And all concepts that perpetuate enmity and difference in rank between states (e.g., nationalism, protective tariffs) may appear sanctioned in this light.

730 (1885-1886)

That something longer-lasting than an individual should endure, that a work should endure which has perhaps been created by an individual: to that end, every possible kind of limi tation, one-sidedness, etc., must be imposed upon the individual.

387

BOOK THREE: Principles of A New Evaluation By what means? Love, reverence, gratitude toward the person who created the work helps, or that our forefathers fought for it; or that my descendants will be guaranteed only if I guarantee this work (e.g., the polis). Morality is essentially the means of en suring the duration of something beyond individuals, or rather through an enslavement of the individual. It is obvious that the perspective from below will produce quite different expressions from that from above.

A complex of power: how is it maintained? By the fact that many generations sacrifice themselves for it; i.e.,—03

731 (Spring-Fall 1887) The continuum: “marriage, property, language, tradition, tribe, family, people, state" are continuums of lower and higher orders. Their economy resides in the preponderance of the advan tages of uninterrupted work and of multiplicity over the disadvan tages: the higher cost of exchange between parts or of making them last. (Multiplication of the effective parts, which, however, often remain unemployed; thus a higher cost of acquisition and a not inconsiderable cost in maintenance.) The advantage resides in the fact that interruptions are avoided and losses that would arise from them are saved. Nothing is more costly than a beginning.

"The greater the advantages for existence, the greater the cost of maintenance and production (food and propagation); the greater, too, the danger and probability of perishing before the high point is reached."

732 (Summer-Fall 1888)

Marriage in the bourgeois sense of the word I mean, in the most respectable sense of the word "marriage is not a matter of love, any more than it is a question of money; no institution can be founded on love. It is a question of society's granting per mission to two people to gratify their sexual desires with one another, under certain conditions, to be sure, but conditions that keep the interests of society in view. It is obvious that a certain attraction between the parties and very much good will-will to patience, compatibility, care for one another will be among the presuppositions of such a contract; but one should not misuse the

THE WILL TO POWER word love to describe this! For two lovers in the complete and strong sense of the word sexual gratification is not essential and is really no more than a symbol: for one party, as already said, a symbol of unconditional submission, for the other a symbol of assent to this, a sign of taking possession.

In marriage in the aristocratic, old aristocratic sense of the word it was a question of the breeding of a race (is there still an aristocracy today? Quaeritur)- thus of the maintenance of a fixed, definite type of ruling man: man and woman were sacri ficed to this point of view. It is obvious that love was not the first consideration here; on the contrary! and not even that measure of mutual good will that is a condition of the good bourgeois marriage. What was decisive was the interest of a family, and beyond that—the class. We would shiver a little at the coldness, severity, and calculating clarity of such a noble concept of marriage as has ruled in every healthy aristocracy, in ancient Athens as in the eighteenth century, we warm-blooded animals with sensitive hearts, we "moderns"! Precisely this is why love as a passion--in the great meaning of the word—was invented for the aristocratic world and in it, where constraint and privation were greatestos_

733 (1888)

On the future of marriage: an additional tax (on inherit ance), also additional war service for bachelors from a certain age onwards and increasing (within the community);

advantages of all kinds for fathers who bring many boys into the world: possibly a plural vote;

a medical certificate preceding every marriage and endorsed by the communal authorities, several definite questions must be answered by the couple and by doctors (“family history"-);

as an antidote to prostitution (or as its ennoblement): marriages for a period, legalized (for years, for months), with guarantees for the children;

every marriage warranted and sanctioned by a certain number of trusted men of the community, as a matter of concern to the community. 86

Also a commandment of the love of man.— There are cases in which a child would be a crime: in the case of chronic invalids and neurasthenics of the third degree. What should one do in such cases? - One might at least try encouraging them to chastity, perhaps with the aid of Parsifal music: Parsifal himself, this typical idiot, had only too many reasons not to propagate him self. The trouble is that a certain inability to "control" oneself ( not to react to stimuli, even to very slight sexual stimuli) is one of the most regular consequences of general exhaustion. One would be mistaken, for example, to think of a Leopardi as chaste. The priest, the moralist play a hopeless game in such cases; it would make more sense to go to a pharmacy. After all, society has a duty here: few more pressing and fundamental demands can be made upon it. Society, as the great trustee of life, is re sponsible to life itself for every miscarried life—it also has to pay for such lives: consequently it ought to prevent them. In numerous cases, society ought to prevent procreation: to this end, it may hold in readiness, without regard to descent, rank, or spirit, the most rigorous means of constraint, deprivation of free dom, in certain circumstances castration.

The Biblical prohibition "thou shalt not kill!" is a piece of naiveté compared with the seriousness of the prohibition of life to decadents: "thou shalt not procreate!"Life itself recognizes no solidarity, no "equal rights," between the healthy and the degenerate parts of an organism: one must excise the latter-or the whole will perish.— Sympathy for decadents, equal rights for the ill-constituted-that would be the profoundest immorality, that would be antinature itself as morality!07

payment for a protracted cowardice and mendaciousness, a moment at least of strength: afterwards they perish of it.99

736 (Spring-Fall 1887)

In our civilized world, we learn to know almost only the wretched criminal, crushed by the curse and the contempt of society, mistrustful of himself, often belittling and slandering his deed, a miscarried type of criminal; and we resist the idea that all great human beings have been criminals (only in the grand and not in a miserable style), that crime belongs to greatness ( for that is the experience of those who have tried the reins and of all who have descended deepest into great souls-). To be "free as a bird" from tradition, the conscience of duty- every great human being knows this danger. But he also desires it: he desires a great goal and therefore also the means to it.100

737 (March-June 1888)

Ages in which one leads men with reward and punishment have a low, still primitive kind of man in view: it is as if they were children

Within our late culture, fatality and degeneration are some thing that completely abolishes all meaning of reward and punish ment- This real determination of action through reward and punishment presupposes young, strong, forceful races. In old races, the impulses are so irresistible that a mere idea is quite powerless;-to be unable to offer resistance where a stimulus is given, but to have to respond to it: this extreme susceptibility of decadents renders such systems of punishment and improvement perfectly meaningless.

The concept "improvement" rests on the presupposition of a normal and strong man, whose individual action must in some

Effect of a prohibition. Every power that forbids, that knows how to arouse fear in those to whom something is forbidden, creates a "bad conscience" (that is, the desire for something com bined with the consciousness of danger in satisfying it, with the necessity for secrecy, for underhandedness, for caution). Every prohibition worsens the character of those who do not submit to it willingly, but only because they are compelled.

739 (March-June 1888)

"Reward and punishment."— They stand together, they fall together. Today one does not want to be rewarded, one will not acknowledge the right of anyone to punish - One has put oneself on a war footing: one desires something, one meets with opposi tion, one can perhaps gain what one wants most reasonably if one gets along—if one draws up a contract.

A modern society, in which every individual has drawn up his "contract”--the criminal breaks a contract. That would be a clear concept. But then one could not tolerate within a society anarchists and those who oppose the form of that society or principle

740 (Spring-Fall 1887)

Crime belongs to the concept "revolt against the social order." One does not "punish" a rebel; one suppresses him. A rebel can be a miserable and contemptible man; but there is nothing con temptible in a revolt as such—and to be a rebel in view of con temporary society does not in itself lower the value of a man. There are even cases in which one might have to honor a rebel, because he finds something in our society against which war ought to be wagedhe awakens us from our slumber.

If a criminal perpetrates an individual act against an indi vidual this does not demonstrate that his whole instinct is not

in a state of war with the whole order: his deed as a mere symptom.

One should reduce the concept “punishment" to the concept: suppression of a revolt, security measures against the suppressed (total or partial imprisonment). But one should not express con tempt through punishment: a criminal is in any case a man who risks his life, his honor, his freedom-a man of courage. Neither should one take punishment to be a penance; or as a payment, as if an exchange relationship existed between guilt and punish ment--punishment does not purify, for crime does not sully.

One should not deprive the criminal of the possibility of mak ing his peace with society; provided he does not belong to the race of criminals. In that case one should make war on him even before he has committed any hostile act (first operation as soon as one has him in one's power: his castration).

One should not hold against the criminal his bad manners or the low level of his intelligence. Nothing is more common than that he should misunderstand himself (for often his rebellious in stinct, the rancor of the déclassé, has not reached consciousness, faute le lecture),102 that he should slander and dishonor his deed under the influence of fear and failure quite apart from those cases in which, psychologically speaking, the criminal surrenders to an uncomprehended drive and by some subsidiary action ascribes a false motive to his deed (perhaps by a robbery when what he wanted was blood).103

One should beware of assessing the value of a man according to a single deed. Napoleon warned against this. For our haut-relief deeds are quite especially insignificant. If men like us have no crime, e.g., murder, on our conscience-why is it? Because a few opportune circumstances were lacking. And if we did it, what would that indicate about our value? In a way one would despise us if one thought we had not the strength to kill a man under certain circumstances. In almost all crimes some qualities also find expression which ought not to be lacking in a man. It was not without justification that Dostoevsky said of the inmates of his Siberian prisons that they formed the strongest and most valuable

393 part of the Russian people.104 If with us the criminal is an ill nourished and stunted plant, this is to the dishonor of our social relationships; in the age of the Renaissance the criminal throve and acquired for himself his own kind of virtue-virtue in the Ren aissance style, to be sure, virtù, moraline-free virtue.

One can enhance only those men whom one does not treat with contempt; moral contempt causes greater indignity and harm than any crime.

741 (1883-1888) The derogatory element first entered into punishment when certain penalties became associated with contemptible men (e.g., slaves). Those punished most were contemptible men, and at length punishment came to contain something derogatory.

742 (March-June 1888) In ancient penal law a religious concept was at work: that of the expiatory power of punishment. Punishment purifies: in the modern world it sullies. Punishment is a payment: one is really rid of that for which one was willing to suffer so much. Provided there is a belief in this power of punishment, there follows a profound sense of relief which is really very close to a new health, à restora tion. One has not only made one's peace with society again, one has also regained one's self-respect and feels—"pure.”

Today punishment isolates even more than the crime; the fatality behind a crime has grown so great that it has grown in curable. One emerges from punishment as an enemy of society. From then on, it has one more enemy.

Jus talionis103 can be dictated by the spirit of retribution (i.e., by a kind of moderation of the instinct for revenge); but with Manu, e.g., it is the need to possess an equivalent in order to expiale, in order to be "free" again in a religious sense.

codes is this: if the punishment should hurt in proportion to the magnitude of the crime--and fundamentally that is what all of you want!you would have to measure the susceptibility to pain of every criminal. Does that not mean: a previously determined punishment for a crime, a penal code, ought not to exist at all? But considering that one would scarcely be able to determine a criminal's degrees of pleasure and displeasure, wouldn't one have to do without punishment in practice? What a loss! Isn't it?

Ah, the philosophy of right! A science that, like all moral science, has not even reached the cradle yet!

One still misunderstands, e.g., even among jurists who think themselves enlightened, the oldest and most valuable significance of punishment-one does not know it at all; and as long as juris prudence does not put itself on a new footing, namely on that of comparative history and anthropology, it will persist in the useless struggle between fundamentally false. abstractions that today pass for "philosophy of right" and that are all based on contemporary man. This contemporary man, however, is so intricate, also in his legal evaluations, that he permits the most varied interpretations,

Schopenhauer wanted rascals to be castrated and silly geese to be shut up in convents: from what point of view would this be desirable? The rascal has this advantage over many other men, that he is not mediocre; and the fool has this advantage over us, that he does not suffer at the sight of mediocrity.

It would be more desirable that the gulf should be made wider; so rascality and folly should increase. In this way human nature would be expanded— But, after all, this is dictated by ne cessity; it does not depend on whether we desire it or not. Folly, rascality increase: that is part of "progress."

747 (Spring-Fall 1887; rev. Spring-Fall 1888)

In contemporary society a great deal of consideration, of tact and forbearance, of good-natured respect for the rights of others, even for the claims of others, is quite widespread; even more, a certain benevolent instinctive estimation of human value in general, which finds expression in trustfulness and credit of all kinds. Re spect for man--and not merely for virtuous men—is perhaps what divides us most sharply from a Christian evaluation. It seems to us ironic to a degree when we still hear morals preached; a man lowers himself in our eyes and becomes comical if he preaches morals.

This moral liberality is one of the best signs of our age. When we discover cases in which it is noticeably lacking, this strikes us as a kind of sickness (the case of Carlyle in England, the case of Ibsen in Norway, the case of Schopenhauerian [?]100 pessimism [?] throughout Europe [?]). If anything can reconcile us to our age, it is the great amount of immorality it permits itself without thinking any the worse of itself. On the contrary! What constitutes the superiority of culture over unculture? of the Renais sance over the Middle Ages, for example?- One thing alone; the great amount of admitted immorality. From this it follows of necessity what all the heights of human evolution must represent to the eye of the moral fanatic: the non plus ultra of corruption (-consider Savonarola's judgment of Florence, Plato's judgment of Periclean Athens, Luther's[?] judgment[?] of Rome, Rous seau's judgment of Voltaire's society, the German judgment contra Goethe).

748 (Nov. 1887-March 1888) A little fresh air! This absurd condition of Europe shall not go on much longer! Is there any idea at all behind this bovine nationalism? What value can there be now, when everything points to wider and more common interests, in encouraging this boorish self-conceit? And this in a state of affairs in which spiritual de pendency and disnationalization meet the eye and in which the value and meaning of contemporary culture lie in mutual blend ing and fertilization. And the "new Reich" again founded on

The princes of Europe should consider carefully whether they can do without our support. We immoralists-we are today the only power that needs no allies in order to conquer: thus we are by far the strongest of the strong. We do not even need to tell lies: what other power can dispense with that? A powerful seduc tion fights on our behalf, the most powerful perhaps that there has ever been the seduction of truth-"Truth”? Who has forced this word on me? But I repudiate it; but I disdain this proud word: no, we do not need even this; we shall conquer and come to power even without truth. The spell that fights on our behalf, the eye of Venus that charms and blinds even our opponents, is the magic of the extreme, the seduction that everything extreme exercises: we immoralists-we are the most extreme.

The rotted ruling classes have ruined the image of the ruler. The "state" as a court of law is a piece of cowardice, because the great human being is lacking to provide a standard of measure ment.

751 (March-June 1888)

"The will to power" is so hated in democratic ages that their entire psychology seems directed toward belittling and defaming it. The type of the great ambitious man who thirsts after honor is supposed to be Napoleon! And Caesar! And Alexander! As if these were not precisely the great despisers of honor!

And Helvétius demonstrates to us that men strive after power so as to possess the enjoyments available to the powerful: he understands this striving for power as will to enjoyment! as hedon ism!

752 (1884) According to whether a people feels "right, vision, the gift of leadership, etc., belong to the few" or "to the many"--there will be an oligarchic or a democratic government.

Monarchy represents the belief in one man who is utterly superior, a leader, savior, demigod.

Aristocracy represents the belief in an elite humanity and higher caste.

Democracy represents the disbelief in great human beings and an elite society: "Everyone is equal to everyone else." "At bottom we are one and all self-seeking cattle and mob."

I am opposed to 1. socialism, because it dreams quite naively of the good, true, and beautiful" and of "equal rights" (anarch ism also desires the same ideal, but in a more brutal fashion);

And the party opposed to them is just as ludicrous, because it does not admit the element of violence in the law, the severity and egoism in every kind of authority. “ 'I and my kind' want to rule and survive; whoever degenerates will be expelled or de stroyed" this is the basic feeling behind every ancient legislation,

The workers shall live one day as the bourgeois do now-but above them, distinguished by their freedom from wants, the higher caste: that is to say, poorer and simpler, but in possession of power.

For lower men the reverse valuation obtains; it is a question of implanting "virtues" in them. Absolute commands; terrible means of compulsion; to tear them away from the easy life. The others may obey; and their vanity demands that they appear to be dependent, not on great men, but on "principles."

765 (Jan-Fall 1888)

"Redemption from all guilt"

One speaks of the "profound injustice" of the social pact; as if the fact that this man is born in favorable circumstances, that in unfavorable ones, were in itself an injustice; or even that it is unjust that this man should be born with these qualities, that man with those. Among the most honest of these opponents of society it is asserted: "we ourselves, with all our bad, sick, crim inal qualities, which we admit to, are only the inescapable con sequences of a long suppression of the weak by the strong"; they make the ruling classes responsible for their characters. And they threaten, they rage, they curse; they become virtuous from indig nation—they do not want to have become bad men, canaille, for nothing.

This pose, an invention of the last few decades, is also called pessimism, as I hear; the pessimism of indignation. Here the claim is made to judge history, to divest it of its fatality, to discover responsibility behind it, guilty men in it. For this is the rub: one needs guilty men. The underprivileged, the decadents of all kinds are in revolt on account of themselves and need victims so as not to quench their thirst for destruction by destroying themselves (which would perhaps be reasonable). To this end, they need an appearance of justice, i.e., a theory through which they can shift the responsibility for their existence, for their being thus and thus, on to some sort of scapegoat. This scapegoat can be God in Russia there is no lack of such atheists from ressentiment or the social order, or education and training, or the Jews, or the nobility, or those who have turned out well in any way. “It is a crime to be born in favorable circumstances; for thus one has disinherited the others, pushed them aside, condemned them to vice, even to workHow can I help it that I am wretched! But some body must be responsible, otherwise it would be unberable!"

In short, the pessimism of indignation invents responsibility in order to create a pleasant feeling for itself-revenge--"Sweeter than honey" old Homer called it.

That such a theory is no longer rightly understood, that is to say despised, is a consequence of the bit of Christianity that we

BOOK THREE: Principles of A New Evaluation

401

all still have in our blood; so we are tolerant toward things merely because they smell somewhat Christian from a distance- The socialists appeal to the Christian instincts, that is their most subtle piece of shrewdness.

Christianity has accustomed us to the superstitious concept of the soul," the "immortal soul," soul-monads that really are at home somewhere else and have only by chance fallen, as it were into this or that condition, into the "earthly" and become "flesh"; but their essence is not held to be affected, to say nothing of being conditioned, by all this. Social, family, historical circumstances are for the soul only incidental, perhaps embarrassments; in any event, it is not produced by them. With this idea, the individual is made transcendent; as a result, he can attribute a senseless importance to himself.....

. In fact, it was Christianity that first invited the individual to play the judge of everything and everyone; megalomania almost became a duty: one has to enforce eternal rights against everything temporal and conditioned! What of the state! What of society! What of historical laws! What of physiology! What speaks here is some thing beyond becoming, something unchanging throughout history, somethiog immortal, something divine: a soul!

Another Christian concept, no less crazy, has passed even more deeply into the tissue of modernity: the concept of the "equality of souls before God." This concept furnishes the proto type of all theories of equal rights: mankind was first taught to stammer the proposition of equality in a religious context, and only later was it made into morality: no wonder that man ended by taking it seriously, taking it practically!—that is to say, politi cally, democratically, socialistically, in the spirit of the pessimism of indignation.

Wherever responsibilities have been sought it was the instinct of revenge that sought. This instinct of revenge has so mastered mankind in the course of millennia that the whole of metaphysics, psychology, conception of history, but above all morality, is im pregnated with it. As far as man has thought, he has introduced the bacillus of revenge into things. He has made even God ill with it, he has deprived existence in general of its innocence; namely, by tracing back every state of being thus and thus to a will, an intention, a responsible act. The entire doctrine of the will, this

402

THE WILL TO POWER

most fateful falsification in psychology hitherto, was essentially invented for the sake of punishment. It was the social utility of punishment that guaranteed this concept its dignity, its power, its truth. The originators of this psychology--the psychology of will -are to be sought in the classes that administered the penal law, above all among the priests at the head of the oldest communality: they wanted to create for themselves a right to take revenge--they wanted to create a right for God to take revenge. To this end, man was conceived of as "free"; to this end, every action had to be conceived of as willed, the origin of every action as conscious. But these sentences refute the old psychology. 111

Today, when Europe seems to have entered upon the opposite course, when we halcyonians especially are trying with all our might to withdraw, banish, and extinguish the concepts of guilt and punishment from the world, when our most serious endeavor is to purify psychology, morality, history, nature, social institutions and sanctions, and even God of this filth-whom must we recognize as our most natural antagonists? Precisely those apostles of revenge and ressentiment, those pessimists from indignation par excellence, who make it their mission to sanctify their filth under the name of "indignation."

We others, who desire to restore innocence to becoming, would like to be the missionaries of a cleaner idea: that no one has given man his qualities, neither God, nor society, nor his parents and ancestors, nor he himself that no one is to blame for him.

There is no being that could be held responsible for the fact that anyone exists at all, that anyone is thus and thus, that anyone was born in certain circumstances, in a certain environment. It is a tremendous restorative that such a being is lacking.

We are not the result of an eternal intention, a will, a wish: we are not the product of an attempt to achieve an "ideal of per fection" or an "ideal of happiness" or an "ideal of virtue"-any more than we are a blunder on the part of God that must frighten even him (an idea with which, as is well known, the Old Testament begins). There is no place, no purpose, no meaning, on which we can shift the responsibility for our being, for our being thus and thus. Above all: no one could do it; one cannot judge, measure, compare the whole, to say nothing of denying it! Why not?— For

And, to say it again, this is a tremendous restorative; this constitutes the innocence of all existence.112

2. The Individual

766 (1886-1887)

Basic error: to place the goal in the herd and not in single individuals! The herd is a means, no more! But now one is at tempting to understand the herd as an individual and to ascribe to it a higher rank than to the individual-profound misunder standing! ! ! Also to characterize that which makes herdlike, sympathy, as the more valuable side of our nature!

767 (1883-1888) The individual is something quite new which creates new things, something absolute; all his acts are entirely his own.

Ultimately, the individual derives the values of his acts from himself; because he has to interpret in a quite individual way even the words he has inherited. His interpretation of a formula at least is personal, even if he does not create a formula: as an interpreter he is still creative.

768 (1882)

The "ego" subdues and kills: it operates like an organic cell: it is a robber and violent. It wants to regenerate itself-pregnancy. It wants to give birth to its god and see all mankind at his feet.

But section 765 was utilized in Twilight, "The Four Great Errors," sections 7-8 (Portable Nietzsche, pp. 499-501).

404

THE WILL TO POWER as it can, and overwhelms what is weaker: thus it takes pleasure in itself. The increasing "humanizing" of this tendency consists in this, that there is an ever subtier sense of how hard it is really to incorporate another: while a crude injury done bim certainly demonstrates our power over him, it at the same time estranges his will from us even more and thus makes him less easy to subjugate.

770 (Jan-Fall 1888)

The degreee of resistance that must be continually overcome in order to remain on top is the measure of freedom, whether for individuals or for societies--freedom understood, that is, as posi tive power, as will to power. According to this concept, the highest form of individual freedom, of sovereignty, would in all probability emerge not five steps from its opposite, 119 where the danger of slavery hangs over existence like a hundred swords of Damocles. Look at history from this viewpoint: the ages in which the "indi vidual" achieves such ripe perfection, i.e., freedom, and the classic type of the sovereign man is attained oh no! they have never been humane ages!

One must have no choice: either on top or underneath, like a worm, mocked, annihilated, trodden upon. One must oppose tyrants to become a tyrant, i.e., free. It is no small advantage to live under a hundred swords of Damocles: that way one learns to dance, one attains "freedom of movement."

Morphology of self-esteem First viewpoint: to what extent feelings of sympathy and community are the lower, preparatory stage at a time when personal self-esteem and individual initiative in evaluation are not yet possible.

Second viewpoint: to what extent the height of collective self esteem, pride in the distinction of the clan, the feeling of inequality, the aversion to mediation, equality of rights, reconciliation, is a school for individual self-reliance; that is, in so far as it compels the individual to represent the pride of the whole: he has to speak and act with extreme respect for himself in so far as he represents the community in his own person, Also when the individual feels like the instrument and mouthpiece of the deity.

Third viewpoint: to what extent these forms of depersonaliza tion in fact give the person a tremendous importance, in so far as higher powers employ him; religious awe before oneself the condition of the prophet and poet.

Fourth viewpoint: to what extent responsibility for the whole trains the individual to, and permits him, a broad view, a stern and terrible hand, a circumspection and coolness, a grandeur of bear

In summa: collective self-esteem is the great preparatory school for personal sovereignty. The noble class is that which inherits this training.

The disguised forms of the will to power::

1. Desire for freedom, independence, also for equilibrium, peace, co-ordination. Also the hermit, "spiritual freedom." In the lowest form: will to exist at all, "the drive to self-preservation."

2. Enrollment, so as to satisfy the will to power in a larger whole: submission, making oneself indispensable and useful to those in power; love, as a secret path to the heart of the more powerful so as to dominate him.

3. The sense of duty, conscience, the imaginary consolation of outranking those who actually possess power; the recognition of an order of rank that permits judgment even of the more power ful; self-condemnation; the invention of new tables of value (Jews: classical example),

Praise and grati tude on the occasions of harvest, good weather, victory, marriage, peace:—all these festivals require a subject upon which the feeling can be discharged. One desires that all good things that happen to one should have been done to one: one desires a doer. The same applies to works of art: one is not satisfied with them alone: one praises the doer.

What, then is praise? A sort of restoration of balance in respect of benefits received, a giving in return, a demonstration of our power—for those who praise affirm, judge, evaluate, pass sentence: they claim the right of being able to affirm, of being able to dispense honors. A heightened feeling of happiness and life is also a heightened feeling of power: it is from this that man

The WILL TO POWER

778 (March-June 1888)

"Senses," "passions." - Fear of the senses, of the desires, of the passions, when it goes so far as to counsel us against them, is already a symptom of weakness: extreme measures always in dicate abnormal conditions. What is lacking, or crumbling, here is the strength to restrain an impulse: if one's instinct is to have to succumb, i.e., to have to react, then one does well to avoid the opportunities ("seductions") for it.

A "stimulation of the senses" is a seduction only for those whose system is too easily moved and influenced: in the opposite case, that of a system of great slowness and severity, strong stimuli are needed to set the functions going.

Excess is a reproach only against those who have no right to it; and almost all the passions have been brought into ill repute on account of those who were not sufficiently strong to employ them

One must understand that the same objections can be made to the passions as are made to sickness: nonetheless we cannot do without sickness, and even less without the passions. We need the abnormal, we give life a tremendous choc by these great sick nesses.

In detail, the following must be distinguished:

1. the dominating passion, which even brings with it the supremest form of health; here the co-ordination of the inner systems and their operation in the service of one end is best achieved—but this is almost the definition of health!

2. the antagonism of the passions; two, three, a multiplicity of "souls in one breast":117 very unhealthy, inner ruin, disinte gration, betraying and increasing and inner conflict and anarchism --unless one passion at last becomes master. Return to health

3. juxtaposition without antagonism or collaboration: often periodic, and then, as soon as an order has been established, also healthy. The most interesting men, the chameleons, belong here; they are not in contradiction with themselves, they are happy and secure, but they do not develop their differing states lie jux taposed, even if they are separated sevenfold. They change, they do not become.

781 (Spring-Fall 1887) Preoccupation with itself and its "eternal salvation" is not the expression of a rich and self-confident type; for that type does not give a damn about its salvation-it has no such interest in happiness of any kind; it is force, deed, desire-it imposes itself upon things, it lays violent hands on things. Christianity is a ro mantic hypochondria of those whose legs are shaky.

Wherever the hedonistic perspective comes into the fore ground one may infer suffering and a type that represents a failure.

782 (Nov. 1887-March 1888)

The "growing autonomy of the individual”; these Parisian philosophers such as Fouillée speak of this, they ought to take a look at the race moutonnière118 to which they belong! Open your eyes, you sociologists of the future! The individual has grown strong under opposite conditions; what you describe is the most extreme weakening and impoverishment of mankind; you even de sire it and employ to that end the whole mendacious apparatus of the old ideal! you are so constituted that you actually regard your herd-animal needs as an ideal!

A complete lack of psychological integrity!

783 (1885)

The modern European is characterized by two apparently opposite traits: individualism and the demand for cqual rights; that I have at last come to understand. For the individual is an extremely vulnerable piece of vanity: conscious of how easily it suffers, this vanity demands that every other shall count as its equal, that it should be only inter pares. In this way a social race is characterized in which talents and powers do not diverge very much. The pride that desires solitude and few admirers is quite beyond comprehension; a really "great" success is possible only through the masses, indeed one hardly grasps the fact any more

118 Race of sheep. Alfred Fouillée (1838-1912) wrote books on Plato (1869) and Socrates (1874), a history of philosophy (1875), a critique of contemporary moral systems (1883), a work on democracy (1884), and, in addition to many other books, "Nietzsche et l'immoralisme" (Nietzsche and Immoralism, 1903).

BOOK THREE; Principles of A New Evaluation

411

that a success with the masses is always really a petty success: be cause pulchrum est paucorum hominum.119

All moralities know nothing of an "order of rank" among men; teachers of law nothing of a communal conscience. The prin ciple of the individual rejects very great human beings and de mands, among men approximately equal, the subtlest eye and the specdiest recognition of a talent; and because everyone has some kind of talent in such late and civilized cultures and therefore can expect to receive back his share of honor--there is more flat tering of modest merits today than ever before: it gives the age a veneer of boundless fairness. Its unfairness consists in a boundless rage, not against tyrants and public flatterers even in the arts, but against noble men, who despise the praise of the many. The demand for equal rights (i.e., to be allowed to sit in judgment on every thing and everyone) is anti-aristocratic,

Equally strange to the age is the vanished individual, the absorption in a great type, the desire not to be a personality which constituted the distinction and ambition of many lofty men in earlier days (the greatest poets among them); or "to be a city" as in Greece; Jesuitism, Prussian officer corps and bureaucracy; or to be a pupil and continuator of great masters for which non social conditions and a lack of petty vanity are needed.

784 (Spring-Fall 1887; rev, Spring-Fall 1888)

Individualism is a modest and still unconscious form of the "will to power"; here it seems sufficient to the individual to get free from an overpowering domination by society (whether that of the state or of the church). He does not oppose them as a person but only as an individual; he represents all individuals against the totality. That means: he instinctively posits himself as equal to all other individuals; what he gains in this struggle he gains for himself not as a person but as a representative of indi viduals against the totality.

Socialism is merely a means of agitation employed by indi vidualism: it grasps that, to attain anything, one must organize one self to a collective action, to a "power." But what it desires is not a social order as the goal of the individual but a social order as a means for making possible many individuals: this is the instinct of socialists about which they frequently deceive themselves (-apart

THE WILL TO POWER

from the fact that, in order to prevail, they frequently have to deceive themselves). The preaching of altruistic morality in the service of individual egoism: one of the most common lies of the nineteenth century.

Anarchism, too, is merely a means of agitation employed by socialism; by means of it, socialism arouses fear, by means of fear it begins to fascinate and to terrorize: above all-it draws the courageous, the daring to its side, even in the most spiritual matters.

All this notwithstanding: individualism is the most modest stage of the will to power.

Once one has achieved a certain degree of independence, one wants more: people arrange themselves according to their degree of force: the individual no longer simply supposes himself the equal of others, he seeks his equals-he distinguishes himself from others. Individualism is followed by the formation of groups and organs; related tendencies join together and become active as a power; between these centers of power friction, war, recognition of one another's forces, reciprocation, approaches, regulation of an exchange of services. Finally, an order of rank.

N.B.:120 1. Individuals liberate themselves; 2. they enter into struggle with one another, they come to an agreement over "equality of rights" ("justice" as an aim-); 3. Once this is achieved, the actual inequalities of force pro duce an enhanced effect (because peace rules on the whole and many small quanta of force now constitute differences that formerly did not count). Now individuals organize them selves in groups; the groups struggle for privileges and pre dominance. Strife breaks out again in a milder form.

One desires freedom so long as one does not possess power. Once one does possess it, one desires to overpower; if one can not do that (if one is still too weak to do so), one desires "justice," i.e., equal power.

785 (Spring-Fall 1887)

Correction of the concept "egoism."- When one has grasped to what extent the concept "individual" is an error because every

single creature constitutes the entire process in its entire course (not merely as "inherited," but the process itself-), then the single creature acquires a tremendously great significance. Instinct speaks quite correctly here. Where this instinct weakens—where the individual seeks a value for himself only in the service of others, one can be certain that exhaustion and degeneration are present. An altruistic disposition, genuine and without tartuffery, is an instinct for creating at least a secondary value for oneself in the service of other egoisms. Usually, however, altruism is only appar ent; a detour to the preservation of one's own feeling of vitality and value.

786 (Spring-Fall 1887) History of Moralization and Dismoralization First proposition: There are no moral actions whatsoever: they are completely imaginary. Not only are they indemonstrable (which Kant, e.g., admitted, and Christianity as well)--they are altogether impossible. Through a psychological misunderstanding, one has invented an antithesis to the motivating forces, and be lieves one bas described another kind of force; one has imagined a primum mobile that does not exist at all. According to the valua tion that evolved the antithesis "moral" and "immoral" in general, one has to say: there are only immoral intentions and actions.

Second proposition: This entire distinction "moral" and "im moral" proceeds from the idea that moral as well as immoral actions are acts arising from free spontaneity in short, that such a spon taneity exists, or in other words: that moral judgments in general relate only to one species of intentions and actions, those that are free. But this whole species of intentions and actions is purely imaginary; the world to which alone the moral standard can be applied does not exist at all: there are neither moral nor im moral actions.

The psychological error out of which the antithetical concepts "moral" and "immoral" arose is: "selfless," "unegoistic," "self denying"-all unreal, imaginary.

False dogmatism regarding the "ego": it is taken in an atom istic sense, in a false antithesis to the "non-ego"; at the same time, pried out of becoming, as something that is a being. The false sub

414

THE WILL TO POWER

stantialization of the ego: (in the faith in individual immortality) this is made into an article of faith, especially under the influence of religio-moral training. After this artificial separation of the ego, and the declaration that it exists in and for itself, one confronted a value antithesis that seemed irrefutable: the single ego and the tremendous non-ego. It seemed evident that the value of the single ego could lie only in relating itself to the tremendous "non-ego" being subject to it and existing for its sake. Here the herd in stincts were decisive: nothing is so contrary to this instinct as the sovereignty of the individual. But if the ego is conceived as some thing in and for itself, then its value must lie in self-negation.

Thus: 1. the false autonomy of the "individual," as atom;

2. the herd valuation, which abhors the desire to remain an atom and regards it as hostile;

3, as a result: the individual overcome by moving his goal;

4. now there seemed to be actions that were self-negating: one wove a whole sphere of fantastic antitheses about them;

5. one asked: in what actions does man affirm himself most strongly? Around these (sexuality, avarice, lust to rule, cruelty, etc.) prohibition, hatred, and contempt were heaped: one believed there were unselfish drives, one condemned all the selfish ones, one demanded the unselfish;

6. as a result: what had one done? One had placed a prohibi tion upon all the strongest, most natural, indeed the only real drives

henceforth, in order to find an action praiseworthy, one had to deny the presence in it of such drives--tremendous falsification in psychologicis. Even any kind of "self-satisfaction" had first to be made possible by misunderstanding and construing oneself sub specie boni. Conversely: that species that derived its advantage from depriving man of his self-satisfaction (the representatives of the herd instinct; e.g., the priests and philosophers) became subtle and psychologically astute, so as to deinonstrate how nonetheless selfishness ruled everywhere. Christian conclusion: "Everything is sin; even our virtues. Absolute reprehensibility of man. The unselfish action is not possible.” Original sin. In short: once man had made of his instincts an antithesis to a purely imaginary world of the good, he ended by despising himself as incapable of per forming actions that were "good."

N.B. Christianity thus demonstrates an advance in the sharpen ing of psychological insight: La Rochefoucauld and Pascal, It

Now one seriously set about the task of forming men in whom selfishness was dead:-priests, saints. And if one doubted the possibility of becoming "perfect," one did not doubt that one knew what is perfect.

The psychology of the saint, the priest, the "good man" naturally had to be purely phantasmagorical. One had declared the real motives of actions bad: in order still to be able to act at all, to prescribe actions, one had to describe as possible and as it were sanctify actions that are utterly impossible. With the falseness of one's former slanders, one now honored and idealized.

Rage against the instincts of life as "holy," as venerable. Absolute chastity, absolute obedience, absolute poverty: the priestly ideal, Alms, pity, sacrifice,121 denial of beauty, of reason, of sen suality, a morose eye cast on all strong qualities one possessed: the lay ideal.

One advances: the slandered instincts, too, try to create a right for themselves (e.g., Luther's Reformation: coarsest form of moral mendaciousness under the guise of "evangelical freedom") -one rebaptized them with holy names;

the slandered instincts try to prove themselves necessary for the existence of the virtuous instincts; one must vivre, pour vivre pour autrui: 122 egoism as means to an end;

one goes further, one tries to grant both the egoistic and the altruistic impulses a right to exist: equal rights for the one as for the other (from the standpoint of utility);

one goes further, one seeks a higher utility in a preference of the egoistic viewpoint over the altruistic: more useful in relation to the happiness of the majority or the progress of mankind, etc. Thus: a preponderance of the rights of egoism, but under the per spective of extreme altruism ("collective utility for mankind");

one tries to reconcile the altruistic mode of action with natural ness, one seeks altruism in the foundations of life; one seeks egoism

131 Followed by an undeciphered word. 122 Live to live for others.416

THE WILL TO POWER

and altruism as equally founded in the essence of life and nature;

one dreams of a disappearance of the antithesis in some future, when, owing to continual adaptation, egoism will at the same time be altruism;

finally, one grasps that altruistic actions are only a species of egoistic actions and that the degree to which one loves, spends oneself, proves the degree of individual power and personality. In short, that when one makes men more evil, one makes them better and that one cannot be one without being the other-At this point the curtain rises on the dreadful forgery of the psychol ogy of man hitherto.

Consequences: there are only immoral intentions and actions; ---the so-called moral ones must be shown to be immoral.123 The derivation of all affects from the one will to power: the same essence. The concept of life:-in the apparent antithesis of "good" and "evil") degrees of power in instinct express them selves, temporary orders of rank under which certain instincts are held in check or taken into service.--- Justification of morality: economical, etc.

Against the second propostion. Determinism: attempt to rescue the moral world by transporting it into the unknown. Determinism is only a modus of permitting ourselves to juggle our evaluations away once they have no place in a mechanistically conceived world. One must therefore attack determinism and undermine it: and also dispute our right to a distinction between a world in itself and a phenomenal world.

To restore a good conscience to the evil man has this been my unconscious endeavor? I mean, to the evil man in so far as he is the strong man? (Dostoevsky's judgment on the criminals in prison should be cited here.)

Our new "freedom."- What a feeling of freedom there is in feeling as we freed spirits do, that we are not harnessed to any system of "purposes"! Likewise, that the concepts "reward" and "punishment" do not reside in the essence of things! Likewise, that the good and the evil action caonot be called good and evil in themselves, but only in the perspective of what tends to preserve certain types of human communities! Likewise, that our assess ments of pleasure and pain have no cosmic, let alone a meta physical, significance! (that pessimism, the pessimism of Herr von Hartmann, who claims to put the pleasure and displeasure of existence itself on the scales, with his arbitrary incarceration in the pre-Copernican prison and field of vision, would be something retarded and regressive unless it is merely a bad joke of a Berliner.)

790 (Nov, 1887-March 1888)

Once one is clear about the "why?" of one's life, one can let its How? take care of itself. It is itself a sign of disbelief in a Why, in purpose and meaning, a sign of a lack of will, if the value of pleasure and displeasure step into the foreground and hedonistic pessimistic theories get a hearing; and renunciation, resignation, virtue, and "objectivity" may at least be a sign that what matters most is beginning to be defective.

791 (1885)

Up to now there has not yet been any German culture. It is no objection to this statement that there have been great hermits in Germany (e.g., Goethe); for these had their own culture. But like mighty, defiant, solitary rocks, they were surrounded by

the rest of what was German as by their antithesis a soft, marshy, insecure ground upon which every step from other countries made an "impression" and created a "form": German culture was a thing without character, an almost limitless compliance.

792 (1885)

Germany, rich in clever and well-informed scholars, has lacked great souls, mighty spirits, to such an extent and for so long that it seems to have forgotten what a great soul, a mighty spirit, is; and today mediocre and quite ill-constituted men place themselves in the market square almost with a good conscience and without any embarrassment and praise themselves as great men and reformers, as, e.g., Eugen Dühring does--indeed a clever and well-informed scholar, but one who nevertheless betrays with almost every word he says that he harbors a petty soul and is tormented by narrow, envious feelings; also that what drives him is not a mighty, overflowing, benevolent, spendthrift spirit—but ambition! But to lust after honors in this age is even more unworthy of a philosopher than it was in any previous age: today, when the mob rules, when the mob bestows the honors!

THE WILL TO POWER which art appears in man like a force of nature and disposes of him whether he will or no: as the compulsion to have visions and as a compulsion to an orgiastic state. Both conditions are rehearsed in ordinary life, too, but weaker: in dream and in intoxication.

But the same antithesis obtains between dream and intoxica tion: both release artistic powers in us, but different ones: the dream those of vision, association, poetry; intoxication those of gesture, passion, song, dance.

799 (March-June 1888)

In the Dionysian intoxication there is sexuality and volup tuousness: they are not lacking in the Apollinian. There must also be a difference in tempo in the two conditions-- The extreme calm in certain sensations of intoxication (more strictly: the retardation of the feelings of time and space) likes to be reflected in a vision of the calmest gestures and types of soul. The classical style is essentially a representation of this calm, simplification, abbreviation, concentration the highest feeling of power is con centrated in the classical type. To react slowly; a great con sciousness; no feeling of struggle.

800 (March-June 1888)

The feeling of intoxication, in fact corresponding to an in crease in strength; strongest in the mating season: new orgáns, new accomplishments, colors, forms; "becoming more beautiful" is a consequence of enhanced strength.127 Becoming more beautiful as the expression of a victorious will, of increased co-ordination, of a harmonizing of all the strong desires, of an infallibly per pendicular stress, Logical and geometrical simplification is a consequence of enhancement of strength; conversely the apprehen sion of such a simplification again enhances the feeling of strength-High point of the development: the grand style.

Ugliness signifies the decadence of a type, contradiction and lack of co-ordination among the inner desires_signifies a decline in organizing strength, in "will," to speak psychologically.

The condition of pleasure called intoxication is precisely an

exalted feeling of power— The sensations of space and time are altered: tremendous distances are surveyed and, as it were, for the first time apprehended; the extension of vision over greater masses and expanses; the refinement of the organs for the apprehension of much that is extremely small and fleeting; divination, the power of understanding with only the least assistance, at the slightest suggestion; "intelligent" sensuality strength as a feeling of dominion in the muscles, as suppleness and pleasure in movement, as dance, as levity and presto, strength as pleasure in the proof of strength, as bravado, adventure, fearlessness, indifference to life or death— All these climactic moments of life mutually stimulate one another; the world of images and ideas of the one suffices as a suggestion for the others: in this way, states finally merge into one another though they might perhaps have good reason to remain apart. For example: the feeling of religious intoxication and sexual excitation (two profound feelings, co-ordinated to an almost amazing degree. What pleases all pious women, old or young? Answer: a saint with beautiful legs, still young, still an idiot). Cruelty in tragedy and sympathy ( also normally co ordinated-) Spring, dance, music all competitions between the sexes-and even that Faustian "infinity in the breast."

Artists, if they are any good, are (physically as well) strong, full of surplus energy, powerful animals, sensual; without a certain overheating of the sexual system a Raphael is unthinkable Making music is another way of making children; chastity is merely the economy of an artist and in any event, even with artists fruitfulness ceases when potency ceases Artists should see nothing as it is, but fuller, simpler, stronger: to that end, their lives must contain a kind of youth and spring, a kind of habitual intoxication.

801 (Spring-Fall 1887; rev. Spring-Fall 1888)

The states in which we infuse a transfiguration and fullness into things and poetize about them until they reflect back our fullness and joy in life: sexuality; intoxication; feasting; spring; victory over an enemy, mockery; bravado; cruelty; the ecstacy of religious feeling. Three elements principally: sexuality, intoxica tion, cruelty-all belonging to the oldest festal joys of mankind, all also preponderate in the early "artist."

Conversely, when we encounter things that display this trans

422

THE WILL TO POWER

figuration and fullness, the animal responds with an excitation of those spheres in which all those pleasurable states are situated and a blending of these very delicate nuances of animal well being and desires constitutes the aesthetic state. The latter appears only in natures capable of that bestowing and overflowing fullness of bodily vigor; it is this that is always the primum mobile. The sober, the weary, the exhausted, the dried-up (e.g., scholars) can receive absolutely nothing from art, because they do not possess the primary artistic force, the pressure of abundance: whoever can not give, also receives nothing.

"Perfection": in these states in the case of sexual love especially) there is naively revealed what the deepest instinct recognizes as higher, more desirable, more valuable in gen eral, the upward movement of its type; also toward what status it really aspires. Perfection; that is the extraordinary expansion of its feeling of power, riches, necessary overflowing of all limits.

802 (Spring-Fall 1887)

Art reminds us of states of animal vigor; it is on the one hand an excess and overflow of blooming physicality into the world of images and desires; on the other, an excitation of the animal functions through the images and desires of intensified life;

an enhancement of the feeling of life, a stimulant to it.

How can even ugliness possess this power? In so far as it still communicates something of the artist's victorious energy which has become master of this ugliness and awfulness; or in so far as it mildly excites in us the pleasure of cruelty (under certain con Jitions even a desire to harm ourselves, self-violation--and thus the feeling of power over ourselves).

803 (1883-1888)

"Beauty" is for the artist something outside all orders of rank, because in beauty opposites are tamed; the highest sign of power, namely power over opposites, moreover, without tension; --that violence is no longer needed; that everything follows, obeys, so easily and so pleasantly--that is what delights the artist's will to power.

BOOK THREE: Principles of A New Evaluation

804 (Spring-Fall 1887)

Origin of the beautiful and ugly. 128_Biological value of the beautiful and the ugly.-- That which is instinctively repugnant to us, aesthetically, is proved by mankind's longest experience to be harmful, dangerous, worthy of suspicion: the suddenly vocal aesthetic instinct (e.g., in disgust) contains a judgment. To this extent the beautiful stands within the general category of the biological values of what is useful, beneficent, life-enhancing-but in such a way that a host of stimuli that are only distantly associated with, and remind us only faintly of, useful things and states give us the feeling of the beautiful, i.e., of the increase of the feeling of power (not merely things, therefore, but also the sensations that accompany such things, or symbols of them).

Thus the beautiful and the ugly are recognized as relative to our most fundamental values of preservation. It is senseless to want to posit anything as beautiful or ugly apart from this. The beautiful exists just as little as does the good, or the true. In every case it is a question of the conditions of preservation of a certain type of man: thus the herd man will experience the value feeling of the beautiful in the presence of different things than will the exceptional or over-man.

It is the perspective of the foreground, which concerns itself only with immediate consequences, from which the value of the beautiful (also of the good, also of the true) arises.

All instinctive judgments are shortsighted in regard to the chain of consequences: they advise what is to be done immediately. The understanding is essentially a brake upon immediate reactions on the basis of instinctive judgments: it retards, it considers, it looks further along the chain of consequences.

Judgments concerning beauty and ugliness are shortsighted (they are always opposed by the understanding.-) but per suasive in the highest degree; they appeal to our instincts where they decide most quickly and pronounce their Yes and No before the understanding can speak,

The most habitual affirmations of beauty excite and stimulate each other; once the aesthetic drive is at work, a whole host of other perfections, originating elsewhere, crystallize around "the

particular instance of beauty." It is not possible to remain objective, or to suspend the interpretive, additive, interpolating, poetizing power (-the latter is the forging of the chain of affirmations of beauty). The sight of a "beautiful woman"

Thus 1. the judgment of beauty is shortsighted, it sees only the immediate consequences;

2. it lavishes upon the object that inspires it a magic con ditioned by the association of various beauty judgments that are quite alien to the nature of that object. To experience a thing as beautiful means: to experience it necessarily wrongly—(which, incidentally, is why marriage for love is, from the point of view of society, the most unreasonable kind of marriage).

805 (1883-1888) On the genesis of art. That making perfect, seeing as per fect, which characterizes the cerebral system bursting with sexual energy (evening with the beloved, the smallest chance occurrences transfigured, life a succession of sublime things, "the misfortune of the unfortunate lover worth more than anything else"): on the other hand, everything perfect and beautiful works as an un conscious reminder of that enamored condition and its way of seeing-every perfection, all the beauty of things, revives through contiguity128a this aphrodisiac bliss. (Physiologically: the creative instinct of the artist and the distribution of semen in his blood ) The demand for art and beauty is an indirect demand for the ecstasies of sexuality communicated to the brain. The world become perfect, through "love" -

806 (1883-1888)

Sensuality in its disguises: (1) as idealism ("Plato"), peculiar to youth, creating the same kind of concave image that the beloved in particuar assumes, imposing an encrustation, magnification, transfiguration, infinity upon everything—; (2) in the religion of love: "a handsome young man, a beautiful woman," somehow divine, a bridegroom, a bride of the soul; (3) in art, as the "embellishing" power: as man sees woman and, as it were, makes her a present of everything excellent, so the sensuality of the artist puts into one object everything else that he honors and

esteems-in this way he perfects an object ("idealizes" it). Woman, conscious of man's feelings concerning women, assists his efforts at idealization by adorning herself, walking beautifully, dancing, expressing delicate thoughts: in the same way, she practices modesty, reserve, distance--realizing instinctively that in this way the idealizing capacity of the man will grow. (Given the tremendous subtlety of woman's instinct, modesty remains by no means conscious hypocrisy: she divines that it is precisely an actual naive modesty that most seduces a man and impels him to overestimate her. Therefore woman is naive from the subtlety of her instinct, which advises her of the utility of innocence. A deliberate closing of one's eyes to oneself-Wherever dissembling produces a stronger effect when it is unconscious, it becomes unconscious.)

807 (Summer-Fall 1888)

What a tremendous amount can be accomplished by that intoxication which is called "love" but which is yet something other than love! But everyone has his own knowledge of this. The muscular strength of a girl increases as soon as a man comes into her vicinity; there are instruments to measure this. When the sexes are in yet closer contact, as, e.g., at dances and other social events, this strength is augmented to such a degree that real feats of strength are possible: in the end one scarcely believes one's own eyes or one's watch. In such cases, to be sure, we must reckon with the fact that dancing in itself, like every other swift movement, brings with it a kind of intoxication of the whole vascular, nervous, and muscular system. So one has to reckon with the combined effects of a twofold intoxication. And how wise it is at times to be a little tipsy!

. There are realities that one may never admit to oneself; after all, one is a woman; after all, one has a woman's pudeurs

Those young creatures dancing over there are obviously beyond all reality: they are dancing with nothing but palpable ideals; what is more, they even see ideals sitting around them: the mothers! Opportunity to quote Faust- They look incomparably better when they are a little tipsy like that, these pretty creatures-oh, how well they know that, too. They actually become amiable because they know it.

Finally, they are also inspired by their finery; their finery is426

their third intoxication: they believe in their tailors as they believe in their God and who would dissuade them from this faith? This faith makes blessed! And self-admiration is healthy! Self admiration protects against colds. Has a pretty woman who knew herself to be well dressed ever caught cold? Never! I am even assuming that she was barely dressed. 129

808 (March-June 1888)

Do you desire the most astonishing proof of how far the transfiguring power of intoxication can go?- "Love" is this proof: that which is called love in all the languages and silences of the world. In this case, intoxication has done with reality to such a degree that in the consciousness of the lover the cause of it is extinguished and something else seems to have taken its place-a vibration and glittering of all the magic mirrors of Circe

Here it makes no difference whether one is man or animal; even less whether one has spirit, goodness, integrity. If one is subtle, one is fooled subtly; if one is coarse, one is fooled coarsely; but love, and even the love of God, the saintly love of "redeemed souls," remains the same in its roots: a fever that has good reason to transfigure itself, an intoxication that does well to lie about itself And in any case, one lies well when one loves, about oneself and to oneself: one seems to oneself transfigured, stronger, richer, more perfect, one is more perfect Here we discover art as an organic function: we discover it in the most angelic instinct, "love"; we discover it as the greatest stimulus of life.mart thus sublimely expedient even when it lies---

But we should do wrong if we stopped with its power to lie: it does more than merely imagine; it even transposes values. And it is not only that it transposes the feeling of values: the lover is more valuable, is stronger. In animals this condition produces new weapons, pigments, colors, and forms; above all, new move ments, new rhythms, new love calls and seductions. It is no different with man. His whole economy is richer than before,

427 more powerful, more complete than in those who do not love. The lover becomes a squanderer: he is rich enough for it. Now he dares, becomes an adventurer, becomes an ass in magnanimity and innocence; he believes in God again, he believes in virtue, because he believes in love; and on the other hand, this happy idiot grows wings and new capabilities, and even the door of art is opened to him. If we subtracted all traces of this intestinal fever from lyricism in sound and word, what would be left of lyrical poetry and music? - L'art pour l'art perhaps: the virtuoso croaking of shivering frogs, despairing in their swamp- All the rest was created by love.

809 (March-June 1888)

All art exercises the power of suggestion over the muscles and senses, which in the artistic temperament are originally active: it always speaks only to artists-it speaks to this kind of a subtle flexibility of the body. The concept "layman" is an error. The deaf man is not a species of the man with good hearing.

All art works tonically, increases strength, inflames desire (i.c., the feeling of strength), excites all the more subtle recollec tions of intoxication--there is a special memory that penetrates such states: a distant and transitory world of sensations here comes back.

The ugly, i.e., the contradiction to art, that which is excluded from art, its No-every time decline, impoverishment of life, impotence, disintegration, degeneration are suggested even faintly, the aesthetic man reacts with his No. The effect of the ugly is depressing; it is the expression of a depression. It takes away strength, it impoverishes, it weighs down

The ugly suggests ugly things; one can use one's states of health to test how variously an indisposition increases the capacity for imagining ugly things. The selection of things, interests, and questions changes. A state closely related to the ugly is encountered in logic, too: heaviness, dimness. Mechanically speaking, equilib rium is lacking: the ugly limps, the ugly stumbles: antithesis to the divine frivolity of the dancer.

The aesthetic state possesses a superabundance of means of communication, together with an extreme receptivity for stimuli and signs. It constitutes the high point of communication and

transmission between living creatures-it is the source of languages. This is where languages originate: the languages of tone as well as the languages of gestures and glances. The more complete phenomenon is always the beginning: our faculties are subtilized out of more complete faculties. But even today one still hears with one's muscles, one even reads with one's muscles.

Every mature art has a host of conventions as its basis-in so far as it is a language. Convention is the condition of great art, not an obstacle

Every enhancement of life enhances man's power of com munication, as well as his power of understanding. Empathy with the souls of others is originally nothing moral, but a physiological susceptibility to suggestion: "sympathy," or what is called "altru ism," is merely a product of that psychomotor rapport which is reckoned a part of spirituality (induction psycho-motrice, Charles Féré thinks). One never communicates thoughts: one communi cates movements, mimic signs, which we then trace back to thoughts.

810 (Spring-Fall 1887)

Compared with music all communication by words is shame less; words dilute and brutalize; words depersonalize; words make the uncommon common.

811 (March-June 1888)

It is exceptional states that condition the artist--all of them profoundly related to and interlaced with morbid phenomena so it seems impossible to be an artist and not to be sick.

Physiological states that are in the artist as it were molded into a "personality" and that characterize men in general to some degree:

1. intoxication: the feeling of enhanced power; the inner need to make of things a reflex of one's own fullness and perfection;

2. the extreme sharpness of certain senses, so they under stand a quite different sign language--and create one-the con dition that seems to be a part of many nervous disorders cxtreme mobility that turns into an extreme urge to communicate; the desire to speak on the part of everything that knows how to make signs--; a need to get rid of oneself, as it were, through sigas

BOOK THREE: Principles of A New Evaluation

429

and gestures; ability to speak of oneself through a hundred speech media-an explosive condition. One must first think of this con dition as a compulsion and urge to get rid of the exuberance of inner tension through muscular activity and movements of all kinds; then as an involuntary co-ordination between this move ment and the processes within (images, thoughts, desires) -as a kind of automatism of the whole muscular system impelled by strong stimuli from within-; inability to prevent reaction; the system of inhibitions suspended, as it were. Every inner move ment (feeling, thought, affect) is accompanied by vascular changes and consequently by changes in color, temperature, and secretion. The suggestive power of music, its "suggestion mentale";

3. the compulsion to imitate: an extreme irritability through which a given example becomes. contagious--a state is divined on the basis of signs and immediately enacted— An image, rising up within, immediately turns into a movement of the limbs a certain suspension of the will-(Schopenhauer!!!) A kind of deafness and blindness towards the external world--the realm of admitted stimuli is sharply defined.

This is what distinguishes the artist from laymen (those susceptible to art): the latter reach the high point of their susceptibility when they receive; the former as they give--so that an antagonism between these two gifts is not only natural but desirable. The perspectives of these two states are opposite: to demand of the artist that he should practice the perspective of the audience of the criticm) means to demand that he should impoverish himself and his creative power It is the same here as with the difference between the sexes: one ought not to demand of the artist, who gives, that he should become a woman that he should receive.

Our aesthetics hitherto has been a woman's aesthetics to the extent that only the receivers of art have formulated their ex perience of "what is beautiful?" In all philosophy hitherto the artist is lacking.

This, as the foregoing indicates, is a necessary mistake; for the artist who began to understand himself would misunder stand himself: he ought not to look back, he ought not to look at all, he ought to give.

It is to the honor of an artist if he is unable to be a critic otherwise he is half and half, he is "modern."

430

THE WILL TO POWER

812 (March-June 1888) I set down here a list of psychological states as signs of a full and flourishing life that one is accustomed today to condemn as morbid. For by now we have learned better than to speak of healthy and sick as of an antithesis: it is a question of degrees. My claim in this matter is that what is today called "healthy" represents a lower level than that which under favorable circum stances would be healthy---that we are relatively sick

The artist belongs to a still stronger race. What would be harmful and morbid in us; in him is nature But one objects to us that it is precisely the impoverishment of the machine that makes possible extravagant powers of understanding of every kind of suggestion: witness our hysterical females.

An excess of sap and force can bring with it symptoms of partial constraint, of sense hallucinations, susceptibility to sugges tion, just as well as can impoverishment of life: the stimulus is differently conditioned, the effect remains the same. But the after effect is not the same; the extreme exhaustion of all morbid natures after their nervous eccentricities has nothing in common with the states of the artist; who does not have to atone for his good periods. He is rich enough for them; hie is able to squander with out becoming poor.

As one may today consider "genius" as a form of neurosis, so perhaps also the artistic power of suggestion and indeed our artists are painfully like hysterical females!!! But that is an objec tion to "today," not to "artists."....

Inartistic states: those of objectivity, mirroring, suspended will—(Schopenhauer's scandalous misunderstanding when he took art for a bridge to the denial of life)- Inartistic states: among those who become impoverished, withdraw, grow pale, under whose eyes life suffers:--the Christian.

813 (1888)

The modern artist, in his physiology next-of-kin to the hys teric, is also distinguished by this morbidity as a character. The hysteric is false--he lies from love of lying, he is admirable in every art of dissimulation unless his morbid vanity plays a trick

BOOK THREE: Principles of A New Evaluation

431

on him. This vanity is like a continual fever that requires nar cotics and does not shrink from any self-deception, any farce, that promises momentary relief. (Incapacity for pride and the continual need for revenge for a deeply ingrained self-contempt--this is almost the definition of this kind of vanity.).

The absurd irritability of his system, which turns all expe riences into crises and introduces the "dramatic" into the smallest accidents of life, robs him of all calculability: he is no longer a person, at most a rendezvous of persons and now this one, now that one shoots forward with shameless assurance. Precisely for this reason, he is great as an actor: all these poor will-less people whom doctors study so closely astonish one with their virtuosity in mimicry, transfiguration, assumption of almost any desired character.

814 (Spring-Fall 1887; rev. Spring-Fall 1888)

Artists are not men of great passion, whatever they may like to tell us and themselves. And this for two reasons: they lack any sense of shame before themselves (they observe themselves while they live; they spy on themselves, they are too inquisitive) and they also lack any sense of shame before great passion (they exploit it as artists). Secondly, however, their vampire, their talent, grudges them as a rule that squandering of force which one calls passion. If one has a talent, one is also its victim: one lives under the vampirism of one's talent.

One does not get over a passion by representing it: rather, it is over when one is able to represent it. (Goethe teaches other wise; but here it seems that he wanted to misunderstand himself from delicatezza. 180)

815 (Summer-Fall 1888) The rationale of life. A relative chastity, a prudent caution on principle regarding erotic matters, even in thought, can belong to the grand rationale of life even in richly endowed and complete natures. This principle applies especially to artists, it is part of their best wisdom of life. Completely non-suspect voices have lent sup

THE WILL TO POWER port to this opinion: I name Stendhal and Th. Gautier, also Flaubert. The artist is perhaps necessarily a sensual man, generally excitable, susceptible in every sense to stimuli, meeting the very suggestion of a stimulus halfway even from afar. This notwith standing, he is on the average, under the pressure of his task, of his will to mastery, actually moderate, often even chaste. His dominant instinct demands this of him: it does not permit him to expend himself in any casual way. The force that one expends in artistic conception is the same as that expended in the sexual act: there is only one kind of force. An artist betrays himself if he succumbs here, if he squanders himself here: it betrays a lack of instinct, of will in general; it can be a sign of decadence in any case, it devalues his art to an incalculable degree 131

But what has woman to do with the passionate indifference of the true artist, who assigns more importance to a sound, a breath, a heyday!183 than to himself? who strains with every finger to reach his innermost secrets? who accords no value to anything that cannot become form that cannot surrender itself, make itself public ). Art as it is practiced by the artist-do you not grasp what it is: an attempt to assassinate all pudeurs?134

Only in this century has woman ventured to turn to literature ( vers la canaille plumière écrivassière, 135 in the words of old Mirabeau): she dabbles in writing, she dabbles in art, she is los ing her instincts. But why? if one may ask.

818 (Nov. 1887-March 1888)

One is an artist at the cost of regarding that which all non artists call "form" as content, as "the matter itself." To be sure, then one belongs in a topsy-turvy world: for henceforth content becomes something merely formal-our life included.

819 (1883-1888)

A sense for and a delight in nuances (-the real mark of modernity), in that which is not general, runs counter to the drive that delights and excels in grasping the typical: like the Greek taste of the best period. There is an overpowering of the fullness of life in it; measure becomes master; at bottom there is that calm of the strong soul that moves slowly and feels repug Dance toward what is too lively. The general rule, the law, is honored and emphasized: the exception, conversely, is set aside, the nuance obliterated. The firm, powerful, solid, the life that reposes broad and majestic and conceals its strength--that is what "pleases"; i.e., that corresponds to what one thinks of oneself.

THE WILL TO POWER

820 (1885)

In the main, I agree more with the artists than with any philosopher hitherto: they have not lost the scent of life, they have loved the things of "this world"—they have loved their senses. To strive for "desensualization": that seems to me a misunderstand ing or an illness or a cure, where it is not merely hypocrisy or self-deception. I desire for myself and for all who live, may live, without being tormented by a puritanical conscience, an ever greater spiritualization and multiplication of the senses; indeed, we should be grateful to the senses for their subtlety, plenitude, and power and offer them in return the best we have in the way of spirit. What are priestly and metaphysical calumnies against the senses to us! We no longer need these calumnies: it is a sign that one has turned out well when, like Goethe, one clings with ever-greater pleasure and warmth to the "things of this world":-- for in this way he holds firmly to the great conception of man, that man becomes the transfigurer of existence when he learns to transfigure himself, 188

821 (March-June 1888)

Pessimism in art? The artist gradually comes to love for their own sake the means that reveal a condition of intoxication: extreme subtlety and splendor of color, definiteness of line, nuances of tone: the distinct where otherwise, under normal conditions, distinctness is lacking. All distinct things, all nuances, to the extent that they recall these extreme enhancements of strength that intoxi cation produces, awaken this feeling of intoxication by association: the effect of works of art is to excite the state that creates art intoxication.

What is essential in art remains its perfection of existence, its production of perfection and plenitude; art is essentially affirma

tion, blessing, deification of existence- What does a pessimistic

· art signify? Is it not a contradictio? Yes.--- Schopenhauer is wrong when he says that certain works of art serve pessimism. Tragedy does not teach "resignation"— To represent terrible and questionable things is in itself an instinct for power and magnifi

But the Goncourts? — The things they display are ugly: but that they dis play them comes from their pleasure in the ugly. It's no good! If you think otherwise, you're deceiving yourselves. How liberat ing is Dostoevsky!

822 (1888) If my readers are sufficiently initiated into the idea that "the good man" represents, in the total drama of life, a form of exhaus tion, they will respect the consistency of Christianity in conceiving the good man as ugly. Christianity was right in this.

For a philosopher to say, "the good and the beautiful are one," is infamy; if he goes on to add, "also the true," one ought to thrash him. Truth is ugly.

We possess art lest we perish of the truth.

823 (Spring-Fall 1887) The moralization of the arts. Art as freedom from moral narrowness and corner-perspectives; or as mockery of them. Flight into nature, where its beauty is coupled with frightfulness, Con ception of the great human being.

Fragile, useless luxury souls, troubled even by a breath, "beautiful souls."

-To awaken deceased ideals in all their merciless severity and brutaliy, as the most magnificent monsters they are.

A joyful delight in the psychological insight into the sinu osity and unconscious play-acting of all moralized artists.

-The falsity of art-to bring to light its immorality.

-To bring to light "basic idealizing powers" (sensuality, intoxication, superabundant animality).

...THE WILL TO POWER

First: one seeks for oneself a less artistic public, which loves

unconditionally (mand soon kneels down before the person). The superstition of our century, the superstitious

belief in the "genius," helps. Second: one harangues the obscure instincts of the dissatis

fied, ambitious, self-disguised spirits in a democratic age:

importance of poses. Third: one transfers the procedures of one art to the other

arts, confounds the objectives of art with those of knowl edge or the church or racial interests (nätionalism) or philosophy-one pulls all the stops at once and awakens

the dark suspicion that one may be a god. Fourth: one flatters women, sufferers, the indignant, one

makes narcotics and opiates dominant in art, too. One tickles the cultured, readers of poets and ancient stories.

825 (Spring-Fall 1887) The division into "public hall" and "private chamber"; in the former one has to be a charlatan today, in the latter one is deter mined to be a virtuoso and nothing more! The specific "genius" of our century spans this division, is great in both: the great charlatanry of Victor Hugo and Richard Wagner, but coupled with so much genuine virtuosity that they satisfied even the most refined artistic connoisseurs. Hence their lack of greatness: their perspective was continually changing, now directed to the coarsest demands, now to the most refined...

False "intensification": 1. in romanticism: this constant Espressivo is no sign of strength but of a feeling of deficiency;

3. "passion" a matter of nerves and wearied souls; like the delight in high mountains, deserts, storms, orgies, and horrors in the bulky and massive (e.g., on the part of historians); there actually exists a cult of orgies of feeling how does it happen

One has to tyrannize in order to produce any effect at all.139

827 (Spring-Fall 1887)

Modern art as an art of tyrannizing. A coarse and strongly defined logic of delineation; motifs simplified to the point of formulas; the formula tyrannizes. Within the delineations a wild multiplicity, an overwhelming mass, before which the senses become confused; brutality in color, material, desires. Examples: Zola, Wagner; in a more spiritual order, Taine. Thus: logic, mass and brutality.

828 (1883-1888)

In regard to painters: tous ces modernes sont des poètes qui ont voulu être peintres. L'un a cherché des drames dans l'histoire, l'autre des scènes de moeurs, celui-ci traduit des religions, celui-là une philosophie.110 One imitates Raphael, another the early Italian masters; landscape artists employ trees and clouds to make odes and elegies. No one is simply a painter; all are archaeologists, psychologists, theatrical producers of this or that recollection or theory. They enjoy our erudition, our philosophy. Like us, they are full and overfull of general ideas. They like a form, not for the sake of what it is, but for the sake of what it expresses. They are sons of a scholarly, tormented, and reflective generation-a thousand miles removed from the old masters, who did not read and only thought of feasting their eyes.

Romantic musicians relate what exotic books have made of them: one would like to experience exotic things, passions after the Florentine and Venetian taste: in the end one contents one self with seeking them in pictures. The essential thing is the type of new desire, the wish to imitate and to experience the lives of others, disguise, dissimulation of the soul- Romantic art is only a makeshift substitute for a defective "reality."

The attempt to do new things: revolution, Napoleon. Napo leon, the passion of new possibilities of the soul, an expansion of the soul.

If one understands by artistic genius the greatest freedom under the law, divine frivolity, facility in the hardest things, then Offenbach has even more right to the name "genius" than Wagner. Wagner is heavy and ponderous: nothing is more foreign to him than moments of the most high-spirited perfection, such as this buffoon Offenbach achieves five or six times in almost every one of his buffooneries.143 But perhaps one might understand some thing else by the word genius.144_

"Dramatic music" nonsense! It is simply bad music "Feel ing," "passion" as surrogates when one no longer knows how to achieve an exalted spirituality and the happiness that attends it (e.g., that of Voltaire). Technically, "feeling" and "passion" are easier--they presuppose much poorer artists. Recourse to drama betrays that an artist is more a master of false means than of genuine means. We have dramatic painting, dramatic lyrics, etc.

BOOK THREE: Principles of A New Evaluation

441 a genuine conflict over "principles"—for as musicians we laugh at Herbart's velleities in this realm as much as we do at Schopen hauer's. In fact, this results in a great difficulty: we no longer know on what basis to found the concepts "model," "mastery," "perfection"-we grope blindly in the realm of values with the instinct of old love and admiration; we come close to believing "what is good is what pleases us"

It awakens my mistrust when Beethoven is everywhere quite innocently described as a "classicist": I would strictly maintain that in the other arts one understands by a classicist an artist of the opposite type of Beethoven's. But when even the complete and obvious disintegration of style in Wagner, his so-called dramatic style, is taught and honored as "exemplary," as "mastery," as "progress," my impatience reaches its height. The dramatic style in music, as Wagner understands it, is the renunciation of style in general, on the presupposition that something else is a hundred times more important than music, namely the drama. Wagner can paint, he employs music for something other than music, he empha sizes poses, he is a poet; finally, he appealed to "beautiful feelings" and "heaving bosoms" like all artists of the theater and with all this he won over the women and even those in need of culture: but what is music to women and those in need of culture! They have no conscience for art; they do not suffer when all the princi pal and most indispensable virtues of an art are trampled under foot and mocked for the benefit of secondary objectives (as ancilla148 dramaturgica). What is the point of extending the means of expres sion if that which expresses, art itself, has lost the law of its being! The picturesque pomp and power of tones, the symbolism of sound, rhythm, colors of harmony and disharmony, the suggestive significance of music, the whole sensuality of music which Wagner has brought into dominance call this Wagner recognized in music, drew out of it, developed. Victor Hugo did something similar to language; but already today the French are asking themselves whether, in Hugo's case, it was not a corruption of language whether, with the increase of sensuality in language, reason, spirit uality, the profound obedience to law in language have not been de pressed? That the poets in France have become sculptors, that the musicians in Germany have become actors and culture-mongers-- are these not signs of decadence?

839 (Spring-Fall 1887; rev. Spring-Fall 1888)

Today we have a musical pessimism, even among the non musical. Who has not met him, who has not cursed him the wretched youth who tortures his piano into cries of despair, who single-handed heaves forward the mud of the gloomiest gray-brown harmonies? This identifies one as a pessimist. But whether this also identifies one as a musician? I cannot be made to think so. The Wagnerian pur sang140 is unmusical; he succumbs to the ele mental powers of music somewhat as a woman succumbs to the will of her hypnotist-and in order to be able to do this, he must not be made suspicious by a severe and subtle conscience in rebus musicis et musicantibus.150 I said "somewhat as" , but perhaps we have more than a metaphor here. Consider the means for pro ducing effects that Wagner prefers to use and had for the most part to invent for himself): they are strangely similar to those with which a hypnotist achieves his effect (his choice of tempo and tonal color for his orchestra; the repellent avoidance of logic and squareness in his rhythm; the lingering, soothing, mysterious, hysterical quality of his "endless melody").- And is the condi tion to which the Lohengrin prelude, for example, reduces its hear ers, especially women, essentially different from a somnambulistic trance?

I distinguish between courage in the face of people, courage in the face of things, and courage in the face of paper. The latter was, e.g., the courage of David Strauss. I distinguish further be tween courage before witnesses and courage without witnesses: the courage of a Christian, of a believer in God in general, can never be courage without witnesses--this fact alone degrades it. I dis tinguish, finally, courage rooted in temperament and courage rooted in fear of fear: a particular instance of the latter type is moral courage. There should also be added courage from despair.

Wagner possessed this kind of courage. His situtaion regard ing music was, at bottom, desperate. He lacked the two things needed to make a good musician: nature and culture, a predis position toward music and training and schooling in music. He possessed courage: he made a principle of what he lacked-he invented a style of music for himself. “Dramatic music," as in vented by him, is the music he was capable of making-Wagner's limitations define this concept.

And he was misunderstood! Was he misunderstood? Five-sixths of modern artists are in this position. Wagner is their savior; five-sixths is in any case the "lowest estimate." In every instance in which nature has shown herself inexorable and in which on the other hand culture has remained accidental, tenta tive, dilettante, the artist turns instinctively--what am I saying? cnthusiastically to Wagner: "half did he drag him, half he sank," as the poet says.153

THE WILL TO POWER cannot be measured by the "beautiful feelings" he arouses: leave that idea to females. But according to the degree to which he approaches the grand style, to which he is capable of the grand style. This style has this in common with great passion, that it disdains to please; that it forgets to persuade; that it commands; that it wills - To become master of the chaos one is; to compel one's chaos to become form: to become logical, simple, unam biguous, mathematics, law--that is the grand ambition here.— It repels; such men of force are no longer loved a desert spreads around them, a silence, a fear as in the presence of some great sacrilege- All the arts know such aspirants to the grand style: why are they lacking in music? No musician has yet built as that architect did who created the Palazzo Pitti Here lies a problem. Does music perhaps belong to that culture in which the domain of men of force of all kinds has ceased? Does the concept grand style ultimately stand in contradiction to the soul of music to the "woman" in our music?--

I here touch upon a cardinal question: where does our entire music belong? The ages of classical taste knew nothing to com pare with it: it began to blossom when the Renaissance world had attained its evening, when "freedom" had departed from morals and even from men:-is it part of its character to be counter-Renaissance? Is it the sister of the Baroque style, since it is in any case its contemporary? Is music, modern music, not already decadence?

Once before I pointed to this question: whether our music is not a piece of counter-Renaissance in art? whether it is not next of-kin to the Baroque style? whether it has not grown up in con tradiction to all classical taste, so that all ambitions to become classical are forbidden to it by its nature?

The answer to this first-rank question of values would not remain in doubt if the proper inferences had been drawn from the fact that music achieved its greatest ripeness and fullness as roman ticism--once again as a movement of reaction against classicism.

Mozart-a delicate and amorous soul, but entirely eighteenth century, even when he is serious.-- Beethoven the first great romantic, in the sense of the French conception of romanticism, as Wagner is the last great romantic-both instinctive opponents of classical taste, of severe style-to say nothing of "grand" style.

A romantic is an artist whose great dissatisfaction with him self makes him creativewho looks away, looks back from him self and from his world.

845 (1885-1886)

Is art a consequence of dissatisfaction with reality? Or an expression of gratitude for happiness enjoyed? In the former case, romanticism, in the latter, aureole and dithyramb in short, art of apotheosis): Raphael, too, belongs here; he merely had the falsity to deify what looked like the Christian interpretation of the world. He was grateful for existence where it was not specifically Christian.

The moral interpretation makes the world unbearable. Chris tianity was the attempt to "overcome" the world by it; i.e., to negate it. In praxi, such a murderous attempt of insanity-an insane self-elevation of man above the world-resulted in making man gloomy, small, and impoverished: only the most mediocre and harmless type of man, the herd type, profited by it, was advanced by it, if you like.
