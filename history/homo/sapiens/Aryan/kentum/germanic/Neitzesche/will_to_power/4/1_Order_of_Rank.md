## 1. The Doctrine of Order of Rank

854 (1884) In the age of suffrage universel, i.e., when everyone may sit in judgment on everyone and everything, I feel impelled to re establish order of rank.

855 (Spring-Fall 1887)

What determines rank, sets off rank, is only quanta of power, and nothing else.

856 (1885-1886)

.

The will to power.- How those men would have to be con stituted who took upon themselves this revaluation. Order of rank as order of power: war and danger the presupposition for a rank to retain the conditions of its existence. The grandiose prototype: man in nature- the weakest, shrewdest creature making himself master, subjugating the stupider forces.

857 (Jan.-Fall 1888)

I distinguish between a type of ascending life and another type of decay, disintegration, weakness. Is it credible that the question of the relative rank of these two types still needs to be posed?

858 (Nov. 1887-March 1888)

What determines your rank is the quantum of power you are: the rest is cowardice.

458

THE WILL TO POWER

859 (1883-1888) Advantage of detachment from one's age. In a state of de tachment from both movements, individualistic and collectivistic morality-for even the former does not recognize order of rank and would grant one the same freedom as all. My ideas do not re volve around the degree of freedom that is granted to the one or to the other or to all, but around the degree of power that the one or the other should exercise over others or over all, and to what extent a sacrifice of freedom, even enslavement, provides the basis for the emergence of a higher type. Put in the crudest form: how could one sacrifice the development of mankind to help a higher species than man to come into existence?

860 (1884)

Of rank. The terrible consequence of "equality"-finally, everyone believes he has a right to every problem. All order of rank has vanished.

861 (1884)

A declaration of war on the masses by higher men is needed! Everywhere the mediocre are combining in order to make them selves master! Everything that makes soft and effeminate, that serves the ends of the "people" or the "feminine," works in favor of suffrage universel, i.e., the dominion of inferior men. But we should take reprisal and bring this whole affair (which in Europe commenced with Christianity) to light and to the bar of judgment.

862 (1884)

A doctrine is needed powerful enough to work as a breeding agent: strengthening the strong, paralyzing and destructive for the world-weary.

Cf. section 1053 below and 462 above.


(p459)

 The annihilation of the decaying races. Decay of Europe. The annihilation of slavish evaluations. Dominion over the earth as a means of producing a higher type.-- The annihilation of the tartuffery called "morality" (Christianity as a hysterical kind of honesty in this: Augustine, Bunyan).- The annihilation of suf frage universel; i.e., the system through which the lowest natures prescribe themselves as laws for the higher. The annihilation of mediocrity and its acceptance. (The onesided, individuals peoples; to strive for fullness of nature through the pairing of opposites: race mixture to this end).— The new courage-10 a priori truths (such truths were sought by those accustomed to faith!), but a free subordination to a ruling idea that has its time: e.g., time as a property of space, etc.

2. The Strong and the Weak

863 (Jan-Fall 1888) The concept "stronger and weaker man" reduces itself to the idea that in the first case a great deal of force is inherited- he is a summation in the second, as yet little inadequate in heritance, splintering of that which is inherited). Weakness can be an inaugural phenomenon: "as yet little"; or a terminal phe nomenon: "no more."

The starting point is where great force is, where force is to be discharged. The mass, as the sum of the weak, reacts slowly; defends itself against much for which it is too weak- of which it can make no use; does not create, does not advance.

This in opposition to the theory that denies the strong indi vidual and believes "the mass does it." It is the same difference as between two separated generations: four or five generations may lie between the active agent and the massa chronological differ ence,

The values of the weak prevail because the strong have taken them over as devices of leadership.

460

THE WILL TO POWER

: 864 (March-June 1888)

Why the weak conquer. In summa: the sick and weak have more sympathy, are "more humane" : the sick and weak have more spirit, are more changeable, various, entertaining-more ma licious: it was the sick who invented malice. (A morbid precocious ness is often found in the tickety, scrofulous and tubercular.) Esprit: quality of late races: Jews, Frenchmen, Chinese. (The anti Semites do not forgive the Jews for possessing "spirit" -and money. Anti-Semites-another name for the underprivileged.")

The sick and weak have had fascination on their side: they are more interesting than the healthy: the fool and the saint--the two most interesting kinds of man closely related to them, the "genius." The great "adventurers and criminals" and all men, es pecially the most healthy, are sick at certain periods in their lives: --the great emotions, the passions of power, love, revenge, are accompanied by profound disturbances. And as for decadence, it is represented in almost every sense by every man who does not die too soon:---thus he also knows from experience the instincts that belong to it:--almost every man is decadent for half his life.

Finally: woman! One-half of mankind is weak, typically sick, changeable, inconstant--woman needs strength in order to cleave to it; she needs a religion of weakness that glorifies being weak, loving, and being humble as divine: or better, she makes the strong weak—she rules when she succeeds in overcoming the strong. Woman has always conspired with the types of decadence, the priests, against the "powerful," the "strong," the men— Woman brings the children to the cult of piety, pity, love: the mother represents altruism convincingly..

Finally: increasing civilization, which necessarily brings with it an increase in the morbid elements, in the neurotic-psychiatric and criminal. An intermediary species arises: the artist, restrained from crime by weakness of will and social timidity, and not yet ripe for the madhouse, but reaching out inquisitively toward both spheres with his antennae: this specific culture plant, the modern artist, painter, musician, above all novelist, who describes his mode of life with the very inappropriate word "naturalism"- Lunatics, criminals, and "naturalists" are increasing: sign of a growing cul


(p461)



ture rushing on precipitately-.e., the refuse, the waste, gain im portance the decline keeps pace.

Finally: the social hodgepodge, consequence of the Revolution, the establishment of equal rights, of the superstition of "equal men." The bearers of the instincts of decline (of ressentiment, dis content, the drive to destroy, anarchism, and nihilism), including the slave instincts, the instincts of cowardice, cunning, and canaille in those orders that have long been kept down, mingle with the blood of all classes: two, three generations later the race is no longer recognizable-everything has become mob. From this there results a collective instinct against selection, against privilege of all kinds, that is so powerful and self-assured, hard, and cruel in its operation, that the privileged themselves actually soon succumb to it: whoever still wants to retain power flatters the mob, works with the mob, must have the mob on its side-the "geniuses" above all: they become heralds of those feelings with which one moves the masses-the note of sympathy, even reverence, for all that has lived a life of suffering, lowliness, contempt, persecution, sounds above all other notes (types: Victor Hugo and Richard Wag ner). The rise of the mob signifies once again the ascendancy of the old values.

Such an extreme movement in respect of tempo and means as our civilization represents, shifts men's center of gravity: those men who matter most, who have, as it were, the task of compensating for the vast danger of such a morbid movement;—they will become procrastinators par excellence, slow to adopt, reluctant to let go, and relatively enduring in the midst of this tremendous change and mixture of elements. In such circumstances, the center of gravity necessarily shifts to the mediocre: against the dominion of the mob and of the eccentric (both are usually united), mediocrity consolidates itself as the guarantee and bearer of the future. Thus emerges a new opponent for exceptional menor a new seduction, Provided they do not accommodate themselves to the mob and try to fiatter the instincts of the "disinherited," they will have to be "mediocre" and "solid." They know: mediocritas is also aurea indeed, it alone disposes of money and gold of all that glitters ) -And once more the old virtue, and the entire dated world of the ideal in general, gains a body of gifted advocates. Result:

* Mediocrity is also gold.

462

THE WILL TO POWER mediocrity acquires spirit, wit, genius it becomes entertaining, it seduces.

Result.- A high culture can stand only upon a broad base, upon a strong and healthy consolidated mediocrity. Science and even artwork in its service and are served by it. Science could not wish for a better situation: it belongs as such to a mediocre kind of man-it is out of place among the exceptional-it has nothing aristocratic, and even less anything anarchistic, in its instinct.

The power of the middle is, further, upheld by trade, above all trade in money: the instinct of great financiers goes against every thing extreme--that is why the Jews are at present the most con serving power in our intensely threatened and insecure Europe. They can have no use for revolution, socialism, or militarism: if they desire and employ power, even over the revolutionary party, this is only a consequence of the aforesaid and not a contradiction. They need occasionally to arouse fear of other extreme tendencies by demonstrating how much power they have in their hands. But their instinct itself is unswervingly conservative and mediocre" Wherever there is power, they know how to be powerful; but the employment of their power is always in one direction. The honor able term for mediocre is, of course, the word "liberal."

Reflection.- It is absurd to assume that this whole victory of values is antibiological: one must try to explain it in terms of an interest life has in preserving the type "man" even through this method of the dominance of the weak and underprivileged—: otherwise, man would cease to exist?--Problem

The enhancement of the type fatal for the preservation of the species? Why?

History shows: the strong races decimate one another: through war, thirst for power, adventurousness; the strong affects: wasteful ness-(strength is no longer hoarded, spiritual disturbance arises through excessive tension); their existence is costly; in brief-they

In the MS the following words are written in the margin before the next paragraph: "The crafts, trade, agriculture, science, a large part of the arts-all this can rest only on a broad base, on a strongly and healthily con solidated mediocrity."

ruin one another; periods of profound exhaustion and torpor supervene: all great ages are paid for--- The strong are subsequently weaker, more devoid of will, more absurd than the weak average.

They are races that squander. "Duration" as such has no value: one might well prefer a shorter but more valuable existence for the species. It would remain to be proved that, even so, a richer yield of value would be gained than in the case of the shorter existence; i.e., that man as summation of strength acquires a much greater quantum of mastery over things if life is as it is. We stand before a problem of economics

865 (Spring-Fall 1887)

An attitude that cals itself. "idealism" and that will not allow mediocrity to be mediocre, or woman to be woman. No uni formity! Let us be clear how dearly a virtue is bought; and that virtue is not something of average desirability, but a noble mad Dess, a beautiful exception, with the privilege of strong feelings

866 (Spring-Fall 1887; rev. Spring-Fall 1888)

The need to show that as the consumption of man and man kind becomes more and more economical and the "machinery" of interests and services is integrated ever more intricately, a counter movement is inevitable. I designate this as the secretion of a luxury surplus of mankind: it aims to bring to light a stronger species, a higher type that arises and preserves itself under different condi tions from those of the average man, My concept, my metaphor for this type is, as one knows, the word "overman."

On that first road which can now be completely surveyed, arise adaptation, leveling, higher Chinadom, modesty in the instincts, satisfaction in the dwarfing of mankind-a kind of stationary level of mankind. Once we possess that common economic management of the earth that will soon be inevitable, mankind will be able to find its best meaning as a machine in the service of this economy as a tremendous clockwork, composed of ever smaller, ever more subtly "adapted" gears; as an ever-growing superfluity of all dominating and commanding elements, as a whole of tremendous force, whose individual factors represent minimal forces, minimal values.

In opposition to this dwarfing and adaptation of man to a

464

THE WILL TO POWER

specialized utility, a reverse movement is needed the production of a synthetic, summarizing, justifying man for whose existence this transformation of mankind into a machine is a precondition, as a base on which he can invent his higher form of being.

He needs. the opposition of the masses, of the "leveled," a feeling of distance from them! he stands on them, he lives off them. This higher form of aristocracy is that of the future. Morally speaking, this overall machinery, this solidarity of all gears, repre sents a maximum in the exploitation of man; but it presupposes those on whose account this exploitation has meaning. Otherwise it would really be nothing but an overall diminution, a value di minution of the type man--a regressive phenomenon in the grand style.

It is clear, what I combat is economic optimism: as if increas ing expenditure of everybody must necessarily involve the in creasing welfare of everybody. The opposite seems to me to be the case; expenditure of everybody amounts to a collective loss: man is diminished-so one no longer knows what aim this tre mendous process has served. An aim? a new aim?--that is what humanity needs.

Shifting of the center of gravity of a culture. The cost of every great growth: who bears it! Why it must now be tremendous.

BOOK: FOUR: Discipline and Breeding consequence of the will to be terrible ). To fight upward out of that chaos to this form requires a compulsion: one must be faced with the choice of perishing or prevailing. A dominating race can grow up only out of terrible and violent beginnings. Problem: where are the barbarians of the twentieth century? Obviously, they will come into view and consolidate themselves only after tremendous socialist crises—they will be the elements capable of the greatest severity toward themselves and able to gurantee the most enduring will.

869 (1885-1886)

The most powerful and most dangerous passions of man, of which he can most easily perish, have been outlawed so com pletely that the most powerful men themselves have become im possible or have had to feel evil—"harmful and forbidden.” This loss is considerable, but hitherto it has been unavoidable: now that a host of counterforces has been reared by the temporary suppression of those passions (of lust for power, pleasure in change and deception), it is again possible to unloose them: they will no longer possess their old savagery. We permit ourselves a tame barbarism: just look at our artists and statesmen.

870 (1884)

The root of all evil: that the slavish morality of meekness, chastity, selflessness, absolute obedience, has triumphed--ruling natures were thus condemned (1) to hypocrisy, (1) to: torments of conscience-creative natures felt like rebels against God, un certain and inhibited by eternal values.

The barbarians showed that the ability for restraint was not at home among them: they feared and slandered the passions and drives of nature:-also the view of the ruling Caesars and classes. On the other hand, the suspicion arose that all moderation was weakness, or a sign of growing old and weary (thus La Rochefoucauld suspected that "virtue" was a pretty word among those who could no longer take any pleasure in vice). Moderation itself was represented as a matter of severity, self-conquest, asceti cism, as a fight with the devil, etc. The natural delight of aesthetic natures in measure, the enjoyment of the beauty of measure, was466

THE WILL TO POWER

overlooked or denied, because one desired an anti-eudaemonistic morality.

The faith in the pleasure of moderation--that pleasure of the rider on a fiery steed!—has been lacking hitherto. - The mediocrity of weaker natures has been confused with the modera

tion of the strong!

In summa: the best things have been slandered because the weak or the immoderate swine have cast a bad light on them and the best men have remained hidden—and have often mis understood themselves.

871 (Nov, 1887-March 1888)

The vicious and unbridled: their depressive influence on the value of the desires. It was the dreadful barbarism of custom that, especially in the Middle Ages, compelled the creation of a veritable "league of virtue"-together with an equally dreadful exaggeration of that which constitutes the value of man. Struggling "civilization" (taming) needs every kind of irons and torture to maintain itself against terribleness and beast-of-prey natures.

Here a confusion is quite natural, although its influence has been fatal: that which men of power and will are able to demand of themselves also provides a measure of that which they may permit themselves. Such natures are the antithesis of the vicious and unbridled: although they may on occasion do things that would convict a lesser man of vice and immoderation.

Here the concept of the "equal value of men before God" is extraordinarily harmful; one forbade actions and attitudes that were in themselves among the prerogatives of the strongly con stituted as if they were in themselves unworthy of men. One brought the entire tendency of the strong into disreputę when one erected the protective measures of the weakest (those who were weakest also when confronting themselves) as a norm of value.

Confusion went so far that one branded the very virtuosi of life (whose autonomy offered the sharpest antithesis to the vicious and unbridled) with the most opprobrious names. Even now one believes one must disapprove of a Cesare Borgia; that is simply laughable. The church has excommunicated German emperors on account of their vices: as if a monk or priest had any right to join in a discussion about what a Frederick II may demand of him

self. A Don Juan is sent to hell: that is very naive. Has it been noticed that in heaven all interesting men are missing? Just a hint to the girls as to where they can best find their salvation. If one reflects with some consistency, and moreover with a deepened insight into what a "great man" is, no doubt remains that the church sends all "great men" to hell-it fights against all "great ness of man."

872 (1884)

The rights a man arrogates to himself are related to the duties he imposes upon himself, to the tasks to which he feels equal. The great majority of men have no right to existence, but are a misfortune to higher men.

873 (1884) Misunderstanding of egoism on the part of common natures who know nothing whatever of the pleasure of conquest and the insatiability of great love, nor of the overflowing feeling of strength that desires to overpower, to compel to itself, to lay to its heart the drive of the artist in relation to his material, Often it is merely the penchant for activity that is looking for a field of action.

In ordinary "egoism" it is precisely the "non-ego," the profoundly average creature, the species man, who desires to preserve himself: if this is perceived by rarer, subtler, and less average men, it enrages them, For they judge: "we are nobler! Our preservation is more important than that of those cattle!"

The degeneration of the rulers and the ruling classes has been the cause of the greastest mischief in history! Without the Roman Caesars and Roman society, the insanity of Christianity would never have come to power.

The words that immediately follow in the MS have been omitted in all editions: "I do not yet grant the failures [den Missrathenen] the right. There are also peoples that are failures (missrathene Völker]." While these words in a note not intended for publication (first printed in 1911, p. 512) sound ominous, it is clear from Nietzsche's books that he is not thinking of the Jews, the Poles, the Russians, or any other peoples whom the Nazis later decimated.

468

THE WILL TO POWER

When lesser men begin to doubt whether higher men exist, then the danger is great! And one ends by discovering that there is virtue also among the lowly and subjugated, the poor in spirit, and that before God men are equal which has so far been the non plus ultra of nonsense on earth! For ultimately, the higher men measured themselves according to the standard of virtue of slaves _found they were "proud," etc., found all their higher qualities reprehensible.

When Nero and Caracalla sat up there, the paradox arose: "the lowest man is worth more than that man up there!" And the way was prepared for an image of God that was as remote as possible from the image of the most powerful--the god on the cross!

875 (1884)

The higher man and the herd man. When great men are lacking, one makes demigods or whole gods out of the great men of the past: the outbreak of religion demonstrates that man no longer delights man ("no, nor woman neither," with Hamlet). Or: one brings many men together into one heap as a parliament and hopes they will be equally tyrannical.

"Tyrannization" is the quality of great men; they make lesser men stupid.

876 (1888)

The best example of the degree to which a plebeian agitator of the mob is incapable of comprehending the concept "higher nature" is provided by Buckle. The view he combats so passion ately that "great men," individuals, princes, statesmen, geniuses, generals are the levers and causes of all great movements-is in stinctively misunderstood by him, as if it meant that what is essential and valuable in such "higher men" were their capacity for setting masses in motion: in short, their effect.

But the "higher nature" of the great man lies in being dif ferent, in incommunicability, in distance of rank, not in an effect of any kind even if he made the whole globe tremble.

The misunderstanding attacked here is widespread among those who have attempted popular expositions of Nietzsche. Again and again, the view

The Revolution made Napoleon possible: that is its justifi cation. For the sake of a similar prize one would have to desire the anarchical collapse of our entire civilization. Napoleon made nationalism possible: that is its excuse.

The value of a man (apart from his morality or immorality, naturally; for with these concepts the value of a man is not even touched) does not reside in his utility; for it would continue to exist even if there were no one to whom he could be of any use. And why could not precisely that man who produced the most disastrous effects be the pinnacle of the whole species of man: so high, so superior that everything would perish from envy of him?

878 (Spring-Fall 1887)

To appraise the value of a man according to how useful he is to men, or how much he costs, or what harm he does them that is as much-or as little as to appraise a work of art accord ing to the effects it produces. But in this way, the value of a man in comparison with other men is not even touched upon. "Moral evaluation," in so far as it is a social evaluation, measures men exclusively according to the effects they produce. A man with a taste of his own, enclosed and concealed by his solitude, incom municable, reserved- an unfathomed man, thus a man of a higher, at any rate a different species: how should you be able to evaluate him, since you cannot know him, cannot compare him?

Moral valuation has resulted in the greatest obtuseness of judgment: the value of a man in himself is underrated, almost over looked, almost denied. Remnant of naive teleology: the value of man only in relation to men.

he castigates has been attributed to him, In this connection, the sections that immediately follow are also of great interest; especially 877-81 and 885-88, as well as 983-84.

Preoccupation with morality places a spirit in a low order of rank: he lacks the instinct for privilege, the a parte, the feeling of freedom of creative natures, of the children of God" (or of the devil). And it is all one whether he preaches current morality or uses his ideal for a critique of current morality: he belongs to the herd even if it be as the herd's supreme requirement, its "shepherd,"

Replacement of morality by the will to our goal, and conse quently to the means to it.

881 (Spring-Fall 1887; rev. Spring-Fall 1888)

Order of rank:- What is mediocre in the typical man? That he does not understand the necessity for the reverse side of things: that he combats evils as if one could dispense with them; that he will not take the one with the other---that he wants to erase and extinguish the typical character of a thing; a condition, an age, a person, approving of only one part of their qualities and wishing to abolish the others. The "desirability" of the mediocre is what we others combat: the ideal conceived as something in which nothing harmful, evil, dangerous, questionable, destructive would remain. Our insight is the opposite of this: that with every growth of man, his other side must grow too; that the highest man, if such a concept be allowed, would be the man who represented the anti thetical character of existence most strongly, as its glory and sole justification Commonplace men can represent only a tiny nook and corner of this natural character: they perish when the multi plicity of elements and the tension of opposites, i.e., the pre conditions for greatness in man, increases. That man must grow better and more evil is my formula for this inevitability

Most men represent pieces and fragments of man: one has to add them up for a complete man to appear. Whole ages, whole peoples are in this sense somewhat fragmentary; it is perhaps part of the economy of human evolution that man should evolve piece by piece. But that should not make one forget for a moment


(p471)

 that the real issue is the production of the synthetic man; that lower men, the tremendous majority, are merely preludes and re hearsals out of whose medley the whole man appears here and there, the milestone man who indicates how far humanity has advanced so far. It does not advance in a single straight line; often a type once achieved is lost again with all the tensions of the past three hundred years, for example, we have not yet reattained the man of the Renaissance, and the man of the Renais sance, in turn, is inferior to the man of antiquity).7.

882 (Nov. 1887-March 1888)

One recognizes the superiority of the Greek man and the Renaissance man--but one would like to have them without the causes and conditions that made them possible.

883 (Spring-Fall 1887) "Purification of taste" can only be the result of a strengthen ing of the type. Our society of today only represents culture; the cultured man is lacking. The great synthetic man is lacking, in whom the various forces are unhesitatingly harnessed for the at tainment of one goal. What we possess is the multifarious man, perhaps the most interesting chaos there has ever been, but not the chaos before the creation of a world, but that after Goethe as the most beautiful expression of the type (-absolutely not an Olympian!).Ta

by employing one against the other and reserving freedom for itself..

885 (Nov. 1887-March 1888)

I have grasped this much: if one had made the rise of great and rare men dependent upon the approval of the many (assum ing that the latter knew what qualities belonged to greatness and also at whose expense all greatness evolves) -Well, there would never have been a single significant man!

That the course of things makes its way independently of the approval of the great majority: that is why a few astonishing things have insinuated themselves on the earth.

886 (Spring-Fall 1887)

The order of rank of human values.

a. One should not evaluate a man according to individual works. Epidermal actions. Nothing is rarer than a personal action. A class, a rank, a race, an environment, an accident--anything is more likely to be expressed in a work or act than is a "per sonality? [eine "Person").

b. One should not assume in any case that many men are "personalities." And then some are several personalities, most are none. Wherever the average qualities preponderate, on which the preservation of a type depends, being a personality would be a waste, a luxury, it would be senseless to demand a "personality." They are bearers, tools of transmission.

c. The "personality," a relatively isolated fact; considering the far greater importance of continuation and averageness, almost something antinatural. For the production of a personality one needs early isolation, a compulsion to an existence of defense and combat, something like an incarceration, a greater power of self-definition; and above all a much lower impressionability than that of the average man, whose humanity is contagious.

First question concerning order of rank: how solitary or how gregarious one is. (In the latter case, one's value resides in the qualities that secure the survival of one's herd, one's type; in the former, in that which distinguishes, isolates, defends one, and makes one's solitariness possible.)

Consequence: one should not evaluate the solitary type from


(p473)

 the viewpoint of the gregarious, nor the gregarious from the view point of the solitary.

Viewed from a height, both are necessary; their antagonism is also necessary-and nothing should be banished more thoroughly than the "desirability" that some third thing might evolve out of the two ("virtue" as hermaphroditism). That is as little "desirable" as the approximation and reconciliation of the sexes. To evolve further that which is typical, to make the gulf wider and wider

Concept of degeneration in both cases: when the herd starts to acquire the qualities of the solitary, and the latter the qualities of the herd-in short, when they approximate each other. This concept of degeneration has nothing to do with moral evaluation.

887 (Spring-Fall 1887)

Where one must seek the stronger natures. The ruin and degeneration of the solitary species is much greater and more ter rible; they have the instincts of the herd, the tradition of values, against them; their instruments of defense, their protective in stincts, are from the beginning not sufficiently strong or certain -chance must be very favorable to them if they are to prosper (--they prosper most often in the lowest and socially most aban doned elements; if one looks for personality, that is where one finds it much more certainly than in the middle classes!).

The strata and class struggle that aims at "equality of rights" --once it is more or less over, the war against the solitary per sonality will begin. (In a certain sense, the latter can maintain and develop himself most easily in a democratic society: namely, when the coarser means of defense are no longer necessary and habits of order, honesty, justice, and trust are part of the usual con ditions.)

The strongest must be bound most firmly, watched, laid in chains, and guarded if the instinct of the herd has its way. For them a regime of self-control, ascetic detachment, or "duty" in exhausting work in which one completely loses oneself.

equipped with the virtues of the machine (he must learn to experience the states in which he works in a mechanically useful way as the supremely valuable states; hence it is necessary to spoil the other states for him as much as possible, as highly danger ous and disreputable).

The first stumbling block is the boredom, the monotony, that all mechanical activity brings with it. To learn to endure this-- and not only endure it—to learn to see boredom enveloped in a higher charm; this has hitherto been the task of all higher school ing. To learn something that is of no concern to us, and to find one's "duty" precisely in this "objective activity; to learn to value pleasure and duty as altogether separate things--that is the in valuable task and achievement of higher schooling. This is why the philologist has hitherto been the educator as such; because his activity provides the model of sublime monotony in action; under his banner the young man learns to "grind"': first prerequisite for future efficiency in the fulfillment of mechanical duties (as civil servant, husband, office slave, newspaper reader, and soldier). Such an existence perhaps requires a philosophical justification and transfiguration more than any other; agreeable feelings in general must be relegated to a lower rank by some sort of infallible court of appeal; “duty in itself," perhaps even the pathos of reverence in regard to everything disagreeable and this demand speaking imperatively from beyond any question of utility, amusement, purpose The mechanical form of existence as the highest, most venerable form of existence, worshiping itself ( type: Kant as a fanatic of the formal concept "thou shalt").S

The economic valuation of ideals hitherto—i.e., selection of certain affects and states, selected and reared at the expense of others. The lawgiver (or the instinct of society) selects a number of states and affects through whose operation a regularity in performance is guaranteed (namely, a mechanical performance as a consequence of the regular requirements of those affects and states).

Supposing that these states and affects contain painful in

Cf. Twilight, "Skirmishes," section 29 (Portable Nietzsche, p. 532), where these ideas receive the definitive formulation,


(p475)



gredients, then a means must be found to overcome these painful ingredients through a value-idea designed to make displeasure seem valuable and therefore pleasurable in a higher sense. Re duced to a formula: "How can something disagreeable become agreeable?" For example, when our obedience, our submission to the law, attain honor through the strength, power, self-over coming they entail. As do our consideration for the community, the neighbor, the fatherland, our "humanization," our "altruism," "heroism."

That one should like to do disagreeable things--that is the object of ideals.

890 (Spring-Fall 1887)

The dwarfing of man must for a long time count as the only goal; because a broad foundation has first to be created so that a stronger species of man can stand upon it. (To what extent every strengthened species of man hitherto has stood upon a level of the lower ..)

891 (Spring-Fall 1887)

Absurd and contemptible form of idealism that would not have mediocrity mediocre and, instead of feeling a sense of triumph at a state of exceptionalness, becomes indignant over cowardice, falsity, pettiness, and wretchedness. One should not desire these things to be different! and should make the gulf wider! — One should compel the higher kind of man to sever himself from the others through the sacrifices he has to make to his state of being.

Chief viewpoint: establish distances, but create no antitheses. Dissolve the intermediate forms and reduce their influence: chief means of preserving distances.

892 (Jan-Fall 1888)

How should one wish to spoil mediocrity for the mediocre! As one will see, I do the opposite: every step away from it so I teach-leads to immorality. 10

Hatred for mediocrity is unworthy of a philosopher: it is almost a question mark against his "right to philosophy." Pre cisely because he is an exception he has to take the rule under his protection, he has to keep the mediocre in good heart.

894 (Spring-Fall 1887)

What I fight against: that an exceptional type should make war on the rule-instead of grasping that the continued existence of the rule is the precondition for the value of the exception. For example, the ladies who, instead of feeling their abnormal thirst for scholarship as a distinction, want to disrupt the status of woman in general.

895 (Spring-Fall 1887)

The increase of force despite the temporary decline of the individual:

to establish a new level: a method of assembling forces for the preservation of

small achievements, in opposition to uneconomic waste; destructive nature temporarily subdued as an instrument

for this future economy; preservation of the weak, because a tremendous number

of petty tasks have to be performed; preservation of an attitude of mind that makes existence

still possible for the weak and suffering; to implant solidarity as an instinct against the instinct of

fear and servility; struggle against accident, also against the accident of "great

men."

Struggle against men justified on economic grounds. They are dangerous, accidents, exceptions, tempests, strong enough to call in question things slowly built and established. Explosives

897 (Jan-Fall 1888) Whover reflects upon the way in which the type man can be raised to his greatest spendor and power will grasp first of all that he must place himself outside morality; for morality has been essentially directed to the opposite end: to obstruct or destroy that spendid evolution wherever it has been going on. For such an evolution does indeed consume so great a quantity of men in its service that a reverse movement is only too natural: the weaker, more delicate, intermediate existences need to take sides against that gloriousness of life and strength; and to that end they have to acquire a new valuation of themselves by virtue of which they can condemn life in this highest plenitude, and where possible destroy it. A tendency hostile to life is therefore characteristic of morality, in so far as it wants to overpower the types of life.

898 (Spring-Fall 1887)

The strong of the future. That which partly necessity, partly chance has achieved here and there, the conditions for the production of a stronger type, we are now able to comprehend and consciously will: we are able to create the conditions under which such an elevation is possible.

Until now, "education" has had in view the needs of society: not the possible needs of the future, but the needs of the society of the day. One desired to produce "tools" for it. Assuming the wealth of force were greater, one could imagine forces being subtracted, not to serve the needs of society but some future need.

Such a task would have to be posed the more it was grasped to what extent the contemporary form of society was being so powerfully transformed that at some future time it would be unable to exist for its own sake alone, but only as a tool in the hands of a stronger race.

The increasing dwarfing of man is precisely the driving force that brings to mind the breeding of a stronger race-a race that would be excessive precisely where the dwarfed species was weak

478

THE WILL TO POWER

and growing weaker (in will, responsibility, self-assurance, ability to posit goals for oneself).

The means would be those history teaches: isolation through interests in preservation that are the reverse of those which are average today; habituation to reverse evaluations; distance as a pathos; a free conscience in those things that today are most under valued and prohibited.

The homogenizing of European man is the great process that cannot be obstructed: one should even hasten it. The necessity to create a gulf, distance, order of rank, is given eo ipso not the necessity to retard this process.

As soon as it is established, this homogenizing species requires a justification: it lies in serving a higher sovereign species that stands upon the former and can raise itself to its task only by doing this. Not merely a master race whose sole task is to rule, but a race with its own sphere of life, with an excess of strength for beauty, bravery, culture, manners to the highest peak of the spirit; an affirming race that may grant itself every great luxury strong enough to have no need of the tyranny of the virtue imperative, rich enough to have no need of thrift and pedantry, beyond good and evil; a hothouse for strange and choice plants.

Main consideration; not to see the task of the higher species in leading the lower (as, e.g., Comte does), but the lower as a base upon which higher species performs its own tasks--- upon which alone it can stand.

The conditions under which a strong and noble species main tains itself (regarding spiritual discipline) are the reverse of those which govern the "industrial masses," the shopkeepers à la Spencer,

That which is available only to the strongest and most fruit ful natures and makes their existence possible-leisure, adventure, disbelief, even dissipation--would, if it were available to mediocre natures, necessarily destroy them and actually does. This is where industriousness, rule, moderation, firm "conviction" have their place-in short, the "herd virtues”: under them this intermediate type of man grows perfect.

The strong man, mighty in the instincts of a powerful health, digests his deeds in just the same way as he digests his meals; he can cope even with heavy food: in the main, however, he is led by a faultless and severe instinct into doing nothing that disagrees with him, just as he eats nothing he does not enjoy.

The happiness and self-contentment of the Lazzaroni16 or the "bliss" of "beautiful souls" or the consumptive love of Herrn huteristic17 pietists prove nothing regarding order of rank among men. As a great educator, one would have to scourge such a race of "blessed people" mercilessly into unhappiness. The danger of dwarfing, of relaxation is present at once:-against Spinozistic or Epicurean happiness and against all relaxation in contemplative states. But if virtue is the means to such a happiness, very well, then one has to become master over virtue, too.

912 (March-June 1888)

I absolutely cannot see how one can later make up for having failed to go to a good school at the proper time. Such a man does not know himself; he walks through life without having learned to walk; his flabby muscles reveal themselves with every step. Sometimes life is so merciful as to offer this hard schooling once more later: sickness for years perhaps, that demands the most extreme strength of will and self-sufficiency; or a sudden calamity, affecting also one's wife and child, that compels one to a form of activity that restores energy to the slack fibers and toughness to the will to live. The most desirable thing is still under all circumstances a hard discipline at the proper time, i.e., at that age at which it still makes one proud to see that much is de manded of one. For this is what distinguishes the hard school as a good school from all others that much is demanded; and sternly demanded; that the good, even the exceptional, is demanded as the norm; that praise is rare, that indulgence is nonexistent; that blame is apportioned sharply, objectively, without regard for talent or antecedents.

One needs such a school from every point of view: that

The same discipline makes both the good soldier and the good scholar; and looked at more closely, there is no good scholar who does not have the instincts of a good soldier in his makeup. To be able to command and also proudly to obey; to stand in the ranks, but also capable at any time of leading; to prefer danger to comfort; not to weigh the permitted and the forbidden on a shopkeeper's scales; to be a foe more of the petty, sly, parasitic, than of the evil.- What does one learn in a hard school?

I also want to make asceticism natural again: in place of the aim of denial, the aim of strengthening; a gymnastics of the will; abstinence and periods of fasting of all kinds, in the most spiritual realm, too; a casuistry of deeds in regard to the opinions we have regarding our strengths; an experiment with adventures and arbitrary dangers.

1. asceticism: one has hardly the courage so far to display its natural utility, its indispensability in the service of the education of the will. Our absurd pedagogic world, before which the "useful civil servant" hovers as a model, thinks it can get by with "in struction," with brain drill; it has not the slightest idea that something else is needed first-education of will power; one devises tests for everything except for the main thing: whether one can will, whether one may promise; the young man finishes school without a single question, without any curiosity even, con cerning this supreme value-problem of his nature;

2. fasting: in every senseeven as a means of preserving the delicacy of one's ability to enjoy all good things (e.g., occasion ally to stop reading, listening to music, being pleasant; one must have fast days for one's virtues, too);

3. the "monastery": temporary isolation, accompanied by strict refusal, e.g., of letters; a kind of most profound self-reflection and self-recovery that desires to avoid, not "temptations,” but "duties": an escape from the daily round; a detachment from the tyranny of stimuli and influences that condemns us to spend our strength in nothing but reactions and does not permit their accu mulation to the point of spontaneous activity (one should observe our scholars from close up: they think only reactively, i.e., they have to read before they can think);

4. feasts: One has to be very coarse in order not to feel the presence of Christians and Christian values as an oppression beneath which all genuine festive feelings go to the devil. Feasts include: pride, exuberance, wantonness; mockery of everything serious and Philistine; a divine affirmation of oneself out of animal plenitude and perfection-one and all states which the Christian cannot honestly welcome. The feast is paganism par excellence;

To feel stronger-or in other words, joy-always presupposes a comparison (but not necessarily with others, but with oneself in the midst of a state of growth and without one's first knowing in how far one is making comparisons-).

Artificial strengthening: whether by stimulating chemicals or by stimulating errors ("delusions"):

e.g., the feeling of security such as a Christian possesses; he feels strong in being able to trust, to be patient and composed: he owes this artificial strength to the illusion of being protected by a god;

e.g., the feeling of superiority: as when the caliph of Morocco is allowed to see only globes upon which his three united kingdoms occupy four-fifths of the surface;

e.g., the feeling of uniqueness: as when the European imagines that the march of culture takes place in Europe, and when he seems to himself to be a kind of abridged world process, or when the Christian makes all existence in general revolve around the "salvation of man."

It is a question of where one feels the pressure, the con straint: according to where this is, a different feeling of being stronger will be produced. A philosopher, e.g., feels in the midst of the coolest, most transmontane abstraction acrobatics like a fish in water, while colors and tones oppress him; to say nothing of the dim desires that which others call "the ideal."

918 (Jan.-Fall 1888) One would make a fit little boy stare if one asked him: "Would you like to become virtuous?"- but he will open his eyes wide if asked: "Would you like to become stronger than your friends?"

Beware of the good-natured! Association with them makes one languid. All associations are good that make one practice the weapons of defense and offense that reside in one's instincts. All one's inventiveness toward testing one's strength of will- To see the distinguishing feature in this, and not in knowledge, astuteness, wit.

One must learn in time to command just as much as to obey, One must learn modesty, tact in modesty: that is, to confer distinction and to honor by being modest; the same with trust to confer distinction, to honor.

For what does one have to atone most? For one's modesty; for having failed to listen to one's most personal requirements; for having mistaken oneself; for having underestimated oneself; for having lost a good ear for one's instincts: this lack of reverence for oneself revenges itself through every kind of deprivation: health, friendship, well-being, pride, cheerfulness, freedom, firm ness, courage. One never afterward forgives oneself for this lack of genuine egoism: one takes it for an objection, for a doubt about a real ego.

Marginal note on a niaiserie anglaise 22- "Do not unto others what you would not have them do unto you." That counts as wisdom; that counts as prudence; that counts as the basis of morality-as the "golden rule." John Stuart Mill believes in it (and what Englishman does not?) But this rule does not brook the slightest attack. The calculation, "do nothing that ought not to be done to you," prohibits actions on account of their harm ful consequences: the concealed premise is that an action will always be requited. But what if someone holding the Principe23 in his hand were to say: "It is precisely such actions that one must perform, to prevent others from performing them first to deprive others of the chance to perform them on us"?

Nonetheless, the rule is valuable because it betrays a type of man: it is the instinct of the herd that finds its formula in this Tule---ope is equal, one takes oneself for equal: as I to you, thus you to me. Here there is a real belief in an equivalence of actions that in all actual circumstances simply does not exist. Not every action can be returned: between actual "individuals" there are no equal actions, consequently no "requital" - When I do something, I am very far from thinking that anyone else can do much the same: it belongs to me- One cannot pay me back, it will always be another" action that is perpetrated against me.

926 (Nov. 1887-March 1888)

Against John Stuart Mill.- I abhor his vulgarity, which says: "What is right for one is fair for another"; "what you would not, etc., do not unto others'; which wants to establish all human intercourse on the basis of mutual services, so that every action appears as a kind of payment for something done to us. The presupposition here is ignoble in the lowest sense: here an equiv alence of value between my actions and yours is presupposed; here the most personal value of an action is simply annulled (that which cannot be balanced or paid in any way.--).

"Reciprocity" is a piece of gross vulgarity; precisely that something I do may not and could not be done by another, that no balance is possible (except in the most select sphere of "my equals," inter pares ), that in a deeper sense one never gives back, because one is something unique and does only unique things—this fundamental conviction contains the cause of aristocratic segregation from the masses, because the masses be lieve in "equality" and consequently in equivalence and "reci procity."

928 (Nov. 1887-March 1888).

"Should one follow one's feelings?"-That one should put one's life in danger, yielding to a generous feeling and under the impulse of a moment, that is of little value and does not even characterize one. Everyone is equally capable of that—and in this resolution, a criminal, a bandit, and a Corsican certainly excel decent people.

A higher stage is; to overcome even this pressure within us and to perform a heroic act not on impulse--but coldly, raisonnable, without being overwhelmed by stormy feelings of pleasure. The same applies to compassion: it must first be habitually sifted by reason; otherwise it is just as dangerous as any other affect.

Blind indulgence of an affect, totally regardless of whether it be a generous and compassionate or a hostile affect, is the cause of the greatest evils.

Greatness of character does not consist in not possessing these affects on the contrary, one possesses them to the highest degree-but in having them under control. And even that without any pleasure in this restraint, but merely because

If one has the temperament, one instinctively chooses what is dangerous; e.g., adventures in speculation if one is a philosopher; or in immorality if one is

virtuous. One kind of man will risk nothing, another wants risks. Are we others despisers of life? On the contrary, we seek life raised to a higher power, life lived in danger - 24 But that, to repeat it, does not mean we want to be more virtuous than others. Pascal, e.g., wanted to risk nothing25 and remained a Christian: perhaps that was virtuous. One always makes sacrifices.

930 (Nov. 1887-March 1888)

How much advantage man sacrifices, how little "self-in terested” he is! All his affects and passions demand their rights— and how remote from the prudent utility of self-interest is an affect!

One does not desire "happiness"; one must be English to be able to believe that man always seeks his advantage 26 Our desires want to violate things with a protracted. passion—their accumulated strength seeks resistance.

931 (Spring-Fall 1887) The affects are one and all useful, some directly, others indirectly; in regard to utility, it is quite impossible to fix any scale of valueseven though in economic terms the forces of nature are one and all good, i.e., useful, and also the source of so much terrible and irrevocable fatality. The most one could say is that the most powerful affects are the most valuable, in as much as there are no greater sources of strength.

Il n'a guère vu que la crainte du risque, il n'a pas vu le plaisir du risque." (There is in the wager of Pascal an element he did not make clear. He saw only the fear of risk, he did not see the pleasure of risk.)

THE WILL. TO POWER

932 (Spring-Fall 1887) Well-meaning, helpful, good-natured attitudes of mind have not come to be honored on account of their usefulness, but because they are states of richer souls that are capable of bestowing and have their value in the feeling of the plenitude of life. Observe the eyes of benefactors: what one sees is the antithesis of self denial, of hatred for the moi, of "Pascalism."

933 (Spring-Fall 1887)

In Summa: domination of the passions, not their weakening or extirpation! The greater the dominating power of a will, the more freedom may the passions be allowed.

The "great man" is great owing to the free play and scope of his desires and to the yet greater power that knows how to press these magnificent monsters into service,

The "good man" is at every stage of civilization the harmless and the useful combined: a kind of mean; the expression of the general consciousness of the kind of man whom one has no reason to fear but whom one must nonetheless not despise.

Education essentially the means of ruining the exceptions for the good of the rule 27 Higher education:28. essentially the means of directing taste against the exceptions for the good of the mediocre.

Only when a culture has an excess of powers at its disposal can it also constitute a hothouse for the luxury cultivation of the exception, the experiment, of danger, of the nuance:--this is the tendency of every aristocratic culture.

934 (Spring-Fall 1887)

Nothing but questions of strength: how far to prevail against the conditions that preserve society and against its prejudices? how far to unchain one's terrible qualities through which most people perish? how far to oppose truth and reflect on its most

questionable sides?-how far to oppose suffering, self-contempt, pity, sickness, vice, with the query as to whether one cannot become master of them? (What does not destroy us makes us stronger20.-)..finally: how far to acknowledge in one's mind the rule, the commonplace, the petty, good, upright, the average nature, without letting oneself be vulgarized by them?- Hardest test of character: not to let oneself be ruined through seduction by the good. The good as luxury, as subtlety, 30 as vice.

936 (Nov, 1887-March 1888)

Aristocracy. Herd-animal ideals. Now culminating as the highest value standard of "society": attempt to give them a cosmic, even a metaphysical value.- Against them I defend aristocracy.

A society that preserves a regard and delicatesse for freedom must feel itself to be an exception and must confront a power from which it distinguishes itself, toward which it is hostile, and on which it looks down.

The more I relinquish my rights and level myself down, the more I come under the dominion of the average and finally of the majority. The presupposition inherent in an aristocratic society for preserving a high degree of freedom among its members is the extreme tension that arises from the presence of an antagonistic drive in all its members; the will to dominate

Toward a true psychology of the society based on freedom and equality- What diminishes?.

The will to self-responsibility, sign of the decline of autonomy; efficiency in defense and attack, also in the most spiritual things: the power of commanding; the sense of reverence, subservience, ability to keep silent; great passion, the great task, tragedy, cheer fulness.

937 (Spring-Fall 1887) Augustin Thierry read in 1814, what De Montlosier had said in his work De la monarchie française: he answered with a cry of indignation and commenced his work. That emigrant had said: Race d'affranchis, race d'esclaves arrachés de nos mains, peuple tributaire, peuple nouveau, licence vous fut octroyée d'être libres, et non pas à nous d'être nobles; pour nous tout est de droit, pour vous tout est de grâce, nous ne sommes point de votre communauté; nous sommes un tout par nous-mêmes.82

938 (1884)

How the aristocratic world increasingly bleeds itself and makes itself weaker! Because of the nobility of its instincts it throws away its privileges and because of the refinement of its hyper-culture it takes an interest in the people, the weak, the poor, the poetry of the petty, etc.

939 (1885-1886)

There is a noble and dangerous carelessness that permits a profound inference and insight: the carelessness of the self-assured and overrich soul that has never troubled about friends but knows only hospitality, and practices, and knows how to practice,

* "Tribe of freedmen, tribes of slaves torn from our hands, tributary people, new people, license has been granted to you to be free, but not to us to be noble; for us everything is a right, for you everything is a matter of grace; we are not part of your community; we are entire by ourselves."


(p495)



only hospitality-heart and home open to anyone who cares to enter, whether beggar or cripple or king. This is genuine geniality: whoever has that, has a hundred "friends" but in all probability not a single friend.

940 (1884)

The teaching mêden agan38 applies to men of overflowing strength-not to the mediocre. The enkrateia34 and askēsis35 is only a stage toward the heights: the "golden nature" is higher.

"Thou shalt"_unconditional obedience in Stoics, in the Christian and Arab orders, in the philosophy of Kant (it is im material whether to a superior or to a concept).

Higher than "thou shalt" is "I will” (the heroes); higher than "I will" stands: "I am" (the gods of the Greeks).

The barbarian gods express nothing of the pleasure of re straint--are neither simple nor frivolous nor moderate.

941 (Summer-Fall 1883)

The meaning of our gardens and palaces (and to this extent also the meaning of all desire for riches) is: to remove disorder and vulgarity from sight and to build a home for nobility of soul.

The majority, to be sure, believe they will acquire higher natures when those beautiful, peaceful objects have operated upon them: hence the rush to go to Italy and on travels, etc.; all reading and visits to theatres. They want to have themselves formed that is the meaning of their cultural activity! But the strong, the mighty want to form and no longer to have anything foreign about them!

Thus men also plunge into wild nature, not to find themselves but to lose and forget themselves in it. "To be outside oneself as the desire of all the weak and the self-discontented.

THE WILL TO POWER not speaking here of the little word "von" or of the Almanach de Gotha:38 parenthesis for asses.) When one speaks of "aristocrats of the spirit," reasons are usually not lacking for concealing some thing; as is well known, it is a favorite term among ambitious Jews. For spirit alone does not make noble; rather, there must be something to ennoble the spirit. What then is required? Blood.37

943 (1885)

What is noble?38

-Care for the most external things, in so far as this care forms a boundary, keeps distant, guards against confusion.

- Apparent frivolity in word, dress, bearing, through which a stoic severity and self-constraint protects itself against all im modest inquisitiveness.

Slowness of gesture, and of glance. There are not too many valuable things: and these come and wish to come of themselves to the valuable man. We do not easily admire.

-Endurance of poverty and want, also of sickness.

-Avoidance of petty honors and mistrust of all who praise readily: for whoever praises believes he understands what he praises: but to understand...Balzac, that typical man of ambition, has revealed it--comprendre c'est égaler 39

-Our doubt as to the communicability of the heart goes deep; solitude not as chosen but as given.

-The conviction that one has duties only to one's equals, toward the others one acts as one thinks best: that justice can

(Encyclopaedia Britannica, 11th ed., vol. I, p. 712). The word von is the mark of nobility in this sense, and when Friedrich Schiller, for example, was elevated to the nobility his name became Friedrich von Schiller.

37 When Heinrich Härtle quoted this note in Nietzsche und der National sozialismus (Eher, Zentralverlag der NSDAP, Munich 1937), p. 55, he omitted the "parenthesis for asses," without indicating that anything had been omitted. This was entirely typical of the Nazis' use of Nietzsche. For a discussion of this note, see my Nietzsche, Chapter 10, near the end

be hoped for (unfortunately not counted on) only inter pares.40

An ironic response to the "talented," the belief in a nobility by birth in moral matters too.

-Always to experience oneself as one who bestows honors, while there are not many fit to honor one.

Always disguised: the higher the type, the more a man requires an incognito. If God existed, he would, merely on grounds of decency, be obliged to show himself to the world only as a man.

-The ability for otium,t the unconditional conviction that although a craft in any sense does not dishonor, it certainly takes away nobility. No "industriousness" in the bourgeois sense, how ever well we may know how to honor and reward it, or like those insatiably cackling artists who act like hens, cackle and lay eggs and cackle again.

-We protect artists and poets and those who are masters in anything; but as natures that are of a higher kind than these, who have only the ability to do something, merely "productive inen," we do not confound ourselves with them.

--Pleasure in forms; taking under protection everything formal, the conviction that politeness is one of the greatest virtues; mistrust for letting oneself go in any way, including all freedom of press and thought, because under them the spirit grows com fortable and doltish and relaxes its limbs.

Delight in women, as in a perhaps smaller but more deli cate and ethereal kind of creature. What joy to encounter creatures who have only dancing, foolishness, and finery in their heads! They have been the delight of every very tense and profound male soul whose life was weighed down with great responsibilities.

--Pleasure in princes and priests, because they preserve the belief in differences in human values even in the valuation of the past, at least symbolically and on the whole even actually.

--Ability to keep silent: but not a word about that in the presence of listeners.

-Endurance of protracted enmities: lack of easy recon cilability.

* Among equals. But see The Antichrist, which is later: "When the ex ceptional human being treats the mediocre more tenderly than himself and his peers, this is not mere courtesy of the heart-it is simply his duty" (section 57; Portable Nietzsche, p. 647).

THE WILL TO POWER

-Disgust for the demagogic, for the "enlightenment," for "being cozy,"42 for plebeian familiarity.

---The collection of precious things, the needs of a high and fastidious soul; to desire to possess nothing in common. One's own books, one's own landscapes.

-We rebel against experiences, good and bad, and are slow to generalize. The individual case: how ironic we feel toward the individual case if it has the bad taste to pose as the rule!

-We love the naive and naive people, but as spectators and higher natures; we find Faust just as naive as his Gretchen.

We esteem the good very little, as herd animals: we know that in the worst, most malignant, hardest men a priceless golden drop of goodness is often concealed, that outweighs all mere benevolence of milk souls.

-We consider that a man of our kind is not refuted by his vices, por by his follies. We know that we are hard to recognize, and that we have every reason to give ourselves foregrounds.

944 (Jan-Fall 1888)

What is noble? - That one constantly has to play a part. That one seeks situations in which one has constant need of poses. That one leaves happiness to the great majority: happiness as peace of soul, virtue, comfort, Anglo-angelic shopkeeperdom à la Spen cer. That one instinctively seeks heavy responsibilities. That one knows how to make enemies everywhere, if the worst comes to the worst even of oneself. That one constantly contradicts the great majority not through words but through deeds.

945 (1886-1887)

Virtue (e.g., in the form of truthfulness) as our noble and dangerous luxury; we must not refuse the disadvantages it brings with it.

To desire no praise: one does what profits one, or what gives one pleasure, or what one must.

What is chastity in a man? That his sexual taste has remained noble; that in eroticis he likes neither the brutal nor the morbid nor the prudent.

948 (Nov. 1887-March 1888) The "concept of honor": resting on the faith in "good society," in chivalrous basic traits, in the obligation continually to maintain poise. Essentiaf: that one does not think one's life important; that one insists unconditionally on good manners on the part of every one with whom one comes in contact (at least, when they do not belong to "us"); that one is neither familar, nor genial, nor merry, nor modest, except inter pares; that one always maintains poise.

949 (Nov. 1887-March 1888)

That one stakes one's life, one's health, one's honor, is the consequence of high spirits and an overflowing, prodigal will: not from love of man but because every great danger challenges our curiosity about the degree of our strength and our courage.

Then a host of virtues are superseded that had been conditions of existence. - Qualities no longer needed are lost.

of those who have a right to such questionable questions, the strongest souls of today, whose best control is over themselves: is it not time, now that the type "herd animal" is being evolved more and more in Europe, to make the experiment of a fundamental, artificial and conscious breeding of the opposite type and its virtues? And would it not be a kind of goal, redemption, and justification for the democratic movement itself if someone arrived who could make use of it-by finally producing beside its new and sublime development of slavery (-that is what European democracy müst become ultimately) a higher kind of dominating and Caesarian spirits who would stand upon it, maintain themselves by it, and elevate themselves through it? To new, hitherto impos sible prospects, to their own prospects? To their own tasks?

955 (1885)

To view the contemporary European makes me very hopeful: an audacious ruling race is developing on the basis of an extremely intelligent herd mass. It will not be long before the movement for the cultivation of the latter will no longer have the foreground all to itself.

956 (1885)

The same conditions that hasten the evolution of the herd animal also hasten the evolution of the leader animal.

Inexorably, hesitantly, terrible as fate, the great task and question is approaching: how shall the earth as a whole be gov crned? And to what end shall "man" as a whole--and no longer as. a people, a race-be raised and trained?

Law-giving moralities are the principal means of fashioning man according to the pleasure of a creative and profound will, provided that such an artist's will of the first rank has the power in its hands and can make its creative will prevail through long periods of time, in the form of laws, religions, and customs. Such men of great creativity, the really great men according to my under standing, will be sought in vain today and probably for a long

time to come: they are lacking; until, after much disappointment, one must begin to comprehend why they are lacking and that nothing stands more malignantly in the way of their rise and evolu tion, today and for a long time to come, than what in Europe today is called simply "morality"-as if there were no other morality and could be no other the aforementioned herd-animal morality which is striving with all its power44 for a universal green-pasture happiness on earth, namely for security, absence of danger, comfort, the easy life, and ultimately, if all goes well," hopes to do away with any kind of shepherd or bellwhether. The two doctrines it preaches most often are: "equal rights" and "sympathy with all that suffers!' -and it takes suffering itself to be something that must absolutely be abolished. That such rideas as these are still modern gives one a bad opinion of modernity.

Whoever has thought profoundly about where and how the plant man has hitherto grown most vigorously must conclude that this has happened under the reverse conditions: that the danger ousness of his situation must grow to tremendous proportions, that his power of invention and dissembling must struggle up be neath protracted oppression and compulsion, that his will to live must be enhanced to an unconditional will to power and to over power, and that danger, severity, violence, danger in the street as well as in the heart, inequality of rights, concealment, stoicism, the art of experiment, devilry of all kinds, in short the opposite of all the herd thinks desirable, are necessary for the elevation of the type man. A morality with such reverse intentions, which desires to train men for the heights, not for comfort and mediocrity, a morality with the intention of training a ruling caste---the future masters of the earth-must, if it is to be taught, appear in as sociation with the prevailing moral laws, in the guise of their terms and forms. That for this, however, many transitional means of deception must be devised, and that, because the lifetime of a single man signifies virtually nothing in relation to the accomplish ment of such protracted tasks and aims, the very first thing to be done is the rearing of a new kind of man, in whom the duration of the necessary will and the necessary instinct will be guaranteed through many generations-a new master type and caste-all this

is as obvious as is the protracted and not easily expressible etcetera of this idea.

To prepare a reversal of values for a certain strong kind of man of the highest spirituality and strength of will and to this end slowly and cautiously to unfetter a host of instincts now kept in check and calumniated whoever reflects on this becomes one of us, the free spirits-to be sure, a different kind of free spirit" from those before us; for the latter wanted approximately the op posite of what we do. To us, it seems to me, belong above all the pessimists of Europe, the poets and thinkers of an enraged idealism, in so far as their discontent with all existence involved them at least by logical necessity in a discontent with present-day man; also certain insatiably ambitious artists who unhesitatingly and unconditionally fight for the special rights of higher men and against the "herd animal" and who, by means of the seductions of art, lull to sleep all herd instincts and herd cautiousness in choice spirits; thirdly and finally all those critics and historians who courageously carry forward the happily-begun discovery of the world of anti quity-it is the work of the new Columbus, the German spirit (for we still stand at the beginning of this conquest). For in the world of antiquity there reigned a different, more lordly morality than today; and the man of antiquity, raised in this morality, was a stronger and deeper man than the man of today—he alone has hitherto been "the man that has turned out well." But the seductive power that antiquity exercises on such well-turned-out, i.e., strong and enterprising, souls is the most subtle and effective of all anti democratic and anti-Christian influences even today, as at the time of the Renaissance.

962 (1885)

A great man a man whom nature has constructed and in vented in the grand style. what is he?

First: there is a long logic in all of his activity, hard to survey because of its length, and consequently misleading; he has the ability to extend his will across great stretches of his life and to despise and reject everything petty about him, including even the fairest, "divinest" things in the world.

Secondly: he is colder, harder, less hesitating, and without fear of "opinion"; he lacks the virtues that accompany respect and "respectability," and altogether everything that is part of the "virtue of the herd.” If he cannot lead, he goes alone; then it can happen that he may snarl at some things he meets on his way.

Third: he wants no "sympathetic" heart, but servants, tools; in his intercourse with men he is always intent on making some thing out of them. He knows he is incommunicable: he finds it tasteless to be familiar; and when one thinks he is, he usually is not. When not speaking to himself, he wears a mask. He rather lies than tells the truth: it requires more spirit and will.47 There is a solitude within him that is inaccessible to praise or blame, his own justice that is beyond appeal.

963 (Spring-Fall 1887)

The great man is necessarily a skeptic48 (which is not to say that he has to appear to be one), provided that greatness consists in this: to will something great and the means to it. Freedom from any kind of conviction is part of the strengh of his will. Thus it accords with that "englightened despotism" exercised by every great passion. Such a passion takes the intellect into its service; it has the courage even for unholy means; it removes scruples; it permits itself convictions, it even needs them, but it does not submit to them. The need for faith, for anything unconditional

14 The theme of the mask and the need for masks is more fully developed in Beyond Good and Evil. For the many relevant passages see the index to my translation (New York: Vintage Books, 1966).

This note was put to use in The Antichrist, section 54 (Portable Nietz sche, pp. 638-39).506

THE WILL TO POWER in Yes and No, is a proof of weakness; all weakness is weakness of will. The man of faith, the believer, is necessarily a small type of man. Hence "freedom of spirit," i.e., unbelief as an instinct [is a precondition of greatness.]49

964 (1884)

The great man feels his power over a people, his temporary coincidence with a people or a millenium; this enlargement in his experience of himself as causa and voluntas is misunderstood as "altruism"; it drives him to seek means of communication: all great men are inventive in such means. They want to embed themselves in great communities, they want to give a single form to the multifarious and disordered; chaos stimulates them.

Misunderstanding of love. There is a slavish love that submits and gives itself; that idealizes, and deceives itself—there is a divine love that despises and loves, and reshapes and elevates the beloved.

To gain that tremendous energy of greatness in order to shape the man of the future through breeding and, on the other hand, the annihilation of millions of failures, and not to perish of the suffering one creates, though nothing like it has ever existed!

965 (1884) The revolution, confusion, and distress of peoples is, in my view, inferior to the distress of great individuals during their development. One must not let oneself be deceived: the many distresses of all the small constitute a sum only in the feelings of powerful human beings. To think of oneself in moments of great danger, to derive advantage from the disadvantage of many: this can be, in the case of a very high degree of deviation, a sign of a great character who manages to master his compassionate and just impulses.

Thus a drive as master, its opposite weakened, refined, as the impulse that provides the stimulus for the activity of the chief drive.

The highest man would have the greatest multiplicity of drives, in the relatively greatest strength that can be endured. Indeed, where the plant "man" shows himself strongest one finds instincts that conflict powerfully (e.g., in Shakespeare), but are controlled.

967 (1885)

Whether one does not have the right to account all great men evil? This cannot be shown in a pure state in all individual cases. Often they have been capable of masterly dissimulation and assumed the outward forms and gestures of great virtues. Often they honored virtue seriously and with a passionate hard ness against themselves, but out of cruelty: seen from a distance, this is deceptive. Many misunderstood themselves; not infrequently a great task calls forth great qualities, e.g., justice. The essential point is: the greatest perhaps also possess great virtues, but in that case also their opposites. I believe that it is precisely through the presence of opposites and the feelings they occasion that the great man, the bow with the great tension, develops.

968 (1886-1887)

In great men, the specific qualities of life injustice, false hood, exploitation-are at their greatest. But in so far as they have had an overwhelming effect, their essence has been most misunderstood and interpreted as goodness. Type: Carlyle as interpreter.50

to Cutting remarks about Carlyle are also found in The Gay Science, section 97 ("Garrulity from inner satisfaction with noise and confused feelings; e.g., in Carlyle"); in Beyond Good and Evil, section 252; in Twi light, "Skirmishes," sections 1 and 12 (he is also mentioned in section 44); in The Antichrist, section 54; and in sections 27, 312, 343, 455, 747 above.

THE WILL TO POWER

969 (Spring-Fall 1887)

In general, every thing is worth as much as one has paid for it. This does not hold, to be sure, if one takes the individual in isolation; the great capabilities of the individual are utterly out of proportion to what he himself has done, sacrificed, and suffered for them. But if one considers his family history, one discovers the history of a tremendous storing up and capital accumulation of strength through all kinds of renunciation, struggle, work, and prevailing. It is because the great man has cost so much, and not because he appears as a miracle and gift of heaven and "chance," that he has become great: "heredity" a false concept. One's forebears have paid the price for what one is.

970 (1883-1888)

Danger in modesty.---- To adapt ourselves too early to the tasks, societies, everyday life and everyday work, in which chance has placed us, at a time when neither our strength nor our goal has yet entered our consciousness with the force of law; the all too-early certainty of conscience, comfortableness, sociability thus achieved, this premature resignation that insinuates itself into our feelings as a release from inner and outer unrest, pampers and holds one back in the most dangerous fashion. To learn to feel respect after the fashion of those like us," as if we ourselves had no measure in us and no right to determine values; the effort to evaluate as others do, against the inner voice of our taste, which is also a form of conscience, becomes a terrible, subtle constraint: if there is not finally an explosion, with a sudden bursting asunder of all the bonds of love and morality, then such a spirit becomes withered, petty, effeminate, and factual.

The opposite is bad enough, but better nonetheless: to suffer from one's environment, from its praise as well as from its blame, wounded by it and festering inwardly without betraying the fact; to defend oneself with involuntary mistrust against its love, to learn silence, perhaps concealing it behind speech,51 to create for oneself nooks and undiscoverable solitudes for moments of relief,

of tears, of sublime consolation-until one is finally strong enough to say, "what do I have to do with you?" and to go one's own way.

971 (Nov. 1887-March 1888)

Men who are destinies, who by bearing themselves bear destinies, the whole species of heroic bearers of burdens: oh how they would like to rest from themselves for once! how they thirst for strong hearts and necks, so as to be free from what oppresses them, at least for a few hours! And how vainly they thirst! - They wait; they look at everything that passes; no one approaches them with as much as a thousandth part of their suffering and passion, 63 no one divines in what way they are waiting-At length, at length they learn their first piece of worldly prudence-not to wait any more; and soon another one: to be genial, to be modest, from now on to endure everyone, to endure everything-in short, to endure even a little more than they have endured so far.

6. The Highest Man as Legislator

of the Future

97204 (1884)

Legislators of the future. After having tried in vain for a long time to attach a definite concept to the word "philosopher" for I found many contradictory characteristics I recognized at last that there are two distinct kinds of philosopher:

1. those who want to ascertain a complex fact of evaluations (logical or moral);

2. those who are legislators of such evaluations.

The former try to master the world of the present or the past by concentrating and abridging the multiplicity of events through signs: their aim is to make previous events surveyable,

* Leiden. * Leidenschaft.

According to 1911, p. 513, this section was composed by the editor from two drafts, but Schlechta, too, follows all previous editions in printing it as a single note. Roughly the first half of this material was put to use in Beyond Good and Evil, section 211.

510

THE WILL TO POWER comprehensible, graspable, and usable they assist the task of man to employ all past things for the benefit of his future.

The latter, however, are commanders; they say: "Thus it shall be!" They alone determine the "whither" and the "wherefore," what is useful and what constitutes utility for men; they dispose of the preparatory work of scientific men, and all knowledge is for them only a means for creation. This second kind of philosopher rarely prospers; and their situation and danger is indeed fearful. How often they have deliberately blindfolded themselves simply so as not to have to behold the narrow ledge that separates them from a plunge into the abyss; e.g., Plato, when he convinced himself that the "good" as he desired it was not the good of Plato but the "good in itself," the eternal treasure that some man, named Plato, had chanced to discover on his way! This same will to blindness dominates the founders of religions in a much coarser form: theit "thou shalt" must not by any means sound in their ears like "I will they dare to fulfill their task only as the command of a god; only as an "inspiration" is their value legislation a bearable burden under which their conscience is not crushed.

As soon as these two means of comfort, that of Plato and that of Mohammed, have fallen away and no thinker can relieve his conscience with the hypothesis of a "god" or "eternal values," the claim of the legislator of new values rises to a new fearfulness never yet attained. From then on, those elect on whom the suspicion of having such a duty begins to dawn, try to see if they cannot, "at the right moment," elude it, as their greatest danger, through some kind of detour; for example, by convincing themselves that the task has already been accomplished, or cannot be accomplished, or that their shoulders are not strong enough for such burdens, or that they are already overburdened with other, more immediate tasks, or that even this new, distant duty is a seduction and temptation, drawing them away from all other duties, a sickness, a kind of madness. Many may indeed succeed in eluding it: history is full of the traces of men who have eluded this task, and of their bad consciences. Usually, however, there came to these men of fate that redeeming hour, that autumnal hour of ripeness, in which they had to do what they did not even "want to do and the deed of which they had hitherto been most afraid fell easily and unsought from the tree, as an involuntary deed, almost as a gift.

973 (1885)

The human horizon. One can conceive philosophers as those who make the most extreme efforts to test how far man could elevate himself-- Plato especially: how far his strength will reach. But they do it as individuals; perhaps the instinct of the Caesars, of founders of states, etc., was greater, as they pondered how far man might be driven in his evolution and under "favorable con ditions." But they had an insufficient understanding of the nature of favorable circumstances. Great question: where has the plant "man" hitherto grown up most magnificently? For this question the study of comparative history is necessary.

974 (Fall 1888)

A fact, a work is eloquent in a new way for every age and every new type of man. History always enunciates new truths.

975 (1885-1886)

To remain objective, hard, firm, severe in carrying through an idea-artists succeed best in this; but when one needs men for this (as teachers, statesmen, etc., do), then the repose and coldness and hardness soon vanish. With natures like Caesar and Napoleon, one gets some notion of "disinterested" work on their marble, whatever the cost in men. On this road lies the future of the highest men: to bear the greatest responsibility and not collapse under it.— Hitherto, the delusions of inspiration were almost always needed in order not to lose one's faith in one's right and one's hand.

976 (1884)

Why the philosopher rarely turns out well. His requirements include qualities that usually destroy a man:

1. a tremendous multiplicity of qualities; he must be a brief

abstract of man, of all man's higher and lower desires:

danger from antitheses, also from disgust at himself; 2. he must be inquisitive in the most various directions:

danger of going to pieces;

3. he must be just and fair in the highest sense, but pro

found in love, hate (and injustice), too; 4. he must be not only a spectator, but also a legislator:

judge and judged (to the extent that he is a brief abstract

of the world); 5. extremely multifarious, yet firm and hard. Supple.

977 (1885)

The really royal calling of the philosopher (as expressed by Alcuin the Anglo-Saxon): prava corrigere, et recta corroborare, et sancta sublimare.55

978 (1885) The new philosopher can arise only in conjunction with a ruling caste, as its highest spiritualization. Great politics, rule over the earth, are at hand; complete lack of the principles that are needed.

979 (1885)

Fundamental thought: the new values must first be created we shall not be spared this task! For us the philosopher must be a legislator. New types. (How the highest types hitherto [e.g., Greeks) were reared: to will this type of "chance" consciously.)

980" (1885)

Assuming one thinks of a philosopher as a great educator, powerful enough to draw up to his lonely height a long chain of generations, then one must also grant him the uncanny privi leges of the great educator. An educator never says what he himself thinks, but always only what he thinks of a thing in relation to the requirements of those he educates. He must not be detected in this dissimulation; it is part of his mastery that one believes in his honesty. He must be capable of employing every mcans of discipline:37 some he can drive toward the heights only

* To correct what is wrong, and strengthen the right, and raise what is holy.

with the whips of scorn; others, who are slugglish, irresolute, cowardly, vain, perhaps only with exaggerated praise. Such an educator is beyond good and evil; but no one must know it.

981 (Spring-Fall 1887) Not to make men "better," not to preach morality to them in any form, as if "morality in itself," or any ideal kind of man, were given; but to create conditions that require stronger men who for their part need, and consequently will have, a morality (more clearly: a physical-spiritual discipline) that makes them strong!

Not to allow oneself to be misled by blue eyes or heaving bosoms: greatness of soul8 has nothing romantic about it. And unfortunately nothing at all amiable.

982 (1884) One must learn from war: (1) to associate death with the interests for which one fights that makes us venerable; (2) one must learn to sacrifice many and to take one's cause seriously enough not to spare men; (3) rigid discipline, and to permit one self force and cunning in war.

Education in those rulers' virtues that master even one's benevolence and pity: the great cultivator's virtues (“forgiving one's enemies" is child's play by comparison), the affect of the creator must be elevated no longer to work on marble! - The exceptional situation and powerful position of those beings (com pared with any prince hitherto): the Roman Caesar with Christ's soul.50

THE WILL TO POWER

984 (1884) Greatness of soul is inseparable from greatness of spirit. 60 For it involves independence; but in the absence of spiritual greatness, independence ought not to be allowed, it causes mischief, even through its desire to do good and practice "justice." Small spirits must obey-hence cannot possess greatness.

985 (1885)

The higher philosophical man, who has solitude not because he wishes to be alone but because he is something that finds no equals: what dangers and new sufferings have been reserved for him precisely today, when one has unlearned belief in order of rank and consequently does not know how to honor and under stand this solitude! Formerly the sage almost sanctified himself in the mind of the crowd by going apart in this way—today the hermit sees himself surrounded as if by a cloud of gloomy doubts and suspicions. And not merely on the part of the envious and

Christianity, translated by E. B. Ashton (Chicago, Henry Regnery, 1961), the end of the section on "Self-Identification with the Opponent"; and Kauf mann, "Jaspers Relation to Nietzsche," in From Shakespeare to Existen tialism (Garden City: Doubleday Anchor Books, 1960, p. 300). In a nutshell: for Jaspers this phrase represents one of the most amazing at tempts to bring together again into a higher unity what (Nietzsche] has first separated and opposed to each other..Nietzsche imagines without any power of vision and unrealizably the synthesis of the ultimate opposi tion." For me the same phrase represents "the very heart of Nietzsche's vision of the overman. Being capable of both sympathy and hardness, of loving and ruling, not using claws though having them ..."

"Seelengrösse nicht zu trennen von geistiger Grösse. This is one of the occasional passages in which it is tempting to translate Geist and geistig as intellect and intellectual; for these would come closer to Nietzsche's mean ing here. It is important to realize that when Nietzsche uses these terms he generally means neither spirit alone nor intellect alone but also mind, wit, and esprit. But if we used spirit in one passage, wit in another, intellect in a third, and mind elsewhere, something of considerable importance would be lost. It seems better to ask the reader to kep in mind what Geist means, and that "spirit" always stands for Geist.

This whole matter, of course, transcends philological niceties; what is at stake is one of the most crucial points of Nietzsche's philosophy: he was not an irrationalist. And all the men he most admired were, without excep tion, great intellects—but not merely great intellects. Cf. sections 876 f above.

wretched: he must sense misunderstanding, neglect, and super ficiality even in all benevolence shown him. He knows that crafty cunning of narrow-minded pity that feels itself good and holy when it tries to "save" him from himself, perhaps by means of more comfortable situations or more orderly, more reliable company—indeed, he will have to admire the unconscious instinct of destruction with which all the spiritually mediocre go to work against him, with a perfect faith in their right to do so!

It is necessary for these men of incomprehensible loneliness to wrap themselves vigorously and boldly in the cloak of external, spatial solitude, too; that is part of their prudence. Even cunning and disguise are needed today if such a man is to preserve him self, to keep himself aloft, in the midst of the dangerous, down dragging currents of the age. Every attempt to endure in the present, to endure the present, every approach to the men and aims of today, he will have to atone as if it were his own special sin; and he may marvel at the concealed wisdom of his nature that, after every such attempt, at once draws him back to himself by means of sickness and bad accidents.

The most difficult and highest form of man will succeed most rarely: thus the history of philosophy reveals a superabundance of failures, of accidents, and an extremely slow advance; whole mil lennia intervene and overwhelm what had been achieved; the continuity is broken again and again. It is an appalling history-- the history of the highest man, the sage.

* In the MS preceded by the words: "For the introduction." 1911, p. 513, it is pointed out that this note belongs to the same period as drafts for Beyond Good and Evil; but that in itself does not establish that the intro duction for that book was meant: Nietzsche was contemplating more than one project.516

THE WILL TO POWER What is most harmed is precisely the memory of the great, for the semi-failures and the failures misunderstand them and vanquish them by means of "successes." Every time "an influence" shows itself, a mob crowds upon the scene; the chatter of the petty and the poor in spirit is a terrible torment for the ears of those who remember with a shudder that the destiny of humanity depends upon the attainment of its highest type.

From my childhood I have pondered the conditions for the existence of the sage, and I will not conceal my joyous conviction that he is again becoming possible in Europe-perhaps only for a short time.

988 (1885)

We new philosophers, however, not only do we start by describing the actual order of rank and differences in the value of men, we also desire precisely the opposite of an assimilation, an equalization:03 we teach estrangement in every sense, we open up gulfs such as have never existed before, we desire that man should become more evil than he has ever been before. In the meantime, we are still strangers to and from one another. We have many reasons to be hermits and to put on masks—we shall therefore be poor at looking for those like us. We shall live alone and probably suffer the torments of all seven solitudes. But if we should come across one another, one may wager that we mistake or mutually deceive one another.

* Nietzsche originally began this note: "The new philosophers...." Then he changed this to read: "We new philosophers...." And he carried this through to the point indicated. Beyond that point, the editors changed the text to maintain consistency. The note was written in pencil and bears all the earmarks of haste (1911, p. 514).

990 (1885) I forgot to say that such philosophers are cheerful and that they like to sit in the abyss below a perfectly clear sky: they need different means from other men for enduring life; for they suffer differently (namely, as much from the profundity of their con tempt for man as from their love for man).- The most suffering animal on earth invented for itself laughter.

991 (1885-1886) On the misunderstanding of "cheerfulness." Temporary relief from a protracted tension; the high spirits, the saturnalia of a spirit that is dedicating and preparing itself for protracted and terrible decisions. The "fool" in the form of "science."

992 (March-June 1888)

New order of rank of spirits: the tragic natures no longer to the fore.

993 (1885)

It is a comfort to me to know that above the steam and filth of human lowlands there is a higher, brighter humanity, very small in number (for everything outstanding is by its nature rare): one belongs to it, not because one is more talented or more virtuous or more heroic or more loving than the men below, but because one is colder, brighter, more far-seeing, more solitary; because one endures, prefers, demands solitude as happiness, as privilege, indeed as a condition of existence; because one lives among clouds and lightning as among one's own kind, but equally among rays of sunlight, drops of dew, flakes of snow, and every thing that necessarily comes from the heights and, when it moves, moves eternally only in the direction from above to below. Aspirations toward the heights are not ours.-- Heroes, martyrs, geniuses and enthusiasts are not still, patient, subtle, cold, slow enough for us.

518

The WILL TO POWER

994 (Spring-Fall 1887) Absolute conviction: that value feelings above and below are different; that countless experiences are lacking in those below; that between below and above misunderstanding is necessary.

995 (1884)

How do men attain great strength and a great task? All the virtues and efficiency of body and soul are acquired laboriously and little by little, through much industry, self-constraint, limi tation, through much obstinate, faithful repetition of the same labors, the same renunciations, but there are men who are the heirs and masters of this slowly-acquired manifold treasure of virtue and efficiency--because, through fortunate and reasonable marriages, and also through fortunate accidents, the acquired and stored-up energies of many generations have not been squandered and dis persed but linked together by a firm ring and by will. In the end there appears a man, a monster of energy, who demands a monster of a task. For it is our energy that disposes of us; and the wretched spiritual game of goals and intentions and motives is only a foreground-even though weak eyes may take them for the matter itself.

996 (1885-1886) The sublime man has the highest value, even if he is terribly delicate and fragile, because an abundance of very difficult and rare things has been bred and preserved together through many generations.

997 (1884)

I believe I have guessed some of the things in the soul of the highest man; perhaps anyone who unriddles him must perish; but whoever has seen him must help to make him possible.
