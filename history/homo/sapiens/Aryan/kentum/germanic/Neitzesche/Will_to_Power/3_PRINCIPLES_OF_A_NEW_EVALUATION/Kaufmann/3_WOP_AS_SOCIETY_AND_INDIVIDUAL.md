III. THE WILL TO POWER AS SOCIETY AND INDIVIDUAL

1. Society and State

716 (March-June 1888) Basic principle: only individuals feel themselves responsible. Multiplicities are invented in order to do things for which the individual lacks the courage. It is for just this reason that all com munalities and societies are a hundred times more upright and instructive about the nature of man than is the individual, who is too weak to have the courage for his own desires

The whole of "altruism" reveals itself as the prudence of the private man: societies are not "altruistic" towards one another

The commandment to love one's neighbor has never yet been extended to include one's actual neighbor. That relationship is still governed by the words of Manu: "We must consider all coun tries that have common borders with us, and their allies, too, as our enemies. For the same reason, we must count all their neigh bors as being well-disposed toward us."

The study of society is so invaluable because man as society is much more naive than man as a "unit." "Society" has never regarded virtue ás anything but a means to strength, power, and order.

How simple and dignified is Maniu when he says: "Virtue could scarcely endure by its own strength. Fundamentally it is only the fear of punishment that keeps men within bounds and leaves everyone in peaceful possession of his own."92

717 (Nov. 1887-March 1888)

The state organized immorality-internally: as police, penal law, classes, commerce, family; externally: as will to power, to war, to conquest, to revenge.

How does it happen that the state will do a host of things that the individual would never countenance?- Through division of responsibility, of command, and of execution. Through the interposition of the virtues of obedience, duty, patriotism, and

* The two quotations...-in the second and in the last paragraphs—were inserted by Peter Gast.

BOOK THREE: Principles of A New Evaluation

383 loyalty. Through upholding pride, severity, strength, hatred, revenge -in short, all typical characteristics that contradict the herd type.

718 (Nov. 1887-March 1888)

None of you has the courage to kill a man, or even to whip him, or even to--but the tremendous machine of the state over powers the individual, so he repudiates responsibility for what he does (obedience, oath, etc.)

--Everything a man does in the service of the state is con trary to his nature.

-in the same way, everything he learns with a view to future state service is contrary to his nature.

This is achieved through division of labor (so that no one any longer possesses the full responsibility):

the lawgiver—and he who enacts the law;

the teacher of discipline and those who have grown hard and severe under discipline.

719 (Spring-Fall 1887)

A division of labor among the affects within society: so indi viduals and classes produce an incomplete, but for that reason more useful kind of soul. To what extent certain affects have remained almost rudimentary in every type within society (with a view to developing another affect more strongly).

Justification of morality: economic (the intention to exploit individual strength to

the greatest possible extent to prevent the squandering

of everything exceptional); aesthetic (the formation of firm types, together with pleasure

in one's own type); political (the art of enduring the tremendous tension between

differing degrees of power); physiological (as a pretended high evaluation in favor of the

underprivileged or mediocrem for the preservation of the weak).

720 (1886-1887)

The most fearful and fundamental desire in man, bis drive

384

THE WILL TO POWER

for power--this drive is called "freedom”- must be held in check the longest. This is why ethics, with its unconscious instinct for education and breeding, has hitherto aimed at holding the desire for power in check: it disparages the tyrannical individual and with its glorification of social welfare and patriotism emphasizes the power-instinct of the herd.

721 (Spring-Fall 1887)

Inability to acquire power: its hypocrisy and shrewdness: as obedience (subordination, pride in duty, morality-); as sub mission, devotion, love (idealization, deification of him who commands as compensation and indirect self-transfiguration); as fatalism, resignation; as "objectivity"; as self-tyranny (Stoicism, asceticism, "emancipation from the self," "sanctification"); as criticism, pessimism, indignation, torment; as "beautiful soul," "virtue," "self-deification," "detachment," "unspotted by the world," etc. (the insight into an inability to acquire power disguised as dédain). In all this there is expressed the need to exercise some sort of power nonetheless, or to create for one self the temporary appearance of powermas intoxication.

Men who want power for the sake of the happiness power provides: political parties.

Other men who want power even accompanied by obvious disadvantages and sacrifices in happiness and well-being: the ambitious.

Other men who want power merely because it would other wise fall into other hands upon which they do not want to be dependent.

722 (1886-1887)

Critique of "justice" and "equality before the law": what is really supposed to be abolished through this? Tension, enmity, hatred. — But it is an error to suppose that "happiness" will be increased in this way: Corsicans, e.g., enjoy more happiness than Continentals.

723 (Nov. 1887-March 1888)

Reciprocity, the hidden intention to claim reward: one of the

385

BOOK THREE: Principles of A New Evaluation most insidious forms of the diminution of the value of man. It brings with it that "equality" which depreciates the distancing gulf as immoral

724 (Spring-Fall 1887) What "useful” means is entirely dependent upon the inten tion, the wherefore? The intention, the "goal," is again entirely dependent on the degree of power. Therefore utilitarianism is not a foundation but only a theory of consequences, and absolutely cannot be made obligatory for everyone.

725 (Summer-Fall 1883) Formerly one had the theory of the state as a calculating utility: now one has the practice as well. The age of kings is past because the peoples are no longer worthy of them: they do not want to see the symbol of their ideal in kings, but a means for their profit. That is the whole truth!

726 (Spring-Fall 1887)

Attempt on my part to grasp the absolute rationality of social judgment and evaluation (naturally without the desire to deduce moral conclusions).

the degree of psychological falsity and opacity needed to sanctify the affects essential for preservation and enhancement of power in order to create a good conscience for them).

the degree of stupidity needed to maintain the possibility of common rules and valuations in addition education, supervision of the elements of culture, training).

the degree of inquisition, mistrust, and intolerance needed to deal with the exceptions as criminals and to suppress them—to give them a bad conscience, so they suffer their exceptionalness as a disease.

727 (Spring-Fall 1887) Morality essentially a shield, a means of defense; to this extent a sign of the immature (armored, stoical).

The mature man has, above all, weapons: he attacks.386

THE WILL TO POWER

Instruments of war transformed into instruments of peace (from scales and armor, feathers and hair).

728 (March-June 1888)

It is part of the concept of the living that it must grow that it must extend its power and consequently incorporate alien forces. Intoxicated by moral narcotics, one speaks of the right of the individual to defend himself; in the same sense one might also speak of his right to attack: for both-and the second even more than the first-are necessities for every living thing: -

aggressive and defensive egoism are not matters of choice, to say nothing of "free will," but the fatality of life itself.

In this case it is all the same whether one has in view an individual or a living body, an aspiring "society." The right to punish (or the self-defense of society) is at bottom called a "right" owing to a misuse of the word. A right is acquired through treaties--but self-protection and self-defense do not rest on the basis of a treaty. At least a people might just as well designate as a right its need to conquer, its lust for power, whether by means of arms or by trade, commerce and colonization the right to growth, perhaps. A society that definitely and instinctively gives up war and conquest is in decline: it is ripe for democracy and tlie rule of shopkeepers-- In most cases, to be sure, assurances of peace are merely narcotics.

729 (Nov. 1887-March 1888)

The maintenance of the military state is the last means of all of acquiring or maintaining the great tradition with regard to the supreme type of man, the strong type. And all concepts that perpetuate enmity and difference in rank between states (e.g., nationalism, protective tariffs) may appear sanctioned in this light.

730 (1885-1886)

That something longer-lasting than an individual should endure, that a work should endure which has perhaps been created by an individual: to that end, every possible kind of limi tation, one-sidedness, etc., must be imposed upon the individual.

387

BOOK THREE: Principles of A New Evaluation By what means? Love, reverence, gratitude toward the person who created the work helps, or that our forefathers fought for it; or that my descendants will be guaranteed only if I guarantee this work (e.g., the polis). Morality is essentially the means of en suring the duration of something beyond individuals, or rather through an enslavement of the individual. It is obvious that the perspective from below will produce quite different expressions from that from above.

A complex of power: how is it maintained? By the fact that many generations sacrifice themselves for it; i.e.,—03

731 (Spring-Fall 1887) The continuum: “marriage, property, language, tradition, tribe, family, people, state" are continuums of lower and higher orders. Their economy resides in the preponderance of the advan tages of uninterrupted work and of multiplicity over the disadvan tages: the higher cost of exchange between parts or of making them last. (Multiplication of the effective parts, which, however, often remain unemployed; thus a higher cost of acquisition and a not inconsiderable cost in maintenance.) The advantage resides in the fact that interruptions are avoided and losses that would arise from them are saved. Nothing is more costly than a beginning.

"The greater the advantages for existence, the greater the cost of maintenance and production (food and propagation); the greater, too, the danger and probability of perishing before the high point is reached."

732 (Summer-Fall 1888)

Marriage in the bourgeois sense of the word I mean, in the most respectable sense of the word "marriage is not a matter of love, any more than it is a question of money; no institution can be founded on love. It is a question of society's granting per mission to two people to gratify their sexual desires with one another, under certain conditions, to be sure, but conditions that keep the interests of society in view. It is obvious that a certain attraction between the parties and very much good will-will to patience, compatibility, care for one another will be among the presuppositions of such a contract; but one should not misuse the

THE WILL TO POWER word love to describe this! For two lovers in the complete and strong sense of the word sexual gratification is not essential and is really no more than a symbol: for one party, as already said, a symbol of unconditional submission, for the other a symbol of assent to this, a sign of taking possession.

In marriage in the aristocratic, old aristocratic sense of the word it was a question of the breeding of a race (is there still an aristocracy today? Quaeritur)- thus of the maintenance of a fixed, definite type of ruling man: man and woman were sacri ficed to this point of view. It is obvious that love was not the first consideration here; on the contrary! and not even that measure of mutual good will that is a condition of the good bourgeois marriage. What was decisive was the interest of a family, and beyond that—the class. We would shiver a little at the coldness, severity, and calculating clarity of such a noble concept of marriage as has ruled in every healthy aristocracy, in ancient Athens as in the eighteenth century, we warm-blooded animals with sensitive hearts, we "moderns"! Precisely this is why love as a passion--in the great meaning of the word—was invented for the aristocratic world and in it, where constraint and privation were greatestos_

733 (1888)

On the future of marriage: an additional tax (on inherit ance), also additional war service for bachelors from a certain age onwards and increasing (within the community);

advantages of all kinds for fathers who bring many boys into the world: possibly a plural vote;

a medical certificate preceding every marriage and endorsed by the communal authorities, several definite questions must be answered by the couple and by doctors (“family history"-);

as an antidote to prostitution (or as its ennoblement): marriages for a period, legalized (for years, for months), with guarantees for the children;

every marriage warranted and sanctioned by a certain number of trusted men of the community, as a matter of concern to the community. 86

Also a commandment of the love of man.— There are cases in which a child would be a crime: in the case of chronic invalids and neurasthenics of the third degree. What should one do in such cases? - One might at least try encouraging them to chastity, perhaps with the aid of Parsifal music: Parsifal himself, this typical idiot, had only too many reasons not to propagate him self. The trouble is that a certain inability to "control" oneself ( not to react to stimuli, even to very slight sexual stimuli) is one of the most regular consequences of general exhaustion. One would be mistaken, for example, to think of a Leopardi as chaste. The priest, the moralist play a hopeless game in such cases; it would make more sense to go to a pharmacy. After all, society has a duty here: few more pressing and fundamental demands can be made upon it. Society, as the great trustee of life, is re sponsible to life itself for every miscarried life—it also has to pay for such lives: consequently it ought to prevent them. In numerous cases, society ought to prevent procreation: to this end, it may hold in readiness, without regard to descent, rank, or spirit, the most rigorous means of constraint, deprivation of free dom, in certain circumstances castration.

The Biblical prohibition "thou shalt not kill!" is a piece of naiveté compared with the seriousness of the prohibition of life to decadents: "thou shalt not procreate!"Life itself recognizes no solidarity, no "equal rights," between the healthy and the degenerate parts of an organism: one must excise the latter-or the whole will perish.— Sympathy for decadents, equal rights for the ill-constituted-that would be the profoundest immorality, that would be antinature itself as morality!07

payment for a protracted cowardice and mendaciousness, a moment at least of strength: afterwards they perish of it.99

736 (Spring-Fall 1887)

In our civilized world, we learn to know almost only the wretched criminal, crushed by the curse and the contempt of society, mistrustful of himself, often belittling and slandering his deed, a miscarried type of criminal; and we resist the idea that all great human beings have been criminals (only in the grand and not in a miserable style), that crime belongs to greatness ( for that is the experience of those who have tried the reins and of all who have descended deepest into great souls-). To be "free as a bird" from tradition, the conscience of duty- every great human being knows this danger. But he also desires it: he desires a great goal and therefore also the means to it.100

737 (March-June 1888)

Ages in which one leads men with reward and punishment have a low, still primitive kind of man in view: it is as if they were children

Within our late culture, fatality and degeneration are some thing that completely abolishes all meaning of reward and punish ment- This real determination of action through reward and punishment presupposes young, strong, forceful races. In old races, the impulses are so irresistible that a mere idea is quite powerless;-to be unable to offer resistance where a stimulus is given, but to have to respond to it: this extreme susceptibility of decadents renders such systems of punishment and improvement perfectly meaningless.

The concept "improvement" rests on the presupposition of a normal and strong man, whose individual action must in some

Effect of a prohibition. Every power that forbids, that knows how to arouse fear in those to whom something is forbidden, creates a "bad conscience" (that is, the desire for something com bined with the consciousness of danger in satisfying it, with the necessity for secrecy, for underhandedness, for caution). Every prohibition worsens the character of those who do not submit to it willingly, but only because they are compelled.

739 (March-June 1888)

"Reward and punishment."— They stand together, they fall together. Today one does not want to be rewarded, one will not acknowledge the right of anyone to punish - One has put oneself on a war footing: one desires something, one meets with opposi tion, one can perhaps gain what one wants most reasonably if one gets along—if one draws up a contract.

A modern society, in which every individual has drawn up his "contract”--the criminal breaks a contract. That would be a clear concept. But then one could not tolerate within a society anarchists and those who oppose the form of that society or principle

740 (Spring-Fall 1887)

Crime belongs to the concept "revolt against the social order." One does not "punish" a rebel; one suppresses him. A rebel can be a miserable and contemptible man; but there is nothing con temptible in a revolt as such—and to be a rebel in view of con temporary society does not in itself lower the value of a man. There are even cases in which one might have to honor a rebel, because he finds something in our society against which war ought to be wagedhe awakens us from our slumber.

If a criminal perpetrates an individual act against an indi vidual this does not demonstrate that his whole instinct is not

in a state of war with the whole order: his deed as a mere symptom.

One should reduce the concept “punishment" to the concept: suppression of a revolt, security measures against the suppressed (total or partial imprisonment). But one should not express con tempt through punishment: a criminal is in any case a man who risks his life, his honor, his freedom-a man of courage. Neither should one take punishment to be a penance; or as a payment, as if an exchange relationship existed between guilt and punish ment--punishment does not purify, for crime does not sully.

One should not deprive the criminal of the possibility of mak ing his peace with society; provided he does not belong to the race of criminals. In that case one should make war on him even before he has committed any hostile act (first operation as soon as one has him in one's power: his castration).

One should not hold against the criminal his bad manners or the low level of his intelligence. Nothing is more common than that he should misunderstand himself (for often his rebellious in stinct, the rancor of the déclassé, has not reached consciousness, faute le lecture),102 that he should slander and dishonor his deed under the influence of fear and failure quite apart from those cases in which, psychologically speaking, the criminal surrenders to an uncomprehended drive and by some subsidiary action ascribes a false motive to his deed (perhaps by a robbery when what he wanted was blood).103

One should beware of assessing the value of a man according to a single deed. Napoleon warned against this. For our haut-relief deeds are quite especially insignificant. If men like us have no crime, e.g., murder, on our conscience-why is it? Because a few opportune circumstances were lacking. And if we did it, what would that indicate about our value? In a way one would despise us if one thought we had not the strength to kill a man under certain circumstances. In almost all crimes some qualities also find expression which ought not to be lacking in a man. It was not without justification that Dostoevsky said of the inmates of his Siberian prisons that they formed the strongest and most valuable

393 part of the Russian people.104 If with us the criminal is an ill nourished and stunted plant, this is to the dishonor of our social relationships; in the age of the Renaissance the criminal throve and acquired for himself his own kind of virtue-virtue in the Ren aissance style, to be sure, virtù, moraline-free virtue.

One can enhance only those men whom one does not treat with contempt; moral contempt causes greater indignity and harm than any crime.

741 (1883-1888) The derogatory element first entered into punishment when certain penalties became associated with contemptible men (e.g., slaves). Those punished most were contemptible men, and at length punishment came to contain something derogatory.

742 (March-June 1888) In ancient penal law a religious concept was at work: that of the expiatory power of punishment. Punishment purifies: in the modern world it sullies. Punishment is a payment: one is really rid of that for which one was willing to suffer so much. Provided there is a belief in this power of punishment, there follows a profound sense of relief which is really very close to a new health, à restora tion. One has not only made one's peace with society again, one has also regained one's self-respect and feels—"pure.”

Today punishment isolates even more than the crime; the fatality behind a crime has grown so great that it has grown in curable. One emerges from punishment as an enemy of society. From then on, it has one more enemy.

Jus talionis103 can be dictated by the spirit of retribution (i.e., by a kind of moderation of the instinct for revenge); but with Manu, e.g., it is the need to possess an equivalent in order to expiale, in order to be "free" again in a religious sense.

codes is this: if the punishment should hurt in proportion to the magnitude of the crime--and fundamentally that is what all of you want!you would have to measure the susceptibility to pain of every criminal. Does that not mean: a previously determined punishment for a crime, a penal code, ought not to exist at all? But considering that one would scarcely be able to determine a criminal's degrees of pleasure and displeasure, wouldn't one have to do without punishment in practice? What a loss! Isn't it?

Ah, the philosophy of right! A science that, like all moral science, has not even reached the cradle yet!

One still misunderstands, e.g., even among jurists who think themselves enlightened, the oldest and most valuable significance of punishment-one does not know it at all; and as long as juris prudence does not put itself on a new footing, namely on that of comparative history and anthropology, it will persist in the useless struggle between fundamentally false. abstractions that today pass for "philosophy of right" and that are all based on contemporary man. This contemporary man, however, is so intricate, also in his legal evaluations, that he permits the most varied interpretations,

Schopenhauer wanted rascals to be castrated and silly geese to be shut up in convents: from what point of view would this be desirable? The rascal has this advantage over many other men, that he is not mediocre; and the fool has this advantage over us, that he does not suffer at the sight of mediocrity.

It would be more desirable that the gulf should be made wider; so rascality and folly should increase. In this way human nature would be expanded— But, after all, this is dictated by ne cessity; it does not depend on whether we desire it or not. Folly, rascality increase: that is part of "progress."

747 (Spring-Fall 1887; rev. Spring-Fall 1888)

In contemporary society a great deal of consideration, of tact and forbearance, of good-natured respect for the rights of others, even for the claims of others, is quite widespread; even more, a certain benevolent instinctive estimation of human value in general, which finds expression in trustfulness and credit of all kinds. Re spect for man--and not merely for virtuous men—is perhaps what divides us most sharply from a Christian evaluation. It seems to us ironic to a degree when we still hear morals preached; a man lowers himself in our eyes and becomes comical if he preaches morals.

This moral liberality is one of the best signs of our age. When we discover cases in which it is noticeably lacking, this strikes us as a kind of sickness (the case of Carlyle in England, the case of Ibsen in Norway, the case of Schopenhauerian [?]100 pessimism [?] throughout Europe [?]). If anything can reconcile us to our age, it is the great amount of immorality it permits itself without thinking any the worse of itself. On the contrary! What constitutes the superiority of culture over unculture? of the Renais sance over the Middle Ages, for example?- One thing alone; the great amount of admitted immorality. From this it follows of necessity what all the heights of human evolution must represent to the eye of the moral fanatic: the non plus ultra of corruption (-consider Savonarola's judgment of Florence, Plato's judgment of Periclean Athens, Luther's[?] judgment[?] of Rome, Rous seau's judgment of Voltaire's society, the German judgment contra Goethe).

748 (Nov. 1887-March 1888) A little fresh air! This absurd condition of Europe shall not go on much longer! Is there any idea at all behind this bovine nationalism? What value can there be now, when everything points to wider and more common interests, in encouraging this boorish self-conceit? And this in a state of affairs in which spiritual de pendency and disnationalization meet the eye and in which the value and meaning of contemporary culture lie in mutual blend ing and fertilization.

The princes of Europe should consider carefully whether they can do without our support. We immoralists-we are today the only power that needs no allies in order to conquer: thus we are by far the strongest of the strong. We do not even need to tell lies: what other power can dispense with that? A powerful seduc tion fights on our behalf, the most powerful perhaps that there has ever been the seduction of truth-"Truth”? Who has forced this word on me? But I repudiate it; but I disdain this proud word: no, we do not need even this; we shall conquer and come to power even without truth. The spell that fights on our behalf, the eye of Venus that charms and blinds even our opponents, is the magic of the extreme, the seduction that everything extreme exercises: we immoralists-we are the most extreme.

"The will to power" is so hated in democratic ages that their entire psychology seems directed toward belittling and defaming it. The type of the great ambitious man who thirsts after honor is supposed to be Napoleon! And Caesar! And Alexander! As if these were not precisely the great despisers of honor!

And Helvétius demonstrates to us that men strive after power so as to possess the enjoyments available to the powerful: he understands this striving for power as will to enjoyment! as hedon ism!

752 (1884) According to whether a people feels "right, vision, the gift of leadership, etc., belong to the few" or "to the many"--there will be an oligarchic or a democratic government.

Monarchy represents the belief in one man who is utterly superior, a leader, savior, demigod.

Aristocracy represents the belief in an elite humanity and higher caste.

Democracy represents the disbelief in great human beings and an elite society: "Everyone is equal to everyone else." "At bottom we are one and all self-seeking cattle and mob."

I am opposed to 1. socialism, because it dreams quite naively of the good, true, and beautiful" and of "equal rights" (anarch ism also desires the same ideal, but in a more brutal fashion);

To look upon the distress of the masses with an ironic melancholy: they want something we are capable of-ah!

No relation between payment and achievement! But the indi vidual, each according to his kind, should be so placed that he can achieve the highest that lies in his power.

The workers shall live one day as the bourgeois do now-but above them, distinguished by their freedom from wants, the higher caste: that is to say, poorer and simpler, but in possession of power.

For lower men the reverse valuation obtains; it is a question of implanting "virtues" in them. Absolute commands; terrible means of compulsion; to tear them away from the easy life. The others may obey; and their vanity demands that they appear to be dependent, not on great men, but on "principles."

765 (Jan-Fall 1888)

"Redemption from all guilt"

One speaks of the "profound injustice" of the social pact; as if the fact that this man is born in favorable circumstances, that in unfavorable ones, were in itself an injustice; or even that it is unjust that this man should be born with these qualities, that man with those. Among the most honest of these opponents of society it is asserted: "we ourselves, with all our bad, sick, crim inal qualities, which we admit to, are only the inescapable con sequences of a long suppression of the weak by the strong"; they make the ruling classes responsible for their characters. And they threaten, they rage, they curse; they become virtuous from indig nation—they do not want to have become bad men, canaille, for nothing.

This pose, an invention of the last few decades, is also called pessimism, as I hear; the pessimism of indignation. Here the claim is made to judge history, to divest it of its fatality, to discover responsibility behind it, guilty men in it. For this is the rub: one needs guilty men. The underprivileged, the decadents of all kinds are in revolt on account of themselves and need victims so as not to quench their thirst for destruction by destroying themselves (which would perhaps be reasonable). To this end, they need an appearance of justice, i.e., a theory through which they can shift the responsibility for their existence, for their being thus and thus, on to some sort of scapegoat. This scapegoat can be God in Russia there is no lack of such atheists from ressentiment or the social order, or education and training, or the Jews, or the nobility, or those who have turned out well in any way. “It is a crime to be born in favorable circumstances; for thus one has disinherited the others, pushed them aside, condemned them to vice, even to workHow can I help it that I am wretched! But some body must be responsible, otherwise it would be unberable!"

In short, the pessimism of indignation invents responsibility in order to create a pleasant feeling for itself-revenge--"Sweeter than honey" old Homer called it.

That such a theory is no longer rightly understood, that is to say despised, is a consequence of the bit of Christianity that we

BOOK THREE: Principles of A New Evaluation

401

all still have in our blood; so we are tolerant toward things merely because they smell somewhat Christian from a distance- The socialists appeal to the Christian instincts, that is their most subtle piece of shrewdness.

Christianity has accustomed us to the superstitious concept of the soul," the "immortal soul," soul-monads that really are at home somewhere else and have only by chance fallen, as it were into this or that condition, into the "earthly" and become "flesh"; but their essence is not held to be affected, to say nothing of being conditioned, by all this. Social, family, historical circumstances are for the soul only incidental, perhaps embarrassments; in any event, it is not produced by them. With this idea, the individual is made transcendent; as a result, he can attribute a senseless importance to himself.....

. In fact, it was Christianity that first invited the individual to play the judge of everything and everyone; megalomania almost became a duty: one has to enforce eternal rights against everything temporal and conditioned! What of the state! What of society! What of historical laws! What of physiology! What speaks here is some thing beyond becoming, something unchanging throughout history, somethiog immortal, something divine: a soul!

Another Christian concept, no less crazy, has passed even more deeply into the tissue of modernity: the concept of the "equality of souls before God." This concept furnishes the proto type of all theories of equal rights: mankind was first taught to stammer the proposition of equality in a religious context, and only later was it made into morality: no wonder that man ended by taking it seriously, taking it practically!—that is to say, politi cally, democratically, socialistically, in the spirit of the pessimism of indignation.

Wherever responsibilities have been sought it was the instinct of revenge that sought. This instinct of revenge has so mastered mankind in the course of millennia that the whole of metaphysics, psychology, conception of history, but above all morality, is im pregnated with it. As far as man has thought, he has introduced the bacillus of revenge into things. He has made even God ill with it, he has deprived existence in general of its innocence; namely, by tracing back every state of being thus and thus to a will, an intention, a responsible act. The entire doctrine of the will, this

402

THE WILL TO POWER

most fateful falsification in psychology hitherto, was essentially invented for the sake of punishment. It was the social utility of punishment that guaranteed this concept its dignity, its power, its truth. The originators of this psychology--the psychology of will -are to be sought in the classes that administered the penal law, above all among the priests at the head of the oldest communality: they wanted to create for themselves a right to take revenge--they wanted to create a right for God to take revenge. To this end, man was conceived of as "free"; to this end, every action had to be conceived of as willed, the origin of every action as conscious. But these sentences refute the old psychology. 111

Today, when Europe seems to have entered upon the opposite course, when we halcyonians especially are trying with all our might to withdraw, banish, and extinguish the concepts of guilt and punishment from the world, when our most serious endeavor is to purify psychology, morality, history, nature, social institutions and sanctions, and even God of this filth-whom must we recognize as our most natural antagonists? Precisely those apostles of revenge and ressentiment, those pessimists from indignation par excellence, who make it their mission to sanctify their filth under the name of "indignation."

We others, who desire to restore innocence to becoming, would like to be the missionaries of a cleaner idea: that no one has given man his qualities, neither God, nor society, nor his parents and ancestors, nor he himself that no one is to blame for him.

There is no being that could be held responsible for the fact that anyone exists at all, that anyone is thus and thus, that anyone was born in certain circumstances, in a certain environment. It is a tremendous restorative that such a being is lacking.

We are not the result of an eternal intention, a will, a wish: we are not the product of an attempt to achieve an "ideal of per fection" or an "ideal of happiness" or an "ideal of virtue"-any more than we are a blunder on the part of God that must frighten even him (an idea with which, as is well known, the Old Testament begins). There is no place, no purpose, no meaning, on which we can shift the responsibility for our being, for our being thus and thus. Above all: no one could do it; one cannot judge, measure, compare the whole, to say nothing of denying it! Why not?— For

And, to say it again, this is a tremendous restorative; this constitutes the innocence of all existence.112

2. The Individual

766 (1886-1887)

Basic error: to place the goal in the herd and not in single individuals! The herd is a means, no more! But now one is at tempting to understand the herd as an individual and to ascribe to it a higher rank than to the individual-profound misunder standing! ! ! Also to characterize that which makes herdlike, sympathy, as the more valuable side of our nature!

767 (1883-1888) The individual is something quite new which creates new things, something absolute; all his acts are entirely his own.

Ultimately, the individual derives the values of his acts from himself; because he has to interpret in a quite individual way even the words he has inherited. His interpretation of a formula at least is personal, even if he does not create a formula: as an interpreter he is still creative.

768 (1882)

The "ego" subdues and kills: it operates like an organic cell: it is a robber and violent. It wants to regenerate itself-pregnancy. It wants to give birth to its god and see all mankind at his feet.

But section 765 was utilized in Twilight, "The Four Great Errors," sections 7-8 (Portable Nietzsche, pp. 499-501).

404

THE WILL TO POWER as it can, and overwhelms what is weaker: thus it takes pleasure in itself. The increasing "humanizing" of this tendency consists in this, that there is an ever subtier sense of how hard it is really to incorporate another: while a crude injury done bim certainly demonstrates our power over him, it at the same time estranges his will from us even more and thus makes him less easy to subjugate.

770 (Jan-Fall 1888)

The degreee of resistance that must be continually overcome in order to remain on top is the measure of freedom, whether for individuals or for societies--freedom understood, that is, as posi tive power, as will to power. According to this concept, the highest form of individual freedom, of sovereignty, would in all probability emerge not five steps from its opposite, 119 where the danger of slavery hangs over existence like a hundred swords of Damocles. Look at history from this viewpoint: the ages in which the "indi vidual" achieves such ripe perfection, i.e., freedom, and the classic type of the sovereign man is attained oh no! they have never been humane ages!

One must have no choice: either on top or underneath, like a worm, mocked, annihilated, trodden upon. One must oppose tyrants to become a tyrant, i.e., free. It is no small advantage to live under a hundred swords of Damocles: that way one learns to dance, one attains "freedom of movement."

Morphology of self-esteem First viewpoint: to what extent feelings of sympathy and community are the lower, preparatory stage at a time when personal self-esteem and individual initiative in evaluation are not yet possible.

Second viewpoint: to what extent the height of collective self esteem, pride in the distinction of the clan, the feeling of inequality, the aversion to mediation, equality of rights, reconciliation, is a school for individual self-reliance; that is, in so far as it compels the individual to represent the pride of the whole: he has to speak and act with extreme respect for himself in so far as he represents the community in his own person, Also when the individual feels like the instrument and mouthpiece of the deity.

Third viewpoint: to what extent these forms of depersonaliza tion in fact give the person a tremendous importance, in so far as higher powers employ him; religious awe before oneself the condition of the prophet and poet.

Fourth viewpoint: to what extent responsibility for the whole trains the individual to, and permits him, a broad view, a stern and terrible hand, a circumspection and coolness, a grandeur of bear

In summa: collective self-esteem is the great preparatory school for personal sovereignty. The noble class is that which inherits this training.

** 774 (1883-1888)

The disguised forms of the will to power::

1. Desire for freedom, independence, also for equilibrium, peace, co-ordination. Also the hermit, "spiritual freedom." In the lowest form: will to exist at all, "the drive to self-preservation."

2. Enrollment, so as to satisfy the will to power in a larger whole: submission, making oneself indispensable and useful to those in power; love, as a secret path to the heart of the more powerful so as to dominate him.

3. The sense of duty, conscience, the imaginary consolation of outranking those who actually possess power; the recognition of an order of rank that permits judgment even of the more power ful; self-condemnation; the invention of new tables of value (Jews: classical example),

775 (Spring-Fall 1887) Praise and gratitude as will to power. 116. Praise and grati tude on the occasions of harvest, good weather, victory, marriage, peace:—all these festivals require a subject upon which the feeling can be discharged. One desires that all good things that happen to one should have been done to one: one desires a doer. The same applies to works of art: one is not satisfied with them alone: one praises the doer.

What, then is praise? A sort of restoration of balance in respect of benefits received, a giving in return, a demonstration of our power—for those who praise affirm, judge, evaluate, pass sentence: they claim the right of being able to affirm, of being able to dispense honors. A heightened feeling of happiness and life is also a heightened feeling of power: it is from this that man

The WILL TO POWER

778 (March-June 1888)

"Senses," "passions." - Fear of the senses, of the desires, of the passions, when it goes so far as to counsel us against them, is already a symptom of weakness: extreme measures always in dicate abnormal conditions. What is lacking, or crumbling, here is the strength to restrain an impulse: if one's instinct is to have to succumb, i.e., to have to react, then one does well to avoid the opportunities ("seductions") for it.

A "stimulation of the senses" is a seduction only for those whose system is too easily moved and influenced: in the opposite case, that of a system of great slowness and severity, strong stimuli are needed to set the functions going.

Excess is a reproach only against those who have no right to it; and almost all the passions have been brought into ill repute on account of those who were not sufficiently strong to employ them

One must understand that the same objections can be made to the passions as are made to sickness: nonetheless we cannot do without sickness, and even less without the passions. We need the abnormal, we give life a tremendous choc by these great sick nesses.

In detail, the following must be distinguished:

1. the dominating passion, which even brings with it the supremest form of health; here the co-ordination of the inner systems and their operation in the service of one end is best achieved—but this is almost the definition of health!

2. the antagonism of the passions; two, three, a multiplicity of "souls in one breast":117 very unhealthy, inner ruin, disinte gration, betraying and increasing and inner conflict and anarchism --unless one passion at last becomes master. Return to health

3. juxtaposition without antagonism or collaboration: often periodic, and then, as soon as an order has been established, also healthy. The most interesting men, the chameleons, belong here; they are not in contradiction with themselves, they are happy and secure, but they do not develop their differing states lie jux taposed, even if they are separated sevenfold. They change, they do not become.

781 (Spring-Fall 1887) Preoccupation with itself and its "eternal salvation" is not the expression of a rich and self-confident type; for that type does not give a damn about its salvation-it has no such interest in happiness of any kind; it is force, deed, desire-it imposes itself upon things, it lays violent hands on things. Christianity is a ro mantic hypochondria of those whose legs are shaky.

Wherever the hedonistic perspective comes into the fore ground one may infer suffering and a type that represents a failure.

782 (Nov. 1887-March 1888)

The "growing autonomy of the individual”; these Parisian philosophers such as Fouillée speak of this, they ought to take a look at the race moutonnière118 to which they belong! Open your eyes, you sociologists of the future! The individual has grown strong under opposite conditions; what you describe is the most extreme weakening and impoverishment of mankind; you even de sire it and employ to that end the whole mendacious apparatus of the old ideal! you are so constituted that you actually regard your herd-animal needs as an ideal!

A complete lack of psychological integrity!

783 (1885)

The modern European is characterized by two apparently opposite traits: individualism and the demand for cqual rights; that I have at last come to understand. For the individual is an extremely vulnerable piece of vanity: conscious of how easily it suffers, this vanity demands that every other shall count as its equal, that it should be only inter pares. In this way a social race is characterized in which talents and powers do not diverge very much. The pride that desires solitude and few admirers is quite beyond comprehension; a really "great" success is possible only through the masses, indeed one hardly grasps the fact any more

118 Race of sheep. Alfred Fouillée (1838-1912) wrote books on Plato (1869) and Socrates (1874), a history of philosophy (1875), a critique of contemporary moral systems (1883), a work on democracy (1884), and, in addition to many other books, "Nietzsche et l'immoralisme" (Nietzsche and Immoralism, 1903).

BOOK THREE; Principles of A New Evaluation

411

that a success with the masses is always really a petty success: be cause pulchrum est paucorum hominum.119

All moralities know nothing of an "order of rank" among men; teachers of law nothing of a communal conscience. The prin ciple of the individual rejects very great human beings and de mands, among men approximately equal, the subtlest eye and the specdiest recognition of a talent; and because everyone has some kind of talent in such late and civilized cultures and therefore can expect to receive back his share of honor--there is more flat tering of modest merits today than ever before: it gives the age a veneer of boundless fairness. Its unfairness consists in a boundless rage, not against tyrants and public flatterers even in the arts, but against noble men, who despise the praise of the many. The demand for equal rights (i.e., to be allowed to sit in judgment on every thing and everyone) is anti-aristocratic,

Equally strange to the age is the vanished individual, the absorption in a great type, the desire not to be a personality which constituted the distinction and ambition of many lofty men in earlier days (the greatest poets among them); or "to be a city" as in Greece; Jesuitism, Prussian officer corps and bureaucracy; or to be a pupil and continuator of great masters for which non social conditions and a lack of petty vanity are needed.

784 (Spring-Fall 1887; rev, Spring-Fall 1888)

Individualism is a modest and still unconscious form of the "will to power"; here it seems sufficient to the individual to get free from an overpowering domination by society (whether that of the state or of the church). He does not oppose them as a person but only as an individual; he represents all individuals against the totality. That means: he instinctively posits himself as equal to all other individuals; what he gains in this struggle he gains for himself not as a person but as a representative of indi viduals against the totality.

Socialism is merely a means of agitation employed by indi vidualism: it grasps that, to attain anything, one must organize one self to a collective action, to a "power." But what it desires is not a social order as the goal of the individual but a social order as a means for making possible many individuals: this is the instinct of socialists about which they frequently deceive themselves (-apart

THE WILL TO POWER

from the fact that, in order to prevail, they frequently have to deceive themselves). The preaching of altruistic morality in the service of individual egoism: one of the most common lies of the nineteenth century.

Anarchism, too, is merely a means of agitation employed by socialism; by means of it, socialism arouses fear, by means of fear it begins to fascinate and to terrorize: above all-it draws the courageous, the daring to its side, even in the most spiritual matters.

All this notwithstanding: individualism is the most modest stage of the will to power.

Once one has achieved a certain degree of independence, one wants more: people arrange themselves according to their degree of force: the individual no longer simply supposes himself the equal of others, he seeks his equals-he distinguishes himself from others. Individualism is followed by the formation of groups and organs; related tendencies join together and become active as a power; between these centers of power friction, war, recognition of one another's forces, reciprocation, approaches, regulation of an exchange of services. Finally, an order of rank.

N.B.:120 1. Individuals liberate themselves; 2. they enter into struggle with one another, they come to an agreement over "equality of rights" ("justice" as an aim-); 3. Once this is achieved, the actual inequalities of force pro duce an enhanced effect (because peace rules on the whole and many small quanta of force now constitute differences that formerly did not count). Now individuals organize them selves in groups; the groups struggle for privileges and pre dominance. Strife breaks out again in a milder form.

One desires freedom so long as one does not possess power. Once one does possess it, one desires to overpower; if one can not do that (if one is still too weak to do so), one desires "justice," i.e., equal power.

785 (Spring-Fall 1887)

Correction of the concept "egoism."- When one has grasped to what extent the concept "individual" is an error because every

single creature constitutes the entire process in its entire course (not merely as "inherited," but the process itself-), then the single creature acquires a tremendously great significance. Instinct speaks quite correctly here. Where this instinct weakens—where the individual seeks a value for himself only in the service of others, one can be certain that exhaustion and degeneration are present. An altruistic disposition, genuine and without tartuffery, is an instinct for creating at least a secondary value for oneself in the service of other egoisms. Usually, however, altruism is only appar ent; a detour to the preservation of one's own feeling of vitality and value.

786 (Spring-Fall 1887) History of Moralization and Dismoralization First proposition: There are no moral actions whatsoever: they are completely imaginary. Not only are they indemonstrable (which Kant, e.g., admitted, and Christianity as well)--they are altogether impossible. Through a psychological misunderstanding, one has invented an antithesis to the motivating forces, and be lieves one bas described another kind of force; one has imagined a primum mobile that does not exist at all. According to the valua tion that evolved the antithesis "moral" and "immoral" in general, one has to say: there are only immoral intentions and actions.

Second proposition: This entire distinction "moral" and "im moral" proceeds from the idea that moral as well as immoral actions are acts arising from free spontaneity in short, that such a spon taneity exists, or in other words: that moral judgments in general relate only to one species of intentions and actions, those that are free. But this whole species of intentions and actions is purely imaginary; the world to which alone the moral standard can be applied does not exist at all: there are neither moral nor im moral actions.

The psychological error out of which the antithetical concepts "moral" and "immoral" arose is: "selfless," "unegoistic," "self denying"-all unreal, imaginary.

False dogmatism regarding the "ego": it is taken in an atom istic sense, in a false antithesis to the "non-ego"; at the same time, pried out of becoming, as something that is a being. The false sub

414

THE WILL TO POWER

stantialization of the ego: (in the faith in individual immortality) this is made into an article of faith, especially under the influence of religio-moral training. After this artificial separation of the ego, and the declaration that it exists in and for itself, one confronted a value antithesis that seemed irrefutable: the single ego and the tremendous non-ego. It seemed evident that the value of the single ego could lie only in relating itself to the tremendous "non-ego" being subject to it and existing for its sake. Here the herd in stincts were decisive: nothing is so contrary to this instinct as the sovereignty of the individual. But if the ego is conceived as some thing in and for itself, then its value must lie in self-negation.

Thus: 1. the false autonomy of the "individual," as atom;

2. the herd valuation, which abhors the desire to remain an atom and regards it as hostile;

3, as a result: the individual overcome by moving his goal;

4. now there seemed to be actions that were self-negating: one wove a whole sphere of fantastic antitheses about them;

5. one asked: in what actions does man affirm himself most strongly? Around these (sexuality, avarice, lust to rule, cruelty, etc.) prohibition, hatred, and contempt were heaped: one believed there were unselfish drives, one condemned all the selfish ones, one demanded the unselfish;

6. as a result: what had one done? One had placed a prohibi tion upon all the strongest, most natural, indeed the only real drives

henceforth, in order to find an action praiseworthy, one had to deny the presence in it of such drives--tremendous falsification in psychologicis. Even any kind of "self-satisfaction" had first to be made possible by misunderstanding and construing oneself sub specie boni. Conversely: that species that derived its advantage from depriving man of his self-satisfaction (the representatives of the herd instinct; e.g., the priests and philosophers) became subtle and psychologically astute, so as to deinonstrate how nonetheless selfishness ruled everywhere. Christian conclusion: "Everything is sin; even our virtues. Absolute reprehensibility of man. The unselfish action is not possible.” Original sin. In short: once man had made of his instincts an antithesis to a purely imaginary world of the good, he ended by despising himself as incapable of per forming actions that were "good."

N.B. Christianity thus demonstrates an advance in the sharpen ing of psychological insight: La Rochefoucauld and Pascal, It

415

BOOK THREE: Principles of A New Evaluation grasped the essential equivalence of human actions and their equivalence of value in essentials (-all immoral).

Now one seriously set about the task of forming men in whom selfishness was dead:-priests, saints. And if one doubted the possibility of becoming "perfect," one did not doubt that one knew what is perfect.

The psychology of the saint, the priest, the "good man" naturally had to be purely phantasmagorical. One had declared the real motives of actions bad: in order still to be able to act at all, to prescribe actions, one had to describe as possible and as it were sanctify actions that are utterly impossible. With the falseness of one's former slanders, one now honored and idealized.

Rage against the instincts of life as "holy," as venerable. Absolute chastity, absolute obedience, absolute poverty: the priestly ideal, Alms, pity, sacrifice,121 denial of beauty, of reason, of sen suality, a morose eye cast on all strong qualities one possessed: the lay ideal.

One advances: the slandered instincts, too, try to create a right for themselves (e.g., Luther's Reformation: coarsest form of moral mendaciousness under the guise of "evangelical freedom") -one rebaptized them with holy names;

the slandered instincts try to prove themselves necessary for the existence of the virtuous instincts; one must vivre, pour vivre pour autrui: 122 egoism as means to an end;

one goes further, one tries to grant both the egoistic and the altruistic impulses a right to exist: equal rights for the one as for the other (from the standpoint of utility);

one goes further, one seeks a higher utility in a preference of the egoistic viewpoint over the altruistic: more useful in relation to the happiness of the majority or the progress of mankind, etc. Thus: a preponderance of the rights of egoism, but under the per spective of extreme altruism ("collective utility for mankind");

one tries to reconcile the altruistic mode of action with natural ness, one seeks altruism in the foundations of life; one seeks egoism

THE WILL TO POWER

and altruism as equally founded in the essence of life and nature;

one dreams of a disappearance of the antithesis in some future, when, owing to continual adaptation, egoism will at the same time be altruism;

finally, one grasps that altruistic actions are only a species of egoistic actions and that the degree to which one loves, spends oneself, proves the degree of individual power and personality. In short, that when one makes men more evil, one makes them better and that one cannot be one without being the other-At this point the curtain rises on the dreadful forgery of the psychol ogy of man hitherto.

Consequences: there are only immoral intentions and actions; ---the so-called moral ones must be shown to be immoral.123 The derivation of all affects from the one will to power: the same essence. The concept of life:-in the apparent antithesis of "good" and "evil") degrees of power in instinct express them selves, temporary orders of rank under which certain instincts are held in check or taken into service.--- Justification of morality: economical, etc.

Against the second propostion. Determinism: attempt to rescue the moral world by transporting it into the unknown. Determinism is only a modus of permitting ourselves to juggle our evaluations away once they have no place in a mechanistically conceived world. One must therefore attack determinism and undermine it: and also dispute our right to a distinction between a world in itself and a phenomenal world.

The absolute necessity of a total liberation from ends: other wise we should not be permitted to try to sacrifice ourselves and let ourselves go. Only the innocence of becoming gives us the greatest courage and the greatest freedom!

To restore a good conscience to the evil man has this been my unconscious endeavor? I mean, to the evil man in so far as he is the strong man? (Dostoevsky's judgment on the criminals in prison should be cited here.)

789 (1885-1886)

Our new "freedom."- What a feeling of freedom there is in feeling as we freed spirits do, that we are not harnessed to any system of "purposes"! Likewise, that the concepts "reward" and "punishment" do not reside in the essence of things! Likewise, that the good and the evil action caonot be called good and evil in themselves, but only in the perspective of what tends to preserve certain types of human communities! Likewise, that our assess ments of pleasure and pain have no cosmic, let alone a meta physical, significance! (that pessimism, the pessimism of Herr von Hartmann, who claims to put the pleasure and displeasure of existence itself on the scales, with his arbitrary incarceration in the pre-Copernican prison and field of vision, would be something retarded and regressive unless it is merely a bad joke of a Berliner.)

790 (Nov, 1887-March 1888)

Once one is clear about the "why?" of one's life, one can let its How? take care of itself. It is itself a sign of disbelief in a Why, in purpose and meaning, a sign of a lack of will, if the value of pleasure and displeasure step into the foreground and hedonistic pessimistic theories get a hearing; and renunciation, resignation, virtue, and "objectivity" may at least be a sign that what matters most is beginning to be defective.

791 (1885)

Up to now there has not yet been any German culture. It is no objection to this statement that there have been great hermits in Germany (e.g., Goethe); for these had their own culture. But like mighty, defiant, solitary rocks, they were surrounded by

THE WILL TO POWER

the rest of what was German as by their antithesis a soft, marshy, insecure ground upon which every step from other countries made an "impression" and created a "form": German culture was a thing without character, an almost limitless compliance.

792 (1885)

Germany, rich in clever and well-informed scholars, has lacked great souls, mighty spirits, to such an extent and for so long that it seems to have forgotten what a great soul, a mighty spirit, is; and today mediocre and quite ill-constituted men place themselves in the market square almost with a good conscience and without any embarrassment and praise themselves as great men and reformers, as, e.g., Eugen Dühring does--indeed a clever and well-informed scholar, but one who nevertheless betrays with almost every word he says that he harbors a petty soul and is tormented by narrow, envious feelings; also that what drives him is not a mighty, overflowing, benevolent, spendthrift spirit—but ambition! But to lust after honors in this age is even more unworthy of a philosopher than it was in any previous age: today, when the mob rules, when the mob bestows the honors!

My "future":-a rigorous polytechnic education, Military service; so that, on an average, every man of the higher classes would be an officer, whatever else he might be.
