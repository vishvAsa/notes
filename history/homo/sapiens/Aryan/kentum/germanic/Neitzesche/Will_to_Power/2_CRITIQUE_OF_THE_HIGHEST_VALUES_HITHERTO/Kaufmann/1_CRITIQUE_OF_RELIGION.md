title = "1 CRITIQUE OF RELIGION"

+++

All the beauty and sublimity we have bestowed upon real and imaginary things I will reclaim as the property and product of man: as his fairest apology. Man as poet, as thinker, as God, as love, as power: with what regal liberality he has lavished gifts upon things so as to impoverish himself and make himself feel wretched! His most unselfish act hitherto has been to admire and worship and to know how to conceal from himself that it was he who created what he admired.+++(4)+++



## 1. Genesis of Religions

135 (March-June 1888)

On the origin of religion. In the same way as today the un educated man believes that anger is the cause of his being angry, spirit the cause of his thinking, soul the cause of his feeling--in short, just as there is still thoughtlessly posited a mass of psy chological entities that are supposed to be causes--so, at a yet more naive stage, man explained precisely the same phenomena with the aid of psychological personal entities. Those conditions that seemed to him strange, thrilling, overwhelming, he interpreted as obsession and enchantment by the power of a person. (Thus the Christian, the most naive and backward species of man today, traces hope, repose, the feeling of "redemption," back to psy chological inspiration by God: to him, as an essentially suffering and disturbed type, the feeling of happiness, resignation and repose naturally seems strange and in need of explanation.) Among intelligent, strong, and vigorous races it is mainly the epileptic who inspires the conviction that a strange power is here at work; but every related condition of subjection, e.g., that of the inspired man, of the poet, of the great criminal, of passions such as love and revenge, also leads to the invention of extra

 human powers. A condition is made concrete in a person, and when it overtakes us is thought to be effected by that person. In other words: In the psychological concept of God, a condition, in order to appear as effect, is personified as cause.

The psychological logic is this: When a man is suddenly and overwhelmingly suffused with the feeling of power and this is what happens with all great affects-it raises in him a doubt about his own person; he does not dare to think himself the cause of this astonishing feeling--and so he posits a stronger person, a divinity, to account for it.

In sumima: the origin of religion lies in extreme feelings of power which, because they are strange, take men by surprise: and like a sick man who, feeling one of his limbs uncommonly heavy, comes to the conclusion another man is lying on top of him, the naive homo religiosus divides himself into several persons. Religion is a case of "altération de la personalité." A sort of feel ing of fear and terror at oneself. But also a feeling of extraor dinary happiness and exaltation- Among the sick the feeling of health is sufficient to inspire belief in God, in the nearness of God.

136 (March-June 1888)

Rudimentary psychology of the religious man:- All changes are effects; all effects are effects of will (-the concept "nature," "law of nature" is lacking); all effects suppose an agent. Rudi mentary psychology: one is a cause oneself only when one knows that one has performed an act of will.

Result: when man experiences the conditions of power, the imputation is that he is not their cause, that he is not responsible for them: they come without being willed, consequently we are not their author: the will that is not free (i.e., the consciousness that we have been changed without having willed it) needs an external will.

Consequence: man has not dared to credit himself with all his strong and surprising impulseshe has conceived them as "passive," as "suffered," as things imposed upon him: religion is the product of a doubt concerning the unity of the person, an altération of the personality: in so far as everything great and

BOOK TWO: Critique of Highest Values strong in man has been conceived as superhuman and external, man has belittled himself-he has separated the two sides of him self, one very paltry and weak, one very strong and astonishing, into two spheres, and called the former "man," the latter "God."

He has continued to think in this way; in the period of the moral idiosyncrasy he did not interpret his exalted and sublime moral states as "willed," as "work" of the person. The Christian too divides his person into a mean and weak fiction which he calls man, and another which he calls God (redeemer, savior)

Religion has debased the concept "man"; its ultimate con sequence is that everything good, great, true is superhuman and bestowed only through an act of grace

137 (March-June 1888)

One way of raising man from the abasement produced by the subtraction of exalted and strong states as foreign conditions was the family theory. These exalted and strong states could at least be interpreted as the influence of our ancestors; we belonged together, in solidarity; we grow greater in our own eyes when we act according to a norm known to us.

Attempt by noble families to square religion with the feeling of their own worth. Poets and seers do the same; they feel proud, honored, and chosen for such an association--they attach great importance to not being considered at all as individuals, but merely as mouthpieces (Homer).

Step by step man takes possession of his exalted and proud states, he takes possession of his acts and works. Formerly one believed one was doing oneself an honor by denying responsibility for one's highest acts and attributing them to God. Absence of free will counted as that which imparted a higher value to an action: a god was conceived as its author.*

138 (1883-1888) Priests are the actors of something superhuman which they have to make easily perceptible, whether it be in the nature of

"In the MS this section is entitled "A form of religion for establishing human pride." And the MS version also contains the following sentence, crossed out by Nietzsche: "Another form of religion. The god elects, the god becomes man, and god dwells among men and leaves behind great benefactions. The local legend, eternally represented as "drama.""



(p88)



 ideals, gods, or saviors: in this they find their calling, for this their instincts serve them; to make everything as believable as possible they have to go as far as possible in posturing and posing; the shrewdness of their actor's art must above all aim at giving them a good conscience, by means of which alone is it possible to carry true conviction.

139 (March-June 1888)

The priest wants to have it understood that he counts as the highest type of man, that he rules-even over those who wield power--that he is indispensable, unassailable—that he is the strongest power in the community, absolutely not to be replaced or undervalued.

Means:5 he alone possesses knowledge; he alone possesses virtue; he alone has sovereign lordship over himself; he alone is in a certain sense God and goes back to the divinity; he alone is the intermediary between God and other people; the divinity punishes every opposition to, every thought directed against a priest.

Means: truth exists. There is only one way of attaining it: to become a priest. Everything good in society, in nature, in tra dition, is to be traced back to the wisdom of the priests. The holy book is their work. The whole of nature is only a fulfillment of the dogmas contained in it. There is no other source of the good than the priests. Every other kind of excellence is of a different order from that of the priest; e.g., that of the warrior.

Consequence: if the priest is to be the highest type, then the degrees which lead to his virtues must constitute the degrees of value among men. Study, emancipation from the senses, the non active, the impassible, absence of affects, the solemn; antithesis: the lowest order of man.

The priest has taught one kind of morality: in order that he shall be considered the highest type of man. He conceives an antithetical type: the chandala. To make these contemptible by every means provides a foil to the order of castes. The priest's extreme fear of sensuality is also conditioned by the insight that this is the most serious threat to the order of castes (that is, to order, in general) - Every "more liberal tendency" in puncto puncti throws the marriage laws overboard

Mittel, i.e., means in the sense of instrument.

(p140) (March-June 1888)

The philosopher as a further development of the priestly type:- has the heritage of the priest in his blood; is compelled, even as rival, to struggle for the same ends with the same means as the priest of his time; he aspires to supreme authority.

What gives authority when one does not have physical power in one's hands (no army, no weapons of any kind-)? How, in fact, does one gain authority over those who possess physical strength and authority? (They compete with the awe inspired by princes, by the victorious conqueror, by the wise statesman).

Only by arousing the belief that they have in their hands a higher, mightier strength-God. Nothing is sufficiently strong: the mediation and service of the priests is needed. They establish themselves as indispensable intermediaries: they need as condi tions of their existence: (1) belief in the absolute superiority of their God, belief in their God; (2) that there is no other, no direct access to God. The second demand alone creates the concept "heterodoxy," the first the concept "unbeliever" (i.e., one who believes in another God--).

141° (Jan-Fall 1888)

Critique of the holy lie. That the lie is permitted as a means to pious ends is part of the theory of every priesthood—to what extent it is part of their practice is the object of this inquiry.

But philosophers too, as soon as, with priestly ulterior mo tives, they form the intention of taking in hand the direction of mankind, at once also arrogate to themselves the right to tell lies: Plato before all. The most imposing is the twofold lie developed by the typically Aryan philosophers of the Vedanta: two systems contradictory in all their main features but for educational reasons alternating, supplementary and complementary. The lie of the one is intended to create a condition in which alone the truth of the other can become audible

How far does the pious lie of priests and philosophers go? — One must ask what presuppositions they require for the purpose

Sections 141-43 were utilized in the chapter on "The 'Improvers' of Mankind" in Twilight (Portable Nietzsche).



(p90)





of education, what dogmas they have to invent to satisfy these presuppositions.

First: they must have power, authority, unconditional credi bility on their side.

Secondly: they must have the whole course of nature in their hands, so that everything that affects the individual seems to be conditioned by their laws.

Thirdly: they must also possess a more extensive domain of power whose control eludes the eyes of its subjects: power of punishment in the beyond, in the after death"_and of course the means of discovering the way to bliss.

-They have to set aside the concept of a natural course of events: but since they are clever and thoughtful people they are able to promise a host of effects, conditioned, of course, by prayers or the strict observance of their laws.— They can, moreover, prescribe a host of things that are absolutely reasonable-provided only that they do not point to experience or empiricism as the source of this wisdom, but to revelation or the consequence of "the sternest penances."

The holy lie therefore applies principally: to the purpose of an action (--natural purpose, reason are made to vanish: a moral purpose, the fulfillment of a law, a service to God appears as purpose-): to the consequence of an action ( natural conse quence is interpreted as supernatural and, to produce a surer effect, the prospect of other, uncontrollable consequences is held out).

In this way a concept of good and evil is created that seems to be altogether divorced from the natural concept "useful," "harmful," "life-promoting," "life-retarding"—in so far as another life is imagined, it can even be directly inimical to the natural concept of good and evil.

In this way the famous "conscience" is at last created: an inner voice which does not measure the value of every action with regard to its consequences, but with regard to its intention and the degree to which this intention conforms with the "laws."

The holy lie therefore invented (1) a God who punishes and rewards, who strictly observes the law-book of the priests and is strict about sending them into the world as his mouthpieces and plenipotentiaries; (2) an afterlife in which the great punishment

These numbers are not found in the MS.

(p91) machine is first thought to become effective to this end the immortality of the soul; (3) conscience in man as the conscious ness that good and evil are permanent-that God himself speaks through it when it advises conformity with priestly precepts; (4) morality as denial of all natural processes, as reduction of all events to a morally conditioned event, moral effects (i.e., the idea of punishment and reward) as effects permeating all things, as the sole power, as the creator of all transformation; (5) truth as given, as revealed, as identical with the teaching of the priests: as the condition for all salvation and happiness in this life and the next.

In summa: what is the price of moral improvement?. Un hinging of reason, reduction of all motives to fear and hope (punishment and reward); dependence upon a priestly guardian ship, upon pedantic formalities which claim to express a divine will; the implanting of a "conscience" which sets a false knowing in place of testing and experiment: as if what should be done and what left undone had already been determined—a kind of castration of the seeking and forward-striving spirit; in summa: the worst mutilation of man that can be imagined presented as the "good man."

In practice, all the reason, the whole heritage of prudence, subtlety, caution which is the presupposition of the priestly canon, is afterwards arbitrarily reduced to a mere mechanism: conformity with the law itself counts as an end, as the highest end, life no longer has any problems; the whole conception of the world is polluted by the idea of punishment; with the object of representing the priestly life as the non plus ultra of perfection, life itself is transformed into a defamation and pollution of life; the concept "God" represents a turning away from life, a critique of life, even a contempt for it; truth is transformed into the priestly lie, the striving for truth into study of the scriptures, into a means of becoming a theologian

142 (Jan-Fall 1888) Toward a critique of the law-book of Manu. The whole book is founded on the holy lie. Was the well-being of mankind the inspiration of this system? Was this species of man, who believes in the interestedness of every action, interested or not in imposing this system? To improve mankind-how is this inten tion inspired? Where is the concept of improvement derived from?

THE WILL TO POWER

We find a species of man, the priestly, which feels itself to be the norm, the high point and the supreme expression of the type man: this species derives the concept "improvement" from itself. It believes in its own superiority, it wills itself to be superior in fact: the origin of the holy lie is the will to power

Establishment of rule: to this end, the rule of those concepts that place a non plus ultra of power with the priesthood. Power through the lie in the knowledge that one does not possess it physically, militarily--the lie as a supplement to power, a new concept of "truth."

It is a mistake to suppose an unconscious and naive develop ment here, a kind of self-deception-- Fanatics do not invent such carefully thought-out systems of oppression - The most cold blooded reflection was at work here; the same kind of reflection as a Plato applied when he imagined his "Republic." "He who wills the end must will the means"-all lawgivers have been clear in their minds regarding this politician's insight.

We possess the classic model in specifically Aryan forms: we may therefore hold the best-endowed and most reflective species of man responsible for the most fundamental lie that has ever been told- That lie has been copied almost everywhere: Aryan influence has corrupted all the world8

143 (March-June 1888) A lot is said today about the Semitic spirit of the New Testa ment: but what is called Semitic is merely priestly and in the racially purest Aryan law-book, in Manu, this kind of "Semitism," i.e., the spirit of the priest, is worse than anywhere else.

The development of the Jewish priestly state is not original: they learned the pattern in Babylon: the pattern is Aryan. When, later on, the same thing became dominant in a Europe with a preponderance of Germanic blood, this was in accordance with the spirit of the ruling race: a great atavism. The Germanic Middle Ages aimed at a revival of the Aryan order of castes,

Mohammedanism in turn learned from Christianity: the em ployment of the "beyond" as an instrument of punishment.

144 (1885)

Moralities and religions are the principal means by which one can make whatever one wishes out of man, provided one possesses a superfluity of creative forces and can assert one's will over long periods of time--in the form of legislation, religions, and customs.

145 (1884-1888) What an affirmative Aryan religion, the product of the ruling class, looks like: the law-book of Manu. (The deification of the feeling of power in Brahma: interesting that it arose among the warrior caste and was only transferred to the priests.)

What an affirmative Semitic religion, the product of a ruling class, looks like: the law-book of Mohammed, the older parts of the Old Testament. (Mohammedanism, as a religion for men, is deeply contemptuous of the sentimentality and mendaciousness of Christianity--which it feels to be a woman's religion.)

What a negative Semitic religion, the product of an oppressed class, looks like: the New Testament (min Indian-Aryan terms: a chandala religion).

What a negative Aryan religion looks like, grown up among the ruling orders: Buddhism.

It is quite in order that we possess no religion of oppressed Aryan races, for that is a contradiction: a master race is either on top or it is destroyed.10

 ligions such as offer precepts about how one ought to live, and create a hearing for their demands by rewards and punishments.

147 (Spring-Fall 1887) Pagan-Christian. The affirmation of the natural, the sense of innocence in the natural, "naturalness," is pagan. The denial of the natural, the sense of degradation in the natural, unnaturalness, is Christian.

Petronius, e.g., was "innocent": compared with this happy man, a Christian is absolutely without innocence. But since ultimately the Christian status must be merely a natural condition -which, however, dares not conceive itself to be such-"Chris tian" signifies raising to a principle the counterfeiting of psy chological interpretations

148 (1883-1886)

The Christian priest is from the first a mortal enemy of sen suality: no greather antithesis can be imagined than the innocently awed and solemn attitude adopted by, e.g., the most honorable women's cults of Athens in the presence of the symbols of sex. The act of procreation is the mystery as such in all nonascetic re ligions: a sort of symbol of perfection and of the mysterious design of the future: rebirth, immortality.

149 (1880-1881) Belief in ourselves is the strongest fetter and the supreme whipping-on-and the strongest wing. Christianity should have made the innocence of man an article of faith—men would have become gods: belief was still possible in those days. 11

(p151) (1885-1886)

Religions are destroyed by belief in morality. The Christian moral God is not tenable: hence “atheism"-as if there could be

no other kinds of god.

Similarly, culture is destroyed by belief in morality. For when one discovers the necessary conditions out of which alone

it can grow, one no longer wants it (Buddhism).

152 (March-June 1888) Physiology of the nihilistic religions. Each and every nihilistic religion: a systematized case history of sickness employing re ligious-moralistic nomenclature.

With pagan cults, it is around the interpretations of the great annual cycles that the cult revolves. With the Christian cult, it is around a cycle of paralytic phenomena that the cult revolves

153 (Nov, 1887-March 1888) This nihilistic religion gathers together those decadence ele ments and the like that it finds in antiquity; namely:

a. the party of the weak and ill-constituted (the refuse of the antique world: that which it thrust out most forcefully);

b. the party of the morally-obsessed and antipagan;

c. the party of the politically weary and the indifferent (blasé Romans), those without a country for whom life was emptiness;

d. the party of those who were tired of themselves who were glad to participate in a subterranean conspiracy

 sweetness and mildness--it is gratitude toward all that lies behind, and also for what is lacking: bitterness, disillusionment, ran cor; finally, a lofty spiritual love; the subtleties of philosophical contradiction are behind it, even from these it is resting: but from these it still derives its spiritual glory and sunset glow. ( Origin in the highest castes--)

The Christian movement is a degeneracy movement com posed of reject and refuse elements of every kind: it is not the expression of the decline of a race, it is from the first an agglomera tion of forms of morbidity crowding together and seeking one another out- It is therefore not national, not racially conditioned; it appeals to the disinherited everywhere; it is founded on a rancor against everything well-constituted and dominant: it needs a symbol that represents a curse on the well-constituted and dominant-It also stands in opposition to every spiritual movement, to all philosophy: it takes the side of idiots 18 and utters a curse on the spirit. Rancor against the gifted, learned, spiritually independent: it detects in them the well-constituted, the masterful.

155 (Spring-Fall 1887)

In Buddhism this thought predominates: "All desires, all that produces affects and blood, draw one toward actions"-only to this extent is one warned against evil. For action has no mean ing, action biods one to existence: but all existence has no meaning. They see in evil a drive toward something illogical: to the affirma tion of means to an end one denies. They seek a way of non existence and therefore they regard with horror all affective drives. E.g., take no revenge! be no one's enemy! - The hedonism of the weary is here the supreme measure of value. Nothing is further from Buddhism than the Jewish fanaticism of a Paul: nothing would be more repellent to its instincts than this tension, fire, un Test of the religious man, above all that form of sensuality that Christianity has sanctified with the name "love," Moreover, it is the cultured and even the overspirited orders that find satisfaction in Buddhism: a race satiated and wearied by centuries of philo sophical contentions, not, however, beneath all culture, like the classes from which Christianity arose Emancipation even from good and evil appears to be of the essence of the Buddhist ideal:

A nihilistic religion (like Christianity),14 sprung from and appropriate to a people grown old and tame, having outlived all strong instincts-transferred step by step to another milieu, at length entering into youthful peoples which have not yet lived at all—very curious! The bliss of the close, the fold, the evening preached to barbarians and Germans! How thoroughly all that I first had to be barbarized, Germanized! To those who had dreamed a Valhalla: who found happiness only in war!A su pramational religion preached in a chaos where no nations even existed yet

157 (Jan.-Fall 1888)

The only way to refute priests and religions is this: to show that their errors have ceased to be beneficial that they rather do harm; in short, that their own "proof of power" no longer holds good

2. History of Christianity 26

158 (1888)

One should not confuse Christianity as a historical reality with that one root that its name calls to mind: the other roots from which it has grown up have been far more powerful. It is an

The editorial emendation could be improved by omitting the bracketed words and placing at the beginning of the section: "Christianity:...."

 unexampled misuse of words when such manifestations of decay and abortions as "Christian church," "Christian faith" and "Chris tian life" label themselves with that holy name. What did Christ deny? Everything that is today called Christian.

159 (Nov. 1887-March 1888)

The entire Christian teaching as to what shall be believed, the entire Christian "truth," is idle falsehood and deception: and precisely the opposite of what inspired the Christian movement in the beginning.

Precisely that which is Christian in the ecclesiastical sense is anti-Christian in essence: things and people instead of symbols; history instead of eternal facts; forms, rites, dogmas instead of a way of life. Utter indifference to dogmas, cults, priests, church, theology is Christian.

The Christian way of life is no more a fantasy than the Bud dhist way of life: it is a means to being happy.

160 (Nov. 1887-March 1888) Jesus starts directly with the condition the "Kingdom of Heaven" in the heart, and he does not find the means to it in the observances of the Jewish church; the reality of Judaism itself (its need to preserve itself) he regards as nothing; he is purely inward.

He likewise ignores the entire system of crude formalities governing intercourse with God: he opposes the whole teaching of repentance and atonement; he demonstrates how one must live in order to feel "deified"-and how one will not achieve it through repentance and contrition for one's sios: "Sin is of no account" is his central judgment.

Sin, repentance, forgiveness one of this belongs here—it is acquired from Judaism, or it is pagan.

You should make no distinction between strangers and neighbors, foreigners and fellow countrymen.

You should be angry with no one, you should show contempt to no one. Give alms in secret. You should not want to become rich. You should not swear. You should not judge. You should be reconciled with foes; you should forgive. Do not pray publicly.

"Bliss" is not something promised: it is there if you live and act in such and such a way.17

164 (Nov. 1887-March 1888)

The entire prophet and miracle-worker attitude, the anger, the calling down of judgment is a dreadful corruption (e.g., Mark 6, 11. And whosoever shall not receive you ... verily I say unto you, it shall be more tolerable for Sodom and Gomorrha, etc.). The "fig tree" (Matt. 21, 18): Now in the morning as he re

And the penultimate paragraph: "Let only good men be seen, let your light shine; who will enter heaven? who ever does the will of my father in heaven."

Schlechta, of course, reproduces the text of the standard editions, ignoring 1911, P, 501.

In a quite absurd way, the doctrine of reward and punish ment has been crowded in: everything has thereby been ruined.

In the same way, the practice of the first ecclesia militans, 10 of the apostle (Paul 20 and his attitude, has been represented in a quite falsifying way as commanded, as predetermined

And as for the fulfillment of prophesies: what a mass of falsification and forgery!

166 (Nov. 1887-March 1888)

Jesus opposed the commonplace life with a real life, a life in truth: nothing was further from him than the stupid nonsense of an "eternalized Peter," an eternal personal survival. What he fights against is this exaggerated inflation of the "person": how can he desire to eternize precisely that?

In the same way he fights against hierarchy within the com munity: he does not promise that reward shall be proportionate to performance: how can he have meant punishment and reward in the beyond!

167 (Nov. 1887-March 1888)

Christianity: a naive beginning to a Buddhistic peace move ment in the very seat of ressentimen-but reversed by Paul into a pagan mystery doctrine, which finally learns to treat with the entire state organization-and wages war, condemns, tortures, swears, hates.

Paul starts from the need for a mystery felt by the broad, religiously excited masses: he seeks a sacrifice, a bloody phantas magoria which will stand up in competition with the images of the mystery cults: God on the cross, blood-drinking, the unio mystica with the "sacrifice."

He seeks to bring the afterlife (the blissful, atoned afterlife of the individual soul) as resurrection into a causal relationship with that sacrifice (after the type of Dionysus, Mithras, Osiris).

He needs to bring the concept guilt and atonement into the foreground, not a new way of life (as Jesus himself had demon strated and lived) but a new cult, a new faith, a faith in a miraculous transformation ("redemption" through faith).

He understood what the pagan world had the greatest need of, and from the facts of Christ's life and death made a quite arbitrary selection, giving everything a new accentuation, shifting the emphasis everywhere--he annulled primitive Christianity as a matter or principle

The attempt to destroy priests and theologians culminated, thanks to Paul, in a new priesthood and theology in a new ruling order and a church.

The attempt to destroy the exaggerated inflation of the "person" culminated in faith in the "eternal person" (in concern for "eternal salvation"—), in the most paradoxical excess of personal egoism.

This is the humor of the situation, a tragic humor: Paul re erected on a grand scale precisely that which Christ had annulled through his way of living. At last, when the church was complete, it sanctioned even the existence of the state.

A god who died for our sins: redemption through faith; resurrection after death—all these are counterfeits of true Chris tianity for which that disastrous wrong-headed fellow [Paul]21 must be held responsible.

The exemplary life consists of love and humility; in a fullness of heart that does not exclude even the lowliest; in a formal re pudiation of maintaining one's rights, of self-defense, of victory in the sense of personal triumph; in faith in blessedness here on earth, in spite of distress, opposition and death; in reconciliation; in the absence of anger; not wanting to be rewarded; not being obliged to anyone; the completest spiritual-intellectual independence; a very proud life beneath the will to a life of poverty and service.

After the church had let itself be deprived of the entire Chris tian way of life and had quite specifically sanctioned life under the state, that form of life that Jesus had combatted and con demned, it had to find the meaning of Christianity in something else: in faith in unbelievable things, in the ceremonial of prayers, worship, feasts, etc. The concept "sin," "forgiveness," "reward" -all quite unimportant and virtually excluded from primitive Christianity--now comes into the foreground.

An appalling mishmash of Greek philosophy and Judaism; asceticism; continual judging and condemning; order of rank, etc.

170 (Nov. 1887-March 1888)

Christianity has from the outset transformed the symbolic into crudities:

1. the antithesis "real life" and "false" life: misunderstood as "this life" and "the life to come";

2. the concept "eternal life," the antithesis to transient personal life, as "personal immortality";

3. brotherhood on the basis of sharing food and drink to gether after the Hebrew-Arabic custom, as "the miracle of tran substantiation";

4. "resurrection—" understood as entry into "real life," as a state of "rebirth"; this is made into an historical eventuality which takes place some time or other after death;

5. the teaching that the son of man is the "Son of God," the living relationship between God and man; this is made into the "second person of the divinity"—the filial relationship to God of every man, even the lowliest, is abolished;

6. salvation through faith (namely, that there is no means of becoming a son of God except by following the way of life taught by Christ) reversed into the faith that one is to believe in some sort of miraculous subtraction of sins, accomplished not

through man but through Christ's deed:

With that, "Christ on the cross" had to be interpreted anew. This death in itself was not at all the main thing—it had been only one more sign of how one ought to behave in relation to the authorities and laws of this world: not to defend oneself- That had been the lesson.

171 (March-June 1888)

Toward a psychology of Paul.- The given fact is the death of Jesus. This has to be explained. That an explanation may be true or false has never entered the minds of such people as these: one day a sublime possibility comes into their heads: "this death could mean such and such”—and at once it does mean such and such! A hypothesis is proved true by the sublime impetus it imparts to its originator

"The proof of power": i.e., an idea is proved true by its effect ("by their fruits" as the Bible naively says); what inspires must be true—that for which one sheds one's blood must be true

Here, the sudden feeling of power that an idea arouses in its originator is everywhere accounted proof of its value:--and since one knows no way of honoring an idea other than by calling it true, the first predicate with which it is honored is the predicate "true" How otherwise could it be so effective? It was imagined by some power: if that power were not real, it could not be effective

The idea is understood to have been inspired: the effect that it exercises possesses something of the violence of a demonic in fluence

An idea that such a decadent is unable to resist, to which he completely succumbs, is thus "proved" true! ! !

None of these holy epileptics and seers of visions possessed a thousandth part of that integrity in self-criticism with which a philologist today reads a text or proves the truth of an historical event- Compared with us, they are moral cretins—22

That it does not matter whether a thing is true, but only what

(p104)





effect it produces absolute lack of intellectual integrity. Every thing is justified, lies, slander, the most shameless forgery, if it serves to raise the temperature until one "believes"

A systematic school of the means to seduction to a faith: contempt, on principle, for the spheres from which contradiction might come (the spheres of reason, philosophy and wisdom, mistrust, caution); a shameless praising and glorification of the doctrine, with constant reference to the fact that it was God who gave it--that the apostle signifies nothing that nothing here is to be criticized, but only believed, accepted; that it is the most extra ordinary grace and favor to receive such a doctrine of redemption; that the deepest gratitude and humility is the condition in which to receive it

The ressentiment which these lowly-placed persons feel toward everything held in honor is constantly gambled upon; that one represents this doctrine as a counterdoctrine in opposition to the wisdom of the world, to the power of the world, seduces them to it. It convinces the outcast and underprivileged of all kinds; it promises blessedness, advantage, privilege to the most insignificant and humble; it fills poor little foolish heads with an insane conceit, as if they were the meaning and the salt of the earth

All this, I repeat, one cannot sufficiently despise. We shall spare ourselves a critique of the doctrine; it suffices to observe the means it uses to know what it is one is dealing with. It identified with virtue, it shamelessly claimed for itself alone the whole fascinat ing force of virtue—it identified with the power of paradox and with the need felt by old civilizations for spice and absurdity; it amazed, it enraged, it provoked persecution and mistreatment

It is precisely the same well-pondered baseness with which the Jewish priesthood established its power and the Jewish church was created

One should distinguish: (1) that warmth of the passion "love" (resting on the subterranean basis of a heated sensuality); (2) the absolute ignobility of Christianity: --the continual exaggeration, the verbosity; - the lack of cool spirituality and irony; --the un military nature of all its instincts; the priestly prejudice against manly pride, against sensuality, the sciences, the arts.23

Paul: he seeks power in opposition to ruling Judaism his movement is too weak- Revaluation of the concept "Jew": the "race" is set aside but that means negating what is fundamental.

The "martyr," the "fanatic," the value of all strong faith

Christianity is the decadent form of the old world sunk into deepest impotence, so that the sickest and unhealthiest elements and desires come to the top.

Consequently, in order to create a unity, a resisting power, other instincts had to step into the foreground in short, a kind of calamity was needed such as that from which the Jews had acquired their instinct for self-preservation---

In this regard, the persecutions of the Christians were in valuable-a sense of community in danger, mass-conversion as the only means of putting an end to individual persecution (con sequently he takes as lightly as possible the concept "conver sión"-).

174 (Spring-Fall 1887; rev. Spring-Fall 1888) The Christian-Jewish life: here ressentiment did not pre dominate, Only the great persecutions could have developed this passion to this extent—the ardor of love as well as that of hatred.

When one sees ope's dearest sacrificed for one's faith, one becomes aggressive; we owe the triumph of Christianity to its per secutors.

The asceticism in Christianity is not specifically Christian: this is what Schopenhauer misunderstood: it only makes inroads into Christianity wherever asceticism also exists apart from Chris tianity.

Hypochondriac Christianity, the torturing and vivisection of the conscience, is in the same way only characteristic of a certain soil in which Christian values have taken root: it is not Chris tianity itself. Christianity has absorbed diseases of all kinds from morbid soil: one can only reproach it for its inability to guard against any infection. But that precisely is its essence: Christianity is a type of decadence.

(p106)





175 (Spring-Fall 1887; rev. Spring-Fall 1888) The reality upon which Christianity could be raised was the little Jewish family of the Diaspora, with its warmth and affection, with its readiness to help and sustain one another-munheard-of and perhaps not understood in the whole Roman Empire with its concealed pride of the "chosen" disguised as humility, with its innermost denial, untouched by envy, of all that is on top and possesses power and splendor. To have recognized in this a form of power, to have recognized that this blissful condition was com municable, seductive, infectious to pagans also--that was Paul's genius: to employ this store of latent energy, of prudent happiness for a "Jewish church of freer confession”--the entire Jewish ex perience and mastery of communal self-preservation under foreign rule, also Jewish propaganda-he divined that as his task. What he lit upon was just this absolutely unpolitical and withdrawn species of little people: their art of asserting themselves and pre vailing, cultivated through a number of virtues which constituted virtue in its entirety ("means by which a particular species of man preserves and enhances himself").

The principle of love derives from the little Jewish communi ties: it is a soul of the more passionate kind that glows here under the ashes of humility and wretchedness; this was neither Greek, por Indian, nor Germanic. The song in praise of love that Paul composed24 is nothing Christian, but à Jewish outburst of the eternal flame that is Semitic. If Christianity has done anything es sential psychologically, it is that it raised the temperature of the soul among those cooler and nobler races that were then on top; it was the discovery that the most wretched life can become rich and inestimable through a rise in temperature

It goes without saying that such a transference could not take place in respect to the ruling orders: the Jews and Christians had their bad manners against them and when allied to bad manners, strength and passion of soul are repellent and almost disgusting (-I see these bad manners whenever I read the New Testament).

* I Corinthians 13. The point Nietzsche makes here was utterly revo lutionary at that time and constitutes a major contribution to our under standing of Judaism and Christianity, even if the form of expression here is deliberately hyperbolical and paradoxical. For further discussion, see my Nietzsche, Chapter 12, section II.

(p107) One had to be related through lowliness and want to the type of lowly people who spoke here to feel their attraction

How one reacts to the New Testament is a test of whether one has any classical taste in one's bones (cf. Tacitus); whoever is not revolted by it, whoever does not honestly and profoundly sense something of foeda superstitio25 in it, something from which one withdraws one's hand as if to avoid being soiled, does not know what is classical. One must feel about the "cross" as Goethe did20.

176 (March-June 1888)

Reaction of the little people:- Love gives the greatest feeling of power. To grasp to what extent not man in general but a certain species of man speaks here. This is to be exhumed more precisely 27

"We are divine through love, we become 'children of God'; God loves us and wants nothing whatever from us save love"; this means: no morality, obedience, or activity produces that feeling of power that love produces; one does nothing bad from love, one does much more than one would do from obedience and virtue.

Here is the happiness of the herd, the feeling of community in great and small things, the living feeling of unity experienced as the sum of the feeling of life. Being helpful and useful and caring for others continually arouses the feeling of power; visible success, the expression of pleasure underlines the feeling of power; pride is not lacking, in the form of community, the abode of God, the "chosen."

What has in fact happened is that man has again experienced an altération of personality: this time he calls his feeling of love God. One must picture to oneself what the awakening of such a feeling is like: a kind of ecstasy, a strange language, a "gospel". it was this novelty that forbade him to ascribe love to himself he thought God was walking before him and coming alive within him.- "God descends to man," one's "neighbor" is transfigured into a god (in so far as he arouses the feeling of love). Jesus is

31 "Abominable superstition."

one's neighbor as soon as he is conceived as godhead, as a cause of the feeling of power.

177 (Jan.-Fall 1888)

The faithful are conscious that they are endlessly indebted to Christianity, and therefore conclude that its originator is a person age of the first rank- This conclusion is false, but it is typical of conclusions drawn by worshipers. Objectively considered, it is pos sible, first, that they are in error about the value of that for which they are indebted to Christianity: convictions prove nothing in favor of that of which one is convinced; in the case of religions they establish rather a suspicion against it-It is possible, secondly, that the debt to Christianity ought not to be ascribed to its founder but to the finished structure, to the whole thing, the church, etc. The concept originator" is so ambiguous it can even mean the accidental cause of a movement: the figure of the founder has been enlarged in proportion as the church has grown; but precisely this perspective of worship permits the conclusion that at some time or other this founder was something very uncertain and insecure, in the beginning. Consider with what degree of freedom Paul treats, indeed almost juggles with, the problem of the person of Jesus: someone who died, who was seen again after his death, who was delivered over to death by the Jews- A mere "motif": he then wrote the music to it- Azero in the beginning.28

179 (Nov. 1887-March 1888)

On the psychological problem of Christianity. The driving force is: ressentiment, the popular uprising, the revolt of the under privileged. (It is otherwise with Buddhism: this is not born out of a ressentiment movement but fights ressentiment because it leads to action.)

This peace party grasps that the renunciation of enmity in thought and deed is a condition of distinction and preservation.

* The final phrase is omitted in the standard editions.

(p109) Herein lies the psychological difficulty that has hampered the under standing of Christianity: the drive that created it forces one to fight against it as a matter of principle.

Only as a peace and innocence party has this insurrectionary movement any possibility of success: it must conquer through ex treme mildness, sweetness, softness; it grasps this by instinct Masterstroke: to deny and condemn the drive whose expression one is, continually to display, by word and deed, the antithesis of this drive

180 (Nov. 1887-March 1888)

Pretended youth. One is deceiving oneself if one imagines here a naive and youthful people rising up against an ancient cul ture; superstition has it that the deeper springs of life gushed forth anew in those classes of the lowliest people where Christianity grew and took root: one understands nothing of the psychology of Chris tianity if one takes it to be the expression of a newly arisen na tional youthfulness and racial invigoration. On the contrary: it is a typical form of decadence, the moral hypersensitivity and hysteria of a sick mishmash populace grown weary and aimless. The ex traordinary company that here gathered around this master-seducer Teally belongs wholly in a Russian növel: all the neuroses keep a rendezvous in them--the absence of duties, the instinct that every thing is really coming to an end, that nothing is worth while any more, contentment in a dolce far niente.20

The power and certainty of the future in the Jewish instinct, its tremendously tough will to exist and to power, lies in its ruling classes: those orders which primitive Christianity raised up are most clearly distinguished by the exhaustion of their instincts. On one händ, one has had enough: on the other, one is content with oneself, in oneself, for oneself.

Christianity as emancipated Judaism (in the same way as a local and racially conditioned nobility at length emancipates itself from these conditions and goes in search of related elements )

1. As church community) within the state, as an unpolitical structure;

2. As life, discipline, practice, art of living;

3. As religion of sin (of transgression against God as the only kind of transgression, as the sole cause of suffering in general), with a universal cure for it. There are only sins against God; men shall not judge acts done against men, nor demand a reckoning, except in the name of God, Ditto, all commands (love): every thing is associated with God and done to man for God's sake. A higher prudence lies in this a very narrow life, as with the Eskimos, is endurable only by the most peaceable and cautious disposition: Jewish-Christian dogma turns against sin in favor of the "sinner"--).

182 (Spring-Fall 1887) The Jewish priesthood had understood how to present every thing which it claimed as a divine precept, as obedience to a com mand of God also how to introduce whatever served to preserve Israel and make possible its existence (e.g., a number of works: circumcision, sacrificial, cult as the center of national conscious ness) not as nature, but as "God." This process continued; within Judaism, where the necessity for "works" was not felt (that is to say, as a means of segregation from the outside world), a priestly species of man could be conceived that behaved as the "noble nature" behaves toward the aristocracy; a classless and at the same time spontaneous priestliness of soul, which now, in order to contrast itself sharply with its opposite, attached value not to "works," but to the "disposition"

Fundamentally it was again the question of making a certain species of soul prevail: as it were, a popular uprising within a priestly people-a pietistic movement from below (sinners, publi cans, women, the sick). Jesus of Nazareth was the sign by which they recognized themselves. And again, in order to believe in them selves they need a theological transfiguration: they require nothing less than "the Son of God" to create a faith for themselves — And just as the priesthood had falsified the entire history of Israel, so again the attempt was here made to forge the history of mankind in general, so that Christianity might appear to be its most cardinal event. This movement could have arisen only on the soil of Juda ism, whose principal deed was to associate guilt with misfortune

(p111)

and to reduce all guilt to guilt against God: Christianity raised all this to the second power.

183 (Nov. 1887-March 1888)

The symbolism of Christianity is based on the Jewish, which had already resolved all reality (history, nature) into a holy un naturalness and unreality-which no longer recognized real history, which was no longer interested in natural consequences

184 (March-June 1888)

The Jews tried to prevail after they had lost two of their castes, that of the warrior and that of the peasant; in this sense they are the "castrated": they have the priests and then immedi ately, the chandala

As is only fair, a break develops among them, a revolt of the chandala: the origin of Christianity. .

Because they knew the warrior only as their master, they brought into their religion enmity toward the noble, toward the exalted and proud, toward power, toward the ruling orders they are pessimists from indignation

Thus they created an important new posture: the priest at the head of the chandala-against the noble orders

Christianity drew the ultimate conclusion of this movement: even in the Jewish priesthood it still sensed caste, the privileged, the noble—it abolished the priest

The Christian is the chandala who repudiates the priest-the chandala who redeems himself

That is why the French Revolution is the daughter and con tinuation of Christianity-its instincts are against caste, against the noble, against the last privileges

185 (Spring-Fall 1887)

The "Christian ideal": staged with Jewish subtlety. The basic psychological drives, its "nature":

the revolt against the ruling spiritual power;

attempt to make the virtues through which happiness is pos sible for the lowliest into the standard ideal of all values—to call it God: the instinct for preservation in the least vital classes;



(p112)



 to justify absolute abstention from war and resistance through this ideal—including obedience;

love of one another as consequence of love of God.

Artifice: to deny all natural mobilia and to transfer them to the spiritual realm beyond to exploit virtue and its veneration entirely for one's own ends, step by step to deny virtue to every thing non-Christian.

186 (Spring-Fall 1887) The profound contempt with which the Christian was treated in the noble areas of classical antiquity is of a kind with the present instinctive aversion to Jews: it is the hatred of the free and self respecting orders for those who are pushing and who combine timid and awkward gestures with an absurd opinion of their worth.

The New Testament is the gospel of a wholly ignoble species of man; their claim to possess more value, indeed to possess all value, actually has something revolting about it-even today,

187 (Spring-Fall 1887) How little the subject matters! It is the spirit that gives life! What stuffy and sickroom air arises from all that excited chatter about "redemption," love, blessedness, faith, truth, "eternal life"! Take, on the other hand, a really pagan book, e.g., Petronius, where fundamentally nothing is done, said, desired and valued but what by peevish Christian standards is sin, mortal sin even. And yet how pleasant is the purer air, the superior spirituality of its quicker pace, the liberated and overflowing strength that feels sure of the future! In the entire New Testament there is not one single bouffonnerie: but that fact refutes a book

188 (Spring-Fall 1887)

The profound unworthiness with which all life outside the Christian life is condemned: they are not content with thinking meanly of their real opponents, they require nothing less than a collective defamation of everything which is not themselves. Arro gance of holiness gets along famously with a base and crafty soul: witness the first Christians.

The future: they see they are well paid— Theirs is the most

(p113) uncleanly kind of spirit there is. The entire life of Christ is so presented as to help to justify the prophecies: he acts in this way in order that they may be justified

189 (Spring-Fall 1887)

The lying interpretation of the words, gestures and conditions of the dying: fear of death, for example, is systematically confused with fear of the "after death"_30:

190 (Spring-Fall 1887)

The Christians did as the Jews did and put into the mouth of their master and encrusted his life with what they conceived to be a condition of their existence and an innovation. At the same time they restored to him all proverbial wisdom-: in short, they repre sented their actual life and activity as obedience and thus, as sancti fied for their propaganda,

What it all depends upon can be gathered from Paul: it is not much. What remains is the elaboration of a type of saint on the basis of what they considered holy.

The entire "miraculous doctrine," including the resurrection, is a consequence of self-glorification by the community, which ascribed to its master in a higher degree whatever it thought itself capable of (it derived its strength from him—).

191 (Nov. 1887-March 1888)

Christians have never put into practice the acts Jesus pre scribed for them, and the impudent chatter about "justification by faith" and its unique and supreme significance is only the conse quence of the church's lack of courage and will to confess the works which Jesus demanded,

The Buddhist acts differently from the non-Buddhist; the Christian acts as all the world does and possesses a Christianity of ceremonies and moods.

"Faith" or "works"?- But that "works," the habit of certain works, should engender a certain evaluation and finally a certain disposition is as natural as it is unnatural that mere evaluation should produce "works."

Faith is a pons asinorum.8.1 The background is a profound conviction on the part of Luther and his kind of their incapacity for Christian works, a personal fact disguised beneath an extreme doubt as to whether activity of all kinds is not sin and the work of the Devil: so that the value of existence resides in single highly tensed conditions of inactivity (prayer, effusion, etc.). In the last resort he was right: the in stincts expressed in all the actions of the Reformers are the most brutal that exist. Only by an absolute turning away from them selves, by absorption in their opposite, only as an illusion ("faith”) was existence endurable to them.

movement of antiquity, formulated through the employment of the life, teaching and "words" of the founder of Christianity but inter preted in an absolutely arbitrary way after the pattern of funda mentally different needs; translated into the language of every already existing subterranean religion

It is the rise of pessimism ( while Jesus wanted to bring peace and the happiness of lambs): and moreover the pessimism of the weak, the inferior, the suffering, the oppressed.

Its mortal enemy is (1) power in character, spirit and taste; "worldliness"; (2) classical "happiness, the noble levity and skep ticism, the hard pride, the eccentric intemperance and the cool self sufficiency of the sage, Greek refinement in gesture, word, and form. Its mortal enemy is the Roman just as much as the Greek,

Attempt by antipaganism to found and make itself possible philosophically; predilection for the ambiguous figures of the old culture, above all for Plato, that instinctive Semite and anti-Hellene -also for Stoicism, which is essentially the work of Semites ( "dignity" as strictness, law, virtue as greatness, self-responsi bility, authority, as supreme sovereignty over one's own person this is Semitic. The Stoic is an Arabian sheik wrapped in Greek togas and concepts). 82

196 (Nov. 1887-March 1888) Christianity only takes up the fight that had already begun against the classical ideal and the noble religion.

In fact, this entire transformation is an adaption to the needs and the level of understanding of the religious masses of that time: those masses which believed in Isis, Mithras, Dionysus, the “Great Mother," and which desired of a religion: (1) hope of a beyond, (2) the bloody phantasmagoria of the sacrificial animal (the mys tery), (3) the redemptive deed, the holy legend, (4) asceticism, world-denial, superstitious "purification," (5) a hierarchy, a form of community. In short: Christianity accommodated itself to already existing and established antipaganism, to the cults that had been combatted by Epicurus-more precisely, to the religions of the lower masses, the women, the slaves, the non-noble classes.

We therefore have the following misunderstandings:

* Zeno of Citium, on Cyprus, the founder of the Stoic school, was prob ably a Semite.116

5. the whole world of corrupt imagination and morbid affects instead of a kindly and simple way of life, instead of a Buddhistic happiness attainable on earth;

6. an ecclesiastical order with priesthood, theology, cult, sacrament; in short, everything that Jesus of Nazareth had com batted;

7. miracles, all over, superstition: while the distinguishing mark of Judaism and earliest Christianity is its repugnance to miracles, its relative rationality...

The psychological presupposition: lack of knowledge and culture, ignorance which has forgotten all shame: imagine these impudent saints in Athens;

the Jewish instinct of the "chosen": they claim all the virtues for themselves without further ado, and count the rest of the world their opposites; a profound sign of a vulgar soul;

a complete lack of real aims, of real tasks, for which one needs other virtues than those of the bigot—the state took this work from their shoulders: these impudent people nonetheless behaved as if they had no need of the state. .

The founder of Christianity had to pay for having directed himself to the lowest class of Jewish society and intelligence. They conceived him in the spirit they understood- It is a real disgrace to have concocted a salvation story, a personal God, a personal redeemer, a personal immortality and to have retained all the mean ness of the "person" and "history” in a doctrine that contests the reality of all that is personal and historical

Nothing is less innocent than the New Testament. One knows from what soil. it sprang. This people of an inflexible self-will which knew how to prevail after it had lost every natural support and had long since forfeited its right to existence, and to that end had to raise itself up by unnatural, purely imaginary presupposi tions (as chosen people, as community of saints, as the people of the promise, as "church"): this people handled the pia frausa3 with such perfection, such a degree of "good conscience," that one cannot be sufficiently cautious when it preaches morality. When Jews step forward as innocence itself, then the danger is great: one should always have one's little fund of reason, mistrust, and malice to hand when one reads the New Testament,

People of the basest origin, in part rabble, outcasts - not only from good but also from respectable society, raised away from even the smell of culture, without discipline, without knowledge, without the remotest suspicion that there is such a thing as con science in spiritual matters; simply-Jews: with an instinctive ability to create an advantage, a means of seduction out of every superstitious supposition, out of ignorance itself.84

201 (Spring-Fall 1887) However modest one may be in one's demand for intellectual cleanliness, one cannot help feeling, when coming into contact with the New Testament, a kind of inexpressible discomfiture: for the unchecked impudence with which the least qualified want to raise their voice on the greatest problems, and even claim to be judges of such things, surpasses all measure. The shameless levity with which the most intractable problems (life, world, God, purpose

of life) are spoken of, as if they were not problems at all but simply things that these little bigots knew!

202 (Spring-Fall 1887; rev. Spring-Fall 1888)

This was the most fatal kind of megalomania there has ever been on earth: when these lying little abortions of bigots began to lay claim to the words "God," "Last Judgment," "truth," "love," "wisdom," "Holy Spirit" and with them made a boundary between themselves and "the world", when this species of man began to reverse values according to his own image, as if he were the mean ing, the salt, the measure, and the standard of all the rest one should have built madhouses for them and nothing more. That one persecuted them was a piece of ancient folly in the grand manner: that meant taking them too seriously, that meant making something scrious out of them.

The whole fatality was made possible by the presence in the world already of a similar kind of megalomania, the Jewish (once the chasm had opened up between the Jews and the Christian-Jews, the Christian-Jews had to employ once more and in an ultimate intensification for their own self-preservation the self-preservative procedures devised by the Jewish instinct -); on the other hand, Greek moral philosophy had already done everything to prepare the way for and to make palatable moral fanaticism even among Greeks and Romans-Plato, the great viaduct of corruption, who first refused to see nature in morality, who had already debased the Greek gods with his concept "good," who was already marked by Jewish bigotry (in Egypt?)

203 (Spring-Fall 1887; rev. Spring-Fall 1888) On the denaturing of morality. These little herd-animal vir tues do not by any means lead to "eternal life": to put them on show in this way, and oneself with them, may be very clever, but to him who keeps his eyes open even here, it remains in spite of all the most ludicrous of all plays. One does not by any means deserve a privileged position on earth and in heaven by attaining perfection as a little, good-natured sheep; one remains at best a little, good-natured, absurd sheep with horns provided one does not burst with vanity--as the court chaplains d035-or provoke scandal by posing as a judge. "

What a tremendous transfiguration of color here illumines the little virtues—as if they were the reflection of divine qualities!

The natural task and utility of every virtue is systematically hushed up; it is of value only with reference to a divine command, a divine model, only with reference to heavenly and spiritual goods. (Magnificent: as if it had to do with "salvation of the soul": but it was a means of "enduring" things here with as many beautiful feelings as possible.)

The law, the thoroughly realistic formalization of certain con ditions for the self-preservation of a community, forbids certain actions directed to certain ends, namely those that are directed against the community: it does not forbid the disposition that pro duces these actions for it needs these actions for other ends, namely against the enemies of the community. Then the moral idealist appears and says: "God beholds the heart: the action itself is nothing; one must exterminate the aggressive disposition that produces it-” Under normal conditions one laughs at this; only in those exceptional instances when a community lives absolutely outside the necessity of waging war for its existence does one lend an ear to such things. One abandons a disposition whose utility is no longer apparent.

This was the case, e.g., when Buddha appeared amidst a very peaceable and even spiritually exhausted community.

36 These words a dig at Hofprediger Stöcker, the leading German anti Semite of the time are found only in 1911, p. 502. This is also true of the title of this section. For Stöcker see also 89 and 191 above.

This was also the case with the earliest Christian community (also Jewish community), whose presupposition is the absolutely unpolitical Jewish society. Christianity could grow only in the soil of Judaism, i.e., amidst a people that had already renounced poli tics and lived a kind of parasitic existence within the Roman order of things. Christianity is a step further on: one is even more free to "emasculate" oneself-circumstances permit it.

One drives nature out of morality when one says "Love your enemies": for then the natural "Thou shalt love thy neighbor and hate thy enemy" in the law (in instinct) has become meaningless; then this love of one's neighbor must also find a new basis (as a kind of love of God). Everywhere, God is iriserted and utility withdrawn; everywhere the real origin of morality is denied: the veneration of nature, which lies precisely in the recognition of a natural morality, is destroyed at its roots

Whence comes the seductive charm of such an emasculated ideal of man? Why are we not disgusted by it as we are perhaps disgusted by the idea of a castrato? - The answer lies precisely here: the voice of a castrato does not disgust us, despite the cruel mutilation that is its condition: it has grown sweeter Just be cause the "male organ" has been amputated from virtue, a feminine note has been brought to the voice of virtue that it did not have before.

If we think, on the other hand, of the fearful hardship, danger, and accidents that a life of manly virtue brings with it--the life of a Corsican even today or that of the pagan Arab (which is similar even in its details to the life of the Corsican: their songs might have been written by Corsicans)-We grasp how precisely the most robust kind of man is fascinated and affected by this lust ful note of "goodness," of "purity". A shepherd's song--an idyl ---the "good man”: these things produce the strongest effect in ages when tragedy walks abroad.

But we have with this also recognized to what extent the "idealist" (-ideal-castrato) also emerges from a quite definite reality and is not merely a fantasist--he has arrived at the knowl edge that for his kind of reality such a coarse injunction forbidding definite actions has no meaning (because the very instinct for these actions has been weakened through long lack of practice, of need

(p121)

for practice). The castrator formulates a number of new self preservative measures for men of a quite definite species: in this he is a realist. His means of legislation are the same as those of the older legislators: the appeal to authority of all kinds, to "God," the employment of the concept "guilt and punishment"-ie., he makes use of all the appurtenances of the older ideal, only in a new interpretation, punishment, for example, made more inward (perhaps as the pang of conscience).

In practice this species of man goes under as soon as the ex ceptional conditions of his existence cease a kind of Tahiti and island happiness, as in the life of the little Jews in the provinces. Their only natural opponent is the soil from which they grew: against this they need to fight, against this they must let the offen sive and defensive affects grow again; their opponents are the adherents of the old ideal (—this species of enmity is championed on a grand scale by Paul in relation to Judaism, by Luther in rela tion to the priestly-ascetic ideal). The mildest form of this oppo sition is certainly that of the early Buddhists: perhaps no greater amount of work has been expended upon anything than upon the discouragement and weakening of feelings of emnity. The fight against ressentiment seems to be almost the first duty of the Bud dhist: only thus is peace of soul assured. To disengage oneself, but without rancor: that presupposes, to be sure, an astonishingly mild and sweet humanity-saints

The prudence of moral castrationism.-- How can one wage war against the manly affects and valuations? One possesses no means of physical force, one can wage only a war of cunning, sorcery, lies, in short "of the spirit."

First recipe: one claims virtue in general for one's ideal; one negates the older ideal to the point of presenting it as the antithesis of all ideals. For this one employs an art of defamation.

Second recipe: one sets up one's own type as the measure of value in general; one projects it into things, behind things, behind the fate of things—as God.

Third recipe: one sets up the opponent of one's ideal as the opponent of God; one fabricates for oneself the right to great pathos, to power, to curse and to bless.

Fourth recipe: one derives all suffering, all that is uncanny,



(p122)





fearful and fateful in existence from opposition to one's own ideal: -all suffering is punishment, even in the case of one's followers (unless it accompanies a test, etc.).

Fifth recipe; one goes so far as to conceive nature as the antithesis of one's own ideal; one regards it as a great test of patience, as a sort of martyrdom to endure natural conditions for very long; one practices dédain30 of mien and manners in respect to all "natural things."

Sixth recipe: the victory of unnaturalness, of the castrationist ideal, the victory of the world of the pure, good, sinless, blessed is projected into the future as conclusion, finale, great hope, as the "coming of the kingdom of God."

I hope that at this artificial inflation of a small species into the absolute measure of things one is still permitted to laugh?

205 (Spring-Fall 1887)

I do not like at all about that Jesus of Nazareth or his apostle Paul that they put so many ideas into the heads of little people, as if their modest virtues were of any consequence. We have had to pay too dearly for it: for they have brought the more valuable qualities of virtue and man into ill repute; they have set the bad conscience of the noble soul against its self-sufficiency; they have led astray, to the point of self-destruction, the brave, magnanimous, daring, excessive inclinations of the strong soul.

206 (Spring-Fall 1887)

In the New Testament, and specifically in the Gospels, I hear absolutely nothing "divine" speaking: much rather an indirect form of the most abysmal rage for defamation and destruction-one of the most dishonorable forms of hatred. It lacks all knowledge of the qualities of a higher nature. Clumsy abuse of all kinds of phili ştinism, the entire treasury of proverbs is laid claim to and fully utilized; was it necessary for a god to come in order to say to these publicans etc.

Nothing is more vulgar than this battle against the Pharisees with the aid of an absurd and impractical moral pretence, the peo ple have always taken pleasure in such a tour de force. The re proach of "hypocrisy!" coming from this mouth! Nothing is more

* Disdain.

(p123) vulgar than this kind of treatment of an opponent a most in sidious criterion of nobility or its reverse

207 (Nov. 1887-March 1888)

Primitive Christianity is abolition of the state: forbids oaths, war service, courts of justice, self-defense and the defense of any kind of community, the distinction between fellow countrymen and foreigners, and also the differentiation of classes.

Christ's example: he does not resist those who are harming him; he does not defend himself; he does more: he "turns the other cheek" (to the question: "Tell us whether thou be the Christ" he answers: "Hereafter shall ye see the Son of Man sitting on the right hand of power and coming in the clouds of heaven"). He forbids his disciples to defend him; he makes it clear that he could get help but will not.

Christianity is also abolition of society: it prefers all that society counts of little worth, it grows up among outcasts and the condemned, among lepers of all kinds, "sinners," "publicans," prostitutes, the most stupid folk (the "fishers"); it disdains the rich, the learned, the noble, the virtuous, the "correct"

of society: iz Outcasts blicans,"

208 (Nov. 1887-March 1888)

The war against the noble and powerful as it is waged in the New Testament is a war after the manner of Reynard the Fox and with the same methods: but always with priestly unction and a decided refusal to recognize one's own cunning.

209 (Nov, 1887-March 1888)

The gospel: the news that a gateway to happiness stands open for the poor and lowly--that all one has to do is free oneself from the institutions, traditions, guardianship of the upper classes: to this extent the rise of Christianity is nothing more than the typical socialist doctrine.

Property, gain, fatherland, rank and status, tribunals, police, state, church, education, art, the army: all are so many hindrances to happiness, errors, snares, works of the devil, upon which the gospel passes judgment--all typical of socialist doctrine.

In the background is insurrection, the explosion of a stored-up



(p124)



 antipathy towards the "masters," the instinct for how much happi ness could lie, after such long oppression, simply in feeling oneself free-- (Usually a sign that the lower orders have been too well treated, their tongues have already tasted a happiness forbidden them. It is not hunger that provokes revolutions, but that the people have acquired an appetite en mangeant37—).

210 (Spring-Fall 1887)

Read the New Testament as a book of seduction: virtue is appropriated in the instinct that with it one can capture public opinion--and indeed the most modest virtue, which recognizes the ideal sheep and nothing further (including the shepherd.--): a little, sweet, well-meaning, helpful, and enthusiastically cheer ful kind of virtue that expects absolutely nothing from the outside --that sets itself altogether apart from "the world." The most ab surd arrogance, as if on one hand the community represented all that is right, and on the other the world all that is false, eternally reprehensible, and rejected, and as if the destiny of mankind re volved about this fact. The most absurd hatred toward everything in power: but without touching it! A kind of inner detachment that outwardly leaves everything as it was (servitude and slavery; to know how to turn everything into a means of serving God and

virtue).

211 (Spring-Fall 1887; rev. Spring-Fall 1888)

Christianity is possible as the most private form of existence; it presupposes a narrow, remote, completely unpolitical society it belongs in the conventicle. A "Christian state," "Christian poli tics," on the other hand, are a piece of impudence, a lie, like for instance a Christian leadership of an army, which finally treats the "God of Hosts" as if he were chief of staff. The papacy, too, has never been in a position to carry on Christian politics; and when reformers indulge in politics, as Luther did, one sees that they are just as much followers of Machiavelli as any immoralist or tyrant.

212 (Nov. 1887-March 1888) Christianity is still possible at any time. It is not tied to any

BOOK TWO: Critique of Highest Values of the impudent dogmas that have adorned themselves with its name: it requires neither the doctrine of a personal God, nor that of sin, nor that of immortality, nor that of redemption, nor that of faith; it has absolutely no need of metaphysics, and even less of asceticism, even less of a Christian "natural science." Chris tianity is a way of life, not a system of beliefs. It tell us how to act; not what we ought to believe.

Whoever says today: "I will not be a soldier," "I care nothing for the courts," "I shall not claim the services of the police," "I will do nothing that may disturb the peace within me: and if I must suffer on that account, nothing will serve better to maintain my peace than suffering"-he would be a Christian.38

213 (Nov. 1887-March 1888)

Toward a history of Christianity. Continual change of milieu: Christian doctrine is therefore continually changing its emphasis Favoring of lowly and little people- The development of cari tasao_ The type "Christian" reassumes step by step everything that it originally negated (in the negation of which it endured ). The Christian becomes citizen, soldier, judge, worker, merchant, scholar, theologian, priest, philosopher, farmer, artist, patriot, politician, "prince"- he takes up again all the activities he has forsworn (self-defense, judgment, punishment, oath-taking, dis tinguishing between nation and nation, contempt, wrath-). The whole life of the Christian is at last exactly the life from which Christ preached deliverance

The church is what is as much a symptom of the triumph of the anti-Christian as the modern state, modern nationalism The church is the barbarization of Christianity.

214 (Nov. 1887-March 1888)

These have mastered Christianity: Judaism (Paul); Plato nism (Augustine); the mystery cult (doctrine of redemption, emblem of the "cross"); asceticism (enmity toward "nature," "reason," "the senses"--the Orient-).

215 (Spring-Fall 1887) Christianity as a denaturalization of herd-animal morality: accompanied by absolute misunderstanding and self-deception. Democratization is a more natural form of it, one less mendacious.

Datum: the oppressed, the lowly, the great masses of slaves and semi-slaves desire power,

First step: they make themselves free--they ransom them selves, in imagination at first, they recognize one another, they prevail.

Second step: they enter into battle, they demand recognition, equal rights, "justice."

Third step: they demand privileges (they draw the repre sentatives of power over to their side).

Fourth step: they demand exclusive power, and they get it--

In Christianity, three elements must be distinguished: (a) the oppressed of all kinds, (b) the mediocre of all kinds, (c) the dis contented and sick of all kinds. With the first element Christianity fights against the political nobility and its ideal; with the second element, against the exceptional and privileged (spiritually, physic ally-) of all kinds; with the third element, against the natural instinct of the healthy and happy.

When a victory is won, the second element steps into the fore ground; for then Christianity has persuaded the healthy and happy to its side (as warriors in its cause), likewise the powerful (as interested parties on account of the conquest of the mob) and now it is the herd instinct, the mediocre nature which is of value from any point of view, which gets its supreme sanction through Christianity. This mediocre nature at last grows so conscious of itself (---acquires courage for itself-) that it arrogates even politi cal power to itself

Democracy is Christianity made natural: a kind of "return to nature" after, on account of its extreme antinaturalness, it could be overcome by the opposite values.- Consequence: the aristo cratic ideal henceforth loses its naturalness ("the higher man," "noble," "artist," "passion," "knowledge," etc.; romanticism as cult of the exception, the genius, ctc.).

(p127)

216 (Spring-Fall 1887; rev. Spring-Fall 1888) When the "masters" could also become Christians. It lies in the instinct of a community (family, race, herd, tribe) to feel that the conditions and desires to which it owes its survival are valuable in themselves, e.g., obedience, reciprocity, consideration, moderation, sympathy-consequently to suppress everything that contradicts or stands in the way of them.

Likewise, it lies in the instinct of the rulers (be they indi viduals or classes) to patronize and applaud the virtues that make their subjects useful and submissive ( conditions and affects which may be as different as can be from their own).

The herd instinct and the instinct of the rulers agree in praising a certain number of qualities and conditions--but for differing reasons: the former from direct egoism, the latter from indirect egoism.

Submission of the master races to Christianity is essentially the consequence of the insight that Christianity is a herd religion, that it teaches obedience: in short, that Christians are easier to rule than non-Christians. With this hint, the pope recommends Christian propaganda to the emperor of China even today.

It should be added that the seductive force of the Christian ideal works most strongly perhaps upon such natures as love danger, adventure and opposition-as love all that involves risking themselves while at the same time engendering a non plus ultra of the feeling of power. Consider Saint Teresa, surrounded by the heroic instincts of her brothers:- Christianity here appears as a form of orgy of the will, of strength of will, as a heroic quixotism

When and where has any man of consequence resembled the Christian ideal at least in such eyes as a psychologist and student of man must have?-check all of Plutarch's heroes.

218 (Nov. 1837-March 1888)

Our pre-eminence: we live in the age of comparison, we can verify as has never been verified before: we are in every way the self-consciousness of history. We enjoy differently, we suffer dif ferently: our instinctive activity is to compare an unheard-of number of things. We understand everything, we experience every thing, we no longer have in us any hostile feelings. Although we may harm ourselves by it, our importunate and almost aniorous

inquisitiveness attacks, unabashed, the most dangerous things

"Everything is good”-it requires an effort for us to deny anything. We suffer if we should happen to be so unintelligent as to take sides against anything Fundamentally, it is we scholars who today best fulfill the teaching of Christ

219 (1885-1886) Irony against those who believe Christianity has been over come by the modern natural sciences, Christian value judgments have not by any means been overcome this way. "Christ on the cross" is the most sublime symbol—even today.

220 (Nov. 1887-March 1888)

The two great nihilistic movements: (a) Buddhism, (b) Christianity. The latter has only now attained to approximately the state of culture in which it can fulfill its original vocation-a level to which it belongs in which it can show itself pure.

221 (Nov, 1887-March 1888)

We have recovered the Christian ideal: it remains to determine its value:

www.

God, the faith in God, matter to us any longer? 'God' today merely a faded word, not even a concept any longer!) But as Voltaire says on his deathbed: 'only don't speak of that man there!'

(p129) 1. What values are negated by it? What does its counterideal comprise?— Pride, pathos of distance, great responsibility, exuber ance, splendid animality, the instincts that delight in war and con quest, the deification of passion, of revenge, of cunning, of anger, of voluptuousness, of adventure, of knowledge the noble ideal is negated: the beauty, wisdom, power, splendor and dangerous ness of the type "man"; the man who fixes goals, the "man of the future" (here Christianity appears as a logical consequence of Judaism ).

2. Can it be realized? — Yes, under the right climatic con ditions, as the Indian ideal was. Work is missing in both.— It detaches the individual from people, state, cultural community, jurisdiction; it rejects education, knowledge, cultivation of good manners, gain, commerce—it lets everything go that comprises the usefulness and value of man-it shuts him off by means of an idiosyncrasy of feeling. Unpolitical, antinational, neither aggressive nor defensive-possible only within the most firmly ordered political and social life, which allows these holy parasites to pro liferate at public expense

3. It is a consequence of the will to pleasure and to nothing else! "Blessedness" counts as something self-evident, which no longer requires any justification everything else (how to live and let live) is only a means to an end

But this way of thinking is base: fear of pain, of defilement, of corruption as a sufficient motive for letting everything go This is a wretched way of thinking--- Sign of an exhausted race One should not let oneself be deceived. ("Become as little chil dren"- of related nature: Francis of Assisi, neurotic, epileptic, a visionary, like Jesus.)

222 (Nov. 1887-March 1888)

The higher man is distinguished from the lower by his fear lessness and his readiness to challenge misfortune: it is a sign of degeneration when eudaemonistic valuations begin to prevail (-physiological fatigue, feebleness of will—). Christianity, with its perspective of "blessedness," is a mode of thought typical of a suffering and feeble species of man. Abundant strength wants to create, suffer, go under: the Christian salvation-for-bigots is bad music to it, and its hieratic posture an annoyance.



(p130)





223 (1885-1886) Poverty, humility, and chastity-dangerous and slanderous ideals, but, like poisons in the case of certain illnesses, useful cures, e.g., in the Roman imperial era.

All ideals are dangerous: because they debase and brand the actual; all are poisons, but indispensable as temporary cures.

224 (Nov. 1887-March 1888)

God created man happy, idle, innocent, and immortal: our actual life is a false, decayed, sinful existence, an existence of punishment- Suffering, struggle, work, death are considered as objections and question marks against life, as something that ought not to last; for which one requires a cure--and has a cure!

From the time of Adam until now, man has been in an abnormal state: God himself has sacrificed his son for the guilt of Adam, in order to put an end to this abnormal state: the natural character of life is a curse; Christ gives back the state of normality to him who believes in him: he makes him happy, idle and inno cent.-- But the earth has not begun to be fruitful without work; women do not bear children without pain; sickness has not ceased; the most devout believers have just as hard a time of it here as the least devout unbelievers. That man has been freed from death and sin (assertions which permit of no verification) -has been asserted by the church with all the more emphasis. "He is free from sin" — not through his own deed, not through a stern struggle on his part, but ransomed for freedom through the act of redemption-conse

quently perfect, innocent, paradisiacal

The true life is only a faith (i.e., a self-deception, a madness). The whole of struggling, battling, actual existence, full of splendor and darkness, only a bad, false existence: the task is to be redeemed from it.

"Man innocent, idle, immortal, happy"—this conception of "supreme desiderata" must be criticized above all. Why are guilt, work, death, suffering (and, from a Christian viewpoint, knowl edge ) contrary to the supreme desiderata?- The lazy Christian concepts "blessedness," "innocence," "immortality" —

(p131)

225 (Nov. 1887-March 1888)

The eccentric concept of "holiness" is lacking--"God" and "man” have not been torn asunder. "Miracles" are lacking--this sphere simply isn't there: the only sphere worth consideration is the "spiritual” (i.e., the symbolic-psychological). As decadence: pendant to "epicureanism". Paradise, as conceived by the Greeks, also only the "garden of Epicurus."

Any task is lacking in such a life:-- it desires nothing; a form of the "Epicurean gods;" all reason is lacking to set up any further goals, to have children:- everything has been attained.

226 (March-June 1888)

They despised the body: they left it out of the account: more, they treated it as an enemy. It was their delusion to believe that one could carry a "beautiful soul" about in a cadaverous abor

tion- To make this conceivable to others they needed to present the concept "beautiful soul" in a different way, to revalue the natural value, until at last a pale, sickly, idiotically fanatical crea ture was thought to be perfection, "angelic," transfiguration, higher man.

227 (Jan.-Fall 1888)

Ignorance in psychologicis the Christian bas no nervous sys tem-; contempt for, and a deliberate desire to disregard the demands of the body, the discovery of the body; the presupposition that this is in accordance with the higher nature of man, that it must necessarily be good for the soul; the systematic reduction of all bodily feelings to moral values; illness itself conceived as morally conditioned, perhaps as punishment or as testing or also as a state of salvation in which man becomes more perfect than he could be if he were healthy (Pascal's idea); under certain circumstances, making oneself sick deliberately.

228 (1883-1888)

What, then, is this struggle of the Christian "against nature"? Do not let us be deceived by his words and explanations! It is



(p132)



 nature against something that is also nature. With many it is fear, with some disgust, with others a certain spirituality, with the best, love of an ideal without flesh and desires, of an "abstraction from nature”--these try to live up to their ideal. It goes without saying that humility in place of self-reliance, anxious circumspection toward the desires, liberation from normal duties (whereby a higher feeling of rank is re-created), the incitement of a continual war over tremendous things, habituation to effusions of feeling all this composes a type: in this type the excitability of a degenerate body predominates, but this nervousness and the inspirations it induces are interpreted otherwise. The taste of natures of this kind tends (1) to subtlety, (2) to floweriness, (3) to extreme feelings.

Natural inclinations are satisfied, but under a new form of interpretation, e.g., as "justification before God," "the feeling of redemption through grace" (every undeniable pleasant feeling is interpreted thus! ), pride, voluptuousness, etc.

General problem: what will become of the man who defames' the natural, and denies and degrades it in practice? In fact, the Christian proves himself to be an exaggerated form of self-control: in order to restrain his desires he seems to find it necessary to extirpate or crucify them.

229 (March-June 1888)

Through the long succession of millennia, man has not known himself physiologically: he does not know himself even today. To know, e.g., that one has a nervous system (-but no "soul"-) is still the privilege of the best informed. But man is not content not to know in this case, One must be very humane to say "I don't know that," to afford ignorance.

If he is suffering or in a good mood, he has no doubt that he can find the reason for it if only he looks. So he looks for the reason-. In truth, he cannot find the reason, because he does not even suspect where he ought to look for it-- What happens? He takes a consequence of his condition for its cause; e.g., a work undertaken in a good mood (really undertaken because the good mood had provided the courage for it) succeeds: ecco, the work is the reason for the good mood. In fact, the success was deter mined by the same thing that determined the good mood—by the happy coordination of physiological forces and systems,

133

BOOK TWO: Critique of Highest Values He feels ill: and consequently he has not got over some worry, some scruple, some self-criticism.-- In truth, the man believes his ill condition is a consequence of his scruple, his "sin," his "self criticism"

But the condition of recovery returns, often after a profound exhaustion and prostration. "How is it possible for me to feel so free, so redeemed? It is a miracle; only a god can have performed that."- Conclusion: "He has forgiven me my sin"—

From this there follows a certain practice: to excite feelings of sin, to prepare the way for contrition, one has to reduce the body to a morbid and nervous condition. The method of doing this is well known. As one might expect, there is no suspicion of the causal logic of the case: there is a religious interpretation of the mortification of the flesh, it seems an end in itself, whereas it is only a means of making possible the morbid indigestion of repentance (the "idée fixe" of sin, the hypnotizing of the hen by the chalk line "sin").

The maltreatment of the body prepares the ground for the sequence of "feelings of guilt," i.e., a general state of suffering that demands an explanation

On the other hand, the method of "redemption" follows in the same way: one provokes all kinds of orgies of feeling by prayers, motions, gestures, oaths exhaustion follows, often abruptly, often in the form of epilepsy. And after a condition of deep somnolence comes the appearance of recovery—in religious language: "redemp tion."40a

230 (Jan.-Fall 1888)

Formerly one considered these conditions and consequences of physiological exhaustion more important than conditions of health and their consequences, because they are rich in the sudden, the fearful, the inexplicable and the incalculable. One was afraid: one postulated here a higher world. Sleep and dream, shadows, the night, natural terrors, have been held responsible for the creation of two worlds: above all, the symptoms of physiological exhaustion should have been considered in this regard. The ancient religions actually disciplined the pious into a condition of exhaustion in

The exhaustion is in this case a racial exhaustion: sleep, regarded psychologically, is only a symbol of a much deeper and longer compulsion to rest In practice it is death that works so seductively behind the image of its brother, sleep

The entire Christian training in repentance and redemption can be conceived as a deliberately provoked folie circulaire:41 but, as one might expect, producible only in predestined, that is, mor bidly inclined individuals.

233 (March-June 1888) Against remorse and the purely psychological treatment of it. To be unable to have done with an experience is already a sign of decadence. This reopening of old wounds, this wallowing in self-contempt and contrition, is one more illness, out of which no "salvation of the soul" can arise but only a new form of soul sickness

These "states of redemption" in the Christian are mere varia tions of one and the same diseased state-interpretations of the epileptic crisis by a certain formula supplied, not by science, but by religious delusion.

One is good in a sickly manner when one is sick- We now count the greater part of the psychological apparatus with which Christianity operated as forms of hysteria and epilepsy.

The entire practice of psychological healing must be put back

" An earlier name for manic-depressive insanity, sometimes rendered as alternating insanity.

(p135) on to a physiological basis: the "bite” of conscience as such is a hindrance to recovery-one must try to counterbalance it all by new activities, in order to escape from the sickness of self-torture as quickly as possible One should discredit the purely psycho logical practice of the church and the sects as harmful to health, One cannot cure an invalid by prayers and the exorcizing of evil spirits: the conditions of "repose" that supervene under the influ ence of such things are very far from inspiring confidence, in a psychological sense

One is healthy when one can laugh at the earnestness and zeal with which one has been hypnotized by any single detail of our life, when one feels that the "bite" of conscience is like a dog biting on a stone-when one is ashamed of one's remorse

Previous practice, which was purely religious and psycho logical, aimed only at a change in the symptoms: it held a man to be cured when he abased himself before the cross and swore to be a good man- But a criminal who with a certain sombre serious ness cleaves to his fate and does not slander his deed after it is done has more health of soul The criminals among whom Dos toevsky lived in prison were one and all unbroken natures are they not worth a hundred times more than a "broken" Christian?

(-I recommend that the "bite" of conscience be treated with Mitchell's cure42 )

234 (1883-1888) The "bite" of conscience: sign that the character is not equal to the deed. There is such a thing as a "bite" of conscience after good works: the unfamiliar in them, that which raises them out of the old milieu.—43

The "rest cure" of Dr. Silas Weir Mitchell (1829-1914, American), consisting primarily in isolation, confinement to bed, dieting, and massage. Cf. Genealogy I, section 6, where Nietzsche mentions isolation and over eating.

" With sections 233-35 compare section 10 of the first chapter of Twilight (Portable Nietzsche, p. 467): "Not to perpetrate cowardice against one's own acts! Not to leave them in the lurch afterward! The bite of conscience is indecent."

The influence of these passages and others on Sartre's The Flies is dis cussed in detail in my essay on "Nietzsche between Homer and Sartre: Five Treatments of the Orestes Story," in Révue Internationale de Philoso phie, 67 (1964.1), especially pp. 65-73.136

THL WILL TO POWER

ALLIONS,

235 (Spring-Fall 1887; rev. Spring-Fall 1888) Against remorse.-- I do not like this kind of cowardice toward one's own deeds; one should not leave oneself in the lurch at the onset of unanticipated shame and embarrassment. An extreme+4 pride, rather, is in order. After all, what is the good of it! No deed can be undone by being regretted; no more than by being "forgiven" or "atoned for." One would have to be a theo logian to believe in a power that annuls guilt: we immoralists prefer not to believe in "guilt." We hold instead that every action is of identical value at root--and that actions that turn against us may, economically considered, be nonetheless useful, generally desirable actions.

In any particular case we will allow that an act could easily have been spared us—but circumstances favored it. Which of us, if favored by circumstance, would not have gone through the entire gamut of crime?

One should never say on that account: "You should not have done this or that," but always: "How strange that I should not have done that a hundred times before!"

After all, very few actions are typical actions and real epit omes of a personality; and considering how little personality most men have, a man is seldom characterized by a single action, Acts of circumstance, merely epidermal, merely reflexes that respond to a stimulus: long before the depths of our being are touched by it, consulted about it. A rage, a reach, a knife thrust: what of per sonality is in that?45

A deed often brings with it a numbness and lack of freedom: so that the doer is as if spellbound at its recollection and feels as if he were an accessory of it. This spiritual disorder, a form of hypnotism, must be resisted at all cost: a single deed, whatever it may be, is, in comparison with everything one has done, a zero, and may be deducted without falsifying the account. The iniquitous interest that society may have in treating our entire existence from a single point of view, as if its meaning lay in bringing forth one single deed, should not infect the doer himself; unfortunately this

* Cf. Camus, The Stranger.

(p137)

happens almost all the time. That stems from the fact that a spiritual disturbance follows every deed with unusual consequences, whether these consequences are good or ill. Observe a lover who has received a promise, or a poet applauded by an audience: so far as torpor intellectualis is concerned, they differ in no way from an anarchist confronted with a search warrant.

There are actions which are unworthy of us: actions that, if regarded as typical, would reduce us to a lower class of man. Here one has only to avoid the error of regarding them as typical. There are other kinds of actions of which we are unworthy: exceptions born of a particular abundance of happiness and health, our high est floodtide driven so high for once by a storm, an accident: such actions and "works" are likewise not typical. One should never measure an artist by the standard of his works.

236 (Jan.-Fall 1888)

a. In proportion as Christianity still seems necessary today, man is still savage and fateful

b. From another point of view it is not necessary, but extremely harmful, although enticing and seductive because it cor responds to the morbid character of whole classes, whole types of contemporary. humanity-decadents of all kinds, they follow their inclinations when they aspire to Christianity

One must distinguish clearly between a. and b. In case a. Christianity is a cure, at least a means of taming ( under certain circumstances it serves to make sick; which can be useful in break ing savagery and brutality). In case b. it is itself a symptom of sickness, propagates decadence; here it works against a corroborat ing system of treatment, here it is the invalid's instinct against that which is good for him

237 (Jan.-Fall 1888)

The party of the serious, dignified, reflective: and opposed to them the savage, unclean, incalculable beast- merely a prob lem of animal taming--in which the animal tamer must be hard, fearsome and terror-inspiring toward his beasts.

All essential demands must be made with a brutal clarity, i.e., exaggerated a thousandfold:



(p138)





even the fulfilment of the demand must be represented in a coarsened way, so it may inspire awe, e.g., emancipation from the senses on the part of the Brahmins.

The struggle with the canaille and the cattle. If a certain tam ing and order is to be achieved, the chasm between these purified and reborn people and the remainder must be made as fearful as possible

This chasm increases in the higher castes their self-regard, their faith in that which they represent—hence the chandala. Con tempt and an excess of it is perfectly correct psychologically, that is to say, exaggerated a hundredfold, so that it may at least be copied. 48

238 (Jan-Fall 1888)

The struggle against the brutal instincts is different from the struggle against the sick instincts; to make sick may even be a means of mastering brutality. Christian psychological practice often leads to the conversion of a brute into a sick and consequently tame animal.

The struggle against brutal and savage natures must be a struggle using means that affect them: superstitions are indispensa ble and essential-47

239 (Nov, 1887-March 1888)

Our age is in a certain sense ripe (that is to say, decadent), as the age of Buddha was. Therefore a Christianity is possible, but without the absurd dogmas (the most repellent abortions of

antique hybridism).

240 (1885-1886)

Even granted that the Christian faith might not be disprova ble, Pascal thinks, nonetheless, that, in view of a fearful possibility that it is true, it is in the highest degree prudent to be a Christian.

The humor of European culture: one holds this to be true but does that. E.g., what is the point of the arts of reading and criti cism as long as the ecclesiastical interpretation of the Bible, Protes tant as well as Catholic, is cultivated as ever?

242 (Nov. 1887-March 1888)

One does not consider closely enough how barbarous the concepts are by which we Europeans still live. That men have been capable of believing that "salvation of the soul” depended on a book! - And they tell me this is still believed today.

What is the point of scientific education, criticism and herme neutics if such a lunatic exposition of the Bible as is still cultivated by the church has not yet turned the blush of shame into a perma Dent skin color?

243 (Spring-Fall 1887; rey. Spring-Fall 1888)

To consider: to what extent the fateful belief in divine provi dence—the most paralyzing belief for hand and reason there has



(p140)



 ever been still exists; to what extent Christian presuppositions and interpretations still live on under the formulas nature," "progress," "perfectibility," "Darwinism," under the superstitious belief in a certain relationship between happiness and virtue, unhappiness and guilt. That absurd trust in the course of things, in life," in the "instinct of life," that comfortable resignation that comes from the faith that if everyone only does his duty all will be well—this kind of thing is meaningful only by supposing a direc tion of things sub specie boni. Even fatalism, the form philosophi cal sensibility assumes with us today, is a consequence of this long belief in divine dispensation, an unconscious consequence: as if what happens were no responsbility of ours (-as though it were permissible to let things take their course: every individual self only a mode of absolute reality ).

244 (Nov. 1887-March 1888) It is the height of psychological mendaciousness in man to frame according to his own petty standard of what seems good, wise, powerful, valuable, a being that is an origin and "in-itself" -- and therewith to abolish in his mind the entire causal process by means of which any kind of goodness, any kind of wisdom, any kind of power exists and possesses value. In short, to posit elements of the most recent and contingent origin as not created but "in-themselves" and perhaps even as the cause of creation in general

Judging from experience, from every instance in which a man has raised himself significantly above the average of humanity, we see that every high degree of power involves freedom from good and evil and from strue" and "false," and cannot take into account the demands of goodness: we see that the same applies to every high degree of wisdom-goodness is abrogated in it as much as veracity, justice, virtue, and other popular fancies in valuation. Finally, every high degree of goodness itself: is it not patent that it presupposes a spiritual myopia and coarseness? in cluding the inability to distinguish at a distance between true and false, between useful and harmful? not to discuss the fact that a high degree of power in the hands of the highest degree of goodness would lead to the most calamitous consequences ("the abolition of evil") ? — In fact, one needs only to see what tendencies the

141

BOOK TWO: Critique of Highest Values "God of love" inspires in his believers: they ruin mankind for the sake of the good.” In practice, the actual constitution of the world has shown this same God to be the God of the extremest shortsightedness, devilry and impotence: which reveals how much value there is in this conception of him.

Knowledge and wisdom in themselves have no value; no more than goodness: one must first be in possession of the goal from which these qualities derive their value or nonvalue-- there could be a goal in the light of which great knowledge might repre sent a great disvalue (if, for instance, a high degree of deception were one of the prerequisites of the enhancement of life; likewise if goodness were perhaps able to paralyze and discourage the springs of the great longing) -

Taking our human life as it is, all "truth," all "goodness," all "holiness," all divinity" in the Christian style has up to now shown itself to be highly dangerous even now mankind is in danger of perishing through an idealism inimical of life.48

245 (Spring-Fall 1887)

Consider the damage all human institutions sustain if a divine and transcendent higher sphere is postulated that must first sanction these institutions. By then growing accustomed to seeing their value in this sanction (e.g., in the case of marriage), one has reduced their natural dignity; in certain circumstances denied it Nature has been ill-judged to the extent to which one has brought into honor the antinaturalness of a God. "Natural" has come to mean the same as "contemptible," "bad"

The fatefulness of a belief in God as the reality of the highest moral qualities: all actual values were therewith denied and sys tematically conceived as non-values. Thus antinaturalness as sumed the throne. With relentless logic one arrived at the absolute demand to deny nature.

246 (Jan-Fall 1888)

In moving the doctrine of selflessness and love into the fore ground, Christianity was in no way establishing the interests of

(p142)





the species, as of higher value than the interests of the individual. Its real historical effect, the fateful element in its effect, remains, on the contrary, in precisely the enhancement of egoism, of the egoism of the individual, to an extreme to the extreme of in dividual immortality). Through Christianity, the individual was made so important, so absolute, that he could no longer be sac rificed: but the species endures only through human sacrifice All "souls" became equal before God: but this is precisely the most dangerous of all possible evaluations! If one regards indi viduals as equal, one calls the species into question, one encourages a way of life that leads to the ruin of the species: Christianity is the counterprinciple to the principle of selection. If the degenerate and sick ("the Christian") is to be accorded the same value as the healthy ("the pagan"), or even more value, as in Pascal's judgment concerning sickness and health, then unnaturalness becomes law

This universal love of men is in practice the preference for the suffering, underprivileged, degenerate: it has in fact lowered and weakened the strength, the responsibility, the lofty duty to sacrifice men. All that remains, according to the Christian scheme of values, is to sacrifice oneself: but this residue of human sacrifice that Christianity.concedes, and even advises has, from the stand point of general breeding, no meaning at all. The prosperity of the species is unaffected by the self-sacrifice of this or that individual (whether it be in the monkish and ascetic manner or, with the aid of crosses, pyres, and scaffolds, as "martyrs”. of error). The species requires that the ill-constituted, weak, degenerate, perish: but it was precisely to them that Christianity turned as a conserving force; it further enhanced that instinct in the weak, already so powerful, to take care of and preserve themselves and to sustain one another. What is "virtue" and "charity" in Chris tianity if not just this mutual preservation, this solidarity of the weak, this hampering of selection? What is Christian altruism if not the mass-egoism of the weak, which divines that if all care for one another each individual will be preserved as long as possible?

If one does not feel such a disposition as an extreme im morality, as a crime against life, one belongs with the company of the sick and possesses its instincts oneself

Genuine charity demands sacrifice for the good of the species - it is hard, it is full of self-overcoming, because it needs human sacrifice. And this pseudo humaneness called Christianity wants it established that no one should be sacrificed

(p143)

247 (March-June 1888)

Nothing would be more useful or more to be encouraged than a thoroughgoing practical nihilism. As I understand all the phenomena of Christianity and pessimism, they say: "We are ripe for nonexistence; for us it is reasonable not to exist." This language of "reason" is also, in this case, the language of selective nature.

What, on the other hand, is to be condemned in the sternest terms is the ambiguous and cowardly compromise of a religion such as Christianity: more precisely, such as the church: which, instead of encouraging death and self-destruction, protects every thing ill-constituted and sick and makes it propagate itself

Problem: with what means could one attain to a severe form of really contagious nihilism: such as teaches and practices volun tary death with scientific conscientiousness ( and not a feeble, vegetable existence in expectation of a false afterlife--)?

One cannot sufficiently condemn Christianity for having de valuated the value of such a great purifying nihilistic movement, which was perhaps already being formed, through the idea of the immortal private person: likewise through the hope of resurrec tion: in short, through continual deterrence from the deed of nihilism, which is suicide

It substituted slow suicide: gradually a petty, poor, but durable life; gradually a quite ordinary, bourgeois, mediocre life,

etc.

248 (March-June 1888)

Christian moral quackery.- Pity and contempt succeed one another in quick alternation, and occasionally I get enraged, as at the sight of some mean crime. Here error is made a duty-a virtue; blundering is made into an art, the instinct for destruction systematized as "redemption"; here every operation becomes an injury, an amputation even of those organs whose energy is a precondition of any return to health. And the most that is achieved is never healing, but only the substitution of one set of evil symp toms for another

And this dangerous nonsense, this systematized disfiguring and castration of life, is counted holy, inviolable; to live in its service, to be an instrument of this healing art, to be a priest,



(p144)





makes one distinguished, venerable, makes one holy and even inviolable. Only divinity can be the author of this highest healing art; only as revelation can redemption be understood, as an art of grace, as the most undeserved gift granted to the creature.

First proposition: health of soul is regarded as sickness, as suspicious

Second proposition: the prerequisites of a strong and flourish ing life, strong desires and passions, count as objections to a strong and flourishing life.

Third proposition: all that threatens man with danger, all that might master and destroy him, is evil, is reprehensible--is to be torn from his soul by its roots.

Fourth proposition: man made harmless to himself and others, weak, prostrated in humility and modesty, conscious of his weak ness, the "sinner"- this is the most desirable type, and one that can also be produced with a little surgery to the soul

249 (Spring-Fall 1887)

What is it I protest against? That one should take this petty, peaceable mediocrity, this equilibrium of a soul that knows noth ing of the mighty motivation of great accumulations of strength, for something exalted, possibly even for the measure of man.

Bacon of Verulam says: Infimarum virtutum apud vulgus laus est, mediarum admiratio, supremarum sensus nullus. 49 Chris tianity, however, belongs, as a religion, to the vulgus: it has no feeling for the highest species of virtus.

250 (Spring-Fall 1887) Let us see what "the true Christian" does with all that which his instinct opposes:-he sullies and suspects the beautiful, the splendid, the rich, the proud, the self-reliant, the knowledgeable, the powerful in summa, the whole of culture: his object is to deprive it of a good conscience

251 (Jan.-Fall 1888)

Hitherto one has always attacked Christianity not merely in

The ordinary ruck has praise for the lowest virtues, admiration for the mediocre, and for the highest virtues no sense at all.

(p145) a modest way but in the wrong way. As long as one has not felt Christian morality to be a capital crime against life its defenders have had it all their own way. The question of the mere "truth" of Christianity-whether in regard to the existence of its God or the historicity of the legend of its origin, not to speak of Christian astronomy and natural science is a matter of secondary im portance as long as the question of the value of Christian morality is not considered. Is Christian morality worth anything, or is it a shame and digrace despite all the holiness of its arts of seduction? The problem of truth can slip away into hiding places of all kinds; and the greatest believers may finally avail themselves of the logic of the greatest unbelievers to create for themselves a right to affirm certain things as irrefutable-namely, as beyond the means of all refutation (this artifice is today called "Kantian Criticism").

252 (Nov: 1887-March 1888)

One should never forgive Christianity for having destroyed such men as Pascal. One should never cease from combating just this in Christianity: its will to break precisely the strongest and noblest souls. One should never rest as long as this one thing has not been utterly and completely destroyed: the ideal of man invented by Christianity, its demands upon men, its Yes and its No with regard to men. The whole absurd residue of Christian fable, conceptual cobweb-spinning and theology does not concern us; it could be a thousand times more absurd and we would not lift a finger against it. But we do combat the ideal that, with its morbid beauty and feminine seductiveness, with its furtive slander ous eloquence appeals to all the cowardices and vanities of wearied souls--and the strongest have their weary hours as if all that might, in such states, seem most useful and desirable trust, guilelessness, modesty, patience, love of one's fellows, resig nation, submission to God, a sort of unharnessing and abdication of one's whole ego-were also the most useful and desirable as such; as if the petty, modest abortion of a soul, the virtuous aver age-and-herd man, did not only take precedence over the stronger, more evil, covetous, defiant, prodigal, and therefore a hundred times more imperiled kind of man, but provided nothing less than the ideal, the goal, the measure, the highest desideratum for man kind in general. To erect this ideal was the most sinister tempta tion ever placed before mankind; for with it, the more strongly

.

(p146)





constituted exceptions and fortunate cases among men, in whom the will to power and to the growth of the whole type "man" took a step forward, were threatened with destruction; with the values of this ideal, the growth of these higher men, who for the sake of their superior claims and tasks also freely accept a life more full of peril (expressed economically: a rise in the cost of the undertaking in proportion to the decline in the probability of its success) would be attacked at the roots. What is it we combat in Christianity? That it wants to break the strong, that it wants to discourage their courage, exploit their bad hours and their oc casional weariness, convert their proud assurance into unease and distress of conscience, that it knows how to poison and sicken the noble instincts until their strength, their will to power turns backward, against itself-until the strong perish through orgies of self-contempt and self-abuse: that gruesome way of perishing of which Pascal provides the most famous example.
