## Satem for 100
- Avestan satem, Persian sad, Sanskrit śatam, сто / sto in all modern Slavic languages, Old Church Slavonic sъto, Latvian simts, Lithuanian šimtas
- Slavic prefix sъ(n)- ("with")
- Tocharian B kante is a special, doubtful case.

## Ancestry
During the Bronze Age, Corded Ware people with admixture from Central Europe remigrated onto the steppe, forming a type of WSH ancestry often referred to as Steppe Middle and Late Bronze Age (Steppe MLBA) ancestry. Through the Sintashta culture, Andronovo culture and Srubnaya culture, Steppe MLBA was carried into Central Asia and South Asia along with Indo-Iranian languages, leaving a long-lasting cultural and genetic legacy.

## Central asia
- Earlier Tocharian wave considered separately.
- "However, a second wave of Indo-Europeans, the Indo-Iranians, started advancing east perhaps starting around 4100 YBP. They appear to have conquered the Kazakh steppes by around 4000 YBP& sometime in the following 500 years invaded India: Aryan invasion."
