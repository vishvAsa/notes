> The great father in Africa belonged to the the E1b-M180 clade. His descendants in thre1e great spurts from around 5300-4800 YBP expanded among the speakers of Niger-Congo languages and spread across the vast African continent. .. It is likely that the E1b-M180 lineage arose there and then penetrated deep into sub-Saharan Africa as the Niger-Congo languages diversified. Its initial expansions could have been triggered by the events of the emergence of civilization in the Egyptian cultural zone, with its bearers subsequently acquiring high status in the sub-Saharan milieu east and west.
