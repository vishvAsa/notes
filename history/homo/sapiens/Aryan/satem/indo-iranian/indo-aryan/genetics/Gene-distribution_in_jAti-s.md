Gene-distribution in jAti-s


- ANI ancestry among various castes: [RK15](http://www.unz.com/gnxp/the-aryan-invasion-was-not-fantasy/#comments).
- Caste-gene heatmap \[[MT5](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2005/12/20/socio-genetic-stratification-of-india/)\].

- "Not shown in this diagram is the O3e marker that is predominantly seen in the Tibeto-Burman speaking eastern tribals (who also have some O2a), and nearly absent elsewhere."\[[MT5](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2005/12/20/socio-genetic-stratification-of-india/)\]
- "The O2a, H1, F* and H2 haplogroups are predominantly seen in the mainland tribal population and decline in the middle-lower castes and are low or almost absent in upper castes." \[[MT5](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2005/12/20/socio-genetic-stratification-of-india/)\]


## Summaries
> the steppe ancestry is ~20-30% in pakistan/punjab. 30% in brahmins in north india. 20% in brahmins in south india. in gangetic plain goes from 20 to 10% in peasants as u go west to east (10% in bengal). in south india it's like 5% among non-brahmins. ~0% in dalits in the south and some tribals. in north india lower than 10% in dalits like chamars. it correlates with skin color, but imperfect, since skin color is due to only a few genes and sample variance is higher.
>
> the high genetic diversity is because indian people are a mix of VERY DIFFERENT population groups, one related to those of europe and west asia, and one distantly related to the people of eastern eurasia and australia. these lineages were separated for ~50,000 years before mixing 5,000 years ago
