## Swat
AASI ancestry in NW India increases after Aryan entry. So migration was happening from SE to NW India. Arya-s connected and revitalized the Indian subcontinent.

> In the Swat valley samples, which date initially to ~1000 BCE, the authors noticed over time the proportion of Iranian-farmer-related ancestry decreased over time to give way to steppe and Andamese-related ancestry.

> increase of AHG and steppe in Swat is probably due to the Indo-Aryanization of the region after 1000 BCE. That process occurred partly through migration, and these cosmopolitan migrants naturally had more steppe and AHG.
