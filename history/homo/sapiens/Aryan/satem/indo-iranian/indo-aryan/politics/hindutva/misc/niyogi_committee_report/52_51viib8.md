*Oral Statement made before the Christian Missionary Activities Enquiry
Committee.*

MANDLA  
(15-8-55)

**No. 1**

*Father’s name*-Seth Bhaddelai.  
*Occupation*-Lawyer.  
*Residence*-Mandla.

I have sent my reply to the Committee’s questionnaire, and my honest
views are expressed therein.  The litigants of Salhedanda village of
Mandla tahsil by name Luta and Hazari were coerced by one Padri byname
Anthony Thudiyhill (Roman Catholic) to effect a compromise of their case
on pain of dire consequences.  Being afraid, they effected a
compromise.  This matter went to the Civil Court and one of the findings
of the Court is that the compromise was not voluntary but a result of
undue pressure by the Padri.  The motives, as I understand, must be to
show his influence and superiority in that village with a view to
convert people to Roman Catholic faith.  Other persons of Salhedanda
have made complaints to the Deputy Commissioner through the District
Congress Committee, Mandla, about undue pressure of this Church, It is
not merely my information but also my personal knowledge that loans were
advanced by the Roman Catholic Missionaries with a view to convert
people to Christianity.  There is another Mission also working in the
Mandla district.  It is now called Gondwana Mission but no instances of
objectionable methods have come to my notice with regard to their
working.  I file a statement today.  In this I have suggested remedies
to protect an aboriginal in his ancestral faith.  On the analogy of the
Land Acquisition Act I say that the permission of the Deputy
Commissioner should be necessary for an aboriginal leaving his ancestral
faith, but not so when he comes back to his ancestral faith.  In a
backward tract like Mandla district, in my opinion, officers of high
character and efficiency should be posted.  At present the general
opinion is that those who are sent here are sent by way of some sort of
punishment for their not very efficient work elsewhere.  In fact the
process should be reversed.  Men of proved efficiency and character
should be posted here as backward people need more sympathy and more
looking after their interests than those in the advanced areas.  My
written reply to question No. 42 of the questionnaire is based on my
belief that conversion not only to Roman Catholic faith but also to any
denomination of Christianity would lessen an aboriginal’s affiliation as
an Indian though I grant that this cannot be said of highly placed and
intelligent men and women.

Our main work is Evangelistic but so far we have no converts.  Our main
work is in the backward tracts, amongst the aboriginals in the Mandla
district.  Our annual expenditure is about Rs. 7 to 8 thousand.  We get
this money from the Bishop of Nagpur.  We have 3 school teachers, 2 of
them do pastoral work also.  We have no pracharaks in addition to
these.  They are also not regular pracharaks.  Our total number in
Mandla district would be about 400.  The main field of work in Mandla
district is of Roman Catholics and their number is much larger than
ours.  I cannot say how much.  It is the lack of funds that is coming in
the way of our evangelistic work in the Mandla district.  Had we the
funds, we would have done as we did 20 years ago.  I have also heard
complaints of the type regarding advance and loans by the Roman
Catholics stated by the previous witness but it may be just to help a
poor man in his needs.  The other aspect also can be there, that this
loan may work as an inducement to conversion.  Our Mission, therefore,
had never adopted this method and would not adopt this method even if we
have money. On our part I should not fail to bring to the Committee’s
notice that the Roman Catholics reached the places wherever Government
help could not be available and the Roman Catholic have helped in such
places.  That fact also must have attracted the persons residing in
those distant parts of the jungle area, towards the (Roman Catholics)
religion.  Our Government is looking more and more onwards the welfare
of the tribal area in matters of education, financial help and, general
uplift.  This is welcomed by the people of those areas. It is also
welcome to me. About the Roman.  Catholics, I cannot say.

*To Mr. S. P. Verma-*

There is a small dispensary belonging to the Mission at Patpara.  These
four persons have come from Travancore, three ladies and one gentleman. 
Besides doing their hospital work the two who are attached to the
hospital do preaching work also.  The other two are learning the local
language.  In fact all four are learning the local language in order to
prepare themselves for work in this locality.  They are not paid by our
mission.  They are paid by Travancore mission although they are under
the Nagpur diocese.

*To Shri S. B. Shukla, counsel for non-Christians-*

I cannot say what has been the increase or decrease in the number of
Christians here for the last 3 or 4 years. This information can be given
by the Bishop of Nagpur.  We keep no record of the work done by our
workers.

*Residence*-Patpara.

Formerly Patpara was a Mission station of the Gondwana Mission.  We have
taken over Patpara, and the near about villages from that Mission.  It
is now an independent Mission and not a part of the Gondwana Mission. 
Our funds come from Travancore Mission.  I, my wife and two other ladies
came here on an invitation of the Nagpur Diocese.  Our annual budget is
about Rs. 3,000.  The amount comes from Travancore.  Our sphere of work
is confined to 7 or 8 village’s roundabout Patpara.  Our main work is
evangelistic.  There are in all 49 Christians in our area and the rest
are mostly Gonds.  We came in last October.  But Christian Missions have
been working in the area since about 70 years.  We do preaching work,
and sometimes visit houses.  We run school and some medical aid is
given, as there is no medical aid available nearabout. Patpara is 7
miles from Mandla and important medical cases are referred to Mandla
Hospital.  Some 3 or 4 people came to me individually and told me that
they wanted to he Christians.  I then questioned why they wanted to be
Christians, and I was not satisfied of their worthiness.  Therefore I
did not convert them.  The Gondwana Mission has made available to us all
their establishment and work.

*To Shri S. B. Shukul.-* Whenever we go for preaching, we go in numbers,
varying from 3 to 12.  Generally we collect a large number of people. 
We preach in substance that through Jesus Christ alone people can get
salvation.  We never say about their religion.  We tell them about our
life and experience and about their faith.  We sing Christian songs and
show magic lantern slides.  There are no records of conversion for the
last 10 years.  I asked people who had come to me to become Christian
whether they had come for financial help or to get a woman in marriage,
as I had heard that people are actuated by such motives to become
Christians.  That has been within my experience also that people come to
become Christian with that expectation.  There are people of our
confidence in every village who are not Christians and they invite us
for preaching, medical help and other works.

Some 2 or 3 years ago I had been to Junwani where my son was reading in
the Mission School.  Father of the Church, whose name I don’t know, is
called Bade Swami.  He gave me several tracts asking me that I should
distribute them amongst the villagers and take the villagers every
Sunday to the Church.  I took the pamphlets and distributed them and
also asked the villagers to go to the Church.  I am kotwar of two
villages.  In fact I had taken some Baigas of Lakhanpur to the Church on
Sundays, nut they did not continue to go as they said they did not like
that.  Then Bada Father asked me why I was not trying to take the people
to the church.  I told the Bada Father that I was a Government Kotwar. 
I could not do more than I was doing.  I could not help when the people
did not go to the Church.  This he did not like and became displeased
with me.  One day I went to Junwani again.  I was standing in the
courtyard of Amritdas master, hearing two other masters’ quarrel.  As I
was standing, Bade Father came from behind and when I heard his steps I
legged behind but he became wild and he gave me good beating saying that
I was not doing his work and was not taking the people to Church.  The
father followed me but I anyhow escaped.  I reported the matter in Mawai
P. S. next day.  The next day the Bada father came to my house and
entered it.  He threatened that unless I continued to send my son to his
school, I would be turned out. I was afraid of not sending my son to his
school.  Then I began sending my son to school and nothing happened to
him.  Some 15 days back they have turned out my son from the School and
I suspect that the reason is that I have come here to depose facts.  I
had given written statement to the Committee when it visited Dindori
last time I gave a statement (Bayan) in writing dated the 10th December
1954.  A copy of it was given to the Committee by Shri Nilkanth Sharma
along with his answer to the questionnaire. (The original is shown to
the witness and he admits his signature.

My village is a mile and half from Salhedanda and about 10 miles from
Katra, where there is a Roman Catholic Church and a Padri.  The Padree
used to give me two bottles of kerosene oil and Rs. 13 per month so that
I might learn Christian religion and induce others to become Christian. 
He used to tell us that it is no use worshipping our Gods and
Goddesses.  He also used to say that we should not say “Ram Ram”, when
wishing each other bus should say “Jai Issu”.  For some time I did his
work and tried to learn his literature.  But after some time I began to
realise that I was loosing my caste and would be excommunicated by my
caste fellows.  Therefore, I became cold in this matter.  Then the Padri
Sahib discontinued paying money and two bottles of kerosene oil. 
Salhedanda and Surajpura are on the other side of river Narmada and are
Jangli tract.  Katra is near Mandla.  Year before last Chhota Padri
Saheb of Katra told me that I was their old worker and should work for
them, myself become a Christian and make others Christians and then I
would get my old remuneration of Rs. 13 and two bottles of kerosene oil
as before.  I know that there are five houses of Catholic Christians and
about 50 houses of Gonds in Salhedanda.  The Catholic houses were
formerly of Gonds.  They have converted to Christianity about two or
three years ago.  The Gonds told the Christian converted that they would
not allow them to touch their food and not have such other connection
with them.  On this there was some quarrel between the two parties.  The
Catholic insisted that they did not cease to be Gonds because they
adopted Christianity and they had every right to take food, etc., in
their caste pangats.  The matter was reported and on Government
officials' intervening and telling them that the Christians should not
interfere with the Gonds and the Gonds with Christians, the matter is
now at rest.  There is a dispute between one Luta and Hazari.  Both are
Gonds and non-Christians.  The Padri Saheb of Katra is siding Hazari in
that quarrel. I cannot definitely give reason of the quarrel but I gasp
that one Ajansingh is Christian and his mother and Hazari’s wife are
sisters.  That may be the reason for this sidetaking of the Christian
Mission.

I have replied to the Committee’s questionnaire. I have several
occasions to go into the interior in connection with my business, and
also in connection with Ramayan function.  I have recorded in writing my
experience, which I am handing over to the Committee.  Nandu, son of
Lingu Baiga of village Bijoara informed me when I had been to his
village that Foreign Missionaries forcibly took away his sacred Trishul
and Sath Kathwa talking very disparagingly about them and took them into
Church and sprinkled water on them saying that these are nothing and
Jesus Christ is our Saviour.  He also gave me in writing copy of the
application.  This has been sent to the Committee and I give the
original for your perusal.  I was also informed by an old man, who is
locally called Gandhi, and a few others with him that the Christian
Missionary there (in order to convert people) played the following
trick.  He brought two idols one of Jesus Christ and the other of Ram or
Krishna.  He told the audience that these were the two idols one their
God and other his God.  He would try which one is purer.  The pure one
would come out of the dirty water if both are placed in it.  Then a
bucket of water was brought and some dust thrown into it.  The idol of
Jesus and the idol of Ram were then placed under the water taking care
that the idol of Jesus should be under the idol of Ram.  Then they were
asked to call out their Gods to swim over the dirty water.  The Hindu
idol did not come up and then it was his (the Christian’s) turn to call
his God and then he gave a shake to the pot and the idol of Jesus swam
over the water as that was made of wood and that of Ram or Krishna was
made of metal.  In this way the ignorant and backward people are
deceived into believing that there is truth in what the Missionary
says.  These tricks are played in the open bazar.  I am willing to
produce my two informants.  In fact they would have come to day, but due
to heavy rains, they were held-up. I shall willingly produce them in
Nagpur or if the Committee comes in open season, then I will produce
them here.

Ratnu son of Lingu Baiga told me that one foreign Padri beat him as he
thought he was interfering with his work of conversion.  Ratnu has given
his written statement to the Committee and I produce the original here
for the Committee’s perusal.  Village Bijora is far in the interior and
difficult to approach.  I asked Ratnu why he did not report to the
police.  He said that it was difficult for him to go alone.  He could
not find a companion as they were afraid of pressure from Missionaries. 
Bhangi, son of Dasru Baiga was also beaten by the Missionaries.  He had
made a report.  His writing is also with me and a copy is given to the
Committee.  Asru, son of Baisakhu Baiga informed me that the foreign
Padri entered his house, drove away his children and wife, and locked it
because he thought that Asru was not going to the Church and not taking
others to the Church although he was a Mukhia.  He has given a report in
writing.  The original is shown, and a copy given to the Committee. 
Bhagutsing has also given in writing the original shown and a copy has
been handed over to the Committee.  Ishwardas Kotwar, who was examined
yesterday, has also given his report in writing to me.  The original is
shown and a copy is given to the Committee. Lamu Gond and Chhatarsingh
have also given their versions in writing.  The original is shown. 
Copies of this have already been supplied to the Committee.  These are
instances of how the Roman Catholic Missionaries in Mandla are
terrorising the people in the backward tracts.  These are not isolated
cases but instances of what they do and of which I have heard various
reports.  Lately their behaviour like this has no doubt lessened.  But
it may be revived again.

Loans were advanced by the Roman Catholic Mission with a view to
conversion.  Small amounts ranging from Rs. 2 to Rs. 10 are given to
ignorant and simple people so that they may be tempted to become
Christian and if they do not become Christian, heavy interest is
realised.  Roman Catholic Mission was constructing a school in
Salhedanda in the year 1953-54.  Salhedanda and Surajpura people did not
give Begar to the Missionary.  The Missionary Padri, therefore, beat the
people of Salhedanda and Surajpura.  Some of the people of those
villages reported the matter to the Congress Committee and also to the
police.  Ramsukh Pande, a head constable, went to make enquiries and it
is believed he reported against, the missionary.  Seeing this, Shri H.
Ross, Deputy Superintendent of Police, Mandla, transferred Ramsukh Pande
to Bajag, an interior thana of this district, where generally people are
sent by way of punishment.  Ramsukh Pande represented his case to his
officers and all the papers are in the District Superintendent of
Police's office, as I believe. I went to the District Superintendent of
Police's office in order to find out if I could get copies of the above
said papers.  There I was informed that it was not possible for me to do
so, but I think if the Committee writes to them they may supply copies
of the proceeding to the Committee.  Kunwardas’s daughter was reading in
the Mission School, Sijhora.  Kunwardas settled her marriage in his own
caste.  He is the waterman of that school and when he went there Rev.
Lamers, who is a padri, and also in-charge of the institution, beat
Kunwardas saying that his daughter should have been married to a
Christian and not to a non-Christian as she has studied in the Christian
school.  Kunwardas reported the matter to the police and when Rev.
Lamers came to know this, he gathered a sort of panchayat in the village
and offered apology to Kunwardas.  But Kunwardas has been removed from
service.

Panchhabai aged about 13 or 14 years, daughter of Radhelal Pathad of the
village Kisli was taken away by a Christian boy, son of a teacher of
Narharganj.  I do not know his name but the young man was a
forest-guard.  She was turned Christian and married.  The matter was
reported to the police and a Criminal case was started but what happened
of the Criminal case I do not know.  This occurrence had taken place in
the month of August 1950.  The report to the District Magistrate was
made on 26th August 1950.

I give another instance of how the people are converted to
Christianity.  There is a custom among the hilly tract people and among
the tribal that they do not take water from other caste people.  The
Christian pracharaks pretending to distribute medicines, give medicine
in liquid form and after sometime the pracharak tells the caste people
that man is worthy of ousting from their caste because he had drunk
water from the hands of Christians.  The caste people then outcaste him
and the men has to suffer heavy compensation (Jat Dand) in the form of
feast, liquor, etc.  Ultimately the man becomes nervous and gets
converted to Christianity.  These are done by the agents of the
missionaries, who make propaganda in the caste people that the person
has become a Christian by his taking medicine containing water from
Christians.

The evidence of one Chhiddi who deposed about Missionary activity of
taking sides in litigation with a view to conversion is a typical
instance of what a missionary does.  There are various ways and many
methods of inducing people to become Christian, too numerous to mention
in such a short time.  But I am giving some more illustrations as
follows:-

> \(1\) Christians do not allow their wells to be used by non-Christians
> when real need of water arises unless they become Christian.  This has
> happened in Bijora village.
>
> \(2\) Love affairs-An instance of this has already come to the
> Committee’s notice yesterday.
>
> \(3\) Petty employment and monthly salary-This has also come to the
> Committee’s notice yesterday.
>
> \(4\) Giving material help to the guardians of children and to
> children who read in the mission school.
>
> \(5\) Changing name of a student in the attendance roll in the mission
> school.
>
> \(6\) When boy with Hindu name passes an examination or leaves a
> Mission school and wants a transfer certificates, then his name is
> given as a Christian.

I am giving a few instances for your perusal.  One Nanhudas Panka of
mission school of Parsel Daori near Bonder was given a Christian name
when he wanted a certificate.  His father’s name was mentioned as
Christian, viz.  “Dr. Rembo”.  I file a written statement.

I am Arya Samaj Updeshak.  I have travelled in Mandla district in
connection with my preaching work. I have gone alone and also with Shri
Suraj Prasad Verma. I beard the statement made by Shri Suraj Pd. Verma
and endorse the same. I also file my written statement. I had replied to
the questionnaire sent by the committee and along with my reply I had
sent copies of various statements made by several persons.  The
originals of these were shown to the Committee by Shri S. P. Verma.

I am a member of the Dindori Janpad Sabha.  The villages of Junwani
Mohania, Deoridadar, Andhiar Khon and Mohwari all situated, in Mawai
than of Mandla district, were originally inhabited by Gonds.  But for
the last 10 or 15 years they are being converted to Christianity.  The
methods of conversion are monetory help, inducement, Terrorising people
and others, of which I give a list in my note, which I have written and
is under my signature.  Now the Christian population has increased very
much and still continues to increase.  My village Murta is about 4 or 5
miles from Junwani.  In my village also, the mukaddam’s son has been
turned into Christianity last year while he was a student in their
school.  They get hold of the Mukhia so that they may be able to use him
to convert others.  These are all very jangli tracts where pacca roads
are very distant.  They (these Christians) are of R. C. Mission.  My
mother was treated when she was old. but she did not recover by the
treatment of the Missionary there.  So she was brought to Mandla and
recovered her health.  In the other village mentioned above, 100 persons
may have become Christian in the course of the last year. There are 5 or
6 Churches (Kachcha) in the villages situated at a distance of about 5
miles from each other.  We do not have eating and drinking connection
with those who have become out of caste.  We don’t take back to our
caste a married couple who become Christian.  We can take back the males
but not the females and even for males the charges of taking back in our
castes come to about Rs. 100 per head as expenses for caste feast.

*Residence*.-Mandla.

I am advocate at Mandla. I am old worker in Mandla district and was also
a member of the Provincial Council. I belong, to no political or
communal organisation.  For some time, I was a member of the A. I. C. C.
People claim that I am one of the oldest public worker in Mandla, I had
many occasions to go into the interior.  I am LL.M. and M. A. Before I
came to Mandla, I was a professor in the Morris College, Nagpur and at
Jabalpur also.

I have been in Mandla since the year 193J. I used to go for teaching in
the Law College from Mandla. I have some knowledge of happenings in
Mandla district, and the methods which the Missionaries employ to
convert people to Christianity, particularly in the backward and village
tracts in Mandla district.  They are objectionable.  They convert people
by giving them inducements like money, loans, taking sides in
litigation, distributing clothes and too many other questionable ways to
be enumerated are resorted to.  I have personally gone and met many of
the converts and known them at first hand.  Their conversion is based
not on conviction or knowledge of Christianity but on things other than
these.  I have studied the Bible and in some cases I found that the new
converts have actually no knowledge of Christian religion.  Conversion
on a large scale did take place after the flood and during the War.  The
methods of the Padris have changed now no doubt, but they have become
what I should call ‘underground’.  They have now their secret agents
getting pay and salary working among the villagers and trying to
persuade them to become Christian.  Except in distant areas in Mandla,
the method of coercion-*cum*-inducement has been changed into secret
agencies doing the work.  Generally they catch hold of some influential
persons of the village, such as mukaddam and his son and the kotwar, and
work through them.  That conversion to Christianity affects, the loyalty
to India is not true in the case of the first generation of new
corners.  In fact they feel for their old religion and are not very
happy over the change.  But of the 2nd and the subsequent generations it
is definite in my mind that their loyalty and affinity to India become
affected.  There are various factors leading to this mentality. For
instance, the attitude of excommunication by the caste fellows, the
teachings of the Missionaries from childhood and many others.  The use
of liquor by the R. C. Missionaries is another great incentive to the
tribal people in the jungle to embrace Christianity.  The Christian
Missionaries are encouraging the backward area Gonds in their separatist
tendency to demand a state of their own.  The Missionaries think they
will be profited by this, as the educated Gonds, who may be expected to
be future leaders of the Gonds, would be mostly Christians.  This also
can be said to be a part of the Jharkhand area.  There are a hundred
ways of the Padri to do conversion.  They also act as recruiting agents
for labourers for Assam plantation from where they come back either as
Christians or Christian-minded.
