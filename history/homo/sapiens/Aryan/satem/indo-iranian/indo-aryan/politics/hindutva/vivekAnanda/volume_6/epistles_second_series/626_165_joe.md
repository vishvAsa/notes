THE MATH, BELUR,  
*11th Dec., 1900.*

DEAR JOE,

I arrived night before last. Alas! my hurrying was of no use.

Poor Captain Sevier passed away, a few days ago — thus two great
Englishmen gave up their lives for us — us the Hindus. Thus is martyrdom
if anything is. Mrs. Sevier I have written to just now, to know her
decision.

I am well, things are well here — every way. Excuse this haste. I will
write longer ere long.

Ever yours in truth,  
VIVEKANANDA.
