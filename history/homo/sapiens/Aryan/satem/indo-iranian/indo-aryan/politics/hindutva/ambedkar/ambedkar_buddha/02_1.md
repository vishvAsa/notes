> 1. To Preach or Not to Preach
>
>  1. After having attamed enlightenment and after having formulated
> his way, doubt arose in the mind of the Buddha. Should he go forth and
> preach his doctrine, or should he continue to devote himself to his
> own personal perfection?  
>  2. He said to himself, "True, I have gained a new doctrine. But it
> is too difficult for the common man to accept it and follow it. It is
> too subtle even for the wise.  
>  3. "It is hard for mankind to liberate itself from the
> entanglement of God and Soul. It is hard for mankind to give up its
> belief in rites and ceremonies. It is hard for mankind to give up its
> belief in Karma.  
>  4. "It is hard for mankind to give up its belief in the
> immortality of the Soul, and accept my doctrine that the Soul as an
> independent entity does not exist and does not survive after death.  
>  5. "Mankind is intent on its selfishness, and takes delight and
> pleasure in it. It is hard for mankind to accept my doctrine of
> righteousness overriding selfishness.  
>  6. "If I were to teach my doctrine, and others did not understand
> it; or, understanding it, did not accept; or, accepting it, did not
> follow it, it would be weariness to others and a vexation to me.  
>  7. "Why not remain a sanyasi away from the world, and use my
> gospel to perfect my own self?" he asked himself. "At least I can do
> good to myself."  
>  8. Thus as he reflected, his mind turned to inaction, not to
> teaching of the gospel.  
>  9. Then Brahma Sahampati, knowing what was passing in the mind of
> the Buddha, thought, "Verily the world is being destroyed, verily the
> world is going to destruction, if the Tathagata, the fully
> enlightened, turns to inaction and not to teaching his doctrine."  
>  10. Filled with anxiety, Brahma Sahampati left the Brahma world
> and appeared before the Buddha. And arranging his upper robe on one
> shoulder, he bent down and with clasped hands said, "Thou art no
> longer Siddharth Gautama, Thou art Buddha. Thou art the Blessed One
> who is blessed with the fullest enlightenment. Thou art the
> Tathagatha. How can thou refuse to enlighten the world? How can thou
> refuse to save erring humanity?  
>  11. "There are beings full of impurity that are falling away
> through not hearing the doctrine.  
>  12. "As the Lord knows," proceeded Brahma Sahampati, "Among the
> Magadhas arose in ancient times, doctrine impure, with many blemishes
> devised.  
>  13. "Will not the Lord open for them the door of his immortal
> doctrine?  
>  14. "As one upon a rocky mountain standing beholdeth all the
> people round about him, even thus, O thou, with wisdom distilled,
> ascending all, behold, look down, thou griefless one, upon those
> plunged in their griefs.  
>  15. "Rise up, O hero, victor in battle, O caravan-leader, free
> from the debt of birth, go to the world and \[do\] not turn away from
> it.  
>  16. "May the Lord in his compassion design to teach his gospel to
> men and to gods."  
>  17. "O Brahma, Eminent and Excellent among men, if I did not give
> public utterance to my gospel, it is because I perceived vexation,"
> was the reply of the Buddha.  
>  18. Knowing that there was so much unhappiness in the world, the
> Buddha realised that it was wrong for him to sit as a sanyasi with
> folded arms and allow things to remain as they were.  
>  19. Asceticism he found to be useless. It was vain to attempt to
> escape from the world. There is no escape from the world even for an
> ascetic. He realised that what is necessary is not escape from the
> world. What is necessary is to change the world and to make it
> better.  
>  20. He realised that he left the world because there was so much
> conflict, resulting in misery and unhappiness, and for which he knew
> no remedy. If he can \[=could\] banish misery and unhappiness from the
> world by the propagation of his doctrine, it was his duty to return to
> the world and serve it, and not sit silent as the personification of
> inactive impassivity.  
>  21. The Buddha therefore agreed to the request of Brahma Sahampati
> and decided to preach his doctrine to the world.
>
>   
> § 2. Proclamation of Good News by Brahma Sahampati
>
>  1. Then, Brahma Sahampati, thinking, "I have been instrumental in
> persuading the Buddha to agree to preach his doctrine to the masses,"
> felt extremely happy. He saluted the Buddha, went round him passing to
> the right, took a look, and departed.  
>  2. On his way back he kept on proclaiming to the world, "Rejoice
> at the glad tidings. The Buddha, our Lord, has found the root of all
> evil and unhappiness in the world. He knows the way out.  
>  3. "The Buddha will bring comfort to the weary and sorrow-laden.
> He will give peace to those stricken by war. He will give courage to
> those who are broken in heart. He will give to those who are
> suppressed and oppressed, faith and hope.  
>  4. "Ye that suffer from the tribulations of life, ye that have to
> struggle and endure, ye that yearn for justice, rejoice at the glad
> tidings.  
>  5. "Heal your wounds, ye that are wounded. Eat your fill, ye that
> are hungry. Rest, ye that are weary, and quench your thirst, ye that
> are thirsty. Seek the light, ye that are in darkness. Be of good
> cheer, ye that are forlorn.  
>  6. "In his doctrine there is love to create a longing to own
> \[=acknowledge\] those who are disowned or unowned; to the degraded
> there is the ennoblement ever present to raise them; to the
> disinherited and the downtrodden there is equality blazing forth their
> path to advancement.  
>  7. "His doctrine is the doctrine of righteousness, and his aim is
> to establish the kingdom of righteousness on earth.  
>  8. "His doctrine is the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but
> the truth.  
>  9. "Blessed is the Buddha, for his is the path of reason, and his
> is the way of emancipation from superstition. Blessed is the Buddha
> who teaches the middle way. Blessed is the Buddha who teaches the law
> of righteousness. Blessed is the Buddha who teaches the peace of
> Nibbana. Blessed is the Buddha who preaches love, kindness, and
> fellowship to help fellow beings to obtain salvation."
>
>   
> § 3. Two Types of Conversion
>
>  1. In the Buddha's scheme of things conversion has two meanings.  
>  2. Conversion to the Order of Bhikkus, called Sangh.  
>  3. Secondly, it means conversion of a householder as an Upasaka,
> or lay follower of the Buddha's Dhamma.  
>  4. Except on four points, there is no difference in the way of
> life of the Bhikku and the Upasaka.  
>  5. An Upasaka remains a householder. A Bhikku becomes a homeless
> wanderer.  
>  6. Both the Upasakas and the Bhikkus must observe in their life
> certain rules.  
>  7. Here again to the Bhikku they are vows, the breach of which
> ends in punishment. To the Upasaka they are precepts. They must be
> observed to the best of his ability.  
>  8. An Upasaka can have property. A Bhikku cannot have.  
>  9. To become an Upasaka, there is no ceremony.  
>  10. To become a Bhikku, he must undergo a ceremony called
> Upasampada.  
>  11.The Buddha converted those who came to him according to their
> wish, either as Bhikku or as Upasaka.  
>  12. An Upasaka could become a Bhikku whenever he felt like it.  
>  13. And a Bhikku had to cease to be a Bhikku when he committed a
> breach of the major vows, or whenever he wished to give up his
> membership of the Order.  
>  14. It must not be understood that the Buddha converted only those
> whose names occur in the following pages.  
>  15. The instances are chosen only to show that he did not observe
> any distinction as to caste or sex in admitting persons to his Sangh
> or preaching his Dhamma.
