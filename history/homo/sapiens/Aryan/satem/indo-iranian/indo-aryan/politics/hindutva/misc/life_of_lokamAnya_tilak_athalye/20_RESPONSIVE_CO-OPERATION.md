When Mr. Montague asked Mr. Tilak what he would 
do in case the reforms fell short of his expect- 
ations, Mr. Tilak readily replied "I would accept what is 
given and fight for more."+++(5)+++ Being a strategist and not 
a mere idealist, Mr. Tilak knew full well how to make 
use of the smallest concessions. That is why, when 
the Montague-Chelmsford report was out,he did not run 
into hysterics over it. He never called for its unquali- 
fied rejection. From the very beginning his criticism 
was strong but constructive and he refused to lend the 
weight of his support to that small party in the Congress 
which in July and August, 19 18, talked of a summary 
refusal of the 'little' Mont-ford gift. It was not, there- 
fore, likely, that Mr. Tilak would, in November 1919 
reject those Reforms which nearly two years back he 
had decided to accept for a time. When he returned 
to India in November 1919 after advocating the Congress 
demands before the British Democracy, he had already 
matured in his mind a plan of operations, which he 
thought, would be the shortest cut to Home Rule. 
When in England, Mr. Tilak had been deeply impres

-sed with the completeness with which Sinn Feiners had 
carried the General Election of 19 18. The Sinn Fein- 
ers* refusal to take their seats in the Parliament, their 
efforts to organize a Government of their own, strongly 
appealed to him. Of course, he saw the limitations 
under which they were working and the difference bet- 
ween the conditions in Ireland and those in India. An 
adoption of the peaceful portions of the tactics of the 
Sinn Feiners, in the more favourable circumstances of 
India, with her large size, her distance from England 
and her countless millions, would, he was convinced 
bring greater pressure on our rulers, and compel them, 
in spite of their hesitation and caution, to revise the 
Government of India Act in the shortest time possible. 
Mr. Tilak had no mind to allow things to drift or leave 
them for an uncertain futurity to decide. '* Now and 
here '* the question must be satisfactorily and finally 
solved. No tinkering, no tardy instalments, no humili- 
ating examinations could be tolerated. 
t'j'The immediate task before him, on his return from 
London, was, so to organise public opinion as to give a 
definite verdict on the Government of India Act. 
There was barely one month. He consulted his friends 
and associates in other parts of India. Very little dan- 
ger of opposition was anticipated. The little content- 
ment or rejoicing that existed was to be found only in 
the Moderate circles. The redoubtable Mrs. Besant 
was, of course, expected to put up a strong fight ; but 
she was working hopelessly against the tremendous 
force of the national sentiment and was bound to be 
worsted in the fray. Soon after the passing of the 
Government of India Act, was issued the Royal Procla- 



292 ' • RESPONSIVE CO-OPERATION " 

ndation, so singularly noble in sentiment, so eloquent ii* 
style. It was calculated to rouse the imagination and 
evoke the gratitude of India. No doubt, Mr. Montague 
meant well by India and his appeal had the ring of sin-^ 
cerity. But the days of miracles are gone and Mr. 
Tilak knew full well that the magic wand of the Royal^ 
Proclamation would not, all of a sudden, transform the 
mentality of the governing class of India. He, there- 
fore, publicly expressed his gratitude for the Royat 
message and promised responsive co-operation. 

On the saintly and chivalrous mind of Mahatma 
Gandhi, the Royal Proclamation had a far different 
effect. He believed the message to be a distinct depar- 
ture from the narrow lines of policy hitherto laid down 
and calculated to usher a new era in the national life 
of India. He. therefore, wanted to welcome the mes- 
sage without any reservations. He was strongly sup- 
ported by Pandit Madan Mohan Malaviya and Pandit 
Motilal Nehru. 

At Amritsar, where the Congress met, a triangular 
fight was expected. There was enough courage or 
enthusiasm at the meeting. The question that occured 
to a thoughtful mind was " Would there be the neces- 
sary amount of tact, shrewdness and foresight which the 
occassion demanded ?" Mr. Gandhi's presence and 
arguments infused moral sublimity into the proceedings 
as was seen by the Resolution which condemned the 
excesses (April 19 19) of the infuriated mobs in the 
Punjab and other places. The question was whether 
the Congress would rise to the same height of statesman- 
ship as it did to that of moral sublimity. What should 
be the wording of the resolution about the Reforms ? 



LOKAMANYA TILAK i 293 

Mrs. Besant's proposal, had it been passed, would have 
emphasized our expression of gratitude at the expense 
of our dignity. Mr. Gandhi's resolution was graceful 
without being emphatically dignified. Mr. Tilak's re- 
solution was a unique combination of grace with dignity, 
mellowed by a reasonable expression of gratitude. It 
was not a question merely of grace or gratitude. The 
Resolution, Mr. Tilak said, ought not to tie our hands. 
We must emphatically state that we are fit for an im- 
mediate establishment of Home Rule. We must em- 
phatically state that we are not satisfied with what has 
been given. We must fully reserve our right to carry 
on a vigorous agitation for a very early revision of the 
Government of India Act. We must carry on our propa- 
ganda in other parts of the world and convince the 
different nations of the legitimacy of our demands. 
If the Resolution is too complimentary, if it talks too 
much of gratitude and satisfaction, how shall we, say 
next year, appeal to the British Democracy, to revise 
the Act ? This, in brief, was Mr. Tilak's reasoning. 
In the draft Resolution " Mr. Das reiterated the de- 
mands of the Delhi Congress and declared that the 
Reforms Act is inadequate, unsatifactory and disappoint- 
ing. Mr, Gandhi's argument was that those who label- 
led the Reforms Act as disappointing could not be 
expected to use the same for the early estabhshment of 
Responsible Government in India. Disappointment 
and work could not go hand in hand. He appealed to 
Mr. Tilak, the commentator of the Gita, to solve the 
riddle and have no mental reservations towards those 
in England who were well-disposed towards India. 
Mr. Tilak replied that disappointment should not be 



294 *' RESPONSIVE CO-OPERATION *' 

the reason for keeping oneself aloof from or boycotting the 
Reforms Act ; nay, the Gita enjoins us to accept the 
hievitable and work under distressing circumstances 
with a clear sense of duty. After a lively discussion 
lasting for nearly five hours in the open sessions, Messrs. 
Gandhi, Das, Tilak, Pal, Malaviya come to a compro- 
mise " and the Resolution concluded declaring that 
India should work the Govermnet of India Act so as to 
secure the early establishment of full responsible govern- 
ment. 

In supporting the Resolution, Mr. Tilak made an ex- 
cellent speech. He concluded it in the following signi- 
ficant and statesmanlike words : — 

" We want now clearly to declare, not only here but 
to the whole world that we are not satisfied with the 
Act. We want to continue our agitation. We want 
to utilize it to our best advantage and continue to de- 
mand more and we want the rest of the world to know 
that this is the exact state of things. Do not mislead 
the civilized nations of Europe. Take care of that. 
Do not be too generous, too humane to accept with 
fulsome glee what little has been thrown to you now." 

The fierce controversies at the Amritsar Congress 
threw Mrs. Besant into an unnatural alliance with the 
Moderates ; and the next few months are thick with con- 
troversial dust. It is really painful to see the great lady 
trying to harp on the innocent statement of Mr. Tilak 
" Diplomacy must be met with diplomacy." Mrs. 
Besant complained of being used as a tool by Mr. Tilak, 
called him a menance to India and reported him as 
having said to a prominent member of the Moderate 
Party " I deliberately misrepresent the Moderates; that ia 



LOKAMANYA TILAK 295 

Politics." All this was probably the result of her dis- 
appointment and discomfiture at Delhi (1918) and at 
Amritsar (1919). Her conduct in England was severely 
criticised by Messrs. Khaparde and Patel and her at- 
tempts to persuade Labour leaders not to move Con- 
gress amendments were brought to light. This exaspe- 
rated her beyond all measure and she appealed to the All- 
India Congress Committee to disassociate itself from the 
utterances of Messrs. Patel and Khaparde. This appeal 
was made when Mr. Patel had already sailed for 
England. So Mr. Tilak had to take the sword in his 
behalf and do an unpleasant duty. It is well to cast 
a veil over all these controversies; for nothing pained Mr. 
Tilak more than the attitude of Mrs. Besant, who, he 
always held, was by temperament never a moderate. 
He had publicly appealed to her (March 1920), iu the 
best interests of the country to co-operate with the 
Congress Party. But God had willed it that her path 
should differ from that of the Congress leaders. 

The Moderate Party, with its age-long opposition to 
Mr. Tilak's principles and personality was led in Maha- 
rashtra by the Hon'ble Mr. Paranjpye, who, with true 
iconoclastic fervour, started his new campaign against 
the Nationalists by striking at their idol. When, there- 
fore, an address was proposed to be given at Poona to 
Mr. Tilak on his return from England (November 1919), 
Mr. Paranjpye opposed it by publishing " a catalogue 
of Mr. Tilak's sins of commission and omission." The 
attack failed ; the address was duly given and though 
Mr. Parajpye was challenged to personally lead the op- 
position at the public meeting, he wavered at the last 
moment and remained absent. 



296 " RESPONSIVE CO-OPERATION

The Moderates realized, though a little late that oppo 
sition to an address to Mr. Tilak would bring both defeat 
and bad repute ; their chivalry and decency would be 
questioned. But the sentimental cry of simulta- 
neous compulsory education to the boys and girls of 
Poona was catching. It did not matter that the tax- 
able capacity of the Poona City Municipality did not 
allow an additional annual burden of Rs. 86,500. It did 
not matter that even in Western countries, when on 
economical grounds a choice had to be made, the com- 
pulsory education of boys usually preceded that of the 
girls. It did not even matter that Mr. Gokhale, the 
great apostle of moderation wanted to give free and 
compulsory education to boys first and to girls after- 
wards. The Moderates simply wanted to enjoy a little 
fun at the expense of the Nationalists who were in a 
majority in the City Municipality. The law demand- 
ed that the opposition must not exceed one- third of the 
total number of members. Taking advantage of this 
provision, the Moderates, " in defiance of precedence, 
prudence, practical wisdom and financial knowledge " 
of their own city were willing to see the education of a 
large number of boys neglected, because their oppo- 
nents, the Nationalists could not guarantee the immediate 
education of all the girls in the city on account of 
financial difficulties. 

The Moderates' concern for the free and compulsory 
education of girls at Poona was equalled by their keen 
desire for the free and unrestricted admission of peasant 
delegates to the Poona District Conference held at 
Junnar early in March (1920). Knowing that they 
would be in a minority at the Conference, the Moderates, 



LOKAMANYA TILAK 297 

who at their Conferences held at Bombay and Calcutta, 
had never thought of this concession, began to harp on 
this favourite string. Without even a week's notice to 
the Reception Committee, they wanted to have a num- 
ber of " Peasant Delegates ", secretly pledged to vote 
for them. But the Committee allowed only five " Pea- 
sant Delegates " to each Taluka. The result is curious. 
Not even five peasant delegates repsonded to the call 
and the Conference was a signal triumph of Mr. Tilak 
and his party. 

Through the thick clouds of all these controversies, 
Mr. Tilak was hacking his path to the goal. An old 
acquaintance of the unrepentent Indian bureaucracy, 
he cleariy knew, what even a less experienced man has 
observed that we " are dealing with the most astute and 
diplomatic and clever set of politicians in the worid and 
that they could undo what the Secretary of State has 
done." He had noted how tardily the Bureaucracy had 
responded to the gracious Royal Proclamtion and how 
incomplete was the amnesty to political prisoners. He 
had also noted how the Congress party was rigorously 
excluded from the Advisory Committee on Rules under 
the Government of India Act. But the position he had 
taken from the beginning was one of responsive co-ope- 
ration and he was not required to change it. In a 
speech at Bombay he said : — 

'* We are prepared to co-operate ; but if there is 
nothing to co-operate, we shall not. * * His 
Majesty has asked the people and the authorities 
to co-operate with each other. * * * * It is 
almost a scandal to say that Indians are not pre- 
pared to co-operate for the sake of India ; obey- 



298 "responsive co-operation" 

ing His Majesty means in India loyalty to bureau- 
cracy first and to people afterwards. * * Let 
the authorities declare in what ways they are 
prepared to co-operate with us and we can 
assure them that, if they co-operate with us, we 
can, with them. Co-operation is mutual

Meanwhile, events of far greater import than party 
squabbles or recriminations were happening with shock- 
ing rapidity. The imposition of an unjust, inequitable, 
humiliating and crushing peace on Turkey, in defiance 
of repeated pledges, in defiance of the feeUngs of Indian 
Moslems set aflame the Islamic mind in this country. 
The recklessness with which the sacredness of pledges 
was disregarded produced the deepest impression on the 
mind of Mahatma Gandhi and his moral nature revolted 
against an order of things which rendered possible such 
brutal callousness. The Privy Council Judgment in 
the Am ri tsar case dealt " a severe blow to our constitu- 
tional rights, investing the Viceroy with almost auto- 
cratic power of ordinance-making." It showed how 
** the judgments even of the highest tribunals are not 
unaffected by political considerations." The belated 
publication of the belated report of the belated Hunter 
Commission aggravated the situation by showing how 
the majority of the Commissioners considered cold- 
blooded murders to be mere " grave errors " and 
** unfortunate " or " injudicious " acts. The Viceroy 
condoning the sins of the notorious Satrap of the 
Punjab, the Secretary of State applauding Lord 
Chelmsford, the House of Lords in love with 
General Dyer, — all this was too much even for the most 



LOKAMANVA TILAK 299 

forgiving of all morteils ! As gentle as a lamb, as for- 
giving as an angel, Mahatma Gandhi could not yet 
endure the flagrant injustice of the Simla autocrats ; 
and he determined to unsheathe the sword of non-co- 
opera ton with the ultimate object of bringing round 
the up-holders of this unrighteous poUcy. 

Mr. TUak cordially welcomed the rise of this luminary 
in the firmament of Indian Pohtics ; and as regards 
non-co-operation, Mr. Tilak was a non-co-operator since 
the very beginning of his career. He had set his 
back on Government service and had not cared to prac- 
tise as a pleader in the Government courts ; he had 
given eleven years of his life to the attempt of nation- 
alizing education and had left the Deccan Education 
Society when he found his task impossible. So far, 
therefore, as the first stage of Mahatma Gandhi's pro- 
gramme went, Mr. Tilak had put into practice most of 
the items included therein. As regards the remaining 
three stages, Mr. Tilak would never have shirked advo- 
cating them had he found it necessary in the circumstan- 
ces of the country. There was only one item to which 
he was strongly opposed, and that was the boycott of 
the Councils. This he considered suicidal. He could 
not be suspected of being specially enamoured of the 
Councils as most of the prestige which he commanded 
was due, not to his short membership of the Bombay 
Legislative Council but to his work outside the Council. 
Besides, owing to age and loss of vigour he had almost 
decided not to stand for election. He was however em- 
phatically of opinion that in the agitation to be started 
for a very early revision of the Government of India Act, 
it was necessary to capture most of the seats in the Coun- 



300 " RESPONSIVE CO-OPERATION " 

cils. He differed from Mahatma Gandhi's opinion that 
the Councils are a snare and that there is an insidious 
poison which invariably affects its members. Mr. Tilak 
admitted that this was true when we were in a substan- 
tial minority in the Councils but he held that no danger 
need be anticipated when the Nationahsts would enter 
the Councils not necessarily to co-operate. The most 
aggressive and effective form of non-co-operation would 
be non-co-operation within the Councils and on this he 
had set his heart. 

That is why at the Sholapur Provincial Conference 
(April 2nd, 3rd and 4th), he laboured to carry a resolu- 
tion which called upon the Congress Committees in par- 
ticular and the public in general to *' accept the lead 
given by the Amritsar Congress, in the matter of the 
working of the Reforms Act, and support, at the ensuing 
Council elections, the candidature of persons whose 
allegiance to the Congress is beyond all question.'' The 
bewitching cry of " elect the best men " was raised by 
the minority. Mr. Tilak agreed ; but explained that 
the men to be elected must be best for the purpose in 
view, namely the working of the Reforms Act so as to 
attain full Responsible Government within the shortest 
time possible. He was in no sympathy with best men 
who would merely like to work the act without this 
particular end in view. If we really went in for best 
men, why, in the bureaucratic fold, many capable per- 
sons might be found; but the}' were not wanted, nor tha 
Moderates, if they did not respect the Amritsar Resolu- 
tion. This was too much for the Moderates, who had 
tried their best to attend the Conference in large num- 
bers, though in trying to secure numbers, they had to 



LOKAMANYA tiLAK 30 r 

leave aside principles and get elected through " the 
Deccan Sabha of Poona, hundreds of men of Sholapur, 
as Poona Delegates including known minors, and people 
of doubtful credentials and suspicious characters." 
Mrs. Besant had come all the way from Madras to get 
the Amritsar judgment reversed ; she moved an amend- 
ment which would have enabled the Moderates to stand 
for election in the name of the Congress and through 
the help of the Congress ogencies. But the amend- 
ment was defeated by an over- whelming majority. 

Within a fortnight after the close of the Sholapur 
Conference, Mr. Tilak published the manifesto of the 
" Congress Democratic Party." Though he published 
this document over his signature, still he had consulted 
most of the Nationalist leaders in Western India, and 
it was merely to save valuable time that he thought it 
desirable to publish it on his individual responsibility. 
Those who know that Mr. Tilak wanted to place the 
manifesto for approval before the Special Congress at 
Calcutta, will not blame him for having acted autocra- 
tically in the name of the Congress Democratic Party. 
The Manifesto is a comprehensive document, by no 
means exhaustive ; it lays down the general policy of the 
advanced poUtical party. The Manifesto declares : — 
" This Party proposes to work the Montague Re- 
forms Act for all it is worth, and for accelerating 
the grant of full Responsible Government ; 
and for this purpose it will, without hesitation, 
offer co-operation or resort to constitutional op- 
position, whichever may be expedient and best 
calculated to give effect to the popular will.'' 
What was the object of issuing this Manifesto ? Some 



302 RESPONSIVE CO-OPERATION *' 

unfriendly critics think that Mr. Tilak was pressed — 
nobody knows, by whom — to declare his programme 
and was required to show some constructive work as his 
name was associated with mere destruction. Others 
hold that it was a set off against Mahatma Gandhi's 
programme of Non-co-operation published about this 
time. There are persons who seek to justify Mr. Tilak's 
Manifesto by pointing out that the publication of the 
Congress Democratic Party's Manifesto was followed by 
the publication of at least half a dozen similar docu- 
ments from different groups of politicians in India. 
The truth is that the manifesto of Mr. Tilak forms only 
a link in the work of organisation required for carrying 
the Councils elections, on which Mr. Tilak had set his 
heart. The first step was, of course, the Amritsar Re- 
solution. The Sholapur Conference which followed, 
developed the Amritsar Resolution, and specified the 
persons eligible for election under the Congress banner. 
The Manifesto followed, pointing out at length, the 
scope of the work of the Congress Party. The fourth 
step was taken when at the Annual Conference of the 
Indian Home Rule League, the services of the League 
were placed at the disposal of persons belonging to the 
Congress Democratic Party and desirous of standing as 
candidates for Councils. Mr. Tilak's next idea was to get 
the Congress Democratic Party's Manifesto approved of 
by the Special Session of the Congress at Calcutta. 
He intended to make this Congress concentrate upon 
the elections in November 1920 ; and then, after having 
established an over- whelming majority in the Councils, 
he intended at Nagpur to give an ultimatum to the 
Bureaucracy. Had the Bureaucracy failed to respond^ 



LOKAMANYA HLAK 3O3 

the Nationalists' majority would have absented itself 
from the councils or taken to other forms of opposition 
which would have brought the Bureaucracy to their 

knees. 

It should be noted that this programme was not at all 
inconsistent with the acceptance of Mahatma Gandhi's. 
Indeed, it seems certain that both the Mahatma and the 
Lokamanya would have fused their programmes into 
one. Had Mr. Tilak lived, the whole of Mr. Gandhi's 
programme and not merely its first step, would, very 
probably, have been accepted by the Calcutta Congress, 
with the proviso, that the Councils were not to be boy- 
cotted. The Nation would thus have been able to wage 
a battle royal with the Bureaucracy — ^within and out- 
side the councils, the one helping the progress of the 
other ; and the sad spectacle of the Bureaucracy trying 
to crush the Non-co-operators with the aid of the Mode- 
rates in the Councils, would never have been seen. 
Had repression come, it would have appeared hideous 
in all its nakedness.
