> §1. Conversion of Yashas
>
>  1. There lived in the town of Benares a nobleman's son called
> Yashas. He was young in years and very attractive in appearance. He
> was beloved of his parents. He lived in abounding wealth. He had a big
> retinue and a large harem, and passed his time in nothing but dancing,
> drinking and carnal pleasures.  
>  2. As time past \[=passed\], a feeling of disgust came over him.
> How could he escape from this orgy? Was there any better way of life
> than the way he was leading? Not knowing what to do, he decided to
> leave his father's house.  
>  3. One night he left his father's house and was wandering about;
> He happened to wend his way towards Isipathana.  
>  4. Feeling tired, he sat down; and as he was seated he said to
> himself in loud tones, 'Where am I, what is the way? Alas! What
> distress; alas! What danger!'  
>  5. This happened on the night of the same day on which the Blessed
> One preached his first sermon to the Panchavargiya Bhikkus at
> Isipathana. Just when Yashas was approaching Isipathana, the Blessed
> One, who was staying at Isipathana, having arisen at dawn, was walking
> up and down in the open. air. And the Blessed One saw Yashas, the
> noble youth coming from \[Benares?\] after giving utterance to his
> feelings.  
>  6. And the Blessed One, having heard his cry of distress, said,
> "There is no distress, there is no danger. Come, I will show you the
> way," and the Blessed Lord preached his gospel to Yashas.  
>  7. And Yashas, when he heard it, became glad and joyful; and he
> put off his gilt slippers, and went and sat down near the Blessed One
> and respectedly saluted him.  
>  8. Yashas, hearing the Buddha's words, requested the Blessed One
> to take him as his disciple.  
>  9. Then he bade him come, and asked him to be a Bhikku, to which
> Yashas agreed.  
>  10. The parents of Yashas were in great distress on finding that
> their son had disappeared. The father started in search. Yashas's
> father passed by the same spot where the Lord and Yashas in the
> Bhikku's garb were seated, and in passing, he asked the Blessed One,
> "Pray, have you seen Yashas, my son?"  
>  11. The Lord replied, "Come in, Sir, you will find your son." He
> went in and sat near his son, but he knew him not.  
>  12. The Lord explained to him how Yashas met him, and how on
> hearing him he became a Bhikku. The father then recognised his son and
> was happy his son had chosen the right path.  
>  13. "My son, Yashas," said the father, "your mother is absorbed in
> lamentations and grief. Return home and restore your mother to
> life."  
>  14. Then Yashas looked at the Blessed One, and the Blessed One
> said to Yashas's father, "Is that your wish, that Yashas should return
> to the world and enjoy the pleasures of a worldly life as he did
> before?"  
>  15. And Yasha's father replied, "If Yashas, my son, finds it a
> gain to stay with you, let him stay." Yashas preferred to remain a
> Bhikku.  
>  16. Before departing Yashas's father said, "May the Blessed One, O
> Lord, consent to take his meal at my home with the members of my
> family."  
>  17. The Blessed One, having donned his robes, took his alms bowl
> and went with Yashas to the house of his father.  
>  18. When they arrived there, they met the mother and also the
> former wife of Yashas. After the meal, the Blessed One preached to the
> members of the family his doctrine. They became very happy and
> promised to take refuge in it.  
>  19. Now there were four friends of Yashas belonging to the wealthy
> family \[=families\] of Benares. Their names were Vimala, Subahu,
> Punyajit ,and Gavampati.  
>  20. When Yashas's friends learned that Yashas had taken refuge in
> the Buddha and his Dhamma, they felt that what is \[=was\] good for
> Yashas must be good for them.  
>  21. So they went to Yashas and asked him to approach the Buddha on
> their behalf, to receive them as his disciples.  
>  22. Yashas agreed and he went to the Buddha, saying, "May the
> Blessed One preach the Dhamma to these four friends of mine." The
> Lord agreed, and Yashas's friends took refuge in the Dhamma.
>
>   
> § 2. Conversion of the Kassyapas
>
>  1. There lived in Benaras a family known as the Kassyapa family.
> There were three sons in the family. They were very highly educated,
> and carried on a rigorous religious life.  
>  2. After some time the eldest son thought of taking up Sannyasa.
> Accordingly he left his home, took Sannyasa, and went in the direction
> of Uruvella, where he established his Ashram.  
>  3. His two younger brothers followed him, and they too became
> Sannyasis.  
>  4. They were all Agnihotris, or worshippers of fire. They were
> called Jatilas because they kept \[=wore\] long hair.  
>  5. The three brothers were known as Uruvella Kassyapa, Nadi
> Kassyapa (Kassyapa of the River, i.e., the Niranjana), and Gaya
> Kassyapa (of the village Gaya).  
>  6. Of these the Uruvella Kassyapa had a following of five hundred
> Jatilas; Nadi Kassyapa had three hundred Jatilas as his disciples; and
> Gaya Kassyapa had two hundred Jatilas. Of these the chief was Uruvella
> Kassyapa.  
>  7. The fame of Uruvella Kassyapa had spread far and wide. He was
> known to have obtained Mukti (Salvation) while alive. People from
> far-away places came to his Ashram, which was located on the banks of
> the river Falgu.  
>  8. The Blessed Lord, having come to know of the name and fame of
> Uruvella Kassyapa, thought of preaching his gospel to him and if
> possible \[seeking\] to convert him to his Dhamma.  
>  9. Having come to know of his whereabouts, the Blessed Lord went
> to Uruvella.  
>  10. The Blessed One met him and, wanting to have an opportunity to
> instruct him and convert him, said, "If it is not disagreeable to you,
> Kassyapa, let me dwell one night in your Ashram."  
>  11. "I am not agreeable to this," said Kassyapa. "There is a
> savage Naga king called Muchalinda who rules over this place. He is
> possessed of dreadful powers. He is the deadly enemy of all ascetics
> performing fire worship. He pays nocturnal visits to their Ashrams and
> does them great harm. I fear he may do you the same harm as he does to
> me."  
>  12. Kassyapa did not know that the Nagas had become the friends
> and followers of the Blessed One. But the Blessed One knew it.  
>  13. So the Blessed One pressed for his request, saying, "He is not
> likely to do any harm to me; pray, Kassyapa, allow me a place in your
> fire room, for one night."  
>  14. Kassyapa continued to raise many difficulties, and the Blessed
> One continued to press his request.  
>  15. Then Kassyapa said, "My mind desires no controversy, only I
> have my fears and apprehensions, but follow your own good pleasure."  
>  16. The Blessed Lord forthwith stepped into the fire grove and
> took his seat.  
>  17. The Naga king Muchalinda came into the room at his usual time.
> But instead of finding Kassyapa, he found the Blessed One seated in
> his place.  
>  18. Muchalinda, seeing the Lord seated, his face glowing with
> peace and serenity, felt as though he was in the presence of a great
> divinity, and bending his head, began to worship.  
>  19. That night Kassyapa's sleep was very much disturbed by the
> thought of what might have happened to his guest. So he got up with
> great misgivings, fearing that his guest might have been burnt up.  
>  20. Then Kassyapa and his followers at morning light came, one and
> all, to have a look. Far from the Lord injured by Muchalinda, they
> found Muchalinda worshipping the Lord.  
>  21. Beholding the scene, Kassyapa felt that he was witnessing a
> great miracle.  
>  22. Struck by this miracle, Kassyapa requested the Blessed Lord to
> stay near him and make an Ashram, and promised to look after him.  
>  23. The Blessed Lord agreed to stay on.  
>  24. The two, however, had different motives. Kassyapa's motive was
> to obtain protection against Muchalinda Naga. The Blessed Lord thought
> that one day Kassyapa will \[=would\] give him \[an\] opportunity to
> propound his gospel.  
>  25. But Kassyapa showed no such inclination. He thought that the
> Blessed Lord was only a miracle maker and nothing more.  
>  26. One day the Blessed Lord thought of himself taking the
> initiative, and asked Kassyapa, "Are you an Arhant?  
>  27. "If you are not an Arhant, what good is this Agnihotra going
> to do to you?"  
>  28. Kassyapa said, "I do not know what is to be an Arhant. Will
> you explain it to me?"  
>  29. The Lord then told Kassyapa, "An Arhant is one who has
> conquered all the passions which disturb a man from pursuing the
> eight-fold Path. Agnihotra cannot cleanse a man of his sins."  
>  30. Kassyapa was a proud person. But he did feel the force of the
> Blessed Lord's argument. Making his mind pliant and yielding, until at
> length prepared to be a vehicle of the true law, he confessed that his
> poor wisdom could not compare with the wisdom of the world-honoured
> One.  
>  31. And so, convinced at last, humbly submitting, Uruvella
> Kassyapa accepted the doctrine of the Lord and became his follower.  
>  32. Following their master, the followers of Kassyapa, virtuously
> submissive, in turn received the teaching of the law. Kassyapa and all
> his followers were thus entirely converted.  
>  33. Uruvella Kassyapa then, lifting his goods and all his
> sacrificial vessels, threw them together into the river, which floated
> \[them\] down upon the surface of the current.  
>  34. Nadi and Gaya, who dwelt down the stream, seeing these
> articles of clothing (and the rest) floating along the stream \[all\]
> disorderly, said, "These are the belongings of our brother; why has he
> thrown them away? Some great change has happened," and \[they\] were
> deeply pained and restless. The two, each with five hundred followers,
> went up the stream to seek their brother.  
>  35. On seeing him and all his followers now dressed as hermits,
> strange thoughts engaged their minds, and they inquired into the
> reasons. Uruvella Kassyapa told them the story of his conversion to
> the Buddha's Dhamma.  
>  36. "Our brother having submitted thus, we too should also follow
> him," they said.  
>  37. They conveyed their wishes to their eldest brother. Then the
> two brothers, with all their band of followers, were brought to hear
> the Lord's discourse on the comparison of a fire sacrifice with his
> own gospel.  
>  38. In his discourse to the two brothers the Blessed Lord said:
> "The dark smoke of ignorance arises, whilst confused thoughts, like
> wood drilled into wood, create the fire.  
>  39. "Lust, anger, delusion, these are as fire produced, and these
> enflame and burn all other things which cause grief and sorrow in the
> world.  
>  40. "If once this way is found, and lust, anger and delusion
> consumed, then with it is born sight, knowledge, and pure conduct.  
>  41. "So when the heart of a man has once conceived distaste for
> sin, this distaste removes covetous desire; covetous desire
> extinguished, there is recluse \[=refuge?\]."  
>  42. The great Rishis, listening to him, lost all regard for fire
> worship, and wished to be the disciples of the Buddha.  
>  43. The conversion of the Kassyapas was a great triumph for the
> Blessed Lord. For they had a very strong hold on the imagination of
> the people.
>
>   
> § 3. Conversion of Sariputta and Moggallana
>
>  1. While the Blessed Lord was in Rajagraha there resided \[there\]
> a well-known person, by name Sanjaya, with a great retinue of
> Parivrajakas numbering about two hundred and fifty as his disciples.  
>  2. Among his disciples were Sariputta and Moggallana--two young
> Brahmins.  
>  3. Sariputta and Moggallana were not satisfied with the teachings
> of Sanjaya, and were in search of something better.  
>  4. Now one day the venerable Assaji, one of the Panchvargiya
> Bhikkus, in the forenoon, having put on his under-robes, and having
> taken his alms bowl and outer robe, entered the city of Rajagraha for
> alms.  
>  5. Sariputta was observing the dignified deportment of Assaji, and
> was struck by it. On seeing the venerable Assaji, Sariputta thought,
> "Indeed this person is one of those monks who are the worthy ones in
> the world. What if I were to approach this monk and to ask him, 'In
> whose name, friend, have you retired from the world? Who is your
> teacher? Whose Dhamma do you profess?'"  
>  6. Now Sariputta thought, " This is not the time to ask this monk;
> he has entered the inner yard of a house for alms. What if I were to
> follow this monk step by step, according to the course recognised by
> those who want something?"  
>  7. And the venerable Assaji, having finished his alms pilgrimage
> through Rajagraha, went back with the food he had received. Then
> Sariputta went to the place where the venerable Assaji was; having
> approached him, he exchanged greetings; and with complaisant words, he
> stood at his side.  
>  8. Standing at his side, the wandering ascetic Sariputta said to
> the venerable Assaji, "Your countenance, friend, is serene; your
> complexion is pure and bright. In whose name, friend, have you retired
> from the world? Who is your teacher? Whose Dhamma do you profess?"  
>  9. Assaji replied, "There is, friend, the great recluse of the
> Sakya's clan; in this Blessed One's name have I retired from the
> world; this Blessed One is my teacher, and it is the Dhamma of this
> Blessed One that I follow."  
>  10. "And what, venerable Sir, is the doctrine which your teacher
> holds? And what does he preach to you?"  
>  11. "I am only a young disciple, friend; I have but recently
> received ordination; and I have newly adopted this Dhamma and
> discipline. I cannot explain to you the Dhamma in detail; but I will
> tell you in short what it means."  
>  12. Then Sariputta, the wandering ascetic, said to the venerable
> Assaj, "So be it, friend, tell me as much or as little as you like,
> but tell me the meaning, I want just meaning. Why make so much of the
> letter?"  
>  13. Then the venerable Assaji explained to Sariputta the substance
> of the teachings of the Buddha, and Sariputta was completely
> satisfied.  
>  14. Sariputta and Moggallana, though not brothers, were bound
> together as hough they were brothers. They had given their word to
> each other: he who first attains the truth shall tell the same to the
> other one. That was their mutual engagement.  
>  15. Accordingly Sariputta went to the place where Moggallana was.
> Seeing him, he said to Sariputta, "Your countenance, friend, is
> serene; your complexion is pure and bright. Have you then really
> reached the truth?"  
>  16. "Yes, friend, I have come to know the truth." "And how,
> friend, have you done so?" Then Sariputta told him what happened
> between him and Assaji.  
>  17. Then Moggallana said to Sariputta, "Let us go, friend, and
> join the Blessed One; that he, the Blessed One, may be our teacher."  
>  18. Sariputta replied: "It is on our account, friend, that these
> two hundred and fifty wandering Parivrajakas live here, and it is we
> whom they regard; let us first tell them before taking leave of them;
> they will do what they think fit."  
>  19. Then Sariputta and Moggallana went to the place where they
> were; having approached them, they said to them, "Friends, we are
> going to join the Blessed One; he, the Blessed One, is our teacher."  
>  20. They replied, "It is on your account. Sirs, that we live here,
> and it is you whom we regard; if you. Sirs, will lead the holy life
> under the great Samana, we all will do the same."  
>  21. Then Sariputta and Moggallana went to the place where Sanjaya
> was; having approached him, they said, "Friend, we go to join the
> Blessed One; he, the Blessed One, is our teacher."  
>  22. Sanjaya replied, "Nay, friends, do not go; we will all three
> look after this company."  
>  23. And a second and third time Sariputta and Moggallana said
> this. and Sanjaya answered as before.  
>  24. Then Sariputta and Moggallana took with them two hundred and
> fifty wandering ascetics and went to the Veluvana in Rajagraha, where
> the Blessed One was staying.  
>  25. And the Blessed One saw them--Sariputta and Moggallana, coming
> from afar; on seeing them he thus addressed the monks: "There, monks,
> arrive two companions," pointing towards Sariputta and Moggallana;
> "these will be my chief pair of disciples, and \[an\] auspicious
> pair."  
>  26. When they had arrived at the bamboo grove, they went to the
> place where the Blessed One was; having approached him, they
> prostrated themselves, with their heads at the feet of the Blessed
> One, and said to the Blessed One, "Lord, let us receive ordination
> from the Blessed One."  
>  27. The Blessed One then uttered the usual formula indicating
> admission, "Ehi Bhikku" (Come, Monks), and Sariputta and Moggallana
> and the two hundred Jatilas became the disciples of the Buddha.
>
>   
> § 4. Conversion of King Bimbisara
>
>  1. Rajagraha was the capital of Seniya Bimbisara, King of
> Magadha.  
>  2. Having heard of the conversions of this large number of
> Jatilas, everyone in the city had begun to talk about the Blessed
> One.  
>  3. Thus King Bimbisara came to know of his arrival in the city.  
>  4. "To have converted the most orthodox and the most obstinate
> Jatilas was no mean task." "Truly so," said King Bimbisara to himself,
> "he must be the Blessed, holy, absolute Buddha, proficient in
> knowledge and conduct, the way-farer, who understands the world, the
> highest one who guides men, the teacher of gods and men. He must be
> teaching the truth, which he understood himself.  
>  5. "He must be preaching that Dhamma which is lovely in the
> beginning, lovely in the middle, lovely at the end, in the spirit and
> in the letter; he must be proclaiming the consummate perfect, pure,
> and holy life. It is good to obtain the sight of a man like him."  
>  6. So King Bimbisara, surrounded by twelve myriads of Magadha
> Brahmins and householders, went to the place where the Blessed One
> was. Having approached him and respectfully saluted the Blessed One,
> he sat down near him. And of those twelve myriads of Magadha Brahmins
> and householders, some also respectfully saluted the Blessed One and
> sat down near him; some exchanged greetings with the Blessed One, and
> having done so they sat down near him with complaisant words; some
> bent their clasped hands towards the Blessed One and sat down near
> him; some made known their name and family name before the Blessed One
> and sat down near him; some sat down near him silently.  
>  7. Now those twelve myriads of Magadha Brahmins and householders
> saw Uruvella Kassyapa among the monks who came with the Blessed Lord.
> They thought, "How now is this? Does the great Samana follow the holy
> life under Uruvella Kassyapa, or does Uruvella Kassyapa follow the
> holy life under the great Samana?"  
>  8. And the Blessed One, who understood in his mind the reflection
> which had arisen in the minds of those twelve myriads of Magadha
> Brahmins and householders, addressed the venerable Uruvella Kassyapa,
> "What has thou seen, O dweller of Uruvella, that thou who art called
> the great one has forsaken the fire worship? How is it thou has
> forsaken the fire sacrifice?"  
>  9. Kassyapa replied, "It is sights and sounds, and also tastes,
> and women of sense-desire that the sacrifices promise; \[it was\]
> because I understood that these things are impure that I took no more
> delight in sacrifices and offerings."  
>  10. "But if you don't mind, tell us what made you think so."  
>  11. Then the venerable Uruvella Kassyapa rose from his seat,
> adjusted his upper robe so as to cover one shoulder, prostrated
> himself, inclining his head to the feet of the Blessed One, and said
> to the Blessed One, "My teacher is the Blessed One, I. am his pupil."
> Then those twelve myriads of Magadha Brahmins and householders
> understood, "Uruvella Kassyapa follows the holy life under the great
> Samana."  
>  12. And the Blessed One, who understood in his mind 'the
> reflection that had arisen in the minds of those twelve myriads of
> Magadha Brahmins and householders, preached to them his Dhamma. Just
> as a clean cloth free from black specks properly takes the dye, thus
> eleven myriads of those Magadha Brahmins and householders with
> Bimbisara at their head, while sitting there, obtained the pure and
> spotless dye of the Dhamma. One myriad announced their having become
> lay followers.  
>  13. Then the Magadha king, Seniya Bimbisara, having witnessed the
> scene, having understood the Dhamma, having penetrated the Dhamma,
> having overcome uncertainty, having dispelled all doubts, having
> gained full knowledge, said to the Blessed One, "In former days, Lord,
> when I was a prince, I entertained five aspirations; these are now
> fulfilled.  
>  14. "In former days. Lord, to me when I was a prince, came this
> thought: 'O that I might be inaugurated king!' That was my first
> aspiration, Lord; that is now fulfilled. 'And might then a holy one, a
> fully Enlightened One, come over into my kingdom!' This was my second
> aspiration, Lord; that is now fulfilled. 'And might I minister to that
> Blessed One!' That was my third aspiration. Lord; that is now
> fulfilled.' And might he, the Blessed One, preach the Dhamma to me!'
> This was my fourth aspiration, Lord ; and that is now fulfilled. 'And
> might I understand the Dhamma of that Blessed One!' This was my fifth
> aspiration, Lord; this is now fulfilled. These were my five
> aspirations, Lord, which I entertained in former days when I was a
> prince.  
>  15. "Wonderful, Lord! Wonderful, just as if one should set up what
> had been overturned, or should reveal what had been hidden, or should
> point out the way to one who had lost his way, or should bring a lamp
> into the darkness, in order that those who had eyes might see things;
> thus has the Blessed One preached the Dhamma in many ways. I take
> refuge, Lord, in that Blessed One, and in the Dhamma, and in the
> fraternity of Bhikkus (monks). May the Blessed One receive me from
> this day forth, while my life lasts, as a lay disciple who has taken
> refuge in him."
>
>   
> § 5. Conversion of Anathapindika
>
>  1. Sudatta was a resident of Shravasti, the capital of the kingdom
> of Kosala. It was ruled by King Pasenjit. Sudatta was treasurer of the
> king. From his bounties to the poor, Sudatta was known as
> Anathapindika.  
>  2. When the Lord was at Rajagraha, Anathapindika happened to visit
> the place on some private business of his own. He was stopping with
> his sister, who was married to the guild master of Rajagraha.  
>  3. When he arrived he found the guild master preparing a meal for
> the Lord and his monks, on so great a scale that he thought that a
> wedding was in progress or that the king had been invited.  
>  4. On learning the truth, he became very eager to visit the Lord,
> and he set out in the very night to meet the Blessed One.  
>  5. And the Blessed One saw at once the sterling quality of
> Anathapindika's heart, and greeted him with words of comfort. After
> taking his seat, Anathapindika expressed a desire to hear a discourse
> on some religious subject.  
>  6. The Blessed Lord, responding to his wishes ,raised the
> question, "Who is it that shapes our lives? Is it Ishavara, a personal
> creator? If Ishavara be the maker, all living things should have
> silently to submit to their maker's power. They would be like vessels
> formed by the potter's hand. If the world had been made by Ishavara,
> there should be no such thing as sorrow, or calamity, or sin; for both
> pure and impure deeds must come from him. If not, there would be
> another cause beside him, and he would not be the self-existent one.
> Thus, you see, the thought of Ishavara is overthrown.  
>  7. "Again, it is said that the Absolute cannot be a cause. All
> things around us come from a cause, as the plant comes from the seed;
> how can the Absolute be the cause of all things alike? If it pervades
> them, then certainly it does not make them.  
>  8. "Again, it is said that self is the maker. But if self is the
> maker, why did he not make things pleasing? The cases of sorrow and
> joy are real and objective. How can they have been made by self?  
>  9. "Again, if you adopt the argument \[that\] there is no maker,
> or fate in \[=is\] such as it is, and there is no causation, what use
> would there be in shaping our lives, and adjusting means to an end?  
>  10. "Therefore, we argue that all things that exist are not
> without cause. However, neither Ishavara, nor the Absolute, nor the
> self, nor causeless chance, is the maker, but our deeds produce
> results both good and evil.  
>  11. "The whole world is under the law of causation, and the causes
> that act are not un-mental, for the gold of which the cup is made is
> gold throughout.  
>  12. "Let us, then, surrender the heresies of worshipping Ishavara
> and praying to him; let us not lose ourselves in vain speculations of
> profitless subtleties; let us surrender self and all selfishness; and
> as all things are fixed by causation, let us practise good so that
> good may result from our actions."  
>  13. And Anathapindika said, "I see the truth of what the Blessed
> One has said, and I wish to open my whole mind. Having listened to my
> words, let the Lord advise me what I should do.  
>  14. "My life is full of work; and having acquired great wealth, I
> am surrounded with cares. Yet do I enjoy my work, and I apply myself
> to it with all diligence. Many people are in my employ, and depend
> upon the success of my enterprises.  
>  15. "Now, I have heard your disciples praise the bliss of the
> hermit and denounce the unrest of the world. 'The Blessed One,' they
> say, 'has given up his kingdom and his inheritance, and has found the
> path of righteousness, thus setting an example to all the world how to
> attain Nirvana.'  
>  16. "My heart yearns to do what is right, and to be a blessing
> unto my fellow-beings. Let me then ask you, must I give up my wealth,
> my home, and my business enterprises, and, like you, go into
> homelessness, in order to attain the bliss of a religious life?"  
>  17. And the Blessed Lord replied, "The bliss of a religious life
> is attainable by everyone who walks in the noble eight-fold path. He
> that cleaves to wealth, had better cast it away than allow his heart
> to be poisoned by it; but he who does not cleave to wealth, and,
> possessing riches, uses them rightly, will be a blessing unto his
> fellow-beings.  
>  18. "I say unto thee, remain in thy station of life, and apply
> thyself with diligence to thy enterprises. It is not life and wealth
> and power that enslave men, but the cleaving to life and wealth and
> power.  
>  19. "The Bhikku who retires from the world in order to lead a life
> of leisure will have no gain. For a life of indolence is an
> abomination, and lack of energy is to be despised.  
>  20. "The Dhamma of the Tathagata does not require a man to go into
> homelessness or to resign the world, unless he feels called upon to do
> so; what the Dhamma of the Tathagata requires is for every man to free
> himself from the illusion of self, to cleanse his heart, to give up
> his thirst for pleasure, and lead a life of righteousness.  
>  21. "And whatever men do, whether they remain in the world as
> artisans, merchants, and officers of the king, or retire from the
> world and devote themselves to a life of religious meditation, let
> them put their whole heart into their task; let them be diligent and
> energetic; and, if they are like the lotus, which, though it grows in
> the water, yet remains untouched by the water, if they struggle in
> life without cherishing envy or hatred, if they live in the world a
> life not of self but a life of truth, then surely joy, peace, and
> bliss will dwell in their minds."  
>  22. Anathapindika perceived that this was the most excellent
> system of truth, simple and of wisdom born.  
>  23. Thus firmly settled in the true doctrine, he slowly bent in
> worship at the feet of the Blessed One, and with closed hands made his
> request.

> § 6. Conversion of King Pasenjit
>
>  1. Then King Pasenjit, hearing that the Lord had come, went in his
> royal equipage to the Jetavana Vihara. Saluting him with clasped
> hands, he said:  
>  2. "Blessed is my unworthy and obscure kingdom, that it has met
> with so great a fortune. For how can calamities and dangers befall it
> in the presence of Lord of the World, the Dharma Raja, the King of
> Truth?  
>  3. "Now that I have seen your sacred features, let me partake of
> the refreshing waters of your teachings.  
>  4. "Worldly profit is fleeting and perishable, but religious
> profit is eternal and inexhaustible. A worldly man, though a king, is
> full of trouble, but even a common man who is holy has peace of
> mind."  
>  5. Knowing the tendency of the king's heart, weighed down by
> avarice and love of pleasure, the Blessed One seized the opportunity
> and said:  
>  6. "Even those who, have been born in low degree, when they see a
> virtuous man feel reverence for him, how much more must an independent
> king, who by his previous conditions of life has acquired much merit,
> feel?  
>  7. "And now as I briefly expound the law, let the Maharaja listen
> and weigh my words, and hold fast to what I say.  
>  8. "Our good or evil deeds follow us continually like shadows.  
>  9. "That which is most needed is a loving heart!  
>  10. "Regard your people as we do an only son. Do not oppress them,
> do not destroy them; keep in due check every member of your body,
> forsake unrighteous doctrines, and walk in the straight path; do not
> exalt yourself by trampling down others. Give comfort and befriend the
> sufferer.  
>  11. "Neither ponder much on kingly dignity, nor listen to the
> smooth words of flatterers.  
>  12. "There is no profit in vexing oneself by austerities, but
> meditate on Dhamma and weigh the righteous law.  
>  13. "We are enclosed on all sides by the rocks of sorrow and ill,
> and only by considering the true law can we escape from this
> sorrow-filled mountain.  
>  14, "What profit, then, in practising inequity?  
>  15. "All who are wise spurn the pleasures of the body. They loathe
> lust and seek to promote their spiritual existence.  
>  16. "When a tree is burning with fierce flames, how can the birds
> congregate therein? Truth cannot dwell where passion lives. Without a
> knowledge of this, the learned man, though he may be praised as a
> sage, is ignorant.  
>  17. "On him who has this knowledge true wisdom dawns. To acquire
> this wisdom is the one aim needed. To neglect it implies the failure
> of life.  
>  18. "The teachings of all schools should centre here, for without
> it there is no reason.  
>  19. "This truth is not for the hermit alon ; it concerns every
> human being, priest and layman alike. There is no distinction between
> the monk who has taken the vows, and the man of the world living with
> his family. There are hermits who fall into perdition, and there are
> humble householders who mount to the rank of rishis.  
>  20. "The tide of lust is a danger common to all; it carries away
> the world. He who is involved in its eddies finds no escape. But
> wisdom is the handy boat, reflection is the rudder. The slogan of
> religion calls you to the rescue of your self from the assaults of
> Mara, the enemy.  
>  21. "Since it is impossible to escape the result of our deeds, let
> us practise good works.  
>  22. "Let us inspect our thoughts \[so\] that we do no evil, for as
> we sow so shall we reap.  
>  23. "There are ways from light into darkness, and from darkness
> into light. There are ways, also, from gloom into deeper darkness, and
> from the dawn into brighter light. The wise man will use the light as
> he has to receive more light. He will constantly advance to the
> knowledge of the truth.  
>  24. "Exhibit true superiority by virtuous conduct and the exercise
> of reason; meditate deeply on the vanity of earthly things, and
> understand the fickleness of life.  
>  25. "Elevate the mind, and seek sincere faith with firm purpose;
> transgress not the rules of kingly conduct, and let your happiness
> depend not upon external things, but upon your own mind. Thus you will
> lay up a good name for distant ages.  
>  26. The king listened with reverence, and remembered all the words
> of the Blessed One in his heart, and promised to become his lay
> disciple.
>
>   
> § 7. Conversion of Jeevaka
>
>  1. Jeevaka was the son of Salvati, a courtesan of Rajagraha.  
>  2. Immediately after birth the child, being illegitimate, was
> placed in a basket and thrown on a dust-heap.  
>  3. A large number of people were standing by the dust-heap
> watching the child. Abhaya, the Raja-kumara, happened to pass by the
> site. He questioned the people, who said, "It is alive."  
>  4. For this reason the child was called Jeevaka. Abhaya adopted
> him and brought him up.  
>  5. When Jeevaka grew in age, he learned how he was saved, and was
> charged with the intense desire to qualify himself to save others.  
>  6. He therefore went to the University of Takashila without the
> knowledge and permission of Abhaya, and studied medicine for seven
> years.  
>  7. Returning to Rajagraha, he set up his practice as a doctor, and
> within a very short time acquired a great name and fame in the
> profession.  
>  8. His first patient was the wife of a sethi of Saketa, and for
> curing her he received sixteen thousand kahapanas, a man-servant, a
> maid-servant, and a coach with a horse.  
>  9. Knowing his eminence, Abhaya gave him residence in his own
> establishment.  
>  10. At Rajagraha he cured Bimbisara of a troublesome fistula, and
> is said to have received as reward all the ornaments of Bimbisara's
> five hundred wives.  
>  11. Other noteworthy cures of Jeevaka included that of the sethi
> of Rajagraha, on whom he performed the operation of trepanning; and of
> the son of the sethi of Benares, who was suffering from chronic
> intestinal trouble due to misplacement.  
>  12. Jeevaka was appointed physician to the king and the king's
> women.  
>  13. But Jeevaka was greatly attached to the Blessed Lord.
> Consequently he also acted as a physician to him and the Sangh.  
>  14. He became a disciple of the Lord. The Blessed Lord did not
> make him a Bhikku, as he wanted him to remain free to tend to the sick
> and the wounded.  
>  15. When Bimbisara died, Jeevaka continued to serve his son
> Ajatsatru, and was mainly instrumental in bringing him to the Lord
> after his crime of parricide.
>
>   
> § 8. The Conversion of Ratthapala
>
>  1. Once when the Lord was on an alms pilgrimage in the Kuru
> country with a great company of almsmen, he stayed at Thullakotthita,
> which was a township of the Kurus.  
>  2. They came to know of it, and went to him to pay their
> respects.  
>  3. When they were seated, the Lord instructed them with a
> discourse on the Doctrine. Having received their instruction from the
> Lord, the Brahmin heads of houses of Thullakotthita gratefully thanked
> him, rose up, and departed with deep obeisance.  
>  4. Seated among them was a young man named Ratthapala, a scion of
> a leading family of the place, to whom this thought came, "So far as I
> understand the Doctrine which the Lord has preached, \[it\] is no easy
> matter for one who lives in a home to lead the higher life in all its
> fullness, purity, and perfection.  
>  5. "What if I were to cut off hair and beard, don the yellow
> robes, and go forth from home to homelessness as a pilgrim!"  
>  6. When the Brahmins had not been gone long, then Ratthapala came
> up and, after salutations, told the Lord the thought which had come to
> him, and asked to be admitted to, and confirmed in, the confraternity
> under him.  
>  7. "Have you your parents' consent to this step, Ratthapala?'
> asked the Lord.  
>  8. "No, Sir."  
>  9. "I do not admit those who have not their parents' consent."  
>  10. "That consent. Sir, I will take steps to obtain," said the
> young man; who, rising up and taking a reverential leave of the Lord,
> went off to his parents, told them his thoughts, and asked their
> consent to his becoming a Bhikku.  
>  11. The parents made answer as follows, "Dear Ratthapala, you are
> our only son, very dear to us and beloved; you live in comfort and
> have been brought up in comfort, with no experience at all of
> discomfort. Go away; eat, drink, enjoy yourself, and do good works in
> all happiness. We refuse our consent.  
>  12. "Your death would leave us desolate, with no pleasure left in
> life; why, while we have you still, should we consent to your going
> forth from home to homelessness as a Bhikku?"  
>  13. A second and yet a third time did Ratthapala repeat his
> request, only to be met by the same refusal from his parents.  
>  14. Failing thus to get his parents' consent, the young man flung
> himself down on the bare ground, declaring that he would either die
> there or become a Bhikku.  
>  15. His parents entreated him to get up, while repeating their
> objections to his becoming a Bhikku, but the young man said not a
> word. A second and a third time they entreated him, but still he said
> not a word.  
>  16. So the parents sought out Ratthapala's companions, to whom
> they told all this and besought them to urge, as from themselves, what
> his parents had said to him.  
>  17. Thrice his companions appealed to him, but still he said not a
> word. So his companions came to the parents with this report, "There
> on the bare ground he lies, declaring that he will either die there or
> become a Bhikku. If you refuse your consent, he will never get up
> alive. But if you give your consent, you will see him when he has
> become a Bhikku. Should he not like being a Bhikku, what alternative
> will he have! Why, only to come back here. Do give your consent!" they
> urged.  
>  18. "Yes, we consent; but when he is a Bhikku, he must come and
> see us."  
>  19. Off now went his companions to Ratthapala, and they told him
> that his parents had given their consent, but that when he was a
> Bhikku he was to come and see them.  
>  20. Thereupon the young man arose and, when he had regained his
> strength, betook himself to the Lord, and after salutations, seated
> himself on one side, saying, "I have got my parents' consent to my
> becoming a Bhikku; I ask the Lord to admit me."  
>  21. Admission and confirmation were granted him under the Lord;
> and a fortnight afterwards the Lord, having stayed at Thullakotthita
> as long as he wanted, proceeded on his alms pilgrimage towards
> Sravasti, where he took up his abode in Jeta's grove in
> Anathapindika's pleasance.  
>  22. Dwelling alone and aloof, strenuous, ardent ,and purged of
> self, the reverend Ratthapala was not \[there\] long before he won the
> prize in quest of which young men go forth from home to homelessness
> as Bhikkus, that prize of prizes which crowns the highest life.  
>  23. Then he went to the Lord and, seated on one side after
> salutations, said that with the Lord's permission, he wished to go and
> see his parents.  
>  24. Scanning with his own heart the thoughts of Ratthapala's
> heart, and recognizing thereby that he was incapable of abandoning his
> training and reverting to the lower life of a layman, the Lord bade
> him go when he would.  
>  25. Hereupon, rising up and taking his leave of the Lord with deep
> reverence, Ratthapala, after duly putting away his bedding, set out,
> with his robe and bowl, on an alms pilgrimage to Thullakotthita, where
> he took up his abode in the deer-park of the Kuru king.  
>  26. Early next morning, duly robed and bowl in hand, he went into
> the town for alms, and there as he passed from house to house on his
> undiscriminating round, he came to his father's house.  
>  27. Indoors, in the hall within the middle door, his father was
> having his hair combed and, seeing Ratthapala coming in the distance,
> he said, "It was these shavelings of recluses who made Bhikku of my
> only dear and beloved son."  
>  28. So at his own father's house Ratthapala was given nothing, not
> even a refusal; all he got was abuse.  
>  29. At this moment a slave-girl of the family was about to throw
> away the previous day's stale rice; and to her Ratthapala said, "If,
> sister, that is to be thrown away, put it in my bowl here."  
>  30. As the girl was doing so, she recognised his hands and feet
> and voice, and going straight to her mistress, cried out, "Do you
> know, madam, the young master is back."  
>  31. "If what you say is true, you are a slave no longer," said the
> mother, who hurried off to tell her husband that she heard their son
> was back.  
>  32. Ratthapala was eating that stale rice under the hedge when his
> father arrived, exclaiming; "Can it be, my dear son, that you are
> eating stale rice? Should you not have come to your own house?"  
>  33. Said Ratthapala, "What house of our own, householder, can we
> have who are homeless, having gone forth from home to homelessness? I
> did come to your house, where I was given nothing, not even a refusal;
> all I got was abuse."  
>  34. "Come, my son; let us go indoors." "Not so, householder; I
> have finished my eating for today" said Ratthapala.  
>  35. "Well then, my son, promise to take your meal here
> tomorrow."  
>  36. By his silence the reverend Ratthapala gave consent.  
>  37. Then the father went indoors,--where first he ordered great
> heaps of gold and bullion to be piled up under a covering of mats, and
> then he told his daughters-in-law, who had been the reverend
> Ratthapala's wives aforetime, to deck themselves out in all the finery
> their husband liked to see them in.  
>  38. When night had passed, the father, having ordered an excellent
> meal to be got ready in his house, told his son when it was ready.
> Early that forenoon, the reverend Ratthapala, duly robed and bowl in
> hand, came and took the seat set for him.  
>  39. Hereupon, ordering the heap of treasure to be unveiled, the
> father said, "This is your mother's fortune, that is your father's,
> and that came from your grand-father. You have the wherewithal both to
> enjoy yourself and to do good works.  
>  40. "Come, my son, abandon your training; revert to the lower life
> of the layman; enjoy your substance and do good works."  
>  41. "If you will take my advice, householder, you will cart away
> all this heaped-up treasure and sink it in the middle of the Ganges.
> And why? Because thence you will only derive sorrow and lamentation,
> ills, pain of mind, pain of body, and tribulation."  
>  42. Clinging to his feet, the reverend Ratthapala's whilom
> \[=former\] wives asked, like what were the nymphs divine for whose
> sake he was leading the higher life?  
>  43. "For the sake of no nymphs at all, sisters," said he.  
>  44. At hearing themselves called sisters, the ladies all fainted
> and fell to the ground.  
>  45. Said Ratthapala to his father, "If food is to be given,
> householder, give it; trouble me not."  
>  46. "The food is ready, my son; begin," said the father, as he
> served that excellent meal without stint till his son had his fill.  
>  47. After taking food he departed to the deer-park of the Kuru
> king, where he sat down under a tree during the noontide heat.  
>  48. Now the king had given directions to his huntsman to tidy up
> the park against his coming to see it; and the obedient huntsman was
> engaged on his task when he saw Ratthapala seated under a tree during
> the noontide heat, and reported to the king that the park was in.
> order but that under a tree there was seated Ratthapala, the young
> gentleman of whom His Majesty had often heard tell.  
>  49. "Never mind about the park today," said the king; "I will pay
> a call on His Reverence." Ordering, therefore, all the repast which
> had been prepared to be made ready, he mounted a chariot and drove
> forth in procession, in royal state, out of the city to see
> Ratthapala.  
>  50. Riding as far as the ground was passable for his chariot, and
> proceeding thence on foot with his princely train, the king came at
> last upon the reverend Ratthapala, whom, after exchange of courteous
> greetings, the king--still standing--invited to be seated on a clump
> of flowers.  
>  51. "Nay, sire; sit you there, I have got a seat."  
>  52. Seating himself on the seat indicated to him, the king said,
> "There are four kinds of losses, Ratthapala, which impel men to cut
> off hair and beard, don the yellow robes, and go forth from home to
> homelessness--namely, (i) old age, (ii) failing health, (iii)
> impoverishment, and (iv) death of kinsfolk.  
>  53. "Take a man who, being aged and old, far advanced in life,
> stricken in years, and at the close of life, recognises his position,
> and realises the difficulty either of acquiring new wealth or of doing
> well with what he has got; so he decides to take to homelessness. This
> is known as the loss which old age entails. But here are you in the
> prime of youth and early manhood, with a wealth of coal-black hair
> untouched by grey, and in all the beauty of your prime;--not yours is
> the loss old age entails. What have you known or seen or heard, to
> make you take to homelessness?  
>  54. "Or take a man who, being in ill-health or pain, or gravely
> ill, recognises his position and realises the difficulty either of
> acquiring new wealth or doing well with what he has already; so he
> decides to take to homelessness. This is known as the loss which
> failing health entails. But here are you neither ill nor ailing, with
> a good digestion maintained by humours neither too hot nor too cold;
> not yours is the loss which failing health entails. What have you
> known or seen or heard, to make you take to homelessness ?  
>  55. "Or take a man who, after being rich and wealthy and of great
> substance, and after gradually losing it, recognises his, position and
> realises the difficulty either of acquiring new wealth or of doing
> well with what he has got; so he decides to become a pilgrim. This is
> known as the loss which impoverishment entails. But the revered
> Ratthapala is the son of \[a\] leading family in this very
> Thullakotthita, and there is none of this loss of wealth for the
> revered Ratthapala. What has the good Ratthapala known or seen or
> heard, that he has gone forth from home into homelessness?  
>  And what, good Ratthapala, is loss of relations? As to this, good
> Ratthapala, someone has many friends and acquaintances, kith and kin,
> but gradually these relations of his diminish. He reflects thus,
> 'Formerly I had many friends and acquaintances, kith and kin, but
> gradually these relations of mine have diminished, so it is not easy
> for me to acquire wealth etc....' So he that is followed by this loss
> of relations, having cut off hair and beard, having donned saffron
> garments, goes forth from home into homelessness. This is known as the
> loss which kinsfolk's death entails. But here are you with a host of
> friends and relations; not yours is the loss which kinsfolk's death
> entails. What have you known or seen or heard, to make you take to
> homelessness?"  
>  56. "I have gone forth," replied Ratthapala, "sire, from home to
> homelessness because I have known, seen, and heard the following four
> propositions enunciated by the All-Enlightened Lord who knows and
> sees:
>
> > \(i\) The world is in continual flux and change.  
> > (ii) The world has no protector or preserver.  
> > (iii) We own nothing; we must leave everything behind.  
> > (iv) The world lacks and hankers, being enslaved to craving."
>
>  57. "It is wonderful, it is marvellous," said the king, "how right
> in this the Lord was!"
