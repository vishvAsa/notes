**32. Dr. H. Ramarao**

</div>

Thanks for sending the booklet ‘Time for Stock Taking’. I have noted
that the author has shown his utmost concern regarding the
‘Hindu-Muslim’ problem nagging the country even after partition in a new
form, i.e., Secularism vs. Communalism, and the Congress policy of
appeasement of Muslims going on merrily as before with help of its
allies (Communists, Casteists and Communalists) to the detriment of the
Majority community. If the trend is not checked immediately, the country
may go for a few ‘mini’ partitions, to accommodate a few miniature
Pakistans here and there.

Dr. Shreerang Godbole has raised many important questions regarding the
survival of Hindus and Hinduism, and they requires the attention of
everyone who wants to preserve the social, cultural and national
interests of Bharat. Here are my views on the points raised by him.

*1. What is the harm in adding Jesus and Muhammad to the 33 crore Hindu
Gods and Goddesses.*  
Dr. Godbole is right in stating that Islam and Christianity reject all
other Gods except their own, and that there is no sense in adding them
to the Hindu Pantheon. Allah and Jesus Christ won’t tolerate others’
Gods as they reject the belief that all Gods are manifestations of the
one and the only Supreme Being.

*2. All religions (including Islam) lead to God.*  
Yes, this is the view of Hindus as propounded by our preceptors (i.e.,
sages) and expounded in the four Vedas. But the Semitic religions (esp.
Islam and Christianity) reject this view outright and insist that their
religions alone lead to their respective Gods. It is incumbent on their
followers to destroy the ‘other’ Gods, so that the whole world comes
under the spell of their religion (Gods). It is important here to note
that they are not ready to give this ‘right’ of destruction of other
Gods to Kafirs (i.e., Hindus). It is ‘one way traffic’ for others.

*3. Islam is good, but Muslims are bad.*  
Here also, Dr. Godbole is right in saying that Muslims are bad because
of Islam, which teaches its followers to hate other religions, and gives
specific commands to destroy ‘them’, lock, stock and barrel. This is
being taught in all the Madrasas even today, where children are educated
about the ‘important’ aspects of Islam. So when they become adults, they
exhibit this tendency whenever there is a riot, or a procession of a
Hindu deity on the thoroughfares. It is this mindset that makes Muslims
demand a separate state exclusively for their own use, bereft of Kafirs.

*4. If Muslims are told of their common ancestry they will unite with
the Hindus.*  
This is the presumption of Hindu leaders, who are ignorant of KORAN
(holy book of Islam). It is a sort of wishful thinking, a day-dream, a
hallucination.  For Muslims, the pre-Islamic period is a period of
darkness (*Jãhiliya*). The Koran especially asks its followers to sever
all pre-Islamic connections, (i.e., social, cultural, familial,
religious, etc.) and stick to the tenets of Islam (read Koran). Pray,
how many Muslims claim that their ancestors were Hindus and that they
are proud of it? Even the Prophet cursed his parents for not accepting
Islam, and prophesied that they would go to hell.

*5. Congress used Muslims. Congress treats Muslims as vote banks. We
(BJP) will treat them as human beings.*  
Muslims used Congress to achieve their goal (i.e., Pakistan) because
they never considered Bharat as their Motherland’, and had no
compunctions in dividing it. For them, their Motherland (or Fatherland)
was (is) outside Bharat. They behaved as if they were the mercenaries of
Arabia and fought for its religion and culture here. Even now, if it
rains in Arabia (or some other Muslim country), they open their
umbrellas here. They are the paid agents of oil-rich Arabs, and do their
biddings for a pot of gold. So whatever the BJP does for them, does not
bind them a wee bit, and they will not hesitate to cut their fellow
countrymen as they are all Kafirs, fit for elimination from this earth.

*6. Sufis are tolerant Muslims.*  
This is the greatest hoax that is still doing its rounds in this
country. Hindus are gullible, and anybody with a beard and a rosary in
hand suffices for veneration. This is what the Sufis did and the
gullible Hindus prostrated before them seeking their blessings etc.
Actually, they were the clever minstrels of Islam, in the garb of piety,
bhakti etc. to attract the gullible Hindus to their fold. Can anybody
tell of one Sufi who propagated the great truth that all roads lead to
the one and the only Supreme Being, that Ishwar and Allah are the same,
and that there is no necessity for conversion. They were the fiercest
preachers of Islam under the patronage of Muslim kings, and resorted to
largescale conversions and Hindu-baiting. They were the wolves in the
garb of goats.

*7. Muslim leaders are responsible for the ghetto mentality of
Muslims.*  
No. It is Islam that is responsible for this mentality to develop in
Muslims. Islam teaches them to be ‘away’ from ‘Non-Muslims’ (i.e.,
Kafirs - Hindus) in matters of social intercourse, commerce and cultural
activities. Kafirs are a hated lot in the Koran which advises Muslims to
be away from Kafirs and to live in ghettos so that they can show that
they are different from the Kafirs. Why not read the Koran?

*8. Namaz offered in a disputed site (like Ayodhya) is not acceptable to
Allah.*  
This is a misconception. Muslims never bothered about it. Because the
Prophet himself occupied Mecca (a Pagan site till then, with a lot of
idols) after destroying all the idols and then ordered his followers to
offer prayers to Allah. He set a role model for his followers to follow.
The Indian Muslims during the course of a millennium destroyed thousands
of temples (including Somnath, Ayodhya, Mathura and Kashi) and built
mosques and offered prayers. According to the Koran the destruction of
Kafirs’ temples is one of the pious acts that pleases Allah most.

All in all, Islam (so also Christianity) is a predator religion, which
preys on non-Muslims to its heart’s content. How it can be a member of
the Manch is anybody’s guess.

One can come to the conclusion that like Gandhiji (note his monkeys),
the Hindu leaders remain stubbornly ignorant of Islam, and the pity is
that they don’t want to learn even at this late stage. They have only to
open the Koran (and the Bible) and read, and they will understand the
inherent strength of Islam (i.e. hate, intolerance) and its mindset.
