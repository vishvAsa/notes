> § 1. From Kapilavatsu to Rajagraha
>
>  1. Leaving Kapilavatsu, Siddharth Gautama thought of going to
> Rajagraha, the capital of the kingdom of Magadha.  
>  2. The reigning king was Bimbisara. It was a place which great
> philosophers and leaders of thought had made their headquarters.  
>  3. With this thought in mind he crossed the Ganges, fearing not
> her rapid flow.  
>  4. On his way he halted at the hermitage of a Brahmin woman, Saki,
> then at the hermitage of another Brahmin woman, by name Padma, and
> then at the hermitage of the Brahmin sage Raivata. All of them
> entertained him.  
>  5. Having seen his personality and dignity and his splendid
> beauty, surpassing all other men, the people of that region were all
> astonished at him \[=his\] wearing the clothes of a sanyasi.  
>  6. On seeing him, he who was going elsewhere stood still, and he
> who was standing there followed him on the way; he who was walking
> gently and gravely ran quickly, and he who was sitting at once sprang
> up.  
>  7. Some people reverenced him with their hands, others in worship
> saluted him with their heads, some addressed him with affectionate
> words; not one went on without paying him homage.  
>  8. Those who were wearing gay-coloured dresses were ashamed when
> they saw him, those who were talking on random subjects fell to
> silence; no one indulged in an improper thought.  
>  9. His eyebrows, his forehead, his mouth,--his body, his hand, his
> feet, or his gait,--whatever part of him anyone beheld, that at once
> rivetted his gaze.  
>  10. After a long and arduous journey Gautama reached Rajagraha
> surrounded by five hills, well guarded and adorned with mountains, and
> supported and hallowed by auspicious and sacred places.  
>  11. On reaching Rajagraha he selected a spot at the foot of the
> Pandava hill, and put up a small hut made of the leaves of trees for
> his sojourn.  
>  12. Kapilavatsu by foot is nearly 400 miles distant from
> Rajagraha.  
>  13. This long journey Siddharth Gautama did all on foot.
>
>   
> § 2. King Bimbisara and his Advice
>
>  1. Next day he got up and started to go into the city with a
> begging bowl, asking for alms. A vast crowd gathered round him.  
>  2. Then Sreniya Bimbisara, the lord of the kingdom of the
> Magadhas, beheld from the outside of his palace the immense concourse
> of people, and asked the reason of it; and thus did a courtier recount
> it to him:  
>  3. "He who was thus foretold by the Brahmins, 'He will either
> attain supreme wisdom or be the emperor of the earth'--it is he, the
> son of the king of the Sakyas, who is now an ascetic. It is he at whom
> the people are gazing at."  
>  4. The king, having heard this and perceiving its meaning in his
> mind, thus at once spoke to that courtier, "Let it be known whither he
> is going"; and the courtier, receiving the command, followed the
> prince.  
>  5. With fixed eyes, seeing only a yoke's length before him, with
> his voice hushed, and his walk slow and measured, he, the noblest of
> mendicants, went begging for alms, keeping his limbs and his wandering
> thoughts under control.  
>  6. Having received such alms as were offered, he retired to a
> lonely corner of the mountain; and having eaten it there, he ascended
> the Pandava hill.  
>  7. In that wood, thickly filled with *lodhra* trees, having its
> thickness resonant with the notes of the peacocks, he, the sun of
> mankind, shone, wearing his red dress, like the morning sun above the
> eastern mountains.  
>  8. That royal courtier, having thus watched him there, related it
> all to the king; and the king, when he heard it, in his deep
> veneration, started himself to go thither with a modest retinue.  
>  9. Like a mountain in stature, the king ascended the hill.  
>  10. There he beheld Gautama, resplendent as he sat on his hams,
> with subdued senses, as if the mountain was moving, and he himself was
> a peak thereof.  
>  11. Him, distinguished by his beauty of form and perfect
> tranquillity, filled with astonishment and affectionate regard, the
> king of men approached.  
>  12. Bimbisara having courteously drawn nigh to him, inquired as to
> the condition of his bodily humours; and Gautama with equal gentleness
> assured the king of his health of mind and freedom from all
> ailments.  
>  13. Then the king sat down on the clean surface of the rock, and
> being seated, he thus spoke, desiring to convey his state of mind:  
>  14. "I have a strong friendship with thy family, come down by
> inheritance and well proved; since from this, a desire to speak to
> thee, my son, has arisen in me, therefore, listen to my words of
> affection,  
>  15. "When I consider thy race, beginning with the sun, thy fresh
> youth, and thy conspicuous beauty, I wonder whence comes this resolve
> of thine, so out of all harmony with the rest, set wholly on a
> mendicant's life, not on a kingdom?  
>  16. "Thy limbs are worthy of red sandalwood perfumes,--they do not
> deserve the rough contact of red cloth; this hand of thine is fit to
> protect subjects, it deserves not to hold food given by another  
>  17. "If, therefore, gentle youth, thou desirest not thy paternal
> kingdom, then in thy generosity, accept forthwith one half of my
> kingdom.  
>  18. "If thou actest thus, there will be no sorrow caused to thine
> own people, and by the mere lapse of time imperial power at last flies
> for refuge to the tranquil mind; therefore, be pleased to do me this
> kindness. The prosperity of the good becomes very powerful, when aided
> by the good.  
>  19. "But if from thy pride of race thou dost not now feel
> confidence in me, then plunge with thy arrows into countless armies,
> and with me as thy ally seek to conquer thy foes.  
>  20. "Choose thou, therefore, one of these ends. Pursue according
> to the rules of religious merit, wealth, and pleasure; pursue love and
> the rest, in reverse order. These are the three objects in life; when
> men die they pass into dissolution as far as regards this world.  
>  21. "Do thou, therefore, by pursuing the three objects of life,
> cause this personality of thine to bear its fruit; they say that when
> the attainment of religion, wealth and pleasure is complete in all its
> parts, then the end of man is complete.  
>  22. "Do not thou let these two brawny arms lie useless, which are
> worthy to draw the bow; they are well fitted to conquer the three
> worlds, much more the earth.  
>  23. "I speak this to you out of affection,--not through love of
> dominion or through arrogance; beholding this mendicant-dress of
> thine, I am filled with compassion, and I shed tears.  
>  24. "O, thou who desirest the mendicant's stage of life, enjoy
> pleasures now, in due time--ere old age comes on and overcomes this
> thy beauty, well worthy of thy illustrious race.  
>  25. "The old man can obtain merit by religion; old age is helpless
> for the enjoyment of pleasures; therefore, they say that pleasures
> belong to the young man, wealth to the middle-aged, and religion to
> the old.  
>  26. "Youth in this present world is the enemy of religion and
> wealth--since pleasures, however much we guard against them, are hard
> to hold, therefore, wherever pleasures are to be found, there thy
> youth \[should\] seize them.  
>  27. "Old age is prone to reflection, it is grave and intent on
> remaining quiet; it attains unimpassionedness with but little effort,
> unavoidably, and for very shame.  
>  28. "Therefore, having passed through the deceptive period of
> youth, fickle, intent on external objects, heedless, impatient, not
> looking at the distance,--they take breath like men who have escaped
> safe through a forest.  
>  29. "Let, therefore, this fickle time of youth first pass by,
> reckless and giddy,--our early years are earmarked for pleasure, they
> cannot be kept from the power of the senses.  
>  30. "Or, if religion is really thy one aim, then offer
> sacrifices,--this is thy family's immemorial custom, climbing to
> highest heaven by sacrifices.  
>  31. "With their arms pressed by golden bracelets, and their
> variegated diadems resplendent with the light of gems, royal sages
> have reached the same goal by sacrifice which great sages reached by
> self-mortification."
>
>   
> § 3. Gautama Answers Bimbisara
>
>  1. Thus spoke the monarch of the Magadhas, who spoke well and
> strongly like Indra; but having heard it, the prince did not falter.
> He was firm like a mountain.  
>  2. Being thus addressed by the monarch of the Magadhas, Gautama,
> in a strong speech with friendly face,--self-possessed, unchanged,
> thus made answer:  
>  3. "What you have said is not to be called a strange thing for
> thee. O King! Born as thou art in the great family whose ensign is the
> lion, and lover as thou art of thy friends, that ye should adopt this
> line of approach towards him who stands as one of thy friends is only
> natural.  
>  4. "Amongst the evil-minded, a friendship worthy of their family
> ceases to continue, and fades; it is only the good who keep increasing
> the old friendship of their ancestors by a new succession of friendly
> acts.  
>  5. "But those men who act unchangingly towards their friends in
> reverses of fortune, I esteem in my heart as true friends. Who is not
> the friend of the prosperous man, in his times of abundance?  
>  6. "So those who, having obtained riches in the world, employ them
> for the sake of their friends and religions,--their wealth has real
> solidity, and when it perishes it produces no pain at the end.  
>  7. "This thy suggestion concerning me, O King, is prompted by pure
> generosity and friendship; I will meet thee courteously with simple
> friendship, I would not utter aught else in my reply.  
>  8. "I am not so afraid even of serpents nor of thunderbolts
> falling from heaven, nor of flames blown together by the wind, as I am
> afraid of these worldly objects.  
>  9. "These transient pleasures,--the robbers of our happiness and
> our wealth, and which float empty and like illusions through the
> world,--infatuate man's minds even when they are only hoped
> for,--still more when they take up their abode in the soul.  
>  10. "The victims of pleasure attain not to happiness even in the
> heaven of the gods, still less in the world of mortals; he who is
> athirst is never satisfied with pleasures, as the fire, the friend of
> the wind, with fuel.  
>  11. "There is no calamity in the world like pleasures, people are
> devoted to them through delusion; when he once knows the truth and so
> fears evil, what wise man would of his own choice desire evil?  
>  12. "When they have obtained all the earth girdled by the sea,
> kings wish to conquer the other side of the great ocean; mankind is
> never satiated with pleasures, as the ocean with the waters that fall
> into it.  
>  13, "When it had rained a golden shower from heaven, and when he
> had conquered the continents and had even obtained the half of Sakra's
> throne, Mandhatri was still full of craving for worldly objects.  
>  14. "Though he enjoyed the kingdom of the gods in heaven, when
> Indra had concealed himself through fear of Vritra, and though in his
> pride he had made the great Rishis bear his litter, Nahusha was not
> satisfied.  
>  15. "Who would seek these enemies bearing the name of pleasures,
> by whom even those sages have been overcome, who were devoted to other
> pursuits, whose only clothes were rags, whose food roots, fruits, and
> water, and who wear their twisted locks as long as snakes  
>  16. "When they hear of the miseries of those who are intent on
> pleasure and are devoted to worldly pursuits, it well befits the
> self-controlled to fling it away.  
>  17. "Success in pleasure is to be considered a misery in the man
> of pleasure, for he becomes intoxicated when the pleasures of his
> desire are attained; through intoxication he does what should not be
> done, not what should be done ; and being wounded thereby he falls
> into a miserable end.  
>  18. "These pleasures which are gained and kept by toil, which
> after deceiving leave you and return whence they came,--these
> pleasures which are but borrowed for a time,--what man of
> self-control, if he is wise, would delight in them?  
>  19. "What man of self-control could find satisfaction in these
> pleasures which are like a torch of hay,--which excite thirst when you
> seek them and when you grasp them?  
>  20. "What man of self-control could find satisfaction in these
> pleasures which are like flesh that has been flung away, and which
> produces \[=produce\] misery by their being held in common with
> kings?  
>  21. "What man of self-control could find satisfaction in these
> pleasures, which, like the senses, are destructive, which bring
> calamity on every hand to those who abide in them?  
>  22. "Those men of self-control who are bitten by them in their
> hearts, fall into ruin and attain not bliss--what man of self-control
> could find satisfaction in these pleasures, which are like an angry,
> cruel serpent?  
>  23. "Even if they enjoy them men are not satisfied,--like dogs
> famishing with hunger over a bone--what man of self control could find
> satisfaction in these pleasures, which are like a skeleton composed of
> dry bones?  
>  24. "He whose intellect is blinded with pleasures, the wretch who
> is the miserable slave of hope for the sake of pleasures, well
> deserves the pain of death even in the world of living.  
>  25. "Deer are lured to their destruction by songs, insects for the
> sake of the brightness fly into the fire, the fish greedy for the
> flesh swallows the iron hook,--therefore, worldly pleasures produce
> misery as their end.  
>  26. "As for the common opinion, 'pleasures are enjoyment', none of
> them when examined are worthy of being enjoyed; fine garments and the
> rest are only the accessories of things,--they are to be regarded as
> merely the remedies for pain.  
>  27. "Water is desired for allaying thirst; food in the same way
> for removing hunger; a house for keeping off the wind, the heat of the
> sun, and the rain; and dress for keeping off the cold and to cover
> one's nakedness.  
>  28. "So too a bed is for removing drowsiness; a carriage for
> remedying the fatigue of a journey; a seat for alleviating the pain of
> standing; so bathing as \[=is\] a means for washing, health, and
> strength.  
>  29. "External objects therefore are to human beings means for
> remedying pain--not in themselves sources of enjoyment; what wise man
> would allow that he enjoys those delights which are only used as
> remedial?  
>  30. "He who, when burned with the heat of bilious fever, maintains
> that cold appliances are an enjoyment, when he is only engaged in
> alleviating pain,--he indeed might give the name of enjoyment to
> pleasures.  
>  31. "Since variableness is found in all pleasures, I cannot apply
> to them the name of enjoyment; the very conditions which mark
> pleasure, bring also in their turn pain.  
>  32. "Heavy garments and fragrant aloe-wood are pleasant in the
> cold, but an annoyance in the heat; and the moonbeams and sandalwood
> are pleasant in the heat, but a pain in the cold.  
>  33. "Since the well-known opposite pairs, such as gain and loss
> and the rest, are inseparably connected with everything in this
> world,--therefore, no man is invariably happy on the earth, nor
> invariably wretched.  
>  34. "When I see how the nature of pleasure and pain are mixed, I
> consider royalty and slavery as the same; a king does not always
> smile, nor is a slave always in pain.  
>  35. "Since to be a king involves a wider range of responsibility,
> therefore the sorrows of a king are great; for a king is like a
> peg,--he endures trouble for the sake of the world.  
>  36. "A king is unfortunate, if he places his trust in his royalty
> which is apt to desert, and loves crooked turns; and, on the other
> hand, if he does not trust in it, then what can be the happiness of a
> timid king?  
>  37. "And since after even conquering the whole earth, one city
> only can serve as a dwelling place, and even there only one house can
> be inhabited, is not royalty mere labour for others?  
>  38. "And even in royalty nothing more than one pair of garments is
> all he needs, and just enough food to keep off hunger; so only one
> bed, and only one seat is all that a king needs; other distinctions
> are only for pride.  
>  39. "And if all these fruits are desired for the sake of
> satisfaction, I can be satisfied without a kingdom; and if a man is
> once satisfied in this world, are not all distinctions unnecessary?  
>  40. "He then who has attained the auspicious road to happiness is
> not to be deceived in regard to pleasures. Remembering thy professed
> friendship, I ask, tell me again and again, are the pleasures worth
> anything?  
>  41. "I have not left home through anger, nor because my diadem has
> been dashed down by an enemy's arrow; nor have I set my desires on
> loftier objects, that I thus refuse thy proposal.  
>  42. "Only he who, having once let go a malignant, incensed
> serpent, or a blazing hay-torch all on fire, would strive again to
> seize it, would ever seek pleasures again after having once abandoned
> them.  
>  43. "Only he who, though seeing, would envy the blind; though
> free, the bound; though wealthy, the destitute; though sound in his
> reason, the maniac--only he, I say, would envy one who is devoted to
> wordly objects.  
>  44. "He who lives on alms, my good friend, is not to be pitied. He
> has here the best happiness, perfect calm, and hereafter all sorrows
> are for him abolished.  
>  45. "But he is to be pitied who is overpowered by craving though
> in the midst of great wealth,--who attains not the happiness of calm
> here, while pain has to be experienced hereafter.  
>  46. "What thou has spoken to me is well worthy of thy character,
> thy mode of life, and thy family; and to carry out my resolve is also
> befitting my character, my mode of life, and my family."
>
>   
> § 4. Reply by Gautama (concluded)
>
>  1. "I have been wounded by the strife of the world, and I have
> come out longing to obtain peace; I would not accept any empire in the
> third heaven, for saving me from all the ills of the earth; how much
> less amongst men?  
>  2. "But as for what thou has said to me, O King, that the
> universal pursuit of the three objects is the supreme end of man,--and
> thou saidst that what I regard as the desirable is misery,--thy three
> objects are perishable and also unsatisfying.  
>  3. "And as for what thou saidst, 'wait till old age comes, for
> youth is ever subject to change';--this want of decision is itself
> uncertain; for age too can be irresolute and youth can be firm.  
>  4. "But since Fate is so well skilled in its art as to draw the
> world in all its various ages into its power,--how shall the wise man,
> who desires tranquillity, wait for old age, when he knows not when the
> time of death will be?  
>  5. "When death stands ready like a hunter, with old age as his
> weapon, and diseases scattered about as his arrows, smiting down
> living creatures who fly like deer to the forest of destiny, what
> desire can there be in anyone for length of life?  
>  6. "It well befits the youthful son or the old man or the child so
> to act with all promptitude, that they may choose the path of the
> religious man whose soul is all mercy.  
>  7. "And as for what thou saidst, be diligent in sacrifices for
> religion, such as are worthy of thy race and bring a glorious
> fruit',--honour to such sacrifices! I desire not that fruit which is
> sought by causing pain to others!  
>  8. "To kill a helpless victim through a wish for future
> reward,--it would be unseemly action for a merciful, good-hearted man,
> even if the reward of the sacrifice were eternal.  
>  9. "And even if true religion did not consist in quite another
> rule of conduct, by self-restraint, moral practice and a total absence
> of passion,--still it would not be seemly to follow the rule of
> sacrifice, where the highest reward is described as attained only by
> slaughter.  
>  10. "Even that happiness which comes to a man while he stays in
> this world, through the injury of another, is hateful to the wise
> compassionate heart; how much more if it be something beyond our sight
> in another life?  
>  11. "I am not to be lured into a course of action for future
> reward,--my mind does not delight, O King, in future births; these
> actions are uncertain and wavering in their direction, like plants
> beaten by the rain from a cloud."  
>  12. The king himself, folding his hands, replied, "Thou art
> obtaining thy desire without hindrance; when thou has at last
> accomplished all that thou has to do, thou shall show hereafter thy
> favour towards me."  
>  13. Having received a firm promise from Gautama to visit him
> again, the monarch, taking his courtiers with him, returned to the
> palace.
>
>   
> § 5. News of Peace
>
>  1. While Gautama was staying in Rajagraha there came five other
> Parivrajakas, who also put up a hut by the side of the hut which
> Gautama had erected for himself.  
>  2. These five Parivrajakas were Kaundinya, Ashvajit, Kasyapa,
> Mahanam, and Bhaduka.  
>  3. They too were struck by Gautama's appearance, and wondered what
> could have led him to take Parivraja.  
>  4. They questioned him over the issue in the same way as did King
> Bimbisara.  
>  5. When he explained to them the circumstances which led him to
> take Parivraja, they said, "We have heard of it. But do you know what
> has happened since you left?" they asked.  
>  6. Siddharth said, "No." Then they told him that after he left
> Kapilavatsu, there was a great agitation among the Sakyas against
> going to war with the Koliyas.  
>  7. There were demonstrations and processions by men and women,
> boys and girls, carrying flags with such slogans as, "Koliyas are our
> brothers," "It is wrong for a brother to fight against brother."
> "Think of the exile of Siddharth Gautama," etc.  
>  8. The result of the agitation was that the Sakya Sangh had to
> call a meeting and reconsider the question. This time the majority was
> for compromise with the Koliyas.  
>  9. The Sangh decided to select five Sakyas to act as their envoys
> and negotiate peace with the Koliyas.  
>  10. When the Koliyas heard of this they were very glad. They too
> selected five Koliyas to deal with the envoys of the Sakyas.  
>  11. The envoys on the two sides met and agreed to appoint a
> permanent Council of Arbitration, with authority to settle every
> dispute regarding the sharing of the waters of the river Rohini, and
> both sides to abide by its decision. Thus the threatened war had ended
> in peace.  
>  12. After informing Gautama of what had happened at Kapilavatsu,
> the Parivrajakas said, "There is now no need for you to continue to be
> a Parivrajaka. Why don't you go home and join your family?"  
>  13. Siddharth said, "I am happy to have this good news. It is a
> triumph for me. But I will not go back to my home. I must not. I must
> continue to be a Parivrajaka."  
>  14. Gautama asked the five Parivrajakas what their programme was.
> They replied, "We have decided to do *tapasya*. Why don't you join
> us?" Siddharth said, "By and b ; I must examine other ways first."  
>  15. The five Parivrajakas then left.
>
>   
> § 6. The Problem in a New Perspective
>
>  1. The news brought by the five Parivrajakas that the Koliyas and
> Sakyas had made peace, made Gautama very uneasy.  
>  2. Left alone, he began to reflect on his own position, and to
> make sure if any reason was left for him to continue his Parivraja.  
>  3. He had left his people for what?, he asked himself.  
>  4. He had left his home because he was opposed to war. "Now that
> the war is over, is there any problem left to me? Does my problem end
> because war has ended?"  
>  5. On a deep reflection, he thought not.  
>  6. "The problem of war is essentially a problem of conflict. It is
> only a part of a larger problem.  
>  7. "This conflict is going on not only between kings and nations,
> but between nobles and Brahmins, between householders, between mother
> and son, between son and mother, between father and son, between
> sister and brother, between companion and companion.  
>  8. "The conflict between nations is occasional. But the conflict
> between classes is constant and perpetual. It is this which is the
> root of all sorrow and suffering in the world.  
>  9. "True, I left home on account of war. But I cannot go back
> home, although the war between the Sakyas and Koliyas has ended. I see
> now that my problem has become wider. I have to find a solution for
> this problem of social conflict.  
>  10. "How far do the old-established philosophies offer a solution
> of this problem?”  
>  11. Can \[=Could\] he accept any one of the social philosophies?  
>  12. He was determined to examine everything for himself.
