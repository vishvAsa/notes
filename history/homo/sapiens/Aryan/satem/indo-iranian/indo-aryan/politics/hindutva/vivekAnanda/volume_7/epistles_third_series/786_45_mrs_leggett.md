## XLV

CHICAGO,  
*26th Nov*.*, 1899*.

MY DEAR MRS. LEGGETT,

Many, many thanks for all your kindness and especially the kind note. I
am going to start from Chicago on Thursday next, and got the ticket and
berth ready for that day.

Miss Noble is doing very well here, and working her way out. I saw
Alberta the other day. She is enjoying every minute of her stay here and
is very happy. Miss Adams (Jane Adams), as ever is an angel.

I shall wire to Joe Joe before I start and read all night.

With all love to Mr. Leggett and yourself,

Ever yours affectionately,

VIVEKANANDA.
