Swatantryaveer Savarkar needs no introduction to the
Indian public, neither does his biography. Long ago, Mr. Asaf
Ali described Savarkar as the spirit of Shivaji and the late
Sri Srinivas Sastri said of him that “ he was a great and fear-
less patriot and volumes could be written about his yeoman
services in the cause of Indian Freedom.” This is, however,
too small a volume to describe that spirit and those services
adequately.

Savarkar’s life has already appeared in almost all Indian
languages, and in his twenties it has appeared in almost all
European languages. But excepting the great Marathi bio-
graphy by Sri S. L. Karandikar, who wrote it about seven
years ago, no book has dealt exhaustively with the various
facets of his life. Hence this is a humble attempt to give in
detail the myriad sides of Savarkar’s life in its proper historic
perspective. This book provides a fuller survey of Savarkar’s
revolutionary, literary, political and social activities and
movements. It also deals with his personal life, and covers
his life upto the present moment.

I have made a faithful attempt to present a true and correct
picture of the various events and incidents that occurred in
the life of Savarkar, and also the trends of thoughts and
opinions entertained in those times. Most of them do not
necessarily reflect my personal views. But they are narrated
to record matters of mere history. To quote Sir Edmund
Gosse, I have attempted ‘ to give a faithful portrait of a soul
in its adventures through life \

Savarkar^s life is romantic, epic and volcanic and so it is
full of flashes and flames. Bharat has just shed her revolu-
tionary shell, and entered an evolutionary phase. And a
revolutionary realist as he is, Savarkar now in Free India
naturally insists on the adoption of peaceful, constitutional
and democratic means by the people for attaining their
objectives. This was only a logical corollary to Savarkar s ideal
as proclaimed in his historic work on ‘ 1857 ^

My earnest appeal, therefore, to all lovers of Indian Free-
dom and true democracy is that they should go through this
book dispassionately and in a rationalistic manner and know
exactly the real Savarkar. And if the book helps them know
the real Savarkar, I shall feel glad that the object of writing
this book is fulfilled.

My debt of gratitude is gladly acknowledged to all those
who read and scrutinised the manuscript and made valuable
suggestions, and particularly to those who constantly
encouraged me, but whose names I omit for obvious reasons.

I also gratefully acknowledge my debt to the various authors,
journals and publications from whom I have drawn excerpts.
Lastly, my special thanks are due to Messrs. India Printing
Works, for their prompt execution and exquisite printing of
this work.
