## CXI

WIMBLEDON,  
*8th October, 1896*.

DEAR MRS. BULL,

. . . I met in Germany Prof. Deussen. I was his guest at Kiel and we
travelled together to London and had some very pleasant meetings here. .
. . Although I am in full sympathy with the various branches of
religious and social work, I find that specification of work is
absolutely necessary. Our special branch is to preach Vedanta. Helping
in other work should be subservient to that one ideal. I hope you will
inculcate this in the mind of Saradananda very strongly.

Did you read Max MÃ¼ller's article on Ramakrishna? . . . Things are
working very favourably here in England. The work is not only popular
but appreciated. 

Yours affly.,

VIVEKANANDA.
