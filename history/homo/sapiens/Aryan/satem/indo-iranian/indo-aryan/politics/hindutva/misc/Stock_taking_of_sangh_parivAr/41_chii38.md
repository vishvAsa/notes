This is with reference to the pamphlet “Time For Stock Taking: A
Swayamsevak Speaks” published by **Voice of India**. Myself and many
others who read it are appalled to learn that R.S.S. leaders have
floated a “Sarva Panth Samãdar Manch” which includes, in the definition
of panth, religions other than the Sanatan Dharma sects, such as Islam
and Christianity, whose fundamentalist and regimented beliefs are
diametrically opposed to the spiritual democracy of Hindu Dharma. It is
all the more shocking for a person like me who has been a devoted
Swayamsevak since 1943 and has boldly faced the adverse situations even
at the risk of my job etc. during the Emergency. Departure from the
basic principles of the Sangh has come as a bolt from the blue.

I joined the R.S.S. in 1943 after thoroughly studying the book “We or
Our Nationhood Defined” by Swargiya Guruji Shri M.S. Golwalkar, wherein
he has defined Dharma to be an essential constituent of a nation. It has
been ingrained in our psychology through the R.S.S. teaching that
“Hindustan (undivided) belongs to Hindus even if a single Hindu is
there”.

The distinction between “liberal Muslims” and “fundamentalist Muslims”
is imaginary. One has to believe in the Quran and the Hadis without any
question or reasoning, otherwise one is a kafir to be condemned to death
and consigned to hellfire in perpetuity. As per tenets of Islam, there
can be no friendship and coexistence with kafirs (except for strategic
reasons). This is what the teachings of the Quran and the Hadis and the
life of the prophet Mohammed contain. The prayer call (*azan*) given
from all mosques on loud speakers five times a day is, in fact, a
repeated announcement of war to be unleashed on other religions. In his
prayer (*namaz*) five times a day, every Muslim vows not to have
relations with the non-Muslims and prays for perpetration of atrocities
on them.

The Hindu Samaj has been looking forward to the R.S.S. for inspiration
and guidance to steer the Samaj out of its difficulties and to prepare
it for facing and defeating the adverse and hostile forces. For
secularism and the spirit of co-existence to be meaningful, genuine and
a matter of principle rather than a matter of expedient policy and
tactics, it is essential to have interaction and free debate with these
religions. To achieve this purpose, it is imperative to have a thorough
knowledge of the teaching of the Quran and the Hadis, the life of
prophet Mohammed, Islamic history since the inception of Islam
throughout the globe, and the behavioural psychology of Muslims
vis-à-vis non Muslims. Some of the contrasting features of Sanatan
Dharma on the one hand and Islam on the other hand are as under:

> 1\. *Sanatan Dharma*. Believes in the worship of the idols of gods and
> goddesses.  
> *Islam*. Mandatory and pious duty of Muslims to break the idols and
> destroy temples. (Even if Muslims call themselves Mohammadi Hindus,
> their attitude towards Sanatan Dharma is not going to change.)
>
> 2\. *Sanatan*. India is worshipped as a mother.  
> *Islam*. Non-Muslim state is a Dar-ul Harb.
>
> 3\. *Sanatan*. India is a sacred land.  
> *Islam*. India is Bhog Bhoomi till converted to Dar-ul-Islam and all
> traces of *kufr* and *jahaliya* prior to the advent of Islam are
> removed.
>
> 4\. *Sanatan*. Everybody accepts that another man’s wife is like a
> mother.  
> *Islam*. “We have made lawful unto thee whom thy right hand
> possessesth of those whom Allah hath given thee as spoil of war”
> (Quran, 33:50)
>
> (Sarva Panth Samãdar will mean equal respect for a son-in-law and a
> rapist.)
>
> 5\. *Sanatan*. Essence of Dharma is truth, rationalism and reasoning.
> Hindus are tolerant because of it.  
> *Islam*. Essence of Dîn is belief. Reasoning or questioning the
> revelations is *kufr*.
>
> 6\. *Sanatan*. Believes in “live and let live” and in harmony with
> nature. The Earth is the mother.  
> *Islam* Believes in “live, but do not let live”. All nature and animal
> world is for the consumption of *momins*.
>
> 7\. *Sanatan*. Believes in “vasudhaiva kutumbakam”.  
> *Islam*. Muslims alone are the inheritors of the whole world. Do not
> trust and make friends with non-Muslims.
>
> 8\. *Sanatan*. Bharat is a nation since times immemorial.  
> *Islam*. Does not believe in confining Muslims to any national
> boundary.
>
> 9\. *Sanatan*. Considers foreign invaders as enemies.  
> *Islam*. Muslim invaders are welcome. They are heroes and liberators.
>
> 10\. *Sanatan*. It is inhuman and barbarous to convert people of other
> faiths by the sword.  
> *Islam*. It is the God-ordained duty of Muslims to convert others by
> the sword. They are grateful to those who put their ancestors to the
> sword or converted them to Islam – “making them men from the worst of
> animals”.
>
> 11\. *Sanatan*. All languages with a national base are national
> languages.  
> *Islam*. Only a language with an Arabic or Persian base and written in
> Arabic or Persian script is acceptable.
>
> 12\. *Sanatan*. The prayer is “sarve bhavantu sukhinah”.  
> *Islam*. Namaz is for Moking atrocities on non-Muslims and vows not to
> co-exist with them.

The real service to the Hindu Samaj is to prepare it to defeat Islam
which is bent upon annihilating Sanatan Dharma. First step will be to
identify the danger, the enemy, his ideology, inspiration, strategy,
history, and his behaviour pattern. For this a vast literature is
required. Hindu writers and intellectuals should be honoured, supported
and protected. It is heartening that **Voice of India** is championing
this cause. If this literature reaches every Hindu, it will
automatically infuse a spirit of sacrifice and unity in the Samaj. The
knowledge of a common danger is a great uniting force. Hindu Samaj
should blunt the aggressiveness of the bully through ideological war so
that he can be made to recoil, and becomes defensive and apologetic. In
my considered opinion, Hindu organisations should take up this cause.
