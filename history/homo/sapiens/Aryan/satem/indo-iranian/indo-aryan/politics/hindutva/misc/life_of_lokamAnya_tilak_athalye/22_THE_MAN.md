T IKE his literary career, Mr. Tilak's private life was 
almost absorbed into his political existence and it 
serves but to enhance the charm of his magnetic per- 
sonality and romantic career ; and yet, considered even 
separately, that private life, lived in the full blaze of 
publicity, will serve as a model for all those who consider 
self-introspection and self-elevation as the principle 
duty of life. Charles Stuart Parnell is reported to have 
said in one of his moments of infatuation that his pub- 
lic life belonged to his country and that his private life 
was his own. Mr. Tilak made no such distinction and his 
public career was only the logical outcome of those qua- 
lities of the heart, which have been over and over test- 
ed in his private life. Excepting what have been sent 
bv the cold hand of Death, no cloud has marred the 
sunshine of his domestic felicity. His wife, calm, active 
and devoted, without the least touch of the modern wo- 
man in her, made his private life perfectly happy to 
him. She bore him six children,~three sons and three 
daughters, the latter all married — and died on 6th June 
1912, while Mr. Tilak was at Mandalay. His eldest son 



THE MAN 317 

Vishwanath was cut off in the prime of his life. Sur- 
rounded by a large family of children, grand-children 
and other near relatives, trusted by numerous friends 
and followed by the majority of his countrymen, with 
his purse, long or short, always at the disposal of the 
the needy and his time all given up to reading, writing, 
thinking, working for the country, Mr. Tilak may be 
said to have passed a singularly enviable life. 

To a superficial observer, Mr. Tilak's personality apv- 
peared to be an extremely simple one for analysis ; but 
really it was extremely complex. "WTiat struck careful 
observers was the harmonious combination of appa- 
rently contradictory quahties. He was daring but 
cautious, simple but astute, fiery but quiet. An ex- 
tremely social man, none revelled more in solitude. 
An idealist by nature, he trained himself to a perfect 
realisation of practical limitations. Though stem, he 
was kind-hearted. He dehghted in conflicts, but he 
was by nature averse to them. He seemed resentful 
and implacable, but was always the first to conci- 
liate and compromise ; and though plain and blunt in 
his talk and dealings, he has often suffered on account 
of that refined reserve which is the highest mark of 
nobility and culture. 

Of those softer graces of fife, which are the reward 
of the pursuit of the fine arts or fashionable games, he 
was totally devoid. He never cultivated music, vocal 
or instrumental, though, of course, he encouraged it in 
the annual public festivals, instituted by him in honour 
of the god Ganesh. He suffered himself to be occasion- 
ally taken to dramas, but he considered it all to be a 
waste of time. He detested cards and was indifferent 



5l8 LOKAMANYA TILAK 

to chess. He never handled a bat. All these accom- 
plishments were antagonistic to his nature. We know 
how Mazzini did not consider himself to be free to indulge 
in his natural taste for music, painting and poetry ; we 
are not, therefore, surprised to find Mr. Tilak neglecting 
them. He lacked not only the time but the necessary 
inclination also. 

He rarely stood in need of physical recreation ; and 
when he wanted rest, he repaired to his favourite sana- 
torium Sinhgad and there spent three or four hours 
daily in long morning walks, in swimming and in Indian 
gymnastics. Latterly, when the strain of public work 
and the exhaustion due to diabetes worried him, he was 
required to take longer spells of rest there. 

As regards mental recreation, he had it in the diversi- 
fied pursuit of knowledge. The immense vitality of his 
brain, his powers of endurance, coupled with his in- 
terests in the various branches of learning, enabled him 
to relax hs mind by going from one subject to anothe r, 
from politics to metaphysics, thence to science or law 
or mathematics. When extremely tired, he used to 
amuse himself with his favourite book — the Maha- 
Bharat. The distractions of his political career and the 
worries of public and private persecutions which tor- 
mented him till the last, only confirmed his love of 
learning and scholarship and indeed, the happiest and 
proudest moments of his Hfe were those, when delibe- 
rately laying aside the burden of his anxieties, he flew 
to literature and philosophy with the eagerness that 
bespoke his preference. 

Mr. Tilak, however, was not the master of his time 
and his philosophical or political meditations were daily 



THE MAN 319 

interrupted by numerous callers, who visited him at 
any hour of the day. Many have blamed him for thus 
encouraging boredom and idle curiosity ; and to a cer- 
tain extent they were right ; for accessibihty to people 
at all times is not the necessary condition of democratic 
leadership. We know how in Greece, Pericles, the leader 
of the people was generally reserved, while his 
opponent, though the leader of the Aristocratic 
party was always accessible to the general public. 
Mr. Tilak seems to have kept as his models, the Tri- 
bunes of the Roman history, and like them, his doors 
were open for all visitors at any time. Infant de- 
mocracy is impatient of the restraints which method 
and economy of time should impose upon the people in 
their dealings with the leaders. Mr. Tilak utilised this 
' waste of time * in gauging the view point of the public 
and in selecting and training men for his work. Be- 
sides, hke the Swami Vivekanand, he had developed 
the faculty of " thinking aloud *' and while others con- 
sidered him as merely frittering his time and energies, 
he really was building up the chains of his arguments. 

It was only in such conversations, that the real Tilak 
was seen. His writings were severely logical and the 
element of fun that was introduced therein took too 
often the form of a satirical outburst or derisive laughters 
His informal conversations, however, were full of hon 
mots and the irrepressible gaity of his nature was in 
frequent evidence. It was a delight to hear Mr. Tilak 
with his pohtical armour laid aside, talking just like 
common people and yet with a certain insight and 
grandeur which made you realise the companionship of 
a great man. It was evident that this simple mood 



320 LOKAMANYA TILAK 

would not last long but must give place to the ' politica 
gladiator/ literary giant or subtle philospher and meta- 
physician. He glided into these moods almost imper- 
ceptibly and it was some time before his hearers 
were conscious of the deep waters they were taken 
into. 

His heart was as great as head. He was a great 
giver ' and his pity gave ere charity began '. If there 
was any place where his astuteness did not work, it was 
this ; and naturally this ' weakness ' — if a weakness it 
really is — was availed of by many. He gave not for 
name but because he must ; nor was money the only 
thing he gave. For one full generation, he gave free 
legal advice to all who sought it. Rich men and poor, 
the high and the low, learned men and the illiterate—all 
have been benefitted by his legal knowledge and he 
wrote and even arranged to send the petitions of many 
of his poor countrymen. Another man in his place 
would have made a fortune upon his knowledge of law, 
but with his characteristic contempt for money, Mr. 
Tilak not only never demanded fees but actually re- 
fused them when gratefully offered ; and all this not- 
withstanding money difiiculties, which, owing to the 
Tai Maharaj case, haunted him till the last. 

It was a privilege to have Mr. Tilak as your friend ; 
for then you could sleep over your difficulties in the 
secure knowledge that your affairs would be taken care 
of. A host of instances will illustrate this point ; we 
will refer to only two. (The late) Rao Saheb Bapat, 
Settlement officer of Baroda was charged with corrup- 
tion and was tried in 1894 by a Special Commission. 
" The case arose out of a conspiracy against the Settle- 



THE MAN 321 

ment Department, which was practically headed by 
the British Political Department ; and Mr. Bapat's 
trial had certain special features of interest in as much 
as it was timed to be held behind the back of the Maha- 
raja who was then on a tour in Europe, and the revela- 
tions in the trial were expected by the enemies of the 
Maharaja to cast a damaging slur on at least one aspect 
of his administration." Mr. Tilak gave Mr. Bapat the 
better part of one year and successfully fought out his 
case. To the well-known Tai Maharaj affairs he gave 
at least eighteen years of his busy life. In the earlier 
stages of the case, there were so many occasions when 
he could have conveniently given up his interest in the 
posthmus affairs of one of his dearest friends ; but he 
was not the man to shirk off responsibility once he had 
pledged his word to his friend and he fought the case 
out to the bitter end, ultimately triumphing over his 
enemies. 

Chivalry of nature was responsible for many of 
his side-activities ; e.g. in the notorious Crawford 
case, Mr Tilak championed the cause of tlie dismissed 
Mamlatdars and succeeded in inducing the Government 
to grant them pensions when the arch-offender was 
given the same. In fact, chivalry was the bedrock 
of Mr. Tilak's character and his very entry into the 
public life of the country to the neglect of scholarly 
studies and financial prospects, is very largely due to 
this sense, which will not passively endure the sight of 
the sufferings and hardships of others. 

To his comtemporaries, Mr. Tilak appealed most as 
a courageous man — a soldier. Other aspects of his 
personality, striking as they are, only recede in the 
21 



322 LOKAMANYA TILAK 

back-ground when compared wirh his courage. Mis- 
fortunes never disheartened him. His immense optimism, 
his readiness to sacrifice, his coolness and resourceful- 
ness of mind, were but different manifestations of his 
courage. More than once, he has cheerfully left the 
sick-bed of his sons at the call of the country. The 
premature death of his eldest son gave him a shock. 
But only the nearest and most observant persons could 
mark its effect. In his last illness, after recovering 
consciousness which he had lost for over 20 hours, 
almost the first assurance he gave was " away with 
anxiety ! certainly, I am not going to die. Now I will 
still live." When arrested in 1897, he was found sleep- 
ing soundly within an hour of his arrest. In 1908, soon 
after the sentence of six years' transportation was pro- 
nounced, he could command courage and mental peace 
enough to get good sleep. In 1903 when his very 
honesty of purpose was at stake, he had serenity of 
mind not only to follow his usual avocations, but 
also to complete his Arctic Home in the Vedas. 

In his dealings with his opponents, he appeared rather 
hard and unrelenting ; who will forget the almost per- 
petual fights in which he was engaged with Gopal 
Ganesh Agarkar, the friend of his youth ? Who will 
forget the hard hits given by Agarkar, hits returned 
with interest ? But when Agarkar was on his death- 
bed, Mr. Tilak ran to his side and the last and pathetic 
reconciliation was brought about in a torrent of tears. 
Even till the last, Mr. Tilak feelingly referred to Mr. 
Agarkar, and many have seen him weep over the past 
memories. Next to Agarkar he loved Ranade and next to 
him Mr. Gokhale. Jealousy was foreign to Mr. Tilak's 



THE MAN 323 

nature, and this has been shown by his freqnent public 
appreciation of his opponents. A conspicuous instance in 
point is the address which he presented to Mr. Gokhale in 
1905, on the latter's return from England. 

This placability towards opponents is an evidence of 
a brave and candid spirit — of true Kshatriya qualities. 
In Mr. Tilak's case, these qualities were shown to ad- 
vantage by BraJimanic lustre,— simplicity, purity and the 
spirit of renunciation. His dress, diet, habits — every- 
thing was simplicity incarnate. He never allowed him- 
self to be caught in the demoralizaing snare of luxury. 
Mr. Tilak's purity of life, publicly acknowledged by men 
like Sir Valentine Chirol was the keystone of his 
character. He was virtuous not by effort but by 
instinct. 

In the earl}^ part of his career he was considered to 
be extremely obstinate, fanatical and reckless. From 
the very first his greatness was recognised by a section 
of the educated class and by the people at large who 
instinctively looked upon him as their leader. The 
tide of j.^opularity swelled more and more, till it broke 
the barriers of province, sect and creed. At the time 
of his death, Mr. Tilak was the idol of the people, the 
moulder of the national will. Honour came to him, 
in spite of his political opponents, in spite of bu- 
reaucratic persecutions. " But the cup that in- 
toxicated others, sobered him. " He kept his head 
cool, in the midst of regal honours, huge pro- 
cessions and deafening ovations. He utilised these 
outbursts for the propagation of his ideas, but he 
was, by nature averse to and impatient of such 
demonstrations. The spirit of renunciation was a 



324 LOKAMANYA TILAK 

marked feature of his character. He liked to dispense 
honours, rather than to receive them. He would be 
something higher than a king, — a king-maker. From the 
Superintendentship of the New English School and the 
Principalship of the Fergusson College to the Presiden- 
tship of the Home Rule Conference and of the National 
Congress, Mr. Tilak studiously kept himself in the 
back-ground and rejoiced in the honour of others. Time 
was, when, while in a minority in the Congress, he 
suffered his name to be proposed for the Presidentship 
of the Congress. But that was only for establishing a 
principle and not for seeking any honour ; and when 
his party did come to caommand a majority in the 
Congress, he twice refused the highest honour offered 
to him. The Special Sessions of the Congress in 1918 
and 1920 were presided over by Mr. Hasan Imam 
and Lala Lajpat Rai, and on both these occasions Mr. 
Tilak's Presidentship was unanimously sought. 

A true Brahmin and a true Kshatriya, Mr. Tilak, at 
the time of his death, was the most powerful personality 
in India.
