> For us there is but one choice. We have made it. Woe be 
to the man or groups of men that seek to stand in our way in 
this day of our high resolution when every principle we hold 
dearest is to be Vindicated and made secure for our salvation. 
> 
> President Wilson 

After nine long years of separation, Mr. Tilak 
 joined his old comrades at the Congress of Lucknow (1916). What a change ! In 1907, the nation was 
on the eve of a relentless campaign of repression. Now 
in 1916, the country was throbbing with the expectation of a vast political transformation, which Mr. Tilak 
had worked so laboriously to bring about. No wonder 
therefore, that when he stood to address the 2350 ex- 
pectant delegates and thrice as many spectators he was 
accorded an enthusiastic ovation. He said : — 

> " I am not foolish enough to think that this reception 
is given to my humble self. It is given, if I rightly 
understand to those principles for which I have been 
fighting, principles which have been embodied in the 
resolution I have the honour to support. I am glad to say 
that I have lived these ten years to see that we are going 
to put our voices and shoulders together to push on the 
scheme of Self-Government. We are now united in 
every way in the United Provinces." 

Without depreciating the efforts of several leaders who 
worked hard to accomplish the Hindu-Moslem Unity, 
it may be said that Mr. Tilak's foresight and generosity 
in substantially conceding many of the demands of the 
Mahomedans gratified them beyond all measure. They 
had been taught to believe that Mr. Tilak was anti- 
Mahomedan, that in the Hindu-Moselm controversies 
of 1893-94 he had been unfriendly to them and that his 
Shivaji and Ganapati festivals were instituted with 
the sole object of irritating their community. They 
were, therefore, doubly glad to find that Mr. Tilak was 
in favour of an enormously big percentage of repre- 
sentation to the Mahomedans in the Legislative Coun- 
cils. To those of his more theoretical and hence less 
compromising brethren who looked with alarm at 
these concessions, Mr. Tilak said : — 

> It has been said that we, Hindus have yielded too 
much to our Mahomedan brethren. I am sure, I re- 
present the sense of the Hindu community all over 
India, when I say that we could not have yielded too 
much. I would not care if the rights of Salf-Govern- 
ment are granted to the Mahomedan Community only. 
I would not care if they are granted to the Rajputs. 
I would not care if they are granted to the lower 
classes of the Hindu population. Then the fight will 
not be triangular as, at present, it is. 

This is the language, not only of magnanimity but of 
statesmanship also. By making this concession, Mr^ 
Tilak successfully accomplished his object entertained 
ever since his return from Mandalay of winning over 
the Muslims. Influences were at work to keep the 
Mahomedans away from the Hindus ; for Sir James 
Meston had publicly advised them to place communal 
considerations over the National. It was at this critical time that Mr. Tilak threw the whole weight of his 
advice and influence over to the side of the Muslims 
and secured their lasting co-operation. 

In criticising (October 1916), the " Memorandum of 
19 " Mr. Tilak had said that the demand made therein 
was pretty well so far as it went but that it was neces- 
sary that the succeeding instalments of Self-government 
should be definitely determined and announced toge- 
ther with the time-limit for complete realization of all 
our aspirations. He tried his best to press the inclu- 
sion of this limit in the resolution of Self-Government. 
The Hon'ble Mr. Shastri also was of opinion that we 
should not " hesitate to demand that Responsible 
Government should be worked up to in the course of 
the next thirty years." But the stalwarts of the Con- 
gress did not favcur this view and for the sake of unity 
Mr. Tilak, dropped the matter. The Congress of 19 17 
made good this mistake and included a definite time- 
limit in the resolution of Swaraj. 

For the sake of unity, Mr. Tilak allowed his scheme 
of a small and compact Congress Executive to be shel- 
ved. The All-India Congress Committee, the tim.e- 
honoured Executive of the Congress was found to be 
quite unwieldy and the new body proposed by Mr. 
Tilak was merely a supplem.entary body and never 
aimed at usurping the functions of the old one. Doubt- 
less, Mr. Tilak took his cue from the War-Cabinet of 
three or four members which Mr. Lloyd George institu- 
ted in order to save the inevitable delays of the Cabinet 
When we remember that even Mr. Lloyd Goerge in 
times of extreme emergency and national peril could 
bring about this change only by creating a split in the 
Cabinet and driving out of office his old chief, we are 
not surprised that Mr. Tilak was unsuccessful. Pre- 
judices and prepossessions die hard. Mr. Tilak would 
however brook no compromise on one point. He 
wanted the Congress to call on the Home Rule Leagues 
and other public Associations to carry on continuously 
a vigorous propaganda. " If the Congress " he said 
" would not lead a national agitation, let the Home 
Rule Leagues at least do the work." It was with evi- 
dent ill-grace that the veteran Moderates allowed the 
Resolution to be passed. Even Mr. Jinnah and Pandit 
Madan Mohan Malaviya voted against it. This reso- 
lution was only the thin end of the wedge and Mr. Tilak 
trusted time to make the National Congress lead the 
National movements. 

The memorable 1917 dawned and found Mr. Tilak 
busy with his Home Rule Propaganda. During the 
whole of this eventful year, Mr. Tilak toured from one 
end of the country to the other. He delivered lectures 
at Calcutta, Delhi, Mathura, Nagpur, Akola, Godhra, 
Surat, Jalgaon, DhuUa, Belgaum, Thana, Sholapur, 
Satara and other places too numerous to be mentioned 
in detail. It is estimated that he delivered over 100 
lectures to audiences varying from 4 to 20 thousand. 
He exhorted his countrjnnen to be up and doing ; he 
wanted them to strike while the iron was hot. His 
cherished plan of sending a Home Rule Deputation to 
England was approved of everj^-where and people 
gladly paid large sums of money to meet the expendi- 
ture. 

During the earlier course of the war, the Bureaucracy 
16 



242 LOKAMANYA TILAK 

had to hold the dog of repression in leash. But when 
the Home Rule Leagues were started, the officials felt 
that something must be done to arrest the tide of enthu- 
siasm. With this object in view, they tried to overawe 
Mrs. Besant and Mr. Tilak. But the proceedings against 
both failed to accomplish the purpose. Then came the 
Lucknow Congress ; and the unique combination of zeal 
and wisdom, of dash and caution, of idealism and 
practical statesmanship which the session revealed con- 
vinced the Government officials that a New India 
was really born. The Bureaucracy set itself a- 
thinking. Even as early as March 19 16, Lord 
Hardinge had cautioned India not to hold any extra- 
vagant hopes and to remember that even in the now 
Self-Governing Colonies, the step of progress had been 
slow. Lord Chelmsford too had raised his voice against 
what he called catastrophic changes. About March 
19 17 " the Government of India issued a Circular to 
Local Governments outlining the policy to be pursued 
by the latter in connection with the Indian demand 
for reforms.*' Circulars, prohibiting students from 
attending political meetings, especially those convened 
by the Home-Rulers or where Home Rule was likely to 
be discussed were issued. In May 1917, the Governor 
of Madras and the Lieutenant-Governor of Punjab made 
" pronouncements which betrayed by their similarity 
of tenor and phraseology, a common source of inspira- 
tion. In these pronouncements, .these heads of two 
provinces exaggerated the nature of Indian demands, 
deprecated them in strong language, enjoined the 
people to abstain from all agitation and threatened 
them with repressive action if they did not do so,*' 



•' RESPONSIBLE GOVERNMENT *' 243 

Next to Maharashtra, Madras was the most active pro- 
vince in the cause of Home Rule; unfortunately its Satrap 
-was extremely anxious to loom in the lime-light. He 
therefore carried out his threat of repression by issuing 
Internment orders against Mrs. Besant and two of her 
colleagues. He had expected that the internment of 
Mrs. Besant would cow down the people. He must have 
been surprised to find his tyranny met with defiance. 
The whole country with one voice condemned his action. 
It was feared that this was only the first of a series of 
repressive measures contemplated by the Government. 
There was a widespread alarm that the internment of 
Besant was meant as a blow to her Home Rule League 
and that the Government would crush the Home- 
Rule Leaguers first and the Congressmen afterwards. 
Viewing the situation from this standpoint, even 
the Moderate leaders thought it their duty to join 
the Home Rule Leagues. (The Hon'ble) Mr.M. A. 
Jinnah and several other leading Congressmen and 
Muslim-leaguers in Bombay joined the Home Rule 
League immediately after the publication of the 
internment order.More important still was the attitude 
of the Moderate leaders at Allahabad, who at this 
most momentous crisis joined hands with the Home 
Rulers and championed their cause. When we 
remember how, so far as the Punjab at least 
was concerned, the deportation (1907) of Lala Lajpat 
Rai had ademorahzing effect on the people, we 
can appreciate the awakening that had now come over 
the people, in that they refused to take this gratui 
tous act of repression with anything like fear or 
submission. 



244 LOKAMANYA TILAK 

At the meeting (July 28th and 29th) of the All- India 
Congress Committee, Mr. Tilak's voice reigned supreme. 
He expressed his gratification at the united and strong 
protest made by the people against the internment of 
Mrs. Besant. He heartily thanked those of the Moder- 
ates who, at the call of duty, stood by Mrs. Besant and 
the infant Home Rule Leagues. But he was not content 
merely with the protest, howsoever strong and united it 
might be. He called for action. What are we to do ? 
Our first duty was, he said, to efiect the earliest possible 
release of Mrs. Besant and her two associates. If the 
Bureaucracy took the hint and did the needful, — well 
and good. If however the fetish of prestige held the 
powers that be from recognizing their mistake, we must 
compel them to come to terms. Passive Resistance (or 
Civil Disobedience) was he said the only weapon which 
would rouse the slumbering conscience of the authori- 
ties. The Bureaucracy was on the war-path.It would not 
even allow us peacefully to protest against the intern- 
ment orders. If a meeting convened by a leader Hke 
Dr. Rash Behari Ghose was prohibited, what guarantee 
was there, that liberty of expression and action would 
be allowed to us? Mr. Tilak, therefore, called upon the 
All-India Congress Committee to give a definite lead to 
the people. 

The Moderates were in a sore fix. There was not a 
single bright speck in the political firmament on which 
they could rely. On occasions when the spirit of en- 
thusiasm is abroad, * wisdom ' is at a discount. * Fore- 
sight and reasoned judgment ' are synonyms for timi- 
dity. The Nation thinks not with the bram but with 
aa overheated heart. Who can say whether in the 



?' RESPONSIBLE GOVERNMENT " 245 

long run such discarding of all caution and moderation 
leads to success or not ? It is only in the throes of 
tumult that Nations are born. It is exactly at this time 
that the moderate leaders, terrified at the narrow line 
which separates them and the people from utter destruc- 
tion cry halt. Their gray hair, their long and faithful 
services to the country fail to evoke anytking like rever- 
ential obedience. But what can the people do ? Is 
not the maxim " nothing venture, nothing have " tme 
in pohtics also ? Does it not perhaps become the only 
honourable and probably successful course on such occa- 
sions ? Unfortunately these are questions for the 
iuture historian and not for the soldiers in fight. 

In the manly representation made mainly under the 
inspiration of Mr. Tilak by the All-India Congress Com- 
mittee to the Viceroy and the Secretary of State, the re- 
presesive and reactionary policy of the Government 
of the day was condemned and the urgent necessity of 
■the immediate grant of a substantial instalment of 
Swaraj was established. It was plainly stated that 
unless a Roysd Proclamation regarding the early fulfil- 
ment of all our aspirations was issued and Mrs. Besant 
and the Ali brothers were forthwith set free the prevailing 
discontent would not be allayed. The Congress Com- 
mittee also testified to the unexceptionable and satis- 
factory work done by the Home Rule Leagues. It wiM 
thus be seen that the representation of the Committee 
was a statesmanlike document which profoundly in- 
fluenced the course of future events. 

Though Mr. Tilak was anxious to get the All-India 
Congress Committee pass a resolution recommending 
the adoption of Passive Resistance, still he was more 



246 LOKAMANYA TILAK 

anxious to carry with him as many Moderates as he pos- 
sibly could. Instead, therefore, of insisting upon an 
immediate passing of a resolution to the effect, he wil- 
lingly supported the idea that all the Provincial Com- 
mittees should in the first instance be called upon to 
submit their views on the subject. He knew that time 
was with him and that sooner or later Passive Resistance 
was bound to be adopted. He could afford to wait, 
being convinced of the ultimate result. 

Mr. Tilak disagreed with all those who sought to bring 
about the release of Mrs. Bealsant merely by prayers 
and petitions. " If we want to prove how keenly we 
feel for her," " let us elect her President of the coming 
Congress." Released or unreleased, Mrs. Besant must 
be President. This was both sentiment and statesman- 
ship. In accordance with this suggestion, the various Pro- 
vincial Congress Committees nominated Mrs. Besant for 
the Presidentship of the Calcutta Congress. This atti- 
tude was in direct opposition to the conduct and policy 
of the Moderates. Their policy was not to provoke the 
displeasure or anger of the Bureaucracy by calling upon 
persons disliked by Government to preside over the de- 
liberations of the Congress. With that object in view, 
was Mr. Tilak 's name repeatedly set aside, and when at 
Calcutta, his election seemed fairly certain, the Grand 
Old Man of India was invited (1906) for the honour. 
With that object in view, was Lala Lajpat Raikept from 
the Presidential chair, when the Nation with one voice 
demanded his election at Surat (1907). The Hon'ble 
Mr. Gokhale while opposing the election of the Lala had 
said " we cannot flout the Government. The Govern- 
ment will throttle our movement in no time. "..What 



" RESPONSIBLE GOVERNMENT 247 

would have been Mr. Gokhale's surprise, had he been 
living in 19 17, to learn that the overwhelming majority 
of the Nation had determined to flout the Government 
by electing Mr. Besant and Mr. Mahomed Ali for the 
Presidentship of the National Congress and Muslim 
League respectively even when they were in intern- 
ment ? 

With the Moderates' opposition to the adoption of Pas- 
sive Resistance and to' the election of Mrs. Besant for the 
Presidentship of the Congress, it was clear that a crisis 
was approaching and that the unity, which the Nation 
had shown in formulating the Congress-League scheme 
and in conducting vigorously the Home Rule agitation, 
was terribly strained. The loose organisation of the 
Congress threatened to be wrecked on the rocks of 
serious party differences. But the timely appointment 
of Mr, Montagu as Secretary of State for India consider- 
ably improved the situation. The historic declaration 
of August 20 th soon followed. Another announcement 
still — Mr. Montagu was to come over to India to study 
the question of Constitutional Reforms ! The situ- 
ation at once changed. The cry of Passive Resistance 
was dropped ; and every set of politicians began to for- 
mulate the pohtical reforms to be sought at the hands 
of the new Secretary of State. 

If there was any politician in India whose pro- 
gramme of work was not materially altered by the an- 
nouncement of Mr. Montagu's visit, it was Mr. Tilak ; 
with his unerring judgment, he clearly saw that what- 
ever concessions Mr. Montague would be inclined to 
make would, to a considerable extent, be negatived by 
the reactionary forces at work in India and England ; 



248 LOKAMANYA TILAK 

and that the only way of not only strengthening the 
hands of the Secretary of State for India bur also of sti- 
mulating his generosity and sense of justice was an 
effective appeal to the British Democracy. There were 
those who argued that this was hardly the time to thrust 
our grievances upon the attention of our distracted and 
well-nigh disappointed rulers. Mr. Tilak begged to 
differ from them. Though not prepared to hold that" 
" England's difficulty is our opportunity " he saw 
nothing wrong in drawing Britain's urgent attention to 
the easiest way of enlisting India's vast man-power in 
their cause. Side by side, therefore, with the work of 
organizing our resources and formulating the demands 
to be placed before the Viceroy and the Secretary of 
State, he continued unabated the still more important 
task of awakening the people to a full consciousness of 
the supreme importance of his plan of campaign. 

Mr. Tilak's triumphant Home Rule tour was twice in- 
terrupted to suit the work of the moment. On November 
26th, the joint deputation of the Madras and Poona 
Home Rule Leagues waited on Lord Chelmsford and the 
Secretary of State and on the following day Mr. Tilak 
had a long interview with Mr. Montague. He was ex- 
tremely well-received and is said to have created a deep 
impression on the mind of the Secretary of State. May 
we add that the efforts of the latter to secure Mr. Tilak's 
full support to the impending reforms were all unavail- 
ing? 

f;!*, The Calcutta session of the National Congress under 
the Presidentship of Mrs. Besant called forth all the 
statesmanship of Mr. Tilak. The Declaration of August 
20th, 1917, had in a sense, created a great muddle in the 



•* RESPONSIBLE GOVERNMENT " 249 

political situation. The Congress-League scheme was 
drawn up on the basis of an irremovable executive. 
In all our agitation we had supported the Congress- 
League scheme. To change, even in one essential, the 
scheme which was formulated with great care and 
caution would have opened a flood-gate of amendments 
and the unity of the Congress would have been weaken- 
ed by dissensions. Mr. Tilak, therefore, suggested that 
until the Government scheme of Reforms was out, we 
should stick to the one which had evoked the unani- 
mous support of the people. There was time enough to 
decide, after the Government published its report on 
constitutional reforms, whether in the light of the official 
proposals, the Congress-League scheme should be 
modified or not. 

A welcome step in advance was the insertion of a 
time-limit in the Resolution of Swaraj. 

While Mr. Tilak was straining every nerve to collect 
funds for the Home Rule League Deputation, the model 
Moderates were gradually being won over and were im- 
pressed with the necessity of supporting any scheme 
of reforms that would be placed before the Parliament. 
When we remember, how eager our Moderate friends are 
for co-operation with the Government, which sometimes 
means quiet submission to the bureaucratic will; when 
we remember how the unmeaning reforms of 1909 were 
praised as " generous and just/' need we wonder that 
the Moderates rallied round the banner of the Viceroy 
and the Secretary of State ? Those who know some- 
thing of the inner history of Indian Pohtics during the 
few months preceding the pubhcation of the Mont-ford 
Report are well aware of the specific purpose for which 



250 LOKAMANYA TILAK 

the Liberal League was started at Calcutta under the 
presidency of the Hon'ble Mr. Surendranath Banerjea, 
The circulars sent by the Secretaries of the League all 
over Bengal, calling upon people to be fully prepared to 
study the forthcoming report " impartially and without 
any prejudice " and to accept the scheme even when it 
fell short of our expectations, prove beyond all doubt 
that many of the Moderates had determined to secede 
from the Congress even before the publication of the 
Report. In their beggarly impatience to get something 
without any risk, they decided to abandon the Congress, 
for they fully anticipated what the reception of the 
Report would be. Instead of calling upon the Nation 
to stand up, firm and strong, these Moderates began to 
send round mysterious whispers; and for the sake of a 
few crumbs of Self-Government they were willing to dis- 
card that unity which in spite of occasional tension, had 
prevailed since 1915, in the politics of the country. It 
was in this atmosphere of secrecy and conspiracy on 
the one hand and suspicion and distrust on the other 
that the Report, long awaited was published (July 
1918). 

The distrust with which the generality of the people 
looked to the publication of the Report was due to a 
number of significant events of which the nth hour 
cancellation of the passports of Mr. Tilak and his col- 
leagues was not the least important. It was daily becom- 
ing clearer and clearer that a reactionary element was at 
work, both here and in England and that it was useless to 
expect a satisfactory settlement of our grievances so long 
as these reactionaries were allowed to run amuck. 
People had expected that Mr. Montague would attend 



" RESPONSIBLE GOVERNMENT " 251 

the War Conference at Delhi and make some inspiring' 
pronouncement. He did nothing of the kind. To the 
War Conference held under the Presidency of the 
Viceroy neither Mrs. Besant nor Mr. Tilakwas invited. 
The Self-Government resolution proposed by the Hon'ble 
Mr. Khaparde was ruled out of order. The Conference 
was all an ofBcial show and hence proved a complete 
failure. Nor was the mistake rectified at Bombay 
where Lord Willingdon inflicted on his audience a severe 
sermon on Home Rulers, whose bona fides he called into 
question. Mr. Tilak was called upon to speak but was 
not allowed to make a mention of Home Rule and had 
to stop. More significant than all these were the rumoured 
recommendations of the Rowlatt Committee which 
were intended as a set off against the proposals contain- 
ed in the Montford-Report. The notorious Rowlatt 
report, so disastrous to the cause of Indian Liberty, was 
equally damaging to Mr. Tilak, the course of whose 
action against Sir Valentine Chirol it was likely to in- 
fluence profoundly. 

The Montford-Report was condemned by the majority 
of educated Indians. Mr. Tilak characterized it as a 
*' sunless dawn." Mrs. Besant held that the poUtical 
reforms indicated in the Report were unworthy of 
England to give and of India to take. The Hon'ble 
Mr. Patel showed how in certain details the report had 
made retrograde proposals. Mr. N. C. Kelkar prono- 
unced the proposals as cruelly disappointing and 
** almost a wicked attempt to let Indian leaders be 
stewed in their own juice." The Hon'ble Mr. B. Cha- 
krabarty said that throughout the report, the fetish 
of peace, order and good Government was worshipped. 



-252 LOKAMANYA TILAK 

Prof. Jitendralal Banerjea declared that the reforms 
were grudging, half-hearted, meagre, inadequate and 
hence disappointing and abortive ; while the veteran 
Dr. Subrahmanyam Ayer advised his countrymen not 
4:0 touch the narcotic that was offered to them. 

To place " the essentials of the Congress-League 
scheme within the frame -work of the Montague-Chelms- 
ford Report " so that neither the fire-eaters of the Ex- 
-tremist Party nor the cautious members of the Mode- 
a:ate Party might find reasonable cause for grumbling 
was an extremely difficult and dehcate work. Much 
of the credit of having restrained the fury of the " Ex- 
tremists " can be claimed by Mr. Tilak and Mrs. Besant. 
" If your cavalry charges a-head brilliantly, galloping 
on the foe, without the preparation of the artillery, with- 
out the support of the infantry, what will happen ? 
The enemy will meet them in their charge, will find 
-them unsupported, will mow them down separated 
from the main body of the host, and then, having anni- 
hilated the cavalry, he would advance across the grounds 
left empty to annihilate the infantry in its turn." Mr. 
Tilak was in complete accord with these sentiments of 
Mrs. Besant and co-operated with her in trying to pre- 
vent the Moderates from seceding. 

Knowing that he would be required to do the work of 
a Peace-maker, Mr. Tilak, with rare self-effacement re- 
fused to accept the Presidentship of the Special Session 
of the Congress. Even when the Moderates definitely 
parted company and, in the language of Sir Dinshaw 
Petit " collected round them some people who never 
took part in politics except grind their own axes " and 
sought to have a separate Conference of their own, Mr. 



" RESPONSIBLE GOVERNMENT " 2SS 

Tilak was desirous of keeping the door open for their re- 
turn to the Congress Camp. On the fourth day of the 
Congress (September ist 19 18), the Resolution on the 
Reform Scheme was moved by (the Hon'ble) Pandit 
Madan Mohan Malaviya in a closely-reasoned speech 
which will go down to future generations as a historic 
and statesmanlike pronouncement. (The Hon'ble) Sir 
Dinshaw M, Petit, the distinguished Parsi millionaire 
seconded the Resolution in a lucid speech which descri- 
bed how "the Resolution dispels the fear of some of 
our friends and shatters the hope of our enemies that 
the Congress was going to reject the seheme without 
discussing its merits or demerits." Eleven leading 
Congressmen supported the Resolution. Pandit Motilal 
Nehru showed how the Congress was " able to perform 
the impossible feat of uniting its appreciation, recogni- 
tion, and in plain English, its condemnation " of the 
Montague-Chelmsford Report. Mr. Fazlul Haq proved 
how " though we hear of the change of the angle of 
vision, it is either an obtuse angle or an acute angle 
but never the right angle." Mr. Jayakar showed how 
the " taint of the school-master "was responsible for the 
"periodic examinations "set for the Indian people. Mrs. 
Besant wound up the discussion in an impassioned 
speech. Speaking to the Resolution, Mr, Tilak said : — 

" What we have tried to do in the Subjects' Com- 
mitee is to distil our different opinions, and it was very 
difficult to distil " the gourds and the cucumbers " 
together. It was no easy task ; even our enemies had 
considered it to be difficult. They believed that we 
were engaged in an impossible business and that by 
the beginning of September the Congress would be no- 



:254 LOKAMANYA TILAK 

where. Unfortunately for them, their predictions have 
not proved true. So long as the spirit of forbearance 
and the spirit of give-and-take pervades in the Councils 
of the Congress such a fatal contingency is never likely 
to arise. 

" We were told that the Congress was going to reject 
ihe whole scheme. I could never understand and have ne- 
ver understood what it meant. We are in the midst of our 
negotiations. If you reject the scheme you have done 
with it. What are you then going to tell the British 
people ? " That we reject the scheme ?" I think 
that we have learnt enough of politics to know that it is 
absurd to take such a position. Fortunately for all, we 
have been able to place before you a reasoned document, 
a resolution, which combines the wisdom of one 
party, I may say, the temperament of another party, 
and if you like to call it, I do not like to call it myself — 
the rashness of a third party. 

" The Montague Report is a beautiful, very skilful and 
statesmanlike document. We asked for eight annas of 
Self-government; that report gives us one anna of Res- 
ponsible Government and says that it is better than the 
eight annas of Self-Govemment. The whole Uterary 
skill of the Report lies in making us beheve that one 
morsel of Responsible Government is more than suffi- 
cient to satisfy our hunger for Self-government. We 
now plainly say to the Government, * we thank you for 
the one anna of Responsible Government but in the 
scheme we want to embody, not all that is embodied in 
the Congress-League scheme, the rails might be 
different but the carriages that carry passengers might 
be transferred from one rail to another. This is what 



*' RESPONSIBLE GOVERNMENT " 255 

we have tried to do and we have tried to satisfy all 
parties concerned and a very difficult task has been 
accomplished. The future way is clear and I hope that 
what we have done will be of material help in carrying 
on this fight to the end." 

The moderation and good sense of the special session 
of the Congress disarmed all opposition and many of the 
seceders returned to the old camp at Delhi (December 
1918) where, however, in the absence of Mr. Tilak, a 
variety of circumstances conspired to foment those 
dissensions which have, ever since, made Indian PoUtics 
such a hopeless tangle. Neither the rancour nor the 
differences bom of the Delhi Congress has been allayed 
or made up. On the contrary, the bitterness has been 
further intensified by succeeding events, — the passing 
of the Rowlatt Act in the teeth of Indian opposition^ 
the campaign of Civil Disobedience started by Mahatma 
Gandhi, the irresponsible acts of Government's agents, 
culminating in the shocking Punjab tragedy with all 
its long and interminable sequal. All this while, Mr. 
Tilak was a passive though deeply interested observer 
in distant London. 

While Mr. Tilak was on his way to England, he was 
unanimously elected President of the Delhi Congress. 
This was the considered reply which the Nation 
gave to the prohibitionary order issued by Lord Willing-
