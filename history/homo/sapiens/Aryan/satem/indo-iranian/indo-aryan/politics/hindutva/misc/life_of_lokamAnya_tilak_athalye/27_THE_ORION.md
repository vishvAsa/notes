( Appendix A and B will give the reader an idea of 
the principal arguments advanced by Mr. Tilak 
in the Orion and the Arctic Home in the Vedas to 
establish his theories. The Gita-Rahasya being com- 
paratively a recent production is too well-known 
to require any summary. ) 

Oriental scholars have advanced vague and uncertain conjectures about the age and character of the Vedas. Prof. Max Muller has divided the Vedic literature into four arbitrary periods, the Chhandas, Mantra, Brahmana and Sutra and by assigning two hundred 
years for each period he arrives at about 1200 B.C. 
as the latest date at which the Vedic hymns have been 
composed. As opposed to this linguistic method of 
ascertaining the age of the Vedas, there is the astronomical method which though condemned by European scholars as inaccurate and conjectural, can, if properly 
applied, lead us to good results. The Vedas, the Brahmanas and the Sutras contain numerous allusions and 
references to astronomical facts. There are several 
sacrificial hymns in the Rig-veda. Now, no sacrificial 
system could be developed without the knowledge of 
months, seasons and the year. It appears that 
the Vedic Rishis kept up their calender by performing the corresponding round of sacrifices on the sacred fire that constantly burnt in their houses ; and 
as they were not only the sacrificers of the community 
but were also its time-keepers, these two functions 
appear to have blended into one by assigning the commencement of the several sacrifices to the leading days 
of the year on the natural ground that if the sacrifices 
were to be performed, they must be performed on the 
principal days of the year. Samvatsara and Yajna 
therefore came to be regarded as convertible terms. 

Let us now examine the principal parts of the year 
alias the sacrifice. The Savana or the civil day, as its 
etymology shows, was selected as the natural unit of 
time. 30 such days made a month and 12 such months 
or 360 Savana days made a year. Now, a month of 30 
civil or savana days cannot correspond with a lunar 
synodical month and so a day in some of the Savana 
months was required to be omitted to secure the con- 
currence of the civil and lunar months. The year of 
360 Savana days was thus practically reduced to a 
lunar year of 354 civil days or 360 tithis. But a further 
correction was necessary to adjust the lunar with the 
solar reckoning of time. The commencement of the 
cycle of the seasons was, therefore, the only means to 
correct the calender and the ancient Aryans hit upon 
the device of the intercalary days or month for the 
purpose. 

It appears that the early Vedic priests were ignorant 
of the motion of the equinoxes. The early Aryans must 
have determined the position of the sun in the 
ecliptic by observing, every morning, the fixed 
star nearest to it. Under such system, the year 
would naturally be over when the sun returned to the 
same fixed star. The solar year, therefore, mentioned 
in the Vedic works, must be considered as sidereal and 
not tropical. The difference between the sidereal and 
the tropical year is 20.4 minutes which causes the 
seasons to fall back nearly one lunar month in about 
every two thousand years. When these changes came to 
be noticed for the first time they caused surprise and 
were regarded as foretelling some great calamity. 

Another important point, relevent to our purpose is 
when the year commenced. The Vedanga-Jyotish 
makes the year (and Uttarayana) commence with the 
winter- solstice. But a closer examination shows that 
the winter-solstice could not have been the original 
beginning of the annual sacrifices (and therefore of the 
year). The middle day of the annual Satra is called 
the Vishnuvan day and as Vishnuvan literally means 
the time when day and night are of equal length, if we 
suppose the year to have commenced with the winter 
solstice, the Vishnuvan or the equinoctial day could 
never have been its central day. If Vishnuvan was 
the central day of the year, the year must have once 
commenced with the equinoxes. We may, therefore, 
take Uttarayana to mean " the passage of the sun into 
the northern hemisphere, i.e., to the north of the 
equator ; and thus we can say that the Uttarayana and 
the year must have commenced with the Vernal equinox. 
While describing the Devayana and Pitriyana, the 
Shatapatha Brahmana (ii-i-3-3). lays it down in dis- 
tinct terms that Vasanta, Grishma and Varsha were 
the seasons of the Devas. It is impossible therefore 
to maintain that the Devayana or the Uttarayana 
-ever commenced with the winter-solstice, for in 
neither hemisphere the winter-solstice marks the 
beginning of the spring, the first of the Deva seasons. It is difficult to definitely ascertain the 
time when the commencement of the year was changed 
from the vernal equinox to the winter solstice. When 
this change was made, Uttarayana must have gradually 
come to denote the first half of the new year, i.e., the 
period from the winter to the summer solstice especially 
as the word was capable of being understood as " turning towards the North from the Southern- most point.

All our present calenders are prepared on the sup- 
position that the Vernal equinox still coincides with the 
end of Revati and our enumeration of the Nakshatras 
begins with Ashvini, though the equinox has now re- 
ceded about 18° from Revati. This position of the 
Vernal equinox was true at about 490 A.D. when 
probably the present system was introduced. Let us 
now see if we can trace back the position of the Vernal 
equinox amongst the fixed circle of stars. From Varahamihira, we know that before the Hindus began to 
make their measurements from the Vernal equinox in Revati, there existed a system in which the year commenced 
with the winter solstice in the month of Magha and the 
Vernal equinox was in the last quarter of Bharani or the 
beginning of the Krittikas. The Vedanga- Jyotish, the old- 
est astronomical work in Sanskrit, gives the follow- 
ing positions of the solstice and the equinoxes : — 

- (i) The winter solstice in the beginning of Shravishtha (divisional). 
- (2) The Vernal equinox in 10° of Bharani. 
- (3) The summer solstice in the middle of Ashlesha, 
- (4) The autumnal equinox in 3° 20' of Vishakha. 

From these data, astronomers have calculated that 
the solstitial colure occupied the above position be- 
tween 1269 B.C. to 1181 B.C. There are many passages 
in the Taittiriya Samhita and the Taittiriya Brahmana 
where the Krittikas occupy the first place in the list of 
the Nakshatras. We must, therefore, presume that 
the Vernal equinox coincided with the Krittikas when 
the Taittiriya Samhita was compiled. The Taittiriya 
Brahmana (i 5, 2, 7) says that the Nakshatras are the 
houses of Gods and that the Nakshatras of the Devas 
begin with the Krittikas. The Shatapatha Brahmana 
expressly states that the Sun was to be considered as 
moving amongst and protecting the Devas, when he 
turned to the North, in the three seasons, of spring, summer and rains. This, therefore, at once fixes the position of the Krittikas at the beginning of the Devayana 
or the vernal equinox at the time when these works 
were compiled. The Taittiriya Samhita expressly states 
that the winter solstice fell in Magha. From all these, 
we conclude that the Krittikas coincided with the Vernal equinox when the Taittiriya Samhita was compiled 2350 B.C. 

The passage in the Taittiriya Samhita which states 
that the winter solstice fell in Magha also refers to the 
Phalguni full-moon and the Chitra full-moon as the 
first days of the year. Now as evidently there can't 
be real beginnings of the year at an interval of one 
month each, the passage must be understood as re- 
cording a tradition about these two full-moon days 
being once considered as the first days of the year. If 
the year commenced with winter solstice with the 
Phalguni full-moon, the Vernal equinox must have been 
in the Mrigashiras (Orion) The word Agrhaayani (Syn. for Mrigashiras), suggests the same tale. With the Vernal equinox near the asterism of Mrigashiras, the autumnal 
equinox would be in Mula which was so called because 
its acronycal rising marked the commencement of the 
year.+++(4)+++ Again with the winter solstice occuring on the 
Phalguni full-moon day, the summer solstice fell on 
the Bhadrapadi full moon so that the dark half of 
Bhadrapada was the first fortnight in the Pitriyana, 
understood as commencing on the summer solstice. 
On no other hypothesis can the dedication of the dark 
half of Bhadrapada to the Pitris be satisfactorily ex- 
plained. 

When the Vernal equinox was in Orion it was the 
beginning of the Devayana and as the constellation is 
remarkable for its brilliancy and attractiveness, the 
ancient Aryans may have been naturally influenced not 
merely to connect their old traditions with it but also 
to develop them on the same lines. Thus the Devayana 
and the Pitriyana, as representing the two hemispheres 
must be joined and the Vernal and the autumnal equi- 
noxes became the natural points of union between the 
regions of Gods and Yama. The equinoxes were in fact 
the gates, of heaven and as such it was natural to sup- 
pose that they were watched by dogs (Canis Major 
and Canis Miror). In the later Indian literature we are 
told that the souls of the deceased have to cross a stream 
before they reach the region of Yama which we can 
easily identify with the Milky W^ay which could then 
have been appropriately described as separating the 
regions of Gods and Yama, the Devayana and the Pritri- 
yana or the Northern and the Southern hemisphere. 


Later, it is actually called the celestial river and we are 
further told that the land of the blessed is to be reached 
by " the celestial ship with a good rudder." We can 
satisfactorily account for these legends by supposing 
that the Vernal equinox was near the Dog-star in those 
days just near the Milky Way, 

There is another set of traditions which can be simi- 
larly explained on the supposition with which we have 
started, viz., the Vernal equinox was then in Orion. The 
heliacal rising of the constellation at the beginning of 
the year marked the revival of nature at the commence- 
ment of spring and the asterism may thus be said to 
represent all these milder influences which in later 
mythology were fully embodied in the conception of 
Vishnu. But the case was completely reversed if we 
take the acronycal rising of the same. It was at the 
autumnal equinox that the Dog-star rose at the begin- 
ning of night and though strictly speaking it marked 
the end of Varsha,yet the portion of the heaven wherein 
the constellation is situated could have been easily re- 
garded as the battle-ground of Indra and Vritra, who 
fought in those days and also as the stage on which the 
terrible Rudra made his appearance. On this same 
hypothesis we can explain how Vritra came to be sta- 
tioned at the gates of hell. Indra cut off the head of Vritra 
or Namuchi in the form of a Mriga and this at once sug- 
gests whether that head is not the same as that of 
Prajapati cut off by Rudra (Ardra or Sirius). The 
foamy weapon with which Indra killed Namuchi is noth- 
ing but a reference tot he Milky Way, The attributes of 
Rudra, chasing of the antelope, his bearing of the Ganges 
in his matted hair and fondness for the burning ground 
and appearance as a Kirata or hunter — all these can be 
accounted for by placing Rudra just below the Milky 
Way or the celestial Ganges at the gates of the Pitriyana 
and figured as a hunter. In Rig. X 192-2, Samvatsara 
or the year is said to rise out of the ocean, the place 
where Vritra was killed (Rig. X 68-12). Prajapati as 
represented by Orion may also be naturally supposed 
to commence the year when the Vernal equinox was in 
Orion. Rudra killed Prajapati (or Samavatsara or 
Yajna) at the beginning of the year and as Yajna also 
meant sacrifice, Rudra was later believed to have killed 
the sacrifice of Daksha. So then Vishnu, representing 
the happy times of Vasanta, Rudra presiding over 
storms and Prajapati, the deity of sacrifices — these 
three principal deities of the Hindu Mythology can be 
traced to and located in the part of heaven occupied by 
Orion when the Vernal equinox was there. Later 
writers have described this Trinity as represented by the 
three-headed Dattatraya, followed by the Vedas in the 
forms of dogs, and from what has been written above, 
there can be no diificulty in identifying this personified 
Trinity with Orion having three stars in the head and 
closely followed by the dog (canis) at its foot. 

These and other traditions especially those of Ribhus 
and Vrishakapi strengthen the hypothesis of the tradi- 
tional year-beginning on the Phalguni full moon. With 
the Phalguni full moon at the winter solstice, the Vernal 
equinox was in Mrigashiras ; so with the Chitra full 
moon at the solstice, the Vernal equinox would be in 
Punarvasu. The presiding deity of Punarvasu is 
Aditi and we are told that Aditi had been blessed with 
a boon that all sacrifices must commence and end with 
her (Aitareya Brahmana 1-7 and the Taittiriya Samhita 
vi 1-5-1,). The story begins with the statement that 
the Sacrifice (the mysterious Sacrificial personage) went 
away from the Gods. The Gods were then unable to 
perform any further ceremonies, and did not know 
where it (the sacrifice) had gone to ; and it was Aditi 
that helped them in this state, to find out the proper 
commencement of the sacrifice. This clearly means 
that before this time sacrifices were performed at ran- 
dom, but it was at this time resolved and fixed to com- 
mence them from Aditi. Aditi was thus the oldest and 
rst commencement of the sacrifice or the year. In 
the Vajasaneyi Samhita 4-19 Aditi is said to be Ubha- 
yatah Shirshni " double-headed " and the commenta- 
tors interpret it to mean that the two termini of the 
sacrifice which began and ended with Aditi, are the 
two heads here alluded to. These traditions are further 
corroborated by the sacrificial ceremonies. According 
to the sacrificial terminology, the 4th day before Vishnu- 
van or the central day of the yearly Satra is called the 
Abhijit day. Now if Abhijit day be supposed to be 
named after the Nakshtra of that name (i.e. when the 
Sun is in Abhijit) then the Vishnu van or the autumnal 
equinox must fall four days after the asterism 
of Abhijit ; and it can be shown by astronomical calcu- 
lation that with Aditi or Punarvasu at the Vernal 
equinox to commence the sacrifice, we nearly get at 
the same result. 

Therefore, the oldest period in the Aryan civilisation 
may be called the Aditi or the pre-Orion period and we 
may roughly assign 6000 — 4000 B.C. as its limits. 
Then there was the Orion period roughly extending 
from 4000 B.C. to 2500 B.C. from the time when the 
Vernal equinox was in the asterism of Ardra to the 
time when it receded to the asterism of the Krittkias. 
The third or the Krittika period commences with the 
Vernal equinox in the asterism of the Krittikas and 
•extends up to the period recorded in the Vedanga- 
Jyotisha, i.e., 2500 B.C. to 1400 B.C. and the fourth and 
last period of the old Sanskrit literature extends from 
1400 B.C. to 500 B.C. or to the birth and rise of Bud- 
dhism which may be called the real-Pre Buddhistic 
period. It will thus be found that the antiquities of 
the Vedas can be traced up to a far remoter time than 
what Max Muller and other European scholars were 
willing to assign.
