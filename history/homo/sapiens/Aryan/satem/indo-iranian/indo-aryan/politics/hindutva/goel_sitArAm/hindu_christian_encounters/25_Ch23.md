**Encounter with Arun Shourie**

Missiology is a meticulous discipline developed quite early in the
history of Christianity as auxiliary to an exclusivist and aggressive
doctrine - Jesus Christ is the only saviour; there is no salvation
outside the Church; and infidels should be compelled to come in. By now
the discipline has become rather rich with experience gained over
several centuries and in all parts of the world. Many universities in
Europe and the Americas teach Missiology in their faculties of Catholic
and Protestant theologies. And there are a large number of Christian
seminaries spread over many countries where Missiology is studied in
great depth and detail by the soldiers of Christ before they commence
their prowl in search of prey.

As one surveys the literature of Missiology, one is struck by its close
similarity to the Communist literature on strategy and tactics for
staging the Revolution. One can go further and compare the two
literatures - Christian and Communist with the literature on military
science. Again, the close similarity is striking. One can, therefore,
conclude quite safely that Missiology is simply another name for waging
war on non-Christian societies and cultures with a view to conquer and
convert them completely.

The war was hot and waged with whatever happened to be the most lethal
weapons at any time, so long as the states in Europe served as the
secular arm of the Church. In this first phase of a permanent war, there
was no crime, howsoever horrendous, which Missiology did not prescribe
or endorse, and which was not practised by the holy warriors with great
glee and clean conscience. The blood-soaked history of Christian
missions which preceded or accompanied or followed the armies of
European imperialism, has been narrated by the missionaries themselves.
Men like Francis Xavier stand out in this record as hardened criminals
masquerading as religious priests.

The hot war came to end only when the imperialist powers realized that
their empires could be jeopardized if the sword was used overtly in the
service of the cross, particularly in the countries of Asia where the
infidels were proud of their religions and cultures and capable of
coming out with armed resistance. Missiology was forced to devise
methods of waging a cold war by manipulating human minds. Armed might
was to be called into service only when missionary provocations enraged
the natives and riots broke out. For the rest, massive finance and media
power provided more effective weapons.

In this second phase of the permanent war, Christian missions mounted
vicious campaigns of calumny against the religions and cultures of the
conquered people so that the latter could be disarmed ideologically,
deflated psychologically, and thrown on the defensive all along the
line. At the same time, programmes of proselytization were launched for
crystallizing in the heart of subjugated societies whole colonies of
converts. Country after country was honeycombed with this bastardized
breed always ready to serve as the fifth-column of Christian-Western
imperialism. In most cases, the converts proved to be more faithful than
their foreign masters. 

The game was going on smoothly and satisfactorily when it was spoiled by
the retreat of Western imperialism after the Second World War. What was
more ominous for Christian missions, Christianity itself was found out
and suffered a collapse in its traditional homelands. Missiology was now
called upon to devise still more devious methods, not only for
camouflaging the fangs of a criminal creed but also for finding a new
home for it elsewhere, particularly in the Hindu-Buddhist countries. The
lead for forging more sophisticated methods was given by the Second
Vatican Council after prolonged deliberations during 1962-65. The
foremost among these new methods was described as “dialogue”. The
missionaries were directed to “discover whatever was of value in other
religious traditions” and proclaim that “salvation was available” in
those traditions as well. The fact that this concession rendered the
Christian missions redundant was neither faced nor mentioned. The
purpose of “dialogue” was far from honest.

In the context of “dialogue” with Hindus, the first purpose is quite
obvious. Hindus who participate in it recognize explicitly or implicitly
that Christianity is a religion and that those who are out to spread it
have a legitimate place in this country. The second purpose of
“dialogue” is to search for and locate segments of Hindu spiritual
tradition which sound or can be made to sound similar to some Christian
tradition. A “common ground” between Hinduism and Christianity can then
be proclaimed and used for conveying Christianity in Hindu attire. The
third purpose is to probe for points of resistance which Hindu mind may
harbour vis-a-vis Jesus Christ, the Christian message and the Christian
missions so that mission strategy can be suitably revised for overcoming
the resistance.

Needless to say that Hindu participants have to be of different types
for serving the different purposes of “dialogue”. The Hindu who
qualifies for the first purpose has to be more or less ignorant of
Hinduism as well as of Christianity. The Hindu who suits the second
purpose should be somewhat knowledgeable about Hinduism but an innocent
abroad when it comes to Christianity. Hindus of both types are available
easily and in plenty, particularly because the bait of foreign trips for
holding “dialogue” in better places and with brighter people is always
there. What has proved difficult is the search for a Hindu who can serve
the third purpose of ‘dialogue’.

So “dialogue” for serving its first two purposes has been going on for
quite some time. Christian organizations qualified for holding
“Hindu-Christian dialogue” have mushroomed all over the country in
recent years. The proceedings are reported in the Christian press as
well as in the publications of these organizations. Books on
“Hindu-Christian dialogue” or “common ground” between Hinduism and
Christianity have also been multiplying, particularly in Europe and the
U.S.A. Periodicals devoted specifically to Hindu-Christian dialogue have
also been launched.

A dialogue for serving its third purpose could be held only in January
1994 when Arun Shourie, the noted journalist and scholar, was invited by
the Catholic Bishops’ Conference of India (CBCI) to present a “Hindu
assessment” of missionary work in India. But unfortunately for-the
managers of this “dialogue”, it went out of hand and misfired. Ever
since, the giant Christian establishment in India has been smarting with
the hurt which Arun Shourie has caused. The uproar he has raised can be
compared only with the uproar which had followed the publication of K.
M. Panikkars’ Asia and *Western Dominance* in 1953. Missiology has been
mobilizing its arsenal of apologetics and polemics in order to control
the damage that has been done to Christian claims and pretensions.

It is difficult to say why the CBCI chose Arun Shourie for “dialogue”.
All one can do is to infer from known missionary motives. Here was a
Hindu, they must have thought, who was a man of stature, and known for
his scholarship as well as pronounced sympathy for Hindu causes. His
writings and speeches so far gave no indication that his commitment to
the Hindu spiritual vision was profound, or that his knowledge of
Christian doctrine and history was wide-ranging. He could, therefore, be
expected to provide some clues to the current Hindu resistance to
Christianity, and at the same time say something about Jesus Christ or
Christianity which could be advertised to the advantage of Christian
missions.

The CBCI was celebrating the 50th anniversary of its foundation, and
holding a Seminar at Ishvani Kendra, a Catholic seminary in Pune. Almost
all the Catholic big-wigs in India were present when Arun Shourie gave
his talk on 5 January 1994. He had been given two Conference documents –
‘Trends and Issues in Evangelization of India’ and ‘Paths of Mission in
India Today’ - which the Seminar was discussing. His critique was
confined to missionary methods, more or less on the lines laid down by
Mahatma Gandhi during his prolonged encounter with Christian
missionaries. Some of those present asked some questions which also were
similar to the questions the Mahatma had been asked earlier. The
atmosphere was cordial all through. At the end of the session, its
president remarked, “It has been a feast.” After his return to Delhi,
Arun Shourie received a letter dated 11 January 1994, from Augustine
Kanjamala, Secretary to the Conference, thanking him for sparing time
from his “busy schedule”, and requesting him to “give a presentation in
writing” so that it could be published along with the “talks of various
speakers of the Conference.”

Arun Shourie completed the paper pretty fast. He gave it the caption,
‘Missionaries in India’, and sent a copy of it to Kanjamala on 20
January 1994 with the request that it be published with the two
Conference documents as annexures because it had references to and
citations from them at several places. He received from Kanjamala a
letter dated 9 February thanking him for “completing the work and
sending it” promptly but pointing out that the paper was too long for
“publication along with other contributors.” Kanjamala asked him if it
was possible to “cut it down to, say, 10,000 words.” Finally, on 27
February 1994 Kanjamala came to meet Arun Shourie at the latter’s home
in New Delhi and informed him that his paper ‘would be published along
with responses from six or so persons who were working on the matter.’

In the two months that followed, Arun Shourie expanded his paper with
material from the history of Christian missions in India during British
rule. He highlighted the motives from which missionary work had
proceeded, and the consequences it had entailed. He cited ample evidence
to show how the work of undermining Hinduism and keeping India enslaved
had been shared between missionary scholars and scholar missionaries on
the one hand and the British administrators on the other. And he pointed
out how “the genes planted then had grown into the flours de mal, the
flowers of evil which continue to poison the perceptions of our elite to
this day.” Finally, he offered an analysis of the two Conference
documents to show how Christian missions had continued the same work of
subversion in post-independence India with such adjustments as were
dictated by the new situation.

By the time the paper was fully elaborated, it had acquired the size of
a book. Arun Shourie published it in early May 1994 under the title,
*Missionaries in India: Continuities, Changes, Dilemmas*.^([1](#1)) The
two Conference documents were included in it as annexures for purposes
of ready reference. A copy of the book was sent to Kanjamala with
compliments and thanks “for the invitation extended” and the opportunity
given to the author “to delve into the subject.” Meanwhile, Arun Shourie
had written several articles on the subject in his syndicated column
which appears in more than a score of newspapers published in several
languages all over the country. The articles evoked a lively discussion
in the *Maharashtra Herald* of Pune.

Kanjamala was quick to acknowledge receipt of the book by his letter
dated 18 May 1994. But what followed the acknowledgment left Arun
Shourie aghast. Firstly, Kanjamala accused Arun Shourie of publishing
“our seminar material without permission”, and enclosed “a corrected and
revised version” to be included in a new edition of the book. Secondly,
he sent an article, ‘Hinduization or Christianization’, and insisted
that it be incorporated as a chapter in the new edition as per agreement
arrived at “when we met each other in Delhi in February.” Thirdly, he
suggested that the cover page of the new edition should carry his name
as coauthor because his article and the two Conference documents would
together form one-third of the book. Finally, he requested Arun Shourie
to let him know “when the next edition is coming out with the revised
material”, and promised to “promote” it.

Kanjamala had given away the game he was playing or was forced to play,
when he confessed in the same letter that “some people are very
displeased with me”, and appealed to Arun Shourie to “appreciate my
situation.” Arun Shourie was prepared to sympathize with the man placed
in plight, perhaps for no fault of his own. But he was not at all
prepared to concede to that man the right to invent stories, tell lies,
and let his fancy run a riot. So he chided Kanjamala in a long letter
dated 24 May 1994. The letters which Kanjamala had written to him
earlier were still in his file. He used them to put the record straight.
He repudiated as a total lie Kanjamala’s story that there was an
agreement for including in the book a chapter written by Kanjamala. He
turned down Kanjamala’s suggestion regarding co-authorship as contrary
to his nature and practice as a writer. And he pointed out that at no
stage before or after his talk in Pune or in the letters written to him
subsequently, he was given to understand that the two Conference
documents were for private circulation. In fact, he had been given not
one but two sets of the documents with the word “Draft” written clearly
on top of the first page in each case.

Kanjamala wrote back that what he had conveyed in his letter dated 18
May 1994 was due to a “misunderstanding”. Arun Shourie expressed his
happiness to Kanjamala, and thought that the “cloud had blown over.” But
he had not taken into account the patent missionary methods. He found
that a vituperative campaign had been launched against his book and
against him personally. Articles started appearing in various newspapers
and publications of the Church, attributing motives to him and
misrepresenting as well as .denouncing his book. Several Christian
scribes had joined the campaign. But Kanjamala was in its forefront.

PRAJNA BHARATI, a forum for intellectual discourse and discussion with
headquarters in Hyderabad, invited several senior Churchmen to discuss
*Missionaries in India* on a public platform with Arun Shourie. All of
them excused themselves on one pretext or the other. At last the forum
extended an invitation to Kanjamala. He agreed to participate in the
discussion on the condition that he would present his critique before
Arun Shourie gave an answer. Arun Shourie had no objection to Kanjamala
having the first salvo.

The discussion took place on 4 September 1994 in a big hall at
Hyderabad. The hall was packed to capacity. The discussion and the
question-answer session that followed lasted for three and half hours.
Kanjamala made the following points:

> 1\. Literature showing Hindu antagonism to Christian missionaries is
> nothing new. The Arya Samaj had produced such literature in the past.
> Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, Bharatiya Janata Party, Vishwa Hindu
> Parishad and many other organisations are producing it at present.
>
> 2\. Arun Shourie has written the book for a specific readership in
> mind, namely, the people belonging to Hindu organizations, and with a
> specific purpose in view, namely, to present Christian missionaries as
> enemies of the nation.
>
> 3\. The missionary and allied literature cited by Arun Shourie in
> support of his main argument pertains to the colonial period of
> India’s history. It was written in a different context and is,
> therefore, dated and irrelevant in the present situation.
>
> 4\. Conversations of Gandhi with Christian missionaries, writings of
> Vivekananda, and conclusions of the Niyogi Committee Report also
> belong to a bygone age. They relate to an antiquated world view,
> mission view, mission theology, concept of salvation, role of
> Christian missionaries and evangelization.
>
> 5\. Arun Shourie’s book is aggressive and his interpretation of data
> exaggerated. His strategy is negative. He has a hidden agenda because
> nowhere in his big book he says anything positive about the work and
> contribution of Christian missionaries. He is preoccupied with
> missionary activities aimed at conversion. He has not even mentioned
> eminent Christian scholars such as Bede Griffiths, Klaus Klostermaier,
> Abhishiktananda, Sara Grant, Amalorpavadas, Amaloor, Raimundo
> Panikkar, M. M. Thomas etc. whose contributions to Indian thought are
> well-known.
>
> 6. Arun Shourie has not taken into account the lead given by the
> Second Vatican Council. He has quoted from CBCI documents which were
> only working papers of a seminar but not referred even once to the
> statement^([2](#2)) issued by the CBCI at the end of the seminar.
>
> 7\. Recent Christian thinking on missionary activities has a very
> positive attitude to all the world religions. The primary motive of
> these activities is not conversion. The old mission idea of salvation
> is on the way out.
>
> 8\. Arun Shourie says that missionary activity should be subject to
> public scrutiny. But who will be the scrutinizer? India’s
> parliamentary and judicial systems are in decline. Government of India
> is biased against Christian missions. 
>
> 9\. Conversion movement among Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes and
> some backward communities is simultaneously a protest movement, and
> not necessarily a salvation movement. Hindu society has sections to
> whom social liberation has great appeal. Ambedkar had also led a
> similar protest movement.
>
> 10\. Christian missions are blamed for trouble in the North-East. But
> the trouble is not due to religion; it is politics, the same as in
> Punjab and Kashmir. Why should Arun Shourie choose the North-East in
> particular?
>
> 11\. The question is often asked that if salvation is possible in
> other religions, what is the usefulness of Christian missions? The
> answer at present is that missions witness and express God’s love and
> promote love, justice, peace and human dignity.
>
> 12\. Christianity is 2000 years old in India, while missionary work is
> only 500 years old. For a. long time, the government in India was on
> the side of the missions; yet Christians remain an insignificant
> minority in this country. It should be obvious that Christianity poses
> no threat to Hinduism; yet Christians are being subjected to physical
> attack in all parts of the country, particularly in the Hindi belt.
>
> 13\. The small Christian community, a mere two percent of the total
> population, has made great contributions in the field of education,
> medical help, and care of the poor and the destitute. Christian
> missionaries like myself are always prepared to suffer great hardships
> and travel to distant places in order to render service.
>
> 14\. Even a staunch critic of Christianity like K. M. Panikkar has
> admitted that clauses of the Indian Constitution which pertain to the
> welfare of Scheduled Castes and Tribes, are a Christian contribution.
> There are only a few people who are willing to stand on the side of
> the poor and the marginalised. Gandhi had tried his own experiment but
> failed. What remains now is the Christian missionary experiment.
>
> 15\. Arun Shourie has spared not even Mother Teresa in his book. But
> she is the ideal for a majority of the missionaries. 

Kanjamala ended his critique with a prayer of Mother Teresa, and another
of St. Francis of Assissi.

Arun Shourie developed his rejoinder along the following lines:

> 1\. Christian missionaries have made great contributions in many
> areas. Many missionaries have been dedicated people. Nobody in India’s
> public life is opposed to Christian propagation of faith. Kanjamala
> should not fight battles with imaginary enemies.
>
> 2\. Christians in India are open to a dialogue, unlike the Islamic
> community which has stamped out dialogue by its verbal terrorism. The
> CBCI dignitaries deserve tribute for inviting discussion.
>
> 3\. The book contains quite a few references to the positive
> contributions made by Christian missions. Kanjamala should have read
> the book with greater care. He has misrepresented the book in several
> other instances. He should read again pages so and so.
>
> 4\. Missionary attacks on Hinduism were not mistakes; they were gross
> exaggerations and wholesale distortions made with a purpose. Swami
> Vivekananda and Gandhiji pointed out repeatedly that the motive of
> these attacks was to malign Hinduism. Even so it is admitted that
> these attacks helped to hasten the work of Hindu reformers.
>
> 5\. Hindus by and large did not get converted to Christianity, not
> because the missionaries did not try but because Hindu society has
> always had inner strength.
>
> 6\. It is wrong to say that missionaries could have used state power
> for effecting conversions. The fact is that state power was not
> available to them. By the time British rule became established in
> India, Christians in Europe had become humanised and overt use of
> state power was not allowed for conversions. Islam had used state
> power during its rule. Look at the result. If today the Indian
> Constitution is changed to say that Fundamental Rights guaranteed in
> Chapter Ill are available only to Hindus, you will see Christians and
> Muslims flocking to the Hindu fold.
>
> 7\. Kanjamala says that Arun Shourie has not spared even Mother
> Teresa. But the book does pay handsome tributes to her. Kanjamala’s
> comment, therefore, is not a good example of Christian honesty.
>
> 8\. Kanjamala says that 85% of the Christian priests do not want
> conversion. Yet conversions go on, covert and overt. The book provides
> evidence, not about methods of conversion used in the past but about
> methods which are being used at present.
>
> 9\. It was only when the book was published that Kanjamala started
> proclaiming that the Conference documents reproduced in it were
> confidential. This is dishonest. On the other hand, the document which
> he offers as the final statement, is a whitewashed document. The
> author could have been held guilty if he had published some selected
> passages from the earlier documents. But he has published them in full
> at his own expense. He did so because unlike the “final statement”,
> the earlier ones are candid and straight-forward.
>
> 10\. Citations from old missionary literature are being dismissed by
> Kanjamala as belonging to a bygone age. But the sophisticated slander
> they carried has been internalized by the Indian elite. That is why
> our country stands bewildered today. That literature is, therefore,
> not yet dated. Moreover, Kanjamala’s own articles in the press
> published recently prove that the sophisticated slander continues.
>
> 11\. The book does discuss changes in missionary thinking and cites
> the Conference documents in this connection. Had it dealt with changes
> supposed to have been introduced by people like Bede Griffiths, the
> author would have landed in court on a charge of defamation.
>
> 12\. The current missionary literature contrasts Jesus Christ with
> Rama, Krishna and Mahadeva, and says that while the former died and
> rose on the third day the latter died for good. The author can cite
> what the latest biblical scholarship says about Jesus. But he does not
> want to go into that at present. Even the gospels carry contradictory
> stories about Jesus.
>
> 13\. Kanjamala says that Arun Shourie has a hidden agenda. Arun
> Shourie has no need to hide anything. He says openly that he wants to
> save the country from the sweet poison which missionaries are
> spreading about Hindus Shastras, Hindu Gods and Goddesses, and Hindu
> Avatars. How would Kanjamala feel if somebody wrote the same way about
> Jesus and Mary Magdalene?
>
> 14\. The world has to be grateful to Pope John for bringing back
> compassion in the Christian doctrine. But the CBCI Secretary’s Report
> views this change with great concern. The Report mourns that the new
> doctrine has killed the motive for missionary work, namely,
> conversions. The Church in India finds it difficult to accept the
> change.
>
> 15\. The fact is that the change has been brought about by the
> collapse of Christian belief due to progress of science and
> technology. The some thing has happened to Marxism. Islam is bound to
> meet the same fate.
>
> 16\. Kanjamala refers to the Nazi persecution of Jews. It is, however,
> Christians who have persecuted Jews for 2000 years. That was because,
> by an act of fraud, the gospels shifted the responsibility for killing
> Jesus from Pontius Pilate to the Jews.
>
> 17\. When the book refers to missionary subversion in the North-East,
> it quotes not some RSS source but a report of the Joint Intelligence
> Committee of the Government of India. The author has changed only the
> names of places and persons mentioned in the report. But the means and
> methods employed by the missions come out clearly. Kanjamala’s own
> articles say how they are alienating converts in the North-East from
> the rest of India.
>
> 18\. Christian missions claim that they have brought about a change in
> the social status of converts. But the CBCI’s own report admits that
> there has been no change, and discrimination against Dalit Christians
> continues in the Church. Christian missionaries are now agitating for
> reservations for Dalit converts. All that the missions have succeeded
> in doing is to spread abominable superstitions among the Harijans and
> tribals.
>
> 19\. Christian scholarship is quite mischievous. It has distorted
> India’s history. For instance, the national heroes of the 1857
> rebellion against British rule are being presented as villains. This
> scholarship says that tribals are not Hindus. People should read the
> discussion in Census reports about how to describe the tribals. There
> was a deliberate attempt to name them as non-Hindus by inventing new
> terms like “animists” etc. Christian missionaries are continuing the
> fraud. The same method was used by missionaries like Macauliffe to
> separate Sikhs from Hindus. Ambedkar also fell into the missionary
> trap in respect untouchables when he demanded separate electorates for
> them. Kanjamala gives the recent example of Hindus converting to
> Buddhism at Patna. He does not mention the quarrel that arose when it
> was discovered that the show had been financed by a Christian group.
> Christian missions happen to be patrons of people like Rajasekhara
> Chetty and Kanshi Ram, and the poison they emit.
>
> 20\. Kanjamala claims that Christian missions are working for the
> welfare of tribals. But when Sarvodaya workers or the RSS starts
> welfare activities such as schools in the tribal areas, the
> missionaries are up in arms. The fact is that they are not bothered
> about welfare of any people. All they are trying to do is to find a
> new home for Christianity in the poor countries because Christianity
> has collapsed in Europe and North America. Modernization has
> bankrupted the Church everywhere. That is why the Church is worried
> over untouchability dying out in India. 
>
> 21\. Christian missionaries should be honest when they try to convert
> anyone. The person should be informed about what the latest biblical
> scholarship says about Jesus Christ. He is no longer an historical
> figure. The convert should not be kept in the dark about the
> rationalist critique of Christianity and the Bible. Otherwise the
> convert is bound to suffer from tension when he or she learns the true
> facts later on.

Arun Shourie ended his answer by examining the prayers d by Kanjamala.
He found them full of “our”, “I” and “me”, meaning the Church and the
Christians. Why pray for only one community? Why not for all people? The
Upanishad prayers, he said, breath a different, a universal spirit.

There were some questions at the end. Kanjamala repeated the same
arguments as earlier, though in a different way. Arun Shourie fixed him
again with new quotations from missionary literature, and more facts
about missionary work.

While I prepared for publication Arun Shourie’s encounter with
Kanjamala,^([3](#3)) I noticed a few weaknesses in the former’s
argument.

Firstly, a Hindu does not have to subscribe to the negative-positive
syndrome in respect of the work of Christian missions. There can be
nothing positive about poison which is what Christian missions have been
and remain. One need not subscribe to Mahatma Gandhi’s preposition that
Christian missions quickened Hindu conscience and expedited Hindu reform
movements. Hindus had been reforming and renewing their society long
before Christianity was born, and did not have to wait for Christian
missions to stand up and perform. Moreover, the reform movements
inspired by Christian missions have only derailed Hindu society and made
it ape the Christian-Western model.

Secondly, Hindus are not called upon to do homage to a Christian hoax
like Mother Teresa. She is a synthetic product manufactured by Christian
media power and prize-distribution devices. All she has done is to
portray Hindu society in nasty and negative colours. It is time that
Hindus see through the humbug.

Thirdly, the Christian attempt to date its historical record should be
viewed in the context of Christian dogma which has created that record.
So long as the dogma remains constant, the record cannot be dated, no
matter how soft the new verbiage happens to be. The Christian argument
that old missionary writings should be overlooked as belonging to a
bygone age, is absolutely phoney.

Fourthly, there is no evidence that Pope John or the Second Vatican
Council brought back compassion in the Christian doctrine. The statement
implies that the Christian doctrine did have compassion to start with
and had lost it at some stage. This is not true. The doctrine was cruel
and aggressive at its very birth. Pope John can at best be credited with
realism which made him see the collapse of Christianity in the West, and
give a call for change of tactics so that Christianity could secure
another home.

Meanwhile, another musketeer of the Christian Mission in India was
trying to engage Arun Shourie into another duel. Vishal Mangalwadi with
headquarters in Mussoorie, U.P., wrote ten letters to the author of
*Missionaries in India* between 8 August 1994 and 21 September 1995.
Arun Shourie glanced at the first letter and consigned it to where it
belonged - the waste-paper basket. The others that followed remained
unopened and met the same fate. He had better things to do than go
through the garbage collected by a professional practitioner of
*suppressio veri suggestion falsi*. Mangalwadi published his letters in
the form of a book in early 1996. “I had hoped,” he mourned, “that Mr.
Shourie would reply to my letters, so that eventually we could publish
our dialogue - perhaps jointly. However, since he chose not to, these
letters are now placed before the reader as a monologue.”^([4](#4))

In his ‘letters’, Mangalwadi tries to look very learned. He consumes a
lot of verbiage but says very little. He cites many books like his own,
and drops any number of names which nobody except his own tribe has ever
heard. He also advertises that he has been on frequent trips abroad, and
spoken on varied subjects in different countries. But none of it is
likely to impress the reader who knows what the whole-time hirelings of
Christian missions are doing normally and non-stop - spilling ink,
trotting the globe, and blowing hot air - while dwelling on the one and
only theme, namely, that Christianity has a monopoly over Truth with
capital T. “God has revealed the Truth,” says Mangalwadi, “in His Word
(the Bible).” Those who have read the Bible with the eyes of European
Enlightenment, can only comment that Jehovah does not cease to be the
Devil he is simply by being labelled as God, and that-the most wicked
book known to the history of mankind does not cease to be so simply by
being sold as ‘His Word’.

For the rest, Mangalwadi’s 524-page monologue can be summarized in a few
sentences. He wants us to believe that the Christian missions have been,
and remain, “a conspiracy to bless India”, and that the atrocities to
which this country was subjected during the British rule should be
blamed on people like Clive. It is the same stereotyped song which a
whole tribe of Christian scribes has been singing over the last several
decades in order to salvage Christianity from its horrible history. But
unfortunately for the tribe, the history of Christianity and its
missions everywhere has been documented in great detail by Western
scholars. What is more, in days not very distant, the hawkers of “the
only saviour” have themselves chronicled their gory deeds with
considerable pride. These first-hand accounts leave little doubt that
Christian missionaries were the most criminal elements in the colonial
establishments of the West, and that the teaching which activated them
came from Jesus Christ. Secular colonialists like Clive had caused only
physical injuries to the conquered people, and robbed them merely of
material wealth. The soldiers of Jesus Christ, on the other hand,
uprooted their victims from the latter’s spiritual habitat, and deprived
them of their souls. Mangalwadi himself is an excellent example of what
happens when a Hindu embraces Christianity.

A word about the jargon with which Mangalwadi starts his exercise. He
dismisses Arun Shourie by pigeon-holing him as ‘post-modern’. He does
not know that Hinduism has its own view of Time, and that a person who
serves Sanatana Dharma cannot be dated. Scholars like Arun Shourie
belong neither to the past, nor to the present, nor yet to the future.
They belong to a timeless span. By the same logic the history of
Christianity cannot become dated so long as its basic theology remains
intact. It is no use changing verbiage. What needs changing is the
dogma, namely, that Jesus Christ is the one and only saviour.

documents as “draft report” and to the statement as the “revised and
