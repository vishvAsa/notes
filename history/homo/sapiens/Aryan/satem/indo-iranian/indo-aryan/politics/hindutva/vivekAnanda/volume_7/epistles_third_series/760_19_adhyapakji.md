NEW YORK,  
*4th May, 1894*.

DEAR ADHYAPAKJI (Prof. John Henry Wright),

I have received your kind note just now. And it is unnecessary for me to
say that I will be very happy to do as you say.

I have also received Col. Higginson's letter. I will reply to him.

I will be in Boston on Sunday \[May 6\]. On Monday I lecture at the
Women's Club of Mrs. Howe.

Yours ever truly,  
VIVEKANANDA.
