> An Additional Membership is, as I view it, no sop or gag intended to stop honest and fair criticism. But if it is, I should 
certainly give it up rather than consent to draw the curtain over 
the gross negligence or the palpable errors of officials, however 
high they may be.

On August 7th, 1895, Mr. Tilak, elected by an overwhelming majority by the District Local Boards 
of the Central Division, took, in the Legislative 
Council, the customary oath of allegiance to Her Ma- 
jesty, the Queen-Empress. Two years later he was 
standing as an under-trial prisoner in the High Court 
of Judicature, to be punished of disaffection, in spite 
of his protests and in anticipation of a new interpre- 
tation of the term ! The first event did not ensnare 
him, nor was his Hfe-work paralysed by the second. 

During the course of these two years, the Council 
met for 8 ' long ' days and worked for less than 36 
hours. As usual pertinent interpellations were asked 
to which pertinent or impertinent answers were re- 
turned. The discussion on the financial statement 
occupied much time. And the residue was devoted 
to the following questions : — 

I. The Bombay Civil Courts Act, 1869 Amendment 
Bill. 



THE HONOURABLE AND 1 79 

2. The Rules for conducting the business of the 
Council. 

3. A Bill to amend the Karachi Port Trust Act, 1886 

(withdrawn). 

4. A Bill to amend the Bombay Boiler Inspection 
Act, 1891. 

5. A Bill to amend the Bombay General Clauses Act, 

1886. 

6. A Bill to amend Act VIII of 1870 (an act for the 
prevention of the murder of female infants). 

7. A Bill to further amend the City of Bombay 

Municipal Act, 1888. 
A barren epoch, to be sure ! Under the regime of 
the Morley-Minto Reforms, members could at least 
spread, peacock-like, the glorious plumage of their 
knowledge and oratory. They could at least show off 
their grasp of economic problems and administrative 
details and could count upon moral effect of their 
work, — moral effect, not certainly upon the Bureau- 
cracy but upon their countrymen. But in the Coun- 
cils established under the Act of 1892, neither actual 
nor moral effect was possible. Amendments, here and 
there, of the Government Bills and a desultory discus- 
sion on the Budget, after " it had ceased to be a Bud- 
get " and " had been sanctioned by the Government 
of India " — that was all that could be done. Even 
the Bureaucracy confessed that the " examination of 
the contents of the Budget was little better than a 
post-mortem dissection "; and though Mr. Tilak re- 
torted by pointing out that " we could as well dissect 
a living as a dead Budget," stiU he had to submit to 
the inevitable. Under the flow of smooth and cour- 



80 LOKAMANYA TILAK 

teous words, the representatives of the Bureaucracy 
hardly failed to be sarcastic and overbearing. Mem- 
bers like the Hon. Mr. Sayani, who read carefully pre- 
pared manuscript speeches were " respectfully " re- 
quested to save their " physical labour " of reading 
them, by submitting to the Council printed copies^ 
which " might then be taken as read." The Hon. 
Messrs. Javerilal and Setalwad were blamed for turn- 
ing the Council into a " Circus," in which annually they 
were " wont to trot out their hobby horses." With 
such limitation and environments, it was natural that 
the output of the work of the representatives of the 
people was dis-appointingly small. Equally with his 
University fellowship* or the Municipal Councillorship, 
Mr. Tilak's membership of the Legislative Council failed 
to add one inch to his worth or one grain to his use- 
fulness. It was simply a trifling accident of his life. 

In several respects, Mr. Tilak possessed many of the 
qualities that go to make a great legislator. He had 
in him that unique combination of the idealist and the 
realist which is the sine qua non of a successful law- 
giver. His grasp of general principles, his mastery 
over petty and intricate details, his patience in investi- 
gation, his breadth of vision, his legal acumen, ready 
wit and resourceful intellect — all these qualities would 
have taken his name down to posterity as the maker of 

* In January 1894, Mr. Tilak was elected a fellow of th® 
Bombay University. In May 1895, he headed the poll at the 
genarai elections to the Poona City Municipality. He resigned 
his msmjers'lip of the City Municipality in 1897. After his 
convictijn {iS)j) he was deprived of his University fellov, ship 
by the Government of Bombay salutary laws. But like Sir Pherozeshah, he too was 
destined to play the role of a mere critic of the ad- 
ministration. 

THE HONOURABLE AND ! 8l 


In spite of the limitations imposed upon his usefulness, 
Mr. Tilak worked in the Council with his usual ardour. 
Conscious though he was that all his criticism would 
very little affect the actual working of the admi- 
nistration, he wanted to put the whole Bureaucratic 
machine under his intellectual microscope. He was 
not content, therefore, with copies of the Financial 
Statement and of the Budget but called for the Advo- 
cate-General's Budget Notes. But the officials did not 
consider it worth their while to grant his request. Ap- 
parently they thought that the Budget which formed 
*' a printed document of close upon 200 pages " and the 
financial statement which fitted " a pamphlet of 
fair dimensions and touched on every head, whe- 
ther of revenue or expenditure," ought to satisfy 
Mr. Tilak. 

The originality of his genius showed itself in the 
Council. Not satisfied like other speakers with merely 
comparing the year's (1895-96) Budget with the Revised 
Estimates of 1894-95 and the Actuals of 1893-94, he 
proceeded to consider it in a true scientific spirit by 
examining " how far the revenue has increased during 
the last 25 years and what portion of it has been devoted 
to the material development of the Province." This 
led to the conclusion that " the revenue of the Presi- 
dency has increased by about 5| crores of rupees during 
the last 25 years. Land, Forest, Abkari have all been 
made yield as much as possible even to the inconve- 
nience of the people i and yet out of the revenues so 
6 



82 LOKAMANYA TILAK 

realised only a small portion has been devoted to the 
material improvements of the Province.*' ^ 

Mr. Tilak was not afraid to beard the Hon in his own 
den. Referring to the cess on Ahkari revenue, recently 
commuted, he asked whether " Government by an Exe- 
cutive act can repeal an Act of the Legislature." It 
was impossible for the Government members to dis- 
lodge him from his positions, nor did they dare hurl at 
him their arrows of ridicule or banter. Unlike many 
members of the Council, he was extremely sparing of 
compliments to the Official Members. He never gave 
praise, he never sought it. His speeches were severely 
impersonal and unrhetorical, studded with facts, mas- 
terly handled. What struck his hearers was the breadth 
and originality of his view-point and the facility with 
which he strode through the intricacies of statistics. 
The success of his speeches lay in the luminous way in 
which he used figures without quoting them frequently. 
This was the case with his writings also. 

Mr. Tilak 's short connection with the Legislative 
Council came to an end in 1897, when he resigned his 
seat, (after the criminal prosecution for sedition had been 
launched against him.) Among his colleagues in the 
Council, were the Hon. (Sir) Chimanlal H. Setalwad, the 
late Sir P. M. Mehta and the late Mr. Daji Abaji Khare. 

The year 1896-97 deserves to be recorded in shining 
letters of gold in the life of Mr. Tilak, because it brings 
out in bold relief that quality of his heart, which, though 
it forms the basis of his character, is generally over- 
looked by superficial observers, dazzled by his militant 
personaUty — we mean his genuine philanthrophy. 
Great as was the intellect of Mr. Tilak, his heart was 



THE HONOURABLE AND I 83 

greater still. The terrible famine and distress of 1877 
moved him as nothing else did and was, as we have seen 
mainly responsible for fixing the course of his life. The 
outbreak of famine and the irruption of the plague in 
this year (1896-97) shocked him and he knew no rest 
while labouring for the suffering thousands. Those 
who saw him at work during this eventful period 
recognised how his very soul was on fire. 

In ordinary times and under normal circumstances 
popular aid and co-operation on occassions of famine or 
epidemics are welcome to Government. But in the 
peculiar circumstances of India, such co-operation is 
sometimes discouraged by the Bureaucrats who con- 
sider the masses as their own property and would keep 
them from the * evil ' influence of the educated classes. 
When terrible famine broke out in 1896, Mr. Tilak 
was the centre of all popular activities directed towards 
the mitigation of every kind of suffering. Lord 
Elgin, the then Viceroy was busy with his round of 
visits to Indian States, the lesser European Officials 
were indifferent and apathetic and the Indian Officers 
like the Mamlatdars were, as usual, more desirous of 
collecting the revenue anyhow and of being patted on 
the back by their superiors, than of doing their duty by 
the poor ryots. The Missionaries had their own axe to 
grind. The public opinion in England was in the be- 
ginning ignorant of the terrible state of things. Later 
on, it was roused enough and some help to the famine- 
stricken was offered. But the Indian Government was 
at first rather unwilling to accept it. 

Mr. Tilak's programme included 4 items, (i) He sent 
round the presidency his lieutenants to collect informa- 



84 LOKAMANYA TILAK 

tion regarding famine conditions. His obect was to 
check the inacuracies of the reports submitted by Mam- 
latdars to their superiors. (2) These heutenants dis- 
cussed measures of rehef with local leaders, with a view 
to formulate constructive suggestions to Government. 
The Government had no doubt the guidance of the 
Famine Relief Code ; but evidently Mr. Tilak had greater 
faith in local bodies and leaders. The next two items 
concerned the people more directly. (3) It usually 
happened that most of the villagers, ignorant of the 
concessions promised by the Relief Code, sold away 
their lands or cattle to pay off the Government dues ; 
Mr. Tilak's * emissaries ', therefore, acquainted the 
people with their rights, explained the relevant sections 
of the Relief Code and distributed leaflets or pamphlets 
containing abstracts of the important sections of the 
Relief Code. (4) Having thus educated the people in 
the knowledge of their rights, they asked them not to 
be cowards and not to pay the Government dues at the 
cost of their lives or property. It will be seen that the 
agitation imparted the necessary knowledge to the peo- 
ple and exhorted them to show manliness ; and by con- 
structive suggestions it compelled the Government to 
insist on accuracy of reports and strict enforcement of 
rules. Week after week, the Kesari devoted all its 
columns to the discussion of the situation ; " Will you " 
Mr. Tilak passionately asked, "when the Queen desires 
that none should die, when the Governor declares that all 
should 1 ve and the Secretary of State is prepared to go 
in for debt, if necessary — will you kill yourself by timi- 
dity and starvation ? If you have money to pay Govern- 
ment dues, pay them by all means. But if you have 



THE HONOURABLE AND ! 85 

not, will you sell your things away only to avoid the 
supposed wrath of subordinate Government officers ? 
Can you not be bold, even when in the grip of death ?*' 
This terrible unmanliness shocked him most. " We 
can stand any number of famines," he said " but what 
shall we do, with sheepish people ?" " Had such a 
famine broken out in England and had the Prime 
Minister been as apathetic as is Lord Elgin, his Govern- 
ment would have, in less than a week, tumbled down 
like ninepins." He deplored and condemned food- 
riots. " Why loot the Bazars ", he used to say " go 
to the Collector and tell him to give you work and food. 
That is his duty." 

Really speaking the Government ought He have 
hailed the vigorous co-operation of Mr. Tilak. He was 
making useful and constructive suggestions to them, 
through the memorials of the Sarvajanik Sabha and the 
columns of the Kesari and the Mahratta. But it was 
evident that the heaven-born Bureaucrats disliked the 
splendid growth of organisation under Mr. Tilak 's in- 
spiring guidance, because the * new spirit ' meant in- 
convenience to them. They found the plastic clay 
hardening into rock. The people were firm, not mili- 
tant ; law abiding, not aggressive, still the authorities 
deemed it necessary to put down the New Spirit. 

The first attempt in this direction was made at a 
village Khattalwad (Dec. 13, 1896) where Prof. Sathe, of 
the Maharashtra College, Poona, specially sent by Mr. 
Tilak for propaganda work, had the unique honour and 
opportunity of delivering a lecture in the presence of 
the Assistant Collector and a posse of soldiers. This 
evidently was an attempt to reduce the morale of the 



86 LOKAMANYA TILAK 

people and to cow down the lecturer. But the attempt 
failed and Prof. Sathe made a spirited lecture in spite of 
the intimidation conveyed by the presence of an armed 
force. Prof. Sathe was tried at Alibag for abetting 
several Forest and Abkari offences. The prosecution 
failed. It was soon followed by another. This time 
the victims were three gentlemen of Thana, who had 
done public service by issuing a leaflet in which provi- 
sions of the Famine Code were explained. This pro- 
secution too was a fiasco. In the next prosecution, a 
Mr. Apte was convicted and sentenced to simple impri- 
sonment for one year ; and soon after, the Sarvajanik 
Sabha which had led the agitation for the mitigation of 
the suffering caused by the famine was, on some flimsy 
pretext, declared to have forfeited its right to petition, 
tke Government. 

Of all the agitations led by Mr. Tilak, this one was 
the most systematic and organised. It was an agita- 
tion which all men understood, which allowed very 
little room for party squabbles, and which the Govern- 
ment was afraid to put down. Combining the strength 
of simplicity and unity and suffering from little opposition^ 
it became irresistible. It opened a new vista before 
Mr. Tilak. He saw immense possibilities in such well- 
organised agitations ; and he wanted the Congress to 
undertake an agitation, that would reach even the most 
distant hamlet. Upto this time, Mr. Tilak was satis- 
fied with — or rather he acquiesced in — the methods of 
Congrss leaders. But now he wanted a radical change. 
Referring to the proceedings of the 12th Congress 
held at Calcutta he said : {Kesari, January 12th, 1896) 

" For the last twelve years we have been shouting 



THE HONOURABLE AND ! 87 

hoarse, desiring that the Government should hear us. 
But our shouting has no more affected the Government 
than the sound of a gnat. Our rulers disbeheve our 
statements or profess to do so. Let us now try to 
force our grievances into their ears by strong constitu- 
tional means. We must give the best political educa- 
tion possible to the ignorant villagers. We must meet 
them on terms of equality, teach them their rights and 
show how to fight constitutionally. Then only will the 
Government realise that to despise the Congress is to 
despise the Indian Nation. Then only will the efforts 
of the Congress leaders be crowned with success. Such 
a work will require a large body of able and single- 
minded workers, to whom Politics would not mean 
some holiday recreation but an every-day duty to be 
performed with strictest regularity and utmost capa- 
city." 

Closely in the heels of the Famine followed the Plague 
which has till now exacted the heavy toll of one crore 
of Indian lives. The feU nature of the disease 
and its sudden irruption created a consternation which 
was aggravated by the helplessness of the medical 
science in arresting its spread. The medical advisers 
of the Government failed, at first, to take any serious 
notice of the disease and when at last its looming sha- 
dow terrified the European nations and it became 
evident that not only had the plague become really 
virulent but also threatened to scare away European 
trade, strictest sanitary measures were devised to stem 
its tide. But trouble arose in the execution of these 
measures. Actuated, no doubt, by an earnest desire 

o stamp out this unwelcome guest in minimum time. 



88 LOKAMANYA TILAK 

the Government officers rigorously enforced measures 
for the safety of the people. They however failed to 
temper their rigour by enlisting popular sympathy. 
They neither sought public support and co-operation 
nor did they welcome it when spontaneously offered. 
Such benevolent execution of precautionary measures 
required a higher type of imagination than the Bureau- 
crants could command and while men like Lord San- 
dhurst sincerely wished the least interference with the 
conveniences of the people, the plague measures actually 
created greater terror than the epidemic itself. 

To save themselves from the epidemic, many so- 
called leaders of the people left Poona to a safer retreat. 
But Mr. Tilak did not do so. He stood by the suffering 
multitude, shared their misfortunes, helped them, 
started a Plague Hospital and did his best to interpret 
the difficulties of the people to the Government and the 
wishes of the Government to the people. The conduct 
of Mr. Tilak in thus co-operating with the Government 
was strongly criticised by many of the followers of 
Ranade and insinuations were recklessly made that the 
Lion of Poona was ensnared by the additional member- 
ship of the Legislative Council. The time soon came 
when the pseudo-lions of Poona humiliated themselves 
before the British Lion, while Mr. Tilak refused to be 
cowed down by the terrors of repression. 

For an effective crusade against the Plague, the re- 
lief work was taken — without any semblance of law 
or justice — out of the hands of the Municipality and was 
continued by a special body, called the Plague Commit- 
tee, a purely European association headed by the '* sul- 
len and suspicious " Mr. Rand. With the name of this 



THE HONOURABLE AND ! 89 

self-willed, unsympathetic and unlucky administrator 
is associated the segration-work, with its inevitable 
corollary of the house-to-house search-parties. Afraid 
and terror-stricken, the people were, it was thought, 
unwilling to communicate to the proper authorities 
plague-attacks of inmates in their houses or to allow 
their ailing relatives to be taken for treatment to the 
hospitals. But the administrators of the plague- 
policy never put themselves the question " Why." Mr. 
Tilak showed how " as soon as a patient is removed to 
the hospital, his relations are taken to the segregation 
camp, some of the infected property is destroyed and 
his house is kept " practically " open without anybody 
to take care of the property." He also pointed out 
that people were more ready to send patients to the 
hospital started by him and to pay for them than allow 
them to be taken to the Government Hospital, which 
was a charitable institution. The question resolved 
itself into " how to make the work popular " and with 
this end in view he made a number of constructive sugges- 
tions. But it was not in the nature of the officers ap- 
pointed, to appreciate the popular view-point and ac- 
cept suggestions, most of which they could have adopt- 
ed without sacrificing the essentials of their policy. 
Even then trouble could have been avoided, had the 
British soldiers not been appointed to conduct the 
searches. Mr. Tilak held that " howsoever a British 
soldier may be useful on the battlefield, he is not suited 
for a work of this kind " and suggested that the work 
** can be equally, if not more efficiently, carried on by 
native agency working under Civil Officers than by 
British soldiers whose ignorance of native manners 



go LOKAMANYA TILAK 

very often leads them to unnecessarily offend the 
susceptibilities of the people." But this advice was 
unheeded. 

It is unnecessary to dwell here upon what wab rightly 
or wrongly described as the "reign of terror " at Poona 
and its echoes in England, so sadly associated with the 
name of Prof. (aften\^ards Hon. Mr.) Gokhale whose 
statements regarding the outrages made by British sol- 
diers exasperated the Government and who immediate- 
ly on his return to India was induced to tender an "ab- 
ject '* apology and withdraw not only those charges 
which for want of evidence he could not substantiate, 
but all his criticism regarding the plague measures. 
For a time the Plague subsided but the discontent its 
administration had aroused, emboldened one fanatic 
to seek redress in the murder of Mr. Rand. The 
name of this fanatic was Damodar Chapekar, who 
after a number of unsuccessful attempts to track 
Mr. Rand at last got hold of him, on the night of 
June 22, 1897, when Mr. Rand was returning from 
the Government House where he had gone to 
attend the celebration of the Diamond Jubilee 
of Her Majesty the Queen Victoria's accession to 
the throne. In the darkness of night, Chapekar 
shot Mr. Rand dead. His accomplice heard an 
exclamation from the carriage which Lieutenant 
Ayerst was riding and " thinking possibly that they 
were discovered " killed Lieutenant Ayerst also ! These 
shocking murders created an atmosphere of panic and 
consternation which was cleverly exploited by Mr. 
Tilak's enemies to induce the Government to embark 
on a campaign of repression. 



THE HONOURABLE AND ! Qt 

The "panacea " to plague was soon discovered in the 
'* innoculation." Mr. Tilak frankly disbelieved in the 
efficacy of a remedy which required the injection of a 
poison at every visitation of the plague. He com- 
plained of the low vitality of the people, due to poverty 
and starvation, and declared that unless that was re- 
medied, such epidemics were bound to recur. Partly 
as a result of Mr. Tilak's opposition, the Government 
were wise enough not to resort to compulsion with res- 
pect to inoculation. They simply tried to make it 
" popular by various means."
