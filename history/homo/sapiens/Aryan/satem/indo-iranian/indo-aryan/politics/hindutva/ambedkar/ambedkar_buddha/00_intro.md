> **INTRODUCTION**
>
> Indications of a growth in the volume of interest in Buddhism are
> noticeable in some sections of the Indian people. Along with it there
> is naturally a growing demand for a clear and consistent statement of
> the life and teachings of the Buddha.
>
> Anyone who is not a Buddhist finds it extremely difficult to present
> the life and teachings of the Buddha in a manner which would make it a
> consistent whole. Depending on the **Nikaya**s, not only the
> presentation of a consistent story of the life of the Buddha becomes a
> difficult thing and the presentation of some parts of his teachings
> becomes much more so. Indeed it would not be an exaggeration to say
> that of all the founders of religions in the world, the presentation
> of the life and teachings of the founder of Buddhism presents a
> problem which is quite puzzling if not baffling. Is it not necessary
> that these problems should be solved, and the path for the
> understanding of Buddhism be made clear? Is it not time that those who
> are Buddhists should take up these problems, at least for general
> discussion, and throw what light they can on these problems?
>
> With a view to raise a discussion on these problems, I propose to set
> them out here. The first problem relates to the main event in the life
> of the Buddha, namely, Parivraja. Why did the Buddha take Parivraja?
> The traditional answer is that he took Parivraja because he saw a dead
> person, a sick person and an old person. This answer is absurd on the
> face of it. The Buddha took Parivraja at the age of 29. If he took
> Parivraja as a result of these three sights, how is it he did not see
> these three sights earlier? These are common events occurring by
> hundreds, and the Buddha could not have failed to come across them
> earlier. It is impossible to accept the traditional explanation that
> this was the first time he saw them. The explanation is not plausible
> and does not appeal to reason. But if this is not the answer to the
> question, what is the real answer?
>
> The second problem is created by the four Aryan Truths. Do they form
> part of the original teachings of the Buddha? This formula cuts at the
> root of Buddhism. If life is sorrow, death is sorrow, and rebirth is
> sorrow, then there is an end of everything. Neither religion nor
> philosophy can help a man to achieve happiness in the world. If there
> is no escape from sorrow, then what can religion do, what can Buddha
> do, to relieve man from such sorrow which is ever there in birth
> itself? The four Aryan Truths are a great stumbling block in the way
> of non-Buddhists accepting the gospel of Buddhism. For the four Aryan
> Truths deny hope to man. The four Aryan Truths make the gospel of the
> Buddha a gospel of pessimism. Do they form part of the original
> gospel, or are they a later accretion by the monks?
>
> The third problem relates to the doctrines of soul, of karma and
> rebirth. The Buddha denied the existence of the soul. But he is also
> said to have affirmed the doctrine of karma and rebirth. At once a
> question arises. If there is no soul, how can there be karma? If there
> is no soul, how can there be rebirth? These are baffling questions. In
> what sense did the Buddha use the words karma and rebirth? Did he use
> them in a different sense than the sense in which they were used by
> the Brahmins of his day? If so, in what sense? Did he use them in the
> same sense in which the Brahmins used them? If so, is there not a
> terrible contradiction between the denial of the soul and the
> affirmation of karma and rebirth? This contradiction needs to be
> resolved.
>
> The fourth problem relates to the Bhikkhu. What was the object of the
> Buddha in creating the Bhikkhu? Was the object to create a perfect
> man? Or was his object to create a social servant devoting his life to
> service of the people and being their friend, guide and philosopher?
> This is a very real question. On it depends the future of Buddhism. If
> the Bhikkhu is only a perfect man he is of no use to the propagation
> of Buddhism, because though a perfect man he is a selfish man. If, on
> the other hand, he is a social servant, he may prove to be the hope of
> Buddhism. This question must be decided not so much in the interest of
> doctrinal consistency but in the interest of the future of Buddhism.
>
> If I may say so, the pages of the journal of the Mahabodhi Society
> make, to me at any rate, dull reading. This is not because the
> material presented is not interesting and instructive. The dullness is
> due to the fact that it seems to fall upon a passive set of readers.
> After reading an article, one likes to know what the reader of the
> journal has to say about it. But the reader never gives out his
> reaction. This silence on the part of the reader is a great
> discouragement to the writer. I hope my questions will excite the
> readers to come and make their contribution to their solution.

> **PROLOGUE**
>
> "From time to time men find themselves forced to reconsider current
> and inherited beliefs and ideas, to gain some harmony between present
> and past experience, and to reach a position which shall satisfy the
> demands of feeling and reflexion and give confidence for facing the
> future. If, at the present day, religion, as a subject of critical or
> scientific inquiry, of both practical and theoretical significance has
> attracted increasing attention, this can be ascribed to (a) the rapid
> progress of scientific knowledge and thought; (b) the deeper
> intellectual interest in the subject; (c) the widespread tendencies in
> all parts of the world to reform or reconstruct religion, or even to
> replace it by some body of thought, more 'rational' and 'scientific'
> or less 'superstitious'; and (d) the effect of social, political, and
> international events of a sort which, in the past, have both
> influenced and been influenced by religion. Whenever the ethical or
> moral value of activities or conditions is questioned, the value of
> religion is involved; and all deep-stirring experiences invariably
> compel a reconsideration of the most fundamental ideas, whether they
> are explicitly religious or not. Ultimately there arise problems of
> justice, human destiny, God, and the universe; and these in turn
> involve problems of the relation between 'religious' and other ideas,
> the validity of ordinary knowledge, and practicable conceptions of
> 'experience' and 'reality'."
