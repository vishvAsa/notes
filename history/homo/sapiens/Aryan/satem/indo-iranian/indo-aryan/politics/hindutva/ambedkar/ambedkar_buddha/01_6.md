> § 1. His Contemporaries
>
>  1. At the time when Gautama took Parivraja, there was a great
> intellectual ferment in the country. Besides the Brahmanic Philosophy
> there were as many as sixty-two different schools of philosophy, all
> opposed to the Brahmanic Philosophy. Of them at least six were worthy
> of attention.  
>  2. Of these schools of philosophy there was one headed by *Purana
> Kassappa*. His doctrine was known as *Akriyavada*. He maintained that
> the soul was not affected in any way by *Karma*. One may do, or one
> may get things done. One may do injury, or one may get someone to
> kill. One may commit theft or dacoity \[=highway robbery\], or one may
> get theft or dacoity committed; one may commit adultery, or one may
> get adultery committed; one may tell a lie, or one may get a lie told.
> Nothing affects the soul. An act, however licentious, does not affect
> the soul with sin. An act, however good, does not bring merit to the
> soul. Nothing has any *Kriya* (result) on the soul. When a person
> dies, all the elements of which he is made join in their originals.
> Nothing survives after death, neither body nor soul.  
>  3. Another school of thought was known as *Niyativada*. Its chief
> propounder was *Makhali Ghosal*. His doctrine was a kind of fatalism
> or determinism. He taught that no one can do anything or undo
> anything. Things happen. No one can make them happen. No one can
> remove unhappiness, increase it, or diminish it. One must undergo
> one's share of the experiences of the world.  
>  4. The third school was known as *Ucchedavada*. Its chief
> propounder was *Ajit Kesakambal*. His doctrine was a kind of
> *Annihilism*. He taught that there was nothing in *Yajna*, *Haom*;
> there is no such thing as the fruits or effects of deeds to be enjoyed
> or suffered by the soul. There is neither heaven nor hell. Man is made
> up of certain elements of unhappiness in the world. The soul cannot
> escape it. Whatever sorrow or unhappiness there was in the world, the
> soul cannot escape. This sorrow or unhappiness will come to an end
> automatically. The soul must undergo rebirth during eighty-four lakhs
> \[=hundred thousands\] of cycles of Mahakalpas. Then only the sorrow
> and unhappiness of the soul will end, not before nor by any other
> means.  
>  5. The fourth school was known as *Annyonyavad*. The head of this
> school was *Pakudha Kacchyana*. He preached that there are seven
> elements which go to make up a being, namely, Prathvi, Apa, Tej, Vayu,
> Sukha, Dukha and the Soul. Each is independent of the other; one does
> not affect the other. They are self-existent, and they are eternal.
> Nothing can destroy them. If any one chops off the head of man, he
> does not kill him. All that happens is that the weapon has entered the
> seven elements.  
>  6. *Sanjaya Belaputta* had his own school of philosophy. It was
> known as *Vikshepavada*, a kind of scepticism. He argued, "if anyone
> asked me is there heaven, if I feel there was I would say yes. But if
> I feel there was no heaven I would say no. If I am asked whether human
> beings are created, whether man has to suffer the fruits of his action
> whether good or bad, and whether the soul lives after death, I say nay
> to all these because I don't think they exist. This is how Sanjaya
> Belaputta summed up his doctrine.  
>  7. The sixth school of philosophy was known as
> *Chaturyamsamvarvad*. The head of this school who was alive at the
> time when Gautama was searching for light was *Mahavir*, who was also
> called *Nigantha Nathaputta*. Mahavir taught that the soul had to
> undergo rebirth because of the bad karmas done in the past life and in
> the present life. One must therefore get over the bad, he suggested,
> by *tapascharya*. For preventing the doing of bad karmas in this life
> Mahavira prescribed the observance of chaturyama dharma, i.e.,
> observance of four rule: (1) not to kill; (2) not to steal; (3) not to
> tell a lie; and (4) not to have property, and to observe celibacy.
>
>   
> § 2. His Attitude to His Contemporaries
>
>  1. The Buddha did not accept the teachings of the new
> philosophers.  
>  2. His rejection of their teaching was not without reasons. He
> said that:  
>  3. If the doctrines of *Purana Kassyappa* or *Pakudha Kacchyana*
> were true, then one can do any evil or any harm; one may even go to
> the length of killing another without involving any social
> responsibility or social consequences.  
>  4. If the doctrine of *Makhali Ghosal* is true, then man becomes
> the slave of destiny. He cannot liberate himself.  
>  5. If the doctrine of *Ajit Kesakambal* is true, then all that man
> has to do is to eat, drink and make merry.  
>  6. If the doctrine of *Sanjaya Belaputta* was true, then man must
> float about, and live without a positive philosophy of life.  
>  7. If the doctrine of *Nigantha Nathaputta* was true, then man's
> life must be subjected to Asceticism and Tapascharya, a complete
> subjugation and uprooting of man's instincts and desires.  
>  8. Thus, none of the paths of life suggested by the philosophers
> appealed to the Buddha. He thought they were the thoughts of men who
> had become hopeless, helpless, and reckless. He therefore decided to
> seek light elsewhere.
