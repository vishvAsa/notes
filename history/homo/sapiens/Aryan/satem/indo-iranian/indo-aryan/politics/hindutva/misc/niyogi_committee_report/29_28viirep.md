As Christians we do not recognize caste.

5\. It is our position and belief that people accept Christ
individually.  Many times this is just one individual of a family, but
it may also be more than one member of a family.

7\. The emoluments of Pracharaks are quite low.  No rewards are offered
or given for successful work.

8\. We repudiate the methods cited.  We do not advance loans as baits,
nor promise free education nor medical help nor employment. We feel it
is unfair to insinuate the use of fraudulent and unfair means as in
(m).  We extol Christ and His teachings.

10\. All conversions are the result of religious conviction, unless we
have been deceived.

11\. No, on the contrary it increases national loyalty and outlook. 
Christians respond to Government efforts to vaccinate, many of them know
and sing the national anthem while neighbouring non-Christians do not. 
We constantly urge the support of government.  The Bible says, “Let
every soul be subject unto the higher powers.  For there is no power but
of God; the powers that be are ordained of God.” “Put them in mind to be
subject to principalities and powers, to obey magistrates, to be ready
to every good work.”  “I exhort therefore, that, first of all,
supplications, prayers, in cessions, and giving of thanks, be made for
all men; For kings, and for all that are in authority; that we may lead
a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and honesty.”

12\. Our purpose is to make Christ known.  Jesus said, “Go ye therefore,
and teach all nations.” If a person is converted, it is his own
decision, reached through inner convictions.

13\. At the time of Christ people were offended in Him, His teachings,
preaching and His works.  Today likewise.

15\. As a rule the Pracharaks are respected.  They are usually local
people.

16\. Some Pracharaks are middle school pass, some less, some High
School.  They do not get any rewards.

17\. None are sent to foreign countries for training.

19\. The Bible, the New Testament, portions of the Bible and other
literature based on these.

20\. We do not propagandize, but give information.

21\. None at all.

23\. They pray for the Central and State Governments in India and
constantly urge people to uphold and support the local, provincial and
central Governments.

24\. In a number of places Christians have been reconverted.  It is
reported that in some villages efforts are being made to get Christians
to sign statements by minor Government officials concerning their
religious position.  This intimidates some people.

25\. Communal feelings have been more noticeable since the Inquiry
Commission came.  Before that relations were most cordial.

26\. This is against our Christian beliefs and principles.

27\. We know of none.

29\. Not in politics nor in communal relations, but in medical and
educational work.

economic status.

33\. Yes.

34\. No.

36\. We welcome National Reconstruction efforts.

37\. Christians and missionaries have been encouraged to give and take
part.

39\. Missionaries are members of the church, subject to church
discipline.  Fellowship with Christian and non-Christians in their
homes, such as attendance at and they are received into the homes of
missionaries.

40\. The Christian community is not hostile to Indian traditions and the
best of national culture, and remains Indian and not foreign in its
affinity.

41\. Some social customs are kept when they are not contrary to the
Christian faith.

43\. The General Conference Mennonite Mission has been working in this
area since 1901.  The Roman Catholics and an independent missionary are
also working in this area.

44\. In December 1947, there were 34 missionaries in India.  In December
1954, there are 30.

46\. The foreign Missionaries are of Canadian and American nationality.

47\. Except for specialised work the standard for qualification for
Missionaries is a B.A. degree or its equivalent.  The salary received by
missionaries in India is less than they received before entering
missionary service and is less than they would be receiving if they were
working in the homeland.

48\. None.

51\. By voluntary contributions from members of sister churches
overseas.

52\. Accounts are audited by a selected committee.

57\. (a) Christ said we should preach and teach.  We do not consider
this propaganda, but give information.  
(b) Schools and hospitals.  
(c) Extension work in village uplift through the schools, and public
health work through the hospitals.
