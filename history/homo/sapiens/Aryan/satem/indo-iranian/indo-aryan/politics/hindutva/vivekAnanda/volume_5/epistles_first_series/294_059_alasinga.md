## LIX

BOSTON,  
*23rd March, 1896*.

DEAR ALASINGA,

. . . One of my new Sannyāsins is indeed a woman. . . . The others are
men. I am going to make some more in England and take them over to India
with me. These "white" faces will have more influence in India than the
Hindus; moreover, they are vigorous, the Hindus are *dead*. The only
hope of India is from the masses. The upper classes are physically and
morally dead. . . .

My success is due to my popular style — the greatness of a teacher
consists in the simplicity of his language.

. . . I am going to England next month. I am afraid I have worked too
much; my nerves are almost shattered by this long-continued work. I
don't want you to sympathise, but only I write this so that you may not
expect much from me now. Work on, the best way you can. I have very
little hope of being able to do great things now. I am glad, however,
that a good deal of literature has been created by taking down
stenographic notes of my lectures. Four books are ready. . . . Well, I
am satisfied that I have tried my best to do good, and shall have a
clear conscience when I retire from work and sit down in a cave.

With love and blessings to all,

VIVEKANANDA.
