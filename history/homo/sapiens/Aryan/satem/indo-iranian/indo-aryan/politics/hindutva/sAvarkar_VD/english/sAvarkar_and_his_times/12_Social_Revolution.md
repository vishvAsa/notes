Thus Savarkar was interned in Ratnagiri where the
defeated and dethroned King Theba of Burma had perished.
Two weeks after this memorable event of January 6, 1924,
the Ratnagiri Hindu Sabha was established ostensibly
through the influence and attempts of Babarao Savarkar, but,
in fact, inspired by Savarkar himself. The main object of the
Sabha was to organize, consolidate and unite the Hindus into
one organic whole and enable them to oppose effectively any
unjust aggression ; thus while protecting their own cultural,
religious and economic rights, the Hindus were to strive for
the general welfare of mankind, universal compassion being
the basic urge of Hinduism !

The first event of note that took place in the history
of the Sanghatanist Party was the visit to Ratnagiri of
Sri Shankaracharya in May 1924, during the celebration of the
Shivaji Festival. The Sanghatanist Party utilised the great
occasion for arousing people’s enthusiasm for the Sanghatan
movement. But at this juncture plague broke out in Ratnagiri
and their work was hindered. Consequently Savarkar was
allowed to shift to Nasik, the city which he had transformed
into the Jerusalem of Indian revolutionaries. After 19 years
of glorious struggle and long incarceration Savarkar’s entry
into the city was hailed with great enthusiasm by the people.
As a token of their gratitude he was presented with a purse
on behalf of Maharashtra. Dr. Moonje presided over the
function and Sri N. C. Kelkar read out the address.
Sri Shankaracharya sent his blessings on the occasion by
presenting a holy garment to the great patriot. Expressing
feelings of esteem, gratitude and love that Maharashtra
cherished for Savarkar’s heroic fortitude, sterling patriotism
and untold sufferings in the cause of freedom, the address
presented to Savarkar ended with the hope that Savarkar



154 SAVAHKAR AND HIS TIMXS

would soon be a free man to carry on his mission in the
country unrestricted and unhampered. Savarkar carried on
his work for the uplift of the Hindu society in Nasik too.
During his stay at Nasik, he rescued some Mahar Hindus
from the snare of the Agakhani Mohammedans. He also
visited Trimbak, Yeola and Nagar, and propagated his new
Hindu Sanghatanist ideology among the people.

On his return from Nasik in the last week of November
1924, Savarkar devoted himself to public work and propaga-
tion of his ideal from the platform of the Ratnagiri Hindusabha
which was then, as was the Hindu Mahasabha itself, a non-
political body. The late Dr. M. G. Shinde, a sincere and
staunch worker and devoted Savarkarite who stood by his
leader through thick and thin, was Savarkar ’s chief lieutenant.
Different men for different purposes were drawn to him.
Some loved him, some protected him, some spread his
ideology among the people, and others worked and toiled for
him.

Sri Palukaka Joshi, a devotee, copied his master’s
manuscripts, his essays and dramas, articles and writings, and
directed them to the proper places. The late Sri Nanai, a
legal celebrity in the District, Kao Bahadur Parulekar, Rao
Saheb Ranade, Sri Vishnupant Damie, Sri Wamanrao Chavan,
Sri Patkar, Sri Achyutrao Malushte, Sri Narayanrao Khatu,
Sri Haribhau Gandhi, Sri Dattatraya Savant, Sri Atmaramrao
Salvi, Sri Keruji Mahar and a host of others were the pioneer
workers in this movement launched by Savarkar.

Gradually Savarkar began to initiate the people into his
new ideology through the Hindu Sabha. Afire with the new
ideology the Hindus in Ratnagiri began to worship strength,
consolidation, and unity. It was inevitable that such an
unadulterated Hindu movement should upset the mental
balance of the then peerless Gandhian pro-Muslim zealots.
The breath of the movement was against the current fads
and fashions in Indian pohtics passing under the good name
of non-violence and truth. Worship of strength and love for
the Machine age were taboo to the Gandhian faddists.
Naturally the new cult of lathi irritated them much. They
thought that the cult of lathi created communal dishaimony.
The Muslim opposition to this cult and ideology sprung from



SOCIAL REVOLUTION 155

the fear that the resultant force would be used against them.
In reply, the Savarkarian group suggested to the apostles of
the self-abnegation policy to cut their own hands lest they
might strike the faces of the Muslims. Servile philosophy,
the child of fear complex, being not in the blood of the
Sanghatanists, they did not care for the objections of the
faddists, nor did they care for the opposition of the fanatics.
They believed that the real leaders of the Hindus were those,
who had risen even in armed revolt against injustice,
aggression and tyranny in any form ! For the defence of their
natural and national rights, the Sanghatanists said, they
would not only use the force of lathi, but would also await
the opportunity to utilise, if necessary, the fire and power of
machine guns, submarines, aeroplanes and battleships.

In 1927 the question of playing music before mosque raised
its ugly head in Ratnagiri too. In Turkey and many other
European countries wherein Mu.slims live, there is neither ban
nor objection to the playing of music in public places. That
there should be an abundant and abiding respect for all creeds,
faiths, and ways of life is the true key to universal happiness.
But there must bo a give and take on both sides. It is the
duty of the followers of every faith to accommodate, conduce
and contribute to the peace and progress of the world. Here
in this case even (conventionally and legally the Hindus were
entitled to take their processions with music by the mosques ;
still the Muslims raised objection to these Hindu rights. So
the situation grew tense. The Hindus took out their
procession with great pomp and preparedness amidst this
tension and excitement.

The Muslims appealed to the District Magistrate for “ help
He rejected their appeal in these words : “ I do not think

that an amicable settlement is possible, as the Mohammedans
under the influence of some undesirable advice allege that no
procession ever passed the mosque with music in the past.”
The Di.strict Magistrate continued : “ It is unfortunate that
the question of music before the mosque has recently been
the cause of so much trouble everywhere. The duty of the
Executive is clear. It is to afford protection to the peaceful
enjoyment of existing rights and customs to those entitled to
it without fear or favour. I, therefore, agree with the District



156 SAVARKAR AND HIS TIMES

Superintendent of Police that Mohammedans have no grounds
for making these applications.” * Obviously the struggle
ended in a triumph for the Hindus. On this occasion Savarkar
reiterated his views that force and fanaticism on the Muslim
side would never solve this problem of music before the
mosque; true understanding and due respect for the Hindu
rights of citizenship on their part alone would mitigate the
evil.

Soon after the decision of the authorities in the aforesaid
episode, the Mushms exhibited placards in a procession
declaring that they did not want Swaraj. The Sanghatanists
said that Allah should read the placai-ds and grant their
prayer ; for the Swaraj of the stamp of Kohat, Malabar and
Gulbarga might never come into existence. The Hindus
said : “ Oh ! friends, you never joined us on the platform,
never accompanied us to the prisons, and never followed us
to the gallows. What else will a reasonable man expect of
you ? In spite of such an attitude, Savarkar every year on
the days of Hindu festivals visited the Muslim and Christian
quarters to promote good feelings between the Hindus and
the other communities. On the occasion of the Dasara
festival, accomjianied by his co-workers, Savarkar distributed
“ gold leaves ” among the Muslim and Christian citizens too.
But these feelings were never reciprocated. The doctrine of
false humility and degraded self-respect practised by Gandhist
Hindus stood at the non-Hindu doors with offers of
supplicant service. And the non-Hindus loved it more than
genuine goodwill and self-respect displayed by Savarkar. Due
regard for self and reasonable self-love constitute the Vtacif? of
virtue. A man of sense and self-respect considers so !

The first and foremost battle on the home front as such
Savarkar had with the Hindu orthodoxy or the Sanatanists
was over the question of mixed-caste schools in the District.
The orthodox Hindus opposed the idea tooth and nail. The
School Board faltered and the District Board failed in its
support.

So Savarkar carried on intense propaganda in favour of
mixed schools through the press and from the platform, and
appealed to the District and Provincial authorities for help

1 Ratnagiri Hindu Sabha, Five-Year Report, p. 41.



SOCIAL REVOLUTION 157

against the forces of orthodoxy which denied the jxist, civic,
hxuuan, and legitimate rights to the children of the imtouch-
ables to sit in public schools along with the caste-Hindu
children. Attention of the Government also was drawn by
Savarkar to the fact that the imtouchables being as good
tax-payers and citizens the touchables, their children were
entitled to the benefit of al! public schools. It was also pointed
out tiiat those very orthodox Hindus did not feel any qualms
of conscience in allowirn t.ie Christian and Muslim children
to sit with their children in the schools.

Savarkar entreated the orthodox Hindus in an appealing
tone not to treat their co-religionists worse than dogs and cats.
“ Can you prevent Christian children from attending public
schools ? No. You dare not. You know the consequences.
The British Government will speak with bullets,” he
challenged. “You insult the untouchables, because they are
ignorant and helpless ; but you yield to the unjust demands
of the Muslims because they are aggressive. When a Mahar
becomes a Muslim or a Christian convert, you treat him as
your equal. But as a Mahar he will not receive the same
treatment. What a shame my countrymen ! ” he thundered.

Savarkar appealed to the District Magistrate to bring the
rowdy elements to book and wrote to him in a moving tone :
“ I wish, sir, to enlist not only your legal protection as a
Magistrate, but also your human sympathies as a gentleman,
in the cause.” It may seem strange that Savarkar should
have written for help to the Government of those days. But
it must be noted that Savarkar is always uncompromising with
untruth and injustice, and not with men and power. The
breath of his ideology is the hatred of oppression in every
form, not of personalities and authorities. The virility and
sincerity of Savarkar in this cause ultimately triumphed. The
District Magistrate saw things for himself, and wrote the
following remark during one of his visits to the schools : “It
is the good result of Mr. Savarkar’s lectures that the
untouchable boys have been allowed to sit mixed and get
their education without any invidious distinction being made
in their case ! ” ^

Then came another shock to orthodoxy ! An untouchable

158 SAVARKAR AND HIS TIMES

teacher was transferred in 1928, to a school attended entirely
by caste-Hindu children ! The Sanatanists moved heaven
and earth to get the order of the School Board rescinded, but
to no purpose. The School Board threatened to close the
school and the orthodox Hindus regained their civic sense !
The effect was tremendous and historic. Due to this victory
of Savarkai' over orthodoxy and the establishment of rival
mixed-caste schools by the Hindus, and consequently for want
of new converts, the American Mission working in Ratnagiri
had to wind up its activities, and its chief departed in despair !
Thus ended the first battle at Ratnagiri agmnst orthodo?<y
in a unique victory for Savarkar.

Shuddhi or the Reconversion movement, the main spring
of Sanghatanisni, was also inaugurated by Savarkar in
Ratnagiri and was coming to a head despite heavy odds. Th('
Ratnagiri Hindu Sabha fought its way inch by inch until
the Hindus came to realize the Movement’s democratic sup-
IX)rt to the Indian unity, Indian peace and Indian prosperity in
the peculiar situation obtaining in India. Reconversion adds to
the strength and forces of nationalism and decreases the forces
of communalism, disruption, and disorder. The movement
holds forth immense pregnant possibilities.

The Ratnagiri Hindu Sabha reconverted from the middle
of 1926 and onwards several persons to the Hirfdu fold with
prescribed religious ceremonials. The Christian missionaries
were enraged at this ; so they warned a certain boy, who was
reconverted to Hinduism, not to pass by the mission quarters
lest other boys should catch the contagious idea that converts
could again become Hindus ! The most difficult problem
which ai'ose from this reconversion movement was the
marriage problem of the reconverted persons. The Ratnagiri
Hindu Sabha, in its earlj^ stage, had vigorously supported
the marriage of Sri Tukojirao, Maharaja of Indore, with
Miss Miller, an American lady, and even had expressed its
readiness to arrange for a priest to perform the marriage
ceremony. The Sabha in the beginning got two reconverted
girls married to two Hindu gentlemen under the direction of
Savarkar, who performed the marriage rites himself.
Orthodoxy shook to its roots at this ! Later, during
Savarkar’s internment, about two hundred persons were saved



SOCIAL REVOLUTION 159

from the clutches of non-Hindu Missions. Diseased and
disabled Hindu children were reared up by some Sanghatanists
and were prevented from being handed over to the non-Hindu
forces. The main support of money and sympathy for the
work of Sri Vinayak Maharaj Masurkar, while his reconver-
sion movement was going on in Goa, came from Ratnagiri,
the stronghold of Savarkarism.

The reconversion movement was a war. It really aimed at
bringing the senseless to their senses ! And a war with the
Hindu orthodoxy was a w^u' indirectly with the Maulavies and
Missionaries. Displeased at the new movement of Reconver-
sion, the Muslims and Missionaries lodged complaints against
Savarkai- with the Disti-ict Magistrate, who happened to
be a Muslim, charging Savarkar with creating communal
disharmony and tension in the District. Out went a
thundering rejoinder in the next month from the Ratnagiri
Hindus into the hands of H.E. the Governor of Bombay,
Sir Leslie Wilson, justifying the stand taken by Savarkar
and the cause espoused by him. This neutralised and nullified
the complaints of the opposite camps. Savarkar told the
District Magistrate that if the movement of Reconversion
created tension, why should the movement of Conversion also
be not considered so ? He emphasized that if at all anybody
was to be held responsible for the tension, the Missionaries
and Maulavies should be held so because they had started the
conversion movement first. Reconversion followed the
Conversion movement. Moreover, he added that his was not
an aggressive or unjust movement carried on in the far-off
corners of America or Turkey. He was doing sacred work
in his own country, which had been exploited in her fallen
days by foreign faiths. It was a strange attitude on the part
of a Government that allowed robbers to commit robberies
and prohibited the owners from protecting and defending
their property ! But in this unfortunate land those were the
times when a politician like Mr. Mahomed Ali, who expressed
his unholy desire to divide the Depressed Classes equally
between Hindus and Muslims, from the Presidential Chair of
the Indian National Congress, was eulogised as a patriotic and
a nationalist leader ! And at the same time the Reconversion
movement was decried as anti-national and a force of



160 SAVARKAR AND HIS TIMES

reactionarism, and its leaders from Shraddhananda to Lajpat
Rai, and from Moonje to Savarkar, were decried as
communalists and reactionaries by those so-called rationalists
and ‘ super ’-nationalists, who upheld and regarded the
Khilafat Movement of a frankly reUgious and medieval colour
as a glorious spectacle ! Did not Mr. Yakub Hasan, while
presenting an address to Gandhiji at Madras, openly enjoin
upon the Mussulmans to convert all the untouchables in India
to Islam ? ' And was he not in the eyes of the Congress
more patriotic, progressive and a truer nationalist thiin
Moonje or Parmananda ? To the Congressmen the Khilaiat
leaders, who sent their congratulations to the Moplahs on their
‘ brave ’ fight for religion, were progressive and pati iotic
leaders ! ! Can there be any nationalism worse than this kind
of deceptive and disruptive nationalism ? The “ communal-
ism ” of the Hindu Sanghatanists was righteous ; because it
was bred in self-defence ; the “ nationalism ” of the upholders
and supporters of the Khilafat was perverse, because it
nourished anti-national feelings among the Muslims ! !

n

The question of Temple Entry for the untouchables cropped
up in 1925. The orthodox quarters were alarmed. They
shouted that their Religion, God and Traditions were in
danger. Their religion and traditions and customs welcomed
an untouchable provided he became a Mohammad or a Minto.
The orthodox touched animals like bullocks and buffaloes,
could endure the presence of a dog or a cat in their houses,
but not the presence of their co-religionist Hindu Mahars or
Hindu Bhangis though they were human beings ! ! They
feared that their sacred God would be polluted by the mere
sight of a Hindu Bhangi ! “ He is not God who can be
desecrated ” went the epigrammatic Savarkarian reply to the
orthodox. Savarkar holds that those men, who regard such
inhuman faith as abhors the touch of a human being, and yet
gladly touches animals like dogs and cats, are themselves a
blot on humanity. It is they who are really fallen and not
the “ untouchables ” ! Removal of untouchability, therefore.

implies purification and salvation of such misguided orthodox
touchables also !

Orthodoxy began to collapse under such ruthless arguments.
To puU down the steel walls of orthodoxy, Savarkar started
Pan-Hindu Ganesh festivals in 1925. He transformed the
Ganesh Festival started by Tilak into a Pan-Hindu Festival.
An untouchable was not allowed for ages within the precincts
of the Hindu sanctuaries. By and by the question of temple
entry was discussed wiili wisdom and vehemence during the
days of Ganesh Festival The untouchables were brought into
the hall of the Vithoba Temple in Ratnagiri, the most impor-
tant temple in the Ratnagiri District. Then in November 1929,
took place an event of far-reaching consequences. All the city
was agog. The City Magistrate was present by a special
order to see that the proceedings of the public meeting, held
in the Vithoba Temple of Ratnagiri to decide the question of
the entry of the untouchables into the Vithoba Temple, came
off peacefully.

The momentous meeting began. Savarkar’s convincing
speech swept away doubts, hesitation and misgivings which
were lurking in the minds of the opponents.

The Magistrate himself having been carried off his feet by
the force and faith of Savarkar’s speech, forgot his entity,
rose and exclaimed, “ Now who and what remain to be
convinced ? ” None came forward. It was a unique triumph
for Savarkar. Amidst flickering opposition and deafening
exclamations, the untouchables entered the Vithoba Temple
of Ratnagiri, step by step, singing gracefully and gratefully
the glory of “ one God, one goal, one language, one country
and one Nation.” With great feelings and devotional eyes the
densely crowded meeting saw the historic spectacle, the first
of its kind in the history of Hindusthan ! As the age-long
sufferers followed their children who climbed the steps of the
temple one by one, singing the song, their hearts throbbed,
and eyes glowed. The song was specially composed in
Marathi by Savarkar himself for the occasion ! It read :

The Impurity of ages is gone
Scripture-born stamp is tom
The age-long struggle is ended


u

SAVARKAB AND HIS TIMES

The net of enemies shredded
The slave of ages hoary !

Now is a brother in glory !

The Bhageshwar Temple in the Ratnagiri Fort was also
declared open to all Hindus at a meeting held under the
chairmansliip of Shrimat Shankaracharya, the religious head
of the Hindus. Sri Shankaracharya was garlanded on the
occasion by a Hindu Bhangi as the representative of the
Ratnagiri Hindus. The scene was reminiscent of the first
Shankaracharya, who had embraced centuries ago a pantheist
untouchable while returning from his bath in the Ganges !

A Pan-Hindu band was trained and it replaced the
non-Hindu bands. The Hindu band attended festivals and
functions. Women of Ratnagiri performed to the shock of
Maharashtra and Hindusthan their Haldi-Kumkum ceremony
on a Pan-Hindu basis. During the Pan-Hindu Ganpati
festivals a Bhangi Hindu sang Vedic hymns and Gayatri
Mantrarn, the sacred privilege enjoyed so far by the Brahmins
alone. The incident echoed throughout India. The Times of
India, Bombay, styled it as a sacrilegious prize. The event
resounded through some London papers too ! On another
occasion a Bhangi family needed a priest for a marriage
ceremony. The Mahar Hindus being the Brahmins of the
Bhangis, their priest declined to perform the ceremony. The
Hindu Sabha thereupon sent a Brahmin priest, and he
performed the ceremony.

Soon the movement gained gi'ound and grew gradually
popular. While the struggle for opening temples to the
untouchables was forging ahead, Savarkar was thinkin g of
having a Pan-Hindu Temple with a view to giving an impetus
to the temple entry movement. He held that the youths
trained in the new ideology would throw open the doors of
the remaining temples to the untouchables when they would
become trustees of the temples. So he approached Seth
Bhagoji Baloji Keer, the famous temple-builder of Maha-
rashtra, who fervently believed that Savarkar’s inspiration
was God’s call ! He summarily and spontaneously silenced
Savarkar’s opponents by telling them that Savarkar’s name
was Vinayak and Vinayak was the name of God Ganapati ! In



SOCIAL REVOLTJTlOir


163


deference to Savarkar’s wishes Seth Bhagoji built in February
1931 a magnificent temple known as the Patit Pavan Temple
in Ratnagiri wherein aU Hindus irrespective of caste could
assemble for prayers. This was an epoch-making achievement
of Savarkarian movement. This monumental Pan-Hindu
temple was the fust to stand in the history of Hindusthan open
for Pan-Hiudu worship, Pan-Hindu functions and Pan-Hindu
propaganda. An event of new hope, new era, new light, and
new history !

The opening ceremony of the temple came off on a grand
scale. Acharyas, Slianharacharyas, pundits and patriots
declared Ratnagiri a place of pilgrimage. In fact, as one
speaker then put it, Ratnagiri became the new Kashi of the
re-awakened, purified and unified Hindudom where a Hindu
scavenger acted as a priest, persons from the so-called
Depressed Classes delivered Kathas, Mahars read the sacred
Gita, Brahmins garlanded and bowed themselves before these
priests and kathekaries ; and Brahmin youths conducted a
Pan-Hindu Hotel. Indeed, the Patit Pavan Temple came to
be the university of the Pan-Hindu Movement.

Prohibition of one caste from dining with another was the
keystone upon which the arch of the caste system mainly
rested. Savarkar decided to strike a fatal blow at this
keystone. He contemplated inter-caste Pan-Hindu dinners.
As usual orthodox Hindus opposed the idea vehemently.
Savarkar, however, silenced their learned spokesmen by
throwing at their faces extracts from their own scriptures
and Holy Works that sang that God Krishna dined with
Vidura, a son born of a maid-servant, and that their great
Brahmin Rishi, Durvasa, dined along with his numerous
disciples at the Pandavas’ who were Kshatriyas ! Yet, it was
not easy to hold a Pan-Hindu dinner. The movement
developed gradually from private quarters to public places.
And then came off the first public Pan-Hindu dinner
popularly known all over India as Sahahhojan, in a theatre in
1930. This was the acid test to know who were the real
      seasoned reformers and who were seasonal. What a horrifying
      event it was in the eyes of old traditions ! Upto this time
      even the beggars recoiled from touching the food of the
      Pan-Hindu dinner. Mahars refused to eat with the Bhangis



164 SAVARKAK AND HIS TIMES

and Bhangis with the Dhors. The Depressed Classes desired
to eat with the caste-Hindus but not with the different
sub-classes from amongst themselves. Onlookers thronged to
see the neo-function, and Ratnagiri was the subject of
headlines all over India.

In its “ current topics ” the Times of India, Bombay, writing
on the subject, observes in its issue of December 9, 1930 :
“ This all-caste dinner was celebrated in a unique manner —
a manner that has given deep offence to Nationalist
Congressmen, who are mostly believers along with Mr. Gandhi
in foiur watertight castes by birth. For, at Ratnagiri some
enthiisiastic reformers, who regarded caste system as the
bane of Hinduism, held an all-caste dinner which was attended
by Brahmins, Banias, Chambhars, Mahars and Bhangis ! ”
Styling it as a bold creed, the writer goes on : “ What is still
more interesting, the spirit of this splendid essay in practical
reform, Mr. V. D. Savarkar, delivered a speech in which he
flung into the teeth of orthodoxy the daring credo of his party.

‘ From today I shall not believe in highness or lowness of
caste. I shall not oppose the intermarriage between the
highest and lowest castes. I shall eat with any Hindu
irrespective of caste. I shall not believe in caste by birth
or by profession and henceforth I shall call myself a Hindu
only — ^not Brahmin, Vaishya, etc.’ ”

Savarkar incessantly preached : “ Eat with anybody. Eat
anything that is medically fit and clean. That does not deprive
you of yoiu: religion. Remember the root of religion is not
the dish or the stomach, but the heart, soul and the blood ! ”
The names of those persons, who took part in the all-caste
dinners, were published in newspapers to the surprise and
shock of their orthodox relations !

The first week of the opening ceremony of the Patit Pavan
Temple saw the biggest of such Pan-Hindu Dinners in India.
The reactions to the Pan-Hindu dinner were tremendous.
Acharyas took to their heels and saints went head over heels.
Cow-worshippers thou^t it beneath their dignity to honour
human beings and eat with men who were their co-religionists !
There were some who did everything else for the movement,
but declined to eat with all classes. Their heads agreed, but
hearts disagreed ! At last their dilemma was solved, when



SOCIAI. RKVOLUTION


165


Savarkar, who held that social reforms settled down more
permanently if they were effected with full consideration and
conciliation, accepted a compromise which allowed the
no-changers to take their dinner by sitting not in the line with
the revolutionary reformists, but in another row facing them.
Orthodoxy clamoured and raised a hue and cry in the city !
Rumours were afloat in the neighbouring villages that the
all-caste dinner would cost the reformers dear and that a rift
was visible in the ranks of the reformers.

When the beggars saw lawyers, leaders, Divans, merchants,
doctors, big and respectable men of all castes sharing food in
a commimion, they, too, expressed their willingness to accept
the Pan-Hindu food which they had declined to accept on the
previous occasion ! But now Savarkar would not offer them
the food unless they also sat in one and the same row irrespec-
tive of castes. And ultimately they did so ! At last Pan-Hindu
sense and mentality came to stay. Karmaveer V. R. Shinde,
a great social reformer of the Deccan, rejoiced to see what
his D. C. Mission aimed at was both preached and practised
in Ratnagiri. Overwhelmed with grateful tears, he acclaimed
Savarkar as the real Patit Pavan of the Hindus, the saviour
of the fallen and trodden. It was a noble appreciation and
correct assessment of a great achievement ! Some leaders,
who witnessed the practical reforms, called Savarkar
Sanghatanacharya — ^Master-brain at organisation — and others
described him as their Skankaracharya, the supreme head of
New Hinduism !

Every revolution has its convulsions and revelations.
Defeated at all other points orthodox Hindus and non-Hindus
now threatened Savarkar’s life. In many families dissensions
arose. Unpleasant words were said and heard between sons
and fathers, wives and husbands. Harsh gestures were
exchanged between friends, and estrangement rankled
amongst relations. Newly married girls were forbidden to
see the faces of their reformist parents, brothers or relatives.
A married girl in one case perished in her illness despite her
father’s fervent entreaties to her father-in-law to send her
to him for medical treatment. The father of the girl was asked
to withdraw his support and devotion to Savarkarian ideology,
but he did not yield !



166 SAVARKAB AND HIS TIMES

Half-hearted reformists were trapped and they repented in
sack-cloth and ashes. If some one from Savarkar’s camp f('U
ill, whispers and vilification would attribute the illness oi-
misfortune to God’s wrath ; and Savarkar would retort that
even his cat was still unaffected. All the while Sax'arkaj-
infused courage into the minds of Iris followers with his
undying dictum: “Reform implies always a minority, custom
means a majority. Have undeviating faith in your mission
and courage of conviction, and you will successfully overcomo
the forces of reactionaries ! ”


III

This was the model moulded in a District-wid<' movemejil
of Savarkarian Revolution which echoed throughout Hindu-
.sthan and had its reverberations even in the London
papers. Savarkar succeeded where prophets, philosophers
and emperors had failed. A man who had to rot for fourteen
youthful years in the most dreadful jail and again was
interned for over another thirteen years in Ratnagiri and was
forbidden to participate publicly or privately in any political
activities, had worked this miracle. All this happened a
c-on.siderable time before Gandhiji made the Harijan uplift one
of the chief planks of his activities !

Savarkar’s approach to untouchability, the age-long cor-
roding current of evil, and his potent remedy and method foj-
its abolition were as rational and constructive as they were
fearless, fundamental and far-reaching. There had been in
the past rationalists like Agarkar, and institutions like the
Arya Samaj, the Brahmo Samaj and the Prarthana Samaj
working for that cause. Later, there followed also the great
personality of Gandhiji in the field. There were some showy,
touchy, and fashionable learned men who expressed lip
sympathy in spotless diction for the Depressed Classes in
order to please and show the ruling bosses their radical views !
But Savarkar’s angle of vision fundamentally differed from
those of such institutions and personalities. Western ideas of
Equality, Fraternity and Liberty dominated the motives of the
rationalist group led by Ranade. Revolt against orthodox Hin-
duism and re-orientalization of Hinduism were the objects of



SOCIAL REVOLUTION 167

the Arya Samaj ; electicisra was the aim of the Brahmo Samaj
and Prarthana Samaj. Agarkar was an unbridled rationalist,
a lonely giant. He had no genius for constructive work. The
Arya Samajists compromised their prophet’s .stand by mixing
their identity with the Gandhian principles, lost sight of its
political impact, and lost their vitality, fervour, and firmness !
Though Gandhij.i believed in the caste system, he wanted to
remove untouchahility. But his Harijan movement was any-
thing but Hindu, though tb money for the cause came mainly
from the Hindus

Gandhiji never raised his Little finger against the pro.sely-
tizing greed of the Maulavies and Missionaries and observed
reticence about it ! But even then it was his fortune that he
received wreaths for his work for the Depressed Classes while
Savarkar faced the wrath of all non-Hindu missionaries !
Like all positive and powerful reformers, Savarkar wielded
the force, construction and hammer of Luthei- ! And a Luther
is not born for laurels. Savarkar 's one aim was to purge
Hinduism of its most baneful superstitions and orthodox
bigotry. His reformative zeal did not aim at the denunciation
of Hinduism. He strove for its revival in the light of modern
times and to ensure its survival. That was why ho was
offensive inside and defensive outside. He aimed at moulding
the different castes of the Hindus into a classless Hindu
society in which all Hindus would be by birth socially, eco-
nomically and p>olitically equal ! Rational, nationalistic and
revolutionary in outlook, his ideology was as deep-rooted as it
was far-reaching, and looked to the prosperity and peace of
the Hindu society, Hindu life, Hindusthan and ultimately
universal welfare. His was not the work of a fashionable
reformer, or a showy rationalist, or a wordy humanist. His
was a mission for a great cause for the emergence of Hindu-
sthan as a world power to play her destined part in the comity
of nations.

Two decades ago he admonished the Hindus to break off
the seven shackles that hindered the progress of the Hindu
society. He fought for temple entry, popularised Pan-Hindu
dinners, naturalised Shuddhi-reconversion, anniliilated the
belief in highness and lowness of birth, favoured intercaste
marriages, and ridiculed the injunctions on caste-ridden



168 SAVARKAR AND HIS TIMES

vocations and sea-voyage. The power and faith of the Savar-
karian movement depended for its vitality and goal upon the
elixir of Shuddhi and Science which hold the key not only to
Indian peace and prosperity, but also to the destinies of the
Middle East and Far East, the one-time tributaries of Hindu
life ! In one of his songs he visualized that the Hindus after
achieving freedom would liberate all subject nations under
the sun, and would help them establish love, equality and peace
for the progress of humanity. And it was towards this end
that all his Sanghatanist movement was directed. Savarkar
preached and worked for the abolition of untouchability with
imparalleled success when few of his great contemporaries
were thinking of the removal of the untouchability, and a
majority of them had not gauged its significance.

Restricted in his activities, shadowed by spies, Savarkar
thus shelled one of the strongest holds of the Hindu orthodoxy
in India. For this signal achievement he applied the battery
of his oratory, poured in his volcanic energy, utilized the fund
of his resourceful erudition and the flow of his volcanic pen.
He used platform, press, examination centres, theatres, circus-
tents, festivals, fares and functions for popularizing the Move-
ment, and whipped the people into a revolt. The forces of
conservatism and orthodoxy tottered before his powerful
personality, and the bees that had nestled in the barriers of
the caste system tried to fling their poisonous stings into his
body, but failed. For, every Luther is born with an impene-
trable armour !

The revolution in the Ratnagiri District was an unparalleled
success; so much so that Karmaveer Shinde, hearing the
news of Savarkar’s unconditional release in May 1937,
remarked that had Savarkar’s activities been restricted to
social revolution only, he would have banished untouchability
altogether from the face of India within five years. Worthy
was the glowing tribute and noble appreciation made by a
writer in a special issue of Dr. Ambedkar’s Janata that
Savarkar’s service to the cause of the imtouchables was as
decisive and great as that of Gautama Buddha himself. Sri
Kakasahib Barve, his contemporary, and President, Maha-
rashtra Provincial Harijan Sevak Sangh, in his Presidential
Address at a Conference at Sangli, in July 1945, expressed



SOCIAL RBVO'UTION 169

the view that had Savarkar continued his intense work in the
cause of the removal of untouchahility, his contribution would
have given a tremendous impetn'T to the movement !

Thus it can be seen that the itality of Lord Buddha, who
raised a revolt against untouc^ ability, the virility of Shivaji,
who purf osefully hammered j!s corners that lay in his way,
the vigour of Dayananda, who strove to bury it, are aU crys-
tallized in the revolutionar’ philosophy of Savarkar whose
approach to the problem xc; predominantly political and
fundamentally social.


IV

Savarkar’s propaganda was not one-sided. With a batch of
his workers, he visited the slums and squalid dens, hamlets
and hills, villages and towns where the untouchables lived.
This batch studied their ways of living, taught them cleanli-
ness, guided them, and worshipped with them. They took
the Chambhars into the quarters and temples of the Mahars
and the Bhangis into the quarters and temples of the Dhors.

The discussions and debates with opponents over the burn-
ing problem of Shuddhi-Reconversion and Hindu organisation
stormed and abated. Stirring speeches and moving appeals
would go on till early dawn. The next morning saw Savarkar
in another village and so his propaganda went on. Savarkar
was then in the best of his health. Men of wealth, distinction
and status followed him climbing zig-zag distances and dales
with cheer. In fact, all the Indian leaders, whose names are
connected with the removal of untouchability, have not seen
as many quarters of the untouchables as Savarkar has done.
The suppressed humanity watched and sat far into the night
with bewilderment and hope, and crowded for the darshan
of Savarkar, the Saviour of the fallen Hindus, who opened
to them the gates of the Temples of God, Man and Light !

Savarkar also attended and presided over the conferences
of the .so-called untouchables. In June 1929 he was received
with great ovation at Malvan in the southern part of the
Ratnagiri District, where he presided over the Conference of
the Depressed Classes of the Konkan Division. The Confer-
ence sang Vedic hymns in a body. Savarkar distributed the



170 SAVARKAB AND HIS TIMES

sacred threads among the so-called untouchable Hindus and
declared amid great applause : “ A battle royal has been
raging for the last seven generations over the right of studying
the Vedas, Here are the Vedas, Here is the sacred thread.
Take these two. Is that all ? Even non-Hindus read the
Vedas, Why should not the Hindu Mahars read them ? The
feud over this problem was a useless task. Let us expiate the
sins we committed. We are all responsible for our political
subjugation. That is the past. Now let us declare on oath
that we shall rectify our past blunders and win back our weal,
wealth and glory.’’ Sri P. N. Rajbhoj, a volatile leader of the
Depressed Classes from Poona, who was present at the Con-
ference, observed : “ I was really sceptical of the Savarkarian
movement at the beginning. My contact and discussions
with Barrister Savarkar and my personal observation have
thoroughly convinced me of its far-reaching effect. I am
extremely rejoiced to declare that this famous leader of the
political revolutionaries is also an out and out social revo-
lutionist ! ”

Another notable Conference was held in the Patii Pavan
Temple at Ratnagiri just after the temple was opened during
the last week of February 1931, under the aegis of the D.C.
Mission led by Karmaveer V. R. Shinde. This was the Mis-
sion’s Sixth Annual Session and Wiis presided over by
Savarkar. All the workers and leaders of the D.C. Mission
and other leaders of the so-called Depressed Classes were
thrilled to survey the achievement of this Savarkarian move-
ment. One after another they acknowledged gratefully that
their dreams were brought into reality by Savarkar in Ratna-
giri. They repeated that if the atmosphere of Ratnagiri
captivated all the parts of India, there would be no untouch-
ability left in the land.

A third Conference was held on April 26, 1931. It was the
Ratnagiri District Somavanshiya Mahar Conference. Savar-
kar presided over it. It was attended by hundreds of Mahars
from all corners of the District. The Mahars had poured in
the city as they heard that ‘ Pandhari ’ was shifted to Ratna-
giri where they were allowed to enter the temple and worship
God — an unbelievable thing for them — a thing for which they
had pined for ages !



SOCIAL REVOLUTION

Savarkf r\s teachings and message to the untouchables were
appealing. He asked them to live a simple life, and to shed
their inherent inferiority complex. He admonished tlien) :
‘^Y(air weakness is worse than the wickedness of the caste
Hindus. For your own welfare you must also sufTcr with
fortitude and faith. You want rights, but you are not prepared
to pay the price. Be men. Know that you arc men. If some-
one .scolds you for your proximity on the public road, tell
him that the public road is not the property of his father.
Do not abandon your occunations. Stick to thon and improve
them. Every occupation has its value. Live a dean and
temperate life. Never disown your fathers, saints, and blood.
Do not observe untouchability among yourselves. Always
treat with equality and kindness all the sub-castes amongst
your own so-called Depressed Classes. That is also your duty.
Forget it not ! ’’

Savarkar sounded a warning to the extremist leaders of the
so-called untouchables in particular, who wished to have
Brahmin girls in marriages for untouchable youths. Savarkar
considered this view to be mistaken, extra^'agant, and un-
justifiable. To break off the barrier of caste system, he
observexi, in respect of marriages did not mean compulsory
and forced marriages. According to him many things besides
caste governed matrimonial alliances. “ If a Hindu girl,” he
wrote, “ selects as her husband any Hindu youth who does not
belong to her caste or vice ver.sa and if the couple is other-
wise fit for matrimony the marriage should not be condemned,
nor the couple be regarded as outcast on that account alone ! ”
As for the marriage of a Hindu with a non-Hindu, he was
opposed to it if it took place without bringing the partner
into the Hindu fold. According to him such a precaution was
necessary for the collective good of the Hindu Nation.

Savarkar’s love of Hindu religion was not narrow-minded
either. He said : “ When a non-Hindu worships or a Moham-
medan merges into humanity melting his religious libido, the
Hindus, too, shall dissolve their separate entity.” “ Till then,”
Savarkar observed, ‘^it is necessary that the Hindus should
be within their bonds. It is against the creed of humanity
itself, if we ignore stark realities of life.”



172 SAVARKAR AND HIS TIMES

To the so-called caste Hindus his piece of advice was that
they should be prepared to adopt even the pursuit of
sweepers. There should be no monopoly in any field. He
advised the non-Brahmins to administer to their own religious
and sacramental life themselves and told them that there was
no need of an authorised intermediary between them and God.
“ The moment you resolve not to invite the Bhat (Brahmin)
to perform religious functions, Bhatshahi collapses like a pack
of cards,” he wrote. Learning and expounding the scriptures
or sacerdocy should not be the monopoly of one particular
class. Prestige and authority should be justified by individual
achievement and not by caste, he opined. Priests, irrespective
of caste, should be certified as are our doctors, asserted
Savarkar.


V

Savarkar’s life in Ratnagiri was full of other activities also.
It was in Ratnagiri that the famous Pan-Hindu anthem vras
composed by him and was first sung. Ratnagiri is the birth-
place of the Pan-Hindu Flag which was first flown by Sri
Ramananda Chatter jee. President of the All-India Hindu
Mahasabha at its Surat session in 1929, and was ultimately
adopted by the All-India Hindu Mahasabha as the Pan-Hindu
Flag at Lahore in 1936. It was the Ratnagiri Hindu Sabha
that remembered and sent its grateful homage to Nepal then
the only Independent Hindu Kingdom in the world and
appealed to her to make her arm stronger for the sake of
Hindudom. It was the Ratnagiri Hindu Sabha again that
declared Nagari script and Sanskritised Hindi to be the
National Script and Lingua Franca of Hindusthan !

Ratnagiri Hindu Sabha did a tremendous work in the cause
of Swadeshi also. Savarkar and his colleagues visited the
market places, lanes and by-lanes, and sent children selling
and propagating Swadeshi articles as hawkers do. Savarkar
himsdf saw individually every shop-keeper, entreated and
insisted on the purchase of Swadeshi goods like soap, sugar,
bangles, paper and many other articles of Indian make. One
can easily imagine what amount of humiliation, exhausting
patience and personal pecuniary loss Savarkar must have



SOCIALREVOLUTION 173

undergone at the hands of insolent, illiterate and even so-
called progressive but unpatriotic countrymen !

It was again Savarkar who attracted with great persuasion
the Hindus to the trade of Bed-making. To that end he him-
self learnt the art of carding cotton with the carding-bow.
He then induced Hindu youths to follow the vocation and
thus the Ratnagiri Hindus had beds prepared by Hindus.

The most vociferous and effective was the movement
launched for the purification of the Marathi language. The
question had been agitating great minds for decades. But it
was left to Savarkar to crown the movement with triixmph.

Shivaji had set up a committee to compile a Dictionary of
pure Marathi words. The Rajyavyavdharkosh was compiled
by Raghunath Pandit and others appointed by Shivaji the
Great. The rise of the English Language added to the difficul-
ties of Marathi which had been, to a great extent, already
influenced by the Urdu and Persian languages. A nation
must keep its mother tongue alive, its cherished heritage un-
defiled, its values and cotmotation unaffected. In the life of
every nation the problem of purification of its language does
arise. There has been a growing desire for the original and
native forms of mother-speech in England too. Stating that
there should be as much reverence and affection for one’s
native tongue as for the country and home, Frank H. Callan,
author of Excellence in English, observes : “ As we naturally
and rightly resent and stand against all foreign incursions
that may injure and corrupt the land of our birth and the
scene of our infancy and childhood, desiring nothing so much
as to preserve their integrity and familiar attractiveness, so
in like manner we ought to guard nothing more jealously
than the primitive purity and individuality of our language.” ^

Mr. Callan tells us that Defoe was against Latinized syntax
and style of Elnglish. Swift employed his genius to resist Gaelic
foreign tendencies in English prose. Gibbon was saturated
with French; Johnson gave undue preference to Latin; and
Carlyle was full of German constructions. All the three, says
Callan, impeded the movement.^ Lamb played an important
role in the purification of the English language and Dryden

and Shakespeare were pure English writers. So was
Newman.

Ireland’s great movement for the revival and resurrection
of her mother tongue and its purification is too well-known.

In India the flag of the momentous movement of purification
of the language was unfmded by Savarkar. Savarkar was
against Urduised and Persianised Hindi or Marathi, as they
eliminated Marathi and Hindi synonyms and impoverished
the Marathi and Hindi Languages. He, therefore, launched
a movement for the purification of the Marathi language.
Battles were joined on the issue. After an untiring cainpaigi^
the rational and national importance was realized and some
of the opponents turned into its supporters. Some spineless
ones conceded the principle, but fastidiously liiggled about tlie
details. Some came to respect it, and still a few croak
against it.

But the Maharashtra Literary Conference at its Jalgaon
Session accepted the principle of purification of the Marathi
language. Dr. Patwardhan, D.Lit., a great Marathi poet, was
first enamoured of foreign woixls. But when he was convinced
of the righteousness of Savarkar’s stand, he re-wrote his
poetry in undefiled Marathi ! Such was the glow of Savar-
kar s movement. New words were coined. Dictionaries oi
pure Marathi words to substitute Urdu and Persian words
were compiled and published by Bhide Guruji and Dr. Pat-
wardhan. The words gained ground and public sanction.
The critics, too, unwittingly influenced by the psychology, are
helping the movement by using the new words, and thus the
purification of Marathi has come to stay.

Savarkar did not stop here. His movement was essentially
an All-India urge. Hence he suggested that all those, who
stood for pure Hindi and for the preservation of the purity
of the Indian languages, should meet in an All-India Confer-
ence to devise ways and means, and launch a nation-wide
movement for the purity of the Hindi and other languages.
Savarkar also suggested reforms in the Devanagari script and
reduced it to fifty-six letters for the convenience of the press.
In respect of the Nagari script, he made an appeal to all
provincial newspapers to print in every issue at least two
columns of matter in their provincial languages in the Nagari



SOCIAL REVOLUTIOK 175

script. If all the provincial languages of India are printed in
the Nagari script, what immense cohesion, understanding and
advancement will be achieved ! It is said that Dr. Ambedkar
holds the same view on the subject. It has been the charac-
teristic of great Maharashtrians that they never disagreed
on fundamentals, although they might have differed in
degree. Tilak, Gokhale, Kelkar and Ambedkar all exhibited
ultimate unity in essentials and liberty in non-essentials.
Their objects were one, though their means at times differed.
The movement of the i/^rification of language scored its
triumph when Hindi wiJi’ Devanagari script was adopted
by the Constituent Assonibl> of India as the Lingua Franca
of India in preference to Hindusthani, another name of Urdu.

Savarkar’s stay in Ratnagiri attracted several pundits and
patriots of all-India fame. One of the early visitors to
Savarkar in Ratnagiri was the great founder of the R.S.S.,
Dr. K. B. Hedgewar. Tlie interview took place in 1925 at
Shirgaon, a village on the outskirts of Ratnagiri. Savarkar’s
monumental work Hindutva giving ideas of the fundamentals
of Hindu Nationalism and Hindu State had just appeared on
the scene and captivated and inspired many great brains and
great hearts. Before starting the volunteer organisation
known as the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, Dr. Hedgewar
had a long discussion with Savarkar over the faith, form and
future of the organisation. A great Hindu leader and an
unbending upright nationalist, Dr. Hedgewar wanted to
conserve and dir€?ct the energy of Hindu youths towards all-
round uplift of the Hindu Nation. After the collapse of the
Non-co-operation Movement of Gandhiji and the fiasco of the
Khilafat Movement, the country lay prostrate and chaos and
confusion reigned in the student world. In the wake of this
confusion and in consultation with Savarkar and others,
Hedgewar decided to build up an organisation to supply the
Hindu society with power and pillars.

During his visit to Bombay in September 1924, Savarkar
came across Maulana Shaukat Ali. The Muslim leader paid
glowing tribute to Savarkar for his patriotism and sacrifice,
but he said that he disliked Savarkar’s Hindu Sanghatan
ideology, and wished that it should be stopped. Thereupon



176


SAVARKAR AND HIS TIMES


Savarkar asked the Muslim leader to stop his Khilafat Move-
ment first if he wanted him to stop Hindu Sanghatan Move-
ment. Shaukat Ali replied that the Khilafat Movement was
the breath of his nostrils. Savarkar told him that as long as
there were separate organisations for the Muslims and the
movement of conversion was carried on by them, so long the
movement of Hindu Sanghatan and the propaganda for re-
conversion would go on unabated. Then the Muslim leader
told Savarkar that the Muslims had many other countries
and they would leave India, if inevitable. Savarkar at once
answered back, “ O quite freely. Why do you wait ? The
Frontier Mail is daily running towards that direction ! ”
Shaukat Ali was now quite nervous. While taking Savarkar’s
leave, he cut a joke to make up the loss he suffered in argu-
ments with Savarkar. With a bitter tone he said he was a giant
and Savarkar was a dwarf and that he could punch Savarkar
easily. “ Here,” said Savarkar sharply, “ I am not disinclined
to accept your challenge ! Come on ! You know Shivaji
was also a dwarf before the giant Afzulkhan. They had a
meeting ! And everybody knows what was the history
afterwards.” The Muslim leader lost his face and stepped out.

Here is one of the most important interviews Savarkar had
during his internment. Gandhiji saw Savarkar in March 1927
at the latter’s residence in Ratnagiri. It was after nearly
eighteen years that Gandhiji was now meeting his old oppo-
nent of London days. However of different stamps, the great
ones recognise great forces. The real object of Gandhiji was
to see whether the revolutionary volcano was now extinct,
or a spent force, or still burning. During the course of the
interview, Gandhiji told Savarkar with a pleasant smile that
he would have stayed with Savarkar in Ratnagiri, the birth-
place of Tilak, and the abode of Savarkar, for a day or two
had his programme been not already fixed. Savarkar replied
that he would have also been glad to entertain him, but agreed
that Gandhiji should go on with his great mission of arousing
the nation’s enthusiasm for the Freedom Movement, as
Gandhiji was fortunately free to do so. Then the problem of
Shuddhi was discussed and the conversation between the two
leaders ran as follows : —

Savarkar : Well, what are your views on Shuddhi ?



SOCIAL REVOLUTION 177

Gandhiji : To me the view that a man loses his religion
is absurd.

Savarkar : In a way you are right. But as our caste
system and tradition have laid down that under certain
circumstances a man loses his religion, it is necessary to
set the matter right by adopting such remedies and rites
as would enable us to restore the reconverted man to his
society. Wliat is the harm in doing such a thing ? Both
the society and the new-comer thei’eby get mental
satisfaction.

Gandhiji : I have no ol»jeotion. It will do no harm if you
have .such a ceremonj'. But although I believe in recon-
version of a person, who was forcibly or deceitfully
converted to an alien faith, I am not for reconversions of
persons whose ancestors have changed faiths decades ago.
Nor do I uphold the conversions of persons from other
religions. Because I believe that it is better to die while
observing one’s own religion than to embrace other
religion. None should be persuaded to change his or her
faith. It should be left to the will of the person.

Savarkar : Yes, after weighing carefully what is good for
the betterment of one’s own happiness, a man should
decide the means. 'That is freedom of thought. The mes-
sage of Hinduism is practical as well as spiritual, passive
as well as active. It says on the one hand that it is better
to die under the domain of one’s own religion, and on the
other, that it is better to transform the world into an
Ai’yan Religion.

Gandhiji ; The aim of both of us is the same. We both
strive for the glory of Hinduism and Hindusthan.

Gandhiji was now doubly sure that the faith and fire in
Savarkar was unaffected even by the tortures and tribula-
tions of the jail life in the Andamans. This was the last talk
between Gandhiji and Savarkar. Though Savarkar was
released afterwards in 1937, and made a whirlwind propa-
ganda through the length and breadth of India as the leader
of the Hindu Mahasabha, no occasion arose for a meeting
between the two leaders.

Dr. Ambedkar, who had been to Ratnagiri in connection
with a law suit, had a talk with Savarkar. Savarkar had


12



178 SAVARKAR AND HIS TIMES

arranged for a public meeting, but on a telegraphic message
from Bombay, Dr. Ambedkar left for Bombay. Young leaders
of the spirit and heroic stamp of Sri Achyutrao Patwardhan
showed deep regard for Savarkar. During the blooming days
of the Civil Disobedience Movement of 1930 he discussed some
points with Savarkar. When the yoimg khadi-clad leader
doubted the possibility of regaining Independence by an
armed rising, Savarkar asked the charkha-general, “ Then
friend, teU me how you are going to win back the indepen-
dence by charkha ! ”

Senpati Bapat’s visit to Ratnagiri was memorable. Though
Bapat had been to Ratnagiri to preside over the Ratnagiri
District Political Conference, he refused to attend any work
regarding the Conference before he had paid his respects to
Savarkar. And Bapat clung to Savarkar as devotionally as
Bharat embraced Ramachandra in the exile. Bapat then
opened the book of his life before his leader since the days
of his voluntary exile and the transportation of his leader,
Savarkar. It was in Ratnagiri that Sri N. C. Kelkar agreed
with Savarkar and promised to introduce part of Savarkar’s
reforms in the Devanagari script, and well did he fulfil his
promise when he started his new Monthly, Sahyadri.
Dr. Moonje, too, paid a visit to Ratnagiri. His regard for
Savarkar approached reverence. Some years after he even
told a Viceroy that to him Savarkar was next to Shivaji.
Bhai Parmananda’s visit to Ratnagiri was more of a personal
character than a public one. Savarkar’s right-hand man of
London days, Sri V. V. S. Aiyer, met him in Ratnagiri after
fifteen years. Sri Gyanchand Varma of London fame, Sri
Sachindranath Sanyal, Sri Nani Gopal of Andaman fame,
Sri G. V. Mavlankar, now Speaker of the Indian Parliament,
Dr. Madhavrao Patwardhan, D.Lit., Dr. Ketkar, encyclopaedist
of Maharashtra, too, paid their respects to Savarkar at
Ratnagiri.

The Chitpavan (Brahmin) Vidyarthi Sahayyak Sangh
requested Savarkar to address their annual meeting. Savarkar
told them that he could not join an institution, which stood
purely for a particular caste. He added that he would accept
their invitation provided they adopted a change in their
constitution to the effect that in the absence of a worthy



SOCIAL REVOLUTION 179

Chitpavan Brahmin student, any deserving Hindu student
would be awarded the scholarship. They did so and Saveirkar
agreed. Once at Malvan, a town in the southern part of the
District, one ‘ Humanist ’ asked him whether he would like
to be a member of his ‘ Human Religion ! ’ A broad-minded
Hindu as he was, he replied in ihe affirmative, and asked if
there was really such a force as ' Human Religion ’ under the
sun when a State like Russia invested with a universal urge
was extending its frontiers and desiring to bomb the workers
of other coimtries. Savarkar always likes to be a realist
rather than a man of clouds even at the risk of being branded
as a communalist.

Among the other leaders, who visited and interviewed
Savarkar in Ratnagiri, the only man who impressed Savarkar
most was Dr. Ketkar. That is why while paying an obituary
tribute to Dr. Ketkar’s memory in the literary circle at
Ratnagiri in 1937, Savarkar marvelled at the fathomless brains
in the small skull of the Doctor ! A lion alone stops at a lion !

Mr. Yusuf Meher Ali then in the shell of Socialism saw
Savarkar in Ratnagiri and to his bewilderment Savarkar took
him to the inside of the Patit Pavan Mandir, the Pan-Hindu
temple. It was no wonder that rationedist Savarkar should
do so.

The visit of the President of the All-India Gurkha League,
Sri Thakur Chadan Singh, to Ratnagiri along with a represen-
tative of the Royal Family of Nepal was most rousing and
thrilling. It was the outcome of the contact established by the
Ratnagiri Hindu Sabha with Nepal. It was significant that it was
the Maharashtrian statesmanship that viewed the importance
of Nepal on the political and physical map of India with great
concern. It is well-knoAvn now that Tilak had deputed his
heutenant Kakasahib Khadilkar to Nepal in 1903 to open an
arms factory there. Khadilkar began his work under the
guise of some mercantile pursuit, but his project was scented
by the British Government, and Khadilkar was compelled to
return to Poona without accomplishing his object.

It was very strange that the Congress, which fought for
Turkey’s Khilafat and sent a few bottles of medicine to Chiang
Kai Shek in China and a few bushels of grain to Communist
Spain, should deliberately neglect Nepal, a State so much



180 SAVARKAR AND HIS TIMES

interested in India’s destiny and geographically, religiously
and culturally a part and parcel of India. Nay, the Congress-
ites consider^ it nothing less than a foreign State.

The importance and impact of the Gurkha leader’s visit to
Ratnagiri did not escape the British Government’s vigilance.
Savarkar was asked by the Home Department, Bombay, to
submit his explanation and to communicate the speech he
made at the time of the reception of the Gurkha leader. He
did it and nothing came out of it. However, Savarkar was
finally warned that his explanation was not satisfactory and
that any further breach of the conditions imposed upon him
would compel Government to make him undergo the remain-
ing period of his transportation — ^about 37 years, if he referred
to politics publicly or privately ! Government demanded
similar explanations from Savarkar on many other occasions.
Every speech of Savarkar was reported to the Home Depart-
ment, Bombay, through the District Magistrate. On important
occasions Savarkar dictated the summary of his important
speeches to the District Magistrate as a precaution. The mere
word ‘ Swaraj ’ or ‘ Raj ’ in his article or speech was highly
resented by the British Government and many a time he was
threatened with dire consequences. To return to the Gurkha
leader’s visit. The Gurkha leader was tremendously impres-
sed by Savarkar. Hearing and seeing Savarkar, the Gurkha
leader said : “ I have now come to realise what Napoleon
must have been ! ”

And indeed Napoleon and Savarkar, the inveterate enemies
of the British Empire, suffered the greatest humiliation and
mental and physical torments at the hands of the British
Power than any other adversary of the British Power which
squandered crores on Napoleon and lakhs on Savarkar to
crush their undying personalities to a slow tortiuous death.
But undaunted, heroic and invincible as both these heroes
were, they worked and struggled with wrath and righteous-
ness for the downfall of the British Empire. In fact, Savarkar
had the fortime to see the sun set on the British Empire and
in the end his country free and independent !
