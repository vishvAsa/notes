## Maharashtra Physiography

Besides being simple and honest in their habits, Maharashtrians from ancient times (1) have always been brave warrior sufficiently hardy to meet any challenge and tenacious to hold on inspite of unspeakable hardships. That has been their nature for which to a greater extent, the physical conditions of the country are responsible.

"The characteristic features (2) of the Maharashtra country are the great mountain ranges which enclose it on two sides, the Sahyadri range running from north to south, and the Satpura and Vindhya ranges running from east to west, The minor ranges, which break out in rugged outline from these mountain Chains and from the watersheds of many rivers which fall ultimately into the Godavari and into the Krishna, give the whole country an appearance ruggedness and unevenness not to be met with in other parts of India on such a scale. The country thus defined forms a sort of a triangle of which the Sahyadri range and the sea, from Daman to Karwar, form the base, the Satpura range forms the perpendicular side, reaching to the east beyond Nagpur as far as the watershed of the Godavari and its tributaries extend, and the hypotenuse which joins these two ranges has been determined not so much by natural features as by the test of language.

The three (3) distinct physical regions of Maharashtra are: the Kokan, the strip between the Sahyadri and the sea, the Ghatmatha, the country on the top of the ranges, and the Desh, which includes the valleys lower down the river.

With the average rainfall of 100 inches a year in Kokan, which at places is as high as 200 inches, the numerous streams, that carry the water from the Sahyadri to the sea, take the form of mighty swollen rivers in rainy season and make the communication most difficult. The marvel of Ghatmatha is the impregnable forts with which it is studded. They are as many as three hundred, built at different times out of the abrupt flat topped peaks in the Sahyadri ranges. They protect (4) the naturally defensible position of the country and have played an important part in the political history of Maharashtra. The Dash is a vast tract that extends from the Sahyadris in the west to the river Wainganga in the east. The major portion of the Desh is spread over the areas, covered by the river valleys namely: the Purna Tapti valley, the Godawari valley and the Bhima and Krishan valleys. All most all the ancient Capitals of Maharashtra, from Pratishthan of the Andhras to Devgiri of the Yadavas. Are situated here, The Desh can rightly be said to be the cradle of Maharashtra Civilization.

##  The Origin of the Maharashtra and the Marathas 

Maharashtra was called Dandakaranya (5) in ancient times by the Aryan (6) colonists who conquered it and settled down there. The Aryan settlers (7) who were called Ratthas, Maharatthas, or Rashtrakuta, must have been a hardy race in whose character, the best traits of the Aryan settlers from the North, were blended with the best - characteristics of the indigenous stock of western India (8) .In course of time, after they had earned great distinction for wealth, velour, and political power, the land which they had occupied, now began to be called after them as the nation of Maharashtra and their language was known as Maharashtri. An image of Maharatta warrior can be seen in Nane Ghat caves near Junner, which were carved out by the Andhra rulers about the first century before Christ. The present Marathi language is the direct descendent of the Prakrit Maharashtri, the language of Maharashtra (9).

The fifth rock edict (10) of Ashok Maurya (273 to 236 B.C.) mentions the countries of the Rashtrikas and the Aparantas who were his feudatories and to whose dominions; he had sent his -"Dharma Matra". The Ceylonese chronicle (11) Mahavamasa mentions the missions sent after the third Buddist Council at Pataliputa - from which we know that one Rakkhita (Rashtrika) was sent to Vanawasi (afterwards the Capital of Kadamb Kingdom) and a Yona Damma Rakkhita was deputed to Apranta (North Kokan) and Maharakkhita to Maharashtra Country. In the cave temples(12) of Maharashtra, which began to be excavated about the middle of first century before Christ, we find among the list of donors, Princes and Chiefs, who call themselves Mahabhojas and Maharathis. In the great case temple of Kara, the lion pillar in the Court near the entrance was scooped out by a Maharathi name d Agimitra. "Varaha - Mihir (13), a famous astronomer of the sixth century, used the word Maharashtra, which later came to be corrupted into Mahratta or Maratha". Hiuen-Tsang (14) speaks Pulakeshi as the great kshatriya king of Maharashtra. (Mo-ho-la-cha), Rajeshkar (15) a Sanskrit author of the nineth century, used Marahatti (Marathi) in the feminine gender. The poet Jayamangal (16)who lived in twelfth century, clearly defines the geographical limits of Maharashtra as follows : "D"b "TDbD"a"""C ""b"b"> <""" " Maharashtra is the name of country between the river Narmada and the province of Karnatak

##  Ancient Glory and the Subsequent Fall 

In the confused state of affairs, that followed the death of Ashok Maurya(17) , Simukh the first king of the Satavahanas, overthrowing the Northern hegemony, laid down the foundation at Pratishtan at about two hundred thirty B.C. of the first great Empire of Maharashtra. The Puranas, list the names of Thirty kings, that ruled altogther for four centuries and a half. The most famous among them were Gautami Putra Shatakarni (80 to 104 A.D) and yadnyashri Shatakarni. The former, by overthrowing Nahapan, earned the fame as the destroyer of the Shakas, Pahlavas, and Yawanas, whereas, the figure of a ship on the coins of the latter clearly indicates that his rule was not restricted to land alone. At its greatest extent (18) the Satavahan Empire covered the whole of Decean and spread far in to the North as far as Magadha. Under the long rule of the Satvahanas the country entered a period of great industrial and commercial activities. The west (19) and the east coasts were studded with ports like Bhadoch, Sopara and Kalyan, from where trade was carried on to the Malay penisula and eastern archipelago. The properity gave impetus to art and literature, athe glimpses of which can even today be visualised in the wonderful caves at Nasik, Karla, Bhaja and Kanheri.

With the exist of the Satavahanas(20) by the beginning of the third century, the Vakatakas, the Abhiras and the Traikutakas rose to power in the middle of third century, the Wakatakas being the most powerful among them. Pravarsena I was the first great king of the Vakatakas. He performed four ashwamedhas and all the seven Soma sacrifices. Thereafter the assumed the unique Imperial Title 'Samrat'. The Vakatakas were contemporary to the Imperial Guptas. Chandragputa II vikramaditya gave one of his daughers, Prabhawati Gupta to the Vakataka king Rudrasena II. The last great king of the Vakatakas was Harisena. He made extensive conquests from Lata (Southern Gujrat) and the Malwa in the North to Karnataka in the South. In the middle of the sixth century, the Chalukyas of Watapi (Badami in Vijapur District) rose to power. The most powerful of them was Satyashraya Pulakeshi Ii (610 to 642 A.D), during whose reign, the chinese traveller Hiuen-Tsang (21) visited Maharashtra. About the king he observed 'The king in consequences of possessing these men (The Marathas) and elephants, treats his neighbours with contempt. His plans and Undertaking are widespread, and his beneficient actions are felt over a great distance. His subjects obey him with perfect submission." Under Pulakeshi Ii Maharashtra was so powerful that the great Shiladitya (Harsha Vardhana) was unable to sub due him inspite of the fat that his troops came from the five indis, and he had conquered the most of Northern India, "from east to west, and carried his army to remote districts". Not only this but according to Aihole>(22) inscription, in this battle which crushing defeat on the great Harsha, destroying his army of innumerable elephants. The Chalukyas in their turn were succeeded by another powerful dynasty, the Rashkutas, who ruled Maharashtra during about 750 to 975 A.D. Their rule is the most brilliant epoch in the whole history of ancient Maharashtra. Dhruva (23) (779 to 793 A.D.) and Govind III (793 to 814 A.D.) were the greatest kings of the Rashtrakutas, who not only subdued the Deccan but wrested Kanauj, the capital made famous by Harsha Vardhana in the first half of seventh century, by defeating in the trianguler contest the Gurjara Pratiharas and the Palas. Indra III (915 to 917 A.D.) and Krishan III (939 to 963 A.D.) were also equally great kings who revived the glory of Dhruva and Govind III. Sulaiman (24), the Arab merchant who traveled in the Western India in the middle of ninth century, mentions the Rashtrakuta ruler Amoghavarsha I as one of the four greatest rulers of the world, the other three being the Caliph of Bagadad, the Emperor of China and the Emperor of Constantinople. During the reign of Krushna I (756 to 768 A.D.) the magnificent specimen of Hindu art and the veritable wonder of the world, the Kailas temple was excavated at Verula, out of the solid rock. The Rashtrakutas were followed by the Later Chajukyas who in turn ruled for some two hundred years (during 975 to 1189 A.D.) from their Capital Manyakhet and Kalyani. Then came the Yadavas of Deogiri (the hill abode of Gods) who reigned for over one hundred years (from 1187 to 1294 A.D.)

During these years Marathi language had gradually evolved almost imperceptible from Prakrit Maharashtri and had reached The stage of perfection (25), During these years the save temples of Ajantha, Verula and the rest had been excavated. They were the symbol of the past peace and prosperity, artistic excellence, worldly grandeur, religious amity and the peak of creative activities of the people who had lived in the age of abundance that was based on the sound foundation of thriving trade and commerce. With the background of such remarkable heritage, Raja Ramdeo (26) of the dynasty of the Yadavas, the name made famous by Shri Krishan, was ruling at Deogiri with justice as per the Hindu way of religion and custom. The whole structure seemed as perfect and as sound as the 'Hamadpanti' stone temples, a new style of architecture, named after the famous Yadava Minister Hemadri..

Astonishingly enough, the whole structure collapsed like a house of cards with the contact of the first Turk adventurer from the North, who came with only seven thousand horse in 1294 A.D (27). His strength and tacties proved more than enough to destroy the power and prestige of Ramdeo who saved himself for the time being by paying ahuge indemnity and accepting the humiliating subordinate position. But this was only the beginning of the end, which soon followed in 1318 A.D. when Mubarak Khalji flayed alive Harpaldeo, the last of the independent line of the ancient kings of Maharashtra. The ancient world simbolised by Pratishtahn, Shurparak, Kalyani, Manyakhet, Watapipur, Vinawasi and Deogiri, all of a sudden came to an end and a new rule alien in race, religion, culture, and way of life totally unsympathetic to the way of the people of Maharashtra was established in the country. This Muslim rule(28) was so firmly and so soon established and the Yadava lineage was so thoroughly cut off that no Yadava price or any Yadava Chief like KapayaNayaka, Somdeo Chaulkya or any Harihar or Bukka, could take the advantage of the disruption of the Delhi Sultanate in Decean after 1730 A.D. that was much due to the freedom movement which was partly religious(29) and partly political. As a result of this movement by 1736 A.D., excepting Maharashtra, the rest of the Deccan including Telangana, Andhara, Karnataka and Pandya Desh (Mabar - at first under the Muslim rule(30) which was submerged in to Vijaya Nagar Empire by 1770 A.D.) slipped out of the Muslim rule and became independent. But no such sign of political life was visible in Maharashtra, which looked passively to a few foreign Musalmans establishing a Bahamani kingdom(31) at Daulatabad in 1347 in defiance of the might of the Delhi Sultan Muhammad Tughlak.

Under the foreign Bahamanis, the people were completely cowed down. Positions of the power and trust were monopolised by the Muhammedans. The sultans(32) hardly cared for their subjects Famines like the one known as "Durga Devi Famine" (33) (1392 to 1404 A.D.) carried away lakhs of people. The Russian merchant Athanasium (34) Nikitin who lived in Bidar during 1470 to 1474 A.D. records: "The land is overstocked with people, but those in the country are very miserable, whilst the nobles are extremely opulent and delight in luxury. They are wont to be carried on their silver beds, preceded by some twenty men on horse back and by five hundred on foot and by horsemen, ten torchbearers and musicians ".

May of the Bahamani Sultans were fanatics and they tried to spread Islam by razing temples and building masques in their places, Even the liberal Mahamud Gawan the famous Minister of Bahamani can not escape from the charge of religious Bigotry. In his Ministership(36) the Bahamani troops levelled the city and the temples of Kanchipuram.

##  The Spiritual Upheaval of Bhakti Pantha 

The loss of independence was followed by the loss of social status for the Hindus. But the situation was still aggravated when the Muslim power tried to spread its religion by raising the temples to ground and building masques in their places and forcing the people by converting them to Islam. Clearly the religion was in danger(37) and the society was helpless to defend it. At such critical times it was the Bhakti movement that kept up the morale of the society. This movement was carried by the saints, the followers of 'Bhagawat - Dharma(38), from Saint.

Dyanadeo to Tukaram. Especially(39) during fiteenth and sixteenth centuries it was in fact a religious, social and literary revival, based on the spirit of Hindu brotherhood, through love and faith in God Vithoba of Pandharpur. "These saints and writers(40) were mostly men of learning and experience, - having widely travelled on pilgrimage through India on foot and gained first hand information of local occurrences which they often actually witnessed. They delivered orations and held Hari Kirtans and supported the spiritual background to political aims of workers like Shivaji. They made ardent and piteous appeal to God Almighty on behalf of the oppressed peoples and bring them relief from Muslim persecution. " As the followers of common Bhagwat Dharma, all loved one another and a spiritual Hindu brotherhood thus came into existence, having the Vithoba at their head, spreading love and eternal happiness to his Bhaktas. The poor and oppressed, thus forgetting the wordly miseries faced their lot with a happy and contended frame of mind. Such was the spiritual defiance(41) put up by the saints to the foreign Muslim rulers of Deccan, who ultimately failed to realize their goal(42) .

##  The effect of the disruption of the Bahamany Kingdom 

Unlike the Northern Muslim power at Delhi, the Bahamany kingdom was separated by a great distance from their base Camp beyond the North-Western frontier. Hence the Turks, Arabs, the Persians and the Mongals were not regularly recruited(43) from time to time. But the foreign Musalmans, though less in number as compared to the Deccan Musalmans in the Sultan's service, monopolised(44) the higher posts in civil and military offices. This gave rise to a rivalry between them and the local Deccani Musalmans. Besides, the situation was aggravated by the haughty attitude of these foreigners who looked down upon the Deccans as totally inferior(45) to them. The result of such a rivalry(46) was the bloody feud in which the Decanis party slew some 1200 Sayyads and about 1000 other foreigners in 1453 A.D. This was the signal of the dissolution of the Bahamany kingdom itself, which took place after the execution of Mahamud Gawan, the last great victim of this rivalry in 1581 A.D. Nothing could then stop the disruption of the kingdom hereafter and the five branches of the Bahamany came into existence in the first quarter of the sixteenth century.

The fall of Bahamanis in Deccan synchronized with the establishment of a powerful Muslim dynasty under Babar in 1526 A.D. at Delhi. His grandson Akbar became the master of the whole of the Northern india by 1595 A.D. Next year he invaded Ahmadnagar and with the Session of Berar(47) by Chandbibi the conquest of the Deccan by the Mughals began.

The Bahamanis never cared to win over the affection of their Hindu subjects and their policy in general was to keep them aloof from the positions of power and trust. But with the creation of five Sultanates in the first quarter of sixteenth century, with their mutual jealousies and with the impending danger from the north by the end of sixteenth century, the entire aspect of the question was changed. Now the Sultanates were obliged to enlist the Hindus in civil and later on in military services. At the same time, with the defeat of the Hindu Empire of Vijaynagar at Rakshasi Tangdi in 1565, at the hands of the Muslim confederates, the capital of Vijayanagar began to shift south - wards from Vijayanagar to Penukonda and later on to chandragiri. The Maratha Chiefs, enlisted in the service of Vijayanagar, unwilling(48) to move southwards, returned to Maharashtra and offered their services to the Sutans of Ahmedanagar, Vijapur and Gowalkonda.

##  The revival

"The Marathas(49) as a people doubles possessed in their van high blood and noble tradition derived through ages from their royal ancestors such as the Mauryas, the Rashtrakutas, the Chalukyas and the Yadavas, not to mention the more recent additions to the original stock by the arrivals from time to time of north Indian Rajput tribes such as the Paramars (Ghorpades, the Mohites, the Mahadiks, the Gujars, the Shirkes, the Sawants, the Ghates, the Manes, the Dafles, the various Deshmukh of he Mawals, several of whom adopted new surnames, in some cases from the place they occupied in the Daccan and from other sources.

" The Marathas(50), in general the descendents of the Aryan Kshatriya stock, had become formidable soldiers and worriers with the experience of war-fare between the Vijaynagar and the Mohemedan powers, for some two hundred years (1347 to 1565) before their entry into services of the Sultanates in the latter half, and the beginning of 17th Century. Their valuable exertions were soon appreciated and they rose to prominence. The employment as the soldiers gave them dignity and status and their bands both cavalry and infantry formed a respectable army under the Sultanates while opposing the Mughals. As they became indispensable to the Sultans, they became assertive and called themselves 'Rajes' and with the formidable forts in the Ghats or elsewhere they became virtually masters of their Jahagirs.

The penetration of Deccan, begun by Akbar at the end of 16th century, was carried on with great vigor by his successors from Jahagir to Aurangazeb. The importance of the Marathas was still raised, when they rallied forth for the defense of the sultans. It was in the defence of Niazmshahi that the genius of Shahaji Bhosale shone brilliently at Bhatwadi(51) in Novemeber 1624 in support of Malik Ambar. He continued the defence of Nizamshahi, even after the death of Malik Amber, against the odds and had been nearly successful(52) in creating a dominion for him in the Sahyadris in 1733 under a thin veil of Nizamshahi. Through unsuccessful he was fortunate enough to see his mission carried on to completion under his eyes by his able so Shivaji.

The scattered elements of the Maratha chiefs, needed self realization only and the time at last was ripe. Keeping before them, such lofty ideal(53) as the restoration of Hindu empire in Hindustan and pursuing it with singleness(54) of purpose against the mighty Mughal empire and the two Muslim Kingdoms and the host of others Hindu chiefs like Chandrarao More, who could not even dream of an independent Hindu Kingdom, he achieved the object which was felt as something imaginary at the beginning (55).

No nation is built abruptly. It was invitable culmination of the proud heritage of the glorious past, with the political as well as military experiences that the Marathas had acquired during the previous three centuries in the services of Vijaynagar and the three off-shoots of Bahamani namely Ahmadnagar, Vijapur and Gowalkonda, backed by the spiritual upheaval of the Bhakti movement and the natural defenses of the Western Ghats. As a result, a Hindu Kingdom, with Chhatrapati Shivaji at the helm, was established at Raygarh in 1674 A.D.

##  The nation successfully faces the Catastrophe 

After Shivaji's death, Sambhaji succeeded in securing the Maratha throne in 1680 A.D. He received the fugitive prince Muhammad Akbar, who was in rebellion against his father Aurangzeb. The Emperor, realizing the gravity of the danger, concluded peace with the Rajput Rana of Udaypur with whom he was at war, and marched southwards, for the subjugation of Deccan to fulfil the task begun by his great grand father Akbar. He reached Aruangabad on 1st of April 1682 A.D.

Within five years, he was successful in destroying the two remaining off shoots of Bahamani Kingdom namely Vijapur and Gowalkonda in September 1686 A.D. respectively. Next came the turn of the Maratha Chhatrapati who was captured(56) and tortured to death in March 1689 A.D. Soon Rajgadh, the Capital of Marathas was captured with Sambhaji's family in 1690 A.D.(57)

Thus it appeared that Aurangzeb had been successful (58) in his mission. The whole country(59) from Narmada to Tungabhadra lay at his feet. It seemed as if Shivaji and the men whom he had led to victory, had lived and died in vain. The great deluge against which Shivaji and Shahaji had strugged to protect the country for over sixty years, now swept over the land carrying every thing before it and there seemed no sign of any possible resistance. "But the efforts(60) of the great Shivaji had not been lost in vain. The marathas had in fact not been cowed down, as the Emperior had supposed. It was in fact the beginning of his end. With spirit undaunted(61) and courage that never failed, the Marathas fought against the whole of the resources of the Mughal Empire brought to bear against them with renewed vigour. It soon became people's war (62) and the determined and the prolonged efforts of Aurangzeb proved futile against the united will of the people. This long - drawn and terrible war of 25 years ate up his whole resources and his grand army(63) was beaten down completely in the long run. Finally he succumbed to the inevitable and died a broken hearted man in his camp at Ahmnadnagar on 20th February 1707 A.D, "No curtain ever dropped on a more woeful tragedy.

##  The down of the new era 

After, the death of Aurangzeb, prince Azam (64) marched northwards, with the remaining grand army, for the impending Civil war had broken out. To create diversion amongst the Marathas he released Shahu (65) in Malwagranting him Chauth and Sardeshmukhi over the six Deccan Subhas, namely Khandesh, Berar, Aurangabad, Bedar, Hydrabad and Vijapur, Shahu was also appointed Governor of Gondwana, Gujarat and Tanjor. As expected by the Mughals, Tarabai refused to surrender the claims of her son and prepared to resist Shahu till last. Shahu, however, was successful in capturing Satara, the seat of the Maratha Kingdom, where he was crowned as the Chhatrapati on 12th January 1708 A.D. For this as well as for the subsequent events of national importance, Shahu was fortunate in getting the services of Balaji Vishwanath, whom he made his Peshwa in 1713 A.D.

The nation had stood the trials of unspeakable harships and won the life and death struggle against the Mughals but at a very high cost. Law and Order had disappeared from the county. A rival Chhatrapati (66) at Kolhapur was a constant source of divided loyalties with the encouragement of the Muslim Subhadar at Aurangabad for his own profit. Shahu's rule was practically confined to his Capital and a few hill forts and the remaining country was in a state of anarchy. The Peshwa was successful in suppressing the free boaters who were unwilling to submit to the discipline of the State, but the rest of the powerful Maratha Chiefs were virtually independent. Thus the great victory over the Mughals would have been nothing but calamity with the separatist tendencies at full play, if no national aim with full opportunities for diversing the energies, would have been supplied. And fortunately the opportunity for the necessary diversion did some.

Farrukh Siyar (67) came to throne on 17th January 1713 A.D. defeating Jahandar Shah (the successor of Bhadur Shah) mainly with the help of Sayyad brothers - Sayyed Abdulla and Sayyad Husain Ali. The six years of his regime are the momentous years that afforded the Marathas the needed outlets to expand in all directions beyond their national limits. The reason was the changing politics at the Delhi Court where the fickle - minded, suspicious and cowardly Emperor kept on plotting incessantly for the ruin of his powerful ministers who had been mainly the cause of his success.

From the very commencement of his regime a party hostile to Sayyad brothers, was formed at the Court by the Emperor's personal favorites and attendant who tried at every step to hinder the administration of the Sayyad brothers. At last tired of the recurring plotting followed by submission on the part of the Emperor who was devoid of any consistency to his own promises, the ministers removed Mir-Jumla, the chief instigator, to the viceroyalty of Bihar and in return Husain Ali, agreed to leave the Court as a viceroy of Deccan.

Daudkhan Pani (68) had governed the Mughal Deccan since 1708 A.D. as the deputy of Zulfikar Khan, who was assassinated at the hands of Farrukh Siyar in 1713 A.D. Nizam-ul-Mulk bahadur Fath Jang was then appointed to the government of Deccan, Daud Khan being transferred to Gujarat, in July 1713 A.D.

Now, to make room for Hussain Ali (69), the Nizam-ul-Mulk, was transferred to the insignificant Faujdari of Moradabad in 1715 A.D., much against his will. The Nizam belonged to Turani group that was opposed to Sayyad brothers and hence it is no wonder that when Hussain Ali and the Nizam passed through Malwa, no customary formality of exchanging visits as brother officers was observed. The antagonism between the Emperor and his ministers i.e. the Sayyad brothers, had reached such a ptich, that the former called upon Daud Khan Pani from Gujarat to march against the Sayyad and finish him off. As a result, the Sayyad met him in a deadly combat near Burhanpur on 26th August 1715 A.D., in which Daud Khan was killed and the Sayyad came out victorious. But due to this open act of hostility on the part of the Emperor, Husain Ali in Deccan and his brother Abdulla at Delhi felt their very existence threatened. They were compelled, henceforth, to act according to the instinct of self-preservation. This very fact is most important from the Maratha standpoint, since it is concerned with the moulding of their policy towards Delhi in the near future.

Husain Ali (70) strenuously tried for two years, to check Maratha inroads in Baglan and Khandesh but since he found that he stood in great danger in between the treacherous master at Delhi and the turbulent Maratha in South, he had to reverse his policy towards the Marathas and instead of opposing them he had to stretch his hand for their friendship.

The terms agreed upon by both the parties at Satara were (71):

(1) That all the territories known as Shivaji's Swarajya together with the forts therein, should be delivered to Shahu in full possession.

(2) That such territories as had been recently conquered by the Marathas in Khandesh, Berar, Gondwana, Haidrabad and Karnatak should also be ceded to them as part of the Maratha Kingdom.

(3) That the Marathas should be allowed to collect Chauth and Sardeshmukhi from all the six Mughal Subhas in the South. In return for the Chauth the Marathas were to serve the Emperor with a Contingent of 15 thousand troops for his protection. In return for the Sardeshmukhi the Maratha were to be responsible for maintaining order by preventing robbery and rebellion.

(4) That Shahu should do no harm to Sambhaji of Kolhapur.

(5) That the Marathas should make a cash payment annually of ten lakhs of Rupees to the Emperor by way of tribute, and lastly.

(6) That the Emperor should release and send back from Delhi Shahu's mother Yeshubai, his wife and his brother Maddening with all followers that were detained there.

The Emperor(72) did not approve of the whole transaction. He realized the danger he was running into by antagonizing the powerful Sayyads and hastily called back to his presence Nizam-ul-Mulk from Moradabad. Sarbuland Khan from Patna and Ajitsing from Gujarat. Thereupon Sayyad Abdulla sent urgent calls to his brothers to repair to the Capital from the South without a moment's delay.

Husain Ali left Aurangabad with the Maratha contingent of 15 thousand troops in November 1718 A.D. and reached Delhi on 16th February Farrukh Siyar was deposed and another Shahjada was put up on the throne.

The most important fact to be noted in this revolution is that, Ajitsing of Marwad sided with the Sayyad brothers along with the Marathas(73). The Nizam kept silence for the time being and got the government of Malwa as the price for his neutrality. As soon as the palace revolution was over the Sayyads prepared formal grants(74) for the three items of Swarajya, Chauthai, and Sardeshmukhi and delivered them at Balaji, duly ratified under the imperial seal (March 1719 A.D.) Shahu's mother and the rest of the party in confinment at Delhi, for the last 12 years, were released and delivered over.

These  Sanads(75) were utilized most diplomatically as the base for expansion all over India by the Marathas. It provided exactly the due facilities that they required. An orderly government for Shahu's Swarajya came to be immediately organized, the divided loyalties came to an with an immensely vast field that was made available to them and all this was accomplished within a short period of twelve years from the death of Aurangzeb who could have never dreamt that the insignificant Marathas from the Deccan hillocks would play such a significant part in a revolution at Delhi, so soon after his death.

A new era providing the best opportunities had dawned for the enterprising Marathas. Delhi, supposed to be far off hitherto, came within their sight and 'towards North' soon became the watchward under the next inspiring young Peshwa Bajirao I, who was invested with the robes of the first minister by Chhatrapati Shahu on 17th April 1720 A.D., after the death of his father Balaji Vishwanath.


## Foot Notes (Description)

(1) "This country is about 5000 li in circuit. The capital boarders on the west on a great river. It is about 30 li round. The soil is rich and fertile, it is regualrly cultivated and very productive. The climate is hot, the disposition of the people is honest and simple, they are fall of stature, and of a stern, vindictive character. To their benefactor they are grateful, to their enemies relentless. If thy are insulted, they will risk their life to savage themselves. If they are asked to help one in distress, are going to seek revenge, they first give their enemy warning, then each being armed they attack each other with lances, When one turns to flee, the other pursues him, but they do not kill a man down (a person who submits). The country provides for a band of champions to the number of several hundred. Each time they are about to engage in conflict, they intoxicate themselves with wine, and then one man with lance in hand will meet ten thousand and challenges them in fight.

" The people are completely crushed (by the Muslim rule). There is dire poverty in the land and no ray of hope is visible, Hindu women are molested, raped and sold as slaves in far off countries. Crops failed and villages have been devastated. People fled from their homes in abject misery and several died of starvation. Every thing is taken away and only the country remained. It is a calamity for all and there is no escape from it. When the low born became masters, the religion comes to an end who cares then for the learned brahimin". - Saint Ramdas.

(41) The Story of Saint Eknath of Paithan (15th Century) may explain the state of affairs prevailing in Maharashtra under the foreign rule. While on his way back from Godawari, one day after his bath, as usual, a certain Muslim officer spat on him from the gallery. The saint went back to the river and again took a dip. But this he had to perform innumberable times. At last, it is said the officer got tired and begged pardon of Eknath. A visitor to Paithan can still witness the house of the Muslim Officer at Paithan, reminding one the incident.
