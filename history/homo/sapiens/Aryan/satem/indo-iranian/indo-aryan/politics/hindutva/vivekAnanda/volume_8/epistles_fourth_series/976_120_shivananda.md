*To Swami Shivananda*

JAIPUR,  
*27th December, 1897*.

MY DEAR SHIVANANDA,

Mr. Setlur of Girgaon, Bombay, whom you know very well from Madras
writes to me to send somebody to Africa to look after the religious
needs of the Indian emigrants in Africa. He will of course send the man
and bear all expenses.

The work will not be congenial at present, I am afraid, but it is really
the work for a perfect man. You know the emigrants are not liked at all
by the white people there. To look after the Indians, and at the same
time maintain cool-headedness so as not to create more strife â€” is the
work there. No immediate result can be expected, but in the long run it
will prove a more beneficial work for India than any yet attempted. I
wish you to try your luck in this. If you agree, please write to Setlur,
about your willingness and ask for more information, mentioning this
letter. And godspeed to you! I am not very well, but am going to
Calcutta in a few days and will be all right.

Yours in the Lord,  
VIVEKANANDA.
