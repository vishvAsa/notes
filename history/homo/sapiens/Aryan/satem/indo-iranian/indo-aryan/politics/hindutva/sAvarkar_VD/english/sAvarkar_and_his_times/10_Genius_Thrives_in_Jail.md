## I

In his utter helplessness and colossal frustration of life
Savarkar was striving superhumanly to wring some good
out of it. A true ascetic and man of action as he was, he
resolved to make the most of life and to make the best of it.
Such men of supreme courage and indomitable mil make
appearance from age to age. Stone walls do not imprison
them, nor do iron bars encage them. Their angelic souls rise
above and soar. Their life is real. Earnestness is its breath.
The grave is not its goal. Their souls are indestructible. A
cruel thread of destiny was weaving and tightening round the
neck of Savarkar. Despite the horrible and indescribable
agonies, his genius throve in jail.

Ever since his childhood, when he was quite ignorant of
what an epic was like, Savarkar had a mind to compose an
epic on ‘ Panipat ^ but, being a poet of action, he could not
find time for this great work. He seized this opportunity
and almost achieved his goal. And this marvellous feat was
performed in the dark Andamans where reading and writing
was a crime. He had no paper, nor had he pencil. In prison
life philosophy is the ultimate refuge of a troubled soul. And
we know how all distinguished political prisoners of world
fame wrote famous histories, autobiographies, works on
philosophy and other kind of great works.

John Bimyan wrote his immortal Pilgrim's Progress^ Thomas
Moor wrote his Utopia, Sir Walter Raleigh, his History of the
world, Tilak, his Gita Rahasya, Hitler, his Mein Kampf, and
Nehru, his Autobiography and Glimpses of World History.
Fortimately all these eminent men were supplied with writing
and reading facilities. But Savarkar was the only eminent poli-
tical prisoner of world fame who composed some ten thousand
and odd lines of poetry of great imagination and of great
thought, wrote them on the prison walls with thorns and
pebbles, learnt them by heart secretly, and astounded the
imagination of the world, giving an ocular proof of how the
Vedas have been handed down ever since the childhood of
civilization ! Just imagine the unbending tenacity and undying
will power of a young man undergoing a sentence for half-
a-century, who, while hanging in handcuffs during the punish-
ment hours of jail life, recited, revised and learnt by heart
his poems. Add to this, his untiring energy and ingenuity in
making the wild criminals and devotional colleagues learn
some of those poems by heart. After their release they went
to Savarkar’s brother, Dr. N. D. Savarkar, and recited them
dutifully and faithfully for reproduction.

Savarkar is a term s5monymous with patriotism in the
domain of Indian politics and poetry. The parent thought of
his poetry is the worship of the Goddess of Freedom. He
sings : —

> We dedicated to thee our thoughts  
Our speech, our eloquence to thee. Oh Mother !
My lyre sang of thee alone and  
My pen wrote of thee alone, Oh Mother !

And

> For thy sake death is life  
Without thee life is death.

And

> O Mother, who will dare insult thee in the world  
We will give thee bath of his blood.

And

> Even so this our Motherland craving the assistance  
Of the Lord that she too be rescued from the crocodile  
Clutches of Bondage enters our Garden, plucks  
A fresh flower from the bough and offers  
It at His feet in worship.

And

> Deathless is the family that falls to a man,  
For the emancipation of its Motherland,  
Filling the skies with the fragrance of their sacrifice,  
Made in the welfare of Man’s rise.

Abject slavery and crushing foreign yoke are the source of
his note. Glorious past is its inspiration. Patriotism is its
song, Swaraj its aim and Humanity its goal. His poems and
ballads have enchanted and in.spired numerous patriots, and,
though suppressed by Government, were secretly circulated
from sire to son. No other Bharatiya poet except Valmiki,
Vyas and the great poets Chand and Bhushan— the latter pair
sang the declining glory of the Rajputs— has sung of glorious
victories of the Hindus, Hindu life, history and culture so
immensely and epically as Savarkar has done. No other
modern Hindu iwet has preached and ])ropagated love for
Swaraj and Swadharma so intensely, fervently and stirringly
as Savarkar has done. Savarkar represents an admirable
combination of the valour of Veer Arjun and the poetic genius
of Veda Vyas !

Sri G. T. Madkholkar, an eminent Mahratta literary critic,
describes Savarkar as a poet who rivals Kalidas in the use of
similes, a poet on the war path bristling with vigour, genius,
learning and the lustre of the spear of the Mahratta warriors,
who hammered the Mogul throne of Delhi to pieces and the
sweetness of all the emotions of the Mahratta saint-poets who
have raised this mortal world to the level of the abode of
Vishnu. “ It is because of all this,” observes Madkholkar,
“ that I make bold to say that Savarkar occupies the first and
foremost place in the galaxy of Marathi poets.”

According to Madkholkar, Savarkar is perhaps the only
poet who has during the last thirty years made conscious
efforts to inflame the urge for independence and the sense of
self-respect by holding before the Hindus, who were deprived
of their freedom, the grand picture of the ancient glory and
the valiant deeds of the past. The reason why all of Savarkar’s
literary productions have assumed such a fascinating and
sublime quality is that Savarkar has so beautifully and
lavishly made use of Vedic, epic and historical ideas in his
poetry, plays and other works. Madkholkar concludes : “ In
his poems he has strung together so many beautiful and
sublime ideas about Hindu life, culture, philosophy, and
history that in the poetry of no modern poet of the last
hundred years can they ever be found.”

Savarkar’s poetry has an autobiographical note and is
subjective par excellence. He is a poet of action, of great
personal experience, of lofty imagination, of noble emotions,
of great sincerity and of great personality. His poetry bears
a unique charm. His is great poetry of rare thrill, epic
sweep, sky-high range, and grand metre ! His thoughts
breathe, his words burn. Though hurled from the siunmit
of a mountain into the limitless ocean, or into the frying-pan,
the undying soul of Savarkar, like Pralhad, survives and
sings songs of God and Man. Himself a subject of an epic,
he has produced an epic. Poet Savarkar belongs to the line
of great poets. It is easy and safe for a poetical soul to sing
mystic and vague songs of grand eternity, eyeless fraternity
and aimless liberty at a time when his own kith and kin are
ground under the heels of slavery and poverty. But it is given
to a few poets of Savarkar’s nerve and mission to raise the
fallen in revolt and to drive a slave country to a fight for
freedom. The reward for the former class is some coveted
prize. The prize for the latter cast is the rope ! Only the
definite, daring and self-experienced poetry can soar in the
realm of this inspired class.

There are good poets in Marathi. But in the words of
Dr. K. N. Watwe, Ph.D., and Acharya Atre, two foremost
authorities on Sanskrit and Marathi Poetry respectively, even
a dozen of that class would not together make one Savarkar.
The difference between them and Savarkar is the difference
between the simile and the metaphor. Some of them have
repeated or expressed the thoughts of others, the sensations
of others, the emotions of others. Savarkar has expressed
his own emotions, his own sensations, his own thoughts. His
style may, at some places, lack the ‘ correctitude ’ of strict
school-masters and dry professors. In that Deathland he
could not prune and polish it ! Yet, in personality, in sincerity,
in style, and in prophetic vision, he is superior to them all.
In greatness of sweep, in loftiness of imagination, in the gift
of prophetic vision, he scarcely yields to the great ones of
world poetry. Take, for example, Savarkar’s magnum opus
in poetry, the Kamala. His Kamala rivals in delineation and
delicacy with Shakespeare’s Miranda or Shakuntala of
Kalidas.

Savarkar’s creative imagination is powerful and is ever on
its wings. In the twinkling of an eye it perches on the tower
of the universe. “ It surveys the royal procession of the Lord
of the Universe marching in pomp and splendoxir. The ages
are its miles and through the fi-iction of the wheels of His
Chariot have sprung dusty .sparks that are shining as stars.

In its pomp and splendour the procession is climbing down the
path of Time. Tlie comets are its arrows, the solar system
is the row of fireworks going on. Sun.s and Moons are torches
and Life if' its energy ! To Savarkar’s lofty imagination the
whole universe is the image of God. Shiva. The limitless sky
is its hair and in it are the Moon and the Milky Way 1

Savarkar compares lotuses in water to hali-nude Gopikas
bewitched by Krishna, bathing in the Yamuna. To him
Kamala, the heroine in liis long Poem, looks as fascinating in
a porched sofa as does a simile in the poetry of Kalidas. He
describes her beauty in a marvellous simile. To him Kamala
looks like the sweet dawn between fading moonlight and
blooming of the day. To him at dawn stars look like the
frozen drops of dew. He calls the butterfly an agent of the
God of Love or Cupid that flies from flower to flower
transporting kisses. Flowers are the imprints of kisses taken
by the watchman of the nymphs who enter the garden secretly.
In his famous Ballad on Sinhagad, the sea, the mother of gems,
envies the lot of the eairth because it has sheltered the
invaluable jewel Tanaji, who fell fighting on the Kondana
Fort.

What great, grand and good poetry ! The wonder of it
is that it blossomed in the wild Andamans ! The collection
of his poems are aptly named as “ Wild Flowers.” These
flowers have not met with world-wide appreciation for want
of an agency that would distribute these flowers among the
appreciating public of the world at large. Though complete
in themselves, “ Kamala,” “ Gomantak,” “ Saptarshi,” “ Vira-
hochhvas ” “ Mahasagara ” are parts of the incomplete epic.
His other poems, “ Chain,” “ Cell,” “ Chariot festival of Lord
Jagannath,” “ Oh Sleep,” and “ On Death Bed ” have a
philosophical basis. These poems shed a searchlight on the
innermost comer of the heart of Savarkar who loves entire
secession from worldly affairs and who is in his heart of hearts
an ascetic loving a retired and contemplative life intent on
soul-contemplation ! To Savarkar engrossed in such soul-
contemplation the very Shanivar Wada, the perennial source
of political inspiration, is a heap of stones ! But the world
around has not reached that divine stage of viewing things
through such an angle! Peoples are crying for food,
freedom, and faith. The worldly man comes out and
he is Savarkar, the revolutionary realist ! Did the great
Shankaracharya study modern science and world and make
his reappearance in Bharat Varsha ?

Hence it is cleai- that Savarkar’s outlook on life is that of
an ascetic moving in great events. Love of action and not
renunciation of action has become the predominant and
positive note of his life and literature. His views on the
Vedant philosophy are ever to be remembered. He writes
from the Andamans to his brother : “ The Americans need
Vedanta philosophy and so does England, for they have
developed their life to that fulness, richness and manliness —
to Kshatriyahood and so stand on the threshold of that
Brahminhood, wherein alone the capacity to read and realize
such philosophy can co-exist. But India is not. We are at
present all Shudras and can’t claim access to the Vedas and
Vedanta. . . . We, as a nation, are unfit for these sublime
thoughts, for it is well known that Bajirao II was a great
Vedantist and that is why, perhaps, he could not see the
difference between a kingdom and a pension. Let us study
history, political science, science, economy ; live worthily in
this world, fulfil the householders’ duties and then the
philosophic dawn might come.”

To him life on this earth is like a three petalled flower. One
is coloured with pleasure, the second with the colour of pain,
the third mixed or colourless. Now the petal of pleasure and
then that of pain gets warmed and thus this vain round of
recurrence goes on. According to him the true picture of the
world is one wherein a tigress with a piece of fle.sh of deer
in its mouth is suckling its babe, a picture of pity
and cruelty. Savarkar is not a bloodthirsty man. He is
guided by the noble precept laid down by Lord Krishna : “ Do
unto others as thou wouldst be done by.” He says he was a
revolutionary under necessity and not by inherent choice.
He sincerely abhors absolute violence. Where is the man
who would run the ordeals of fire or would tread the paths of
furies with bleeding feet for sheer amusement, he asks. He
is a man who always fights for a just and righteous cause, lor
the protection of the good and for the destruction of the
evil-doers. “ For it was this very principle,” he states, ” that
humanity was a higher patriotism that made us so restless
when we saw that a part of it should aggrandise and swell
like a virulent cancer in such wise as to threaten the life of
the human whole, and forced us. for want of any other
effective remedy, to take to the surgeon’s knife and feel that
severity for the moment would certainly lie mercy in the long
run.” He says in his poem, “ On Death Bed ” : “If ever 1
deemed it legitimate to have recourse to the exceptional swift
and severe rules of emergency, it w'a.s only because duty led
me and my generation into circumstances so abnormal and
urgent as to render them indispensable in the interest of
righteousness itself.” Duty for the sake of duly ! And he
interpreted that duty of man. He says : “ Though the wise
men, priests and sooth-sayers speak differently and in diverse
accents, yet whatever conduces to the progress of Man,
whatever contributes to the greatest good of the human soul
and had been approved by the pious and the pure that alone
I took to be the Duty of Man.”

Death had no horrors for Savarkar. He said that he had
paid the debt of the Motherland by facing the furious fire,
getting himself consumed bone by bone and flesh by flesh,
that he had paid the debt of God by fighting under ‘His
Banner,’ that he had adopted the Abhinava Bharat to continue
the line of his family. He realized the kinship with all that
breathed in the Universe and at times was so overpowered
with a sense of Universal sympathy that his feet would get
stuck to the spot lest he should trample to death under his
feet some blades of grass, or worms. Often in his pensive
mood he held the morsel in his hand, thinking that it contained
seeds which were flesh and life striving to grow and enjoy
the air they breathed.

If he dies in despair, he says, he will not feel sorry for there
is no end to one’s desires and ambitions. If the end of life is
shifting to another life according to merits, he is confident
that a good place will be reserved for him as he possesses the
best testimonials from Lord Krishna himself that he served
selflessly for the cause of Man, God and Country. If life is
to disintegrate into fragments and atoms, death will be to him
a sound sleep in that case ; or let those atoms, he says, forget
themselves and let the ‘ I ’ in him disappear into the Universal
oneness !

Yet one more point is to be noted about Savarkar, the poet.
He has introduced blank verse metre called ‘ Vainayak ’ into
Marathi poetry. The Anushtubha metre of the Ramaxja7ia
and the Mahahharata fame, Milton’s blank verse metre which
poet Madhusudan of Bengal has popularized in Bengal,
charmed him exceedingly in his school and Andaman days.

The romanticism in Savarkar’s poetry has been properly
bridled by a sense of realism, a love of service and sacrifice,
and a goal of universalism. His head is towering up in the
Universe, his mind weighing good and bad, and his eyes
watchful for the greatest good of Man. Front-rank critics
and great ones of Marathi literature from N. C. Kelkar
to G. T. Madkholkar, from Daji Nagesh Apte to P. K. Atre,
all have paid glowing tributes to his genius and have been
fascinated by the flights of Savarkar’s imagination conveying
great and good thoughts !


## II

In the Andamans Savarkar had ample tune to philosophize
his political theories and theorise his political philosophy. His
thoughts, reading and experience evolved into a definite
ideology. The seeds of his ideology took firm root and
sprouted into a tree. The decrease in the population of the
Hindus and the consequent danger to Hindusthan by the rise
of rival and ahen proselytizing faiths absorbed his mind. In
Europe people belong to one religion. There strife is between
races for predominance and domination. In India it is a
question of rival religions, where kidnapping and conversion
are ostensibly done in the name of religion to strengthen a
rival faith. The danger Savarkar scented was clear, straight,
and tremendous.

Though the British Government had to resort to a policy of
non-interference in religious affairs, they were in a way not
inclined to curb the proselytizing activities of the Muslims.

Mosques, markets, habitats of Muslim robbers and the prison
houses had been free fields for the conversion of the Hindus.
Whenever news came to Savarkar about the conversion of
a Hindu lad or a prisoner, he was restless and he turned his
mind devotedly to the serious threat, outwardly a religious
but inwardly a crucial problem o! national importance and
existence.

Almost all Indian jails having Hindu prisoners by majority,
the authorities naturally would appoint non-Hindus to watch
and control the prisoners. Hence Muslims easily rose to the
posts of petty officers and havaldars and warders. And those
Pathans, to quote the verdict of the Cardew Conomission, 
‘ enjoyed a bad pre-eminence as the active agents in the matter
of unnatural vices.’ They turned these opportunities to bad
account and harassed and forced Hindu convicts to embrace
Islam. The revolutioneuries in the Cellular Jail were almost
exhausted due to their great efforts in agitation and action in
India and sufferings in the Andamans. In those hard, helpless,
and hopeless days none of them desired to aggravate their
hard lot by opposing the religious fanaticism of the wicked
and vile Pathan petty officers. Obviously from fear some of
them tried unworthily to cloak their cowardice with a display
of great tolerance and broad-mindedness. It mattered little to
those progressive men whether that vile and fallen lot of
wretched Hindus remained in or went out of their fold and
field ! ‘ Let it be so,’ summed up their social, individual and
mental psychology. What was worse, some even miserably
passed days, giving the Muslim warders high hopes of their
self-conversion.

Suffering for a nation’s welfare is a public and personal
duty. Savarkar was doing it in jail. Why this additional
burden ? But then a report of a conversion of a Hindu or
an injustice done to a prisoner would inflame him. Like a
lion helpless in a cage, he restlessly fluttered over the insult
and injustice done to the racial, national, or religious soul.
So with curses on his head, cares in his heart, burden on Ids
back and troubles under his feet, he resolved to put a stop
to the conversion activities of the Muslims.

With that aim in view he began to shake off the passivity in
the Hindus, activise their efforts, change their tone and
tendencies, mould them into an organism alive to every injury,
and make them masters of their fate and land. To the broad-
minded and wiseacres he asked as to why the non-Hindus
tried to win over to their fold that base, wicked, corrupt lot of
dangerous drunkards and murderers. They said the Muslims
were fanatic and with them reason did not weigh. Well, why
did these cool and cultured Europeans use the hoe of gold
for removing that mud in Indian villages, woods and valleys ?
Indeed, to fertilize their lands of influence with the manure !
Savarkar asked his colleagues why those Westerners polluted
their holy religion by that vile and worthless lot of humanity ?
Why should the Missionaries and Maulavies render service
or offer food and shelter as a price for religion and never
from a humanitarian angle ? If the ulterior motive of these
Missionaries and Maulanas was that their religion and
interests should dominate the world, then let the Hindus have
the freedom to serve Humanity in their own way. Let the
Hindus aim at increasing their numerical strength to fight
their struggle for existence and material well-being. Thus
went forth his chain of arguments.

Savarkar impressed upon the minds of his colleagues that
it was not a fact that a vicious man necessarily gave birth to
vicious men. New Australia and Canada had sprung up from
such vile and base elements thrown away from their mother
countries. He reminded them that the Ramayana, one of the
best epics of the world, was given to the world by Valmiki,
a man fallen in early life. Losing one man was losing
numerous future families and increasing the numerical
strength of the rival faiths in India !

Allured by comforts, enticed by passion, baited by vices and
dreaded by tortures, a few Hindu prisoners in the Andamans
were driven into the fold of Islam. The jail administration
did not take these conversions seriously. One day it became
known to Savarkar that a Hindu boy was on the verge of
conversion. When the superintendent came on his rounds,
Savarkar cried out, “ Application, Sir ! ” The Superintendent
asked him to see and speak for himself. Savarkar tauntingly
asked him whether the Superintendent had ordered the other
prisoners also, who caught their letters or trapped the
revolutionaries, to mind their own business. Savarkar said
angrily that he would n ike a complaint ; let him hear or not.
The Superintendent toned down. He then informed the
Superintendent about the likely conversion. The Superin-
tendent asked him as to why the Hindus did not convert
Muslims instead of making complaints against them.
Savarkar stated that Hinduism was a non-proselytizing
religion. He told the officer that Hinduism was based on the
noblest possible principles. To Hindus, he said, religion was
not like the colour of the chameleon. He concluded : “ It is
their received and noble belief that all the religions of the
world are at the bottom one and have the same aim, namely
the welfare of humanity. The Hindus never look upon
religion as a > of wordly strength and social solidarity.
That is in my opimon thair fundamental blunder from the
point of view of national strength and solidarity.” The
Superintendent understood Savarkar ’s stand well. He asked
Savarkar what he expected the authorities to do. Savarkar
stated that no prisoner should be converted to any other
religion by fraud, force, deception, or enticement without the
knowledge and consent of the jail authorities, who on their
part should certify the bona fides of every case. He added
that all minors should be brought up in their parents’ faith
until they were able to judge the things for themselves. The
Superintendent agreed. And while departing he rated the
Pathan warder who was about to execute the conversion in
question.

The boy in question was saved, but the Hindu prisoners
would not allow him to sit in their file for meals. He sat
beside Savarkar. So they called Savarkar Bhangi Babu.
In the end Savarkar persuaded some of them to discard that
suicidal attitude and by and by the Shuddhi spirit came to
stay. It was a great news all over the Andamans that
Savarkar had stopped the conversion of a Hindu. Upon
this some convicts, who had come across the creeds and
propaganda of the Arya Samaj in India, were organized and
with the help of some fearless and bullying prisoners, some
prisoners were reconverted to Hinduism, their mother fold.
Those Sanatanists who had called Savarkar Bhangi Babu now
began to look at the problem from a new angle of vision, knew
the value of solidarity and strength and the farsighted aim of
Savarkar and supported him. Even a Christian of long
standing was reconverted to Hinduism; later on several
Muslim attempts were foiled by an eleventh-hour intervention
or early precautions. The Muslims complained against
Savarkar that he converted even born Muslims to Hinduism.
Hindus realised now that Muslims could be converted to
Hinduism. Muslim converts and warders reviled Savarkar
incessantly, but were silenced by the turbulent Hindu
convicts drilled in the art of railing. A new idea caught the
imagination of the Hindus. They now learnt that no man
lost his faith because he took food, drink and shelter outside
his faith. The new-comers began to bear Hindu names, read
Hindu scriptures and take meals with their co-religionists.
Hindu temples in the colony were opened to them by and by.
Formerly at the v'harf of Port Blair the Hindu prisoner-
workers sometimes had to starve as they refused to take food
from the bags mischievously touched by Muslims. Savarkar
showed them their humiliating plight and suicidal foolishness
and encouraged them to touch the bags of food first
themselves. They did so and the Muslims, knowing the
reaction and the double edge of the weapon, stopped the
mischievous nonsense !

Despite the danger of personal violence, Barrie's intrigues
and incitement against him and the threats of murder from
Barrie’s lackeys, Savarkar could succeed in infusing an
organic feeling among the Hindu prisoners and even catching
the imagination of Hindus in the Colony. Once a Muslim
ruffian incited by Barrie struck a blow on Babarao Savarkar’s
head. Babarao bled profusely. Barrie rejoiced at the
accident. Savarkar remarked : “ Where dreaded gallows
failed to subdue the spirit of the Savarkars, can these goats
ever succeed ? ”

Just then the census hour struck and Savarkar persuaded
the Arya Samajists and the Sikhs to record their caste and
religion as Hindu or at least Hindu, with the words Arya or
Sikh in the bracket. Ever since his London days Savarkar
was thinking over a national definition of a ‘ Hindu ’ that
would embrace all the folds of Hindus — the Sanatanists, the
Sikhs, the Brahmos, the Arya Samajists and others. At last
he, in a divine moment, composed his famous definition in a
melodious couplet. According to it ‘ A Hindu means a person
who regards this land of Bharat- Varsha from the Indus to the
Seas as his Fatherland as well as his Holyland, that is the
cradle land of his religion.’ That definition he developed and
brought out in a thesis after his transfer from the Andamans
to the Ratnagiri Jail. The chaos and confusion created by
nearly fifty current definitions of the word Hindu including
the one made by Tilak, which was frankly religious, were
brought politically, socially, religiously in order, method,
historic perspective and scientific thought. This definition of
the word Hindu by Savarkar is held by many as the greatest
contribjition to Hindu thought, history and polity.

Savarkar holds that Shuddhi — reconversion — solidifies and
strengthens the Hindu Society. He asks the Hindus to shed
inferiority complex and the idea of contamination by non-
Hindus in respect of food, water, shelter and touch so that
there should be less cause for friction and fight between
Hindus and Muslims ; because the Muslims being deprived
of their throne and sword, the only means that remained for
them was rationalism. He is of the opinion that every one
should be allowed to propagate the cause and mission of his
religion by a rational and peaceful way. He never hated
the Muslims because they belonged to a different religion.
He abhorred the aggressive, unjust and wild designs of the
Moslems and Missionaries. Excepting those points, Savarkar
fought for all prisoners alike and the facilities wrested were
enjoyed by Muslims too.

When a few years after Savarkar was appointed foreman
in charge of the oil-mill work, he never harassed the Muslim
prisoners because they were Muslims. He treated them
justly and kindly, but warned them not to harass the Hindus,
or not to soil the water in the tank by cleansing their feet
in it, or not to do purposely less work and bring him into
trouble. Muslims began to say ‘ Ram Ram ’ and a tiny
Hindu Raj came into being in the Andamans. No mischief,
no trouble, no punishment. Merchants, traders, or wealthy
men under the guise of merchants went to have a glimpse of
the Foreman of the tiny Hindu Kingdom whose capital was
the oil-depot. Untouchability had disappeared from the
kingdom. Pan-Hindu consciousness was pulsating through
Hindu veins. Savarkar had been hammering into the heads
of his colleagues and convicts that among the social institu-
tions, the greatest curse of India was the caste-system. “ The
mighty current of Hindu life,” he said, “ is being threatened
to perish in bogs and sands.” He added : “ It is no good
saying, ‘ We will reduce it to four caste system first'. That
would not and should not be. It must be swept away root
and branch.” ^ Many a time he would touchingly remark that
the curse of caste-system had deprived India of several great
brains. He also strongly disapproved the Andhrasabha
movement and similar disintegrating moves. He disliked
that every province should desire separation and shod and
invoke long life to itself. How could the province live unless
the nation lived, he asked. “ They all — Maharashtra, Bengal,
Madras — are great and will live long but through her-India !
So let us not say ' Andramataki ’ but ‘ Bharatmataki Jai ’ of
whom Andhra is a limb and let us sing not ‘ Vanga Abhar',
but Hind Abhar ^ he warned.

Years glided by. A sense of oneness and noble patriotism
began to throb through the veins of the Andamans. At such
a time the death of the great Tilak in 1920 shocked India and
its repercussions reached the Cellular Jail. All prisoners
observed a day of fast in memory of the Father of Indian
imrest The fast was swiftly and silently organised to the
surprise of the jail authorities. Tilak’s dramatic disappearance
caused the sudden appearance of Gandhiji, a man of boundless
capacity and fabulous energy, on the political stage ! Writing
on the subversive movements in India, Mr. J. C. Ker, who
was a member of the Indian Civil Service from 1901 to 1929,
observed : “ The death of Tilak in August 1920 removed liis
(Gandhiji’s) strongest rival for the Hindu Leadership, and
early in 1921 the campaign of Mr. Gandhi and the Ali Brothers
was in full swing.”

World War I broke out in August 1914 as forecast by
Savarkar in his London days. But alas ! He was not free
to Utilize the golden opportunity to free his nation. Yet he
felt the situation advantageous to India in many respects.
“It sent a thrill of delight,” he wrote, in March 1915, from
the Celltilar Jail, “ in my heart to hear that the Indian troops
were allowed to go to Europe, in their thousands to fight
against the best military power in the world and that they
had acquainted themselves with such splendour and were
covered with military glory. Thank God ! Manliness after
all i. not dead yet in the land.” ^ Considering that the needs
and difficulties of the British Government were the seeds of
and opportunity for Indian progress, Tilak strategically
supported the militarisation policy of the Indian Government.
But, strangely enough, Gandhiji, the apostle of peace and
non-violence, surprised the country when he girded up his
loins, trod and toured the country and panted for recruiting
unconditionally soldiers for the British Power to give blood-
bath to the Germans. Tilak’s step was responsive and
statesmanly. Gandhiji ’s step was emotional and devotional
and need not surprise the rationalists. The Indian
revolutionaries in Europe and America now decided to throw
their whole weight into the direction of a revolt. They
prepared themselves for an all-out struggle for overthrowing
the British rule in India. To that end the revolutionary
leaders like Lala Hardayal, Virendranath Chattopadhyaya
of the Abhinava Bharat, and Raja Mahendra Pratap were
busy discussing plans and spinning negotiations with
Germany. With full support of the German War Cabinet
they set up an Indian Independence League in Germany
under the Chairmanship of Sri Champaka Raman Pillai.
Accordingly, world-wide plans were devised to smuggle lakhs
of rifles and ammunition through the Muslim countries and
Tibet for the revolutionaries of the Ghadr party in the Punjab,
to land the revolutionaries of the Ghadr party in Bengal and
attack the Eastern Frontiers of India. One of the major plans
was to raid Port Blair and pick up their leader Savarkar and
other revolutionaries from the Andamans. The Sedition
Committee Report tells us that a third steamer was to sail to
the Andamans, shipping a cargo of arms at sea and raid Port
Blair, pick up anarchists and convicts.’^ Mr. J. C. Ker,
referring to the plans of the German Government, states :

* Savarkar, An Echo from Andamans, p. 33.

> During the war efforts were made by the Germans to use
the Indian revolutionaries for their own purposes. Elaborate
and world- wide plans were devised to land arms in Bengal
for the use of the revolutionaries there, and emissaries
proceeded between the leaders in India and German
representatives in Batavia and elsewhere to complete the
arrcijngcmenis/' The revolutionary leaders recruited and
inspired Indians abroad to fight for the Independence of their
Motherland under the banner of Ghadr party initiated by the
leaders of the Abhinava Bharat and inspired by Savarkar^s
slogans, Savarkar's book War of Independence of 1857, his
pamphlets and his personality. Pictures showing Savarkar at
the oil-mill were flashed in Ghadr papers in San Francisco
and other American papers. Thus the oil Savarkar pressed
out at the oil-mill in the Andamans did not fall into the
bucket down below, but outside it and inflamed the fire and
wrath of the Ghadr revolutionaries. And so the remark made
by Sir J. C. Ker that with his (Savarkar’s) removal, the
society in London ceased to be of any great consequence, and
on the outbreak of the Great War it was broken up,” ^ is not
vrholly true ; for the heads of the Ghadr were the lieutenants
of Savarkar. Simply for the sake of safety and strategy the
headquarters were shifted to the United States of America.
> 
> As pre-planned by the revolutionaries with the German
Government, the German war machine began to operate. The
German submarine, Emden, moved in the Bay of Bengal
raiding British cargo-ships, bombarding some of the places on
the Eastern coast of India, striking terror into the hearts of
the authorities of the Andamans and causing sleepless nights
to the Indian Government. There was a rumour in the
Andamans that the Emden was to pick up Savarkar and send
him in a German aeroplane to the headquarters of the Ghadr.
Savarkar had also discussed this possibility with his colleagues
in the Cellular Jail and was fully aw^are of it. But at this
juncture he was removed to the tower of the central building
of the jail, and was strictly watched. In the meanwhile, in
November 1914, the famous Emden was destroyed and the
escape of Savarkar could not be effected. The French
Government insincerely handed Savarkar to the British
Government and the German Government struggled for his
rescue !

In their other plans the revolutionaries succeeded
considerably. About 8,000 Sikh revolutionaries arrived in
India from America, Canada and the Far East in 1915, and the
situation in the Punjab became tense and threatening. “ The
internal situation began to grow menacing,” writes Lord
Hardinge in his memoirs, “ owing to the revolutionaries
realising the military weakness consequent on depletion of
the Indian troops.” Alarmed by the growing menace,
pressure and incursion of the revolutionaries. Lord Handinge,
the Governor-General of India, got the Defence of Realms Act
passed by the Legislative Assembly. Describing this critical
situation, klr. J. C. Ker says : 

> “ Early in the war a serious
situation developed in the Punjab, arising out of the return
from America of Sikhs who had been demoralized by the
teaching of the Ghadr party. During the first three years of
the War some 8,000 Sikhs came back from the United States,
Canada, and the Far East. . . . Several risings were attempted,
and efforts were made in two or three instances to seduce the
Indian regiments. A large number of dacoities and murders
were committed in many of the Punjab districts, and efforts
were made to raise a rebellion.” ^

The War of Independence of 1857 had been suppressed
with the help of the Sikhs. To wash out the odium from
the history of 1857 tliis Second War of Independence was
started by an overwhelming number of Sikh revolutionaries.
They buzzed to imdermine the loyalty of the Indian troops
in India and Siam and induce them to take up the cause of
freedom. There was trouble with the 10th Baluchis of which
the Mashud company shot their officer in Bombay on their
way to Mesopotamia. Revolutionary strongholds were
discovered at Delhi, Lahore and Meerut. The brilliant Vishnu
Ganesh Pingle from Maharashtra was arrested with ten
loaded bombs inside the line of the 12th Cavalry at Meerut
and was hanged. Conspiracies aimed at robbing the armoury
and magazine of certain regiments were discovered at Lahore,
Pindi and Ferozepore. In Bengal, too, the revolutionaries
were striving their level best to achieve their goal. Writing
about this Mr. J, C. Ker observes : “ Money (from Germany)
was sent to the conspirators in Calcutta, and the nucleus of
a training camp was set up in a remote spot in the jungle.
This hiding place was discovered, and in a fight between the
police and a party of the Bengalis armed with Mauser pistols,
the leader was killed, and the plot collapsed. Another plan
organised with the help of the Ghadr party was to enter
Burma through Siam, and after gaining over the military
police to proceed to the conquest of India.” ^ Armed with
extensive powers and with the help of the 6,000 troops from
Nepal, the British Government ruthlessly suppressed this
heroic rising. There was a holocaust of victims at the altar
of freedom. Some five thousand men were put on trial for
treason in the Punjab alone. Five hundred revolutionaries
were tried by court-martial and executed, eight hundred were
sentenced to transportation for life, ten thousand were
interned without trial, and a large niunber had to remain
underground for years.

Setting aside its previous decision of not transporting the
prisoners to the Andamans, the British Government
transported about 500 revolutionaries, who had thus taken
part, fought and failed in the Second War of Independence, to
the Andamans. Prominent among them was Bhai Parmananda,
who had already come into contact with Savarkar during
the latter’s London days. On their arrival in the Cellular
Jail the revolutionary leaders narrated to Savarkar how his
writings and the great book on ‘ 1857 ’ and his sacrifice bg d
a magic effect in changing them overnight into patriots and
warriors ! The new batch of the prisoners was made of
farmers, workers and businessmen. It was difficult for the
jail authorities to bend them to their will. There were point
blank refusals. Nobody would do hard work. For a time
the jailer and the Superintendent seemed to lower their voice
and the standard of work, and requested them to work as
best as they could. There were scuffles and broils over bad
words. Words of abuse were returned with blows, and
consequently many noble and spirited patriots from this group
perished in their helpless fight with the cruel jail authorities
in their prime of youth.

During the war period Savarkar made vigorous attempts
to effect his release. He made petitions and appeals to the
Government of India that he should be released with or
without conditions or at least be enlisted in the volvmteer
corps. The authorities knew his intention and were not at
all willing to do so. To them a bird in the hand was worth
two in the bush ! Savarkar asked his younger brother
Dr. Savarkar, in his annual letter why the Indian National
Congress had not uttered a word of sympathy and fought shy
of speaking about the release of political prisoners when
responsible leaders like General Botha released all Boer
rebels or John Edward Redmond struggled and succeeded in
getting all the Irish prisoners released. He wrote to his
brother to agitate in the matter and send a public petition so
that, if at all the release came at any time, it would be
acceptable as a token of the countrymen’s love and
remembrance for those who never ceased to love their land
of birth and rightly or wrongly fell fighting for her. Thereupon
provincial conferences passed resolutions demanding the
release of ‘ political prisoners.’ But it was seen that there was
some vagueness about the phrase ‘ political prisoner,’ prevail-
ing in the Press and the statements of politicians and resolu-
tions of the conferences. Savarkar, therefore, asked his
brother to note that the term political could be distinguished
from ‘ private ’ only by the criterion of the motive of the act
and not by the act itself. He said : “ No act is or can be by
itself political. For even a rebellion, if that proceeds entirely
for my own bread and butter, is not political and ought not
to create any sympathy in others.” So he informed his
brother that the point should definitely be pressed that
“ political prisoners means all those undergoing imprisonment
whether convicted or not, whether for individual acts or acts
in general, for actions which proceeded from purely and
admittedly poHtical motives.” ^

1 Savarkar, An Echo from Andamans, p. 66.


In his petitions to the Viceroy and Mr. E. S. Montagu,
Secretary of State for India, Savarkar submitted to them that
while they were considering the question of Reforms in
India they should release all political prisoners. Grant of
reforms and grant of amnesty for all prisoners and exiles in
foreign lands should go hand in hand. He said : “ How can
there be peace and contentment and trust in a land where a
brother is torn av/ay from a brother, where thousands upon
thousands are rotting in cage cells and stand exiled and in
jails, and where every other family has a brother or a son,
a father or a friend, or a lover snatched away from its bosom
and kept pining away his life in the parched and thirsty
Saharas of Separation ! ” And if progress is made easy, he
asks : “ Where is the man who would run the ordeals of iire
or would tread the paths of furies with bleeding feet for sheer
amusement ! ” He continued : “ That is rare and rarer it is
to find a true patriot and humanitarian who would indulge
in reckless and bloody and necessarily outrageous revolutions
— if but and even when, a safer, nobler, more certainly moral
because entirely effective and employing least resistance —
if but such a Path, the Path of constitutional progress be open
and accessible to him ? ” He added : “ It is a mockery to talk
of constitutional agitation when there is no constitution at
all, but it is worse than a mockery, a crime, to talk of revolu-
tions as if it were a work of rose water even when there is as
elastic and progressive a constitution as, say, there is in
England or in America.” ^

Needless to say, this petition was indirectly and obviously
a pressure on the Government and a support on behalf of
the revolutionary party to the national forces that were
demanding responsible Governn-jent in India. Indian Govern-
ment wanted to know the views of the revolutionary party
on the proposed Reforms and so its accredited leader,
Savarkar, was asked by the authorities to offer his views on
the drafts of the Montagu-Chelniisford Reforms. Even in the
published Draft of Mr. E. S. Montagu’s scheme was expressed
the hope that the revolutionists would now find something to
be done constitutionally for the realization of their hopes and
aspirations and would change their minds and return to
useful paths of activity.^ The blood of martyrs never drops
in vain. They die so that humanity may prosper !

Savarkar gives in his letter dated July 6, 1920, a brief
summary of his new petition to the Indian Government and
depicts his ideal of Human Government or World Common-
wealth Viewed from the angle of truth, sympathy, justice,
impartiality and looking to the times, this letter will reveal
why Guy A. /Jdred of Britain claims for Savarkar a place
in the line of prophets and humanists of the world. Those
who boast of their broad-niindedness and large sympathies
and dream of world I'^ederation should pause for a while to
read the following passage from Savarkar and compare it
with their present ideal, for Savarkar declared his ideal
when they were, speaking politically, in their swaddling
clothes. Savarkar observes in 1920 :

> ** We believe in a universal state embracing all mankind
and wherein all men and women would be citizens working
for and enjoying equally the fruits of this earth and this sun,
this land and this light, which constitute the real Motherland
and Fatherland of Man. All other divisions and distinctions
are artificial though indispensable. Believing thus thiit the
ideal of all political Science and Art is or ought to be a Human
State in which all nations merge their political selves for their
own fulfilment even as the cells in an organism, organisms in
families and tribes, and tribes in nation states have done, and
believing therefore the humanity is higher patriotism and
therefore any Empire or Commonwealth that succeeds in
welding numbers of conflicting races and nations in one
harmonious, if not homogeneous whole in such wise as to
render each of them better fitted to realize, enrich and enjoy
life in all its noble aspects in a distinct step to the realization
of that ideal. I can consciously co-operate with any attempt
to found a Commonwealth which would be neither British
nor Indian but which may, till a better name be devised, be
styled as an Aryan Commonwealth.” He concludes : With
this end in view I ever worked in the past. With this end in
view I am willing to work now. And therefore I rejoiced to hear
that the Government have changed their angle of vision and
meant to make it possible for India to advance constitutionally
on the path to Freedom and strength and fulness of life. 1
am sure that many a revolutionist would like me cry halt
under such circumstances and try to meet England under an
honourable truce, even in a half-way house as the reformed
Council Halls promised to be, and work there before a further
march on to progress be sounded.” ^
