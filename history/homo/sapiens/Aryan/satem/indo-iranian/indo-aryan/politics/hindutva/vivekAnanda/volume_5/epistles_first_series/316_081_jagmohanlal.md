MURREE,  
*11th October, 1897*.

MY DEAR JAGAMOHANLAL,

. . . Leave words when you start for Bombay to somebody to take care of
three Sannyasins I am sending to Jaipur. Give them food and good
lodging. They will be there till I come. They are fellows — innocent,
not learned. They belong to me, and one is my Gurubhāi
(brother-disciple). If they like, take them to Khetri where I will come
soon. I am travelling now quietly. I will not even lecture much this
year. I have no more faith in all this noise and humbug which brings no
practical good. I must make a silent attempt to start my institution in
Calcutta; for that I am going to visit different centres quietly to
collect funds.

Yours with blessings,

VIVEKANANDA.
