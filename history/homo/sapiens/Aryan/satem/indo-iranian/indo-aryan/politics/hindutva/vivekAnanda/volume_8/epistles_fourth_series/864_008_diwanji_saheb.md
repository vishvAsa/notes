BOMBAY,  
*1892*

DEAR DIWANJI SAHEB, (Shri Haridas Viharidas Desai)

The bearer of this letter, Babu Akshaya Kumar Ghose, is a particular
friend of mine. He comes of a respectable family of Calcutta. I found
him at Khandwa where I made his acquaintance, although I knew his family
long before in Calcutta.

He is a very honest and intelligent boy and is an undergraduate of the
Calcutta University. You know how hard the struggle is in Bengal
nowadays, and the poor boy has been out in search of some job. Knowing
your native kindness of heart, I think I am not disturbing you by asking
and entreating you to do something for this young man. I need not write
more. You will find him an honest and hard-working lad. If a single act
of kindness done to a fellow creature renders his whole life happy, I
need not remind you that this boy is a PƒÅtra (a person quite deserving
of help), noble and kind as you are.

I hope you are not disturbed and troubled by this request of mine. This
is the first and the last of its kind and made only under very peculiar
circumstances. Hoping and relying on your kind nature, I remain,

Yours faithfully,  
VIVEKANANDA.
