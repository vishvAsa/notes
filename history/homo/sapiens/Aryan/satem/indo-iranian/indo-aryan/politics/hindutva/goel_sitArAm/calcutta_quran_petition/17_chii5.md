**I, TIMIR HARAN SEN GUPTA**, Deputy Secretary, Home Department,
Government of West Bengal, residing at Saptarany Flat 9, 1113 Old
Ballygunge, 2nd Lane, Calcutta - 19, solemnly affirm and say as follows:

1\. I am competent enough and have been duly authorised to affirm the
affidavit.

1a.  I state that according to the Islamic belief the Holy Quran is a
Divine Book.  It contains the words of God Almighty revealed at His last
Prophet Muhammad.  The verses of the Holy Quran were revealed on the
happenings of particular events and its each and every verse has a
connotation of its own and on different and separate background.

2\. I further state that as the Holy Quran is a Divine Book, no earthly
power can sit upon judgment on it and no Court of law has jurisdiction
to adjudicate it.  The Holy Books like the Quran, the Bible, the Geeta,
the Granth Sahib, etc., or their translations cannot be the
subject-matters of adjudication in a court of law.  All Holy Scriptures
are immune from judicial scrutiny.

3\. I submit that this Hon’ble Court has no jurisdiction to pronounce a
judgment on the Quran, the Holy Scripture of the Muslims all over the
world, each and every word of which, according to the Islamic belief, is
unalterable.

4\. There is, as far as known to me, no country in the world where there
are no Muslims practising their religion, not to mention the countries
where the whole population believe in Islam and the Holy Quran.  From
the time of British Rule and since Independence, inspite of the Indian
Penal Code being in existence, there has never been such an application
in any court in India.

In view of the aforesaid submission I am not dealing with any of the
allegations in the said petition.

5\. The instant Writ application has been filed with malafide and
ulterior motives and should be dismissed with costs.

6\. That the statements contained in paragraphs 1, 1a, 2, 3, 4 and 5
hereof are submissions to this Hon’ble Court.
