The Akhand Hindusllian movement was gradually gaining
ground. Savarkar’s voi. was capturing the imagination of
the people. Congress iri'u- nce with the ma.sses was at a
low ebb. Even in Englan-i and in America the people and
the Press evinced interest and eagerness to learn more
about the Hindu Mahasabha and its movement, its organiza-
tion and its leaders. The Hindu Mahasabha was defeating
Congress candidates in Municipal, Local and District Local
Board elections and bye-elections to the Legislatures. In 1941
the Congress suffered a significant defeat in Maharashtra when
Sri Jamnadas Mehta, supported by the Hindu Mahasabha,
defeated the Congress candidate in the election to the Central
Assembly. In Bengal where the opposition to the Mahasabha
came from the Forward Block, the Congress being then a
dwindling force there, Sri Ashutosh Lahiri, the General
Secretary of the Hindu Mahasabha, defeated the Forward
Block candidate in the election to the Provincial Assembly.
Sri K. C. Neogy, supported by the Hindu Mahasabha, defeated
the Forward Block candidate, Sri Mujumdar, in Bengal in
the bye-election to the Central Assembly when a seat fell
vacant due to the disappearance of Subhas Bose in January
1942.

At Khamgaon, Patna, Monghyr, Katihar (Bihar) , Suri
(Bengal) , Poona, Mahad, Bhagalpur and Sholapur, there were
glowing and growing successes for the Hindu Mahasabha in
the elections ; so much so that at some of these places there
was complete debacle for the Congress candidates and
Congressmen withdrew their candidature or fought elections
in a personal capacity in order to save the prestige of the
Congress in case of their defeats. In Assam the Congress
could not even put up a candidate for a bye-election to the
Central Assembly and the Hindu Mahasabha candidate,



284 SAVABKAR AND HIS TIMES

Sri Anang Mohan Dam, was returned unopposed to the
Central Assembly.

The Hindu Mahasabha observed the 10th of May 1942. as
an anti-Pakistan and independence day with intense
enthusiasm at the behest of President Savarkar. Hundreds
of meetings were held all over Hindusthan, in almost all
capital cities, Taluka and District towns, protesting against
the principle of provincial self-determination and Pakistan.
But strangely enough, while the Muslim Leaguers were
allowed along with Rajaji to propagate the cause of Paki.stan
all over India even through public meetings, the Hindu-
sabhaites denouncing the vivisection of India were arrested
and gaoled at many places including Nellore, Patna and Arrah
(Bihar) for holding anti-Pakistan meetings on that day.

History would record that Savarkar was the only great
leader who raised his mighty voice against the internal
disintegrating, disrupting forces as well as the external ones
threatening India. Not to speak of the Congress leaders, but
even Gandhiji assumed a dubious role blowing hot and cold in
the same breath. The virtual dictator of the Congress
flattered himself v/ith the belief that many pious Muslims had
remarked that he was a better Muslim than most Muslims.^
The symbol of truth and the apostle of Indian democracy
advised his countrymen : “ Let them (the Hindus) say to the
Mussalmans ‘ have as big a share of the spoils as you want :
we will be content to serve you - The man of justice,
equality and universal love further said : “ For as a Hindu, I
should know that I have nothing to lose even if the referee
gave the Muslims a majority of seats in every province.”®
On the one hand the messenger of God stated : “ Personally I
do not want anything which the Muslims oppose,” and on the
other hand the god-fearing man in him declared : “ I consider
the vivisection of India to be a sin.” * In one voice he said :

“ Muslim rule is equivalent to Indian Rule. I would any day
prefer Muslim Rule to British Rule ;” and in another he said :

“ For it (proposed Pakistan) means the undoing of centuries
of work done by numberless Hindus and Muslims to live

together as one nation.” ^ He once believed : “ Partition
means a patent imtruth,” ^ and even did not falter to say :
“ Vivisect me before you vivisect India.” ®

Lastly, Gandhiji openly declared : “ Needless to say, the
Congress can never seek the assistance of the British forces to
resist the vivisection. It is the Muslims who will impose
their will by force, singly or with British assistance, on an
unresisting India. If I can carry the Congress with me, I
would not put the Muslira- to the trouble of using force. I
would be ruled by them, f< it would still be Indian Rule.”

Thus when Gandhiji was so uncertain about the unity and
integrity of India, his generals like the guileless, sincere and
enhghtened Dr. Rajendra Prasad naturally searched for the
economic safety and stability and political definition of
Pakistan instead of opposing the very idea of Pakistan !
Dr. Rajendra Prasad honestly and bookishly believed that
the riddle would be solved in a Round Table Conference by
the policy of give and take. For all his life, his party had
given up just claims and ground and taken nothing in return.
So why should his party not have such a compromise even
on this issue, he seemed to think !

Pandit Nehru declared earnestly that none would come in
the way of self-determination of the Muslims after
Independence. In his article specially written for the New
York Times Magazine dated the 19th of July 1942, Pandit
Nehru said ; “ There is now a demand on the part of some
Muslims for partition of India, and it must be remembered
that this demand is hardly four years old. Few take it
seriously.” ® If this is not an example of lack of realism, of
a deceptive self-complacency and of an inherent incapacity to
probe the depth of political problems, what else is it ?
Gandhiji influenced many men, but all his influence thus
sided with the Pakistanis in effect. It was such a formidable
opposition from the adversaries of the unity of India against
which Savarkar with his conviction and courage had to stand
up for the cause of Akhand Hindusthan. A man of supreme

286 SAVABKAR AND HIS TIMES

courage, superb insight and spotless sincerity alone always
irrevocably stands by a great ideal and Savarkar did it.

In the middle of May 1942, John Paton Davis, Second
Secretary of the Embassy of the U.S.A., also attached to
the General Commanding Army Forces, interviewed Savarkar.
He expressed his opinion to the President of the Hindu
Mahasabha that the American Press and the people were
realizing the rising influence of the Hindu Mahasabha ! In
the first week of June 1942, an American Negro leader saw
Savarkar, gave him an idea of the Ethiopean movement in
America, and narrated to Savarkar the disabilities the
Negroes were undergoing in the U.S.A. In the second week
of the month came the well-known journalist-author Louis
Fischer, to interview Savarkar. He talked to Savarkar as
if he had accepted a brief on behalf of the Muslim League
whose Fuehrer he had met the previous day. Without any
thought he asked Savarkar : “ Mr. Savai'kar, why don’t you
concede Pakistan ? ” Although the tone of the interviewer
was impulsive and the manner quite irritating, Savarkar
quietly asked Mr. Louis Fischer : “ Why don’t you grant
Negrostan in the U.S.A. ? ” The American journalist rashly
gave him an answer which Savarkar expected him to give, for
Mr. Fischer said, “ That will be anti-national ! ” “ Exactly,

Mr. Fischer, granting Pakistan will be anti-national and un-
democratic in India as would be the granting of Negrostan in
the U.S.A. ! ” answered back Savarkar.

Mr. Louis Fischer did not like the defeat in points of
arguments and persisted more vigorously than before : “ But
you must not forget Panipat, if you refuse Pakistan to the
Muslims ! ” Instantly Savarkar reminded Mr. Fischer of the
debacle in Dunkirk and Crete. The interview lost its charm
and Mr. Fischer had to listen to perturbed and fiery Savarkar
armed with irrefutable arguments for his stand. Mr. Fischer
was like a fish out of water and never in any future articles
did he mention the name of Savarkar. Savarkar’s truth was
unpalatable to his mind freshly acquainted with the soft pro-
Muslim attitude of the Congress leaders. The American
journalist did not know that he was crossing swords with the
greatest intellectual giant of Maharashtra. Where intellectual
giants like Sir Stafford Cripps and Sir Tej Bahadur Sapru



MAHASABHA MARCHES ON 287

were swept away, how could a journalist like Mr. Louis
Fischer hold his ground ?

In the same month, Mr. L. Brander, a representative of the
British Broadcasting Corporation, London, had an interview
with Savarkar, and gained a first-hand knowledge cind informa-
tion about the policy and principles of the Hindu Mahasabha.

In the month of May 1942, a Chinese Muslim Mission toured
India, visiting the chief Muslim majority cities. States and
Muslim strongholds, and interviewed the highlights of the
Pakistani Movement including the Nizam. The Chinese
Muslim Mission sent a message to the Nellore Muslims and
openly promised help to the Indian Muslims after the end of
the war. Savarkar reluctantly exposed the hidden motives
of the Chinese Muslim leaders who were wooing the Indian
Muslims and imbibing the virus of Pakistani Movement. He
also reminded the people of the recent visits of the Chinese
Muslims to Turkastan and Egypt to initiate themselves into
the Pan-Islamic mysteries and how they, on reaching India
had seen Jinnah and the Leaguers, and how they had aban-
doned their Chinese national dress and paraded the Fez.
Savarkar was of the opinion that if the motives of the Chinese
Muslims were not checked in time, they would develop in
China in the near future separatist tendencies, and would act
as a pair of scissors on China.

At this juncture in Sind the Hur menace developed into
a national calamity on the Hindu life, honour and property.
Savarkar therefore strongly urged the Governor of Sind to
stamp out the atrocious activities of the Hurs by any and
every means.

Although routed in the A.I.C.C. meeting at Allahabad,
Rajaji had now opened a Pakistan Front in the Madras
Presidency. Rajaji declared that he had voiced loudly what
the Congress High Conunand only whispered. No less a
responsible politician than Dr. Khan Sahib had also averred
that the Congress High Conunand had decided at Ramgarh
not to oppose any province or provinces forming a separate
independent State or States in India. Savarkar could not
tolerate this. He reaffirmed his belief that Rajaji “ was the
only means of the design of the Congress High Command who
were feeling the pulse of India and injecting the pro-Pakistani



288 SAVARKAR AND HIS TIMES

virus into the body politic of India. They were playing a
double game. If Rajaji failed, it was his own failure. If he
succeeded, the success was theirs.” Savarkar then appealed
to the Madras Province to lose no time in counteracting the
nefarious movement of Rajaji by starting a counter propa-
ganda for the unity and integrity of Hindxisthan as a nation
and a State.

In 1942 Sir Mirza Ismail was appointed Prime Minister of
Jaipur. Savarkar had numerous complaints against his past
deeds as a premier in Mysore. He therefore said that even
if Sir Mirza Ismail was a highly efficient administrator, he
would oppose the appointment of Sir Mirza Ismail as the
latter during the Dewanship of Mysore had silently packed
the police, military and other important services with
Muslims. Savarkar reiterated his belief that to give more
to the Muslims than what was due to the Muslims on the basis
of merits or population was nothing but robbing the Hindus
of their legitimate, economic and political rights.

After the tragic failure of the Cripps Mission, the Viceroy
expanded his Executive Council partly with a desire to meet
the popular demand for Indianization of the Executive Council
by appointing distinguished politicians of administrative
experience and statesmen of proved ability and high calibre
like Sir C. P. Ramaswami Aiyar, Sir J. P. Srivastava — a
member of the Working Committee of the Hindu Mahasabha,
— Sir Jogendra Singh and Dr. Ambedkar.

Savarkar appreciated this move of the Viceroy in spite of
some glaring defects inherent in it and declared that Govern-
ment must offer voluntarily so complete political freedom and
power to India as to render it impossible for any enemy of
Britain to offer anything more alluring to lead India astray !
Savarkar congratulated Dr. Ambedkar, Sir J. P. Srivastava,
Sir C. P. Ramaswami Aiyar and Sir Jogendra Singh. Sir
Jogendra Singh said in his reply to Savarkar that he trusted
that he would continue to enjoy the confidence of the Hindu
community which, he added, was no less dear to him than his
own community. Sir C. P. Ramaswami, too, thanked Savarkar
for his congratulations which he specially appreciated.

On a pressing request from the Hindu Sanghatanist workers
and organizations like the Hindu Sikh Nava Javan Sabha,
Arya Samaj, Mahaveer Dal, Sanatan Dharma Mandal, Savar-
kar visited Kashmir in the middle of July 1942. It was his
first visit to Kashmir. On his way to Shrinagar Savarkar was
accorded grand receptions and addresses of welcome on
various railway stations including Amritsar, Lahore, and
Vazirabad. In the Presidential party were Lala Ganpat Rai
of Delhi, the Sikh leader — Master Tara Singh, and Capt.
Keshavchandra.

At Jammu on July 11, 1942, a very enthusiastic welcome
was given to Savarkar by several institutions and organiza-
tions and nearly forty thousand Hindus and Sikhs participated
in the procession taken out in honour of Savarkar. Next day
Savarkar presided over the Hindu-Sikh Conference and
addressed a mammoth meeting. After going through a
crowded programme for three days in Jammu, he left for
Srinagar and reached the capital of Kashmir on July 14,
During his stay a host of deputationists, delegations and inter-
viewers waited upon him. He addressed tliree public meet-
ings one of which was arranged exclusively for ladies attended
by over twenty thousand ladies. He was presented with an
address of welcome by the ladies of the land of splendour,
sun and beauty. Next day he was taken out in another
procession in spite of his indifferent health to the banks of
the river Vitasta of Vedic and ancient fame. Experiencing
the great waves of emotion and enthusiasm of the people, the
spirit of Savarkar defied his frailty and he galvanized the vast
multitude with his message and mission. To thousands of
Hindus Savarkar has been an incarnation of God. At that
far end of Bhndusthan the Hindus evoked his blessings.
Thousands touched his feet with devotion and kissed his
hands in spite of his fervent disapproval of these things. Such
thrilling scenes of devotion and deification were a common
feature of all of Savarkar’s tours. And so was it in
Kashmir. Savarkar left the capital of the Indian Switzerland
despite public and private pressing requests to prolong his

allaying the Muslim hunger for pouer, Savarkar said,
Fakistan would put them into a wore effective position to
make further demands. He further declared that the Hindu


Mahasabha would never assent to seJJ its birthright, the
integrity of India as a nation and a State for the mess of
pottage of the united Indian demand for Quit India.

The Working Committee of the Congress at its Wardha
sitting by this time passed a resolution and agreed to the
stationing of alhed troops in India to ward off Japanese
aggression. The two opposite stands taken by the Congress
were inconsistent in Savarkar’s opinion, and therefore he said
that the Congress indulged in tomfoolery when it said to the
British Government : “ Quit India but keep your armies
here.” And indeed this meant reinstallation of the British


military rule over India in its much worse form.

On his return to Bombay from the Kashmir tour, Savarkar
issued a statement on July 27, replying to the president of
Jammu and Kashmir Conference, a pro-Pakistani Muslim
body which had presented him with compliments for his clear-
cut and well-defined views as contrasted with other nationalist
leaders. Since his democratic political convictions admitted
of no half measures or mental reservation, the memorandum
appealed to Savarkar to say whether he was prepared to
apply his popular principle of the majority rule to the problem
of Kashmir, and support the claim of the Muslim majority
rule in Kashmir ! The memorandum in fact was submitted
to him when he entered Kashmir and he had boldly and
fearlessly replied to the same in an open meeting. But for
clarification and assertion, he issued this statement on the
problem of Kashmir. Savarkar was not a slogan-ridden



MAHASABHA MARCHES OH


291


leader. He fearlessly, frankly and squarely answered that his
principle laid it down that all citizens who owed undivided
loyalty and allegiance to the Indian Nation and State would
be treated with perfect equality. They would, he declared,
share duties and obligations equally in common, irrespective
of caste, creed or religion ai representation would either be
on the basis <jf one man 1 1 e vote or in proportion to the
population strength in case ■ ' f eparate electorates, and public
services would go by merit

But those who contributed, Savarkar affirmed, to the
Pakistani creed or wished to secede from India had no right to
the democratic principle of representation in proportion to
the population. The Muslims of Kashmir had never publicly
or privately declared their consent to apply the same principle
of the majority rule to the States of Bhopal and Hyderabad.
Further, in Savarkar’s view although the Hindus were in a
minority in Kashmir, they were a part of the national majo-
rity from whom they were not cut off ! Thus the false
democrats in Kashmir were exposed by Savarkar. Of course,
in their slogans for the majority rule in Kashmir, they were
supported in no small measure by Pandit Nehru whose
attitude towards the Kashmir Maharajah and antipathy
towards the Hindus were proverbial !

On the last day of July 1942, Savarkar tendered his resigna-
tion of the Presidentship of the Hindu Mahasabha. Owing
to the continuous strain for the last five years of the Presiden-
tial duties and the whirlwind propaganda, Savarkar badly
needed rest. He now thought it fit to shift the burden and
responsibility to some stronger and broader shoulders and
entrust the leadership of the Hindu Mahasabha to worthy
hands. Reviewing the work and prestige of the Hindu
Mahasabha in his statement declaring his resignation, he said,
“The Hindu has regained once more his national soul and
self-consciousness. Witness for example what Prof. Coupland
admits in his latest work. The Cripps Mission, published by
the Oxford University Press. ‘The Hindu Mahasabha has
come to be a militant organization of the Hindus and has been
growing fast in membership and influence.’ Sir Stafford
Cripps has himself written to me that so influential an organi-
zation as the Hindu Mahasabha cannot be left out on any



292 SAVARKAR AND HIS TIMES

account when constitutional questions arise. But the most
eloquent compliment that can be desired is paid to the Hindu
Mflhasahha by Mr. Jinnah when he said at Madras in his
Presidential Addi-ess, ‘ The Hindu Mahasabha is an absolutely
incorrigible and hopeless body, and I can have nothing to do
with it Savarkar further asked the Hindus in his parting
message to ‘Hinduise all politics and militarize Hindudom.’
He also promised that he would ever continue as a soldier in
its rank and file and serve the Hindu Mahasabha in any
capacity it wanted him to do in furthering the cause of the
Hindus.

His resignation was a stunning news to the Hindu Sangha-
tanist public in India. Hundreds of letters and telegrams
soon poured in Savarkar Sadan urging Savarkar not to leave
them in the lurch. The Bengal Provincial Hindu Sabha in
its message said : “ Amidst the universal confusion and chaos
you have been the one beacon-light to Hindudom and so long
as you would be the President of the All-India Hindu Maha-
sabha, the whole of Hindusthan believed that the calamity
of Pakistan would never befall their Motherland.” Dr. Shyama
Prasad Mookerjee wired to Savarkar that his lead was essen-
tial in the prevailing national crisis. Meherchand Khanna
from the N.-W.F.P. stated that Savarkar’s guidance was
essential to India at that juncture. In a frantic appeal Sir J.
P. Srivastava said that Savarkeir’s resignation had come as a
great shock to the Hindu Sanghatanists all over India, and
would injure the Hindu cause. Rai Bahadur Harischandra
of Delhi wrote to Savarkar : “ It is entirely correct that but
for your energy, determination and constant hard work,
nobody would have cared or even cared to know about the
Hindu Mahasabha in this country and its condition would
have been as it had been more than a decade before you
resumed the control.” The late Raja Maheshwar Dayal from
U.P. said : “ You have always risked and sacrificed all even
at the cost of health. You cannot refuse to guide the nation
at this critical jimcture.” And it was a fact that only Savar-
kar could work the miracle. It is the man of strong will, says
Swami Vivekananda, that throws, as it were, a halo round
him and brings all other people to the same state of vibration
as he has in his own mind. When a powerful individual



MAHASABHA MARCHES ON 293

appears, adds Vivekananda, his personality infuses his thought
into us. This was true to a letter in respect of Savarkar.

Despite the fact that there were great patriots of long
service, great sacrifice and great learning like Devata Swamp
Bhai Parmananda, revolutionary leaders of great sacrifice
like Sri Ashutosh Lahiri, and representative Hindu leaders
of long service and statesmanship like Dr. Moonje in the
Hindu Mahasabha, Savarkar alone could vibrate the entire
India soon after he entei od the Hindu Mahasabha. In a vast
country like India, to be a -cader in the true sense of the term
is a colossal feat of physical and mental capacity. This is given
only to a few. Even the Congress organization during the
span of sixty years of its life of service could hardly produce
magnetic personalities who could be counted on one’s fingers.
They were Surendranath, Gokhale, Gandhiji, Jawaharlal Nehru
and Subhas. Gandhiji was all political organization, and Nehru
all political energy for the Congress. But Tilak and Savarkar
were born leaders. Their class was original. Such leaders
bring forth original thoughts. They make organizations great
unlike others who are made great by organizations which
they cling to. Subhas Bose was a born leader, but not a man
of original ideas. The role and responsibility which Gandhiji
and Nehru played and bore in the Congress, which arose over
the taints and toils of Dadabhai. Surendranath, Gokhale,
Tilak and Das, fell on Savarkar alone in the Hindu Mahasabha.
Savarkar had to begin on a clean slate. There was no other
electric personality like Pandit Nehm in the Hindu Maha-
sabha to strengthen the hands of Savarkar. Dr. Mookerjee
was once considered to be so by many, but he eventually
broke the backbone of the Hindu Mahasabha when he himself
withdrew his candidature at the time of the elections to the
Central Assembly in 1945, and ultimately even resigned the
membership of the Working Committee of the Hindu Maha-
sabha in 1948 !


Ill

The resignation of Savarkar from the Presidentship of the
Hindu Mahasabha was disastrous and shocking to the forces
of Akhand Hindusthan in view of the grave situation that



294 SAVABKAR AND HIS TIMES

was developing in Indian politics. The Individual Civil Dis-
having failed to achiavn any practical

purpose or attract any attention, Gandhijl was obbged to call
it off. The Congress was fast approaching a critical situation.
Its virtual dictator, Gandhiji, prepared for a short, swift and
final struggle for India’s freedom. And the All -India Congress
Committee awaited marching orders for an open rebellion
called the Quit India Movement.

The Liberals deprecated the proposed Congress struggle as
inopportune. Dr. Ambedkar despaired of it, and Mr. Jinnah
construed it as a direct challenge to Islam ! According to
Savarkar, the declaration of “ Quit India bag and baggage ”
was attended with colossal absurdity. Gandhiji wished the
Britishers to quit India, but agreed to the stationing of their
army in India ! On the eve of the August Revolution the late
Sir Tej Bahadur Sapru declared that none had the right to
gamble with the lives and safety of 400 million people. Though
he was not a believer, he said, in any sepai'atist cry, he felt
the necessity of coming to a settlement with the minorities ;
that the British should declare that India would have the
fullest measure of self-government within a year after the
war ; that coalition Governments should be formed in the
provinces ; that Gandhiji, Jinnah, Savarkar and the leaders
of all parties should meet in a conference and come to a settle-
ment for the period of the war and set up a machinery for the
framing of a constitution for the future and that the Congress
should abandon the contemplated struggle.^ Lokanayak Aney,
then a Member of the Viceroy’s Executive Council, appealed
to Gandhiji and the Congress to convene a conference of lead-
ing political parties in the country with a view to presenting
a united demand for freedom. Aney said in his speech at
the Tilak Mandir, a week before the outbreak of the August
Revolution : “ Tilak was a firm believer in the integrity and
indivisibility of India. This was amply shown by his attitude
towards the plan of partitioning Bengal.”^ But with all
this Aney’s subsequent attitude was quite inconsistent with
Tilak’s teachings. What must have been the magnitude of
the agonies caused to the departed soul of Tilak when his

MAHASABHA MARCHES ON 295

brilliant lieutenant, Aney, afterwards wished Jinnah and
Gandhiji success in the travail of Pakistan ! And what mental
torments Aney’s Guru and prophet must have undergone
when his worthy disciple congratulated Mr. Jinnah on his
becoming the first Governor-General of Pakistan carved out
of the vivisected and bleeding Motherland of Tilak !

Savarkar’s attitude to the Quit India movement was clear.
In his famous speech before the Shanivarwada, Poona, on
August 2, 1942, Savarkar complimented the Congress on its
having come round to the view of the Hindu Mahasabha that
communal unity was not a sine qua non for the winning of
freedom. He also declared that the Hindu Mahasabha would
join the Congress in the contemplated struggle provided that
the Congress solemnly guaranteed that it would irrevocably
stand by the unity and integrity of India, that the Congress
would not make any pact with the anti-national Muslim
League, and that the Congress would accept Hindi with the
Nagari Script as the Lingua Franca of India. Savarkar, how-
ever, put it tersely on the strength of the unquestionable proof
he had in his possession that the leader in Gandhiji had
always been vacillating and further said that it was his
considered opinion that Gandhiji would unquestionably agree
not only to one Pakistan in India but to many. Then ex-
pressing his unfailing belief in the militarization policy of the
Hindu Mahasabha, Savarkar said that if Gandhiji pinned his
faith on his fast to secure his demands, it would not be heeded
at all by the British amidst the fire and booming of the war.
This historic speech of Savarkar was considered to be so
important that even the British Broadcasting Station broad-
cast it from London.

Although the terms laid down by Savarkar for co-operation
were reasonable, the Congress and its virtual dictator stub-
bornly refused to have anything to do with these conditions.
Instead, the A.I.C.C. in its fateful Bombay session on August
7, 1942, actually went on placating the Muslims more by
declaring that the residuary powers would be vested in the
Provincial Governments in addition to the right of self-
determination given to the Provinces to secede from the
Central State. The climax was reached when Gandhiji, the
de facto ruler of the Congress, in an authoritative letter to



296 SAVARKAR AND HIS TIMES

Mr. Jinnah, said in all sincerity : “ Congress will have no
objection to the British Government transferring all the
powers it today exercises, to the Muslim League on behalf of
the whole of India including the so-called Indian India. The
Congress will not only not obstruct any Government which the
Muslim League may form, but even join the Government.”

It is quite clear that in view of this anti-national attitude
of the Congress towards the national majority, Savarkar did
well in not identifying the Hindu Mahasabha with the so-
called all-out struggle of the Congress as its price and inevi-
table consequences would have been and were in fact after-
wards the vivisection of India ! Besides, Savarkar was of the
opinion that in respect of tactical questions, the timing, the
ways, the means, the methods of revolution and above all,
the effectiveness which could depend on sane calculations,
there was no elaborate planning in advance by the Congress
at all. The truth of this remark was realized by many
Congress leaders afterwards. Savarkar was not for mere
mass upheaval. The historian-leader wanted a pre-planned
revolution which would attempt to gain the support of the
military. For, no revolution ever succeeded without the
backing of the army. This reality was never visualized by
the Congress, nor did it even dream of it.

Gandhiji was to launch his all-out struggle for the over-
throw of the foreign domination after the A.I.C.C. approval
of his plan on the 8th August 1942. But all the Congress
leaders including Gandhiji were arrested the same night. As
a result of their arrest, popular discontent, mass disturbances
and their rigorous suppression by the British Government
threw the country into a turmoil. Post offices and railway
stations were damaged and destroyed by the Congress under-
grovmd workers. Telegraph, railway and telephone wires
were cut. Rails were removed and a few small bridges were
wrecked by youths actuated by patriotic motives.

Yet the marked feature of the struggle was that it was
predominantly Hindu and practically the whole of the Muslim
sections, Muslim localities, Muslim majority towns and cities,
the provinces of Assam, Orissa, the Punjab, N.-W.F.P., and
comparatively Sind remained aloof from this revolution.
Mr. Jinnah emphasised the Muslim aloofness from this

movement when he declared in unmistakable terms that the
Muslims were opposed to the August revolution, and urged
the Muslims to keep away from it. He also warned the
August revolutionaries not to meddle with Muslim affairs
and provoke them into any counter-revolution.

Savarkar’s stand was both patriotic and practical. In a
statement issued on the 10th of August he said : “ The

inevitable has happened. The foremost and patriotic leaders
of the Congress including Mahatma Gandhi, Pandit Nehru
and hundreds of other leaders of the Congress party are
arrested and imprisoned. The personal sympathies of the
Hindu Sanghatanists go with them in their sufferings for a
patriotic cause.” He strongly condemned the drastic measures
adopted by the Government to quell the disturbances, and
warned the British Government that nothing but an imme-
diate proclamalion by the British Parliament granting India
the status of a completely free and equal partner in the Indo-
British Commonwealth with rights and duties equal with
those of Great Britain herself and its immediate realization
would solve the problem.” He openly sympathized with the
patriotic struggle of the Congress Hindus, and their sufferings
and the untold calamities from detention to death they faced
and underwent. But despite the malicious and mad propa-
ganda against Savarkar by the Congress press for his not
joining the revolutionary struggle, his foresight and judgment
could not drive him headlong and blindfold into the struggle,
the outcome of which, he conscientiously believed, would be
detrimental to the interests and integrity of India. Nay, it
was his firm conviction that under the lead of Gandhiji, the
Congress Quit India movement was bound to end in a split
India message. So he said he could not make a common cause
with the Congress on a wrong issue that would ultimately
lead to national dissolution and devastation, and he could not
adopt a line of action for the sake of a united front. He pointed
out that even the Congress and Gandhiji never made a united
front with the revolutionaries or with the Sanghatanists at
Hyderabad or at Bhagalpvu* although the issues then were of
national importance and interests. For Gandhiji and the
Congress in their own way believed sincerely that the line of



298 SAVARKAR AND HIS TIMES

action adopted by the revolutionaries and the Hindu Sangha-
tanists was detrimental to the interests of the nation.

Savarkar now exhorted fervently the Hindu Sanghatanists
who happened to be Members of the Cabinet, Local bodies,
Legislatures, Councils, Government Committees, those serv-
ing in the Army, Air Force, Navy and those working in
ammunition factories not to be led away by emotion and
abandon their posts. He advised them to stick to their
various posts, and conserve their energies for the impending
real fight for the national integrity and interests. He warned
them that those very Congressmen would ultimately
endanger the national integrity of India, and their Quit India
movement would thus end in the vivisection of India.

After the outbreak of the August revolution, Savarkar’s
views were heard with more concern and interest throughout
the coimtry and in foreign lands as well. Although Savarkar
was not in favour of the line of thought behind the Congress
struggle, he was ever insistent on the demand for Indian
freedom. He sent a cable to the British press warning the
British public that the British bayonets might suppress the
violent outburst of popular discontent ; but “ bayonets can
never appease national discontent or remove its cause.” He
further stressed in his statement that India’s willing co-
operation could only be secured if the British Parliament
made an immediate declaration to the effect that “(1) India is
raised to the position of a free nation in the Indo-British
Commonwealth having equal status with that of Britain
herself, (2) during the war period this declaration should be
immediately implemented by Indianization of the Central
Executive Council whose decisions would be binding on the
Viceroy with the only exception of matters military and
strategical in connection with suppression of any internal
anarchy and defending India against external invasion, (3)
military forces should be fully Indianized as early as possible,
(4) Provincial Governors should also have Executive Coim-
cils similar to the Central, and (5) after the end of the war,
a conference should be immediately convened to frame a
national constitution for India so as to give full effect to the
declaration referred to above.”

This appeal issued by Savarkar to the British public, writes



MAHASABHA MARCHES ON 299

the London Correspondent of the Bombay Chronicle in his
despatch of August 26, 1942, was “prominently featured by
the leading newspapers like the Times, Manchester Guardian,
Daily Herald, News Chronicle, and the Yorkshire Post without
comment.” The correspondent proceeds : “ The appeal has
been the topic of discussion among a section of the political
leaders here and it is felt that an early initiative on the
part of the British Government on the lines suggested by
Mr. Savarkar is well worth making and with goodwill and
co-operation on both sides, a satisfactory way out of the
present Indian deadlock may yet be evolved.” The correspon-
dent concludes : “ Mr. Savarkar’s statement also came up for
informal discu.ssion among the Indian residents in London
who gathered last night in a public meeting of the Indian
League in the Central Hall.”

But Mr. Winston Churchill, the greatest imperiahst under
the sun, was not there to liquidate the British Empire. On
September 10, 1942, he assured the British Parliament in a
statement on India that there was nothing serious about the
Indian situation to cause them any worry and added that
there were more British forces in India than there had ever
been. Savarkar could not tolerate the British Premier’s boast
which he uttered in utter contempt for Indian national aspira-
tions. So Savarkar reminded Mr. Churchill of the fate of
Nebuchadnezzar, the mighty king of Babylon, who spoke in
a similar boastful tone, while standing on the precipice of his
mighty pride and power, and met his doom. Savarkar further
remarked that the future of India did not lie in the lap of
Mr. Churchill, but lay in the laps of war gods.

Though the British propaganda had duped Americans into
believing the hoax to a very great extent, it became quite
impossible for the British Government to misrepresent any
longer the deteriorated Indian political situation and the dead-
lock in foreign countries. At this juncture the Muslim
League resolved to send its deputation to foreign countries
to propagate the ideal of Pakistan. Savarkar therefore
resolved to coimteract the Muslim League propaganda in
foreign countries by sending a Hindu Mahasabha deputation
to America and other countries to acquaint those covmtries
with the political struggle and problem of India, and to foil the



300 SAVARKAR AND HIS TIMES

false British propaganda and expose its hollowness which had
misled the world opinion into believing that the Cripps Mis-
sion had failed not so much owing to unwillingness of the
British to part with power as to internecine conflicts of the
Indian people.

The idea of sending the deputation was subsequently
dropped as neither the Muslim League members were, nor
Rajaji was allowed to go abroad. However, the Hindu Maha-
sabha leaders decided to set up a committee of the Hindu
Mahasabha to conduct negotiations with all important Indian
political parties and personalities on the three outstanding
national demands which the Hindu Mahasabha had framed.
The Committee consisted of Savarkar, the President,
Dr. Mookerjee, Dr. Moonje, Sri N. C. Chatterjee, Raja
Maheshwar Dayal, Rai Bahadur Meherchand Khanna and
Prof. V. G. Deshpande. Tlie national demands were as fol-
lows : (1) the immediate recognition of India by the British
Parliament as an independent nation, (2) national coalition
government with full powers during the war period excepting
the military portfolio, so far as the operative part was con-
cerned, (3) the holding of a constitution-framing Assembly as
soon as the war ceased. Dr. Shyama Prasad Mookerjee was
the prominent figure that moved with interest and vigour so
much so that the committee evoked a great wave of enthuiasm
all over India and representatives of the British, the
American, the Chinese press and also of other countries took
interest in the developments, and gave wide publicity in their
home countries to the move and efforts of the Hindu
Mahasabha.

The second All-India great organization, to quote Lord
Devonshire, the then Under-Secretary of State for India,
succeeded in securing an agreement on the national demands
and a united appeal signed with unanimity by the foremost
leaders of the Sikh brotherhood, the Presidents of the Momin
and the Azad Muslim Conferences and other prominent
Muslim organizations, the Presidents of the Christian Federa-
tion, the Nationalist League, the Liberal Federation and
the ministers of Provincial Governments of Sind, Bengal
and Orissa. The only party that did not sign the national
demands was the intransigent Muslim League. Savarkar



MAHASABHA MARCHES ON SOI

knew the Muslim League’s attitude, and had strictly warned
Dr. Mookeriee not to interview Mr. Jinnah unless the League
leader himself expressed his desire to meet him. Still in his
personal capacity, Dr. Mookerjee saw Mr. Jinnah who
surprised him by quoting offhand extracts from Savarkar’s
Presidential Addresses and twisting them to support his own
demand for Pakistan.

Savarkar forwarded the Memorandum containing these
united demands on the 9th of October 1942, to Mr. Churchill,
the Premier of Great Britain, urging the British Government
to transfer power in accordance with the united national
demands put forward by the Hindus, the Muslims and the
Christians ; the Congress demand being more or less on the
same lines. Mr. Churchill acknowledged through the Viceroy
the receipt of the appeal, and appreciated Savarkar’s efforts
in promoting unity among the several elements in Indian life,
but observed that they had not so far resulted in any specific
or constructive proposals enjoying the support of all the major
parties. Savarkar then exposed the British Government by
declaring that if the British Government could bestow the
curse of slavery on India in spite of India’s united will, why
did the British now bestow the blessings of freedom in spite
of her differences and dissensions ? He also asserted that the
British Imperialism and not India’s dissensions was the cause
of India’s misery !

The Hindu Mahasabha move for the united demand for
independence flashed into the headlines. It had a very power-
ful effect on the public opinion in India and in foreign lands
too. As a result of this, several press representatives and
public men, who came to study the Indian situation in general
from America, China and England, tried to know more closely
the Hindu Mahasabha ideology and policy. Even American
film-men got the Presidential office at Savarkar Sadan,
Bombay, and its routine work screened and the news reels
were exhibited in America.

But the most important outcome of the move for the united
demand for independence was that it proved beyond cavil or
criticism the falsity of the dishonest criticism of the opponents
of the Hindu Mahasabha that being a communal organization,
it could not give a lead to national policy. The Hindu



302 SAVARKAR AND HIS TIMES

Mahasabha was in fact ever for a reasonable compromise. The
Sind Hindu Sabha had honourably joined hands with the
Muslim League in running a coalition Ministry. Dr. Mookerjee
worked with Mr. Fazlul Huq successfully for a year or so in
the Bengal Cabinet for the benefit of all communities ; but he
resigned the post when the Governor made it impossible for
him to serve the people with self-respect. These steps suffi-
ciently demonstrated that the Hindu Mahasabha endeavoured
to capture the centres of power only in public interest and
not for the loaves and fishes of office.

But when their monopolized reserves were utilized by the
patriotic forces for the good of the people as best as they
could, the Congress press, circles and leading groups shed
crocodile tears and condemned Savarkar for being pro-
Pakistani, and beti-aying Hindu interests as if they themselves
had turned overnight Hindu-minded, caring for and guarding
Hindu interests more watchfully than Savarkar did. Savarkar
was amused with this accusation levelled by Congressmen
and, saying that their anxiety for Hindu interest was quite
laudable, he added ; “ The pity is that whether these very
gentlemen would have any face to welcome their leaders
when they would rush to the League-Headquarters after
their release, to sign the pact for the vivisection of India, and
sacrifice the Hindu interests with a vengeance on the altar of
the Congress fetish of pseudo-nationalism.” What a prophecy !
There never was a prophet so unfailing and so unrelenting in
his prophecies ! For all these gentlemen and journals did
verily support, some with brazen faces and some with sunken
heads, the anti-Hindu policy of the Congress leaders after
their release from jails.
