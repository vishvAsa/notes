> A question is always asked to me: how I happen\[ed\] to take such
> \[a\] high degree of education. Another question is being asked: why I
> am inclined towards Buddhism. These questions are asked because I was
> born in a community known in India as the "Untouchables." This preface
> is not the place for answering the first question. But this preface
> may be the place for answering the second question.
>
> The direct answer to this question is that I regard the Buddha's
> Dhamma to be the best. No religion can be compared to it. If a modern
> man who knws science must have a religion, the only religion he can
> have is the Religion of the Buddha. This conviction has grown in me
> after thirty-five years of close study of all religions.
>
> How I was led to study Buddhism is another story. It may be
> interesting for the reader to know. This is how it happened.
>
> My father was a military officer, but at the same time a very
> religious person. He brought me up under a strict discipline. From my
> early age I found certain contradictions in my father's religious way
> of life. He was a Kabirpanthi, though his father was Ramanandi. As
> such, he did not believe in Murti Puja (Idol Worship), and yet he
> performed Ganapati Puja--of course for our sake, but I did not like
> it. He read the books of his Panth. At the same time, he compelled me
> and my elder brother to read every day before going to bed a portion
> of \[the\] **Mahabharata** and **Ramayana** to my sisters and other
> persons who assembled at my father's house to hear the Katha. This
> went on for a long number of years.
>
> The year I passed the English Fourth Standard Examination, my
> community people wanted to celebrate the occasion by holding a public
> meeting to congratulate me. Compared to the state of education in
> other communities, this was hardly an occasion for celebration. But it
> was felt by the organisers that I was the first boy in my community to
> reach this stage; they thought that I had reached a great height. They
> went to my father to ask for his permission. My father flatly refused,
> saying that such a thing would inflate the boy's head; after all, he
> has only passed an examination and done nothing more. Those who wanted
> to celebrate the event were greatly disappointed. They, however, did
> not give way. They went to Dada Keluskar, a personal friend of my
> father, and asked him to intervene. He agreed. After a little
> argumentation, my father yielded, and the meeting was held. Dada
> Keluskar presided. He was a literary person of his time. At the end of
> his address he gave me as a gift a copy of his book on the life of the
> Buddha, which he had written for the Baroda Sayajirao Oriental Series.
> I read the book with great interest, and was greatly impressed and
> moved by it.
>
> I began to ask why my father did not introduce us to the Buddhist
> literature. After this, I was determined to ask my father this
> question. One day I did. I asked my father why he insisted upon our
> reading the **Mahabharata** and **Ramayana**, which recounted the
> greatness of the Brahmins and the Kshatriyas and repeated the stories
> of the degradation of the Shudras and the Untouchables. My father did
> not like the question. He merely said, "You must not ask such silly
> questions. You are only boys; you must do as you are told." My father
> was a Roman Patriarch, and exercised most extensive Patria Pretestas
> over his children. I alone could take a little liberty with him, and
> that was because my mother had died in my childhood, leaving me to the
> care of my auntie.
>
> So after some time, I asked again the same question. This time my
> father had evidently prepared himself for a reply. He said, "The
> reason why I ask you to read the **Mahabharata** and **Ramayana** is
> this: we belong to the Untouchables, and you are likely to develop an
> inferiority complex, which is natural. The value of \[the\]
> **Mahabharata** and **Ramayana** lies in removing this inferiority
> complex. See Drona and Karna--they were small men, but to what heights
> they rose! Look at Valmiki--he was a Koli, but he became the author of
> \[the\] **Ramayana**. It is for removing this inferiority complex that
> I ask you to read the **Mahabharata** and **Ramayana**."
>
> I could see that there was some force in my father's argument. But I
> was not satisfied. I told my father that I did not like any of the
> figures in \[the\] **Mahabharata**. I said, "I do not like Bhishma and
> Drona, nor Krishna. Bhishma and Drona were hypocrites. They said one
> thing and did quite the opposite. Krishna believed in fraud. His life
> is nothing but a series of frauds. Equal dislike I have for Rama.
> Examine his conduct in the Sarupnakha \[=Shurpanakha\] episode
> \[and\] in the Vali Sugriva episode, and his beastly behaviour
> towards Sita." My father was silent, and made no reply. He knew that
> there was a revolt.
>
> This is how I turned to the Buddha, with the help of the book given to
> me by Dada Keluskar. It was not with an empty mind that I went to the
> Buddha at that early age. I had a background, and in reading the
> Buddhist Lore I could always compare and contrast. This is the origin
> of my interest in the Buddha and His Dhamma.
>
> The urge to write this book has a different origin. In 1951 the Editor
> of the Mahabodhi Society's Journal of Calcutta asked me to write an
> article for the Vaishak Number. In that article I argued that the
> Buddha's Religion was the only religion which a society awakened by
> science could accept, and without which it would perish. I also
> pointed out that for the modern world Buddhism was the only religion
> which it must have to save itself. That Buddhism makes \[a\] slow
> advance is due to the fact that its literature is so vast that no one
> can read the whole of it. That it has no such thing as a bible, as the
> Christians have, is its greatest handicap. On the publication of this
> article, I received many calls, written and oral, to write such a
> book. It is in response to these calls that I have undertaken the
> task.
>
> To disarm all criticism I would like to make it clear that I claim no
> originality for the book. It is a compilation and assembly plant. The
> material has been gathered from various books. I would particularly
> like to mention Ashvaghosha's **Buddhavita** \[=**Buddhacharita**\],
> whose poetry no one can excel. In the narrative of certain events I
> have even borrowed his language.
>
> The only originality that I can claim in \[=is\] the order of
> presentation of the topics, in which I have tried to introduce
> simplicity and clarity. There are certain matters which give
> headache\[s\] to the student of Buddhism. I have dealt with them in
> the Introduction.
>
> It remains for me to express my gratitude to those who have been
> helpful to me. I am very grateful to Mr. Nanak Chand Rattua of Village
> Sakrulli and Mr. Parkash Chand of Village Nangal Khurd in the district
> of Hoshiarpur (Punjab) for the burden they have taken upon themselves
> to type out the manuscript. They have done it several times. Shri
> Nanak Chand Rattu took special pains and put in very hard labour in
> accomplishing this great task. He did the whole work of typing etc.
> very willingly and without caring for his health and \[=or\] any sort
> of remuneration. Both Mr. Nanak Chand Rattu and Mr. Parkash Chand did
> their job as a token of their greatest love and affection towards me.
> Their labours can hardly be repaid. I am very much grateful to them.
>
> When I took up the task of composing the book I was ill, and \[I\] am
> still ill. During these five years there were many ups and downs in my
> health. At some stages my condition had become so critical that
> doctors talked of me as a dying flame. The successful rekindling of
> this dying flame is due to the medical skill of my wife and Dr.
> Malvankar. They alone have helped me to complete the work. I am also
> thankful to Mr. M. B. Chitnis, who took \[a\] special interest in
> correcting \[the\] proof and to go \[=in going\] through the whole
> book.
>
> I may mention that this is one of the three books which will form a
> set for the proper understanding of Buddhism. The other books are: (i)
> **Buddha and Karl Marx**; and (ii) **Revolution and Counter-Revolution
> in Ancient India**. They are written out in parts. I hope to publish
> them soon.
