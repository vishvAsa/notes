## A BENEDICTION

(Written to Sister Nivedita)

The mother's heart, the hero's will,  
The sweetness of the southern breeze,  
The sacred charm and strength that dwell  
On Aryan altars, flaming, free;  
All these be yours, and many more  
No ancient soul could dream before â€”  
Be thou to India's future son  
The mistress, servant, friend in one.
