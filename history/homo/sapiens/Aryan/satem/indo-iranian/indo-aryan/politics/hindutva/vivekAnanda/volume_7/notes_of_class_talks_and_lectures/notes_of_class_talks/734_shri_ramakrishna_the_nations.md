## SHRI RAMAKRISHNA: THE NATION'S IDEAL

In order that a nation may rise, it must have a high ideal. Now, that
ideal is, of course, the abstract Brahman. But as you all cannot be
inspired by an abstract ideal, you must have a personal ideal. You have
got that, in the person of Shri Ramakrishna. The reason why other
personages cannot be our ideal now is, that their days are gone; and in
order that Vedanta may come to everyone, there must be a person who is
in sympathy with the present generation. This is fulfilled in Shri
Ramakrishna. So now you should place him before everyone. Whether one
accepts him as a Sādhu or an Avatāra does not matter.

He said he would come once more with us. Then, I think, he will embrace
Videha-Mukti (Absolute Emancipation). If you wish to work, you must have
such an Ishta-Devatā, or Guardian Angel, as the Christian nations call
it. I sometimes imagine that different nations have different
Ishta-Devatas, and these are each trying for supremacy. Sometimes I
fancy, such an Ishta-Devata becomes powerless to do service to a nation.
