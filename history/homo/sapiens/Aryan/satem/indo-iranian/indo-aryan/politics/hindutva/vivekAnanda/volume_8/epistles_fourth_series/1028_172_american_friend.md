## CLXXII

*To an American friend*

SAN FRANCISCO,  
*7th April, 1900*.

. . . I am more calm and quiet now than I ever was. I am on my own feet,
working hard and with pleasure. To work I have the right. Mother knows
the rest.

You see, I shall have to stay here, longer than I intended, and work.
But don't be disturbed. I shall work out all my problems. I am on my own
feet now, and I begin to see the light. Success would have led me
astray, and I would have lost sight of the truth that I am a Sannyasin.
That is why Mother is giving me this experience.

My boat is nearing the calm harbour from which it is never more to be
driven out. Glory, glory unto Mother! I have no wish, no ambition now.
Blessed be Mother! I am the servant of Ramakrishna. I am merely a
machine. I know nothing else. Nor do I want to know. Glory, glory unto
Shri Guru!
