## LXI

228 WEST 39TH STREET,  
NEW YORK,  
*8th December, 1895*.

DEAR FRIEND (Mr. E. T. Sturdy),

After ten days of a most tedious and rough voyage I safely arrived in
New York. My friends had already engaged some rooms at the above where I
am living now and intend to hold classes ere long. In the meanwhile the
Theosophists have been alarmed very much and are trying their best to
hurt me; but they and their followers are of no consequence whatever.

I went to see Mrs. Leggett and other friends, and they are as kind and
enthusiastic as ever.

Did you hear anything from India about the coming Sannyasin?

I will write later fuller particulars of the work here.

Kindly convey my best love to Miss MÃ¼ller and to Mrs. Sturdy and all the
other friends and kiss baby for me. 

Yours ever in the *Sat*,

VIVEKANANDA.
