PROLOGUE

  
  

 It can rightly be said that the long introduction with which this
treatise opens leaves no excuse for a prologue. But there is an epilogue
which is affixed to the treatise. Having done that, I thought of
prefixing a prologue, firstly, because an epilogue needs to be balanced
by a prologue, and secondly, because the prologue gives me room to state
in a few words the origin of this treatise to those who may be curious
to know it and to impress upon the readers the importance of the issues
raised in it. For the satisfaction of the curious it may be stated that
there exists, at any rate in the Bombay Presidency, a political
organization called the Independent Labour Party (abbreviated into
I.L.P.) for the last three years. It is not an ancient, hoary
organization which can claim to have grown grey in politics. The I.L.P.
is not in its dotage and is not overtaken by senility, for which second
childhood is given as a more agreeable name. Compared with other
political organizations, the I.L.P. is a young and fairly active body,
not subservient to any clique or interest. Immediately after the passing
of the Lahore Resolution on Pakistan by the Muslim League, the Executive
Council of the I.L.P. met to consider what attitude it should adopt
towards this project of Pakistan. The Executive Council could see that
there was underlying Pakistan an idea to which no objection could be
taken. Indeed, the Council was attracted to the scheme of Pakistan
inasmuch as it meant the creation of ethnic states as a solution of the
communal problem. The Council, however, did not feel competent to
pronounce at that stage a decided opinion on the issue of Pakistan. The
Council, therefore, resolved to appoint a committee to study the
question and make a report on it. The committee consisted of myself as
the Chairman, and Principal M. V. Donde, B.A.; Mr. S. C. Joshi,
M.A.,LL.B., Advocate (O.S.), M.L.C.; Mr.R.R.Bhole, B.Sc., LL.B., M.L.A.;
Mr. D. G. Jadhav, B.A., LL.B., M.L.A.; and Mr. A. V. Chitre, B.A.,
M.L.A., all belonging to the I.L.P., as members of the committee. Mr. D.
V. Pradhan, Member, Bombay Municipal Corporation, acted as Secretary to
the committee. The committee asked me to prepare a report on Pakistan
which I did. The same was submitted to the Executive Council of the
I.L.P., which resolved that the report should be published. The
treatise now published is that report.

 The book is intended to assist the student of Pakistan to come to
his own conclusion. With that object in view, I have not only assembled
in this volume all the necessary and relevant data but have also added
14 appendices and 3 maps, which in my judgement, form an important
accompaniment to the book.

 It is not enough for the reader to go over the material collected in
the following pages. He must also reflect over it. Let him take to heart
the warning which Carlyle gave to Englishmen of his generation. He said:

> "The Genius of England no longer soars Sunward, world-defiant, like an
> Eagle through the storms, ' mewing her mighty youth,'.... the Genius
> of England—much like a greedy Ostrich intent on provender and a whole
> skin. . . . ; with its Ostrich-head stuck into....whatever sheltering
> Fallacy there may be, and so awaits the issue. The issue has been
> slow; but it now seems to have been inevitable. No Ostrich, intent on
> gross terrene provender and sticking its head into Fallacies, but will
> be awakened one day—in a terrible *a posteriori* manner if not
> otherwise! Awake before it comes to that. Gods and men did us awake!
> The Voices of our Fathers, with thousand fold stern monition to one
> and all, bid us awake."

 This warning, I am convinced, applies to Indians in their present
circumstances as it once did to Englishmen, and Indians, if they pay no
heed to it, will do so at their peril.

 Now, a word for those who have helped me in the preparation of this
report. Mr. M. G. Tipnis, D.C.E., (Kalabhuwan, Baroda), and Mr.
Chhaganlal S. Mody have rendered me great assistance, the former in
preparing the maps and the latter in typing the manuscript. I wish to
express my gratitude to both for their work which they have done purely
as a labour of love. Thanks are also due in a special measure to my
friends Mr. B. R. Kadrekar and Mr. K. V. Chitre for their labours in
undertaking the most uninteresting and dull task of correcting the proof
sand supervising the printing.
