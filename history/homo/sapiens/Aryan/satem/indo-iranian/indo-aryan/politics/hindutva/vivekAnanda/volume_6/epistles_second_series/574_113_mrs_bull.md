## CXIII

GREYCOAT GARDENS,  
WESTMINSTER, LONDON, S.W.,  
*13th November, 1896*.

DEAR MRS. BULL,

... I am very soon starting for India, most probably on the 16th of
December. As I am very desirous to see India once before I come again to
America, and as I have arranged to take several friends from England
with me to India, it is impossible for me to go to America on my way,
however I might have liked it.

Dr. Janes is doing splendid work indeed. I can hardly express my
gratitude for the many kindnesses and the help he has given me and my
work. ... The work is progressing beautifully here.

You will be interested to know that the first edition of *Raja-Yoga* is
sold out, and there is a standing order for several hundreds more. 

Yours etc.,

VIVEKANANDA.
