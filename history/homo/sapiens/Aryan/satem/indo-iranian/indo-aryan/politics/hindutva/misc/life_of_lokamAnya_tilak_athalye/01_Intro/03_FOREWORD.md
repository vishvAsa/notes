title = "03 FOREWORD"

When the author asked me to write out a 
foreword when I was in Bombay in the 
month of June, I readily consented, because 
I thought that he would forget all about it 
after I left. But the author is inexorable 
and here am I trying to dictate a foreword. 

It is difficult for me to say anything about 
the late Lokamanya, as I feel overwhelmed 
whenever I think of his greatness. Yet his 
greatness was so simple. No analysis of his 
genius or character is possible because of 
that very simplicity. I confess I cannot 
analyse his greatness ; I can only say what 
has been said from a thousand platforms in 
India that he was a man of whom India is 
proud. 

It is unnecessary for me to refer to his love 
of country, pride of race, indomitable courage, 
unflagging perseverance and spirit of sacrifice 
which made his activities so real. All these 
are a matter of record in the recent history 
of Indian Nationalism.

It has often been said that the Late Lokamanya 
was a practical politician and not an 
idealist with a vision. I naturally shrink 
from an attempt to classify his genius. The 
character of a truly great man defies classifi- 
cation. I shall relate one little incident of 
his life and leave the readers to put what 
name they please to his genius. In 1906, 
when the Congress was held in Calcutta the 
Lokamanya and many of my Maharashtra 
friends were my guests. One day during his 
visit a gentleman from Lucknow came to 
see him. I was present. This gentleman was 
a Moderate in politics and began to speak 
somewhat angrily. He accused Lokamanya 
of creating dissensions in the Congress camp 
and said "Do you know what the Maho- 
medans are doing ? They are combining 
against the Hindus and trying to start a 
Pan-Islamic movement." Lokamanya's eyes 
glistened. He said, "Are you sure?". This 
gentleman got very angry. He said " Sure ? 
I am as sure as I am here talking to you. I 
have seen some of the letters. Whilst you 
are dividing the Hindus, the Mahomedans 
are uniting to crush us." To my surprise, 
Lokamanya said with a smile, which it is 
impossible for me to describe. "Then is 
our deliverance at hand. Don't you see the 
moment the ^Mahomedans combine, that 
moment the Government will be at them. 
The moment the Government is at them, 
that very moment they will unite with us."+++(5)+++ 
It was after this that the Moslem League was 
started in open opposition to the I. N. Congress.  
It was after this that the Moslem 
League strove and worked in perfect unity 
with the I. N. Congress. It was after this 
that the Hindu-Moslem Unity was declared 
a crime in the Punjab. Now we all know. 
Was he a practical politician ? Was he an 
idealist with a vision ?

#PREFACE 



The story of the Life of Lokamanya Tilak 
is the history of Western India during the 
1 ast forty years ; it is the history of the birth 
and growth of Indian NationaUsm, its im- 
pact on the Indian Bureaucracy, its vicissi- 
tudes, its struggles, disappointments, suc- 
cesses and reverses. To attempt a task of 
such magnitude, so eminently fit for a philo- 
sopher-historian is at any time a " stroke of 
temerity." It is still more so at the present 
juncture when the ashes of the controver- 
sies in which Mr. Tilak so prominently 
figured are hot. Though dead, Mr. Tilak 
still lives in our midst ; and the time is not 
yet for a pronouncement of the final verdict 
of History upon him. That is evidently a 
work for the next generation when the biographer or historian will be fortified in his 
judgment by the knowledge of the ultimate 
success or failure of Mr. Tilak's methods 
and those of his opponents. My task is 
comparatively modest ; and though my diffi- 
culties are infinitely greater than those of 
the future historian, a contemporary biogra- 
pher has obvious advantages over him. 

Throughout the succeeding narrative, I 
have never tried to conceal my bias for Mr. 
Tilak. Nor will the reader — Moderate or 
Extremist, Brahmin or Non-Brahmin, Indian 
or European — expect me to do so. I have 
however, to the best of my ability, scrupulous- 
ly adhered to truth. Not being closely identified with party principles, personalities and 
prejudices, I can claim to have judged Mr. 
Tilak's opponents sympathetically. I have 
as great a regard for Ranade as for Vishnushastri Chiploonkar ; and if in the following 
pages the reader finds any lapses from the 
standard of fair criticism set by me, he 
should unhesitatingly attribute them rather 
to an imperfect comprehension of truth than 
to any conscious desire of misrepresenting 
Mr. Tilak's opponents. Mr. Tilak's great- 
ness is so immense and self-evident that it 
stands in no need of any exggeration or 
misrepresentation. 

The idea of writing a life of the Lokamanya was dimly and vaguely floating in 
my mind for a number of years. It recurred 
to me again and again when, taking advantage 
of the obscurity which hung over his earher 
activities, many of his enthusiastic opponents in Western India actively set themselves 
to indulge in cheap gibes by irreverential and 
by no means fair references to what they 
considered to be his mistakes. In this, they 
can be pardoned for, being young, these 
opponents might have been the dupes of mis- 
understandings born in an atmosphere of 
party prejudices. But their attacks certainly led me to go beneath the surface of 
things and inquire what truth there was in 
them. And after three year's patient work, 
I find that Mr. Tilak's activities, far from 
having the shortcomings and inconsistencies 
of a political opportunist, have all the well- 
sustained unity of a beautiful drama, in 
which each scene is organically related to 
the preceding and to the succeeding and all 
together make one harmonious whole. 

It would have been almost impossible for 
me to do this laborious work without the 
active co-operation of my friends. Their 
number is legion. I shall take this oppor- 
tunity of thanking only a few of them ; and 
if I have to omit individual reference to all, 
that is due to the limits of an ordinary pre- 
face. Mr. M. R. Paranjpye, Principal of the 
Gokuldas Tejpal High School, Bombay, kind- 
ly undertook to help me in revising the 
work. Mr. Annasahib Sapre and Mr. Karmelkar prepared the Press-copy in an incredibly short time. I must also thank Mr. M. K. David and Mr. Bhausahib Oak for 
having helped me in a variety of ways. 
Even then I should hardly have hoped of 
accomplishing this task but for the sponta- 
neous assistance rendered bv Prof. Haribhau 
Tulpule, Mr. D. K. Sathe and Mr. Annasahib 
Chiploonkar, who during the last ten months 
had placed their services entirely at my disposal. 

The credit of having supplied the excellent 
paper on which this book is published, goes 
entirely to Mr. M. R. Joshi, Paper-merchant, 
Poona. Mr. Nanasahib Gondhalekar, the 
enterprising Proprietor of the Jagaddhitecchu 
Press, Poona, must both be praised and thanked for having printed off this book in five 
short weeks on his new Monotype machine. 

While this Preface was being written, news 
has arrived that Mr. C. R. Das, President- 
elect of the forth-coming Congress has been 
arrested. I must sincerely thank him for 
having snatched an odd minute to write a 
foreword when his mind was distracted by the 
troubles brewing in Bengal. 

The unique feature of Mr. Tilak's career is 
that, like a magnet it draws all. While 
the populace claim him as one of their own, 
aristocrats recognize that he represented, in 
his intellectual and spiritual eminence, a 
nobler aristocracy than has fallen to their lot. 
Old persons feel interest in the romance of 
his career ; the middle-aged derive instruction therefrom. On the younger generation, 
the influence of Mr. Tilak's life is still deeper. 
It not only interests and instructs but inspires the mind to a performance of great 
deeds. Like the story of the Pandavas, it is 
bound to go down to generations unborn as 
an eternal source of inspiration.
