> §1. The Centres of His Preachings
>
>  1. It is not that after the appointment of the missionaries the
> Lord sat at one place. He too continued to be his own missionary.  
>  3. Of such centres, the chief were Shravasti and Rajagraha.  
>  4. He visited Shravasti about 75 times, and Rajagraha about 24
> times.  
>  5. Certain other places were made minor centres.  
>  6. They were Kapilavastu, which he visited 6 times; Vesali, which
> he visited 6 times; and Kamas-sadhamma, 4 times.
>
>   
> § 2. The Places He Visited
>
>  1. Besides these main and minor centres, the Blessed Lord visited
> many other places during the course of his missionary tour.  
>  2. He visited Ukkatha, Nadika, Sal, Assapura, Ghoshitaram,
> Nalanda, Appana, Etuma.  
>  3. He visited Opasad, lccha-naukal, Chandal Kuppa, Kushinara.  
>  4. He visited Devadaha, Pava, Ambasanda, Setavya, Anupiya, and
> Ugunma.  
>  5. The names of the places he visited show that he travelled over
> the Sakya Desa, the Kuru Desa, and \[the\] Anga Desa.  
>  6. Roughly speaking, he travelled over the whole of Northern
> India.  
>  7. These appear to be a few places. But what distance do they
> cover? Rajagraha from Lumbini is not less than 250 miles. This just
> gives an idea of distances.  
>  8. These distances the Lord walked on foot. He did not even use a
> bullock-cart.  
>  9. In his wanderings he had no place to stay, until later on when
> his lay disciples built Viharas and resting places which he and his
> Bhikkhus used as halts on their journeys. Most often he lived under
> the shade of wayside trees.  
>  10. He went from place to place, sometimes from village to
> village, resolving the doubts and difficulties of those who were
> willing to accept his message, controverting the arguments of those
> who were his opponents, and preaching his gospel to those who, like
> children, came to him for guidance.  
>  11. The Blessed Lord knew that all those who came to listen to him
> were not all of them intelligent, not all of them came with an open
> and a free mind.  
>  12. He had even warned the brethren that there were three sorts of
> listeners:  
>  13. The empty-head, the fool who cannot see--though oft and oft,
> unto the brethren going, he hears their talk, beginning, middle, end,
> but can never grasp it. Wisdom is not his.  
>  14. Better than he the man of scattered brains, who oft and oft,
> unto the brethren going, hears all their talk, beginning, middle, end,
> and seated there can grasp the very words, yet, rising, nought
> retains. Blank is his mind.  
>  15. Better than these the man of wisdom wide. He, oft and oft unto
> the brethren going, hears all their talk, beginning, middle, end, and
> seated there, can grasp the very words, bears all in mind, steadfast,
> unwavering, skilled in the Norm and what conforms thereto.  
>  16. Notwithstanding this, the Lord was never tired of going from
> place to place preaching his gospel.  
>  17. As a bhikkhu the Lord never had more than three pieces of
> clothes \[=clothing\]. He lived on one meal a day, and he begged his
> food from door to door every morning.  
>  18. His mission was the hardest task assigned to any human being.
> He discharged it so cheerfully.
>
>   
> § 3. Last Meeting between Mother and Son, and between Wife and Husband
>
>  1. Before their death Mahaprajapati and Yeshodhara met the Blessed
> Lord,  
>  2. It was probably their last meeting with him.  
>  3. Mahaprajapati went, and first worshipped him.  
>  4. She thanked him for having given her the happiness of the good
> doctrine; for her having been spiritually born through him; for the
> doctrine having grown in her through him; for her having suckled him,
> drinking the Dhamma-milk of him; for her having plunged in and crossed
> over the ocean of becoming through him--what a glorious thing it has
> been to be known as the mother of the Buddha!  
>  5. And then she uttered her plea: "I desire to die, finally having
> put away this corpse. O sorrow-ender, permit me."  
>  6. Yeshodhara, addressing the Blessed Lord, said that she was in
> her seventy-eighth year. The Blessed Lord replied that he was in his
> eighties.  
>  7. She told him that she was to die that very night. Her tone was
> more self-reliant than that of Mahaprajapati. She did not ask his
> permission to die, nor did she go to him to seek him as her refuge.  
>  8. On the contrary, she said to him (me saranam atthano), " I am
> my own refuge."  
>  9. She had conquered all the cankers in her life.  
>  10. She came to thank him, because it was he who had shown her the
> way and given her the power.
>
>   
> § 4. Last Meeting between Father and Son
>
>  1. Once when the Lord was staying at Raja-graha in the bamboo
> grove, Rahula was staying at Ambalathika.  
>  2. The Blessed One, arising towards eventide from his meditation,
> went over to Rahula, who seeing the Lord some way off, set a seat for
> him and water to wash his feet.  
>  3. Seating himself on the seat set for him, the Lord poured water
> over his feet, while Rahula, after salutations, took his seat to one
> side.  
>  4. Addressing Rahula, the Blessed Lord said, "He who does not
> shrink from deliberate lying has not, say I, left undone any evil
> thing which he could. Therefore, you must school yourself never to
> tell a lie even in jest.  
>  5. "In the same way you must reflect, and again in doing every
> act, in speaking every word, and in thinking every thought.  
>  6. "When you want to do anything, you must reflect whether it
> would conduce to your or others' harm or to both, and so is a wrong
> act productive of woe and ripening into woe. If reflection tells you
> that this is the nature of that contemplated act, you should not do
> it.  
>  7. "But if reflection assures you there is no harm but good in it,
> then you may do it.  
>  8. "Grow in loving kindness; for as you do so, malevolence will
> pass away.  
>  9. "Grow in compassion; for as you do so, vexation will pass
> away.  
>  10. "Grow in gladness over others' welfare; for as you do so,
> aversions will pass away.  
>  11. "Grow in poised equanimity; for as you do so, all repugnance
> will pass away.  
>  12. "Grow in contemplation of the body's corruption; for as you do
> so, passion will pass away.  
>  13. "Grow in perception of the fleeting nature of things; for as
> you do so, the pride of self will fall away."  
>  14. Thus spoke the Lord. Glad at heart, Rahula rejoiced in what
> the Lord had said.
>
>   
> § 5. Last Meeting between the Buddha and Sariputta
>
>  1. The Blessed Lord was staying in Shravasti, in the Jetavana in
> the Gaudhakuti Vihar.  
>  2. Sariputta arrived there with a company of five hundred
> brethren.  
>  3. After saluting the Blessed One, Sariputta told him that the
> last day of his life on earth had arrived. Will the Blessed Lord be
> pleased to permit him to give up his mortal coils \[=body\]?  
>  4. The Blessed Lord asked Sariputta if he had selected any place
> for his parinibbana.  
>  5. Sariputta told the Blessed One, "I was born in the village
> Nalaka in Magadha. The house in which I was born still stands. I have
> chosen my home for my parinibbana."  
>  6. The Lord replied, "Dear Sariputta! Do what pleases you."  
>  7. Sariputta fell on the feet of the Blessed Lord arid said, "I
> have practised the paramitas for one thousand Kalpas with only one
> wish: to have the honour of falling on \[=at\] your feet. I have
> achieved that end, and there is no end to my happiness."  
>  8. "We do not believe in rebirth. Therefore this is our last
> meeting. Let the Lord forgive me my faults. My last day has come."  
>  9. "Sariputta! There is nothing to forgive," said the Lord.  
>  10. When Sariputta rose to go, the Lord in his honour got up, and
> stood up on the verandah of the Gauohakuti Vihar.  
>  11. Then Sariputta said to the Blessed Lord, "I was happy when I
> saw you first. I am happy to see you now. I know this is the last
> darshan of you \[that\] I am having. I shall not have your darshan
> again."  
>  12. Joining together the palms of his hand\[s\], he walked away
> without showing his back to the Blessed Lord.  
>  13. Then the Blessed Lord said to the assembled brethren, "Follow
> your Elder Brother"--and the assembly for the first time left the
> Blessed Lord and went after Sariputta.  
>  14. Sariputta, on reaching his village, died in his home, in the
> very room in which he was born.  
>  15. He was cremated, and his ashes were taken to the Blessed
> Lord.  
>  16. On receiving the ashes, the Blessed Lord said to the brethren,
> "He was the wisest, he had no acquisitive instinct, he was energetic
> and industrious, he hated sin--ye brethren, see his ashes! He was as
> strong as the earth in his forgiveness, he never allowed anger to
> enter his mind, he was never controlled by any desire, he had
> conquered all his passions, he was full of sympathy, fellowship and
> love."  
>  17. About that time Mahamogallan was then living in a solitary
> Vihar near Rajagraha. He was murdered by some assassins employed by
> the enemies of the Blessed Lord.  
>  18. The sad news of his end was conveyed to the Blessed One.
> Sariputta and Mahamogallan were his two chief disciples. They were
> called Dharma-Senapati--Defenders of the Faith. The Blessed Lord
> depended upon them to continue the spread of his gospel.  
>  19. The Blessed Lord was deeply affected by their death in his
> lifetime.  
>  20. He did not like to stay in Shravasti; and to relieve his mind,
> he decided to move on.
