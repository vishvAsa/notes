## LXXXIV

C/O RISIBAR MOOKERJEE,  
CHIEF JUDGE,  
KASHMIR,  
*17th September, 1898*.

YOUR HIGHNESS, (Maharaja of Khetri.)

I have been very ill here for two weeks. Now getting better. I am in
want of funds. Though the American; friends are doing everything they
can to help me, I feel shame to beg from them all the time, especially
as illness makes one incur contingent expenses. I have no shame; to beg
of one person in the world and that is yourself. Whether you give or
refuse, it is the same to me. If possible send some money kindly. How
are you? I am going down by the middle of October.

Very glad to learn from Jagamohan the complete recovery of the Kumar
(Prince) Saheb. Things are going on well with me; hoping it is the same
with you.

Ever yours in the Lord,

VIVEKANANDA.
