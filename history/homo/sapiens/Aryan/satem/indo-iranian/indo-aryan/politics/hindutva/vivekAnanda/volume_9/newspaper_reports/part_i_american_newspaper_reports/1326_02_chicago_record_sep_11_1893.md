 Hindoo, and
Dr. John H. Barrows, the Chicago Presbyterian. These four talked as if
they were brothers of one faith.[1](#fn1)

The Hindoo is of smooth countenance. His rather fleshy face is bright
and intelligent. He wears an orange turban and a robe of the same color.
His English is very good. "I have no home," said he.

I travel about from one college to another in India, lecturing to the
students. Before starting for America I had been for some time in
Madras. Since arriving in this country I have been treated with utmost
courtesy and kindness. It is very gratifying to us to be recognized in
this Parliament, which may have such an important bearing on the
religious history of the world. We expect to learn much and take back
some great truths to our 15,000,000 faithful Brahmins.
