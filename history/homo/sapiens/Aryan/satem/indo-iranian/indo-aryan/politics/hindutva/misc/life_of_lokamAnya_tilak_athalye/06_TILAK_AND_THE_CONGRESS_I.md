> At the Poona Congress of 1895, when Gokhale was a secretary 
of the Reception Committee, the ridiculous controversy started 
by Mr. Tilak, about letting the Social Conference have the use 
of the Congress Mandap assumed disproportionate dimensions 
and Mr. Tilak triumphed momentarily. I do not know what 
he now (1915) thinks in his heart of hearts of the part, that he 
played in the matter, though he can, like the skilful advocate 
that he is, still put a fair complexion on it is necessary.

nPHESE words, coming from the pen of a responsible 
Moderate leader show to what length party misunder- 
standings and party misrepresentations can go. To a 
certain type of people, Mr. Tilak has always appeared as 
the evil genius of the Congress, creating trouble, foment- 
ing dissensions, recklessly courting Government wrath 
and leading the nation to the verge of disaster. They 
sum up Mr. Tilak's contribution to the Congress cause 
by mentioning the controversies at the Poona Congress 
and the fiasco at Surat. Only history will show how 
Mr. Tilak popularised the Congress movement during its 
infancy, how for that purpose his co-operation was 
sought, though his person was disliked, how he tried to 
infuse fresh blood into that body when the original 
* firebrands ' were degenerating into apathy, how he

failed, how matters culminated in the unfortu- 
nate spUt at Surat, how the Congress dwindled 
into nothingness, and how Mr. Tilak's return (1916) 
to the Congress camp enhanced its prestige, power 
and popularity, until at last in the present moment 
it has been recognised as the non-of&cial ParUament 
of the country. 

Mr. Tilak joined the Congress in 1889, — only after his 
separation from the Deccan Education Society had be- 
come ine\'itable and imminent. " One thing at a time '* 
was always his motto. If he sacrificed Social Reform 
to Politics, let us not forget that in the first 
ten years of his career he sacrificed Politics to 
Education. The principle of division of labour, in- 
troduced mainly by Mr. Tilak into our public Hfe 
has at last been accepted and no man is now 
blamed for confining his attention to a particular 
branch of national acti\dties. 

The question is often asked " WTiy was not Mr. Tilak's 
name even proposed for the Presidentship of the Con- 
gress earlier ?" His genius, learning, courage and sacri- 
fices were generally admitted. What then came in his 
way ? If Mr. Tilak was a junior, was not Mr. (Now 
Dr. Sir) Chandavarkar equally so in 1900 ? The answer 
is that the group of the politicians who held the Congress 
in leading strings was rather exclusive and would not 
agree to admit into the inner sanctuary an element of an 
alien type. The qualities that then were considered to 
belong to a statesman were eloquence of speech, supp e- 
ness of conduct, European habits and association (mis- 
named influence) with the Bureaucracy. Mr. Tilak had 
none of these ' rare ' gifts. He possessed in a boundless 
5

measure the ''too coommon** qualities, — fixity of pur- 
pose, inflexibility of will, boundless courage and enthu- 
siasm, lofty idealism and tremendous earnestness. In 
the midst of holiday poUticians claiming monopoly of 
wisdom and statesmanship, he was an impracticable 
enthusiast, to be tolerated as an unavoidable evil. His 
superabundant energies were fully utilized and six suc- 
cessive Provincial Conferences (all of them, except two 
held at Poona) were organised by him and by Mr. 
Namjoshi. But in the agenda of resolutions only a 
back seat was given to him and he was very rarely given 
the opportunity of moving important resolutions in the 
Congress. Mr. Tilak who cared more for work than 
for honour and display cheerfully did the part of 
the work entrusted to him. If the credit of popu- 
larising the Congress work in Maharashtra can be 
claimed by any one, it can be by Mr. Tilak. The 
Congress itself was an institution after western models ; 
its"; leaders, so far at least as the land of the Marathas 
was concerned, were chiefly Government servants 
and pensioners, titled nonentities and self-seeking 
youngsters. Add to this; the controversies in con- 
nection with the Age of Consent BiU, Sharada Sadan 
and . the Hindu-Mahomedan riots, controversies in 
which Mr. Tilak had to take a definitely hostile atti- 
tude towards the Reformers of the day. StUl, at the 
call of the Congress, he threw aside his opposition to 
those people, and year in and year out, appealed to the 
general public to follow its lead aud strengthen it by 
moral, intellectual and financial support. Had Mr. 
Tilak been the narrow-minded bigot he was represented 
to be he would never have supported the Congress Pro-

paganda, headed that it was by most of tlie reformers 
and risked his popularity with the masses by 
championing a body which utilised his energy and 
abiUty but which showed very httle recognition of his 
ivorth. All these circumstances must carefully be 
remembered if we would correctty understand the tangle 
of the Poona Congress (1895). 

The real question before the Poona pubUc of 1895 was 
not whether the Social Conference of that year should, 
according to the usual practice have been allowed to 
be held in the Congress Mandap; for had this been the 
real question at issue " the ridiculous controversy " 
said to have been " started by Mr. Tilak " would at 
once have been settled by Mr. Ranade's graceful and 
timely declaration that the Social Conference, which in 
truth was attended only by a small fraction of the 
Congress delegates and visitors would be held in some 
other place. When there is a childish dispute over a 
trifle, all the parties concerned are responsible, if it 
assumes " disproportionate dimensions." The question 
of holding or not holding the Social Conference in the 
Congress Pavilion was only a move in the bigger game, 
the deep-laid plot, of discrediting Mr. Tilak and humilia- 
ting him in the eyes of the Poona pubhc and of the 
Congress at large. Nobody will say that the petty 
motives of jealousy which moved lesser men inspired 
leaders like Ranade. It will, however have to be 
admitted that had Ranade risen to the full height which 
the occasion demanded much heart-burning would have 
been avoided. But he was powerless to assert his will 
against the clique that surrounded him. It was humour- 
ously called " The Tilak Persecution Society." 



68 LOKAMANYA TILAK 

Looked at, from an impersonal standpoint, the differ- 
ences between Tilak and Ranade have been summarized 
by the former as follows : — 

" Every one*, whether orthodox or heterodox, refor- 
mer or reactionary should join in and support the 
Congress movement. A Congress in Poona cannot be 
regarded a success unless the majority of the people in 
Poona join it enthusiastically. We must approach the 
trader, the artizan and the working man as well as 
the educated classes and make all of them subscribe 
to the Congress fund and in order to do this 
we must appeal to each of them in a manner, so 
as not to offend their susceptibilities unnecessarily. 
The Congress eventually aims at being a Con- 
gress of the people and the object cannot be 
achieved, unless, every year, an effort is made to 
approach more and more the classes that have not 
taken hitherto much interest in the movement. * =^' * 
If the masses are drawn to the Congress, it is possible 
that they may not lend their support directly or indirect- 
ly to the cause of the Social Conference. It is this 
apprehension that makes the friends of Social Reform 
restrict the scope of their work for the Congress within 
a safe narrow circle. ^ ^ One (party) wishes to draw 
to the Congress as large a portion of the public as it 
possibly can, irrespective of the question of Social 
Reform : the other does not wish to go much beyond the 
circle of the frionds of reform. " * * The real point of 
issue is whether ''' '-' the Congress in Poona is to be a 
Congress of the people or of a particular section of it. 

* From a letter to the Times of India (Quoted in the Mahraita^ 
November 3, i<'95). 



TILAK AND THE CONGRESS — I 69 

* * If the friends of Social Reform are not willing 
to respect public opinion, which I regret to say, some of 
them are prepared to characterise as brute force — I for 
one am not * * prepared to make a split in the Congress 
camp by persisting in claiming a recognition of the views 
of the majority of the public ^ ^ ," 

When the work of the Congress was to be commenced, 
the Reformers were in a great glee, as, happening to 
command a majority in the Standing Congress Commit- 
tee, they expected to carry things in their own way. 
But Mr. Tilak soon made it clear to them that he would 
be no party to such a manifestly unjust arrangement. 
They, therefore had to set up a working Committee 
consisting of an equal number of members belonging to 
both the parties. How to neutralise this " concession " 
was a question which seriously occupied some mischie- 
vous spirits of the Reform Party and they hit upon a 
very ingenious trick by means of which they hoped 
either to place Mr. Tilak in an awkward situation or to 
create a split in his party, which would give numerical 
superiority to the Reformers in the Working Committee. 
They stirred up the fury of the ultra-orthodox section 
of the people by constantly boasting that the Social 
Conference, so disliked by the majority — would be held 
in the Congress pavilion in the teeth of their opposition. 
The result was that Sardar Balasaheb Natu, with others 
belonging to the extreme wing of the Orthodox Party 
issued a circular, demanding that the Social Conference 
should not be held in the Congress Mandap. Thus a 
split was created in the Orthodox Camp. 

Regarding the relations of the Social Conference witk 
the National Congress, a contemporary paper wrote as 



70 LOKAMANYA TILAK 

follows : — " At the Calcutta Congress (1886) that shrewd 
and experienced old Parsee, Mr. Dadabhoy Naoroji, the 
President dwelt upon the subject both in his opening 
speech and during the discussion ; and decided against 
the Congress having anything to do with Social Reform, 
directly or indirectly. 

" But the hot-headed reformers, threw the words of 
the old Parsi patriot, and the sense of the Calcutta 
Congress to the winds. At Madras they tried their game 
next year and with the assistance of a few addle-pated 
Madrasee reformers succeeded in obtaining their wish ; 
and after the Congress, was held within its pandals the 
first Social Conference. * * 

Since 1887 to 1894, the Social Conference has held its 
sittings as the tail of the Congress."* 

So much for wisdom ; now let us see how fanaticism 
bred fanaticism. When the controversies over the Age 
of Consent Bill were at their height, the late Mr. Hume^, 
" father " of the Indian National Congress declared 
that he would sever his connection from the Congress if 
he found the majority of the leading Congressmen op- 
posed to the BiU. This unreasonable and overbearing 
conduct naturaUy excited many Congressmen and it 
was said that if acquiescence in hasty and mischievous 
measures of Social Reform was to be the price of the 
support of Mr. Hume to India's political demands — 
well, Indians could afford to do without him. Such 
reckless language naturally made people suspicious and 
as early as 189 1 many people expressed a desire 
that the Social Conference should not be held in 



* The Hope (Calcutta). 



TiLAK AND THE CONGRESS — I 7 1 

the Congress pavilion. If responsible leaders like Hume 
could give vent to such thoughtless remarks, can we 
blame Sardar Balasaheb Natu for having given such an 
undue importance to the site of the Social Conference ? 
Mr. Tilak's attitude regarding the dispute about the 
Social Conference was perfectly reasonable. As early 
as July 23rd, 1895, he openly declared in the Kesari that 
those who made the holding or not holding of the Social 
Conference in the Congress Mandap the condition of 
their financial support to the Congress were not the 
friends of the Congress. He proposed that the dispute 
should be decided by the Congress itself or by the Re- 
ception Committee. A better solution of this question 
could not be imagined and yet the cry was kept up that 
Mr. Tilak was supporting the extreme wing of the ortho- 
dox party headed by Sardar Natu ! A side-Hght 

• 

on the sincerity of this cry is thrown by the fact 
that som^e of the Reformers (e.g. Kashinathpant Natu, 
Keshavrao Patvardhan) refused to contribute to the 
Congress fund unless positively assured that the Social 
Conference would be held in the Congress pavihon. 

Another cry in the same game of anyhow discrediting 
Mr. Tilak was that his attention to the Congress work 
was perfunctory. People were " shocked " to find that 
the pavilion was not ready in September. Mr. Tilak 
reminded them it could be done only after the rainy 
season was over. " Wliat about chairs " said they. 
Mr. Tilak told them that though the chairs bore the 
brand of " AustraUan chairs " stiU they could always be 
had in Bombay at a week's notice. " And the volun- 
teers "? Well, the volunteers were not required before 
the middle of December ; still, written complaints were 



72 LOKAMANYA TILAK 

made to the Working Committee. Mr. Tilak had 
secured the site, prepared plans and estimates, sent 
round men and letters for subscription, actually collect- 
ed some money. For all this and other work, he 
was praised by Mr. C. Vijayaraghavachariar who ex- 
pressed his surprise that Poona should have com- 
menced work in right earnest so early. And yet the 
reformers of the Working Committee wanted to sit 
in judgment upon Mr. Tilak. Mr. Tilak showed 
how they themselves had shirked work and had 
thrown all the burden upon him. He produced 
the report of the Working Committee of the preceding 
year's (1894) Congress at Madras and challenged his 
opponents to compare that work with his. Discom- 
fitted, the reformers had to submit to passing a 
resolution expressing their satisfaction at Mr. Tilak 's 
work. 

Discomfiture, however did not bring repentance. 
Taking advantage of Mr. Tilak's temporary absence 
from Poona, they made attempts to remove the Congress 
Office from his residence. The Sub-Committees were 
swamped with reformers and instead of adhering to the 
original resolution, fixing one vote for every gentleman 
who paid Rs. 50 and upwards, it was decided (Oct. 18) 
that those who paid upwards of Rs. 50 were entitled to 
vote not only on their own behalf but separately for 
heir wives and children ! A more ridiculous resolu- 
tion cannot be imagined and this the reformers could 
"'arry through only on account of the split in the Ortho- 
*^ox party. And yet Mr. Tilak was supposed to have 
^een in league with Sardar Natu ! 

Mr. Tilak exposed all these tactics in a circular letter 



TILAK AND THE CONGRESS — I 73 

to all the leading Congressmen and Associations in the 
mofussil. He also exposed them at a public meeting 
held at Poona on October 22nd. As the Reformers' 
majority in the Committee had usurped all the func- 
tions, it was resolved at this meeting that a new Recep- 
tion Committee on an equitable basis should be formed. 
The Reformers considered this meeting to be nothing 
more than a display of " brute force " and hence 
appealed to the Standing Committee to settle the dis- 
pute. The Standing Committee decided that both the 
parties should be represented by two Secretaries each, 
that Bombay should contribute three Secretaries and 
that this Committee of seven should carry on all the 
Congress work. Great pressure was brought to bear 
upon Mr. Tilak to accept this arrangement ; and when 
at last Mr. Tilak did consent to it he quickly found that 
it was all imaginary and that the status quo was main- 
tained by the Reformers. Disgusted beyond measure 
by all these tactics, Mr. Tilak took the only course left 
to him and resigned his secretaryship on Nov. 4th. 

The Reformers were delighted ; and 3^et they felt 
unhappy. They felt as uncomfortable and suspicious 
as Macbeth when he had got rid of Banquo. What if 
Mr. Tilak made a row ? Police aid was sought and got 
because " the attitude of a section of the Hindu Com- 
munity in Poona is hostile to the Congress." The re- 
peated advice which Mr. Tilak gave to the public, 
appealing to them to stand by the Congress, failed to 
diminish this feverish anxiety. "Suppose, the Mandap is 
set on fire by Mr. Tilak's emissaries. WTiat would be- 
come of the Congress?" These foolish fears haunted 
them like a nightmare. Still, with dogged and malig- 



74 LOKAMANYA TILAK 

nant obstinacy they continued their activities against 
Mr. Tilak, chiefly through a newspaper subsidized by 
the Reception Committee. There is no knowing how 
the unpleasantness of the situation would have been 
aggravated had not the Hon'ble Mr. Surendranath 
Banerjea, President-elect of the Congress, himself a 
staunch Social Reformer, set matters right. He re- 
quested Mr. Ranade not to press the question of the 
Social Conference. He even threw out broad hints that 
if the disputes at Poona could not be amicably settled 
he would refuse to preside. This courageous and states- 
manlike conduct compelled Mr. Ranade to be reasonable 
and to make a belated declaration that he would not 
try to hold the Social Conference in the Congress pavi- 
lion. Had he made the declaration earlier and on his 
own initiative, his reputation for statesmanship would 
have been redeemed ; but his declaration made practi- 
cally under compulsion, together with the continuance 
by his minions of their disingenuous tactics kept the 
situation almost unchanged. The offer of co-operation, 
repeatedly made by Mr. Tilak was spumed. The Reform- 
ers, conscious of their own unpopularity were afraid 
to bear the light of the day. And yet a public meeting 
to elect Poona delegates was to be held. Bowing to 
the inevitable, they convened a public meeting (20th 
December). The hall selected for the purpose was very 
small and the announcement of the meeting was made 
very late, presumably to outwit Mr. Tilak' s partisans. 
But long before the time of the meeting the opponents 
of the Reformers, alert as ever had packed the hall. 
With a clever manoeuvre they elected their own pre- 
sident. This perplexed the Reformers and as a mark 



TILAK AND THE CONGRESS — I 75 

of protest, some 15 gentlemen including Prof. Gokhale 
left the meeting. 

In spite of the worst fears of the reformers, the Con- 
gress was a brilliant success. The reception accorded to 
the Thunderer of Bengal was simply grand. Enthu- 
siasm was catching. After the Congress was over 
Sardar Baba Maharaj, a friend of Mr. Tilak was ' at 
Home ' to the Congress President and the Congress 
delegates. Then the party was led to attend a huge 
meeting in connection with the Shivaji Memorial. Mr. 
Banerjea made a thrilling speech and exhorted the^ 
|)eople to join the Shivaji festival inaugurated by 
Mr. Tilak. 

It is so very unpleasant to rake up from the forgot- 
ten past an episode of discord. But when we find 
attempts made to discredit Mr. Tilak for imaginary sins 
it is necessary to apportion the blame and decide where 
truth and fairness lay. Had Mr. Tialk's critics content- 
ed themselves with asserting that he disapproved of the 
holding of the Social Conference on the lines on which 
it was held, nobody would have cared to criticise such 
remarks for the simple reason that even leading Refor- 
mers of those days lil^e the late Hon. Rao Bahadur 
Nulkar thought pretty much in the same way. Mr. 
Tilak's supposed opposition to the Reform movement 
or to the Social Conference had absolutely nothing to 
do with the insignificant question of the holding of the 
Social Conference in the Congress pavilion. If this 
petty question assumed " disproportionate dimensions," 
the responsibility lies rather on those who, not caring 
for the fair name of their city were wiUing to vent their 
spite upon the devoted head of Mr. Tilak and discredit 



^6 LOKAMANYA TILAK 

him in the eyes of his educated countrymen. The 
attempt partially succeeded. For though outside the 
Bombay Presidency, these disputes failed create any 
impression still in Maharashtra the estrangement be- 
tween the Reformers and the Orthodox party became 
complete ; and what is more important, the Bombay 
leaders who had taken very little part in the Social 
questions of the day were considerably influenced by 
the controversies owing to their association with the 
Reformers at Poona. Here then was sown the seed of 
that misunderstanding between the Lion of Bombay 
and the Lion of Poona, which unfortunately was des- 
tined to bear fruit at Surat in 1907. And all this could 
have been avoided by a single tactful and timely move 
on the part of Ranade. 

In conclusion, we may note one or two incidents in 
the life of the Congress which have a direct bearing on 
the present narrative. We have already seen that in 
the 2nd Congress at Calcutta, the Grand Old Man of 
India, keenly aware of the danger of mixing up Social 
Reform with Politics, declared the former as lying out- 
side the scope of the Congress. Not that he did not 
favour Social Reform, but he was particular about 
the unity of Congressmen. The third Congress under 
the Presidency of the late Mr. Badruddin Tyabji 
did not pass a resolution in favour of Cow protection, 
simply to conciliate Mahomedan opinion, in spite 
of the fact that the President himself and aU 
the delegates were in favour of protecting cows. 
If then the third Congress could leave out one 
important resolution — a question of principle — for 
the sake of unity, could not Ranade have tried 



TILAK AND THE CONGRESS — I 'JJ 

to secure unity by not pressing the Pandal quesr- 
tion ? Evidently, therefore party feeling got the better 
of patriotism. The smooth working of the Reception 
Committee at the Calcutta Congress of 1806 was 
endangered by bitter quarrels between the Bi ahmoes 
and the Orthodox party and a breach over religious 
questions seemed imminent. Here too, the principle 
ot keeping the Congress aloof from Social and 
religious controversies was forgotten. At the Madras 
Congress of 1894, some Purists of the Social Re- 
form party v/anted to boycott certain delegates whose 
morals had become the subject of much public dis- 
cussion and their extravagance was checked by the 
judicious and tactful conduct of the President who 
pointed out that though Gladstone was unwilling to nego- 
tiate with Pamell as the leader of the Irish Nationalists, 
still he had no objection to allow Pamell to work in the 
interests of Irelanl. It will thus be seen that the 
Poona disputes in 1895, did not form an isolated episode 
in the history of the Congress. A political organisa- 
tion that allows its cohesion to be endangered on side- 
issues betrays its own interests and plays into the hands 
of the common opponent. Viewed from this stand- 
point, the ridiculous controversies over the pandal 
question at Poona appear not merely impradent but 
positively suicidil, irrespective of the responsibility of 
this party or that ; and a careful perusal of t\\2 prece- 
ding pages will convince the reader that Mr. Tilak's con- 
tribution to these controversies was entirely involun- 
tary.
