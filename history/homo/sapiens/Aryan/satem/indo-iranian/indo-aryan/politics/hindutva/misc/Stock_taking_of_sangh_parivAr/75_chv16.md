*The Sunday Observer*  
New Delhi, November 19-25, 1995  
**16. ‘How can any Muslim in this**  
**country say that he does**  
**not respect Ram?’**

</div>

(We reproduce some of the questions and answers in an interview given by
Dr. Murli Manohar Joshi in Bombay to two journalists from the weekly,
Rajeev D. Pai and Firdaus Ashraf, on 13 November 1995.)

**Why has the BJP now relegated the temple issue to the backburner?**  
It’s there. It’s in our manifesto.

**Yes, but not so prominent as Kashmir.**  
You see, every problem is related to the other. Sometimes some problem
is at the fore, sometimes some (*other*). Sometimes you are dining,
sometimes you are bathing. Now you say that why are you bathing now and
why are you not eating? But I am happy that you are becoming Ram
*bhakts*, and you remember the temple. It’s a good sign.

**What is the party’s stand on Varanasi and Mathura?**  
We have said they are not on our agenda.

**At the moment?**  
No, we have said they are not on our agenda. We are the BJP today -
after 30 years, when I am no more, I don’t know what will this country
do. How can one predict so long? - we are at the helm of affairs, we are
saying, we have said it very clearly, that it is not on our agenda.

**Will the Ram temple be built immediately if you come to power?**  
We have our own strategy for it. We have always said we will build it
through a legal process. There has been an acquisition (*of the land*)
and cases are pending in the Supreme Court. We have to make a statute
for it.

**But the matter was in court even before December 6, 1992.**  
We had always said we will pass a law. The BJP resolution has always
been either through mutual consent or by legislation, but not through
litigation.

**Will the legislation cover other disputed shrines?**  
We have said legislation for Ram temple.

**Only?**  
Yes.

**And how do you see the Muslims reacting to this?**  
Muslims in India, they don’t worship Ram as a god, but they consider him
their hero. How can any Muslim in this country say Ram does not belong
to this country or that he does not respect Ram? Even Iqbal said he is
Imam-i-Hind.

Every Indian shares the heritage of Shri Ram. It is one of the
monumental blunders of Indian political leaders to tell Indian Muslims
that they have no relation with Ram and they have relations with
Babar.^([1](#1))

**But it was the BJP which called them Babar *ki aulad…***  
We never say that. We always say, I as president of the party have said
it categorically, and I repeat it, that every Indian shares the heritage
of (*the country*), right from the Vedas down to today. Muslims are part
and parcel of the great Indian heritage. I do not consider them as
minorities. The biggest blunder which has been committed by politicians,
and which Muslims have accepted, is that they are minorities.

**How will you erase this perception?**  
By changing so many things, the education system… Pakistan celebrates
Panini’s anniversary. But they don’t speak Sanskrit. Still they share
the heritage of Panini.

**Why do we have a problem here then?**  
Because Indian politicians, particularly Congressmen, have told them
that this does not belong to you. We will tell them that this belongs as
much to you as to anybody else.

On October 12, 1 addressed a conference of our minority cell, in
Aligarh, right on the doorstep of Aligarh University. I said here is an
institution which spread this concept, that Muslims are a different
nation. I am here again to say that they are not. They are part and
parcel of this great nation, they are Mohammediya Hindus.^([2](#2))

**But then why are Muslims suspicious of the BJP?  They still prefer the
Samajwadi Party…**  
They will never prefer it. I tell you. Large numbers of Muslims have
realised that a serious mistake has been committed by their leaders.

**So what percentage of Muslim votes do you expect this time?**  
It’s not a question of what percentage of votes I expect. Anybody can
join any party. But I am more interested in (*making*) Muslims consider
themselves part and parcel of this great national heritage, that they do
not consider themselves minorities; they can vote for any party. Even
after that they may not vote for me. So what? Many people don’t vote for
me. But they are part and parcel of this country.  
 

**Footnotes:**

[¹](#1a)Dr. Joshi is blaming poor politicians instead of blaming the
real culprit - Islam - which does not permit Muslims to respect anything
from the pre-Islamic period of history in any country.

[²](#2a)This attempt to paste on Muslims a label which Islam does not
permit them to accept and which Muslims have always rejected with utter
contempt, is not only foolish but also betrays a fascist attitude. In
any case, Joshi should have known that Lala Har Dayal who had coined the
phrase ‘Mohammedi Hindus’ for Muslims in India, had admitted later on
that it was ‘my pious folly” to say so. Muslims in India have always
looked down with contempt on this sort of Hindu semantics. It is high
time for our Joshis to stop fooling themselves with what they consider
to be clever attempts at fooling others.
