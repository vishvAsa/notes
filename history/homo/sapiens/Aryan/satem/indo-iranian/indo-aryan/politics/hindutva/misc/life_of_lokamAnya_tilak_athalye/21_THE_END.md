> Mr. Tilak is dead ! Long live Mr. Tilak ! 
> 
> The Tribune. 

The situation which Mr. Tilak occupied towards the 
middle of 1920 was the most enviable any public 
man has occupied in India. He was the most success- 
ful and the most longlived of the band of self-sacrificing 
workers who started the New English School (1880), 
the Kesari and the Mahratta (1881). His opponents — 
Ranade, Telang, Mehta and Gokhale — were gathered 
to their fathers before the substantial achievement of 
their labours. He alone represented, not merely the 
youngest but the oldest generation living. Starting 
his life as an ' opponent of Social Reform ' he lived to 
count the staunchest reformers among his lieutenants. 
The branded ' enemy of the Mahomedans ' was the 
ambassador of Hindu-Moslem unity at Lucknow and 
his active co-operation was sought by and promised to 
the leaders of the Khilafat movement. The slogan of 
Swaraj, issuing from his pen in 1895 was echoed by the 
National Congress of 1906 and the Government of India 
Act of 1919. His no-rent campaign of 1896 forms one 
of the planks of the Non-co-operation programme. 
* The wrecker of the Congress' was its greatest bulwark 
and chosen President. Dreaded by the Government, 
hated by Anglo-Indians, feared by the Moderates, he was 



THE END 305 

the idol of the country, the living embodiment of all 
its aspirations. Behind him lay the memories of an 
uneven and almost single-handed struggle extending 
over forty years. Ahead, there was a struggle still, 
but a struggle where victory was certain, and the sinews 
of war quite abundant. He was not only the Moses 
but the Joshua of the Promised Land. He had won his 
Austerlitz at Amritsar, and the future struggle, grim 
as it promised to be, was in a sense far easier than 
the one in which he was engaged ever since his entry 
into the public life. 

But, — alas ! the end was approaching. Ever since 
his return from Amritsar, a sense of inexplicable fatigue 
frequently haunted him. He would occasionally talk 
of retiring from active hfe. PoUtics meant strain, phy- 
sical and mental and he did not feel himself up to it. 
This was surely the whispering of Death. 

After his sickly boyhood, Mr. Tilak enjoyed many 
years of exuberant health and energy. Rarely, if 
ever, he was HI. His digestion was exceptionally 
nice. He had the glut of a giant for thought or action. 
His powers of endurance were wonderful. His sleep 
was short and sound and very often he could dispense 
with it altogether. After a busy day, he usually read 
far into the night and was up at the usual time. His 
reading, deep and varied, lasting at a stretch for hours 
together, was never known to weary him. 

With the incarceration of 1897, there came a change. 
He lost enormously in weight. His health was pulled 
down ; his digestion was enfeebled. After his release 
he spent a few months at Sinhgad in rest and in the 
improvement of his health. To a certain extent it 
20 



306 LOKAMANYA TILAK 

did improve. But he never fully recovered from the 
blow. 

Then came diabetes, the companion of the English- 
educated in India. Evidently it was the gift of the 
Yeravda jail and it cast sUght shadows of old age on 
his person. 

For the last fifteen years of his life, this fell disease 
was his companion. Bravely did Mr. Tilak fight with 
it and so far was he successful that the disease did not 
torment him with all its virulence. It was, however, 
stni there, working insidiously, and slowly and silently 
sapping his strength ! He held the fell disease in his 
^p ; the disease too, did not loosen its hold. 

Having studied all the existing medical Uterature on 
the subject, he fixed a regimen for himself to which he 
adhered with military rigour. When it was hot, he 
usually lived at Sinhgad. Periods of hard work were 
carefully followed by rest. When he rested, he kept 
no books, he read no papers. He left instructions at 
Poona regarding the disposal of correspondence. Only 
the most important matters — private or public — whose 
execution could not be delayed and particularly those 
which required his instructions, were reported to him. His 
morning walk, occasionally in the company of some 
obscure villager, lasted for three or four hours and 
was followed by an hour's plunge. This completed 
the day's exercise. 

His capacity to withdraw his mind from work, stood 

him in good stead. Always optimistic, he never allowed 

worries, small or great, to trouble him. His self-control 

was wonderful and helped him considerably in improv- 

ng his health. Storm after storm swept past him. 



THE END 307 

leaving him, calm and self-possessed. His private 
life, lived in the full blaze of publicity, was a tower of 
strength to him ;for virtue is the greatest tonic. 

Call it the peace of a philosopher, the faith of the 
hero, the light-heartedness of a child or the recklessness 
of a soldier, his mental equanimity was the secret of 
his health. The dread uncertainties of our pubUc hie 
explain to a great extent why many a public worker 
dies young. To work with despair and defeat writ 
large on the wall is, indeed, a trial ; and to this trial 
our spirited workers are being put these many years. 
The longevity of a Dr. Bahandarkar, may not cause 
wonder ; but the comparative longevity, which Mr. 
Tilak reached, surprises those who consider his mental 
sufferings, his extraordinary brain-work and the 
vicissitudes of his life. 

Chiplonker died in 1882, Apte in 1892, Agarkar, 
Kelkar, and Namjoshi in 1895, all in the prime of hfe. 
At one time Mr. Tilak thought that he too, would be sum- 
moned away early. Providence, however, had reserved 
for him a longer career, to be written in letters of gold ; 
and yet could he not have been spared a httle more ? 

The organization of the Congress Democratic Party, 
the welding of Mr. Gandhi's programme with his own. 
an ultimatiun to the Bureaucracy, a vigorous foreign 
propaganda, these were the thoughts that occupied his 
waking and sleeping hours in the last month ( July 
1920) of his Hfe. In the course of this month, he had 
severe attacks of malaria. However, he completely re- 
covered, went to Bombay for his last fight in the Tai 
Maharaj case, triumphed over his enemies and had 
begun to think of recuperating his strength when 



308 LOKAMANYA TILAK 

an evening motor-drive brought him a chill whicS 
soon developed into high fever. None, however, sus- 
pected the worst and congratulatory anniversary meet- 
i ngs were held (23rd July) in Bombay and elsewhere. 
The fever, brought by the chill, subsided only to rec- 
tum soon. From Monday night (26th July), " his- 
fever took a decidedly serious turn and it was found 
that the base of his right lung was affected and the 
fever developed signs of pneumonia. The whole of 
Tuesday was a day of anxiety. There was no brain- 
complication and his consciousness was unimpaired.*' 
Still the situation was critical and his friends and rela- 
tives gathered to wait upon him. He chaffed his son 
upon having run up to Bombay on this flimsy pretence 
and his daughters upon being rather too fond of their 
parents' home. He disdained to leave any initructions 
regarding his affairs, though pressed to do so. "I 
am not going to die, these five years," he said " be sure 
of that." Wednesday morning, the temperature was 
normal and the pulse regular. This was a happy sign. 
But in the afternoon " again he got fever and again his 
heart began to show signs of weakness. He lost all 
consciousness and became delirious. He continued 
more or less in the same state during the whole of 
Wednesday and Thursday. On Wednesday, there was 
a complication of the stomach which began to be dis- 
tended. With great difficulty, the doctors led him out 
of the crisis. On Thursday at about 5 p.m., he had an 
attack of angina pectoris which threatened to be serious 
and fatal but, thanks to the timely efforts of the doctors, 
he was pulled out of it. He had similar attacks, three 
times afterwards, but they were weak in intensity. On 



THE END 309 

Friday and the whole of Saturday, he continued in the 
same unconscious state of mind with uncertain and 
irregular pulse and a weak heart. Suddenly at 10-30 
P.M., his heart began to show signs of exhaustion and 
his breathing became hard, and at last at 12-50 a.m., 
August 1st, 1920, the cruel hand of Death snatched him 
away." 

Anxious messages, distinguished callers, large, un- 
manageable crowds testified to the love and devotion 
he inspired. During the sad week, the hearts of all 
Indians, alternating with hopes and fears, must have 
gone up to the Almighty in silent or vocal prayer. But 
the hopes were dashed to the ground and the worst 
fears proved true, when on August ist, the news of his 
demise was flashed all over the country ! 

What a pity that he left us no parting message 1 
True, his whole life was one long message, a source of 
inspiration to all. When his feeble body was struggling 
v/ith his departing soul, even then, he thought, not of 
home and family, but of his God and his country. In 
the earher stages of his unconsciousness, when a copy 
of the Gita was shown to him, he uttered his favourite 
verses : — 

" Whenever virtue subsides and vice prevails I come 
down to protect the good, to destroy the wicked and to 
establish Dharma." {Gita, Chapter 4, Verses y &S). 

These memorable words of Lord Krishna, uttered by 



310 LOKAMANYA TILAK 

Mr. Tilak in his unconscious state, reveal the back- 
^ound of his mind. He braved the terrors of gaol-Ufe, 
he could Uve down all obloquy, persecution and misre- 
presentation on the strength of this Faith. All the 
political battles fought by him were not waged for any 
earthly reward but from a high sense of duty, based on 
an unshakable faith that God was working through him. 
During all the storms of his life, he never felt weak or 
pessimistic because he knew that he was a mere pawn 
employed by that Divinity which presided over the 
destinies of India. A Tilak may come and go ; but His 
work would never wait ; and when the ground is suffi- 
ciently prepared. He shall come down to estabhsh the 
reign of Peace and Goodness. 

Mr. Tilak's scattered and subdued utterances in deli- 
rium bespeak his love of the country. He frequently^ 
referred to the Calcutta Congress and asked " Has the 
Special been arranged ?" *' Have you wired to Mr. 
Pat el ?" Then there was the Punjab wrong to which 
he occasionally referred. Sometimes, he would get 
excited and talk wildly. In an outburst of passion he 
cmce said " 500 rupees to the editor; plus motor- 
aUowance ! What will these lord-lings do for the 
country ?" On the 28th, he frequently talked of 1818 
" 1818 — 1918 — one hundred years — what a Ufe of servi- 
tude !" The last important words, reported to have 
been uttered by him on July 29th at i p.m., were " unless. 
Swaraj is achieved, — India shall not prosper. It is 
required for our very existence !" 

The funeral of the Lokamanya was as memorable as 
his life. It has been thus graphically described by a 
contemporary : — 



THE END 3H 

" It was one o'clock at midnight. All round was peace 
and calmness. There was a little drizzle of rain and 
men, not knowing the disaster that was to overtake 
them on the morning of the next day, were having a 
sound and sweet sleep. But the mysterious power, 
'which rules the world was wide awake, and stealing a 
march on the subconscious man, carried away one of 
the most honoured, respected and beloved of the 
people- . . . .(When morning broke, people found that) 
the vigilant watchman of India's cause had disappeared 
from their midst. . . . The news of his death gave a 
shock to the people, it stunned them, they looked at 
each other with blank eyes and they knew not what 
to do. 

" Never before in the history of Bombay, was such a 
scene of universal grief witnessed. People had begun 
to flock near Sirdar Griha from 7 in the morning and by 
8a.m., there was no room for anybody to go up to catch 
his last sight. The labourer had left the miU, the Mar- 
wari his account-book, the Bania his purse and every 
man and woman was out to see the last of their be- 
loved leader. Musalmans, Parsees, Christians deserted 
their homes to pay their respects to a man, who had 
sacrificed his all at the altar of the country and suffered 
heavily for bravely defending her cause. In his life- 
time, Mr. Tilak was the recipient of many popular de- 
monstrations of good-will but the triumphal march of 
of dead Tilak through the streets on August ist, 1920 
was more magnificent than any during his life-time. 

" The body of Lokamanya Tilak was brought out and 
put on the balcony so that it could be witnessed by the 
eager and expectant crowds. The crowd increased at 



312 LOKAMANYA TILAK 

every moment and it grew so tremendous that although 
the funeral procession was timed to start at i p.m., it 
could not be started till 2 p.m. The procession was 
about a mile and a half and at a very conservative 
estimate, about two lakhs of men took part in it. 

*' In the funeral procession were seen Mr. Gandhi, 
Mr. Shaukat Ah, Dr. Kitchlew, Mr. Jamnadas, Mr. 
Banker, and many other prominent citizens of Bombay. 
Two special trains from Poona brought a number of 
Mr. Tilak's friends and devoted followers. They claim- 
ed that Mr. Tilak's body should be cremated at Poona. 
The people of Bombay insisted on getting the honour to 
themselves and in the end they won and cremated him, 
by special arrangements, on the sands of the Back Bay. 
His body was seated in a palanquin and the pall-bearers 
included Mr. Gandhi, Mr. Shaukat Ali, Dr. Kitchlew 
and many others. On the route, the procession had to 
stop at innumerable places, because a number of people 
came out to offer flowers. At every step, most enthu- 
siastic ovations were received. 

" The body was gently placed on a pyre of sandal- 
wood, so lo\dngly and liberally supplies by the Parsi 
traders ; and at sun-down, the last earthly remains of 
the Sun of Maharashtra were reduced to ashes!" 

The unexpected death of a personality of the magni- 
tude of Lokamanya Tilak united, for a time, all parties, 
and all India mourned for the eternal loss of her great 
son. Even the Anglo-Indian Press, taken as a whole, 
expressed appreciation of their life-long opponent. 
Only the Government of Bombay refused to shed tears 
with the nation ; and His Excellency Sir George Lloyd 
orfeited a precious opportunity of winning the hearts 



THE END 313 

of the people by a tactful concession to the sentiments 
of 17 non-official members of the Council, who, belong- 
ing to different political parties had united in desiring 
that the Council should be closed in honour of Mr. Tilak 
** a former member of this Council, a great Oriental 
scholar and a prominent worker in the cause of the 
country, held in high estimation by a large number of 
the people of India." But the Bureaucracy was as 
unwilling to forget its old grievances against Mr. Tilak 
as the Times of India or the Statesman. 

Thousands of memorials to the Lokamanya have 
been suggested and raised in different parts of India. 
But the grandest of them all is the one for which 
Mahatma Gandhi moved from city to city and province 
to province, collecting huge sums during the eventful 
months of April, May and June 1921. As the Mahat- 
maji has said " Truly to revere the memory of a person 
is to achieve his life's purpose. Truly to revere the 
Memory of Bal Gangadhar Tilak, whom India delighted 
and still delights to call Lokamanya must be to esta- 
blish Swaraj and thus forever perpetuate his 
memory." For this purpose, the Mahatma ji has col- 
lected the biggest fund ever raised by the people of 
India during the last hundred years. " The Tilak 
Memorial Swaraj Fund " will go down to posterity as 
a unique event in the history of this country. It will 
perpetuate not only the name of the Lokamanya but 
also that of Mahatma Gandhi, who, in three short 
months has accomplished a feat which Pandit M. M. 
Malaviya has scarcely been able to perform in the 
course of twelve years.

THE END 315 

" May his soul rest in peace !" How poor, how un- 
real do these words strike to the ear ! The soul of the 
Lokamanya will never rest in peace unless and until Swaraj 
is established. It will be bom again and again, if need 
be, in this holy land of the rishis until its high purpose 
is accomplished.
