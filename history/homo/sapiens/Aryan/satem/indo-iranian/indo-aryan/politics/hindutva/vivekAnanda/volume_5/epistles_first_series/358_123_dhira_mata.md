. . . In my opinion, a race must first cultivate a great respect for
motherhood, through the sanctification and inviolability of marriage,
before it can attain to the ideal of perfect chastity. The Roman
Catholics and the Hindus, holding marriage sacred and inviolate, have
produced great chaste men and women of immense power. To the Arab,
marriage is a contract or a forceful possession, to be dissolved at
will, and we do not find there the development of the idea of the virgin
or the Brahmachārin. Modern Buddhism — having fallen among races who had
not yet come up to the evolution of marriage — has made a travesty of
monasticism. So until there is developed in Japan a great and sacred
ideal about marriage (apart from mutual attraction and love), I do not
see how there can be great monks and nuns. As you have come to see that
the glory of life is chastity, so my eyes also have been opened to the
necessity of this great sanctification for the vast majority, in order
that a few lifelong chaste powers may be produced. . . .

I wanted to write many things, but the flesh is weak . . . "Whosoever
worships me, for whatsoever desire, I meet him with that." . . .
