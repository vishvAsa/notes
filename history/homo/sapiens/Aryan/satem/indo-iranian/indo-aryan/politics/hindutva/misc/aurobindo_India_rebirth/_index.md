**INDIA’S  
REBIRTH**

***A selection from Sri Aurobindo’s  
writings, talks and speeches***

  
  

What makes India a country unlike any other?

What power can bring about her rebirth?

Today, with the worldwide churning of blood and mud about to smother us,
our answer to these questions will decide India's destiny.

The present selection from Sri Aurobindo's writings is intended for
those who seek such an answer.

  
  

“India of the ages is not dead nor has she spoken her last creative
word; she lives and has still something to do for herself and the human
peoples. And that which must seek now to awake is not an anglicised
oriental people, docile pupil of the West and doomed to repeat the cycle
of the occident's success and failure, but still the ancient immemorable
Shakti recovering her deepest self, lifting her head higher towards the
supreme source of light and strength and turning to discover the
complete meaning and a vaster form of her Dharma.”

Sri Aurobindo

  
  
  

To India,

the ancient Mother

To Sri Aurobindo,

who saw her reborn

\*

  

“I write, not for the orthodox, nor for those who have discovered a new
orthodoxy, Samaj or Panth, nor for the unbeliever. I write for those who
acknowledge reason but do not identify reason with Western Materialism;
who are sceptics but not unbelievers; who, admitting the claims of
modern thought, still believe in India, her mission, her gospel, her
immortal life and her eternal rebirth.”

Sri Aurobindo  
(c. 1911)
