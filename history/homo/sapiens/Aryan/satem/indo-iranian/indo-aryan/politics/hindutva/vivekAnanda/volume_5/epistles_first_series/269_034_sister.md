*25th February, 1895*.

DEAR SISTER,[1](#fn1)

I am sorry you had an attack of illness. I will give you an absent
treatment though your confession takes half the strength out of my mind.

That you have rolled put of it is all right. All's well that ends well.

The books have arrived in good condition and many thanks for them.

Your ever affectionate bro.,

VIVEKANANDA.

    the Hale sisters (of whom Isabelle was one) about their study and
    practice of Christian Science. He wrote this short note from New
    York, and in this he slyly poked fun at the "'Scientists'" practice
    of never confessing to sickness.
