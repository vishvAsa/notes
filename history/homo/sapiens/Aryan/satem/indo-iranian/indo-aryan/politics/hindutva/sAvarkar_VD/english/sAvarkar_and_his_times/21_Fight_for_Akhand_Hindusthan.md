Now we come to a very important chapter in the life of
Savarkar. By now Rajaji, the whilom member of the All-
India Congress Committee, released to the press his corres-
pondence with Mr. Jinnah concerning his offer to the League
leader which was fathered by Gandhiji during his fast at the
Aga Kh^n Palace. Rajaji had now advanced to the far end
of the proposed Pakistan scheme. Speaking on the birthday
anniversary of the Prophet at Bangalore on April 12, 1943,
Rajaji had said : “ I stand for Pakistan because I do not want
that State where we Hindus and Muslims are both not
honoured. Let Muslims have Pakistan. If we agree then our
country will be saved.’’ ^ Mr. Jinnah in his press interview
on July 30, 1944, referred to the correspondence with Rajaji
and the proposal put forward by him and said : “ As regards
the merits of the proposal, Mr. Gandhi is offering a shadow,
a husk, a maimed, mutilated and moth-eaten Pakistan and
thus trying to pass off as having met our Pakistan scheme and
Muslim demand.” In one of his telegrams sent to Mr. Jinnah
and now released to the press, Rajaji said : “ Mr. Gandhi,

though not vested with representative or special capacity in
this matter, definitely approved of my proposals and autho-
rized me to approach you on that basis. The weight of his
opinion would most probably secure Congress acceptance.” ^

Mark the secret promise of the truth-seeker, Gandhiji, who
abhorred secrecy in any matter. Read this further confession
of Rajaji in his statement of July 16, 1944, issued from
Panchgani in which he said : “ It is now two years since I
started work, even though I had secured Gandhi ji’s unquali-
fied support to the scheme and it conceded all that the Muslim

League ’lad ever demanded in its resolution of 1940.” ^ Mark
the words ‘ two years Was Savarkar’s reading of the mind
of Gandhiji and his satellites incorrect, his foresight blurring
and the charges he levelled against them false ? Was Savarkar
wrong in his devastating attack on Rajaji’s role and Gandhiji’s
goal when they were actually hatching the secret move
against the integrity of India ?

Rajaji’s new offer contained the following terms : That the
Muslim League should endorse the Indian demand for Indian
Independence and co-opei iie with the Congress in the forma-
tion of a provisional Intc'in. Government and conceded that
if the Muslim majority pro^•Ihces in the West and East decide
by a plebiscite held on the basis of adult franchise in favour
of a sovereign independent State separate from Hindusthan,
the decision should be given effect to ; that in the event of
separation a mutual agreement should be entered into for safe-
guarding defence, commerce and communications and that
transfer of population should be voluntary. In the meanwhile
Gandhiji wrote a letter to Jinnah asking him for an interview.
Mr. Jinnah, who was well drilled, like the German war
machines, in conducting political negotiations, replied on
July 24, 1944, from Srinagar to Gandhiji’s letter dated the
17th July from Panchgani that he would be glad to receive
Gandhiji at his house in Bombay after his return. Mr. Jinnah
saw his life’s opportunity. When the scheme was out, there
was a flutter for a while among the Congress circles and
press ; but they were stunned to see that their holy father,
Gandhiji, himself was acting as the Godfather to the unholy
scheme of partitioning their Motherland and thereafter kept
a guilty silence on the treacherous move.

The Liberal leaders, Sir Chimanlal Setalvad and Sir V. N.
Chandavarkar, described Rajaji’s offer as a danger to India’s
security !

Savarkar who believed that India was a united whole
through ages and whose concept and worship of the Mother-
land were incomparable curtly stated ; “ It is really unjust to
look upon Rajaji alone as the villain of this tragedy. His
fault is that he allowed himself to play as a willing tool in the
hands of Gandhiji.” Savarkar flew into a rage at this beginning

* The Times of India, Bombay, dated 31-7-1944.



324 8AVARKAR AMD HIS TIMES

of the end of the United India. He added that “ the Indian
provinces were not the private properties of Gandhi ji and
Rajaji so that they could make a gift of them to anyone they
liked.” ^ Savarkar further declared that the Quit India Move-
ment of the Congress did ultimately end in the Split India
demand as foretold by him, issued an appeal to the Hindus in
general and Hindu Sanghatanists in particular to denounce
this nefarious proposal for Pakistan uncompromisingly and
fundamentally, and asked the people to observe the first week
of August 1944, as the Akhand Hindusthan and Anti-
Pakistan week.

The tussle between the forces of Akhand Hindusthan led
by Savarkar and the disruptive forces led by Jinnah and sup-
ported by Gandhiji and Rajaji aroused keen interest among
political observers abroad. The American papers sought
Savarkar’s views regarding Gandhi-Rajaji proposal. So
Savarkar cabled to the United Press of America, Washington,
that the Hindu Mahasabha, the All-India representative body
of the Hindus, condemned emphatically Gandhiji’s proposal to
vivisect India allowing the Muslims to form separate inde-
pendent States, and added that the Hindu Mahasabhedtes
would never tolerate the breaking up of the unity of India,
their Fatherland and Holyland.^ The same message was cabled
by Savarkar to Mr. L. S. Amery, the then Secretary of State
for India. The political situation was worsening. Meetings
supporting Rajaji’s proposal at many places ended in pande-
monium, huge demonstrations were held against his formula
and dissatisfaction against it was expressed on a country-wide
scale.

After a few days, as arranged between Gandhiji and Jinnah,
the Pakistani special train guarded by the Khaksar Muslim
Volunteers and protected by British soldiers who “ happened ”
to travel in the same train, left Wardha for Bombay with
Gandhiji inside. The nationalist opposition to him was
demonstrated all the way. At several stations, black flag
demonstrations were staged by Hindu Sanghatanists and other
nationalists. And lo ! On his arrival in Bombay, Gandhiji
and his commercialised press appealed to the cotmtry to
observe restraint and the people were asked to pray for the

FIGHT FOR AKHAHD HINDUSTHAN 325

success of the very talks which were dangerous to the unity
and integrity of India. Organs like the Times of India,
Bombay, that change their minds with the change of their
ma.sters, went a long way in welcoming the readiness on
Gandhiji’s part to concede the principle of Pakistan as ‘ a
constructive contribution towards the Congress-League settle-
ment ’ though the proposal was an avowedly destructive
contribution to the Indian nation and to the integrity of India.

Throughout this period Savarkar went on doing his duty
of cautioning the nation against the tragedy. In a statement
then issued he drew the at tn ion of the people to the sins and
grievous political errors Gandhiji and the Congress were
committing, and referred rather indignantly amid a bitter
atmosphere to the part Gandhiji was playing : “ The mono-
maniacal fit can hardly go further ; nor sin could be darker.
But the darkest sin of vivisection of our Motherland and Holy-
land is still going to crown his political career, and all this in
the name of non-violence, truth and God ! ” ^

Even with the strong opposition the nation demonstrated to
his formula, Rajaji was audacious enough to say that he found
almost all important sections of the Indian people ready to
support his Pakistani proposal except the Hindu Mahasabha
which was determined to offer uncompromising opposition.
He acknowledged publicly that the first spark of patriotism
was lit in him in his youthful days by reading Savarkar 's
famous book. The Indian War of Independence of 1857.
Rajaji further referred to Savarkar’s attitude to his formula
and said : “ Mr. Savarkar has stated that it is the duty of
every Hindu Sanghatanist to denounce the proposals.
Mr. Savarkar may thus define the duty of the Hindu Sangha-
tanists, but what about the duty of the Indian Sanghatanists
whose aim is to be free and not only to be organized against
the Muslims ? ” In his scathing and telling retort, Savarkar
said : “ This was a case of Rajaji against Rajaji.” He added
that Rajaji would bear witness to the undeniable truth that
he who ushered the word Independence in poHtical currency
for the first time in the recent history of India by proclaiming
absolute political Independence of India, rose in revolt and in-
vested the question of Indian Independence with international

326 SAVARKAR AND HIS TIMES

importance, must be knowing at least something of what that
Independence, freedom, and Indian Sanghatan really im-
plied ! ” Savarkar proceeded in his master hit : “ I do not know
whether Rajaji’s acquaintance with Sanskrit is on a par with
that of Sir Tej Bahadur Sapru, the knight-errant, who is now
out to prove that the Arabianized and Persianized Urdu
Language and the Urdu script are better entitled to be the
national Language and national script of the Hindus than
Sanskritized Hindi. But Rajaji is after all born in an
Acharya family ; it would not be far from truth if I presume
that he must be knowing this much that the word Sanghatan
means pre-eminently consolidation, integi’ation, and unifica-
tion and can never mean disintegration, dislocation, vivisec-
tion or decentralisation.” He further asked Rajaji whether
the latter who supported the principle of vivisection of India
was an Indian Sanghatanist or those who opposed vivisection,
and disintegration were Indian Sanghatanists ? Who could
claim to be Indian Sanghatanists ? Tliose who led a butcher’s
knife at the neck of the Motherland or those who wanted to
ward off the murderous attack ? Never did Rajaji dare look at
Savarkar again through the press. So smashing was the hit —
a Savarkarian stroke, telling and crushing !

The talks of Gandhi ji with Jinnah in the palatial building
of Jinnah at Mount Pleasant Road, Bombay, lasted for about
three long weeks in September 1944. Jinnah was stubborn
but shrewd, ruthless but realist in his own way in his demand
for the vivisection of India. The underlining theme of
Gandhiji’s arguments was that the British Government should
be ousted first and then the right of self-determination would
be given to the Muslims. Jinnah insisted that the settlement
between the Hindus and Muslims should be first made.
Gandhiji clearly agreed to the principle of Partition as be-
tween brothers and promised that though he differed from
Jinnah on the general basis, he would recommend to the
Congress and the country the acceptance of the claim for
separation as contained in the Muslim League resolution of
Lahore of 1940. In a letter to Jinnah, Gandhiji said : “ If the
vote is in favour of separation, it shall be agreed that those
areas shall form a separate State as soon as possible after
India is free from foreign domination and can therefore be



FIGHT FOR AKHAND HINDUSTHAN 327

constituted into two Sovereign Independent States.” Lastly,
Gandhiji said : “ The League will however be free to remain
out of any direct action to which the Congress may resort and
in which the League may not be willing to participate.”

Thus the Muslim participation in the freedom struggle was
nowhere guaranteed ; but the partition of India was guaran-
teed by Gandhiji to Jinnah ! Gandhiji paid nineteen visits to
Jinnah’s house without receiving a single in return, even
observed his ‘ Mondays ’ on Sundays to facilitate the progress
of the talks and returned ith an unpleasant face from Mount
Pleasant. The master diplomat in Jinnah knew that now the
British Government was required to sign his perfidious plot
against the Indian integrity. Thus Gandhiji, who had
regarded Pakistan as a sin, a patent untruth, a denial of God,
and the undoing of the work of a good many ancestors agreed
to lay the axe at the root of Hindusthan and to cut off the
holiest part of India for the mere asking of the Muslims !

Savarkar’s heart was torn with anxiety ; his anguish was
unimaginable. A true son of India, he was grappling to save
the neck of his Motherland from the knife of the butchers,
fighting against the colossal betrayal by great leaders, against
the long purses of the multi-millionaires who sided with those
leaders and the great guilty press that saw the treachery
being enacted, but shed no tears, not to speak of offering any
opposition to it. Savarkar shouted : “ Hark countrymen, the
Indian National Congress, which was ushered into existence
to consolidate the Indian Nation, has itself betrayed its sole
mission, the very justification of its existence and falling a
victim to the pseudo-nationalistic malady, has dealt the un-
kindest cut of all at the Indian national integrity.” The
keeper turned verily a poacher ! As balanced a statesman as
Sri Srinivas Sastri said that it was impossible for a genuine
nationalist to remain tongue-tied while the integrity of our
Motherland was being bartered !

To all sensible politicians and the national-minded people in
general who publicly protested against the Pakistani proposal,
Savarkar fervently appealed in a statement to organize a
whirlwind protest against the sinful Congress designs to break
up the integrity of Hindusthan, and not to remain tongue-tied
without raising a single word of protest against the political



328 SAVARKAR AND HIS TIMES

matricide of their Motherland. As a counter-move to the
Gandhi-Rajaji formula Savarkar contemplated to hold an
Akhand Hindusthan Leaders’ Conference on the 7 th and tUh
of October 1944. He invited all those leaders to the Conference
who had taken up a definite attitude to oppose any efforts
aimed at breaking up the integrity of Hindusthan as a Nation
and a State on any grounds whatsoever, whether religious,
cultural, linguistic or economic.

The Akhand Hindusthan Leaders ’ Conference was held
accordingly on the 7th and 8th of October 1944, at New Delhi as
scheduled. More than three hundred leaders including Master
Tara Singh from the Punjab attended the Conference. His
Holiness Sri Shankaracharya of Puri was also present and
blessed the Conference in a dignified Sanskrit speech. The
Hon. Sir Jogendra Singh, Member for Education, the Hon.
Dr. N. B. Khare, Commonwealth Relations Member of the
Government of India, were also present. Inaugurating the
Conference, Sri Jamnadas Mehta, denounced the concept of
Pakistan and asserted in his briUiant style : “ As a Hindu,

I reject it ; as an Indian, I repudiate it, and as an inter-
nationalist, I repel it.” Mehta further called for an
unrelenting war on the enemies of Hindusthan which he said,
were the British imperialism, Muslim fanaticism. Congress
wobblings and our own apathy. In his brief brilhant speech,
Savarkar explained the object of the Conference and dwelt
on its representative character. He hoped that there would
be no difference of opinion on the main resolution.

Dr. Radha Kumud Mookerji, a renowned authority on
Indian History and Politics, presided over the Conference,
and in his Presidential Address said : “ A crisis of the first
magnitude has been created in our national history by some
great leaders who have convinced themselves that it is impos-
sible for our Mother Country to attain her independence and
the status which is her birth-right except on the basis of
Hindu-Muslim Unity.” ^ He lamented the misreading of the
national history and politics on their part and asserted that
the Homeland of the Hindus through millenniums of their
history had been nothing short of the whole of India. The
man of vast erudition further said that Pakistan was a totally

FIGHT FOR AKHAND HINDUSTHAN 329

unacceptable scheme as a solution of the communal problem,
as it sought to solve it at the cost of the unity of the Mother
Coimtry.

Master Tara Singh declared at the Conference that the
Sikhs were the gatekeepers of India. He said that he had
not come to lend support, but to seek support for the Sikh
determination to guard the Frontiers of Akhand Hindusthan,
and sounded a warning that even if the majority of the Hindus
agreed to Pakistan, they ’ '•d no right to force it upon the
Sikhs. Seveial other leaci* r? from Bengal, Assam, Madras,
Jaipur, Meerut, Barreillj a’ d Poona supported the main
resolution which unambiguously declared its unflinching
faith in the oneness and integrity of India and its firm con-
viction that the partition of India would be fatal to the best
interests of the country as a whole and to every community.

Among the three hundred sympathetic messages received,
those from Sri Srinivas Sastri, Sir R. P. Paranjpe and Sri
Ramrao Deshmukh exhorted the Hindus to value the interests
of the country more than those of a passing political party
and wished success for the Conference.

The Conference ended in a great enthusiasm and a deter-
mination of the nationalists to oppose Pakistan. This was the
greatest demonstration of the nationalist opposition to the
scheme of Pakistan during this period.

In August 1944, Dr. Mookerjee visited Poona. Savarkar
appreciated his “ recent condemnation of Provincial self-
determination ” and desired in a telegraphic message to L. B.
Bhopatkar that the crown of thorns of the Presidentship of
the Hindu Mahasabha should be bestowed upon Dr. Mookerjee
next year. In the second week of November 1944, Savarkar
once again announced his irrevocable decision not to accept
the Presidentship of the Hindu Mahasabha any more. Dr.
Moonje, who could read the times with a clear foresight,
appealed personally to Savarkar in all sincerity to reconsider
his decision as he thought that there was no other force but
Savarkar that could avert the coming disaster ! But
Savarkar’s deteriorating health was now unequal to the
strain and task and he told Dr. Moonje that his decision was
irrevocable.



330 SAVARKAR AND HIS TIMES

In the second week of November 1944, Savarkar appealed
to the Viceroy and to the Governor of Sind to lift the ban on
the Satyartha Prakash and added that the proscription of the
Satyartha Prakash was bound to result in a similar demand
for the ban on the Koran all over India. In this connection
he also saw the Viceroy, Lord Wavell, on November 27, 1944.
But the Congress remained still unconcerned in spite of the
suppression of the right of freedom of worship of the Arya
Samajists. Not only that, but the Congressmen remained
neutral when Bhai Parmananda moved an adjournment motion
over the Satyartha Prakash ban in the Central Assembly and
the motion failed for want of support !

Towards the end of the year the Hindu Mahasabha held
its annual Session at Bilaspur. Savarkar inaugurated this
session over which Dr. Shyama Prasad Mookerjee presided.
In his brilliant and succinct address Dr. Mookerjee put
before the people Savarkarism in a modified form although
couched in the style of a brilliant university professor ! The
main features of the Session were the elucidation of the
economic policy of the Hindu Mahasabha and the adoption
of a draft of the Future Constitution of India prepared by
the Gokhale Committee and which was moved by Sri
L. B. Bhopatkar.

At Bilaspur Savarkar also presided over the Satyartha
Prakash Conference at the time of the Mahasabha Session and
expressed his righteous indignation by declaring that had
there been Hindu Sanghatanist ministries in all other pro-
vinces, the Koran would have been instantly banned till the
Satyartha Prakash was fully restored in Sind.

n

The year 1945 was a turning point in Savarkar’s life in
many respects. Owing to a serious breakdown in his
health, his constitution that stood the hardships of the
Deathland, the strain of the social work in Ratnagiri and
since 1937 the whirlwind propaganda from one end of
Hindusthan to the other, was now refusing to stand the strain
of active political life any more.

In the month of March 1945, Savarkar suffered a great



FIGHT FOR AKHAND HINDUSTHAN 331

bereavement. His elder brother Ganeshpant alias Babarao
Savarkar passed away at Sangli after a prolonged and painful
illness. Savarkar’s lifelong trusted elderly counsel, com-
patriot and heroic brother thus passed away. No brothers in
modern politics stood by their brother through thick and thin
as did Babarao Savarkar and Dr. N. D. Savarkar loyally stand
through fire and water by their beloved brother, Tatya. India’s
pioneer devotee of revolution, Babarao Savarkar was a patriot
of heroic enduring, endless sacrifice and silent selfless service.
The younger brother. Dr. Narayanrao Savarkar, attended the
sickbed of Babarao at Sangli. Savarkar had seen the ailing
brother a few days before the latter’s death. His distant stay
made him write in his anxious moments letters to his brother
who was on his death-bed. Savarkar wrote to his dying
brother : “ Our life work (i.e. the work of the three brothers)
was one. In our generation we have tried to repay our
spiritual debt to our forefathers. No historian of modern
Hindusthan will fail to write in golden letters one separate
chapter. Our political opponents have familiarized the title
of that chapter as the Savarkar Epoch. By giving the
countrymen two battle cries, “ Victory to the Goddess of
Liberty ” and “ Hindusthan belongs to the Hindus,” we have
thus been instrumental twice in bringing about a fundamental
revolution in the nation’s ideology and active political life.”

“ The Lord of Death, who is now standing by your side, is
meeting you, not like a foe, but like a friend. You have lived
up to your life’s ideal. Never did even once you dream of
abandoning the torch of freedom which in your boyhood you
vowed to hold aloft. Great were your sufferings. Equally
great have been your joys. You have bravely suffered the
hardships of a political prisoner condenmed to a life sentence
in the Andamans. In sufferings as in happiness, never did
you drop down the banner of Revolution.”

The heroic fighter died thinking only of his country’s wel-
fare. An anxious enquiry on his lips an hour or two before
his last breath was about the Communist threat to Nepal !
For, Nepal was his beloved Hindu Kingdom from his boy-
hood. Gandhi wrote a letter offering his condolences to
Savarkar addressed to his Ratnagiri residence which Savarkar
had left eight years ago. Gandhiji could send immediate



332 SAVARKAR AND HIS TIMES

condolence by a telegram to His Exalted Highness the Nizam
of Hyderabad on his mother’s death, but he wrote a letter to
Savarkar and that too to a wrong address. Can this wrong
address on the letter be a mere slip of memory committed
by the unfailing mind of Gandhiji ? Leaders, statesmen and
newspapers from America, England, France, Germany and
Japan knew that the residence of Savarkar was at Bombay.
Be that as it may, Savarkar, however, thanked Shriman
Gandhiji sincerely in fluent Hindi, ending his letter with an
inquiry about the health of Gandhiji. What a geniality of a
wronged soul !

The first quarter of the year 1945 witnessed a historic
event. It was at this juncture that the late Bhulabhai Desai,
the leader of the Congress party in the Central Assembly,
who had seen the Viceroy, Gandhiji and Liaqat Ali during
the early part of the year, made a secret pact with Mr. Liaqat
Ali Khan, the Secretary of the League Party in the Central
Assembly, with the secret consent of the truth-seeker,
Gandhiji, who had always declared that there was no place
for secrecy with him. This treacherous pact surpassed the
Rajaji formula. It agreed to a percentage of fifty-fifty in all
representations for the Hindus and the Muslims. The parity
of the alliance of the Congress with the League in the Central
Assembly now ripened into a reality. Shortly after this Lord
Wavell, the Viceroy, flew to London on March 21, 1945, with
these proposals for the formation of an Interim Government at
the Centre. This was a further loss of Hindu rights. This
pact was also supported by the Sapru Committee’s findings
which were cabled to Lord Wavell in London simultaneously.
There was a race, as it were, of betraying Hindu interests
amongst all the Hindu leaders except the Mahasabha leaders !
Though the Sapru Committee stood for a Union of India as
also for adult franchise and joint electorates, it conceded
parity of representation in the Central Assembly and the
Union Executive between Muslims and Hindus other than
the Scheduled Castes. The Muslims pocketed the proposals of
parity. The British Government as usual accepted the parity,
the worst part of the proposals, and threw away the proviso
for joint electorates ! The Hindu Mahasabha never hoped for
any honourable settlement to come out of it. Dr. Moonje



FIGHT FOR AKHANO HINDUSTHAN 333

warned the Hindus not to expect too much of Wavell’s visit to
London.

Though Savarkar was keeping indifferent health and was
hardly out of his bereavement, he had to direct some impor-
tant features of policy regarding the Hindu States. So in
response to the fervent appeals from the States’ Hindu leaders
like Sri Anand Priya of Baroda, he presided over the All-India
Hindu States Conference at Baroda in April 1945. Then
in the month of May, Savarkar’s only daughter Miss Prabhat
was married at Poona <o Sri Madhavrao Chiplunkar, the
grandson of the brother of Sri Vishnushastri Chiplunkar, the
brilliant colleague of Tilak and eminent essayist of Maha-
rashtra. During his stay at Poona Savarkar addressed the
Hindu Rashtra Dal, — ^now outlawed — ^then a new semi-
volunteer organization aiming at the spread and propagation
of unalloyed Savarkarism for the consolidation and all-out
social and political revolution in conformity with its ideal,
which could not be principally preached in any other
organization.

After a stay of nine weeks in London, Lord WaveU returned
to India in the first week of June with the so-called Wavell
Plan. At one stroke the three-year old deadlock was sought
to be broken by the Viceroy through an announcement. In
his broadcast His Excellency, the Viceroy, said he proposed,
with the full support of His Majesty’s Government, to invite
Indian leaders to take counsel with him with a view to the
formation of a new Executive Council, more representative of
organized political opinion. The proposed new Plan, he
declared, would represent the main communities and would
include an equal proportion of caste-Hindus and Muslims.
There was no reference to the Indian States in the Plan, not
to speak of Indian Independence. The Plan, however, pre-
supposed full co-operation in the war against Japan by the
leaders. Consequently, the erstwhile “ Quit India heroes ”
were released to take part in the Simla Conference without
even a shadow of success in their struggle. The Congress
leaders were ready now to fight for British imperialism
against the Japanese aggression and even against Netaji
Subhas Chandra Bose and his Indian National Army as openly
declared by Pandit Nehru.



334 SAVARKAR AND HIS TIMES

With the blessings of the Mahatma and the betrayal of the
nation sponsored by the Congress, Lord Wavell thus killed the
last hope of democracy in India with his nefarious Plan. The
Muslims who formed only 22 per cent of the total Indian
population were given parity in representation with the caste-
Hindus consisting of 54 per cent of the total Indian population.
Hindus who formed nearly 75 per cent of the total Indian
population were thereby divided between the caste-Hindus
and the Scheduled Classes. The Congress represented the
caste-Hindus through its Muslim President, Maulana Azad.
The Muslims were represented through the League President,
Mr. Jinnah, the parties in the Central Assembly were repre-
sented through the leaders of their parties in the Central
Assembly, and the Premiers of the Provinces were also
invited to attend the Conference. The Sikhs and the Scheduled
Classes were represented by their own leaders. The Hindu
Mahasabha was the only political party that was deliberately
ignored and dropped out of the Simla Conference. Even the
mildest possible leader from the Hindu Mahasabha would not
have stooped to agree to the anti-democratic, anti-progressive
and unjust proposal of parity between the caste-Hindus and
the Muslims.

The Conference met at Simla on June 28, 1945. Within the
first few hours the Simla Conference agreed to the basic
aspect of the Wavell Plan, namely the prosecution of war
against Japan. But weeks of open and private negotiations
thereafter failed to produce an agreement on the personnel
of the Central Government Executive and the Simla Con-
ference ended on the 14th July 1945, keeping on record the
acceptance of the parity between the caste-Hindus and the
Muslims. Thus the Wavell Plan failed according to plan, but
assuring a further gain to the Muslims !

The Working Committee of the Hindu Mahasabha met in
the meantime on the 24th and 25th of June at Poona. At a
mammoth meeting attended by over seventy-five thousand
people on the grounds of the S. P. College, Dr. S. P. Mookerjee
under the presidentship of Savarkar made a very stirring
speech condemning the Wavell Plan. A protest week was
observed from July 1 to July 7, 1945, at the behest of the
Hindu Mahasabha all over India. Accordingly thousands of



FIGHT FOR AKHAND HINDUSTHAH 335

meetings all over India simultaneously condemned the
Wavell Plan as anti-Hindu, anti-national and anti-demo-
cratic ! At a Bombay meeting during the protest week
Dr. Mookerjee, the President of the Hindu Mahasabha,
described the Simla Conference as a combination of
conspirators comprising British imperialists, Muslim Leaguers
and the Congress leaders.

There was a sense of embarrassment and shame in the
general feeling and tone of the public for their nationalist
leaders who had .stooped so low. Some of the Congress
leaders were ashamed ir their heart of hearts for having
supported the anti-national Wavell Plan. They had lost their
face. Their Premiers, Pandit Govind Vallabh Pant and Sri B.
G. Kher, were seized for a time with a feeling of perturbation
at the permanent reduction of the Hindu majority to a
minority and at the elevation of the Muslim minority to the
majority. But their repentant awakening proved to be
abortive and momentary. Perhaps their Mahratta blood must
have boiled at the crushing humiliation meted out to the
national majority of Hindusthan.

Savarkar called the parity between Hindus and Muslims as
a negation of nationalism, and said that to honest thinking
men, it was the pyre of Indian nationalism ! Where was the
man of forward march and progress. Pandit Nehru ? This
defender of democracy, the dreamer of the shape of things
to come. Pandit Nehru, was all the while a party to
this anti-national Wavell Plan. After some time the Congress
leaders and papers, who always held the prestige of their High
Command to be more precious than the interests of the nation
in general, were callous enough to say that the Wavell Plan
was an interim arrangement and so it could be tolerated. This
face-saving argument of the leaders of the Congress evoked
a crushing retort from Dr. Mookerjee who asked the Congress
leaders : “ Can you ever commit an interim suicide ? If

not, then suicide once committed can never be undone ! ”

The country-wide protests against the parity proposals
envisaged by the Wavell Plan were growing daily. The Hindu
Mahasabha intended to launch direct action against the
Wavell Plan. As a first step, eminent Mahasabha leaders like
Sir Gokulchand Narang, Raja Maheswar Dayal and Rai



336 SAVABKAR AND HIS TIMES

Bahadur Harischandra renounced their titles. But unfortun-
ately the Mahasabha President, Dr. S. P. Mookerjee, utterly
failed to turn the boiling opposition to good account and to
launch any direct action in defence of democracy and the
rights of the national majority — the direct action which he
once so much clamoured for inopportunely. Had the Hindu
Mahasabha done this, it would have risen in the eyes of the
public. It was here that the rudder of the ship of the Hindu
Mahasabha broke down and the rudderless ship was swept
down along with the inexperienced and vacillating captain
into the trough of the popular estimation in the election held
soon thereafter.

But the fact that the Hindu Mahasabha was the only
political organization that stood stubbornly against the anti-
national Wavell Plan will be recorded by history. Times
needed a stronger action and efforts than they put in. Their
protests were not powerful enough to bring down the prestige
of the leaders of the Congress which had stooped to the
anti-national, anti-democratic and anti-Hindu parity proposals
as conceived by the Wavell Plan. Mere condemnation could
not crush out the Congress misdeeds at the Simla Conference.
It was thus that what Savarkar had won at Bhaganagar and
Bhagalpur, Mookerjee lost at Simla. The Mahasabha really
missed the bus !

After the failure of the Simla Conference, there were
bickerings among Congressmen for a while. It was rumoured
that Sardar Patel and Pandit Nehru were impatient of the
moves taken by Rajaji and Bhulabhai Desai behind their back
which had led to the proposals of the Wavell Plan. Sardar
Patel was so indignant that at a meeting on the 9th August
in Bombay he thundered : “ If such diplomatic efforts are

repeated, take it from me that I would be out of the Congress.”
But the outcry and indignation was not the white heat, but
a white-wash to save the party from an internal breakdown.

Savarkar was feeling the strain of the continuous whirlwind
propaganda heavily. His health was fast deteriorating. With
great efforts he could attend to important correspondence and
allowed only important interviews in spite of medical advice.
One of the most important interviews that took place in
Augvist 1945 was with the representative of AUama Mishraki,

the Chief of the Khaksars, regarding some scheme the
Khaksars had issued for discussion.

At this time there was a move by some scheming brains in
the Mahasabha to throw open the Hindu Mahasabha to the
non-Hindus. Savarkar advised the Working Committee of
the Hindu Mahasabha that they should keep the Hindu
Mahasabha intact inasmuch as every political question in India
was religious and every religious question was political. He
further strongly affirmed that the Hindu Mahasabha must
continue its mission evei after Hindusthan was politically
free.

During the pendency of the Simla Conference Britain went
to the polls and there was a landslide against the Conservative
party and the Labour party was returned to office on July 10,
1945, with an overwhelming majority in Britain. Almost
simultaneously Japan surrendered to the Allies in the East.
World events moved with an electric rapidity. The Viceroy
of India made a second trip to London in the latter half of
August 1945, and returned to India after the middle of
September 1945, to announce general elections to test the
strength of the political parties, to break the ground for future
political negotiations with the newly elected representatives,
to hammer out a constitution and to negotiate a treaty with
the Constituent Body.

Now all the issues, implications and intentions were to be
clarified. Who represented the Muslims and who represented
the Hindus ? The Congress with its gigantic political
machinery plunged into the election campaign heart and soul.
Supported by the ‘ Pakistan ' purse, the Muslim League also
entered the election arena with ‘ Pakistan or Perish ’ as its
slogan. The Congress manifesto stressed the Quit India
demand and the Congress leaders and the press swore by an
undivided India. The Hindu Mahasabha with its meagre
purse and scanty press entered the field with the slogans
‘ Independence and Integrity of India,’ ‘ By our way lies, O
Hindus, your salvation, Congress way lies your destruction
and ruin.’ The Mahasabha leaders announced with justifica-

338 SAVARKAR AND HIS TIMES

tion that ‘ a vote for the Congress was a vote for Pakistan ! '
Besides scanty press and a scanty purse, there was one more
disadvantage from which the Hindu Mahasabha suffered.
Throughout the election period the Hindu Mahasabha lacked
the iron and dynamic leadership of Savarkar, for he was
bed-ridden and made no move. As regards the Congress, it was
the greatest political party in India, and had ruled over seven
Provinces and had many opportunities to influence people as
rulers. Besides, it had at its disposal a big press, big purses
and big political wholetime machinery employed for the
election campaign.

And on top of it all came the somersaults of the Congres.s
leaders that allured the people. Sardar Patel inspired
confidence in the Hindu electorates by his anti-Pakistan out-
bursts and anti-League speeches. Congress was rapidly
gaining confidence and the Hindu Mahasabha was swiftly
losing its position. In the last week of September 1945, at a
meeting of the All-India Congress Committee in Bombay,
Sardar Patel even demonstratively chastised a Muslim
member, one Mr. Mians, in these wox’ds : “ If you say that the
Muslim League is a nationalist organization, why are you to
be found in the Congress at aU ? Ever since the Congress
abandoned unadulterated nationalism the mischief has grown.
That was when the Congress accepted the separate communal
electorates. There have since then been a series of mistakes.
From minority representation we travelled to the fifty-fifty
parity principle. Now it would never be repeated. Congres.s
will never go to the Muslim League.” What a confession
vindicating Savarkar’s charges against the Congress !

Pandit R. S. Shukla, Prime Minister of C.P. and Berar
declared that if Pakistan was established, Muslims in
Hindusthan would be treated as foreigners ! In Calcutta, at
Deshbandhu Park Pandit Nehru thundered that there could
be no truce with the Muslim League which had always
opposed the Congress struggle. The Muslim League
propaganda railed and rained. Mr. Liaqat Ali, the League
Secretary, said at Delhi, “ The Muslim is a born fighter. He ,
may hesitate to cast a vote for Pakistan, but he would not
hesitate to shed his blood.” Mr. H. S. Suhrawardy, another
League Leader, now notorious for his outrageous unconcern



FIGHT FOR AKHANO HINDUSTHAN 339

at the Hindu deaths in the Calcutta killing, challenged Pandit
Nehru to win a single Muslim seat in the Central or Provincial
Assembly. And his challenge was unfailing, for not a single
Muslim seat was won in the election by the Congress from the
Muslim electorates. In this state, Savarkar persistently sighed
from his sick-bed for Hindu wisdom. Ailing Savarkar said in a
frantic and forlorn appeal to the Hindus that disaster would
overtake India if Congressmen were elected to the Legislatures
on mere promises. But oe Congress had hypnotized the
Hindu masses with the . olen thunders and the borrowed
Mahasabha slogans, and seer.ied to win.

The most unfortunate aspect of the election affair for the
Hindu Mahasabha was that its President, Dr. Mookerjee,
lost his grit and confidence in the nick of time. There was a
sudden breakdown in his health. Pandit Nehru and Sardar
Patel who never showed courtesy of inquiring after Savarkar’s
health even during his serious illness, prepared the ground
for further events when they all ran to Dr. Mookerjee to
enquire after his health. The sudden rush and gush of their
anxiety and interest in the health of Dr. Mookerjee was a
pointer. He gave up the struggle even before he joined the
battle ! What would be the fate of the organization led by
a leader without unbending will and invincible faith ? That
is what exactly happened in the case of the Hindu Mahasabha’s
political life.

In the meanwhile, the question of the I.N.A. men’s trial
came to the forefront. In the first week of December 1945,
Savarkar urged Mr. Attlee, the Prime Minister of Great
Britain, to release all the I.N.A. soldiers without any
humiliating conditions as an act of grace by declaring a
general amnesty in view of the general convention of inter-
national treatment dealt out to war prisoners and in view of
the very deep discontent aroused in the public mind. The
Hindu Mahasabha had also observed an I.N.A. day, but the
Congressmen who had styled the I.N.A. as “ rice soldiers ”
earlier now took their very side, stole a march over the Hindu
Mahasabha, and fully utilized the political sympathy and
energy emanating from the I.N.A. trials for their own party
ends. Savarkar was bed-ridden ; Bhopatkar and Moonje
moved in the affair, but without response.



340 SAVARKAR AND HIS TIMES

The interest taken by top-ranking leaders of the Congress
in the I.N.A. trials may have been with an eye to the elections,
as was evinced from the very ungenerous attitude they
adopted towards the I.N.A. men after they were firmly
installed into power. Similarly, the imflinching oaths taken
by the Congress leaders to stand by united India were shame-
lessly betrayed afterwards and the Hindu Mahasabha slogans
openly adopted as their own by Congress leaders like Sardar
Patel, proved veritable bombshells on the popular support to
the Mahasabha candidates, and the sentinels and defenders of
Akhand Hindusthan were routed in their last ditch. But let
it be recorded here that their heroic failure was more glorious
than the pyrrhic success of the Congress candidates. The
Hindu Mahasabha candidates, like Bhopatkar and Bhai
Parmananda stood unflinchingly at the risk of their lives with
an iron will as the sign-posts warning the Hindus : “ Our

way lies your salvation ; Congress way lies your ruin ! ”

The Hindu Mahasabha was in the end completely wiped out
of the political picture of India, so far as the election results
were concerned. And what about the Congress ? Oh ! it
also met its Waterloo in the fields held by Muslim electorates.
History repeats. The Rajputs fought Maha Rana Pratap for
the Moguls, and they also fought the Mahrattas for the Moguls.
Here the Congress fought the Hindu candidates with terrific
ruthlessness and routed them.

But by securing all the thirty-two Muslim seats in the
Central Assembly, the Muslim League routed all the Congress
Muslim candidates so completely that had not Mr. Asaf Ali
been elected by a joint electorate at Delhi, there would have
been no Muslim left even for adoption purposes for the self-
styled Indian National Congress which boasted of representing
the Muslims also. The victory of the Pakistani forces was so
complete and great that Mr. Jinnah declared in Delhi that his
victory was the victory of a nation and the Leaguers achieved
what Hitler could not. With the Congressmen playing the
role of Chamberlain, his boast held much water.

One more point deserves attention. The Hindu Mahasabha
was the only Hindu Organization that stood by its pledges to
the Hindu Nation through fire and water. What were the
Arya Samajists and the R.S.S. men doing ? Let it be said to



FIGHT FOR AKHAND HINDUSTHAH 341

the credit of the small per cent of those defenders of the Hindu
Nation from these two organizations that they did help the
Hindu candidates far-sightedly enough, but let it also be
recorded that a good many persons from these two great
institutions of Hindu hope and faith kept culpable neutrality
over such a life and death struggle in which the Hindu Nation
was involved, while the majority of them were reported to
have voted for the Congress.

This colossal rout accelerated the deterioration in the health
of Savarkar so much so ’hat in a telegram sent to Sri N. C.
Chatterji he bewailed. “ My nerve system has been literally
shattered for the last two years. It has now collapsed.”
Savarkar now realized from his sick bed the implications of
the success of the Congress in the elections at the hands of the
Hindu electorates. He realized that the battle for Akhand
Hindusthan was almost lost. So great was the nervous
exhaustion that followed from this that at times in his bed he
showed signs of blurred memory and soon on expert medical
advice, he was removed on January 1, 1946, to Walchandnagar
near Poona where the undivided devotion to the Hindu cause
in Seth Gulabchand and his reverential affection for his leader
looked after Savarkar’s health with great care and anxiety.
