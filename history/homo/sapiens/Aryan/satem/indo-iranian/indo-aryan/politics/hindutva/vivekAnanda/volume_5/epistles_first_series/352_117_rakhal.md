## CXVII

(Translated from [Bengali](b8545e5117.pdf) )

GOPAL LAL VILLA,  
BENARES (VARANASI) CANTONMENT,  
*12th February 1902*.

MY DEAR RAKHAL, (Swami Brahmananda.)

I was glad to get all the detailed news from your letter. Regarding
Nivedita's School, I have written to her what I have to say. My opinion
is that she should do what she considers to be best.

Don't ask my opinion on any other matter either. That makes me lose my
temper. Just do that work for me — that is all. Send money, for at
present only a few rupees are left.

Kanai (Nirbhayananda) lives on Mādhukari (Cooked food obtained by
begging from several houses.), does his Japa at the bathing ghat, and
comes and sleeps here at night; Nyedā does a poor man's work and comes
and sleeps here at night. "Uncle"[1](#fn1) and Niranjan have gone to
Agra. I may get their letter today.

Continue doing your work as the Lord guides. Why bother about the
opinion of this man and that? My love to all.

Yours affectionately.  
VIVEKANANDA.
