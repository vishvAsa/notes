> § 1. Halt at Brighu's Ashram
>
>  1. With the desire to pursue other ways, Gautama left Rajagraha to
> meet Arada Kalam.  
>  2. On his way he beheld the hermitage of Brighu, and entered it
> out of curiosity.  
>  3. The Brahmin inmates of the Ashram who had gone outside for the
> sake of fuel, having just come back with their hands full of fuel,
> flowers, and kusa grass, pre-eminent as they were in penances, and
> proficient in wisdom, went just to see him, and went not to their
> cells.  
>  4. Then he, being duly honoured by those dwellers of the
> hermitage, paid his homage to the Elders of the Ashram.  
>  5. He, the wise one, longing for liberation, traversed that
> hermitage, filled with the holy company desirous of heaven,--gazing at
> their strange penances.  
>  6. He, the gentle one, saw for the first time the different kinds
> of penances practised by the ascetics in that sacred grove.  
>  7. Then the Brahmin Brighu, well-versed in the technique of
> penance, told Gautama all the various kinds of penances and the fruits
> thereof.  
>  8. "Uncooked food, growing out of water, and roots and
> fruits,--this is the fare of the saints according to the sacred texts;
> but the different alternatives of penance vary.  
>  9. "Some live like the birds on gleaned corn; others graze on
> grass like the deer,=; others live on air like the snakes, as if
> turned into ant-hills.  
>  10. "Others win their nourishment with great effort from stones;
> others eat corn ground with their own teeth; some, having boiled for
> others, keep for themselves what may chance to be left.  
>  11. "Others, with their tufts of matted hair continually wet with
> water, twice offer oblations to Agni with hymns; others, plunging like
> fishes into the water, dwell there with their bodies scratched by
> tortoises.  
>  12. "By such penances endured for a time,--by the higher they
> attain heaven, by the lower the world of men, by the path of pain they
> eventually dwell in happiness,--pain, they say, is the root of
> merit."  
>  13. On hearing this Gautama said, "Today is my first sight of such
> a hermitage, and I do not understand this rule of penance.  
>  14. "This is all I would say at the moment. This devotion of yours
> is for the sake of heaven--while my desire is that the ills of life on
> earth be probed and a solution found. Will you allow me to take your
> leave? I wish to learn the Sankhya Philosophy and train myself in the
> Samadhi marga, and see what help it can give me for the solution of my
> problem.  
>  15. "There is sorrow to me when I reflect that I shall have to
> depart, leaving you who are thus engaged, you who are such a refuge
> and who have shown such excessive kindness to me,--just as there was
> when I had to leave my kindred behind.  
>  16. "It is not, therefore, any dislike on my part, or the wrong
> conduct of another, which makes me go away from this wood; for ye are
> like great sages, standing fast in the religious duties which are in
> accordance with former sages.  
>  17. "I wish to go to Muni Arada Kalam, who is known to be the
> master of the subject."  
>  18. Seeing his resolve, Brighu, the chief of the hermitage, said,
> " Prince, brave indeed is thy purpose, who, young as thou art, having
> pondered thoroughly between heaven and liberation have \[=having\]
> made up your mind for liberation, ye are indeed brave!  
>  19. "If what you have said is thy settled purpose go quickly to
> Vindhyakoshth ; the Muni Arada lives there, who has gained an insight
> into absolute bliss.  
>  20. "From him thou wilt learn the path; but as I foresee, this
> purpose of thine will go further, after having studied his theory."  
>  21. Gautama thanked him, and having saluted the company of sages
> he departed; the hermits also, having duly performed to him all the
> rites of courtesy, entered again into the ascetic grove.
>
>   
> § 2. Study of Sankhya
>
>  1. Leaving the Ashram of Brighu, Gautama started \[out\] to find
> the abode of Arada Kalam.  
>  2. Arada Kalam was staying at Vaishali. Gautama went thither. On
> reaching Vaishali, he went to his Ashram.  
>  3. Approaching Arada Kalam, he said, "I wish to be initiated into
> your doctrine and discipline."  
>  4. Thereupon Arada Kalam said: "You are welcome. Such is my
> doctrine that an intelligent man like you in no long time may of
> himself comprehend, realise and attain my teaching and abide by it.  
>  5. "Verily thou art a worthy vessel to receive this highest
> training."  
>  6. The prince, having heard these words of Arada, was filled with
> great pleasure and thus made reply.  
>  7. "This extreme kindliness which thou showest to me, makes me,
> imperfect as I am, seem even already to have attained perfection.  
>  8. "Will you, therefore, deign to tell me what your doctrine
> is?"  
>  9. Said Arada, "I am so much impelled by your noble nature, by
> your sincerity of character, and by your resolution, that I need not
> put you to any preliminary examination to test your worthiness.  
>  10. "Listen, best of listeners, to our tenets."  
>  11. He then expounded to Gautama the tenets of what was known as
> the Sankhya Philosophy.  
>  12. At the conclusion of his discourse Arada Kalam said:  
>  13. "These are, O Gautama, the tenets of our system. I have told
> them to you in a summary form."  
>  14. Gautama was greatly pleased with the clear exposition given by
> Arada Kalam.
>
>   
> § 3. Training in Samadhi Marga
>
>  1. At the time when Gautama was examining the various ways of
> finding a solution to his problem, he thought of getting himself
> acquainted with the Dhyana Marga (Concentration of the Mind).  
>  2. There were *three* schools of the Dhyana Marga.  
>  3. All of them had one thing in common, namely, that control of
> breathing was the means of achieving Dhyana.  
>  4. One school followed a way of controlling breathing which is
> called *Anapanasati*.  
>  5. Another school followed the way of control of breathing known
> as *Pranayama*. It divided the breathing process into three parts: (1)
> Breathing *in* (Puraka); (2) *holding* the breath (Kumbhaka); and (3)
> breathing *out* (Rechak). The third school was known as Samadhi
> School.  
>  6. Arada Kalam was well known as the master of Dhyana Marga.
> Gautama felt that it might be well for him if he could get some
> training in the Dhyana Marga under Arada Kalam.  
>  7. So he spoke to Arada Kalam and asked him if he would be so good
> as to give training in the Dhyana Marga.  
>  8. Arada Kalam replied, "With great pleasure."  
>  9. Arada Kalam taught him his technique of the Dhyana Marga. It
> consisted of seven stages.  
>  10. Gautama practised the technique every day.  
>  11. After acquiring complete mastery over it, Gautama asked Arada
> Kalam if there was anything further to be learned.  
>  12. Arada Kalam replied, "No friend, that is all that I have to
> teach." With this, Gautama took leave of Arada Kalam.  
>  13. Gautama had heard of another yogi, by name Uddaka Ramaputta,
> who was reputed to have devised a technique which enabled a Dhyani to
> go one stage higher than that devised by Arada Kalam.  
>  14. Gautama thought of learning his technique, and experiencing
> the highest stage of Samadhi. Accordingly he went to the Ashram of
> Uddaka Ramaputta, and placed himself under his training.  
>  15. Within a short time did Gautama master the technique of
> Uddaka's eighth stage. After having perfected himself in the technique
> of Uddaka Rama-putta, Gautama asked him the same question which he had
> asked Arada Kalam, "Is there anything further to be learned?"  
>  16. And Uddaka Ramaputta gave the same reply, "No, friend, there
> is nothing more that I can teach you."  
>  17. Arada Kalam and Uddaka Ramaputta were famous for their mastery
> of Dhyana Marga in the country of the Kosalas. But Gautama had heard
> that there were similar masters of Dhyana Marga in the country of the
> Magadhas. He thought he should have a training in their system also.  
>  18. Gautama accordingly went to Magadha.  
>  19. He found that their technique of Dhyana Marga, though based on
> control of breathing, was different from what was in vogue in the
> Kosala country.  
>  20. The technique was not to breathe, but to reach concentration
> by stopping breathing.  
>  21. Gautama learned this technique. When he tried concentration by
> stopping breathing, he found that piercing sounds used to come out of
> his ears, and his head appeared to him to be pierced as though by a
> sharp pointed knife.  
>  22. It was a painful process. But Gautama did not fail to master
> it.  
>  23. Such was his training in the Samadhi Marga.
>
>   
> § 4. Trial of Asceticism
>
>  1. Gautama had given a trial to the Sankhya and Samadhi Marga. But
> he had left the Ashram of the Brighus without giving a trial to
> Asceticism.  
>  2. He felt he should give it a trial and gain experience for
> himself, so that he could speak authoritatively about it.  
>  3. Accordingly Gautama went to the town of Gaya. From there he
> reconnoitred the surrounding country and fixed his habitation at
> Uruvela, in the hermitage of Negari, the Royal Seer of Gaya, for
> practising asceticism. It was a lonely and solitary place on the banks
> of the river Nairanjana for practising asceticism.  
>  4. At Uruvela he found the five Parivrajakas whom he had met at
> Rajagraha, and who had brought news of peace. They too were practising
> asceticism.  
>  5. The mendicants saw him there and approached him, to take them
> with him. Gautama agreed.  
>  6. Thereon they served him reverently, abiding as pupils under his
> orders, and were humble and compliant.  
>  7. The austerities and self-mortification practised by Gautama
> were of the severest sort.  
>  8. Sometimes he visited two but not more than seven houses a day,
> and took at each only two but not more than seven morsels.  
>  9. He lived on a single saucer of food a day, but not more than
> seven saucers.  
>  10. Sometimes he had but one meal a day, or one every two days,
> and so on, up to once every seven days, or only once a fortnight, on a
> rigid scale of rationing.  
>  11. As he advanced in the practice of asceticism, his sole diet
> was herbs gathered green, or the grain of wild millets and paddy, or
> snippets \[of?\] hide, or water-plants, or the red powder round
> rice-grains within the husk, or the discarded scum of rice on the
> boil, or the flour of oilseeds.  
>  12. He lived on wild roots and fruit, or on windfalls only.  
>  13. His raiment was of hemp, or hempen mixture of cerements of
> rags from the dust-heap, of bark, of the black antelope's pelt either
> whole or split down the middle, of grass, of strips of bark or wood,
> hair of men or animals woven into a blanket, or of owl's wings.  
>  14. He plucked out the hair of his head and the hair of his beard,
> never quitted the upright for the sitting posture, squatted and never
> rose up, moving only squatting.  
>  15. After this wise, in diverse fashions, be lived to torment and
> to torture his body--to such a length in asceticism did he go.  
>  16. To such a length in loathliness did he go that there became
> accumulated on his body the dirt and filth for years, till it dropped
> off by itself.  
>  17. He took up his abode in the awesome depths of the forest,
> depths so awesome that it was reputed that none but the senseless
> could venture without his hair standing on end.  
>  18. When the cold season brought chill wintry nights, then it was
> that in the dark half of the months he dwelt by night in the open air
> and in the dark thicket by day.  
>  19. But when there came the last broiling month of summer before
> the rains, he made his dwelling under the baking sun by day and in the
> stifling thicket by night.  
>  20. In a charnel ground did he lay down, with charred bones for
> pillow.  
>  21. Thereafter Gautama lived on a single bean a day--on a single
> sesamum seed a day--or a single grain of rice a day.  
>  22. When he was living on a single fruit a day, his body grew
> emaciated in the extreme.  
>  23. If he sought to feel his belly, it was his backbone which he
> found in his grasp; if he sought to feel his backbone, he found
> himself grasping his belly, so closely did his belly cleave to his
> backbone, and all because he ate so little.
>
>   
> § 5. Abandonment of Asceticism
>
>  1. The austerities and mortification practised by Gautama were of
> the severest sort. They lasted for a long period of six years.  
>  2. At the end of six years his body had become so weak that he was
> quite unable to move.  
>  3. Yet he had seen no new light, and was no nearer to the solution
> to the problem of misery in the world on which his mind was centred.  
>  4. He reflected to himself, "This is not the way, even to
> passionlessness, nor to perfect knowledge, nor to liberation.  
>  5. "Some undergo misery for the sake of this world, others meet
> toil for the sake of heaven; all living beings, wretched through hope
> and always missing their aim, fall certainly for the sake of happiness
> into misery.  
>  6. "Has not something like this happened to me?  
>  7. "It is not the effort itself which I blame,--which flinging
> aside the base pursues a high path of its own.  
>  8. "What I ask is, 'Can the mortification of the body be called
> religion?'  
>  9. "Since it is only by the mind's authority that the body either
> acts or ceases to act, therefore to control the thought is alone
> befitting--without thought the body is like a dog.  
>  10. "If there was only the body to be considered, merit may
> \[=might\] be gained by purity of food, but then there is merit also
> in the doer. But of what good is it?  
>  11. "New light cannot be attained by him who has lost his strength
> and is wearied with hunger, thirst, and fatigue, with his mind no
> longer self-possessed through fatigue.  
>  12. "How could he who is not absolutely calm, reach the end which
> is to be attained by his mind?  
>  13. "True calm and the self-possession of the mind is properly
> obtained by the constant satisfaction of the body's wants."  
>  14. At this time there lived at Uruvela a house-holder, by name
> Senani. Sujata was his daughter.  
>  15. Sujata had uttered a wish to a Banyan Tree, and vowed a yearly
> offering to it, if she should have a son.  
>  16. The wish having been fulfilled, she sent her maid Punna to
> prepare the place for the offering.  
>  17. Punna, finding Gautama sitting beneath the Banyan Tree,
> thought he was the god of the tree who had come down.  
>  18. Sujata came and offered Gautama the food prepared by her, in a
> golden bowl.  
>  19. He took the bowl to the river bank, bathed at a ford or a
> bathing place called Suppatitthita, and ate the food.  
>  20. Thus ended his trial of asceticism.  
>  21. The five ascetics who were with Gautama became angry with him
> for having given up the life of austerity and self-mortification, and
> in disgust left him.
