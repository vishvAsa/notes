### (*New York Times* February 24, 1895)  Vivekananda Will Lecture Monday

The Sunday evening addresses delivered in Brooklyn by the eloquent Hindu
monk, Swami Vivekananda, have aroused such interest that a desire to
hear him on some other evening has been expressed. A new lecture by this
gifted writer and speaker will be delivered on Monday evening, Feb 25,
at the Long Island Historical Hall, Pierrepont and Clinton Streets.

The lecture will be for the joint benefit of the Swami Vivekananda
Educational Work, the Publication Fund of the Brooklyn Ethical
Association, and the Educational Work of the Froebel Society.
