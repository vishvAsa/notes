is indeed wonderful. The move is quite original, and never was the life
of a great Teacher brought before the public untarnished by the writer's
mind, as you are presenting this one. The language also is beyond all
praise, so fresh, so pointed, and withal so plain and easy.

I cannot express in adequate terms how I have enjoyed the leaflets. I am
really in a transport when I read them. Strange, isn't it? Our Teacher
and Lord was so original, and each one of us will have to be original or
nothing. I now understand why none of us attempted his life before. It
has been reserved for you, this great work. He is with you evidently.

With all love and NamaskƒÅra,

VIVEKANANDA.

PS. The Socratic dialogues are Plato all over; you are entirely hidden.
Moreover, the dramatic part is infinitely beautiful. Everybody likes it
here and in the West.
