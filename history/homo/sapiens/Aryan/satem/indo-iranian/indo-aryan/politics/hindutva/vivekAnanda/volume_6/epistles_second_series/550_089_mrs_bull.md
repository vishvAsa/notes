## LXXXIX

228 W. 39TH STREET, NEW YORK,  
*10th Dec., 1895*.

DEAR MRS. BULL,

I have received the Secretary's letter and will be glad to lecture
before the Harvard Philosophical Club as requested. The difficulty in
the way is: I have begun to write in earnest, as I want to finish some
text-books to form the basis of work when I am gone. I have to hurry
through four little books before I go.

This month, notices are out for the four Sunday lectures. The lectures
for the first week of February in Brooklyn are being arranged by Dr.
Janes and others. 

Yours, with best wishes,

VIVEKANANDA.
