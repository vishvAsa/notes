## CIII

63 ST. GEORGE'S ROAD, LONDON S.W.,  
*8th July, 1896*.

DEAR MRS. BULL,

 

The English people are very generous. In three minutes' time the other
evening, my class raised £150 for the new quarters for next autumn's
work. They would have given £500 on the spot if wanted, but we want to
go slow, and not rush into expense. There will be many hands here to
carry on the work, and they understand a bit of renunciation, here — the
deep English character.

Yours with best wishes,

VIVEKANANDA.
