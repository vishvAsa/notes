title = "02 THE CULMINATING OFFERING IN THE SACRIFICIAL FIRE"

+++

ON the 20th of June, 1858, in the fierce fight on the maidan at Gwalior, Ranee Lakshmi Bai of Jhansi fell. But though one inveterate enemy of the English was thus taken away from the scene, the other, equally inveterate and, perhaps, more skilful in the tactics of war, had effected a clever retreat. He disappeared from Gwalior on the 20th, he disappeared, also, from the field of Jaura Alipur on the 22nd, and away he went out to the reach of the English – but where? In a few days, all over central India, forests, cities, caves, villages, mountains, and rivers, reverberated with a terrible war-cry, and jubiliant shouts of “Tatia Tope, Tatia Tope!” 

For the Mahratta tiger, chased by the lances of the hunters, had now rushed into the forests of Central India. He had, as it were, lost his right hand by the death of Lakshmi Bai on the field of Gwalior. The Revolution was almost crushed by numerous defeats. He was now separated for ever from Nana Sahib. English power, through Indian strength, had now almost become invincible. He had now no army worth the name, no guns, no provisions, and not even any hopes for getting these anywhere! Still the undaunted Tatia Tope, harassing the enemy, and maddening Defeat itself, would not surrender the Jaripatka at the feet of the foreigner. Bend it before the foreigner, never! Such is the tree from which its staff is made that it might be broken by foreigners but it would hever bend before them! 

After the defeats of Gwalior and Jaura Alipur, Tatia Tope and Rao Sahib Peshwa took the remnants of the army and marched to a place called Sarmathura. They based all their future operations on three important principles. First, they were to try not to get entangled into any battle whatsoever with the English army. Secondly, they decided to make guerilla 

raids in the unguarded provinces. But these two stratagems would be impossible unless some means could be devised to insure a supply of provisions and good arms. So, to obtain these, the third rule of Tatia was to levy contributions of provisions, money, and arms, wherever an Indian state was to be found. In northern and central India, there are Indian states at almost every step. They had accumulated, in the course of years, huge stores of provisions and arms. And it was the duty of the kings there to use these stores for the protection of the country. But in 1857 these kings disregarded the earnest requests and entreaties of the country and their own subjects. They would not openly join the Revolutionaries, because they were possessed by the sinful motive of looking to their own personal and individual gain. Was the Swadeshi army to starve while these selfish states had hoarded provisions lying uselessly in their stores? To remedy such a tragic state of affairs, Tatia Tope and Rao Sahib hit upon the marvellous and just plan of snatching away from these unfaithful custodians, the means that were necessary for the defence of the country. This plan would give the Revolution sufficient money, provisions, and arms. Thus, the cost of maintaining the army of defence would not fall on the poor people of the country alone. These weak princes had generally only small armies, which were armies only in name, and even these more often than not sympathised with the Revolutionaries. Therefore, to levy contributions on these kings was not at all a hard task. Since these states are at every step, the army need not be hindered with too much baggage on its marches. The army would have very little baggage to carry and, even if the enemy looted the provisions sometimes, if would not give rise to great inconvenience, as the Revolutionary army could always find an Indian State on its way and make use of the provisions in its stores. For all these advantages, this plan was determined upon the Tatia Tope. If the kings gave provisions, on demand, willingly to the Swadeshi army – and many of them did give them – then, well and good; if they did not, they were forced to give them, that was all. 

On these three principles, therefore, the future operations of Tatia Tope depended; guerilla warfare, never to face the enemy in the open field, and to levy contributions on the Indian States and exact them if they refused. Tatia’s ultimate object was to keep up such marches and cross the Narbada at the most favourable opportunity and thus to bring the Mahratta tiger to its native forests. The object of the English was not only to prevent him from crossing the Narbada, but not even to let him see it. And thus the race began. 

First, Tatia had his eyes on Bharatpur. But, hearing that a strong English army had come there, he suddenly veered round a Jeypore. In the Jeypore Durbar, there were many people belonging to Tatia’s party, and the army and the populace were also on his side. So, Tatia sent his messengers to that Durbar and intimated to his men to be ready. But the English got news of this quickly and an English army immediately marched to Jeypore from Nasirabad. When the Jeypore plan thus fell through, Tatia descended towards the south. Here Colonel Holmes and an army pursued him. Suddenly, Tatia outwitted his pursuers and marched at once on the state of Tonk. The Nabob of the place shut himself up in the town and sent some select sepoys of his with four guns to engage with Tatia outside the walls. Now the battle would have begun, but suddenly the Tonk sepoys began to embrace Tatia’s men in brotherly affection. They also handed over the four guns to Tatia, and in this manner Tatia got new troops, new guns, and fresh provisions, and continued his determined march to the south! 

Tatia came right up to Indragarh and made a halt there. Behind him was Holmes, and on his flank was Roberts coming from Rajputana. At that time, it was raining tremendously and the Chambal was in front. The enemy behind and the unfordable Chambal in front! So, Tatia turned north- east towards Bundi, and after brilliant and strategic marches came up to the province of Neemuch-Nasirabad which had risen in favour of the Revolution. Tatia encamped for rest near a village called Bhilwada. Hearing of this, Roberts came there hurriedly from Sarwargaon and fell on Tatia on 

the 7th of August, 1858. After keeping him back all day, as soon as night fell, Tatia took his army including his guns safely to Kotra, within the dominions of Udaipur. While the army was resting there at night, Tatia went for worship in the temple of Shri Krishna at the famous place of pilgrimage near by, called Nathadwara. He returned to the camp at midnight and heard that the English army had come up close to them in pursuit. He at once gave orders to the army to break the camp and march on. But the army was so tired that the infantry replied blungly, “We cannot march a step till to- morrow morning. Let the cavalry go in front.” Under these circumstances Tatia was obliged to give battle. As soon as it was dawn, Tatia arranged his troops as well as he could under the circumstances. In that battle, on the 14th of August, after some sharp fighting, Tatia’s troops were routed and retreated about fifteen miles, leaving their guns behind. Now again Tatia was without guns, without provisions, and with an elated enemy in hot pursuit! So, avoiding the enemy at his back, he suddenly darted off, again, towards the river Chambal. The English armies followed him not only in his rear and flank but one English commander stood in front at the very banks of the Chambal. But Tatia put some on the wrong scent, eluded some, pushed back some, and thus, by clever marches, he came up to the Chambal and, almost under the nose of the English army waiting there, crossed that river! 

Now it is true that the Chambal was between Tatia and the English pursuing forces. But then, he had no guns, no provisions, no money – and Narbada, he could not yet even think of it! He was thus beset with tremendous difficulties, and therefore he marched straight on Jhalrapattan. On seeing this, the loyal chief of the State took his faithful troops and his big guns and fell upon Tatia. But, as soon as Tatia was in sight the forces of the State began to salaam him as their Malik! Immediately, Tatia took these troops under his command. In Jhalrapattan, he got cavalry horses, waggons, and plenty of provisions. He went there without a single gun and he had now got thirty-two guns! The Rao Sahib Peshwa ordered the Raja to pay twenty- 

five lakhs of Rupees as fine. The Raja pleaded for mercy and, at last, it was agreed that he should pay fifteen lakhs. Tatia was in this place for five days. He distributed pay to the army at the rate of thirty Rupees a month to every cavalry-soldier and twelve to every infantry-man. Afterwards Rao Sahib, Tatia, and the Nabob of Bhanda began to deliberate upon their future plan of action in the south. The chief aim of the Peshwa army was to cross the Narbada and enter the Deccan. To oppose this, the English had woven nets of different armies and were guarding well nigh every outlet. But Tatia had now acquired thirty-two guns, a new army, new provisions and money, and was better prepared to continue the struggle. So he silently whispered to his companions, “Now the next move must be on Indore!” 

This brilliant idea was quite in accordance with Tatia’s daring. With not so much as one regular regiment in his hand, he had created new armies, new crowns, and new kingdoms. To a man of such magical talent, the plan of marching to Indore was not impossible to execute. It is the duty of the chief, Holkar, to help his master, the Peshwa. If he were not to do it willingly, service should be exacted from him by the Peshwa. The Indore army had secretly pledged itself to support Tatia. Even the Indore Durbar was secretly sending invitations to him! Therefore, Tatia decided to play his game. He marched hastily from Pattan towards the south, rushed into Malwa, and appeared suddenly at Rajgarh! 

Now, in pursuit of Tatia, there were marching, from different directions, the English commanders, Roberts, Holmes, Parke, Mitchell, Hope and Lockhart. All of them were thrown into consternation when they heard that Tatia was marching upon Indore. One moved from Mhow; one ran towards Nalkhera; one hesitated whether he should go to Raigarh or not. General Mitchell had just, with infinite difficulty, ascended a hill with his army, whe he saw Tatia just descending on the other side. But the English army was so tired that it could hardly go forth a step further. So it rested for a while; Tatia took advantage of it and continued his march. He was not tired! The next day, Mitchell recommenced the pursuit and at last came upon Tatia. The Revolutionaries were in their turn tired of the marches and prepared to give battle. They numbered at the time about five thousand and had about thirty guns. But the most wonderful thing is that, as soon as about one thousand of the English fell upon them, before even much blood was shed, they began to retreat, leaving their guns behind! It is on such occasions that we notice the difference between the guerilla tactics of Kumar Singh and of Tatia Tope. The latter’s army did not take advantage of the opportunities that came in their way to deviate from the rule of not fighting an open battle with the English. 

Leaving the maidan at Raigarh behind, Tatia’s army entered into the forest on the banks of the river Betwa and came out on the other side, at a place called Siranj. At Siranj, Tatia got four guns again. The English army could not move for some time on account of an excessive fall of rain. And so Tatia got some time to rest his troops. He therefore let his army rest for a week. At the end of the week, he marched again to the north. The town of Isagarh, in the Scindia’s dominions, would not give him any provisions; so, it was taken by assault and Tatia again got eight guns. This was all right, but the Narbada was thus being left further behind. It appeared that the Mahratta lion could not get into his mountain cave on account of the numerous Englis lances blocking his way. While so many English armies are after one man, why talk of the Narbada?10 

10 An English writer says : “Then commenced that marvellous series of retreats which, continued for ten months, seemed to mock at defeat, and made Tatia’s name more familiar to Europe than that of most of our Anglo-Indian generals. The problem before him was not an easy one. He had to keep together an army of beaten Asiatics bound by no tie to his person and bound to each other only by one common hate and one common fear – hate of the Britisher’s name and fear of the British gallows. He had to keep this ill-assorted army in constant motion at a pace which should baffle not only the enemies who pursued him but the enemies who streamed down at right angles to his line of march. He had, while thus urging his half- disciplined host to mad flight, to take some dozen cities, obtain fresh stores, collect new cannon and, above all, induce recruits to join voluntarily a service which promised only incessant flight at sixty miles a day. That he accomplished these ends with the means at his disposal indicates ability of no mean kind. Slightly as we may hold the marauding leader, he was of the class to which Haidar Ali belonged, and, had he carried out the plan attributed to him and penetrated through Nagpur to Madras, he might have been as formidable as his prototype. As it was, the 

Now, the Revolutionaries divided themselves into two parts, one under Tatia and the other under Rao Sahib Peshwa. The two armies marched separately. But they did not give up their old tactics. They often eluded the enemy cleverly, got guns and lost them, fought when it was necessary as at Mangroli and Sindhwaha, retreated in good order after skirmishes, were pursued for miles and escaped successfully; and again the two armies came to-gether at Lalitpur. But, the Narbada was now no nearer. Nay, Tatia and Rao were, now finally, almost in the grip of the enemy. Mitchell from the south, Colonel Liddell and Colonel Meade from the east and the north, Colonel Parke from the west, Roberts from the Chambal – on all sides of Tatia, the enemy was closing round and narrowing the circle. Then, Rao and Tatia had a consultation and came suddenly to Kajuri; but there, too, was an English army. They entered the jungles again and marched northwards up to Talbahat. So, the English thought that at last Tatia had given up the idea of marching to the south. But, from there, Tatia and Rao Sahib suddenly dashed forth, crossed the Betwa, fought a skirmish with the English at Kajuri, and again at Raigarh, and then marched straight to the south, now seen, now unseen. The English were in utter confusion at the audacity of the attempt; they ran in all directions to stop him. But, brushing aside and eluding these armies by extraordinary marches, this Mahratta with the speed of lightning, crossed ghats, forbed rivers, rushed right through forests and pushed straight towards the south! Parke rushed from the flank, Mitchell in the rear and Becher from the front, but still Tatia persisted in his wonderful southward march! There, he has come to the Narbada, he is on the river – and the astonished and dumbfounded world clapped its hand in applause! – Tatia, has, at last, crossed the Narbada! Malleson says: “It is impossible to 

Narbada proved to him what the Channel was to Napoleon. He could accomplish anything except cross the stream ...... These columns, which moved at first as slowly as British columns are accumstomed to move, learnt to march, at last; and some of the later marches of Brigadier Parke and Colonel Napier were equal to half of Tatia’s average rate. Still, he escaped; and though the hot weather and the rains, and the cold weather and the hot weather, again, he was still flying, sometimes with two thousand ‘dispirited’ followers and sometimes with fifteen thousand men!” – From The Friend of India. 

withhold admiration from the pertinenacity with which this scheme was carried out.”11 

At last, a Mahratta prince had entered the Deccan with an army! When it became known that Tatia had crossed the Narbada near Hoshangabad and had arrived near Nagpur, not only in the three presidencies, not only all over India, not only in England, but all over Europe even, all men, including even his enemies, shouted out in applause, “Bravo, Tatia Bravo!” The whole Revolution had changed its colour at once!12 In front of him lay the Nizam’s dominions where he had a powerful party in the Durbar supporting him, on the other side were Poona, Bombay, and the whole of Maharashtra. The Jaripatka in the land of the Mahrattas – who knew what hidden powers might not rise from that Raigarh, from that Pawankhindi, from that Wargaon! The Nizam of Hyderabad, Lord Harris at Madras, Lord Elphinstone at Bombay, and Lord Canning at Calcutta – all were bewildered with astonishment! Such an astonishing feat did Tatia effect in this descent into Maharashtra! But it was only astonishing; for the time had now gone by when it would also have been useful! A year before, this crossing of the Narbada would have had a wonderful effect. Now, in the October of 1858, this wonderful strategy would excite admiration but would not lead to 

11 “Our very remarkable friend, Tatia Tope, is too troublesome and clever an enemy to be admired. Since last June he has kept Central India in a fervour. He has sacked stations, plundered treasuries, emptied arsenals; collected armies, lost them; fought battles, lost them; talen guns from native princes, lost them; taken more, lost them; then, his motions were like forked lightning; and for weeks, he has marched thirty and forty miles a day. He has crossed the Narbada to and fro; he has marched between our columns, behind them, and before them. Ariel was not more subtle, aided by the best stage mechanism. Up mountains, over rivers, through ravines and valleys, amid swamps, on he goes, backwards and forwards, and sideways and zig-zag ways, now falling upon a post-cart and carrying off the Bombay mails, now looting a village, headed and burned, yet evasive as Proteus” – The Times, 17th January 1859. 12 “It was accomplished. The nephew of the man recognised by the Mahrattas as the heir of the last reigning Peshwa was on the Mahratta soil with an army ... The Nizam was loyal. But the times were peculiar.....Indstnaces had occurred before, as in the case of the Scindia of a people revolting against their sovereign when that sovereign acted in the teeth of thenational feeling. It was impossible not to fear lest the army of Tatia should rouse to arms the entire Mahratta population and that the spectacle of a people in arms against the foreigner might act with irresistible force on the people of the Deccan.” _ Malleson’s Indian Mutiny, Vol. V, pages, 239, 240. 

success! The Revolution had by now been crushed in almost all placed. And the terrible bloodshed caused in the fierce struggle which was still fresh before its mind, had made the nation weak and stupid. In spite of this if the people of Nagpur had shown some perseverance, the aspect of the Revolution might have been changed. In the north of India, in village after village, the peasants would voluntarily and gladly give provisions of Tatia'’ men and look upon him with the reverence due to a patriotic hero -–but such was the adverse fate, that, in the country of the Mahrattas themselves, the people were afraid to assist him in his noble mission! What other fruits would the loyalty of the infamous Queen Banka bear? Undaunted, however, by this adverse reception of his marvellous efforts, Tatia stayed there for some time and began to think out the future campaign. 

Immediately, the English armies began to march thither from all directions. The English were at Melghat, Asirgarh was closed to him and so were Gujrat, Khandesh, and Nagpur. The whole south was closed from below, while, from above, from the north, the pursuing armies had now crossed the Narbada and come after him. Still the invincible hero did not lose heart; not only this, but the unbeaten warrior effected more marvellous feats in strategic marching. Keeping in check as far as possible the armies that were now encircling him, looting mails, breaking telegraphs, surprising outposts, Tatia marched straight to the source of the Narbada. Why? He had, now, actually set his heart upon Baroda! All the fords of the Narbada were watched by English armies on both sides of the river. Still, Tatia came to a village, called Kargun, to cross the river there. There he came across the English commandant Major Sunderland. The armies approached and a battle began. In the heat of the battle, Tatia ordered all his guns to be left behind, jumped into the Narbada, and was soon on the other side with his men. On this occasion, Tatia and his men, indeed, performed one of the most wonderful feats ever recorded in the history of warfare, in the rapid marches which they effected. Malleson clearly says, “Now that the guns were lost, his men were able to display that capacity for rapid marching in which the natives of India are unsurpassed, I might almost say unequalled, by any 

troops in the world.” Even in the midst of all this hurry and danger, Tatia continued his march straight towards Baroda. At Baroda, in the Durbar and in the army, the party which completely sided with Nana Sahib’s policy was powerful, and the Gaekwar’s troops were only waiting for Tatia’s arrival to join him openly. Tatia came up to Rajpura, exacted a ransom of money and horses from the chief there and, on the next day, camped in the state of Chhota Udaipur. Baroad now lay only fifty miles off! But there were numerous English armies in hot pursuit trying to capture him. The enemies’ troops used to proceed exactly on the line of his march, and it is most wonderful how he used to escape from their nets. At Chhota Udaipur, Parke came in with Tatia, and so Tatia had to give up the Baroda plan. Leaving the west aside, Tatia with his army marched again to the north and entered the jungles of Vasvara. But now, the Nabob of Banda had taken advantage of the Proclamation of the Queen of England and had laid down his arms. Tatia and Rao Sahib, the two leaders, were caught in a net which could not possible be broken through. On the south there was the Narbada, on the west was Roberts and his army, on the north and east lay the steep and impassable Ghats! If, in such a state, Tatia and Rao had surrendered, who could have blamed them? But glory be to them that even in such a state they did not surrender! An English author, in surprise and admiration, writes : “But, these two men were, in this hour of supreme danger, as cool, as bold, as fertile in resource as at any period of their careers.”13 On the 11th of December, Tatia came out of the jungle, obtained some provisions, from a Killadar and began to march straight on the city of Udaipur! But, immediately several English armies fell upon him. So, he had to give up the design and re-enter the jungle. It seemed now evident that Tatia could not hold out for more than a week at the most and must eventually surrender. So the Revolutionary leaders began to discuss whether it was now necessary to give up the struggle. The place was not a jungle but a veritable cage into 

13 Malleson’s Indian Mutiny, Vol. V, p. 247. 

which the Mahratta tiger had been driven from all sides. Not only were English armies ready on every side, but they were narrowing the cordon every moment. Still Tatia would not think of giving up the fight. He and Rao Sahib one day marched out in the direction of Pratapgarh. It was now about four in the afternoon. Tatia’s army had scarcely come out of the jungle when Major Rocke came up and blocked his way. Not that Tatia did not know that this part of the cage was also barred. But he took his choice and thought that this bar was the least strong of all, and so the tiger at once made an attempt to rush out there. Tatia’s men marched straight on Major Rocke’s troops and silenced them after a sudden onslaught. And thus the cage was broken through once again. The English commandants had to hand down their heads in shame! 

On the 25th of December, 1858, Tatia left the Vasvara jungle. About the same time, Feroze Shah, the illustrious hero whose work in Oudh has been described in a previous chapter, was coming with his army to meet Tatia.14 This Prince Mirza Feroze Shah was a worthy son of the subsequent march up to where Tatia was, cannot be described in detail for want of spare. Advancing to meet Feroze Shah and a Revolutionary Sirdar of the court of the Scindia called Man Singh, Rao Sahib and Tatia after many marches and skirmishes arrived at last at Indragarh on the 13th of January, 1859. And there the four leaders stopped for some time, discussing plans for 

14 “One of the great results that have flowed from the rebellion of 1857-1858 has been to make inhabitants of every part of India acquainted with each other. We have seen the tide of war rolling from Nepal to the borders of Gujarat, from the deserts of Rajputana to the frontiers of the Nizam’s territories, the same men overrunning the whole land of India and giving to their resistance, as it were, a national character. The paltry interests of isolated states, the ignorance which men of one petty principality have laboured under in considering the habits and customs of other principalities – all this has disappeared to make way for a more uniform appreciation of public events throughout India. We may assume that, in the rebellion of 1857, no national spirit was aroused, but we cannot deny that our efforts to put it down have sown the seeds of a new plant and thus laid the foundation for more energetic attempts on the part of the people if, in the course of future years, England has not done something towards reconciling the numerous inconcistencies and suppressing some of the dangerous tendencies of its rule in India.” – The Times, 20th of May, 1859. 

future action. Tatia had always minute and correct information about the movements of the English. Seeing that they were closing round him again on all sides, Tatia arrived by forced marches at Dewasa. Now at last Tatia had not the smallest loophole through which to escape from the hands of the English. He had not even any hope of future success in his heart to encourage him to make another adventurous dash. Napier hemmed him from the north, Showers from the north-west, Somerset from the east, Smith from the south-east, Michel and Benson on the south, Bonner on the south-west and west; - thus, on all sides, he was surrounded by the enemy. Where and how could he with his fatigued men find a means of escape from these and other English forces? The English commandants swore that escape was absolutely impossible. How was it possible for Tatia to break through the net closing around him? It did in very deed seem impossible. The English cords were now tightly round the necks of the four leaders, Feroze Shah, Man Singh, Tatia, and Rao Sahib. It was not impossible to escape! 

At Dewasa, on the morning of the 16th of January, 1859, Tatia, Rao Sahib, and Feroze Shah were discussing plans in a special council of war, when suddenly the last shout of despair was heard! Tatia felt an Englishman’s hand at his back and the English had flooded into the camp. There was a joyous shout on the English side : “Tatia is caught! Tatia is caught!” But soon the cry had to be varied. “Oh! He was here only just now! Run, soldiers, run!” They carried an exhaustive search in each and every corner – but Tatia had disappeared! 

That magician Tatia was to be seen again, together with Rao Sahib and Feroze at the town of Sikhar, near Alwar, on the 21st of January, and English forces were again running madly in pursuit. One of them, Holmes, actually fought a skirmish with the Revolutionaries, who were defeated and pushed back. 

The defeat at Sikhar destroyed not the hope of success of the Revolutionaries – that was gone even long before – but it made any further resistance absolutely impossible. Since the failure of the Baroda plan, after the crossing of the Narbada, Tatia and Rao Sahib had been discussing as to 

whether the guerilla tactics should be modified at last. Now, Tatia took leave of Rao Sahib and the army. He took with him two horses, a pony, two Brahmin cooks, and a man-servant. With these followers, Tatia came up to Sirdar Man Singh of Gwalior who was, at the time, hiding in the Paron jungles. Man Singh said to him, “You did not do well in leaving the army.” Tatia replied, “Let that be for better or for worse I am now going to stay with you. I am tired of continual marching.”15 Hearing that Tatia was now hiding with Man Singh in the jungle, the English now resorted to the plan of capturing through the base, and for them handy, instrument of treachery and deceit, the enemy whom they could not capture in open war. First, they approached Man Singh. They told him that if he would surrender himself and help them in capturing Tatia, they would use their influence with the Scindia and not only have him pardoned but give him the kingdom of Narwar. This Man Singh was of such a base nature that he had before this tried to hand over even his own uncle to the English. The wretched Man, at once, consented and closed with the offer. He saw Tatia and informed him that he was going to surrender to the English. But, even after this, Tatia would not even think of surrender. Feroze Shah had just written to him to return to the camp. Tatia showed the letter to Man Singh and asked him “Shall I then go or remain in this jungle? I will do as you tell me.” The treacherous Man replied, “Wait for some time; I will soon let you know.” Though Tatia knew that Man Singh had surrendered to the English, he reposed full confidence in him. Man added, “Until I return, you can remain in safety where my guide will take you to.” In the place showed by the guide, believing it to be the safest place, Tatia remained for three days. But on the third day, at midnight, the Mahratta tiger, who had hitherto evaded the enemy after fighting innumerable battles and skirmished, marching thousands of miles, and effecting hair-breadth escapes, was, by the treachery of a countryman, made a prisoner. 

15 From Tatia’s Diary. 

For, giving Tatia in charge of guide, the basest-born of men returned to the English; hands were shaken to complete the agreement, and some Sepoys of the Bombay native regiment were sent to accompany Man. Such was the sympathy with Tatia in all Indian hearts that the English could not trust any Indian with him, as a rule. So, they did not even mention Tatia’s name to the Sepoys. The order was simply “to obey Man Singh’s orders and to arrest the suspected person whom he would point out.” With this detachment, Man went his way to the Paron jungle. He had promised Tatia to return in three days to tell him definitely whether he should go to Feroze Shah or not. And, he came at the appointed time, too. At midnight, on the third day, Tatia was asleep in the place pointed out by the guide as the safest. Man came near the place and muttered an order to the Sepoys to rush forth. The Mahratta tiger was sound asleep in that jungle – the “Beman Man’ let loose on him his hounds; Tatia just opened his eyes a little, and at once found himself a prisoner of the English! 

On the 7th of April, 1859, at midnight, Tatia fell into this prison of treachery, and on the next day in the early morning, he was taken to the camp of General Meade at Sipri. Immediately, a court-martial sat and Tatia was charged with waging war against the British Power. On Wednesday, Tatia wrote down his statement in reply. “Whatever I did, I did according to the orders of my master. Until Kalpi, I was under the orders of Nana Sahib, after Kalpi I was under Rao Sahib. Except in just battle, in warfare, neither I not Nana have ever killed in cold blood or hanged any European, man, woman, or child. I do not want to take part in this trial any more.” At the special request of the English, Tatia dictated his reliable, short, and important diary from the beginning to the end of the Revolution. The Munshi wrote it down and it was read out to him. Afterwards, he signed the diary as well as the statement given above in good English letters, “Tatia Tope”. To all questions asked to him, he replied in Hindusthani, in the sense of the diary and the statement. His replies were straight, short, and spirited. If anyone asked him question in English, he would reply coolly in Hindusthani, “Malum nahin,” (I don’t understand). When minor English 

officers were walking about insolently near him, there was a look of indifference and disdain on his face. The inquiry lasted through Wednesday, Thurdsay, and Friday. Crowds of Indians used to come up to see him, but permission was often refused them. Those who were admitted bowed to him with reverence and affection. When the English informed him that his trial was to take place and asked him to collect evidence for his defence, Tatia replied to the officer, “I know full well that, having fought against the British as I have done, I shall have to prepare myself for death. I do not want any court nor do I wish to take any part in the trial;” and raising up his hands loaded with shackles, he continued, “the only hope that I have is to get myself released from these chains either from the mouth of the cannon or from the loop of the gallows! Only one thing I have to ask, and that is, that, my family at Gwalior having had no connection with my actions, you should not take my old father to any task for my deeds. 

On the 18th of April, the farce, called his trial, ended. Tatia was sentenced to death and take to the gallows at about four o’clock in the afternoon. He was taken out of his tent under the guard of the 3rd Bengal Europeans. When Tatia approached the place where the gallows stood, the troops formed an extended square round it. There was a great crowd of Indian infantry, European cavalry, and the spectators. In the country surroinding, Indian villagers were standing up on eminences here and there. Tatia once again made a request that his father should not be persecuted. The charge and the sentence were read, and the Mistri broke the chains round Tatia’s feet. Tatia walked boldly and with a firm step to the gallows and coolly ascended up the ladder. When, as is the custom, the executioners came up to bind Tatia’s hands and feet on the platform, Tatia smiled pleasantly, and said, “These formalities are not necessary.” With these words he himself put forth his head in the noose. The noose tightened, the block rose, and with a jerk..... 

Tatia Tope, the loyal servant of the Peshwas, the hero of 1857, the country’s mortyr, the defender of religion, the proud, the loving, the generous Tatia Tope, was hanging lifeless on the gallows of the English! The gallows became wet with blood and the country became wet with tears! His fault was that he suffered innumerable hardships for the sake of his country’s independence; the baseness of a traitor’s double-dealing was his reward; and the end? – he was hanged on the gallows of the English like a criminal! Tatia! On! Tatia! Why were you ever born in our unfortunate country! Why did you fight for these wretched, stupid, and treacherous people? Tatia, can you see now the tears we shed for you? For the tears of weaklings, your blood! – What a bargain, indeed! 

Seeing Tatia’s body hanging mutilated there, the English heroes of the day turned back in satisfaction at their valour. His bleeding body was left hanging there till sunset. When the surrounding guard was withdrawn, the European spectators rushed forth in a crowd and there was a regular stampede to get hold of a lock of his hair as a souvenir. 

In the sactificial fire of the War of Independence of 1857, this was the last and culminating sacrifice! 

The terrible volcano, which had oepned wide its jaws and had vomited forth in rage a regular torrent of flesh, of blood, of corpses, of lightnings, of thunders, of burning red lava – that volcano then began to close its mouth again; its heated lava began to cool; its sword-tongues re- entered their scabbards; its fiery lightnings, its deafening thunders, its whirl-winds, its terrible movings, and its dread awakenings – all entered again the magicians’ bag and melted away into the invisible air. And the crater closed and green grass began again to grow on the top; cultivation recommenced; furrows were active; peace, safety, and softness reigned. And the surface of the volcano has now become so soft and smiling that nobody does believe that there slumbers a volcano under that surface!
