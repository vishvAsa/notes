> § 1. Devotion of Dhananjanani, a Brahmani
>
>  1. The Blessed Lord had many friends and admirers. Among them was
> Dhananjanani.  
>  2. She was the wife of a Bharadvaja Brahmin. Her husband hated the
> Lord. But Dhananjanani was a devotee of the Lord. Her devotion is
> worthy of mention.  
>  3. The Exalted One was once staying near Rajagraha, in the bamboo
> grove at the Vihara known as the squirrels' feeding ground.  
>  4. Now at that time Dhananjanani, a Brahmani, the wife of a
> certain Brahmin of the Bharadvaja family, was living with her husband
> in Rajagraha.  
>  5. While her husband was a great opponent of the Buddha,
> Dhananjanani was a fervent believer in the Buddha, the Dhamma and the
> Order. She was in the habit of praising the triple gem. Whenever she
> broke out in this way in praise, her husband used to close his ears.  
>  6. On the eve of his giving a great banquet to many
> fellow-Brahmins, he begged her to do what she liked, provided she did
> not offend his guests by her praises of the Buddha.  
>  7. Dhananjanani would give no such undertaking, and he threatened
> to slice her like a plantain with his dagger. She declared herself
> ready to suffer, so she retained her freedom of speech and proceeded
> to pour forth five hundred verses on her theme, so that he surrendered
> unconditionally.  
>  8. Bowl and golden spoon were laid down, and the guests sat down
> for food. While serving the guests, the dominant impulse arose. In the
> midst she turned towards the bamboo grove and uttered the praises of
> the triple gem.  
>  9. The scandalized guests hurried away, spitting out the food
> defiled by the presence of a heretic, and the husband scolded her amid
> the ruins of his feast.  
>  10. And she, while serving the Bharadvaja with his dinner, came
> before him and praised the gem: "Glory to that Exalted One, the
> Arahant, the Buddha Supreme! Glory to the Norm! Glory to the Order!"  
>  11. And when she had so said, the Bharadvaja Brahmin grew angry
> and exclaimed: "There now! You wretch! Must you be singing the praises
> of that shaveling friar at any and every opportunity? Now, wretch,
> will I give that teacher of thine a piece of my mind!"  
>  12. "O Brahmin," replied Dhananjanani, "I know of no one
> throughout the world of gods, Maras, or Brahmas, recluses or brahmins,
> no one human or divine, who could so admonish that Exalted One,
> Arahant, Buddha Supreme. Nevertheless, go thou, Brahmin, and then thou
> wilt know."  
>  13. Then the Bharadvaja, vexed and displeased, went to find the
> Exalted One; and coming into his presence, exchanged with him
> greetings and compliments, friendly and courteous, and sat down at one
> side.  
>  14. So seated, he asked the Exalted One the following questions:
> "What must we slay if we would happy live? What must we slay if we
> could weep no more? What is above all other things, whereof the
> slaughter thou approvest, Gautama?"  
>  15. The Exalted One replied as follows: "Wrath must ye slay if ye
> would happy live; Wrath must ye slay if ye would weep no more. Of
> anger. Brahmin, with its poisoned source, and fevered climax,
> murderously sweet--that is the slaughter by the Ariyans praised. That
> must ye slay in sooth, to weep no more."  
>  16. Realising the excellence of the reply given by the Exalted
> One, the Bharadvaja Brahmin said to him, "Most excellent. Lord, most
> excellent! Just as if a man were to set up that which had been thrown
> down, or were to reveal that which was hidden away, or were to point
> out the right road to him who had gone astray, or were to bring a lamp
> into the darkness, so that those who had eyes could see external
> objects--even so. Lord, has the Lord Gautama shown me his doctrine in
> various ways. I, even I, Lord, betake myself to the Exalted One as my
> refuge, to the Norm, and to the Order. I would leave the world under
> the rule of Gautama; I would take orders."  
>  17. So Dhananjanani was not only a devotee of the Buddha, she made
> her husband also a devotee of the Buddha.
>
>   
> § 2. The Abiding Faith of Visakha
>
>  1. Visakha was born in the city of Bhadiya in the Anga country.  
>  2. Her father was Dhananjaya, and her mother's name was Sumana.  
>  3. Once the Buddha visited Bhadiya with a large company of monks,
> at the invitation of the Brahmin Sela. Visakha, his granddaughter, was
> then seven years old.  
>  4. Visakha, though only seven, expressed to her grandfather
> Mendaka her desire to see the Buddha. Mendaka allowed her to do so,
> and gave her five hundred companions, five hundred slaves, and five
> hundred chariots, that she might visit the Buddha.  
>  5. She stopped the chariot some distance away, and approached the
> Buddha on foot.  
>  6. He preached to her the Dhamma, and she became his lay
> disciple.  
>  7. For the next fortnight, Mendaka invited the Buddha and his
> followers daily to his house, where he fed them,.  
>  8. Later, when at Pasendi's request, Bimbisara sent Dhananjaya to
> live in Kosala, Visakha accompanied her parents and lived in Saketa.  
>  9. Migara, a wealthy citizen of Shravasti, wanted to get his son
> Punnavadhana married. He had sent a few people to find a suitable
> bride.  
>  10. The party in search of a bride happened to come to Shravasti.
> They saw Visakha on her way to the lake to bathe on a feast day.  
>  11. At that moment there was a great shower. Visakha's companions
> ran for shelter. But Visakha did not. She walked at her usual pace and
> reached the spot where the messengers were.  
>  12. They asked her why she did not run for shelter, and so
> preserve her clothes. She answered that she had plenty of clothes, but
> that if she ran she might damage a limb, which she could not replace.
> "Unmarried girls," she said, "are like goods awaiting sale, they must
> not be disfigured."  
>  13. The party, which was already struck by her beauty, was greatly
> impressed by her intelligence. The party offered her a bouquet of
> flowers, which she accepted, as a proposal of marriage.  
>  14. After Visakha returned home, the marriage party followed he,r
> and laid Punnavadhana's suit before Dhananjaya. The proposal was
> accepted, and confirmed by an exchange of letters.  
>  15. When Pasendi heard of it, he offered to accompany Punnavadhana
> to Saketa, as a mark of signal honour. Dhananjaya welcomed the king
> and his retinue, Migara, Punnavadhana, and their followers, with all
> regard, attending personally to all the details of hospitality.  
>  16. Five hundred goldsmiths were engaged to make ornaments for the
> bride. Dhananjaya gave his daughter as dowry, five hundred carts full
> of money, five hundred with vessels of gold and cattle, etc.  
>  17. When the time came for Visakha to leave, Dhananjaya gave her
> ten admonitions, which Migara overheard from the next room. These
> admonitions were: Not to give fire from the house outside; not to take
> into the house fire from without; to give only to those who gave in
> return; not to give to those who did not give in return; to give him
> that gives and to him that gives not; to seat, eat, and eat happily;
> and to tend the fire and to honour the household deities.  
>  18. On the following day Dhananjaya appointed eight householders
> to be sponsors to his daughter, and inquire into any charges that
> might be brought against her.  
>  19. Migara wanted that his daughter-in-law should be seen by the
> public of Shravasti. Visakha entered Shravasti standing in her
> chariot, with the public lining the road on both sides. The public
> showered gifts on her, but these she distributed among the people.  
> a20. Migara was a follower of the Niganthas, and soon after Visakha's
> arrival in his house, he sent for them and told her to minister to
> them. But Visakha, repulsed by their nudity, refused to pay them
> homage.  
>  21. The. Niganthas urged that she should be sent away, but Migara
> bided his time.  
>  22. One day as Migara was eating, while Visakha stood fanning him,
> a monk was seen standing outside the house. Visakha stood aside, that
> Migara might see him. But Migara continued to eat, without noticing
> the monk.  
>  23. Seeing this Visakha said to the monk, "Pass on, sir, my
> father-in-law eats stale fare." Migara was angry and threatened to
> send her away, but at her request the matter was referred to her
> sponsors.  
>  24. They inquired into the several charges brought against her,
> and adjudged her not guilty.  
>  25. Visakha then gave orders that preparations be made for her
> return to her parents. Both Migara and his wife begged for
> forgiveness--which she granted, on condition that he would invite to
> the house the Buddha and his monks.  
>  26. This he did, but, owing to the influence of the Niganthas, he
> left Visakha to entertain them, and only consented to hear the
> Buddha's sermon at the end of the meal, from behind a curtain.  
>  27. He was, however, so convinced by the sermon that he became a
> convert.  
>  28. His gratitude towards Visakha was boundless. Henceforth he
> considered her to be his mother, deserving all the honours due to a
> mother. From this time onward she was called Migarmata.  
>  29. Such was the abiding faith of Visakha.
>
>   
> § 3. The Devotion of Mallika
>
>  1. Once while the Lord was staying at Shravasti in Jeta's grove,
> the darling son of a certain house-holder died, and the loss made the
> father neglect his business and his meals.  
>  2. He was always going to the charnel ground and wailing aloud,
> saying, "Where are you, my son, where are you?"  
>  3. The bereaved father came to the Blessed Lord, and after due
> salutations sat on one side.  
>  4. Seeing that his mind was absolutely vacant, \[that he was\]
> showing no interest in anything, not telling the purpose for which he
> had come, the Blessed Lord, noticing his condition, said, "You are not
> yourself; your mind is all awry."  
>  5. "How could my mind not be awry, sir, when I have lost my
> darling and only son?"  
>  6. "Yes, householder; our dear ones bring sorrow and lamentation,
> pain, suffering, and tribulation?"  
>  7. "Who, sir, can entertain such a view?" said the angry
> householder, "Nay, our dear ones are a joy and happiness to us."  
>  8. And with these words the householder, rejecting the Lord's
> pronouncement, indignantly got up and departed.  
>  9. Hard by, there were a number of gamblers having a game with
> dice; and to them came the householder with his story of how he had
> related his sorrows to the recluse Gautama, how he had been received,
> and how he had indignantly departed.  
>  10. You were quite right, said the gamblers, for our dear ones are
> a source of joy and happiness to us. So the householder felt he had
> got the gamblers on his side.  
>  11. Now all this, in due course, penetrated to the private
> apartments of the palace, where the king told Queen Mallika that her
> recluse Gautama had stated that dear ones bring sorrow and
> lamentation, pain, suffering ,and tribulation.  
>  12. "Well, sir, if the Lord said so, so it is,"  
>  13. "Just as a pupil accepts all his master tells him, saying, 'So
> it is, sir; so it is'--just in the same way Mallika, you accept all
> the recluse Gautama says, with your 'If the Lord said so, so it is';
> away with you and begone!"  
>  14. Then the queen told the Brahmin Nali Dhyan to go to the Lord
> and in her name, to bow his head at the Lord's feet and, after asking
> after his health, to enquire whether he had really said what was
> attributed to him.  
>  15. "And be careful," she added, "to tell me exactly what the Lord
> answers."  
>  16. In obedience to the queen's commands, the Brahmin went off and
> duly asked the Lord whether he had really said so.  
>  17. "Yes, Brahmin; our dear ones do bring sorrow and lamentation,
> pain, suffering, and tribulation. Here is the proof.  
>  18. "Once, here in Shravasti, a woman's mother died, and the
> daughter, crazed and beside herself, went about from street to street,
> from cross-road to crossroad, saying: 'Have you seen my mother? Have
> you seen my mother?'  
>  19. " Another proof is a woman of Shravasti who lost her father--a
> brother--a sister--a son--a daughter--a husband. Crazed and beside
> herself, the woman went about from street to street and from
> cross-road to cross-road, asking if anyone had seen the dear ones she
> had lost.  
>  20. "Another proof is a man of Shravasti who lost his mother--his
> father--a brother--a sister--a son--a daughter--a wife; crazed and
> beside himself, the man went about from street to street and from
> crossroad to cross-road, asking if anyone had seen the dear ones he
> had lost.  
>  21. "Another proof is the woman of Shravasti who visited her
> people's home; and they wanted to take her from her husband and marry
> her to someone else whom she did not like.  
>  22. "She told her husband about it, whereupon he cut her into two
> and then killed himself, so that they might both die together.:  
>  23. All this the Brahmin Nali Dhyan duly reported to the queen.  
>  24. The queen then went to the king and asked, "Are you fond, sir,
> of your only daughter, the princess Vajira?" "Yes, I am," replied the
> king.  
>  25. "If anything happened to your Vajira, would you feel sorry or
> not?" "If anything happened to her, it would make a great difference
> to my life."  
>  26. "Are you fond, sir, of me?" asked Mallika. "Yes, I am."  
>  27. "If anything happened to me, would you feel sorry or would you
> not?" "If anything happened to you, it would make a great difference
> to my life."  
>  28. "Are you fond, sir, of the people of Kasi and Kosala?" "Yes,"
> replied the king. "If anything happened to them would you be sorry or
> not?"  
>  29. "If anything happened to them, it would make great
> difference--how could it be otherwise?"  
>  30. "Did the Blessed Lord say anything different?" "No, Mallika,"
> said the king in repentance.
>
>   
> § 4. The Ardent Wish of a Pregnant Mother
>
>  1. Once when the Lord was staying in the Bhagga country at
> Sumsumara-gira in the Bhesakala grove, in the deer-park there. Prince
> Bodhi's palace, called the Lotus, had just been finished but had not
> as yet been inhabited by recluse, Brahmin or any other person.  
>  2. Said the prince to a young Brahmin named Sankika-putta, "Go to
> the Lord and in my name bow your head at his feet, ask after his
> health, and invite him to be so good as to take his meal with me
> tomorrow and to bring his confraternity with him."  
>  3. The message was delivered to the Lord who, by silence,
> signified acceptance--as was duly reported to the prince.  
>  4. When night had passed, the prince, having ordered an excellent
> meal to be got ready in his palace and a carpeting of white cloth to
> be laid to the foot of the stairs of the Lotus palace, told the young
> Brahmin to announce to the Lord that all was ready.  
>  5. This was done, and early that day the Lord, duly robed and bowl
> in hand, came to the palace where the prince was awaiting him, outside
> the portals.  
>  6. Seeing the Lord approaching, the prince advanced and saluted
> him, and moved in his train towards the palace.  
>  7. At the foot of the stairs the Lord stood still. Said the
> prince, "I beg the Lord to step up on the carpeting; I beg the Blessed
> One to do this,to my abiding weal and welfare." But the Lord kept
> silent.  
>  8. A second time did the prince appeal, and still the Lord kept
> silent. A third time he appealed, and now the Lord looked towards
> Ananda.  
>  9. Ananda understood what the trouble was, and asked that the
> carpeting should be rolled up and removed, for the Lord would not
> tread upon it, as he is \[=was\] looking to those that shall follow
> hereafter.  
>  10. So the prince ordered the carpeting to be rolled up and
> removed, after which he ordered seats to be set out upstairs in the
> palace.  
>  11. The Lord then, proceeding upstairs, sat down on the seat set
> for him, with the confraternity.  
>  12. The prince with his own hand served that excellent meal,
> without stint, to the Lord and the confratemity.  
>  13. The Lord's meal over and done. Prince Bodhi, seating himself
> on a low seat to one side, said to the Lord, "My view, sir, is that
> true weal must be sought not through things pleasant, but through
> things unpleasant."  
>  14. "In days gone by, Prince," said the Blessed One, "I too held
> the same view, in the days before my enlightenment. Time was when
> being quite young, with a wealth of coal-black hair and in all the
> beauty of my early prime, despite the wishes of my parents who wept
> and lamented, I cut off hair and beard, donned the yellow robes, and
> went forth from home to homelessness as a pilgrim. A pilgrim now, in
> quest of the Good and in search for the road to that utter peace which
> is beyond all compare.  
>  15. "Now I hold a different view. If a man knows the Doctrine, he
> will find the destruction of all ills."  
>  16. Said the prince to the Lord, "What a doctrine! What an
> exposition of doctrine! It is so easy to understand."  
>  17. Here the young Brahmin Sankika-putta observed to the prince
> that, though he had testified thus, yet he had not gone on to say that
> he sought as a refuge the Lord and his doctrine and his
> con-fraternity, as he should have.  
>  18. "Say not so, my friend; say not so," said the Prince: "for I
> have heard from the lips of my lady mother, how, when once the Lord
> was staying at Kosambi in the Ghosita pleasance, she, being then
> pregnant, came to the Lord, saluted him, and took a seat to one side,
> saying: 'Be it a boy or be it a girl that I carry in my womb, my child
> unborn seeks refuge with the Lord and his doctrine and his
> confraternity; and I ask the Lord to accept the child as a follower
> who has found an abiding refuge from this time forth while life
> lasts.'  
>  19. "Another time, when the Lord was staying here in this Bhagga
> country at Sumsumara-gira, in the Bhesakala grove, in the deer park
> there, my nurse carried me to the Lord, and standing before him, said,
> 'Here is Prince Bodhi who seeks refuge with the Lord and his doctrine
> and his confraternity.'  
>  20. Now, in person, for the third time I seek such refuge, and ask
> the Lord to accept me as a follower who has found an abiding refuge
> while life lasts."
>
>   
> § 5. Keniya's Welcome
>
>  1. There was living at Apanath a Brahmin, Sela, who was versed in
> all three Vedas, was accomplished in ritual with the glosses thereon,
> in phonology, and in etymology, with chronicles as a fifth branch; he
> knew exegesis, and was learned in casuistry and.in the signs that mark
> a superman; he had three hundred young brahmins to whom he taught the
> runes.  
>  2. Keniya the fire-worshipper was an adherent of this Brahmin,
> Sela. Accompanied by his three hundred pupils, Sela went and saw all
> the fire-worshippers there busy with their several tasks, with Keniya
> himself marking off the reserved circles.  
>  3. At the sight of this the Brahmin said to Keniya: "What is all
> this? Is it a wedding feast? Or is there a great sacrifice afoot? Or
> have you invited to a repast tomorrow Seniya Bimbisara, king of
> Magadha, with all his host?"  
>  4. "It is no wedding feast, Sela, nor is the king coming with all
> his host. But I have got a great sacrifice afoot. For the recluse
> Gautama has arrived at Apana, in the course of an alms-pilgrimage,
> with twelve hundred and fifty alms-men in his train.  
>  5. "Now such, according to report, is the high repute of this
> Gautama, that he is deemed to be the Lord of Enlightenment.  
>  6. "It is he whom I have invited to tomorrow's meal here, together
> with his confraternity. The feast that is being prepared is for
> him."  
>  7. "Did you attribute to him Enlightenment, Keniya?" asked Sela.
> "Yes, I did," replied Keniya. "Did you?" "Yes I did."
>
>   
> § 6. Pasendi In Praise of the Master
>
>  1. Once the Exalted One was staying near Shravasti, at Jeta's
> grove, in Anathapindika's park.  
>  2. Now at that time the rajah of Kosala, Pasendi, had just
> returned from a sham-fight, in which he was victorious, having carried
> out his object. And on reaching the park he turned in that way. So far
> as the cart-road went he rode in his chariot, and then got down and
> went on foot through the park.  
>  3. On that occasion a number of the brethren were walking up and
> down in the open air. Then Pasendi, the rajah of Kosala, went up to
> those brethren and thus accosted them: "Reverend sirs, where now is
> the Exalted One staying, that Arahant, Buddha Supreme: for I long to
> behold Him."  
>  4. "Yonder, Maharajah, is his lodging, and the door is shut. Do
> you go up quietly, without nervousness, enter the verandah, cough, and
> rattle the door-bar. The Exalted One will open the door to you."  
>  5. So Pasendi, the rajah of Kosala, went up to the lodging as he
> was told, coughed, and rattled the door-bar. And the Exalted One
> opened the door.  
>  6. Then Pasendi entered the lodging, fell with his head at the
> feet of the Exalted One, kissed His feet and stroked them with his
> hands, and announced his name, saying, "Lord, I am Pasendi, the rajah
> of Kosala."  
>  8. "But, Maharajah, seeing what significance therein, do you show
> me this profound humanity and pay such affectionate obeisance to this
> body?" said the Lord!
