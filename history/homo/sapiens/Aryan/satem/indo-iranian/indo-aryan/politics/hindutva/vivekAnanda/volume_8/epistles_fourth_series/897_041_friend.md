## XLI

*To Mr. E. T. Sturdy*

19 W. 38TH ST.,  
NEW YORK

DEAR FRIEND,

I received your last duly, and as I had a previous arrangement to come
to Europe by the end of this August, I take your invitation as a Divine
Call.

"Truth alone triumphs, not untruth. Through truth alone lies the way to
DevayƒÅna (the way to the gods)." Those who think that a little
sugar-coating of untruth helps the spread of truth are mistaken and will
find in the long run that a single drop of poison poisons the whole
mass. . . . The man who is pure, and who dares, does all things. May the
Lord ever protect you from illusion and delusion! I am ever ready to
work with you, and the Lord will send us friends by the hundred, if only
we be our own friends first. "The Atman alone is the friend of the
Atman."

Europe has always been the source of social, and Asia of spiritual
power; and the whole history of the world is the tale of the varying
combinations of those two powers. Slowly a new leaf is being turned in
the story of humanity. The signs of this are everywhere. Hundreds of new
plans will be created and destroyed. Only the fit will survive. And what
but the true and the good is the fit?

Yours etc.,  
VIVEKANANDA.
