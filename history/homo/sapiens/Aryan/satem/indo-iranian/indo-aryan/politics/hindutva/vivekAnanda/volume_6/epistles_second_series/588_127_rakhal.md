## CXXVII

(*Translated from [Bengali](b7345e6127.pdf)* )

ALMORA,  
*14th June, 1897*.

DEAR RAKHAL,

I am wholly in sympathy with the subject-matter of the letter of Charu
that you have sent me.

In the proposed Address to the Queen-Empress the following points should
be noted:

1\. That it must be free from exaggeration, in other words, statements
to the effect that she is God's regent and so forth, which are so common
to us natives.

2\. That all religions having been protected during her reign, we have
been able fearlessly to preach our Vedantic doctrines both in India and
England.

3\. Her kindness towards the Indian poor â€” as, for instance, her
inspiring the English to unique acts of charity by contributing herself
to the cause of famine-relief.

4\. Prayer for her long life and for the continual growth of happiness
and prosperity among the people of her dominions.

Have this written in correct English and send it to me at Almora, and I
shall sign it and send it to Simla. Let me know to whom it should be
addressed at Simla. 

Yours affectionately,

VIVEKANANDA.

  
PS. Let Shuddhananda preserve a copy of the weekly letters that he
writes to me from the Math.
