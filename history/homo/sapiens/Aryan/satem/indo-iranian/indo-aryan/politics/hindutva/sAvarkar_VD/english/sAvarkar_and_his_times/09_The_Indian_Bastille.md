With a blanket on his head and a platter in one hand,
Savarkar stood in chains before the ferocious lofty gates deco-
rated with all kinds of chains, hand-cuffs, fetters, guns and
bayonets. The gate creaked ! Someone whispered that
Mr. Barrie was coming on. Savarkar was preoccupied and
was not conscious of Barrie’s arrival. A voice roared, “ Leave
him. He is not a tiger ! ” The harsh voice waked Savarkar
up. Turning to Savarkar the jailer opened conversation with
him.

Babrie : Are you the same man that tried to escape at
Marseilles ?

Savarkar : Yes, why ?

Barrie : Why did you do it ?

Savarkar : For some reasons. One of them was to free
myself from these hardships.

Barrie : But you fell into them of your own accord, is it
not ?

Savarkar : True. I threw myself into them. Just so, I
thought it my duty to escape from all these tribulations.

Barrie : To tell the truth, I am not an Englishman. I am
an Irishman.

Savarkar : May be. Had you been an Englishman, it
would have mattered little. I would not hate you because
you were an Englishman. I have spent the best part of
my youth in England and I am a warm admirer of many
virtues of Englishmen.

Barrie : But the point is that I was an Irish revolutionary
and fought for the independence of Ireland. Now I see
the futility of it. Hence as a friend I may tell you that
you are still yoimg and I am advanced in age. . . .

Savarkar {cutting him short) : And don’t you think that
perhaps that may be the reason of the change that has

come over you ? Not increasing wisdom but dwindling
energy !

Babbie {scandalized) : You see, you are a barrister and I
am a mere jailer. Don’t discard my advice. Murders are
murders and they will never bring independence.

Savarkar : Quite so ; but why don’t you try your advice
on the Sinn Feincrs ? And who told you that I was a
party to violence ?

Barrie {suddenly assuming his official tone) : What I
talked is against the rules. It pained me to see a youth
of your great learning and fame among these criminals.
I have nothing to do with your past. Mind well you are
to abide by the rules. Their breach will bring on its
penalty. One thing more. I may inform you that any
attempt on your part at escaping from this island will
be a feast to cannibals.

Savaiucar : I know Port Blair is not Marseilles !

And so ended the first passage at arms between Mr. Barrie
and Savarkar.

This Barrie had attained a marvellous notoriety among
the criminals and political prisoners of India. Violent, fero-
cious, and stupid, he was a pot-bellied, bulky, red-skinned
fellow with round staring eyes, fierce moustache, flat nose,
short neck and carried a big staff in his hand. No other
mediocre official ever lived long in the memory of the prisoners
in the Andamans as Barrie did for the atrocities he
perpetrated in his officied capacity as the jailer of the Indian
Bastille. Half-ilhterate, full-blown coward, he lustily loved
authority for which he fawned on his superiors and with
which he tyrannised the convicts. Ignorant of intellectual
pursuits his pastime was cruelty. His manner and tone ex-
pressed instinctive hatred for political prisoners. He loved
self-praise immensely and sometimes displayed his learning
which of course consisted of a few lines of poetry and some
extracts to evoke a good remark from Savarkar. His poor
wife and educated daughter often emptied the vials of his
villainy and the Christmas days reminded the Christian jailer
at least not to return evil for good !

Savarkar fearlessly entered the ferocious jaws of the
Deathland as the early Christian martyrs faced the lions in

the Coliseum of the Romans. He started his life in the Anda-
mans with a salt-water bath which began and ended with
the brays of the Jamadar. Then he was locked in a cell on
the third floor of the yard No. 7 of the Cellular JaiL The
whole floor of yard No. 7 was vacated for him. The most
wicked and vicious Pathans drilled in the methods of tor-
turous jail administration were posted to guard his cell. It
had been a part of the policy of the British bureaucracy to
utilize whenever possible the fanatic Muslim mind against
the Hindu forces and fighters. At every major crisis, at every
decisive event, they gave full reins to their instinctive anti-
Hindu bent of mind to frustrate the plans of the Hindu leaders
or torture the Hindu agitators. History is replete with such
instances.

It is the characteristic of a great life that it is ever full of
duties and sacrifices. The soul that suffers gets stronger and
sober. The soul of a Great Man never stands still. For Great
Men are the heart of humanity. Their work never ceases
for a single second until the day of death. The proverbs that
no pains, no gains and no gall, no glory are undying. After a
deed of deathless virtue, Savarkar was also thrown into the
furnace of tribulations. The more the gold burns, the brighter
it shines, and greater the number of clouds, the more dazzling
is the splendour of the sun when he breaks forth.

Love of one’s own country or humanity, if from within, is
sublime and enduring. Patriotism or service of humanity,
if from without, fades and withers. The former originates
from a devotion to human progress or a belief in the sanctity
of human life. The latter springs from immoral and foul
personal ambition. Courage and spirit of self-sacrifice perpe-
tuate true love, and self and pelf scandalize the untrue love.
Savarkar belongs to the first heroic line of selfless patriots
who belong not to one particular countiy but to the whole
world. Savarkar was a pioneer in this line, and pioneers
idealize the real 'and the successors realize the ideal.

Savarkar’s arrival deeply stirred the whole of the Anda-
mans. There was a feeling of change, freshness and life in
the Andamans. To have a talk or a look at Savarkar, the
world-famous revolutionary leader, visits of foreigners and



96


SAVARKAR AMO HIS TIMES

guests became a common feature in the Andamans. Ocean-
going steamers, warships, mercantile ships would sojourn to
give leisure to their men of authority or fame to have a talk
with the illustrious Indian prisoner. They even humbly
caioled Mr. Barrie for permitting them to have a look at
Savarkar. Next morning after Savarkar’s arrival the Pathan
warder annoxmced the coming of Mr. Barrie. Barrie appeared
with his usual staff in hand, accompanied by a guest. He
opened the conversation with a reference to 1857.

Barrie being struck dumb on all points his guest interfered,
and said to Savarkar : “ But don’t you condemn the self-
centred rebels like Nana and Tatya Tope ? ” “ Condemn ?

You see, I am a prisoner. I can’t freely discuss these points
here. If you stop me in the middle and try to lower the pres-
tige and honour of my nation, it will be a sheer act of
cowardice,” replied Savarkar with a distinct note in his voice.
Barrie granted Savarkar’s request and allowed him to discuss
freely. “ I know,” said Savarkar, “ You are feeling the
embers. This is a discussion on vital points in history and I
will do it freely at any cost. It is sheer cowardice to bear
silently vile attacks on one’s national honour.” He proceeded,

“ The Government had appointed a committee to investigate
the so-called atrocities of this nature. It pronounced its
verdict ‘ that those descriptions were baseless ’ and were
invented by the wily brains of the British soldiers.” The
flame of righteous pride in Savarkar’s heart was fanned. The
hero was justifying the deeds of heroes. With a rise in his
voice he said, “ You describe Nana Sahib and Tatya Tope as
self-seekers. For, Nana wanted to be king and Tatya wanted
to attain glory. But is it not also true that Victor Emmanuel
wanted to be King, Washington had an eye to the president-
ship and Garibaldi craved for greatness ? The fact is that
they all fought for their national independence. None should
decry them. And as for the massacres at Cawnpore, they
were an answer to the terrible atrocities and the wholesale
burning of villages committed by the British troops approach-
ing Cawnpore.” Barrie’s guest was silenced. The conversa-
tion ended.

Before Savarkar’s arrival the revolutionaries of Maniktola
case, Savarkar’s brother Babarao with Wamanrao Joshi, some



THE INDIAN BASTILLE 97

editors from Allahabad and some other political prisoners
were rotting in the cellular jail of the Andamans. Out of the
first group three had received sentences for life transportation
for having waged war against the King Emperor and others
were short-termed prisoners. Defeated valiant fighters of
‘ 1857 ’ were the first and foremost champions to face the
hellish fire of the Andamans. Stricken in age, one of the
sxirviving warriors of ‘ 1857 ’ congratulated Savarkar on his
having continued the War of Independence. After the heroes
of ‘ 1857 ’ came the fighters of Wasudeo Balv/ant. Thus the
sacrificial fire was kept burning from 1857 to 1910 in the
Andamans and continued to do so by patriots and martyrs
who were transported to the Andamans in subsequent years.

The coming of Savarkar brought better days for the political
prisoners in particular and convicts in general. Hitherto no
discrimination was made there between political and ordinary
prisoners. Barrie and his fawning dogs ran amock. Barrie’s
word was law, his dogs’ barkings were its arms. A man of
little education, Barrie compensated for his inferiority complex
by his harsh voice, bullying nature, crooked ways, and dull
wits. His rough life had taken off the edge of his sense so much
so that he utterly failed to distinguish between truth and
falsehood. In his zest to rule the convicts with a heavy hand
he proved to be worse than the English officials. Indeed the
hot sand is more scorching than the sun itself. He called the
revolutionaries bombthrowers, damned rascals and put the
letter ‘ D ’ around their neck describing them as “ dangerous ”
characters ! His attitude towards the ordinary convicts was
lenient, but towards revolutionaries inexorably severe. He
violently abused the prisoners in general and causelessly
harassed them. Even with this sort of harassment, uptU now
the political prisoners had failed in giving a united fight to
curb the unjust rule of Barrie. Their condition was very
miserable.

The revolutionaries had to undergo unbearable physical
tortures. They were yoked to the oil-mill. And the working
on the oil-mill demanded such hard labour that it squeezed
the life out of even the hardened and seasoned convicts, and
they trembled at its sight. The oil-miU was, therefore, aptly
regarded as the friend of suicide. Prisoners had to turn its



98 SAVARKAR AND HIS TZMBS

handle horizontally for hours together without even a slight
break. They had to take their meals and drink water, while
the oil-mill was in motion lest the quota of the oil might fall
far below the expectation. But even with such hard labour
full measure of the required quota could never be fulfilled
by even the strongest prisoner. Their hands bled, hearts
ached, heads whirled. They fell in dead faints. When they
revived, round and round they had to go again in excruciat-
ing agony. Prisoners were sent to water closets in a file of
eight or ten and they had to rush out without finishing the
natural functions at the whim of the warder or were dragged
out in that state too. It was an offence to answer the call
of nature except during the scheduled time of morning, noon
and evening. If any political prisoner felt the necessity to do
so at odd hours, he did it in his cell in the small pot or on
the walls of his cell and bribed the scavenger with a pinch of
tobacco to get it cleared or else he was punished for this
unavoidable natural call by being put into standing-handcuffs
from 6 a.m. to 10 a.m. and from 12 noon to 5 p.m. During
these punishment hours if he could not check his natural calls,
he would answer them in that hanging condition. Political
prisoners were not given as much leisure or rest as is given
even to the beasts of burden for answering nature’s calls or
other natural functions. Educated persons were used as beasts
of burden and illiterate persons were given clerical work.
Pathans, warders and petty officers gulped down the .share of
the prisoners’ food and milk. What is more, the doctors
followed the diagnosis of the jailer !

The right of writing letters home was deprived even if any
prisoner broke the file at the time of meals, or talked with
his neighbour. Prisoners were forced to take their meals in
soaking rains or in the scorching sim. The duration of time
for meals depended not on the clock, but on the crowing of
the warder. None could ask for more food, nor eat less. If
surplus was thrown away, the prisoner was made to bring it
back and eat it up !

Sometimes the prisoners had to drink water with a squeez
on their noses. So dirty was its smell. Some political
prisoners were made to do odd jobs at the residence of the
officers, to clean streets and to draw carts of the officers. To

relieve taemselves from the insufferable hard labour prisoners
ate some harmful herbs or took some other drastic medicine
that brought on diarrhoea or vomits of blood or high fever.
Some pretended stark madness covering their faces even with
stools. Their last refuge was suicide, the sure guide, friend
and saviour, a consummation devoutly to be wished ! Thus it
will be seen that cellular jail machine was more soulless and
dreadful, more devilish and dehumanising than any other
terrific jail machine under the sun of Bastille notoriety or the
Fortress of Peter and Paul in Czarist Russia of evil name.

Writing about this prison life, Savarkar said : “ Life in a
jail for good, for evil, is a unique chance. Man can never go
out of it exactly as he came in. He goes out far better or far
worse. Either more angelic or more fiendish. Fortunately
for me, my mind has so quickly adapted itself to the changes
in circumstances. It seems so strange that a nature so restless
and active, roaming over continents, should so quickly feel
quite at home in a cell hardly a dozen feet in length. And yet
one of the kindest gifts of Providence to Humanity is this
plasticity, this adaptability of the human mind to the ever
changing environments of life.” * To become your own friend
you must retire into your own inner self and cultivate the
friendship of the conscience, the God in you. A yogin in
action can exercise such a tremendous control over his senses.
Savarkar had conquered his senses and acclimatized himself
to the new change. His mind climbed the tower of human
imagination and saw the vastness of the universe dissolving
its identity into Him. “ When early in the morning and late
in the evening,” he wrote from the cellular jail, “ I try a bit
of Pranayam and then pass insensibly into a sweet sound sleep
— Oh how calm and quiet is that rest, so calm that when I get
up in the morning, it is long before I can realize again that
I am in a prison cell lying on a wooden plank. All the
conunon aims and allurements of mankind having receded
far, the conscience is perfectly pleased with itself with the
conviction of having served under His Banner and served
to some purpose. A calm, sweet equanimity is left with my
soul and it lulls my mind in an intense peace.” ^

J Savarkar, An Echo from Andamans, p. 18.

•Ibid., p. 18.



100 SAVASKAR AND HIS TIMES

Here is a lively description of the daily life in the Cellular
jail in Savarkar’s words. “ I get up in the morning when
the bell goes on at 5 a.m. At its sound I feel as if I had
entered a higher college for a higher study. Then we do our
work of rigour till 10 a.m. While my hands and feet are
automatically doing the given task, my spirit avoiding all
detection is out for a morning trip, and across the seas and
oceans, over hills and dales, it roams sipping only pleasant
things and things noble, like a bee among flowers. Then I
compose some new lines. Then we dine and at 12 noon
work again. From 4 p.m. comes rest, reading, etc. This is
the usual round of life here.” The master artist in Savarkar
further described the vivid picture in a Voltarian satire. He
added : ” In a prison what happens on the first day, happens
always, if nothing worse happens. In fact, it seems to be the
essence of prison discipline to avoid all novelty, all change.
Like specimens and curios in a museum, here we are each
exactly in the same place and same position, belted and
labelled with the same numbers with more or less dust about
us. . . . We get up early, work hard, eat pimctually at the
same place and the same amount and kind of food prepared
with the same matchless prison skill and medical care.”
He concluded : “ Almost every night, I tell you, I break the
jail and out by dale and down and by tower and town go on
romping till I find some one of you — some one who somewhere
had been held close to my bosom ! Every night I do it but
my beneficent jailers take no notice of it. You have only
to wake up in the jail, that is all they say ! ” * Solitary
monotony for twelve years in a cell ! This is a clue to the
introversion that clung to Savarkar in later life and made him
disinclined to mix freely with people and personalities.

II

For the first fortnight Savarkar was closed in a solitary
cell. Then he was given the work of chopping the barks of
cocoanuts with a heavy wooden mallet. His hands bled,
swelled, ached and the coir was blistered with blood. In order
to frighten Savarkar into submissiveness, Barrie displayed the
wrath of his power by reviling his co-sufferers in his presence.

1 Savarkar, An Echo from Andamans, p. 39.



THE INDIAN BASTILLE 101

Barrie’s one aim was to impress upon Savarkar that he was
not a political prisoner, but an ordinary criminal. The jailer
always tried to dishearten and frighten him by riveting his
eyes to the ticket on his breast showing imprisonment for half
a century. But with cdl his resourcefulness Barrie could not
overpower or overawe Savarkar. His personality, his fame
and his courage had outgrown the pale of Barrie’s mind, men
and power.

The case of other political prisoners was quite different.
With sunken heads they bore humiliations and were mortally
wounded in their feelings, when Barrie spurred them with
loathing. Savarkar consoled his co-sufferers and breathed
life into them. He cheered them. He said that though they
were helpless in those days, yet a day would dawn when
statues would be erected to their memory in the very jail.
Future generations would make a pilgrimage to that place
saying, “ Here dwelt for years the patriots of our land, the
flesh of our flesh, the spirit of our spirit that fell in the cause
of freedom.” He added that their sufferings, their wounds
and their struggle would be fruitful in the end.

And thirty-two years later Nctaji Subhas Bose of the Indian
National Army hoisted over Port Blair the flag of indepen-
dence on December 30, 1943, honoured the memory of the
Indicin revolutionaries by saluting the cellular jail and re-
named Andamans as “ Shaheed Island ” in memory of the
martyrs. The wheel of destiny had turned. In a press
interview in November 1943, Netaji said : “ Most of the
political prisoners sentenced to penal servitude for conspiracies
to overthrow the British Government, — and there have been
hxmdreds of them, — ^were locked up in this Island. Like the
Bastille in Paris, which was liberated first during the French
Revolution, setting free political prisoners, the Andamans,
where our patriots suffered much is the first to be liberated in
India’s fight for independence.” ’ Savarkar’s prophecy came
true to a letter !

Subhas Bose was not a degenerated man to disparage the
noblest sacrifice of the heroes of the Andamans. He knew
that their prison life had only one class. That was facing
death in every form at every moment. Not fruits but frowns,

* Jat Hind, published by Amritlal Prabhashankar, p. 74.

not cosy beds but wooden planks galled them. There they
rolled in dark, damp, dirty, dingy cells. Every hour of theirs
they passed in moving, mournful and moanful misery. Their
food was half-cooked, soiled, filled with drops of sweat and
often seasoned with pieces of reptiles or white dead worms.
They toiled like horses and worked as bullocks ! The climate
sapped their vitality and life. Under the strain and stress of
extreme physical rigours some of them showed signs of mental
aberration and collapsed into insanity. They underwent these
poignant trials for the very liberation of their Motherland.
Had they worked safely enough to save their skin, had they
loved a life of peace, pelf and position, they would have attain-
ed it easily for some of them were sufficiently rich or eminently
gifted with rich brains. Subhas knew this and so he honoured
them first.

In the middle of August 1911, Savarkar was yoked to the
oil-mill, the hardest task, the greatest test and the severest
pain the cellular life witnessed. The jail superintendent called
Savarkar and said he would not give him that work again
if he did it for two weeks. This severest turn of dealing with
prisoners was a result of the strong remarks of an officer from
Calcutta, the then Capital of the Government of India, to the
effect that the prisoners in the Andamans were treated
considerately. That visit gave a handle to Barrie to play
havoc in the Andamans. Barrie deliberately reminded
Savarkar of the fifty years’ rigorous sentence and promised
him help if he did not refuse to do the work. Heartless as he
was, he unkindly remarked that Savarkar was promoted from
Coir to Kolu — the oil-mill ! This promotion or rise in the
status, curiously enough, was upheld by the Bombay Univer-
sity which informed Savarkar only a day before he was
harnessed to the oil-mill that his B.A. degree was cancelled.
There was nothing strange that a University in a slave
country should kill its child for its own exi.stence.

As for the remembrance of 50 years’ imprisonment Savarkar
was used to it now, as an artillery soldier is used to the
terrific booming.

The barrister thus began to move around the oil-mill like
a bullock. His body ached, muscles writhed with pain,
stomach turned and mouth parched, for the prisoner was not



THE INDIAN BASTlIiLE 103

even given more than a certain quantity of water. Moved by
the sight, some political prisoners helped him secretly. There
was even healthy rivalry among them for washing his clothes
secretly. Savarkar was overwhelmed with their feelings. In
turn he would sometimes wash their clothes without their
knowledge and they sincerely entreated him not to do so.

Savarkar felt that his great powers that would have enriched
the destiny of the country were wasting away. Disgustful
of dying a slow, painful death, and that too unobserved, his
mind drove him to the thought of suicide. In such a state
suicide becomes a deed of self-respect ! For a while he was
fascinated with the idea and greedily looked to the upper side
of the window of the cell from where many mounted on to
heaven by means of rags tightened to their necks ! Dusty
and deadly fatigued, one day he reeled against the vrall sur-
rounding the oil-mill and fell in a faint. When he revived,
things around him became gradually visible and intelligible
to him one by one ; he knew by and by who and where he
was, and he picked himself up with great effort for work !
For some time mind routed reason. Defeated reason again
joined battle. It said, “ What an ego ! You never craved
for name, fame and glory. You wished to suffer most for
humanity. You attained it. What of your abilities and
intelligence ! There was a time when there were no
Himalayas ; there will be a time when they will not be there.
Even the sun in the universe has an unsteady position. He
will be pricked one day like a bubble and still the universe
will go on. Therefore, if you want to die, do not die a cowardly
death by suicide, but die valiantly.” ' Reason inspired
courage into the mind and it plumed its feathers, soaring, and
singing again.

The first secret note Savarkar got was from Hotilal Varma.
The note dashed against the inside wall of the cell with a
stone. The sound occasioned a great hubub. Warders from
below ran upstairs and searched Savarkar and his cell, but
in vain. When they were gone, he took it out from the
innermost delicate part of the body and read it ! In it
Hotilalji had informed Savarkar that there was a division
among the Bengali revolutionaries. It was a fact that some


1 Savarkar, Mazi Janmathep, p. 131.



IM SAVARKAR AND HIS TIMES

of them could not stand the sufferings and turned informants
and lackeys. In others the conscience was not yet dead. They
told their colleagues to put an end to their lives since life
had been made impossible for them due to severe agonies.
Savarkar felt sympathy for the past services and sacrifices of
those heroic souls who had turned informants. Their tortured
body became untrue to their faith and trampled upon the soul.
Yet, he held that none had the right to criticise them but
those who had suffered more than they. Those who decided
to live under any circumstances avoided tortures by being
lackeys and spies of Barrie. Those who despised a life of
dishonour preferred death to living as traitors to the cause
and the country. There were few who considered life worth
living till it did not go against their principles.

m

Savarkai resolved to resort to agitation within the four
corners of law in the Andamans to secure the privileges of
political prisoners for his comrades and to compel the jail
authorities to give physical and cultural amenities to political
prisoners. With that aim in view he first devoted his mind
to the education of the political prisoners. The revolutionaries
were all youtlis. Some of them had chosen this life owing
to their daring, noble and selfless disposition. Some of them
had vague and hazy notions about the fundamental principles
of the revolutionary struggle, its aims and its methods.
Savarkar decided to driU and steel them in those fundamentals
which gave them a solid base of knowledge of Political
science, of Economics, and of Constitutional Law. The contact
began at the oil-mill, or at the work of chopping the bark.
Besides, education was imparted through the top of the
windows and holes at the bottom of the walls of the cells;
on the occasion of transfer of cells, going to and coming from
the jail office and through a secret service of private notes.

This movement needed books. And books were a red rag
to Barrie. On Sundays prisoners got books. Every evening
they also got books, but each his own. Exchange of books
was dealt vdth seriously. For this breach of discipline
offenders would hang in hand-cuffs for a period of four days.



THE INDIAN BASTILLE 105

The chief obstacle in the way was Barrie’s terrible ignorance
and his loathing for books. To his ignorant mind books
containing words like “ nation,” “ coxintry ” “ patriotism ”,
drove men to acts of violence. And books on theosophy, he
held, made them mad ! Barrie, perhaps, forgave a prisoner
for any trifling offence or a glaring breach, but never did he
tolerate the sight of a book or a slate ! Savarkar cheered his
co-sufferers by telling them the stories of heroes from the
mythology and history. In jail not a scrap of paper was
tolerated. A tiny piece of lead hidden in hair or in the cavity
of mouth would amount to a crime and would bring severe
punishment. The cell of Savarkar was raided even twic2 or
thrice a week during the first six or seven years. Illegible
writing on the walls was considered a wilful damage to Gov-
ernment property.

The task of educating his co-prisoners was difficult. At the
beginning even the educated prisoners treated this new move
with scant respect cind the illiterate fled from it. Pointing
out the then confusion in New China due to want of constitu-
tioned experts, and the disorderliness in new Iran for want of
economists and accountants, Savarkar impressed upon the
revolutionaries that for conducting a Government efficiently
they should also have Gokhales, Dutts or Sir Madhavraos
among them having mastery over the knowledge of Constitu-
tional Law, Science of Economics and Politics. In their
present lot they could do nothing better than store this
knowledge in order to equip themselves better for the future
work, struggle and action, as some of them were short-termed
prisoners and would soon be free. For Savarkar held that
knowledge without action was lame and action without
knowledge was bhnd. To him knowledge that did not issue
in any tangible action was like a tree without fruit !

Savarkar fought out the problem of books despite the opposi-
tion of Barrie and ultimately secured the Superintendent’s
permission to store books. It was mutually arranged that
every prisoner should ask his relative to send books at a
particular time so that every month they received a parcel of
new books. Still Barrie would have his say. He blackened
some pages or tore away those pages of the books which he
considered objectionable. *1116 idea of a library appealed to



106 SAVARKAR AMD BIS TIMES

European officers also and they deposited their books in the
library. Some prisoners were entrusted with the work of
maintaining the library. At first the criminals avoided Bade
Babu’s (as Savarkar was called by them) literacy campaign.
Soon some of them saw its utility and joined ; others who fled
from him were sometimes awarded scholarships, in the
currency of the Andamans, a pinch of tobacco, and were won
over. The effect was visible. Many completed some course
and were appointed Munshis — clerks. Criminals abated in
their fury and became more docile. They read religious books
with great devotion. Many leaimt to read papers and when
they could do so their joy knew no bounds !

V/ith the growth of the literacy movement the library also
began to gicw. It swelled with complete works of Spencer,
Shakespeare, Mill, Vivekananda, Ramkrishna ; great works of
Gibbon, Emerson, Macaulay, Carlyle, Tolstoy, Nietszche,
Rousseau, Voltaire and Tagore. The Library also contained
Plato's Rrptihlic, Thomas Moor’s Utopia, Rousseau’s Contract,
Wilson’s State, works of Great Mahratta and Bengali Poets ;
Bengali, Hindi, Marathi Weeklies and Monthlies ; Modern
Review and Indian Review’. It was in the Andamans that
Savarkar drank deep at the fountain of Bengali literature.
Though he b.ad composed a poem on the Nobel Prizeman,
Ral)indranath Tagore, he was of opinion that Bankimchandra,
Roy and Madhusudan were equally great in sweep, imagina-
tion and rhythm.

But the books that appealed to him most were Yogavashistha
and the Imitation of Christ by Thomas A Kempis. The spell of
the latter was so irresistible that he gladly received it as a
gift from a European officer on his return journey from the
Indian Bastille. The energy and patience of Savarkar were
inexhaustible ! Savarkar taught the criminals and his
colleagues with the endurance, insistence and love of a loving
teacher. To some of the dull criminals he had to give the
alphabetic lesson for over twenty times before his perseverance
could boar fruit. The criminals read religious books and
newspapers wdth great interest. Everyone was now anxious
to secure nows about Hindusthan and making propaganda
for her cause ! At the time of Savarkar’s departure the
library contained about 2,000 books. The object of the



THE IHDIAN BASTILLE 107

campaign was fulfilled. The cent per cent illiteracy amongst
the convicts was changed into sixty per cent literacy when
Savarkar left the Andamans.

But none of his propagandistic moves aroused so vigorous
an opposition and such widespread misunderstanding as did
his great efforts for investing Hindi with the importance of
the Lingua Franca of India. That Hindi should be the Lingua
Franca of India was one of the important creeds of the Abhi-
nava Bharat. The Abhinava Bharat had declared this times
without number. Savarkar struggled hard to imprint upon the
minds of his colleague.? and co-prisoners the importance of
Hindi. Struggle, storm, sparks, conviction and spell are the
characteristics of Savarkarian movements. They are the fate
of evex'y pioneer, precursor and prophet. Savarkar appealed
to his colleagues to call for books on Hindi. He taught them
Hindi. He insisted that every prisoner should learn his main
provincial language and Hindi as the national language.
Madrasis and Bengalis were averse to it and adversely
criticised Savarkar’s stand. They even suspected that
Savarkar wanted to kill their mother-tongues under the guise
of a National Language. If somebody wished to bestow gifts
in memory of the celebration of any good day or event,
Savarkar persuaded him to give Hindi books. Savarkar
answered his critics that he never persuaded any one to
purchase Marathi books and asked them whether he wanted
to kill Marathi also. Not less violent was the opposition from
the British Officers. They knew Urdu and therefore they
opposed the introduction of Hindi and Nagari and more so
because it was a cause propagated by Savarkar. Hence they
feared that either it would enormously increase his influence
or would develop into a menace in some respects ! This
latter suspicion was mooted and fomented by the Muslims in
the Andamans too !

In this cause the Arya Samajists helped him, as Swami
Dayananda, their prophet, was the first and foremost leader
to champion the cause of Hindi with Nagari script, as the
Lingua Franca of India. Dayananda wrote his books in Hindi.
Savarkar’s respect for Dayananda was high. He got the
Satyartha Prakash read by his colleagues and co-prisoners. He
regarded the great work of Dayananda as a fearless and



108 SAVARKAR AND HIS TIMES

farmidable exposition that teaches and implants the noble
ideals of Hindu culture, elucidating the importance of Hindu
religion as the national religion of Hindusthan. Savarkar
explained to his colleagues how Hindi had been the national
tongue, an all-India language of the sadhus and merchants,
princes and pilgrims from Rameshwar to Badrinath, from Puri
to Dwarka ever since the days of Prithviraj.

Before this the second language of the jail office of the
Cellular Jail or the Andamans was Urdu and the posts of
Munshis had been occupied by persons from Upper India who
were educated in Urdu. Letters, reports and applications to
and from the Andamans were written in Urdu ! After a long
struggle Savarkar persuaded the prisoners to write their
letters in the provincial languages or conveniently in Hindi
and to write their complaints, answers, or applications in Hindi
so that the necessity and urgency of Nagari-knowing Munshis
should be felt increasingly. The effect was tremendous.
Formerly ninety per cent of the letters from and to the
Andamans were in Urdu, a few years after the arrival of
Savarkar the tables were turned and the ratio was in the
reverse order. Some distinguished prisoners from the Punjab,
who had composed their poetry in Urdu, got themselves
accustomed to the Nagari Hindi and re-wrote their poems in
Hindi !

In the colony of free citizens this constant propaganda for
Nagari and Hindi took root and the ceremonial invitation cards
began to appear in Hindi. From the conversations of Hindus
the similes and metaphors describing the Arabic environ-
ments disappeared by and by. It has been Savarkar’s bold
and constant stand for the last forty years that Urdu should
be preserved for Muslims, but it should not be allowed to
replace or dominate Hindi in any field on any account. The
propaganda and importance of the Lingua Franca appealed
even to the officers who were secretly tutored in Hindi. It was
through Savarkar’s efforts and pressure that a Girls’ School
was started in the colony but he could not annihilate the
teaching of Urdu in Boys’ Schools as his departure came off
suddenly ! Savarkar held that if the importance and future
of the Andamans was to be increased usefully in reference to
the safety and predominance of Hindusthan and Hindu



THE INDIAN BA:STXI.LB 109

ctilture, Hindi and Nagari should be made compulsory in the
Andamans.

The significance of this farsighted move can now be imagin-
ed and appreciated. Long before any leader of prominence
ever since the days of Dayananda dreamt of its importance
or entered the field, Savarkar was the only outstanding Hindu
leader who strove in right earnest from 1906 to invest Hindi
with the power and prestige of the National Language. On
the vital problems of nation building he has been ever out-
spoken, uncompromising and prophetic as none else could be.
The Nagari Pracharini Sabha was, of course, toiling in the
field, but slogans fail in the field, if guns are not in the fsjre-
front. It was after forty-three years since the days of the
Abhinava Bharat’s declaration that the nation accepted Hindi
with the Devanagari script as the Lingua Franca of Free
Hindusthan !

In the meantime troubles were coming to a head in the
Andamans. The boldest among the prisoners resolved to
launch upon a strike to vindicate their rights. The strike was
marked by many incidents. Calm, sturdy and of good family,
one Punjabi revolutionary was yoked to the oil-mill. Having
worked till 10 a.m. he took his bath and meals calmly regard-
less of the words of abuse poured by the petty officers to make
him work. The situation grew rather intolerable. The pot-
bellied jailer with the staff in his hand appeared on the scene.
The prisoner told him that he was chewing his food scientific-
ally. Barrie threatened him with punishment, but he did not
yield.

Such rebellious prisoners were kept on rice-gruel, and in
order to weaken the strength of their minds doses of quinine
or some drastic purgative were forced down their throats.
That tortured their physique and aggravated their agonies.
Despite these insufferable tortures this valiant revolutionary
did not yield. At last Barrie came to terms. After four days’
regular work he was relieved of the hard labour. As a result
of this strike, the political prisoners were sent outside for
work in deference to their demands. There they did some



110 SAVARKAR AND HIS TIMES

odd jobs, but one and all refused to draw carts of officers and

re-asserted their dignity.

Savarkar’s elder brother was one of the most unbending
prisoners. The jailer and his dogs tried every method and
measure to torture him. Unfortunately some maladies
worsened the trouble. He was seized now and then with
a splitting headache, typhoid and cholera, but not a drop of
medicine was given to him. He groaned frightfully with pain.
Still he was made to chop the shell of cocoanuts. In the
closed cell he helplessly passed his watery motions upon the
rubbish and threw it outside when the door opened. For
such unavoidable breach he was often hung in hand-cuffs in
a painful state, his bowels purging and his urine passing the
while ! What man has made of man ! Yet this brave man
of steel frame worked at the oil-mill with all his might and
in spite of his agonies, but never did he yield to humiliation
nor did he do a dishonourable act to purchase a sigh of relief.
For good many days the two brothers were not allowed to
have even a glimpse of each other. When Savarkar enquired
of the officers about the severe illness of his elder brother he
was told to speak for himself. They said rules forbade them
to disclose his whereabouts to a prisoner or to speak about
his health ! In the end secret sympathies worked and Babarao
caught sight of his brother. Seeing his younger brother after
years, he burst out: “Tatya, how do you happen to be
here ? ” That direct query pierced Savarkar’s heart. He
was about to speak, but the brothers were suddenly pulled
asunder. Subsequently a secret note to his brother from
Babarao lamented. “The belief that you were carrying on
the fight for the liberation of our Motherland enlivened my
heart and lightened my tortures. Who will carry on your
work ? Your gifts and powers will now go to waste.” The
reply from Savarkar went in a consolatory tone : “ My
abilities and powers have stood the grim test. The glory of
it is that what I preached I practised and fell fighting in the
forefront. It is also a righteous duty to suffer tortures rotting
in the cell with curses from those for whom we fell. For the
achievement of the final victory, these sighs, sufferings and
sacrifices in the cells are as necessary as is the fighting with
the blare of the trumpets of ^ory.”



THE INDIAN BASTILLE


111


To alleviate the tortxures and to blunt the edges of the cruel
claws of the administration, the political prisoners headed by
Savarkar, began to think out ways and means. It was neces-
sary to bring pressure upon the administration from without.
British officers who ruled in the land of Death depended upon
each other for company and comforts. They played, they
danced, they enjoyed themselves together and naturally their
interests did not clash in the administration. Hence a com-
plaint against one was never paid heed to by another ! It
was, therefore, necessary that the leaders in India should know
something of those terrible tortrires. But hov/ to bell the cat
was the question. At last Hotilalji Varma dared and did it.
His secret letter to Surendranath Banerjee giving the details
of the jail life in general reached the Bengal leader ihrough
secret channels. Surendranath published it in his
under the signature of Hotilalji with the numbers of his id!
and chawl ! It was a veritable bombshell. On hearing this
Barrie ran to the cells like a man scorched by embeis. He
roared at Hotilal : “ Stand up at once. You are a rank
rascal,” said he in a voice of thunder. Barrie told Savarkar
about the mischief of Hotilal and falsely added that the Press
in which the Bengali was printed was confiscated.

Everybody in the Andamans was always anxious to get a
scrap of news about the happenings in the Motherland beyond
the ocean. New-comers were, therefore, alway.s i cccived with
utmost cordiality for the sake of news. News also filtered
and was circulated through many other channels. A brave
son of a great leader of the Punjab serving a term in a prison
in the Punjab wrote a letter to Savarkar on the back of
the ticket of a convict. The fellow brought it to Savarhar
undetected. Sources of foreign news were the rubbish papers
at the water closets of the British officers, old soiled wrapping
papers of pins, nails and other articles. Many prisoners lost
their privilege of working outside the jail for bringing in
pieces of newspapers but the news agency worked unabated.
Political prisoners secretly shared their bread with those
devoted and daring messengers. Barrie gaped and was
dumbfounded to know the futility of suppressing news. He
often told the superintendent that even if the devil was
appointed jailer it would be impossible for him to stop news



112 SAVAHKAB AND HIS TIMES

going to those bomb-throwers. Sometimes on his night
rounds Barrie heard messages transmitted by the political
prisoners to one another from one end of the jail to the other
through some peculiar sounds of the chains. If at all the
illiterate warders suspected something, the political prisoners
told the warders that they were muttering prayers in their
mind to the tune of chains ! This Andaman’s wireless was
introduced in Nagari by Babarao Savarkar.

With the same heartlessness Barrie once informed Savarkar
that his friend Hardayal was due to come to the Andamans.
After many secret anxious inquiries Savarkar learnt that
Hardayal had, in fact, given a slip to the Government of
U.S.A. Barrie also once told Savarkar that his brother
Narayanrao was expected in the Andamans as a result of
the bomb thrown at Lord Hardinge in Delhi ! The word
Savarkar was synonymous with sedition and sedition became
synonymous with Savarkar ! Even the Chief Commissioner
told Savarkar that he had met Babu Surendranath Banerjee
on board the steamer and the latter had inquired after the
health of Savarkar. Savaikar had nothing but high regard
for Surendranath Banerjee. He paid tributes to the
imcrowned king of Bengal for the word of encouragement he
sent through a German Military Officer-prisoner and the
sympathy and help he rendered to the patriots in the cellular
jail.

In 1911 there were rumours afloat in the Andamans that all
political prisoners were to be released in memory of the Delhi
Dvwbar. Expectations became rife ; rumours rained. Though
sceptical of his release, a wave of sensation passed through
Savarkar’s body when he heard everyone saying, “Barrister
Babu, you are to be released.” The day dawned. Excepting
Savarkar and a Bengali political prisoner all were given
remission of a month per year. All that Savarkar got was
potato-rice. And the cells were again enveloped in utter
disappointment.

At times when in good humour Barrie would of him.tiplf
break shocking news to Savarkar. One day in 1915 Barrie
told Savarkar that G. K. Gokhale was dead. Savarkar paid
glowing tributes to the memory of the great patriot. Hearing
the glowing tributes paid by Savarkar to the selfless service



THE INDIAN BASTILLE 113

and profound patriotism of Gokhale, Barrie was talfAii aback
and he noted in his diary that though the Maharashtrians
differed outwardly they were one at heart ! Hardayalji had
the same experience about Mahratta leaders.

Savarkar was very anxious to know if India had made any
progress with the royal event. He learnt that the settled
fact was unsettled ; the partition of Bengal was annulled.
Savarkar was happy and said to his colleagues : “ Once a
man is convinced that quinine roots out Malaria, he will take
it whenever he gets an attack of Malaria.” The capital of
India was about to be transferred to Delhi as foretold by
Savarkar, but he said that from the standpoint of liistory,
culture, politics and geography, Ujjain should be the proper
place for the capital of India. December 23, 1912, was the
day for the transfer of the capital from Calcutta to Delhi.
The state entry of Lord Hardinge, the Governor-General of
India, in oriental splendour, was greeted with a terrific bomb
at the famous Chandni Chowk. Lord Hardinge was wounded
while riding in the silver Howdah upon an elephant. The
man behind Hardinge who held the state umbrella was killed.
Hardinge fainted from loss of blood and his wounds took some
months to heal. It seemed that the royal proclamation could
not pacify the revolutionaries. They were grappling as
before with the British power for the liberation of the Mother-
land.

Among the most heroic sufferers in the Andamans that put
up a brave fight to undermine the rigid and rapacious jail
administration of the Cellular Jail and to break the speU of
terror was one Indu Bhushan Roy. Stout, sturdy and spirited,
he was sentenced to transportation for 10 years in the Manik-
tola case. Indu Bhushan soon fell ill and was thrown into his
cell. And instead of giving medicine, Barrie yoked him to
the oil-mill. With deadly pale face, Indu walked with great
effort and great pain. Savarkar tried to console him by
bringing his own severest lot to his attention and cheered him
up. But to no purpose. Next morning Indu Bhushan was
a stiff block, his tongue drawn out, his legs hanging loosely.
Barrie hushed up the note which Indu had suspended on his
chest and stated that Indu’s death was the outcome of in-
sanity. Savarkar challenged this statement and persisted in

t



114 SAVARKAR AND HIS TIMES

f alling Barrie that it was an outcome of the extreme physical
hardships of jail life. Upendranath Banerjee of Alipore case
was also harnessed to the oil-mill. His whole frame ached and
his mental condition grew so much pitiable that a sympathetic
word would move him to tears. Ullaskar Dutt of Alipore
case whom the judge described as a noblest youth was a witty,
fearless and good-hearted type of humanity. When he was
tortured with electric shocks, Ullaskar moaned, raved and
pitieously groaned. He was then transferred to the mental
hospital and thence to Madras and was afterwards released.

After the tragedy of Ullaskar, Barrie asked Savarkar when
he would go mad. Savarkar replied angrily, “ Perhaps after
you go mad ! ” At this juncture a note from Savarkar dis-
cussing the policy of an immediate strike was seized and
Savarkar was punished by putting him in standing hand-cuffs.
Crook as he was, Barrie managed to get Savaikar’s note in
Modi read by a Bengali as if it were written in Bengali !
Savarkar appealed to the Superintendent to look into the
truth and see whether the chit was in Bengali. The truth
came out and Barrie was severely reprimanded. The second
time Savarkar was hung in hand-cuffs was for his note asking
somebody to bring news. Barrie unkindly joked with Savar-
kar in standing hand-cuffs, “ What is this about ? ”

“ Postage ! ” replied Savarkar. “ It has rather cost you much,”
said Barrie. Savarkar answered back pungently, "Not at
all ! In your ca.se you have to pay subscription for news-
papers plus postage. We get news free of subscription. Only
this sort of postage we have to pay half-yearly or so ! ”

The third in the line of martyrs was Nani Gopal, a Bengali
revolutionary of good family. As he was yoked to the oil-
mill, he gave up all work, observed silence, abandoned jail
apparel, and gave up food. The Superintendent decided to flog
him. Savarkar warned Barrie that if they shed his blood
the revolutionaries would definitely retaliate. MAanfimp ,
thrilling news about Indu Bhushan and Ullaskar appeared in
the Indian press. The officers were alarmed. Consequently
there was a sudden roimd-up in the Andamans. Rumours
had it that the revolutionaries were planning to bomb the
Cellular Jail ! Strict measures were adopted. Thorough
search was taken in every cell and in the settlement also.



THE INOIAH BASTILLE


115


Free people and prisoners alike were harassed. Bar-fetters,
hand-cuffs, standing hand-cuffs, penal diet, solitary confine-
ment and all sorts of punishments were imposed. Savarkar
was told that he would never be allowed to work outside,
though according to rules he ought to have been released long
ago from the Cellular Jail to settle on the island. It was
certified that his conduct was exemplary, but his past was
dangerous ! !

Barrie was now wild with rage. He ordered all poUtical
prisoners not to speak in English as he thought their talk in
English raised them high in the eyes of the ordinary criminals.
At once a rebel rose and said in Hindi that because the jailer
asked questions in English they answered in English and
added that political prisoners were not so much enamoured
of Enghsh. He further retorted : “ It is true that we have
not become one with the English tongue and shamelessly
enough forgotten our language. Look at our jailer, he is an
Irishman, but does not know a word of his mother-tongue ! ”
Barrie was scandalized. In a fit of paroxysm he bragged out :
“ You Indians, you are our slaves.” A bold voice shot back,
“ Your slaves ! What are you ? You are a child of a slave
of the British Empire. We are slaves of the British Elmpire
and not yours ! Moreover, we have been striving at the risk
of our necks to overthrow the foreign yoke while you are
calling that empire your own, the empire which has enslaved
your Motherland and what is worse, you are living on the
crumbs of loaf that are thrown before you ! ” Upon this all
the prisoners burst into shrieks of uncontrollable laughter to
the great scandal of the jailer ! The order was changed imme-
diately. He ordered the political prisoners not to speak again
in Hindi !

The protests in the press, the questions in the Imperial
Council, the growing volume of public opinion and the thril-
ling stories of the Cellular Jail brought pressure upon the
Government of India and the Home Member, Sir Reginald
Craddock, paid a visit to the Andamans in 1913. Some selected
political prisoners were called for interview. A few were told
that they deserved a more grievous fate. Others were told
that their past was dangerous. The interview with Savarkar
took a shrewd turn.



116 SAVARKAB AND HIS TIMES

Craddock ; Savarkar, what a pitiable condition you have
thrown yourself in. I have read your writings. If your
intellectual powers had worked in the proper direction,
any highest post of authority in India would have been
conferred upon you. But you chose this line !

Savarkar ; But it is up to you now to save me these tribu-
lations. I learn Gokhale’s Bill demanding compulsory
education has come up for consideration in the Council.
If such opportunities are offered to us, almost all from
our fold will prefer peaceful methods.

Craddock : How do you know that ? Do you also know
the whereabouts of your comrades and lieutenants ?

Savarkar : How can I ? I am here in a solitary cell. But
we know each other’s views. It is a sin to follow the path
of violence when it is possible to make progress in a
peaceful way. Such were my views when we worked in
the revolutionary camp. Such were theirs. Perhaps they
may be thinking likewise.

Craddock : Not at all ! They are still proclaiming the
battle cry in your name in India and in America.

Savarkar ; I know about it from you. How can I prevent
them from using my name ?

Craddock : We will consider the advisability if you are
prepared to write to them about your present views.

Savarkar : Of course, I shall willingly do it. But that
letter must be written by me independently, otherwise it
will be of no use !

Craddock : The letter must go through us !

Savarkar : Then it will mean to them that it was an
extraction !

Craddock : We can’t allow it.

Savarkar : I can’t help it.

Craddock (staring a bit) : Well then, what are your
grievimces ?

Savarkar began to tell the tale of trials. The Chief Com-
missioner intervened. “ But you aU have conspired and acted
dangerously. If Russians had ruled India, they would have
transported you to Siberia or shot you dead.” He added that
political prisoners should be grateful to the British Govern-
ment for having treated them so considerately.



THE INDIAN BASTILLE


117

Savabkar : In that case the Russians would not have dis-
armed us. Peoples of Siberia can be generals. Had it
been possible for us to bear arms, the story of the over-
throw of the Mogul empire would have been repeated !

CKADDOCac : What if you had rebelled against the ancient
Indian Kings. They would have trampled you under the
feet of elephants.

Savarkar : They would have ! In days gone by in Eng-
land a man was also dragged along the street for commit-
ting theft and was beheaded. But it is not so now. The
thing is that this advanced stage is the result of the efforts
of both the camps. If rebels were trampled under ele-
phant's feet, they also, when successful, used to behead
a king like Charles I. Times are changed. Both camps
have improved their methods ! It is a sign of progress.
You frankly tell us that you are not guided by any rules
and we will prepare ourselves for that also !

Craddock came and went. Yet, Nani Gopal had not taken
food. Forty-five days had glided by. Some political prisoners
went on a sympathetic fast and thus the third strike began.
Savarkar awaited his home letter, but it was not handed over
to him as Dr. Savarkar had written to him that Keir Hardie
had compared Irish and Indian revolutionaries in his speech
in Parliament and remai'ked that ‘ British Government had
harshly crushed Savarkar.’ Savarkar knew this through his
secret source and then joined the strike. From the first he
was averse to a hunger strike and wasting energy. But Nani
Gopal’s life was in danger. He, therefore, declined to take
food and asked for an interview with Nani Gopal. Nani Gopal
and Savarkar were allowed to meet. Nani Gopal broke his
fast when he knew that Savarkar had gone on a sympathetic
fast. Mirzakhan, the notorious pocket edition of Barrie,
proudly told Savarkar that Nani was a brave disciple of
Savarkar and his courage befitted a Pathan and not a Hindu !
Savarkar answered in a Savarkarian way. He said, “Had
Nani been a Pathan he would have like a fawning dog licked
the dust at the feet of Barrie ! The fact is that had all the
Pathans been brave and all the Hindus not brave, your Pathan
or Mogul Empire would not have been .smashed by the
Hindus ! ”



118 SAVARKAR AND HIS TIMES

The years rolled by and at last came the news that the
Government of India had decided to bring back the termed
convicts to Indian jails. Those undergoing life terms were to
be released from jail to settle on the island, if their conduct
was satisfactory. While in prison they were to be given better
class food and clothes and after five years they were to bo
allowed to cook their own food with a little money to easen
their life !

Thus pressure from without and struggle from within
slackened the rigours and rigid rules of the Deathland !
