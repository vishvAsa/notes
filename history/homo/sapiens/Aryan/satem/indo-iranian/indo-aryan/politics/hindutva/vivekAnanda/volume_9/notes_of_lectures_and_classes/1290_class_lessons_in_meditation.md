*\[Mr. Frank Rhodehamel's notes of a class delivered in San Francisco,
California, on Monday, March 26, 1900\]*

The first point is the position. Sit with the spine perfectly free, with
the weight resting on the hips. The next step is breathing. Breathe in
the left nostril and out the right. Fill the lungs full and eject *all*
the breath. Clear the lungs of all impure air. Breathe full and deep.
The next thing is to think of the body as luminous, filled with light.
The next thing is to concentrate on the base of the spine, not from the
outside, but look down the spinal column inside to the base of the
spine.
