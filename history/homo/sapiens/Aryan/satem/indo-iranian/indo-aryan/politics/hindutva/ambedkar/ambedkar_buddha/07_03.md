> § 1. The Appointment of a Successor
>
>  1. The Exalted One was at one time sojourning among the Sakyans,
> in the mango grove of the Sakyan family named the archers.  
>  2. Now at that time Nataputta the Nigantha had just died at Pava.
> And at his death the Niganthas became disunited and divided into two
> parties, in mutual strife and conflict, quarrelling and wounding each
> other with wordy weapons.  
>  3. Now Chunda, the novice, having passed the rainy season at Pava,
> came to see the venerable Ananda and said, "Nataputta, sir, the
> Nigantha had just died at Pava. And he being dead, the Niganthas have
> become disunited and divided and are quarrelling and wounding one
> another. This is because they are without a protector."  
>  4. Then said the venerable Ananda, "Friend Chunda, this is a
> worthy subject to bring before the Exalted One. Let us go to him, and
> tell him about it."  
>  5. "Very good, sir," replied Chunda.  
>  6. So the venerable Ananda and Chunda, the novice, sought out the
> Exalted One; and saluting him, told him about the Niganthas, and
> pleaded the necessity of appointing a successor.  
>  7. The Blessed Lord, on hearing what Chunda had said, replied,
> "But consider, Chunda, where a teacher hath arisen in the world,
> Arahat, supremely enlightened; where a doctrine hath been well set
> forth, well imparted, effectual for guidance, conducive to peace; but
> where his disciples have not become proficient in good Norm, nor has
> it been made a thing of saving grace to them, well proclaimed among
> men when their teacher passes away.  
>  8. "Now for such a teacher to die, Chunda, is a great affliction
> for his disciples, and a great danger to his Dhamma.  
>  9. "But consider, Chunda, where a teacher has appeared in the
> world who is all-enlightened; where the Norm has been well set forth,
> well imparted, effectual for guidance, conducive to peace; and where
> the disciples have become proficient in the good Norm, and where the
> full scope of the higher life has become manifest to them when that
> teacher passes away.  
>  10. "Now for such a teacher, Chunda, to die, is not an affliction
> for his disciples. Why then have a successor?"  
>  11. When Ananda raised the same question on another occasion, the
> Blessed Lord said, "What think you, Ananda? Do you observe even a
> couple of almsmen at variance about what I have taught?"  
>  12. "No. But those who are about the Lord might, after his death,
> stir up quarrel in the confraternity respecting the regimen or of the
> code, and such quarrels would make for general grief."  
>  13. "Of little concern, Ananda, are quarrels respecting rigours of
> regimen or of the code; it is possible quarrels in the confraternity
> about the path which really matter," said the Blessed Lord.  
>  14. "These disputes about the path cannot be settled by a
> dictator. What then a successor can do, unless he acts as a
> dictator?  
>  15. "The controversies regarding the path cannot be settled by a
> dictator.  
>  16. "The decision of a controversy should be reached by the
> fraternity. The whole conjoint body should assemble and thrash out the
> matter till there is agreement, and then to settle it conformably with
> such agreement.  
>  17. "Majority agreements is the way to settle the disputes, and
> not the appointment of a successor."
>
>   
> § 2. The Last Convert
>
>  1. Now at that time Subhadda the Wanderer was staying at Kusinara.
> And Subhadda the Wanderer heard the rumour, "This very day, it is
> said, in the last watch of the night, will be the final passing away
> of Gautama the recluse." Then this thought came to Subhadda the
> Wanderer:  
>  2. "Thus have I heard it said by other wanderers who are old and
> far gone in years, both teachers and disciples, 'Rarely, rarely do
> Tathagatas arise in the world, they who are Arahats, fully Enlightened
> Ones. And here tonight, in the last watch, will be the final passing
> away of Gautama, the recluse. Now a doubt has arisen in my mind and I
> am assured of Gautama, the recluse. Gautama, the recluse, can show me
> a teaching, so that I may dispel this doubting state of mine."  
>  3. Then Subhadda the Wanderer went towards the branch road to the
> Sala grove of the Mallas, where the venerable Ananda was, and coming
> there he told the venerable Ananda what he had thought, and he
> exclaimed, "O Master Ananda! If only I could get a sight of Gautama
> the recluse!"  
>  4. At these words the venerable Ananda said to Subhadda the
> Wanderer, "Enough, friend Subhadda! Trouble not the Master! The
> Exalted One is wearied."  
>  5. Then a second and yet a third time did Subhadda the Wanderer
> make the same request, and got the same reply.  
>  6. Now the Exalted One overheard this talk between the venerable
> Ananda and Subhadda the Wanderer. And he called to the venerable
> Ananda, saying, "Enough, Ananda! Prevent not Subhadda. Let Subhadda be
> permitted to see the Tathagata. Whatsoever Subhadda shall ask of me,
> he will ask it all from a desire to know, not from a desire to trouble
> me. And whatever I shall say in answer, that will be quickly
> understood."  
>  7. So then the venerable Ananda said to Subhadda the Wanderer, "Go
> you in, friend Subhadda. The Exalted One gives you leave."  
>  8. So Subhadda the Wanderer went in to the Exalted One, and coming
> to Him greeted Him pleasantly, and after the exchange of friendly
> compliments he sat down at one side. So seated, Subhadda the Wanderer
> thus addressed the Exalted One:  
>  9. "Master Gautama, all those recluses and Brahmins who have
> followings and companies of listeners, who are teachers of companies,
> well known, renowned founders of sects, esteemed as holy men by the
> multitude, men like Purana Kassapa, Makkhali of the Cow-pen, Ajita of
> \[the\] hairshirt, Kacchayana of the Pakudha tree, Sanjaya, son of
> Belatthi, and Nigantha of the Natha clan--have all these, as they say,
> realised by their own knowledge the truth of things; or have they not,
> one and all, so realised; or have some realised and others not
> realised it, by their own knowledge?"  
>  10. "Let be, Subhadda! Trouble not yourself about such things, as
> to whether one and all or some have realised or not. I will show you
> the Norm, Subhadda. Do you listen carefully. Apply your mind. I will
> speak."  
>  11. "Even so, Lord," said Subhadda the Wanderer, and gave heed to
> the Exalted One. Then the Exalted One said this:  
>  12. "ln whatsoever Norm-discipline, Subhadda, the Ariyan Eightfold
> Path is not found, therein also no recluse is found. And in whatsoever
> Norm-discipline, Subhadda, the Ariyan Eightfold Path is found, therein
> also is found a recluse.  
>  13. "Now in this Norm-discipline (of mine), Subhadda, the Ariyan
> Eightfold Path is found. Herein also is found a recluse of these four
> degrees. Void of recluses are the other sects of disputants. But if,
> Subhadda, in this one, brethren were to live the perfect life, the
> world would not be void of arahats.  
>  14. "My age was nine and twenty years when I went forth to seek
> the Good.  
>  15. "Now fifty years and more are gone, Subhadda, since I left the
> world to range the Norm of Righteousness."  
>  16. And when he had thus spoken, Subhadda the Wanderer said to the
> Exalted One, "Most excellent are these words of thy mouth, most
> excellent.  
>  17. "Just as if a man were to set up that which is thrown down, or
> were to reveal that which is hidden away, or were to point out the
> right road to him who has gone astray, or were to bring a lamp into
> darkness, so that those who have eyes can see.  
>  18. "Just even so, has the truth been made known to me by the
> Exalted One. And I, even I, betake myself to the Exalted One as my
> refuge, to the truth, and to the Order."  
>  19. "Whosoever, Subhadda, has formerly been a follower of another
> doctrine and thereafter wishes to enter the Order, remains on
> probation for the space of four months."  
>  20. "If that is the rule, I too will remain on probation."  
>  21. But the Exalted One said, "I acknowledge the difference in
> persons." So saying, he called the venerable Ananda and told Ananda,
> "As it is, Ananda, receive Subhadda into the Order."  
>  22. "Even so. Lord," said the venerable Ananda, in assent to the
> Exalted One.  
>  23. And Subhadda the Wanderer said to the venerable Ananda, "Great
> is your gain, friend Ananda, great is your good fortune, friend
> Ananda, in that you all have been sprinkled with the sprinkling of
> discipleship in this brotherhood at the hands of the Master
> himself."  
>  24. " The same is true of you, Subhadda," replied Ananda.  
>  25. So Subhadda the Wanderer was received into the Order under the
> orders of the Exalted One. He was the last disciple whom the Exalted
> One himself converted.
>
>   
> § 3. Last Words
>
>  1. Then said the Exalted One to the venerable Ananda,  
>  2. " It may be, Ananda, that you will say: 'Gone is the word of
> the Master: we have no longer any Master now!' But you must not so
> regard it, Ananda; for the Norm and discipline taught and enjoyed by
> me, they shall be your teachers when I am gone.  
>  3. "Now, Ananda, whereas the brethren have the habit of calling
> one another ' friend'--when I am gone this habit must not be followed.
> By an elder brother, Ananda, a brother who is a novice should be
> called by his name or clan name or by the word 'friend'; but by a
> novice, Ananda, an elder brother should be addressed as 'Lord' or
> 'Your reverence.'  
>  4. "Again, Ananda, if the Order so desires, when I am gone, let it
> abolish the lesser and minor charges.  
>  5. "You know, Ananda, the brother Channa. How obstinate, perverse
> and devoid of the sense of discipline he is.  
>  6. "And to him, Ananda, let the extreme penalty be applied when I
> am gone."  
>  7. "What, Lord, do you mean by 'the extreme penalty'?"  
>  8. The brother Channa, Ananda, whatever he may say, is not to be
> spoken to, not to be admonished, not to be instructed by the brethren.
> He should be left alone. It might improve him."  
>  9. Then the Exalted One addressed the brethren:  
>  10. "It may be, brothers, that in the mind of some one brother
> there is doubt or perplexity, either about the Buddha, or about the
> Norm, or the Order, or the Path, or the Way to the Path. If it be so,
> brothers, do ye ask now. Be not hereafter remorseful at the thought,
> 'Here was our Master face to face with us, and yet we had not the
> heart to question the Exalted One, though we were in His very
> presence.'"  
>  11. At these words the brethren were silent.  
>  12. Then a second time, and yet a third time did the Exalted One
> address the brethren in the same words. And a third time the brethren
> were silent.  
>  13. Then said the Exalted One: "May be, brethren, it is out of
> respect for the Master that ye ask not. Speak to me, then, as friend
> to friend, brethren."  
>  14. Whereat those brethren were silent.  
>  15. Then exclaimed the venerable Ananda to the Exalted One:
> "Strange it is, Lord! A marvel it is, Lord! Thus assured am I, Lord,
> of this Order of Brethren. There is not any one brother that has a
> single doubt or perplexity as to the Buddha, the Norm, the Order, or
> as to the Path, or the Way to the Path."  
>  16. "You speak out of assurance, Ananda. But in the Tathagata
> there is knowledge of the fact. There is not in any one brother a
> single doubt or perplexity as to this. Of these five hundred brethren
> of mine, Ananda, even he who is the most backward is a stream-winner,
> one who is assured from the Downfall, assured of reaching the Supreme
> Wisdom."  
>  17. Then said the Exalted One to the brethren:  
>  18. "Come now, brethren, I do remind ye, 'Subject to decay are all
> compounded things.' Do ye abide in heedfulness."  
>  19. Those were the last words of the Exalted One.
>
>   
> § 4. Ananda in Grief
>
>  1. As age advanced, the Blessed Lord required a personal attendant
> to look after him.  
>  2. He first chose Nanda. After Nanda he chose Ananda, who served
> as his personal attendant till his death.  
>  3. Ananda was his constant and dearest companion, not merely an
> attendant.  
>  4. When the Blessed One came to Kushinara and rested between the
> Sal trees, he saw that his end was coming near, and felt that it was
> time he took Ananda into confidence.  
>  5. So he called Ananda and said, "And now this, Ananda: at the
> third watch of the night, in the Uppavana of Kushinara. between the
> twin Sal trees, the utter passing away of the Tathagata will take
> place."  
>  6. And when he had thus spoken, the venerable Ananda addressed the
> Blessed One, and said, "Vouchsafe, Lord, to remain during the Kalpa, O
> Blessed One, for the good and the happiness of the great multitudes,
> out of pity for the world, for the good and the gain and the weal of
> gods and men."  
>  7. Three times did Ananda make his plea. "Enough now, Ananda,
> beseech not the Tathagata!" was the reply. "The time for making such
> request is past."  
>  8. " I, Ananda, am now grown old, and full of years, my journey is
> drawing to a close. I have reached my sum of days. I am turning eighty
> years of age; and just as a worn-out cart must give way some day,
> methinks the same must happen to the body of the Tathagata." Hearing
> this, Ananda left.  
>  9. Not seeing Ananda, the Blessed One called the brethren, and
> said: "Where then is Ananda?" "The venerable Ananda is gone and is
> weeping," said the brethren.  
>  10. And the Blessed One called a certain brother and said, "Go now
> brother, and call Ananda in my name, and say, 'Brother Ananda, the
> Master calls for thee.'"  
>  11. "Even so, Lord!" said that brother.  
>  12. When Ananda came back, he took his seat by the side of the
> Blessed One.  
>  13. Then the Blessed One said to Ananda, "Enough, Ananda! Do not
> weep! Have I not already, on former occasions, told you that it is in
> the very nature of things most near and dear unto us that we must
> divide ourselves from them, leave them, sever ourselves from them?  
>  14. " For a long time, Ananda, you have been very near to me by
> acts of love, kind and good, beyond all measure.  
>  15. "You have done well, Ananda! Be earnest in effort, and you too
> shall be free from the great evils--from sensuality, from
> individuality, from delusion, and from ignorance."  
>  16. Then addressing the brethren about Ananda, the Blessed One
> said: "He is a wise man, brethren, is Ananda.  
>  17. "He knows when it is the right time to come and visit the
> Tathagata, and when it is the right time for brethren and sisters of
> the Order, for devout men and devout women, for a king, or for a
> king's ministers, for other teachers and disciples, to visit the
> Tathagata.  
>  18. "Brethren, there are these four special things about Ananda.  
>  19. "All are happy to visit Ananda. They are filled with joy on
> beholding him; they are happy to hear him. They are ill at ease when
> Ananda is silent."  
>  20. After this Ananda again returned to the subject of the passing
> away of the Tathagata. Addressing the Blessed One, he said, "Let not
> the Blessed One die in this wattled and daub town in the midst of the
> jungle. For, Lord, there are great cities, such as Champa, Rajagraha,
> Savathi, Saketa, Kosambi, and Benares. Let the Blessed One die in one
> of them. "  
>  21. "Say not so, Ananda! Say not so, Ananda. This Kushinara,
> Ananda, was the capital of king Maha-Sudassana, under the name of
> Keshavati."  
>  22. Thereafter the Blessed One gave Ananda two errands.  
>  23. He told Ananda to see that belief does not spread that the
> Blessed One died as a result of the food given to Him by Chunda. He
> feared that Chunda might suffer. He asked Ananda to disabuse the mind
> of the public on this score.  
>  24. The second thing he told Ananda was to inform the Mallas of
> Kushinara that the Blessed One had arrived there, and would pass away
> in the last watch of the night.  
>  25. "Give no occasion to reproach yourself. The Mallas may say:
> 'In our own village the death of our Tathagata took place; and we did
> not know, and had no opportunity of seeing him in his last hours.'"  
>  26. Thereafter the venerable Anurudha and the venerable Ananda
> spent the rest of the night in religious discourse.  
>  27. And in the third part of the night, as previously announced,
> the Blessed One breathed his last.  
>  28. When the Blessed One died, the brethren and Ananda stretched
> out their arms and wept, and some even fell headlong on the ground,
> rolling to and fro in anguish, saying: "Too soon has the Blessed One
> died! Too soon has the Happy One passed away from existence! Too soon
> has the Light gone out of the world!"  
>  29. It was at midnight on Vaishakha Paurnima that the Blessed Lord
> breathed his last. The year of his death was 483 B.C.  
>  30. As the Pali text truly says:
>
> > > *Diva tapati addicco*  
> > > *Ratin abhati candima;*  
> > > *Sannaddho khathio tapati*  
> > > *Jhayi tapati brahaman;*  
> > > *Atha Sabbain ahorattain*  
> > > *Buddho tapati tejasa.*
>
>  31. "The sun shines only in the day, and the moon makes bright the
> night. The warrior shines when he is in his armour. And the Brahmin
> when he is meditating. But the Buddha shines over all, by day as well
> as by night, by his own glory.  
>  32. "He was beyond question the light of the world."
>
>   
> § 5. The Lament of the Mallas and the Joy of a Bhikkhu
>
>  1. As desired by the Blessed One, Ananda went and informed the
> Mallas of the event.  
>  2. And when they heard of this, the Mallas, their wives, their
> young men and maidens, were grieved and sad and afflicted at heart.  
>  3. Some of them wept, dishevelling their hair, and stretched forth
> their arms and fell prostrate on the ground.  
>  4. Then the Mallas, with their young men and maidens and their
> wives, went to the Sala grove in the Upavaana to have the last look of
> the Blessed One.  
>  5. Then the venerable Ananda thought: "lf I allow the Mallas of
> Kushinara one by one, it will take a long time for them to pay homage
> to the dead body of the Blessed One."  
>  6. So he decided to arrange them in groups, family by family. Each
> family then bowed humbly at the feet of the Blessed One and parted.  
>  7. Now at the time the venerable Maha Kassapa was journeying along
> the high road from Pava to Kushinara with a great company of the
> brethren.  
>  8. Just at the time a certain naked ascetic was coming along the
> high road to Pava.  
>  9. And the venerable Maha Kassapa saw the naked ascetic coming in
> the distance; and when he had seen him he said to the naked ascetic,
> "O friend! Surely thou knowest our Master?"  
>  10. "Yes, friend! I know him. This day the Samana Gautama has been
> dead a week!"  
>  11. Immediately on hearing the news the brethren were overcome
> with grief, and started weeping.  
>  12. Now at that time a brother named Subhadda, who had been
> received into the Sangh in his old age, was seated in their company.  
>  13. And this Subhadda addressed the brethren and said: "Enough
> brethren! Weep not, neither lament! We are well rid of the great
> Samana. We used to be annoyed by being told, 'This beseems you, this
> beseems you not.' But now we shall be able to do whatever we like; and
> what we do not like, that we shall not have to do! Isn't it good he is
> dead? Why weep, why lament? It is a matter of joy."  
>  14. So great and harsh a disciplinarian the Blessed One was.
>
>   
> § 6. The Last Rites
>
> 1\. Then the Mallas of Kushinara said to the venerable Ananda: "What
> should be done with the remains of the Tathagata?"  
>  2. "As men treat the remains of a king of kings, so should you
> treat the remains of the Tathagata" replied Ananda.  
>  3. "And how do they treat the remains of a king of kings?"  
>  4. Ananda told them: "They wrap the body of a king of kings in a
> new cloth. When that is done they wrap it in cotton-wool. When that is
> done they wrap it in a new cloth and so on till they have wrapped the
> body in five hundred successive layers of both kinds. Then they place
> the body in an oil vessel of iron and cover that close up with another
> oil vessel of iron. They then build a funeral pile of all kinds. This
> is the way in which they treat the remains of a king of kings."  
>  5. "So be it," said the Mallas.  
>  6. Then the Mallas of Kushinara said: " It is much too late to
> burn the body of the Blessed One today. Let us now perform the
> cremation tomorrow."  
>  7. And the Mallas of Kushinara gave orders to their attendants,
> saying: "Make preparations for the funeral of the Tathagata, and
> gather perfumes and garlands and the musicians of Kushinara."  
>  8. But in paying honour, reverence, respect, and homage to the
> remains of the Tathagata with dancing, and hymns and music, and with
> garlands and perfumes; and in making canopies of their garments, and
> preparing decoration wreaths to hang thereon, they passed the second
> day too, and then the third day, and the fourth and fifth and the
> sixth day also.  
>  9. Then on the seventh day the Mallas of Kushinara thought: "Let
> us carry the body of the Blessed One, and let us perform the cremation
> ceremony."  
>  10. And thereupon eight chieftains among the Mallas bathed their
> heads, and clad themselves in new garments, with the intention of
> acting as pall-bearers carrying the body of the Blessed One.  
>  11. They carried the dead body to the Shrine of the Mallas, called
> Makuta-bandhana; to the east of the city, and there they laid down the
> body of the Blessed One and set fire to it.  
>  12. After some time the mortal remains of the Blessed One were
> reduced to ashes.
>
>   
> § 7. Quarrel Over Ashes
>
>  1. After the body of the Blessed One had been consumed by fire,
> the Mallas of Kushinara collected the ashes and the bones of the
> Blessed One, and placed them in their Council Hall with a lattice work
> of spears and with a rampart of bows; and guarded them against anybody
> stealing them or any part of them.  
>  2. For seven days the Mallas paid honour and reverence and respect
> and homage to them with dance and song and music and with garlands and
> perfumes.  
>  3. Now the King of Magadha, Ajatasatru, heard the news that the
> Blessed One had died at Kushinara.  
>  4. He, therefore, sent a messenger to the Mallas with a request
> for a portion of the relics of the Blessed One.  
>  5. Similarly messengers came from the Licchavis of Vaishali, from
> the Sakyas of Kapilavastu, from the Bulis of Attakappa, from the
> Koliyas of Ramagama, and from the Mallas of Pava.  
>  6. Among the claimants for ashes there was also a Brahmin of
> Vethadipa.  
>  7. When they heard these claims, the Mallas of Kushinara said: "
> The Blessed One died in our village. We will not give away any part of
> the remains of the Blessed One. They belong to us."  
>  8. Seeing that the situation was tense, a Brahmin, by name Dron,a
> intervened and said: "Hear, reverend sirs, one single word from me."  
>  9. Said Drona: "Forbearance was our Buddha to teach; unseemly is
> it that over the division of the remains of him who was the best of
> beings, strife should arise, and wounds, and war!  
>  10. "Let us all, sirs, with one accord unite in friendly harmony,
> to make eight portions. Widespread let stupas arise in every land,
> that the Enlightened One from all parts be reverenced."  
>  11. The Mallas of Kushinara agreed and said: "Do thou then, O
> Brahmin, thyself divide the remains equally into eight parts, with
> fair division."  
>  12. "Be it so, sir!" said Drona in assent.  
>  13. And he divided the remains of the Blessed One equally into
> eight parts.  
>  14. After making the division, Drona said to them: "Give me, sirs,
> this vessel. I will set up over it a stupa."  
>  15. And they agreed to give the vessel to him.  
>  16. Thus the ashes of the Blessed One were shared, and the quarrel
> was settled peacefully and amicably.
>
>   
> §8. Loyalty to the Buddha
>
>  1. Shravasti was the occasion \[=location\] (of these
> events)....  
>  2. Now on that occasion a number of monks were busied with .making
> a robe for the Exalted One, with this idea: When the robe is finished,
> in three months' time, the Exalted One will go forth on his rounds:  
>  3. Now at that time Isidatta and Purana, the chamberlains, were
> staying at Sadhuka on some business or other. Then they heard the
> news: "They say that a number of monks are busied with making a robe
> for the Exalted One with this idea: When the robe is finished, in
> three months' time, the Exalted One will go forth upon his rounds."  
>  4. So Isidatta and Purana, the chamberlains, stationed a man on
> the high-road (thus instructing him): "Now, good fellow, as soon as
> you see that Exalted One, that Arahat, that perfectly Enlightened One
> coming along, do you come and inform us."  
>  5. So after standing there two or three days that man saw the
> Exalted One coming along, while yet some distance off, and he went to
> inform the chamberlains, Isidatta and Purana, saying: "Here comes my
> lord, the Exalted One, that Arahat, that perfectly Enlightened One!

>  10. "Again, lord, when we learned that the Exalted One would leave

>  11. "On hearing that the Exalted One would leave the Mallas and go

>  13. "And when we heard that he was actually going his rounds in

>  14. (They continue to trace the Master's steps from Kasi to the
> Vajji...from the Vajji to the Mallas...from the Mallas to the
> Kosalans, in like terms.)  
>  15. " But, Lord, when we heard that the Exalted One would be going
> on his rounds from the Kosalans to Savatthi, we were delighted and
> elated at the thought: Now the Exalted One will be quite near us!  
>  16. "Then, when we heard: 'The Exalted One is staying at
> Shravasti, at Jeta grove, in Anathapindika's Park'--then, Lord,
> boundless was our delight and boundless our elation at the thought:
> The Exalted One is near us!"
