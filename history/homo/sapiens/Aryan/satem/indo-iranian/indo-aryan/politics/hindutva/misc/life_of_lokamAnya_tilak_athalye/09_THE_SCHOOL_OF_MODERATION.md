While the Social Reformers were remarrying widows 
and breaking castes with the ultimate object of 
making the people fit for political rights, Mr. Tilak was 
labouriouly striving to infuse vigour into the public mind 
by his passionate appeals to the great traditions of our 
History, Religion and Society. He inaugurated the 
Ganapati and the Shivaji festivals, which in spite of the 
bitter attacks of Moderates and the hostile attitude of 
the Government have now come to form a permanent 
feature of the social life of Maharashtra. These festivals 
deserve to be recorded as Mr. Tilak 's memorable contri- 
butions to our public life. 

The Ganapati festival, started in 1893 appealed to 
the religious instincts of the masses and to the religious 
and patriotic instincts of the educated people in Maha- 
rashtra. It has now taken a permanent place in the 
social life of the people and affords annually a common 
platform to the masses and the classes. It supplies 
healthy intellectual food to the ignorant masses. It 



THE SCHOOL OF MODERATION Ir^y 

trains up the youth of the country in organisation, 
public work and pubUc spirit. Lectures, processions, 
singing parties are the invariable accompaniments of 
the festival and they not only afford an outlet to the 
religious zeal of the people but help in fostering the 
national sentiment also and in creating an interest in the 
-outstanding questions of the day. The Reformers and 
Moderates have stood aloof from the festival and have 
misunderstood its aims and objects and its place in the 
work of the national uplift. But their opposition has 
no more arrested the popularity of the -festival than the 
howlings of the Anglo-Indian press ; nor have they 
succeeded in establishing its connection with Anti- 
Mahomedan spirit. Mr. Tilak has come and gone. 
But the bent he has given to a religious festival, 
converting it into a social and national force, 
.abides and will forever testify to his organizing genius. 
Our District and Provincial Conferences have not 
yet won a place in the life of the people and have 
been held only at odd places and have been attended 
only by the so called " educated " people. But the 
Ganapati festival is celebrated in every city, town and 
village and has more powerfully moulded the life of 
the people than any Congress organisation. 

From out the heroes who moulded Maratha History 
stands out one personality in bold relief. Brahmins 
adore him ; non-Brahmins claim him as their own. 
Mr. Ranade the great apostle of Moderation has sung 
his praises in a work that still abides. The Indian states 
which are scattered over Maharashtra owe their exis- 
tence to his efforts. Mr. Tilak therefore thought that 
round the personality of Shivaji, he could gather all the 



JO LOKAMANYA TILAK 

patriotic and national forces. The inspiration which 
western democratic teachings gave to us Was rather weak 
and essentially outlandish. But the worship of Shivaji 
was such as even the ignorant villager could understand. 
The name of Shivaji was a symbol of unity, courage^ 
sacrifice. It connoted the highest patriotic fervour. 
It stood for complete political emancipation. Shivaji 
and Swaraj were synonymous words. By starting the 
Shivaji festival in 1895, Mr. Tilak stimulated the Na- 
tional instincts of the people. He gave to a m.essage 
to the people freed from the puzzling verbiage of west- 
em democracy and which being simple and direct 
went straight to their hearts. 

The first public meeting that was held in connection 
with the Shivaji memorial was organised by Mr. Tilak 
and was attended by the leading Chiefs of Maratha 
States as also by the leading Jahagirdars and the 
Inamdars of the Deccan. It was attended or blessed 
by the leading Reformers of the day. The Spiritual 
Descendant of Saint Ramdas honoured with it with 
his presence. Some Mahomedans also attended in 
true fraternal spirit. High and low, rich and poor, 
persons of every caste and creed flocked to do 
homage to the memory of the hero. 

But this unity of sentiment was short-lived. Such 
a rallying point evidently scared the Bureaucrats. 
In 1897 Mr. Tilak was convicted for having pub- 
lished * a few verses (descriptive of an imaginery 
message of Shivaji) and a report of his speech 
at the Shivaji festival. Since that time a large 
portion of those people whose happiness and posi- 
tion in life depended upon Bureaucratic goodwill^ 



THE SCHOOL OF MODERATION IO7 

have thought it prudent to remain aloof from the festi- 
val. The Moderates too, were afraid to co-operate 
with Mr. Tilak. In spite of these circumstances, the 
Shivaji festival has become a permanent feature of the 
public life of Maharashtra ; at times it has been cele- 
brated even beyond the bounds of the Bombay Presi- 
dency, — in Bengal and in Japan. It will ever remain a 
permanent source of inspiration to the people. 

Up to 1893, inspite of acute Social Reform contro- 
versies, there was no split among the Congressmen. 
But the outbtrcak of the Hindu-Mahomedan riots 
created an unfortunate breach. Mr. Tilak was the first 
to assert that the riots were the direct outcome of the 
divide-and-rule policy, which a section of the officials 
had inaugurated. Anxious to fasten the responsibility 
on others, the Anglo-Indians and some of the officials 
threw the blame on the movement of cow-protection^ 
with which they had persuaded themselves that Mr. 
Tilak was associated. With the possible exception of Sir 
Pherozeshah Mehta and the Hon. Mr. RahimtuUa. 
Sayani, most of the Bombay politicians, later known 
by the unenviable title of Moderates, meekly gulped' 
down this pill. They chafed at Mr. Tilak for having 
blurted out the truth. They had not the courage 
even of refuting the connection which was sedulously 
sought to be established between the riots and the cow- 
protection Societies, though, a few months later, even 
the Government of Bombay ' hesitated to accept ' the 
view. The unpleasantness engendered in the course 
of these controversies, was aggravated by the Congress 
controversies at Poona (1895). To top this aU came 
the dissensions in the Poona Sarvajanik Sabha, where 



lOB LOKAMANYA TILAK 

^anade had established his supremacy in i88g. 
As so often happens in India, aSairs in the 
Sabha had degenerated into cliquism. In 1895, 
however, Mr. Tilak secured a majority among 
the members. This incensed the rulers of the 
Sabha. They were long accustomed to have 
things in their own way and had no desire to 
Vbe ruled by Mr. Tilak. They, therefore, set up 
the " bewitching cry " of " compromise, as if there was 
anything to compromise at all." Prof. Gokhale under- 
took the mission of the Peacemaker. But he made 
the initial mistake of dictating terms to the victorious 
party. Knowing that his partisans were in utter 
minority, Mr. Gokhale should have proposed terms at 
least as favourable to Mr. Tilak's party as to his own. 
But he went a step further. He proposed three terms : 
(i) The Managing Committee of the Sabha should be 
composed of equal members from both the parties (2) 
The Chairman should continue to be same (that is a 
Moderate) and (3) There should be three Secretaries 
instead of the usual number of two and of these three 
only one should represent the majority. This attempt 
to hoodwink Mr. Tilak failed ; and the chafing Mode- 
rates wrecked their venegeance by practically ousting 
Mr. Tilak from the Secretaryship of the Poona Con- 
gress. But even this did not satisfy them. Unaccus- 
tomed to play the second part, they resolved rather 
to secede from the Sarvajanik Sabha than co- 
operate with Mr. Tilak. They pressed Ranade to 
allow them to start a new Political Association ; and 
after prolonged hesitation and against his better 
judgment Ranade at last sanctioned the formation of 



THE SCHOOL OF MODERATION I09» 

the Deccan Sabha (Nov. 1895) and thus perpetuated 
the split. 

We are prepared to concede that a frank and friendly 
secession is far better than surface-unity and so wide is 
the room for work in this country that even a hundred 
associations are welcome. To start a new association, 
however, is one thing ; and to do so after making dis- 
ingenuous insinuations against an established one is 
quite another ; and this is what the importunities of 
his whining followers led the great Ranade to do. 
Mr. Tilak severely criticised this conduct. He said : — 

" We have been accustomed to the terms, Moderates 
and Extremists in Social Reform controversies. But we 
refuse to accept these artificial differences in Politics. 
Is Mr. Tilak going to destroy the British Government ? 
Are Mr. Ranade and Prof. Gokhale going to be its 
saviours ? To plume oneself as a Moderate and to say 
that others are running after the impossible and insinuate 
that they are actuated by seditious motives shows the 
height of imprudence. If ever the Sabha has " run 
after the impossible " and has shown " extremist lean- 
ings " it was in Prof. Gokhale's regime. It had to make 
amends by tendering an apology. Mr. Ranade ought 
to know that the Sabha incurred suspicion of disloyalty 
when he himself was guiding its policy. All of us 
know how he had to move heaven and earth to remove 
the blot. Should he, knowing all this, now come for- 
ward and because he cannot command a majority in the 
body, throw aspersions at the Sabha ?" 

This then was the formal birth of the Moderate 
party. It was this disunity between the " Moderates " 
and the " Extremists " that emboldened the Bureau- 



110 LOKAMANYA TILAK 

cracy to take advantage of the psychological moment 
offered by the Poona murderers (1897) and launch on 
a policy of widespread repression in the Presidency. 
Immediately after resuming (4th July 1899) the editor- 
ship of the Kesari, after his one year's incarceration, 
Mr. Tilak made a powerful appeal to the ' Moderates ': — 
" When, two years back, the political school of Mode- 
ration sprang into existence, we had presaged as much. 
Some of our critics had blamed us for our pessimism, but 
our prophesy was fully borne out .... However, let 
bygones be bygones. Let us turn over a new leaf now. 
We find that owing to the disorders due to the plague 
and to the angry attitude of the Government, all our 
movements have come to a standstill. If we mean to 
revive them, our first duty is to close up our ranks. 
Like the crows of the fable, we, each of us, call our- 
selves peacocks. Only our opponents are crows ! But 
there is the eagle of the Bureaucracy in the sky, bent 
on confounding us, crows, peacocks and all. Should 
not the experience of the last two years make us wiser? 
There are some papers who pride themselves on their 
moderation, because they have not been prosecuted 
in 1897. ^^* i^ ^^ necessary for us to say why and how 
they escaped scot-free ? They should at least look to 
the Gile's circular before satisfying themselves of their 
innocence. Both the political parties are agreed as to 
the rights we want to get from the rulers. Both are 
agreed as to the need of demanding these rights from 
the Government and of educating the people to make 
such demands. If this is so, where is the room for 
"' Moderation " and " Extremism "? None of us ever 
dreams of breaking or transgressing the laws of the 



THE SCHOOL OF MODERATION III 

land while demanding our rights. What then is the 
difference ? ... Already the Government has restrict- 
ed our liberty of speech. It is suicidal, therefore, to 
•emphasise our political differences. . . . Let us not 
keep aloof from each other by creating false doubts and 
differences .... (Kesari July 4th 1899). 

Apparently the appeal fell on deaf ears : for nine 
years later, we find history repeating itself ! An open 
rupture, a bomb outrage and a policy of terrible repres- 
sion ! Shall India never learn the evils of disunion ? 

At a metting organised at Poona to do honour to 
Mr. (now Hon. Mr. ) R, P. Paranjpye on his return from 
Cambridge, poor Mr. Tilak was not even invited ! The 
organisers of the meeting were more anxious to obtain 
the recognition and patronage of the Government ! 

This, however, was only a straw, though indicative 
of the direction, in which the wind was blowing. Vari- 
ous such instances can be quoted. When Lord San- 
dhurst was about to retire (1900 Feb.), the usual ques- 
tion of a public address and a pubhc memorial was dis- 
cussed. Dr. Bhalchandra and Mr. (Dr. Sir) Chandavar- 
kar led the movement. Mr. (Sir) Dinshaw Wacha and 
Mr. (Hon. Sir) Chimanlal Setalwad were strongly 
against it, but seeing the attitude of their master, the 
Lion of Bombay, they had to yield. Ranade was 
diplomatic. He took no part in the controversy. He 
pleased himself and Lord Sandhurst by a garden- 
party. This demoralisation in the public life of the 
Presidency intensely pained Mr. Tilak. Nothing sur- 
prised him more than the attitude of Sir (then Mr.) 
Pherozeshah who had strongly opposed such a move- 
ment when Sir Richard Temple and Lord Harris were 



112 LOKAMANYA TILAK 

about to retire. Evidently the Lion was fast becoming- 
domesticated. 

The effect of this demoraUsed Bombay public atmos- 
phere on Indian politics was indeed unfortunate. The 
leaders of other Provinces had the greatest respect for 
Ranade and Mehta and implicitly followed them ; and 
when Mehta himself was losing his old fire, need we 
wonder that a change for the worse came over the 
Congress Party ? 

This weakening of spirit came precisely when the 
Bureaucracy and the Nation had just begun their 
struggle. Ever since 1896 Mr. Tilak had been trying 
hard to induce the Congress to change its time-honoured 
methods and show a little more grit. While the nu- 
cleus of the New Party in the Congress was being formed 
the patriarches of the Congress showed unmistakable 
signs of a reactionary spirit ; so much so that when at 
the Lucknow Congress (1899) Mr. Tilak wanted to 
move a resolution condemning the regime of Lord 
Sandhurst, a storm of opposition was raised. Mr. 
Tilak challenged a single delegate of the Congress ta- 
prove that His Lordship's tenure of office had not been 
ruinous to the people of the Bombay Presidency. None 
dared take up the challenge. He quoted the misdeeds 
of the Bureaucracy one by one and asked his opponents 
to say where he was exaggerating our grievances, and 
yet Mr. R. C. Dutt, the President and many other dele- 
gates were violently against Mr. Tilak's proposition. 
One clever person hinted that the subject was one of 
the Provincial interest only, and so the Congress could 
not be expected to take it up. Mr. Tilak quoted a 
number of cases where provincial matters had occupied 



THE SCHOOL OF MODERATION. Xl^ 

the attention of the National body. Nonplussed, the 
Congress leaders resorted to their usual tactics. The 
President threatened to resign the presidential post if 
Mr. Tilak persisted in the matter. Not liking to bring 
matters to a head, Mr. Tilak withdrew his proposition. 
At the Satara Provincial Conference, (May 1900) Mr. 
Tilak again sought to move the following resolution : — 

" That this Conference desires to place on record its 
deep sense of regret that during the last few years, the 
Government of Bombay should have been pleased to 
adopt a retrograde policy of repression and distrust, as 
evidenced by Press prosecutions, arrests and imprison- 
ments of persons without trial, widening of the powers 
of the Police . . . and it earnestly prays for a speedy 
return to the Policy of Progress . . . which had 
characterised the best traditions of British Rule in 
India." 

Here, too, the President, Mr. Gokuldas K. Parekh, per- 
haps remembering how most of the leaders of Bombay 
had been associated with the Sandhurst Memorial 
movement sought to suppress the Resolution by 
threatening to resign his post. The opposition at last 
was reconciled on one condition. The resolution, though 
not formally moved, was recorded in the proceedings 
of the Conference. This was surely creditable to 
Mr. Tilak whose party commanded an overwhelming 
majority. Out of 180 delegates, as many as 
124 had sided with Mr. Tilak and had signed the re- 
quisition sent to the President of the Conference. 

It will thus be seen that self-interest, timidity 
" policy " induced most of the Congress leaders to 
forget their duties and responsibilities to the people 
8 



XI4 LOKAMANYA TILAK 

For such contemptible opportunism, they tried to 
temper the tone of the Congress which they had nur- 
tured with true paternal tenderness and solicitude. 
arhe Congress thus lost its prestige and shattered its 
own popularity and became a " mutual admiration 
society." Its resolutions instead of being the echoes 
of the national sentiment, were the decrees of a coterie, 
none too active or progressive. Its Presidents came to 
be selected with a view to secure Government recogni- 
tion. Mr. Chandavarkar, who had kept himself 
aloof from the Congress ever since 1890, was called 
upon (1900) to discharge the duties of the Congress 
President. Official emoluments came to be the stan- 
dard of Congress recognition ; and official wrath and 
persecutions, the mark of neglect by the Congress 
authorities. Mr. Chandavarkar, in spite of his ten 
years' desertion of the Congress, could become its Pre- 
sident (1900) because he was high in Government favour 
and was likely to be appointed Acting High Court Judge, 
Mr. Tilak, in spite of his 20 years' record of courageous 
and self-sacrificing public services, had his claims for 
the honour set aside, because the Bureaucracy had 
chosen to dislike him. 

This v/as a period of violent political reaction. Hardly 
had the discontent due to famine, plague and press- 
prosecutions begun to grow less acute when the re- 
gime of Lord Curzon which, in its beginnings, had 
raised great expectations, commenced to create a sense 
of resentment, to which there is no parallel in the 
earlier history of our public life. People, who were 
dazzled by Lord Curzon's personality, energy, and 
eloquence, found it to their cost, that these noble qua- 



THE SCHOOI. OF MODERATION 115 

lities were accompanied by an utter lack of sympathy 
and imagination and by a mistaken consciousness that his 
Lordship was specially sent on earth to consolidate the 
British Empire. To Lord Curzon's imagination, India 
appeared a mere pawn in the bigger game of extending 
England's sphere of influence over Asia and in the 
bUndness of his imperialistic ego, he failed to realise the 
growing awakening in the country. His attempts to 
win popularity with the ryols by huge expenditures on 
agriculture and irrigation and by reduction of salt-taa 
and the Income-Tax and by his ostentatious solicitude 
for equitable justice between the black man and his 
white master, were completely unsuccessful. His cal- 
lous neglect of the industrial regeneration of the country, 
his anxiety to control University education, his cynical 
reference to the PoUtical Movement of the day, his 
curt refusal to encourage Indians in higher ser- 
vice, his audacious interpretation of the Queen's Pro- 
clamation, his uncalled-for interference in Local self- 
Govemment, his reckless expenditure in the unneces- 
sary Durbar at Delhi, his rude refusal to receive the 
Congress-Deputation headed by Sir Henry Cotton, 
and to top all, the memorable Partition of Bengal — 
these and many other events of Lord Curzon's 
Viceroyalty created a delicate situation which, the 
Moderates were unable to cope with. Public disap- 
pointment was at its height. Even the late Mr. 
Hume, Father of the Congress felt it his duty to 
awaken the ' leaders ' from their inglorious apathy. 
Said he : — 

" It is by consistent and persistent importunity both 
in India and England that sooner or later, wearied out 



Il6 LOKAMANYA TILAK 

by your incessant appeals, the Government will be driven. 
to concede what are clearly your rights. 

*' You meet in Congress ; you glow with a momen- 
tary enthusiasm ; you speak much and eloquently. 
But the Congress closes and every man of you goes off 
straightv/ay on his private business ! Years ago, I 
called on you to be up and doing ; years ago, I warned 
you that * Nations by themselves are made ' and have 
you heeded these counsels ? You have, indeed, ever 
eagerly clamoured for and vainly clutched at the Crown 
but how many of you will touch the cross even with 
your finger-tips ?" 

And what was the response Sir Pherozeshah gave to 
the above passionate appeal ? Speaking as the Chair- 
man of the Reception Committee of the 20th National 
Congress at Bombay, he said : — 

" To those who decry the money spent upon the 
Congress as moneys wasted on a show and a tamasha, I 
would say, they are not men of real insight and true 

imagination If you realise it clearly and fully, 

there is no purpose more important, no mission more 
sacred than the one that the Congress fulfils in the 

three short days to which it confines its session 

We, delegates, representatives of this country, meet 
together, at the end of the year, to give voice to the 
pubhc opinion. 

*' But we are told that we have done this for long and 
we have done this in vain. I absolutely dispute both 
these propositions. ... To estimate the position 
rightly, let me lay before you (my) confession of Faith. 
I am an inveterate, and a robust optimist. . . I accept 
British rule, as Ranade did, as a dispensation so won- 



THE SCHOOL OF MODERATION II7 

derful. . . . that it would be folly not to accept it as a 
declaration of God's will. . . . We cordially confess that, 
in the main, England has chosen wisely and well.'* 

This attitude of self-satisfaction was strongly resented 
by Mr. Tilak. '* What hope is there " said he " when 
the rulers of the National Body frankly confess that 
the object of the Congress is nothing more than to 
focus the public opinion of the year 7" We can, how- 
ever, understand the difficulties of the Moderate leaders. 
It was a time of transition. The time-honoured 
methods of political life required to be replaced by a 
more militant form of agitation. That called for a 
type of courage, an amount of energy and activity, a 
degree of self-sacrifice, clearly wanting in the Moderate 
leaders. Altogether a new type of leadership was in 
requisition. But in the language of Napoleon : " the 
pear " was " not yet ripe." The psychological moment 
for Mr. Tilak to lead a frontal attack both against the 
Moderates as well as the Bureaucracy had not yet 
arrived. As Lord Curzon marched from one autocra- 
tic act to another, it slowly came nearer and nearer. 

Between 1899, when Mr. Tilak resumed his editorship 
of the Kesari and 1905, when the Partition of Bengal, 
carried out in haste and repented at leisure, put the 
final seal to the bitterness and helplessness that pre- 
vailed, Mr. Tilak's contribution to the public life was 
not what it could have been ; for from the middle of 
1901 to the close of 1904 he was involved in the earlier 
stages of the well-known Tai Maharaj case. He had 
to prepare the cases in the several suits, civil and crimi- 
nal, brought by or against him and had to examine 
witnesses on commission for months together at 



Tl8 LOKAMANYA TILAK 

Aurangabad, Amraoti and Kolhapur. The crimi*^ 
nal case alone engaged his attention for about tea 
months. 

Up to 1904, Mt. Tilak was only a Provincial leadeto 
The Partition of Bengal ushered into existence an agi- 
tation which gave birth to an All-India Party and by 
universal consent of friend and foe, Mr. Tilak cam©- 
to be the unquestioned leader of this party.
