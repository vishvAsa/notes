**12. About the Hindu critique of monotheism**

This final text was written just recently, after I was given a copy of
probably the first book containing a paper devoted specifically to a
position taken by Voice of India, viz. its critique of m Monotheism. 
This was a central theme in the work of the late Ram Swarup and has
remained so for those who have learned from him, including Sita Ram Goel
and Arun Shourie, the authors specifically studied in the paper under
consideration.

**12.1. Portrait of the India-watcher as a young lady**

In March 1998, a Miss Mitsuhiro Kondo, then a Ph.D. candidate in
Sociology at the University of Tokyo, visited Voice of India’s publisher
Sita Ram Goel for an interview.  Mr. Goel has a reputation for readily
grasping people’s motives and seeing through pretences, but he was quite
forthcoming in freely sharing his thoughts with this unknown visitor. 
In any case, if you have nothing to hide, why not speak out to all
corners?  Many a Hindu Revivalist keeps foreign (meaning Western)
interviewers at arms’ length, because most of them only come to collect
ammunition for some defamation job.  This young lady gave a more
open-minded impression, which was partly justified but is also partly
belied by the paper she ended up writing.

So, Mitsuhiro Kondo has written an overview of “the criticisms levelled
by present-day Hindu nationalists against what they call variously
‘monotheism’ or ‘Semitic religions’, and to analyse the structure of
their discourse as a logic of justification for hostilities”.  As we
shall see, her paper fails to make the crucial connection between the
critique and the “hostilities”.^([1](#1)) It is an old dictators’ trick
to associate criticism with crime and disorder, and too often we have
seen secularists reduced to this sleight-of-hand of identifying rational
criticism of Christianity and Islam with communal riots.  She does not
cite any evidence for such a connection.  Has she ever met a rioter who
gave his reading of a scholarly critique as his motive for rioting?  Or
even one who reads books to begin with?

Her paper is included in one of those over-numerous academic books on
communalism and “nation-building in South Asia”.  As a junior scholar,
she may have felt obliged to toe the line laid down by the book's
editor, Prof. Mushirul Hasan, and senior contributors like Prof.
Gyanendra Pandey.^([2](#2)) Maybe she tried to please her mentors by
taking a more hostile line to Hindu Revivalism than she meant to.  But
we only have her text in the published version, and unfortunately we
find that in essential traits, it is of one piece with the usual biased
discourse of the Nehruvian secularists.

**12.2. Many faces of Hindu Revivalism**

In spite of undeniable mistakes, Miss Kondo scores one or two notches
higher than most of India’s secularists and their Western loudspeakers. 
Thus, she takes the trouble to note (at some length) that the term
“Semitic religions” in this context means Christianity and Islam, but
not Judaism.  The recent crop of US-based Hindu-baiters are busy
adapting their rhetoric to American conditions, where Jewish opinion
carries a lot of weight, so they try to sow confusion around the
ambiguous term “Semitic”: though hard-boiled pro-Islamic anti-Zionists
themselves, they darkly hint that Hindu Revivalism, a long-standing ally
of Israel, is somehow “anti-Semitic”.  This new propaganda line hasn’t
reached Tokyo yet, or the young researcher has commendably spurned the
use of such cheap tricks.

She also admits that “the Hindu nationalist movement as we see it in
India today is as old and deep-rooted as it is diverse in
fonnll.^([3](#3)) Most secularists only mention the RSS and see all
other tendencies as mere tentacles of that organisation, not so much as
a tactic of “guilt by association” but simply because they never did the
mental exercise of distinguishing between the different tendencies
within Hindu Revivalism.  However, she loses sight of that initial
distinction by lumping Sita Ram Goel and Arun Shourie with cruder
variants of Hindu nationalism, e.g.: “(…) the Indian people - or the
*Hindu rashtra* (nation) as they prefer to say”, - though the authors
cited never use the term *Hindu Rashtra*, which is typical of Hindu
Mahasabha discourse and commonly used. in RSS literature.^([4](#4))

Our Japanese scholar misses a turn rather badly when she compares Guru
Golwalkar’s view of Islam and Christianity with that of what she calls
“the Goel/Shourie group”.  In her view, the former’s positions “bear a
striking resemblance to, and at times are identical to” those of the
latter.^([5](#5)) Not quite.  It is true that in criticizing
Christianity and Islam, Golwalkar *sometimes* managed to address the
question of the false truth claims on which these belief systems are
based, as Goel and Shourie have consistently tried to do.  But most of
the time, Golwalkar (and even more so the RSS as such and most of its
office-bearers) has gone on questioning the loyalty of Christians and
Muslims, hammering at their foreign origins and “anti-national”
tendencies.  He never busied himself with informing the Indian public
about the findings of modern scholarship which undermine the core
beliefs of Christianity and Islam, as Goel and Shourie have done in a
respectable number of hefty volumes.

Therefore, it is the very opposite of the truth to deduce that “the
common structure between these two ideological currents \[viz. 
Golwalkar and Goel/Shourie\], separated by several decades as they are,
highlights the core of the Hindu nationalist movement: ethnicism or
exclusive particularism”.^([6](#6)) And it is likewise untrue that Goel
and Shourie are playing a “role” within a grand Hindutva strategy, viz.
as Gamekeeper of “the hard-line position of ethnic
exclusivism”.^([7](#7))

In sharp contrast with the repetitive-nationalistic and Indocentric
approach of Golwalkar and the RSS, Goel and Shourie (and Ram Swarup
before them) have developed a historical and philosophical critique of
Christianity and Islam that has universal validity.  It is part of
continuum with Western and other foreign critiques of the said
religions.  The belief that Prophet Mohammed heard Allah’s very own
message, or that Jesus was God’s only-begotten son who freed mankind
from sin by his death and resurrection, remains false regardless of
whether you study the matter in India or in Europe.  The finding that
Christians are using many means fair and foul in order to convert
Hindus, or that Muslims have destroyed numerous Hindu temples, remains
true regardless of whether you study the data in a dusty Hindu ashram or
in an air-conditioned classroom in Tokyo.  Neither the Japanese author
nor her Muslim and secularist mentors in India have ever managed to pick
a hole in the advanced criticism of Christianity and Islam.

Of course, the approach pioneered by Ram Swarup is “hard-line” in the
sense that it in not susceptible to change under the impact of changing
political configurations.  The BJP and RSS may decide one day that they
need to build bridges with padres and mullahs, but that doesn’t alter
the truth status of the latter’s belief systems.  The Voice of India
approach is unflinching in the same sense in which logic is *sharper*
than diplomacy, or uprightness is *tougher* than compromise, or a
diamond is *hardier* than mud.  But that has nothing to do with
harshness and hatred at the human level. I have rarely met such humanly
warm people as the authors criticized by our scholar from Tokyo.

**12.3. Postmodernism and the facts**

But let us now focus on elements in her paper which are problematic.  We
need not make much of her gullible acceptance of Christian missionary
image-building with “love and service”. if that was all there is to it,
there would be no tension in areas of high Christian missionary
activity, as any researcher into an ongoing conflict ought to
understand.  The thought that an aversion to a religion may be based on
experience with that religion, or on verifiable facts about that
religion, doesn’t seem to cross her mind.

And then, like India’s true secularists, she goes on to insinuate that
the impression of “violent tendencies inherent in Islam”, is based on
mere “clichés about jihad” which are “bandied about” by Goel and
Shourie.^([8](#8)) This, then, is the most serious flaw of her whole
argument: the willful confounding of perceptions and facts, of
subjective and objective.  The jihadic pattern is a central *fact* of
Islamic doctrine and history, not somebody’s funny little cliché.  The
violent tendencies of Islam are not a propaganda bandied about by some
querrulants, but a daily fact of life for Hindus in Jammu or Dhaka.  It
is simply impossible to understand Hindu Revivalism for people who are
adamant about disregarding or denying these *facts*.

But our aspiring secularist is clearly uncomfortable with facts, as is
evident from her diagnosis of the Hindu “use and abuse of ‘historical
facts’”.  Like all secularists, but with even less camouflage, she has
to make do with insinuations that something is wrong with the
“historical facts” (quote marks hers) cited by Hindu authors, because
she is unable to prove any of them false.  She can do no more than
notice how “the destruction of temples, the compulsory conversion and
persecution by Islamic rulers, and so forth, are held up for all to see
as attesting to the ‘essence of Islam’, all but eclipsing the equally
historical ‘fact’ that Islam and Hinduism have enjoyed a peaceful
coexistence in many parts of the subcontinent”.^([9](#9))

Notice how she keeps on putting the word “facts” in quotation marks,
even when referring to something which she herself clearly believes to
be factual, i.c. the “peaceful coexistence” of Islam and Hinduism.  That
is post modernism for you: there are no facts, only *constructs*.  She
condemns herself to misunderstanding the Hindu movement which she claims
to be studying because she refuses to acknowledge its basis in factual
experience, replacing it all with subjective impressions and sheer
propaganda.  Thus, “present conditions in India give *all this talk* of
violence and menace by alien cultures and religions a certain appeal to
the ordinary people”, while “the critique of Pakistan is fed by concrete
images of the military power of Pakistan affecting the daily life of the
people of India”.^([10](#10))

Why not admit straightaway that the violence suffered by Hindus from
Pakistan-sponsored terrorists is a plain fact and therefore also a
legitimate Hindu concern?  Either there is something fishy about the
“facts”, and in that case an author conveying an opinion about them to
the readers should spell out clearly how these claimed “facts” are in
dissonance with reality.  Or alternatively, if no fault can be found
with these “facts”, they should simply be treated as facts.  Finally, if
an author has no time or space to verify and discuss the reality of the
alleged facts, a humble admission should be made that it is simply too
early for him or her for a serious evaluation of policies and discourses
based on them.  But the entire corpus of secularist writing on the Hindu
Revivalist position vis-à-vis Christianity and Islam violates this
simple rule.

**12.4. Criticism and violence**

In four whole pages devoted specifically to the “violence” aspect of the
Goel/Shourie critique, Mitsuhiro Kondo’s text meanders around the
definition of “Hindu nationalism” (a term which she finds more
appropriate than “Hindu fascism” or “Hindu fundamentalism”), but shifts
her attention from the said authors altogether to focus on Veer
Savarkar’s much-discussed booklet *Hindutva* (1923) instead.  And while
Savarkar was all for “militarization” of the Hindus (which is not the
same thing as sheer “violence”, but let that pass), even then she
doesn’t manage to show any link between Hindu nationalist doctrine and
its alleged violent edge.

So, we are left with no choice but to conclude with a rather different
kind of quotation.  As a Japanese, Miss Kondo informs us that she or any
of her compatriots is “too close ideologically to the Indian (... ) to
claim that the Hindu nationalists’ critique of ‘monotheism’ is
*completely and radically different* from the consciousness that informs
the everyday religious, cultural, political and economic life of
Japan”.^([11](#11)) So, both Hindus and Japanese are too sane and
mentally relaxed to get obsessed with the unicity of God and the need to
destroy His multiplicity among communities who have not yet been
infected with that obsession.

And finally, we learn that “the fundamental rationality of the ideology
of Hindu nationalism has, at least in part, already won for itself the
approval of history”.  Indeed: “As many scholars have pointed out, it
would be far off the mark to dismiss the Hindu nationalist movement as a
merely ‘reactionary’ or ‘fanatic and deviant movement of the poor or
deprived brainwashed by grotesque teachings’.”^([12](#12)) If any
expression could sum up what animates Ram Swarup, Sita Ram Goel, Arun
Shourie and related authors in their critique of monotheism, it would
precisely be their caring concern for fellow human beings “brainwashed
by grotesque teachings”.
