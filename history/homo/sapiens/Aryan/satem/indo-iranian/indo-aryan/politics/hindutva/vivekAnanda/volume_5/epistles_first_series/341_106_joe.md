## CVI

THE MATH, BELUR,  
*18th June, 1901*.

DEAR JOE, (Miss Josephine MacLeod.)

I enclose with yours an acknowledgement of Mr. Okakura's money — of
course I am up to all your tricks.

However, I am really trying to come, but you know — one month to go —
one to come — and a few days' stay! Never mind, I am trying my best.
Only my terribly poor health, some legal affairs, etc., etc., may make a
little delay.

With everlasting love,

VIVEKANANDA.
