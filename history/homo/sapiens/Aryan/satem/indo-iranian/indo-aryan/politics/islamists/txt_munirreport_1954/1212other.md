12\) Other incidents

 a.) Other incidents of an Islamic State are that all sculpture,
playing of cards, portrait painting, photographing human beings, music,
dancing, mixed acting, cinemas, and theatres will have to be closed.
Thus says Maulana Abdul Haleem Qasimi, representative of
Jami'at-ul-Ulama-i-Pakistan: --

> "Q:-- What are your views on *tashbih* and *tamseel*?  
> A.-- You should ask me a concrete question.  
> Q.--What are your views on *lahw-o-la'b*?  
> A.-- The same is my reply to this question.  
> Q.-- What are your views about portrait painting?  
> A.-- There is nothing against it if any such painting becomes
> necessary.  
> Q.-- What about photography?  
> A.-- My reply to it is the same as the reply regarding portrait
> painting.  
> Q.-- What about sculpture as an art?  
> A.-- It is prohibited by our religion.  
> Q.-- Will you bring playing of cards in *lahw-o-la'b*?  
> A.-- Yes, it will amount to *lahw-o-la'b*.  
> Q.-- What about music and dancing?  
> A.-- It is all forbidden by our religion.  
> Q.-- What about drama and acting?  
> A .-- It all depends on what kind of acting you mean. If it involves
> immodesty and intermixture of sexes, the Islamic law is against it.  
> Q.-- If the State is founded on your ideals, will you make a law
> stopping portrait painting, photographing of human beings, sculpture,
> playing of cards, music, dancing, actingm and all cinemas and
> theatres?  
> A.-- Keeping in view the present form of these activities, my answer
> is in the affirmative."

  
 b.) Maulana. Abdul Haamid Badayuni considers it to be a sin
(*ma'siyal*) on the part of professors of anatomy to dissect dead bodies
of Muslims to explain points of anatomy to the students.

 c.) The soldier or the policeman will have the right, on grounds
of religion, to disobey a command by a superior authority. Maulana Abul
Hasanat's view on this is as follows: --

> "I believe that if a policeman is required to do something which we
> consider to be contrary to our religion, it should be the duty of the
> policeman to disobey the authority. The same would be my answer if
> 'army' were substituted for 'police'.  
> Q.-- You stated yesterday that if a policeman or a soldier was
> required by a superior authority to do what you considered to be
> contrary to religion, it would be the duty of that policeman or the
> soldier to disobey such authority. Will you give the policeman or the
> soldier the right of himself determining whether the command he is
> given by his superior authority  
> is contrary to religion?  
> A.-- Most certainly.  
> Q.- -Supposc there is war between Pakistan and another Muslim country
> and the soldier feels that Pakistan is in the wrong and that to shoot
> a soldier of the other country is contrary to religion. Do you think
> he would be justified in disobeying his commanding officer?  
> A.-- In such a contingency the soldier should take a *fatwa* of the
> *ulama*."

  
 d.) We have dwelt at some length on the subject of Islamic State
not because we intended to write a thesis against or in favour of such
State, but merely with a view to presenting a clear picture of the
numerous possibilities that may in future arise if the true causes of
the ideological confusion which contributed to the spread and intensity
of the \[recent anti-Ahmadi\] disturbances are not precisely located.
That such confusion did exist is obvious because otherwise Muslim
Leaguers, whose own Government was in office, would not have risen
against it; a sense of loyalty and public duty would not have departed
from public officials who went about like maniacs howling against their
own Government and officers; respect for property and human life would
not have disappeared in the common man, who with no scruple or
compunction began freely to indulgc in loot, arson and murder;
politicians would not have shirked facing the men who had installed them
in their offices; and administrators would not have felt hesitant or
diffident in performing what was their obvious duty.

If there is one thing which has been conclusively demonstrated in this
inquiry, it is that provided you can persuade the masses to believe that
something they are asked to do is religiously right or enjoined by
religion, you can set them to any course of action, regardless of all
considerations of discipline, loyalty, decency, morality, or civic
sense.

 e.) Pakistan is being taken by the common man -- though it is
not -- as an Islamic State. This belief has been encouraged by the
ceaseless clamour for Islam and an Islamic State that is being heard
from all quarters since the establishment of Pakistan. The phantom of an
Islamic State has haunted the Musalman throughout the ages, and is a
result of the memory of the glorious past when Islam, rising like a
storm from the least expected quarter of the world -- the wilds of
Arabia -- instantly enveloped the world, pulling down from their high
pedestal gods who had ruled over man since the creation, uprooting
centuries-old institutions and superstitions, and supplanting all
civilisations that had been built on an enslaved humanity.

What is 125 years in human history -- nay, in the history of a people --
and yet, during this brief period Islam spread from the Indus to the
Atlantic and Spain, and from the borders of China to Egypt, and the sons
of the desert installed themselves in all old centres of civilisation --
in Ctesiphon, Damascus, Alexandria, India and all places associated with
the names of the Sumerian and the Assyrian civilisations.

Historians have often posed the question: what would have been the state
of the world today if Muawiya's siege of Constantinople had succeeded,
or if the proverbial Arab instinct for plunder had not suddenly seized
the *mujahids* of Abdur Rahman in their fight against Charles Martel on
the plains of Tours in Southern France. Maybe Muslims would have
discovered America long before Columbus did, and the entire world would
have been Moslemised; maybe Islam itself would have been Europeanised.
It is this brilliant achievement of the Arabian nomads, the like of
which the world had never seen before, that makes the Musalman of today
live in the past and yearn for the return of the glory that was Islam.

He finds himself standing on the crossroads, wrapped in the mantle of
the past and with the dead weight of centuries on his back, frustrated
and bewildered and hesitant to turn one corner or the other. The
freshness and the simplicity of the faith, which gave determination to
his mind and spring to his muscle, is now denied to him. He has neither
the means nor the ability to conquer, and there are no countries to
conquer. Little does he understand that the forces which are pitted
against him are entirely different from those against which early Islam
had to fight, and that on the clues given by his own ancestors, the
human mind has achieved results which he cannot understand.

He therefore finds himself in a state of helplessness, waiting for
someone to come and help him out of this morass of uncertainty and
confusion. And he will go on waiting like this without anything
happening. Nothing but a bold re-orientation of Islam, to separate the
vital from the lifeless, can preserve it as a World Idea, and convert
the Musalman into a citizen of the present and the future world, from
the archaic incongruity that he is today.

 f.) It is this lack of bold and clear thinking, the inability to
understand and take decisions, which has brought about in Pakistan a
confusion which will persist, and repeatedly create situations of the
kind we have been inquiring into, until our leaders have a clear
conception of the goal and of the means to reach it. It requires no
imagination to realise that irreconciliables remain irreconciliable even
if you believe or wish to the contrary. Opposing principles, if left to
themselves, can only produce confusion and disorder, and the application
of a neutralising agency to them can only produce a dead result.

Unless, in case of conflict between two ideologies, our leaders have the
desire and the ability to elect, uncertainty must continue. And as long
as we rely on the hammer when a file is needed, and press Islam into
service to solve situations it was never intended to solve, frustration
and disappointment must dog our steps. The sublime faith called Islam
will live even if our leaders are not there to enforce it. It lives in
the individual, in his soul and outlook, in all his relations with God
and men, from the cradle to the grave; and our politicians should
understand that if Divine commands cannot make or keep a man a Musalman,
their statutes will not.
