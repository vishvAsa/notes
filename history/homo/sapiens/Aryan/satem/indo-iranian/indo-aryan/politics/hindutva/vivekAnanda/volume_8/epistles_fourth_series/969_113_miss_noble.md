## CXIII

*To Sister Nivedita*

JAMMU,  
*3rd November, 1897*.

MY DEAR MISS NOBLE, (This was the last letter received in England by
Sister Nivedita.)

. . . Too much sentiment hurts work. "Hard as steel and soft as a
flower" is the motto.

I shall soon write to Sturdy. He is right to tell you that in case of
trouble I will stand by you. You will have the whole of it if I find a
piece of bread in India â€” you may rest assured of that. I am going to
write to Sturdy from Lahore, for which I start tomorrow. I have been
here for 15 days to get some land in Kashmir from the Maharaja. I intend
to go to Kashmir again next summer, if I am here, and start some work
there.

With everlasting love,

Yours,  
VIVEKANANDA.
