Yours of the 25th June has duly reached and gave me great pleasure. I am
so glad to see the noble work progressing. I had learnt with the
greatest delight from Mrs. Bull of the work that is going to be done in
Cambridge this winter and no better person could have been selected to
direct it as yourself. May all power attend you. I will be only too glad
to write for the magazine from time to time and my first instalment was
to be in a few weeks, when I hope to get some leisure. Certainly it goes
without saying that no one of the types we call religious ought to die â€”
they like races require fresh infusion of blood in the form of ideas. It
is wonderful to be able to sympathise with others from their standpoints
of view.

By this time Goodwin and the other Swami must have reached America. They
I trust will be of help to you in your noble work. Godspeed to all good
work and infinite blessings on all workers for good. 

Yours ever in the truth,

VIVEKANANDA.
