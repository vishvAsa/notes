**2. The Residue of Islamism**

The most malevolent of these residues is Islamism, the residue of the
Muslim invasion of India spread over several centuries. Its basic tenets
are ultimately derived from the teachings of Islam which has so far
succeeded in sealing itself off from every shade of empiricism,
rationalism, universalism, humanism and liberalism, the hallmarks of
Hindu as well as modern Western culture. But in the context of India
where Islam failed in its mission of lasting conquest and total
conversion, these tenets have acquired a singularly sinister and
subversive character.

Let it be clear that the reference here is not at all to our Muslim
brethren who are our own flesh and blood, except for that microscopic
minority which takes pride in the purity of its Arab, Persian or Turkish
descent.^([1](#1)) Instead of being the proponents of Islamism, the
Muslims of India are its victims whom it is trying to use as vehicles of
its poisonous virulence. The vast majority of Indian Muslims were
converted to Islam by force or allurements. But the conversion did not
help them socially or culturally as their status today in India’s Muslim
society should amply prove. The Muslims of India, therefore, have to be
freed from rather than accused of Islamism.

What we mean by Islamism is a self-righteous psychology and a closed
cultural attitude which make it impossible for its converts to coexist
peacefully and with dignity with other people. There are many Hindus who
share several tenets of Islamism. On the other hand, there are many
Muslims who are frightened by Islamism and who would gladly join the
mainstream of Indian nationalism if they are freed from the whiphand
which a minority of theologians, politicians and hooligans has come to
wield in their community.

Those who want to know Islamism first-hand and in full measure are
referred to Shaikh Sir Mohammed Iqbal’s two long poems which he wrote
quite early in his career, and which earned for him the title of Allama
among the adherents of this cult. These are the Shikwã and the
*Jawãb-i-Shikwah* which Mr. Khushwant Singh has recently published in an
English translation.

The *Shikwã* ends by summing up that *“naghmã hindî hai tau kyä, lai tau
hijazi hai mirî”*, that is, “no matter if my idiom is Indian, my spirit
is that of Hijaz”. Hijaz is that part of Arabia in which Mecca and
Medina are situated.

The *Jawãb-i-Shikwah* ends on a still more strident note. Allah
announces to the Allãmã His supreme message for mankind in the following
words: *“kî wafã tûne muhammad se tau ham tere hain”*, that is, “if you
are faithful to Muhammad, I shall be faithful to you.”

Now, there are many Muslims in India who have never heard the name of
Iqbal or listened to his muse. And there are many Hindus whose
admiration for Iqbal is immeasurable. No, Islamism does not refer to any
particular section of Indian society. It refers to that intellectual-or
unintellectual-attitude which awards the monopoly of truth and virtue to
a particular prophet, and consigns all knowledge to the pages of a
particular book.

Taking our cue from Allãmã Iqbal and his lesser cohorts like Altãf
Hussain Hãlî, we can safely summarise the credo of Islamism in the
following five fundamentals:

> 1\. That Indian society before the advent of Islam was living in utter
> spiritual, moral and cultural darkness (*jãhilîya*) like pre-Islamic
> Arabia;
>
> 2\. That Islam brought to India the *only* true religion, the *only*
> authentic moral values, the *only* humane culture, and the *only*
> progressive social order;
>
> 3\. That this civilizing mission of Islam in India could not be
> completed, as in many other lands of Asia and Africa, due to the
> intervention of the wily British who cheated Islam of its empire in
> India, mostly by means of fraud;
>
> 4\. That while the creation of Pakistan has been a triumph and
> consolidation of the power of Islam, west of the Ravi and east of the
> Hooghly, the conquest of India by Islam remains an unfinished task;
>
> 5\. That Islam has a right to use all means, including force, to
> convert this *Dãrul-harb* of an India into a *Dãrul-Islam*, so that a
> *Hakûmat-i-Ilãhiyah* could liquidate all traces of *jãhilîya* and
> impose the law and culture of Islam.

There are many Hindus like the late Pandit Sunderlal who fully accept
the first two fundamentals of Islamism. It is a different matter that
their logic fails them at this stage and they do not proceed to the next
three fundamentals which follow irrevocably. And there have been many
Muslims like the late Rafi Ahmed Kidwai and Justice M.C. Chagla who
rejects these fundamentals as repugnant.

Having thus outlined its version of past Indian history, and the
apocalypse towards which future Indian history should be forced to
travel, Islamism has evolved a strategy in which the Muslims of India
are envisaged as a base and an arsenal. Some salient features of this
strategy can be outlined as follows:

> 1\. The Muslims of India, particularly the Muslim intelligentsia,
> should be sealed off from every shade of rationalism, universalism,
> humanism and liberalism, and an army of mullahs and maulvis trained in
> the tenets of Islam should be let loose to brainwash and keep them
> along the right track;
>
> 2\. Every Muslim who does not accept Islamism or dares criticize it or
> stands for the mainstream of Indian nationalism, away from and above
> religious differences, should be denounced as a renegade and a
> legitimate victim for murderous Muslim mobs;
>
> 3\. The Muslims should be encouraged to air as many grievances as can
> be invented, and try to pass off as a down-trodden minority,
> oppressed, exploited and treated as second class citizens by the
> ‘brute’ Hindu majority;
>
> 4\. These contrived grievances of the Muslims should be used to
> convert the Muslim community into a compact vote-bank which can
> function as a balancing factor in as many electoral constituencies as
> possible, and which can blackmail all non-Islamist political parties
> to accommodate Muslim candidates or include the maximum measure of
> concessions to the Muslim community in their election manifestos;
>
> 5\. The Muslims should be made to agitate for India’s support to all
> international Islamic causes, right or wrong, legitimate or
> illegitimate, so that their attention is kept constantly diverted from
> demands of their own economic, social and cultural condition;
>
> 6\. The Muslims should be progressively persuaded and prepared to
> stage street riots on the slightest pretext, be it a stray pig, or
> music before a mosque, or Urdu, or the minority character of the
> Aligarh Muslim University, or a purely personal fracas between toughs
> belonging to two communities, or the bombing of al-Aqsa mosque in
> Jerusalem by an Austrian adventurer, or the hanging of Z.A. Bhutto by
> President Zia of Pakistan, or the capture of the Ka‘ba by some
> disgruntled faction in Saudi Arabian politics, or some other similar
> event in the Islamic world at large;
>
> 7\. The frequent riots should be used to frighten the Muslims who
> should then be coaxed to create, consolidate and extend exclusive
> Muslim enclaves which can be stocked with arms and ammunition,
> imported or otherwise.

The seven-fold strategy is aimed at the Muslims in India who are to be
brainwashed, blackmailed, frightened and forced into the fold of
Islamism. Another side of the same strategy has been worked out to
neutralise, paralyse and blacken or pamper different sections of Hindu
society so that the road is cleared for the forward march of Islamism. 
Some salient features of this secondary strategy can be outlined as
follows:

> 1\. The concept of Secularism which is enshrined in the Constitution
> of India and which has become the most sacred slogan for all our
> political parties should be distorted, misinterpreted and misused to
> the maximum to block out the least little expression of Hindu culture
> in the state apparatus and public life of India;
>
> 2\. The terms “communal” and “communalism” which have become terms of
> abuse in India’s political parlance, should be carefully cultivated
> and more and more mystified to malign all those organisations,
> institutions and parties which do not serve Islamism, directly and/or
> indirectly;
>
> 3\. The accusation of being fascists and anti-secularists should be
> hurled at all those individuals and organisations who question the
> exclusive claims of Islam and its culture, who know and tell the truth
> about Islamic scripture and history, and who see through the Muslim
> game of grievances;
>
> 4\. All praise and support should be extended to those Hindus who go
> out of their way to champion Islamic causes, national and
> international, and who see in Islam and its culture those higher
> values which Islamism claims for them;
>
> 5\. All available platforms should be used to defeat and frustrate the
> emergence of a genuine and positive Indian nationalism by always
> harping on India’s multi-racial, multi-religious, multi-language,
> multi-national, and multi-cultural character.

Islamism did make some headway among the Muslims in Independent India
mostly because the dominant section of Hindu intelligentsia partronised
it for various reasons. The Congress politicians patronised it because
they found out very soon that they were in a minority among the Hindus,
and that they could survive in power only by combining a solid Muslim
vote with whatever Hindu vote they could get. The Socialists went out of
their way to patronise it partly because they harbour an anti-Hindu
animus and partly in the hope of securing Muslim vote-a hope which has
not as yet come anywhere near fulfilment. The Gandhians partronised it
because they no more remembered that their great Master, Mahatma Gandhi,
was a Hindu with a profound faith in *Sanãtana Dharma*, and because they
misunderstood his doctrine of non-violence towards all people, including
the Muslims of India, as an endorsement of Islam. The Communists
patronised it because they saw in it a powerful ally in their campaign
against Hindu society which they viewed as their main enemy. The
self-alienated Hindu intellectuals patronised it out of sheer animus
towards Hindu society and culture which they were out to damn on any
pretext. Extending patronage to Islamism thus became a pastime for all
those who wanted to pass off as large-hearted liberals, progressives and
secularists.

But in the absence of local resources and international patronage, the
progress of Islamism in India was rather slow. Pakistan, which was its
only patron abroad, could not provide much help beyond some hysteria in
its mass media and propaganda in international political forums. The
several wars which India was forced to fight with Pakistan to the
disadvantage of the latter, also inhibited Islamism in India from
acquiring the requisite degree of self-confidence.

The use of oil as a political weapon by Islamic countries and the influx
of petro-dollars in plenty from several Arab countries, particularly
Libya and Saudi Arabia, since the early ‘seventies, has given to
Islamism in India a new glow of self-confidence in one sudden sweep.
This influx of Arab money is a natural and inevitable phenomenon
because, in the last analysis, Islamism is only another name for Arab
imperialism which had, at one stage of its history, pillaged and
populated with its own progeny many foreign lands and which even today
keeps many non-Arab nations spiritually enslaved.

Islamism in India is now busy employing to the maximum advantage the
Arab money which is pouring in through many channels and in increasing
quantities. Some of these uses are very obvious to the eye. A few
salient features of the new scenario can be listed as follows:

> 1\. The rapid rise of a powerful press, mostly in Indian languages,
> and many publishing houses to propagate Islamism;
>
> 2\. The generous funding of old and the founding of many new *maktabs,
> madrasas* and institutes for teaching Islam and training missionaries
> who are then employed at high salaries for purifying the faith of die
> Muslim flock and seeking new pastures for converts to Islam;
>
> 3\. Buying of land and real estate all around in urban and rural areas
> by individual Muslims and Islamic institutions and organisations at
> whatever prices available;
>
> 4\. Manufacturing and storing of arms in mosques, Muslim homes and
> localities and training of Muslim toughs;
>
> 5\. Holding of frequent conferences, national and international, and
> taking out demonstrations in support of every Islamic cause;
>
> 6\. Financing Muslim politics and inducing Muslim politicians to
> infiltrate and ingratiate themselves in every political party, and
> function from every public platform;
>
> 7\. Bribing secularist Hindu intellectuals, scribes public workers and
> politicians, and buying them up for supporting Islamism, denigrating
> Hindu culture, and character-assassinating those who oppose Islamism;
>
> 8\. Using the lure of money for winning converts to Islam from the
> weaker sections of Hindu society, particularly the Harijans.

The strategy is nothing new. The self-same strategy had been used by the
Muslim League for the carving out of Pakistan. Only the aid and abetment
which the British provided at one time have been replaced by the aid and
abetment from Arab countries. And in the matter of a mere decade,
Islamism in India has assumed the same menacing proportions as it had on
the eve of Partition. The parallel should make us pause.
