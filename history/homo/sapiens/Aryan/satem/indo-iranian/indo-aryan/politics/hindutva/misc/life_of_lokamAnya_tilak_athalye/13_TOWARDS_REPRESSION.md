"Who broke the Congress at Surat ?" In reply ^ 
we ask, " Who wanted to go back on the 
Calcutta resolutions ?" "Who hailed the Surat split 
with rapture ?" "Who wanted to rally round the 
banner of Lord Morley?" Not the least important 
question is " whose conduct was unconstitutional and 
un-Parliamentary ?" 

Mr. Tilak sends to the Chairman of the Congress 
Reception Committee a notice of adjournment with a 
constructive proposal. Writers on constitutional law 
hold that " a motion for adjourning the debate may be 
offered at any period of the discussion. Dr. Smith,* 
the great English authority on the subject remarks that 
on such occasions " the Chairman will feel bound to

put it (i.e. the motion of adjournment) to the vote." 
Mr. Malvi merely * thinks ' it to be * irregular and out 
of order '. Mr. Tilak asserts his right to speak. He is 
not allowed to proceed. The Chairman is anxious to 
gag him. TheTresident is impatient to read his address. 
Confusion drowns the rest. 

Regarding the diplomatic hurry shown by the Con- 
gress authorities in declaring Dr. Ghose duly elected, 
we may note that such incidents are by no means rare. 
Let Dr. Smith speak : — 

" Sometimes, especially at meetings, where the Chair- 
man and the party appointing him are anxious to have 
a certain resolution carried and wish to remove every 
opportunity for opposition to it, the Chairman will in- 
sist upon putting it to the vote, the moment it is moved 
and seconded ; and although some member claims to be 
heard before the votes are completely taken, the Chair- 
man goes on taking the votes and then tells the member 
that the question is now decided and he cannot speak 
to it because it is not before the meeting. In such a 
• case, the member should of course endeavour to attract 
the Chairman's attention in a way which the latter can- 
not ignore, and may then proceed to speak in spite of 
the Chairman." 

Mr. Tilak's views on the relations between the 
Moderates and the Nationalists are sound and refresh- 
ing. He says* : — 

" Both the Moderates and the Nationahsts must 
remember that persons belonging to both the parties 
are actuated by a sincere desire to promote the welfare 
-of he country; and that none is deliberately working to

bring about the ruin of the country. If both parties start 
mth this assumption, if both are wilhng to accept the 
existence of difference of opinions as inevitable, and as 
constituting a healthy sign in the body politic, there 
would be less room for misunderstandings. Both the 
parties should realise that only in Unity there is safety 
and that this unity they have to keep in spite of acute 
differences of opinion. Neither should try to stamp 
out the other and both should, while exerting their 
utmost to get the upper hand in the National assemblies 
conducted by the united efforts of the Moderates and 
the Nationalists, never abuse their supremacy by try- 
ing to crush or cripple their opponents in the other 
party. The Moderates should remember that it 
is because the New Party has come into existence 
that the Bureaucracy condescends to " rally " themo 
The Nationahsts must understand that though the 
caution and hesitation of the Moderates is often galling 
to them, still their influence and prestige is not to be 
despised. If these are the advantages, which one gets 
from the other, there are some inevitable disadvantages 
also. The Nationahsts have generally to bear the 
brunt of political fight, but the rewards of the political 
warfare go invariably to the Moderates. By their asso- 
ciation with the Nationalists, the Moderates do sometime 
receive official taunts and frowns. When taken to taskp 
the Moderates must however poiut-black tell the autho- 
rities that though they differ in many important res- 
pects from the * Extremists *, still, so long as the latter 
are willing to co-operate with them, they would not 
part company. True, some of the Nationahsts have 
set up " Independence " as the ultimate goal of theht 



TOWARDS REPRESSION 183 

ambition ; but even Lord Morley does not find any- 
thing illegal in such " faiths and aspirations." True, 
also that some of the Nationalists preach boycott which 
is more than a boycott of British goods, still there is 
nothing wrong in the Moderates co-operating to the 
point both the parties are agreed. If these points are 
kept in mind, the unity between the two parties will be 
ever-lasting" . 

In contrast with these statesman-like utterances.lread 
the following petulant and short-sighted remarks of 
Dr. Rash Behari Ghose : — 

" The Extremist Party is an ominous shadow, which 
has projected itself over the future fortunes of the 

country It has no place in the pale of the 

Congress. Secession, therefore, is the only course 
open to it. (Turning to his brother Extremists, Dr. 
Ghose said) you may deny it, but I fear, you are in 
danger, slowly but surely of drifting into 
treason. "•!■ 

Immediately on his return to Poona from Surat, Mr. 
Tilak commenced collecting funds for starting a Nation- 
alist Daily (Marathi). The Paper — Rashtra-Mat — came 
out in June (1908) and in its very short career, justified 
its existence by bravely fighting for the National cause. 
About the end of February (1908) Mr. Tilak started on, 
what he intended to make, a long tour throughout all 

"^ Undelivered Presidential Address. Since the above lines 
were written. Dr. Ghose, alas, has passed away. He lived to 
nnderstand and appreciate the Nationalists and to recognise 
their place in the National Movement. Indeed, it may be con- 
fidently said that latterly, Dr. Ghose's agreed more with the 
views of Mr, Tilak than with those of his own " friend and 
master" the Hon. Sir Surendranath Banerjea.

Marathi-speaking districts of the Presidency in order 
to collect about five lakhs of rupees to put the Samartha 
Vidyalaya, the well-known National School on a sound 
basis. He went first to Sholapur and then to Barsi. 
He was extremely well-received and he collected a sum 
of Rs. 50,000. He had, however, to return to Bombay 
to give evidence (9th March) before the Royal Com- 
mission of Decentrahsation. The work of the Poona 
District Conference (20th, 21st, and 22nd March) 
then claimed his attention. Then came the work 
of organising the picketing at the liquor shops. 
This movement lasted for about a month. Then he 
attended the Provincial Conference at Dhulia. To top 
all, came the bomb (30th April), changing the political 
atmosphere in its entirety. It threw the shadow of 
misfortune and failure over every public activity. The 
Samartha-Vidyalaya was subsequently suppressed by 
the Government (1910). 

Mr, Tilak's pithy and closely-reasoned evidence before 
the Decentralization Commission concluded thus : — 

" The mere shifting of the centre of power and autho- 
rity from one official to another is not, in my opinion 
calculated to restore the feelings of cordiality between 
the officers and the people, prevailing in earlier days. 
English Education has created new aspirations and 
ideals amongst the people and so long as these national 
aspirations remain unsatisfied, it is useless to expect 
that the hiatus between the officers and the people 
could be removed by any scheme of official Decentraliz- 
ation. In is no remedy — not even a palliative against the 
evil complained of, nor was it put forward by the people 
or their leaders. The fluctuating wave of Decentralize 



TOWARDS REPRESSION 185 

-mtion may infuse more or less life in the individual 
members of the Bureaucracy, but it cannot remove the 
growing estrangement between the rulers and the 
ruled, unless and until the people are allowed more and 
more effective voice in the management of their own 
affairs in an ever expansive spirit of wise liberalism and 
wide sympathy, aiming at raising India to the level of 
Self-Go verning countries." 

The Poona District Conference, which met on 20th, 
2 1st and 22nd March, 1908 bespeaks the resource- 
fulness, patience, tact and the organizing power of Mr. 
Tilak. Immediately on his return from Surat, while 
the dust of controversy still darkened all quarters, he 
sent round his lieutenants all over the district and 
established Taluka Associations. Two months of pro- 
poganda work left nothing to be desired either in the 
thoroughness of the preparations or in the representa- 
tive character of the delegates who attended the Con- 
ference from different parts of the district. But that 
the Moderates should have, so soon after the breach at 
Surat stood on the same political platform with Mr. 
Tilak is as great a compliment to their good sense as 
to Mr. Tilak's tact in managing men. Perhaps the 
Moderates felt it their duty to accept what they might 
have thought to be Mr. Tilak's challenge and so they 
mustered strong. They must, however, have been 
surprised to find the intellectual tenacity and political 
zeal of the delegates hailing from the nooks and corners 
of the district. The late Rao Bahadur Joshi, the famous 
Statistician, was the President. Fourteen Resolutions 
were passed. One of them appealed to the leaders of 
the various parties to sink, differences and restore 



l86 LOKAMANYA TILAK 

unity in the National Congress. Another resolution 
advocated the Swadeshi and Boycott movement ; an 
attempt was made to substitute the words " boycott of 
foreign goods ** for the words ** the Boycott movement" 
but it met with a miserable failure. A resolution on 
National Education was also passed and a strong Com- 
mittee was appointed to work it out. Most of the re- 
solutions were mandates to the people and not appeals 
to the Government. " Self-reliance, no mendicancy ** 
was the watch- word of this Conference. It was resol- 
ved to take steps to encourage sugar mdustry in Poona;. 
to make an industrial survey of the district, to start at 
least 25 primary schools during the course of one year, 
to encourage arbitration and discourage liquor. Alto- 
gether a nice programme of work, unluckily required to 
be totally shelved by the coming of the bomb. 

It was a nice and most inspiring speech that Mr. Tilak 
delivered in the District Conference on the " Evils of 
Drink." He ridiculed the idea of carrying on "a 
Temperance propaganda " by means of magic lantern 
performances and like otlier methods. These methods 
according to him, were «!dl right in countries having the 
hereditary poison of drink in their blood. But where^ 
as in India, morality, religion, social opinion, instinct 
and heredity were strongly against the use of 
liquor, picketing was the only way to rouse indivi- 
dual, social as well as the Abkari conscience. ^ He 
wound up his speech with an impassioned appeal to the 
young men sitting opposite in the gallery. The effect 
was electric. A band of youths formed themselves 
into a Volunteer corps and spontaneously started peaceful 
picketing before the principle liquor-shops of Poona. It 



TOWARDS REPRESSION 187 

would be a mistake to suppose, that this movement 
was merely impulsive. Years since, it had been in ex- 
istence ; the Swadeshi movement, which in its wider 
significance was a movement for the reconstruction of 
the National Life, made it powerful. Especially in 
Thana, Belgaum and Ahmednagar, systematic efforts 
had been made to check the evil of drink. It was, 
however, reserved, for the picketng movement to make 
*' Temperance " which in Indian Vernaculars always 
means total abstinence, a hve issue. Within less than 
a fortnight, it was estimated that the sale of liquor in 
Poona City was all but stopped. It was impossible 
that the keepers of the liquor shops would take this 
agitation lying down. They tried their best to put 
obstacles in the way of the Volunteers. But cautious, 
tactful and well-disciplined that the volunteers were, 
they worked in spite of rebufifs, insults and provoca- 
tions. The experiences of the Swadeshi picketing at 
Calcutta had taught them not to court any collision 
with the Police ; and in their well-meant efforts, they 
could rely upon the support and advice of three differ- 
ent sections of people, the Nationalists, the Moderates 
and Loyahsts of the type of Dr. Mann and the Rev. Mr. 
MacNickel the purity of whose motives at least was sO 
far as the Bureaucrats were concerned beyond question. 
The Volunteers worked under the direct supervision of 
the Poona Temperance Society, whose members, be- 
sides framing stringent rules for the observance of the 
Volunteers took special care to see that those rules were 
scrupulously observed. The Volunteers were selected 
after careful inquiry ; the work they were set to do was 
<:arefully apportioned. They were strictly directed to 



LOKAMANYA TILAK 



preach peacef^lly and modestly to persons entering the 
liquor shops. On no account were they to use intimi- 
dation or force. A deputation consisting of the Hon. Mr. 
Gokhale, Mr. Tilak, the Rev. Mr. MacNickel and others 
waited on the then Collector of Poona to discuss the 
rules and it is said that in accordance with some of his 
suggestions, certain changes were introduced therein ; 
and still as ill-luck would have it, in spite of every care, 
caution and foresight exercised, more than 40 Volun- 
teers out of about 150 working in the City were hauled 
up before the Magistrate and convicted and fined for 
having disobeyed orders of the Police. Technically 
they were offenders ; for the Police had ordered them 
to stop picketing, which they had refused to do. 
Undoubtedly, the Policeman has got the power to 
order any person to quit a place where he is standing 
on a public street. But where such an order is given 
tDnly to disallow a peaceful citizen from doing a peaceful 
legitimate and philanthrophic duty, conscientious per- 
sons will feel bound to dis-obey such orders. In this con- 
nection, it should be remembered that in Europe and 
America, pickets are allowed even to enter liquor-shops 
and there do their work. 

The movement spread like-fire in the whole of Maha- 
rashtra and in the enthusiasm .that it awakened, even 
Swadeshi and Boycott were for a time forgotten. But 
the custodians of law and order, afraid that it would 
lead to disorder, took early steps to " suppress picket- 
ing." At Lonavla (near Poona) the District Magistrate 
issued an order (nth April 1908) under Section 144 of 
the Criminal Procedure Code, enjoining people not to 

congregate and loiter daily in the vicinity of the coun* 



.'((

try liquor shops at Karla and Lonavla with the purpose 
of preventing customers from entering the shops." The 
Magistrate wanted to save " persons lawfully resorting" 
to the liquor-shops from annoyance. On or about 
April 17th, instructions were issued to the Poona 
Police to suppress the movement. 

On April 23rd, a huge meeting of about 12,000 persons 
was held, under the Presidency of Dr. Bhandarkar to 
protest against the high-handedness of the District 
Magistrate and to devise means of continuing the work 
thus interrupted. A deputation consisting of Dr. 
Bhandarkar, Mr. Tilak, the Rev. Mr. MacNickel and 
others was appointed to meet the Governor who received 
members of the Deputation (In the mean-while Mr. 
Tilak was arrested on June 24th, 1908) on July 6th, 
1908. After expressing his general sympathy with the 
Temperance Movement, His Excellency Sir George Clarke 
(Now Lord Sydenham) explained the Government's 
policy with regard to the sale of liquor, took exception 
to certain statements made by the members of the 
Deputation and concluded by saying that though the 
rules made by the Association were unexceptionable, 
still it was impossible owing to the difference in indivi- 
dual temperaments to expect uniform and consistent 
observance of them. He reminded the deputation, 
how, even at Poona, the rules failed to keep order and 
how therefore, their universal application was fraught 
with evil consequences. He concluded " Picketing is 
an interference with liberty which in Poona, certainly 
would have the appearance of class legislation, that it 
would in many places inevitably lead to breaches of 
peace and to police prosecutions which we all wish to 



IQO LOKAMANYA TELAK 

avoid, that it cannot permanently promote the object 
you have in view and that it may help to defeat that 
object. I sincerely hope, you will not regard this as 
an arbitrary decision of an alien Government which 
does not sympathise with your valuable Association.*'. . 

A sadder commentary on the incapacity of the Bureau- 
cracy to understand the Indian view-point and a 
stronger argument for the immediate establishment of 
Swaraj can hardly be imagined. 

While engaged in these and other activities Mr. Tilak 
had not forgotten the question of the Congress-compro- 
mise. The first time that this problem was tackled 
since the Surat solit w£is at the Provincial Conference 
of United Bengal held in February 1908 at Pabna under 
the Presidency of Srj. (Dr.) Rabindranath Tagore. In 
this Conference, both the parties were strongly repre- 
sented and after full and mature consideration, the 
Calcutta Resolutions on Swaraj, Swadeshi, Boycott 
and National Education were passed. The resolution 
on the Boycott did not speak merely of the Boycott of 
British goods but referred to the Boycott Movement — 
words Mr, Gokhale had taken strong objection to at 
Surat — and it is remarkable that though in the Swaraj 
resolution, demand was made only for Colonial Self- 
Govemment still, the Nationalists were allowed to bring 
in a formal amendment expressive of their longing for ab- 
solute Independence. The harmony that prevailed bet- 
ween the Bengal Moderates and the Bengal Nation- 
alists on such heated subjects as Boycott and Self- 
Government was of happy augury and Mr. Tilak expect- 
ed the same reasonable attitude from both the parties in 
the Bombay Provincial Conference that was to be held 



TOWARDS REPRESSION I9I 

at Dhulia, under the Presidentship of the late Mr. Daji 
Abaji Khare. The Convention Committee appointed 
by the Moderates at Surat was to meet at Allahabad in 
the Easter Holidays ; and it was the earnest wish of 
many that the Bombay Conference should be held 
before the Easter. But to suit the convenience of the 
President, it was decided to be held after the Easter. 
At the eleventh hour, however, Mr. Khare refused to 
preside, and his place was filled by the late Hon. 
Mr. G. V. Joshi. Before, however, the Conference 
could meet, the Convention Committee held its 
sittings at Allahabad and passed certain rules and re- 
gulations which were not likely to commend themselves 
to the Nationalists. The work of Congress compro- 
mise thus became more difficult than ever, but with 
his usual optimism, Mr. Tilak refused to be discouraged. 
The Dhulia conference commenced its sittings on April 
17th. Resolutions on Swadeshi, Boycott, and National 
Education were passed. To the last two Resolutions 
there was in the Conference a slight opposition. The 
resolution appointing a Committee to bring about Con- 
gress Compromise was moved by Mr. Tilak ; speaking to 
this resolution he declared how suicidal it would be to 
leave out of the Congress any party pledged to peaceful 
and "constitutional" methods, only because that party 
preached independence. 

It is not impossible that the Congress Compromise 
on which Mr. Tilak had set his heart, would have been 
an accomplished fact long ago, had not the whole poli- 
tical atmosphere been suddenly changed for the worse 
by the unexpected appearance of the bomb. On April 
30th, a bomb intended for Mr. Kingsford, Sessions 



192 LOKAMANYA TILAK 

Judge at Mozufferpore struck Mrs. and Miss Kennedy 
leaving them killed on the spot. This incident created 
a panic, intensified by the rapid arrests of a number of 
Bengali youths. The fury of the Anglo-Indian Com- 
munity knew no bounds and some fanatics like the 
Pioneer and the Asian began to cry for blood. The 
Moderates and the Loyalists were terrified and lost all 
sense of proportion. The Government was panic-stri- 
ken. The delicate duty of warning the Government of 
the dangers of repression, the Terrorists of the utter 
futility of their doings and the Moderates of the neces- 
sity of keeping their heads cool, fell upon the " Extre- 
mists " and this duty Mr. Tilak discharged with his 
usual candour. He did not " speak of murders with 
approval " nor did he " hail the advent of the bomb in 
India as if something had come to India for its good." 
He did not, like Mathew Arnold, refuse to call a man 
murderer who "for some great public cause, without 
love or hate, austerely raised his arm against a power 
exempt from common checks." On the contrary he 
considered it to be " the country's misfortune " that the 
bomb had come ; and he called upon the Government, 
with all the fervour at his command to uproot this 
' poisonous tree ' by giving larger political rights to the 
people. He clearly saw through the attempts made to 
fasten the responsibility of such events upon the much- 
disliked agitator. But really speaking " the ultimate 
cause of terrism in Bengal must be sought in the utterly 
selfish, high-handed and tyrannical policy of the Govern- 
ment and in the contemptuous and insulting manner 
in which most official and non-official Anglo-Indians 
have spoken of and treated the Bengalees. They have 



TOWARDS REPRESSION 1 95 

ridden rough-shod over the feelings of the Bengalees and 
turned a deaf ear to their strongest and most reasonable 
representations, supported by facts and figures. The 
Russianization of the administration in spirit and me- 
thods has led to the conversion of a small section of the 
people to the methods of Russian teiroism. It is sim- 
ply a question of action and re-action, ' Stimulus * and 
* response '." 

Mr. Tilak had nothing but contempt for those who 
in their hurry to save their skin and position were osten- 
tatiously profuse in their condemnation of the Terro- 
rists. His views may be summed up in the following 
words of the talented editor of the Modern Review.^ 
** It may be easy for arm-chair critics who are incapa- 
ble of risking or sacrificing anything for humanity, to 
inveigh in unmeasurable terms against persons who 
have made terrible mistakes, but who nevertheless were 
prepared to lose all that men hold dear, for their race 
and country ; — persons whose fall has been great, be- 
cause perhaps, equally great was their capacity for 
rising to the heights of being ; but for ourselves, we 
pause awe-struck in the presence of this m-ystericus 
tragedy of mingled crime and stern devotion. Deplore 
as we do the death of the two European women, and 
strongly condemn the murderous deed, we scorn to 
associate ourselves in our condolence and condemnation 
with those Anglo-Indian editors and others who have 
not even a word of regret to express, when brutal Anglo- 
Indians kill inoffensive and defenceless Indians or assault 
helpless Indian women. Whatever feelirgs we express, 
we must do independently and in measured terms." 

* The Modern Review (June 1908).

194 LOKAMANYA TILAK 

On May 22nd, the following statement was issued over 
the signatures of Mr. Tilak and 24 leading Nationalists 
of Maharashtra : — 

" We view with deep regret the recent acts of violence 
on the part of certain young men in Bengal, resulting 
i» lamentable deaths. 

" We firmly believe that these regrettable occurances 
are the result of prolonged and persistent disregard of 
public opinion and a continued pohcy of repression 
on the part of the Government, and not as alleged in 
some quarters of any speeches or writings. 

" We are convinced, that the true remedy for the 
present state of things, lies, not in the adoption of any 
measures of repression and coercion, which must prove 
futile, but in the prompt redress of popular grievances 
and in making liberal concessions to the legitimate 
demands and aspirations of the people in a spirit of 
large-minded sympathy and far-sighted statesmanship. 

" We hold that such a pohcy of concihation will be 
in harmony with the best traditions of British Rule in 
India." 

But just as Mr. Tilak and others were convinced 
that the real cause of these fanatical outbursts lay in the 
■unsympathetic rule of a Bureaucracy, irresponsible to 
the people of this country, so was the Bureaucracy con- 
vinced that it was the agitators whose pernicious wri- 
tings and speeches had created such a tense situation. 
They, therefore, set themselves to stamp out the bomb 
by making penal the mere possession of chemicals re- 
quired for preparing bombs, by a stringent Press Act 
and a vigorous hunting of * sedition.* A Press Act was 
contemplated, but it saw the light of the day a couple 



TOWARDS REPRESSION I95 

of years later. Newspaper prosecutions commenced 
right earnestly. Early in June as many as four editors 
were arrested in the Bombay Presidency, om charges of 
sedition. When the smaller fry was thus being disposed 
of, Mr. TUak could not be ignored, and when on 
June 20th, 1908, the (then) Governor of Bombay re- 
marked that certain persons possessing influence over 
the people were exciting hatred and contempt against 
the Government and that they were playing with fire 
it was clearly understood that the remarks were specifi- 
cally meant for Mr. Tilak, who, four days later, was 
arrested (June 24th, 1908.)
