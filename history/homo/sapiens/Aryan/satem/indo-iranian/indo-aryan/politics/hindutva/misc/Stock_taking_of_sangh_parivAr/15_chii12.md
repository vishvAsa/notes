Dr. Shreerang Godbole, an RSS worker from Pune, has done some plain
speaking to the Sangh leaders on the question of Muslims. It is tragic
to find that they really deserve it. It is a measure of the level to
which the RSS has been reduced by its leaders’ recent preoccupation with
politics. The sordid drama recently enacted on the Gujarat stage exposes
the hazards of politics to which RSS is open and can ill-afford. The
small-time ‘shows’ like ‘Sarva Panth Samãdar Manch’ and the political
gimmicks like the ‘eight formulations’ that Dr. Godbole has cited (and
criticised), are the natural fall-out of this preoccupation. They are,
if anything, the ‘saffron brand of secularism’. If the Sangh leaders
believe that these exercises will win the confidence of the Muslims for
the political gains of the BJP, they are deceiving themselves. The
sooner they disabuse their minds of this misconception, the better. Nor
does it show any political maturity on their part to believe that these
exercises will bring the Muslims into the national mainstream. It makes
one wonder whether Sangh leaders also are so obtuse as to be incapable
of learning from history like those whom they criticise.

This does not mean that the RSS should close its doors to Muslims, or
help perpetuate their ghetto mentality. Those from the Muslim community
who subscribe to Sangh philosophy should be admitted to the RSS camp,
but this should be done strictly by the test of honest adherence to the
Sangh principles and ideals, and not by and kind of appeasement,
howsoever subtle.  
 

**THE PROBLEM OF ISLAM**

This, of course, does not solve the problem of Islam, which is chiefly
responsible for the ghetto mentality of Muslims. Muslims should, no
doubt, be viewed as victims of Islam, as Dr. Godbole puts it. But
politics is not the way to ‘cure’ them of it. Politics, if anything,
will entrench them in Islam, and not ‘cure’ them, as the
post-Independence politics of India has demonstrated.

Most of the Muslims of India are former Hindus. Islam has conquered
nations by forcible conversions, and what is conquered by force cannot
be reconquered except by force, if history is any guide. But this
historical road is not open to the Hindus due to their adoption of the
democratic system of government, apart from the fact that it is against
their Sanãtana Dharma.

The idea that Islam will crumble if efforts are made to ‘expose’ it, is
also misplaced. Islam is not an ideology like Marxism or any other ‘ism’
as Dr. Godbole believes. Ideologies that usually go under the suffix of
‘ism’ have at least some philosophy at their base. Islam has no
philosophy whatsoever. It is a system of beliefs and blind beliefs, at
that, - with outdated medieval customs and practices to bolster it up.
Hence Islam is not open to rational debate or arguments as all ‘isms’
are. On the contrary, any attempt to ‘expose’ it rationally, or even
artistically, is counterproductive as the examples of Rushdie, Taslima
and Anwar Shaikh go to prove. It fans the very fire of fanaticism that
it intends to quench.  
 

**THE ONLY SOLUTION**

This brings us back to the RSS, i.e. to the reason that led Dr. Hedgewar
to found it. Dr. Hedgewar never worried himself with the problem of
Muslims, still less of Islam. He set out to set his own house in order.
It is a sad day in the history of the RSS that its leaders are so much
exercised over the problem of Muslims and Islam, which is not their
concern. They are frittering away their energies in wrong directions and
useless channels. They should know that it is politics that has created
the so-called Muslim problem. It is strange that, of all the people, it
is the Sangh leaders who are breaking their heads on this problem.
Muslims are a problem, if at all, to the politicians, not to the Sangh
leaders. Sangh leaders should first address themselves to the ‘problem’
of the Hindus, which, if solved, will automatically solve the ‘problem’
of the Muslims, if it is a problem; and this they can do effectively
only if they completely abstain from politics, because politics never
solves problems. It creates problems.  
 

**A WARNING**

The recent political victories of the BJP have fired the ambition and
imagination of the Sangh workers, and thrown them headlong into
politics. The recent writings of thinkers like Ram Swarup, Frawley,
Shourie, Anwar Shaikh *et al*, intended for political effect, seem to
have persuaded them to pay all their attention to ‘the dangerous
political ideologies masquerading as religions’. There is no harm in
‘exposing’ these so-called ‘ideologies masquerading as religions’. But
that will not solve the ‘Hindu problem’, irrespective of whether this
‘exposure’ will bring about their downfall. The fall of Communism in
Russia was not due to the intellectual exercise of ‘exposure’ of
Marxism, but to social and economic causes. In any case, these
‘exposures’ are no solution to our immediate problems, and I honestly
feel that the energies of the Sangh workers should not be wasted on
issues that do not directly concern us. Their energies should be
constructively utilized in the cause of the Hindus, who are
progressively being divided on caste and other lines by political
upstarts. But engaging in political battles to counter the effect of
these upstarts will only accentuate the problem and not solve it.  It
should never be forgotten that it was political interests and ambitions
that kept the Hindus disunited and divided, and made them fall an easy
prey to Muslims throughout history. (Did not political ambition split
the monolith BJP, the party of discipline, in Gujarat?) The seeds of
BJP’s Muslim appeasement under ‘saffron brand of secularism’ lie in this
very political prepossession. Let not those seeds sprout, which will
certainly do if Sangh workers engage in its politics by staging such
‘shows’ as the ‘Manch’.

Let the Sangh leaders and workers stop fighting battles and begin
working seriously to win the war.
