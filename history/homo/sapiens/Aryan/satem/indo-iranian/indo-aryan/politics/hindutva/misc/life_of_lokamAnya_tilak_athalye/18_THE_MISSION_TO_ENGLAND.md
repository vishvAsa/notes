> I have had many opportunities of exchanging views with Mr. 
Tilak during his stay in England, and every time that I have 
spoken with him, I have felt that he was truly a statesman and 
not a mere politician. The way in which he was able to take a 
sane view of the Indian situation in Britain, within a few days 
of his arrival in this country (England) made me marvel at his

EVER abject, never fanatical, Mr. Tilak's methods 
of political agitation were a unique combination of 
manliness, astuteness and a sense of proportion. He 
disdained the constant waitings, never-ending mendi- 
cancy that characterised the efforts of some of the ex- 
treme Moderates. On the other hand, he kept clear 
from the noxious weed of anarchism. Within these 
two clearly -defined limits, he was willing to work in any 
way, if he was sure of the wisdom of the path. He was^ 
" an operator, a co-operator, and a non-co-operator.'* 
He liked to vary his means with changes in circum- 
stances. In 1904, he had spoken to a Congress resolu- 
tion supporting political deputations to England. He 
was, then, anxious to rouse the Moderate leaders from 
their dangerous slumber and when the Congress Depu- 



THE MISSION TO ENGLAND 25/ 

tation was sent to England, he intended to start a vigo- 
rous agitation in India to back it up. With the Parti- 
tion of Bengal came a change. Public opinion in India 
was roused to an intense pitch. Appeals were made to 
England. They were unheeded. The people lost their 
faith in the good intentions of England. At this time, 
the question of sending deputations to England was 
raised ; but now Mr. Tilak opposed the idea. The 
Nationalist Party wanted to force England's attention 
to India by means of a vigorous Boycott movement. 
In this programme of Boycott, deputations had no place. 
Ten eventful years passed and the times were changed. 
The India of 19 17 was not the India of 1907. New 
forces were at work, not only in India but all the world 
over. The war of ' Liberty ' had transformed the civi- 
lised world, estabUshed India's necessity to England 
and extorted from the most bigoted Anglo-Indians 
and English men and women tributes to India's loyalty 
and India's heroism. This was, indeed, the time to 
press our claims on the grateful attention of England, 
open her eyes to India's grievances and to the valour 
strength and ability lying unused, discouraged and put 
down by the suspicions of the Bureaucrats in India. 
" Now is the time when a political mission ought to be 
established in England '* said Mr. Tilak. " We must 
cease to be parochial. Our earliest activities were 
merely local and isolated. Then they became provin- 
cial and then National. Now is the time to plunge 
into international currents of thought and life, realise 
our ideal, and to convince the world that India is seri- 
ously after attaining her highest not only in National life 
but in the international affairs as weU".

The old guard of the Moderate Party could not mus- 
ter up courage to ** pinprick " the British Lion in the 
midst of his struggle. Mrs. Besant, however, cordially 
supported Mr. Tilak, for she knew the value of world- 
propaganda. In the Lucknow Congress, Mr. Tilak's 
scheme for a vigilant Executive for the Congress was 
ruled out of order. His persistent attempts to get the 
sanction of the Congress for a strong deputation met 
with tardy and nominal success. A deputation was 
agreed upon ; but every excuse was found for delay ; and 
when at last, procrastination was impossible, was recei- 
ved the cable of Sir WilUam Wedderbum advising 
delay. In the meanwhile, judgment in England was 
going against us by default. The Sydenham group 
was busy as ever ; India's " representatives " like the 
Maharaja of Bikaner declared that India wanted not 
Swaraj but only a little dose of Reforms ; the tide of 
repression was merrily flowing in. Finding the big 
Moderate guns immoveable, Mr. Tilak sent out the inde- 
fatigable and enterprising Mr. Baptista for pioneer 
work in England. The goodwill and co-operation of 
the Labour Party was secured ; and yet a well-organised 
propaganda was to be carried on. In the meanwhile, Mr. 
Montague himself had come over to India to look into 
India's grievances ; this was a further excuse for delay. 
At last both Mr. Tilak and Mrs. Besant decided to send 
their own " Home Rule Deputations " to England and 
herein they were wise, as later, the All-India Congress 
Committee decided not to send out a deputation until 
the Montague Report was out and the Special Session 
of the Congress had pronounced India's verdict there- 
upon. 



THE MISSION TO EKGLAND 259*- 

It was this suicidal and unstatesmanlike dilatoriness 
that Mr. Tilak strongly disliked. " You will never 
&id " said he, "a better opportunity of arousing the 
slumbering conscience of the average Britisher. When 
even Mr. Bonar Law advises the colonies to strike when 
the iron is hot, surely, we shall be faiUng in our duty, if 
we don't take up the hint.*' The usual Indian claims 
for Swaraj, he argued, are based upon sentimental 
appeals to English Liberalism or compassion. Now, 
is the opportunity to show how England can save herself 
by saving India, become great herself by giving India 
the opportunity to regain her pristine glory. He want* 
«d to tell the Enghsh Democracy how their representa- 
tives in India had kept the children of the soil under 
their heels, prostrate, starving and emasculated and how 
the tonic of Swaraj if given now, would still enable 
India to do fuU justice to her ambition of helping Bri- 
tain. This was the message which Mr. Tilak wanted 
to deliver in England. It was dignified,lofty and 
wholesome. 

Since the entry of the capitalistic class into the 
field of politics, the difficulty of collecting funds is not 
acutely felt. Yet Mr. Tilak always preferred to have 
small contributions from many to a big donation from 
one. " I should like to have 64 pice from as many 
persons instead of one rupee from one." he said ; and 
on this principle he set about collecting funds for the 
Home Rule Deputation. He made extensive tours in 
Belgaum, Nasik, Sholapur, Thana, and Kolaba dis- 
tricts, where along with the inevitable addresses and 
processions, large purses were presented to him. His 
tour in the Central Provinces and Berar was from this 



260 LOKAMANYA TILAK 

standpoint the grandest, the most successful because 
well organised. During a short period of little less 
than three weeks (Feb. 1918) he delivered lectures at 
30 places and collected one hundred and fifty thousand 
Rupees, He travelled one thousand miles by motor 
and an equal distance by railway. It was a triumph of 
will power pure and simple; for his body, old, weakened 
and ailing was utterly unable to bear the strain. 

In a monemt of exhaustion he once said '* People 
can't possibly realise that I feel so weak. When the 
moment comes I lecture. But the body is all the while 
breaking under the strain. The lecture over, I retire 
from the crowds and sleep over my fatigue. Only my 
will supports me. The body is done up." Extensive 
tours — especially those that call forth constant crowds 
and require frequent lectures try the strength of the 
youngest and the most energetic. Mr. Tilak at 61 did 
not hesitate to undertake a long and busy tour, prepara- 
tory to his voyage to England. What an iron will he 
had! 

The Home Rule Deputation was turned back from 
Colombo at the last moment and Mr. Tilak had to wait 
for some time more. In the meanwhile his defamation 
suit against Sir Valentine Chirol was hanging fire ; 
finding that it could not reasonably be postponed, the 
Government had to permit Mr. Tilak to proceed to 
England. The Bureaucracy, however, took special care 
to send Mr. Tilak with a gag on his mouth and a slur on 
his loyalty. He was required to give a pledge that he 
would not address any meetings while in England and 
a couple of months before Mr. Tilak proceeded to 
England he was prohibited from speaking in India with- 



THE MISSION TO ENGLAND 26l 

•out the previous permission of the District Magistrate. 
The alleged reason was a speech supposed to discourage 
recruiting. Mr. Tilak was too busy with his legal and 
other work to attempt to speak in India. But the 
undertaking he was required to give as regards his 
silence in England was evidently very inconvenient. 
He had to give it which he did under protest. But the 
first thing he did in England was to get the undertaking 
cancelled. Nor was this very difficult. If Dr. Nair, 
who had given a similar undertaking could ^%t the per- 
mission of the British Cabinet to make speeches, why 
should not Mr. Tilak have the same ? Surely, what is 
sauce for goose is sauce for gander also. He did get 
the cancellation of the pledge, though of course, he was 
shrewd enough not to endanger his case in the Court by 
a too early appearance on the public platform. His 
failure in his suit against Sir Valentine Chirol was due 
largely to the prejudice created by the prohibition order 
of Lord Willingdon, the extemment orders from Delhi 
and Lahore, the untimely publication in England of the 
Rowlatt Report and by the peculiarly perverted man- 
ner in which Sir Edward Carson made capital out of 
his two convictions for sedition. Whatever the reasons, 
the result was certainly disastrous not only to Mr. Tilak 
individually, but to his cause as well. 

In the meanwhile, Mr. Tilak had already commenced 
his self-imposed task of reorganizing the British Con- 
gress Committee and the affairs of the India. Both 
the Committee and the newspaper owe their existence 
to the need felt, ever since the birth of the Congress, of 
educating the English public, whose ignorance about 
jndia was — and unfortunately still is — almost pheno- 



-2^2 LOKAMANYA TILAK 

menal. A humorous story is told illustrative of this- 
ignorance. It was the day following the death of Lord 
Northbrook. Two Englishmen were travelling in a 
railway carriage. " One of them, looking through the 
news columns of the paper in his hand, quietly asked 
* Who is this Lord Northbrook that snipped off yester- 
day ?' ' Who knows ? * said his equally indifferent 
companion " May be some relation of Lord Cromer '/* 
It was to counter-act the evil effects of such abysmal 
ignorance of Englishmen even about persons sent out 
to India as Viceroys, that the British Congress Commit- 
tee was started in 1889 and the newspaper India in 
1890. As long as the Congress was a united body con- 
trolled by Moderate leaders with whom the Congress 
Committee was in general agreement, there was no 
difficulty. But now came a change . The Moderates 
had seceded from the Congress; and the Congress 
Committee and its weekly organ were still the monopoly 
of the British friends of the Moderates ; the result 
was that though the Congress supported the journal and 
spent nearly Rs. 30,000 annually on the work of the 
Committee, the policy of India was antagonistic 
to that of the Congress. Mr. Polak whose evident 
leanings towards the Moderates, ill fitted him for his 
editorial work under the changed circumstances, had 
not, Mr. Tilak was astonished to find, cared to publish 
even the Resolutions of the Special Congress (1918). 

Mr. Tilak, though the chosen President of the Delhi 
Congress, was not the bearer of any mandate from the 
Congress. So he found it very difficult to carry on his 
work with the Congress Committee and India. The 
reactionary element in the Committee assumed a lofty 



THE MISSION TO ENGLAND 263 

attitude and claimed to be wiser than the Congress. 
Even for such a simple thing as attending the meeting 
of the Committee, Mr. Tilak had to move heaven and 
earth. He received insults at every turn and ** was 
made to feel that he was a busy-body." Fortunately 
for him, the Delhi Congress took up the question of re- 
organizing the work in England. The Congress Depu- 
tation was specially charged with this work ; and until 
order was brought out of chaos, supplies were witheld. 
Still, Mr. Polak and his friends in the Committee went 
on with their even course ; and under one pretext or 
another, the work was postponed indefinitely. There 
were three persons among the Directors who could not 
tolerate these dilatory tactics of Mr. Polak. So, " Dr. 
Clark, Dr. Rutherford and Mr. Parekh, as Directors of 
the India asked the acting editor whether or not, 
he could conscientiously support the Congress policy." 
Mr. Polak at once declared that he was no longer res- 
ponsible for the editorial control of the paper. After 
his resignation, Miss Normanton became editor and 
was guided in her work by Mr. N, C. Kelkar during 
the period he was in England. 

In his task of re-organizing the Congress Committee 
Mr. Tilak was considerably helped by Dr. Clark and his 
followers, who, in spite of the opposition of several ex- 
Presidents of the Congress, adopted a new Constitution 
in August 1919. By this change in the Constitution, 
only persons in thorough agreement with the Congress 
policy could become the members of the British Congress 
Committee. The rest had to resign. 

It will be thus seen that after nearly one year's persist- 
ent work, Mr. Tilak triumphed. When Mr. Tilak left 



264 LOKAMANYA TILAK 

for England, there were many well-meaning persons who 
had expressed their doubt as to whether, Mr. Tilak had 
at that advanced age the necessary elasticity of spirit to 
do the difificult and delicate work undertaken by him. 
They admired Mr. Tilak's ability but evidently thought 
that " an oak can't be transplanted at sixty." But by 
his adroitness in dealing with men and affairs, Mr. 
Tilak fully proved that though his body was old, his 
heart was ever young. 

The spadework done by Mr. Joseph Baptista since 
August 1917 was of invaluable use to Mr. Tilak. At 
the Labour Party Conference at Nottingham (Jan. 23rd 
1918) the Party had pledged itself to assist {India) in 
every possible way in her efforts to win Home Rule. Mr. 
Tilak cultivated the friendship of Labour leaders and 
the confidence they placed in him and the Congress 
Deputation was so great, that they agreed to move in 
Parliament amendments to the Government of 
India Bill in spite of Mrs. Besant's best endeavours to 
dissuade them from so doing. His alliance with the 
Labour party was of great use to the party itself espe- 
cially in its efforts to bring out the Herald as a 
daily paper. 

At the same time, Mr. Tilak did not neglect what- 
ever aid and co-operation he could derive from the 
moribund Liberal Party. 

It was Mr. Tilak 's earnest desire to bring about per- 
fect unanimity amongst all the important deputations, 
then in England. He believed in unity more than in 
any other thing and tried his best to win over Mrs, 
Besant and the Moderate leaders. He appealed to Mrs. 
Besant to forget all the bitterness of the Delhi Congress 



THE MISSION TO ENGLAND 265 

and so chalk out her course as to bring about unity. But 
she and the Moderate leaders were pledged to support the 
Reforms. No doubt they talked of slight improvements, 
here and there ; but they made no secret of their inten- 
tion of accepting whatever reforms were granted. 
Probably they were afraid of reactionaries of the type 
of Lord Sydenham and considered it to be the height 
-of statesmanship to run no risks. They wanted to 
strengthen the hands of Mr. Montague. Mr. Tilak on 
the contrary knew full well that it was to establish its 
credit with the civilized nations that England was grant- 
ing us Reforms. Mr. Montague was as anxious to give 
as we were to take. Why not ask for more ? The phi- 
losophy of Moderation said " Half a loaf is better 
than none." Mr. Tilak was prepared, if need 
be, to risk the loss of the proferred half in his 
endeavours to get three-quarters. He believed more in 
winning than in receiving. It was, therefore, psycho- 
logically impossible that the Moderates should come 
over to his side. Not only were they unwiUing to 
join hands with him in the matter of Reforms, but even 
regarding the Punjab situation. Several members of 
the Congress Deputation approached prominent members 
of the Moderate Deputation but with no result. The 
efforts of the British Congress Committee were also 
unavailing. 

Mr. Tilak did his best to " educate the British Demo- 
cracy " by means of speeches and writings. Mr. Tilak's 
^ortcomings as a speaker have been noticed by many 
unsympathetic critics. It is worth remembering there- 
fore, that many of his speeches were greatly appreci- 
ated by the British audiences. Mr. Tilak never appealed 



266 LOKAMANYA TILAK 

to passions, but always to reason. The average English 
man is a hard-headed man. Appeal to his common- 
sense and he is won over ; and Mr. Tilak's appeals were 
always directed to his head. It is not, therefore, sur- 
prising that Mr. Tilak's speeches created a favourable 
impression on those who heard him. 

Mr. Saint Nihal Singh thus describes a speech by Mr. 
Tilak : — 

" Of all these addresses, the one that I like best was 
the one that Mr. Tilak delivered at the Caxton HaU 
while sitting in a chair, because he had sprained his 
ankle. Mr. Tilak outlined the conditions existing in 
India in olden times, referring to the aceounts of the 
wealthy, prosperous enlightened India left by foreign 
travellers. He asked the audience particularly to note 
the vast extent of the Indian Empire ruled over by 
Asoka and Samudra Gupta. He went on to relate 
that our country in those days, not only possessed a 
wealth of religious and philosophical literature but was 
industrially great and self-sufficing in every respect, 
able to satisfy all her material and artistic wants. 

** Passing from the pleasant picture of ancient India, 
Mr. Tilak gave a graphic description of India to-day, 
with her millions of sons and daughters who, because 
of appaling poverty, never know what it is to have 
the pangs of hunger stilled. He told how the East India 
Company had deliberately killed our industries, throw- 
ing the whole weight of population upon agriculture. 

" Taking up the political question, Mr. Tilak assured 
the audience, that Indians were not anti-British, — they 
were only ' anti-Bureaucracy ' They desired the Bri- 
tish connection to continue. 



THE MISSION TO ENGLAND 26/ 

" Then Mr. Tilak shattered, one by one, the arguments 
advanced against granting Self-government to India. 
The Bureaucrats, he said, were themselves responsible 
for iUiteracy in India, While deploring caste and ac- 
knowledging that it required radical modification, he 
denied that it constituted a reason for refusing self- 
Govemment. The British, he pointed out, quarreled 
among themselves quite as much as Indians did. There 
was no Ulster in India — Hindus and Mushms were 
agreed concerning the constitutional reforms. He 
challenged the statement that Indians did not desire 
Home Rule. He demanded to know why, India alone, 
of aU the British oversea units, should be expected to 
achieve Self-government ' step by step '. That phrase 
had no meaning in this age of progress. Indians should 
immediately be given control over their purely domestic 
civil affairs." 

This was, in brief, the line of reasoning adopted by 
Mr. Tilak in convincing and winning over the British 
Democracy. He, however, did not confine his activi- 
ties merely to speeches. He sent out contributions to 
the Press and published several pamphlets and leaflets. 
In England, Mr. Tilak found that in spite of the so-called 
liberty and independence of the Press, the great Fourth 
Estate is practically manipulated and controlled by a 
few groups of politicians most of whom are quite insular 
in their outlook. Though swayed by " empire hunger '* 
these politicians care very little for the true interests of 
the empire. English Liberalism is essentially a 
* white ' Liberalism. It is not intended for the Black 
or the Brown. The English Press, therefore cares very 
little for India, so much so that not only are weD in- 



^68 LOKAMANYA TILAK 

formed contributions on Indian Affairs unwelcome but 
even paid advertisements of Indian meetings are not 
always accepted. 

In the general election of 1918, Mr. Tilak was busy 
drawing the attention of English men and women to 
the problems of India. He issued four leaflets " each 
consisting of a page tastefully printed on one side only." 
Thousands of copies of these leaflets were distributed 
during the electioneering campaign. 

Mr. Tilak 's pamphlet on " Self-determination " at- 
tracted much notice. It was sent to hundreds of states- 
men and politicians in England and abroad. Similarly 
his petition to the President of the Peace Conference as 
an elected representative of the Congress, was widely 
read. Of this no fewer than a lakh of copies were 
issued. Besides these, a number of stray publications 
sought to attract England's attention to the cause of 
India. 

** On August 6th, Mr. Tilak, on behalf of the Indian 
Home Rule League, of which he was the President, ap- 
peared before the Joint Parliamentary Committee of 
the two Houses, set up to consider the Government of 
India Bill, and was asked by Lord Selbourne, the Chair- 
man, to make any statement that he cared to make to 
supplement the answers that he had given to the list 
of questions compiled by the Committee. Speaking 
without hesitation, in clear theough rather low tones, 
Mr. Tilak declared that the League in behalf of which 
he appeared, had accepted the Declaration of August 20, 
1917, in regard to His Majesty's Government's policy in 
India, though he and his colleagues put their own con- 
struction upon the latter part of the Declaration, which 



THE MISSION TO ENGLAND 26^ 

left the pace at which India should proceed towards Res- 
ponsible Government, to the authorities in White Hall to 
determine in consultation with the Government of India. 
They took the view that the proposals put forward by 
the Secretary of State and the Viceroy were not neces- 
sarily the corollary to the pronouncement. A much 
larger measure of Self-Govemment could be given to 
Indians without in any way going against the spirit of 
the British policy as laid down in that Declaration. la 
fact, even the Congress-League Scheme provided for 
advance by stages, though the stages would be fewer 
than they would be under the Montague-Chelmsford 
scheme. He also insisted that it was necessary that a 
time-limit be fixed in the statute for the attainment by 
India of fully Responsible administration. The term of 
15 years fixed by the Congress might appear arbitrary 
but it was reasonable. 

*' Mr. Tilak also claimed that Indians were fully fit 
for administering Provinces, and that they should be 
given Provincial Autonomy. He also declared that 
Responsibility in the Central Government was absolute- 
ly necessary. He suggested that at least those depart- 
ments in the Central Government which dealt with 
affairs which in the case of the provinces were considered 
fit to be transferred to popular control, should be placed 
under responsible Ministers, That could be done with- 
out resorting to diarchy. The Congress and the League 
had suggested a scheme for that purpose, and had provi- 
ded sufficient safeguards. 

" Mr. Tilak claimed that good materials for elector- 
ates existed in India. Indeed, he went so far as to state 
that one word from the officials could create elctorates. 



270 LOKAMANYA TILAK 

Above all, he wished to see the officials deprived of the 
initiative for inaugurating large policies that they at pre- 
sent possessed, and reduced to the status of permanent 
servants in Britain and other countries. Such initiative 
should only be exercised by the people's representatives. 
Lastly, he considered the inclusion of a Declaration of 
Rights in the Statute was absolutely necessary "*. 

After thee ompletion of the above oral statement it 
was naturally expected that Mr. Tilak would be cross- 
examined by the several members of the Committee, 
and as it was further expected that the cross-examina- 
tion of Mr. Tilak would particularly be lively, the Com- 
mittee-room was crowded to its utmost capacity. But 
it was soon announced that the Committee did not in- 
tend to trouble Mr. Tilak with questions. This particu- 
lar soUcitude for Mr. Tilak was evidently the off- 
spring of prejudice. It is said that when the name of 
Mr. Tilak was sent to the Committee to represent the 
Indian Home Rule League, Lord Selboume asked the 
members of the Committee whether Mr. Tilak was to be 
allowed to make a statement. The majority of the 
members were strongly against hearing Mr. Tilak, but 
none of them could hit upon some specious pretext on 
which he was to be rejected. They, therefore, had to 
allow him to appear before them, but as they did not like 
to tolerate his presence more than was absolutely neces- 
sary, they *non-co-operated* with him by refusing to put 
him questions. This childish conduct of the Committee 
shows the deep prejudice with which even the better mind 
of England regarded the greatest of Indians then Hving. 

* Mr. Tilak's work in England (St. Nihal Singh ; Modern 
Review October 191 9). 



THE MISSION TO ENGLAND 27! 

When the Joint Parliamentary Committee had finish- 
ed its labours and the passing of the Government of 
India Bill had been duly ensured, Mr. Tilak hastened 
back to India. He left England on October 30th, 19 19 
and reached Bombay, hale and hearty, on 27th Novem- 
ber 1919, just a month before the Amritsar Con- 
gress. Some of his opponents have said that his mis- 
sion to England broadened his outlook. Mr. Tilak never 
required any contact with England to broaden his 
vision for the simple reason that his outlook was never 
parochial. His Ufe in England only deepened his 
faith in foreign propaganda and he intended to take the 
earliest opportunity of establishing permanent poUti- 
cal missions at London, Paris and New York. 

An esteemed friend and associate of Mr. Tilak refers 
to his work in England in the following admiring lan- 
guage :— 

" Then again Mr. Tilak had to fight against 

great odds, before the Deputation arrived, in the matter 
of getting the London public to properly understand 
and appreciate the Congress scheme of Reforms. At 
every meeting, he impressed his audience with his re- 
markably terse statement of facts and brilliant reason- 
ing. You all know what remarkable powers, Mr. 
Tilak possesses of narrowing down the issues in a con- 
troversy and I may say he had never before an opportu- 
nity, like the one he had in England, for displaying his 
powers of elucidating matters of controversy and 
standing erect upon his own platform among the ruins 
of his opponents. He had quite a large variety of op- 
ponents from the agressive Sinn Feiner and bona fide Re- 
volutionist in England, who would if he could, blast 



272 LOKAMANYA TILAK 

4 

the Indian constitutional workers with his supreme 
contempt — to the facile and plausible official exponent 
who dared appear on the pubUc platform to make 
the worse cause appear the better. But the final 
verdict of every audience Mr. Tilak addressed was that 
while with his peculiar subtlety and tactfulness, he put 
the Revolutionist out of Court, he made mince-meat 
of the official or semi-official propagandist. «...,...."
