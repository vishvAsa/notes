ed. by Vijaya Chandra Joshi (Delhi: University Publishers, 1966), pp.
1-25. "The 'Open Letters' originally appeared in the Urdu weekly
Koh-Noor of Lahore. These were translated into English shortly before
the Allahabad Session of the Indian National Congress in 1888 which was
attended by Lala Lajpat Rai. At the suggestion of Allan Octavian Hume
the 'Open Letters' were reproduced in a pamphlet" (Joshi, p.1).
Typographicsl errors have been fixed, and punctuation adjusted in some
cases for clarity. Some very long paragraphs have been broken up for
convenience in reading. All editorial annotations in square brackets are
by FWP; in this regard I am greatly indebted to V. C. Joshi's
footnotes.
