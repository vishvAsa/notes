**The Tabligh Movement or Millions**  
**of Bearded Militants on the March**  
Sita Ram Goel

</div>

The Sarva Panth Samãdar Manch is supposed to work for national
integration. One wonders, however, if Dattopant Thengdi or any other
stalwart of the Sangh Parivar cared to find out who Maulana Wahiduddin
Khan was and what he stood for before they invited him to “sanctify” the
Samadhi of Dr. Hedgewar by his “august” presence.

“Maulana Wahiduddin, currently the director of the Islamic Center,
Delhi, resigned from a prominent position in the Jammat-i-Islami of
India in 1960.”[¹](#1) We shall take up the Jamaat-i-Islami at a later
stage in this chapter. We have to take up the Tablighi Jammat first
because it prepares the ground for the Jamaat-i-Islami or in other words
the Jamaat-i-Islami takes over from where the Tablighi Jamaat leaves.

“The Tablighi Jamaat of the Indo-Pakistan subcontinent constitutes one
of the very few grass roots Islamic movements in the contemporary Muslim
world. In 1926 the Jamaat began da‘wa work in the limited confines of
Mewat near Delhi and consisted of a few dozen disciples of Maulana
Mohammad Ilyas (1885-1944). Today the movement claims to have millions
throughout the Muslim world and the West. Its 1988 annual conference in
Raiwind near Lahore, Pakistan, was attended by more than one million
Muslims from over ninety countries of the world. The Raiwind
International Conference of the Tablighi Jamaat has now become the
second-largest congregation of the Muslim world after hajj.”^([2](#2))

“It was because of his dissatisfaction with the madrasas that Maulana
Ilyas resigned from a prestigious teaching position at Mazaharul Uloom
Seminary in Saharanpur (Uttar Pradesh) and came to Basti Nizamuddin in
the old quarter of Delhi to begin his missionary work. The Tabligh
movement was formally launched from this place in 1926.  Basti
Nizamuddin later became the movement’s international
headquarters.”[³](#3) Ilyas had returned from his second hajj in 1925
when he formalized the movement he had started earlier.[⁴](#4) “Jama’ats
come to the *markaz* \[at Nizamuddin\] from all over \[the world\]; ten
years ago a five storey building was erected to accommodate foreign
jama’ats.”^([5](#5))

The first great achievement of the Tablighi Jamaat was the cold-blooded
murder of Swami Shraddhananda. The swami had been lionized by Muslims
when he supported the Khilafat agitation during the first
Non-Cooperation movement (1921-22). “But as he was closely associated
with the *šuddhi* movement… a section of Muslims cherished bitter hatred
against him. On 23 December 1926, when the Swami after a serious attack
of pneumonia was lying in his bed, a Muslim entered into his room on
false pretext and stabbed him with a dagger.”[⁶](#6) It became well
known very soon that the murderer had been hired by the Tablighi Jamaat
headquartered at Nizamuddin.

Its latest triumph is recorded by Shail Mayaram in her book on Mewat
published in 1997. “Around the corner from Basti Nizamuddin is the
Masjid Panjpiran, now one of the centers of decision-making for Mewat.
Maulvis, politicians, and chaudharis assemble here to discuss critical
issues such as the outcome of December 1992 violence in Mewat… There is
a growing currency of the word kafir with respect to non-Muslims. A
Deobandi ‘alim in Punhana told me in the context of attacks on temples
in December 1992 (in retaliation to the demolition of the Babri mosque)
that this was an example of the age-old conflict between *kufr*
(unbelief) and eternal Islam. A report on the rioting in Mewat that
followed suggests the role of some maulvis in the organization of
protest and later damage to temples, in five places. Some Meos explained
the mobs, largely comprising young persons, in terms of the Otherness of
the Hindu which had been brought about by the work of religious
reform.”^([7](#7))

The “work of religious of reform” referred to in the above citation
means, of course, the work of the Tablighi Jamaat. Wahiduddin Khan has
narrated with overbrimming enthusiasm the story of how the “Otherness of
the Hindu” was “brought about” in Mewat. We have to quote him at some
length:

> …This greet movement generally known as the Tablighi Jama’at has
> inspired a new fervour, a new zeal to serve the divine cause…Its
> founder surprisingly was a slight, short-statured individual rather

> …This family traced its descent to the Valliullah family, who had been

>
> …As soon as the young people left the school they mingled with company

Ilyas undertook many tours in Mewat after his return from his last hajj
in 1938. “A dislike for Hinduised garments was created and people began
to dress themselves according to the specifications of the Shari‘at.
Bracelets got removed from the arms and rings from the ears of
men…”[¹⁷](#17) The first conference of the Jamaat was held in 1941 at
Basti Nizamuddin. It was attended by twenty-five thousand
people.^([18](#18))

Leadership of the Jamaat passed on to Muhammad Yusuf, the son of Ilyas,
after the latter died in 1944. Yusuf intensified and extended the
activities of the Jamaat by tours to all major cities in India and also
many places abroad. “An international network was established which also
evoked great interest among teachers and ulama of Arabia, who began
coming to Nizamuddin and Deoband, where they too addressed gatherings. A
vigorous pan-India and pan-Islamic movement had been
constituted.”^([19](#19))

Partition in 1947 landed many Meos in refugee camps at Humayun’s Tomb,
Purana Qila and several other localities around Nizamuddin. Yusuf sent
activists of the Tablighi Jamaat to all camps. “The victims were told
that their fate was the result of *azãb* (the worst possible punishment
administered by God), incurred because they were not good Muslims. They
were invited to turn towards God. Some months after Partition, Yusuf
visited Pakistan. At a meeting organized by the Jama‘at-i-Lahore, he
addressed the several hundred thousand refugees from India who had gone
to Pakistan, telling them that to avoid *khudrishti* (fall from Grace)
they must follow the path of God, and that alone will save the Muslim
world. According to Hasani, the work of Tablighi Jama’ats resulted in a
rise of morale among the depressed Mewatis.”^([20](#20))

“To the Maulana,” observes Wahiduddin Khan, “dominance on earth was
subject to our leading reformed lives. And he said, 'Follow the pattern
of the Prophet. Those who neither follow the path themselves nor let
others follow it, will be shattered by God as He does the shell of an
egg… No sooner had the people reformed themselves, through the efforts
of the Prophet, then God sent His scourge upon the Romans and Persians.
Those who did not capitulate before Him perished by His
wrath.’”^([21](#21))

Those who want to promote national integration with the help of
Wahiduddin Khan, will do well to read his chapter on “UMMAN-NESS” or
“Islamic Brotherhood”. It carries the “text of a speech delivered by
Maulana Mohammad Yusuf three days before his death on 30 March 1965, at
Rawalpindi, Pakistan”. We are quoting a few key passages:

> The Prophet and his companions took great pains to establish the Ummah
> (the community of believers)… This Ummah was established only after a
> great *sacrifice of the interests of family, party, nation, country,
> language and so on*…^([22](#22))
>
> Remember! *The words, ‘my nation’ my region, and my people’ all lead
> to disunity, and God disapproves of this more than anything
> else*.^([23](#23))
>
> It is incumbent upon us to remain united whatever the cost. The
> Prophet is reported to have said: ‘On the day of Judgement, a certain
> person would be brought before God to be judged, and although he had
> performed all forms of worship in the world, he would stand condemned.
> He would wonder what it was that he was being punished for. He would
> be told that it was due to such words of his as had caused friction in
> the Ummah that he had been brought to this state. Afterwards another
> person would be brought, who had worshipped God far less in comparison
> to the former person. But he would be amply rewarded. In astonishment
> he would ask; ‘For which of my deeds have I been rewarded so
> generously.’ He would be told that on some occasion he had done
> something or spoken some words, which had helped to bring the
> community together, and that it was his good words that had brought
> him all the reward.^([24](#24))
>
> The collective community of Islam should be supreme over groups or
> nations… The enforcement of Muslim Brotherhood is the greatest social
> ideal of Islam. On it was based the Prophet’s sermon on his last
> pilgrimage, and Islam cannot be completely realized unless this ideal
> is achieved.^([25](#25))

Patrons of Wahiduddin Khan in the Sangh Parivar should also note the
thrill which the Maulana experienced when he first reached Basti
Nizamuddin to join the Tablighi Jamaat:

> It was August 14, 1966. At 10 O’clock in the morning we arrived at our
> destination - Bangla Wali Masjid situated near the tomb of Nizamuddin
> Aulia. This mosque has been famous as the center of reform movement
> for decades… Today… it has become the center of a world movement. We
> can liken this center to the heart. Just as the blood circulates from
> the heart throughout the body, then returns to the same place, so do
> the people going out from this place come back to it to recharge
> themselves spiritually so that they may continue their journey onwards
> with renewed vigor…^([26](#26))
>
> …The Chief (Emir) prayed, to which others said Amen… After the prayer,
> the dispatching of missionary groups was attended to… The names of
> those who were undertaking the journey were called out one by one, and
> each in turn came up to the chief to shake hands with him and receive
> his blessing before he departed. *Such a poignant scene evoked
> memories of the Prophet sitting in the Masjid-i-Nabawi, exhorting
> people and sending them in groups to propagate the message to those
> who were ignorant*…^([27](#27))

Those who have not read the orthodox biographies of the Prophet will not
suspect how despicably dishonest Wahiduddin can be. The Prophet is not
known to have sent a single group of missionaries believing in methods
of peaceful persuasion. What he had sent instead were military
expeditions forcing one Arab tribe after another to embrace Islam at the
point of the sword. Those who offered resistance were massacred, their
properties were plundered, and their women and children were captured
for being sold as slaves. Circumstances have changed but the intention
remains the same. The Tabligh movement’s main aim is to prepare Muslims
everywhere for taking up arms when the moment is ripe.

> According to Metcalf, the model of early Muslim jihad is implicit. 
> The amir suggests military/political leadership rather than an
> intellectual or spiritual one, and the tours of the jama‘at are called
> *gasht* (patrols).^([28](#28))

We are often told by spokesmen of the Sangh Parivar that they are not
opposed to Islam as such but to Islamic Fundamentalism. We do not accept
the distinction because Islam by its very nature is Fundamentalist. But
even if a distinction can be drawn, we wonder why they refuse to read
what Wahiduddin Khan has himself written in so many words, and identify
him as an Islamic Fundamentalist *sui generis*. His mild manners and
pretended humility should deceive no one. In fact, he is far more
vicious than the traditional or conservative Islamic Fundamentalist. The
traditional Islamic Fundamentalist is never dishonest in his
presentation of his faith. He never tries the tricks which modernist
Muslim apologists like Rafiq Zakaria or Ashghar Ali Engineer have learnt
from the Christian missionaries in order to conceal the real face of
Islam. But Wahiduddin has gone a step further. He has evolved a
double-speak - one for his die-hard co-religionists, and another for his
Hindu dupes like K.R. Malkani, Nana Deshmukh, and Dattopant Thengdi. He
is thus a doubly distilled poison.  
 

**II**

Hitherto we have dealt with the Tablighi Jamaat as it grew after its
foundation in 1926. But the Tabligh movement as such is much older. We
have to go back into history and see the Muslim situation after the
Mughal Empire broke down after the death of Aurangzeb (1707), and the
invasions of Ahmad Shah Abdali in the second half of the eighteenth
century failed to restore Muslim rule in India.

Muslim ‘community’ in India had remained sharply divided into two
mutually exclusive segments throughout the centuries of Islamic
invasions and rule over large parts of the country. On the one hand,
there were the descendants of conquerors who came from outside or who
identified themselves completely with the conquerors - the Arabs, the
Turks, the Iranians, and the Afghans. They glorified themselves as the
Ashrãf (high-born, noble) or Ahli-i-Daulat (ruling race) and
Ahl-i-Sa‘adat (custodians of religion). On the other hand, there were
converts from among the helpless Hindus who were looked down upon by the
Ashrãf and described as the Ajlãf (low-born, ignoble) and Arzãl (mean,
despicable) depending upon the Hindu castes from which the converts
came. The converts were treated as Ahl-i-Murãd (servile people) who were
expected to obey the Ahl-i-Daulat and Ahl-i-Sa‘adat abjectly.

“During the medieval period,” observes Professor K.S. Lal, “forcible and
hurried conversions to Islam left most of the neo-Muslims half-Hindus.
With his conversion to Islam the average Muslim did not change his old
Hindu environment and tenor of life. The neo-Muslims’ love of Hinduism
was because of their attachment to their old faith and culture. High
class converted Hindus sometimes went back to Hinduism and the old
privileges… Such a scenario obtained throughout the country…” He goes
ahead and describes the state of neo-Muslims in the North-West, Gujarat,
Rajasthan, Central India, Bengal, the Deccan and South
India.^([29](#29))

Shah Waliullah (1703-62) and his son Abdul Aziz (1746-1822) were the
first to notice this situation and felt frightened that the
comparatively small class of the Ashrãf was most likely to be drowned in
the surrounding sea of Hindu Kafirs. Abdul Aziz had converted his
father’s *jihãd* against the Marathas and Jats into a *jihãd* against
the British when he issued a *fatwa* that India under British rule had
become a Dar al-Harb (zone of war). But *jihãd* against the British
needed manpower which the Ashrãf were not in a position to marshal on
their own. They had to turn to the neo-Muslims. The neo-Muslims,
however, had little interest in waging wars for Islam. They had,
therefore, to be fully Islamized, that is, alienated completely from
their ancestral society and culture. That is why the Tabligh movement
was started. But early leaders of the movement could not achieve much
because each one of them clashed with the Sikhs or the British and got
killed.

Syed Ahmad Barelvi (1786-1831), a devoted disciple of Abdul Aziz,
travelled to Mecca and some other Muslim countries in 1822 and met
masters of Islamic lore to learn methods of “purifying Islam” in India,
that is, brainwashing the neo-Muslims and turning them into full-fledged
Muslim fanatics. He labelled his Tabligh as *Tariqah-i Muhammadiyyah*.
But he got himself entangled in a *jihãd* against the Sikh Kingdom in
the Punjab, North-West Frontier Province and Kashmir, and was killed and
burnt to ashes in 1831 by a Sikh battalion led by Kunwar Sher Singh.

Barelvi’s disciple Mir Nasar Ali of Barasat in Bengal, better known as
Titu Mir or Titu Mian, tried to purify Islam in West Bengal. But he
clashed with the British very soon, and was killed by a British military
unit in 1831. Many of his followers were hanged. Around the same time,
Shariatullah (1790-1831) started the Faraizi Movement in East Bengal
after having spent twenty years in Mecca and Medina. But he died in 1837
without achieving significant results. His son, Muhammad Mohsin better
known as Dhudhu Mian (1819-1860) carried on his father’s experiment. But
he was caught by the British for numerous crimes committed against
Hindus in the countryside and died in jail.^([30](#30))

Meanwhile, another Tabligh movement had arisen in Haryana under the
leadership of Shah Muhammad Ramzan (1769-1825). “He found that the
converted Rajputs and Jats… were in no way different from their Hindu
counterparts in culture, customs and celebration of religious festivals…
Shah Muhammad Ramzan used to sojourn in areas inhabited by such
converted Rajputs, dissuade them from practising Hindu rites, and
persuade them to marry their cousins (real uncle’s daughters which
converts persistently refused to do). They equally detested eating cow’s
flesh. To induce them to eat beef, he introduced new festivals like
Maryam ka Roza and ‘Rot-bot’. On this day, observed on 17 Rajjab, a
‘pao’ of roasted beef placed on a fried bread was distributed amongst
relatives and near and dear ones… Such endeavours ruled out the
possibility of reconversion and helped in the ‘Islamization’ of
neo-Muslims…”[³¹](#31) This leader of the Tabligh was killed not by the
British but by some neo-Muslims who got enraged by his vituperation
against their ancient ways.

The Tabligh movement had not been able to make much headway when the
last *jihãd* against the British was launched in 1857.[³²](#32) The
British put it down with a strong hand, and the Ashrãf stood really
scared for the first time. A way out of blind alley was found for them
by Sir Syed Ahmed Khan who crawled before the British on behalf of his
co-religionists. The Aligarh movement he started saw salvation for the
Ashrãf in all-out collaboration with British imperialism. Henceforward,
and till the second decade of the twentieth century, every member of the
Ashrãf fraternity prayed and worked for the permanence of the British
rule in India. By 1871 when Sir W.W. Hunter wrote his book, *The Indian
Musalmans*, the Ashrãf had become the most obedient servants of Her
Majesty, the Queen of England.

But the Ashrãf was far from being cured of its ingrained habit. Soon
they felt strong enough to demand quid pro quo for their loyalty to the
British. They tried to dictate British policies not only in India but
also in the international field. But the British had their own
compulsions. So the alliance broke down when the British annulled the
Partition of Bengal in 1911 and imposed a peace treaty on Turkey in 1919
depriving the Sultan-cum-Caliph of a large part of his domain. The
Ashrãf, therefore, decided to strike a deal with the Indian National
Congress which had been seeking their support ever since it was founded
in 1885. Ishtiaq Husain Qureshi has summed up the situation as follows:

> The Muslims realized that single-handed they could achieve nothing.
> They had waged a lone struggle against British domination and gained a
> modicum of temporary success in 1857 when a fair number of Hindus had
> made a common cause with them. Both Afghans and Turks had impressed
> upon their leaders the stark necessity of gaining the cooperation of
> Hindus. Now was the opportunity and it had to be seized. *It had been
> impressed upon them that the citadel of British power in Asia was
> India, which made all the Muslim countries vulnerable to attack and
> encroachment*… Therefore whatever the cost involved, the British power
> must be dislodged from this citadel. They, like the Hindus, wanted
> freedom, but if the Hindus were to play false after the departure of
> the British, at least the Muslim countries will be able to breathe
> freely. The Muslims of the Subcontinent wanted to be partners in the
> freedom of their habitat as well as in the liberty of the rest of the
> Muslim world, but *if the glory of Islam and the prosperity of other
> Muslim lands could be built only upon their own misery and
> deprivation, they thought the price was not too high to pay*…
>
> The stage was, therefore, set for Hindu-Muslim cooperation and Mahatma
> Gandhi knowing full well the depths of the emotions that surged in
> Muslim breasts and swayed Muslim minds, was too shrewd a politician to
> let such an opportunity go. Muslim sentiments and energies could be
> roped in for the deliverance of India for little to be given in
> return. The bargain was therefore struck.^([33](#33))

We do not want to go into the story of who had to suffer “misery and
deprivation”, and who had the last laugh. What we wish point out here is
that the Tabligh movement was revitalized by the Khilafat agitation led
by the Ashrãf in India.

> …The beneficiary of the Khilafat movement was not only Mr. Jinnah, the
> founder of Pakistan. Maulana Maududi, Allama Inayatullah Mashriqi (the
> founder of the Khaksar movement), and Maulana Ilyas (the founder of
> the Tablighi Jamaat) also benefited from the emotionally charged
> religious environment of Indian Islam in the late 1920s. The emergence
> of these new movements unleashed religious and political forces that
> had the combined effect of directing the Muslim position on a parallel
> course vis-à-vis Hindus and dividing the two religious communities - a
> division which ultimately culminated in the creation of the Muslim
> state of Pakistan.[³⁴](#34) …Although Maulana Ilyas kept himself
> completely aloof from politics… he never opposed Islamic groups
> actively engaged in politics… Maulana Ilyas was of the view that the
> Tabligh movement and politically oriented Islamic groups although
> operating in different spheres, were complimenting each other’s work.
> Hence there should be no competition and rivalry among
> them.^([35](#35))
>
> Since the beginning of Muslim rule in India, the ulama had remained

> movement is the most important attempt to bridge the gap between
> orthodox Islam and the popular syncretie religious practices that are
> prevalent among the Muslim masses…^([36](#36))

Mumtaz Ahmad has failed to mention the most important beneficiary of the
Khilafat agitation, namely, the Jamiat-ul-Ulama-i-Hind which really
fathered the Tablighi Jamaat and which still supplies most of its
leaders to the latter. The Jamiat can also take credit for Islamicizing
the Indian National Congress in cooperation with the Communists and
Socialists of all sorts led by Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru and Indira Gandhi
during the pre- as well as the post-independence period. It remains
lodged in the heart of the Indian Republic like a cancer.

> The ulama and the Khilafatists were significant components of the
> Jamiat ulama-i-Hind, or the Association of Indian Ulama founded in
> 1919… The Jamiat was responsible for the Unanimous Fatwa of the Indian

> decided to establish the Jamiat-i-Tabligh-ul-Islam, a subordinate and
> financially independent organization to be devoted exclusively to
> missionary activity.^([38](#38))

All these Muslim leaders - Maududi, Mashriqi, Ilyas and founders of the
Jamiat-ul-Ulama-i-Hind - came to be known as “nationalist Muslims”
during the Freedom Movement simply because they were opposed to the
Muslim League’s demand for Partition. Nobody cared to find out the real
reason for their opposition to the League, namely, that they wanted the
whole of India and not only a part of it as Dar al-Islam. None of them
ever believed that *kufr* and Islam could ever co-exist peacefully.

The Khaksars of Mashriqi have disappeared from the scene. Ilyas lived to
found the Tablighi Jamaat which is still centered round his family at
Nizamuddin. The Jamiat-ul-Ulama-i-Hind has continued to function in
post-independence India, and grown from strength to strength. It is only
Maududi, the founder of Jamaat-i-Islami in 1941, who left for Pakistan
after Partition. But that has not prevented his Jamaat-i-Islami from
cooperating with the Tablighi Jamaat in India as all over the world.

Maududi (1903-1979) like Mashriqi had come to believe that Islam in
India should work out a strategy which had placed the Communists,
Fascists and Nazis in power - the strategy of a mailed fist wielded by a
determined minority. But unfortunately for him, the British decided to
divide India and quit before he could mobilize the requisite manpower
and assemble the arsenal needed. He moved his headquarters to Lahore in
1948 and his “Jamaat scored its first major victory in March 1949” when
the Constituent Assembly of Pakistan passed the Objectives Resolutions
proclaiming that country as an Islamic State. But the Jamaat-i-Islami
which he left in India “is equally vigorous in defending secularism as a
‘blessing’ and as a ‘guarantee for a safe future for Islam in
India’.”^([39](#39))

The work of the Jamaat-i-Islami and the Tablighi Jamaat is being
coordinated by the Nadwatul Ulama, Lucknow, presided over at present by
Abul Hasan Ali Nadwi popularly know as Ali Mian.

> …Associated with both M. Maududi and the Tablighi Jamaat, he has been
> concerned with protecting the Muslim way of life through Dini Talim
> Council…^([40](#40))
>
> Nadwi stated in an address at Jeddah (Saudi Arabia): ‘I am one of
> those who believe that a religious order cannot be established unless

The Tablighi Jamaat is busy world wide in recruiting soldiers for
Islamic *jihãd*. The merit one earns by working for Tabligh is enormous.

And Islamic jihãd like Tabligh is now world wide because the whole world
except some pockets where the Shari’a prevails, has become a vast spread
of *jãhiliyya*.

Wahiduddin Khan spells out the meaning of Tabligh when he writes:

> …Sometimes it becomes urgent to make peace, as at Hudaibiyya, and
> sometimes defence is urgently called for, as at Badr and
> Hunain…^([44](#44))

We cannot expect leaders of the Sangh Parivar to read a biography of the
Prophet, and find out what Hudaibiyya, Badr and Hunain stand for and
what “peace” and “defence” mean in the language of Islam, They are bent
upon repeating Mahatma Gandhi who refused to read the Dogmatics and
Polemics of Islam and claimed to know the “noble faith of Islam” better
then those who had studied this doctrine and its history from its
primary sources. He harboured a life-long illusion that the Maulanas of
the Jamiat-ul-Ulama-i-Hind would help him in bringing the Muslim masses
into the national mainstream. They helped him all right and to the hilt,
but only in stamping out even the least little voice of resistance to
naked Muslim aggression. He ended by becoming the Father of Pakistan,
and a *shahîd* in the service of *sarva-dharma-samabhãva*. We harbour
not the shadow of a doubt that the Sarva Panth Samãdar Manch is pushing
on the same path whatever has survived of Hindu society and culture in
the shrunken and shrinking Hindu homeland.

was the famous ‘alim and sufi who had invited Ahmad Shah Abdali to
invade India, slaughter Hindus in general and Marathas and Jats in
particular, and restore Muslim rule in India. See *Muslim Separation*,

Hindus in order to consolidate the Mughal empire in India.

(1238-1325) tomb at its centre has been a great centre for organizing
*jihãd* since the days of Sultan Balban (1266-86).  Chishtiyya sufis
trained at this place fanned out to all parts of India, and invited as
well as guided Muslim armies to invade Hindu Kingdoms everywhere. Some
of the famous sufi dargahs in the North and the South stand on spots
where these sufis settled down after destroying Hindu temples. Those
sufis who actually participated in wars and got killed are known as
*shahîds*. This place continues to be the greatest centre of Islamic
Fundamentalism today. Muslim infiltrators from Bangladesh are helped
from here.

[¹¹](#11a) Ibid., pp. 7-8. The Maulana does not mention that brutal
force had been used by Balban, the Khaljis and the Tughlaqs to drag the
brave Mewati Hindus into the fold of Islam. Nor does he mention that the
Mewatis’ spontaneous reaction to *namaz* was the same as that of the
Pagan Meccans when they saw the first converts doing this acrobatics in
a valley near their city.

[¹²](#12a) Ibid., pp. 8-9. Emphasis added in order to show the Maulana’s
view of *šuddhi* which the Vishva Hindu Parishad now names more aptly as
parãvartana.

an atmosphere of tolerance. “New human beings” means their brutalization

[¹⁶](#16a) Ibid., p.12. Emphasis added in order to convey that the
people of Mewat had been pulled out of their roots, brainwashed, and
turned into blood-thirsty beasts. Wahiduddin Khan conceals the fact that
this whole operation was financed by the Nizam of Hyderabad and many
other Muslim princes and moneybags.
