**PAKISTAN**  
**OR**  
**THE PARTITION OF INDIA**

BY  
Dr. B. R. Ambedkar

"More brain, O Lord, more brain! or we shall mar,  
Utterly this fair garden we might win."  
(Quotation from the title page of **Thoughts on Pakistan**, 1st ed.)

**\~\~\~\~\~\~\~**

INSCRIBED TO THE MEMORY  
OF  
RAMU  
As a token of my appreciation of her goodness of heart, her nobility of
mind and her purity of character  
and also for the cool fortitude and readiness to suffer along with me
which she showed  
in those friendless days of want and worries which fell to our lot.
