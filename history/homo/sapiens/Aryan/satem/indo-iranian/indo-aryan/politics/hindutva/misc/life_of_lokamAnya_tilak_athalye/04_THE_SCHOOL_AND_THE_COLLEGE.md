> We have undertaken this work of popular education with the 
firmest conviction and belief that, of all agents of human civili- 
sation, education is the only one that brings about material, 
moral and religious regeneration of fallen countries and raises 
them up to the level of most advanced Nations by slow and 
peaceful revolutions : and in order that this should be so, it 
must be ultimately in the hands of the people themselves.

mission (1882) 

Man's outlook of the world is necessarily dependent 
upon his environments. Howsoever indomitable be 
the individual will, it fails not to realise its limitations and 
has to shape its course accordingly. Gifted though he 
was with extraordinary ability, superabundent enthu- 
siasm and magnificent courage, the only outlet Mr. 
Tilak found for his energies was the comparitively mo- 
dest field of education. He and his colleagues clearly re* 
alised the complete hold which the alien rulers had ob- 
tained over the length and breadth of this vast country. 
Howsoever much the British Imperialists might boast of 
India's conquest by the sword, it has been fully and 
freely admitted by Seely that in the willing acquiesence 
of Indians in the British Suzerainty alone lay the great- 



THE SCHOOL AND THE COLLEGE 2^ 

€St permancy of that rule ; and the Educational system 
introduced into this country by the new rulers sought to 
secure this acquiescence by capturing the will, the in- 
tellect and the imagination of the people. Educa- 
tion, thus is an instrument by means of which the Gov- 
ernment has sought to consolidate its power and perpe- 
tuate its authority. In self-governing countries where 
the interests of the rulers and of the ruled are identical, 
the education that is imparted is necessarily of a highly 
ennobling kind. It kindles patriotism, refines senti- 
ments, strengthens moral sense and stimulates all the 
latent powers of the soul. But the education, which 
India has received during the last hundred years and 
more has been quite of a different nature. It has 
taught us to disbelieve our religion, disrespect our 
social order and even to disobey our parents. It has 
perverted our patriotism, has made materialistic our 
outlook of life and by causing us to neglect our ancient 
history and culture weakened our moral stamina and 
all but broken our national back-bone. But this is not 
all. The medium of the English language has put a 
crushing biurden on our students. Add to this the men- 
tal isolation of those, who were appointed to fix the 
curriculum and one can easily understand how the 
hobby-horses of various Directors and Senators have 
mined the youths of this country. Education, to be 
useful must be in the hands of the Nation's chosen 
leaders. Alien Bureaucrats and uns3mipathetic Mission 
aries have no right to shape our mental and moral equip- 
ment. They would, no doubt encourage the produc- 
tion of a class of well-trained clerks, obedient, loyal, 
■quiet, submissive and single-minded in the discharge o£

appointed duties. But they would try their best to 
discourage manliness, virihty and patriotism. 

If these statements are not now regarded as parado- 
xical the credit is due, among others to Mr. Tilak and 
his colleagues who started the New English School 
Poona, on January ist, 1880. On the opening day, 
only 19 students were enrolled. Within a couple of 
months the school stood fairly on its legs and by the 
end of the year the number rose to 336. By the end 
of 1881, it was above 600 and in January 1884, it stood 
at 858. The mangers of the school astonished the pub- 
lic by taking the very modest salary of Rs. 30 p. m. 
though every one of them was competent enough, in 
some other walk of life, to draw ten times as much. 
Dr. Hunter, President of the Education Commission was 
supremely satisfied with the wonderful spirit and solid 
improvements introduced by Mr. Tilak and others and 
has recorded (1882) his unreserved admiration in the 
following words : — 

" Throughout the whole of India, I have not yet wit- 
nessed a single institution which can be compared with 
this establishment. ^ * * This institution * * can 
rival and compete with success not only with the Gov- 
ernment High Schools in the country, but may favour- 
ably compare with the schools of other countries also." 

The question has been sometimes asked : ** How is it, 
that in his attempts to nationahse education, Mr. Tilak 
did not disdain to take Government grant ?" The 
answer is twofold. In the first place, Mr. Tilak did not 
surrender any of his principles in availing himself of the 
tax-payers* money through the Government. He did 
not bend his knees before the high-handed conduct of 



THE SCHOOL AND THE COLLEGE. 3 1 

educational authorities*. He was not called upon to 
obey Risley Circulars. Secondly, the difference between 
the circumstances of those times and the environments 
of to-day ought to be taken into consideration. To-day, 
you must either submit to the whims or caprices of the 
educational authorities or sever your connection with 
them altogether. But in the early eighties Mr. Tilak 
started his career with the hope of inducing the Govern- 
ment to transfer the whole of secondary education {and 
College education, if possible) to popular control. He 
regarded the spread of education as a preparation for 
the national struggle. He saw that though the Bureau^ 
crats were not willing to entrust to the children of the 
soil an iota of real political or military power, still they 
could be persuaded to part with educational control if 
we were persistent and enterprising enough. They 
pretended to hold over political rights only because we 
were not sufficiently educated. If pressed to educate us 
quickly, they pleaded the wish but regretted the inabi- 
lity to do so on account of shortage of money. It was 
the ambition of Mr. Tilak and his colleagues to so 
cheapen, spread and improve education that the Govern- 
ment could not, without going back on their own words 
reasonably refuse the transfer of secondary and col- 

* In the critical days of 1897-8, the Deccan Education Society 
had the misfortune of incurring the displeasure of the Bureau- 
cracy and had to submit to arbitrary orders of the Government. 
This is not perhaps the only occassion when the Society felt 
constrained to consider discretion the better part of valour 
In justice, we may add that latterly, under the distinguished 
Principalship of the Hon. Mr. Paranjpye, the D. E. Society has 
shown admirable firmness on more than one occassion and has 
refused to act against its conscience, merely to please ofiScial 
vrhims.

legiate education to the people. This will explain why 
he and his associates accepted such a low salary ; this 
also will explain why he accepted the Government 
grant. For some time, negotiations, informal no doubt, 
were actually going on regarding the transfer of the 
Deccan College to Mr. Tilak ai d his colleagues. But 
the reactionary element in the Government at last pre- 
vailed and Mr. Tilak's hopes were completely shattered. 

It is not to be supposed that the success achieved by 
the New English School in an incredibly short time was 
due to any accidental combination of favourable cir- 
cumstances. Far from this being the case, enormous 
difficulties met Mr. Tilak on every side. The vested 
interests that suffered raised a storm of abuse and mis- 
representation. The lack of public spirit made the 
work of collecting funds very difficult. Money came 
not in torrents but in dribblets. More formidable than 
the scarcity of money, was the difficulty of getting 
suitable men, willing to accept the work in true Jesuiti- 
cal spirit. The Kolhapur Defamation case, the sudden 
death of Chiploonkar, the incarceration of Tilak and 
Agarkar added to the difficulties. The patriotic fervour 
of Tilak, Agarkar and Chiploonkar greatly impressed 
even the green-eyed Times of India, which while recog- 
nising that the ambition of the founders of the New 
English School was legitimate, was somewhat afraid 
that this ambition was " destined to have momentous 
efiects on the future of India." 

Mr. Tilak was the soul of this devoted band. Modest 
and unassuming, he never loved lime-light. Though 
most of the work of organisation fell on his puissant 
shoulders still he never cared to figure as the Head. 



THE SCHOOL AND THE COLLEGE 33 

That honour he delegated to others. " I Hke to work *' 
he said " and never think of honours." 

In school, he taught Mathematics and sometimes 
English. His greatest difficulty was that he never found 
it easy to adopt his teaching to the capacity of his pupils. 
In this point Apte and Agarkar easily beat him. 

Another pecuharity which distinguished him from 
his colleagues was his supreme isolation from the lighter 
moods of his students. Generally the most popular 
teacher is he, who would occasionally find time to in- 
dulge in those digressions on current topics 
which are the delight of students. Apte, Agarkar, 
Gokhale, Bhanu and Gole, — all sometimes gave them- 
selves up to " fun and frohc." Mr. Tilak however was 
severely regardful of his lesson. Students could never 
draw him out. Indeed, the attempt even was never 
made by them. 

And yet he was, not perhaps the most popular, but 
certainly the most revered teacher. For him boys felt 
that mysterious regard which genius and greatness 
always evoke. 

With teachers of first-rate qualifications and capa- 
city like Tilak, Apte and Agarkar, it is no wonder that 
the results of the New English School at the Matricu- 
lation were exceedingly bright. The admiring citizens 
of Poona were proud of these young Uons and felt bound- 
less confidence in them. Indeed, the New English 
School began to be considered as the new centre of 
public life and inspiration in Maharashtra. The school 
of thought led by Ranade began to dwindle and its 
brightness paled before the lustre shed by the heroes of 
the New English School. No prophet was required to 
3 



34 LOKAMANYA TILAK 

foretell that before the avalanche of these activities 
Ranade's followers would be swept away. 

It is not necessary to go into the various improve- 
ments made in the system of education by the founders 
of the New English School. The utility and efhcacy of 
these improvements has been tested by time. Before 
1880, the distribution of History, Geography, Mathe- 
matics and Science over the different standards of 
schools was arbitrary, unsystematic and unsuited to 
young boys. Tilak, Apte and Agarkar made the neces- 
sary adjustment, which at that time provoked much 
comment. They also insisted on the vernacular being 
made the medium of instruction ; they discouraged the 
use of English as much as possible. Special attention 
was paid to the equipment which the students brought 
to the lowest English class and as this equipment was 
found to be very much below the normal — it is the 
same even now — a Vernacular school was started with 
the object of providing better intellectual material to 
the English school and every care was taken to make 
the instruction in the Vernacular school animated, more 
systematic and less rigid. An idea of the crude educa- 
tional methods of those times can be had from the fact 
that, when what is known as the "Subjects System/' 
was introduced in place of the old system, it 
was received in no friendly spirit and a storm of opposi- 
tion and criticism awaited an improvement which no 
man in his senses thinks of condemning now. 

It was impossible for Mr. Tilak and his colleagues to 
rest content with the establishment of a successful 
High School. Since the very foundation of the New 
English School, Mr. Tilak had cherished the ambition 



THE SCHOOL AND THE COLLEGE 35 

of starting a College. Besides, he believed that the 
establishment of a College would enable him to get 
from its alumni the right sort of men, properly imbued 
with the spirit of sacrifice and anxious like himself to 
cover the Presidency with a net-work of educational 
institutions. A preliminary meeting of the well-wishers 
of the New English School was held and on 24th Octo- 
ber 18S4 the Deccan Education Society was formed 
and an application to the University for permission to 
start an Arts College was made. It is needless to 
trace the slow developments of the College till 1890 
when Mr. Tilak after eleven years of hard work had 
to leave the Society. Suffice it to say, that most of the 
work of organisation, collection of funds etc. was done 
by him and Namjoshi. He was the guiding spirit of 
the institution and can claim a handsome share of 
the credit of having made it a success. 

As a professor, Mr. Tilak maintained an exceptionally 
high level. He was a specialist in Mathematics and 
Sanskrit ; and he was occasionally required to take 
Science also. His teaching was always thorough and 
satisfied the cleverest of students. It was marked by 
rapidity, profundity and originality which frequently 
was the despair of average students. 

The causes which compelled Mr. Tilak to sever his 
connection from the Society had their germs in the 
very initial stages of the progress of the New English 
School. They rapidly accumulated since 1885, result 
ing in greater and greater acrimony. It would have 
been better for the peace and harmony of the infant 
School and the infant College had more care and rigid- 
ity been observed with respect to the admission of new 



36 LOKAMANYA TILAK 

life-members, had the basic principles of the body been 
put down as articles of faith and had members joining 
the Society been required to observe them or withdraw 
from the body. As a result of this laxity, different tem- 
peraments could not harmoniously be blended by 
solemn obligations ; this want of harmony inevitably 
resulted in incompatibility of views, which, in its turn. 
Increased bitterness and finally brought about rupture- 
in 1890. Mr. Tilak and his associates started their 
career for the cheapening and facilitating of education. 
They placed before themselves the aim of establishing 
an Indian Educational Mission, forming a network of 
schools throughout Maharashtra on the Jesuitical idea of 
poverty and self-denial. In the discussions which Mr. 
Tilak had with Mr. Agarkar in 1879 this ideal was fuUy 
accepted. It was over and over repeated on each and 
every public occasion which they and their associates 
could get. It was repeated when Mr. Apte gave, on 
behalf of his colleagues, evidence before the Hunter 
Commission in 1882 ; it was repeated on the occasion 
of the visit to the institution of Sir James Fergusson, 
then Governor of Bombay (Feb. 1884). If Mr. Tilak's 
colleagues, later on found this oft-repeated pledge in- 
convenient, if by continuous and sometimes devious 
tactics they sought to temper its rigour, if regarding 
him as aknost an obstacle in the way they harassed 
him by magnifying his faults, questioning even his 
capacity, taxing him with self-assertion and self-glorifi- 
cation under the cloak of Divine disinterestedness and 
stoicism and by going to the length of passing a vote of 
censure upon him, surely it was no fault of Mr. Tilak 
that he felt himself obliged to resign. 



THE SCHOOL AND THE COLLEGE 37 

The first three years of the school were spent in the 
struggle of asserting its existence. When the school 
and the newspapers became accomplished facts, inspite 
of desertion, death, incarceration and disappointed ma- 
lice the next three years were spent in organizing the 
institutions. By the end of this period, the constitution 
of the D. E. Society was formed and the bye-laws of 
the managing board were passed on the model of the 
regulations of Missionary bodies. All life-members 
were to receive equal pay and had equal rights. As the 
monthly pay fixed was not very high, it was provided 
that under special circumstances gratuities might be 
granted in addition to monthly salaries. A further 
provision for accidents etc., was made by assuring the 
life of every member for Rs. 3,000 and Mr. Tilak who 
did the whole of this business thought that this arrange- 
ment would leave no motive for anybody to seek work 
outside the body and thus divert his energies in a 
different channel. 

When, however, the struggles and cares of establish- 
ment and organisation were over, some members began 
to long for more and began to talk of the growing needs 
of their families. The cry was catching and when the 
lead was taken by some of the elders newly admitted 
members who had but a dim perception of why and 
how the principle of sacrifice was adopted naturally 
joined in it and every excuse was pleaded to discover a 
loophole and break through the original understanding. 
'■•J The first attempt in this direction was made in 1885. 
It sought to remove the inequahties of payment receiv- 
ed by members. In the beginning (18S0) some mem- 
bers had taken no payment while others were allowed 



38 LOKAMANYA TILAK 

to draw more, even in after years in consideration of 
their special wants. It was proposed to remove these 
inequalities with effect from 1880, by making up the 
account of each life member since 1880, excluding the 
special gratuities in each case and the accounts were 
so adjusted as to make the sum drawn by each propor- 
tionate to the period of service. 

It was unfortunate that the conduct of the Kesari and 
Mahratta was combined with that of the School and the 
College. The financial position of the school improved 
earlier while the newspapers were not paying concerns 
at all. The writers did not get any profit from 
their work. As long as the whole body were working 
zealously for the joint concerns no difficulty arose. 
But when members began to count the market- 
value of their energy and ability, it so happened that 
while some ceased to write to the papers and devo- 
ted themselves to more paying pursuits, others had 
to devote the whole of their time to the Press without 
receiving anything. 

This brings us to the main question, " Whether or 
not a member of the Society could do some outside work 
for his private gain." In the initial stages of the school 
some members were paid extra gratuity for their 
special wants, because no member was to work in his 
private time for personal end. From 1885, however, 
the principle of equal pay and equal work began to be 
preached and it was urged that if any member had any 
special wants he should meet them by private work 
and that the duty of each and every member was to 
teach in the school for 4 hours and that, beyond that 
every individual was free to do what he liked. The 



THE SCHOOL AND THE COLLEGE 39 

result of this was that the membership of the D. E. 
Society began to be considered as a good start for a 
beginner in Poona and that if he had any energy and 
ambition, he could use it as a stepping stone for personal 
distinction. The scale of the salaries of the members of 
the Society was first increased to give them free time 
and energy to work for the common object and then 
the theory of four-hours' service v/as propagated to 
satisfy the financial ambitions of individual members, 
who priding themselves on the name of Indian Jesuits, 
were not willing to imitate the singleminded devotion 
of the European Jesuits. Mr. Tilak, therefore rightly 
insisted that either the outside work should be stopped 
or that, a rule should be made that the profits of the 
extra work should go to the common fund as in the case 
of Missionary Societies.* It was with this view that a 
resolution was passed, in February 1888, that if any 
special book was required for the school, it should be 
prepared by open competition and its copyright pur- 
chased by the Managing Board. The very first case, 
however that came for consideration, was decided on a 
contrary principle. Mr. Gokhale, who was given Arith- 

* Mr. Gokhale, who in these controversies had uniformly op- 
posed Mr. Tilak has himself framed the following rule for his 
Servants of India Society : — 

(Rule IX d) That he (a member of the Society) will be con- 
tent with such provision for himself and his family, if he has any, 
as the Society may be able to make. He will devote no part 
of his energies to earning money for himself. 

What Mr. Tilak insisted upon, in all the acrimonious contro- 
versies which his opponents in the D. E, Society thought fit to 
indulge in, was only this that a Life-Member of the Institution 
will devoie no part of his energies to earning money for himself. 



40 lOKAMANYA TILAK 

metics of Standard VII discovered that a suitable text- 
book was wanting and the Board resolved to make his 
book a text-book for 1889, before it was published. 

About this very time Mr. Gokhale, who had been for 
some time working for the Sarvajanik Sabha journal 
now thought of accepting the post of the Secretary of 
that association with 2 or 3 hours' regular work every 
day. Mr. Tilak objected to such a diversion of mem- 
bers' energies. He declared that it would be carrying 
the privilege of private work too far to allow members 
to contract such definite engagements outside the body. 
The Secretaryship had been offered to him before, but 
he had declined to accept it for the above reason. 

In February 1887, Mr. Agarkar found himself in 
money difficulties. Under ordinary circumstances, he 
should have put in an application for gratuity. But, 
while advocating members' right to earn extra money 
by doing extra work he had been chiefly instrumental 
in passing a resolution that the occasions for gratuities 
should be rare. He therefore brought before the Board 
a proposition to increase the monthly salary of all the 
life members. The only reason given for the proposed 
change was that the financial condition of the school 
permitted it. Mr. Tilak urged that if necessary to 
Mr. Agarkar, a gratuity might be given to him but the 
supposed prosperity of the finance was no ground for 
increasing salary, at least so long as the Society was 
not properly endowed. 

These and like discussions, frequently held, created a 
lot of irritation which left behind it a trail of bitterness 
and even rancour. Questions of general policy, of 
starting a Boarding House and a Technical school, of 



THE SCHOOL AND THE COLLEGE 4! 

accepting a European professor helped to widen the 
breach. Mr. Tilak steadfastly tried to remain loyal to 
the original ideals while others were equally determined 
to give way to circumstances. Finding the situation 
hopeless, Mr. Tilak took leave (June 1889) for one term 
with the object of ultimately withdrawing from the 
body. A compromise was then effected on the ques- 
tion of outside work, salaries and internal relations and 
then Mr. Tilak rejoined the school. But like previous 
arrangements, this too proved nothing more than a 
paper arrangement. So for the peace and harmony 
of the institution he loved most, Mr. Tilak, after a very 
painful struggle severed his connection from the D. E. 
Society (Dec. 1890). 

When Mr. Tilak has detailed these reasons in his 
memorable resignation, when the records of the D. E. 
Society bear witness to the incessant struggles between 
his lofty idealism and the continued efforts of some of 
his colleagues to improve their financial position at the 
cost of the great principle of self-sacrifice, is it not rather 
strange that those v/ho, though not eye-witnesses to the 
events culminating in Mr. Tilak's resignation have at 
least ready access to the documents of the Society, 
should have come forward to anyhow discredit Mr. 
Tilak in the eyes of the general public ? The Hon. Mr. 
Paranjpye, in one of his gratuitous attacks on Mr. Tilak 
has attempted to discover the causes of Mr. Tilak's dis- 
agreement with his colleagues. But he has not a word 
to say about the sordid considerations and disputes 
which disfigured the Society's Proceedings Book for a 
number of years. All these controversies he conveni- 
ently ignores and rushes to his own pet theories which. 



42 LOKAMANYA TILAK 

unsupported by evidence and having no foundation in 
facts should never have been propounded. According 
to Mr. Paranjpye, Mr. Tilak had two unpardonable 
faults. He never learned the simple lesson that two 
persons could differ on some points while agreeing on 
many others ; and worse still, Mr. Tilak was such a 
masterful personality that he could never work with an 
equal. The inevitable consequence followed. Mr. Tilak, 
unable to tolerate differences of opinions in his col- 
leagues became more and more overbearing in his deal- 
ings with them ; and jealousy completed the breach thus 
created by intolerance. 

Is there any shred of truth in these accusations ? 
Have they been supported by any evidence, real or 
imaginary ? The answer is no. That Mr. Tilak held 
strong views on many important problems of the day is 
well-known ; but that differences in opinions created 
the breach in the D. E. Society has yet to be established; 
and that Mr. Tilak allowed these differences so to over- 
power him as to influence his conduct with those in- 
terested in the work of the Society is indeed a large 
assumption. Why, we can enunciate just the contrary 
proposition and undertake to prove it from manifold in- 
stances on record. Unlike Messrs Apte and Agarkar — 
his principal opponents in the Society — Mr. Tilak was 
essentially a man of action ; and being a man of action 
he never hesitated to co-operate even with his oppon- 
ents. Times without number, Mr. Tilak had occasion 
to crosss words with Dr. Bhandarkar; but in the picket- 
ing campaign of 1908, Dr. Bhandarkar was his friend 
and ally. Times without number, Mr. Tilak had occa- 
sions to condemn the public conduct of Dr. Bhatavdekar; 



THE SCHOOL AND THE COLLEGE 43 

but in the astronomical conferences held in Maharashtra 
to improve the old calenders, Dr. Bhatavadkar was 
alwaj^s by his side. In the plague of 1897, Mr. Tilak 
co-operated even with the Government. In the famous 
Home Rule agitation, he joined hands with Mrs. Besant. 
There have been occasions when Mr. Tilak has co- 
operated with Mr. Paranjp3'e himself. If Mr. Tilak 
could co-operate with the missionaries, with the Govern- 
ment, with persons of the type of Dr. Bhandarkar, Dr. 
Bhatavadekar, Mrs. Besant and Mr. Paranjpye, surely 
the charge of intolerance falls to the ground and 
cannot by any stretch of logic or rhetoric be sustained 
against one, who of all others was chiefly instrumental 
in securing for the D. E. Society the patronage of 
Ranade, Bhandarkar, Telang, Mandlik, Wordsworth 
and many others. 

Mr. Tilak jealous ! Mr. TUak unable to work with 

his equals Mr. Tilak, who during eleven years of his 

life in the D. E. Society never once cared to accept the 
post of a Principal, Head-Master or Superintendent ! 
And prey, jealous of whom ? Not of Ranade or Telang 
— his intellectual peers ; but of Apte, Agarkar and 
Gokhale ! ! " Mr. Tilak saw soon after Gokhale's ad- 
mission to the society that here was a man likely to be 
his formidable rival." Mr. Paranjpye is here speaking 
of the Gokhale, not of 1905 or 1908, no, not even of 
1897 ; the Gokhale of 1885 or 1887 was, according to 
his own biographers, regarded by his own friends and 
Mr. Tilak's opponents as nothing better than a clever 
college student. Apte was a Sanskritist and nothing 
more ; Mr. Tilak's versatile genius could beat Apte on 
his own ground. As regards Agarkar, his title to fame 



44 LOKAMANYA TILAK 

rests more on his great sacrifice, his championship ot 
every kind of reform and his eloquent style, rather 
than on his genius and learning. In point of intellec- 
tual equipment, Mr. Tilak far surpassed all his collea- 
gues ; and if there was any jealousy at work, it must 
have been rather in the minds of those who, accustom- 
ed to regard Mr. Tilak as an equal ever since the 
college days, could not now bear with equanimity his 
enormous superiority. 

Whether Mr. Tilak should have so much valued the 
principle of self-sacrifice as to endanger unity and good- 
will might leave room for difference of opinion. But 
from the foregoing account it must be abundantly clear 
that, not jealousy or intolerance but the great principle 
of self-sacrifice on which Mr. Tilak would brook no 
compromise was responsible for Mr. Tilak's separation 
from his colleagues. The incident, however deplorable 
or painful brought happy results ; for the loss of the 
D. E. Society was the gain of India. One need never 
lament the day — howsoever unpleasant the circumstan- 
ces attending the event — when Mr. Tilak decided to give 
that to this country which he had so unselfishly and 
ungrudgingly given to the school and the college. Our 
only regret is that he did not leave the D. E. Society a 
few years earlier.
