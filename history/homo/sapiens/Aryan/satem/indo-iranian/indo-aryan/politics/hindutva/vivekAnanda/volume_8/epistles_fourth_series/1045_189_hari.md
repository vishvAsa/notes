6 PLACE DES ETATS UNIS,  
PARIS,  
*13th August, 1900*.

DEAR BROTHER HARI,

I got your letter from California. So three persons are getting
spiritual trances; well, it is not bad. Even out of that much good will
come. Shri Ramakrishna knows! Let things happen as they will. His work
He knows, you and I are but servants and nothing else.

I am sending this letter to San Francisco — care of Mrs. C. Panel. Just
now I got some news from New York. They are well. Kali is on tour. Write
in detail about your health and work in San Francisco. And don't be
indifferent to the question of sending money to the Math. See that money
goes certainly every month, from Los Angeles and San Francisco.

I am on the whole doing well. I am shortly starting for England. I get
news of Sharat. Recently he had an attack of dysentery. The rest are all
well. This time few got malaria; nor is it so prevalent on the banks of
the Ganga. This year, owing to the scarcity of rain, there is fear of
famine in Bengal also.

By the grace of Mother, go on doing work, brother. Mother knows, and you
know — but I am off! Now I am going to take a rest.

Yours affectionately,  
VIVEKANANDA.
