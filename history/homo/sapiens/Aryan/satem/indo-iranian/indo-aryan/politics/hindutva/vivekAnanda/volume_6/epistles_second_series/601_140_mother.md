I have duly received your letter and that of dear Haripada. Of course
you have ample reason to feel sorry for, but you see, I couldn't help
it. And what took me here also became a fiasco; neither could I go to
Sindh. It is the Lord's will. Now, I have an idea of proceeding to
Calcutta through Rajputana, Kathiawar, and Sindh. But some difficulty
may crop up on the way. If all goes well, I am certainly coming to
Sindh. You must have undergone a lot of difficulty in coming to
Hyderabad by arranging for leave etc. Any least trouble undergone, is
bound to produce its excellent results. Friday next I shall leave this
place, and have a mind to go via Saharanpur to Rajputana direct. I am
doing well now, and trust you too are in health and peace of mind. . . .

With best love and blessings to yourself and Haripada, 

Yours sincerely,

VIVEKANANDA.
