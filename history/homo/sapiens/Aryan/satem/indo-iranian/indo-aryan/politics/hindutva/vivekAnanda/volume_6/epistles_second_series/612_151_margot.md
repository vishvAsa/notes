MY DEAR MARGOT, (Margaret E. Noble or Sister Nivedita)

Yes, I am really getting well under the manipulations of magnetic
healing! At any rate I am all right. There was, never anything serious
with my organs — it was nerves and dyspepsia.

Now I walk miles every day, at any time — before or after meals. I am
perfectly well — and am going to remain so, I am sure.

The wheel is turning up, Mother is working it up. She cannot let me go
before Her work is done — and that is the secret.

See, how England is working up. After this blood-letting, (Swamiji
refers to the Boer war.) people will then have time of thinking better
and higher things than "war", "war", "war". That is our opportunity. We
run in quick, get hold of them by the dozens and then set the Indian
work in full swing.

I pray that England will lose Cape Colony, so that she will be able to
concentrate her energy on India. These capes and promontories never are
of any use to England except in puffing up a false pride and costing her
hordes in money and blood.

Things are looking up. So get ready. With all love to the four sisters
and to you,

VIVEKANANDA.
