\[*Daily Iowa Capitol*, November 30, 1893\]

The now celebrated Hindu monk, Swami Vivekananda will lecture for the
last time in Des Moines tonight. He will speak on "Life in India"
\["Manners and Customs of India"\] a most interesting theme. The

women are lovely, but American men are entirely too practical.
