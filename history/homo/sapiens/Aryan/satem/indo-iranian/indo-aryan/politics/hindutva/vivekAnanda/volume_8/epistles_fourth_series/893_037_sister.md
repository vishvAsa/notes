## XXXVII

*To Miss Mary Hale*

CAMBRIDGE,  
*21st December, 1894*.

DEAR SISTER,

I had not anything from you since your last. I am going away next
Tuesday to New York. You must have received Mrs. Bull's letter in the
meanwhile. If you cannot accept it, I shall be very glad to come over
any day â€” I have time now as the lectures are at an end, except Sunday
next. 

Yours ever affectionately,

VIVEKANANDA.
