SIMLA (CALCUTTA),  
*14th July, 1889*.

RESPECTED SIR, (Shri Pramadadas Mitra)

I was very glad to get your letter. In such circumstances many give the
advice to incline towards the worldly life. But you are truthful and
have an adamantine heart. I have been highly comforted by your
encouraging and cheering words. My difficulties here have almost come to
a close â€” only I have engaged the services of a broker for the sale of a
piece of land, and I hope the sale will be over soon. In that case, I
shall be free from all worry and shall at once go straight off to you to
Varanasi. 

Your servant,

VIVEKANANDA.
