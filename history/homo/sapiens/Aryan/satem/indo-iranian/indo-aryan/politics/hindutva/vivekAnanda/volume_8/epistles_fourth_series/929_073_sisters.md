*To the Hale Sisters*

6 WEST 43RD STREET,  
NEW YORK,  
*14th April, 1896*.

DEAR SISTERS,

I arrived safe on Sunday and on account of illness could not write
earlier. I sail on board the White Star Line *Germanic* tomorrow at 12
noon. With everlasting memory of love, gratitude and blessings,

I am, your ever loving brother,

VIVEKANANDA.
