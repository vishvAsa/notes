## CXLIX

NEW YORK,  
*15th Nov., 1899*.

DEAR MARGOT, (Margaret E. Noble or Sister Nivedita)

. . . On the whole I don't think there is any cause for anxiety about my
body. This sort of nervous body is just the instrument to play great
music at times and at times to moan in darkness.

Yours etc.,  
VIVEKANANDA.
