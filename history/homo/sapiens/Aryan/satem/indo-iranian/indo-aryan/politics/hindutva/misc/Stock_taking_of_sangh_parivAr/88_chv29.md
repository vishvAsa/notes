NEW DELHI, June 5 - The Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha (BJYM), the youth
wing of the BJP, will organise a conference of the Muslim youth to mark
the golden Jubilee celebrations of the independence.

Addressing a joint Press conference here today, BJYM’s all India general
secretary Shahnawaz Hussain and Delhi unit president Begraj Kathana,
said that conference at national level will be held here on June 7. It
will be presided over by Ms Uma Bharati. Prominent leaders, who will
also address the conference, include Mr Sikander Bakht, MP and Mr
Krishan Lal Sharma, MP.

They said that similar conferences will also be held later on at Lucknow
(June 11), Calcutta (June 15) and Hyderabad (June 26).

They said that the BJYM was against the policy of appeasement. They
clarified that the interests of the Muslims will be safeguarded if the
BJP came to power at the Centre.\*  
 

**Footnotes:**

\* The BJP is now out to confirm, on the 50th anniversary of the
Partition, the Congress-Communist thesis that it was not the Muslims but
the ‘Hindu communalists’ who divided the country. Small wonder that
Muslim should be invited by the BJP to celebrate a great triumph in the
history of Islam in India.
