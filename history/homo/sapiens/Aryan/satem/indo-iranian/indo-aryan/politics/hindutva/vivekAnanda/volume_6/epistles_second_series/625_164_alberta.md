6 PLACE DES ETATS UNIS,  
PARIS, FRANCE,  
*10th September, 1900*.

DEAR ALBERTA,

I am surely coming this evening and of course will be very glad to meet
the princess (probably Princess Demidoff) and her brother. But if it be
too late to find my way out here, you will have to find me a place to
sleep in the house.

Yours with love and blessings,

VIVEKANANDA.
