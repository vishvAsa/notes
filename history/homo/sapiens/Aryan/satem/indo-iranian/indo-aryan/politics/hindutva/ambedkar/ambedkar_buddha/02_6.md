> § 1. Conversion of Upali, the Barber
>
>  1. While going back, Upali the barber thought, "The Sakyans are a
> fierce people. If I go back with these ornaments, they will kill me,
> thinking that I have killed my companions and run away with their
> ornaments. Why should I not go the way these young men of the Sakya
> clan have gone?"  
>  2. "Why indeed should I not?" asked Upali to himself. And he let
> down the bundle of ornaments from his back, and hung it on a tree,
> saying, "Let him who finds it take it as a gift," and returned to
> follow the Sakya youths.  
>  3. And the Sakyans saw him coming from afar, and on seeing, they
> said to him, "What have you come back for, good Upali? "  
>  4. Then he told them what he felt, and they replied, "Thou has
> done well, good Upali, in that thou did\[st\] not return; for the
> Sakyans are fierce, and they might have killed thee."  
>  5. And they took Upali the barber with them to the place where the
> Blessed One was. And on arriving there, they bowed down before the
> Blessed One and took their seats on one side. And so seated, they said
> to the Blessed One:  
>  6. "We Sakyans, Lord, are haughty. And this Upali, the barber, has
> long been an attendant, Lord, upon us. May the Blessed One admit him
> to the Order before us, so that we may render him respect and
> reverence, and bow down with outstretched hands before him as our
> senior and thus shall the Sakyan pride be humbled in us!"  
>  7. Then the Blessed One received first Upali the barber, and
> afterwards those young men of the Sakya clan, into the ranks of the
> Order.
>
>   
> § 2. Conversion of Sunita, the Sweeper
>
>  1. There lived in Rajagraha a scavenger, by name Sunita. He earned
> his living as a road sweeper, sweeping away the rubbish thrown by the
> householders on the roadside. His was a low and hereditary
> occupation.  
>  2. One day in the early hours of the dawn, the Blessed One rose,
> dressed himself, and walked into Rajagraha for alms, followed by a
> large number of Bhikkus.  
>  3. Now Sunita was cleaning the street, collecting scraps, rubbish,
> and so on into heaps, and filling therewith the basket which he
> carried on a yoke.  
>  4. And when he saw the Master and his train approaching, his heart
> was filled with joy and awe.  
>  5. Finding no place to hide in on the road, he placed his yoke in
> a bend in the wall, and stood as if stuck to the wall, saluting the
> Lord with clasped hands.  
>  6. Then the Lord, when he had come near, spoke to him in voice
> divinely sweet, saying, "Sunita! What to you is this wretched mode of
> living? Can you endure to leave home and come into the Order?"  
>  7. And Sunita, experiencing the rapture of one who has been
> sprinkled with Ambrosia, said, "If even such as the Exalted One may in
> this life take Orders, why should I not? May the Exalted One suffer me
> to come forth."  
>  8. Then the Master said, "Come, Bhikku!" And Sunita by that word
> received sanction and ordination and was invested with bowl and
> robes.  
>  9. The Master, leading him to the Vihar, taught him the Dhamma and
> the Discipline, and said, "By the discipline of holy life, restraint
> and mastery of self, a man becomes holy."  
>  10. When asked how Sunita became so great, the Buddha said, "As on
> a rubbish-heap on \[a\] highway cast, a lily may grow, fragrant and
> sweet, so among rubbish-creatures, worldlings blind, by insight shines
> the very Buddha's child."
>
>   
> § 3. Conversion of Sopaka and Suppiya, the Untouchables
>
>  1. Sopaka was a pariah of Shravasti. In her travail at his birth,
> his mother fell into a long deep swoon, so that her husband and
> kinsfolk said "She is dead!" And they bore her to the cemetery and
> prepared to cremate her body.  
>  2. But on account of the storm of wind and rain, the fire would
> not burn. So they went away, leaving Sopaka’s mother on the funeral
> pyre.  
>  3. Sopaka's mother was not then dead. She died afterwards. Before
> her death she gave birth to a child.  
>  4. The child was adopted by the watchman of the cemetery, and was
> brought up by him along with his own child Suppiya. The child was
> known by the name of the community, Sopaka, to which its mother
> belonged.  
>  5. The Blessed Lord one day happened to pass by the cemetery.
> Sopaka, seeing the Lord, approached him. After saluting the Lord, he
> asked his permission to join him as his disciple.  
>  6. Sopaka was then only seven years old. So the Lord asked him to
> obtain his father's consent.  
>  7. Sopaka went and fetched his father. The father saluted the
> Lord, and requested him to admit his son to the Order.  
>  8. Notwithstanding that he belonged to the pariah community, the
> Lord admitted him to the Order, and instructed him in the doctrine and
> discipline.  
>  9. Sopaka later became a Thera.  
>  10. Suppiya and Sopaka had grown together from childhood; and
> Sopaka having been adopted and brought up by Suppiya's father, Suppiya
> learned the Lord's doctrine and discipline from his companion, Sopaka,
> and requested Sopaka to admit him to the Order, although Sopaka
> belonged to a community which was lower in rank than the community to
> which Suppiya belonged.  
>  11. Sopaka agreed; and Suppiya, a member who belonged to the
> despised community whose occupation was to perform the duties of
> watchmen in the cemetery, became a Bhikku.
>
>   
> § 4. Conversion of Sumangala and other Low Castes
>
>  1. Sumangala was a peasant of Shravasti. He earned his living by
> work in the fields, working with a little sickle, plough and spade.  
>  2. Channa was a native of Kapilavatsu, and was a slave in the
> house of Suddhodana.  
>  3. Dhanniya was a resident of Rajagraha. He was a potter.  
>  4. Kappata-Kura was a native of Shravasti. The only way he knew of
> to support himself, was to go about, clad in rags, pan in hand,
> seeking for rice-grains. Hence he became known as Kappata-Kura--"Rags
> and-rice." When grown up, he maintained himself by selling grass.  
>  5. All of them sought from the Buddha permission to become Bhikkus
> and enter the Order. The Buddha, without hesitation and without caring
> for their low birth or their previous condition, admitted them into
> the Order.
>
>   
> §5. Conversion of Supprabuddha, the Leper
>
>  1. Once the Exalted One was staying near Rajagraha, in the bamboo
> grove, at the squirrels' feeding-ground.  
>  2. Now there lived in Rajagraha at that time a certain man who was
> a leper, named Supprabuddha, a poor, wretched, miserable creature.  
>  3. And it happened at that time that the Exalted One was sitting
> there in the midst of a great multitude, teaching the Dhamma.  
>  4. And Supprabuddha, the leper, saw from afar the multitude
> gathered together, and at the sight he thought, "Without a doubt an
> alms-giving of food, both hard and soft, is toward yonder. Suppose I
> draw near to yonder crowd, I might get there something to eat, food
> soft or hard."  
>  5. So Supprabuddha, the leper, drew near that crowd, and he beheld
> the Exalted One sitting there amid a great crowd, preaching the Norm.
> So, seeing the Exalted One he thought, "No. There is no alms-giving
> here of food. It is Gotama the Samana preaching the Dhamma in the
> assembly. Suppose I were to listen to his teaching."  
>  6. So he sat down at one side, thinking, "I too will listen to the
> teaching."  
>  7. Now the Exalted One, reading with His thought the thoughts of
> that whole gathering, said to Himself, "Who, I wonder, of these
> present, is able to grasp the Truth?" Then He saw Supprabuddha, the
> leper, sitting in the crowd; and at the sight of him He knew, "This
> one can grasp the Truth."  
>  8. So for the sake of Supprabuddha, the leper, the Master preached
> a sermon, dealing in due order with these topics: on alms-giving, on
> the holy life, and on the heaven-world; and He pointed out the
> meanness and vileness of sensual desires, and the profit of freedom
> from the asavas.  
>  9. Now when the Exalted One saw that the heart of Supprabuddha,
> the leper, was softened, pliant, set free, elated, and full of faith,
> then He set forth to him the Dhamma most excellent of the Buddha: to
> wit, suffering, the cause of suffering, the ceasing of suffering, and
> the path.  
>  10. Then, just as a white cloth, free from stains, is ready to
> receive the dye, even so in Supprabuddha, the leper, as he sat there
> in that very place, arose the pure stainless insight of the Truth, the
> knowledge that whatsoever hath a beginning, that also must have an
> end. And Supprabuddha, the leper, saw the Truth, reached the Truth,
> perceived the truth, plunged into the Truth, crossed beyond doubting,
> was freed from all questionings, won confidence, and needing nothing
> further, being established in the Master's teaching, sprang up from
> his seat and drew near to Him, and there he sat down at one side.  
>  11. So seated he said to the Exalted One, "Excellent, O Lord,
> Excellent, O Lord, just as if, Lord, one should lift up the fallen,
> discover the hidden, point out the way to one bewildered, show a light
> in the gloom, saying, 'Now they who have eyes to see can see shapes,'
> even so in diverse ways has the Exalted One expounded the truth. I,
> even I, Lord, do go for refuge to the Exalted One, to the Norm and
> to the Order of Brethren. May the Exalted One accept me as His
> follower, as one who from this time forth even to life's end has gone
> to refuge in Him."  
>  12. Thereupon Supprabuddha, the leper, being taught, established,
> roused, and made happy by the Exalted One's pious talk, praised and
> welcomed His words, gave thanks and rose up from his seat, saluted the
> Exalted One by the right, and went away.  
>  13. Unfortunately it came to pass that a young calf flung the
> leper Supprabuddha down and gored him to death.
