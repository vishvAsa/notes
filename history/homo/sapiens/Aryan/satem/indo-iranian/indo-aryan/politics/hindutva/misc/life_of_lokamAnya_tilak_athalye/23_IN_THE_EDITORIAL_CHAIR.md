Mr. TILAK became the declared editor of the 
 Kesari on 22nd October 1887, and of the Mahratta 
on 3rd Spetember 1891. Since then, he conducted these 
journals as proprietor till the last, and though, the 
editorship was occasionally transferred to others, still 
he supplied the necessary inspiration, except during the 
intervals when he was a guest of His Majesty's gaols. 

From the very beginning, he neglected the Mahratta, 
Indeed, it may be said, he never liked journalism in 
Enghsh. He believed only in the vernacular as 
an instrument of national awakening. Hence he 
never cared to turn the Mahratta into a daily 
newspaper. English weeklies in India have always been 
a source of financial embarrassment to the conductors, 
and the Mahratta was no exception to this rule. At 
the time of Mr. Tilak's death, the circulation of the 
Mahratta stood at about 2000. 

With the Kesari he was in his element. A weekly paper, 
now with a circulation of over 35,000, it has moulded 
the national life of Maharashtra during the last 30 years. 
The Kesari, as the name indicates, stands for manli-

ness, strength. During all its vicissitudes, courage has 
never failed it. Its wisdom has been occasionally chal- 
lenged, its tact or fairplay. But not even the worst 
enmies have whispered cowardice to its discredit. 

During his life-time, Mr. Tilak conducted the Kesari 
nominally as a proprietory concern. In the evening of 
his life, he intended to put it on a democratic basis. 
It was only latteriy that the Kesari was a financial suc- 
cess. During the first lo years of his ownership of the 
paper, it was burdened with a heavy debt. During the 
last six years ctgain the extraordinary rise in the cost of 
paper did not make it quite a profitable concern, and in 
spite of the increase in the subscription rates, Mr. Tilak 
had to succour the paper from the profits of the Gita- 
Rahasya. Then there was the terrible expenditure of 
the long- drawn Tai Maharaj case, which had to be pro- 
vided for. In spite of all these difficulties, Mr. Tilak 
had unreservedly placed the cash-box of the Kesari at 
the entire disposal of the national propaganda. He 
spent hundreds and thousands for the national work, 
without boast or ostentation. He could have easily 
saved large amounts by substantially increasing the 
subscription, which his devoted readers would have 
gladly paid ; but he accepted the Kesari as a sacred 
trust and not as a business concern. He wanted it to 
reach the hands of the poorest of the poor and become 
the vehicle of his message. The cheapest and the best 
—it had and has no second. 

Though repeatedly pressed to turn it into a daily 
paper, Mr. Tilak till the last kept it as a we3kly and it 
was only last year that he made arrangements to bring 
it oat as a bi-weekly. The ideal he had kept before 



IN THE EDITORIAL CHAIR 32/ 

him — cheapness and excellence — was incompatible with 
the hurry and cost of a daily newspaper. 

Mr. Tilak and the Kesari were convertible terms. 
Their careers have been synonmous with the history of 
Maharashtra during the last 30 years. It has been a 
period of storm and stress. It has witnessed a vast 
transformation and has been the era of action and re- 
action — ^political and social. Through rocks and shoals, 
Mr. Tilak steered the Kc^sari, not caring for favour, nor 
afraid of frown, with a grim S3nse of duty . He was 
always bold but uniformly wary. His is one long 
record of intellectual and moral intrepidity, sustained 
by breadth of vision and depth of insight. The Kesari 
has been a castle for national fight, reared under the 
very nose of the Bureaucracy, proving impregnable even 
under shells of repression. Truly, it has become a 
national asset. 

The style of Mr. Tilak's Kesari was, like the physio- 
gnomy of its illustrious editor, plain, blunt, and aggres- 
sive. It was " reason fused and made red-hot with 
passion." It despised mere literary garnish and was the 
very negation of the soft suppleness of an intellectual 
epicurean. It had nothing of the flowing humour of Mr. 
N. C. Kelkar's style, the sweatness of Mr. Pangarkar's,* 
the grace of Mr. Agarkar's or of the subtle suggestiveness, 
dehcate irony and arrcstive coquetry of Prof- S. M. 
Paranjpye'st style. It reminds you, not of a cloister 

* Editor o£ the Mumukshu and tho author, among other 
books, of the life oE Moropant and the life of Tukaram. He is

bold articles had created (1899) quite a panic in Congress circles.

or an academy, not of a music-hall or a ball-room, but 
of the battle-field. Straight, pointed, Mr. Tilak's writ- 
ten words, arrow-like whistled through the air and hit 
the mark. They struck terror into the hearts of those 
who opposed him. The flunkeys, the Government 
minions and the busy nobodies were as mortally afraid 
of them as were the Reformers, the Moderates or the 
Liberals. Even the powerful Bureaucracy, protected by 
the prestige of the British Empire and the swords and 
guns of two hundred thousand soldiers, feared his at- 
tacks. Mr. Tilak has been frequently blamed for his 
strong language. We should, however, remember that 
he was the centre of acute political and social contro- 
versies extending over one generation. He could not 
be expected to rouse the masses to a sense of self-respect, 
self-reliance, and self-confidence except by pointed lan- 
guage. He, however, never hit below the belt. His 
criticism was impetuous but never vulgar, mean or 
vindictive. It bore ' no spots which all the perfumes 
of Arabia could not sweeten." 

His instructions to his assistants reveal the secret of 
his direct but homely style. " Imagine that you are 
speaking to a villager and not writing for University 
people. No Sanskrit words please. Avoid quoting sta- 
tistics. Don't scare away the reader by quoting figures. 
Keep them to yourself. Let your style be simple and 
homely. It should be as clear as day-light. The 
meaning must never be obscure." 

He was as good as his advice. True, in the early 
nineties, the Kesari was written in a more learned style. 
The exuberant scholarship of Mr. Tilak peeped through 
every column. Not a subject under the sun, but 



IN THE EDITORIAL CHAIR 329 

iound its way in the Kesari. At a minute's notice he 
poured forth columns of wonderful learning, duly 
adorned with a literary setting. Religion, philosophy, 
economics, agriculture, astronomy, science — there was 
no subject too difficult for his pen or mind. He not 
only assimilated all the available knowledge on the 
subject in hand, but put his own stamp on it. His 
luminous and often original writmgs on knotty 
questions of philosophy or science are an intellectual 
treat and would repay a careful perusal even to-day. 

But Mr. Tilak soon realised that it is not seed, lavishly 
sown that bears fruit, but the seed that is carefully put 
under the earth. This made him take into consider- 
ation the intellectual level of his readers. He put him- 
self the question " Whom do I write for ?" and it was 
got long before he gave himself the correct answer. 
uince then, his writings and speeches tended more and 
more to simplicity, without losing an iota of vigour. 

The equipment which he brought to bear on his edi- 
torial work was indeed, extremely rare, not only in 
this country but in any other. Possessed of a profound 
knowledge of the law, he did not care what restrictions the 
Government put on the freedom of the Press. He was 
prepared, he used to say, to convey his message under 
any rigours imposed by the law. Only the Bureau- 
cracy must adhere to the compact and must not shuffle 
its position again and again and try to seek new meaning 
into the definition of sedition every time, by straining 
its words and distorting their import and significance. 

His complete mastery over the Sanskrit language and 
literature, Vedic and post-Vedic, classical and philoso- 
phical, enabled him not only to form a style at once simple 



33P LOKAMANYA TILAK 

and eloquent, but to free journalistic diction from 
the unnatural pompousness — too often mistaken for 
eloquence, which the study of English classics had 
brought into Marathi. He formed a new style in 
Marathi journalism, and most of the Marathi journals 
of the day have adopted it. 

His profound knowledge of philosophy, science, 
metaphysics — Indian and European — stood him in 
good stead not only in making scholarly criticisms, but 
in the leading controversies of the last 30 years. Our 
social and religious life, ideas and institutions, are, so 
to speak, in the melting pot and the changes that are 
to be introduced must suit the basic ideas of our society. 
Mr. Tilak believed in what may be termed, " Indian 
Sociology " as Mr. Ranade did in " Indian Economics." 
His attitude towards Social Reform was largely deter- 
mined by sociological considerations. Others had seen 
only the crust that lies on the Indian civilisation 
and had pronounced it to be worthless. Mr. Tilak 
had gone deeper and had learnt how precious our 
culture is. 

He had studied the constitutional laws and histories 
of England and other European countries. Politics 
was his sp3cial study and he wanted to write an original 
thesis on this subject. At Mandalay, he devoted all his 
leisure to the study of the French and the German. 

It would thus be seen that the range of Mr. Tilak's 
reading was enormously vast. But he was not a mere 
reader of books. He meditated profoundly on what he 
read. He supplemented his reading and thinking by 
communicating with the best minds of his age. His 
active life afforded the necessary corrective to his 



IN THE EDITORIAL CHAIR 33r 

tiioaghts. The combination of a thinker and a fighter 
ia the person of its editor, gave the Kesari that amazing 
hold over its readers, which has hardly a parallel. 

Possessed of a wonderful memory, Mr. Tilak never 
cared to cultivate those methods by which many a 
newspaper writer tries to lessen the burden on his memo- 
ry. Mr. Tilak never kept notes nor topic-books. What 
he read, he remembered. What he remembered was 
alwaj^ ready at his beck and call. Quotations, extracts, 
references — everything was ready at a moment's 
notice. When he began to dictate articles for 
the Kesari, his amanuensis could, with very great 
difficulty, keep pace with him. But though Mr. Tilak 
was a rapid reader and a rapid writer, he was a very 
careful student. Before commencing to dictate, he 
carefully studied the question in all its bearing, ransack- 
ed all the available literature on the subject and then 
considered himself ready for the task. Thoroughness 
was the secret of his success. 

As the political life of the people is developing, it has 
been found necessary to supply suitable equivalents for 
English political terminology. Such v/ords as, Respon- 
sible Government, Imperial Federation, Passive Resis« 
tance, despotism. Limited Monarchy, Budget, Decentra- 
lization, do not easily lend themselves to translation. 
The brunt of the work of coining suitable Marathi 
words congenial to the genius of the language, had 
mainly fallen on Mr. Tilak, and it was very interesting 
and instructive to find this all-India leader discussing 
occassionally with his sub-editors possible equivalents 
to knotty political terms. Tlie word ' Bureaucracy ' in 
particular baffled him for a number of years and though 



332 LOKAMANYA TILAK 

he translated it by * Adhikari Varga, still he was not 
quite pleased with the expression. It was in the course 
of a lecture that the word * Nokarshahi ' occurred to 
him. So delighted was he with this word, that he 
called some of his literary friends at the end of the 
speech, and shared with them his joy at the addition of 
an extremely nice word to the Marathi vocabulary. 
Like the elephant of the story, Mr. Tilak's intellectual 
tusk, strong enough to bear the load of heavy timber, 
was also capable of lifting up a pin. His genius was 
.at once comprehensive and subtle. 

The expression " old wine in new bottles '* is gene- 
rally an empty compliment. Mr. Tilak's discussion of 
abstruse political theories, however, never struck his 
readers as something outlandish, something developed 
and prepared thousands of miles away and thence 
imported into India. His readers always felt at home 
with his writings and were never repelled by the English 
political thought which he discussed in Marathi. Mr. 
Tilak not only made his reader understand him, he made 
him also remember the main points in his writings. 
Some words, some expressions, some sentences in his 
articles always lingered in the memory of the reader. 
The article may be forgotten, but such words stick to 
the memory. Usually the title of the heading of the 
article was pithy and expressive. It summed up the 
whole of the article in some striking phrase. He always 
said that a good heading was worth half the writing. 

The object of the propagandist is to influence his 
readers. He seeks inspiration from the people, and 
returns it thousandfold. He receives instruction and 
imparts it at compound interest. Mr. Tilak bore this 



IN THE EDITORIAL CHAIR 333. 

truth in mind while conducting the Kesari. He con- 
centrated all his energies on the work of national 
awakening. Whatever helped that work found a place 
in the Kesari ; otherwise it was shunned, though the 
very best. People went to the Kesari, not to get news, 
but to interpret it. Their estimates of men and things 
were largely influenced by the Kesari. Their attitude 
was determined by that of the Kesari. A compliment 
from the Kesari has built up many a career ; its censure 
has marred it. Verily it has been a great dictator, 
though a benevolent one. 

This then, is the work of the Kesari. It has formed 
the style of Marathi Journalism ; it has expanded the 
thought-expressing capacity of the Marathi language. 
It has familiarised the people with the political thought 
of modern European life. It has widened the 
outlook of the sons of the soil. It has roused 
them to a consciousness of the glorious past and 
the wretched present. It has inspired them with 
new hope for the future. It has concentrated 
their attention to the live political issue ; and has 
mercilessly thrust in the back-ground, whatever was 
not directly concerned with that issue. It has set an 
example of devotion, of sacrifice, of plain speaking and 
of courage. It has taught them to keep their heads 
cool in storms and rear them again after the hurricane 
spent its force. It has been the centre of political edu- 
cation, the source of political agitation, and the pivot 
of aU national organization, in Western India. As one 
speaker aptly put it, it has transformed the Maharash- 
tra of 1890 to what it is in 192 1.
