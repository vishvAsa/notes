> § 1. Farewell to Vesali
>
>  1. Before he set on his last journey, the Blessed Lord was staying
> at Rajagraha, on the Vulture's Peak.  
>  2. After staying there for some time he said, "Come Ananda, let us
> go to Ambalathika."  
>  3. "So be it Lord!" said Ananda in assent, and the Blessed One,
> with a large company of the brethren, proceeded to Ambalathika.  
>  4. After staying at Ambalathika, he moved on to Nalanda.  
>  5. From Nalanda he went to Pataligama, the capital of Magadha.  
>  6. From Pataligama he went to Kotigam, and from Kotigam he went to
> Nadika.  
>  7. At each of these places he stopped for a few days and delivered
> a religious discourse, either to the brethren or the householders.  
>  8. From Nadika he went to Vesali.  
>  9. Vesali was the birth-place of Mahavira, and consequently a
> stronghold of his faith.  
>  10. But the Blessed Lord soon succeeded in converting the people
> of Vesali to his own faith.  
>  11. It is said that owing to drought, a famine ravaged the city of
> Vesali, to such an extent that people died in large numbers.  
>  12. The people of Vesali complained of it, in a general assembly
> convoked by them.  
>  13. The assembly, after much discussion, decided to invite the
> Blessed Lord to the city.  
>  14. A Lichchavi by name Mahali, a friend of King Bimbisara and son
> of the chaplain of Vesali, was sent to offer the invitation.  
>  15. The Blessed Lord accepted the invitation, and started with
> five hundred Bhikkhus. As soon as he entered the territory of the
> Vajjins there was a thunderstorm, rain fell in torrents, and famine
> disappeared.  
>  16. This is the origin of the welcome which the people of Vesali
> gave to the Blessed Lord.  
>  17. Having won their hearts, it was natural that the people of
> Vesali should give him a warm response.  
>  18. Then came vasa. The Blessed Lord went to Beluna for his vasa,
> and asked the brethren to make their vasa in Vesali.  
>  19. After finishing his vasa the Lord came to Vesali, with a mind
> to leave Vesali and move on his journey.  
>  20. So the Blessed Lord early one morning, robed himself, and
> taking his bowl, entered Vesali for alms; and when he had passed
> through Vesali and eaten his meal, he gazed at Vesali with an
> elephant's look, and addressed the venerable Ananda and said, "This
> will be the last time, Ananda, that the Tathagatha will behold
> Vesali."  
>  21. Thus saying, he bade farewell to the people of Vesali.  
>  22. He gave to the Lichchavis, when they took leave of him at the
> old city on their northern frontier, his alms-bowl as a memento.  
>  23. It was his last visit to Vesali. He did not live to return to
> it again.
>
>   
> § 2. Halt at Pava
>
>  1. From Vesali the Blessed Lord went to Bhandagam.  
>  2. From Bhandagam he went to Hatthi-gam, to Bhoga-Nagara.  
>  3. And from Bhoga-Nagara he went to Pava.  
>  4. At Pava the Blessed One stayed at the mango grove of one
> blacksmith, by name Chunda.  
>  5. Now Chunda heard that the Blessed One had come to Pava and was
> staying in his mango grove.  
>  6. Chunda went to the mango grove and sat near the Blessed One,
> who gave him a religious discourse.  
>  7. Gladdened by it, Chunda addressed the Blessed One and said,
> "May the Blessed One do me the honour of taking his meal together with
> the brethren, at my house tomorrow."  
>  8. And the Blessed One signified, by silence, his consent. Seeing
> that the Blessed One had consented, Chunda departed thence.  
>  9. Next day Chunda made ready in his dwelling-place sweet rice and
> cakes and some preparation of Sukara-Madhava. And he announced the
> hour to the Blessed One, saying: "The hour, Lord, has come, and the
> meal is ready."  
>  10. And the Blessed One robed himself and, taking his bowl, went
> with the brethren to the dwelling-place of Chunda, and partook of the
> food prepared by him.  
>  11. Again after the meal, the Blessed One gave a discourse on
> religion to Chunda, then rose from his seat and departed thence.  
>  12. The food offered by Chunda did not agree with the Blessed One.
> There fell upon him a dire sickness, the disease of dysentery, and
> sharp and shooting pain came upon him even unto death.  
>  13. But the Blessed One, mindful and self-possessed, bore it
> without complaint.  
>  14. Returning to the mango grove, and after nature was relieved,
> the Blessed One told Ananda, "Come, let us go to Kushinara," and the
> party moved from Pava.
>
>   
> § 3. Arrival at Kushinara
>
>  1. The Blessed Lord walked for part of the way. He soon felt the
> need for some rest.  
>  2. On the way, the Blessed One went aside from the path to the
> foot of a certain tree, and said to Ananda, "Fold, I pray you, Ananda,
> the robe; and spread it out for me. I am weary, Ananda, and must rest
> a while."  
>  3. "Even so, Lord!" said the venerable Ananda, in assent, to the
> Blessed One, and spread out the robe folded fourfold.  
>  4. And the Blessed One seated himself on the seat prepared for
> him.  
>  5. And when he was seated, the Blessed One addressed the venerable
> Ananda, and said, "Fetch me, I pray you, Ananda, some water. I am
> thirsty, Ananda, and would drink."  
>  6. Ananda replied, "This river Kakuttha is not far off, is clear
> and pleasant, cool and transparent, easy to get down into, and
> delightful. There the Blessed One may both drink the water and cool
> his limbs. The water of this stream is foul and turbid."  
>  7. The Blessed One was too weak to walk down to the river. He
> preferred to have the water of the nearby stream.  
>  8. Ananda brought the water and the Blessed One drank it.  
>  9. After resting for a while, the Blessed One with the company of
> the brethren went on to the river Kakuttha; and when he had come
> there, he went down into the water, and bathed, and drank. And coming
> out again on the other side, he went on to the mango grove.  
>  10. And when he came there, he again asked \[for\] his robe to be
> spread out, saying, "I am weary and would lie down." The robe was
> accordingly spread out, and the Blessed One laid himself down on it.  
>  11. After resting for a while, the Blessed One got up and said to
> Ananda, " Let us go on to the Sala grove of the Mallas, the Upavana of
> Kushinara, on the further side of the river Hiranyavatti."  
>  12. On reaching the place in the company of Ananda, he again asked
> Ananda to spread his robe between the twin Sala trees. "I am weary and
> would lie down."  
>  13. Ananda spread the robe, and the Blessed One laid himself down
> on it.
