IN the darkest hour of Mr. Tilak's life, when neither 
friend nor foe expected him to survive six long years 
^f transportation, the Hon. Mr. Gokhale could not forget 
his old grievances against him. But Mr. Tilak was 
nothing if not chivalrous, and on hearing the unexpect- 
ed news of Mr. Gokhale's death, (19th February 19 15) 
he motored down to Poona from Sinhgad to do honour 
to the great Moderate. The funeral oration delivered 
by him on this occassion is intensely passionate. Mr; 
Tilak said : — 

" This is not a time for cheers. This is a time for 
shedding tears. This diamond of India, this jewel of 
Maharashtra, this prince of workers is laid to eternal 
rest on the funeral ground. Look at him and try to 
emulate him. * * * Every one of you should place 
his life as model to be imitated, and should try to fill 
up the gap caused by his death ; and if you will do your 
level best to emulate him in this way, he will feel glad 
even in the next world/.

In the Provincial Conference (May 1915) in moving the 
resolution of condolence to Mr. Gokhale's family Mr. 
Tilak described how he was partially responsible- 
for introducingMr. Gokhale into the field of public life. 
This chivalry towards his political opponents has been 
markedly displayed by him on several occassions and 
it reflects great credit on Mr. Tilak, whose heart, stern 
and unbending though it was in political warfare, always 
responded to every note of affliction. In November 
1915 died Sir P. M. Mehta mourned by Mr. Tilak and the 
country at large. 

Towards the British Empire, in its hour of danger, 
he was equally chivalrous. We have already seen how, 
immediately on the outbreak of the great War (1914)^ 
Mr. Tilak publicly declared his willingness to co-operate 
with the Government. He suggested the raising of a 
citizen army. But, though even the most Moderate lea- 
ders enthusiastically favoured the idea, the Bureaucrats 
rejected the spontaneous offer of help frcm educated 
India. Of course, we were all patted on the back for 
the " fine Imperialistic instinct," but in this life-and- 
death struggle with Germany, instead of availing them- 
selves of help from whatever quarter it came, the powers 
that be confined the work of raising recruits only to 
those classes who were devoid of all patriotic conscious- 
ness. Had the attention of Mr. Asquith's Government 
been drawn to India's eagerness to fight for the Empire, 
America's help would have been superflous and conscrip- 
tion in England would nor have been necesssary. It 
was only when Mr. Lloyd George became Premier 
(December 1916) that the Cabinet called upon the 
Viceroy to make special efforts to raise recruits in India* 



THE GREAT HOME-RULER 22$ 

The Premier even went out of his way and suggested 
that an attempt must be made to catch the imagination 
of Indians and to stimulate their enthusiasm. But 
Lord Chelmsford himself lacked that precious quality 
of imagination and his associates wanted rather to 
damp than rouse the enthusiasm of the people. Had 
a Round-table Conference of India's trusted leaders 
been convened and the necessity of supplying strong 
contingents been explained to them, a few lakhs of 
young Indians would have at once joined the colours. It is, 
indeed, pitiable to find that the officials did not display 
even a fraction of that enthusiasm in raising citizen sol- 
diers which they did in collecting the war-loan. A Defence 
India Force of 6,000 was advertised for ; 6,000 in thirty 
crores of people ! ! The necessary Bill was passed. No 
assurance was given with regard to Home Rule, no assur- 
ance with regard to commissioned ranks to the Volun- 
teers ! Still the enthusiasm of the people knew 
no bounds. Mr. Tilak led the agitation at Poona and 
Bombay by powerful speeches, calling upon the youth, 
as they valued their country's freedom to suspend 
studies for a year or two and vindicate the fair name 
of their country. " If age and grey hair are no disqualifica- 
tions, I am prepared to stand in the fighting line." said he I 
But it was to no purpose. Eight hundred men at 
Bombay volunteered themselves on the spot. It seemed 
as if the Bureaucrats did not want the help. They 
signalized their appeal for the " Defence of India Force " 
by a resort to the notorious " Defence of India Act."! ! A 
few hours before Mr. Tilak's powerful appeal to the 
young men, he was served with an order from the 
Punjab Government prohibiting him from entering the 
15 



226 LOKAMANYA TILAK 

Punjab ! Surely, this was " Co-operation " with a 
vengeance ! The satrap of the Punjab led the way ! 
The Delhi Commissioner followed suit ; and wonder of 
wonders , Mr. Tilak had not even dreamt of going 
over to the Punjab or to Delhi. When the Premier 
wanted an appeal which would fire the imagination of 
the Indians, here was an appeal of a very different 
sort. But this was only the beginning. The Press 
Deputation that waited on the Viceroy returned cruelly 
disappointed. The Press Act must still disfigure the 
Statute Book. Instead of promising substantial con- 
cessions to the people, the Government deprecated 
in strong langauge political agitation. Coercion was 
threatened. The threat was soon carried out and Mrs. 
Besant, the tall Poplar of Indian Politics was intern- 
ed. These were some of the measures intended to 
persuade the Indians to become soldiers of the Empire ! 
It is no wonder that the movement of a citizen army, 
thus ushered into existence soon collapsed. 

But Mr. Tilak did not like that matters should rest 
here. He wanted to carry the case right up to the 
British Democracy and explain to it the state of things 
in India. He knew that if he could only convince the 
British public that the military resources of India were 
abundant and could well be availed of for the speedy 
termination of the War, not only would India get the 
military training denied to her these hundred years and 
more, but the solution of the Politicial problem also 
would be prompt and liberal. He tried his best to 
finduce the Congress to send a Deputation to England^ 
When, at last that hope was gone, he led the Home 
Rule League Deputation. As fates would have it, the 



THE GREAT HOME-RULER 22/ 

War Cabinet refused to allow the Deputation to sail at 
the last moment. In vain did Mr. Tilak appeal. Evi- 
'dently the reactionary element in the Cabinet was 
powerful and Mr. Tilak had to rest content with a cable 
to the Premier suggesting that India could supply five 
to ten millions of men, if our youths were made to feel 
that they were not fighting to establish a principle 
abroad which was not applied to them in own mother- 
land. 

At the Delhi War Conference (April 1918) Mr. Tilak 
was not even invited ; at the Bombay War Conference 
(June 1918), though invited and asked to speak he was 
not allowed to continue, but had to stop after speaking 
only for a couple of minutes. Mr. Tilak wanted to 
show how recruiting could be made popular ; but 
as the Government had their own ideas in the 
matter, the Home Rulers were invited to the 
Conference only to hear an ill-advised homily deli- 
vered to them by His Excellency the Governor (Lord 
Willingdon). 

It will be thus seen that Mr. Tilak strenuously at- 
tempted to help the Government in their hour of need 
and trial; but his well-meant efforts met only with fail- 
ure and even rebuffs. But the irony of it all was that 
though Mr. Tilak had made attempts, which the blun- 
dering Bureaucracy frustrated, to encourager recruiting 
he was (August 1918) served with an order prohibiting 
him from lecturing without the previous permission 
of the District Magistrate ; and what was the reason ? 
Mr. Tilak, presiding at the annual Shivaji Festival 
{22nd June 1918) spoke in a way " calculated to dis- 
courage recruiting." Only a week before, Mr. Tilak had. 



228 LOKAMANYA TILAK 

publicly undertaken to enlist 5,000 recruits within six 
months on receiving an assurance that the highest 
military career without distinction of caste, creed or 
colour would be thrown open to the recruits ; and as 
guarantee of good faith, he had sent to Mahatma Gandhi 
a Deposit Receipt for Rs. 50,000 the amount to be forfeited 
as penalty if certain conditions were not fulfilled. Com- 
ment is superflous on these two pictures — Mr. Tilak 
pledging his word and money in support of recruiting 
and the Government of Bombay accusing him of " dis- 
couraging recruiting." 

Though Mr. Tilak was prepared to help the Govern- 
ment in every way to wage the war with success, he 
was not wilhng to shelve the all-important question of 
Home Rule. To those of the Bureaucrats who wanted 
Indians not to press contentious questions upon their 
attention, Mr, Tilak explained that Liberty is and ought 
to be always a non-contentious topic. It was absolu- 
tely impossible, he said, for India to watch with folded 
arms the stupendous conflict in Europe between Auto- 
cracy and Democracy. A vast intellectual revolution had 
been brought about in India as a result of the World-war, 
The moral, intellectual and political outlook of even the 
most ignorant villagers had widened. Even they had 
begun to take interest in the politics of their own country 
and that of the world at large. The declarations of respon- 
sible ministers, interpreting this world-war as a war of 
Liberty had considerably helped the national awaken- 
ing ; and under these circumstances, it was impossible 
for Indians to keep quiet. Lord Willingdon had led the 
way by asking Mr. Gokhale to make a statement of 
post-war reforms. It was, therefore, in the interests 



THE GREAT HOME-RULER 229 

-of India and England alike, that this long-delayed set- 
tlement should be made. 

During 1915 and 1916, Mr. Tilak worked assiduously 
to organize his party. A strong party needs (i) a magnetic 
leadership (2) a rallying point, and, (3) a war-cry. In 
the personality of Mr. Tilak that first essential was found. 
The National Congress would have been an ideal rally- 
ing point. But it was still in its inglorious and suicidal 
isolation. The attempted compromise had failed (1914). 
Mr. Tilak, therefore, decided to hold a Session of the Pro- 
vincial Conference, the machinery of which was still ia 
the hands of the Nationalist Party. Under the able presi- 
dentship of Mr. Joseph Baptista, the Nationalists, more 
than 1,000 in number met at Poona ; and this excep- 
tionally large number of delegates, together with the 
enthusiasm which marked the proceedings conclusively 
proved that the party was still powerful and had a 
bright future before it. This conhdence was increased 
by the Moderate Conference, which was held a couple 
of months later and which, totally lacking in good at- 
tendence and enthusiasm, could seek consolation only 
in the fact that Lord Willingdon had kindly paid it a 
visit. The Belgaum Provincial Conference (1916), as 
successful as the Poona one, strengthened the Nation- 
alist in the belief that the future was in their hands. 
The success of the Poona and Belgaum Conferences 
nerved the Nationalists to join the Congress even 
though the concessions to their sentiments and self- 
respect were tardy and halting. 

It was this Poona Conference which gave the Nation- 
alists, the necessary war-cry — Home Rule. When the 
Moderates were busy only with the preparations of 



^30 LOKAMANYA TILAK 

schemes of political reform, Mr. Tilak gave his country* 
men something more inspiring. Ever since his returm- 
from prison he had fixed his heart on a tremendous 
agitation in favour of Home Rule ; knowing that the 
Bureaucracy would question the legality of the move- 
ment with the object of resorting to repression, he in- 
tended to introduce a Bill in Parliament through the 
good cfiices of Labour leaders and then concentrate all 
his activities on a vast propaganda. The sudden ad- 
vent of the war came to his rescue. The Bureaucracy 
with their armoury full of repressive legislation had to 
keep quiet and bide their time. With the Indian army 
sent away to France, repression was out of the question; 
and so the Nationalists got the necessary respite to- 
mobilize their forces and they were not slow to take full 
advantage of this opportunity. 

During these days Mr. Tilak's dealings with the two 
other parties were unexceptionable. Conscious of the grow- 
ing virilitj^ of the Naticnalists, he could afford, especially 
in the larger interests of the country to be generous m> 
bis dealings with the Moderates. Mrs. Besant too, in 
spite of occasicnal lapses was on the path of ccmplete 
alliance wilh him. the felt that she was regarded as 
an interloper by the leading Modeiales and was feared 
and distiusted by them. Mr. Tilak's vision was so 
much f cssessed with the future and its immense possi- 
bilities that he was in no meed to keep open the old 
sores. He tried to placate the Moderates and did his 
best to induce them to co-operate with him. The reso- 
lutions of the Pcona and Belgaum Conferences were 
drawn up with a 'skill that silenced the ultra-Modera- 
tes ; and lor the sake of unity, Mr. Tilak defered his. 



THE GREAT HOME-RULERj 231 

full programme of activities in connection with Home- 
Rule. 

A notable instance of Mr. Tilak's desire for unity can 
be seen in his hearty acceptance of the " Reform Memo- 
randum " of the nineteen elected members of the 
Imperial Legislative Council (October 1916). Left to 
himself, Mr. Tilak would have made more radical 
demands and we know some of his Bengal followers did 
actually make them. But Mr. Tilak wanted complete 
unanimity ; and so he was willing to take his stand on 
the memorandum with its subsequent development, vix 

— The Congress-League-Scheme. 

The inauguration of the Indian Home Rule League 
(23rd April 1916) was also a step in the same direction. 
Mr. Tilak clearly reahsed that the Congress with the 
small survivors of the Old Guard would not go in for the 
radical propaganda he wished to concentrate upon. 
If the co-operation of the leading Moderates was de- 
sired, the pace of our activities must be slowed down j 
and this he was unwilling to do. He therefore started 
the Indian Home Rule League where he and his enthu- 
siastic followers would have a free hand. As a conces- 
sion to the misgivings of the timid Moderates the Home 
Rule League accepted the creed of the National Congress, 
a thing which gratified the(Right) Hon. Mr. Shrinivasa 
Shastri. But the Government was not so gratified. 
They wanted to crush the Heme Rule Propaganda by 
striking at the towering personality to whose organising 
genius the League owed its birth. 

This year (1916), the sixty-first anniversary of Mr. 
Tilak's birth was celebrated in Maharashtra. It was 
certainly a proud and glorious day. The harassments 



232 LOKAMANYA TILAK 

and persecutions that had fallen to Mr. Tilak's share 
were simply innumerable. Only he could have emerged 
unscathed out of such a terrific ordeal. More, he turned 
seeming defeats to account and successfully enhanced 
his prestige and honour from out of every reverse. 
Since 1890, he had been steadily gaining in power and 
popularity, while latterly the tide of his influence had 
become irresitible. No wonder, that, not only those 
who were associated with him in politics but many 
others took part in the celebration. A large meeting 
attended by over 8,000 persons was held (23rd July). 
Friends and admirers from different parts of Maharashtra 
read addresses and delivered congratulatory speeches. 
A dress of honour, several individual presents and a huge 
sum of one lakh of Rupees — testified to the feelings of 
his admirers. Sitting heavily garlanded in the midst 
of jubilant friends and well-wishers, Mr. Tilak thought 
of the past ; " Memories of storm and suffering " said 
he " rather than those of comparative happiness rise 
before my mind's eye." He was also saddened to find 
that those with whom he started his career in the early 
eightees — Chiplunkar, Dharap, Apte, Kelkar, Agarkar, 
Namjoshi, Gokhale — had " shuffled off their coil " one 
after the other. He alone remained to represent them. 
" Looking into the future " said he " after completing 
sixty years, one's mind cannot but be filled with mis- 
givings ; and with declining strength one is apt to feel 
less hopeful. But I devoutly hope that with your 
support, I may be granted life and strength to add to 
whatever work of public good I may have done." 

When, under somewhat similar circumstances, Par- 
Bell was presented with an enormously big cheque, he 



THE GREAT HOME-RULER 23J 

<quietly pocketed it and did not so much as thank his 
iriends for their generosity. He took the present as a 
matter of course. Mr. Tilak was made of a far finer 
stuff. With simple modesty and characteristic gener- 
osity, he said : — 

" I do not know what I can do with the money. I 
do not want it for my own sake nor would it be proper 
for me to accept it for personal use. I can only accept 
it in trust to spend it in a constitutional way for National 
work after adding my own quota to it." 

If the people brought their birth-day present to Mr. 
Tilak, the Government, too, contributed their mite. 
They, too, sent a birth-day present to Mr. Tilak in the 
form of a notice calling upon him to show cause why he 
should not be bound over for good behaviour for a 
period of one year in a sum of Rupees 20,000 in his own 
recognizance and in two securities of Rs. 10,000 each. 
This is a striking illustration of how " Mr. Tilak's public 
life has been like a double-faced Janus — one face of it 
expressing the enjoyment and the delight of public ap- 
preciation and the other, inseparable from the first, 
expressing the toil of determined resistance to official 
persecution." 

The Government wanted to silence Mr. Tilak, not to 
imprison him ; perhaps, the war came in the way. 
They, therefore, picked up three of his speeches — the 
^one delivered (ist May 1916) at Balgaum and the 
other two at Ahmadnagar (31st May and ist June 
1916). These speeches were models of sobriety and 
moderation. " Almost every alternate sentence pro- 
claimed the speaker's loyalty to the British connec- 
tion." Failing to find stronger exhibitions of Mr. 



^34 LOKAMANYA TILAK 

Tilak's disloyalty, the Government fixed on these Home 
Rule speeches to launch their offensive against him. 
Through their counsel, they took care to inform the 
court and the world at large, that they took exception 
to Mr. Tilak's lectures on Home Rule and not to Home 
Rule itself. Mr. Binning in opening the case on 7th 
May 1916 before the District Magistrate, Poona, did 
not hesitate to call Mr. Tilak's declarations of loyalty as 
a mere cloak to defend himself from the clutches of 
law. He (Mr. Binning) questioned Mr. Tilak's bona 
fdes, laid stress on isolated passages and pressed for 
conviction. Mr. G. W. Hatch, District Magistrate 
placed rehance on Mr. Justice Strachey's interpretation 
(misinterpretation, we must now say) of the word dis- 
affection which was regarded as meaning " absence of 

ajffection." " Looking at these speeches, as a whole, 
fairly, freely and without giving undue weight to isola- 
ted passages " the only impression produced on the- 
mind of the Magistrate was that " Mr. Tilak wanted 
to disaffect his audience towards the Government " and 
knowing that he could not interest his audience in his 
arguments unless he illustrated them forcibly told them 
" that they were slaves, that their grievances remained 
undressed and that the Government only considers its 
interests, which are ahen to those of the Indians, and 
intends to keep the people in slavery under the 
excuse that Indians are not fit to rule themselves.'' 
The Magistrate, therefore, under Section 108 of C. P. 
Code, directed Mr. Tilak to enter into a bond in a sum of 
Rs. 20,000, with two sureties each in the sum of Rs. io,ooa 
to be of good behaviour for a period of one year. 
The decision was, however, reversed (9th November 



THE GREAT HOME-RULER 23$ 

1916) as it deserved to be, by Mr. Justice Batchelor 
and Justice (Sir) Lallubhai Shah in their separate but 
concurring judgments. (The Hon.) Mr. Jinnah ably 
defended Mr. Tilak both in the lower and the revisional 
court. But though Mr. Tilak triumphed, still his 
main points were not satisfactorily solved. The main 
feature of his speeches as the Times of India then re- 
marked was a distinction between the King and the 
King's Government. This sage paper shrewdly re- 
marked that if Mr. Tilak wanted, by this subtle distinc- 
tion to evade a law, with the meaning of which he ought 
to have been familiar, then "he is far less astute than. 
we thought him to be." This is not however a question 
of the evasion of the law or of that astuteness of the 
offender. Nor can it be set at rest by the opinions of 
the two learned Judges, Mri Justice Batchelor and Mr. 
Justice Shah. Mr, Tilak openly and sincerely professes 
his loyalty to His Majesty the King Emperor and the 
British Parliament which really are " the Government 
by law established in India." He claims full freedom 
to criticize the administration of the country. But 
Mr. Justice Batchelor holds that Government could act 
only through hum.an agency ; and as the Civil Service is 
admittedly the principal agency, where it is criticised 
en blcc, in an intemperate language, hatred of the Civil 
Service and consequently hatred or contempt of the 
Government is likely to be the result. According to 
this decision, it is purely a question of fact dependent on 
the language used and not on the distinction on which 
Mr. Tilak and his counsel relied. Regarding Mr. Tilak's 
speeches, Mr. Justice Batchelor writes as follows : — 
*' Probably the fairest way to ascertain the effect i& 



■236 LOKAMANYA TILAK 

to read the three speeches from beginning to end, 
quietly and attentively, remembering the arguments 
and remembering the politically ignorant audience to 
whom Mr. Tilak was addressing. I have so read these 
speeches, not once, but several times, and the impres- 
sion left on the mind is that, on the whole, despite cer- 
tain passages which are rightly objected to by the 
prosecution, the general effect would not probably and 
naturally be to cause disaffection, that is hostility or 

enmity or contempt " 

Mr. Tilak's triumph was the triumph of the Home 
Kule cause. His enemies were crest-fallen. The Times 
of India, which immediately after the decision of the 
District Magistrate, had preached a homily to Mr. Tilak 
and poured out its venom in the " Politics in the 
Deccan " was compelled, knowing discretion to be the 
better part of valour, to unreservedly withdraw the re- 
marks. An attempt was made within a fortnight of 
the decision of the High Court to lure and terapt Mr. 
Tilak to disobey the District Police Act. At Gadag, 
•where Mr. Tilak had gone on private business, the Dis- 
trict Magistrate, finding that the people had assembled 
to do hirq honour, served upon him an order prohibiting 
him from delivering any harangue. This order was served 
not at the eleventh hour, but at he twelfth 
and a less astute or farsighted man than Mr. Tilak 
would have felt tempted to test its legality by 
breaking it. Mr. Tilak, however, refused to allow 
the District Magistrate to regain the ground 
which the Government had lost by their deba- 
cle in the Security Case. Ultimately, pansupari 
^as given to Mr. Tilak at the meeting and the 



THE GREAT HOME-RULER 237 

proceedings ended without any hitch after Mr. Tilak had 
made a short speech. 

In October 19 16, Mr. Tilak attended the Ahmedabad 
Provincial Conference under the presidency of Mr. 
Jinnah. He received a grand reception from Gujarat 
He exhorted the Conference to support the constitu- 
tional reforms suggested in the " memorandum of 19 " 
In November he was elected a member of the All -India 
Congress Committee. 

It is pleasant to recall these days when he worked 
band-in-hand with Mrs. Besant. The Home Rule Pro- 
poganda was in full swing. The Bureaucrats were 
non-plussed, the Moderates were shaking their heads 
with doubt and hesitation. The nation was drunk with 
enthusiasm. In Europe, Autocracy was being shattered 
to pieces. India's loyalty was clear as the sun. The 
British Nation was grateful ; the reactionary element 
was weak and helpless. The sky was resounding with 
the cry of Reforms and though many an advanced 
Moderate and valiant Nationalist did signal service to 
the National Cause during this period, posterity will 
justly give credit to the two mighty Lieutenants of the 
Goddess of Liberty for having kept the flag flying — 
Mr Tilak and Mrs. Besant,
