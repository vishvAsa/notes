>   
> § 1. The Buddha claimed no place for Himself in His own Dhamma
>
>  1. Christ claimed to be the Prophet of Christianity.  
>  2. He further claimed that he was the Son of God.  
>  3. Christ also laid down the condition that there was no salvation
> for a person unless he accepted that Christ was the Son of God.  
>  4. Thus Christ secured a place for Himself by making the salvation
> of the Christian depend upon his acceptance of Christ as the Prophet
> and Son of God.  
>  5. Mohammad, the Prophet of Islam, claimed that he was a Prophet
> sent by God.  
>  6. He further claimed that no one could get salvation unless he
> accepted two other conditions.  
>  7. A seeker of salvation in Islam must accept that Mohammad is the
> Prophet of God.  
>  8. A seeker after salvation in Islam must further accept that he
> is the last prophet.  
>  9. Salvation in Islam is thus ensured only to those who accept
> these two conditions.  
>  10. Mohammad thus secured a place for Himself by making the
> salvation of the Muslim depend upon his acknowledgement of Mohammed as
> the Prophet of God.  
>  11. No such condition was ever made by the Buddha.  
>  12. He claimed that he was no more than the natural son of
> Suddhodana and Mahamaya.  
>  13. He carved for himself no place in his religion by laying down
> any such conditions regarding himself for salvation as Jesus and
> Mahommad did.  
>  14. That is the reason why we are left to know so little about
> himself even though abundant material was available.  
>  15. As is known, the first Buddhist congregation was held soon
> after the death of the Buddha at Rajagraha.  
>  16. Kassyappa presided over the congregation. Anand, Upali and
> many others who belonged to Kapilavatsu and who wandered with him
> wherever he went, and were with him till his death, were present.  
>  17. But what did Kassyappa the President do?  
>  18. He asked Anand to repeat the Dhamma and put the question to
> the congregation, "Is this right?" They answered in the affirmative.
> And Kassyappa then closed the question.  
>  19. Thereafter he asked Upali to repeat the Vinaya and put the
> question to the congregation, " Is this right ?" They answered in the
> affirmative. Kassyappa then closed the question.  
>  20. Kassyappa then should have put the third question to someone
> present in the congregation to record some important incidents in the
> life of the Buddha.  
>  21. But Kassyappa did not. These were the only two questions with
> which he thought the Sangh was concerned.  
>  22. If Kassyappa had collected the record of the Buddha's life we
> would have had today a full-fledged biography of the Buddha.  
>  23. Why did it not strike Kassyappa to collect the record about
> the Buddha's life?  
>  24. It could not be indifference. The only answer one can give is
> that the Buddha had carved no niche for himself in his religion.  
>  25. The Buddha and his religion were quite apart.  
>  26. Another illustration of the Buddha keeping himself out of his
> religion is to be found in his refusal to appoint a successor.  
>  27. Twice or thrice the Buddha was requested by his followers to
> appoint a successor.  
>  28. Every time the Buddha refused.  
>  29. His answer was, "The Dhamma must be its own successor.  
>  30. "Principle must live by itself, and not by the authority of
> man.  
>  31. "If principle needs the authority of man, it is no
> principle.  
>  32. "If every time it becomes necessary to invoke the name of the
> founder to enforce the authority of Dhamma, then it is no Dhamma."  
>  33. Such was the view he took of his own position regarding his
> Dhamma.
>
>   
> § 2. The Buddha did not promise to give Salvation. He said He was
> Marga Data (Way Finder) and not Moksha Data (Giver of Salvation)
>
>  1. Most religions are described as revelations. But the Buddha's
> religion is not a revelation.  
>  2. A revealed religion is so called because it is a message of God
> to His creatures to worship their maker (i.e., God) and to save their
> souls.  
>  3. Often the message is sent through a chosen individual who is
> called a prophet, to whom the message is revealed and who reveals it
> to the people. It is then called Religion.  
>  4. The obligation of the prophet is to ensure salvation to the
> faithful.  
>  5. Salvation of the faithful means the saving of their souls from
> being sent to hell, provided they obey God's commands and recognise
> the prophet as his messenger.  
>  6. The Buddha never claimed that he was a prophet or a messenger
> of God. He repudiated any such description.  
>  7. A more important point than this is that his religion is a
> discovery. As such, it must be sharply distinguished from a religion
> which is called Revelation.  
>  8. His religion is a discovery in the sense that it is the result
> of inquiry and investigation into the conditions of human life on
> earth; and understanding of the working of human instincts with which
> man is born; the moulding of his instincts and dispositions which man
> has formed as a result of history and tradition, and which are working
> to his detriment.  
>  9. All prophets have promised salvation. The Buddha is the one
> teacher who did not make any such promise. He made a sharp distinction
> between a *moksha data* and a *marga data*, one who gives salvation
> and one who only shows the way.  
>  10. He was only a *marga data*. Salvation must be sought by each
> for himself by his own effort.  
>  11. He made this very clear to the Brahmin Moggallana in the
> following Sutta.  
>  12. "Once the Exalted One was staying at Shravasti, in the East
> Park, at the \[multi-\]storeyed house of Migara's mother.  
>  13. "Then the Brahmin Moggallana, the accountant, came to the
> Exalted One and gave him friendly greeting, and after the exchange of
> courtesies sat down at one side. So seated, the Brahmin Moggallana,
> the accountant, said this to the Exalted One:  
>  14. "'Just as, Master Gautama, one gets a gradual view of this
> \[multi-\]storeyed house, a progress, a graduated path, and so on
> right up to the last step of the stairs, just so is the progressive
> training of us Brahmins: that is to say, in our course of study in the
> Vedas.'  
>  15. "'Just as in a course of archery, Gautama, with us the
> Brahmins, the training, the progress, the approach is step by step;
> for instance, in counting.'  
>  16. "'When we take a private pupil we make him count thus: 'One
> one, twice two, thrice three, four times four, and so on up to a
> hundred.' Now is it possible. Master Gautama, for you to point to a
> similar progressive training on the part of your followers in your
> Dhamma?'  
>  17. "'It is so, Brahmin. Take the case, Brahmin, of a clever
> horse-trainer. He takes a thoroughbred in hand, gives him his first
> lesson with bit and bridle, and then proceeds to the further
> course.'  
>  18. "'Just so, Brahmin, the Tathagata takes in hand a man who is
> to be trained and gives him his first lesson, thus: 'Come thou,
> brother! Be virtuous. Abide, constrained by the restraint of the
> obligation.'  
>  19. 'Become versed in the practice of right behaviour; seeing
> danger in trifling faults, do you undertake the training and be a
> pupil in the moralities.'  
>  20. "'As soon as he has mastered all that, the Tathagata gives him
> his second lesson, thus: 'Come thou brother! Seeing an object with the
> eye, be not charmed by its general appearance or its details.'  
>  21. "'Persist in the restraint of that dejection that comes from
> craving, caused by the sense of sight uncontrolled--these ill states,
> which would overwhelm one like a flood. Guard the sense of sight, win
> control over the sense of sight.'  
>  22. "'And so do with the other organs of sense. When you hear a
> sound with the ear, or smell a scent with the nose, taste a taste with
> the tongue, or with body touch things tangible, and when with mind you
> are conscious of a thing, be not charmed with its general appearance
> or its details.'  
>  23. "'As soon as he has mastered all that, the Tathagata gives him
> a further lesson, thus: 'Come thou, brother! Be moderate in eating;
> earnest and heedful do you take your food, not for sport not for
> indulgence, not for adding personal charm or comeliness to body, but
> do it for body's stabilising, for its support, for protection from
> harm, and for keeping up the practice of the righteous life, with this
> thought: 'I check my former feeling. To no new feeling will I give
> rise, that maintenance and comfort may be mine.'  
>  24. "'Then, Brahmin, when he has won restraint in food, the
> Tathagata gives him a further lesson thus: 'Come thou, brother! Abide
> given to watchfulness. By day, when walking or sitting, cleanse your
> heart from things that may hinder you. By night spend the first watch
> walking up and down or sitting, and do likewise. By night in the
> second watch, lie down on the right side in the posture of a lion, and
> placing one foot upon the other, mindful and self-possessed, set your
> thoughts on the idea of exertion. Then in the third watch of the night
> rise up, and walking up and down, or sitting, cleanse the heart of
> things that may hinder.'  
>  25. "'Then, Brahmin, when the brother is devoted to watchfulness,
> the Tathagata gives him a further lesson, thus: 'Come thou, brother!
> Be possessed of mindfulness and self-control. In going forth or going
> back, have yourself under control. In looking forward or looking back,
> in bending or relaxing, in wearing robes or carrying robe and bowl, in
> eating, chewing, tasting, in easing yourself, in going, standing,
> sitting, lying, sleeping or waking, in speaking or keeping silence
> have yourself under control.'  
>  26. "'Then Brahmin, when he is possessed of self-control, the
> Tathagata gives him a further lesson thus: 'Come thou, brother! Seek
> out a secluded lodging, a forest or root of a tree, a mountain or a
> cave or a mountain grotto, a charnel field, a forest retreat, the open
> air, a heap of straw.' And he does so. And when he has eaten his food
> he sits down crosslegged, and keeping his body straight up, he
> proceeds to practise the four ecstacies.'  
>  27. "'Now, Brahmin, for all brothers who are pupils, who have not
> yet attained mastery of mind, who abide aspiring, for such is the
> manner of my training.'  
>  28. "'But as to those brethren who are arhants, who have destroyed
> the asavas, who have lived the life, done their task, laid down the
> burden, won their own salvation, utterly destroyed the fetters of
> becoming, and are released by the perfect insight, for such as those
> these things are conducive to ease in the present life and to mindful
> self-control as well.'  
>  29. "When this was said, the Brahmin Moggallana, the accountant,
> said to the Exalted One :  
>  30. "'But tell me, Master Gautama. Do the disciples of the worthy
> Gautama,--do all of them win the absolute perfection which is Nibbana,
> or do some fail thus to attain?'  
>  31. "Some of my disciples, Brahmin, thus advised and trained by
> me, do so attain. Others do not."  
>  32. "But what is the reason, Master Gautama? What is the cause,
> Master Gautama? Here we have Nibbana. Here we have the Path to
> Nibbana. Here we have the worthy Gautama as instructor. What is the
> reason, I say, why some disciples thus advised and trained do attain,
> while others do not attain?"  
>  33. "That, Brahmin, is a question that I will answer. But first do
> you answer me this, so far as you think fit. Now how say you.
> Brahmin--Are you well skilled in the road to Rajagraha?"  
>  34. "I am, master, Skilled indeed am I in the road to
> Rajagraha!'  
>  35. "Well, thus instructed, thus advised, he takes the wrong road,
> and off he goes with his face set to the west.  
>  36. "Then a second man comes up with the same request, and you
> give him the same instructions. He follows your advice and comes safe
> to Rajagraha.  
>  37. "'That is my business?'  
>  38. "'What do I in the matter. Brahmin? The Tathagata is one who
> only shows the way.'  
>  39. Here is a full statement that he does not promise salvation.
> He only shows the way.  
>  40. Besides, what is salvation?  
>  41. With Mohammad and Jesus, salvation means saving the soul from
> being sent to hell, by the intercession of the Prophet.  
>  42. With Buddha, salvation means Nibbana, and Nibbana means
> control of passions.  
>  43. What promise of salvation can there be in such a Dhamma?
>
>   
> § 3. The Buddha did not Claim any Divinity for himself or for his
> Dhamma. It was discovered by man for man. It was not a Revelation
>
>  1. Every founder of religion has either claimed divinity for
> himself or for his teachings.  
>  2. Moses, although he did not claim for himself any divine origin,
> did claim divine origin for his teachings. He told his followers that
> if they wished to reach the land of milk and honey they must accept
> the teachings, because they were the teachings of Jehovah the God.  
>  3. Jesus claimed divinity for himself. He claimed that he was the
> Son of God. Naturally His teachings acquired a divine origin.  
>  4. Krishna said that he was God himself, and the **Gita** was his
> own word.  
>  5. The Buddha made no such claim, either for himself or his
> Sasana.  
>  6. He claimed that he was one of the many human beings and his
> message to the people was the message of man to man.  
>  7. He never claimed infallibility for his message.  
>  8. The only claim he made was that his message was the only true
> way to salvation as he understood it.  
>  9. It was based on universal human experience of life in the
> world.  
>  10. He said that it was open to anyone to question it, test it,
> and find what truth it contained.  
>  11. No founder has so fully thrown open his religion to such a
> challenge.
