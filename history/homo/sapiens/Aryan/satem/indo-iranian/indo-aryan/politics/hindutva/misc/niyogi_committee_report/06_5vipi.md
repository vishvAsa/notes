**REPORT OF THE CHRISTIAN MISSIONARY ACTIVITIES ENQUIRY COMMITTEE,
MADHYA PRADESH**

**------------------------------**

**VOLUME I**

PART I

**CHAPRER I. - INTRODUCTION**

The Christian Missionary Activities Enquiry Committee was appointed by a
Resolution of the Government of Madhya Pradesh No. 318-716-V-Con., dated
the 14th of April, 1954 (Appendix I).

2\. It was represented to Government from time to time that the
conversion of illiterate aboriginals and other backward people was
effected by the Christian Missionaries either forcibly or through fraud
or temptations of monetary gain, and the Government were informed that
the feelings of non-Christians were being offended by conversions
brought about by such methods.  The Christian Missionaries repudiated
before Government these allegations and charged local officials and
non-Christians of harassment and as the State Government found that an
agitation was growing on either side, it considered it desirable in. the
public interest to have a thorough enquiry made into the whole
question.  This Committee was, therefore, appointed, with Dr. M. Bhawani
Shankar Niyogi, M.A., LL.M., LL.D., Ex-Chairman, Public, Service
Commission, Madhya Pradesh, and retired Chief Justice, High Court of
judicature at Nagpur, as Chairman, and Shri Ghanshyam Singh Gupta,
B.Sc., LL.B., Ex-Speaker, Madhya Pradesh Legislative Assembly, Durg,
Shri Seth Govind Das, M. P., Jabalpur, Shri Kirtimant Rao, B.A. M.L.A.,
Ahiri, Tahsil Sironcha, District Chanda, Shri S. K. George, M.A., B.D.,
Professor, Commerce College, Wardha, and Shri B. P. Pathak, M.A., LL.B.,
Secretary to Government, Madhya Pradesh, Public Health Department, as
members.  Seth Govind Das resigned membership on 8th May, 1954 due to
his preoccupation with other work and was substituted by Shri Ratanlal
Malviya, B.A., LL.B., M. P., Manendragarh, (vide Resolution No.
419-860-V-Con., dated 8th May, 1954).  On his appointment to the Madhya
Pradesh Cabinet, Shri Kirtimant Rao also resigned and was succeeded by
Shri Bhanupratapsingh Giri Raj Singh Deo, M.P., of Komakhan, Tahsil
Mahasamund, District Raipur, (vide Resolution No. 18-279-XXX-MR, dated
4th January, 1955).

3\. The Committee was entrusted with the task of making a thorough
enquiry into the whole question and to make recommendations on a review
thereof from historical and other points of view.

4\. The Committee was authorised to frame its own procedure for
conducting the enquiry and to appreciate the circumstances in which the
Government considered it necessary to appoint this Committee, access to
certain files of Government was permitted. On going through all the
relevant material, the Committee thought it necessary and desirable to
meet representative members of the contestant parties at various
important centres in the State and to ascertain the specific points in
the controversy.  The Committee undertook a tour of the following 14
districts :-  
   
 

|                 |                    |
|-----------------|--------------------|
| \(1\) Raigarh.  | \(8\) Akola.       |
| \(2\) Surguja.  | \(9\) Buldana.     |
| \(3\) Raipur.   | \(10\) Mandla.     |
| \(4\) Bilaspur. | \(11\) Jabalpur.   |
| \(5\) Amravati. | \(12\) Betul.      |
| \(6\) Nimar.    | \(13\) Chhindwara. |
| \(7\) Yeotmal.  | \(14\) Balaghat.   |

Seventy-seven centres were visited and an approximate number of 11,360
people were contacted. 375 written statements were received and the
Committee took down notes at each centre.  To gain firsthand knowledge
of the working of the various Mission institutions, the Committee
visited institutions like hospitals, schools, churches, leper homes,
hostels, etc., maintained by the various Missions operating in Madhya
Pradesh and also had an opportunity of contacting local people amongst
whom activities of the Missions were carried on and also the areas in
which the various Missions were functioning.  A copy of the tour
programme is appended (Vol. II).  The persons whom we interviewed came
from about 700 villages and the statements of a large number of
spokesmen from amongst them were recorded.

5\. On the vital matter of religion, which is ordinarily surcharged with
emotion, occasionally there was a flare-up of vehemence but such
occasions were extremely rare, as ample precaution was taken at the
outset of the proceedings to explain the object of the enquiry as being
to clear up doubts and disputes that may exist and to promote goodwill,
friendliness and peace among the various sections of the people.  The
exploratory work of the Committee accordingly proceeded very smoothly
and helpfully, except for two minor incidents, at Takhatpur in Bilaspur
district and Jabalpur.  At Takhatpur Shri Ottalwar, Advocate, who was
the only spokesman addressing the Committee on behalf of a large
concourse of rural people, made some critical remarks of a political
nature on the admission made by Rev. Maqbul Musih that he had received
Rs. 38,000 from America for the Abundant Life Movement carried on by him
in the rural areas with a view to stave off the danger of Communism.  No
protest was made by Rev. Masih, but only by the representative of the
Catholic Association, Mr. Francis. At Jabalpur, an Arya Samajist
referred to some passages in the Bible which he thought inculcated
immorality, while he was speaking about religious education.  As the
Christians present resented the reference the Committee asked the
speaker to drop it and he obeyed.

6\. In all the places visited by the Committee there was unanimity as
regards the excellent service rendered by the Missionaries, in the
fields of education and medical relief.  But on the other hand there was
a general complaint from the non-Christian side that the schools and
hospitals were being used as means of securing converts. There was no
disparagement of Christianity or of Jesus Christ, and no objection to
the preaching of Christianity and even to conversions to Christianity.
The objection was to the illegitimate methods alleged to be adopted by
the Missionaries for this purpose, such as offering allurement’s of free
education and other facilities to children attending their schools,
adding some Christian names to their original Indian names, marriages
with Christian girls, money-lending, Distributing Christian literature
in hospitals and offering prayers in the wages of in-door patients. 
Reference was also made to the practice of the Roman Catholic priests or
preachers visiting new-born babies to give ‘ashish’ (blessings) in the
name of Jesus, taking sides in litigation or domestic quarrels,
kidnapping of minor children and abduction of women and recruitment of
labour for plantations in Assam or Andaman as a means of propagating the
Christian faith among the ignorant and illiterate people.  There was a.
general tendency to suspect some ulterior political or extra-religious
motive, in the influx of foreign money for evangelistic work in its
varied forms.  The concentration of Missionary enterprise on the hill
tribes in remote and inaccessible parts of the forest areas and their
mass conversion with the aid of foreign money were interpreted as
intended to prepare the ground for a separate’ independent State on the
lines of Pakistan.  In the Raigarh and Surguja districts, the Christians
complained against the petty Government officials, but there were
practically none in other districts including Berar.  At the meetings
held in Surguja, Raigarh and Bilaspur districts there were present
prominent Christian representatives, like Rev. Lakra of Ranchi, Rev.
Kujur (Lutheran Mission), Rev. Gurbachansingh (American Evengelical
Mission), Rev. Masih (Disciples of Christ), Shri Minz (General Secretary
the Catholic Sabha).  Shri Minz complained against the sinister
activities of Boko Sardar, of Shri Deshpande.  Advocate, of Baijnath
Mishra and of the Tribal Welfare Department.  Shri Jagdish Tirkey,
Secretary of the Adiwasi Jharkhand Party, claimed that Jharkhand was
necessary to preserve the unity of the Uraons. He and Rev. Kujur
repudiated the imputation against the Missionaries that they instigated
the movement for an independent State. There was no specific complaints
against officials or non-Christians besides the above. But there was a
general complaint above the non-recognition of Mission schools. Rev.
Nath of Khandwa complimented the Missionaries for elevating the Ballahis
from their down-trodden condition in the Hindu society.  In the Betul
district meeting, Rev. E. Raman and many American Missionaries had no
complaints to make against the Government officers or members of the
public.

7\. On the basis of the allegations made orally and in writing a large
number of people including Christians, supplemented by information
derived from official sources and published literature bearing on the
subject-matter of the enquiry it was thought necessary to make a
thorough and searching probe into the problem. Accordingly, an elaborate
questionnaire came to be issued so as to afford full opportunity to the
parties concerned to assist the Committee in every way possible.

8\. It may be noted that the Committee was not appointed under any
enactment such as the Commission of Enquiry Act IX of 1952 but only
under the inherent powers of the grate Government.  The Committee
consequently functioned on a purely voluntary basis.  It had neither the
power to compel any one to attend before it, nor to make any statement,
oral or written, nor to administer an oath.  The Committee thus had no
coercive power in any shape or form.  No one was bound to answer all or
any question contained in the Questionnaire or to answer it in a
prescribed manner.  The enquiry was riot judicial, in the sense that it
was calculated to have an operative effect.  As the Committee
interpreted the Terms of Reference, it appeared to it that the object of
the enquiry was to ascertain the facts from the people directly at
first-hand, unlike a judicial enquiry which proceeds on the material
brought before it by an investigating authority.  The attitude of the
Government, as well as that of the party in power, was perfectly
neutral.

9\. The scope of the enquiry was considerably enlarged by reason of the
broad Terms of Reference relating to “Political and extra-religious
objectives.” and “a thorough review of the question from the historical
and other points of view”. At first sight the subject of the enquiry
presented itself as a purely local one but that turned out to be more
apparent than real. The material gathered in the initial stages of the
enquiry revealed to the Committee that its significance far transcended
the bounds of any one country or region in the world and that it was
calculated to have world- wide repercussions. That compelled the
Committee to view the subject as an integral part of a larger picture on
the broad canvas of world history. The Committee had to consult a number
of published books, pamphlets and periodicals for deter- mining the
nature and form of their recommendations.

10\. On the true construction of the Terms of Reference the Committee
found that the subject in hand should be divided under specified beads,
viz., Conversions, Social Relations. Hospitals and Schools with a
separate head for Remedies.  The questions set out under each of these
heads are indeed exploratory and searching, but in no way unconnected
with the issues involved in the enquiry.

11\. The response to the Questionnaire was encouraging, indicating as it
did, the co-operation of the public as well as of the Protestant
Missionary Bodies operating in the various districts of the State. 385
replies to the questionnaire were received in the office of the
Committee out of which 55 were from Christian individuals or
organisations and 330 from non-Christians.  The authorities and members
of the Roman Catholic Church co-operated with the Committee in their
exploratory tours in Raigarh, Surguja, Bilaspur, Raipur and Nimar
districts. Shri G. X. Francis, President of the Catholic Regional
Council, and Shri P. Lobo, Advocate, High Court, Nagpur, associated
themselves with the Committee.  But subsequently the Catholic Church
withdrew its co-operation, not only ling a statement of protest, but
also moving the High Court for a Mandamus Petition (Miscellaneous
Petition No. 263.of 1955).

Their Lordships dismissed the petition on 12th April, 1956, holding that
it was within the competence of the State Government to appoint a
fact-finding Committee to collect information and that there had been
no-infringement of any of the fundamental rights of the petitioner.  The
Committee have gone through the Lengthy judgment of the Hon’ble High
Court very carefully and have given respectful consideration to the
views expressed therein.  We may however like to state that some of the
remarks concerning a few questions in our Questionnaire proceed from an
apparent lack of full knowledge of the nature of the allegations made
before us which formed the basis of those questions.  We had repeatedly
informed the petitioner and the public that none of the questions
represented either the views of the Committee or any individual member
thereof and our anxiety to have information on various points was due to
our desire to find out to what extent, if any, could any activity be
considered to infringe the limits of public order, morality aria health
imposed by the Constitution.  As will be clear from the body of this
report, we have confined ourselves entirely to the spirit and letter of
our Constitution.  
 

**CHAPTER II. - CIRCUMSTANCES LEADING TO THE APPOINTMENT OF THE
COMMITTEE**

In another part we pro se to give the history of Christian Missions in
old Madhya Pradesh and also in the Merged States.  In this Chapter it is
intended to detail the circumstances which led the Government to appoint
this Fact-finding Committee.  Our source of information has been the
various files made available to us by Government.  As the immediate
cause which ultimately led to our appointment was the activities of some
Mission organizations in the recently Merged States of Raigarh, Udaipur,
Jashpur and Surguja, it will be useful to describe the principal or toot
causes of whatever trouble was reported in the integrated States soon
after their merger on 1st January, 1948.  Even in the old Madhya Pradesh
the Government, was not unfamiliar with the problem of Missionary
activities amongst aboriginals, because many of our districts contained
a large number of Adiwasi population and Government had been carrying
out, welfare measures for them for a good length of time.  It is
reported that about 18 per cent of the total population of Madhya
Pradesh prior to Integration consisted of aboriginals and that the
Integration of the States added nearly 28 lakhs to the population of
Madhya Pradesh, out of whom about 53 per cent were aboriginals. 
According to official reports the integration of Chhattisgarh States was
carried out smoothly and was hailed with joy by all sections of the
community including the aboriginals.  When the then Premier toured the
Integrated States, attempts were made by Christian and other Uraons of
Jashpur State to create-some trouble, but it never presented a
formidable problem.

2\. The chief cause of unrest could be located against the following
background :-

\(a\) Oppression and misgovernment which existed prior to Integration:
In other parts of this Report a detailed reference to the various forms
of oppression practised on the Adiwasis by the Malguzars, the Zamindars
and the ex-Rulers will be found.

\(b\) The expectations of the people of the Integrated States of
immediate improvement in their moral and material conditions as a result
of Integration were pitched so high that almost inevitably they were
bound to be disappointed to some extent.  Improvement of conditions in a
specially backward area has necessarily to be a gradual process, which
was not recognized.

\(c\) Almost from the very beginning interested parties, including
Christian Missionaries, began to intermeddle and create dissatisfaction
by exploiting the situation.  These interested parties were firstly the
Rajas and their supporters and hirelings and also politicians of the
neighbouring States, who wished to secure integration of some of the
former States in their area despite history, geography and economy.  An
end was put to the activities of such persons by the decision of the
Union Ministry of States in May 1948, but according to Government
reports the activities of Missionaries continued further though
surreptitiously.

\(d\) The reports which the Government of Madhya Pradesh had obtained
from the former States in respect of the activities of Missionaries show
that their role in the past had not been healthy, their methods not
savoury.  Two or three times there were rebellions in the States and
even the Political Department, which was in the hands of the European
Christians, was compelled to put restrictions on the entry of
Missionaries and their movement in the former States.  Details of the
Acts passed by the former States of Surguja, Udaipur and Raigarh
regulating conversion and restricting the movement, etc., of
Missionaries will be found elsewhere in this Report. On the integration
of the States, Missionaries became afraid of losing their influence. So
they started an agitation, playing on the religious feelings of the
primitive Christian converts, representing the Madhya Pradesh Government
as consisting of infidels and so on. Some of the articles published in
Missionary papers, such as ‘Nishkalank’ ‘Adiwasi’ and ‘Jharkhand’ were
hardly distinguishable from the writings in Muslim papers advocating
Pakistan, before, before the 15th of August 1947.  The Missionaries
launched a special attack on the opening of schools by Madhya Pradesh
Government under the Backward Area Welfare Scheme.  The then
Commissioner of Chhattisgarh Division, contacted the Father Superior of
the Roman Catholics at Jashpurnagar in February 1948 and explained to
him the secular nature the Indian Union and the freedom of religion and
worship which every citizen enjoyed in it.  He pointed out that there
was no hindrance to Missionaries carrying on their religious activity in
a lawful manner, but if the leaders of the Missions mixed up religion
with politics and appealed to the religions fanaticism of the easily
gullible Adiwasis they could not naturally claim the sanctity and
consideration which attaches to religious organisations.  He further
explained that having once suffered grievously from the communalistic
policies of some persons, India could not afford to have another such
movement in its very heart.  The Catholic Father Superior gave the
Commissioner an undertaking that the Mission would confine itself only
to religion and not dabble in politics at all.  The following letter
written by Father Vermiere of the Jashpur Roman Catholic Mission may be
quoted in extenso, to show the attitude of the Missionaries including
foreigners, at the time of the Integration of the States :-

> “We need help very much as we are so deep in debt and have to face
> worse times with a new Government so much against the Christians.
>
> “Rev. Father Rector has probably acquainted you with what I wrote some
> time ago.  Things have riot much improved, although aye are rather on
> good terms with the local authorities.  Even so it is no more is
> before.  As more than one of the new or old officials points out, the
> men sent this side are too inferior, and cannot compare with, for
> instance, the late Dean.  Next those employed do riot seem to have
> half the powers necessary.  Things have continually to be referred
> higher tip, (which means most of the time no answer to the letters)
> and petitions, are delayed for five or six months.  What I say is the

> the Province, that this is the way.
>
> “We should, e.g., settle about the transition from Patna syllabus to

> conducted.  Hindu propaganda with open attempts to draw the Christians
> into the Hindu fold, occupied a large part of the programme.  In the
> end the Christians refused to go, on account of that propaganda and
> the Education came to an end.  Meanwhile the Inspectors have no time
> for any other work than that.
>
> “The Bishop wishes me to discuss with them the question of our
> attempted High School at Ginabahar, but cannot do this with such
> fellows who come as makeshifts, till they can get away.
>
> “You may have read lately in the Herald some-very spirited answers

> slander by one who came with a large retinue to spy our Institutions
> at Gholeng and Ginabahar.  He dares call himself a member of the much
> esteemed Servants of India Society.  He and his colleague have nearly
> wrecked the nascent Mission of the Norbertine Fathers in Mandla,
> District Jubbulpore. They were sent here by the Prime Minister, but if
> they hope to ruin this Mission, they are very much mistaken.  Our
> Catholics are too advanced to he taken in. or frightened by such
> slanderers.  Protest meetings against their vile report continue to be
> held, chiefly to wreck their treacherous machinations.  As one of the
> two, is a sort of Minister for the uplift of the backward people, he
> has a considerable Government budget to dispose of.  Their aim is more
> to prevent us front converting, than to care for the uplift of those
> they used to keep them in bondage.  Just now they are starting 40 new
> schools for these backward Adibasis.  The third I hear of, is in a
> village where we possess a school since 30 years.  But knowing that
> many pagan children come to our schools and that we had sent a
> petition for a building to enlarge that school, they surreptitiously
> try and draw aw the pagan children from us.  But we are ready for

> tip a protest, and get all the pagans to refuse withdrawing their
> children from us. I am giving you all this for the sake of those in
> the community interested in Jashpur affairs.”

In a subsequent visit to the then Premier at Nagpur, Father Vermiere was
confronted with this letter and lie then gave an undertaking in writing
that he would have no objection to schools being established by
Government in the States.

3\. Let us turn our attention to the activities of the Missionaries in
the Merged States of Surguja and Udaipur during the months following
their Integration.  It has already been mentioned that the former Rulers
of these States had consistently stopped the infiltration of
Missionaries in their territories and with the full knowledge and
consent of the then Political Department Anti conversion Acts were
passed.  In spite of these Acts individual Missionaries, specially Rev.
Stanislus Tigga, a Roman Catholic Priest with his headquarters in
Ranchi, kept on visiting these areas surreptitiously and carried on
propaganda in the garb of religion.  The strip of land comprising
Surguja, Korea, Jashpur, Udaipur, Changbhakar and some other small. 
States of Orissa is surrounded by Bihar and Orissa States and is
inhabited by a very large percentage of aboriginals.  The tract is full
of forests and mineral resources.  Foreign Missionaries from Belgium and
Germany had established themselves in Bihar and Orissa and also in
Jashpur in 1834 and had succeeded in converting a very large number of
people to Christianity.  In order to consolidate and enhance their
prestige, and possibly to afford scope for alien interests in this
tract, the Missionaries were reported to be carrying on propaganda for
the isolation of the Aboriginals from other sections of the community
and the movement of Jharkhand was thus started.  This movement was
approved by the Aboriginals, local Christians and Muslims and the
Missionaries sought to keep it under their influence by excluding all
the nationalists elements from this movement.  The demand for
Adiwasisthan was accentuated along with the one for Pakistan in 1938. 
The Muslim League is reported to have donated Rs. one lakh for
propaganda work.  With the advent of political independence in India,
the agitation for Adiwasisthan was intensified, with a view to forming a
sort of corridor joining East Bengal with Hyderabad, which could be used
for a pincer movement against India in the event of a war between India
and Pakistan.  The Christian community, supported by the Missionaries of
the Ranchi district, organised themselves into a “Raiyat Warg”,
ostensibly to do social work, but in reality to propagate the Adiwasi
movement.  To counteract the isolationist doctrine of this organization
of Christians, the non-Christians formed a Praja Mandal.  Although there
was a tussle between these two organizations which continued till the
integration of the States with Madhya Pradesh, they joined bands on
learning that Surguja and Jashpur States were being merged with Madhya
Pradesh and started a pro-Bihar agitation.  At the prospect of the
integration of the States with Madhya Pradesh Mr. Jaipal Singh, member
of the Constituent Assembly and President of the All-India Adiwasi
Association, who is also commonly described as the father of the
Jharkhand movement, protested in November 1947 against the merger of
Surguja and Jashpur with Madhya Pradesh and accused the Bihar Government
with failure to serve the people by not insisting on the integration of
those States with Bihar.  After having seen the then Premier of Bihar at
Ranchi, Shri Jaipal Singh convened a conference of All-India Adiwasi
Maha Sabha, on 14th January of 1948.  This pro-Bihar agitation, which
was originally started at the instance of the Roman Catholic and
Lutheran Missionaries of Ranchi in Bihar district, soon obtained the
support of other Christians, non-Christians, aboriginals and members of
the Bihar Congress party and it was also reported that the then Hon’ble
Premier of Bihar and the Hon’ble Revenue Minister had sympathy with this
cause.  Accordingly a party consisting of some Bihar Congressmen, Rev.
Lakra, the head of the Lutheran Mission and a Jamidar visited Surguja in
the second week of January 1948 to mobilise public opinion in favour of
the integration of those States with Bihar. Two members of this party,
however, informed the District Superintendent of Police, Surguja, that
they were not fully agreeable to the views of the remaining members and
further brought to the District Superintendent of Police’s notice that
there was a conspiracy between Pakistan and some American and German
Missionaries to instigate the aboriginals to take possession of their
own land, commonly known as Jharkhand.  In Kharsaon and Sarikela States
of Orissa there was violence necessitating the use of force to suppress
it.  At the All-India Adiwasis’ conference on 14th January, of 1948,
called by Mr. Jaipal Singh, speeches after speeches were made narrating
the disadvantages and worries associated with the merger of the States
with Madhya Pradesh and the benefits accruing from their amalgamation
with Bihar.  Two Christians and a non-Christian were appointed
propagandists to carry on pro-Bihar agitation.  The Praja Mandal which
consisted mostly of non-Christians and which was lacking in funds
refused to support the pro-Bihar propaganda and in a meeting held at
Bargaon (Jashpur) on 20th January, 1948 it was unanimously resolved to
agree to the integration of Surguja and Jashpur with Madhya Pradesh.

4\. The activities of the Missionaries in the Jashpur area from January
1948 to the, end of May when the Union Ministry of States decided
finally the question of merger of Surguja and Jashpur with Madhya
Pradesh may be narrated.  According to official reports these
activities, though ostensibly carried on by Indian Christians, were in
fact sponsored by Missionaries to secure a-strong foothold in the
hitherto forbidden territories of Udaipur and Surguja.

**January 1948**.-The agitation for the inclusion of Jashpur, Udaipur,
Surguja and Changbhakar States in the Bihar Province was continued and
prominent persons of Ranchi visited Jashpur. Rev. J. Lakra, the head of
German Lutheran Mission, carried on propaganda for a separate Jharkhand
Province, which would be administered by Christians, who predominated in
the area concerned.  Three meetings of Christians were held in the
Jashpur State for the purpose of carrying on this propaganda.

**February 1948**.- Three more meetings were held in Jashpur
sub-division in connection with the Christian agitation in favour of
amalgamation with Bihar.  Speakers pointed out that inclusion in the
Central Provinces would mean economic and social retardation and the
evaporation of their dream of Jharkhand.  At a meeting at Ichkelah
(Jashpur) on 13th February it was announced that an Adiwasi fund for
defending the interests of Adiwasis had been started. Rev. J. Lakra was
suspected of dissuading Christians from participating in Mahatma
Gandhi’s Ashes Immersion Ceremony observed at Jashpur on 12th February. 
Julias Tigga, Secretary Adiwasi Sabha, Ranchi, visited Jashpur and
Ambikapur about the 14th of February and was warned by the District
Magistrate, Surguja, for indulging in objectionable activities.  On 21st
February 1948, Bowfus Lakra, a parliamentary Secretary of Bihar and
Joseph Tigga, Pleader of Ranchi, addressed a small meeting at the
prominent Roman Catholic Mission Centre of Ginabahar in which, although
opposition to the formation of Jharkhand was voiced, it was stated that
people should be allowed to decide whether they should be associated
with Madhya Pradesh or Bihar.  These intense political activities of the
Christians under the leadership of foreign Missionaries created a sense
of apprehension and consequently the non-Christian organization called
the Praja Mandal mobilized their resources to counteract this movement. 
A few meetings were called and addressed by this party on or about the
23rd of February.  Rev. J. Lakra called a session of the All-India
Adiwasi Maha Sabha at Ranchi on the 26th of February and delegates from
Orissa, Chhattisgarh States and Bihar attended it. Mr. Jaipal Singh, who
was elected President of the Maha Sabha criticized the Bihar Government
for splitting the tribal people and emphasised that the salvation of the
Adiwasis lay in the creation of a separate province including the States
of Chhattisgarh.  He proposed to raise and send 1,000 volunteers for
propaganda purposes.

**March 1948**.-A meeting was organised by the Lutheran Christians at
Bargaon in Jashpur to further the propaganda of merger with Bihar. 
There was propaganda on the border villages of Surguja district by
Christian Missionaries of Palamau and Ranchi.

5\. It was during this time that the then Premier of Madhya Pradesh
undertook a tour of those areas and it was reported that a good deal of
misapprehension regarding Government’s policy, etc., was removed and
that open and extensive activities of the Missionaries through Indian
Christian Fathers and Preachers were subdued, and Police officials
reported that thenceforth the agitation was carried on in a
surreptitious, manners In October 1948 a Gaonthia of Surguja was
detained under the Public Safety Act for objectionable Activities and a
search of his house revealed him in possession of letters which showed
that he was an active worker of the Jharkhand movement, on behalf of the
Missionaries and that the agitation was still being carried on for the
creation of a separate Adiwasi Province.  The Gaonthia was ultimately
released on his giving a written undertaking that he would not take part
in any subversive activities.

6\. In the neighbouring State of Udaipur activities were mostly confined
to Rev. S. Tigga.  The laws which were in force in the former Merged
States were continued on integration and consequently the
Anti-conversion Act had also been continued.  The Anti-conversion Act of
Udaipur had been promulgated on 9th July 1946-nearly an year and a half
after the, Ruler of the State was installed in December 1944.  But to
put a check on the unfair activities of the Roman Catholic Priests the
then Political Agent had passed an order on 28th February 1941 \[D.O.
No. G-59-CR/37 (III)\] permitting the entry of Roman Catholic Priests
only on the following conditions:-

> \(1\) Priests could be allowed to enter the State when called to the
> bed-side of a dying or dangerously ill person.  The Priest concerned
> must in such cases personally give information of his visits at the
> Police Station nearest to the route by which he travelled.
>
> \(2\) Priests may be permitted to enter the State once every quarter
> to celebrate Mass at some village near the border.  Previous
> permission for this should be obtained from the Superintendent of the
> State on each occasion.  The Priests should not tour in the State but
> their parishioners should come to them at the place which was selected
> for the celebration of Mass.

7\. After Integration Rev. S. Tigga, a Roman Catholic Missionary
thwarted these restrictions add visited the State several times up to
the month of May 1948.  He was warned against doing so by the
Sub-Divisional Officer, but he did not pay any attention to it. 
Ultimately the Sub-Divisional Officer ordered his prosecution under
section 188, Indian Penal Code for disobeying those restrictions and
Rev. Tigga was sentenced to pay a fine of Rs. 20.  Although he was in
possession of the requisite amount he refused to pay the fine and had to
be imprisoned for four days in consequence to suffer imprisonment which
had been ordered in default of the payment of the fine.  This sudden
“invasion” of areas in Udaipur State by Roman Catholic Missionaries
created a sharp reaction in the mind of the local people and they
represented to the Government as well as the district authorities
against encouraging the Missionaries to establish their centres in the
Udaipur State and thereby to prevent mass conversions of Uraons. 
Government apprehended an imminent danger of breach of the peace and
disturbance of public tranquility and it also felt that Communist bodies
functioning in areas outside Madhya Pradesh on the immediate borders of
Surguja, Udaipur and Jashpur States might take advantage of the
situation and create trouble, similar to the one which was then raging
in the neighbouring States. Accordingly an order, under section 144,
Criminal Procedure Code was passed restricting the entry of Christian
Missionaries in the Udaipur Sub-Division except for purposes of
religious work.  The order was on the lines of the restrictions
mentioned in paragraph 6 above and remained in force for nearly a year
from 27th January 1949.  It is reported that about 20 to 25 persons were
arrested for defiance of this-order.  Throughout the year 1949 the Roman
Catholic Bishop of Ranchi and some Roman Catholic leaders of Nagpur made
repeated efforts to seek the permission of the State Government to
establish centres in the Udaipur Sub-Division.  The restrictions which
were imposed in the former State Regime were still in force and
Government had information with them to show that Christian Missionaries
in the Udaipur State were indulging in political activities of an
objectionable kind, really reminiscent of the two nation theory which
had awful consequences in the history of India.  Considering that such
dangerous activities could not be tolerated by any responsible
Government, they were not prepared to remove the restrictions,
altogether.  In view of the political bias with which Christian
Missionaries had carried on proselytism during the last half a century
in the merged territories and in view of their active support of the
dangerous Jharkhand movement.  Government considered it necessary to put
down the activities which led to fissiparous tendencies.  In a
conference held by the Hon’ble the Premier on 29th March, 1949 with
three Roman Catholic leaders (Major Bernard, M.L.A., Shri G. X. Francis
and Major A. F. W da Costa) the policy of the State Government was fully
and carefully explained and it was pointed out that India being a
secular State, there was perfect freedom of thought and religion, but
difficulties cropped up only when religious organisations mixed this up
with politics.  At this conference it was pointed out by the Government
spokesman that several non-Christians had represented to Government
about the activities of the Missionaries in the Integrated States, in
particular about religious instruction being imparted in their schools. 
This had become necessary because ever since the opening of schools by
the Tribal Welfare Department, Roman Catholic Missionaries had carried
on persistent propaganda against such schools and had represented this
to the State Government also.  Although Father Vermeire had intimated
that he had no objection to Government starting schools in Jashpur side
by side with the Mission schools, the Roman Catholic Bishop of Ranchi
kept on representing that this should not be done.  It was, therefore,
pointed out at the conference that the duty of Government being to
provide non-sectarian educational instruction for the people, no
legitimate objection could be taken against it.  On the question of
restrictions imposed on the entry of-Christian Priests in Udaipur State,
the official point of view was pointed out and it was explained how the
situation had developed on account of the mingling of religion with
politics.  The leaders present were told that the policy of Government
towards matters of religion was one of allowing complete freedom of
conscience and worship to all and there was not the slightest intention
to have a different policy in Udaipur or other States.  The gentlemen
present were requested to remove any misconception from the minds of the
people and to tell them that Government would not interfere in their
peaceful religious pursuit so long as they did not mix up politics with
religion.  Major da Costa on behalf of the Catholics assured Government
of the loyalty of Catholics and informed that Catholics had no
connection whatsoever with the Jharkhand movement.  The three leaders
present assured the Premier of their unflinching loyalty to Government
and of their determination to co-operate and help Government in every
possible manner and they requested that the question of allowing
reliable Christian Priests to reside in Udaipur might be favourably
considered by Government after making due enquiries about their
bonafides and Government promised to examine the suggestion.  Shri
Francis informed the Premier that he would take an early opportunity of
visiting Udaipur and Jashpur to tell the people of the policy of
Government and to remove all misconceptions.  In accordance with this
promise Shri Francis undertook a tour of the newly integrated States of
Udaipur and Jashpur between 20th and 25th April, 1949.  It appears that
the representations made by Shri Francis and other Roman Catholic
leaders of Nagpur to the Government of Madhya Pradesh were at the
instance of the Roman Catholic Mission working in the Jashpur area. 
After the conference of these leaders with the Premier on 29th March,
1949 details were apparently reported to the then Roman Catholic Bishop
of Ranchi, who on 18th April, 1949 came to Nagpur and gave a written
pledge on his behalf as well as on behalf of his Priests, undertaking to
give all due obedience and respect to the lawfully constituted
Government of India, and the lawfully constituted Government of Madhya
Pradesh and also stated that while carefully abstaining from
participating in political affairs it was his desire and purpose that
his influence in so far as may be possible in such matters shall be so
exerted in loyal co-operation-with Government.  In view of this
undertaking Rt. Rev. O’Sevrin, Bishop of Ranchi, requested Government to
allow without further delay his Priests to reside in Udaipur without
whose presence the Catholics were effectively prevented from practising
their religion in a normal way. As regards the apprehension that the
Priests might meddle in politics the Bishop assured the Government that
as far as his Priests were concerned they would not do so and that they
had not done so in the past.  He stated that although soon after
Integration he was approached more than once by Bihar Congressmen and
other supporters of the Jharkhand movement to lend his support to the
movement towards amalgamation with Bihar he had refused to co-operate. 
On account of this he had incurred the hostility, not only of the
Lutherans in Jashpur, but of Catholics in Ranchi.  In this letter the
Bishop stated, “If we, Catholic Priests, had chosen to urge them on in
the direction of joining the Jharkhand movement the situation in Jashpur
and Udaipur would have been much worse than it is now, considering at
very close to one-fourth of the population of Jashpur is Catholic”. This
is a significant admission of the control exercised by Roman Catholic
Priests in matters outside religion and of the existence of a state of
political agitation in the newly merged States of Jashpur, Udaipur and
Surguja, soon after Integration.  Along with his request to allow
Catholic Priests to reside in Udaipur State, the Bishop levelled charges
against petty local officials and also non-officials.  It was also
stated that patent discrimination which was officially adopted by the
Central Provinces Government against Christian aboriginals in denying
them scholarships and other concessions was much resented by the
Catholics.  The following are some of the reported grievances of
Catholics in Jashpur voiced by the Bishop of Ranchi:-

> \(1\) There have been several cases of Catholic candidates for
> Government posts being asked as a condition for employment to give
> Christianity and become Hindus.  Although the letter admitted that
> this allegation was made on what is “being whispered about”, the
> Government was asked to remedy the situation.
>
> \(2\) The Catholics are not enrolled as Home Guards and are not given
> other posts.
>
> \(3\) Many Catholics at the request of Congress leaders at Raigarh had
> collected a fair sum of money for Gandhi Memorial Fund.  They were
> severely rebuked by some officials.
>
> \(4\) The attitude of some leaders of the Backward Area Welfare Sabha
> was against the Roman Catholics.
>
> \(5\) The whole policy of the Adiwasi Sudhar Sabha was one of sheer
> waste of money and conducive to breach of peace.
>
> \(6\) Government schools should not be opened where Roman Catholic
> schools already exist.

8\. In his report of the tour undertaken in April, 1949 Shri G. X.
Francis voiced almost the same grievances which had already been put
forward by the Bishop of Ranchi in his communication dated 18th April,
1949.

9\. Enquiries were ordered by Government into the allegations made by
the Bishop of Ranchi and Shri Francis and it was reported by the
authorities that in spite of the denial by the Bishop of the part played
by the Jashpur Roman Catholics in the Jharkhand political movement
definite evidence existed to prove that the Roman Catholic Mission
authorities at Ranchi had made common cause with other elements and were
taking active part in this movement.  The vehement opposition of the
Roman Catholic Bishop to the Backward Areas Welfare Scheme was explained
by the blow given to the proselytising activities of the Roman Catholics
through their schools by the Backward Areas Welfare Scheme.  Government
however could not take an immediate decision to permit the Priests to
reside in Udaipur because of the strong feelings of a considerable
section of the people there against such action and therefore it was
considered desirable to await the Constitution which was then being
drafted by the Constituent Assembly.

10\. The efforts of the Christian Association of which Shri G. X.
Francis is the Chairman and of the Bishop of Ranchi to secure
cancellation of the orders in respect of the residence of the Priests in
Udaipur State continued unabated till the promulgation of the
Constitution in January, 1950.  Besides, written individual
representations of Shri Francis and other Catholic leaders, the demand
was raised in some of the All-India conferences of this body.  On the
other hand, non-Christian bodies kept on representing to Government
against relaxing the ban.

11\. The promulgation of the Constitution was soon followed by the entry
into Surguja and Udaipur of the Belgian Jesuits, the Lutherans and some
other Missions, who had hitherto worked from the Ranchi district. 
Strong action was taken by these Mission authorities to spread
Christianity amongst Uraons.  Having firmly and perpetually installed
themselves in the State of Jashpur against the will of the then Rulers
and owing to official pressure brought upon the Rulers by the foreign
administration, it was used as a base of operation for further expansion
into Udaipur and Surguja territories. The Priests had either commenced
their operations by sending Christians into the country who concealed
the fact that they were Christians and took service as field labourers
or lived with relations.  When in course of time a sufficient number of
such people had taken up their residence in the area the Preachers went
into the country and appointed assistants from amongst the Christians
who had gone to live there and a mass movement of conversion to
Christianity ensued.  Reports started pouring in upon the Government
that these Pracharaks and other paid servants were mere pawns in the
hands of the Priests, they acted as Vakils for the people in all matters
and interfered continually in all temporal affairs.  The Catholic,
Lutheran and Swedish Churches soon established centres all along the
Surguja-Bihar border.  In 1950, branches were opened at Ambikapur and
Sitapur in the Surguja district.  The authorities reported to Government
that the method adopted by Christian Missionaries was as follows:-

> After preliminary investigation by a responsible (usually foreign)
> member of a Mission they would establish themselves in a small village
> and try to gain the confidence of the village people.  They would
> gradually start advising the village folk in their local problems and
> very often make out applications and complaints to be presented to the
> authorities.  They would personally follow the matter in courts and
> thus gain the confidence of the party.  Selected Uraon boys would be
> sent out with the help of scholarships to the Missionary headquarters
> in Jashpur or Bihar for training in handicrafts or for higher
> education.  Meanwhile earlier converts from Bihar would be brought
> down to the Centres to move amongst the village folk to propagate the
> benefits of conversion.  Local intelligent villagers (in many cases
> Muslims) would then be selected and appointed as Pracharaks on a pay
> of about Rs. 50 per month.  These paid Pracharaks would move in the
> country-side doing propaganda, paving the way for the Missionaries to
> tackle responsible individuals in near about villages.  Meanwhile
> recent converts at the Centre would receive social attention, new
> clothes, personal advice on agriculture, free chemical manures and
> attention at home to make the houses look distinct from others in the
> village.  They would open schools wherein only prospective converts
> would be admitted.  Free medicine would he distributed on bazar days,
> prospective converts being treated free while others were charged. 
> They would make arrangements to distribute paddy and other seeds free
> to certain selected families.  In some cases cash grants were also
> reported to have been given.  Loans were advanced and the borrower was
> told directly or indirectly that if he became a convert he need not
> repay the money.  Thus, by the system of preferential treatment and
> with temporary physical benefits displayed before them an atmosphere
> in favour of conversion was being created.  In some cases reports of
> coercive methods being used were also received.

12\. As Missionary activities spread in Surguja district local
non-Christians got alarmed.  In 1952, leading citizens of the district,
including the Maharaja of Surguja distributed pamphlets and addressed
gatherings advising the Adivasis not to give up their religion for the
sake of monetary benefits or temptations.  Members of the Rashtriya
Swayam Sewak Sangh and the Arya Samaj joined hands and intensified
propaganda against Missionary activities.  The services of a large
number of enthusiastic workers could be secured by them and
reconversions took place in some numbers.  A conference of Virat Hindu
Rashtriya Sammelan was convened at Ambikapur where all non-Christian
organisations were asked to present a united front against the
Christians and the Jharkhand movement.  Thus, acute tension prevailed in
the area and the authorities thought that the situation may result in
serious trouble unless handled properly.

13\. This tension was attributed chiefly to the objectionable methods
followed by Missionaries, some of which may be narrated.  On 5th May,
1951 at about 8 p.m. in village Chando, Rev. K. C. Burdett, a foreign
Missionary took out a procession with about 25 followers in a truck and
moved into some villages, singing provocative songs denouncing the Hindu
religion.  The matter was reported to the police and an offence was
registered.  As Shri Burdett offered an unconditional written apology
the case was not prosecuted. In village Salba, Police Station
Baikunthpur, 16 Christian Preachers entered the house of one Charan
Uraon on 7th November, 1952, threw away his utensils and threatened him
with violence, because he had opposed conversion.  These persons were
prosecuted and each of them was convicted.  On another occasion in the
same village, recently-appointed Christian Pracharaks, as alleged, used
threats and intimidation against local Uraons for which they were
prosecuted under section 506, Indian Penal Code.  Reports of the use of
violence and threats by a group of recently-appointed Pracharaks were
received from other villages in the area and offences were registered. 
Rev. J. C. Christy, head of a Mission with headquarters in Palamau
district who was organising centres in the Surguja district adjoining
Palamau district, was also reported to have indulged in smuggling rice
to Bihar in contravention of Government orders and to have assaulted
public servants who tried to check the smuggling activities.  Cases were
registered against him and he was prosecuted.  In both these cases he
has recently been convicted.  Another case of a village Headman was
reported in which the Headman complained that when he had gone to
village Amadoli near Madguri to make enquiries about new arrivals Lutia
and other Christians of the village caught hold of the Headman and
snatched his dress and beat him.  A report was made to the police and
investigation was started.  The four Christians concerned were convicted
in a court of law.  In connection with this case Rev. F. Ekka of the
Catholic Ashram made a false complaint against the Head Constable who
had investigated the case. Ekka’s complaint was investigated by the
Sub-Divisional Officer, Police, Ramanujganj, and was found to be
entirely false, presumably made to gain favour of the Uraon converts and
to discourage police officers from performing their duties.

14\. Besides these criminal offences registered and investigated
numerous ordinary complaints made by villagers against the objectionable
activities of Christian Missionaries were presented to the district
authorities at Ambikapur.  Some of them may be enumerated here:-

Thirteen villagers of village Dhajji and Sukhari, Police Station Samri,
complained against Patras Kerketta of the Roman Catholic Mission along
with other Pracharaks who addressed a meeting in the village stating
that the Congress Raj was bad because it was trouble to the Christian
people; that Christians were getting a Raj in which people would get all
facilities.  They asked the villagers to refrain from paying Malguzari
dues to Government, cut the Government forest, assault officers who
would check them and also to beat the persons who refused to join hands
with them.  He asked them to unite together against Government and
threatened that those who did not co-operate would be turned out of the
villages when Christians cot Jhar-Khand.  Complaints against Rev.
Kerketta were made to the authorities at different times by the
villagers of Mandwa, Nawadikalan, Karcha, Khujuridi, Shahapur and
Kandri.  It was brought to the notice of the local officials that Patras
Kerketta had baptized two Uraon babies when their grandmother had taken
them for getting medicine for some eye trouble.  Apprehending a breach
of the peace the Sub-Divisional Officer, Ramanujganj, held a spot
enquiry. According to the wishes of the villagers the babies were
reconverted to Hindu religion and Patras Kerketta tendered an apology to
the Additional District Magistrate.

15\. Instances also came to the notice of the authorities to show that
Missionaries deliberately put up false and frivolous complaints against
Government servants, so that the activities of the Missionaries could be
carried on without being brought to the notice of the higher
authorities.  Enquiries were made by superior officers on all complaints
made by the Missionaries and invariably most of them were found to be
baseless.  A few instances may be mentioned :

Rev. Kerketta reported to the Sub-Divisional Officer (Police),
Ramanujganj, on 20th March, 1950 against Head Constable, Devraj, of
Police Station Samri, alleging that two recently converted Uraons had
been beaten by the Head Constable and hand cuffed. The Sub-Divisional
Officer (Police) enquired into the matter and found the allegation
untrue.  On 16th October, 1951, Rev. J. C. Christy made a complaint to
the District Superintendent of Police. Surguja, against the
Sub-Inspector of Police, Samri, that the latter had directed four
Mission workers to leave villages Sarbana and Khajuri within two days. 
The District Superintendent of Police enquired into the matter and found
that the only action taken by the Sub-Inspector was making enquiries
about new arrivals in his area and eventually the District
Superintendent of Police issued a warning to Shri Christy that he should
refrain from bringing frivolous reports. On 6th November, 1932, Father
L. Von Royee of Ambikapur complained against the Head Constable for
having molested a Christian lady teacher.  It was enquired into by the
Circle Inspector and the allegation was found false.  Father Tigga of
the Roman Catholic Mission complained against the Station House Officer
Sitapur, and his staff for organizing a raid on the Christian Ashram of
Sitapur and for harassing the Christians.  It was found that Christians
of the village were found distilling liquor in the Ashram which they
thought beyond the approach of the authorities.  Eight cases were
registered, eventually tried in court and ultimately ended in
conviction.  Father Tigga’s complaint had been made with a view to get
the cases dropped. Father L. Von Royee made numerous complaints against
the Station House Officer, Rajpur, for unnecessarily harassing
Christians and asking them to leave the Police Station area and these
allegations were also found to be false.  Father Royee was also warned
by the District Superintendent of Police, for putting up baseless and
frivolous complaints.  In that village a case under section 107,
Criminal Procedure Code had been registered against Christians and Gonds
who were quarrelling over the possession of a field.  Father Royee made
a complaint against the Sub-Inspector with a view to obtain his
assistance in getting the land secured for the Christians.  On 15th
December, 1952, a heavy house-breaking by roof-cutting was committed in
the village Batoli of Sitapur Station House and a villager was suspected
by the police.  A Roman Catholic Father took one Putu, son of Hori to
the District Superintendent of Police and alleged that Putu was beaten
by the Sub-Inspector, Sitapur, during investigation.  A Magisterial
enquiry was held and the allegation was found false.  Putu Uraon stated
in writing before the Magistrate that he was instigated by the Roman
Catholic Missionary to give such a complaint against the police.

16\. Government got enquiries made as to the number of persons reported
to be converted.  It was found that whereas only four Uraons were
converted in the year 1948, none in the year 1949, five in the year
1950, there were 40 conversions in the year 1951.  In 1952, the number
of conversions went up to 4,003 and in 1953 the total number of persons
converted was 877, and in 1954, 223.  It was noticed that conversions
had been confined solely to Uraons and in numerous cases entire families
bad been converted. Whereas, Mission activities were confined to only
three villages prior to 1951, it was extended to 23 villages of Surguja
district where large number of conversions took place.

17\. We may refer to Rev. Christy’s case in some detail, because soon
after he was detected smuggling rice to Bihar and a case was started
against him, he made numerous complaints to authorities all over India,
and there was intense press propaganda in foreign countries about the
treatment meted out to Christians in Madhya Pradesh.  The Government of
Madhya Pradesh had prohibited export of rice from the border States to
the neighbouring States of Bihar ant Orissa.  This order had been issued
in the year 1950 when the foodgrain position in India was riot very
satisfactory.  For enforcement of this order outposts had been
established throughout the border in important villages and it was the
duty of the Government servants concerned to prevent smuggling.  From
the very large number of cases started against persons, it appeared that
smuggling was going on a large scale.  On 14th April, 1952 a servant or
nominee of Rev. Christy was caught by the Naka staff carrying rice to
Bihar.  A letter written by Rev. Christy dated 14th April, 1952 was
found in possession of the servant.  In that letter Rev. Christy stated
that he had purchased rice worth Rs. 24 for sending it to his village in
Bihar district.  This letter was found inside the rice bag which was
seized by the Naka staff. Rev. Christy admitted before the Magistrate
having written the letter and having arranged to get rice.  His defence
was that he had applied for a permit to the Deputy Commissioner,
Surguja, on 5th March, 1952 and that he had been orally assured by the
Extra-Assistant Commissioner in charge that the permit would be sent to
Rev. Christy in due course.  Rev. Christy, therefore, pleaded that he
came in possession of the rice believing that he would secure a permit. 
The Magistrate found that the application given by Rev. Christy for
permit bad been rejected by the Deputy Commissioner and that no
assurance was ever given to Rev. Christy by any one.  He was accordingly
convicted.  In another case Rev. Christy along with two others was
prosecuted under section 7 of the Essential supplies (Temporary Powers)
Act, read with section 2 (1) (a) of the Foodgrains Export Restriction
Order, 1943, for exporting a bag of rice from this State to the
adjoining State of Bihar. They were also prosecuted under section 332,
Indian Penal Code, for causing injury to a public servant.  In this case
too they were found guilty and convicted.  According to the prosecution
this incident happened on 27th February, 1952. Rev. Christy’s defence
was that the case had been falsely started because he assisted
Christians in the villages in his jurisdiction in lodging complaints
against the high-handedness and harassment by the Naka staff. It is
apparent that Rev. Christy’s complaints were not restricted to the Naka
staff only but to other authorities as well.  The National Christian
Council of Nagpur asked Mr. P. Lobo, Advocate, to visit the area
concerned and to look into the matter concerning the prosecutions
against Rev. Christy.  The following is the substance of complaints
which the National Christian Council made to the Prime Minister of
India:-

> “It is stated that Christian Missionaries are being harassed in Madhya
> Pradesh.  In view of the numerous instances of this kind, the National
> Christian Council, Nagpur, asked Mr. P. Lobo, Advocate, of Nagpur, to
> make an enquiry into this matter.  Mr. P. Lobo has made an enquiry and
> has submitted a report.  Mr. Lobo gives many instances of harassment
> by local officials and frivolous charges and often of fabricated
> evidence.  One particular case viz., the case of Rev. J. C. Christy
> and two others of village Jodhpur was pointed out as an outstanding
> example of harassment. They are being prosecuted on framed up charges
> of smuggling rice in contravention of Food Control Regulations. 
> According to Mr. Lobo the case of Mr. Christy is typical of several
> such instances of harassment by local officials.  The fact that in a
> very large number of cases the persons concerned have been charged
> with the same offence, viz., smuggling of rice, lends colour to the
> view that this resemblance is not without significance.”

18\. The Government of Madhya Pradesh got an official enquiry made as to
whether there had been any differentiation or harassment of Christian
population or of Christian Missionaries and whether the allegations made
by Mr. Lobo were correct.  A reference to Rev. Christy’s case was also
made by Raj Kumari Amrit Kaur in her letter, dated 9th October, 1952, to
she Chief Minister, Madhya Pradesh, in course of which she stated that
various complaints of discontent, prevailing in Madhya Pradesh against
the Christian community, had come which bad rather perturbed her.  Along
with this letter she enclosed letters from Rev. Christy and Shri Lobo to
her and also Rev. Christy’s memorandum on the persecution of Christians
in Surguja district.  After careful enquiry Government found that the
complaints made by Rev. Christy directly or through Shri Lobo and the
National Christian Council had no basis whatsoever, in fact.  All the
allegations of discrimination and harassment were totally false.  They
found that the allegations had been clearly magnified and what was being
done in the ordinary process of law was given the shape of deliberate
harassment so as to conceal the objectionable activities of Rev. Christy
and other Missionaries in the areas concerned.  Government noticed that
a considerable amount of discontent and resentment prevailed amongst the
local population of the Surguja district over the antireligious and
anti-national activities of Christian Missionaries engaged in efforts to
gain a foothold in the Surguja district which was hitherto a closed
ground for them.  Government had received representations from almost
all members of the Legislative Assembly and other respectable citizens
in this behalf and public opinion was being organized.  A pamphlet was
issued under the signature of the Maharaja of Surguja and other leading
citizens of Ambikapur town in which an appeal was made to the people to
he cautious against the activities of the Missionaries.  The Maharaja of
Surguja had written to Government in October, 1952 protesting against
the political activities carried on by the Missionaries in the name of
religion and exploitation of the rural Adivasis.

19\. It will thus he seen that whereas on the one hand an impression was
being created all over India at the instance of foreign Missionaries
engaged in the Udaipur and Surguja States that the Madhya Pradesh
Government was following a policy discrimination or harassment of the
Christian population and Missionaries, on the other hand numerous
complaints were being received of the objectionable activities of these
foreign Missionaries, especially in the tribal areas and public
resentment was mounting up.  Government was not clear whether the
agitation was confined only to the newly-merged States or whether other
areas of Madhya Pradesh where the Missions were working were also
affected.  It must be noticed that about 30 different Missions are
working its Madhya Pradesh with varying number of centres in each
district.  Almost the entire Madhya Pradesh is covered by Missionary
activities and there is hardly any district where a Mission of one
denomination or the other is not operating in some form or the other. 
More than half the people of Madhya Pradesh (57.4 per cent) consist of
members of the Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes and other Backward
Classes and it is amongst these that Missionary activities are mostly
confined.  The background of Missionary activities in the old Madhya
Pradesh and the merged States was repeatedly brought to Government’s
notice as a warning to be taken notice of and the almost similar methods
adopted by the Roman Catholic and other Missions in the new areas of
Surguja and Udaipur States was reported to be of great significance. 
Missionaries had vehemently denied allegations of proselytism and
anti-national activities and had levelled charges against local
officials whenever enquiries were made by such officers.  In respect of
authorities outside Madhya Pradesh these Missionaries also complained
against the attitude if the Madhya Pradesh Government and vile
propaganda against the Government was carried on in the foreign press. 
In these circumstances, Government decided to get the matter examined
thoroughly through an open and public enquiry and our Committee came to
be appointed.  
 

**CHAPTER III. - CASTES AND TRIBES OF MADHYA PRADESH**

As Missionary activity in Madhya Pradesh is confined mostly to members
of certain Tribes and to certain border areas, it is desirable to have
an idea of some of the important Tribes, their occupations,
characteristics, and social customs.  In subsequent chapters we shall
deal with the Missions working amongst these Tribes and the history of
their advent and progress amongst these Adivasis.

2\. We shall first refer to the important aboriginal Tribes of Uraon,
Baiga, Marias and the Gonds.  Before doing so, it may be useful to
remember that the Aboriginal Tribes mostly called Adiwasis or Adimjatis
claim to be the original inhabitants of India.  The Aryans, who came
into the country subsequently, gradually pushed them back from the
fertile lands of the Indo-Gangestic plain into forests and hilly tracts
of the areas on the borders of the present States of Bengal, Bihar,
Orissa and Madhya Pradesh.  Even in these areas, exploitation of the
simple-minded and illiterate aboriginals continued by the Jamindars, the
businessmen and other communities.  Loans at exhorbitant rates of
interest were advanced, agricultural produce was purchased at cheap
rates, forced or free labour was taken and land made cultivable after
years of toil, was taken back on one pretext or the other.  By this
process the aboriginals were gradually pushed further and further back
into the jungle areas, and practically no attempt to improve the
educational, medical, mental or economic conditions of the aboriginals
was ever made.  The first positive step was taken by the British
Government in the 19th century after important aboriginal rebellions in
the Santhal Parganas of Bengal and the Ranchi district of Bihar, and a
special law was enacted forbidding sale of land by an aboriginal to a
non-aboriginal and other protective measures were introduced.  With the
idea of encouraging the uplift of aboriginals and possibly with the
motive of encouraging their conversion to Christianity, Christian
Missionaries were encouraged to open schools and hospitals in the Tribal
areas and till a few years ago these Christian schools and dispensaries
were the only ones in the hilly Adiwasi country in addition to a few
institutions which the Government had established.  The Christian
Missionaries did their work with considerable devotion and selflessness
and brought about many conversions in spite of the deep-rooted Tribal
tradition and Tribal customs.  One noticeable effect of this long
association of Christian Missionaries with the Tribal people to the
exclusion of other sections of the community has been that the
aboriginals have come to look upon the Hindus as hostile to their
interests and the Christian Missionaries as their friends.

3\. How simple-minded and capable of being duped easily the Tribals are,
will be apparent from some of the Tribes whose characteristics and
customs we have studied in some detail.  The Uraons, according to the
1941 Census, were 1,64,731 in number.  It is a Dravadian Tribe
inhabiting the Korba Zamindari of Bilaspur district, the former States
of Udaipur and Jashpur in the Raigrah district and the Surguja
district.  In the Korba Zamindari, in Udaipur and Jashpur, they are
mostly found in the plains, whereas in the Surguja district they mostly
reside in jungles and on the hills.  In the more settled areas they have
taken to regular cultivation, but in the Surguja district the main
occupation the Uraons still continues to be hunting and gathering of
fruits, although attempts are being made by Government to make them
settle down in plains and to follow modern methods of agriculture.  The
Uraons have no sub-castes among them.  They have numerous Gotras after
the names of plants, trees, animals and birds. etc. Marriage within the
Gotra is not permissible. They use very simple dress mostly of cloth
prepared by the village weaver. Their staple food is rice and dal with
such meat as may be available through hunting.  In marriages and other
social customs and habits they follow the conventional practices of the
Hindus. Liquor plays a very important part in their festivities.  It
will be interesting to note that the Roman Catholics had a greater
number of converts because they did not insist on prohibiting
consumption of liquor, whereas the Lutherans, who at one time advocated
Prohibition, could secure a small number of converts only.

4\. The Baigas are found in the Dindori tahsil of Mandla district. 
Baihar tahsil of Balaghat district and part of Bilaspur district
adjoining the Mandla district.  It is one of the most primitive Tribes
of India and the Baigas are generally interested in ‘bewar’ cultivation
on the slopes of the hills or on the hill-tops.  The Baiga is a good
hunter, who loves his bow and arrow.  Besides hunting, another
occupation is the gathering of wild fruits.  He occasionally prepares
baskets and bamboo mattings.  He is generally shy of civilized man and
dresses scantily. Bodies are tattooed from head to foot and women take
delight in wearing brass ornaments and necklaces of coloured beads.

5\. The Marias are members of another primitive Tribe found in the
Chanda and Bastar districts.  Hunting is their important vocation on
which they occasionally spend months together.  Wild-fruit gathering is
undertaken to supplement their food and also for purposes of barter for
salt, iron, etc.  We were not able to pay a visit to the territories
inhabited by Marias, but we were informed authoritatively that there are
practically no converts to Christianity from this Tribe.

6\. The most numerous of the aboriginal Tribes, the Gonds, reside in
Sanjari-Balod and Bemetara tahsils of Durg district, Baihar tahsil of
Balaghat district and throughout the Mandla, Raipur, Chhindwara, Betul,
Chanda and Bilaspur districts.  They are mostly agriculturists although
some are landless labourers.  Fruit gathering and collection of Tendu
leaves form their sources of subsidiary income.  At one time they were
Rulers of Gondwana and consequently an aristocratic section of the Gonds
has arisen.  Hindu rites and customs in respect of marriages and
observance of festivals are followed, Holi, Dasera, Diwali and
Shivaratri are observed and they dress like other Hindus.

7\. Whether the aboriginal Tribes are Hindus or not has been a question
of great controversy.  The Missionaries have throughout claimed that
they are not Hindus.  A continuous attempt has been made by these
organizations to foster a sense of separateness amongst the Tribes from
the rest of the Hindus.

8\. Speaking about the separation of the aborigines from the mass of the
Indian population Gandhiji remarked: “We were strangers to this sort of
classification- ‘animists’ -aborigines, etc., but we have learnt it from
the English rulers”.  To the question put by Dr. Chesterman whether
Gandhiji’s objection applied to areas like the Kond hills where the
aboriginal races were animists, the unhesitating reply was, “yes, it
does apply, because I know that in spite of being described as animists
these tribes have from times immemorial been absorbed in Hinduism.  They
are, like the indigenous medicine, of the soil, and their roots lie deep
there” (Pages 192 and 299 Christian Missions. Navajiwan Press).

9\. Gandhiji’s statement is amply borne out by the researches of
scholars like the late M. M. Kunte who wrote a thesis on “The
Vicissitudes of Indian Civilization” in 1880.  In the introduction lie
says: “Budhism was a revolution caused by the energy of the aboriginal
races”.  While discussing the social changes during the Acharya period
he says : “intermarriages between the Aryas and the Shudras.  Kolis and
other aborigines were frequent”.  “The Vijasneys sanhita” considers the
growth of the mixed classes an evil and condemns it, but the mixed
classes gradually acquired power and influence in the State.  At the
time of the Mahabharat such great men as “Vyas” and “Vidur” were the
offsprings of the connection of the Aryan with the aborigines. 
Satyavati, who was the daughter of the Koli chieftain became the queen
of King Shantanu.  Dhritrastra, Pandu and Vidur were the offsprings of
Vyas.  At that time no stain was attached to intermarriages between the
Aryas and the aborigines.  Bhima married Heedimba and Arjun married Naga
girl called Ullupi.  A class of Aryas called Upakrishta was created. 
Upakrishta means those who were admitted to the privilege of performing
a sacrifice. (Pages 252-253 ibid).

10\. The Nishadas were an aboriginal tribe.  They were sometimes
included in the Pancha-Janah, i.e., the five-fold Aryas.  Gradually the
Nishadas were incorporated. (Page 254 ibid).

11\. As to the evolution of castes it has to be noticed that among the
various ways in which they came to be formed was the absorption of the
tribes into the Hindu social system as stated in the “Imperial Gazetteer
of India” 1907, Volume I, page 314.  Where a tribe has insensibly been
converted into a caste, it preserved its original name and customs, but
modified its animistic practices more and more in the direction of
orthodox Hinduism.  Numerous examples of this process are to be found
all over India and it has been at work for centuries.

12\. We may quote here the well-known verse about the mixed origin of
those who are honoured as religious leaders in Hindu society: It is as
follows:-

> ""OmVm{ ì\`mñVw H¡$dË\`m© :  
> íd \[m·\`míÀ\` \[amea :  
> ew·\`m ewH$: H$UmXm»\`ñVWm{by·\` :  
> gwVm{ ^dV².................''

(Bhavisya Mahapuran Chapter 42).  Valmiki, the author of the Epic
Ramayan and Hanuman the so-called monkey God were also aborigines.

13\. The process by which this transformation takes place is as follows:
The leading men of an aboriginal tribe having somehow got on in the
world and become landed proprietors manage to enroll themselves in one
of the most distinguished castes.  They usually set up as Rajputs and
their first step is to consult a Brahmin to discover for them a mythical
ancestor of some great Rajput Community.  By the process of
inter-marriages they come to be absorbed in the fullest sense of the
word and are locally accepted as high class Hindus. (Imperial Gazetteer
of India, Volume I, Page 312.)

14\. It is interesting to see how the matter came to be dealt with by
the Census officers.  Here we gratefully draw upon the result of the
study of the Aboriginal problem by Dr. G. S. Ghurye (Cantab.), Head of
the Department of Sociology, Bombay University, pp. 2-8, The Aborigines
so-called and their Future.  In 1891 J.A. Baines, the Commissioner of
Census considered the distinction between tribal people who were
Hinduized and those that followed their tribal form of religion as
futile because, “every stratum of Indian society is more or less
saturated with Animistic Conceptions but little raised above those which
predominate in the early state of religious development. (Census of
India 1891 Report, Volume I, Part I, page 158).  In the census of 1901
Sir Herbert Risley observed that animism comprised a medley of
heterogeneous and uncomfortable superstitions and that it figured in the
original returns of the census under as many different designations as
there are tribes professing it.  According to him Hinduism itself was
animism more or less transformed by philosophy or as magic tempered by
metaphysics and his final opinion was that no sharp line of demarcation
could be drawn between Hinduism and Animism as the one shaded away
insensibly into the other. (The People of India second edition, pages
218, 233 and 245.)

15\. In 1911 Sir E. A. Gait, the Commissioner of the Census remarked
that because a man sought the help of a Brahmin priest or made offerings
at a Hindu shrine, it did riot follow that he had given up the last
shreds of his inherited animistic beliefs and that owing to the gradual
nature of the process of Hinduizing it was extremely difficult to say at
what stage a man should be regarded as having become a Hindu (Census of
India, 1911, India, Volume I, Part I, pages 129 130). Sir A. J. Baines
wrote in 1912 in his Ethnography, pages 8 and 9, “one of the most
interesting ethnographical questions entering into the census enquiry is
that of the rate at which Brahminism is, in name at least absorbing the
animistic tribal population.” In order to solve the practical difficulty
which the census officers had to face he used the term “tribal animism”
or “tribal religion” for the religion returned under the tribal name, by
those who did not adhere to any of the wider creeds.  In the year 1921
Mr. P. C. Tallents, the Superintendent of the Census Operations in Bihar
and Orissa and Mr. Sedgwick, the Superintendent of the Census in Bombay
were faced with the difficulty of distinguishing a Hindu from an
animist, and Mr. Sedgwick recommended in unequivocal terms that animism
as a religion should be entirely abandoned and that all those hitherto
classed as animists should be grouped with the Hindus (Census of India,
1921-Bihar and Orissa Report, page 125, and Bombay Report, page 67). 
Mr. J. T. Marten, the Commissioner of Census arriving been impressed by
their views changed the religious division of animism of the previous
censuses into that of tribal religion; but he at the same time was not
satisfied about that way of solving tee problem, for he remarked “If the
word animism is vague in respect of what it connotes, the term “tribal
religion” is not by any means definite in what it denotes.” (Census of
India, 1921, India Report, Volume I, Part I, page 111.)

16\. In 1931 Dr. J. H. Hutton, the Commissioner of Census, retained the
heading “tribal religion” in the body of the report, but used that term
in contradistinction to Hindu, Muslim, Christian, etc., in the tables at
the end of the chapter on religion.  Although he isolated the tribal
people in this way, he admitted that the line between Hinduism and
tribal religion was difficult to draw, and that the inclusion of the
latter within the Hindu fold was easy. (Census of India, 1931, India
Report, Volume I, Part I, page 397.)

17\. Mr. W. H. Shoobert, the Superintendent of the Census of 1931 for
the Central Provinces and Berar also referred to the difficulty of
obtaining satisfactorily accurate returns of those who retained their
tribal creeds but deliberately returned themselves as Hindus for the
reason that it would elevate them in the social scale, whereas to the
more simple of the tribals the term “Hindu” conveyed no connection with
any religion but merely indicated a race.  He also was impressed by the
fact that “there was much in the religion of each which could easily be
assimilated to that of the other”.  But he thought that it would be
incorrect to class the Hinduized aboriginal with the ordinary Hindu
villager of the Central Provinces, for although after centuries of
varying degrees or contacts each may have assimilated ideas and customs
from the other, their cultures are most obviously distinct (Census of
India, 1931, Central Provinces and Berar Report, Volume XII, Part I,
pages 397 and 333).  It may be mentioned here that Mr. W. V. Grigson,
I.C.S., agreed with Dr. V. Elwin’s opinion that the religion of the
Indian aboriginal outside Assam should be regarded as the religion of
the Hindu family, and that for purposes of Census, all aborigines should
be classed as Hindus by religion (page 8, The Aboriginal Problem in the
Central Provinces and Berar).

18\. It is not easy to find any sound reason for isolating the tribal
people from the Hindus in view of the repeated admissions made that the
animistic or tribal religion was hardly distinguishable from the Hindu
religion.  The mystery is solved when we come to examine the Missionary
activities within these tribal areas.

19\. Mr. Stent, who was Deputy Commissioner of Amravati sent a note to
the Census Officer to say that the educated Indian officers of
Government maintained that Gonds, Korkus, Bhils, Gowaris and Banjaras
were Hindus, and he himself conceded that when members of these tribes
settled in a Hindu village they become Hindus.  He commented on the
tendency of Hinduism to absorb the religion of other people, and also
pointed out that the aboriginals returned themselves as Hindus to escape
from the taint of barbarism and to raise themselves in the social scale.
(Census Report, Central Provinces and Berar, 1931, Volume XII, Part I,
page 329.)

20\. Viewing the problem from the point of view of caste, it would
appear that the process was similar to that of religion.  In 1891 Baines
arranged the castes according to their traditional occupations, viz.,
under the category of Agricultural and Pastoral castes lie formed a
sub-heading and named it forest tribes.  That indicates that the forest
dwellers were not excluded from the description of the caste.

21\. In the next two censuses, i.e., of 1901 and 1911, Sir Herbert
Risley and Sir E. A. Gait included the so-called animists in the table
for castes along with others, indicating against each the number
following Hinduism or Animism or some other religion. (Ghurye, page 7).

22\. In 1921 Mr. Marten followed the same practice, only changing the
heading of Animism to Tribal religion.  In 1931 Dr. Hutton substituted
the term “Primitive Tribes” for “Forest Tribes” and added a special
appendix on “Primitive Tribes” giving their names and numbers.

23\. In the Census of 1941 there was a sharp departure from the previous
one of 1931.  The heads were counted community-wise instead of on the
basis of religion.  To elucidate the matter, a tribal who belonged to
the so-called scheduled tribes was classified as such under the original
community table despite his or her being a Christian fly faith.  The
consequence was that to all appearances the all-India figures for Indian
Christians in that year were shown as 6,040,665 which was less by
256,098 than the previous all-India figure, viz., 6,296,733 as recorded
in 1931.  That, however, did not mean that Christianity failed to
progress in the decade between 1931 and 1941.  The explanation of this
paradox is to be found in the short note on community made by Mr. Yeats,
the Census Commissioner of India (Chapter IV, page 29, Volume I, Census
of India, 1941, Part I Table) where he discloses that approximately
one-twentieth of the total tribal population falls within the Christians
on the religions basis.  Calculating the total figure for the whole of
India on the lines indicated by him, it would be found that there was
actually an increase of 3,474,128 persons approximately among the
Christian community during the decade 1931-41 (pages 448-449, Christian
Proselytism in India by Parekh).

24\. By reason of the Backwardness of these tribes, the Constitution of
India has made special provisions for their protection.  Under Article
46 of the Constitution, the State is directed to promote with special
care the educational and economic interests of the weaker sections of
the people, and in particular, of the scheduled castes and the scheduled
tribes, and to protect them from social injustice and all forms of
exploitation.  The Constitution has thus recognised that members of the
Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes belong to the weaker sections of
society and has sought to protect them from all forms of exploitation. 
In pursuance of these obligations, the Government of Madhya Pradesh have
created a separate Tribal Welfare Department which has prepared a scheme
for the uplift of aborigines.  The main features of the scheme are to
look after the educational and other needs of the aborigines so as to
bring them on a par with other people.  Government approved a scheme,
the total estimated cost of which was Rs. 169,60 lakhs in the First
Five-Year Plan. It was introduced in December 1952 and 40 centres were
established each providing for the following facilities and services:-

\(a\) A primary and a residential middle school.  

\(b\) A midwife for child welfare and ante-natal and post-natal
treatments.  

\(c\) A stud bull and poultry farm.  

\(d\) Cottage industries workshop.  

\(e\) Anti-malaria control measures.  

\(f\) Distribution of simple medicines.  

\(g\) Multi-purpose co-operative societies.  

\(h\) Arrangements for social, cultural and moral uplift activities.  

\(i\) A drinking-water well.  

\(j\) Approach roads.
