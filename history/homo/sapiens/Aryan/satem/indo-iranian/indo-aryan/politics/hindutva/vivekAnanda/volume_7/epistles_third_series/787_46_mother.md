## XLVI

CHICAGO,  
*30th Nov*.*, 1899*.

MY DEAR MOTHER, (Mrs. Leggett.)

Nothing new — except Madame Calvé's visit. She is a great woman. I wish
I saw more of her. It is a grand sight to see a giant pine struggling
against a cyclone. Is it not?

I leave here tonight. These lines in haste as A\_\_ is waiting. Mrs.
Adams is kind as usual. Margot doing splendidly. Will write more from
California.

With all love to Frankincense,

Ever your son,

VIVEKANANDA.
