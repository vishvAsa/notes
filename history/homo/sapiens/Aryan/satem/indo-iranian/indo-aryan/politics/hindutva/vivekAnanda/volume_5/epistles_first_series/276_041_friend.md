## XLI

C/O MISS DUTCHER,  
THOUSAND ISLAND PARK, N.Y.,  
*18th June, 1895*.

DEAR FRIEND, (Mr. F. Leggett)

A letter reached me from Mrs. Sturges the day before she left, including
a cheque for $50. It was impossible to make the acknowledgement reach
her the next day; so I take this opportunity to ask you the favour of
sending her my thanks and acknowledgement in your next to her.

We are having a nice time here except, as an old Hindu proverb says,
that "a pestle must pound even if it goes to heaven". I have to work
hard all the same. I am going to Chicago in the beginning of August.
When are you starting?

All our friends here send their respects to you. Hoping you all bliss
and joy and health, and ever praying for the same.

I remain, yours affectionately,

VIVEKANANDA.
