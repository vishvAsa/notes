## LXII

*To Miss Josephine MacLeod*

228 WEST 39TH STREET,  
NEW YORK,  
*8th December, 1895*.

DEAR JOE JOE,

After 10 days of the most disastrous voyage I ever had I arrived in New
York. I was so so sick for days together.

After the clean and beautiful cities of Europe, New York appears very
dirty and miserable. I am going to begin work next Monday. Your bundles
have been safely delivered to the heavenly pair, as Alberta calls them.
They are as usual very kind. Saw Mrs. and Mr. Salomon and other friends.
By chance met Mrs. Peak at Mrs. Guernsey's but yet have no news of Mrs.
Rothinburger. Going with the birds of paradise to Ridgely this
Christmas. Wish ever so much you were there.

Had you a nice visit with Lady Isabelle? Kindly give my love to all our
friends and know oceans yourself.

Excuse this short letter. I shall write bigger ones by the next. 

Ever yours in the Lord,

VIVEKANANDA.
