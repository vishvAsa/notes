## CXL

*To Sister Christine*

SUEZ,

*14th July 1899*.

MY DEAR CHRISTINA,

You see this time I am really out, and hope to reach London in two
weeks. I am sure to come to America this year and earnestly hope will
have the opportunity of seeing you. I am so materialistic yet, you know!
Want to see my friends in the gross body.

I had a beautiful letter from Baby \[Stella Campbell\] before I left. I
am soon going to pen a reply to your care, as directed. I could not
write her earlier.

I was so, so bad in health in India. My heart went wrong all the way —
what with mountain climbing, bathing in glacier water and nervous
prostration! I used to get terrible fits \[of asthma\] — the last
lasting about seven days and nights. All the time I was suffocating and
had to stand up.

This trip has almost made a new man of me. I feel much better and, if
this continues, hope to be quite strong before I reach America. How are
you? What are you doing? Write everything about yourself, c/o E. T.
Sturdy Esq., 25 Holland Villas Road, London, W.

With everlasting love and blessings,

Ever yours in the Lord,  
VIVEKANANDA.
