Elsewhere we have traced Mr. Tilak's connection 
with the Congress from 1889 down to the early 
years of the present century. We have seen, how, 
in the period of poUtical re-action, beginning 'with 
1897, the Congress leaders showed their ** states- 
manship," by scrupulously following a policy of 
Moderation, which, very often meant inaction, timi- 
dity or indifference to the National good. 
Ever since his return (1899) ^^ public life after 
one year's incarceration,Mr. Tilak had been fighting with 
these tendencies in and out of the National Congress. 
but what with his pre-occupations in the Tai Maharaj 
Case, and what with the small following he had in the 
Congress, he could not effectually raise his voice against 
the policy of inertia and negation, which Sir Pheroze- 
shah later came to glory in. From 1905, however all 
this was changed. The wave of awakening in the coun- 
try strengthened the nascent New Party and Mr. Tilak 
could get that amount of following in the Congress 
which was required to put up a fair fight. This tended 
to enUven the proceedings of the Congress and increase - 



156 # LOKAMANYA TILAK 

its popularity. Mr. Tilak determined that the Congress 
should no longer retain its moribund character. He 
resolved that (i) the Congress tradition of seeking 
official favour, or at least official recognition must 
be broken ; (2) the National sentiments must be 
more faithfully echoed in the Congress resolutions ; 
(3) The Congress must no longer remain a holiday 
gathering, but must work continuously and lead the 
National agitations. This was a war between auto- 
cracy and democracy, oldage and youth, apathy and 
enthusiasm, between timidity and courage. The old 
generation tried to win the officials ; Mr. Tilak 
sought to inspire and organize the people of the country. 
At the Benares Congress (1905) Mr. Tilak got much, 
though not all, that he wanted. Sir Pherozeshah, " the 
Autocrat of the Congress " was absent ; and the Presi- 
dent, Mr. Gokhale, had enthusiastically championed the 
Bengalees' cause in England and had justified the in- 
aguration of the Swadeshi Boycott movement in 
speeches which came as a surprise to many of his fol- 
lowers. In his Presidential address, he severely criti- 
cized the Viceroyalty of Lord Curzon, compared it with 
the odious reign of Aurangzeb and spoke in favour of 
Swadeshi and Boycott. Mr. Tilak wanted separate re- 
solutions on Swadeshi and Boycott. The resolution, 
justifying the Boycott of British goods, as perhaps the 
only constitutional and effective means left to the 
Bengalees, was huddled up with the condemnation of 
the repressive Policy of the Bureaucracy. Mr. Tilak 
would have liked an independent resolution on the sub- 
ject. He wanted the Boycott resolution to go one 
step further and call upon the various Provinces of 



TILAK AND THE CONGRESS — II ^ 157 

India to prove their sympathy for the Bengalees by 
adopting Boycott, but evidently, the Moderates were 
not yet prepared to recommend Boycott for aU the 
provinces. Mr. Tilak, however, was not discouraged* 
The Congress, he said, had broken its tradition by sup- 
porting the Boycott and he looked up to the next Con- 
gress at Calcutta, to vigourously continue the work so 
substantially begun at Benares. 

In June igo6, Mr. Tilak paid a visit to Calcutta on 
the occassion of the Shivaji festival. Soon after, Babu 
Bipin Chander Pal made the proposal that Mr. Tilak 
should preside over the Calcutta Congress. This was 
the first time in the history of the Congress when Mr. 
Tilak 's nam.e was seriously proposed for the highest 
honour at the disposal of the Nation. Mr. Pal was not 
content merely with proposing Mr. Tilak's name. He 
carried on a regular campaign. The Moderates were 
afraid. Sir Pherozeshah set racking his brains to avert 
the " catastrophe." Babu Surendranath, evidently 
smarting under the misrepresentations of the " crown- 
ing " incident promised every possible help to the Lion 
of Bombay. At last a master stroke was delivered A 
cable was sent to Dadabhai Nooroji, the G. O. M. of 
India ; it said that the Congress was in danger ; would 
Dadabhai return to India and preside over the Congress? 
The Cable was despatched by Babu Bhupendra Natb 
Basu, the right-hand man of Babu Surendranath. 
Without consulting his colleagues, without consulting 
the Reception Committee, he took this step, relying 
upon Dababhai's innocence and fidelity. Dadabhai 
was the last man to shirk help when the Congress was 
reported to be in danger. At once he cabled back aa 



158 LOKAMANYA TILAK 

affirmative and the Moderates were delighted at having 
out-witted the Extremists ; for it was clear that none 
would like to contest the honour of the Congress Pre- 
sidentship with Dadabhai Nooroji. 

But though the question of the Presidentship of the 
Congress was thus settled to the satisfaction of the Mode- 
rates, the larger question still remained. " Should the 
Policy of the Congress be changed ? " (The Hon.) Mr. 
Khaparde, after full consultation with Mr. Tilak sent 
a Circular letter to leading Congressmen as early as July 
(1906) wherein he showed how a radical change had 
been necessitated in the programme of the Congress. 
The letter attracted considerable attention, specially 
in Anglo-Indian quarters. It was feared that the 
Congress would go out of the hands of the Moderates 
and so Anglo-Indian journals who had abused even 
Sir Henry Cotton and Mr. Gokhale as late as 1904 and 
1905 respectively, in a sudden burst of overflowing love, 
appealed to these very Congressmen not to play into 
the hands of the Extremists. Some of the Moderates 
themselves were scared away by Mr. Khaparde's letters. 
Regarding the main point suggested by the letter, Mr. 
Tilak said : — [Kesari nth December 1906). 

*' We are sometimes told not to be dis-heartened. If 
the Moderates think that we are easily disappointed and 
lack grim determination, they are entirely mistaken. 
We have lost faith, not in the ultimate result, but in 
the dilatory activities of the Congress. To us, the hold- 
ing of the Congress for three days in the year, the tepid 
work of the British Congress Committee and the 
occasional sending of a deputation to England-— 
seems quite an insufficient work. • Not that we 



TILAK AND THE CONGRESS — II 159 

liave no faith in ' Constitutional agitation/ We do 
not want to over-throw the Enghsh Government. 
Political rights will have to be fought for. The 
Moderates think that these can be won by 
persuasion. We think they can only be got by strong 
pressure. Will the Congress exert itself to apply this 
pressure ? That is the point ; and if such a pressure is 
to be applied, the Congress must leave this holiday cha- 
racter and develop into an organisation working con- 
tinuously and energetically." 

All India anxiously awaited to see how the Calcutta 
Congress would give its decision on this point. Anglo- 
India wanted also to see whether the differences of opi- 
nion between the Old and the New Parties would lead 
to open and permanent rupture. They wanted the 
Extremists to be driven out of the Congress. But this 
was an impossibility. In the first place, the Presiden- 
tial Chair was occupied by the Angel of Peace. Besides, 
Bengal was a strong-hold of the * Extremists ' and in 
the Congress session the New Party commanded a 
majority. The Presidential address was devoted to the 
theme of Swaraj. It, therefore, disappointed the 
Englishman vv^hich blamed Dadabhai who " being called 
upon to quench the flames of hatred towards the British 
Rule in India, had only used kerosine for that purpose." 
Mr. Tilak aided by Babu Bepin Chander Pal organised 
a private meeting of the Delegates of the New Party to 
discuss the subjects that the Congress should deal with ; 
and at this meeting it was decided to get the Congress 
adopt three distinct resolutions on (i) Swadeshi, (2) 
Boycott (3) and National Education. Of these, the last 
was passed by the Subjects' Committee without any 



l6o LOKAMANYA TILAK 

ado. The storm of discussion — hot and acrimonious — -- 
centred round the Boycott and the Swadeshi resolu- 
tions. At the Benares Congress, Boycott was accepted 
as a political weapon but only incidentally, in the reso- 
lution on the repressive policy of the Government. 
This was merely a flank movement. Mr. Tilak was not 
content with it. He wanted to make a frontal attack 
and after a prolonged controversy and frequent passa- 
ges at arms with Moderate leaders like Sir P. M. Mehta^ 
he wrung out the words " the Boycott movement was 
and is legitimate." At the Benares Congress it was 
only the " Boycott of British goods " that had received 
the seal of the Congress. Now, at Calcutta it was not 
merely *' economic Boycott " but something more. 
Boycott Political. At Benares no general reasons 
were given for the acceptance of Boycott. But 
at Calcutta, the mistake was rectified ; and the 
preamble to the resolution specifically referred 
to the fact that Indians had no share in the 
administration and that their representations to Go- 
vernment went unheeded. There was only one thing 
wanting in the resolution. The resolution approved of 
the Boycott Movement as started in Bengal ; it did not 
urge other provinces to follow suit. But Mr. Tilak 
pointed out that neither did the resolution clearly state 
that the Boycott was to be confined to Bengal alone. 

It is strange but true that in the draft resolution on 
Swadeshi, discussed in the Subjects' Committee, people 
were not called upon to purchase Swadeshi goods even at 
a sflcri^ce; stranger still that when Mr. Tilak brought the 
amendment, it was hastily pronounced to have been 
defeated. Mr. Tilak demanded a poll, which was re- 



TILAK AND THE CONGRESS — II l6r 

fused. As a protest, he had to leave the Subjects' 
Committee accompanied, by nearly sixty members in- 
cluding distinguished Nationalists like Mr. Pal and 
Babu Ashwini Kumar Dutt. Mr. Tilak wanted to move 
his amendment in the open Congress. Accordingly he 
sent notice thereof to the President, who, at last reali- 
sing the strength of Mr. Tilak's party accepted the 
amendment and bodily inserted it into the main propo- 
sition. Discord was thus timely averted and Mr.Tilakj 
speaking to the resolution declared that he was pleased 
to state that some ideas he favoured had been incorpo- 
rated in the resolution ; he further said that he was 
glad they had come to such a solution because the 
Anglo-Indians had predicted that the 22nd Congress 
would probably be the last ; he expressed his satisfac- 
tion that all differences had been squared, and that 
both the parties had approached the question in a spirit 
of conciliation and had met half way. 

Summarising the work of the Calcutta Congress, Mr. 
Tilak said : — 

" The Congress has now in effect laid down that 
Swaraj or Self-Govemment is the goal to be ultimately 
and gradually attained by the Nation and that, while 
the Nation may pray and petition to the Government 
as part of the constitutional agitation and seek the 
redress of grievances or the fruition of political aspira- 
tions, the Nation will mainly rely on its owti endeavours 
to accomplish the object. Swadeshi, Boycott, and 
National Education are the three most potent weapons 
given into our hands by the National Congress, and 
with these we must establish Swaraj." 

At Calcutta, Lala La j pat Rai had invited the Congress 
11 



l62 LOKAMANYA TILAK 

to Lahore. But imagining that Napgur was a safer 
place, SirP; M. Mehta got the venue of the next Congress 
fixed at Nagpur. It is said that when the Moderate 
leaders left Calcutta, it was already arranged that Dr. 
Rash Behari Ghose was to be made President at Nagpur. 
In the various Provincial Conferences held in the first 
few months of 1907, attempts were made to go back 
upon the Calcutta Resolutions and thus prepare the 
ground for a retrograde step in December. In Bengal, 
happily there was no such attempt, as both the parties 
were suijiciently advanced and knew the value of unity. 
But in the Provincial Conference at Surat, Sir Pheroze- 
shah, taking advantage of Mr. Tilak's absence, tried to 
overawe the " Extremists '* and succeded in dropping 
the Resolutions on Boycott and National Education. 
In the Provincial Conference at Raipur (Berar), there 
was a serious dispute over the singing of such an inno- 
cent song, as the *' Bande Mataram "; and it was only 
the presence of Mr. Khaparde that compelled the 
Moderate leaders to give in. At Allahabad, Pandit 
Madan Mohan Malaviya, who in the Calcutta Congress 
had declared that his province would not accept Boy- 
cott, refused admittance to about 200 Delegates to the 
Conference. He put forth the strange plea of inconve- 
nience but presumably he wanted to boycott the sup- 
porters of Boycott. All these signs showed how the 
Moderates were smarting under their " discomfiture " 
at Calcutta. At Nagpur, a Conference was held on 
January'' 27th, 1907, to appoint the Provincial Commit- 
tee which in its turn met on February 22nd to consti^ 
tute the Reception Committee. The new constitution 
of the Congress had practically delegated the work of 



TILAK AND THE CONGRESS — II 163 

nominating the President of the forthcoming Congress 
to the Reception Commitee which by a majority of | 
had to select the President. It was, therefore, natural 
that the Moderates and the NationaUsts should try to 
secure greater representation for their Parties on the 
Reception Committee. Each party tried its level best 
to secure a majority and on September ist, it was found 
that while the Moderates had secured 800 Members, the 
Nationalists had got about 1800. Finding that Mr. 
Tilak could not be elected President, the Nationalist 
gave in only 26 names with-holding the long list of 1800 
together with the money (Rs. 45,000) collected at the 
rate of Rs. 25 per voter. The Moderates demanded this 
money and on the Nationalists refusing to give it, they 
proceeded to eject the Nationalist Members from the 
Executive Committee. This they had no right to do as 
the Executive Committee was already constituted 
months back. The Hon. Mr. Chitnavis called a meeting 
of the Reception Committee without consulting the 
Executive Committee or Dr. Munje, the joint General 
Secretary. The meeting (September 22nd, 1907) was a 
fiasco and the Hon. convener was the object of a hostile 
demonstration on the part of an angry mob. A compro- 
mise was attempted. Dr. Gour, himself a Moderate, 
proposed that the work of the Congress should begin 
with Rs. 20,000 collected by the Moderates from the 
800 enlisted members of the Reception Committee 
together with a loan of Rs. 5,000 from each party. 
The ; Moderates were obstinate. They were unwilling 
to allow the NationaUsts single-handed to hold the 
Congress Session at Nagpur ; they were unable or afraid 
to hold it themselves ; they, therefore, did the easiest 



164 LOKAMANYA TILAK 

and most inglorious thing ; they reported to the All- 
India Congress Committee their inability to hold the 
Sessions of the Congress at Nagpur. A meeting of the 
All-India Congress Committee was held at Bombay on 
November loth, and there, in spite of the protests of 
Messrs. Tilak and Khaparde, in spite of the willingness 
of the Nagpur Nationalists to accept any compromise 
for the sake of the reputation of their City and Province, 
the venue of the Congress was changed to Surat, one of 
the strongholds of the Moderates. 

Alerady the people were in an angry mood. Repres- 
sion was at work in several part of India. Bombay was 
comparatively quiet. Far in the South, Rajmahendri, 
Cocoanada were seething with discontent. More im- 
portant still were the events in the Punjab, where the 
mistaken and short-sighted policy of the Bureaucracy 
in trying to pass into Acts two Bills — the Colonisation 
Bill and the Land Alienation Act Amendment Bill — - 
endangered the rights of the people over their lands 
and made the discontent acute. The abnormal increase 
of Land Revenue in the Rawalpindi District, the in- 
crease of the Canal rates on the Bari-Doab Canal, touch- 
ed the pockets of even the poorest cultivators and thus 
created a grave situation. The Editor and the Pro- 
prietor of the Punjabee were prosecuted and in May 
1907 Lala Rajpat Rai and Sirdar Ajit Singh were de- 
ported. This deportation created a storm of indigna- 
tion and convinced the country of its helplessness in 
defending its birth-rights. In Bengal, the Editor of 
Yugantar was sent to goil. The Editor of the 
Sandhya refused to conduct his defence because " he 
did not think that in carrying on the God-appointed 



TILAK AND THE CONGRESS — II 165 

^anission of Swaraj he was in any way responsible to the 
aUen rulers." Babu Arabindo Ghosh was arrested on 
a charge of sedition, and on November ist, 1907 the 
Seditious Meetings Act was passed, despite the opposi- 
tion of the Hon. Mr. Gokhale and of the Hon, Mr. Rash 
Behari Ghosh, and it was rumoured that the liberty of 
Press was also on the point of being taken away. 

On November nth, 1907, Lala Rajpat Rai and Sirdar 
Ajit Singh were released. This news, welcome in each 
respect, tended to make the Congress " confusion worse 
confounded." At once, as if by instict, the cry went 
round that Lajpat Rai was the fittest man to preside. 
At Surat on November 21st, the Reception Committee 
was formed and the office bearers of the Congress were 
appointed. To prevent many of the Congress-men in 
Maharashtra from attending the meeting, it was an- 
nounced that the Presidential Election would be made 

•on November 24th. Though thus out-manoeuvred, the 
young Nationalists of Surat and adjoining places 
stoutly suggested the name of Lala Lajpat Rai for the 
Presidential post. Mr. Gokhale argued, coaxed, ap- 
pealed ; and when every device proved unavailing, he 
removed the velvet glove from off his mailed list, and 
challenged the younger Nationalists to secure Lala 
Lajpat Rai's election in the face of the packed majority 
of the Moderates. The Nationalists were in a fix. 
They could not allow the Hero of the hour to be humi- 
liated by the unworthy tactics of the Moderates. Silent- 
ly and sullenly they allowed Dr. Rash Behari Ghose to 
be ' unaniomously ' elected President. 

The selection of Dr. Ghose for the Presidential chair 
-was only part of a wider plan of going back upon the 



l66 LOKAMANYA TILAK 

position accepted at Calcutta and of permanentlj?? 
shutting out the ' Extremists ' from all future sessions- 
of the Congress. The Indu Prakash and the Indian: 
Social Reformer clearly hinted this purpose and the 
whole conduct of the Moderate leaders all over India 
in the eventful months of 1907 clearly strengthens this 
belief. It was the duty of the Moderates and especial- 
ly that of the Hon. Mr. Gokhale who was entrusted 
with the work of drafting the resolutions to publicly 
declare if this belief was incorrect and unfounded.* 
A list of the headings of the subjects likely to be 
taken up for discussion by the Surat Congress 
was of&cicially published a week or ten days 
before the date of the Congress Sessions. This list did 
not include the subjects of Self-Government, Boycottp 
National Education on all of which distinct and sepa- 
rate resolutions were passed at Calcutta in 1906. This- 
omission naturally strengthened the suspicion that the. 
Bombay Moderates really intended to go back from the 
position taken up by the Calcutta Congress in these 
matters. The Press strongly commented upon this 
omission and Mr. Tilak, who reached Surat on the morn- 
ing of the 23rd December, denounced such retrogres- 
sion as suicidal in the interests of the countrj^ more, 
especially at the present juncture, and appealed to the 
Surat public to help the Nationalists in their endeavours. 
to maintain at least the status quo in these matters. 
The next day, a Conference of about five hundred 
Nationalist Delegates was held at Surat under the 
Chairmanship of Shrijut Arabindo Ghose, where it was. 

* We are indebted for the bulk of the contents of the next 
8 Pages to the closely-reasoned document published by th©- 
Nationalist Leaders soon after the break-up of the Congress. 



TILAK AND THE CONGRESS — II 167 

decided that the NationaUsts should prevent the at- 
tempted retrogression of the Congress by all Constitu- 
tional means even by opposing the election of the Pre- 
sident, if necessary ; and a letter was written to the 
Congress Secretaries requesting them to make arrange- 
ments for dividing the house, if need be, on every con- 
tested proposition, including that of election of the 
President. 

In the meanwhile, a press-note was issued by the Re- 
ception Committee to the effect that the statement that 
certain resolutions adopted in 1906 were omitted from 
the Congress Programme prepared by the Surat Recep- 
tion Committee was wholly unfounded ; but the draft 
resolutions themselves were still with-held from the 
public ; on the morning of the 25th December, Mr. 
Tilak happened to get a copy of the draft of the propos- 
ed Constitution of the Congress prepared by the Hon. 
Mr. Gokhale. In this draft, the object of the Congress 
was thus stated : " The Indian National Congress 
has for its ultimate goal, the attainment by India 
of Self-Government similar to that enjoyed by the 
other members of the British Empire. Mr. Tilak, 
addressing a meeting of the Delegates the same morn- 
ing, at the Congress Camp, explained how this Consti- 
tution was devised to exclude the Nationalists from the 
Congress by making the acceptance of this new creed 
an indispensable condition of the Congress membership. 
Mr. Tilak further stated in plain terms, that if they 
were assured that no sliding back of the Congress would 
be attempted, the opposition to the election of the Pre- 
sident would be withdrawn. The Delegates at the 
meeting were asked to sign a letter to Dr. Ghose re- 



l68 LOKAMANYA TILAK 

questing him to take up the four old resolutions for re- 
affirmation. 

Lala Lajpat Rai who arrived at Surat on the morn- 
ing of 25th, saw Messrs. Tilak and Khaparde in the 
afternoon and intimated to them his intention to ar- 
range for a Committee of a few leading Delegates from 
each side to settle the question in dispute. Messrs. 
Tilak and Khaparde having agreed, he went to Mr. 
Gokhale to arrange for the Committee if possible ; and 
Messrs. Tilak and Khaparde returned to the Nationa- 
list Conference which was held that evening. At this 
Conference, a Nationalist Committee consisting of one 
Nationalist Delegate from each Province was appointed 
to earry on the negotiations with the other side ; and it 
was decided that if the Nationalist Committee failed 
to obtain any assurance from the responsible Congress 
Officials about status quo being maintained, the Nationa- 
lists should begin their opposition from the election of 
the President. For the retrogression of the Congress 
was a serious step, not to be decided upon by a bare 
accidental majority of any party either in the Subjects' 
Committee or in the whole Congress as then constitu- 
ted, and the usual acceptance of the President would 
have under such circumstances greatly weakened the 
point and force of the opposition. No kind of intima- 
tion was received from Lala Lajpat Rai on the night 
of the 25th, or the morning of the 26th December re- 
garding the proposal of a joint Committee of reconcili- 
ation proposed by him, nor was a copy of the draft reso- 
lutions supplied to Mr. Tilak or any delegates to enable 
them to judge if sliding back from the old position was 
really intended. 



TILAK AND THE CONGRESS — II 169 

On the morning of the 26th December, Mr. Tilak and 
the other Nationalist leaders went to Babu Surendra- 
Nath Banerjea at his residence, and informed him that 
the Nationalist opposition to the election of the Presi- 
dent would be withdrawn if (i) the Nationalist Party 
were assured that the Status quo would not be disturbed, 
and (2) if some graceful allusion was made by any one 
of the speakers on the resolution about the election of 
the President, to the desire of the public to have Lala 
Lajpat Rai in the chair. Mr. Bannerjea agreed to the 
latter proposal as he said he was himself to second the 
resolution ; while as regards the first, though he gave 
an assurance foi himself and Bengal, he asked Mr. 
Tilak to see Mr. Gokhale or Mr. Malvi, the Chairman of 
the Reception Committee. A volunteer was accord- 
ingly sent in a carriage to invite Mr. Malvi to Mr. Ban- 
erjea's residence, but the volunteer brought a reply 
that Mr. Malvi had no time to come as he was engaged 
in religious practices. Mr. Tilak then returned to his 
Camp to take his meals as it was already about 11 a.m.; 
but on returning to the Congress Pandal one hour later, 
he made persistent attempts to get access to Mr. Malvi 
but could not find him anywhere. A little before 
2-30 P.M., a word was brought to Mr. Tilak that Mr. 
Malvi was in the President's tent, and Mr. Tilak sent a 
message to him from an adjoining tent asking for a 
short interview. Mr. Malvi replied that he could not 
see Mr. Tilak as the Presidential procession was being 
formed. 

These facts will explain the position of the two par- 
lies, when the Congress commenced its proceedings on 
Thursday the 26th December, at 2-30 P.M. No assur- 



170 LOKAMANYA TILAK 

ance from any responsible official of the Congress about 
the maintenance of the Status quo being obtained, Mr^ 
Tilak sent a slip to Babu Surendranath,initimatingthat 
he should not make the proposed allusion to Lala 
Lajpat Rai in his speech. He also requested Mr. Malvi 
to supply him with a copy of the draft resolutions, if 
ready, and about 3. p.m. he got it, though the reporter 
of the Advocate of India got it on the previous day. 

The Congress opened with the address of Mr. Malvi, 
the Chairman of the Reception Committee. After the 
address was over, Dewan Bahadur Ambalal Sakarlal 
proposed Dr. Ghose to the Chair in a speech, which, 
though evoking occasional cries of dissent, was heard' 
to the end. The declaration by the Dewan Bahadur 
as well as by Mr. Malvi that the proposing and second- 
ing of the resolution to elect the President was only a 
formal matter, led many to believe that it was not im- 
probable that the usual procedure of taking votes on 
the proposition might be dispensed with. And when 
Babu Surendranath, whose rising on the platform 
seems to have reminded many of the Midnapur Con- 
ference where he was instrumental in getting the Na- 
tionalist party headed by Srij. Arabindo Ghose practi- 
cally ejected with Police aid, commenced his speech, 
there was persistent shouting and he was asked to sit 
down. In spite of his numerous efforts, he could not 
go on and so the Session had to be suspended for the 
day. It is unjust to suggest that this hostile demons- 
tration was pre-arranged by the Nationalists as what 
they had decided to do was silently and solidly to vote 
against the election. 

At about 8 P.M., the late Mr. Chunilal Saraya, Mana- 



TILAK AND THE CONGRESS — II 17I 

ger of the Indian Specie Bank and Vice-Chairman of the 
Surat Reception Committee, accompanied by two other 
gentlemen, went in his un-ofhcial Capacity and on his 
own account, to Mr. Tilak and proposed that he intended' 
to arrange for a meeting that night between Mr. Tilak 
and Mr. Gokhale at the residence of a leading Con- 
gressman to settle the diSerences. Mr. Tilak agreed 
and requested Mr. Chunilal if an interview could be 
arranged, to fix the time in consultation with Mr. Gokhale 
adding that he (Mr. Tilak) would be glad to be present 
at the place of the interview at any hour of the night. 
Thereupon, Mr. Chunilal left Mr. Tilak, but no word 
from him was received by the latter that night. 

On the morning of Friday the 27th, (iia.m.) Mr. 
Chunilal Saraya again saw Mr. Tilak and requested him 
to go in company with Mr. Khaparde to Prof. Gaj jar's 
bungalow near the Congress pandal where, by appoint- 
ment, they were to meet Dr. Rutherford, M.P., who 
was trying for a reconciliation. Messrs. Tilak and 
Khaparde went to Prof. Gaj jar's, but Dr. Rutherford 
could not come there owing to other engagements. 
Mr. Tilak then decided, as no settlement was arrived 
at privately owing to every leading Congressman 
being unwilling to take am^ responsibility in the 
matter upon himself, to propose that the business of the 
election of the President should be adjourned and a 
Committee of one leading Moderate and one leading 
Nationalist from each Congress Province wdth Dr. 
Rutherford's name added, be appointed to consider and 
settle the differences existing between the two parties, 
both of which should accept the Committee's decision 
as final and then proceed to the unanimous election of 



172 LOKAMANYA TILAK 

the President. Prof. Gajjar and Mr. Chunilal under- 
took to convey the proposal to Sir P. M. Mehta or Dr. 
Rutherford in the Congress Camp ; after half an hour 
they returned and told Messrs. Tilak and Khaparde 
that nothing could be done in the matter. 

It was about 12-30 at this time and on the receipt of 
the above reply, Mr. Tilak wrote the following note to 
Mr Malvi, Chairman of the Reception Committee : — 

Sir, — I wish to address the delegates on the proposal 
of the election of the President after it is seconded. I 
wish to move an adjournment with a constructive 
proposal. Please announce me. 

Yours Sincerely, 
B. G. TILAK. 
Deccan Delegate {Poona). 
The proceedings of the day commenced at i P.M., 
when Babu Surendranath was called upon to resume 
Ms speech seconding the election of the President. 
Babu Surendranath was calmly heard by all and he 
duly finished his speech. As Mr. Tilak got no reply to 
his note, he sent a reminder. Still Mr. Malvi was 
silent. Mr. Tilak, therefore, proceeded to go up the 
platform immediately after Babu Surendranath. But 
he was held back by a Volunteer. Mr. Tilak, however, 
asserted his right to go up and succeeded in getting 
to the platform just when Dr. Ghose was moving to 
take the President's chair. It is not true that " by 
the time Mr. Tilak came upon the platform and 
stood in front of the President, the motion of the 
election of Dr. Ghose had been passed." As Mr. Tilak 
stood up on the platform he was greeted with shouts of 



TILAK AND THE CONGRESS — II I73 

disapproval from the members of the Reception Com- 
mittee on the platform and the cry was taken up by 
other Moderates. Mr. Tilak repeatedly insisted upon 
his right of addressing the delegates and told Dr. Ghose 
when he attempted to interfere that he was not pro- 
perly elected. Mr. Malvi said that he had ruled Mr. 
Tilak'samendmentoutof order, to which Mr. Tilak replied 
that the ruling, if any, was wrong and that he had a 
right to appeal to the delegates on the same. By this 
time, there was a general uproar in the Pandal, the 
Moderates shouting at Mr. Tilak and asking him to 
sit down, and the Nationalists demanding that he 
should be heard. At this stage, Dr. Ghose and Mr. 
Malvi said that Mr. Tilak should be removed from the 
platform ; and a young gentleman holding the impor- 
tant office of a Secretary to the Reception Committee 
touched Mr. Tilak 's person with a view to carry out 
the Chairman's order. Mr. Tilak pushed the gentle- 
man aside and again asserted his right of being heard, 
declaring that he would not leave the platform, unless 
bodil}' removed. At this stage, Mr. Gokliale asked the 
above-mentioned gentleman not to touch Mr. Tilak's 
person. But there were others who were seen threat- 
ening an assault on his person, though he was calmly 
standing on the platform facing the delegates with his 
arms folded over his chest. 

It was during this confusion that a shoe, hurled on 
to the platform hit Sir P. M. Mehta on the side of his 
face after touching Babu Surendranath Banerjea, both 
of whom were sitting within a yard of Mr. Tilak on the 
other side of the table. Chairs were now seen being 
lifted to be thrown at Mr. Tilak by persons on and 



174 LOKAMANYA TILAK 

below the platform and some of the Nationalists, there- 
fore, rushed on to the platform to his rescue. Dr. 
Ghose in the meanwhile twice attempted to read his 
address but was stopped by cries of * No, No ' from all 
sides in the Pandal and the confusion became still 
worse. It was now found impossible to arrest the pro- 
gress of disorder and the proceedings were then suspen- 
ded sine die. 

Dr. Ghose's speech, though undelivered in the Con- 
gress Pandal, had been by this time published in the 
Calcutta papers and telegrams from Calcutta, received 
in the evening, showed that in the speech he had made 
an offensive attack on the Nationalist Party. This 
added to the sensation in the Nationalist Camp that 
evening but the situation was not such as to preclude 
all hope of reconciliation. Shrijut Motilal Ghose, Mr. A. 
C. Mitra, Mr. B. C. Chatterjee and Lala Harkisen Lai 
tried their best to bring about a compromise and if 
possible to have the Congress Session revived the next 
day. They went to Mr. Tilak on the night of the 27th 
and the morning of the 28th to ascertain the views of 
his party and to each of them Mr. Tilak gave the fol- 
lowing assurance in writing : — 

SuRAT, 2Sth December, 1907. 

Dear Sir ; — With reference to our conversation and 
principally in the best interests of the Congress, I and 
my party are prepared to waive our opposition to the 
election of Dr. Rash Behari as President of the 
23rd Indian National Congress, and we are prepared 
to act in the spirit of forget and forgive provided, firstly 
the last year's resolutions on Swaraj, Swadeshi, Boycott 
and National Education are adhered to and each ex-

pressly re-afi&rmed, and secondly such passages, if any, 
in Dr. Ghose's speech as may be offensive to the 
Nationalist Party, are omitted." 

Your's etc., 

B. G. TILAK. 

This letter was taken by the gentleman to whom it 
was addressed to the Moderate leaders but no compro- 
mise was arrived at, as the Moderates were all along 
bent upon the retrogression of the Congress at any cost. 
A Convention of the Moderates was, therefore, held, in 
the Pandal, the next day, where the Nationalists were 
not allowed to go, even when some of them were ready 
and offered to sign the declaration required. On the 
other hand, those, who did not wish to go back 
from the position taken up at the Calcutta Congress and 
honestly desired to work further on the same lines, met 
in a separate place the same evening to consider what 
steps might be taken to continue the work of the 
Congress in future. Thus ended the proceedings 
of the 23rd Indian National Congress amidst 
confusion and in bitterness, leaving the parties 
more estranged than ever, thus making easy the 
task of those who were unfriendly to the cause of 
Indian freedom. 

Let us now examine a little minutely Mr. Tilak's 
contention, that the Congress autocrats were bent upon 
a retrograde step by tampering with the four Calcutta 
resolutions, on Swaraj, Swadeshi, Boycott and National 
Education. These resolutions had been unanimously 
accepted at Calcutta after a long and heated discussion 
between the leaders of both the parties. Resolutions 



176 LOKAMANYA TILAK 

like these passed as a compromise between two parties 
could not be altered even in the drafts by any one only 
because that gentleman has been entrusted with the 
work of drafting the Congress Resolutions. At the 
Calcutta Congress (1906) it was resolved that the sys- 
tem of Government obtaining in the Self-Governing 
British Colonies should be extended to India ; at Surat 
though this resolution was almost repeated still this was 
set up as the ultimate goal, evidently meaning that it 
was to be considered as out of the pale of practical 
politics. What offended the Nationalists still more 
was the draft constitution of the Congress in which the 
goal of the Congress was defined as follows : — 

'* The Indian National Congress has for its ultimate 
goal the attainment by India of self-government 
similar to that enjoyed by other members of the 
British Empire * * *. It seeks to advance towards- 
this goal b}^ strictly constitutional means, by 
bringing about a steady reform of the existing 
system of administration * * *." 
So then, the reform of the existing system of adminis- 
tration and not its gradual replacement by a popular 
system v<^as to be the immediate object of the Congress. 
The sting of this seemingly innocent constitution lay 
in the fact that it sought to convert the National Con- 
gress into a party organisation. As the acceptance of 
this creed was the condition of the membership of the 
Congress, the Bengal ' Extremists ' who had repudiated 
the ideal of Colonial Self-Government were to be shut 
out of the Congress. When the goal of the Bengal 
* Extremists * viz, " Independence (absolute autonomy) 
by peaceful means" was declared perfectly legal not 



TILAK AND THE CONGRESS — II V]f 

only by the Law Courts* of Bengal but also by Lord 
Morley, what right had the Moderates to shut out an 
important and law-abiding section of Indian poli- 
ticians from the Congress ? Mr. Tilak has been 
often blamed for " coquetting with the views 
of the Bengal School of Extremist politicians " — 
these are Mr. Gokhale's words — but though four 
or five times at the most, in 1907-08 he has defended 
the ideal of his Bengal colleagues and followers y 
still he has consistently preached the ideal set up by 
Dadabhai Naoroji. If this is to be called inconsistency, 
what shaU we say of those who at Calcutta accepted 
without demur the National Education Resolution, and 
who at the very next Provincial Conference at Surat 
declared that they did not understand what National 
Education meant ? 

The draft resolution about the ' Swadeshi movement * 
did not contain the words * even at a sacrifice.' Mr. 
Gokhale later explained that this omission was * unin- 
tentional ' and we readily accept his word but the effect 
of this omission was that the very soul of the resolution 
was taken out. 

Mr. Gokhale has admitted that the changes made by 
him in the Boycott resolution were intentional. He 

* As late as 1909, Mr. Beachcroft, the Judge who tried Srj. 
Arabindo Ghose and the Maniktola conspirators in the Ahpore 
Bomb Case wrote in his judgment " Independence is an ideal 
with which no true Englishman would quarrel." This judicial 
pronouncement was specially significant in view of the fact that 
Srj. C. R. Das, Counsel for Srj . Arabindo Ghose had repeatedly 
declared on behalf of his client that if preaching independence 
was a crime, Srj. Ghose was willing to suffer any punishment 
that might be awarded to him.

declared that they were rendered necessasy by the 
unfair and unjustifiable attempt made by Bapu Bepin 
Chunder Pal from the Congress platform in 1906 and 
by Mr. Tilak and others in the Press throughout 
1907, to construe the phraseology employed in the 
Calcutta resolution as approving Boycott of all forms 
of association with the Government. Now, what 
is the exact wording of the Calcutta resolution ? 
After recounting the reasons, the Congress declared 
that " the Boycott movement inaugurated in Bengal 
was and is justifiable." Mr. Gokhale in his draft 
resolution changed the wording from *' Boycott 
movement " to the " Boycott of foreign (British) 
goods." As Babu Bepin Chunder Pal said " We in 
Eastern Bengal and Assam have not only tried to 
boycott British goods , but all honorary offices and 
association with Government " and the words' 1" Boy- 
cott Movement" were comprehensive enough to include 
these phases of Boycott while the wording adopted by 
Mr, Gokhale was evidently narrow. 

Regarding the last resolution, the Calcutta Congress 
said " the time has arrived for the people earnestly to 
take up the question of National Education * * and to 
organise a system of education * * on National lines 
and under National control." Mr. Gokhale's draft 
concluded with the words " organize an indepen(^ent 
system of education," thus leaving the very vital words 
" on National lines and under National control." Mr. 
Gokhale might have thought that verbal changes were 
made here and there to remove ambiguity or to improve 
the phraseology. Is it not, however, wiser to retain a 
phraseology, however defective from the literary stand-

point than endanger the peace and harmony of the 
Congress ? But if these changes were really vital — as 
has been clearly shown — is it not proper to put the 
whole responsibility of the Surat episode on the heads 
of those Congress autocrats who, for the sake of a petty 
scheme of administrative reforms were willing to dis» 
card the friendship of their political colleagues and 
create a situation which made it easy for the Bureau* 
cracy to " make short work of the Extremists "?
