## LVII

BROOKLYN,  
*28th Dec., 1894.*

DEAR MRS. BULL,

I arrived safely in New York where Landsberg met me at the depot. I
proceeded at once to Brooklyn where I arrived in time.

We had a nice evening. Several gentlemen belonging to the Ethical
Culture Society came to see me.

Next Sunday we shall have a lecture. Dr. Janes was as usual very kind
and good, and Mr. Higgins is as practical as ever. Here alone in New
York I find more men interested in religion than in any other city, and
do not know why here the interest is more amongst men than women. . . .

Herewith I send a copy of that pamphlet Mr. Higgins has published about
me. Hope to send more in the future.

With my love to Miss Farmer and all the holy family,

I remain yours obediently,

VIVEKANANDA.
