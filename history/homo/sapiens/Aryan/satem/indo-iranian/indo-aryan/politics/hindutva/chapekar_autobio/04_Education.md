## WE TOOK TO KIRTAN AS A PROFESSION
Thus our company being composed only of the members of our family, who were zealous in
promoting the common interest, was now much admired by the public. It is now about twelve years
since we adopted the performance of kathas as our permanent profession. Each one of us has now
become perfectly proficient in the art. Everywhere praises are showered on our musical
performance and on the excellence of our father's kirtan. Now at last, some people on hearing my
father's kirtan remember the late Trimbakboa of Nasik. As our profession was not like that of a
vendor who can sell his goods while permanently residing at any one place, my father's good
company opened up to me two principal means of acquiring knowledge, namely, a constant hearing
of kirtans and travelling over the country. A poet has truly said, " By travelling in (different) countries
a man gains the friendship of scholars, admittance into assemblies, knowledge of scientific books
and great astuteness." It is immaterial even if one keeps a stall, provided it be for selling flowers.
Accordingly, though we followed the profession of performing kirtans as a means of earning our
livelihood, I derived from it the benefit of hearing
God's name (recited) and also all the benefits enumerated in the verse quoted above. Travelling
over the country, hearing bon-mots, witnessing darbars held by great princes, seeing assemblies of
eminent scholars, visiting holy shrines and deitiesâ€”these and several other benefits were derived
by me without any trouble, for which I am greatly indebted to my father and chiefly to the Almighty
who is the regulator of the universe.+++(5)+++ Compared with all the benefits mentioned above, the ever-
lasting benefit of knowledge is indeed unique. The idea that true knowledge can be acquired by
study or by attending a school or by passing two or three examinations is, in my opinion, entirely
erroneous.+++(5)+++ I have come across the following verse which corroborates the above assertion made by
me : " Fools remain fools even after studying the sciences."+++(5)+++ That man is learned indeed who
performs the various duties prescribed by the Shastras. I have seen hundreds, nay thousands, of
learned men who, though proficient in more sciences than one, are addicted to evil habits. Of what
use is their learning ? Fie upon their learning and their study ! That man alone is learned who
performs the duties laid down in the Shastras.

## I RECEIVED VERY MEAGRE EDUCATION
As I was obliged to be constantly travelling, I had no opportunity of attending any school and
acquiring proficiency in English. I, however, learnt the first two English standards in the New English
School, Poona. So strange is the influence of the study of English that if one simply intends to learn
that language, or if a child learns by heart only the first two or three letters of its alphabet, he begins
at once to look upon his elders as fools and despises his good and ancient religion.+++(5)+++ If the mere
odour of English education has this effect, where is the wonder if any righteous person who fully
tastes it should turn an Englishman from top to toe and an earnest votary of the bottle ? The only
matter for congratulation is that in spite of my study of English, limited though it was, no change
whatever took place in my temper by the grace of God.+++(5)+++ It is very gratifying to me to say this. I am
convinced that though I were to learn English to any extent, or read any number of books in that
language, or hear any number of lectures or mix (with Englishmen) to any extent, I shall never be
imbued with any ideas inconsistent in the slightest degree with our ancient religion which has
(almost) ceased to be followed. May God (enable me to) stick to my resolution as long as I live ! I
attended school for a very few days, that is to say, scarcely for seven or eight months. I was in the
third standard class in the New Marathi School (Poona) for four months. I studied Marathi only up to
the third standard.. My father had taught me the First English Book at home. I studied the Second
Book for four months in the New English School, but having in the mean time imbibed a dislike for
the English language left off studying it. The fact of being always on the move also interfered with
my regular attendance at the school. But, in my opinion, this was not the true impediment which
came in the way of my education. Everybody said to my father, " Since the time you took your son
into this profession (of yours), his studies have been seriously interfered with. Do your best to send
him to school." How great is the delusion under which men labour ! Neither travel nor this profession
can come in the way of one who has made up his mind to educate himself. A little consideration (will
make it evident) that as that performance took up (only) three hours of our time at night and as that
performance did not take place every day, there was ample time for one who was bent upon study.
Now take travelling. It is absurd to allege that travelling interferes with one's education, because a
school is not the only place for acquiring knowledge. Had I the inclination to prosecute my studies,
my revered father, who is well versed in English, Marathi and Sanskrit languages, would have
willingly taught both myself and my brother.+++(4)+++ In short, the dislike for that kind of education on the part
of my brother and myself was the chief reason (why we remained ignorant).

My father wished to teach us a profession that would enable us to earn our livelihood in
independence, that is to say, without nattering other people. He does not desire that we should earn
our living by becoming proficient as kirtan-performers, nor do we wish to follow that vocation, as
neither of us entertains any regard for it. I, however, admit that there is nothing so interesting as a kirtan.

## STUDY OF MEDICINES
Our father, therefore, after fully considering the matter, commenced to teach us medicine.
This profession can, without any objection, be regarded as an independent one. Because every
sufferer from colic or any other malady must need seek (the help of) a physician. There is scarcely
any other profession which can, like this one, be practised without leaving one's home. A poet
speaks about this profession as follows ; " Gandhari becomes fruitful for the time being (but) the
astrologer and the physician earn money without intermission." For some days we vigorously
prosecuted our studies in the science which our father had after (due) consideration begun to teach
us. We learnt by rote about 500 shlokas from medical works. We also finished Amarkosha, Rupavali
and some cantos from Raghuvamsha. I was about 13 or 14 years of age at this time. Our father
tried his utmost to make us proficient in the science. 

Men are, however, during their early days
careless and free from anxiety (as to the future) and so they do not at all understand the value of
education. We too possessed this characteristic to a large extent. But apart from this, there was
another cause in operation which, besides retarding our studies, deviated our attention completely
from these matters, which, whether good or otherwise from our point of view, enable a man to
acquire fame in these days. Even though that cause is of a most secret character, I mean to make a
fearless statement about it in this place as it has prompted me to write this autobiography, and also
to mention the events to which it has given rise from time to time. That Almighty, who is the
supporting pillar of our Aryan religion, and whom we always implore by repeating His innumerable
epithets and who from time to time takes a new birth (to regenerate) the decaying Hindu Religion.
