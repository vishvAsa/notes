*To Miss Mary Hale*

C/O. MRS. BAGLEY,  
ANNISQUAM,  
*31st August, 1894*.

DEAR SISTER,

The letter from the Madras people was published in yesterday's *Boston
Transcript*. I hope to send you a copy. You may have seen it in some
Chicago paper. I am sure there is some mail for me at Cook & Sons â€” I
shall be here till Tuesday next at least, on which day I am going to
lecture here in Annisquam.

Kindly inquire at Cook's for my mail and send it over at Annisquam.

I had no news of you for some time. I sent two pictures to Mother Church
yesterday and hope you will like them. I am very anxious about the
Indian mail. With love for all, I am your ever affectionate brother, 

VIVEKANANDA.

  
PS. As I do not know where you are I could not send something else which
I have to send over to you. 

V.
