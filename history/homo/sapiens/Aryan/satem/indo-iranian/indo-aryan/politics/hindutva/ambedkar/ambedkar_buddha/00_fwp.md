> EDITOR'S INTRODUCTION  
> 
>
> by Frances W. Pritchett, Columbia University  
> 
>
> The source of the text for this electronic version was: **Dr.
> Babasaheb Ambedkar: Writings and Speeches, Vol. 11** (Bombay:
> Education Department, Government of Maharashtra, 1992). Our site also
> makes available, from the same series, [Vol. 11 Supplement: Pali and
> Other Sources of The Buddha & His Dhamma with an
> Index](sources/index.html), by Vasant Moon. The original publication
> was by Siddharth College Publications, Bombay, in 1957.
>
> This electronic version has retained every word of the source text.
> Only the most obvious typos have been corrected. Punctuation, however,
> has not only been corrected where it was faulty, but has also
> sometimes been rearranged for greater ease of reading. Every word
> added by the editor is contained within square brackets. Only a small
> amount of standardization of spelling for a few key terms has been
> imposed: for example, where Dr. Ambedkar sometimes has "Gautama" and
> sometimes "Gotama" for the name of the Buddha, the former has been
> used throughout.
>
> This very light editing means that many obvious errors of all kinds
> remain: for example, "It is he at whom the people are gazing at."
> \[I,2,2,3\]. Sometimes "you" and "thou" forms have been used in the
> same sentence. Sometimes the grammar shifts midway in a sentence, so
> that it doesn't work properly. These and many other small problems
> have not been fixed. Apart from one or two words, spelling of Pali
> terms has not been normalized, though it changes considerably from one
> part of the book to another. Word choice also changes: "bhikkhus,"
> "monks," and "alms-men" all occur, as Dr. Ambedkar incorporates the
> language of different translations of different texts.
>
> The reader should remember that Dr. Ambedkar compiled this book in
> haste, during the last years of his life, when he was chronically ill
> and also very busy. It was published posthumously.
>
> This has been a fascinating text to work with. In places, it is
> eloquent and tremendously moving. If it is uneven, that is hardly
> surprising. It remains a testament to its author's love not only for
> the figure of the Buddha, but for social justice, humane values, and a
> clear-eyed honesty in looking at life.

>
> Image sources:
>
> The Great Stupa at Sarnath has been adopted as the image source for
> this ebook. Here is where the particular images come from:
