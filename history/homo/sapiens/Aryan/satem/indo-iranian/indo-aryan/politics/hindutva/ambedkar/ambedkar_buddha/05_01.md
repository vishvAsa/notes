> § 1. The Sangh and its Organisation
>
>  1. The followers of the Blessed Lord were divided into two
> classes: Bhikkhus, and Lay Followers called Upasakas.  
>  2. The Bhikkhus were organised into a Sangh, while the Upasakas
> were not.  
>  3. The Buddhist Bhikkhu is primarily a Parivrajaka. This
> institution of Parivrajaka is older than that of the Buddhist
> Bhikkhu.  
>  4. The old Parivrajakas were persons who had abandoned family
> life, and were a mere floating body of wanderers.  
>  5. They roamed about with a view to ascertain the truth by coming
> into contact with various teachers and philosophers, listening to
> their discourses, entering into discussion on matters of ethics,
> philosophy, nature, mysticism, etc.  
>  6. Some of the old type of Parivrajakas lived under a teacher
> until they found another. Others lived singly, without acknowledging
> any master.  
>  7. Among these older type of Parivrajakas there were also women
> wanderers. The female Parivrajakas sometimes lived with men
> Parivrajakas; sometimes they lived alone and by themselves.  
>  8. These old type of Parivrajakas had no Sangh, had no rules of
> discipline, and had no ideal to strive for.  
>  9. It was for the first time that the Blessed Lord organised his
> followers into a Sangh or fraternity, and gave them rules of
> discipline, and set before them an ideal to pursue and realise.
>
>   
> §2. Admission to the Sangh
>
>  1. The Sangh was open to all.  
>  2. There was no bar of caste.  
>  3. There was no bar of sex.  
>  4. There was no bar of status.  
>  5. Caste had no place in the Sangh.  
>  6. Social status had no place in the Sangh.  
>  7. Inside the Sangh all were equal.  
>  8. Inside the Sangh, rank was regulated by worth and not by
> birth.  
>  9. As the Blessed Lord said, the Sangh was like the ocean, and the
> Bhikkhus were like the rivers that fell into the ocean.  
>  10. The river has its separate name and separate existence.  
>  11. But once the river entered the ocean, it lost its separate
> name and separate existence.  
>  12. It becomes one with the rest.  
>  13. Same is the case with the Sangh. When a Bhikkhu entered the
> Sangh, he became one with the rest, like the water of the ocean.  
>  14. He lost his caste. He lost his status; so said the Lord.  
>  15. The only distinction observed inside the Sangh was that of
> sex. The Bhikkhu Sangh was separate in its organisation from the
> Bhikkhuni Sangh.  
>  16. The entrants into the Sangh were divided into two classes:
> Shramaneras and Bhikkhus.  
>  17. Anyone below twenty could become a Shramanera.  
>  18. By taking the trisaranas and by taking the ten precepts, a boy
> becomes a Shramanera.  
>  19. "I follow the Buddha; I follow the Dhamma; and I follow the
> Sangh"—are the Trisaranas.  
>  20. "I shall abstain from killing; I shall not commit theft; I
> shall follow Brahmacharya; I shall not tell \[an\] untruth; I shall
> abstain from drink."  
>  21. "I shall abstain from taking food at an untimely hour; I shall
> abstain from indecent and immoral acts; I shall abstain from
> ornamenting and decorating myself; I shall abstain from luxuries; I
> shall abstain from the love of gold and silver."  
>  22. These are the ten precepts.  
>  23. A Shramanera can leave the Sangh at any time and become a
> layman. A Shramanera is attached \[to a\] Bhikkhu, and spends his time
> in the service of the Bhikkhu. He is not a person who has taken
> Parivraja.  
>  24. The status of a Bhikkhu has to be reached in two stages. The
> first stage is called Parivraja, and the second stage is called
> Upasampada. It is after Upasampada that he becomes a Bhikkhu.  
>  25. A candidate who wishes to take Parivraja, with a view
> ultimately to become a Bhikkhu, has to seek a Bhikkhu who has the
> right to act as an Uppadhya. A Bhikkhu can become an Uppadhya only
> after he has spent at least ten years as a Bhikkhu.  
>  26. Such a candidate, if accepted by the Uppadhya, is called a
> Parivrajaka, and has to remain in the service and tutelage of the
> Uppadhya.  
>  27. After the period of tutelage ends, it is his Uppadhya who has
> to propose the name of his student to a meeting of the Sangh specially
> called for the purpose, for Upasampada; and the student must request
> the Sangh for Upasampada.  
>  28. The Sangh must be satisfied that he is a fit and a proper
> person to be made a Bhikkhu. For this purpose, there is a set of
> questions which the candidate has to answer.  
>  29. Only when the Sangh grants permission, that Upasampada is
> granted and the person becomes a Bhikkhu.  
>  30. The rules regulating entry into the Bhikkhuni Sangh are more
> or less the same as the rules regulating the entry into the Bhikkhu
> Sangh.
>
>   
> § 3. The Bhikkhu and His Vows
>
>  1. A layman or a Shramanera takes precepts. His obligation is to
> follow them.  
>  2. A Bhikkhu, besides taking precepts, takes them also as vows
> which he must not break. If he breaks them, he becomes liable to
> punishment.  
>  3. A Bhikkhu vows to remain celebate.  
>  4. A Bhikkhu vows not to commit theft.  
>  5. A Bhikkhu vows not to boast.  
>  6. A Bhikkhu vows not to kill or take life.  
>  7. A Bhikkhu vows not to own anything except what the rules
> allow.  
>  8. No Bhikkhu is to possess more than the following eight
> articles:—
>
> > \(1\) Three pieces of cloth to cover his body:(i) \[a\] lower
> > garment called Antarvaska; (ii) \[an\] upper garment called
> > Uttarasang; (iii) \[a\] covering garment against cold called
> > Sanghati.  
> > (2) A girdle for the loins.  
> > (3) An alms-bowl.  
> > (4) A razor.  
> > (5) A needle.  
> > (6) A water-strainer.
>
>  9. A Bhikkhu takes the vow of poverty. He must beg for his food.
> He must live on alms. He must sustain himself only on one meal a day.
> Where there is no Vihar built for the Sangh, he must live under a
> tree.  
>  10. A Bhikkhu does not take a vow of obedience. Outward respect
> and courtesy to his superiors is expected from the novice. His own
> salvation and his usefulness as a teacher depend on his self-culture.
> He is to obey not his superior, but the Dhamma. His superior has no
> supernatural gift of wisdom or of absolution. He must stand or fall by
> himself. For that he must have freedom of thought.  
>  11. Any breach of a vow taken by a Bhikkhu results in an offence
> of Parajika. The punishment for Parajika is expulsion from the Sangh.
>
>   
> § 4. The Bhikkhu and Ecclesiastical Offences
>
>  1. Any breach of the vows taken by a Bhikkhu is an offence against
> the Dhamma.  
>  2. In addition to these offences, there were certain other
> offences to which he was also liable. They were called Sanghadisesa,
> "ecclesiastical offences."  
>  3. The list of such offences included in the Vinaya Pitaka are
> thirteen.  
>  4. They are allied to the Parajika.
>
>   
> § 5. The Bhikkhu and Restraints
>
>  1. Besides sailing \[=steering\] clear of offences, a Bhikkhu must
> observe certain restrictions, and cannot be as free as others.  
>  2. One set of such restrictions are called Nissagiya-pacittiya. It
> contains 26 restrictions to be observed by the Bhikkhu.  
>  3. They relate to accepting gifts of robes, woollen mats, bowls,
> and medical requisites.  
>  4. They also relate to the acceptance of gold and silver, \[and\]
> engagement of a monk in buying and selling, and appropriation of
> property given to the Sangh to himself.  
>  5. The punishment for \[a\] breach of these restrictions is
> restoration (nissagiya) and expression of repentance (pacittiya).  
>  6. Besides these restrictions there are other restrictions which a
> Bhikkhu has to observe. They are called pacittiya. They number
> ninety-two.
>
>   
> § 6. The Bhikkhu and Good Conduct Rules
>
>  1. A Bhikkhu must behave well. He should be a model person in his
> mode and manner of behaviour.  
>  2. In order to secure this purpose, the Blessed Lord framed a
> number of Conduct Rules.  
>  3. These Good Conduct Rules were called Sekhiya Dhamma. They
> number seventy-five.
>
>   
> § 7. The Bhikkhu and the Trial of Offences
>
>  1. The enactment of these acts and omissions were \[=was\] not a
> mere formality. They were legal in substance, involving a definite
> charge, trial, and punishment.  
>  2. No Bhikkhu could be punished without a trial by a regularly
> constituted Court.  
>  3. The Court was to be constituted by the Bhikkhus resident at the
> place where an offence had taken place.  
>  4. No trial could take place without a proper number of Bhikkhus
> required to constitute a Court.  
>  5. No trial would be legal without a definite charge.  
>  6. No trial could be legal if it did not take place in the
> presence of the accused.  
>  7. No trial could be legal if the accused had not been given the
> fullest opportunity to defend himself.  
>  8. The following punishments could be awarded against a guilty
> Bhikkhu: (i) Tarjaniya Karma (warn and discharge); (ii) Niyasha Karma
> (declaring insane); (iii) Pravrajniya Karma (expulsion from the
> Sangh); (iv) Utskhepniya Karma (boycott); (v) Parivasa Karma
> (expulsion from Vihar).  
>  9. Expulsion may be followed by abbana karma. Abbana Karma means
> annulment of dismemberment \[=expulsion\]. It may be followed after
> granting of pardon granted by the Sangh, after being satisfied with
> the proper performance of Parivasa Karma.
>
>   
> § 8. The Bhikkhu and Confession
>
>  1. The most original and unique institution created by the Blessed
> Lord in connection with the organisation of the Bhikkhus was the
> introduction of Confession, called uposath.  
>  2. The Blessed Lord realized that it was possible to enforce what
> he had laid down as offences. But he had laid down certain
> restrictions which were not offences. He said that the restrictions
> were most intimately connected with building up of character and
> maintaining character; and that there was equal necessity to see that
> they were observed.  
>  3. But the Lord could find no effective way of enforcing them. He
> therefore thought of Confession in open \[=public\] as a means of
> organising the Bhikkhu's conscience and making it act as a sentinel to
> guard him against taking a wrong or false step.  
>  4. The Confession was confined to the transgressions of
> restrictions (which were called Patimokha).  
>  5. For a Confession there was to be a meeting of the Bhikkhus of a
> given locality. There were to be three such meetings in a fortnight,
> one each on chaturdashi, panchadasi, and ashatam; on that day, the
> Bhikkhus may fast. That is why the day is also called uposath.  
>  6. At the meeting a Bhikkhu reads the restrictions, one by one,
> contained in the Patimokha. After reading a restriction, he says to
> the assembled Bhikkhus, "I take it that none of you have transgressed
> this Rule, that is why you are silent." He says this three times. Then
> \[he\] deals with the next restriction.  
>  7. A similar Confessional meeting is required of the Bhikhhuni
> Sangh.  
>  8. On a Confession a charge and trial may follow.  
>  9. On a failure to Confess, any Bhikkhu may report a
> transgression, if he was a witness to it; and then a charge and trial
> may follow.
