> § 1. Meditation for New Light
>
>  1. Having refreshed himself with food, Gautama sat thinking over
> his past experiences. He realised that all paths had failed.  
>  2. The failure was so complete that it could have led anyone into
> a state of frustration. He was, of course, sorry. But frustration as
> such did not touch him.  
>  3. He was always hopeful of finding a way. So much so that on the
> night of the day on which he partook of the food sent by Sujata,
> Gautama had five dreams, and when he awoke he interpreted his dreams
> to mean that he was sure to attain enlightenment.  
>  4. He had also tried to forecast his future. This he did by
> throwing the bowl of food Sujata's maid brought, into the river
> Nairanja, saying, "If I am to have enlightenment let the bowl ascend
> the stream; if not, let it go down." The vessel, indeed, began to
> float against the current and at last sank near the abode of Kala, a
> Naga king.  
>  5. Fortified with hope and determination, he left Uruvela and
> towards evening went along the wide road to Gaya. There he saw a
> Banyan Tree. He thought of sitting under it in meditation, in the hope
> of a new light dawning upon him and enabling him to find a way which
> would solve his problem.  
>  6. After trying each of the four directions he chose the East,
> which is always chosen by all the great sages for the removal of all
> defilements.  
>  7. Gautama sat down cross-legged and upright under the Banyan
> Tree. Determined to achieve enlightenment, he said to himself, "Skin,
> sinew and bone may dry up as they will, my flesh and blood may dry in
> my body, but without attaining complete enlightenment I will not leave
> this seat."  
>  8. Then Kala, the king of the Nagas, whose majesty was like the
> lord of elephants, and his wife Suvarnaprabhasa, having been awakened
> by the vision of Gautama sitting under the Banyan Tree, uttered this
> in praise of him, being sure that he was destined to attain perfect
> knowledge.  
>  9. "Inasmuch as the earth, pressed down by thy feet, O Sage,
> resounds repeatedly, and inasmuch as thy splendour shines forth like
> the sun, thou shalt assuredly reap the desired fruit.  
>  10. "Inasmuch as flocks of birds fluttering in the sky offer thee
> reverential salutation, O Lotus-eyed One; and inasmuch as gentle
> breezes blow in the sky, thou shalt certainly attain thy object."  
>  11. As he sat down for meditation, a crowd of evil thoughts and
> evil passions--mythologically called the children of Mara (Kama),
> which is another name for evil passions--entered his mind.  
>  12. Gautama was greatly frightened lest they should overpower him
> and defeat his purpose.  
>  13. He knew that in this battle with evil passions many Rishis and
> Brahmins had succumbed.  
>  14. So he summoned all the courage he had and said to Mara, "Faith
> is found in me, and heroism and wisdom. How can ye evil passions
> defeat me? The streams even of rivers may this wind dry up. Ye would
> be unable to dry up my resolutions, when I am so intent. Better to me
> is death in battle than that I should be defeated in life."  
>  15. The evil passions entered the mind of Gautama as a crow goes
> after a stone that looks like a hump of fat, thinking surely, "here I
> shall find a tender morsel, here perchance is something sweet."  
>  16. And finding no sweetness there, the crow departs thence. So
> like a crow attacking a rock, the evil passions left Gautama in
> disgust.
>
>   
> §2. Enlightenment
>
>  1. To feed himself during the period of meditation, Gautama had
> collected enough food to last him for forty days.  
>  2. Having routed the evil thoughts that disturbed his mind,
> Gautama refreshed himself with food and gained strength. He thus
> prepared himself for meditation with the aim of obtaining
> enlightenment.  
>  3. It took Gautama four weeks of meditation to obtain
> enlightenment. He reached final enlightenment in four stages.  
>  4. In the first stage he called forth reason and investigation.
> His seclusion helped him to attain it easily.  
>  5. In the second stage he added concentration.  
>  6. In the third stage he brought to his aid equanimity and
> mindfulness.  
>  7. In the fourth and final stage he added purity to equanimity and
> equanimity to mindfulness.  
>  8. Thus with mind concentrated, purified, spotless, with
> defilement gone, supple, dexterous, firm, impassionate
> \[=dispassionate\], not forgetting what he is \[=was\] after, Gautama
> concentrated himself on the problem of finding an answer to the
> question which had troubled him.  
>  9. On the night of the last day of the fourth week, light dawned
> upon him. He realised that there were two problems. The first problem
> was that there was suffering in the world, and the second problem was
> how to remove this suffering and make mankind happy.  
>  10. So in the end, after meditation for four weeks, darkness was
> dispelled, light arose, ignorance was dispelled and knowledge arose.
> He saw a new way.
>
>   
> § 3. The Discovery of a New Dhamma
>
>  1. Gautama, when he sat in meditation for getting new light, was
> greatly in the grip of the Sankhya Philosophy.  
>  2. That suffering and unhappiness \[were\] in the world, he
> thought was an incontrovertible fact.  
>  3. Gautama was, however, interested in knowing how to do away with
> suffering. This problem the Sankhya Philosophy did not deal with.  
>  4. It is, therefore, on this problem--how to remove suffering and
> unhappiness--that he concentrated his mind.  
>  5. Naturally, the first question he asked himself was--"What are
> the causes of \[the\] suffering and unhappiness which an individual
> undergoes?"  
>  6. His second question was--"How to remove unhappiness?"  
>  7. To both these questions he got a right answer, which is called
> '*Samma Bodhi*' (Right Enlightenment).  
>  8. It is because of this that the Banyan Tree has come to be known
> as the Bodhi Tree.
>
>   
> § 4. Gautama who was a Bodhisatta, After Sammabodhi Becomes a Buddha
>
>  1. Before enlightenment Gautama was only a Bodhisatta. It is after
> reaching enlightenment that he became a Buddha.  
>  2. Who and what is a Bodhisatta?  
>  3. A Bodhisatta is a person who is seeking to be a Buddha.  
>  4. How does a Bodhisatta become a Buddha?  
>  5. A Bodhisatta must be a Bodhisatta for ten lives in succession.
> What must a Bodhisatta do in order to qualify himself to become a
> Buddha?  
>  6. In his first life he acquires Mudita (joy). The Bodhisatta,
> having blown off his impurities as the smith blows the dross from
> silver, reflects that man who has been reckless and becomes sober
> brightens up the world like the moon freed from clouds. Joy springs up
> in him, realising this, and he is fervent in his desire to benefit all
> beings.  
>  7. In his second life he acquires Vimala (Purity). The Bodhisatta
> has now removed all thoughts of lust; he is kind; he is kind to all;
> he neither flatters the vices of men nor disparages their virtues.  
>  8. In his third life he acquires Prabhakari (Brightness). The
> intellect of the Bodhisatta now becomes as bright as a mirror. He
> fully knows and grasps the truths of Anatta and Anicca. His only wish
> is for the highest wisdom, and for this he is ready to sacrifice
> anything.  
>  9. In his fourth life he acquires Arcishmati (Intelligence of
> Fire). The Bodhisatta in this life fixes his mind on the Eightfold
> Path, the Four Contemplations, the Fourfold Contest, the Fourfold Will
> Power, the Fivefold Morality.  
>  10. In his fifth life he acquires Sudurjaya (Difficult to
> Conquer). He fully understands the connection of the relative and the
> absolute.  
>  11. In his sixth life he becomes Abhimukhi. In this stage the
> Bodhisatta is now prepared fully to grasp the evolution of things, its
> cause, the Twelve Nidanas; and this knowledge, called Abhimukhi,
> awakens the most profound compassion in his heart for all beings
> blinded by Avidya.  
>  12. In his seventh life the Bodhisatta becomes a Durangama (going
> far off). The Bodhisatta is now beyond time and space ; he is one with
> Infinity, but he still retains nama-rupa out of his great compassion
> for all beings. He is secluded from others, in that the lusts of the
> world no more cling to him than water to a lotus leaf. He quenches
> desires in his fellow beings, practices charity, patience,
> tactfulness, energy, calmness, intelligence, and the highest wisdom.  
>  13. While in this life, he knows the Dharma, but presents it in
> ways understood by the people; he knows he must be tactful and
> patient. Whatever men do to him he bears with equanimity, for he knows
> that it is through ignorance \[that\] they misunderstand his motives.
> At the same time he never slackens his energy to benefit all beings,
> nor does he withdraw his mind from wisdom; therefore misfortune can
> never turn him from the righteous path.  
>  14. In his eighth life he becomes Acala. In the stage of Acala, or
> 'immovable,' all strivings on the part of the Bodhisatta cease. He
> follows good spontaneously; whatever he will do he will succeed in.  
>  15. In his ninth life he becomes Sadhumati. This is the stage or
> condition of one who has vanquished and penetrated all dharmas or
> systems, all quarters, and does not enter time.  
>  16. In his tenth life he becomes Dharmamegha. The Bodhisatta
> attains the infinite divine eye of a Buddha.  
>  17. The Bodhisatta acquires these ten powers which are necessary
> for him when he becomes a Buddha.  
>  18. The Bodhisatta must not only acquire these ten powers as he
> evolves from stage to stage, but he must also practice to perfection
> the ten Paramitas.  
>  19. One Paramita is to be the end of one life. Specialisation in
> the Paramitas must go stage by stage. One Paramita in one life and not
> a little of one and a little of the other.  
>  20. It is only when he is doubly equipped that a Bodhisatta
> becomes qualified for becoming a Buddha. The Buddha is a culminating
> point in the life of a Bodhisatta.  
>  21. The theory of the Jatakas or the birth stages of a Bodhisatta
> appears analogous to the Brahmanic theory of Avataras, i.e., the
> theory of incarnations of God.  
>  22. The Jataka theory is based upon the Buddha having the highest
> degree of purity as the essence of his being.  
>  23. The Avatar theory does not require that the God should be pure
> in his making. All that the Brahmanic theory of Avatar says is that
> God saves his followers by taking different forms although the God may
> be very impure and immoral in his conduct.  
>  24. The theory that to be a Bodhisatta for ten lives as a
> condition precedent for becoming a Buddha has no parallel anywhere. No
> other religion calls upon its founder to answer such a test.
