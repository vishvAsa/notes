RESPECTED SIR, (Shri Pramadadas Mitra)

It is several days since I received your last letter. Please excuse the
delay in replying, which was due to some special reasons. I am very ill
at present; there is fever now and then, but there is no disorder in the
spleen or other organs. I am under homeopathic treatment. Now I have had
to give up completely the intention of going to Varanasi. Whatever God
dispenses will happen later on, according to the state of the body. If
you meet brother Jnanananda, please tell him not to be held up there in
expectation of my coming. My going there is very uncertain. My regards
to you and Jnanananda.

Yours sincerely,

VIVEKANANDA.
