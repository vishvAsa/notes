## CLXXVIII

*To Miss Mary Hale*

*30th April, 1900*.

MY DEAR MARY,

Sudden indisposition and fever prevent my starting for Chicago yet. I
will start as soon as I am strong for the journey. I had a letter from
Margot the other day. Give her kindly my love, and know yourself my
eternal love. Where is Harriet? Still in Chicago? And the McKindley
sisters? To all my love.

VIVEKANANDA.
