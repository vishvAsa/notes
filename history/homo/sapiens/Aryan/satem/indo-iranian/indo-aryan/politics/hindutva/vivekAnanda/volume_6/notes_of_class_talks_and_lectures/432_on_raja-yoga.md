## ON RAJA-YOGA

The first stage of Yoga is Yama.

To master Yama five things are necessary:

\(1\) Non-injuring any being by thought, word, and deed.

\(2\) Speaking the truth in thought, word, and deed

\(3\) Non-covetousness in thought, word, and deed.

\(4\) Perfect chastity in thought, word, and deed.

\(5\) Perfect sinlessness in thought, word, and deed.

Holiness is the greatest power. Everything else quails before it.

Then come Âsana, or posture, of a devotee. The seat must be firm, the
head, ribs, and body in a straight line, erect. Say to yourself that you
are firmly seated, and that nothing can move you. Then mention the
perfection of the body, bit by bit, from head to foot. Think of it as
being dear as crystal, and as a perfect vessel to sail over the sea of
life.

Pray to God and to all the prophets and saviours of the world and holy
spirits in the universe to help you.

Then for half an hour practice Prānāyama or the suspending, restraining,
and controlling of the breath, mentally repeating the word Om as you
inhale and exhale the breath. Words charged with spirit have wonderful
power.

The other stages of Yoga are: (1) Pratyāhāra or the restraint of the
organs of sense from all outward things, and directing them entirely to
mental impressions; (2) Dhāranā or steadfast concentration; (3) Dhyāna
or meditation; (4) Samādhi or abstract meditation. It is the highest and
last stage of Yoga. Samadhi is perfect absorption of thought into the
Supreme Spirit, when one realises. "I and my Father are one."

Do one thing at a time and while doing it put your whole soul into it to
the exclusion of all else.
