*To Swami Turiyananda*

SAN FRANCISCO,  
*March, 1900*.

DEAR HARIBHAI,

I have just received a bill of lading from Mrs. Banerji. She has sent
some Dāl (pulses) and rice. I am sending the bill of lading to you. Give
it to Miss Waldo; she will bring all these things when they come.

Next week I am leaving this place for Chicago; thence I go over to New
York. I am getting on somehow. . . . Where are you putting up now? What
are you doing?

Yours affectionately,  
VIVEKANANDA.
