> To me it (i e. The Arctic Home in the Vedas) is significant 
because it appeared in the midst of the author's direst persecution when money reputation, influence and everything were at stake, and few men would have had the courage to spare 
a thought either for sacred books or Arctic Circles.

The scholar in politics is either a remarkable failure or an extraordinary success. In the scholar's 
temperament, hesitency, lack of strong will-power, im- 
patience and petulance usually form the chief mgrcdi- 
ents. His knowledge of men is limited ; his grasp of 
actualities is imperfect. He has no resourcefulness, 
very little courage or presence of mind. His personality is weak and he is very rarely a ruler of men. The 
failure as an administrator of M. Guizot, the celebrated 
philosopher-historian is a striking illustration of the 
danger of appointing men of letters at the helm of 
affairs. Mr. Tilak however was primarily a man of 
action. His wonderful and luminous scholarship and 
his versatile and comprehensive genius formed merely 
the back-ground of a strong-willed, fiery, masterful, 
soldierly personality. His scholarship illuminated his 
political leadership with a lustre as rare as it was dazzling ; his political leadership gave his scholarly work 
a prestige and a significance totally absent in the efforts 
of mere scholars. If a scholar in politics is a rarity, a 
scholar-politician finding his way to gaol is still more so; 
and that, such a man should have lifted his thoughts 
from the chilling atmosphere of gaol-life and the excru- 
ciating pain which inevitably attends it, up to the re- 
gions of ethics and philosophy is, verily a wonder of 
wonders ! 

But this was not the only wonder. Mr. Tilak's every- 
day life was hardly more favourable to literary pur- 
suits than his gaol-life. It was a life of storm and 
stress. It is really surprizing that the din of political 
controversies enabled him to concentrate his mind on 
patient and laborious research. His first work, the 
Orion was planned and written in the midst of Social 
Reform controversies, the legacy of whose acrimony 
still abides ; the Arctic Home in the Vedas was com- 
pleted and published when Mr. Tilak was in the throes 
of a prosecution which was probably intended to strike 
at the very basis of his political and social position. 
It is this peace in the midst of storms and this serenity 
amid misery and obloquy that proves Mr. Tilak's " title 
to something far higher and greater than the honour of 
mere political leadership " or scholarly \visdom. In 
him we recognize '* the stuff of which the saints and 
seers of the race are made." 

Originality and versatility were the characteristics of 
Mr. Tilak's genius. Though he planned writing many 
books, he actually wrote only three — (i) the Orion 
(English) (2) the Arctic Home in the Vedas, (English) 
and (3) The Gila-RaJiasya (Marathi). The theme of each 
is new and arresting. The Orion takes the antiquity of 
the Vedas back to 6000 B.C., a claim which Western 



336 LOKAMANYA TILAK 

scholars have at last grudgingly accepted. The Arctic 
Home proves that the cradle of the Aryans was not the 
Caucasus mountain, but the effulgent region of the North 
Pole. Both these volumes have suggested new view- 
points and have compelled Sanskritists to revise their 
estimates regarding the early history of the Aryan 
race. Mr. Tilak's commentary on the Gita esta- 
blishes a new and convincing theory of Karma-yoga, 
These books are not mere compilations. They strike 
out a novel line of thought and research. The intellect 
of Gokhale and Telang was merely assimilative ; 
that of Tilak and Ranade was original and creative. 
In the Arctic Home, for instance, Mr. Tilak has given 
quite new and extremely convincing interpretations of 
nearly 80 verses in the Rig-veda, besides throwing ample 
light on more than twice the number. It should be 
remembered that these verses had baffled students of 
the Vedas from Sayana of the hoary past to the most 
recent Sanskrit scholar of Europe or America. Nor 
was this all. The Vedic Mythology, hitherto explained 
from Yaska downwards on the Storm or Dawn theory, 
had presented several knotty problems to the end of 
the last century and it was reserved for Mr. Tilak to 
establish the theory of " cosmic circulation of serial 
waters " by means of which the legends of Indra and 
Vritra, of Saptavadhri, of Aditi and her seven flourish- 
ing and one still born son, of Surya's wheel and of 
Dirghatamas, became fully intelligible. These studies 
filled his mind with a thousand and one new and inter- 
esting ideas regarding the evolution of the Hindu 
Religion and Philosophy. He was eager to develop 
these ideas and incorporate them in two or three 



TILAK THE SCHOLAR 337 

volumes, but he had no hope of being able to do so, un- 
less, as he humourously said " Government was pleased 
to send him back to Mandalay for another period of 
six years. " 

Even the perfunctory and casual account he has given 
in the Arctic Home and the Gita-Rahasya, of the progress 
of the ancient Aryans in culture, shows that he was 
gifted with an imagination of a very high order ; Mr. 
Tilak's imagination was rather the solid, strong and 
masculine imagination of a scientist or a philosopher 
than the poet's which like " a beautiful and ineffectual 
angel " beats " in the void, his luminous wings." His 
short but suggestive article on the " Indian and the 
Chaldean Vedas " strikes out a new line of investigation 
not only in comparative philology but in the history 
of ancient Asia as well. In this article, Mr. Tilak 
starts with a quotation from the Atharva-Veda wherein 
he finds several words that look unsanskrit in origin, 
traces them to the Chaldean Vedas and then gives his 
arguments regarding inter-communication between India 
and Chaldea. 

Mr. Tilak's genius was at once comprehensive and 
subtle. '* In one swift gyre " it surveyed the whole 
extent of the subject in hand ; at the same time there 
was nothing too minute for its ken. He developed 
argument after argument, built up theory after theory, 
with the same enjojmient with which he descended to the 
exhaustive discussion of the grammatical and philological 
peculiarities of a word ; after surveying with his intel- 
lectual teleoscope the rise and progress of philosophical 
thoughts and systems, he did not disdain with micros- 
copic minuteness to trace a missing verse from a refer- 
22S 



338 LOKAMANYA TILAK 

ence book {e. g. Sankhya-Karikas) or fix the Sanskrit 
definition of Hindu Epics. This subtlety of intellect 
enabled him to emend and correctly interpret all the 
verses of that knotty little book — the Vedanga-Jyotish. 

The clarity of his ideas and the rapidity with which 
he transmitted them to paper were really wonderful. 
The Arctic Home contains references to nearly 500 
learned volumes, and the Gita-Rahasya to nearly twice 
that number. He spent days, months and years in 
collecting and analyzing materials for his treatises. 
But once the materials were fully digested and the 
skeleton-notes prepared, he took very little time to write 
or dictate the book. Thus he worked at the Orion for 
nearly four years, at the Arctic Home for nearly nine, 
and at the Gita-Rahasya for more than twenty years. 
But the time he actually took to write these books was 
incredibly small. The Orion was finished in less than 
one month and the Arctic Home (about 450 Pages) in 
about two months. His magnum opus, t^e Gita" 
Rahasya required only five months. It was written 
in the winter of 1910-11 at Mandalay. 

The Mahabharat (and especially the Gita) and the 
Rig'veda were Mr. Tilak's favourite books. While read- 
ing the Gita in 1889, it occurred to hun " that impor- 
tant conclusions may be deduced from the statement of 
Krishna that ' he was Margashirsha of the months'." 
This led him to inquire into the primitive Vedic Calen- 
dar and in 1892 Mr. Tilak sent an essay on this subject 
to the Ninth Oriental Congress held in London and in 
the next year (1893) he published in book-form the re- 
sults of his four years' researches. In this book, Mr. Tilak 
abandoned the purely linguistic method of research of 



TILAK THE SCHOLAR 339 

the Western scholars and adopted the astronomical one 
about the utility of which those scholars were rather 
doubtful. The book created a sensation and though it 
was at first perused with scepticism, still subsequently 
Max Mullec Weber Jacobi and other Sanskritists had 
to accept Mr. Tilak's conclusions and re-adjust their own 
in the light of Mr. Tilak's investigations. Dr. Bloom- 
field the celebrated Professor of Sanskrit, at the John 
Hopkin's University referring to the Orion said (1894): — 
" But a literary event of even greater importance 
has happened within the last two or three months — an 
event which is certain to stir the world of science and 
culture far more than the beatific reminiscences. Some 
twelve weeks ago, I received from India a small duo- 
decimo volume, in the clumsy get-up and faulty typo- 
graphy of the native Anglo-Indian Press. It came 
with the regards of the author, a person totally unknown 
to fame. I had never heard his name. * * *. It wiU 
be understood that the entry of the little volume upon 
my horizon was not such as to prejudice me in its favour, 
and secondly, I placed it where it might be reached, 
without too much effort, in the drowsy after-dinner 
hour, to be disposed of, along with much second-class 
matter such as reaches a scholar through the channels 
of the Postal Union. Nor was the preface ai all en- 
couraging. The author blandly informs us that the 
age of the Rigveda, cannot be less than 4000 years before 
Christ and that the express records of the Hindu anti- 
quity point back to 6000 before Christ. Having in 
mind the boundless fancy of the Hindu through the 
ages and his particularly fatal facility for * taking his 
mouthful ' when it comes to a question of numbers.

proposed to myself to continue to turn the leaves of 
the book with the amused smile of orthodoxy befitting 
the occassion. But soon the amused smile gave way 
to an uneasy sense that something unusual had hap- 
pened. I was first impressed with something leonine in 
the way in which the author controlled the Vedic lite- 
rature and the occidental works on the same ; my su- 
perficial reading was soon replaced by absorbed study, 
and finally, having been prepared to scoff mildly, I con- 
fess that the author had convinced me in all the essen- 
tial points. The book is unquestionably the literary sen- 
sation of the year ; history, the chronic readjuster shall 
have her hands uncommonly full to assimilate the result 
of Tilak's discovery and arrange her paraphernalia in 
the new perspective." 

After the publication of the Orion, Mr. Tilak carried 
on correspondence with Prof. Max Muller on various 
philological and astronomical points. Like some chro- 
nic fever, the subject pursued him, despite the claims 
which political work had upon his time and energy. 
The years 1895-97 were, indeed, some of the busiest 
years of his life ; but all the same, Vedic chronology 
formed a strong undercurrent of his thoughts. This 
was a peculiarity with Mr. Tilak. Frequently he could 
so withdraw his mind from work, that only the lighter 
moods occupied him. But when a subject 'possessed' 
him, it gave him no rest, it tormentated him even in 
his sleep. Before such a powerful concentration it was- 
no wonder that Saraswati yielded the keys of her 
treasures. Throughout the busy years of the Poona 
Congress, the Famine, the Plague, the Councillorship 
and the Press-prosecutions in the Bombay Presidency^ 



TILAK THE SCHOLAR 34I 

the little leisure he could snatch was given to Vedic 
•studies. In 1897, he was sentenced to rigorous impri- 
sonment ; and what time he could get in the Yeravda 
Jail, was devoted to the continuation of his Vedic re- 
searches. The first manuscript of the Arctic Home 
was written at the end of 1898, but Mr. Tilak hesitated 
to publish the book for a long time " because the hues 
of investigation had ramified into many allied sciences 
"Such as geology, archaeology, comparative mythology 
and so on " and as Mr. Tilak thought himself to be a 
layman in these, he felt some diffidence as to whether 
he had " correctly grasped the bearings of the latest re- 
searches in these siences." Unable in India to find a 
University atmosphere where one could get all up-to- 
date information on any desired subject, the only course 
open for Mr. Tilak was, in the words of Prof. Max Muller 
'* to step boldly out of his own domain and take an in- 
dependent survey " of the aUied sciences like Geology, 
€ven at the risk of being called " an interloper, an 
ignoramus, a mere dilettante." After completely satis- 
fying himself on all the different points, Mr. Tilak 
published the book (1903) which was more favourably 
received by Western scholars than the Orion. 

Like the early editorial writing of Mr. Tilak, the 
Orion was written in what may be called the scholar's 
style. But the Arctic Home is a book which even the 
lay reader can peruse with enjoyment. The style is 
smooth, flowing, and extremely lucid, occasionally 
rising to the heights of philosophical eloquence. The 
treatment is at once interesting and methodical. After 
stating the problem in brief, Mr. Tilak treats of the 
Glacial Period and prores from geological evidence of 



342 LOKAMANYA TILAK 

fossil, fauna and flora that " in the early geological 
ages, when the Alps were low and the Himalayas not 
yet upheaved, and when Asia and Africa were repre- 
sented only by a group of islands, * * * an equable 
and uniform climate prevailed over the whole surface 
of the globe as a result of these geographical conditions." 
Mr. Tilak then describes the Polar and circumpolar cha* 
racteristics. The former are : (i) the sun rises in the 
South (2) the stars do not rise and set but revolve in 
horizontal planes (3) the year consists only of one long 
day and one long night of six months each (4) the sun 
rises and sets only once a year but the twilight, whether 
of the morning or of the evening lasts continuously for 
about two mo7iths. The circum-polar characteristics 
are (i) The sun will always be to the South of the zenith 
of the observer. (2) A large number of stars are above 
the horizon, during the entire period of their revolu- 
tion and hence, always visible. (3) The year is made 
up of three parts (a) one long continuous night ; (b) one 
long continuous day (c) a succession of ordinary days 
and nights. (4) The dawn, at the close of the long 
continuous night lasts for several days. Mr. Tilak; 
says " if a Vedic description or tradition discloses any 
of the characteristics mentioned above, we may safely 
infer that th6 tradition is polar or circum-polar in origin 
and the phenomenon, if not actually witnessed by the 
poet, was at least known to him by tradition faithfully 
handed down from generation to generation." Mr. 
Tilak then quotes many such passages and traditions 
and proves the existence of the Arctic Home. He sup- 
ports his conclusions by studies in comparative mytho- 
logy and by quotations from the Avesta "which express 



TILAK THE SCHOLAR 343 

ly tell us that the happy land of Airy ay a Vaejo or the 
Aryan Paradise, was located in a region where the sun 
shone but once a year, and that it was destroyed by the 
invasion of snow and ice, which rendered its climate 
inclement." 

Here is an Anglo-Indian estimate of Mr. Tilak's book. 
Prof. Fraser, editor of the Indian Education thus writes 
about the Arctic Home in the Vedas : — 

** We regret we cannot enter into a critical review 
of this book ; but we gladly assist to make it 
known and pay a short tribute to the clear style 
in which it is written throughout. All readers 
will appreciate this; Indian students not least. It 
is well and carefuUy printed and presented in an 
attractive cover. Unfortunately^ the binding is 
very weak and this a great pity in the case of a 
book which has a permanent value. It is fast- 
ened with wire instead of being sewn ; this is a 
feeble sort of binding in any case. In India, the 
wire soon rusts and this causes the paper to rot 
and leaves to become loose." 
Apparently the Une of Addison's Tom Folio is not 
yet extinct ! 

In the course of his Vedic studies Mr. Tilak found 
that, in spite of the valuable initial help, which the 
commentators give, it is on the whole better to carry 
research work in ancient hterature, unfettered by the 
occasionally wrong lead given by the so-called authori- 
ties. It was only when Mr. Tilak rejected Sayana on one 
hand, and Prof. Max Muller on the other that he could 
make valuable contribution to the interpretation of the 
Vedas, He tried the same method with the Gita. Hq

was first introduced to this book during his father's 
last illness ; at that time Mr. Tilak was barely i6. In 
the stillness of evening, he would sit by the lamp-side 
and read out to his father the Gita and its Marathi 
commentary. The sublime melody of the Gita charmed 
him and since then he was a devoted student of the 
Lord's Song. But, almost from the time of his first 
perusal of the book, a doubt haunted his mind. The 
great Shankaracharya has pronounced the Gita to have 
preached Jnyana, unqualified by Karman. Can it be 
so ? If yes, how are we to reconcile the fact that 
Arjuna was moved, by the Lord's Message, to do that 
Karman, which had repelled him ? The commenta- 
tors are silent. Indeed, most of them entirely neglect 
the first chapter and start their commentaries from the 
nth verse of chapter second. Wearied by the wrong 
lead given by the commentators, Mr. Tilak read the 
original repeatedly without the aid of any commentary, 
till at last, be found that the Gita, far from being a book 
of cold philosophy, was a guide for every day life, a 
master-piece on Karmayoga Shastra. The more 
did he discuss this subject with contemporary 
scholars, the more was he convinced of the strength 
of his contention, until at last he determined to 
give his researches out to the public. But that 
was not an easy matter. The anti-Partition agita- 
tion made Mr. Tilak the leader of All-India Party » 
and all his time was swallowed up by Politics- 
He had given up the attempt as hopeless and when 
in July 1908, he was sentenced to six years' trans- 
portation, even the last lingering chance was 
apparently lost, for no-body ever expected him to 



TILAK THE SCHOLAR 345 

■survive the dreary period. But the subsequent com- 
mutation of his sentence to one of simple imprisonment 
together with the Hterary facihties afforded, en- 
abled him to undertake the enterprise and within less 
than twenty months after he was " well settled " at 
Mandalay, he wrote in a letter as follows : — 

" About the Gita, I have finished what I call Gita 
Rahasya, an independent and original book investiga- 
ting the purpose of the Gita and showing how our reli- 
gious philosophy is applied therein to solution of the 
ethical problem. For, my view of the Gita is, that 
it is a work on Ethics — not Utilitarian, nor intuitional 
but transcendental, somewhat on the lines followed in 
the Green's ' Prolegomena to Ethics .' I have com- 
pared, throughout, the Gita-philosophy with the West- 
em, both religious and ethical and have tried to show 
that our system is, to say the least, not inferior to any 
of the Western methods. This Rahasya is made up 
of 15 chapters with an appendix devoted to a critical 
examination of the ,Gita as part of the Mahabharat 
and discussing its age etc. * * * j^ ^ill i think 
fill about 300 or 350 pages. To this a translation of 
the Gita, according to my view of it, is yet to be 
appended and I am now engaged on this 
translation, which, by the bye, is a light task. * * * 
I believe it will be found to be an entirely 
-original book like the " Orion "; for so far as 
I am aware, no one has ventured on such a path 
before in translating or commenting on the Gita, 
though I have had this view of the Gita in mind 
for about the last twenty years and more. I 
have used all the books that I have here with me 



346 LOKAMANYA TILAK 

but there are references to works, not with me 
here, and as these are quoted from memory, they will 
have to be verified before publishing the book * * * 
Kant's ' Critique of Pure Reason ' and * Green's Prole- 
gomena to Ethics ' are the main English authorities for 
my book which is based on the Brahmasutras (Shankara- 
charya's Bhashya) and the Mahabharat * * * and 
it treats in brief, the Hindu Philosophy of active life." 

The book — a ponderous volume of 854 closely-print- 
ed pages — was, published (1915) a few months after 
Mr. Tilak was set free. The first edition — 6000 copies — 
was sold off within a week. The second and third edi- 
tions were also soon exhausted. The book has been 
translated into Gujarati, Hindi and Kanarese and Mr. 
Tilak proposed to get it rendered into Bengali, Telgu, 
Tamil and other leading vernaculars of India. It was 
his intention to give out his researches to the Western 
countries but as that was a work which could not con- 
veniently be left to mere translators, Mr. Tilak intend- 
ed to do it himself. 

But that was not to be ; nor was this the only 
literary project he left unfinished. With life and 
leisure, he would have brought out treatises on 
(i) The Differential and Integral Calculas (2) The 
Hindu Law (3) and Politics. Regarding (i) he had 
collected all the necessary materials and digested 
them. A few months' leisure and the book would 
have been ready. The same remark holds good 
about his intended book on Politics. His sudden 
death was a loss not only to the PoUtical but 
also to the Literary World. Even Mr. Tilak's 
opponents will admit that during its life, the University 



TILAK THE SCHOLAR 34/ 

of Bombay has not produced a more versatile or 
original genius. Its semi-official character may not 
have enabled it to honour itself by honouring Mr. 
Tilak. India, however, gratefully recognises that the 
literary recreation of Mr. Tilak has accomplished far 
brighter and more enduring results than the works of 
many a professional Sanskritist.
