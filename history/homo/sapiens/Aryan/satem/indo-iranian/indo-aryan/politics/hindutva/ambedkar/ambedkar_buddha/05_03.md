> 1. The Bhikkhu's Duty to Convert
>
>  1. The news of the conversion of Yasa and his four friends to the
> Dhamma spread far and wide. The result was that lay persons belonging
> to the highest families in the country, and to those next to the
> highest, came to be instructed in the doctrine of the Blessed One, and
> to take refuge in him and in his Dhamma.  
>  2. Many people were coming to him to receive instruction in the
> Dhamma. The Lord knew that it was difficult for him personally to give
> instruction to each one. He also felt the necessity of organising
> \[the\] Parivrajakas, whose number was swelling every day, into a
> religious order which he called the Sangh.  
>  3. He accordingly made the Parivrajakas the members of the Sangh,
> and framed rules of discipline called vinaya, and made them binding
> upon the members of the Sangh.  
>  4. The Blessed Lord later on laid down two stages to be undergone
> by a disciple before he became a Bhikkhu. First a disciple became a
> Parivrajaka and remained a Parivrajaka for a certain number of years,
> attached to a Bhikkhu and remaining in training under him. After his
> training period was over, he was allowed to take Upasampada if he
> satisfied a body of examiners that he was fit for it. It is only then
> that he was allowed to become a Bhikkhu and a member of the Sangh.  
>  5. There was no time in the early stages of the Dhamma to make
> such arrangements. The Lord, therefore, made them Bhikkhus and sent
> them out as Missionaries to spread his religion to anywhere and
> everywhere.  
>  6. And before sending them out, the Blessed One said to the
> Bhikkhus: "I am delivered, O Bhikkhus, from all fetters, human and
> divine. You, O Bhikkhus, from all fetters, human and divine. Go ye
> now, and wander for the gain of the many, for the welfare of the many,
> out of compassion for the world; for the good, for the gain and for
> the welfare of gods and men.  
>  7. "Let not two of you go the same way. Preach, Bhikkhus, the
> doctrine which is glorious in the beginning, glorious in the middle,
> glorious at the end, in the spirit and in the letter; proclaim a
> consummate, perfect, and pure life of holiness.  
>  8. "Go then through every country, convert those not yet
> converted; throughout the world that lies burnt up with sorrow, teach
> everywhere; (instruct) those lacking right instruction.  
>  9. "Go where there are great Rishis, royal Rishis, Brahman Rishis
> too; these all dwell there, influencing men according to their
> schools.  
>  10. "Go, therefore, each one travelling by himself; filled with
> compassion, go! rescue and receive."  
>  11. The Blessed Lord also told them:  
>  12. "That the gift of the Dhamma exceeds all gifts; the sweetness
> of the Dhamma exceeds all sweetness; the delight in the Dhamma exceeds
> all delights.  
>  13. "The fields are damaged by weeds, mankind is damaged by
> passion; therefore a gift of Dhamma brings great reward.  
>  14. "The fields are damaged by weeds, mankind is damaged by
> hatred; therefore a gift of Dhamma brings great reward.  
>  15. "The fields are damaged by weeds; mankind is damaged by
> vanity; therefore the gift of Dhamma brings great reward.  
>  16. "The fields are damaged by weeds, mankind is damaged by lust;
> therefore a gift of Dhamma brings great reward."  
>  17. Then the sixty Bhikkhus, receiving orders to carry on the
> mission to propagate the Dhamma, went through every land.  
>  18. The Lord gave them further instruction in the matter of
> conversions.
>
>   
> §2. Conversion Not to be by Miracles
>
>  1. The Exalted One was once staying among the Mallas, at Anapiya,
> one of their towns.  
>  2. Now the Exalted One, having robed himself, put on his cloak,
> and took his bowl, and entered the town for alms.  
>  3. The Blessed One thought: "It is too early for me now to go
> through Anapiya for alms. I might go to the pleasance where
> Bhaggava,the wanderer dwells, and call upon him."  
>  4. So the Exalted One went to the pleasance and to the place where
> Bhaggava the wanderer was.  
>  5. Then Bhaggava spake thus to the Exalted One: "Let my Lord, the
> Exalted One come near. Welcome to the Exalted One! It is long since
> the Exalted One has taken the opportunity to come our way. May it
> please you, Sir, to be seated; here is a seat made ready."  
>  6. The Exalted One sat down thereon, and Bhaggava, taking a
> certain low stool, sat down beside him. So seated, Bhaggava the
> wanderer spake thus to the Exalted One:  
>  7. "Some days ago, Lord, Sunakkhatta of the Licchavis called on me
> and spake thus: 'I have now given up the Exalted One, Bhaggava. I am
> remaining no longer under him as my teacher.' Is the fact really
> so?"  
>  8. "It is just so, Bhaggava, as Sunakkhatta of the Licchavis
> said.  
>  9. "Some days ago, Bhaggava, a good many days ago, Sunakkhatta,
> the Licchavi, came to call on me, and spake thus: 'Sir, I now give up
> the Exalted One, I will henceforth remain no longer under him as my
> teacher.' When he told me this, I said to him: 'But, now, Sunakkhatta,
> have I ever said to you: 'Come, Sunakkhatta, live under me as my
> pupil?'  
>  10. "'No, Sir, you have not', replied Sunakkhatta.  
>  11. "Or have you ever said to me: 'Sir, I would fain dwell under
> the Exalted One (as my teacher)?'  
>  12. "'No, Sir, I have not,' said Sunakkhatta.  
>  13. "'But if I said not the one, and you said not the other, what
> are you and what am I, that you talk of giving up?'  
>  14. "'Well, but. Sir, the Exalted One works me no mystic wonders
> surpassing the power of ordinary men.'  
>  15. "Why, now, Sunakkhatta, have lever said to you: 'Come, take
> me as your teacher, Sunakkhatta, and I will work for you mystic
> wonders surpassing the power of ordinary men?'  
>  16. "'You have not, Sir.'  
>  17. "Or have you ever said to me: 'Sir, I would fain take the
> Exalted One as my teacher, for he will work for me mystic wonders
> beyond the powers of ordinary men?'  
>  18. "'I have not, Sir.'  
>  19. "'But if I said not the one, and you said not the other, what
> are you and what am I, foolish man, that you talk of giving up? What
> think you, Sunakkhatta?'  
>  20. "Whether mystic wonders beyond the power of ordinary men are
> wrought, or whether they are not, is not the object for which I teach
> the Dhamma this: that it leads to the thorough destruction of ill for
> the doer thereof?'  
>  21. "'Whether, Sir, they are wrought or not, that is indeed the
> object for which the Norm is taught by the Exalted One.'  
>  22. "But Bhaggava, Sunakkhatta went on saying to me, 'Sir, the
> Exalted One does not reveal to me the beginning of things.'  
>  23. "Why now, Sunakkhatta, have I ever said to you: 'Come,
> Sunakkhatta, be my disciple and I will reveal to you the beginning of
> things?'  
>  24. "'Sir, you have not.'  
>  25. "Or have you ever said to me: 'I will become the Exalted One's
> pupil, for he will reveal to me the beginning of things?'  
>  26. "'Sir, I have not.'  
>  27. "'But if I have not said the one and you have not said the
> other, what are you and what am I, foolish man, that you talk of
> giving up on that account? What \[is it to\] you, Sunakkhatta? Whether
> the beginning of things be revealed, or whether it be not, is the
> object for which I teach the Dhamma this: that it leads to the
> thorough destruction of ill for the doer thereof?'  
>  28. "'Whether, Sir, they are revealed or not, that is indeed the
> object for which the Dhamma is taught by the Exalted One."  
>  29. "'If then, Sunakkhatta, it matters not to that object whether
> the beginning of things be revealed, or whether it be not, of what use
> to you would it be to have the beginning of things revealed?'  
>  30. "'In many ways have you, Sunakkhatta, spoken my praises among
> the Vajjins.'  
>  31. "'In many ways have you, Sunakkhatta, spoken the praises of
> the Dhamma among the Vajjins.'  
>  32. "'In many ways have you, Sunakkhatta, spoken the praises of
> the Order among the Vajjins.'  
>  33. "I tell you, Sunakkhatta, I make known to you, that there will
> be those that shall say concerning you thus: 'Sunakkhatta of the
> Licchavis was not able to live the holy life under Gautama the
> recluse. And he, not being able to adhere to it, hath renounced the
> discipline and turned to lower things.'  
>  34. "Thus, Bhaggava, did Sunakkhatta of the Licchayis, addressed
> by me, depart from this Doctrine and Discipline, as one doomed to
> disaster."  
>  35. And soon after, leaving the Doctrine and Discipline of the
> Buddha, Sunakkhatta started telling people that there was nothing
> superhuman about the Buddha's ennobling gifts of knowledge and
> insight; that it was his own reasoning which had hammered out a
> doctrine of his own evolving and of his personal invention, such that
> whoso hears it preached for his good has only to act up to it to be
> guided to the utter ending of ill.  
>  36. Although Sunakkhatta was slandering the Buddha, what he was
> telling people was true. For the Buddha never resorted to the
> superhuman or the miraculous in propagating his Doctrine.
>
>   
> § 3. Conversion Not to be by Force
>
>  1. The Blessed One was once going along the high road between
> Rajagraha and Nalanda with a great company of the brethren,—with about
> five hundred brethren. And Suppiya the mendicant, too, was going along
> the high road between Rajagraha and Nalanda with his disciple, the
> youth Brahmadatta.  
>  2. Now just then, Suppiya the mendicant was speaking in many ways
> in dispraiseof the Buddha, in dispraise of the Doctrine, in dispraise
> of the Order. But young Brahmadatta, his pupil, gave utterance, in
> many ways, to praise of the Buddha, to praise of the Doctrine, to
> praise of the Order.  
>  3. Thus they two, teacher and pupil, holding opinions in direct
> contradiction one to the other, were following, step by step, after
> the Blessed One and the comany of the brethren.  
>  4. Now the Blessed One put up at the royal rest-house in the
> Ambalatthika pleasance to pass the night, and with him the company of
> the brethren. And so also did Suppiya the mendicant, and with him his
> young disciple Brahmadatta. And there, at the rest-house, these two
> carried on the same discussion as before.  
>  5. And in the early dawn a number of the brethren assembled, as
> they rose up, in the pavilion; and the subject of the talk that sprang
> up among them was the conversation between Suppiya and Bramhadatta.  
>  6. Now the Blessed One, on realising what was the drift of their
> talk, went to the pavilion, and took his seat on the mat spread out
> for him. And when he had sat down he said: "What is the talk on which
> you are engaged sitting here, and what is the subject of the
> conversation between you?" And they told him all. And he said:  
>  7. "Brethren, if outsiders should speak against me or against the
> Doctrine, or against the Order, you should not on that account either
> bear malice, or suffer heart-burning, or feel ill-will.  
>  8. "If you, on that account, should be angry and hurt, that would
> stand in the way of your own self-conquest. If, when others speak
> against us, you feel angry at that, and displeased, would you then be
> able to judge how far that speech of theirs is well said or ill?"  
>  9. "That would not be so, Sir."  
>  10. "But when outsiders speak in dispraise of me, or of the
> Doctrine, or of the Order, you should unravel what is false and point
> it out as wrong, saying: ' or this or that reason this is not the
> fact, that is not so, such a thing is not found among us, is not in
> us.'  
>  11. "But also, brethren, outsiders may speak in praise of me, in
> praise of the Doctrine, in praise of the Order. What are the things
> when they would say praising me you would say?  
>  12. "He may say 'Putting away the killing of living things,
> Gautama the recluse holds aloof from the destruction of life. He has
> laid the cudgel and the sword aside; and ashamed of roughness, and
> full of mercy, he dwells compassionate and kind to all creatures that
> have life.' It is thus that the unconverted man, when speaking in
> praise of the Tathagata, might speak.  
>  13. "Or he might say: 'Putting away the taking of what has not
> been given, Gautama the recluse lived aloof from grasping what is not
> his own. He takes only what is given, and expecting that gifts will
> come, he passes his life in honesty and purity of heart.'  
>  14. "Or he might say: 'Putting away unchastity, Gautama the
> recluse is chaste. He holds himself aloof, far off, from the vulgar
> practice, from the sexual act.'  
>  15. "Or he might say: 'Putting away lying words, Gautama the
> recluse holds himself aloof from falsehood. He speaks truth, from the
> truth he never swerves; faithful and trustworthy, he breaks not his
> word to the world.'  
>  16. "Or he might say: 'Putting away slander, Gautama the recluse
> holds himself aloof from calumny. What he hears here he repeats not
> elsewhere to raise a quarrel against the people here; what he hears
> elsewhere he repeats not here to raise a quarrel against the people
> there. Thus does he live as a binder-together of those who are
> divided, an encourager of those who are friends, a peacemaker, a lover
> of peace, impassioned for peace, a speaker of words that make for
> peace.'  
>  17. "Or he might say: 'Putting away rudeness of speech, Gautama
> the recluse holds himself aloof from harsh language. Whatsover word is
> blameless, pleasant to the ear, lovely, reaching to the heart, urbane,
> pleasing to the people, beloved of the people—such are words he
> speaks.'  
>  18. "Or he might say : ' Putting away frivolous talk, Gotama the
> recluse holds himself aloof from vain conversation. In season he
> speaks, in accordance with the facts, words full of meaning, on
> religion, on the discipline of the Order. He speaks, and at the right
> time, words worthy to be laid up in one's heart, fitly illustrated,
> clearly divided, to the point.'  
>  19. "Or he might say: 'Gautama the recluse holds himself aloof
> from causing injury to seeds or plants.
>
> > 'He takes but one meal a day, not eating at night, refraining from
> > food after hours (after midday).  
> > 'He refrains from being a spectator at shows, at fairs with nautch
> > dances, singing, and music.  
> > 'He abstains from wearing, \[or\] adorning or ornamenting himself
> > with, garlands, scents, and unguents.  
> > 'He abstains from the use of large and lofty beds.  
> > 'He abstains from accepting silver or gold.  
> > 'He abstains from accepting uncooked grain.  
> > 'He abstains from accepting women or girls.  
> > 'He abstains from accepting bond-men or bond-women.  
> > 'He abstains from accepting sheep or goats.  
> > 'He abstains from accepting fowls or swine.  
> > 'He abstains from accepting elephants, cattle, horses and mares.  
> > 'He abstains from accepting cultivated fields or waste.  
> > 'He abstains from acting as a go-between or messenger.  
> > 'He abstains from buying and selling.  
> > 'He abstains from cheating with scales or bronzes or measures.  
> > 'He abstains from the crooked ways of bribery, cheating and fraud.  
> > 'He abstains from maiming, murder, putting in bonds; highway
> > robbery, dacoity, and violence.'
>
>  20. "Such are the things, brethren, which an unconverted man, when
> speaking in praise of the Tathagata, might say. But you should not,
> even on that account, be filled with pleasure or gladness, or be
> lifted up in heart. Were you to be so, that also would stand in the
> way of your self-conquest. When outsiders speak in praise of me, or of
> the Doctrine, or of the Order, you should acknowledge what is right to
> be the fact, saying: 'For this or that reason this is the fact; that
> is so; such a thing is found among us, is in us.'"
>
>   
> § 4. A Bhikkhu Must Fight to Spread Virtue (Dhamma)
>
>  1. Addressing the Bhikkhus, the Lord once said:  
>  2. "It is not I, O disciples, that quarrel with the world," said
> the Lord, "but the world that quarrels with me. A teacher of the truth
> does not quarrel with anyone in the world."  
>  3. "Warriors, warriors, Lord, we call ourselves. In what way then
> are we warriors?"  
>  4. "We wage war, O disciples, therefore we are called warriors."  
>  5. "Wherefore, Lord, do we wage war?"  
>  6. "For lofty virtues, for high endeavour, for sublime wisdom—for
> these things do we wage war; therefore we are called warriors."  
>  7. Where virtue is in danger do not avoid fighting, do not be
> mealy-mouthed.
