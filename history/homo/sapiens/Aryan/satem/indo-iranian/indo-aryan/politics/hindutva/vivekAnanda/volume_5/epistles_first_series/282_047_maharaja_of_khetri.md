## XLVII

U. S. A.,  
*9th July, 1895*.

. . . About my coming to India, the matter stands thus I am, as your
Highness (The Maharaja of Khetri) well knows, a man of dogged
perseverance. I have planted a seed in this country; it is already a
plant, and I expect it to be a tree very soon. I have got a few hundred
followers. I shall make several Sannyāsins, and then I go to India
leaving the work to them. The more the Christian priests oppose me, the
more I am determined to leave a permanent mark on their country. . . . I
have already some friends in London. I am going there by the end of
August. . . . This winter anyway has to be spent partly in London and
partly in New York, and then I shall be free to go to India. There will
be enough men to carry on the work here after this winter if the Lord is
kind. Each work has to pass through these stages — ridicule, opposition,
and then acceptance. Each man who thinks ahead of his time is sure to be
misunderstood. So opposition and persecution are welcome, only I have to
be steady and pure and must have immense faith in God, and all these
will vanish. . . .

VIVEKANANDA.
