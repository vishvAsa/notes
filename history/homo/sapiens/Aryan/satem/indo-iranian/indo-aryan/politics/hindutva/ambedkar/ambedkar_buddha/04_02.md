> § 1. Preliminary
>
>  1. What happens after death, is a question often asked.  
>  2. The contemporaries of the Buddha held two different views. One
> set was called Eternalist, and the other was called Annihilationist.  
>  3. The Eternalist said that the soul knows no death: therefore
> life is eternal. It is renewed by rebirth.  
>  4. The thesis of the Annihilationists was summed up in one word,
> *Ucchedvad*, which meant that death is the end of everything. There is
> nothing left after death.  
>  5. The Buddha was not an eternalist. For it involved a belief in
> the existence of a separate, immortal soul, to which he was opposed.  
>  6. Was the Buddha an annihilationist? With his belief in the
> non-existence of the soul, the Buddha would naturally be expected to
> be an annihilationist.  
>  7. But in the Alagaddupamma-Sutta the Buddha complains that he is
> called an annihilationist, when as a matter of fact he is not.  
>  8. This is what he says: "Though this is what I affirm and what I
> preach, yet some recluses and Brahmins, wrongly, erroneously, and
> falsely charge me, in defiance of facts, with being an annihilationist
> and with preaching the disintegration, destruction, and extirpation of
> human beings.  
>  9. "It is just what I am not, and what I do not affirm, that is
> wrongly, erroneously, and falsely, charged against me by these good
> people who would make me out to be an annihilationist."  
>  10. If this statement is a genuine one, and is not an
> interpolation by those who wanted to foist a Brahmanic doctrine on
> Buddhism, the statement raises a serious dilemma  
>  11. How can the Buddha not believe in the existence of the soul,
> and yet say that he is not an annihilationist?  
>  12. This raises the question: did the Buddha believe in rebirth?
>
>   
> § 2. Rebirth of What?
>
>  1. Did the Buddha believe in rebirth?  
>  2. The answer is in the affirmative.  
>  3. It is better to split this question further into two parts: (1)
> Rebirth of What; and (2) Rebirth of Whom.  
>  4. It is better to take each one of these two questions
> separately.  
>  5. Here we may consider the first: Rebirth of What.  
>  6. This question is almost always ignored. It is because of the
> mixing of the two questions that so much confusion has arisen.  
>  7. According to the Buddha, there are four elements of Existence
> which go to compose the body. They are (1) Prithvi; (2) Apa; (3) Tej;
> and (4) Vayu.  
>  8. Question is, when the human body dies, what happens to these
> four elements? Do they also die along with dead body? Some say that
> they do.  
>  9. The Buddha said no: they join the mass of similar elements
> floating in (Akash) space.  
>  10. When the four elements from this floating mass join together,
> a new birth takes place.  
>  11. This is what the Buddha meant by rebirth.  
>  12. The elements need not \[be\], and are not necessarily, from
> the same body which is dead. They may be drawn from different dead
> bodies.  
>  13. It must be noted that the body dies. But the elements are
> ever-living.  
>  14. This is the kind of rebirth in which the Buddha believed.  
>  15. Great light is thrown upon the subject by Sariputta in his
> dialogue with Maha-Kotthita.  
>  16. It is said that once when the Lord was staying at Shravasti in
> Jeta's Grove in Anathapindika's Ashram, the Maha-Kotthita, rising up
> at even-tide from his meditations, went to Sariputta and asked him to
> elucidate some of the questions which troubled him.  
>  17. The following was one of them.  
>  18. Maha-Kotthita asked, "How many factors has the first ecstasy
> (Dhyana) put from it, and how many does it retain?"  
>  19. Sariputta replied, "Five of each. Gone are lusts,
> malevolence, torpor, worry and doubt. Observation, reflection, zest,
> satisfaction and a focussed heart persist."  
>  20. Maha-Kotthita asked, "Take the five senses of sight, sound,
> smell, taste and touch,—each with its own particular province and
> range of function, separate and mutually distinct. What ultimate base
> have they? Who enjoys all their five provinces and ranges?"  
>  21. Sariputta replied, "Mind (Mano)."  
>  22. Maha-Kotthita asked, "On what do these five faculties of sense
> depend?"  
>  23. Sariputta replied, "On vitality."  
>  24. Maha-Kotthita asked, "On what does vitality depend?"  
>  25. Sariputta: On heat."  
>  26. Maha-Kotthita asked, "On what does heat depend?"  
>  27. Sariputta replied, "On vitality."  
>  28. Maha-Kotthita asked, "You say that vitality depends on heat;
> you also say that heat depends on vitality! What precisely is the
> meaning to be attached to this?"  
>  29. Sariputta replied, "I will give you an illustration. Just as
> in the case of a lamp, the light reveals the flame and the flame the
> light, so vitality depends upon heat and heat on vitality."  
>  30. Maha-Kotthita asked, "How many things must quit the body
> before it is flung aside and cast away like a senseless log?"  
>  31. Sariputta answered, "Vitality, heat, and consciousness."  
>  32. Maha-Kotthita asked, "What is the difference between a
> lifeless corpse and an almsman in trance, in whom perception and
> feelings are stilled?"  
>  33. Sariputta replied, "In the corpse not only are the plastic
> forces of the body and speech and mind stilled and quiescent, but also
> vitality is exhausted, heat is quenched, and the faculties of sense
> broken up; whereas in the almsman in trance vitality persists, heat
> abides, and the faculties are clear, although respiration,
> observation, and perception are stilled and quiescent."  
>  34. This probably is the best and most complete exposition of
> Death or Annihilation.  
>  35. There is only one lacuna in this dialogue. Maha-Kotthita
> should have asked Sariputta one question: What is heat?  
>  36. What answer Sariputta would have given, it is not easy to
> imagine. But there can be no doubt that heat means energy.  
>  37. Thus amplified, the real answer to the question, What happens
> when the body dies? is: the body ceases to produce energy.  
>  38. But this is only a part of the answer. Because death also
> means that whatever energy that had escaped from the body joins the
> general mass of energy playing about in the Universe.  
>  39. Annihilation has therefore a two-fold aspect. In one of its
> aspects it means cession \[=cessation\] of production of energy. In
> another aspect it means a new addition to the stock of \[the\] general
> floating mass of energy.  
>  40. It is probably because of this two-fold aspect of annihilation
> that the Buddha said that he was not an absolute annihilationist. He
> was an annihilationist so far as soul was concerned. He was not an
> annihilationist so far as matter was concerned.  
>  41. So interpreted, it is easy to understand why the Buddha said
> that he was not an annihilationist. He believed in the regeneration of
> matter and not in the rebirth of the soul.  
>  42. So interpreted, the Buddha's view is in consonance with
> science.  
>  43. It is only in this sense that the Buddha could be said to have
> believed in rebirth.  
>  44. Energy is never lost. That is what science affirms.
> Annihilation in the sense that after death nothing is left, would be
> contrary to science. For it would mean that energy is not constant in
> volume.  
>  45. This is the only way by which the dilemma could be solved.
>
>   
> §3. Rebirth of Whom?
>
>  1. The most difficult question is Rebirth of Whom.  
>  2. Does the same dead person take a new birth?  
>  3. Did the Buddha believe in this thesis? The answer is, "Most
> improbable."  
>  4. The answer depends upon the elements of existence of the dead
> man meeting together and forming a new body; then the possibility of
> the rebirth of the same sentient being is possible.  
>  5. If a new body is formed after a mixture or the different
> elements of the different men who are dead, then there is rebirth but
> not the rebirth of the same sentient being.  
>  6. This point has been well explained by sister Khema to King
> Pasenadi.  
>  7. Once the Exalted One was staying near Savatthi at Jeta Grove,
> in Anathapindika's Ashram.  
>  8. Now on that occasion the sister Khema, after going her rounds
> among the Kosalana, took up her quarters at Toranavatthu, between
> Shravasti and Saketa.  
>  9. Now the Rajah Pasenadi of Kosala was journeying from Saketa to
> Shravasti, and midway between Saketa and Shravasti he put up for one
> night at Toranavatthu.  
>  10. The Rajah Pasenadi of Kosala called a certain man and said,
> "Come thou, good fellow! Find out some recluse or brahmin such that I
> can wait upon him today."  
>  11. "Even so, your majesty," said that man in reply to the Rajah
> Pasenadi of Kosala, and after wandering through all Toranavatthu he
> saw not any one, either recluse or brahmin, on whom the Rajah Pasenadi
> might wait.  
>  12. Then that man saw the sister Khema, who had come to reside at
> Toranavatthu. And on seeing her he went back to the Rajah Pasenadi of
> Kosala, and said:  
>  13. "Your Majesty, there is no recluse or brahmin in Toranavatthu
> such that your majesty can wait upon him. But, your majesty, there is
> a sister named Khema, a woman-disciple of that Exalted One. Now of
> this lady a lovely rumour has gone abroad, that she is sage,
> accomplished, shrewd, widely learned, a brilliant talker, of goodly
> ready wit. Let your majesty wait upon her."  
>  14. So the Rajah Pasenadi of Kosala went to visit the sister
> Khema, and on coming to her saluted and sat down at one side. So
> seated, he said to her:  
>  15. "How say you, lady? Does the Tathagata exist after death?"  
>  16. "That also, maharajah is not revealed by the Exalted One."  
>  17. "How then, lady? When asked 'Does the Tathagata exist after
> death?' you reply, 'That is not revealed by the Exalted One,' and when
> I ask...the other questions, you make the same reply. Pray, lady, what
> is the reason, what is the cause, why this thing is not revealed by
> the Exalted One?"  
>  18. "Now in this matter, maharajah, I will question you. Do you
> reply as you think fit. Now how say you, maharajah. Have you some
> accountant, some ready reckoner, or calculator, able to count the sand
> in \[the\] Ganges, thus: There are so many hundred grains, or so many
> thousand grains, or so many hundreds of thousands of grains of
> sand?"  
>  19. "No, indeed, lady."  
>  20. "Then have you some accountant, ready reckoner, or calculator
> able to reckon the water in the mighty ocean, thus: There are so many
> gallons of water, so many hundreds, so many thousands, so many
> hundreds of thousand gallons of water?"  
>  21. "No, indeed, lady."  
>  22. "How is that?"  
>  23. "Mighty is the ocean, lady--deep, boundless, unfathomable."  
>  24. "Even so, maharajah, if one should try to define the Tathagata
> by his bodily form, that bodily form of the Tathagata is abandoned,
> cut down at the root, made like a palm-tree stump, made some thing
> that is not, made of a nature not to spring up again in future time.
> Set free from reckoning as body, maharajah, is the Tathagata. He is
> deep, boundless unfathomable, just like the mighty ocean. To say, 'The
> Tathagata exists after death', does not apply. To say, 'The Tathagata
> exists not after death', does not apply. To say, 'The Tathagata both
> exists and exists not, neither exists nor not exists, after death',
> does not apply.  
>  25. "If one should try to define the Tathagata by feeling--that
> feeling of the Tathagata is abandoned, cut down at the root...Yet free
> from reckoning as feeling is the Tathagata, maharajah, deep,
> boundless, unfathomable like the mighty ocean. To say, 'The Tathagata
> exists after death...exists not after death', does not apply.  
>  26. "So also if one should try to define the Tathagata by
> perception, by the activities, by consciousness...set free from
> reckoning by consciousness is the Tathagata, deep, boundless,
> unfathomable as the mighty ocean. To say, 'The Tathagata exists after
> death...exists not after death', does not apply."  
>  27. Then the Rajah Pasenadi of Kosala was delighted with the words
> of the sister Khema, and took pleasure therein. And he rose from his
> seat, saluted her by the right, and went away.  
>  28. Now on another occasion the Rajah went to visit the Exalted
> One, and on coming to him saluted him and sat down at one side. So
> seated, he said to the Exalted One:  
>  29. "Pray, Lord, does the Tathagata exist after death?"  
>  30. "Not revealed by me, maharajah, is this matter."  
>  31. "Then Lord, the Tathagata does not exist after death."  
>  32. "That also, maharajah, is not revealed by me."  
>  33. He then asks the other questions and gets the same reply.  
>  34. "How then, Lord? When I ask the question, 'Does the Tathagata
> exist?...does he not exist after death?' you reply, 'It is not
> revealed by me'. Pray, Lord, what is the reason, what is the cause,
> why this thing is not revealed by the Exalted One?"  
>  35. "Now, maharajah, I will question you. Do you reply as you
> think fit. Now what say you, maharajah--have you some
> accountant...(the rest is exactly as before).'  
>  36. "Wonderful, Lord! Strange it is, Lord, how the explanation
> both of Master and disciple, both in spirit and in letter, will agree,
> will harmonise, will not be inconsistent, that is, in any word about
> the highest.  
>  37. "On a certain occasion. Lord, I went to visit the sister
> Khema, and asked her the meaning of this matter, and she gave me the
> meaning in the very words, in the very syllables used by the Exalted
> One. Wonderful, Lord! Strange it is, Lord, how the explanation both of
> Master and disciple will agree, will harmonise, in spirit and in
> letter, how they will not be inconsistent,--that is, in any word about
> the highest.  
>  38. "Well, Lord, now we must be going. We are busy folk. We have
> many things to do."  
>  39. "Do now what you think it is time for, maharajah."  
>  40. Thereupon the Rajah Pasenadi of Kosala was delighted with the
> words of the Exalted One, and welcomed them. And he rose from his
> seat, saluted the Exalted One by the right, and went away.
>
> SECTION TWO--KARMA  
>   
> § 1. Is the Buddhist Doctrine of Karma the same as the Brahminic
> Doctrine?
>
>  1. There is no doctrine in the Buddha's Dhamma which has created
> so much confusion as this doctrine of Karma.  
>  2. What is its place in the Buddha's Dhamma, and what is its
> significance which has already been told?  
>  3. Ignorant Hindus, out of sheer want of understanding, say by
> comparing merely the similarity of words, that Buddhism is the same as
> Brahmanism or Hinduism.  
>  4. The educated and orthodox section of the Brahmins also do the
> same. They do so deliberately, to mislead the ignorant masses.  
>  5. The educated Brahmins know full well that the Buddhist Law of
> Karma is quite different from the Brahminic Law of Karma. Yet they
> keep on saying that Buddhism is the same as Brahmanism and Hinduism.  
>  6. The similarity in terminology gives them an easy handle for
> their false and malicious propaganda.  
>  7. It is, therefore, necessary to examine the position closely.  
>  8. The Buddha's Law of Karma, however much may be similarity of
> words cannot be the same in its connotation as the Brahminic Law of
> Karma.  
>  9. The premises of the two are so widely different, indeed so
> widely opposed that the result of the two cannot be the same. They
> must be different.  
>  10. The principles of the Hindu Law of Karma may be stated
> seriatim \[=systematically\] for convenience.  
>  11. The Hindu Law of Karma is based on the soul. The Buddhist is
> not. In fact, there is no soul in Buddhism.  
>  12. The Brahminic Law of Karma is hereditary.  
>  13. It goes on from life to life. This is so because of the
> transmigration of the soul.  
>  14. This cannot be true of the Buddhist Law of Karma. This is also
> because there is no soul.  
>  15. The Hindu Law of Karma is based on the existence of a soul
> which is distinct from the body. When the body dies, the soul does not
> die. The soul flies away.  
>  16. This is not true of the Buddhist Law of Karma.  
>  17. According to the Hindu Law of Karma, what happens when a man
> does a karma is this: his act produces two-fold results. It affects
> the doer; and secondly it produces an impress upon his soul.  
>  18. Each act he does produces an impress upon his soul.  
>  19. When a man dies and when his soul escapes, the soul is full of
> such impressions.  
>  20. It is these impressions which determine his birth and status
> in his future life.  
>  21. This Hindu theory is inconsistent with the Buddhist theory of
> no-soul.  
>  22. For these reasons, the Buddhist doctrine of Karma cannot be,
> and is not, the same as the Hindu doctrine of Karma.  
>  23. It is therefore simply foolish to talk about the Buddhist
> doctrine of Karma being the same as the Brahminic doctrine of Karma.  
>  24. All that one can say is, beware of this jugglery.
>
>   
> § 2. Did the Buddha believe in Past Karma having effect on Future
> Life?
>
>  1. The Law of Karma was enunciated by the Buddha. He was the first
> to say: "Reap as you sow."  
>  2. He was so emphatic about the Law of Karma that he maintained
> that there could be no moral order unless there was a stern observance
> of the Law of Karma.  
>  3. The Buddha's Law of Karma applied only to Karma and its effect
> on present life.  
>  4. There is, however, an extended doctrine of Karma. According to
> it, Karma includes Karma done in past life or lives.  
>  5. If a man is born in a poor family, it is because of his past
> bad karma. If a man is born in a rich family, it is because of his
> past good karma.  
>  6. If a man is born with a congenital defect, it is because of his
> past bad karma.  
>  7. This is a very pernicious doctrine. For in this interpretation
> of karma there is no room left for human effort. Everything is
> predetermined for him by his past karma.  
>  8. This extended doctrine is often found to be attributed to the
> Buddha.  
>  9. Did the Buddha believe in such a doctrine?  
>  10. To examine this extended doctrine properly, it is better to
> change the language in which it is usually expressed.  
>  11. Instead of saying that past karma is transmitted, it should be
> better if it was said that past karma is inherited.  
>  12. This change of language enables us to test it by the law of
> heredity. At the same time it does no harm to the doctrine, either to
> its *de jure* or *de facto* connotation.  
>  13. This restatement makes it possible to pose the two questions
> which could not otherwise be posed, and without answering which the
> matter could not be made clear.  
>  14. The first question is, how is past karma inherited? What is
> the process?  
>  15. The second question is, what is the nature of past karma in
> terms of heredity? Is it an inherent characteristic, or \[an\]
> acquired characteristic?  
>  16. What do we inherit from our parents?  
>  17. Starting with science, the new individual begins when a sperm
> enters the egg. Fertilisation consists in fusion of the head of the
> sperm with the nucleus of the egg.  
>  18. Each human being takes its origin from the union of two bits
> of living matter, an egg from the mother which has been fertilised by
> a single sperm from the father.  
>  19. That human birth is genetic is told by the Buddha to a Yakkha
> who came to discuss the matter with him.  
>  20. The Exalted One was then staying near Rajagraha, on the hill
> called Indra's Peak.  
>  21. Now that Yakkha drew near to the Exalted One and addressed him
> as follows:
>
> > Material form is not the living soul'.  
> > So says the Enlightened One. Then how doth soul possess this body?  
> > Whence to soul doth come  
> > Our bunch of bones and bowels?  
> > How doth soul within the mother-cave suspended bide?
>
>  22. To this the Exalted One replied:
>
> > At first the *Kalala* takes birth, and thence the *abudde*.  
> > Therefrom the *pesi* grows,  
> > Developing as *ghana* in its turn.  
> > Now in the *ghana* doth appear the hair,  
> > The down, the nails.  
> > And whatsoever food and drink the mother of him takes,  
> > thereby the man in mother's womb doth live and grow.
>
>  23. But the Hindu doctrine differs.  
>  24. It says that the body is genetic. But the soul is not. It is
> implanted into the body from outside--the doctrine is unable to
> specify the source.  
>  25. Turning to the second question as to what is the nature of
> past karma, it must be determined whether it is an inherent
> characteristic or an acquired characteristic.  
>  26. Unless an answer to this question is forthcoming, it cannot be
> tested by the scientific theory of heredity.  
>  27. But assuming there is an answer one way or the other to this
> question, how is it possible to get any help from science \[as to\]
> whether it is a sensible theory or senseless theory?  
>  28. According to science, a child inherits the characteristics of
> his parents.  
>  29. In the Hindu doctrine of karma a child inherits nothing from
> its parents except the body. The past karma in the Hindu doctrine is
> the inheritance of the child by the child and for the child.  
>  30. The parents contributes nothing. The child brings
> everything.  
>  31. Such a doctrine is nothing short of an absurdity.  
>  32. As shown above, the Buddha did not believe in such an
> absurdity.  
>  33. "Yes, if it were not reborn; but if it were, no."  
>  34. "Give me an illustration."  
>  35. "Suppose, O king, a man were to steal another man's mangoes,
> would the thief deserve punishment?"  
>  36. "Yes."  
>  37. "But he would not have stolen the mangoes the other set in the
> ground. Why would he deserve punishment?  
>  38. "Because those he stole were the result of those that were
> planted."  
>  39. "Just so, great king, this name-and-form commits deeds, either
> pure or impure, and by that karma another name-and-form is reborn. And
> therefore is it not set free from its evil deeds?"  
>  40. "Very good, Nagasena!"  
>  41. The king said, "When deeds are committed, Nagasena, by one
> name-and-form, what becomes of those deeds?"  
>  42. "The deeds would follow it, O king, like a shadow that never
> leaves it."  
>  43. "Can anyone point out those deeds, saying: 'Here are those
> deeds, or there?'  
>  44. "No "  
>  45. "Give me an illustration."  
>  46. "Now what do you think, O king? Can anyone point out the
> fruits which a tree has not yet produced, saying:  
>  47. 'Here they are, or there?'"  
>  48. "Certainly not, sir."  
>  49. "Just so, great king; so long as the continuity of life is not
> cut off, it is impossible to point out the deeds that are done."  
>  50. "Very good, Nagasena."
>
>   
> § 3. Did the Buddha believe in Past Karma having effect on Future
> Life? —concluded
>
>  1. The Buddha's doctrine of Past Karma is thus in keeping with
> science.  
>  2. He did not believe in the inheritance of Past Karma.  
>  3. How can he, having held to the view that birth is genetic, and
> whatever inheritance comes to the child, it comes through its
> parents?  
>  4. Apart from logic there is more direct evidence on the point
> contained in a sutta called the Cula-Dukkha-Khanda-Sutta which
> contains a dialogue between the Buddha and the Jains.  
>  5. In this dialogue this is what the Buddha says: "Niganthas, you
> have done evil in the past; extirpate it by these severe austerities.
> Every present restraint on body, speech, and mind will hereafter undo
> the evil doings of the past. Hence, by expelling through penance all
> past misdeeds, and by not committing fresh misdeeds, the future
> becomes cleared; with the future cleared, the past is wiped out; with
> the past wiped out, ill is no more; with ill no more, (painful)
> feelings are no more; and with painful feelings now no more, all will
> be outworn. This teaching commends and approves itself to us, and we
> rejoice in it."  
>  6. Thereupon, I said to those Niganthas, "Do you know, reverend
> sirs, whether you had an existence before this or you were not
> non-existent?"  
>  7. "No, Sir."  
>  8. "Do you know that, in a former existence, you were guilty, and
> not guiltless, of misdeeds?"  
>  9. "No."  
>  10. "Do you know that (in that former existence) you were guilty,
> and not guiltless, of this or that specific misdeed?"  
>  11. "No."  
>  12. Secondly the Buddha asserts that the status of a man may be
> governed not so much by heredity as by his environment.  
>  13. In the Devadaha-Sutta, this is what the Buddha says: "Some
> recluses and Brahmins there are who affirm and hold the view that,
> whatsoever the individual experiences--be it \[=they\] pleasant or
> unpleasant or neither--all comes from former actions. Hence, by
> expiation and purge of former misdeeds, and by not committing fresh
> misdeeds, nothing accrues for the future; the misdeeds die away; as
> misdeeds die away, ill dies away; as ill dies away, feelings die away;
> and as feelings die away, all will wear out and pass. This is what the
> Niganthas affirm.  
>  14. "If it is because of their birth's environment that creatures
> experience pleasure and pain, the Niganthas are blameworthy, and they
> are also blameworthy, if environment is not the cause."  
>  15. Now these statements of the Buddha are very relevant. How
> could the Buddha throw doubt on past karma, if he believed in it? How
> could the Buddha maintain \[that\] pain and pleasure in \[the\]
> present life being \[=is\] due to environment, if he believed that it
> was due to past karma?  
>  16. The doctrine of past karma is a purely Brahminic doctrine.
> Past karma taking effect in \[the\] present life is quite consistent
> with the Brahminic doctrine of soul, the effect of karma on soul. But
> it is quite inconsistent with the Buddhist doctrine of non-soul.  
>  17. It has been bodily introduced into Buddhism by someone who
> wanted to make Buddhism akin to Hinduism, or who did not know what the
> Buddhist doctrine was.  
>  18. This is one reason why it must be held that the Buddha could
> not have preached such a doctrine.  
>  19. There is another and a more general reason why it must be held
> that the Buddha could not have preached such a doctrine.  
>  20. The basis of the Hindu doctrine of past karma as the regulator
> of future life is an iniquitous doctrine. What could have been the
> purpose of inventing such a doctrine?  
>  21. The only purpose one can think of is to enable the state or
> the society to escape responsibility for the condition of the poor and
> the lowly.  
>  22. Otherwise, such an inhuman and absurd doctrine could never
> have been invented.  
>  23. It is impossible to imagine that the Buddha, who was known as
> the Maha Karunika, could have supported such a doctrine.
>
> SECTION THREE--AHIMSA  
>   
> § 1. The different ways in which it was interpreted and followed
>
>  1. Ahimsa, or non-killing, forms a very important part of the
> Buddha's teachings.  
>  2. It is intimately connected with Karuna and Maitri.  
>  3. The question has, however, been raised whether His Ahimsa was
> absolute in its obligation, or only relative. Was it only a principle?
> Or was it a rule?  
>  4. People who accept the Buddha's teachings find it difficult to
> accept Ahimsa as an absolute obligation. They say that such a
> definition of Ahimsa involves the sacrifice of good for evil, the
> sacrifice of virtue for vice.  
>  5. This question requires to be clarified. There is no subject
> which is a matter of greater confusion than this subject of Ahimsa.  
>  6. How have the people of Buddhist countries understood and
> practised Ahimsa?  
>  7. This is an important question which must be taken into
> account.  
>  8. The monks of Ceylon fought against, and asked the people of
> Ceylon to fight against, the foreign invaders.  
>  9. On the other hand the monks of Burma refused to fight against
> the foreign invaders, and asked the Burmese people not to fight.  
>  10. The Burmese people eat eggs but not fish.  
>  11. This is how Ahimsa is understood and followed.  
>  12. Recently the German Buddhist Association passed a resolution
> by which they accepted all the Panch Silas except the first, which
> deals with Ahimsa.  
>  13. This is the position about the Doctrine of Ahimsa.
>
>   
> § 2. True Meaning of Ahimsa
>
>  1. What does Ahimsa mean?  
>  2. The Buddha has nowhere given any definition of Ahimsa. In fact
> he has very seldom, if at all, referred to the subject in specific
> terms.  
>  3. One has, therefore to spell out his intention from
> circumstantial evidence.  
>  4. The first circumstantial evidence on the point is that the
> Buddha had no objection to eating meat, if it was offered to him as
> part of his alms.  
>  5. The monk can eat meat offered to him, provided he was not a
> party to the killing of it.  
>  6. He resisted the opposition of Devadatta, who insisted that the
> monks should be prohibited from eating meat given to them by way of
> alms.  
>  7. The next piece of evidence on the point is that he was only
> opposed to the killing of animals in yajna (sacrifice). This he has
> himself said.  
>  8. Ahimsa Permo Dharma is an extreme Doctrine. It is a Jain
> Doctrine. It is not a Buddhist Doctrine.  
>  9. There is another piece of evidence which is more direct than
> circumstantial, which almost amounts to a definition of Ahimsa. He has
> said: "Love all, so that you may not wish to kill any." This is a
> positive way of stating the principle of Ahimsa.  
>  10. From this it appears that the doctrine of Ahimsa does not say
> "Kill not." It says, "Love all."  
>  11. In the light of these statements, it is quite easy to have a
> clear understanding of what the Buddha meant by Ahimsa.  
>  12. It is quite clear that Buddha meant to make a distinction
> between will to kill and need to kill.  
>  13. He did not ban killing where there was need to kill.  
>  14. What he banned was killing where there was nothing but the
> will to kill.  
>  15. So understood, there is no confusion in the Buddhist doctrine
> of Ahimsa.  
>  16. It is a perfectly sound or moral doctrine which everyone must
> respect.  
>  17. No doubt he leaves it to every individual to decide whether
> the need to kill is there. But with whom else could it be left? Man
> has Pradnya, and he must use it.  
>  18. A moral man may be trusted to draw the line at the right
> point.  
>  19. Brahminism has in it the will to kill.  
>  20. Jainism has in it the will never to kill.  
>  21. The Buddha's Ahimsa is quite in keeping with his middle
> path.  
>  22. To put it differently, the Buddha made a distinction between
> Principle and Rule. He did not make Ahimsa a matter of Rule. He
> enunciated it as a matter of Principle or way of life.  
>  23. In this he no doubt acted very wisely.  
>  24. A principle leaves you freedom to act. A rule does not. Rule
> either breaks you, or you break the rule.
>
>   
> SECTION FOUR--TRANSMIGRATION
>
>  1. The Blessed Lord preached that there was rebirth. But the
> Blessed Lord also preached that there was no transmigration.  
>  2. There were not wanting people who criticised the Lord for
> preaching what they regarded as two such contradictory doctrines.  
>  3. How can there be rebirth unless there is transmigration? asked
> the critics.  
>  4. There is here a case of rebirth without transmigration, they
> said. Can this be?  
>  5. There is no contradiction. There can be rebirth, although there
> is no transmigration.  
>  6. This has been well explained by Nagasena in his replies to the
> questions of King Milinda.  
>  7. Milinda, King of Bactria, asked Nagasena, "Did the Buddha
> believe in Rebirth (Transmigration)?"  
>  8. His reply was "Yes."  
>  9. "Is this not a contradiction?"  
>  10. Nagasena replied, "No."  
>  11. "Can there be rebirth without a soul?"  
>  12. Nagasena said, "Of course, yes, there can be."  
>  13. "Explain how it can be."  
>  14. The king said, "Where there is no transmigration, Nagasena,
> can there be rebirth?"  
>  15. "Yes, there can."  
>  16. "But how can that be? Give me an illustration."  
>  17. "Suppose a man, O king, were to light a lamp from another
> lamp--can it be said that the one transmigrates from, or to, the
> other?"  
>  18. "Certainly not."  
>  19. "Just so, great king, is rebirth without transmigration."  
>  20. "Give me a further illustration."  
>  21. "Do you recollect, great king, having learnt, when you were a
> boy, some verse or other from your teacher?"  
>  22. "Yes. I recollect that."  
>  23. "Well then, did that verse transmigrate from your teacher?"  
>  24. "Certainly not."  
>  25. "Just so, great king, is rebirth without transmigration."  
>  26. "Very good, Nagasena!"  
>  27. The king said, "Is there such a thing, Nagasena, as the
> soul?"  
>  28. "In the highest sense, O king, there is no such thing."  
>  29. "Very good, Nagasena!"
>
>   
> SECTION FIVE--CAUSES OF THIS MISUNDERSTANDING
>
>  1. What the Buddha preached was heard by his audience, which
> largely consisted of the Bhikkus.  
>  2. It is the Bhikkus who reported to the people at large what the
> Buddha had said on any particular matter.  
>  3. The art of writing had not yet developed. The Bhikkus had
> therefore to memorise what they had heard. Not every Bhikku cared to
> memorise what he heard. But there were some that had made it their
> profession to memorise. They were called Bhanakas.  
>  4. The Buddhist canonical literature is as vast as \[an\] ocean.
> To memorise all this was indeed a great feat.  
>  5. In reporting the Buddha, it has often been found that he has
> been misreported.  
>  6. Many cases of misreporting had been brought to the knowledge of
> the Buddha while he was alive.  
>  7. Reference may be made by way of illustration to five such
> cases. One is mentioned in the Alagaddupama Sutta and the other in the
> Maha-Kamma-Vibhanga Sutta, a third in the Kannakatthala Sutta, \[a\]
> fourth in the Maha-Tanha-Sankhya Sutta, and\[a\] fifth in the Jivaka
> Sutta.  
>  8. There were perhaps many more such cases of misreporting. For we
> find that even the Bhikkus going \[=went\] to the Buddha, asking him
> to tell them what they should do in such contingencies.  
>  9. The cases of misreporting are common with regard to karma and
> rebirth.  
>  10. These doctrines have also a place in the Brahminic religion;
> consequently, it was easy for the Bhanakas to incorporate the
> Brahminic tenets into the Buddhist Religion.  
>  11. One has therefore to be very careful in accepting what is said
> in the Buddhist canonical literature as being the word of the
> Buddha.  
>  12. There is, however, one test which is available.  
>  13. If there is anything which could be said with confidence it
> is: He was nothing if not rational, if not logical. Anything therefore
> which is rational and logical, other things being equal, may be taken
> to be the word of the Buddha.  
>  14. The second thing is that the Buddha never cared to enter into
> a discussion which was not profitable for man's welfare. Therefore
> anything attributed to the Buddha which did not relate to man's
> welfare cannot be accepted to be the word. of the Buddha.  
>  15. There is a third test. It is that the Buddha divided all
> matters into two classes: those about which he was certain, and those
> about which he was not certain. On matters which fell into class I, he
> has stated his views definitely and conclusively. On matters which
> fell into class II, he has expressed his views, but they are only
> tentative views.  
>  16. In discussing the three questions about which there is doubt
> and difference, it is necessary to bear these tests in mind, before
> deciding what the view of the Buddha was thereon.
