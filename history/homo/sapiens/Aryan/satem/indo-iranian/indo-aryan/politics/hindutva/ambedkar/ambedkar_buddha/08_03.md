> § 1. His Dislike of Poverty
>
> 1\. Once the Exalted One was dwelling near Shravasti in Jeta's grove,
> at Anathapindika's park; and there Anathapindika, the householder,
> came and visited him and after saluting, sat down at one side. So
> seated, he asked the Exalted One to explain why one should acquire
> riches.  
>  2. "Since you ask me, I will explain.  
>  3. "Take the case of \[an\] Ariyan disciple with riches gotten by
> work and zeal, gathered by the strength of the arm, earned by the
> sweat of the brow; justly obtained in a lawful way; he makes himself
> happy \[and\] glad, and keeps that great happiness; he makes his
> parents happy \[and\] glad, and keeps them so; so likewise his wife
> and children, his slaves, workfolk and men. This is the first reason
> for getting riches.  
>  4. "When riches are thus gotten, he makes his friends and
> companions happy \[and\] glad, and keeps them so. This is the second
> reason.  
>  5. "Again, when riches are thus gotten, ill-luck from fire and
> water, rajas and robbers, enemies and heirs, is warded off, and he
> keeps his goods in safety. This is the third reason.  
>  6. "Then, when riches are thus gotten, he makes the five
> oblations--that is to say, oblations to kin, guests, pitaras, rajas,
> and devas. This is the fourth reason.  
>  7. "Moreover, when riches are thus gotten, the householder
> institutes offerings, of lofty aim, celestial ripening to happiness,
> leading heavenward, for all those recluses and godly men who abstain
> from pride and indolence, who bear all things in patience and
> humility, each mastering self, each calming self, each perfecting
> self. This is the fifth reason for getting rich."  
>  8. Anathapindika well understood that the Blessed Lord did not
> comfort the poor by praising their poverty, nor did he sublimate
> poverty as a happy state for man to live in.
>
>   
> § 2. His Dislike of the Acquisitive Instinct
>
>  1. The Exalted One was once staying in the town of Kammassadamma,
> in the country of \[the\] Kurus.  
>  2. The venerable Ananda came to where the Exalted One was, bowed
> in salutation before him, and took a seat on one side.  
>  3. And so seated he said, "Marvellous is this law of causation
> which has been taught by the Blessed One! It is so deep. To me it
> seems as clear as clear can be."  
>  4. "Say not so, Ananda, say not so! Deep is this doctrine of
> events arising from causes. It is through not understanding this
> doctrine, through not penetrating it, that this generation has become
> a tangled skein, a matted ball of thread, unable to overpass the way
> of woe.  
>  5. "I have said that craving is the cause of grasping. Where there
> is no craving of any sort or kind whatever by anyone for anything,
> would there be any arising of grasping?"  
>  6. "There would not, Lord."  
>  7. "Craving gives rise to pursuit of gain.  
>  8. "Pursuit of gain gives rise to desire and passion.  
>  9. "Desire and passion give rise to tenacity.  
>  10. Tenacity gives rise to possession.  
>  11. "Possession gives rise to avarice and more possession.  
>  12. "Possessions lead to keeping watch and ward over
> possessions.  
>  13. "Many a bad and wicked state of things arise\[s\] from keeping
> watch and ward over possession; such as blows and wounds, strife,
> quarrelling, slander, and lies.  
>  14. "This is the chain of causation, Ananda. If there was no
> craving, would there arise pursuit of gain? If there was no pursuit of
> gain, would there arise passion? If there was no passion, would there
> arise tenacity? If there would be no tenacity, would there arise the
> love for private possessions? If there would be no possession, would
> there arise avarice for more possession?"  
>  15. "There would not, Lord."  
>  16. "If there would not be the love of private possession, would
> there not be peace?"  
>  17. "There would be, Lord."  
>  18. "I recognise the earth as earth. But I have no craving for
> it," said the Lord.  
>  19. Therefore it is, say I, that by extirpating all cravings, by
> not lusting after them, but by destroying and abandoning and
> renouncing them all, that I acquired enlightenment.  
>  20. "Seek to be partakers, brethren, not of the world's goods but
> of my doctrines. For craving brings about attachment, and attachment
> enslaves the mind."  
>  21. In these words did the Blessed Lord explain to Ananda and the
> brethren the evils of the acquisitive instinct.
>
>   
> § 3. His Joy at the Beautiful
>
>  1. The Buddha was so fond of the beautiful that he might well bear
> an alias and be called Buddha, the Lover of the Beautiful.  
>  2. So he preached to his followers: "Be in the company of the
> lovely."  
>  3. Addressing the bhikkhus, he said:  
>  4. "Monks, I know not of any other single thing of such power to
> cause the arising of good states if not yet arisen, or the waning of
> evil states already arisen, as friendship with the lovely.  
>  5. "In one who is a friend of what is lovely, good states not
> arisen do arise and evil states already arisen wane. Evil states and
> devotion to evil states wanes, lack of devotion to good states
> disappears, good states and devotion thereto arise; lack of devotion
> to evil states increases.  
>  6. "Monks, I know not of any other single thing of such power to
> prevent the arising of the limbs of wisdom, if not yet arisen, or, if
> they have already arisen, to prevent their reaching fulfilment by
> cultivation thereof, as unsystematic attention.  
>  7. "In him who practices unsystematic attention, monks, the limbs
> of wisdom if not yet arisen, arise not, and if arisen they reach not
> fulfilment by cultivation thereof.  
>  8. "Of slight account, monks, is the loss of such things as
> relatives. Miserable indeed among losses is the loss of wisdom.  
>  9. "Of slight account, monks, is the increase of such things as
> relatives. Chief of all the increases is that of wisdom.  
>  10. "Wherefore I say, monks, ye should train yourselves thus: 'We
> will increase in wisdom.' You must train yourselves to win that.  
>  11. "Of slight account, monks, is the increase of such things as
> wealth. Chief of all the increases is that of wisdom. Wherefore I say,
> monks, thus, must ye train yourselves. 'We will increase in wisdom.'
> You must train yourselves to win that.  
>  12. "Of slight account, monks, is the loss of such things as
> reputation. Miserable indeed is the loss of wisdom."
>
>   
> § 4. His Love for the Lovely
>
>  1. Once the Exalted One was staying among the Sakyans at Sakkara,
> a Sakyan township.  
>  2. Then the venerable Ananda came to the Exalted One, saluted him
> and sat down at one side. So seated, the venerable Ananda said this:  
>  3. "The half of the holy life, Lord, is friendship with what is
> lovely, association with what is lovely, intimacy with what is
> lovely!"  
>  4. "Say not so, Ananda! Say not so, Ananda! It is the whole, not
> the half, of the holy life--this friendship, this association, this
> intimacy with what is lovely.  
>  5. "Of a monk who is a friend, an associate, an intimate of what
> is lovely we may expect this: that he will develop the Ariyan
> eightfold way, that he will make much of the Ariyan eightfold way.  
>  6. "And how, Ananda, does such a monk develop and make much of the
> Ariyan eightfold way?  
>  7. "Herein, Ananda, he cultivates the right view, which is based
> on detachment, on dispassion, on cessation, which ends in
> self-surrender. He cultivates the right aim, which is so based and
> concerned; likewise right speech, right action, right living, right
> effort, right mindfulness, and right concentration, which ends in
> self-surrender.  
>  8. "That, Ananda, is how a monk who is a friend, an associate,
> anintimate of what is lovely, cultivates and makes much of the Ariyan
> eightfold way.  
>  9. "This is the method, Ananda, by which you are to understand how
> the whole of this holy life consists in friendship, in association, in
> intimacy, with what is lovely.  
>  10. "Indeed, Ananda, beings liable to decay, liable to death,
> liable to grief, woe, lamentation, and despair, are liberated
> therefrom because of their friendship with what is lovely.  
>  11. "It is by this method, Ananda, that you are to understand how
> the whole of this holy life consists in friendship, in association, in
> intimacy with what is lovely."
