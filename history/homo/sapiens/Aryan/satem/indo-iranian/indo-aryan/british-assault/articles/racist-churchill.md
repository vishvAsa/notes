Afghanistan: Churchill said “all those who resist will be killed without quarter”, because the Pashtuns need “recognise the superiority of race” when referring to his tone spent in Afghanistan

Cuba: in 1896, Churchill wrote he was concerned Cuba would turn into “another black republic”. By “another”, he was referring to Haiti, who were the first nation to abolish slavery in modern times.

South Africa: Churchill created concentration camps in which 48,000 men, women and children died as a result of starvation and disease during the Boer War. He also planted the seed to strip black people of their voting rights in June 1906.

Ireland: He said “We have always found the Irish a bit odd. They refuse to be English.” Churchill sent thugs to terrorise Irish civilians/properties, and also coined the Croke Park massacre and ‘Bloody Sunday’. He ordered “machine-fire and bombs” to “scatter and stampede”

Saudi Arabia: He said in 1921 that Ibn Saud’s followers “hold it as an article of duty, as well as of faith, to kill all who do not share their opinions and to make slaves of their wives and children”. He wrote “admiration for Ibn Saud was deep, because of his unfailing loyalty”

Iraq: “I am strongly in favour of using poisoned gas against the uncivilized tribes. It would spread a lively terror.” he said on using gas attacks in the middle east. He called for the use of “some kind of asphyxiating bombs” against ‘Arabs’ (a testament to his ignorance)

Palestine: Arabs in Palestine were a “lower manifestation”, and the “dog in a manger has the final right to the manger”, referring to Palenstinian Arabs. A statue of Churchill was subsequently erected in Jerusalem to honour his aid to the Zionist movement.

India: Churchill claimed “I hate Indians. They are a beastly people with a beastly religion”. Churchill seized millions of tons of inessential rice to send the Middle East. Four million Bengals starved to death, and he said ‘famine’ was their own fault “for breeding like rabbits”.+++(5)+++

Greece: in 1944, Churchill ordered the massacre of anti-Nazi protesters (the very people who ran the Nazi’s out of Greece). Churchill supported the new right-wing government and Nazi collaborators whom he opently sympathised with and helped into power.

Egypt: “tell them that if we have any more of their cheek we will set the Jews on them and drive them into the gutter, from which they should never have emerged” - Churchill on the Egyptian war in 1951

Kenya: In 1951, Churchill ordered the removal of locals from the fertile highlands as they were only for “white colonial settlers”. He branded the locals as “bl*ckamoors”, and placed 150,000 men, women and children in concentration camps. Rape and torture were regularly practiced. 

“I do not admit that a great wrong has been done to the Red Indians of America or the black people of Australia. No wrong has been done to these people by the fact that a stronger race, a higher-grade race, a more worldly wise race, has come in and taken their place”. - Churchill

Churchill admired Hitler, praising “the courage, preservearance and the vital force which enabled him to overcome all the resistances which barred his path.” Leo Amery, British Secretary of State in India “didn’t see much difference between Churchill’s outlook and Hitler’s”. Churchill never waged a warm against fascism, he waged a war against a threat to his empire. Himself and Hitler shared a common worst enemy in communism, stating “the Communists are the main foe.” Should he even be labelled ‘the lesser of two evils’ due to their similarities?
