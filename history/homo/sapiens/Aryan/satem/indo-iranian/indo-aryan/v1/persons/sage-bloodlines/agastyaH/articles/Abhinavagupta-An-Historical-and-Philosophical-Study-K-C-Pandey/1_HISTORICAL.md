CHAPTER 1. 

LIFE OF ABHINAVAGUPTA. 

PRELIMINARY. 

Abhinava, it appears, knew the importance of biogra phical information about a writer in understanding his works. He has, therefore, not remained silent about himself, like Kālidāsa, about whose date scholars differ by centuries, or like Bhāsa, whose very authorship of his own dramas is now a matter of keen controversy. He has given a sketch, though very brief, of his person, descent and the then social conditions in the concluding portions of his two works, the Tantraloka and the Parātrimśikā Vivarana. This sketch, when coupled with the information gathered from the stray references to his life in the vast literature that he, his pupils, his commentators and the followers of his theories have produced, gives us a more or less connected and a little detailed, though still incomplete, account of his life. It can be fairly completed but only with the help of an oral tradition which is current down to this day in a few learned Brāhmana families as well as in a few muslim homes in Kashmir. But an oral tradition, though old and persistent, is after all an oral tradition, and as such cannot have the same value in the eyes of a historian as the evidence of inscriptions or literary works. However, in the case of Abhinava, it is possible for us to know exactly the forces and influences which produced such a mind, even if we confine ourselves to well-authenticated facts. For the purpose of understanding his writings we need no more, 

CHAPTER I. 

Two ABHINAVAGUPTAS. 

The Abhinavagupta, studied in the following pages, is a different person from his namesake who was a Sākta contemporary of Sankarācārya. The only source of infor mation about the other Abhinavagupta is the Sankara Digvijaya of Madhava, which is noticed under a slightly different name "Sūkşma Sankara Vijayas" in Dr. Aufrecht's catalogue. It gives the following account of him : 

Hel belonged to Kāmarūpa (Assam). He was a Sākta and wrote a sāktabhāșya, probably a commentary on the Vedānta Sūtra of Bādarāyaṇa, from the Sākta point of view. He was a great opponent of the monistic theory of Sankara. He engaged Sankara in a controversial dis cussion (Šāstrārtha) when the latter reached Assam in the course of his Digvijaya. In that he was defeated and so, according to the then prevalent practice, became a disciple of the victor. Like our Kashmirian Abhinavagupta, his Sākta namesake also is referred to as an ācārya”. 

Our object in giving the above account is to point out that if Madhava's testimony in reference to the Sākta Abhinavagupta is to be considered reliable, he should not be confused with the Saiva Abhinavagupta of Kashmir. Their distance from each other is about two centuries. The former, if he was Sankara’s contemporary, must have lived in the last quarter of the 8th and the first half of the 9th century A. D., for, according to the generally accepted opinion, Sankara lived from 788 to 820 A. D.; and the latter, on the evidence of the dates of composition of the Krama and the Bhairava Stotras and the Brahati Vimarsini, given by the author himself, belonged to the second

half of the 10th and the first quarter of the 11th century A. D. In view of these facts we fail to understand why Dr. Aufrecht has included the Sāktabhāşya in the list of Kashmirian Abhinavagupta's works in his Catalogus Catalogo rum. This work, according to his own statement : "Sāktabhāşya, Quoted by Madhava. Oxf 258b" (C. C., P. 25) is no other than the one, the authorship of which is attributed to the Sakta Abhinavagupta by Madhava, as we have stated above. For, on page 258 of Catalogi Condicum Manuscriptum containing an extract from the Sankara Digvijaya which is referred to by our learned Doctor in the above quotation from Catalogus Catalogorum P. 25, the same passage is given as that on which our own account of the Sākta Abhinavagupta is based. It runs as follows: 

Tadanantarameşa Kamarūpān Adhigatyābhinavopaśabdaguptam Ajayat kila sāktabhāşyakāram Sa ca bhagno manasedamāluloce 

Oxf 2586 

We now leave it to our readers to form their own conclusion on this point. 

HIS ANCESTRY. 

The earliest ancestor of Abhinava, so far known to us, was Atrigupta. He lived in Antarvedi, the region between the Ganges and Yamuna, in the reign of king Yaśovarman of Kannauj (Circa 730-740 A. D.*)). He attained a very great fame for erudition in all the branches of learning in general and in the Saiva Sāstras in particular. King Lalitāditya of Kashmir (Circa 725-761) was so much 

1. P.T. V., 280. * E. H. I., 386. 

CHAPTER 1. 

impressed with his scholarship and so eager did he become to take him (Atrigupta) to his capital that soon after the conquest of King Yaśovarman he approached and requested Atrigupta to accompany him to Kashmir. And so earnest was the request that Atrigupta could not but accede to it. 

Thus the family, which after about two centuries, was to produce the Saiva Abhinavagupta, migrated from Kānyakubja to Kashmir. Therea spacious house was soon built by the king's order on a plot opposite the temple of Sitārśumaulin on the bank of river Vitastā (Jhelum) for the immigrant family to permanently settle, and a big jāgir was granted for its proper maintenance. After Atrigupta, we know nothing of the family for about hundred and fifty years. Abhinava has evidently left a gap between his earliest known ancestor, who migrated to Kashmir very shortly after king Lalitāditya's victory over Yaśovarman of Kannauj about 740 A. D. and his grand father Varāhagupta, whom we cannot place earlier than the beginning of the 10th century A. D. The language of the text, on which our conclusion is based, leaves very little doubt on this point. To show the distance of time between Atrigupta and Varāhagupta there is used the word "anvaya” (family) 3. In marked contrast with this, we find the word "ātmaja" used, to indicate the immediate descent of Cukhulaka, the father of Abhinava, from Varāhagupta. From the very brief description of the latter, it is evident that the successive generations had maintained the scholastic traditions of the learned family and that he (Varāhagupta) also was a great scholar and devout worshipper of Siva.

LIFE OF ABHINAVAGUPTA 

HIS PARENTS. 

His father, Narasimhagupta, alias Cukhulaka, was of great intellectual calibre, had equal proficiency in all the Sāstras and was a great devotee of Siva. The name of his mother was Vimalakalā 1. She was a very pious and religious lady. They were a happy couple and attended to household duties not because of any worldly attachment to them but simply because they were enjoined by the scripture. The family atmosphere was thus thoroughly religious and scholarly. 

In view of the facts stated above and supported by the authority of Abhinavagupta himself, quoted in full in Appendix (A), the statement of Pandit Madhusudan Kaul of the Kashmir Research Department in his introduction to the I. P. V., Vol. II, P. 7 about the name of Abhinava's father requires correction. His statement runs as follows: 

*He received instruction in the Pratyabhijñā Šāstra from his father Laksmanagupta, son of Narasimhagupta and pupil to Utpala" 

Lakşmanagupta, though undoubtedly a teacher of Abhinava in Pratyabhijñā was certainly not his father; nor was there a relation of father and son between Narasimha gupta and Lakşmanagupta. The father of the latter, according to the following statement of Abhinaya, was Utpalācārya : 

"Traiyambakaprasarasāgaravīcisomā nandātmajotpalajalakṣmaṇaguptanāthah."

CHAPTER 1. 

ABHINAVA AS A YOGINĪBHŮ. In and about the 10th and the 11th centuries the atmosphere in Kashmir was thoroughly surcharged with the spirit of religion. The people then believed in the efficacy of religious observances. All that was great and good was believed to be attainable by some kind of religious performance or other. For each worldly gain there was prescribed a separate elaborate ceremony. A king wishing to enlarge his kingdom, a student anxious to widen his knowledge, a father aspiring for a worthy son and a merchant desirous of prosperity in his business, each had to perform some special rite to bring about the speedy realisation of his desire. When failure came inspite of these observances, it was attributed to some flaw in the performance of the prescribed rite. Abhinava's literary greatness also, therefore, was naturally attributed not so much to his own exceptional natural intelligence and great assiduity as to a certain religious frame of mind in which his parents had united for his birth?. It is enjoined in the saiva scripture that the parents, desirous of a son, who in Saiva terminology is called Yoginībhū, should rise above all worldly ideas at the time of meeting and that the mother should identify herself with Śakti and the father with Siva. And it is believed that only a Yoginībhū can properly understand and intelligibly propound the Saiva monism. According to Jayaratha, the popular idea of Abhinava's being yognībhū was based upon Abhinava's own authority. For, he, as Jayaratha interprets, refers to this fact in the very first verse of the Tantrāloka. 

PROBABLE TIME OF HIS BIRTH. The era, used in the works of Kashmir writers from the earliest time, is known as Saptarși. It began 25 years 

1. T. A. Comm., I, 14-5.LIFE OF ABHINAVAGUPTA 

after the commecement of Kali era, as we learn from Abhinava's own statement in the concluding verse of the Bphatī Vimarsins : 

"Iti navatitamesmin vatsarentye yugāmse Tithiếasijaladhisthe mārgaśīrşāvasāne Jagati vihitabodhām Iśvarapratyabhijñām Vyavrnuta paripūrņām preritah Sambhupādaih". 

It states that he finished the Brhatī Vimarsinī in the 90th year when 4115 years of Kali had elapsed. This year (1934) it is the 5035th year of the Kali and the 5010th year of the Saptarsi era, as any almanac will show. If we deduct 25 out of the figures, which stand for the Kali era at present, they will show the Saptarsi year. This shows that the word "navatitame" in the above quotation stands for 4090th of the Saptarsi era just as 34th, used to-day, would naturally mean 1934th A. D. 

There are two more works of Abhinava in which the dates of composition are given. One is the Bhairava Stava (appendix C) which was written on the 10th day of the darker half of Pauşain the year 68. And the other is the Krama Stotra (Appendix C) which was composed in praise of Siva on the 9th day of the darker half of Mārgaśīrşa? in the year 66. 

The years of composition of these Stotras refer to the Saptarsi era. The dates, therefore, of the earliest and the latest known works of Abhinava clearly show that the period of his literary activity extended over a quarter of a century from 4066 to 4090 of the Saptarsi era i. e. 990-1-1014 15 A. D. 

1. Bh. S. 2. K. S. 

CHAPTER I. 

There is no reason to believe that the Krama Stotra, though the earliest of the known dated works of Abhinava, was his first work. More on this point will be found in the chapter dealing with his works. It seems, therefore, that he began his literary career five years earlier i. e. in 985 A. D. And taking into consideration the extensive study that he made of various branches of learning, not privately but at the houses of so many teachers, and the maturity of style and judgment, found in his earliest work, it will be unreasonable to suppose that he began writing when he was only in his teens or early twenties. It will, therefore, not be wrong to say that he was born between 950 and 960 A. D. 

HIS CHILDHOOD AND EDUCATION. 

As a child he was sent to a neighbouring Pāthaśālā, located in a second story. Even there he showed signs of his future greatness, and deeply impressed his teachers with his exceptional intellectual power and fluency in speech. His name is ample testimony to that. It is said that the name Abhinavaguptapāda, by which our great writer is known, is not that which was given him by his parents but that which he received from his teachers in early school days for no other reason than that he was an intellectual giant and as such was an object of terror, like a serpent, to his young school fellows. This is what, according to Vāmanācārya, the author of the Bālabodhini, a commen tary on the Kāvyaprakāśa, Mammaţa means to convey by referring to our Abhinava as Abhinavaguptapadal” in his work. To this very fact Abhinava himself most probably refers in the following line : 

«Abhinavaguptasya kệtih seyam yasyoditā gurubhi rākhyā."

LIFE OF ABHINAVAGUPTA. 

ABHINAVAGUPTA, AN INCARNATION OF SEȘA, 

In South India there is a tradition, current among those who even now dance in strict accordance with the rules, given by Bharata in his Natya Sastra, that Abhinavagupta pāda was an incarnation of Seșa. This tradition seems to be another and later interpretation of the name "Abhina vaguptapāda". It was most probably suggested by the great reputation that he enjoyed, like Patamjali alias Seşa, for his thorough mastery of all the intricacies of grammar and his extraordinary skill and originality in dealing with the difficult grammatical problems. To his great proficiency in grammar he himself refers in the Tantrāloka as follows: 

“Pitrā sa sabdagahane krtasampraveśah." 

T. A., Ah. 37. (MS.) In this quotation the words "gahane" and "sam" are of special significance. This tradition found general acceptance among later generations, because it was imagined to have the support of his teachers also who gave him the epithet, Abhinavaguptapada, which can, without the least fear of contradiction, be interpreted as new Sesa." 

HIS TEACHERS. Great was his love of learning and endless and incessant was his endeavour for its acquisition. Knowledge for its own sake' was his motto. This he preached both by personal example and precept, as found in the T. A., VIII, 205-6. He held that even though one may be lucky enough to get a teacher who has attained perfection himself and can easily show the way to it to his disciple also, yet that is not sufficient reason for not approaching other teachers for the knowledge of other Agamas and other paths. This he has given as the only reason for his waiting upon teachers of other religions such as Buddhism and Jainism. 1

He approached the best teachers of his time in different subjects for the traditional and the most authoritative information. Such was his humility and devotion to them that they, out of sheer love for him, told him all the secrets of learning in their possession, and so well did he learn and retain all that he was taught and so well did he impress his teachers with his extensive study that all of them unanimously declared him to be an all-round ācārya. 

So insatiable was his thirst for learning that he found all its fountain heads in Kashmir insufficient to quench it. He, therefore, went outside the beautiful land of Kaśyapa in quest of a bigger fountain head. How many places outside the valley of Kashmir he visited and how many learned teachers he waited upon, there is no evidence just at present in hand to show. There is, however, no doubt that he went to Jalandhara? and learnt Kaulika3 literature and practices from Sambhunātha. In fact it was through Sambhunātha's teaching that he got peace and attained self-realisation. 

The following is the list of his teachers with the subject or subjects, which they taught, shown against each name :

HIS FAMILY AND ITS ATMOSPHERE. 

Besides his father and mother, his family consisted of an uncle, Vāmanagupta, a younger brother, Manoratha, and five cousins, Kşema, Utpala, Abhinava, Cakraka and Padmagupta. His uncle's name is included in the list of his teachers. In the Abhinava Bhāratī, Abhinava quotes his uncle who, therefore, seems to have written on poetics. His brother was deeply learned in all Sāstras and was the first to be favoured by Abhinava by being accepted as his disciple. And if the name Kşema be supposed to stand for Kșemarāja, the author of the Spanda Nirnaya and other works on Saivaism, and the others, classed with him, be also supposed to have had more or less similar qualities, then his cousins also seem to have been very highly educated. Whatever may have been their education, there is no doubt that they prized devotion

CHAPTER 1. 

to Siva above all things and considered all their wealth to be no better than a straw. Thus the whole family atmosphere was surcharged with the spirit of renunciation, zeal for advanced study and above all devotion to Siva. There was left nothing to be desired in the atmosphere, in which he passed his childhood, for the development of a healthy brain and of a spirit necessary for the great work that he had before him. 

SOME EVENTS IN THE FAMILY AND THEIR EFFECT ON 

HIS YOUNG MIND 

His mother was extremely dear to him. It was she alone who made home sweet for him. But unfortunately, or, as Abhinava took it, fortunately, she was snatched away by the cruel hands of death when he was a mere child.? Home, therefore, lost most of its charm for him, but not all, because his father was still there. To him he was tied with a double cord of filial and pupilary love. But soon after the death of his mother, his father also, though still young, renounced the world and took to a life of asceticism. These events seem to have taken place when he was studying literature (Sahitya). They turned his mind from all worldly attachments to devotion to Siva, so much so that he made up his mind never to marry'. That was the turning point in his life. That was the end of his literary study and life at home. Thenceforward, in order to feed his suddenly kindled flame of devotion with the oil of the āgamic lore, he spent his time in the houses of his āgamic teachers. His Tantraloka is a living testimony of the great zeal with which he pursued the study of the āgamas and of the unparalleled proficiency which he acquired in them.

HIS ASCETIC PERIOD. 

The period of preparation was now over. The natural gifts and the favourable circumstances had immensely helped him in thoroughly equipping himself for the memorable work that he was destined to accomplish. The long and healthy scholastic and religious tradition of his family unbroken for over two hundred years, the noble and scholarly life of his father and the perfectly religious life of his mother, the harmony and the healthy atmosphere of his family, his high education, his practical training in various kinds of yogic practices, his never-broken vow of perfect celibacy and the consequent indefatigable energy, his drinking at so many fountain heads of learning both in and outside Kashmir, his untiring efforts and their fruition in scholastic attainments and above all his great sacrifice of all the comforts of wordly life, all combined, gave him such an intellectual and spiritual power and made his pen so powerful that even to day he is recognised as the highest authority on the monistic Saivaism in respect both of its rituals and its philosophy, as well as on the poetical theories of Rasa and Dhvani. 

Thus equipped he began his life's work at a sufficiently mature age. What he has contributed to the philosophical literature of India, though at present ordinary people know him only as a writer on poetics, is not a production of a mere imaginative mind in an easy chair in a beautiful and a little secluded place, as so many persons think, but a record of personal experience, gained through continuous yogic experiments, carried on for years. If we carefully read even the few available works, out of so many that his extraordi narily powerful pen produced, we can trace out the successive stages in his spiritual attainment. Successively he worked

CHAPTER I. 

on the three systems which are known in the Saiva philoso phical literature as the Krama, the Trika (of which Praty abhijñā is only a branch) and the Kula. 

When from the study of literature his mind suddenly turned to devotion to Siva, it was Lakşmanagupta who first gave him intellectual satisfaction by feeding him with intellectual food in the form of an exposition of the Pratya bhijñāl. He taught Abhinava Krama Darśana also. This fact Jayaratha has established after a long controvertial discussion in his commentary on the Tantrāloka. There is circumstantial evidence enough to believe that he was taught Krama system first. In any case the earliest date of the Krama Stotra, to which reference has already been made, is a clear proof of his having first tried his spiritual experiments in accordance with the Kramic instructions. The attempt was not quite a failure, for, in the Kramakeli, which is probably Abhinava's first known work on the Krama system, he attributes his then spiritual greatness to his following the Kramic teachings. But it did not yield the expected result. He then tried the Trika system, but to what result, there is not enough evidence just at present in hand to show. There is, however, no doubt about this that the result of that also did not perfectly satisfy him, for, it is from the Kula system alone that he affirms to have got perfect satisfaction and peace. Because of this it is that we find in his works a more glowing tribute paid to Sambhunatha, his Kaulic teacher, than to any one else.5 That before writing the Tantraloka he had realised his identity with the Parama Siva and that it was due to

following Sambhunātha's teaching, he himself says in his introduction to the Tantrāloka : 

"Bodhānyapāśavişanutta dupāsanottha, de Bodhojjvalobhinavagupta idam karoti." V 

T. A., I, 16. 

The concluding line of the Paramārthasāra and Yogarāja's commentary on it give a very clear idea of the spiritual greatness attained by Abhinava, before he began writing, at least, his more important works. The passage runs as follows: 

aala 

WA H 

"Abhinavaguptena mayā śivacaranasmaranadīptena". 

P. S., 198. 

alo ama aun nmig "Sivasya paraśreyahsvabhāvasya svātmasthasya cidā- Akti nandaikamürteh yâni caraṇāni cidraśmayah teşām smaranath sabdādivişayagrahanakāle nibhālanam pratiksaņam svānu bhavāpramosah tena dīptah parāhantācamatkārabhā svaraḥ.. ..................iti upadeştuh samā vista maheśvara svabhāvonena uktaḥ syāt." 

This seems to be the foundation of the traditional belief amongst Kashmirian Pandits that Abhinavagupta was Bhairava incarnate. 

HIS MIRACULOUS POWERS. Human nature is always the same everywhere. We should, therefore, not be surprised at the suspicious eye with which the present generation looks at all claims to individual spiritual greatness, particularly because there are so many impostors abroad now. In the time of Abhinavagupta also people did not very easily believe in any such claim. It was, therefore, not without any reason, as the literary tradition says, that they looked upon Abhinava as Bhairava incarnate. Just as the enlightened people of the present time would not admit any body's claim to realisation of 

16 

CHAPTER I. 

identity with the Almighty unless he should show himself to be almighty, so did not the contemporaries of Abhinava. Following the authority of the Srīpūrva Šāstra he has himself given the five infallible signs of such a man' which can briefly be stated as follows: 

1. Unswerving devotion to Rudra. 2. Power of incantation (mantra siddhi) 3. Control over all the elements. 4. Capacity to accomplish the desired end. 5. Sudden dawning of the knowledge of all the 

Šāstras. And we learn from Jayaratha, who also bases his statement on the authority of his teacher whose verse he quotes, that Abhinava's contemporaries found all the above signs unmistakably present in him. This was the secret of his great influence with his contemporaries and of the unparalleled success as a writer in the field of both the Saiva philosophy and the poetics. 

CENTRES OF HIS ACTIVITY. 

We have had occasion to speak about the site of his ancestral home. In one of the MSS. of the T. A., belonging to Pandit Maheśvara Rājdān of Kashmir, a different reading of the passage, descriptive of the site where a house was built for Atrigupta, is found. It reads "Vaitasta mūrdhani" instead of "Vaitasta rodhasi" as in the MS. in the possession of the writer of these pages. The conclusion was easy and so once the exact spot of Abhinava's ancestral home was thought to have been discovered. The writer visited the place and found that there is a small village just above the source of Vitastā (Vaitasta mūrdhani) which even to this 

1. T. A. Comm., VIII, 136. 2. T. A. Comm., VIII, 137.LIFE OF ABHINAYAGUPTA 

17 

day is called Guttar Gunda or Guttal Gunda. Gunda is a common Kashmiri word for village and Guttar or Guttal can easily be supposed to be a corruption of Gupta with local affix ssp" or "l". But on a little more careful study of the text it was found that this interpretation does not suit the context. For, the word "tasmin" in the beginning of the verse1 stands for "Pravarapura", described in the preceding lines, the site of which has been identified within modern srinagar. The source of Vitastā is at a distance of over thirty miles from there. It cannot, therefore, reasonably be supposed to have been within Pravarapura. The reading "Vaitasta rodhasi" (on the bank of Vitastā), therefore, seems to be correct. There is, however, a way in which the other reading also can be explained, that is, by taking “Vaitasta mūrdhani" with "parikalpitabhūmisampat" and not with "nivāsam". The passage then will mean that the king, having granted a jagir to him above the source of Vitastā, got a house constructed for him in that part of Pravarapura, which, because of its being situated opposite the temple of Sitāmhsumaulin, was, in point of sanctity, better than any other. This appears to be quite probable. The evidence in hand, however, is too insufficient for any definite statement on the question. 

There being no evidence to the contrary, it is natural to suppose that he passed his childhood in his ancestral home. There is, however a definite statement regarding the place of composition of the Vārtika on the first verse of the Mālini Vijaya Tantra. It was composed in Pravarapura East. It seems Pravarapura also was divided into different parts and was called Pravarapura East and 

1. T. A., Ah. 37. (MS.) 2. M. V. V., 135.

CHAPTER I. 

so on, just as the different parts of Simla at the present time are known as Simla East and Simla West. Was this the same place as his ancestral home? Nothing can be said definitely, but the probability is that it was. In any case, from the reason that prompted Mandra to request Abhinava to shift to the former's cityl to write out a systematic guide to various paths to final emancipation, as found in the Trika literature, it is evident that it was not a fit place for undertaking such a great work as the writing of the Tantrāloka. Therefore, when the request was made and the necessity for a change was explained the latter agreed. The Tantrāloka was thus written not in the ancestral home of the author but in that of his loving disciple. 

THE LAST SCENE OF HIS EARTHLY EXISTENCE. 

Unlike what has been written so far, we have no other authority than that of a tradition for what we are going to write in the following few lines. We have not so far been able to trace any written authority on which this may have been originally based. The tradition, which, as we pointed out before, is current not only in old Pandit families but also in some of the old Muslim houses in the locality, says that on one day Abhinavagupta, after finishing his work, as he thought, along with twelve hundred disciples walked into the Bhairava cave and was never seen again. The cave is there even now. It is about five miles from Magam, a place midway between Srinagar and Gulmurg. A village in its neighbourhood and a brook, running down below the hill, wherein the cave is, both are known by the name of Bhiruva and so is the cave itself. The writer visited the locality and went into the cave also. Its mouth is at a sufficiently great height from the foot of the mountain and from below looks like a crevice in a rock.

It goes deep down into the earth. Its opening is very narrow so that a man cannot get into it very easily. At the sight of a small opening and a dark deep pit immediately one hesitates and fears to go in. One cannot walk but has to crawl into it and that too at places with great difficulty. It has several ways leading to places where one can sit undisturbed and meditate. One of these places is big enough conveniently to accommodate forty to fifty persons ; it is round in shape and at a great height there is a chink towards the sky, but it does not allow the rays of the sun to penetrate so far into the cave as to be perceived by the persons within. Far into the cave a hole was pointed out, through which none but a child can find a passage, and it was said that Abhinavagupta went that way. It was also stated by the guide that the hole was said to have been much bigger in earlier times, but was slowly and imperceptibly getting smaller with the passing years. Outside this opening on the rock walls there seems to be inscribed something with a very sharp instrument, but it is not possible to say at present as to what it is. It is quite probable that the upper layer of the rock may have got so cracked as to look like inscribed figures. Down the hill was accidently seen a religious minded and long bearded Mohammedan, bent double with age, slowly walking reclining on his slender stick. He was approached and questioned if he knew or had heard any thing about the cave. The only information, that he could give, was "Hama ne hamārā dādā se sunā, Abnācārī bārā sau sāgirdom ke sātha isa ke andara gaya bas phir pichu nahīm lauta." (I heard from my grand father that Abnācārī went into it along with twelve hundred disciples but did never return). On being further questioned if he knew any thing more he said with great simplicity that that was all, he had heard, and that to add a word to it, his love of truth and religion did not permit him. This was

CHAPTER 1. 

said in such a tone and with such an expression of sincerity and truthfulness on wrinkled face that the writer felt convinced that whatever may be the exaggeration in the number of followers, the fact that Abhinava went into the cave with some followers and was never seen again was perfectly true, for the simple reason that to retire from the din of the world to some inaccessible place to take Samādhi seems to be the natural termination of the earthly life of a person like Abhinavagupta. 

A BIRD'S EYE VIEW OF HIS LIFE. 

He was born in a noble and learned Saiva Brāhmaṇa family in Kashmir. His father was a religious minded person of scholastic attainments and mother a pious orthodox lady. He highly respected the former and deeply loved the latter. He faithfully served his teachers and they lovingly revealed to him the secrets of learning in their possession. He was perseverant, industrious and exceptionaly intelligent and so his study was extensive and his command over various subjects was great. He tried innumerable experiments personally to ascertain the truth of what he had read or heard about spiritual matters, and unchallengeable is, there fore, the correctness and precision of his conclusions. Great was his spiritual power and his contemporaries had occasions to see its greatness in deeds. Clear was his head, powerful his memory2 marvellous his intellectual capacity, wonderful his command over the language, shrewd his eye to see the real nature of a thing from different angles of vision and beautiful and convincing the way of putting his ideas; and every page of his available books is an unmistakable proof of it. He was devoutly served by his disciples and

he has gratefully acknowledged and rewarded their services by mentioning them in some of his important works. Thus noble was his birth, loving and gentle his temper, honest and rigorous his life, strong and admirable his character, brilliant and highly useful his career, memorable and lasting his contribution to both poetics and philosophy, and glorious was the last scene of his earthly existence when like Tennyson's legendary king Arthur, he parted from his followers never to be seen again.

There is enough evidence to show that he wrote many! other works besides the above. From the known references to them we get the idea of their titles and contents as follows: 

1. His commentaries on other Saivāgamas than the 

Srīpūrva Sastra on the lines of the Purva Pancikā. That he wrote such commentaries is evident from the following accidental remark in P. T. V., 147 : 

"Pūrvaprabhștipancikāsu". 2. His commentaries on other Stotras than those 

mentioned above. To them he refers in T. S., 31. 3. His stotras from which he often quotes in the 

available works with an introductory remark "mayaiva stotre" or something similar to it. Most of these quotations are not traceable in the above mentioned available stotras. The inference, therefore, is natural that he wrote some more stotras than those we have so far been able to discover. 

24 

CHAPTER II. 

4. His commentary on the Yogavāśiştha. We have 

no other source of information about it than a 

tradition current among Kashmirian Pandits. The Catalogus Catalogorum includes in its list of seventeen works of Abhinava the following three : 

1. Paramārthasāra Sangraha. Report XXX. 2. Paramārthasāra Tīkā. Oudh IX 22. 3. Spanda. 

Oudh XVI 124. The first, in our opinion, is not a different work from that which has already been published by the Kashmir Research Department under the title of « Paramārthasāra ". It is the same as Paramārthasara Oxf. 238 (C. C., 25). In fact the published text contains both the titles. Abhinava's colophon refers to it as " Paramārthasāra" only, but his commentator, Yogarāja, adds the word "Sangraha" to the title in the colophon of his commentary. The two colophons run as follows: 

"Iti śrímahāmāheśvarācāryābhinavaguptaviracitaḥ 

Paramārthasārah." "Sampūrneyam Paramārthasārasangrahavivstih 

kstistatrabhavatparamamāheśvara Sri Rājānaka 

Yogarājasya." The Oudh Catalogue does not give any extracts from the MSS. It is, therefore, not possible for us to pronounce any opinion on the other two works which are included in Dr. Aufrecht's Catalogue on the authority of the former (Oudh Catalogue), though personally we are inclined to think that the Paramārthasāra Tīkā is the same work as the Paramārthasārasangrahavivști. 

EXPLANATION OF THE ARRANGEMENT. In the above list the first eleven are the published works. They are arranged in their chronological order on which we shall soon write, From the 12th to the 22nd are 

HIS WORKS 

25 

the MSS. in possession of the present writer. Out of these, 13th to 20th are given as appendix C to the present thesis. From the 23rd to the 35th are found referred to in the various available works in print or MSS. On the 36th we shall write towards the end of this chapter. The rest are known to us only from different catalogues and reports of searches for Sanskrit MSS. 

CHRONOLOGICAL ORDER. There is no difficulty in arranging in a chronological order those works which bear dates of their composition. Such works have already been pointed out in the preceding chapter. The difficulty lies in fixing the chronology of the rest. Our arrangement is based not on the mostly imaginary ground of maturity of style and ideas, but on the solid ground of references to earlier works in the later ones. Only in two cases, where inspite of all patient research such a firm ground has not been found, recourse has been had to other testimonies, which are certainly more reliable than those of style etc., for fixing their order. 

One of these two cases refers to the question of the priority or the posteriority of the Mālinī Vijaya Vārtika and the Parātrimśikā Vivarana to each other. Both of them are referred to in the Tantraloka as follows: 

"Mayaitat srotasām rūpam anuttarapadād dhruvāt 

Arabhya vistarenoktam malinīślokavārtike." 

T. A., Ah. 37, (MS.) "Anuttaraprakriyāyām vaitatyena pradarsitam 

Etat tasmāt tatah paśyed vistarārthi vivecakah." 

T. A., VI, 249. On this Jayaratha comments as follows: 

"Anuttaraprakriyāyāmiti parātrīśikāvivaranādāvityar thah.” 

Thus though they are earlier than the Tantrāloka 

26 

CHAPTER II. 

yet no reference is found to one in the other so that the question of priority may be decided. Here, however, the M. V. V. has been placed before the Parātrirhśikā Vivarana : 

Firstly, because the former was written at a period when of the family of Karna and Mandra, who were cousins, he knew nobody excepting the cousins themselves. In the P. T. V., however, he devotes three verses to describe their ancestry and refers in familiar terms to Vatsalikā, of whom he speaks so much later on in the Tantrāloka. The concluding passages of the Tanträloka further inform us that with the lapse of time his familiarity with Karna Mandra family grew so much that he agreed to put up with that family to write the encyclopaedic work on the 

Tantras. 

Secondly, because it is mostly controversial in its contents and the controversial Tāntrika literature from the pen of Abhinava, as we shall soon show, belongs to the earlier part of his Tāntrika period. 

And thirdly, because it is a detailed explanation of some passages of the Mālini Vijaya Tantra, also called 

Purva Šāstra. 

("Vākyārthaṁ kathaye kiñcin Mālinyāth yat kvacit kvacit." 

M. V. V., 2.) And we know on the authority of the P.T. V. that he wrote a regular commentary on the Pūrva Šāstra, called Pūrva Pañcikā, before the former work : 

("Nirņītañca etat mayaiva Srīpūrvapañcikāyām." 

P. T. V., 57.) We also know from the following quotations from the Tantrasāra and the Bhāskari, an unpublished commentary on the Isvara Pratyabhijñā Vimarsinī, that works on theHIS WORKS 

27 

same subject, whether they are further expansions or brief resumes of the same, were written one after another : 

"Vitatas Tantrāloko vigāhitum naiva sakyate sarvaih 

Rjuvacanaviracitam idam Tantrasāram tataḥ śrnuta.". 

T. S., 2. "Tatra ca sarvajanahitārtham Bphatpratyabhijñākhyā 

bahuvistarā tīkā krtā, tadvicāraņeca janam asaktam jñātvā tenaiva Pratyabhijñākārikāsūtreșu samhgrahamayi Vimar 

sinītiprasiddhā tīkā krtā." (Bhaskarī). The M. V. V. also, therefore, has to be supposed to have come either immediately before or after his commentary on the Pūrva Sastra, in any case before the Parātrirhśikāvivarana. 

The other case of a work of doubtful chronological position is that of the Paramārtha Sāra. It consists of only 105 verses and contains only one literary reference and that also is to the Karikās of Seșa, of which it is an adaptation. This, however, has been placed between the Bhagavadgītārtha Samgraha and the Pratyabhijñā Vimarsinī, because it is a philosophical work. We know of only four philosophical works of Abhinava. Of these, the chronological position of three is certain on the evidence of Abhinava himself. The Bhagavadgītārthasangraha is the first and the Pratyabhijñā Vimarsinī is the last. The Pratyabhijñā Vivști Vimarsinī or Brhatī Vimarsini immediately preceded, the latter. There is, therefore, no other position which we can assign to the Paramārthasāra than the one, 

given above. 

THE TEXTUAL AUTHORITY. The two doubtful cases having thus been settled, we now give for each work a textual authority in support of the chronological position that we have assigned to it. 

1. Bodha Pancadaśikā. 

"Prabodhapancadasikāmadhye tādsi mayā sphu tamuktam".

T. S., 2. 6. Tantra Vata Dhānikā. 

Because it is a still briefer resume of the Tantra loka than even the Tantra Sāra. 

7. Dhvanyaloka Locana. 

"Taduttīrnatve tu sarvam parameśvarādvayam brahmetyasmacchāstrānusāreņa viditam Tantra lokagrantham vicāraya.

Bhagavadgītārtha Samgraha. 

“Vipancitam caitat asmadgurubhih asmābhi ścānyatra vitanyate itīha nātinirbandhah krtah." 

A. Bh., 337. A footnote on the word "anyatra" in the above quotation clears what it stands for by stating "Bhagavadgītāvyakhyāyām". 

HIS WORKS 

20 

10. Paramārtha Sāra. 

The question has already been discussed. 11. Pratyabhijña Vimarsinī. 

Because it came immediately after the Bșhatī Vimarsins which is his last known dated work on philosophy, on which he wrote last of all. 

M. M. MUKUNDARĀMA SĀSTRI ON THE CHRONOLOGY 

OF ABHINAVA'S WORKS. In view of the facts stated above, it is surprising to find that M. M. Mukundarāma Sāstrī in his two introductions to the Tantrasāra, the one in English (P. IX) and the other in Sanskrit (P. 5-6) has placed the Parātrīśikā Vivaraņa, the Tantrāloka, and the Tantra Sāra chronologically after the Isvara Pratyabhijñā Vimarsini saying : 

"As, in his great work Tantrāloka, he often quotes from Isvara Pratyabhijñā Vimarsinī, which, he himself says, was written by him in the year 4115 of the kali age corresponding to 1014 A. D., it follows that the former was composed after the year 1014. Now the date of composition of Tantra Sāra, which is an epitome of Tantrāloka must necessarily be some time later than 1014 A. D." 

In his introduction in Sanskrit he makes an additional statement assigning to the Parātrimsikā Vivarana an earlier chronological position than that of even the Tantrāloka : 

"Tadanu parātrimsikāgranthavivaranam” It is to be noted here that the learned Sastrī has not given the passages which he considers to have been quoted in the Tantraloka from the I. P. V. We have already quoted the authority of the Bhaskari on the basis of which we have assigned to the Brhati Vimarsini an earlier position in the chronological order than that of the Pratyabhijñā Vimarsinī. We have also given a quotation in justification of the 

30 

CHAPTER II. 

P. T. V. 's chronological position before the Tantraloka. Here is another passage which has been found in I. P. V. actually referring to the Tantrāloka and the Tantra Sāra. This, in our opinion, is the most conclusive proof of the latter's having been written before the Isvara Pratyabhijñā 

Vimarsini : 

*Etacca vistaratah tatpradhānesu Tantrāloka sārādişu mayā nirnītam itīhānupayogānna vitānitam." 

I. P. V., II, 214. 

It seems that our Sāstrī mistook the Isvara Pratyabhijña Kārikā for the Isvara Pratyabhijñā Vimarsinī. The Îśvara Pratyabhijñā Kārikā is the original text of Utpalācārya and the Isvara Pratyabhijñā Vimarsini is the smaller of the two commentaries on the above by Abhinavagupta. Un doubtedly, there are quotations in the Tantrāloka from the former (Vide Appendix B). But in view of the above quoted statement of Abhinava himself about the earlier chronological position of the Tantrāloka it would indeed be very surprising if any quotation from the iśvara Pratya bhijña Vimarsinī could be traced in the Tantraloka. 

WORKS KNOWN FROM REFERENCES. 1. Kramakeli. 

It was a commentary on the Krama Stotra. It has to be noted here that this Krama Stotra was different from Abhinava's composition of the same name, given in appendix (C) to this thesis. It was a work on the Krama system of philosophy. It is very often quoted by Maheśvarānanda in his commentary, Parimalā, on the Mahārtha Mañjarī. It is referred to by Abhinava in his Vivaraņa on the Parātritsikā : 

*Vyākhyātam caitat mayā tattīkāyām Kramakelau Vistaratah." 

P. T. V., 236. 

HIS WORKS 

31 

2. Sivadrstyālocana. 

Sivadựşti is a well known work on the Trika system, written by Somānanda, the great grand teacher of Abhinava. The Pratyabhijñā system is based on it. From its name and reference the Alocana of Abhinava seems to have been a critical study of the original work : 

«Yathoktam mayaiva Sivadystyalocane "Preşopi sa bhaved yasya saktatā nāma vidyate" 

P. T. V., 116. 3. Purva Pañcikā. 

This was a commentary on the Purva Sāstra, also called Mālinī Vijaya, which, according to the following statement, is the most authoritative book on the Trika system of the Saiva philosophy : 

*Daśāstādaśavasvastabhinnam yacchāsanaṁ vibhoh 

Tatsāram Trikaśāstram nu tatsāram Malini matam." 

T. A., I, 35. 

From its name, Pañcikā, which means a detailed exposition, and from the frequent references to it in most of Abhinava's writings it seems to have been a very big work. An idea of its size can be formed from the available part of the Mālinī Vijaya Vārtika which is an exposition of only the first verse of the Malini Vijaya Tantra, as he himself says in its concluding line : “Pravarapuranāmadheye pure pūrve Kāśmīriko 

bhinavaguptah Mālinyādimavākye vārtikam etad racayati sma." 

What must have been the size of the detailed exposition of the whole of the above Tantra, it is not difficult to imagine. This work, however, seems to be irrecoverably lost. Its loss to Saiva philosophical literature is irrepairable. 

32 

CHAPTER II. 

4. 

Other Pañcikās. 

On the lines of the work, just mentioned, he wrote expositions on other Tantras also, as is clear from his reference to them in : 

"Nirnītam caitan mayaiva Sri Pūrva prabhịti 

Pañcikāsu." P.T. V., 147. Here the use of the word "prabhịti" can have no other meaning than the above. 

Padārtha Praveśa Nirnaya Tīkā. 

Nothing more about this can be said than that, from its name and the nature of the context in which the following reference to it occurs, it appears to have been a work of psycho-philosophical interest : 

*Anusandhāyāh smrtibhede tasyāśca anubhavopa jīvitve anubhavābhāvāt; vitatya ca vicāritam mayaitat Padārtha Praveśa Nirnaya Tīkāyām." 

P. T. V., 162. 5. Prakīrņaka Vivarana. 

From the context, in which reference to it, as given below, occurs, this seems to have been a grammatico philosophical work : 

"Itthar jadena sambandhe na mukhyanyartha 

sangatih Astām anyatra vitatam etad vistarato maya." 

T. A., VII, 33. In commenting upon the word "anyatra" Jayaratha says: 

"Anyatreti Prakīrņaka Vivaranādau". Here the use of the word "ādi" indicates that he wrote 

many other works of the same kind. 6. Prakarana Vivarana. 

It was a commentary on the Prakarana Stotra and is referred to in the T. S., 31. 

HIS WORKS 

33 

7. Kāvyakautuka Vivarana. 

It was a commentary on Bhatta Tota's work on poetics, the Kāvyakautuka. It was perhaps the first work on poetics that Abhinava wrote, for, chronologi cally it comes before the Dhvanyaloka Locana as the following reference shows : 

"Sa cāyam asmadupādhyāya Bhatta Tautena 

Kāvya Kautuke asmābhiếca tadvivarañe bahutara krtanirnayah pūrvapakşasiddhāntahityalam bahunā." 

Dh. L., 178. 8. Kathāmukha Tilakam. 

It is referred to as his own composition in the Brhatī Vimarsinī. Nothing at present can be said about its contents. Laghvī Prakriyā. 

It was a devotional Stotra as the following quota tions therefrom in the Bhagavadgītārtha Sangraha and the nature of the context clearly show : 

"Yathā ca mayaiva Laghvyām Prakriyāyām 

uktam" : “Na bhogya vyatiriktar hi bhoktus tvatto 

vibhāvyate Eșa eva hi bhogo yattādātmyam bhokt;bhogayoh." 

Bh. G. S., ch. IV, S. 28. 

and "Ünādhikam avijñātam.. 

Kşantavyaṁ krpayā sambho yatastvam karuņākaraḥ Anena stotrayogena tavātmānam nivedaye." 

Bh. G. S., ch. XII, S. 11. 10. Bhedavāda Vidāraņa. 

It is referred to in both the Bhagavadgītārtha Sangraha and the Pratyabhijñā Vimarsins. It was a 

CHAPTER II 

controversial work chiefly meant to demolish the dualistic theory, as is apparent from the following quotation : "Krtapratānaścāyam prakrtyarthaṇyarthaviveko 

mayaiva Bhedavāda Vidārane iti tata evānveşyah." 

I. P. V., II, 158. 

11. Devi Stotra Vivarana. 

This was a commentary from the monistic view point on Anandavardhana's Devi Stotra. The Stotra has been published in the Kāvyamālā series. Our statement is based upon the following lines in the Bh. G. S.: “Sarvabhūteņu ātmānamh grāhakatayā anupravisantam 

bhāvayet, ātmani ca grāhyatājñānadvāreņa sarvāṇi bhūtāni ekikuryāt; atasca samadarśan atvam samhjāyate yogasceti sarhkṣepārthaḥ; vistarastu Bhedavāda Vidāraņādi prakarane Devīstotra Vivarane ca mayaiva nirnītah." 

Bh. G. S., ch. VI, S. 30. Here from the use of the word "ādi" after "Bhedavāda Vidāraṇa," it appears that he wrote very many books 

to controvert the dualistic theory. 12. Tattvādhya Prakāśikā. 

In this the author discussed the nature and the number of Tattvas accepted by the Trika. It is referred to by Jayaratha in his commentary on the Tantrāloka as follows: “Granthakştā ca Tattvādhvaprakāśanādau tatra tatra 

tanmatāvalambanam eva krtam." 

T. A., Ah. XI, P. 19. 13. Sivasaktyavinābhāva Stotra. 

In this Stotra, as the title indicates, Abhinava praises Siva and Sakti as inseparable from each other. He quotes 

HIS WORKS 

35 

two verses from this in his commentary on the 19th verse of the 15th chapter of the Bhagavadgītā. 

DIVISION OF HIS WORKS INTO THREE PERIODS. 

There are three clearly marked periods of his literary activity. His works, therefore, have to be classified accordingly. 

1. TANTRIKA PERIOD. From the dates of his two dated stotras, Krama and Bhairava, and from the chronological order of his works based on references and other indications it is clear that first of all he tried the power of his pen mainly in commenting on the then existing Tantras from the point of view of monistic Saivaism. That the Krama was the first of the Tantric systems on which he worked, the earliest date of the Kramastotra clearly proves. His known contributions to it are his above stotra and the Kramakeli. The next Tantric system that drew his attention was the Trika. To this his chief contributions are his Pūrva and other Pañcikās. That it was the transitional period between his experimenting in and writing on the Krama, and his ultimately taking to Kaulism, is conclusively proved by the following statement of Jayaratha : 

«Tantropāsannagurvabhimukhīkaraņānantaram vis rāntisthānatayā kulaprakriyāgurumapi utkarşayati." 

CEST. A., Comm., 1, 31. His known contributions to the Kaulika literature are the Bhairavastava and the Parātrimśikā Vivarana. To the last part of this very first period of literary activity belong also his encyclopaedic work, the Tantrāloka, which deals with all the allied schools of Kashmir Saivaism, and its three summaries, the Tantra Sāra, the Tantroccaya and the 

Tantravata Dhānikā, each briefer than the preceding. 

36 

CHAPTER II 

II. ALANKĀRIKA PERIOD. 

In the concluding portion of the last chapter of the Tantrāloka we find that his taste is changing. We see him inclining more towards the angle of vision of an admiring poet than towards that of a dry spiritualist. His vivid description of colour, taste and pleasant after-effects of wine, the record of his observation of charming complexion, beautiful facial cut and sportive movements of the city ladies, his interest in the beauty of the fauna and the flaura of Kashmir, his description of the river Vitastā and repeated reference to the power of Cupid, are all unmistakable signs of a changed taste. The Alankārika period, therefore, followed. That this was the middle period we know on the unmistakable authority of the Dh. L. which contains a clear reference to T. A. (vide Dh. L., 19). There are four known works of this period, of which the K. K. V. was the first (vide Dh. L., 178) and the A. Bh. the last to come from his pen. 

III. PHILOSOPHICAL PERIOD. 

Again, at the time of writing the A. Bh., philosophical ideas are seen getting supremacy, so much so that his exposition of Rasa, which has held its ground to this day, is purely philosophical. Not only this, while commenting! on Bharata's Nātya Sūtra he had already begun writing side by side a purely philosophical work, namely, his commentary on the Bhagavadgītā, as we know from a reference in A. Bh. (vide A. Bh., 337). Thus last of all did come the philosophi cal period. To this belong his monumental works, the Isvara Pratyabhijña Vimarsins and the Isvara Pratyabhijñā Vivrti Vimarsini. The latter is also known as Bțhati Vimarsinī or Aștādaśa Sahasri. Because of these two works it is that he is acknowledged to be the chief exponent of the Pratyabhijñā philosophy, as the concluding portion ofHIS WORKS 

37 

Mādhavācārya's summary of the Pratyabhijñā Darśana in the Sarvadarśana Sangraha shows : 

"Abhinavaguptādibhirācāryaiḥ vihitapratānopyayamar thah.” 

The Pratyabhijñā Vivrti Vimarsinī is the penultimate of his known works. There is only one work, namely, the Isvara Pratyabhijñā Vimarsinī, which, on the authority of the Bhāskarī, we know for certain as posterior to it. How many more works he wrote thereafter, or whether he wrote any at all, we have at present no authority to say. 

A GENERAL IDEA OF HIS AVAILABLE WORKS. 1. Bodha Pañcadaśikā. 

It is a propagandistic pamphlet consisting of 16 verses. It is called Bodha Pancadaśikā because in fifteen (Pancadaśa) verses the basic principles of the monistic Saivaism are summarized in it. The sixteenth verse simply explains the object of such a composition. It speaks of the Saiva conception of Siva and Sakti, their relation and consequent emanation of the universe; of the cause and the nature of the bondage and the way to freedom from it, and of their (bondage and freedom) being in reality non-different from the highest Lord. It was written, as the following quotation shows, with the expressed object of enabling the less intelligent pupils of his, easily to grasp the fundamental principles of the system propounded by him : 

"Sukumāramatin śişyān prabodhayitum añjasā Imebhinavaguptena ślokāh pañcadaśoditāh." 

B. P., S. 16. The eighth verse of this pamphlet is quoted in the M. V. V., with the introductory remark : 

"Prabodhapancadasikā madhye tādỊo mayā sphutam."

CHAPTER II 

2. Mālini Vijaya Vārtika. 

It was an exposition of some of the very difficult verses of the Mālinī Vijaya Tantra which is also called Srī purva Sāstra. It was written at the earnest entreaty of his loving pupils Karna and Mandra'. On the former we have already spoken a little and shall speak more when dealing with the Tantrāloka. It is unfortunate that so far we have been able to get the Vārtika on the first verse only which was composed in the eastern part of Pravarapura?. That he wrote his Vārtika on more than one verse and that the published edition, consisting of only two chapters, is only a part of a very big work that he wrote, is clear from his repeated reference to the 18th chapter wherein he promises to deal exhaustively with the various points under discussion. Though it is only the second in the chronological list of his published works yet it was not the second of his compositions. Before taking up this work he had written many others as references to them to be frequently met with in this work clearly prove*. The available portion contains a very scathing criticism of various important theories of Nyāya. 

3. Parātrirhśikā Vivarana. 

The Text. Amongst the eight numerically equal groups of the sixty-four non-dualistic Tantras, Rudra Yāmala Tantra is the seventh in the second i. e. Yāmala group. The verses constituting the text of the Parātrimśikā form the concluding part of the same. They give a summary of the whole Tantra. This statement finds its support in the last verse of the text itself :

"Evam mantraphalāvāptirityetad Rudrayāmalam." 

P.T. V., 277. The Vivarana is Abhinava's commentary on it. 

OTHER COMMENTATORS. Parātrimśikā seems to have been quite popular during the century that intervened between Somānanda and Abhinava. This supposition alone can explain the existence of so many commentaries on it. Abhinava refers with reverence to only three of these, written by Somānanda, Bhavabhūti and Kalyāņa separately. About the rest he had so bad an opinion that he considered it disgraceful even to criticise them? In Kashmir the present writer found another commentary, which is both simpler and briefer. It was written by Rājānaka Lakşmīrāma. The MS. was copied by Räjānaka Nīlakantha in the Saptarsi year 4962. It is in the possession of his son Mahisar of Srinagar. 

THE TITLE. The title is very misleading. On seeing it, the reader naturally thinks that the word “Trimśikā" is indicative of the number of verses constituting the original text, but it is not so, 3 because the text actually consists of more verses than thirty. The real title of the book is Parātrisikā. It means "Parā, the mistress of the three i. e. the three powers of will, knowledge and action." In fact Parā is an abbreviation of Parāsaṁvid, which is higher than these powers and is still identical with them. The book is so called because it deals with such a "Parā." No doubt, it was also called Parā Trimśikā, but for no other reason than that of similarity of sound. The word "trimśikā" does not imply number thirty. Another name of this book is Trika Sūtra, because it gives in brief outline the basic

CHAPTER II 

principles (Prameyas) of the Trika system. The text with Abhinava's Vivarana is also called Anuttara Prakriyā. 2 

There are frequent references in this book to a Tantra Sāra. But it has to be noted here that this Tantra Sāra is an Agama and not the summary of Abhinava's great work, the Tantrāloka. We made a very thorough search for the quotations from the Tantrasāra, found in the Parātrimśikā Vivarana, in Abhinava's Tantrasāra, but could not trace any. We have, therefore, come to the natural conclusion that the Tantrasāra, quoted in the Parātrimśikā Vivarana, is different from the work of the same name which is merely one of Abhinava's own summaries of his great work, the Tantrāloka. The chronological position, therefore, that we have assigned to the Parā Trimśikā Vivarana, needs no change. 

Saiva conception of Parā, Paśyantī, 

Madhyamā and Vaikhari. According to the Abhāsavādin the whole universe is a mere manifestation of the universal self or Parama Siva, as the images of an imagination, the scenes of a dream or the creations of a person who has attained certain yogic powers (yoginirmāņa) are those of the limited selves. Our experience tells us that the things of imagination, dream and yogic creation have no existence independent of or separate from the self which is responsible for their manifestation. Believing, therefore, the macrocosm to be the same in its nature and constitution as the microcosm, the Ābhāsavādin holds that the whole universe rises from, has its being within, is maintained by and again merges in the same universal consciousness or self. He also holds that it is in its essence the same as that from which it rises, just as the waves of the ocean are essentially the same as the ocean itself. 

1. T. A., Ah. XII, P. 101. 2. T. A., VI, 249. 

HIS WORKS 

41 

This Self, the ultimate reality, he conceives as "prakāśa vimarśamaya". The universe also he broadly divides into substance and speech (vācya and vācaka); speech not as a mere physical phenomenon but as that of which the words are mere symbols. In fact the word "vāk" (speech) is used for the immaterial part of the universe, because the grossest form of vimarśa is distinguished from its other forms by its association with the physical sound which is its symbol and has a different physical substratum as opposed to that of the purely intellectual substratum of the idea. The substance is the grossest manifestation of the prakāśa aspect of the universal consciousness and the speech is that of the vimarśa. Thus Parā is a distinctive name of the ultimate reality by which it is referred to when its vimarśa aspect is intended to be emphasized. The Parā is called speech (śabdana) not in its gross form in which we hear it, but in the most subtle one, like self-consciousness within. In this form it is independent of all conventions, rather, it is their very life in the condition of Māyal. It is the background of the individual self-consciousness, which has no other reality than the identification of self with a body, an identification which finds expression in gross speech as "I am John". Thus substance and speech are one in their most subtle original form, though in the stage of Māyā both seem to have separate existence. This state of perfect unity of consciousness and its entitative contents (prakāśa vimarśaikya) is called the Parā state. 

"Citih pratyavamarśātmā parā vāk svarasoditā." 

I. P. V., I. 203. 

All that we hear and can possibly hear exists in the Parā state of speech exactly in the manner in which all that we determinately perceive exists in the state of 

1. I. P. V., I, 205. 

42 

CHAPTER II 

indeterminate knowledge. But before it can find manifestation in gross speech, technically called Vaikharī, it passes through two intermediate stages, known as Paśyanti and Madhyamā. To give a clear idea of what these technical terms stand for, it is necessary to deal with them separately, avoiding, as far as possible, the use of philosophical jargon. 

I PARĀ. The Parā is pure consciousness. It is free from all limitations of time and place, and name and form. It can be called self-consciousness (Aham), not as associated with body, mind, or vital airs, but as identical with the universal self. It has to be noted here that the use of the word "self-consciousness" for the Parā state of speech is from the point of view of the limited perceiver, who in the Vaikharī stage recognizes the latter's origin from the former. The reason is that the Parā state is the state of absolute unity without even so much as the faintest rise of diversity. For, the first rise of diversity takes place only in the first stage in the manifestation of gross speech from Parā, called Paśyantī. It is the ultimate source of all power that is found in words, used in ordinary life. It is a state of perfect unity of all kinds of powers. It is ever present in all the limited perceivers as identical with their self-consciousness, not as associated with body etc., but as something above them all. It is present even in the state of deep sleep when there is no consciousness of the 

earthly existence. 

II PASYANTI. Taking Parā as the primordial state of speech, we can speak of Paśyanti as the first stage in the manifestation of gross speech. In it there is but an extremely faint rise of gross speech as distinct from pure consciousness, so much so that the distinction cannot at all be said to have 

HIS WORKS 

43 

arisen. This rise of distinction is regulated by the desire which is its cause; just as in the case of remembrance, though its object is associated with a variety of ideas yet in the memory there arises only that idea for the revival of which there has been an immediate cause. As for instance, though a gold jar is associated with innumerable ideas yet there is no rise of all of them or any of them promiscuously at the time of remembrance. We know it from our own experience that when it is remembered at the time of prosperity the only ideas, which rise about it, are those which are associated with it as an article of decoration and luxury. But do not absolutely different ideas arise when the same is remembered at the time of adverse circumstances ? Is not then the idea of its salability prominently associated with it? And what is it that controls the rise of these ideas? Is it not the desire of the remembering individual ? The same, therefore, is the determining factor in the rise to distinction of certain forms of speech to the exclusion of the rest in the stage of Pasyántī, though there is no denying the fact that all of them are equally present within para exactly as all the ideas, which can rise in remembrance, are within ourselves. 

III MADHYAMĀ. It is that stage which immediately precedes the articulate speech. In this although the distinction between idea and speech, preceding the utterance, is clear, yet, there is no difference in the substratum of the two exactly as in the case of a black jar in which, although we have the idea of jar as separate from that of its blackness, yet, the substratum of jar is non-different from that of the quality of blackness. This we can all feel when we are delivering a very thoughtful speech in which every idea and the words expressive of it are very carefully chosen before utterance. Although in such a case there is a very clear consciousness of the distinction 

44 

CHAPTER II. 

between the two, yet, experience tells us, there is no difference of substratum. 

IV VAIKHARI. It is that form of speech which we use in our daily transactions. In it the idea and the articulate symbol, which represents it, have separate substrata. 

The distinction of each one of the four forms of speech from the rest of them will become clear if we were to compare them with the four conditions of a seed before it sends out its sprout. The Parā is like that condition of a seed, in which all the future forms of the sprout, according to the Sankhya conception, exist in the state of absolute unity. The Paśyanti is just like that condition in which there is just the rise of that state which is responsible for the first perceptible development. It is just like self preparation on the part of a person before he makes any perceptible movement to stir or jump. The third i. e. Madhyamā is like the enlargement of seed in which though there is a perceptible change from the original condition yet the two (seed and sprout) cannot be pointed out as distinct from each other in point of substratum. The last i. e. Vaikharī is comparable to that condition in which the sprout has appeared as distinct from the seed and both are directly perceptible as distinct from each other in all respects not excluding that of the substratum. 

The reader will, now, understand that Parā with the explanation of which the Parā Trīsikā is concerned is nothing but the Parā Samvid or Anuttara ; and that the adjunct "Trīšikā", which forms a component part of the compound which stands as the title of the book, is meant to distinguish this Parā from the first of the four forms of speech involved

This 

in the individual utterance in the condition of Māyā. explains why the work was called Anuttara Sūtra also. 

THE SUBSTANCE. The text is in the form of a dialogue between Bhairava and Bhairavi; the latter questions what is that thing, called Anuttara, from the mere knowledge of which equilibrium of Khecarī i. e. liberation from all kinds of pains and sorrows (mokşa) can be got. The idea is similar to that of the Vedānta which also says "One who knows Brahman himself becomes Brahman.” (Brahmavid Brahmaiva bhavati). What Bhairava says in reply on the essential nature of the Samvid and the way to know it we shall have occasion to speak of in the philosophical part of this work. 

BIOGRAPHICAL IMPORTANCE This book, next to the Tantrāloka, is of very great biographical importance. In the concluding portion of this work he describes, for the first time, his as well as his favourite pupil Mandra's descent and gives some account of both the families and their atmosphere. All these points have already been dealt with at some length in the preceding chapter. 4. TANTRĀLOKA. 

This is the most voluminous of all the works of Abhinava discovered so far. It deals exhaustively with all the matters connected with the non-dualistic sixty-four Agamas. It touches upon both the ritualistic and the philosophical matters alike. Although it is primarily concerned with the systematic presentation of the teachings of the Kula" and the Tantra systems only yet occasionally

CHAPTER II. 

it gives authoritative information on others also such as the Krama etc. It is the most authoritative book on the said subjects, because the statements made in it are not simply matters of opinion, but are based on the authority of the Saivāgama, as traditionally interpreted, and, what is more, on the personal experience of the author himself. It consists of thirty-seven chapters, but only fourteen have so far been published. They, together with the valuable commentary of Jayaratha, cover eight volumes. Of these the first five, the ninth and the thirteenth chapters are of very great philosophical importance. The first gives in brief all that is to be dealt with later in detail. The following four deal successively, with the four ways to the final emancipation, namely, (I) Anupāya, (II) Sambhava, (III) Sākta, (IV) and Anava. The ninth is interesting because it deals with the thirty six Tattvas of the Saiva philosophy and the interest of the thirteenth lies in its giving us an idea of the Saiva theory of Karma. 

THE MOST IMPORTANT POINTS DISCUSSED 

IN THE TANTRĀLOKA. 

1. The cause of bondage. 2. The way to freedom. 3. What is knowledge as distinct from ignorance. 4. What is Mokșa according to the Trika. 5. Conceptions of Mokşa of other schools. 6. What is the ultimate reality of the objective world. 7. The process of manifestation of the universe. 8. The ways to realisation of the ultimate reality. 9. The points of difference between one way and another. 10. Bimbapratibimba Vāda.

THE TITLE It is called Tantrāloka because it enlightens its reader on the path pointed out by the Tantras. 

"Alokam āsādya yadiyam eşa Lokah sukham sañcarita kriyāsu." T. A., Ah. 37, (MS.) 

THE PLACE OF AND THE OCCASION FOR ITS COMPOSITION. 

It was written at the house of Mandra?. And it was at the combined request of his younger brother, Manoratha, his dear pupil, Mandra, his loving cousins, and some other devotees of Siva, such as Rāmagupta, that he undertook to write this work. As a matter of fact the idea of writing such a work was already in his mind. This combined request simply gave an additional impetus and so the work was taken up immediately. 

SEITS AUTHORITY. Although it is full of quotations in support of the various points, discussed therein, from ever so many Tantras, yet, according to Abhinava's own statement, it is primarily based upon the authority of the Mālinī4 Vijaya Tantra. This Tantra is the most important of all the three, Siddhā, Nāmaka and Mālini, which primarily contain the principles and teachings of the system called the Trika, and represents the essence of all the ninety-two Agamas

belonging to the three schools of Saivaism, namely, Advaita, Dvaitādvaita and Dvaita. 

5. TANTRASĀRA. 

6. TANTRA VAȚA DHĀNIKĀ. 

These two, as their names imply, are the summaries of the Tantrāloka. The last is a briefer summary than the first. It is like a seed of the huge tree of the Tantrāloka. 

AUTHORSHIP OF THE TANTRA VAȚA DHĀNIKĀ. 

Jayaratha quotes two verses from the Tantra Vata Dhānikā in his commentary on the Tantrāloka Ah. II, s. 2, without mentioning the name of the author. This was thought by M. M. Mukundarāma Sāstrī to be sufficient reason to attribute this work to another Abhinava of the same name. He says in a foot note to his edition of the work under discussion : 

"Upāyairna sivo bhāti' ityādi padyadvayam (Tantrā. loka 2 Ah. 2 padyatīkāyām) yaduktam itīyatā granthakrn nāmānuddisya yat pramānarūpeṇopanyastam atonumīyate etadgranthakrd Abhinavaguptah prasiddha Abhinavagupta cāryad vibhinno Rājānaka Jayarathācāryāt paurvakalikasca sambhavatīti." 

T. V. Dh., P., 5. 

Even if there had been no other reason to the contrary, we would have considered the reason stated by the learned editor to be too insufficient for such a conclusion. But there is the sound evidence of Jayaratha himself, who, in his commentary on the Tantrāloka itself, clearly attributes the Tantra Vața Dhānikā to our Abhinavagupta, saying "Yaduk tam anenaivānyatra" and quotes verses thirty-six and thirty-seven giving the name also of this work in T. A., Comm., Ah. 13, P. 81. The supposition of difference in point of authorship of this work is, therefore, baseless.

7. DHVANYĀLOKA LOCANA. 

It is the well known commentary of our author on Anandavardhana's Dhvanyāloka. On the commonness of the authorship of the Kārikā and the Vrtti; on the history of the theory of Dhvani, on its opponents and on other commentators of the Dhvanyāloka than our author, we shall speak at proper places in the following chapters. Here, therefore, we need not go into any detailed treatment of the work. 8. ABHINAVA BHARATI. 

This is a commentary of Abhinavagupta on the Nātya Sastra of Bharata. In this he mostly follows the interpretation of the text, as orally given by his teacher in this branch, Bhatta Tota. On many important points, however, he differs from him (Bhatta Tota) as he does from Somānanda, whose commentary he follows and expands in the Parā Trimśikā Vivarana. These differences he clearly I states, as for instance, in regard to there being a possibility of the enjoyment of Rasa from the perusal of a poem (A. Bh., 292-3). His object in this commentary was not simply to prove that his predecessors' interpretations of Bharata's text were wrong but rather to modify them.2 

THE PLAN. According to his own statement, his plan in this work was to comment in detail, giving a full and clear explanation of all the intricacies to be met with in the important passages, to give the meaning of the difficult words in the case of the unimportant ones, to reconcile all the apparent contradictions in the text, to explain repetitions, to discuss at length the disputed points, to clear up doubts and to put together the opinions of the authoritative persons on the most salients points. These are some of the distinctive 

1. A. Bh., I. 2. A. Bh., 2. 3. A. Bh., 1-2. 

50 

CHAPTER II 

features of the commentary. Space here does not permit us to illustrate all the points stated above. Two places in the commentary may, however, be pointed out as illustrative of most of them. One is that in which he deals with Bharata's definition of Rasa in the 6th chapter, and the other is the third chapter in which he contents himself with mostly giving the meanings of a few words here and there. 

THE QUESTION OF THE JOINT AUTHORSHIP OF THE TEXT. 

The question of the joint authorship of the Natya Sastra of Bharata is very old. On this scholars have differed right from the pre-Abhinava time. According to some, those portions in which sage Bharata is addressed in the second person, as for instance in Bh. Su., ch. I, S. 2-6, were from the pen of some of his pupils and the rest from that of Bharata himself. But Abhinava considers the use of the second person alone to be too insufficient for such a conclusion and thinks that Bharata himself wrote those portions also, representing himself to be an interrogator. He substantiates his statement by giving the instances of the use of dialogic forms in the works of accepted single authorship. We reserve our opinion on this matter till the next chapter. 

THE INTERPRETATION OF BHARATA'S MYTH ABOUT 

THE ORIGIN OF THE STAGE, Abhinava puts a very intelligent interpretation on the mythical account, given by Bharata, of the origin of the stage in the first chapter. According to him, when Bharata speaks of his having been instructed by Brahmā to direct the dramatic performance because of his being a sage with hundred sons, of his having been given umbrella, crown and throne etc. by different gods, of the appointment of certain 

1. A. Bh., 8. 

HIS WORKS 

51 

divine beings to guard over certain parts of the theatre or certain actors and of the creation of fairies, he simply means to tell us the requirements of the stage and the way to manage it. 

To state it briefly, the stage director should be a self sacrificing, hardy, 1 industrious and influential person of great intellectual power ; he should be capable of understanding the idea of the poet at a glance; he should have a large number of men of receptive minds and retentive memory, of quick judgments and easy delivery; these men should be capable of identifying? themselves with the characters that they represent, so that not only their tone and facial expression may change with the changing scenes, but the colours also, which is ordinarily not possible unless there be corresponding feeling in the heart. Their height, complexion, facial cut, colour of the hair and eyes and general constitution of the body should be fit for the varying needs of the stage, as the hundred names of Bharata's sons enumerated in the text, implyle; and above all they should be free from all shyness? 1 before the audience. 

Women are indispensable for the stage. For, whatever be the nature of training, the characteristic differences in point of delicacy of body and sweetness of tongue, which are the gifts of nature alone, and the sudden or gradual change of colour and look which are caused by certain feelings natural to women alone under certain circumstances, cannot possibly be displayed by men; and the absence of these seriously interferes with the enjoyment of Rasa. Like men, women also,

as the names of the created fairies imply, should be of different kinds to suit the occasion. 

There is also required a sympathetic, appreciative and liberal public to supply, like gods in the myth, the various scenic necessities to give the look of naturalness to all the scenes of the drama. 

As regards the management, the general manager should be a person who in disposition, talk and look is exceptionally sweet like the moon. But strong and strict should be the stage-manager. The other executives also should be of such nature and power as characterises the gods mentioned in the myth. 

In this brief statement of a general idea of his works, we need not state what he has said in regard to those portions of Bharata's Natya Sastra which concern themselves with the details of construction of the stage and the arrangement of seating accommodation for the audience according to the class, rank and importance of each individual", with the narration of the orthodox religious rites to be performed before using a new stage, with the description of one hundred and eight postures (karana) and thirty-two gestures (angahāra) of dance and finally with the instructions as to how to stage the prologue. We, there fore, pass them over. 9. BHAGAVADGITĀRTHA SANGRAHA. 

The Bhagavadgitārtha Sangraha, as its name implies, is not a commentary in the strict sense of the word. It is simply a summary of the subject matter of the Bhagavadgitā. At some places, however, it has the look of a commentary inasmuch as it gives the meanings of certain words. In it

53 

Abhinava gives the traditional interpretation from the Saiva point of view, as learnt from his teacher Bhattendurāja, but not without using his judgment. It was written at the repeated request of a certain pious Brāhmaṇa, Lotaka,' who, it appears, was Abhinava's relative. It fills a gap left by other commen tators, inasmuch as it gives the hidden true import of the Bhagavadgītā. Its proper understanding presupposes a tolerably good knowledge of the undisputed parts of the text as well as that of the basic principles of the Trika philosophy. A person, who is qualified in both these respects, will certainly find it very informing, particularly on those passages about which doubt is not removed by the commentaries of his predecessors. The following verses illustrate the point : 

II, 12, 69; III, 11 ; IV, 18, 24; V, 14; VI, 5-7. 

The text on which Abhinava comments, differs at many places from the one published by the Nirnaya Sagar Press, which, along with other commentaries, includes Abhinava's Bhagavadgitārtha Sangraha also. In the printed text, for instance, we find that the well known verse 

"yada yadā hi dharmasya" etc. reads in the concluding portion as 

tadātmānam srjāmyaham". But Abhinava's text reads as 

"tadātmāmsam sșjāmyaham". 

The variation, though apparently slight, implies a greatly different meaning as the following extract from the commentary shows : "Sri Bhagavān kila pürņaşādgunyatvāt sarīrasamparkamātra rahitopisthitikāritvāt kāruņikatayā ātmāmsaí srjati ;

Ātmā pürņaşādgunyah, amsah upakārakatvena apradhāna bhūto yatra tat atmāṁsam, sarīram grhņāti ityarthah." 

Bh. G. S., Ch. IV, 7. 

Numbers of a few more verses with this kind of difference are given below : 

1st Chapter : 1, 6, 18, 28, 33. 2nd Chapter: 1, 5, 10, 11, 12, 13, 21, 30, 32, 43, 47, 

48, 58, 60, 63. 3rd Chapter 23, 26, 35. 

Further, it has very many verses in addition to those found in the published text. Take for instance verses forty to forty-five in the third chapter. 

"Eşa sūkşmah parah satrur dehinām indriyaih saba Sukhatantra ivāsīno mohayan partha tişthati Kāmakrodhamayo ghorah stambhaharşasamudbhavah Ahankārobhimānātmā dustarah pāpakarmabhiḥ Harşam asya nivartyaişa sokam asya dadāti ca Bhayancāsya karotyeşa mohayaistu muhur muhuh Sa eșa kaluşah kşudrachidraprekşi Dhananjaya 

Rajahpravstto mohātmā mānuşāņām upadravah." On this Abhinava comments as follows: 

“Eşa tāvat sūkşma utpattisamaye alakşya indriyeșu" etc. 

IMPORTANCE OF THE BHAGAVADGITĀ IN THE EYES OF 

THE SAIVAS. 

Several teachers of Saivaism from the time of Vasugupta down to that of Abhinava commented upon the Bhagavad gītā. In the writings of our author there are very many quotations from it and often they are coupled with reference to Krsna as Guru'. It is, therefore, necessary to state here how Krsna is connected with the Trika Saivaism, and 

1. 

T.A., I, 162. 

HIS WORKS 

55 

consequently what position the Gītā does occupy in the Saiva literature. 

Here we may state by the way that in this and similar other cases our object in these pages is simply to explain why orthodox Saivas had a certain view about this or similar other matters. Whether they were right or wrong in these respects is altogether a different matter with which we are not concerned immediately. 

Although the Saivāgama had its origin between the third and the fourth centuries A. D., as we shall show in the next chapter, yet the orthodox Saivas regarded it as of very high antiquity, indeed of eternal existence like the Vedas. This view we find recorded by Abhinava in the 35th Āhnika of the Tantrāloka in which he traces the origin of the Saivāgama from Bhairava and represents Rāmacandra also to have studied it partly. In the Harivainsa Purana we are told that Krşna was taught the sixty-four monistic Saivāgamas by sage Durvāsas, the revealer of all of them in Kali age. Similarly, in the Mahābhārata, Moksa Parva, it is stated that he got instruction in the Dvaita and the Dvaitādvaita Saivāgamas, twenty-eight in number, from Upamanyu. It seems that it was because of the above statements that Krsna was thought by the Saivas to have been himself a follower of the Trika. Perhaps for this very reason the Bhagavadgītā is classed with the Agamas. 10. PARAMĀRTHA SARA. 

THE TITLE This work is called Paramārtha Sara, because it briefly states the most essential principles of the Trika philosophy. 

« Aryāśatena tad idam samkşiptam 

śāstrasāram atigudham."

According to Abhinava's own statement, it is an adaptation of the Adhāra Kārikās of Seșa Muni who is also referred to as Adhāra Bhagavān or Ananta Nātha. These Kārikās also were known as “Paramārtha Sāra". They gave in brief the most essential principles of the Sānkhya philosophy and taught that the final emancipation could be attained by discriminating between Prakrti and Puruşa. The original with a few omissions, additions and alterations was adapted to serve as a medium of teaching the most essential principles of the Trika: The adaptation consists of one hundred and five verses, though Abhinava's own statement as regards the number of its verses is : "In hundred Aryā verses I have summarised the essential principles of the Trika system which are so difficult to understand." 

P. S., 198. 

This, however, does not mean that Abhinava wrote only hundred verses and that the rest were subsequently added to them by some other hands. The fact is that the number refers to the verses concerned with the statement of the principles and not to all which constitute the existing text. Therefore, if we leave aside the first three verses, in the first of which he offers prayer and in the following two states the source and nature of his composition, and also the concluding two, we find the verses dealing with the subject matter to be only one hundred. This seems to have been his way of giving the number of verses in a particular work, as is testified by his Bodhapañcadasikā. Although this work actually consists of sixteen verses yet it is called Pancadasikā (consisting of 15 verses) bceause only in the first fifteen verses the Bodha is dealt with. The last is simply a concluding verse similar to the last two in the work under discussion,HIS WORKS

COMPARATIVE STUDY OF THE SOURCE AND 

THE ADAPTATION. There is a difference of opinion among scholars as regards the text which was the source of Abhinava's adaptation. Dr. Barnett, who was perhaps the first scholar to study the philosophical works of Abhinavagupta, remarks in J. R. A. S. (1910) P. 708 : 

"Our Paramārtha Sāra must be distinguished from another little work of the same name, of which an edition was published in 1907 at Madras, with a Telugu paraphrase by Pattisapu Venkateshvaradu. The latter consists of seventy-nine Aryā verses ; a considerable number of these are borrowed directly from our Paramārtha Sāra and with them have been incorporated others, the whole work being painted over with Vaişņava colours. Needless to say, it is valueless for the criticism of our book." 

Supposing the text of the Paramārtha Sāra, referred to by the learned Doctor, to be the same as that of the one pub lished in the Sabda Kalpadruma, Mr. J. C. Chatterji holds, on the contrary, that the very work, referred to by Dr. Barnett in the above paragraph, was adapted by Abhinava to suit his needs. He further adds in the same connection: "A comparison of the two texts would prove, to my mind, interesting and I propose to make it on another occasion," 

K S., P. 12. After a careful study of the available material on the subject, we are inclined to support the latter view. We also, like Mr. Chatterji, have not had access to the Madras edition of the Paramārtha Sāra, with a Telugu paraphrase. Our information about the supposed adapted Paramārtha Sāra is based on two editions. One of these forms a part of the Sabda Kalpadruma and the other has been published in the Trivendrum Sanskrit Series, Like Mr. Chatterji, 

58 

CHAPTER II 

we also feel little doubt that the text presented by these two editions is the same as that of the edition referred to by Dr. Barnett, because it fully answers the description of the Madras publication. This also consists of seventy nine Āryā verses. It may be noted here that the concluding line of the text appearing in the Sabda Kalpadruma states the number of verses to be 85. The Triven drum publication does have 85 verses. But the additional six verses have got nothing to do with the subject matter. They constitute a sort of introduction and were, therefore, perhaps, dropped by the scribes of the MSS. on which the two editions, the one included in the Sabda Kalpadruma and the other published at Madras, referred to by Dr. Barnett, are based. A considerable number of verses in the common text of the two publications is the same as that found in Abhinava's Paramārtha Sāra, and the whole of the original work is painted over with Vaişnava colours. Consult, for instance, the verses 25 and 59 of the Sabda Kalpadruma. 

This work was held to be very sacred, so much so that Abhinava in his Bh. G. S. quotes from it as from a Sruti the following verse : 

"Tīrthe śvapacagrhe vā naștasmrtirapi parityajan deham 

Jñānasamakalamuktah kaivalyam yāti hataśokah." 

DEBh. G. S., Ch. VIII, 7. It may be pointed out here that this verse is found without the least difference in Abhinava's Paramārtha Sāra also. But it cannot be supposed to be a quotation from that; firstly, because, as we have already said, Bh. G. S. comes before the Paramārtha Sara in the chronological order of his works; secondly, because it is given as a quotation from Sruti, as the context given below shows : 

Evar hi sati jñāninopi yāvaccharīrabhāvidhātudoşa vikalitacittavrtter jadatāprāptasya tāmasasyeva gatih 

HIS WORKS 

59 

syāt na cābhyupagamotra yuktah pramāṇabhūtaśruti virodhat asti hi "tīrthe syapaca" etc; 

Bh. G. S., Ch. VIII, 7. thirdly, because, had the quotation been from his own work he would have stated so, as it is his clearly marked practice in this and other works; and fourthly and lastly, because of Mr. Chatterji's reason in support of the earlier date of the adapted text than that of our author, namely, that a verse from it is quoted in the Spanda Pradīpikā by Utpala Vaisnava, who was an older contemporary of Abhinava, if not his predecessor, as we shall show in the next chapter (K. S., P. 13). Thus the supposition of the earlier existence of the work accessible to us does not seem to be unreasonable. We, therefore, are of opinion that the Paramārtha Sāra of Abhinava is an adaptation of the work published in the Sabdakalpadruma and in the Trivendrum series. 

We attempt below to compare briefly the language of the two to further strengthen our opinion : 

"Nānāvidhavarnānām varnan dhatte yathāmalah sphatikah, 

Tadvadupādher gunabhāvitasya bhävam vibhur dhatte." 

A. K., S. 7. 

and "Nanavidhavarnānām rūpān dhatte yathāmalah sphatikah Suramānuşapaśupādaparāpatvam tadvadīšopi." 

P.S., S. 6. Here the difference of principle will be apparent to any one familiar with the ideas of the two systems. According to the Sāükhya, limitation is the result of the nearness of its cause with what is limited and the two have separate independent existence. But, according to the Trika, it is simply a result of the free will of the one who is all powerful and independent of whom nothing has or can have an existence. However, because of the commonness 

60 

CHAPTER II 

of the idea that this limitation is only apparent and that the pure being is in reality as little affected by these varying conditions as a crystal is by the various things which cast their reflections on it, Abhinava has retained in his adaptation so much of the language of the original that any one having the two verses before him can confidently say that one is an adaptation of the other. 

But when there is no such difference of principles, we find the very language of the original without the alteration of even a letter, as in the following instance : - 

"Punyāya tirthasevā nirayāya śvapacasadananidhanagatih 

Punyāpunyakalaukasparsābhāve tu kim tena." These lines constitute the 74th verse of the original and the 84th of the adaptation. 

Further, we find certain portions of the original altogether omitted, because they deal with matters in which the two systems fundamentally differ, as for instance, that part in which the original deals with the effect of the mere presence of Puruşa in bringing about all activity in the insentient senses : “Yadvadacetanam api sannikațasthe bhrāmake bhramati loham 

Tadvat karanasamühas ceştati cidadhisthite dehe." 

A. K., S. 3. We also find in the adaptation certain verses which cannot at all be traced in the original. These are mainly those which deal with the ideas peculiar to Trika Saivaism, as for instance, those which describe the eleven Tattvas in which this system believes in addition to those which it has in common, at least in point of names, with the Sankhya system : 

"Sivasaktisadāśivatām īśvaravidyāmayim ca tattvadaśam 

Saktīnām pancānām vibhaktabhāvena bhāsayati."

54 11. IŚVARA PRATYABHIJNĀ VIMARSINI. 

This is Abhinava's commentary, called Vimarsini, on Utpalācārya's Iśvara Pratyabhijñā Sūtras. This is called Laghvi Vimarsini also, because of its being a comparatively less detailed commentary than the Isvara Pratyabhijña Vivrti Vimarsins. According to the old method of calcula tion, in which a group of thirty-two syllables was counted as one Sloka, the former work consists of four thousand and the latter of eighteen thousand Slokas and, therefore, they are also known as Catussahasrī and Aşțādaśasahasri respectively. The contents of this work will be dealt with in the second part. 

12. IśVARA PRATYABHIJMA VIVRTI VIMARSINI. 

It is an unpublished commentary of Abhinava on Utpala cārya's commentary called “Vivrti" on his own Pratyabhijña 

62 

CHAPTER II 

Sūtras, as Abhinava himself states in one of the introductory verses to this book : 

"Srimal Lakşmanagupta darsitapathaḥ 

śrīpratyabhijñāvidhau Țikārthapravimarsinīm racayate vrttim praśişyo guroh." This is the penultimate work of Abhinava. It clears up most of the points which are not very clear in the Laghvi Vimarsinī. But the readers will be pained to know that Utpalācārya's Țikā, on which it is a commentary, has not so far been found inspite of vigorous searches made by so many enthusiasts. Perhaps, unfortunately, it is irrecoverably lost. 

The eight smaller works of Abhinava, which we are giving in Appendix (B) to this thesis, can be divided into two classes : (I) propagandistic booklets or leaflets on the Trika Saivaism and (II) Stotras. To the former belong : 

13. Anuttarastikā, 14. Paramārtha Dvādasikā, 15. Paramārtha Carcā and 16. Mahopadeśa Vimsatika. And to the latter class belong 17. Krama Stotra, 18. Bhairava Stava, 19. Dehastha Devatā Cakra Stotra and 20. Anubhava Nivedana. 

All the four pamphlets are concerned with the explana tion of the phenomenon of the universe as non-different from the highest reality, which is spoken of as "Anuttara" in the first, “Paramārtha" in the second and the third and “Prapancottirna" and "Viśvamūrti" in the last of the first group. They state that the realisation of the highest reality, as they represent it, is the only way to salvation. 

HIS WORKS 

63 

The first line of the second verse of the Anuttarāștikā : "Samsārosti na tattvatas tanubhrtām bandhasya 

vārtaiva kā" is quoted by Jayaratha in his commentary on the Tantrāloka III, 99. Although in this work we find some of the similes very commonly used by the Vedāntins to explain the unreality of the universe, for instance : 

"Mithyāmohaksdeşa rajjubhujagacchāyāpiśācabhramah," yet it would be a mistake to think that the Trika conception of the universe is the same as that of the Vedānta. For, the former is Abhāsavāda and the latter is Vivartavāda. For fuller information on this refer to the 2nd chapter in the 2nd part. 

Paramārtha Dvādaśikā was known as Advaya Dvādasi kā also, because the second verse : 

"Yadyatattvaparihārapurvakaṁ tattvam eşi 

tadatattvam eva hi Yadyatattvam atha tattvam eva vā tat tvam eva 

nanu tattvam idrśam." 

P. D., S. 2. is quoted by Ramyadevācārya in his commentary on Cakrapāninātha's Bhāvopahāra, S. 45, with the introductory remark "Advayadvādaśikāyāmapi." 

As regards Stotras, about the first two, viz., the Krama and the Bhairava, we have already spoken in discussing the date of Abhinavagupta. Here it may be added in connection with the latter that in old Pandit families of Kashmir there is still current a tradition which says that Abhinava, while entering the Bhairava cave for his last Samadhi, was reciting this Stotra. 

In the Dehastha Devata Cakra Stotra Abhinava shows that the attendant deities of siva, mentioned in the Purānas, 

64 

CHAPTER II 

are found associated with him even when he is in the body as a limited self (Siva eva grhītapaśubhāvah). Though in the latter case their names and forms are different yet their functions are the same. For instance, in the Purānas he is said to have got two door-keepers, Ganeśa and Batuka. They accompany him even when he assumes limitations as an individual (Pasupramātā) to guard two of the nine doors of the body. Of course, in this case, they are called Prāņa and Apāna. Jayaratha echoes this very idea when in his commentary on the Tantrāloka I, 6, he says the following with regard to Gaņeśa and Batuka : 

"Asya hi prāņavyāptirasti ityevam nirdiśanti guravah" 

and «Vastuto hi apānavyāptirasyāsti ityevam nirdeśaḥ", respectively. 

Regarding the Anubhava Nivedana it may be stated here that we attribute it to Abhinava on the authority of a tradition only. We have so far not been able to find any internal or external literary evidence to support it. The colophon says nothing about its authorship and no quotation from it have we, so far, discovered anywhere. We are, therefore, not quite sure that the tradition is well founded. We have, however, included it in the list of Abhinava's works, because we found it in an old collection of Abhinava's Stotras in the possession of Harabhatt Shastri of Kashmir. 21. TANTROCCAYA. 

This is another summary of the great work, Tantrāloka, smaller than the Tantrasāra but bigger than the Tantra vaţadhānikā. Although both the introductory and the concluding verses speak of its being a work of Abhinava, yet the language, the style and the method of treatment of the subject matter, give rise to grave doubt about its being from the pen of Abhinava. 

HIS WORKS 

65 

22. GHAȚAKARPARAKULAKA VIVRTI. 

Ghatakarpara is an interesting poem of twenty one verses. It is of the type of the famous Meghaduta. There is just one point of difference : while Meghaduta is from the lips of the lover, here it is the separated beloved that mostly speaks, only a few lines being from others such as her friend and messenger etc. It is interesting to note in this connection that according to the published commentary of Pandit Ramcharit Sharma, a modern scholar, the whole of the poem is from the beloved. Its author, according to the tradition inherited and recorded by Abhinava, was Kalidasa.? Its title was probably suggested by the word "Ghatakarpara” occurring in the last line of the poem in which the author, being extremely confident of his all-surpassing skill in writing Yamakas, humorously vows to carry water in a potsherd for him who can defeat him in writing Yamakas. 3 

The Vivrti is Abhinava's learned and interesting commentary on the work under discussion. According to him the 20th verse is not from the pen of Kālidāsa ; it is a later interpolation. The belief, therefore, in some quarters that this poem is a composition of the poet, Ghatakarpara, who, according to a literary tradition was one of the nine gems in the court of King Vikramāditya, is evidently ill-founded. 

In addition to the twenty-one verses commented upon by Abhinava, there is a benedictory verse in the beginning. The MS. gives number one to this verse and two to the following. The question, therefore, naturally arises "Is it a part of the poem?" For the following reasons our opinion on this point is that it is a benedictory verse of Abhinava

CHAPTER II 

at the commencement of the commentary and not the first verse of the poem. Its wrong place and the wrong number of the first introductory verse of the poem are due to scribal mistakes : 

(I) Had it been a part of the poem Abhinava would not have left it uncommented. 

(II) While Kālidāsa often, particularly in minor poems, does not offer benediction, Meghadūta and Srutabodha for instance, we have not so far discovered any work of Abhinava without a benedictory verse in the beginning, 

(III) This verse is not found in the Nirnaya Sagar edition. 

It may be pointed out here that the published text differs from that of the MS., on which our study is based, on the following points. For convenient reference we call the former "A" and the latter "B". 

(1) The first five verses of "A" occur as verses from the 15th to the 19th in "B". 

(II) The verses 15th and 21st of "A" are not found in "B". 

(III) Similarly the 10th verse of "B" is not found in "A": 23. BIMBAPRATIBIMBA VÄDA 

This work is noticed in two catalogues (1) Dr. Bühler's Kashmir catalogue and (2) Dr. Bhandarkar's Report of the collection of Sanskrit MSS. in 1875-76. A careful study of a copy of the MS. of the work in question, kindly supplied by the curator of the Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute, Poona, tells us that this work, though noticed as a separate work of Abhinava, is in reality only a part of the 3rd Ahnika of the Tantraloka in which he refutes the Bimbapratibimba theory of the Naiyāyikas and establishes that of the Saivas,HIS WORKS 

67 

A comparison of the verses 1 to 23 of the third Āhnika and the commentary thereon with the MS. No. 469 of 1875-76 in the B. O. R. I. will convince anybody. In fact the colophon very clearly states that the Bimbapratibimba Vada is only an extract from the Tantraloka, 1 

24. ANUTTARA TATTVA VIMARSINI VRTTI 

Prof. P. P. S. Shastri's descriptive catalogue of the MSS. in the Tanjore Palace Library informs us that there are two MSS. of this work in the said Library ; but un fortunately both of them are incomplete. The extracts given by the learned Professor leave no doubt about Abhinava's authorship of the work. It may be pointed out here that there is no foundation for Prof. P. P. S. Shastri's guess : 

"The work under notice is perhaps his (Abhinava's) commentary on Utpalācārya's Isvarapratyabhijñā, a metrical summary of Saivaism." 

A careful comparison of the extracts from the MS. on pages 6360-1 with the Parātrimśikā Vivarana of Abhinavagupta, published by the Research Department of Kashmir, leaves no doubt about its being another and smaller commentary of Abhinava on the Parātrimśikā, an extract from the Rudrayāmala Tantra. Compare, for instance, the following : 

"Iha khalu svātmadevataiva pramathyamānāvasthāyām atmānam parāmarsenānavaratam prcchatītyata ucyate : 

“S'rīdevyuvāca" Kim prcchatītyata āha : "Anuttaram" iti "Anuttaram syātmadeva

and "Srīdevyuvāca" *Anuttaram katham deva Sadyah kaulika siddhidam Yena vijñātamätrena Khecarīsamatām vrajet." 

P. T. V., 3. The few small differences between the two texts can be explained as due to either scribal mistakes or local variations in reading 

A set of his works dealing with the Anuttara, Abhinava used to refer to as "Anuttaraprakriyā". This fact we learn from Jayaratha's following comment on the above word : 

"Anuttaraprakriyāyāmiti parātrimsikā-vivaraņādavityar thah.” 

T. A., Comm., VI, 249. The two works under discussion are apparently of the said set. It was a common practice among the Kashmir writers of the 10th and the 11th centuries to write more than one commentary on the same work. Utpalācārya, the grand teacher of Abhinava, for instance, has written two commentaries on his own Isvarapratyabhijñākarikā, namely, the Vrtti and the Vivrti, the first being the smaller of the two. 

CHAPTER III HISTORICAL BACKGROUND OF HIS THOUGHT 

In the last chapter we have divided the literary activity of Abhinava into three periods and have placed the Tantric period first of all. In this chapter we propose to trace the historical background of his Tantric, philosophic and alankārika thoughts. We may state at the very outset that our subject being "A Study of Abhinavagupta", we do not mean to follow the traditional method of tracing the origin of the three subjects, on which he worked, to some ideas found in the Vedas and their development through the later literature till they got the respective names by which they are now known. We shall strictly confine ourselves to stating what idea of their history we get from the writings of Abhinava himself, and of his immediate predecessors, to whom he often refers, to enable the reader to picture to himself the stages in the development of these ideas at which Abhinava took them up and the modifications which he introduced into them. We may further add that certain statements in the following pages will appear more mythical than historical, particularly in the part, dealing with the history of the Tantric literature. But they have been given a place here, partly to let the reader know the orthodox belief in its high antiquity and partly for a grain of historical truth that we find therein. 

I HISTORICAL BACKGROUND OF HIS TANTRIC IDEAS 

The belief among the orthodox Saivas even today is that the Saivāgamas are of eternal existence like the Vedas. To this belief Abhinava has given a philosophical explanation in the Malini Vijaya Vartika which can be briefly put as follows: 

"Creation, or, to be more exact, manifestation, is, 

70 

CHAPTER III 

according to the Trika, of two kinds. One relates to speech and the other to substance (vācyavācakātmaka). Speech also is represented to be of two kinds, divine and human. The Saivāgamas are the divine speech and as such are the grossest manifestation of the supreme vimarsa, as different from the individual vimarśa which is the cause of the ordinary human speech. Speech, as we have already shown in the course of our treatment of the Parātrimśikā Vivarana, has an eternal existence in a state of identity with the Parā. The āgamas are but divine speech, and as such they also have similar eternal existence. According to the Trika, therefore, there can be nothing like an origin of the Saivāgamas. There is only appearance or reappearance of them at the divine will." 

These Agamas originally consisted of nine crores of verses. Bhairava alone knew them all. This āgamic lore, however, considerably lost in bulk as it was handed down by one divine being to the next after him. Literary tradition definitely says that the number of known verses decreased by one crore in the case of each of the remaining eight divine beings according to the order of their succession, shown below : 

1. Bhairava. 2. Bhairavī Devī. 3. Svacchanda. 4. Lākula. 5. Aņurāt. 6. Gahanesa. 7. Abjaja. 8. Sakra. 9. Guru. 

The last mentioned, namely, Guru, taught the known 

HISTORICAL BACKGROUND OF HIS THOUGHT 

71 

portion of the Agamas in parts to the following eight, according to their individual receptive power : 

1. Dakşa etc. 2. Sarvarta etc. 3. Vāmana etc. 4. Bhārgava. 5. Bali. 6. Simha. 7. Vinatābhū. 

8. Vāsukināga. Out of the part of the Agamas in heaven (in the possession of Sakra ?) Rāvana took one-half, which was partly handed down from generation to generation in the following order : 

1. Bibhīşana. 2. Rāma. 3. Laksmana. 4. Siddhas. 5. Dānavas. 6. Guhyakas. 

7. Yogins. This, in brief, is the orthodox history of the Saivāgamas from the time of Satyayuga to our age (Kaliyuga) as given by Abhinava in the 35th Ahnika of the Tantrāloka. It is based on the authority of the Siddhā Tantra and the 

tradition that he heard from his teachers. 

But when the iron age (Kaliyuga) was sufficiently advanced, the sages, who were in possession of the Saiva tantric traditions, retired to places inaccessible to ordinary mortals. The Saiva tantric tradition, therefore, dis appeared from the ordinary society and spiritual darkness

prevailed. Once Srikantha, (this is one of the names of Siva) while roaming over the mountain Kailāsa, was touched with pity for the suffering humanity, which was then immersed in spiritual darkness caused by the dis appearance of the Saivāgamas. He, therefore, instructed the sage, Durvāsas, to revive the Saivāgamic teaching, The sage accordingly divided all the Saivāgamas into three classes according as they taught monism, dualism or monism-cum-dualism, imparted their knowledge to his three mind-born sons, Tryambaka, Amardaka and Srīnātha respectively, and charged each one of them separately with the mission of spreading the knowledge of their respective āgamas. Thus there came into existence three Saiva Tantric Schools, each known by the name of the first earthly propagator. It may be noted here that there is one more ägamic school which is known as “half-Tryambaka' (ardhatryambaka) because it was founded by a descendant of Tryambaka on the side of his daughter. 

We have not made any considerable attempt up to this time to search for the preceptorial lines of the Dvaita and the Dvaitādvaita Tantras. Whatever information, however, we have been able to collect from the available sources on the teachers of these two schools and their contributions to the Saiva literature, to which there are repeated references in Abhinava's works, we shall put in the middle of this very chapter. As regards the successive teachers of the Advaita Tantras, we find a tolerably good account in the closing chapter of the Sivadrșți of Somānanda, the great grand teacher of Abhinava. In that he represents himself to be the 19th descendant of Tryambaka, the founder of the Advaita Tantric School. Of the first fourteen ancestors after Tryambaka he did not know much. His account of the (fifteenth is a little definite. According to this, his name I was Samgamāditya; he married a Brāhmana girl, came

to Kashmir in the course of his roaming and settled down there. The names of the three descendants between Samgamāditya and Somānanda are given below in the order of their succession : 

1. Varşāditya. 2. Aruņāditya. 

3. Ananda? In the foregoing account of the origin of the system in the hoary past, its long propagation, gradual decay, temporary disappearance and reappearance at the time from which the history now is traceable, there is nothing extraordinary. This seems to have been the traditional method of describing the high antiquity of a system. Leaving other books of lesser importance aside, if we take up such an important book as the Bhagavadgītā we find that there too Krsna similarly speaks of the antiquity of the Karmayoga in the following lines in the beginning of the 4th Chapter : 

"Imam vivasvate yogam proktavän aham avyayam Vivasvān manave prāha manurikşvākavebravīt Evam paramparāprāptam idam rājarşayo viduḥ Sa kālencha mahatā yogo naştah Parantapa Sa evāyam mayā tedya yogah proktah purātanah." 

Bh. G., ch. IV, S. 1-2. 

All this, however, is not without any historical importance. Here also the shrewd eye of a researcher can find a few grains of historical truth. And what our not very much trained eyes have been able to find in the above 

account we state as follows: 

Somānanda speaks of himself as the 19th descendant of Tryambaka. He was a great grand teacher of Abhinava 

1. Ś. Dr., Ch. 7. (MS.)

CHAPTER III 

whose date of birth we have fixed at about the middle of the 10th century A. D. It is, therefore, very probable that he was a contemporary of Bhatta Kallata, who, as we know from the Rājataranginī, lived in the reign of king Avantivarman of Kashmir (855-883 A. D.) In fact Bhatta Kallața also was a great grand teacher of Abhinava from the side of Bhattendurāja, who was Abhinava's teacher in the Bhagavadgītā. For, Bhattendurāja was a pupil of Mukula, son of Bhatta Kallata. This statement is based on the combined authority of Bhattendurāja's commentary on the Kāvyāla nkāra Sāra and Mukula's Abhidhāvịtti Mātņkā in which the following lines occur : 

"Srutvā saujanyasindhor dvijavara Mukulāt" 

and 

"Bhatta Kallaţa putrena Mukulena nirūpitā 

Sūri prabodhanāyeyam Abhidhāvștti Mātěkā.” 

If, therefore, Somānanda belonged to the later half of the 9th century A. D., it would not be wrong to say that the monistic, the dualistic and the dualistic-cum-monistic schools of Saivaism arose in the last quarter of the 4th century A. D. For, if we follow the traditional method of allowing 25 years for each generation we will have to admit that a period of four hundred and fifty years inter vened between Tryambaka, the founder of the monistic school of Saivaism, and Somānanda, the founder of the Pratyabhijna school ; because, the latter was the 19th descendant of the former. 

Thus, if different philosophical schools of S'aivaism arose towards the end of the 4th century A. D. it naturally follows that before that time there was no such distinction. This conclusion finds support in Abhinava's account of early Saivaism, because in that no difference of any kind is stated or indicated to have existed. Perhaps before that time 

HISTORICAL BACKGROUND OF HIS THOUGHT 

75 

Saivaism was simply a form of worship of the particular deity after which the faith was called and the introduction of the philosophical element came much later as a result of the influence of Buddhism. 

It is not possible for us to state the time of composition of the different Tantras, because very few of them are so far available. How can any correct conclusion be possible unless all of them or at least a respectable number of them be carefully read? As regards their division into the three Saiva schools, there seems to have existed a difference of opinion a little before the time of Abhinava ; for, there is the evidence of Kșemarāja that the Svacchanda Tantra, on which he has commented from the point of view of Saiva monism, was before his time explained in accordance with the principles of dualism. 

("Nāmnaiva bhedadrstir vidhutā yenāsvatantratatattvā Srimat Svatantra Tantram bhedavyākhyām na tat sahate.") 

Abhinavagupta, however, has made a clear cut division of these in his Tantrāloka as follows : 

"Dasāştādaśavasvaştabhinnam yacchāsanaṁ vibhoh." 

T. A., I, 35. 

And Jayaratha in his commentary on the above verse has given the list of the Tantras as follows: 

DVAITA TANTRAS. 

1. Kāmaja. 2. Yogaja. 3. Cintya. 4. Maukuta. 5. Arhśumat. 6. Dīpta. 7. Kāraņa. 

76 

CHAPTER III 

8. Ajita. 

9. Sükşma. 10. Sahasra. 

This division, according to his own statement is based on the authority of the Sri Srikanthi. 

(Etacca Sri Srikanthyām abhidhānapūrvakaṁ vistarata uktam. T. A., Comm., I, 39.) 

This authority was probably a recent one, and, therefore, was perhaps disputed. This supposition alone can justify the existence of a dualistic interpretation of the Svacchanda Tantra. 

In the introduction to the Mrgendra Tantra occurs the following quotation, giving the names of the ten Siva Tantras. This authority is different from that quoted by Jayaratha : 

*Kāmikam Yogajam vātha tathā Cintyaśca Kāraṇam Ajitam Dīpta Sūkşmau ca Sahasrasca tathāṁśumān Suprabhedastathā hyete saivāh samparikīrtitah." 

Introd., Mr. T., P. 2. 

It may be noted here that the MS. with the help of which the present edition of the Tantrāloka was brought out, was, perhaps, mutilated in that part which states the names of the dualistic Tantras and, therefore, there is left a gap after giving six-names. We have, however, completed the list with the help of Dr. Farquhar's Outline of Religious Literature in India P. 193, in which he gives all the ten names. It may be pointed out in this connection that this list instead of Maukuta and Kāmaja, gives Suprabha and Kāmika. At present we have not got sufficient material at our disposal to explain this difference.HISTORICAL BACKGROUND OF HIS THOUGHT

61. Dāmara 62. Atharvaka 63. Kabandha 64. Sirascheda 

This list of sixty-four monistic Tantras is based on the authority of the Srikanthi, a Saiva work quoted by Jayaratha in his commentary on the Tantrāloka, I, 42—3. We may add here that the above list of 64 Tantras is different from the one given in the Sabdārtha Cintāmaņi under «Tantra" on page 1048. The latter is based on the authority of the Siddhi Sarasvata and has certain names of Tantras in common with the former, e. g. Svatantra and Rudra Yāmala etc. and mentions the names of certain others which are quoted by Abhinava in the Tantrāloka, though not included in Jayaratha's list. 

THE FOURTH SAIVA TANTRIC SCHOOL. 

The fourth school of Saivaism owed its existence to a descendant of Tryambaka on his daughter's side and, there fore, was called Ardha-Tryambaka. The evidence which we have been able to collect so far leads us to think that it is the same system as that which is referred to in the Tantrā loka as Kula-Prakriyā. For, acccording to the statement of Jayaratha in the introduction to T. A., Ah. I, S. 7, Abhinava deals with the teachings of both the Tantra and the Kula in his Tantrāloka. Abhinava also pays his homage to his teachers in both the schools, as the following quotation shows : 

"Evanca tantraprakriyopāsannagurvabhimukhikaranā nantaram viśrāntisthānatayā kulaprakriyāgurum api utkarşayati." 

T. A., Comm., I, 31. 

If we read the following verse with the introduction to it, 

HISTORICAL BACKGROUND OF HIS THOUGHT 

81 

given above, it becomes evident that Sambhunātha was his teacher in the Kula system : 

"Jayatāt jagaduddhrtikşamosau Bhagavatyā saha Sambhunātha ekah. 

T. A., I, 31. 

Now in the concluding portion of the Tantrāloka Ah. 37, the author, while enumerating his teachers in different branches, refers to this very Sambhunātha not only as his teacher in the fourth school 

("Turyākhyasantatimahodadhipurnacandrah Sri Somatah sakalavit kila Sambhunāthah." 

T. A., Ah. 37, S. 61. (MS.) 

but also as a pupil of Soma, which is an abbreviated form of Somadeva, who was Sambhunātha's teacher in Atimārga or Kulamārga, as the following statement of Jayaratha in his commentary on the Tantrāloka, I, 213, coupled with a quotation makes clear : 

"Sri Sumatināthasya Somadevah Sișyah tasya Sri S'ambhunāthah yad vakşyati "Srī Somatah sakalavit kila Sambhunāthah" 

yattu 

"Kaścid daksinabhūmipīthavasatiḥ śrīmān vibhur Bhairavah Pancasrotasi sātimärgavibhave sastre vidhātā ca yah Lokebhūt Sumatis tatah samudabhūt tasyaiva sișyāgranīh Srīmāñchambhuriti prasiddhim agamaj-Jalandharāt pīthatah ityanyatroktam tat paramagurvabhiprāyena yojyam." 

We, therefore, hold that the words "atinaya", "kulamārga", “kālīnaya" and "ardhatryambakamathikā" stand for the same school of Saivaism.

THE TRACEABLE HISTORY OF THE FOURTH SCHOOL. 

We learn from the following quotation in T. A., Comm. that it had its origin in Kāmarūpa (Assam) and that its founder was the great sage, Mīna alias Macchanda Vibhu: 

"Bhairavyā Bhairavāt prāptam yogam vyāpya tatah priye 

Tatsakāśāttu siddhena Minākhyena varānane Kāmarūpe mahāpīthe Macchandena mahātmanā." 

T . A., Comm., I., 24. The commentator has cleared the point that Macchanda was the founder of the fourth school by describing him as "Turyanātha" in the introduction to that Sloka of the 1st Ahnika of the Tantraloka in which the author offers his salutation to him (Macchanda Vibhu). Here the word “turya" stands for "Turyākhyasantati” referred to in a quotation given above. 

We know nothing at this stage of the names or number of the successive teachers of this school till we come to Sumati, the great grand teacher of Abhinava in this branch. He belonged to Southern Pītha (Dakṣiṇabhūmipīthavasatih). The names of the teachers who came after him are given below in the order of their succession : 

1. Somadeva. 2. Sambhunātha. 3. Abhinavagupta. 

II. HISTORICAL BACKGROUND OF HIS PHILOSOPHIC IDEAS 

T'he rise of the monistic Saiva philosophy in Kashmir. 

In the preceding few pages we have tried to trace the history of the monistic Tantras, on which the monistic Saiva philosophy is based, from the earliest time down to that of 

HISTORICAL BACKGROUND OF HIS THOUGHT 

83 

Somānanda (circa 850). It was about this time that the monistic Saiva philosophy arose in Kashmir. 

THE CAUSES OF ITS RISE. 

The rise of a system presupposes the existence of the material out of which it is to be built, of the capable men who can give it the required shape and of the immediate public necessity which it has to satisfy. A century or so before the time of the actual rise of this system, men, material and need for any such thing as the monistic Saiva philosophy were all lacking in Kashmir. For, we have shown above how monistic Tantras, on which this system is based, had their origin outside the valley of Kashmir ; how the traditional Tantric lore was brought to Kashmir only about the middle of the 8th century by the fourth ancestor of Somānanda and how Atrigupta, the renowned Saiva philoso pher of Kannauj and the earliest known ancestor of Abhinava, the greatest authority on the Pratyabhijñā, was brought to Kashmir by king Lalitāditya sometime after 740 A. D. And we know from the following quotation : 

"Sūtram vrttir vivrtir Laghvi Brhatītyubhe Vimarsinyau 

Prakaranavivaranapañcakam iti śāstram 

Pratyabhijñāyāḥ," given by Madhava in his Sarvadarśana Samgraba that the Pratyabhijñā literature is a mere exposition of the principles laid down by Somānanda in his Sivadrști, which was called by him “Prakarana" and that the authoritative books on this are the following: - 

1. Pratyabhijñā Sūtra. Vrtti. 

Utpala. Vivști. Vimarsins. 

Abhinava Vivrti Vimarsini. 

Hii 

ni 

CHAPTER III 

We know also that all these three writers belonged to the two learned immigrant families, namely, of Somānanda and of Abhinava, referred to above. 

Thus a century before the rise of the monistic system Kashmir was lacking both in men and material for building up its own school of philosophy. As for the public necessity, there is evidence to show that there was none. In support of this statement we would content ourselves here with simply quoting Dr. Stein's remark which endorses our view that the general public were quite satisfied with the then existing religious conditions and did not require any philosophical system to satisfy their spiritual needs : 

"The contrast, which this (Kalhaņa's) partiality for Buddhist cult and traditions presents to avowed Saivaism of Kalhana, is more apparent than real. For centuries before Kalhana's time Buddhism and the orthodox creeds had existed peacefully side by side in Kashmir. As far as the laity was concerned they had to a great extent amalgamated. His own narrative from the point where it reaches historical ground gives ample proof of this. Of almost all royal and private individuals, who are credited with the foundation of Buddhist Stūpas and Vihāras, it is recorded that they, or at least members of their family, with equal zeal endowed also shrines of Siva or Vişnu." / R. T., Introd., P. 9 

ANCIENT FAITH OF KASHMIR. 

One question will naturally arise here in the reader's mind, viz., if Tantric Saivaism is a thing of later introduc tion in Kashmir, what was its religion before that ? Before attempting to answer this question we may state here that for our answer we have primarily to depend upon what little historical truth we find in Kalhana's mostly legendary account of the earlier kings of Kashmir. After this introduc 

HISTORICAL BACKGROUND OF HIS THOUGHT 

85 

tory remark we may at once say that it was a polytheistic religion, as described in the Nīlamata Purāna and that Siva, as associated with his spouse, was its most popular god. Because, when & religious point arises after the coronation of Yasovatī, the 3rd of Gonanda line of Kashmir, Krşņa quotes the authority of the Nīlamata Purāņa in support of his view (R. T., ch. I, 71-72.) Similarly, when the religion of the land is represented to have suffered at the hands of the Bauddhas with Nāgārjuna as their head, the reference is to nothing else than the ritualistic performances prescribed in the Nīla Purāņa : 

“Kriyām Nīlapurāņoktām ācchindan agamadvişah." 

R. T., ch. I, 178. Further, when Candra, a descendant of Kaśyapa, propitiated Nīla, the lord of the (Kashmir) Nāgas, who being angry at the suspension of the customary oblation because of Buddhistic influence, had sent down the destructive snow fall, the religion that was revealed to him anew was no other than that of the Nila Purāņa. (R. T., ch. I, 183.) 

Whatever opinion we may hold about Kalhana's account of the kings and their administration in the earlier part of his chronicle, in view of the fact that Tantric Saivaism was of as late introduction into Kashmir as the 8th century A.D. and that when Buddhism entered Kashmir at the time of Asoka there was already a religion there, the prominent feature of which was the worship of Ardhanārī Nateśvara, it will not be unreasonable to suppose that Kalhaņa at least in his statement in regard to the ancient faith or religion of the land is generally not wrong. 

SOIL FOR THE GROWTH OF TANTRIC SAIVAISM. 

It has been pointed out in the preceding two paragraphs that the old religion of the land of Kaśyapa was polytheistic 

86 

CHAPTER III 

with a special inclination towards ritualistic Saivaism. It was purely a traditional faith and had no literature of its own at the time of the advent of Buddhism in Kashmir in the reign of Asoka (273-232 B. C.). But so wise was then the way in which Buddhism was spread, so non interfering was the religious policy and so judicious was the royal patronage of different religions that Brāhmanas did not very much feel the advent of the new religion. Antagonism of Brahmaņas, however, was aroused when in consequence of Kaniska's gift (125-60 A. D.) of Kashmir to Buddhistic Church*, Nāgārjuna came to power and began to use his power of both learning and position to spread Buddhism. The fact that this was the time when the struggle between Buddhism and Saivaism began seems to find support in the tradition recorded by Varadarāja in the following introductory verse to his Vārtika on Vasugupta's Siva Sūtras : 

"Nāgabodhyādibhih siddhair nāstikānām purahsaraih 

Akrānte jīvalokesmin ātmeśvaranirāsakaih." 

S. S. V., 1. Here we take "Nāgabodhi" to stand for "Nāgārjuna Bodhisattva," on the following authority : 

"Nāgārjunena sudhiyā bodhisattvena pālitāh." 

R. T., I, 175. 

The immediate effect of this was that the teachings of the local religion, which were till then simply a matter of Hoating traditions, were systematised for the first time by a pious Brāhmaṇa ascetic, Candradeva. This in our opinion is the one historical truth in Kalhana's story of the destruc tive snow-fall sent by Nīla, enraged at the abeyance of religious rights prescribed in the Nīla Purāņa in consequence

T., Introd. P. 77) "but the réchauffé of an ancient legend told in the Nīlamata Purāna, which relates the deliverance of Kashmir from the plague of the Piśācas through the rites revealed by Nila Nāga." 

What important events took place in the following six hundred years in the history of the local faith of Kashmir we do not know anything about. The only thing that we can say is that the local religion being polytheistic accepted Buddha also as one of its gods. Therefore, whatever conflict of views may have existed among the priests of both Buddhism and Saivaism regarding religious matters, common people, as has already been stated, followed a mixed faith. That both influenced each other was a matter of course. Thus there developed a religion which was neither purely Buddhistic nor purely Saivaite, but was a harmonious mixture of the meditative and philosophical aspect of the one and the ritualistic aspect of the other ; but as such it had no scriptural authority to support it. Thus, there was already the soil congenial for the growth of Tantric Saivaism which gives ritual and philosophy more or less the same place as was probably given them by the then popular faith, so that when it came with all the scriptural support at its back, it was accepted by the common people of Kashmir as their ancestral faith. Even today Tantric Saivaism is the faith of Kashmir Hindus, though now it is considerably mixed with Vedic rituals. 

INFLUENCE OF S'AŃKARĀCĀRYA. - 

For over nine centuries the local faith had been influenced by Buddhism. For about the same period the people of

Kashmir had professed a mixed faith and had heard enough of the idealistic philosophy and perhaps thought also over it. Their minds, therefore, were sufficiently trained to receive and to retain philosophical ideas. For about a century they had seen the Tantric Saiva rituals practised by the two great Saiva families which had migrated into Kashmir and had heard their philosophical ideas. Perhaps many families, not finding any fundamental difference between this and the religion that they and their predecessors had professed for centuries, had also accepted it. The decline of Buddhism had come. Kumārila Bhatta (about 750 A. D.) had shaken its roots. Such was the opportune time when Sankarācārya visited Kashmir some time in the second decade of the 9th century after giving his final blow to Buddhism in the rest of India (Sankara Digvijaya, ch. XVI, 54-80). Let us state here very clearly that our statement about Sankāracārya's visit to Kashmir has no other authority than that of the Sankara Digvijaya, quoted above. Let us, however, add that it does not appear to be altogether baseless : firstly, because it is supported by a local tradition which is still current in Kashmir and secondly, because the influence of Sankara's Tantric philosophy on the Trika is so great that the supposition of a personal touch of its founder-writers with Sankara seems to be necessary to explain it at such an early time. If we compare the philosophical ideas of Sankara, as contained in his Dakşiņā Mürti Stotra and explained by his pupil Sureśvarācārya in his commentary on the above stotra, we find that Sankara's conception of the ultimate reality is the same as that of the Pratyabhijñā. In fact he uses all the important technical expressions in the same sense in which they are used in the Pratyabhijñā. Compare for 

instance :

I. P. V., I, 29. We, therefore, feel that, whatever be the amount of fiction with which Madhava may have coloured Sankara's visit to Kashmir, it is not without a grain of truth inas much as the said visit was a fact. Further, we are of opinion that Sankara believed in the monistic Tantras, as the epithet "sarvatantrasvatantra" in his virudāvalī indi cates; that the Tantras, the authority of which he accepted, were sixty-four in number, as his reference to them in his own Saundarya Laharī in the following line : 

"Catuhşaștyā tantraih sakalam abhisandhāya bhuvanam" clearly shows; that he had a special inclination towards

the Tantric practices of Kashmir, as his establishing Srīcakra in some of his Mathas testifies; and that in his exposition of the Vedānta he was greatly influenced by the philosophical parts of the aforesaid Tantras, as we shall point out at different places in the philosophical portion of this thesis. 

The visit of such a great person, particularly after uprooting Buddhism in the course of his Digvijaya, (if this be taken to be an historical fact) was of no little importance to the philosophical system that was soon to come into existence. This visit purged the local faith of its Buddhistic element, strengthened the position of the new Tantric creed, which was brought by the two immigrant families and had already begun to be accepted by the populace, and aroused their curiosity to know more about the new creed. 

THE RISE OF KASHMIR SAIVAISM. 

Thus men and material being already there in the two immigrant families and those that followed them, as for instance, that to which Vasugupta, the author of the S'iva Sūtra, belonged, and the need for a systematic presentation of the new faith in both its philosophical and ritualistic aspects having been created by the visit of Sarkarācārya, the Kashmir Saivaism made its appearance without much delay. 

Our object in these pages, we may state here, is not to trace the history of the divine S'aiva literature so much as to give an idea of the human literature that had been written before Abhinava on the subject of Kashmir S'aivaism so as to clearly show what our great writer contributed to it. In this chapter, therefore, we shall deal with the writings of his predecessors only. We shall speak on his successors in the next chapter and shall show how far he influenced their 

ideas.

THE SPANDA BRANCH. (1). Vasugupta and his S'iva Sūtra. On the authority of the Rājatarangini (ch. V, 66) we know that Bhatta Kallața, the pupil of Vasugupta was a con temporary of Avantivarman, King of Kashmir (855-883 A.D.). There he is referred to as "siddha". It is, therefore, evident that at that time he was an old man of established reputation. Vasugupta, the teacher of Kallaţa, therefore, it is natural to suppose, belongedt o the preceding scholastic generation extending from about 825 to 850 A. D. We shall, therefore, not be wrong if we say that Vasugupta gave a systematic form to the philosophical ideas of the monistic Tantras in his S'iva Sūtras in the next decade after S'ankarācārya's visit to Kashmir towards the end of the second decade of the 9th century A. D. 

Kșemarāja, in his introduction to the S'iva Sūtra Vimar šinī, records a tradition which says that Vasugupta was not the writer but simply the publisher of the Sūtras which he had found inscribed on a boulder to which he had gone, as instructed by S'iva in a dream, and which turned bottom upward at the mere touch of his hand. Whatever we may think of this tradition, it was believed in by his immediate successors, who refer to the S'iva Sūtras as of divine author ship. They are divided into three chapters dealing in succession with the three ways to final emancipation pointed out by the monistic Tantras. 

OTHER WORKS OF VASUGUPTA. 

2. Spanda Kārikā. There is a difference of opinion about the authorship of the Spanda Kārikā. Utpala Vaişnava on the strength of the 53rd Verse: 

"Vasuguptād avāpyedam guros tattvārthadarsinah 

Rahasyam ślokayāmāsa samyak śrī Bhatta Kallatah." 

Also ef. sp. Sandoka, opening line. 

92 

CHAPTER III 

attributes its authorship to Kallata. But it has to be noted in this connection that this verse is not found in the recension of Kșemarāja, who attributes the Kārikā to Vasugupta himself probably on the authority of the following verse, found in his recension : 

"Labdhvāpyalabhyam etaj jñānadhanam hrdguhāntah 

krtanihiteh Vasuguptavacchivāya hi bhavati sadā sarvalokasya." 

S. N., 16. 

About this quotation also it has to be pointed out that as the former is not found in the recension of Kșemarāja so the latter is not traceable in that of Utpala Vaişnava. We, however, follow Ksemarāja because he is supported by Maheśvarānanda who quotes this verse, as found in Kșema rāja's recension, in his commentary on the very first verse of his own Mahārtha Manjari. 

The Spanda Karikā is simply an amplification of the fundamental principles of S'aivaism, as aphoristically given in the S'iva Sūtras. It was also called Spanda Sūtra. Kșemarāja in one of his introductory verses to the Spanda Nirnaya refers to it as such 

"Samyak sütrasamanyayam parigatim tattve parasmin 

parām.. S'rī Spanda śāstrasya." 

S. N., I. This work has to be distinguished from "Spanda Sūtra" nos. 518-19 of Dr. Bühler's report; for, there the name stands for "S'iva Sūtra" (consult his extracts from MSS.). 

3. SPANDĀMỘTA. 

It is mentioned as a separate work of Vasugupta by Mr. J. C. Chatterji in his Kashmir Saivaism P. 37. He does not state any authority on this point. But our opinion is 

HISTORICAL BACKGROUND OF HIS THOUGHT 

93 

that it is the same as the Spanda Kārikā. In fact the word "Spandāmrta" does not stand for the title of a work. It is simply a metaphorical expression used for the fundamental principles of the Spanda system, as is clear from the use of this very word by Kşemarāja in one of the introductory verses to his Spanda Nirnaya : 

"Spandāmrte carvite tu Spandasandohato manāk” We know that the Spanda Sandoha is Ksemarāja's com mentary on the first verse of the Spanda Kārikā. Another place where this word has been found is the concluding verse of Kallata's Spanda Sarvasva : 

"Drbdham mahādevagirau maheśasvapnopadiştācchiva 

Sūtrasindhoh Spandāmrtam yad Vasuguptapādaih Srī Kallațas tat 

prakațīcakāra." Here also the word, if at all it stands for the title of a work, cannot refer to any other than the Spanda Kārikā itself on which the Spanda Sarvasva is a commentary. 

This verse seems to solve the riddle of the authorship of the Spanda Kārikā. Here Kallața himself represents Vasugupta to be the writer of the Spanda Kārikā; mark the words "Spandāmrtam drbdham" ("Drbhí granthe" Pāṇini's Dhātupātha) and clearly states his work in connection with the Kārikās to be simply that of a publisher : 

"Sri Kallațas tat prakațīcakāra". Perhaps this is a posthumous work of Vasugupta. If this explanation be taken to be correct there will remain no difficulty in harmoniously interpreting the two verses given above in this connection. For, “Rahasyam slokayāmāsa samyak", occurring in the Spanda Pradīpikā, can, without stretching the language, be interpreted as "well published the sacred doctrine."

4. VĀSAVI TIKĀ ON THE BHAGAVADGITĀ No complete MS. of this work has so far been dis covered. 

5. SIDDHĀNTA CANDRIKĀ. Noticed in Bühler's catalogue as MS. No. 501. 

(II) KALLAȚA (855 A. D.) What little we know about his person we have already stated while discussing the date of Vasugupta. Here, therefore, we confine ourselves to giving an account of his works only. 

1. SPANDA SARVASVA. It is a commentary on the Spanda Kārikā. 

2. TATTVĀRTHA CINTAMAŅI. This was a commentary on the last quarter of Vasugupta's S'iva Sūtra, as we learn from the 5th introductory verse of Bhaskarācārya to his Vārtika on the same S'iva Sūtra : 

"Vyākarot trikam ete (ke) bhyah Spandasūtraih 

U svakaistatha Tattavārthacintā manyakhyatīkayā khandam antimam". 

3. SPANDA SUTRA. From the portion italicized in the above quotation it appears that he wrote his own Spanda Sūtras also. 

4. MADHUVĀHINI. We have not been able to trace any reference to it ourselves; we are mentioning it here on the authority of Mr. J. C. Chatterji's Kashmir Saivaism P. 37. 

(III) RĀMA KANTHA. In the colophon to his commentary on the Spanda Karika he speaks of himself as Utpaladeva's pupil : 

“Krtih śrīmad-Utpaladevapādapadmopajīvinah Srimad Rājānaka Rāmakanthasya."

HISTORICAL BACKGROUND OF HIS THOUGHT 95 

We know that Utpala was Abhinava's grand teacher and, therefore, belonged to the first half of the 10th century A. D. We shall, therefore, not be very wrong if we say that he (Rāma Kantha) lived in the second and the third quarters of the 10th century A. D. '706 9 25-975AD) 

His Works. 1. SPANDA VIVARANA SĀRAMĀTRA. This is the name of his above-mentioned commentary as is apparent from the colophon : 

"Iti Spanda Vivarana Sāramātram samāptam." Two more works of this author are noted in K. S. with an interrogation mark against each. 

2. Commentary on the Matanga Tantra ? 3. Commentary on the Bhagavadgītā from the 

Saiva point of view ? 

(IV) BHĀSKARĀCĀRYA. Four generations intervened between Kallata and Bhāskarācārya. The latter belonged to the fifth generation from the former. The following are the names of his pre decessors in the order of their succession? : 

1. Pradyumna Bhatta. 2. Prajñārjuna. 3. Mahadeva Bhatta. 

4. Srikantha Bhatta. Abhinavagupta quotes in his Pratyabhijñā Vimarsins from the Vivekānjana of Divākaravatsa with the following remark: 

«Yadāha Bhatta Divākaravatso Vivekāñjane"

to himself as "Daivākarih" in S. S.V. referred to above, there does not remain much difficulty in fixing his date. Abhinavagupta's Pratyabhijña Vimarsini is the last of his available works and came after his Brhati Vimarsinī which was completed in 1015, as we have already shown in the chro nological order of his works. And Bhatta Kallata, we know, was king Avanti Varman's contemporary (855). Allowing, therefore, a period of about a century for the intervening four generations it will not be wrong, in our opinion, to say that he was an older contemporary of Abhinava, if not & predecessor. 

HIS WORKS. 1. SIVA SOTRA VĀRTIKA (published) 2. VIVEKANJANA (known from reference) 

3. KAKŞYA STOTRA. The last mentioned work is attributed to Bhattadivāka ravatsa by Yogarāja in his commentary on Abhinava's Paramārtha Sāra P. 103, as the following quotation shows: 

“Yathāha Bhatta Divākaravatsah Jāte dehapratyayadvípabhange Prāptaikadhye nirmale bodhasindhau Avyāvartya tvindriyagrāmam antar Viśvātmā tvath nitya ekovabhāsi' 

iti Kakşya Stotre." 

THE PRATYABHIJKĀ BRANCH. It may be pointed out at the very outset that the Pratyabhijñā” also, like the Spanda, is based on the monistic Saiva Tantras and that in point of the philosophical conception of the universe and its cause, and of the nature of the individual self and that of the highest reality there is no difference between the two. The only point where the two differ is the means of realising the Highest Reality. The1912 ya K ... T

(I) SOMĀNANDA. 

We have already pointed out that two teachers of Abhinava, namely, Lakşmaņagupta and Bhattendurāja, belong to two different preceptorial lines. The distance of both, Somānanda and Kallața, from Abhinava is only two intervening generations as the following table shows : 

1. Somānanda? 1. Kallața 2. Utpaladeva 

2. Mukula 3. Lakşmaņagupta3 . Bhattendurāja 

4. Abhinavagupta 4. Abhinavagupta We can, therefore, safely say that Somānanda was Kallata's contemporary, perhaps older, and belonged to the close of the first and the beginning of the second half of the 9th century A. D. 

HIS WORKS 

In the next generation after the so called discovery of the Siva Sūtras by Vasugupta and a sort of running commentary thereon in the form of the Spanda Kārikās by the same, but perhaps before a commentary on the latter by Kallața, Somānanda wrote his Sivadrști.

CHAPTER III 

1. 

S'IVADRSTI. 

While the works on the Spanda branch just mentioned are mere dogmatic statements of the Saiva doctrines, the Sivadrsti is an attempt to present the Saiva idealistic monism or monistic idealism in a systematic philosophical form coupled with the necessary reasoning. It consists of about 700 verses in seven chapters. Somānanda also, like Vasugupta, claims to have been inspired by Siva in a dream, but not simply to go to a boulder to find inscribed what was to be propagated, but to systematise the philosophical contents of the monistic Tantras. He clearly states that what he has given in the Sivadrsti, is not simply a creation of his own mind, but is based on the Sāstra «S'ivo dātā sivo bhokta."2 We have not so far been able to trace this quotation in any one of the Agamas to which we have had access. But the verse given below, of which the above quotation constitutes a part, is very well known and is daily recited in the Pandit families of Kashmir : 

“Sivo dātā sivo bhoktā śivah sarvam idam jagat S'ivo yajati yajñaśca yah śivah soham eva hi." 

We may, however, state that Abhinavagupta, while dealing with the Anupāyamārga, in the second Ahnika of his Tantrāloka, declares that he follows the authority of the Urmimahāśāstra. He further adds that this subject has been dwelt upon by earlier teachers beginning with Somānanda. The above-mentioned Tantra, therefore, was perhaps the authority which Somānanda followed. 

The quotation also may be from the same.

HIS WORKS. 1. IśVARA PRATYABHIJÑĀ KĀRIKĀ. This was the first work on the Pratyabhijñā system as such. In fact the system owes the name Pratyabhijñā to this book. Its importance, however, is due to two com mentaries of Abhinava, the Vimarsins and the Viyrti 

Vimarsinī. 

2. IśVARA PRATYABHIJNA VRTTI. It is a brief commentary mostly concerned with clarifying the ideas given in the Iśvara Pratyabhijñā Kārika.

Kārikā. According to the old way of counting thirty-two syllables of a prose book as one verse, it consisted of six thousand verses. It is to this that Abhinava refers as sīkā in one of his introductory verses to the Isvara Pratyabhijñā Vimarsinī. It is one of the five books of accepted authority on the Pratyabhijñā philosophy, referred to by Madhava in his summary of the Pratyabhijñā system in his Sarva Darśana Sangraha. It was on this that Abhinava wrote his famous commentary, Brhati Vimarsinī.

On this point there is the additional evidence of the Bhaskari, which not only attributes a commentary on the Sivadrști to Utpala but also places it before the Isvara Pratyabhijñā Kārikā in the chrono logical order, as the following extract shows :

11. PARAMEŚA STOTRĀVALI. It is noticed by Dr. Buhler in his Kashmir Report 

MS. No. 458. 

(III) LAKŞMAŅAGUPTA. On the authority of Abhinava, quoted above, he was both son and pupil of Utpaladeva. We have already shown that he was our great writer's teacher in both the Darśanas, the Pratyabhijñā and the Krama. His period of literary activity must have extended over the close of the second and practically the whole of the third quarter of the 10th century A. D. It is indeed very strange that no work of his has so far been discovered ; nor any quotation from or reference to his works even in the writtings of Abhinava has so far been found. The only passage where there seems to be a reference to his writing is to be met with in one of the concluding verses of Abhinava's Brhati Vimarsinīl. In this he is spoken of as "Srisastrakrt". \.We have got no information about the nature of the contents of this book. 

DUALIST SAIVA WRITERS. Here it will not be out of place to speak a little on the literary activity of the Saiva dualists, particularly because Abhinava himself frequently refers to them. These writers we divide into two periods, viz., pre-Abhinavagupta and post-Abhinavagupta. And because we are mentioning them only by the way to show the relation of other Saiva schools with the one under discussion, we shall, therefore, finish 

1. B.V. (conclusion) 

102 

CHAPTER III 

with the writers of both the periods right here, without postponing the treatment of the post-Abhinava dualists till we come to the next chapter as in the case of the monists. 

AMALGAMATION OF THE DVAITA AND THE 

DVAITĀDVAITA SCHOOLS. It appears that while the monistic Saiva School was doing its work, as described above, the dualistic school was not idle. The probability is that the latter began its work earlier. For, Kșemarāja, as has already been pointed out, speaks of even the admittedly monistic Tantras, as for instance, the Svacchanda, having been interpreted in the dualistic light: and Abhinavagupta also quotes some dualist writers giving their names. 

Our work at present is confined to the monistic school. We have not made enough search for the material to build up the history of the dualistic school. It is, therefore, not possible for us to say when and how this school came to Kashmir, who were its earliest writers and what were the circumstances responsible for its rise. We can, however, definitely state that long before Abhinava's time the two Saiva Schools, namely, the Dvaita and the Dvaitādvaita, had amalgamated and as such had one common name «Siddhānta". Pauşkara Samhitā, for instance, calls the group of twenty-eight Agamas, consisting of ten Dvaita and eighteen Dvaitādvaita āgamas, as stated before, by the name of "Siddhanta". Abhinava also uses this very word to refer to the teachings of these twenty-eight Agamas as a whole”, and his commentators refer to the writers of this school as the followers of the SiddhāntaSaiddhāntikas).

HISTORICAL BACKGROUND OF HIS THOUGHT 

103 

THE POSITION OF THIS SCHOOL IN 

ABHINAVA'S TIME. 

In the time of Abhinava the position of this school was already well established. It had produced great writers like Sadyojyoti, Brhaspati and Sankaranandana. The leaders of this school had written learned commentaries on the Tantras, not only of the admittedly dualistic school but also on those which were known to belong to the monistic school such as the Svacchanda. They had also written such popular works as the Bhoga Kārikā and the Siva Tanu Sastra, which presented the fundamental principles of the school in a very simple and appealing language. In the eyes of Abhinava, however, this school was to be shunned ; because it was dominated by ritualism, the observance of which meant much trouble but little religious merit in return; because it could not show the right way to final emancipation and because its principles were not at all in harmony with common experience. It was to demolish the theories of this school that he wrote such works as the Bhedavāda Vidārana. In the Tantrāloka, in which he has dealt with almost all the points connected with his monistic school, he has drawn attention to the points of difference between the Siddhānta school and the Trika and has tried his best to refute the theories of the former. This is not the place to illustrate these differences. We, therefore, content ourselves with quoting the following verse of. Jayaratha in support of our view : 

"Sankaranandana-Sadyojyoti-Devabala-Kaņabhugādimatam Pratyākhyāsyan navamam vyācakhyāvāhnikaṁ Jayarathah." 

T. A., Comm., VI, 250. 

1. T. A., Ah. 37. (MS.) 

104 

CHAPTER III 

LAKULIĆA PĀŚUPATA. 

The Siddhānta school, referred to in the preceding paragraph, is not to be confused with another Tantrika Saiva school, known as Lakulīša Pasupata. The latter follows only the eighteen Tantras of the Dvaitādvaita school, and not the twenty-eight Tantras, as interpreted in the light of the dualistic teaching. According to Abhinava, while the Siddhānta school is simply to be shunned, the Pasupata school occupies a position next only to his own monistic school as a sure guide on the way to final emancipation. The superiority of the latter lies only in the fact that it is a sure means of realisation of the worldly desires also.1 

ITS WRITERS AND THEIR WORKS. 

(I) SADYOJYOTI SIVA. He was a dualist Saiva and was spoken of as Siddhaguru. He was also called Khetapāla. As regards his time, we can authoritatively say only this much that he was Abhinava's predecessor. About the place of his birth we have no evidence at present to say any thing at all. His teacher was Ugrajyoti8. 

HIS WORKS. 1. BHOGA KARIKA. It deals with Bhoga in accordance with the teaching of the Raurava Tantra. There is a quotation from this in T. A., Comm., VI, 132. 

2. MOKŞA KARIKĀ. 3. PARAMOKŞA NIRĀSA KĀRIKĀ.

105 

4. TATTVA TRAYA NIRŅAYA. 

5. RAURAVA TANTRA VÆTTI. He considered this Vrtti to be so important a work of his that he refers to himself as “Vrttikrt" (the writer of the Vrtti.) To us it is known only from references to it by his commentator, Aghora Sivācārya. 

6. TATTVA SANGRAHA. 

(II) BRHASPATI. He appears to have been accepted to be as great an authority as Sadyojyoti himself, not only from the frequent references to him in the writings of Abhinava (consult Ap pendix B) but also from the fact that he is quoted as an authority by the post-Abhinava dualist Saiva writers such as Aghora Sivācārya and Bhatta Rāma Kantha. The latter in the introduction to his commentary on Sadyojyoti's Moksa Kārikā, couples the name of Brhaspati with that of Sadyojyoti as follows: 

“Yabhyām prakāśitam vartma siddhānte siddhabhāvatah 

Gurūņām api tau vandyau Sadyojyoti-Brhaspati." 

1. SIVA TANU SĀSTRA. 

This is the only known work of this writer. The only source of our information about it, is Abhinava's reference to it in the following quotation : 

"Iti nirvacanaih Sivatanuśāstre gurubhih smrto devah." 

T. A., I, 146. 

Jayaratha, commenting on this, says: 

"Gurubhih iti Brhaspatipādaih."

106 

CHAPTER III 

(III) SANKARANANDANA. 

He also was one of the dualist Saiva writers whose views Jayaratha controverts, as he himself says in the concluding line of his commentary on the Tantrāloka Āhnika IX. Abhinava also refers to him in his Pratyabhijñā Vimarsini, I, 181. 

1. PRAJNĀLANKĀRA. 

This is the only known work of Sankaranandana. Our source of information about it, is Abhinava's reference to it in I. P. V., I, 181. From the nature of the context in which the reference occurs, it seems to have been written with the object of exploding the atomic theory of the Naiyāyikas. 

(IV) VIDYĀPATI. 

Two works of his 

1. ANUBHAVA STOTRA T. S., 31. 2. MÂNA STOTRA T. A., Ah. XIV, 9. 

are known from Abhinava's references to them, as shown above. He is quoted in Bhatta Rāma Kantha's commentary on the Moksa Kārikā, P. 21. The evidence in hand is not conclusive to show whether he was a dualist or not. But it is very probable that he was. We have, therefore, given him a place here. 

(V) DEVABALA, 

Him we know as a dualist writer only from a reference to him made by Jayaratha in T. A., Comm., VI, 250. 

SAIVA DUALISTS OF THE POST-ABHINAVA PERIOD. 

For reasons already stated we briefly deal with the Saiva dualists of even the post-Abhinava period right here.HISTORICAL BACKGROUND OF HIS THOUGHT 

107 

(I) KING BHOJADEVA. Mr. Smith in his Early History of India speaks of two Bhojas (1) Mihira, son of Rāmabhadra, usually known by his title Bhoja (840—90 A. D.) and (II) Bhojadeva of Dhārā (1018-60 A. D.) Of these only the latter is known to have been a patron of learning and a great writer. He is quoted by Madhava in the Sarva Darśana Sangraha, in his summary of the Saiva Darsana, and by Vidyāranya Yatīndra (Mādhava himself so called when he became a Sanyāsin ?) in his commentary on the Suta Samhita. He is referred to by Aghora Sivācārya (1158 A. D.) in his Paddhati and is represented to have been a pupil of Uttunga Sivācārya or his brother. He is, therefore, probably identical with Bhojadeva of Dhārā. His known Saivaite work is 1. Tattva Prakāśikā. 

(II) RĀMA KANȚHA. 

HIS IDENTITY. The author, with whom we are dealing here, was different from his namesake, the son of Bhatta Nārāyana Kantha and the author of the Nada Kārikā. The former was the grand teacher of Nārāyaṇa Kantha, the father of the latter. This is evident from an introductory verse in the Mrgendra Vrtti of Bhatta Nārāyana Kantha which gives the names of the successive teachers as follows: 

1. Rāma Kantha. 1 2. Vidyā Kantha. 3. Nārāyaṇa Kantha.2 

HIS DATE. Aghora Sivācārya, the author of the Dīpikā on the Mrgendra Vrtti of Nārāyana Kantha, according to his own 

1. T. P., Introd., 4. 2. Mr. T., 456. 

108 

CHAPTER III 

statement in his Paddhati, quoted by Srīkrsna Sastri in his introduction to Aşta Prakarana, finished his Paddhati in the Sāka year 1080 i. e. 1158 A. D. For, according to the orthodox view the sāka era began 78 years after the commencement of the Christian era. He speaks of Rama kantha as one of his teachers. We have already shown that Rāma Kantha, the author of the Nāda Kārikā on which Aghora Siva commented, was a different person from the grand teacher of Nārāyana Kantha of the same name and that the author of the Nada Kārikā was the son of Nārāyaṇa Kantha. In the list below the names of the teachers are given in their order of succession with the probable time of their literary activities : 

1. Rāma Kantha I 

1025-1050. 2. Vidyā Kantha.

(IV) NĀRĀYAŅA KANTHA. 

HIS IDENTITY. 

Bhatta Nārāyana Kantha is a different person from Bhatta Nārāyaṇa, the author of the Staya Cintāmani, whom Abhinava quotes in the Parātrimśikā Vivarana, page 69. The former, according to his own statement in the concluding line of his commentary on the Mrgendra Tantra, was the grandson of Sankara and the son of Vidyākantha, but the latter, according to the statement of Kșemarāja in his commentary on Bhatta Nārāyaṇa's Stava Cintāmaņi, was the grandson of Parameśvara and the son of Aparajital. He was the grand teacher of Aghora Siva. His works, therefore, must have been written in the last quarter of the 11th century A. D. 

His WORKS. 

1. MRGENDRA VRTTI. 

It is a commentary on the Mrgendra Tantra. 

2. SARANNIŚĀ 

or 

BRHATTĪKĀ 

This we know only from a reference to it by Aghora Siva in the introduction to his commentary on the Tattva Sangraha of Sadyojyoti. 

(V) RĀMA KAŅTHA (II) He was the teacher of Aghora Siva and the son of Nārāyaṇa Kantha. We can, therefore, safely say that he wrote in the first quarter of the 12th century A. D.

CHAPTER III 

HIS WORKS. 

In the colophons of all his works he speaks of himself as the son of Bhatta Nārāyana Kantha. There is, therefore, no room for any difference of opinion on his authorship of the following works, because the question as to whether a particular work was written by one Rāma Kantha or the other, cannot arise : 

1. NĀDA KĀRIKĀ. 2. VRTTI ON PARAMOKŞA NIRĀSA KĀRIKĀ. 3. VRTTI ON MOKŞA KARIKĀ. 

Works known from reference only : 

4. MANTRA VĀRTIKA TIKĀ. 

M. K., P. 4. 5. AGAMA VIVEKA. 

P. M. N. K., P. 49. 

In the concluding verse of the Nāda Kārikā there is a statement that Rāma Kantha II belonged to Kashmir. It is, therefore, probable that all the other writers also of the post-Abhinava period of whom we have spoken above, excepting, of course, Bhojadeva, belonged to the same place. The fact that 'Kantha" is a common family name in Kashmir even to day lends additional support to this probability. 

6. AGHORA SIVA (1130-58 A. D.) 

We have discussed his date above. He was an inhabitant of Kundina Kula in Cola?. His teacher was Sarvātma Siva. In the colophon to his commentary on the Tattva Prakāśikā he represents himself to be a teacher of two lacs of pupils.

HIS WORKS. 

He commented on the following works :

He wrote the following independent works, but we know them only from his own reference to them in the concluding lines of his commentary on the Ratna Traya in which he calls himself a Kavīśvara 1 : 

8. ĀŚCARYA SÄRA. 9. PĀKHANDĀPAJAPA. 10. BHAKTA PRAKĀŠA. 11. ABHYUDAYA NĀȚAKA. 

IDENTITY OF THE SIDDHĀNTA SCHOOL 

with THE SAIVA DARŠANA OF MĀDHAVA. 

Leaving aside the similarity of the philosophical con ceptions with which we shall, space permitting, deal in the second part, if we were to compare the authorities of the Siddhānta School, about whom we have spoken in the last few pages, with those quoted by Mādhava in the summary of the Saiva Darśana in his Sarva Darśana Sangraha, we shall have very little doubt left in our minds about the identity of the Sidhānta School with the Saiva School of Madhava's S. D. S. The former follows 

1. 

R. Tr. 108. 

112 

CHAPTER III 

the mixed authority of twenty-eight Tantras, ten of the Saiva group and eighteen of the Rudra group. The latter also does the same. It quotes as authorities the Mrgendra Tantra of the first and the Saurabheya and the Kiraņa Tantras of the second group. We may point out here that the Mrgendra is a part of the Kāmika Tantra. As regards human authorities, with the exception of only two (I) Bahudaivatya and (II) Soma Sambhu, which have not so far been accessible to us, all are out of those which have been given above. The following are the names of the authors and books quoted as authorities by Madhava, which are common to the Siddhānta School, described above: 

1. TATTYA SANGRAHA. 2. TATTVA PRAKĀŠA. 3. BHOJARĀJA. 4. SIDDHA GURU. 5. BRHASPATI. 6. RĀMA KAŅȚHA. 

To show the identity of the two was one of the reasons for our dealing here with the writers of the Siddhānta School of the post-Abhinava period. It is interesting to note that Mādhava himself uses the word "Siddhānta" when he speaks of the followers of this school as distinguished from those of the other Saivāgamic Schools?.

THE WRITERS ON DRAMATURGY KNOWN TO ABHINAVA AND THEIR HISTORICAL POSITION. 

Bharata is admitted by all to be the first known writer on Sanskrit Dramaturgy whose work is available. On his 

1. 

S. D. S. 

HISTORICAL BACKGROUND OF HIS THOUGHT 

113 

Sutras Abhinava has commented. We can, therefore, give a clear idea of Abhinava's contribution to Sanskrit dramaturgy only if we trace its history from the time of the writer of the original to that of the commentator. But the limited space at our disposal in the present thesis does not permit us to undertake it. We shall, therefore, content ourselves with showing what light a careful study of Abhinava's works throws on some of the important problems. 

INTERPOLATION IN BHARATA'S NÄTYA SĀSTRA. 

The question of Bharata's Nātya Sāstra being a work of many hands is very old. In fact, as we have already pointed out, even before the time of Abhinava, there were some who considered at least those portions, in which Bharata is spoken of as a third person, to have been from the pen of some of his pupils. How in Abhinava's opinion such a view was wrong we have already shown. In recent times two places in the published text of the Natya Sāstra have been pointed out as indicative of its later rehandling and recasting, One is the colophon at the end in the Kāvyamālā edition : 

"Samāptaścāyam (granthah) Nandi-Bharatasangītapusta kam" 

and the other is a sort of prediction, contained in the last chapter, that the rest of the topics will be treated in detail by Kohala. In addition to this a work on music called "Nandi Bharata" noticed by Rice in his Mysore and Coorg Catalogue and a chapter referred to as “Nandi Bharatokta sankara hastādhyāya" from a "work on the art of dancing accompanied by the different kinds of movements of the hand etc.” noticed in the Madras Catalogue are mentioned ; and it is stated "these works, probably late compilations, refer to Nandi or Nandikeśvara, whom tradition acknowledges as an ancient authority on music and histrionic art." It is 

15 

114 

CHAPTER III 

further added “This designation of the later part of Bharata's text, a part of which deals, among other things, with music, probably implies that it was compiled and recast at some later period in accordance with the views of Nandikeśvara." Similarly the prediction about the continuation of Bharata's work referred to above has been supposed to indicate that the rewriting of the portion in question was done some time after Kohala as well as Nandikeśvara had spoken on the subject." (H. S. P., P. 24-5) 

tamen 

It is apparent from what has been stated above that the theory of the later interpolation is based upon the supposition of the later chronological position of Nandi and Kohala due to the ignorance of the relation of these two accepted authorities to Bharata, so that unless we are able to fix the exact chronological position of these two persons we cannot either accept or reject the theory. Let us, therefore, see what light the text of the Natya Sastra itself and the commentary of Abhinava thereon throw on this point. 

Bharata is very frank in stating that all the information that he gives on gesticulation was got from Tandu : 

*Tato ye Tandunā proktās tvangahārā mahātmanā. Nānākaranasamyuktān vyākhyāsyāmi sarecakān." 

Bh. Sū., Ch. IV, 18-9. On this there is a very important comment of Abhi. navagupta, which explains the identity of Tandu. According to this, Tandu is another name of Nandi as Muni 

is that of Bharata : 

"Tandu-Munisabdau Nandi-Bharatayoh aparanāmanī." 

A. Bh., 90. Thus it is clear that Nandi was Bharata's contemporary, perhaps older, or a predecessor, but not his distant successor. If we accept the identity of Nandi with Bharata's teacher 

HISTORICAL BACKGROUND OF HIS THOUGHT 

115 

or collaborator, Tandu, there remains no difficulty in explaining the colophon at the end of the last chapter of the Bharata Sūtra in the Kāvyamālā edition, “Nandibharata". It may mean Bharata instructed by Nandi. 

(Nandyupadişto Bharataḥ-Nandi Bharatah; 

“Sākapārthivādinām siddhaye uttarapadalopasyopa sankhyānam.') Similarly the colophon of the MS. No. 13009 noticed in the Madras Catalogue, referred to above, can also be easily explained. 

KOHALA. That he is an ancient authority on dramaturgy, nobody doubts. That he wrote some works on that subject is made abundantly clear by Abhinava (consult A. Bh., PP. 25, 48, 173, 182, 266, 272) Many other later writers also frequently refer to him and quote from his works. That he had established his reputation as an authority on dramaturgy so as to be referred to by Bharata himself is also made clear by Abhinava in A. Bh. For, according to his statement on page 266, the 10th verse of the 6th chapter of the Natya Sāstra contains the opinion of Kohala and not that of Bharata on the question of the number of the essential constituents of Nātya, because the Nātya Sāstra states the views of Kohala also on some important points. Further, at some places, according to Abhinava's interpreta tion, Bharata rejects the view of Kohala, as for instance, in regard to the nature of Suşira, as the following comment on Bharata's verse "Suşiro varsa eva ca" clearly shows : 

«Evakārah Kohalādivyudāsāya" . How can the acceptance of some views of Kohala and rejection of others by Bharata be possible but for their contemporaneity ? 

116 

CHAPTER III 

The question is only about his exact position in relation to Bharata, and on this also Abhinava, though indirectly and incidentally, has spoken in terms not easily to be mistaken. Bharata, while speaking on Nândi in Ch. I., S. 56, uses the word "vicitrā" and Abhinava, commenting on this word, says : 

"Ata eva vicitretyuktam.. 

Ityeșāpi bhāratīyatvena prasiddhā Kohalapradarsite nāndyupapannā bhavati." 

A. Bh., 25. Here the word "Bhāratīya" is of very great importance in giving us a clue to the relation, we are trying to find out. This word means "propounded by the son of Bharata". It cannot mean "of Bharata" because according to Pāņini's rule “Vrddhācchah" (Pa. 4-2-14.) the affix "Cha" which changes into "iya", cannot be added to a word with a short initial syllable. 

“Vrddhiryasyācāmādis tad vrddham." Therefore, the initial has to be prolonged before this affix can rightly be added. But how can it be done unless at first the affix "An" expressive of the sense of "offspring" (apatya) ("Tasyāpatyam". Pā. 4-1-92.) be affixed to the word "Bharata"? “Bhāratīya" therfore, literally means of the son of Bharata." The meaning of the word having been settled the next quesion that naturally arises is "who was this son of Bharata". To this also Abhinava gives a reply in the same line by saying "Kohalapradarsitā". Thus it is evident that Kohala was Bharata's son, at least this is Abhinava's view. It may be interesting to note in this connection that Kohala is included in the list of the hundred sons of Bharata enumerated in Bh. Sū., Ch. I, s. 26-39. 

It may be pointed out here that the word "Bharatiya", on the interpretation of which our conclusion on the exactHISTORICAL BACKGROUND OF HIS THOUGHT 

117 

relation of Kohala to Bharata is based, occurs also in the colophon of each chapter of the Natya Sāstra : 

"Iti Bhāratīye Nātya Sastre" But there the word has a quite different meaning from that in which it is used in the passage under discussion. For, if we take it to mean the same there as here, against all traditions and authorities we will have to accept Kohala to be the author of the Nātya Sāstra. The question, therefore, naturally arises : in what sense is the word used in the colophons ? 

The following three interpretations suggest themselves to us, but, we confess, none satisfactorily explains the long "a" in the initial syllable : 

(I) "Handed down by Bharata." This meaning we get by affixing "cha" to the word "Bharata" ("Tena proktam” 4-3-101) after affixing "an" in svārtha ("Prajñā dibhyasca" 5-4-38). 

(II) "Concerning the pupils of Bharata, that is the actors in general." The word yields this sense if we take it to have been formed from the word "Bharata" according to Pāņini's Sūtra "Adhikrtya křte granthe" (4-3-87) after affixing "an" in the sense of pupil by "Kanvādibhyo gotre". (4-2-111). 

(III) “Beneficial to the actors." To get this meaning we have to form "Bhārata" as in the preceding case, and then affix "cha" in the sense of "beneficial" by "Tasmai hitam" (5-1-5). This interpretation seems to have the support of Abhinava as the following quotation shows : 

"Natajanasvakapravrttivišeşopadeśaparam, ata eva tadgatasiddhasadupāyopadeśanaparam idam śāstram 

118 

CHAPTER III 

iti natasya tāvannānena kiñcidupadiśyate tam pratyu pakārād rte" 

A. Bh., 4. The extracts discussed above can very easily be interpreted by the exponents of the later interpolation theory as supporting their own position. But this is possible only on the presumption of the later date of Kohala, which has yet to be proved to be based upon sound literary evidence. We have, at least, the support of such a great authority as Abhinavagupta for the view maintained here. 

Now, taking Abhinava's testimony in this matter to be correct, let us see how this explains the prediction referred to above. It is evident that Bharata wrote his Natya Sastra when he was very old, because he is spoken of as a Muni. Therefore, it will not be wrong to suppose that at the time when the sage was writing the above work, his son, or younger contemporary, Kohala, was already of sufficiently advanced age and held certain views on some dramaturgic points, which, though different from those of Bharata, were not to be ignored. The latter, therefore, at some places purposely uses expressions, as Abhinava interprets, to indicate the acceptability of Kohala's views, as in the instance discussed above. Taking all these facts into consideration it seems very probable that by the time the present Bharata Sutra reached its completion the sage had grown too old and feeble to continue writing on the remaining points of dramaturgy which were of equal importance with those already treated. By this time Kohala also had established his reputation as an authority on dramaturgy and had become quite able to continue the work. Bharata, therefore, entrusted the future work on the subject to his worthy son or contemporary and closed his work with the so-called prediction, on which the present controversy is partly based. Thus the two grounds on which the conclusion 

1. Bh. Su. ch. 37, s. 18. 

HISTORICAL BACKGROUND OF HIS THOUGHT 

119 

of later interpolation and recasting is based do not appear to be sound. The third is simply a tradition that the original work of Bharata was in the Sūtra form. It is, therefore, unnecessary to discuss it here. 

BHARATA'S DATE. Both his style and the method of dealing with the subject are apparently Purāņic, and we know that Purānas assumed their final form, roughly speaking, in the fourth century A. D. But, as in the case of Purāṇas so in that of Bharata, whose date we can at present find out only with the help of the style and the language, the upper limit cannot be precisely fixed. The lower limit, however, is not so uncertain. For, we have positive proof of the existence of his Nātya Sāstra in the present form in the 6th century A. D., because there is a Vārtika on it of King Harşa of Kannauj (606-47 A. D.) which is quoted by Abhinava in his commentary on Bharata's Nātya Sāstra with the remark "iti Harșa Vārtikam" (consult PP. 67, 172, 174, 207, 211, 212). Bharata's Nātya Sastra must have, therefore, existed and become of accepted authority long before King Harşa's time to prompt him to write a Vārtika on it. It may be noted that in the case of Bharata's text, on which Harsa wrote his Vārtika, Abhinava does not point out any difference in reading as he does in the case of that (text of Bharata) on which others have commented, as for instance, on page 226 of A. Bh. The intervening period between Bharata and Harşa, therefore, does not seem to have been very long. Nor was it very short, because the necessity for a sort of com mentary, Vārtika, had arisen. It will, therefore, not be wrong to suppose that Bharata lived sometime between the 4th and the 5th century A. D. There is, however, no denying the fact that oral traditions about dramaturgy, which are embodied by Bharata, were current from much earlier time than the 4th century. 

120 

CHAPTER III 

BHARATA'S COMMENTATORS AND WRITERS ON SUBJECTS ALLIED TO DRAMATURGY REFERRED TO BY 

ABHINAVA. 

(I) DATTILĀCĀRYA. From the nature of the context in which he is referred to as well as from a quotation in A. Bh., P. 205, he appears to have been an old authority on Tāla, because he is spoken of as “Ācārya' by Abhinava as also because his name is mentioned in the list of hundred sons of Bharata. (We do not attach more than due importance to the latter argument.) 

(II) RĀHULA. There are two quotations attributed to him in A. Bh., PP. 115, 172. They show that he wrote on dramaturgy in general. For, the former concerns dancing and the latter the way in which a female character should address her loving husband or friend. He acknowledges the authority of Bharata even in one of these quotations. 

(III) BHATTA YANTRA. He seems to have written a commentary on the Bharata Sūtra, because a quotation is given apparently from his commentary to state his opinion on the meaning of the word "evam" which constitutes a part of Bharata's verse 331, ch. IV, as Abhinava clearly states : 

“Etacca svamatānusārena "evam" sabdārthamāhuh." 

A. Bh., 208, (IV) KIRTIDHARĀCĀRYA. He is spoken of as vyākhyātā along with the known commentators of Bharata and his opinon also is quoted on the meaning of the same word "evam" as pointed out above. He also, therefore, seems to have commented upon the Bharata Sūtra. 

1. A. Bh., 172. 

HISTORICAL BACKGROUND OF HIS THOUGHT 

121 

It may be pointed out here that Dr. De, in his History of Sanskrit Poetics, represents this Kīrtidharācārya to have been Abhinava's successor, probably because in the quotation that he gives in the foot note on page 27, H.S.P., Kirtidhara is mentioned after Abhinava. But, in view of the fact that he is quoted by Abhinava himself, as shown above, Dr. De's opinion, we think, requires revision". 

(V) NĀNYADEVA. 

He was the writer of a commentary on the Bharata Sutra, called Bharata Bhāșya. He is quoted by Abhinava in A. Bh., P. 255. 

HIS TIME Nānyadeva is a familiar name to indologists. Four eminent scholars have written on him. Professor Sylvain Lévi was the first to deal with the question of Nānya's date in Le Népāl, Vol. II. According to him, Nānyadeva's accession fell in 1097 A.D. This date, according to Dr. R. C. Majumdar, because it is "confirmed by a memorial verse preserved in Vidyāpati's Puruşaparīkņā and corroborated by a MS. written in 1097 in the reign of king Nānyadeva" (I. H.Q., Vol. VII, P. 680) may be regarded as finally settled. According to Mr. Jayaswal, however, the year of accession was 1093 A. D. and that of death 1133 A. D. 

All these scholars, for some reason or other, allow Nānyadeva a reign of about fifty years. This Nānyadeva, who is supposed to have lived from sometime in the later half of the 11th century to 1133 or 1147 A. D., we would have altogether ignored, but for the article of Mr. Ramakrishna Kavi in the Quarterly Journal of the Andhra Historical Research Society, October, 1926, P. 55-63, in which he 

1. H. S.P., Vol. I, 27. 

16 

122 

CHAPTER III 

gives an account of Nānya's commentary on Bharata's Nāțya Sāstra (Chs. XXVII to XXXIV, dealing with music). 

The available portion of the commentary gives the following details about the identity of the author : 

1. Mahāsāmantādhipati-dharmāvaloka-Śrīmān Nānya 

pati. 2. Mithileśvara. 3. Karņā takulabhūşana. 4. Dharmādhārabhupati 5. Rājanārāyana 6. Nrpamalla. 7. Mohanamurāri. 8. Pratyagravānīpati. 9. Extinguisher of the fame of the king of Mālava. 10. Conqueror of the heroes of Sauvīra. 11. Breaker of the powers of Vanga and Gauda. 

Dr. Majumdar has tried to explain some of the above attributes as referring to Nānyadeva of the 11th and the 12th centuries A. D. According to him naturally, therefore, the commentator of the Natya Sāstra is identical with the king of Mithilā who reigned from 1097 to 1147. 

Our careful study of Abhinava presents the following difficulty in accepting the said identification : 

Abhinavagupta, in his commentary on Bharata's Nātya Sastra, refers to Nanyadeva and quotes from his Bharatabhāşya, a commentary on the Natya Sastra, as follows: 

"Uktam Nānyadevena sva-Bharatabhāșye : - 

*Atra varnaśabdena gitirabhidhiyate nākṣaravišeşah, nāpi sadjā disaptasvarāh padagrāme tvaniyamādeva 

HISTORICAL BACKGROUND OF HIS THOUGHT 

123 

svecchayā prayujyante, sadjadisvarāntānām apya višeşeņa vāvarohādidharmāņam pratyeva samupa lambhate. Ato varņa eva gītirityavasthitam, sopi caturdhā māgadhyādih" 

- A. Bh., 255. But, on the evidence of the dates of composition of three of his important works, (vide ch. I) given by himself, Abhinava is known to have lived from about the middle of the 10th century A. D. to about the close of the first quarter of the 11th century. Further, on the solid ground of the references to the earlier works in the later, his writings are separately assigned to the following three periods : 

1. Tantrika 2. Alankārika 

3. Philosophical The date of completion of the biggest philosophical work of Abhinava, so far known, namely, the Pratyabhijñā Vivrti Vimarsinī, is definitely known to be 1014-15 A. D. The time of writing of the Abhinava Bhāratī, therefore, can safely be stated to be the beginning of the 11th century A. D. Nānyadeva, therefore, in order to explain his being quoted by Abhinava in the beginning of the 11th century A. D., has to be supposed to be an older contemporary, if not a predecessor, of Abhinava. In any case, it has got to be admitted that Nanyadeva finished his commentary on Bharata's Nātya Sastra before the close of the 10th century A. D. He has, therefore, to be supposed to have been thirty to forty years of age at that time. For, it would not be reasonable to suppose that he finished such a work in his teens or early twenties. Under the circumstances, in our opinion, it would not be wrong to say that he was born early in the later half of the 10th century A. D. 

Now, Nānyadeva, king of Mithila, is represented to have ascended the throne in 109 A. D. and to have ruled for 

124 

CHAPTER III 

fifty years. If we accept the conclusions of the scholars, who have specialized in the history of Nanya's time, the following questions will naturally arise : 

1. Did Nānyadeva come to the throne when he was about one hundred and thirty years of age ? 

2. Did he live for about two hundred years and continue ruling till the very end of his life? For, such a supposition alone can explain his reign from 1097 to 1147 A.D. 

3. If not, how then can the identity of the commentator Nānyadeva, quoted by Abhinava in the beginning of the 11th century, with a king of Mithilā of the same name but belonging to the 12th century A. D. be accepted ? 

The other alternative, namely, that Nānyadeva, quoted by Abhinava, is a different person from his namesake, the 12th century king of Mithilā, is no better. For, we have ascertained from Mr. Ramakrishna Kavi that the passage, quoted by Abhinava from Nānya's commentary, given above, is actually found in the seventh chapter, called Rāgādhyāya, of the MS. of Nānya's commentary. The stray remarks, therefore, made by Nānya about himself in the course of his commentary, stated above, make the aforesaid view wholly untenable. 

Two questions arise here. 

1. Is king Nānyadeva, who, according to Dr. Majum dar, played an important part in north Indian politics in the first half of the 12th century A. D., a different person from his namesake king of Mithilā and commentator on Bharata's Nātya Sastra, who is quoted by Abhinava and, therefore, must belong to the 10th and early 11th century A. D. ? 

2. Or, is it that scholars, who have written on Nānya, in attempting to explain the political references to him with 

HISTORICAL BACKGROUND OF HIS THOUGHT 

125 

the available political data of that period, have assigned to him a much later than the real date ? 

It may be suggested here that if Gangādeva, the successor of Nanyadeva, be identical with Gāngeyadeva, as Dr. Majumdar suggests, then the colophon of a book, noticed by Mr. Bendall, which refers to Tirhut being ruled over by "Mahārājādhirāja Punyāvaloka Somavamsodbhava Gauda dhvaja Srimad Gangeyadeva” and is dated Samvat 1076, puts Nānyadeva at a time which satisfactorily explains the fact of his having been quoted by Abhinava early in the 11th century A. D. Of course, in this case we would follow Mr. Bendall, according to whom Sarhvat refers to the Vikrama era, and not Dr. Majumdar who holds it to refer to the Saka era. For, in that case, Nānya shall have to be supposed to have died before 1020 A. D. when, according to the above colophon, his son was on the throne. 

In our opinion the question of Nānya's time requires further study in the light of the facts, stated here, and cannot be regarded as finally settled. 

THE COMMENTATORS WHOSE DATE CAN BE FIXED. 

(VI) HARŞA. Abhinava quotes & commentary, called "Vārtika," written by Harşa, apparently on the Bharata Sūtra, as we have already said. In the history of Sanskrit literature, we know only of two Harşas. One, the famous King of Kannauj (606-47 A. D.) and the other, poet Harșa, the author of the Naişadhīya Carita, who is invariably called Srīharşa. As the latter belonged to the later half of the 12th century A. D., it would not be wrong to identify the author of the Vārtika with the former. It is probable that the work was written by his famous court poet Bāna and attributed to his patron like so many others. 

126 

CHAPTER III 

(VII) UDBHAȚA. The followers of Udbhata (Audbhatas) are represen ted to hold that the 11th verse of the sixth chapter of the Bharata Sutra states that, according to Kohala, Nātya Sangraha consists of eleven parts. Does this mean that he also wrote a commentary on the Bharata Sūtra ? In any case, it is apparent that he interpreted Bharata's text in a way which considerably differed from other interpretations of the same and that these differences, though they may have been simply matters of oral tradition, were so many and had been accepted by so many that those who followed his interpre tation were called Audbhatas. 

HIS DATE. 

There is no controversy about his date. He is taken to be identical with Bhatta Udbhata, whom Kalhana in his Rājatarangini, Ch. IV, 495, represents as the Sabhāpati of King Jayāpīda of Kashmir (779-813 A. D.). He is very well known for his works on Alankāra e. g. Kāvyālankārasāra sangraha. 

(VIII) BHATTA LOLLAȚA. 

That he commented upon the Bharata Sūtra is clear not so much from his opinion on Rasa, quoted by Abhinava, as from the quotation which points out the difference of his interpretation of the word "evam" in Bh. Sū. ch. IV, S. 331, from those of Bhatta Yantra and Kirtidharācārya. 

HIS DATE. 

From the manner in which reference has been made to his theory of Rasa by Abhinava in his A. Bh., p. 274, there remains little doubt about the fact that he was Srīšankuka's older contemporary. Not only is his exposition of Rasa givenHISTORICAL BACKGROUND OF HIS THOUGHT 

127 

first of all but his view also is represented to be in common with that of the ancients (Cirantanas), such as Dandin. Further, Srīšankuka is represented to be his first opponent; and the word (etanna), with which the statement of the opponent's view begins, shows that the latter was Lollata's contemporary. We know that the word "etat" in Sanskrit stands for what is present before ; in fact this is the only difference in idea conveyed by this word as distinguished from “tat". The time of Sankuka is accepted to be the middle of the 9th century A. D., because he is taken to be identical with the poet Sankuka, who, according to Kalhana's statement, (R. T., ch. IV, 705) was King Ajitāpīda's con temporary (circa 850) and had written a poem, called Bhuvanābhyudaya. The view that Lollața was a contem porary of Srīšankuka is supported by the following fact : 

Kșemarāja, who was a pupil of Abhinava, refers in his Spanda Nirnaya to Lollata's commentary, called Vivrti, on Bhatta Kallata's Spanda Kārikā in the following words: 

"Bhatta Lollatenāpi 'tadādyanta' iti evameva vyākhyāyi sva Vivrtau" 

S. N., 34. Bhatta Kallaţa, as already stated before, is referred to as & Siddha and, therefore, must have been a very old man in the time of King Avanti Varman (856 A. D.) He, therefore, must have written his Spanda Kārikā or rather given publicity to Vasugupta's posthumous work so called, as we have explained before, some time in the middle of the second quarter of the 9th century; and Lollața, his younger contemporary, commented upon the same towards the end of the same quarter of that century. It is probable that Lollata also like Kallata was Vasugupta's pupil. The fact that Lollaţa wrote some philosophical works also is further supported by Abhinaya's referring to him as a 

128 

CHAPTER III 

writer of a philosophical work in the Mālini Vijaya Vārtika ch. I, S. 777. 

Thus it is evident that Bhatta Kallața, Bhatta Lollata and Srisankuka were contemporaries and that the first was the oldest and the last the youngest of them. It will, there fore, not be wrong to say that Bhatta Lollata lived in the second and the third quarters of the 9th century A. D. 

(IX) SRIŠANKUKA. From frequent references to and criticism of Srisankuka's interpretation of the Bharata Sūtra by Abhinava in his commentary (pp. 67, 75, 104) as also from the fact that he points out differences between his original of the Bharata Sūtra and that of Srisankuka, (A. Bh. 216, 217) it is apparent that the latter also commented upon the Bharata Sūtra. That he belonged to Kashmir and was a contem porary of King Ajitāpīda (850) we have already stated in the foregoing pages. 

(X) BHAȚȚA NĀYAKA. Did he comment on Bharata's Nātya Sastra ? Dr. De answers this question in the following words in his History of Sanskrit Poetics : 

“No doubt, Abhinava in his own commentary on Bharata, as well as numerous other later writers taking their cue from Abhinava, criticise at some length Bhatta Nāyaka's theory of Rasa, along with those of Lollata and Sankuka, and with special reference to Bharata's particular Sūtra on the subject : yet Bhatta Nayaka is nowhere mentioned directly as a commentator on the same text." 

The following few lines contain our opinion on the subject with the available data on which it is based : 

Abhinava in his commentary on the very first verse of Bharata, while discussing the meaning of the last part of 

HISTORICAL BACKGROUND OF HIS THOUGHT 

129 

the same "Brahmaņā yadudāhrtam" quotes the following passage from the Sahradaya Darpana - 

"(Bhatta Nāyakastu) Brahmaņā paramātmanā yadu dāhrtam avidyāviracitam nissārabhedagrahe yadu dāharanīkrtam tannātyam tad vakşyāmi: yathā hi kalpanāmātrasāram tata evānavasthitaikarūpam kşaņena kalpanāśata..... ............. lokottaraparama puruşārthasūcanena śāntarasopakşepoyam bhavisyati : "svam svam nimittam ādāya śāntādyutpadyate rasah" iti tadanena pāramārthikam prayojanam uktam (iti vyākhyām sahrdayadarpane paryagrahīt)". 

The portions within brackets, at the beginning and in the end are Abhinava's own remarks. This makes the following three points clear : 

(1) Bhatta Nāyaka wrote a work called Sahrdaya 

Darpana. (2) That work dealt with the text of Bharata's Nātya 

Šāstra. (3) At many places it interpreted the Bharata Sūtra in 

a way which differed from that of the other commentators. 

EXPLANATION OF THE REMARK OF MAHIMA BHATTA'S 

COMMENTATOR. 

Here one question may very pertinently be asked. If Sahrdaya Darpana is Bhatta Nāyaka's commentary on the Bharata Sūtra what about the remark of “Mahima Bhatta's commentator”, who in the words of Dr. De "tells us that this Hrdaya Darpana, like the Vyakti Viveka, was composed with the special object of demolishing the Dhvani theory, formulated by Ananda Vardhana". The answer is simple and we propose to give it by putting 

17 

130 

CHAPTER III 

another question "Is there any difference between “Hrdaya" and “Sahrdaya"? If the reply be "Yes" we would request the reader to see if there is not the same difference between the titles of the works referred to by Abhinava and Mahima Bhatta's commentator in their respective commentaries. One is Hrdaya Darpaņa and the other is Sahrdaya Darpaņa. The former is concerned with the demolition of the Dhvani theory of Ananda Vardhana and the latter with the interpretation of Bharata's text. This conclusion is based upon the wording of the text, quoted above in full, and the quotation : 

“Darpanah.............. .Hrdayadarpaņākhyo dhvani 

dhvamsa granthah." given by Dr. De in his H. S.P., in a foot note on page 40. 

HIS DATE. 

From what has been stated above it is clear that he lived some time after Ananda Vardhana, a contemporary of King Avanti Varman, 856-883, (R. T., ch. V, 34,) and a little before Abhinava (second half of the 10th and the beginning of the 11th century A. D.). Therefore, probably it will not be wrong to identify him with Nayaka whom Kalhaņa represents as King Sankara Varman's contemporary, 883-902 A. D., (R. T., ch. V, S. 159). 

EXPONENTS AND OPPONENTS OF THE THEORY 

OF DHVANI. 

The men of letters, of whom we have to speak here, can, according to Ananda Vardhana, the first known exponent of the theory of Dhvani, be divided into three classes : (I) the supporters of the theory; (II) its opponents; and (III) those who considered it to be identical with 

HISTORICAL BACKGROUND OF HIS THOUGHT 

131 

Lakşaņā. Among those of the first class are included also those, who believed that there was something like Dhvani, though they could not properly define it. Before the writer of the Dhvani Kārikā, there was no book presenting the views of either the exponents or the opponents. This, however, does not mean that the earlier thinkers of Sanskrit poetics had no idea of Dhvani. The fact, on the contrary, is that the theory was well formulated and had its opponents too, long before the time of the Kārikā, but all that was simply a matter of oral tradition handed down from generation to generation. The thinkers of the third school, in marked contrast with the above two, more or less, recorded their views in the books, which we still possess. To this class belong such early writers on poetics as Bhatta Udbhata, and Vāmana.* The view of the school of opponents also had begun to be systematised before Ananda Vardhana wrote his work, as is apparent from a quotation attributed to a poet, Manoratha, who, according to Abhinava, was Ananda Vardhana's contemporary.5 But it appears from Abhinava's wording that only stray verses were written by one writer here and another there, and that there was no book presenting the opponents' views systematically, for, he seems to have purposely used the word "Sloka". It was only after Ananda Vardhana's learned exposition of Dhvani in his Dhvanyāloka, that there appeared two books of the opponents' school, one from the pen of Bhatta Nāyaka, whom Abhinava so much criticises, and the other from that of Mahima Bhatta, who was probably Abhinava's successor or younger contemporary.

CHAPTER III 

WHO WAS THE AUTHOR OF THE DHVANI KĀRIKĀ ? 

But before we begin speaking on these writers in their chronological order, let us take up the much disputed question of the authorship of the Dhvani Kārikā, and see what light a careful study of Abhinava's Locana throws on it. There is no doubt, as was first pointed out by Dr. Bühler, that Abhinava uses the two words "Kārikākāra" and "Vrttikāra." with a distinction. There is also no doubt that Abhinava means two different works by "Vrttigrantha" and "Karikā". But let us state here that he does not oppose them, if by the word "oppose" the idea meant to be conveyed is that one contradicts the view of the other. But we have complete agreement if it is meant to denote that the contents of the works, referred to by the words “Kārikā" and "Vrtti" which form component parts of "Karikākāra" and "Vrttikāra," differ in certain respects, i. e. certain points are dealt with in greater detail in the latter than in the former and certain others are given exhaustive treatment in the latter, which, though very closely connected with the subject matter of the former, have not very clearly been touched upon in it. That there is nothing like contradiction between the two is made clear by those very three instances which are stated in the History of Sanskrit Poetics (P. 107-8) and on two of which the learned author himself speaks a little later in the following words : 

“In one place, for instance (P. 123) Abhinavagupta clearly points out that the classification of Dhvani according to Vastu, Alankāra, and Rasādi is not expressedly taught in any Kārikā; while at another place in ch. IV Abhina vagupta states that the question as to the source of the endless variety of Artha in poetry is mentioned by the Vrttikāra but not touched upon by the Kārikākāra." 

But we do not agree with Dr. Jacobi and Dr. De who, "relying on Abhinavagupta's testimony put forward the 

HISTORICAL BACKGROUND OF HIS THOUGHT 

133 

suggestion that Dhvanikāra, the supposed author of the Kārikā, was a different and older writer, who should be distinguished from Ananda Vardhana, the author of the Vrtti." The arguments of the scholars who hold that the Kārika and the Vrtti are of different authorship may be briefly stated as follows : 

1. There is difference in respect of the points dealt 

with in the Kārikā and the Vrtti. 2. The ideas of the Kārikā are expanded, revised and 

modified in the Vrtti. 3. A sufficiently long time must elapse before the 

need for a commentary is felt. 4. Abhinavagupta uses the two words "Kārikākāra" 

and "Vrttikāra" and means two distinct authors thereby. 

We have already stated in the preceding paragraph that whatever be the number of the points dealt with in the Vrtti, in addition to those expressedly stated in the Kārikā, none of the former contradicts any one of the latter ; and here we might add that though there is considerable expansion, revision and modification of the views of the Kārikā in the Vrtti, yet all that is of the nature of an addition to clear the ideas of the former, for, that is the one purpose that the commentary is intended to serve. 

Having thus disposed of the first two points stated above, we take up the third. It is not always that 

commentary is written only after the lapse of a sufficiently long time. It may have been so, long before or after the time of Ananda Vardhana, but was not certainly so in or about his time, as the history of Sanskrit Literature, particularly of that part of India to which Ananda Vardhana himself belonged, shows. We know on the accepted 

134 

CHAPTER III 

authority of Kalhana on this particular point that Ananda Vardhana was King Avanti Varman's contemporary (856-883 A. D.) and that Kallața also lived at the same time. We also know that Vasugupta, the author of the Siva Sūtra, was a teacher of Kallata and that the latter wrote a commentary on the Spanda Kārikā called "Spanda Sarvasva". Although there is difference of opinion as regards the authorship of the Spanda Kārikā which, in itself is a sort of running commentary on the Siva Sūtra, yet, whether the authorship of the Spanda Kārikā be attributed to Vasugupta or to Kallaţa, our position is not affected. What we intend to show here is that in or about the 9th century A. D. in Kashmir there are instances of the same person, writing both the text and the commentary. So that if we take Vasugupta to be the author of the Spanda Kārikā, then, it is his own commentary on his own Siva Sūtra ; but if Kallaţa be accepted to be the author, then, he also has written a commentary on it, called Spanda Sarvasva, as pointed out above. This is not a solitary instance; about the same time Somānanda also is said to have written a commentary upon his own Sivadrști, though we have not so far been able to discover it; and, in the next generation Utpalācārya wrote the Vrtti and the Vivrti on his own Iśvara Pratyabhijñā Kārikā to which Abhinava makes a reference in one of the introductory verses in his Pratyabhijñā. Vimarsinī. Thus the third argument also does not appear to be very sound. 

As regards the fourth argument that Abhinava uses two words, Kārikākāra and Vrttikāra, and means to imply distinction, we may point out that this also does not necessarily mean difference in point of the authorship of the works so referred to. Our study of Abhinava's works tells 

1. I. P. V., 1, 3. 

HISTORICAL BACKGROUND OF HIS THOUGHT 

135 

us that it is his practice to refer to the same person as the writer of one work or another, if he has written more than one work, according as he refers to him in one capacity or another. Leaving aside other instances, if we take up that of Utpalācārya himself, we find that he is referred to both as Vrttikāra and Tīkākāra in one passage. On reading it, a person, not knowing the truth, is likely to fall into the error of thinking that there are two different writers referred to by these two words. The passage in question occurs in Abhinava's commentary, called Vimarsins, on the first verse of Utpalācārya's Iśvara Pratyabhijña Kārikā or Satra. It runs as follows: 

"Iyati vyākhyāne vrttikrtā bharo na krtah tātparya 

vyākhyānāt yaduktam : 

Samvrtasautranirdeśavivrtimātravyāpārāyām' iti: Țīkākāremāpi vrttimātram vyākhyātumudyatena nedam sprstam." 

I. P. V., I, 22-3. We have stated above that Utpalācārya himself was the writer of both the Vrtti and the Țīkā and have also given a quotation in support of our statement. 

Here it may be asked "Is there any justification to suppose that the use of the two words "Kārikākāra" and "Vrttikāra" by Abhinava in his Locana is of the same kind as that of Vrttikāra and Tīkākāra in the Pratyabhijñā Vimarsins ?" To answer this question we state the following few facts, gathered from the three works, the Kārikā, the Vrtti and the Locana : 

I. As a rule, Sanskrit writers do not begin their work without first writing at least one verse in praise of the deity to which they are devoted or using some such expression in the beginning as is interpreted to be what is technically called Margalācaraņa. If, therefore, the Dhvani Kārikā and the Vrtti had been written by two different writers there would 

136 

CHAPTER III 

have been two separate benedictory verses, at least one at the beginning of each. But there is only one such verse in the present case and this seems to form the beginning of the Dhvani Kārikā. What are we to infer from this ? 

II. When we read the Vrtti we find at the conclusion of the introductions to some Kārikās here and there the word “ucyate" and we feel that if we could know the subject of the passive form we shall have some light thrown on the question of authorship. Abhinava, as if knowing the mind of the future generations, has cleared this point. Comment ing on "iyat punarucyate eva" which comes as a sort of introduction to the 28th verse of the Second Chapter of the Dhvani Kārikā, he says "asmābhiriti vākya seşah". Does not this mean that Abhinava considered the writer of the introductory words, given above, to be the same as that of the verse that comes after ? 

III. There is another statement in the Locana at the beginning of the second chapter wherein also Abhinava similarly states the understood subject of a passive form of verb. 

(Vrtti) "Dhvanir dviprakārah prakāsitah." 

(Locana) "Prakāśita iti, mayā vrttikāreņa sateti bhāvah." Does not the use of the word "satā" imply that the writer of the Vitti is the writer of the Kārikā also ? 

IV. At another place he seems to be clearly represent ing Vrttikāra as the author of the Karikā. Commenting upon the word 'tatbā ca' Abhinava says : -- 

"Prakrāntaprakāradvayopasarhārath tặtīyaprakāra sūcanam ca ekenaiva yatnena karomītyāsayena sādhāraṇam avataranapadam praksipati vrttikrt". 

Dh. L., 104.HISTORICAL BACKGROUND OF HIS THOUGHT 

137 

Here the words "ekenaiva yatnena" apparently refer to the following verse. They constitute a part of the sentence the finite verb of which is "karomi". This sentence is attri buted to the Vrttikrt, He has, therefore, to be naturally supposed to be the subject of "karomi'. Does not this show that Abhinava considered the same person to be the author of both the Vrtti and the Kārikā? The limited space does not permit us similarly to dwell upon some more instances of this kind. We, therefore, simply give below the numbers of the pages where similar passages are to be found : 

82-83, 85, 105, 223,246. 

V. And last of all let us add the evidence of Abhinava's colophon to support our opinion on the identity of the author ship of the Karikā and the Vrtti. There can be no difference of opinion in respect of Ananda Vardhana's authorship of the Dhvanyāloka, because the colophons to different chapters make it clear beyond doubt. Abhinava's professed object in his Locana is to comment upon the Dhvanyāloka. Let us, therefore, try to find out what he means when he uses the above title in the colophon of each chapter of his commentary. Does he thereby refer to the Vrtti alone or to the Karikā also ? For, if the case be the latter it would mean that the title “Dhvanyāloka" stands for both. And if so, how can then there arise the question of difference in the authorship of the Kārikā and the Vrtti? It is an indis putable fact that Abhinava means the Kārikā and the Vrtti both when he uses the above title in his colophons, because he comments on both. Take, for instance, the third and the sixth verses of the first chapter. The Locana on them runs as follows: 

"Tatreti dvyamsatve satyapītyarthah, prasiddha iti vanitāvadanodyānendūdayādivallaukika evetyarthah, 

18 

138 

CHAPTER III 

upamādibhiḥ prakāraih sa vyākrto bahudheti sargatih." 

Dh. L., 14. 

and "Sarasvatīti vāgrupā bhagavatītyarthah." Dh. L., 29. Taking, therefore, all the above stated facts into considera tion, we feel that the theory of different authorship of the Kārikā and the Vrtti is untenable. 

PRECURSORS OF DHVANI. From what has been stated before it is clear that there was no book systematically presenting the ideas of either the exponents or the opponents of the theory of Dhvani before Ananda Vardhana. 

(I) UDBHAȚA. Among those, who included Dhvani in Lakşaņā, according to Abhinava's own statement, Bhațța Udbhata was the first just indirectly to touch upon Dhvani without even using this word in his exposition of Bhāmaha's verse, 

"Sabdaś chandobhidhānārthah." 

in his commentary on the latter's Kāvyālankāra. About him we have already spoken before. 

(II) VĀMANA. In connection with Dhvani, Vāmana is placed in the same category as Udbhata. From the manner in which Abhinava refers to him it appears that Vāmana was Udbhata's successor, for he mentions the former after the latter in giving the names of the writers who include Dhvani in Laksanā. This alone cannot be taken to be conclusive evidence. We can, therefore, reasonably take him, as Dr. De points out, and as the tradition also says, to be identical with King Jayāpīda's minister of the same name (779-813 A. D.) 

HISTORICAL BACKGROUND OF HIS THOUGHT 

139 

OTHER VĀMANAS. It may be pointed out here that Abhinava refers to two other Vāmanas, one is Vāmanagupta and the other is Vāma nadattācārya. In fixing the date of the former there is no difficulty, for Abhinava, in his Abhinava Bhāratī, page 297, where the reference occurs, calls him his own uncle, (asmat pitrvya). He, therefore, without much fear of contradic tion, may be said to belong to the second and the third quarters of the 10th century A. D. There is only one verse attributed to him there. It is, therefore, not clear as to whether he did or did not write any work. 

About the other we cannot, at this stage, say anything definitely, excepting that he wrote a philosophical work, the Samvit Prakāśa, to which Abhinava refers in the Tantrāloka, Ah. V, S. 155, as his commentator explains : 

"Gurubhirbhāṣitam tasmād upāyeșu vicitrata" 

T. A., Ah. V, S. 155. "Gurubhih" Vāmanadattācār; eņa, "bhāşitam" iti Sanvitprakāśe." 

T. A., Comm. This work is quoted by Maheśvarāna da in his commentary, Parimalā, on the Mahārtha Maf arī, PP. 21, 23, 26. From the nature of the quotation, found in the Spanda Nirnaya of Kșemarāja, p. 48, att ibuted to Bhatta Srī Vāmana, it appears that he is the se ne person as Vāmana dattācārya of Abhinava's quotatio because the quotation is about the Samvid. He may be lentical with Vāmana, the minister of King Jayāpīda of Kashmir. 

The founder of the Theory of Dhvani. 

ĀNANDA VARDHANA. He was the first person to give a systematic exposition to the theory of Dhvani in his Dhvanyāloka, which is also called Kavyāloka or Sahsdayāloka, and finally to 

140 

CHAPTER III 

establish it. About his date we have already spoken before. His own contribution as compared to that of his predecessors in connection with Dhvani was that he established it as the principal meaning (angi) in marked contrast with its conception as a subordinate figure or mere ornament (alankāra). 

HIS OTHER WORKS. 

Like Lollata and other writers in or about his time, he also wrote both on poetics and philosophy. 

1. TATTVĀLOKA. He, the author of the Kavyaloka or Dhvanyaloka, is spoken of as the writer of another work, called Tattvāloka, by Maheśvarānanda in his commentary, Parimalā, on his own Mahārtha Mañjarī, P. 149. 

"yaduktamh Tattvālokakrtā Kāvyāloke.' From its title it appears to have been a philosophical work. 

2. VIVRTI ON THE VINISCAYA TIKA DHARMOTTAMĀ 

In this work, as e himself says in his Vrtti on the Dhvanyaloka Kārikā, h criticised various Bauddha theories : 

“Yattu anirdesyat' am sarvasvalakṣaṇavişayam Bauddhānām pras Idham cat tanmataparīkṣāyām granthāntare nirūp yişyāmah." 

Dh. L., 233. 

Abhinava, commenting u on the word "granthāntare", says: 

«Viniscayațīkāyām Dharmottamāyāṁ yā vivrti ramunā granthakrtā krtā tatraiva tadvyākhyātam." 

3. DEVI SATAKA. It is a philosophical Stotra in praise of Devi. There is a commentary on it by Kayyața. This Kayyata was a different person from his nar iesake, the author of a commen tary on Patanjali's Mahābhā ya and the son of Jayyața. He, 

HISTORICAL BACKGROUND OF HIS THOUGHT 

141 

according to his own statement at the conclusion of his commentary, was the son of Candrāditya and finished the work in question in 978 A. D. I 

4. VIŞAMAVĀŅA LILĀ. From a quotation in the Vrtti on the Dhvani Kārikā, P. 62, it appears to have been a poetical work of his in Prākrta. 

5. ARJUNA CARITA. From the nature of the context in which reference to this work occurs in the Dhvanyāloka, p. 176, it appears to have been a drama. 

COMMENTATORS ON THE DHVANYĀLOKA BEFORE 

ABHINAVA. There was a regular commentary on the Dhvanyāloka written by one of Abhinava's ancestors whose name we have not been able to trace. It was called Candrikā. It was probably written towards the close of the 9th or the beginning of the 10th century A. D., for, the writer does not seem to have been seen by Abhinava, who refers to him as living in the distant past. ("Purvavamśyaiḥ.") 

Abhinava refers to other opinions also on the inter pretation of Ananda Vardhana's text on PP. 22, 36, 44, 50, 123, 131, 206, 208, 213, 215. But it is not clear as to whether thereby he means some regular commentaries or simply the opinions of the traditional oral exponents. 

OPPONENT OF DHVANI. 

BHATTA NÄYAKA. We have already spoken about him ; but his mention again here is necessary, because he is the chief opponent of 

1. D. S., Comm. 

2. Dh. L., 185. 3. Dh. L., 233. 

142 

CHAPTER III 

Dhvani, whom Abhinava so frequently criticises in his Locana. He wrote 

1. Hrdaya Darpana with the avowed object of demolishing Ananda Vardhana's theory of Dhvani. 

ABHINAVA'S TEACHER IN DHVANI. 

BHATTA INDURĀJA. Abhinava refers to him as his teacher in the introduction to his Locana. The high opinion, that he had about his teacher's great literary attainments, finds expression in Dh. L., P. 100, wherein he says: 

"Vidvatkavisahrdayacakravartino Bhattendurājasya." Although there are so many quotations attributed to him, yet, unfortunately, they are not coupled with the names of the works wherefrom they were taken. There is, therefore, a difference of opinion among the scholars about his being identical with Sri Indurāja, the commentator of Udbhata's Kāvyālankāra Sāra Sangraha. Taking into consideration the fact that Bhatta and Srī are generally found indiscriminately prefixed to the ordinary name and also that the chronological position of the supposed two Indurājas is the same, we are inclined to think them to be identical. The opinion that in the present case Bhatta or Śrī, as found in different places prefixed to Indurāja's name, is simply an honorific prefix is supported by Abhinava's referring to him without either of these prefixes in his commentary on the Ghaṭakarparakulaka as follows: 

Kavīndorindurājasya te saccittavikāśakāḥ Bodhārhśavo vigāhantām bhūrbhuvahsvastrayīmapi. 

Gh. V. (MS.) 

In the concluding line of the aforesaid commentary Sri Indurāja refers to Mukula as his teacher. And Mukula 

HISTORICAL BACKGROUND OF HIS THOUGHT 143 represents Kallaţa to be his father in his Abhidhā Vrtti Mātrkā. We have already shown above that Somānanda was Kallata's contemporary. There is, therefore, only one generation between Abhinava's teacher in Dhvani, Indurāja, and Kallata on the one hand and his teacher in philosophy, Lakşmaņagupta, and Somānanda on the other. Thus the chronological position of Srī Indurāja coupled with the fact that we do not know of any other person of so great literary attainments belonging to that period and that Abhinava was not a person either not to have approached such a person for education in that particular branch of learning or to have extolled an insignificant person in the manner in which he has praised Indurāja, very strongly support the supposition that Abhinava's teacher was the same as the commentator on the Kāvyālankāra Sāra Sangraha. 

BHŪTI RĀJA TANAYA. 

Abhinava refers to Bhattendurāja in the Tantraloka, Ah. 37, S. 60, as Bhūti Rāja Tanaya : 

"Sri Bhūtirājatanayaḥ svapitrprasādah." And Helārāja also in the colophon of his commentary on the Vākyapadiya represents himself as the son of Bhūti Rāja. The two have, therefore, to be distinguished from each other. We cannot say if they were brothers. The genealogy of Indurāja is given in the concluding lines of Abhinava's commentary on the Bhagavadgitā as follows? : 

1. Kātyāyana (distant ancestor ?) 2. Sausuka. 3. Bhūti Rāja. 4. Bhattendu Rāja. 

1. Bh. G. S. 

CHAPTER IV. 

HIS IMPORTANCE AND INFLUENCE. In the preceding chapter we have tried to trace the historical background of Abhinava's tantric, poetic and philosophic thoughts to give a clear idea of the material on which he worked and of the advance that his thoughts present on those of his predecessors. In this chapter we propose to deal with some of the important writers, who succeeded him, to show his importance in the eyes of the later generations and to indicate how far he influenced the ideas of the future writers and how his work was carried on by his immediate successors. We, therefore, for the sake of convenience, divide the writers on whom we have to speak here into two classes : 

1. His commentators. 2. Other writers who were directly influenced by him. 

(I) KșEMARĀJA. 

Among his commentators first of all comes Kşemarāja in the chronological order, which, as before, we propose to follow in this chapter also. In the colophons of all his works he represents himself to be a pupil of Abhinavagupta pādācārya. There is, therefore, no difficulty in fixing his time. Abhinava's last available dated work was completed in 1014-15 A. D. We can, therefore, easily assign Kşemarāja's literary activities to the close of the first and practically the whole of the second quarter of the eleventh century A. D. We have not so far been able to find any passage in Ksemarāja's works which could give us an idea of his parentage. But Abhinava in the 37th chapter of his Tantrāloka, includes "kşema" in the list of the names of 

HIS IMPORTANCE AND INFLUENCE 

145 

his pupils. In another list, which gives the names of his cousins, this very name is mentioned as that of the first of them. They also were his pupils. The indications of a very close contact of himself with Abhinava that Kşemarāja gives by using some such expression as "Padapadmopajīvin" in every work of his, and the important place that he occupies among Abhinava's pupil-writers seem to support the probability that Kşema of the Tantrāloka stands for Ksemarāja, the author of the Pratyabhijñā Hrdaya and other philosophical works. In fact, in the Pratyabhijña Hrdaya he refers to himself as Kșema : 

"Kşemenoddhriyate sārah samsāra vişa śāntaye." 

P. H., 1. If this probability be accepted we would suggest the name of Kșemarāja's father also. In the last chapter we have spoken about one Vāmanagupta, whom Abhinava represents as his uncle. As he is the only uncle of Abhinava, of whom we know, will it be wrong to say that he was Ksemarāja's father ? 

HIS WORKS. Kșemarāja also, like his great teacher, Abhinavagupta, has written on all the three subjects i. e. Tantra, poetics and Saiva philosophy. His work on poetics, viz. the com mentary, called Udyota, on Abhinava's Locana has not so far been accessible to us. It is, therefore, not possible at this stage to assign any chronological position to it. How ever, on the strength of what we have read we can say that he also worked on the lines of his great teacher. He also, like Abhinava, first of all, used the power of his pen in commenting upon the monistic Saiva Tantras, then perhaps upon his teacher's work on poetics, the Locana, 

1. T. A., Ah. 37 (MS.) 2. A. Bh., 297. 

19 

146 

CHAPTER IV 

and last of all on the philosophical works, like the Spanda Kārikā. Thus he carried on the work of his teacher. The students of the Trika philosophy owe a special debt of gratitude to Kșemarāja for a systematic presentation of the views of Abhinava on the Spanda branch, on which the latter, not liking to be classed with the common herd of commentators, did not write. 

1. SVACCHANDODYOTA. It is his commentary on the Svacchanda Tantra. This seems to be the first in the chronology of his available works. It is referred to in his commentaries on Bhatta Nārāyana's Stava Cintāmaņi, P. 226, on the Siva Sūtra, P. 12, and on the Netra Tantra, P. 226. 

2. NETRODYOTA. Netrodyota is a commentary on the Netra Tantra. 

3. VIJĀNA BHAIRAVODYOTA. 4. DHVANYĀLOKA LOCANODYOTA. 

5. SPANDA SANDOHA. Spanda Sandoha is, as has already been pointed out, Kșemarāja's commentary on the first verse of the Spanda Kārikā in which he deals with practically the whole of the Spanda system. In the chronological order of his works this comes before his Spanda Nirnaya? in which he refers to it at more than one place. 3 

6. SPANDA NIRŅAYA. It is a commentary on the whole of the Spanda Kārikā. It may be pointed out here that Dr. Buhler in his Kashmir Catalogue has thrown some doubt on the point of the authorship of the last two works by showing them as the works of Kşemendra (consult P. XXXIII, MSS. 511 and 

517) though he says on page 79:

147 

"Kşemendra, the author of Spanda Nirnaya, No. 511, and of Spanda Sandoha 517 appears to be identical with Kşemarāja, the pupil of Abhinava". 

We do not know the learned Doctor's reasons for assign ing these works to Kșemendra, perhaps he found this name in the colophons of the works in question. But our careful study shows that they are the works of Kșemarāja and that if in the colophons of some MSS. the name of Kșemendra is found, it must have been simply due to the mistake of the scribes. In the Pratyabhijñā Hrdaya and in the Siva Sutra Vimarsinī, which are accepted by all to be of Kşemarāja's authorship, these two works are referred to by him as his own, as the following quotations therefrom show : "Tathā mayā vitatya Spanda Sandohe nirnītam." P.H.,P.24. "Yathā caitat tathā asmadīyāt Spanda Nirnayad avaboddha vyam."

14. A COMMENTARY ON THE KRAMA SŪTRA. Of this we know only from the following reference in Maheśvarānanda's commentary on his own Mahārtha Mañjarī, P. 166: 

"Yaduktam Srī Kramasütreşu..... Yathā ca vyākhyātam Srimat Kşemarājena." 

15. STOTRA. 

148 

CHAPTER IV 

This is known only from the following reference in his own commentary on the Stava Cintāmani, P. 64: 

"Taduktam mayāpi svastotre." 

16. BHAIRAVĀNUKARANA STOTRA. 

It is mentioned as one of his works in the introduction to the Samba Pancāśikā Tīkā. 

17. PARAMĀRTHA SANGRAHA VIVRTI. It is noticed in Dr. Bühler's Kashmir Catalogue (MS. No. 459.) The text is attributed to Abhinavagupta. 

18. VRTTI ON PARAMEŚA STOTRĀVALI OF UTPALA. 

(Bühler's Kashmir Catalogue MS. 458.) 

(II.) YOGARĀJA. The commentator who came next after Kșemarāja was Yogarāja. According to his own statement in the concluding lines of his commentary, Vivrti, on the Paramārtha Sāra of Abhinavagupta, he was a pupil of Kşemarāja? who was in possession of the tradition. We shall, therefore, not be wrong if we say that he belonged to the second half of the eleventh century A. D. At the time when he wrote the said commentary he had already renounced the world and was living as an ascetic at Vitastāpuri in Kashmir. This commentary, according to its author, is from the point of view of pure monism. 

(III.) SUBHAȚA DATTA. He is the first known commentator of Abhinava's Tantraloka. The only source of information about him is Jayaratha's Viveka?. According to this, he was the pre ceptor of Rājarāja, whom we cannot definitely identify with 

1. P. S., Comm., 199. 2. T. A., Comm., Ah. 37 (MS.) 

HIS IMPORTANCE AND INFLUENCE 

149 

any King of Kashmir. There is, however, no difficulty in approximately fixing his time. Jayaratha says that his initiation into Saivaism ?) was performed by Subhața. The former's time of literary activity, as we shall just show, was the close of the 12th and the beginning of the 13th century A. D. We can, therefore, safely say that Subhața lived in the later half of the 12th century. His father's name was Tribhuvana? Datta and that of his grand-father, Viśvadatta. It is probably to this commentary that Jayaratha refers in his commentary on the Tantrāloka, Ah. I, PP. 15-16, where he says that he refrains from criticising different interpretations put upon the first verse by others, because his object is only to take out whatever substance is to be found in their writings and not to criticise them”. This commentary was called 

VIVRTI. No trace of it has so far been found. 

(IV.) JAYARATHA. He was the author of the Viveka, the famous commentary on the Tantraloka. He was a younger contemporary of a certain Kashmirian King, Rājarāja, who was probably the same as Jaya Simha (Circa 1200 A. D.) It was because of the encouragement received from this King that he studied the Tantrāloka. His initiation was performed, as stated above, by Subhata Datta. His teacher in Saivaism was Kalyāna" and so was Sankhadhara in other branches of learning. 6 He had a younger brother named Jayadratha.? Srögāraratha was the name of his father who was a minister to King Rājarāja. 

1. T. A., Comm., Ah. 37 (MS.) 2. T. A., Comm., Ah. I, 15-16. 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, T. A., Comm., Ah, 37 (MS.) 

150 

CHAPTER IV 

HIS DATE. 

He has given the genealogy of his family since the time of Purnamanoratha who was a minister to King Yasaskara 1 of Kashmir (930 A. D.) Eight generations are shown to intervene between the first ancestor of this list, Purņa manoratha, and our commentator, Jayaratha. Of these the fifth ancestor also, viz. Utpalaratha,? who was a minister to King Ananta of Kashmir (1028-1063 A. D.), is of known date. Thus if we allow, according to the ordinary practice of scholars, about a quarter of a century for each generation Jayaratha's time comes to be about the close of the 12th and the beginning of the 13th century A. D. The names of his direct ancestors are given below in the order of their succession : 

1. Pūrņamanoratha (930 A. D.) 2. Utpalaratha I. 3. Prakāśaratha. 4. Süryaratha. 5. Utpalaratha II. (circa 1028-63) 6. Samaratha. 7. Gunaratha. 8. Gungaratha. 9. Srngāraratha. 10. Jayaratha. 

Like Abhinavagupta and others, he also wrote both on Saivaism and poetics. At present we know of only the following three works of his : 

1. TANTRĀLOKA VIVEKA. 

2. ALANKĀRA VIMARSINI. It is a commentary on Ruyyaka's Alarkāra Sarvasva. 

3. ALANKĀRODĀHARANA

151 

(V.) SOBHĀKARAGUPTA. He commented upon Abhinava's famous Bhairava Stotra, giving it a Vaisnavaite interpretation. The manner in which he splits the words and the uncommon meaning that he attributes to them make it clear that the interpreta tion is forced and was not intended by the writer of the original. A copy of the MS. of this commentary is in the possession of the present writer. The commentator interprets the last verse in such a way as to make it indicate the date of his commentary. According to this interpretation, it was written on the day of Sivarātri i. e. the 13th day of the brighter half of the lunar month of Phālguna, in the fifty-third year of Kalit. He has not stated the century: it is, therefore, not possible to fix his time. He does not appear to be a very old writer, 

(VI.) BHASKARA KANTHA. He is the little known writer of the only available commentary on Abhinava's Pratyabhijñā Vimarsinī, called Bhāskari. It is a very learned commentary and gives the traditional interpretation of Abhinava's text. Although it presupposes sufficient previous study of the Saiva literature of Kashmir on the part of the reader in order that he may be able to understand it and needs elaboration, yet, in view of the fact that the tradition about the pratyabhijñā literature is well-nigh dead, a proper under standing of Abhinava's Vimarsini is extremely difficult without its help. This difficulty the writer of these pages himself felt for a very long time when he had to struggle with the text before the discovery of the commentary. Many points would have remained doubtful and many more would have been misunderstood but for the help that could 

ht

CHAPTER IV 

be got from this at the last stage. A copy of it is in the possession of the present writer. It has been edited and will soon be published along with translation, in English, of Abhinava's Vimarsinī, which is practically ready. The author of the Bhaskarī tried, in his own way, to make it as simple as possible so much so that he felt the necessity of explaining the particular method of exposition that he had adopted, by stating in his introduction "Svasutādi bodhanārtham." 

He was of the Dhaumyāyana Gotra. The names of his grand-father and father were Vaidurya Kantha and Avatāra Kantha respectively. He married and had a son, Jagannātha Kantha. His teacher's name was Kaula? Narottama. 

HIS DATE. 

He does not say anything about the time of his life or that of the composition of his works. On enquiry, however, from his living descendants, it has been found that he was six generations removed from the present. We can, therefore, safely say that he belonged to the later half of the 18th century A. D. 

HIS WORKS. 

Besides his commentary on the Pratyabhijñā Vimarsinī which he called "Bhāskarī" after his own name, he wrote the following works : 

1. Sanskrit Translation of LALLA VĀK. 

It is interesting to note in this connection that the Lallā Vak was a Saivaite work in the old Kashmiri written by a woman in about the 14th century A. D.

153 

2. Commentary on YOGA VĀŚIŞTHA. 

It consisted of one lac and ten thousand verses, according to his own statement in his introduction to the Bhāskarī. But only a few fragments of it are now left with his present descendants. This presents a Saivaite interpretation of the text. 

3. HARȘEŚVARA STAVA. 

It was written by him, as the tradition says, on the occasion of his visit to the temple of Harşeśvara in Kashmir. 

The names of his successors are given below in the order of their succession : 

1. (Bhāskara Kantha). 2. Jagannatha. 3. Maņi Kantha. 4. Somānanda. 5. Gana Kantha 6. Mahānanda. 

7. Viśveśvara. The writers directly influenced by Abhinava. 

(I.) KșEMENDRA. 

Is he identical with Kșemarāja ? The only reason for identifying the one with the other is probably a scribal mistake which gives the name of Ksemendra instead of that of Kşemarāja in the colophons of the Spanda Sandoha and the Spanda Nirnaya. These works have now been published and their colophons have the name of the latter (Kșemarāja) and not that of the former. The colophon of the Spanda Nirnaya, for instance, reads as follows: 

"Krtiḥ śrī Pratyabhijñākāra praśisya Mahāmāheśvarā 

cārya Srimad Abhinavaguptanāthadattopadeśasya Śrī Kşemarājasyeti śivam." 

20 

154 

CHAPTER IV 

A careful study of the works of Abhinava and those of Kșemarāja gives a sufficiently clear idea of the personality of Kșemarāja as separate from that of his younger contemporary Kşemendra. We have represented the Tantrāloka to be a production of the first period of Abhinava's literary activity to which the Krama Stotra belongs. It must have, therefore, been written in about 990 A. D. At that time Ksemarāja, the first-mentioned cousin of Abhinava, was sufficiently educated to understand the intri cacies of the monistic Tantras so as to be prompted to join others in requesting Abhinava to write the Tantrāloka : 

"Anye pitryyatanayāḥ śivasaktiśubhrāh 

Kşemotpalābhinaya-Cakraka-Padmaguptāh. 

Anyopi kaścana janah sivasaktipāta Sampreraņāparavasah svakaśaktisārthah Abhyarthanāvimukhabhāvamaśikṣitena Tenāpyanugrahapadam krta eşa vargah 

Ācāryam abhyarthayate sma gādham Sampūrņa tantrādhigamāya samyak 

T . A., Ah. 37 (MS.) 

And the circumstantial evidence is clear enough to show that he began his literary activity either during the last years of his teacher's social life or immediately after the latter's entering into the cave sometime after the year 1015. The period of his literary activity, therefore, falls between 1015 and 1040. But if we identify the two we shall have to allow a period of half a century for the literary activity of one person, because the last dated work of Kşemendra, Daśāvatāra Carita, was finished, as he states," in 1066 A. D. 

1 D. C., Conclusion. 

HIS IMPORTANCE AND INFLUENCE 

155 

Kşemendra, not only bears a different name but has another name also "Vyāsadāsa" which he almost invariably gives along with the former, but which is never to be found coupled with Kșemarāja's name. His connection also with Abhinava cannot at all be said to have been so close as that of Kşemarāja, for, he refers to Abhinava, so far as we know, only once i. e. in the Mahābhārata Mañjarī, wherein he speaks of having heard Abhinava's lectures on poetics : 

"Acāryasekharamaner vidyāvivstikāriņah 

Srutvābhinavaguptākhyāt sahityam bodhavāridheh." 

We know that even today there is a marked difference between S'işya and Srotā. The difference may be said to be similar to that which exists in the present-day colleges between a registered and a casual student. Further, Kșemarāja probably used to live in Bijbihāra (Vijayeśvara) which he mentions as the place of composition of his commentary on the Stava Cintāmaņi : 

"Tenārthipranayad dinaistricaturair yāṁ Kşemarājo 

vyadhāt Ksetre Sri Vijayeśvarasya vimale saişā śivārādhanī." But Kşemendra states Tripureśasaila as his place of residence in one of the concluding lines in his Mahābhārata Manjarī : 

"Prakhyātātiśayasya tasya tanayah Kșemendra-nāmā 

bhavat Tena Sri Tripureśa-sailaśikhare viśrāntisantoșiņā." 

In the opinion of Dr. Bühler, referred to by Dr. De in H. S. P., P. 141, the only thing that can finally settle the question, under discussion, is the discovery of the name of Ksemarāja's father. We may, therefore, add here what little information we have been able to collect on this point. We have already shown how Kșemarāja is identical with 

156 

CHAPTER IV 

Kșema, mentioned in the Tantrāloka, as one of the cousins (pitrvyatanaya) of Abhinava, for, he refers to himself by the abbreviated form, found in the Tantraloka, in his own Pratyabhijñā Hrdaya. We know the name of one uncle (pitrvya) of Abhinava referred to in A. Bh., P. 297. We cannot, however, definitely say that he was the father of Kșemarāja. For, there can be pointed out a possibility of Abhinava's having had more than one uncle, and therefore, of the name of Kșemarāja's father having been different from that of Abhinava's uncle who is referred to in A. Bh. But there cannot be any such possibility about Kșemaraja's grand-father, who also had a different name from that of Kşemendra's grand-father. We have stated in the 1st chapter that the name of Abhinava's grand-father was Varāhagupta. Therefore, if Kşemarāja was Abhinava's cousin, as we have shown before that he was, it naturally follows that Varahagupta was the grand father of Kșemarāja also. But Kşemendra's grand-father, according to the Maha bhārata Mañjarī, was Nimnāśaya : "Kaśmireșu babhūva sindhuradhikah sindhośca nimnāśayah Prāptastasya guņaprakarsayaśasaḥ putrah Prakāśendratām 

Prakhyātātisayasya tasya tanayah Kșemendra-nāmābhavat." 

M. B. M. After stating the above arguments we leave it now to the reader to pronounce the final verdict. 

HIS DATE. There cannot be two opinions about the time of his literary activity, because two of his works are dated. The year of completion of Samaya Mātrkā is stated to be 1050 A. D. in the reign of King Ananta of Kashmir and that of the Daśāvatāra Carita 1066 A. D. when King Kalasa was occupying the throne of Kashmir.HIS IMPORTANCE AND INFLUENCE

ABHINAVA'S INFLUENCE IN POETICS. 

We are not writing a history of Sanskrit poetics. Our object is only to explain the importance of the author who is studied in these pages. It is, therefore, unnecessary to deal with the later writers on poetics separately. Suffice it to say that with perhaps the only exception of Mahima Bhatta, who was probably Abhinava's younger contemporary and who, in his Vyakti Viveka, has tried to explode the theory of Dhvani, all the writers on poetics, who came after Abhinava, for instance, Mammaţa in his Kāvyaprakāśa, Hema Chandra in his Kāvyānuśāsana, Visvanātha in his Sāhitya Darpana, Sāradā Tanaya in his Bhāva Prakāśa. Appayya Dīkşita in his Kuvalayānanda etc., Pandit Jagannātha in his Rasagangādhara, and Mahāmaho pādhyāya Govinda in his Kāvya Pradīpa, follow Abhinava's theory of Rasa and Dhvani and most of them extensively quote him, and that the Sarigīta Ratnakara and the Srigara Ratnākara are more or less simply versifications of parts of Abhinaya's commentary on Bharata's Nātya Sastra. 

158 

CHAPTER IV HIS INFLUENCE IN PRATYABHIJNA PHILOSOPHY AND 

TANTRIC RITUALISM. Pratyabhijña philosophy may be said to be practically dead, for, even in Kashmir there are to be found only three or four Pandits who, to some extent, are still in possession of the old tradition ; but they too, for want of both, encourage ment and enthusiastic and hard-working students, can, with difficulty, remember what was handed down to them. When the writer of these pages approached them for information on some of Abhinava's texts, one of them very frankly said that he was approached for the first time in his life for such information. The case with Saiva rituals, however, is different. Such of them as are connected with the house. holder's life are still performed in many Brāhmaṇa families: and in regard to them Abhinava's Tantrāloka is supposed to be (shall we say ?) the final court of appeal. In earlier times, however, Pratyabhijñā philosophy had its powerful exponents and staunch followers not only in Kashmir but also in as far distant places as Cola country; and all of them acknow ledged Abhinavagupta to be the chief authority on it. Madhava, for instance, who was so closely connected with his contemporary King of Vijayanagar, in his Sarva Darsana Sangraha, acknowledges Abhinava to be the chief exponent of and authority on the Pratyabhijñā. 

We cannot close the chapter without substantiating our statement in the preceding paragraph, by speaking a little on two writers on the Trika philosophy to show Abhinava's influence in places far distant from Kashmir and on the continuity of the literary productions on his lines for several centuries. 

(I) MAHESVARĀNANDA. Maheśvarānanda, son of Mādhava, belonged to Cola. (1) M. M., 202. 

HIS IMPORTANCE AND INFLUENCE 

159 

He was a pupil of Mahāprakāśa' and was an avowed follower of Abhinava, whom he so frequently quotes, and whose method of writing he follows. He attributes his proficiency in poetics to his careful study of the Dhvanyaloka and the Locana and his knowledge of the Self to his following the path of Pratyabhijñā.' His teacher and grand teacher also belonged to the same country and wrote on philosophical subjects on which Abhinava himself had written. Abhinava was interested in and made important contributions to the Krama system, such as the Kramakeli, as we pointed out in the second chapter. Maheśvarānanda's Parama Guru was also similarly interested in and contributed to the aforesaid system at least two known works, the Krama Vāsanā and the Rjuvimarsinī, of which we know from references to them in the Mahārtha Mañjarī, pages 115 and 178 respectively. His teacher also, like Abhinava, was interested in the Pratyabhijñā and wrote the Ananda Tandava Vilāsa Stotra in which the Pratyabhjñā conception of the universe is embodied, as is clear both from the quotation and the context: 

"Yadabhipretya Srī Pratyabhijñāyām uktam : 

Visvarūpoham idam ityakhandānanda brmhitah' iti'. «Yaccoktam asmadgurubhih Ananda Tandava Vilāsa 

Stotre : Vayar tvimām viśvatayāvabhānam Bahirmukhasyāsya tavonmukhasya Svasamhitam viśvavilāpanodyat Svatantratānandamayīm manāmah." 

M. M., 166.

160 

CHAPTER IV 

According to him, Mahārtha, Mahānaya or Krama Darśana is not very much different from the Trika Darśana : 

"Anena Sri Mahārtha Trika-darśanayoh anyonyarh nātyantam bhedapratheti vyākhyātam." 

M.M., 96. 

Mahārtha Mañjarī with his own commentary, Parimala, is the only work of his that is available so far. About other works, we know only from references in the above-mentioned commentary. The following is the list of his known works : 

1. MAHĀRTHA MAÑJARI. 2. PARIMALA. 3. SAMVIDULLĀSA (Referred to in M. M., P. 78). 4. PADUKODAYA.

It may be pointed out here that like Abhinava he also gives the gist of the subject-matter in the introduction to his available commentary. 

(II) VARADA RĀJA alias KrşŅADĀSA. 

He is perhaps the latest known writer on the Kashmir Saiva philosophy. We have not so far been able to find any internal or external evidence to fix his date and place.
