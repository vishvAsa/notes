## Early peopling
> mihirkula brought many V1s to revive culture in kAshmIra. I suspect sadyojyotis was among those v1s from roughly that time keeping with the idea of his Kashmirian locale. Also his focus on raurava-sUtrasaMgraha and svAyambhuva suggest an early age. - MT

## Persistence under Islam
Kashmiri Paṇḍit-s composed Shaiva poems in Persian verse to conduct morning prayers with technical Persian vocab under the guise of the Islamic Arafah prayer, so that muslim neighbors couldn’t tell they were presumably praying to a Hindu God

## Later exoduses
- In 1990, kAshmIri muslims with and Islamic agenda forced out kAshmIri paNDit-s from the valley.
