PHILOSOPHY. 

CHAPTER I. 

PRELIMINARY. 

Abhinava wrote on a number of subjects and was recognized to be a reliable authority on each one of them. He worked on poetics, only during the short period of transition from the Tāntrika to the Philosophical period. The number of his works on poetics is, therefore, much smaller than that of his philosophical treatises. The value, however, attributed to the former, has overweighed that which scholars in general have attached to the latter. Hence he is better known as an able exponent of the theories of Rasa and Dhvani than as the greatest authority on the "Realistic Idealism" or "Trilca" as the system is technically called. 

The reason is not far to seek. The system of philo sophy, he has attempted to formulate and to elaborate, is non-vedic; not because its doctrines are fundamentally opposed to those of the vedic systems, but because it does not recognize the Veda as the final authority. It was, therefore, ignored by the Brāhmaṇa community, which alone has kept alive the literary traditions connected with various schools of Indian thought as a matter of religious duty. 

This non-vedic trend of thought, however, was very popular among the Brāhmaṇas of Kashmir who had the opportunity of knowing it better than those elsewhere. It had a succession of learned writers about whom we have already given the necessary information in the first part. But, for more than a century, it has been neglected even in the land of its birth. Its literary tradition is, therefore, practically dead in Kashmir too, where it primarily existed.

CHAPTER 1 

The local Sanskrit scholars, however, even to-day, hold a very high opinion of it. In fact they, without knowing why, declare it to be the best of all systems of Indian Philosophy. 

Our attempt, therefore, in the following pages is to present this system of Saiva philosophy as clearly as it is possible with the help of the material available at present. Fidelity to the original text is our guiding principle. Our attempt is not to present the system in terms of modern philosophy, but simply to give an exposition to Abhinava's ideas about some of the persistent philosophical problems, and to explain, so far as possible, how he came to form them. Let us, therefore, not be misunderstood if some of the arguments, stated in these pages, do not appeal to the modern minds and some of the views, set forth here, are not in consonance with the doctrines of modern science. 

ABHINAVA'S CONTRIBUTION. 

Indian philosophers, however original their works, have never claimed originality for themselves; their attempt has always been to show that whatever they say is based upon an ancient authority. This holds good in the case of both the Vedic and the non-vedic systems. Sankara declares in unmistakable terms that the only test of correctness of a view is its harmony with the teachings of the Veda and that the argument has value and is to be relied upon only in so far as it supports the principles laid down in the Veda.1 Similarly, Somānanda, the author of the Sivadrști and so the real founder of the Pratyabhijñā School, emphatically states that his Sivadrsti is not a pure creation of his mind but is based upon Sāstra, though his pupil, Utpalācārya, holds that it shows a new path to final emancipation.

167 realisation Prof. Padit... study of Abhinava's works shows that he also, in this 

respect, followed the tradition of his learned predecessors. 

If we take into consideration, for instance, three of his most important works, on which his reputation chiefly rests, we find that two of them, the Isvara Pratyabhijñā Vimarsins and the Isvara Pratyabhijñā Vivrti Vimarsinī, are simply commentaries on Utpalācārya's Isvara Pratya bhijñā Kārikāl and Tīkā respectively, and the third, the Tantraloka, professedly follows the authority of the Mālini Vijaya Tantras. It is, therefore, not possible for us to attribute the authorship of any particular theory to Abhinava as we can do to Kant or Hegel. This, however, does not mean that he did not contribute anything to the "Realistic Idealism" of Kashmir. The fact, on the contrary, is that the philosophical system of Kashmir, with Abhinava's contribution to it, left out of consideration, loses most of its importance. His contribution to the "Realistic Idealism" is of the same nature as that of the great Sankara to the monistic Idealism of the Vedānta. 

The aim of philosophy all over the world at all times has been to explain the what, the why and the wherefrom of the phenomena of knowledge. The chief distinctive feature of Indian philosophy in general and of this system in particular is that it deals not only with the experiences of wakeful, dream and deep sleep states but also with those of the transcendental (Turīya) and the pure (Turīyātīta) states : i. e. it tries to explain not only those experiences which are due to the working of the mind, the intellect and the sense-organs collectively or severally, but also those in which they are perfectly at rest and in which, therefore, consciousness is free from all kinds of affections,

CHAPTER I 

To Indian philosophers the two states, the transcendental and the pure, are not mere myths. They are realisable truths. In fact, the aim of the higher systems of Indian philosophy is to point out an easy way to the realisation of these states. The importance of a philosophical work to the Indian mind, therefore, is commensurate with the degree to which the author is believed to have personally realised them through spiritual experiments. For, he alone can be a sure guide, who is familiar with the path. Abhinava's philosophical works are considered to be very important, because people have reason to believe that the statements on supersensuous matters, contained therein, are based upon the author's personal experience, gained through spiritual experiments, which he carried on for years, as we have attempted to show in his biography. To personal experience he gives the first, to reason the second and to ancient authority only the third place as the basis of his views on supersensuous matters", the revelations of the Turiya and the Turīyātīta states. In fact the charm that this system had for his contemporaries and successors, the popularity that it enjoyed and the high esteem in which it is held even now by the Kashmir Pandits was and is due mostly to the labours of Abhinava both as a scholar and as a spiritualist (yogin). 

The writers of this system, who flourished before Abhinava, wrote only minor treatises, dealing with certain aspects or branches of the system. The books, for instance, which include the word "Spanda" in their titles, deal with what is referred to as "Caitanya" or "Vimarśa" (consciousness) in the Siva? Sutra and the Isvara Pratya bhijñā Kārikā respectivelys, and point out three ways to the realisation of the ultimate reality, the Sambhava, the Sākta

and the Anava. They are mere dogmatic statements of the fundamental principles of the Spanda branch of the Trika. They do not enter into an exposition of the reasonings which can be adduced in their support; nor do they cite any accepted scriptural authority on which they are based. They are, therefore, so brief that all of them taken together would cover hardly more than fifty pages of a printed book. Similarly, those books, which are named after Pratyabhijñā, attempt to establish the existence of an all-including universal Self and point out a fourth way to freedom from I. worldly troubles, through Pratyabhijñā or recognition. Although they are argumentative and expository and consequently twenty times more voluminous than the former, yet, being concerned with only a branch, they could not bring out the full importance of the Trika system as a whole. Moreover, the literature on both the branches, referred to above, is equally silent on the rituals of the system. It was Abhinava, who, for the first time, took up the system as a whole for a rational and exhaustive treatment in his great work, the Tantrāloka ; gave the philosophical conceptions of the different branches a proper place in the whole; showed the comparative merit of all the four means of Mokşa, Anupāya, Sāmbhava, Sākta and Anava ; exhaustively dealt with the monistic Saiva rituals; supported the philosophical and the psychological theories of the system with strong and convincing arguments as well as with extensive quotations from the āgamas of accepted authority and elucidated the existing texts with learned commentaries, like the Sivadrstyālocana and the two Vimarsinīs. 

EXPLANATIONS OF THE NAMES OF THE SYSTEM. 

It is a misnomer to call this system of philosophy "Pratyabhijñā" or "Spanda" as much as it would be to call

CHAPTER 

India "Calcutta" or "Bombay". They are parts and very important parts, but severally they do not present the whole. The word Trika refers both to the authority on which the system is based and to the subject-matter which forms the distinctive feature of this system. It is called Trika for the following reasons : 

(I) In all, there are ninety-two Āgamas recognised by this system. Of these the triad, (Trika) consisting of the Siddhā, the Nāmaka and the Mālinī, is the most important. The system is called Trika because its chief authority is this triad (Trika). 

(II) According to this system, there are three triads, the higher, the lower and the combined (Para, Apara and Parāpara). The first consists of Siva, Sakti and their union; the second of Siva, Sakti and Nara ; and the third of three godesses Parā, Aparā and Parāparā. It is called Trika because it deals with all the three triads. 

(III) It is called so for another reason also, namely, that it explains all the three aspects of knowledge, viz. absolute oneness (abheda), predominent oneness (bhedābheda), and duality (bheda) in the light of its monistic theory (abhedavāda). 

It is also called Şadardha Sāstra," (literally, the school of half of the six) for the following reason : 

This system holds that the Devanāgarī or the Sāradā alphabet represents the process of manifestation of ideas (Parāmarśodayakrama). The first six vowels, a ā ii u ū, for instance, represent the order of succession in which the powers of Anuttara, Ananda, Icchā, Išana, Unmeșa and

PRELIMINARY 

171 

Urmi arose from the Highest Reality. Of the above, those, represented by long vowels, are due either to the association of those, represented by short ones, with their respective objects, as in the cases of Isana and Ormi, or to the union of two, as in that of Ananda'. The former, therefore, are dependent upon the latter and hence are not considered to be of equal importance with them.. Thus it is called Şadardha Sāstra, because it counts as 'principal' only three of the six powers shown above, namely, Anuttara, Iccha, and Unmeşa, which are also referred to as Cit, Icchā and Jñāna 

It has been given the name of Kashmir Saivaism, because almost all the writers of the available literature on this monistic school of Saivaism belonged to Kashmir. 

FOR WHOM IS THE SYSTEM MEANT ? 

Unlike the Vedic systems, this school of thought knows no caste restriction. It is meant for all in whom desire for knowledge and liberation has arisen. A distinction, however, is drawn between following the teachings of the system in life and getting its fruit on the one hand and studying the system and understanding its philosophical intricacies on the other. Any one with a firm determination can follow the teachings: no literary qualification of any kind was, therefore, considered necessary for following it by its early authorities. The case with study, however, is different. It requires a trained and well-informed mind. This system criticises almost all the important schools of thought which came before it. Its proper understanding, therefore, pre supposes, according to the learned tradition, contained in the

172 

CHAPTER 1 

following verse, the knowledge of the six vedic systems of philosophy and of the Veda with its six branches of learning as an antecedent condition : 

"Şaţśāstravid yo vedasya şadangajñaśca vedavit s& eva śrīpratyabhijñādhyayanedhiksto bhavet." 

It requires also a previous study of all the Agamas, a knowledge of the arguments of other dualistic and monistic systems and a command over grammar : 

"Yodhīti nikhilāgameșu padavid yo yogaśāstraśrami Yo vākyārthasamanvaye krtaratih śrīpratyabhijñāmrte Yastarkāntaraviśrutaśrutatayā dvaitādvayajñānavit Sosmin syādadhikāravān kalakalaprāyah pareşām ravah." 

THE AIM. 

The aim of this system, like that of the Vedānta, is to help the individual in self-realisation: and the means also, by which this end is to be achieved, is the same as that of the Vedānta, viz., removing the veil of ignorance, But they differ in their conception of self-realisation, because their ideas of the apparent, (abhāsa) the universe, are different. While the Vedānta holds that the universe (jagat) is unreal, the Realistic Idealism maintains it to be real, because it is a manifestation of the Ultimate. Therefore, while, according to the former, all that we know disappears at the time of self-realisation exactly as, in the case of an illusion, the snake vanishes when the rope is perceived as a fact : according to the latter, the objective universe stands even when the Self is realised, but is known in its true perspective or in all its aspects or bearings. This kind of realisation is spoken of as 'Recognition' (Pratyabhijñā). 

1. 

I. P. V., I, 35. 

PRELIMINARY 

173 

Thus, for the Vedānta, the realisation of the Self is coincidental with the negation of facts of experience in the same way as the perception of the rope as a fact is with that of the snake in the well known illusion. For the Trika, on the other hand, self-realisation brings with it an understanding of the world of experience in its true relations and perspective. There is no negation of the Universe but a new interpretation and appreciation. For this system, therefore, self-realisation is nothing but self-recognition (Pratyabhijñā). 

WHAT IS RECOGNITION ? 

Recognition is an act by which we endeavour to recall! and reunite the former states of consciousness and is a kind of reasoning by which we ascend from a present conscious ness to a former one. It differs from remembrance but slightly. Remembrance is a knowledge which is born of mental impression (samskāra) alone. But in recognition, though the mental impression is an important factor yet it is not the only factor as in the case of remembrance; it is necessarily always coupled with the direct perception of the object which serves as an operating cause. Suppose, for instance, that a certain person was, on one occasion, very much impressed by the sight of a king riding an elephant : and suppose also that some time later he sees the elephant alone; naturally at such a time, because of the law of association, his former impression of the king will be revived and there would arise a picture of the king before his mind's eye. Remembrance is thus nothing but a purely mental perception of a former object of sense-perception. But recognition is not a purely mental perception due to the revival of a past impression. In it the object recollected is actually present before the eyes and the novelty of perception consists in identifying the object, now perceived, with the one, seen before. When a person, for instance, on seeing 

174 

CHAPTER 1 

Devadatta, recollects the previous perception of him and identifies the mental image with the one present before his eyes in the judgment:"it is the same Devadatta as I saw on that occasion," the actual perception of the object is as much a cause of knowledge as the impression left on the mind by the former perception of the same. Recognition, thus, requires not only previous perception of the object but also its presence at the time when it takes place. 

The previous knowledge of the object, which is an essential condition of recognition, is, in some cases, as of one collocation of the object and its attributes, while in others they (the object and its attributes) are known separately. Thus, while in the former case, there is only one mental image of the object with all its qualities, in the latter, side by side with one, caused by the direct ocular perception, there is another also, which is a vague creation of mind and as such is hardly anything more than a mere embodiment of the heard qualities. To illustrate the latter case, which seems to be rather a complicated one, let us suppose that a lady, on hearing the excellent qualities of a certain gallant, fell in love with him even before she had an occasion to see him; and suppose also that that person chanced to pass incognito before her many a time so as to be noticed well enough and to leave the impression of his person on her mind. In such a case, the mind naturally draws a picture of the object of love, which is hardly anything more than a mere embodiment of the previously heard excellences which were responsible for the rise of the passion of love. This image, of course, will be distinct from that, left by the real object of love who passed incognito so many times before her. It will thus be clear that recognition in this case is not so simple an act as in that in which the object and its attributes are known as one collocation, as in the illustration of Devadatta, given above. In the present case recognition 

PRELIMINARY 

175 

is not at all possible unless the veil be removed and the real qualities of the person be revealed so as to make the identification of the imaginary object of love with the person present before her possible. Thus, in the former case the failure to recognise is simply due to forgetfulness on the part of the perceiver. For instance, it is often seen that a big man, like a king, fails to recognise an ordinary person, who was properly introduced to him on a former occasion and who, even now, in all respects, is the same as he then was. To enable the king to recognise the person before him does not require any thing more than reminding him of the past occasion. But in the latter case the failure to recognise is due not to forgetfulness, for, then the passion of love would disappear, but partly to the veil and partly to the existence of a vague mental image, which, as has been said before, is hardly any thing more than a mere embodiment of the previously heard qualities, as distinct from the image of the known object who is really their possessor. Thus in this case recognition requires not only the removal of the veil but also the identification of both the mental images with the unveiled object. 

To illustrate this point let us suppose that a person, while in India, hears of the excellences of a certain lord. He goes to England and there often sees that lord, without knowing him as such, walking like an ordinary man in a garden. He then, on one occasion, goes to the House of Lords, sees that person among the members and recognises him to be the same person as he had so often met in the garden. And let us also suppose that this lord is the same as he had heard about in India and that the former shows many of the qualities of the person, he was so anxious to see. Now, the question, that we have to ask ourselves, is, whether, under these circumstances, the lord will be recognised as such and if not, why not? The answer is 

176 

CHAPTER I 

simple. He has failed to recognise the ord as the one about whom he had heard, because the latter has not yet been pointed out as such by any responsible person. 

There are other minor distinctions between one kind of recognition and another, but we are not immediately concerned with them. We have drawn the above distinction to show what part the present system of philosophy has got to play in self-recognition. 

As in the case of the recognition of the lord so in that of the Self, there are two distinct images in the mind of the recogniser (pratyabhijñātr). In the former case one is caused by the reports, heard in India, and the other by the sight of the lord in a garden in England. In the latter case also similarly, one, that is, of one's own limited self, is due to intuitive knowledge that every body has of himself and the other is created by the descriptions of the Maheśvara or the universal Self that one reads in the sacred books such as the Purāṇas and the Agamas?. When one studies philosophy, there arises the third image, which is different from both the previous mental images. This third image one identifies with one's own self. much as the gentleman of the above illustration identifies the person, whom he frequently saw in the garden, with the lord in the House of Lords. The other image, in both the cases, however, i. e. the image caused by reports heard in India in the one and that created by the description given in the sacred books in the other, will still remain unidentified. Thus, just as the identification of this image in the illustration, as we have just pointed out, depends upon a word from a responsible quarter, so, that of the universal Self as revealed by the study of philosophy, depends upon 

1. I. P. V., I, 20. 2. I. P. V., I, 21. 

PRELIMINARY 

177 

spiritual instruction. The intellectual knowledge, got through the study of philosophy, is called Bauddhajñāna and the spiritual knowledge, that comes from preceptorial instruction, (Dīksā) is called Pauruşajñāna. Of these the former is more important, because it is this that qualifies a person for the latter. 

To make the point a little clearer let us add here that the limited self also is a manifestation. It is characterised not only by obscuration of its perfect Will Power (Svāntantrye sakti) but also by ignorance thereof. That is, the innate limitation of the individual self is twofold. Not only is its perfect power of will hidden from it, but it is also ignorant of the fact that that power really belongs to it, though obscured, for the time being, by Māyā, the principle of obscuration?. In order that there may take place a perfect self-recognition, there is the necessity of the removal of both, of the veil which hides the perfect power of will and of the ignorance which is responsible for the imaginary distinction between the individual and the supreme Self and which stands in the way of recognition even when the veil is removed. The work of philosophy is simply to remove the veil and to expose what it hides, and thus make self recognition possible, as does the appearance of the lord of the above illustration in his lordly form and place. But this alone does not make the recognition an accomplished fact. Therefore, just as in the case of the illustration of the lord a word from a responsible quarter is needed, so in the present case there is the necessity of Dīkņā to remove the imaginary distinction and to bring about the identification of the individual with the universal Self.

178 

CHAPTER 1 

Here it may be asked: if the individual self is really identical with the Supreme, how can recognition or non-recognition of this fact affect its causal efficiency ? Does the recognition of a seed as such or the absence thereof affect its causal efficiency to develop into a sprout ? The reply is that the causal efficiency (artha-kriyā-kāritva) is of two kinds : 

(i) External, which does not affect the mind in any 

way; for example, the development of a seed into 

a plant. (ii) Internal, which does affect the mind; for instance, 

the causal efficiency to give delight. The former does not presuppose recognition but the latter does. To illustrate this point we give below Professor Cowell's translation of Utpala's passage in the Isvara Pratyabhijñā Kārikā, quoted in the Sarva Darśana Sangraha : 

"A certain damsel, hearing of the many good qualities of a particular gallant, fell in love with him even before she had seen him, and agitated by her passion and unable to suffer the pain of not seeing, wrote to him a love letter descriptive of her condition. He at once came to her, but when she saw him, she did not recognise in him the qualities, she had heard about, he appeared much the same as any other person, and she found no gratification in his society. So soon, however, as she recognised those qualities, as her companion now pointed them out, she was fully gratified." Similarly though the individual self is identical with the Supreme, yet we cannot get the happiness of this identity unless we are conscious of it. 

WHAT IS DIKŞĀ ? Dīkņā does not mean, as ignorant people think, simply getting a certain religious formula (mantra) whispered intoPRELIMINARY 

179 

one's ear by a certain religious man. It is rather an act whereby spiritual knowledge is imparted and the bondage of innate ignorance is removed. 

One more point is worthy of note in this connection, viz., that, according to this system, Dīkņā, the spiritual instruction which makes self-recognition an accomplished fact, is not indispensable for mokşa. It is a matter of common experience that even when recognition is due to the removal of the veil and consequent exposure of the hidden qualities and identification of both the mental images with the object present before, it does not always require a word from an authoritative person, as for instance, when the object of recognition reveals some such unmistakable sign? as makes identification of the imaginary vague image with the object present before possible. Saiva writers had observed this and had given the name of Prātibhajñāna to that faculty which enables a person to attain self recognition without the help of Dīkņā. 

SAKΤΙΡΑΤΑ. 

That divine will which leads a person on to the path of spiritual knowledge is called Saktipāta. It may be spoken of as divine grace. It is independent of human action and is the only cause of self-recognition. On this point there is complete agreement between this system and the Vedānta. The latter also says that the Self cannot be realised by means of intellectual power or through the

CHAPTER I 

study of the Vedas or even through spiritual instruction, It can be realised by him alone whom He favours and to whom He reveals himself: 

"Nāyamātmā pravacanena labhyo Na medhayā na bahunā śrutena Yamevaişa vrņute tena labhyo Yasmai vivrņute tanum svām. THE CAUSE AND THE NATURE OF BONDAGE. 

It is a common belief of all the schools of Indian philosophy that ignorance is the cause of bondage and that knowledge is the only means to liberation. The opinions, however, greatly differ in regard to the exact nature of both. Abhinava has tried to explain and harmonise this difference in his comprehensive study of the system. How he has done So, we shall show as we proceed. Let us first state his, or more correctly, the Saiva, view of these. 

When in the Saiva literature "ignorance" is spoken of as the cause of bondage, it does not mean a total absence of knowledge. For, such a state is to be found only in insentient objects, such as bricks and stones, which, because of the absence of life and feeling, cannot at all be represented to be in bondage. It means simply imperfect knowledge, such as is found in ordinary mortals. It may further be pointed out that in such a context it stands not for the intellectual (bauddha) but for the innate (pauruşa) ignorance which is technically called āņavamala (innate impurity). As such it is represented to be the cause of another impurity, called kārmamala (impurity of Karma). (For details on 

1. T. S., 5. 2. T. A., 1, 58. 3. T. A., I, 56. 

PRELIMINARY 

181 

this the reader is requested to refer to the 5th chapter). The latter also, in its turn, is said to be the cause of still another, namely, impurity of transmigratory existence? (Māyiya mala). The self is covered with these three impurities [of innate ignorance, of Karma and of trans migratory existence (Anava, Kārma and Māyīya malas) ] exactly in the manner in whicho an ovule (kaņa) is with nucellus (kambuka), integument (kimśāruka) and husk (tuşa). These covers are responsible for the transmigration of the individual self as nucellus, integument and husk are for the development of ovule. Although these impurities are said to be related with one another by causal relation, yet no idea of succession in their coming into being is intended to be implied. For instance, when the innate ignorance is spoken of as the cause of the impurity of Karma, and the latter of transmigratory existence it does not mean that one follows the existence of the other. It simply means that without one the other cannot exist, i. e., the existence of each of the preceding in the above list is an indispensable condition for that of the following. The existence of the body pre supposes that of the Karma'; and the effectiveness of the latter depends upon the existence of the innate ignorance. Thus if there be no innate ignorance the other impurities will automatically disappear. It is because of this that at one place the innate ignorance is spoken of as the greatest and innermost cover; the six sheaths, consisting of Māyā, Kalā, Niyati, Rāga, Vidyā and Kāla, as the inner and subtle cover; and the body as the gross and outer cover,

CHAPTER 1 

MALAS OR IMPURITIES DEFINED. 

1 ĀŅAVAMALA OR 

INNATE IGNORANCE. 

Innate ignorance is one of the manifestations brought about by the universal Willi Power (Svātantrya sakti). It conceals the real nature of the Self. It is a mere consciousness of the supposed imperfection and limitation which is responsible for the rise of countless individual selves?. It is beginningless though destructible. It is the instrumental cause of the impurity, called Kārma mala, inasmuch as the power of Karma, to affect the soul, depends upon its presence. 

ITS DISTINCTION FROM INTELLECTUAL IGNORANCE 

We have already pointed out that the word "ignorance", whether used in reference to the individual self or the intellect, refers not to a total absence of knowledge but to a limited knowledge which is the same thing as determinate knowledge, i. e. consciousness of something as such to the exclusion of all other things (Sarvo vikalpah samsārah). The intellectual ignorance (bauddha ajñāna) is an affection of the limited self caused by a stimulus. The stimulus is of two kinds, internal and external. The former is due to the revival of old impressions. But the latter arises from the contact of a certain sense with a certain external object. The spiritual ignorance is altogether different from its. It is simply a consciousness of self-limitation, not as associated with the body, the mind or the intellect, but above all of them ; a consciousness which is present in the 

1. T. A., VI, 61. 2. T. A., VI, 60. 3. T. A., VI, 76. 

PRELIMINARY 

183 

transcendental state of the individual self, a state in which the self rises above the material body and all that is con nected with it, so that there is no experience of any thing that happens to the body; a state in which there is no experience of pain of any kind even if the body be cut; a state in which not only the senses and the mind cease to work but the vital airs also suspend animation. It is that element in the consciousness, which is responsible for the automatic break of that state (svato vyutthāna). It is not always that there is conscious association of this limitation with the self. It can remain even in a sub-conscious state. That state of the individual self in which this innate ignorance or limitation is in a sub-conscious state is technically known as the state of purity (Turīyātīta). This state does not automatically cease. It requires some external agency to break it. But when the self is perfectly free from it, there is no break or resumption of connection with the body etc. 

✓ It will thus be clear that the intellectual ignorance is dependent upon the connection of the individual self with the body, with which it co-exists, but the spiritual ignorance is independent of it. It is because of this difference that this system holds that liberation (Mukti) cannot be got through the intellectual knowledge only. The intellectual knowledge can effect salvation only if it is accompanied by the spiritual knowledge. 

This innate ignorance is different from "Rāga", which, according to the Sāükhya, is the cause of bondage. For, while the latter is simply a quality of Buddhi responsible for the attachment of the individual to certain object or objects, the former is a mere consciousness of an imperfection 

1. Ś C., 455, (Bhumikā.) 

184 

CHAPTER I 

because of which the self is subjected to all kinds of later limitations. Rāga Tattva, on which we shall speak in the third chapter, is still a different thing. It is a desire for something undefined. Both of these, the Rāga of the Sānkhyas and the Rāga Tattva of the Saivas, are further manifestations of the innate ignorance. 

This impurity of innate ignorance is independent of the other two impurities. It continues to exist even after they have been destroyed. It passes through four states before reaching that of total annihilation. And it is the association of one of these states with each of the five classes of beings of pure creation that constitutes the chief point of difference of each one of them from the rest. 

It may briefly be stated here that, according to this system, creation is of two kinds, the pure and the impure.2 From Māyā down to Earth, the creation is impure inasmuch as the knowledge of duality predominates in it. And from Siva to Suddha Vidyā the creation is called pure, because the experiencing entities of this creation are the universal beings who realise themselves actually as such and have for their experience the whole of the universe in different forms, but free from all limitations which characterize the determinate knowledge. 

There are eight kinds of experiencers. Five belong to the pure creation, two to the impure and one to the transitional stage between the two. It is the association of one or more of these impurities with the individual self which distinguishes each one of the eight experiencers from the rest. Two, Sakala and Pralayākala, belong to 

1. T. A., VI, 57-9. 2. T. A., VI, 56. 

PRELIMINARY 

185 

the impure creation. Every mortal in the state of creation (srşti-daśa) is Sakala, because there are all the three impurities in him. These very mortals in the state of dissolution (Pralaya) are called Pralayākalas, because at that time they have no mortal coils, the body, which, with all that it can be associated with, is called the impurity of Māyā. Thus Pralayākalas have only two impurities. The experiencers of the transitional stage between the impure and the pure creations are known as Vijñānākslas. 

(Māyordhve Suddhavidyādbah santi vijñānakevalāh). These possess only one impurity, that of innate ignorance, which is inclining towards destruction in their case. 

This impurity of innate ignorance passes, according to Saiva view, through four states before reaching that of total annihilation. Hence the remaining five subjects, who belong to the pure creation, Sambhava, Saktija, Mantra mahesa, Mantrega and Mantra, are represented to have the distinguishing mark of having the same perishing impurity but each in a different state?; in Siva, for instance, it is in the state of non-existence (Dhvasta). Abhinava has given a large number of synonyms of Mala, each indicative of one of its functions in T. A., VI, 73-9. 

2. KĀRMA MALA. 

It has to be distinguished from karma-sachskāra, which is simply an effect left on the self by various kinds of mental and physical actions. It is essentially a mere objectless desire which is responsible for the countless associations of the self with other creations of Māyā. 

1. T. A., VI, 77, 81. 2. T. A., VI, 80.

CHAPTER I 

Its effectability and even its very existence depends on the innate ignorance. We shall revert to this topic in dealing with the Saiva theory of Karma. 

3. MĀYIYA MALA. 

All that the self is associated with because of both, the Kārma-mala and the karma-samskāra, is called Māyīya-mala'. 

THE MEANS OF LIBERATION FROM BONDAGE. 

The perfect knowledge, not intellectual but spiritual, of the Ultimate Reality of the knowable (jñeya), the knowledge which is free from all limitations? and from the idea of duality in any form, is the means of liberation. 

THE INTELLECTUAL AND THE SPIRITUAL KNOWLEDGE. 

A distinction has to be drawn here between the intellectual and the spiritual knowledge (Bauddha and Pauruga jñāna) similar to that as has already been pointed out between the intellectual and the innate ignorance. The spiritual knowledge is that perfect knowledge which dawns upon & person, who has reached the highest stage in the spiritual development through the total annihilation of the innate ignorance. It transcends the limit of language and is, therefore, to be known only through experience. Similarly, intellectual knowledge is that perfect knowledge by virtue of which a person transcends the difference between this and that, and sees only one whole and that too, as a manifestation of himself. The former comes from the Dīksā® and the latter from the study of the monistic

philosophy. The latter is more important than the former, not so much because it can liberate a person right in his life time, as because the Dīkşā is inefficacious in bringing about salvation without the assistance of the Bauddha jñāna”. 

There are four ways to liberation, Anupāya, Sāmbhava, Sākta and Anava. Each of these does not directly lead to the realisation of the Ultimate Reality. Each of the Succeeding, in the above order, leads to that which immediately precedes. It is the first alone which can be called the direct means. The difference, however, between the first and the second i. e. Anupāya and Sāmbhava, is very slight. The former, therefore, is not counted as a separate way in some authoritative books of the system. In fact it is regarded as the highest stage of the latter (Sāmbhava). 

Antoner. Billeder At some places the word "Samāveśa' is found substituted 9 for "Upāya" It is defined as a merging into its ultimate form, the highest reality? of that which, being apparently separate from the Ultimate, is limited. This gives us some idea of the chief point of distinction between one of the ways and the rest. The word "Samāveśa" literally means "complete or perfect immersion". l. There are four such immersions. Beginning from the last, each one leads to the preceding one, up to the first, which alone is considered to be the direct way to salvation i. e. the realisation or the recognition of the Ultimate Reality. This process of immersion appears to be a complete reversal of that of emergence. Or, to put it more clearly, the process involved in Mokşa is the complete reverse of

188 

CHAPTER I 

that of Abhāsa or manifestation. We know that, according to the Trika, creation is nothing but manifestation without of what is within; that, in the order of sucession in manifestation, Ananda, Icchā, Jñāna, and Kriyā follow one another in their respective order; and that these stand for successive states of the universal consciousness in the process of manifestation. We also know that, corresponding to these very states in manifestation or emergence, there are four states leading to complete immersion (samāveśa) as stated above. In fact two of these, namely, the Sākta and the Aņava, are also called Jfiānopāya and Kriyopāya respectively, because they are mostly concerned with the manifestations of the powers of Jñiāna and Kriyā respectively And from the nature of description of the remaining two it is clear that Abhinava meant them also to be called Anandopāya and Icchopāya respectively. Thus, just as in the course of successive manifestation of Ananda, Iccha, Jírāna and Kriyā, each of the preceding leads to that which immediately follows, so in the course of the gradual immersion (krama-samāveśa or mukti) these very powers similarly merge into one another in the reverse order. For, mokşa is nothing but, broadly speaking, an individual dissolution and, therefore, the opposite of manifestation. 

The various stages in manifestation from Cit to Kriyā are admitted to correspond to those from the state of deep sleep to that of action. It would not, therefore, be wrong to say that the four stages leading from the mundane exist ence to the complete immersion in the Highest Reality, similarly correspond to those which are experienced in falling into sleep from the state of activity. If we carefully analyse our successive experiences from the time when we 

1. T. A., 1, 186-7.PRELIMINARY 

189 

attempt to sleep to that when we actually fall asleep, we find that ordinarily there are four well definable stages. The first three are marked by the suspension of the physical, the mental and the volitional activities respectively and the fourth by the loss of distinct individual self-consciousness. If the distinctive features of the above four stages be kept in mind there will be very little difficulty in understanding the nature of the activity involved in and the result reached by, the four successive means to the final emancipation. 

KRIYOPĀYA OR ĀŅAVOPĀYA. Kriyopāya is that path in which the external things, such as repetition of a certain religious formula (Mantra), which are nothing but creations of imagination (Kalpanā), are used as means to self-realisation. It is called Kriyopāya, firstly because to the follower of this path both the conscious ness of self and that of the objective universe are equally prominent as in the characteristic experience "I am this" of the Sadvidyā? (Kriyā) stage of universal manifestation, and secondly, because the physical activities, such as repetition of a mantra, as said above, play an important part in it. Shall we say that the repetition of a religious formula plays the same part in bringing about the liberation as does a lullaby in putting a child to sleep, a state of physical quiescence ? 

JMĀNOPĀYA OR SĀKTOPĀYA. Jñānopāya is the second of the four ways in which repeated attempts have to be made to rise from the stage of the Knowledge of duality to that of unity. When, for instance, & man begins with thinking "The self alone is all this" (Atmaivedanh sarvam), and by the repeated attempt at

190 

CHAPTER I 

elimination is able to rise to the unshakable knowledge of oneness (Nirvikalpa Jñāna) in the form the self", he is said to follow the path of knowledge. It is called Jñānopāya because the mental activities of meditation are the most important factors in it. The activity involved in this may be compared to our autosuggestion in our attempt to sleep which brings mental quiescence. 

SAMBHAVA MĀRGA OR ICCHOPÄYA. 

It is a path in which the perfect knowledge, the knowledge of the Ultimate Reality, comes through mere exercise of the will power, without any serious mental effort at unification (Anusandhi) of ideas or elimination thereof; much in the same manner in which the knowledge of the real worth of a gem comes to an expert jewellera at the very first moment of its sight without any great careful examina tion. It is called Sambhava mārga or the path of Icchā, because in it the exercise of will power is the important factor. The stage reached by this means is the one in which the world of experiences loses its definiteness and, therefore, may be compared to that which immediately precedes sleep and is marked by the presence of only vague ideas such as are conceived in desire. 

ANUPAYA-MĀRGA OR ANANDOPĀYA. 

It is the same as we have discussed above under "Pratyabhijñā". It is called Anupāya, not because there is no use of any means whatsoever*, but because the elaborate means are but of little importance. It is that path by following which the Ultimate is realised even without Bhāvanā. The realisation of the Ultimate comes to the

191 

follower of this path in consequence of just a word from & responsible quarter as in the case of complex recognition described above. The stage attained by this way may be compared to deep sleep, in which consciousness is free from all affections. 

TRIKA CONCEPTION OF MOKŞA. 

Mokşa, according to the Trika, is nothing but the state of perfect purity of consciousness. It is the realisation of the Self, the Para Samvit or the Supreme Consciousness, which is beyond the reach of both thought and language and is the ultimate source not only of both of them but also of all that they imply or involve. It is purely subjective and, therefore, is both unilluminable (aprakāsya) by any external light and unknowable (ajñeya) by any means of knowledge. It transcends all ; it surpasses all ; it is the ultimate aim of all aims. It may be called consciousness, not such as we ordinarily have, but that which is a matter of experience of the Yogins in the pure or post-transcendental state of consciousness. 

OTHER CONCEPTIONS OF MOKŞA FROM THE TRIKA 

POINT OF VIEW. 

This system believes in 36 categories or Tattvas. We shall deal with them in the third chapter and shall explain why only thirty six, neither more nor less, are accepted. Here we are concerned only with pointing out the view of the Trika about the conceptions of Mokşa of other systems and with stating as to which of the 36 categories some of the prominent ones among them reach because of their peculiar philosophical conceptions. In the 1st Āhnika of his Tantrāloka, Abhinava criticises the conceptions of Mokşa 

1. 

T. A., I, 62. 

2. 

T. A., I, 192 

192 

CHAPTER I 

of three systems, the Idealistic and the Nihilistic schools of Buddhism and the Sānkhya, as follows : 

VIJÑANAVĀDIN'S CONCEPTION OF MOKŞA. The Citta (mind or self ?), the Vijñānavādins hold, is extremely pure by nature. Because of the beginningless ignorance, however, it is covered up with adventitious im purities which are the cause of the appearance of the transitory world phenomena. And because all the experiences of the phenomenal world are entirely due to the impurities, the former, therefore, automatically cease with the cessation of the latter. Thus the nirvāṇa is nothing but freedom from the impurities. It is to be attained through constant deep meditation and other practices enjoined in the Buddhist scripture. 

ITS REFUTATION. The defects of the above conception of nirvāṇa are apparent. It conflicts with the well known Bauddha theory of momentariness. If all that exists, is momentary, so also must be the mind. And if so, it cannot have existence long enough to be affected by Bhāvanā and, therefore, there can be no possibility of Mokșa which is simply its effect. Moreover, according to the Idealistic Buddhism, each moment (kşaņa) gives birth to another which is similar to it in all respects. How can then the veiled original moment produce one which is dissimilar to it, i.e., free from the veil ? 

NIHILIST'S THEORY OF MOKŞA AND ITS REFUTATION. 

According to the Nihilistic Buddhism (Sünyavāda), even the Vijñāna of the Idealists has no existence: and Mokşa is nothing but the realisation of this nihility. But this is 

1. 

T. A., I, 64. 

2. 

T. A., 1, 66. 

PRELIMINARY 

193 

an impossible position. For, if nothing exists what can be realised and by whom? But if, in order to get out of this difficulty, the existence of the realiser' be admitted, that would mean the abandonment of the fundamental principle. The Nihilist's conception of Moksa is thus as inconsistent with his fundamental principle as that of the idealist. 

SANKHYA CONCEPTION OF MOKŞA AND ITS CRITICISM. 

The Sānkhya conception of Moksa is no better. The Sāökhya holds that the whole universe is an evolute of an eternal principle, called Prakrti ; that Puruşa, the self, is altogether passive and simply looks indifferently on the work of the former ; and that freedom from worldly bondage can be attained through the correct knowledge of the twenty-four categories of the Sārkhya system as distinct from the self. But the question, that the Trika raises against this theory, is, how and where can this knowledge of distinction take place ? The Prakrti is insentient and, therefore, no knowledge such as "I have been seen and, therefore, let me not work for him" can reasonably be attributed to her. The case of puruşa is no better. He is perfectly passive (nirlepa). The supposition, therefore, of any such affection in puruşa as that involved in knowing the distinction between himself and the twenty-four Tattvas would mean selfcontradiction. 

These systems have thus failed to render a coherent account of the position they have attempted to maintain. Their founders and exponents have not been able to understand the true nature of the Ultimate Reality They are not, however, as far away from the truth as the materialists. They have made approaches to it with varying degrees of success, some being a little nearer it than others. Each one of them has been able to grasp the real nature of 

25 

194 

CHAPTER I 

some one or the other of the higher Tattvas which he has taken to be the ultimate reality. The Bauddha, for instance, has understood the real nature of the Buddhi Tattva, the Sankhya that of the Puruşa? Tattva, and the Pātañjala that of the Niyati Tattva.2 These systems, there fore, can surely help in the attainment of the respective Tattvas which they fully explain. But none of them can bring about the complete self-realisation, the full recognition of the Ultimate Reality. 

The followers of these systems however, do rise above the level of the common man inasmuch as they get liberation, though partial, from the impurity, called Māyīyamala. But they cannot be spoken of as liberated (mukta) in the real sense of the term, because the remaining two impurities, namely, the kārma and the āņava malas, remain associated with them even after the realisation of what they consider to be the ultimate reality. The perfect freedom, therefore, the Trika holds, can be got only through the Pratyabhijñā. 

1. T. A., I, 69. 2. T. A., I, 70. 

CHAPTER II. ĀBHĀSAVĀDA. 

or 

"REALISTIC IDEALISM." The aim of every system of philosophy is to explain the why, the what and the wherefrom of the knowable. Every system bases its conclusions on a careful study of facts of experience and the comparative importance of each depends upon how far it satisfactorily accounts for these facts. Abhinava claims this basis of facts for his system, the Trika. To the facts of experience, as has already been stated, he gives the first, to reason the second, and to a scriptural authority only the last place as the basis of his theories. 

Abhinava differs in his explanation of the world of experience from both the realistic and the idealistic schools of Indian Thought. From the logical realism of the Nyāya and from the atomistic pluralism of the Vaiśesika he completely differs both in details and in fundamentals. From the realistic dualism of the Sankhya, from the subjective idealism of the Bauddha and from the monistic idealism of the Vedānta, however, his difference is confined mostly to the fundamentals only. Because the Trika system, on which his explanation is based, accepts, with some modifications of course, the twenty four categories together with the Puruşa concept of the Sankhya, the principle of momentariness of the Bauddha and the Māyā of the Vedāntin. 

1. 

T. A., 1, 149 

196 

CHAPTER II 

The world of experience, according to him, therefore, is not a creation the God, who is simply an active agent and brings the experienceables into being with the help of some such material cause as the atoms; nor is it an evolute of the Prakrti, as the Sānkhya conceives; nor & purely subjective experience, as the Vijñānavādin represents : nor even & mere illusion, as the Vedāntin believes it to be. It is, he holds, real, because it is a manifestation of the All inclusive Universal Consciousness or Self exactly as a creation of a yogin is a manifestation of an individual self, But it is ideal, because it is nothing but an experience of the Self and has its being in the Self exactly as our own ideas have theirs within us. Hence the Trika, because of its theory of Ābhāsavāda, presented in these pages, is called the "Realistic Idealism". 

ABHÄSA DEFINED. 

All that appears; all that forms the object of per ception or conception ; all that is within the reach of the external senses or the internal mind : all that we are cons cious of when the senses and the mind cease to work, as in the state of trance or deep sleep; all that human conscious ness, limited as it is, cannot ordinarily be conscious of and, therefore, is simply an object of self-realisation ; in short, all that is i. e. all that can be said to exist in any way and with regard to which the use of any kind of language is possible, be it the subject, the object or the means of knowledge or the knowledge itself, is Abhāsa. 

THE COMMON BASIS OF ABHĀSAS. 

The explanations of the phenomenon of knowledge, as given by the dualists and the pluralists, have been declared unsatisfactory, because they present an insurmountable 

1. IP. V., I., 35-6. 

ABHĀSAVĀDA 

192 

difficulty in bridging the gulf that divides the self from the not-self. If the subject and the object are completely cut off from each other, have exclusive and independent existence, and are of opposite nature, like light and darkness, (Tamahprakāśavad viruddhadharminoh, S. Bh.) how can there be any connection between the two, which is so very necessary for the production of the phenomenon of knowledge. The meeting of the self and the not-self, in this case, seems to be as difficult as that of the two logs which are carried by two different currents which separately lose themselves in the sands. 

Na hi prthak prthak pariksīņeșu srotahsu taduhyamānāh trnolapādayah samanvayam kamcid yānti, 

I. P. V., I, 283. The realistic idealism therefore, puts forth its theory of the All-inclusive Universal Consciousness or Self. 

ANUTTARA. This All-inclusive Universal Consciousness, this logical necessity to satisfactorily account for the phenomena of knowledge, is called Anuttara? (the Highest Reality) or Parā or Pūrņā Samvid (Supreme or perfect consciousness) in this system. As the word Anuttara implies, it is a reality beyond which there is nothing: it is, therefore, free from all limitations. It is undefinable in terms of ordinary every day life 

Na vidyate uttaram prasna prativacorūpam yatra 

6 P. T. V. 19. It cannot be spoken of as this or that' nor as “not this " or "not that". It is "all", but not in the sense in which "all" is apprehended by the limited human mind. The mind cannot grasp it, and, therefore, no talk

P.T. V.,9. 

2. P.T. V., 21. 

198 

CHAPTER IL 

about it is possible. It is not a thing to be perceived or conceived but simply to be realised. Whatever word or words we may use to indicate it, we fail to convey the idea of its real nature ; because the words stand for a certain definite idea but it is indefinite, not in the sense that it is a shadowy nothing or nihility, but that it is much more than is signified by some word or words. All the statements to define it are like those of the proverbial four blind men who described an elephant to be something like a table, a broom stick, a rough pillor, or a winnowing brsket, according as each of them could know it by feeling the back, the tail, the leg or the ear only respectively. Who can say that the conception of an elephant of each one of them was altogether wrong? Because nobody can deny that an elephant is partly like what each one of them separately described it to be. Nor can the conception be said to be wholly correct, because the elephant is not only as described by each one of them separately or even collectively but something more also. The Highest Reality is similarly all that which can possibly be conceived by those who possess the power of conception ; but it is not that much only. It is much more than the limited human mind can imagine it to be. 

The ideas of unity and multiformity, of time and space, and of name and form, are based upon certain ways and forms in which the Ultimate appears. The transitory world represents an insignificantly small part of the whole of the manifestation. It is, therefore, as unreasonable to apply these ideas to the Anuttara as such, as it would be to apply the ideas formed by each blind man separately to the elephant as such : 

"Uttaram ca sabdanam, tat sarvathā 'idrsam tādrsam iti vyavacchedam kuryāt tad yatra na bhavati, avyavacchi nnam idam anuttaram,'' P. T. V., 21.ĀBHĀSAVĀDA 

199 

This concept of the Anuttara is very much similar to that of the pure suddha) Brahman of the Vedāntin. Compare for instance the following quotation from the Tavalakāro panışad : 

"Na tatra cakşur gacchati no vāg gacchati no mano na vidmo na vijānīmo yathaitad anuśişyād anyadeva viditād atho aviditād adhi.” T. U., Ch. I, 3. 

After the admission that the Ultimate Reality is beyond the reach of thought and language, the attempt of the Abhāsavādin to speak on it is similar to that of the Vedāntin, who, as we have just pointed out, agrees to a very large measure with the former on this point. Both attempt to give an idea of the Ultimate in its relation to us as the Creator. Both admit that no definition of the Ultimate can be perfect and still both attempt to define it in words, which, according to them, express the reality in the best possible way. 

THE ULTIMATE AS PRAKĀŚA VIMARSAMAYA. 

The Ultimate, according to the Abhāsavāda, has two aspects, the transcendental (viśvottīrņa) and the immanent (viśvamaya). The latter is described as "prakāśavimarsa maya". The conception of macrocosm of this system is based on a careful study of microcosm. In order, therefore, to show clearly as to what these two words really stand for, it is necessary to point out their import when they are applied to the individual self. 

Each of the two words represents an aspect of the individual self. The prakāśa is conceived to be very much like a mirror. In this aspect, the self is simply & substratum of the psychic images, which are merely its modes or forms due to the stimulus received either from

external objects, as at the time of direct perception, or from internal factors, the revived residual traces, as at the time of imagination or dream. These images have very great similarity with those, cast by external objects on a mirror, which shows them as one with itself without losing its purity or separate entity. The difference, however, between this aspect of the individual self and a mirror is that the latter, in order that it may receive reflection, requires an external light to illumine it. A mirror in darkness does not reflect any image. But the self shines independent of all external lights and does not need an illuminator, in order that it may receive reflection. 

The word "prakāśa" implies the residual traces also which are essentially the same as their substratum. The reason is obvious. The reflections are essentially the same as their substratum. The psychic images, because of their being of the nature of reflection, are, admitted to be essentially the same as prakāśa. And because these very psychic images, existing under a sort of cover, are called residual traces or sarskāras, they too, therefore, are not regarded as different from prakāśa. 1. The prakāśa aspect, however, is not the most distinctive aspect of the individual self, because it is to a large extent common to other things also, such as mirror, crystal, and maņi, If, therefore, the individual self had been only prakāśamaya it would have been no better than a substance capable of receiving reflection. The word vimarśa explains what other distinctive features it possesses and why it does not belong to the same category as that to which a maņi or a crystal does. 

“Vimarśa" stands for the distinctive aspect of the self. It signifies the capacity of the self to know itself in all its purity in the state of perfect freedom from all kinds of 

ABHĀSAVĀDA 

201 

affections; to analyse all its states of varying affections due either to the internal or the external causes; to retain these affections in the form of residual traces (samskāras); to take out, at will, at any time, any thing out of the existing stock of the sarskāras and bring back an old affected state of itself as in the case of remembrance, and to create an altoge ther new state of self-affection by making a judicious selection from the existing stock and displaying the material so selected on the back-ground of its prakāśa aspect as at the time of free imagination. The word "Vimarsa" stands for all this and much more. At times "āmarsa" and "pratya vamarsa" also are used as substitutes of «vimarsa"; but they always do not connote all that «vimarsa" does. It represents the distinctive aspect of the individual self and differentiates it from mirror, maņi, crystal and similar other substances capable of receiving reflection. The point has very clearly been stated by Abhinava in his Pratyabhijñā Vimarsinī as follows: 

"Atha anyenāpi satā ghatena, yatovabhāsasya prati bimbarūpā chāyā dattā, tām asau avabhāso bibhrad ghatasya prakāśa ityucyate,/ tatasca ajadah, tarhi sphatikasalilamukurādih api evambhūta eva iti ajadah syāt. Atha tathābhūtam api ātmānam tam ca ghatā. dikaṁ sphatikādih na parāmrştum samarthah iti jadah. tathā parāmarśanam eva ajādyajīvitam antarvahiş. karanasvātantryarūpam" 1. P. V., I, 198. 

Thus when the Trika speaks of the individual self as "Prakāśa vimarśamaya" it means that the self is self luminous, and contains residual traces within and that it is capable of receiving reflection, of knowing itself and others, of controlling what it contains within and of giving rise to new psychic phenomena with the residual traces which are essentially the same with itself, 

26 

202 

CHAPTER II 

Let us now see what does the expression "Prakāśa vimarśamaya" mean when it is used with reference to the Universal Self. According to the Trika, as said before, the creation of the universe by the Universal Self is a manifestation without of what is already within on the back-ground of itself (svātmabhitti). The manifested universe is only apparently separate from the Self much as reflected external object is from a mirror. It is in its essential nature exactly like the limited manifestation of an individual at the time of dream, remembrance, imagination or yogic creation. Its substratum is, as in the case of the limited manifestation, the prakāśa aspect of the Self which is affected in the same manner as the individual Buddhi (the self itself so called at the time of affection) is at the time of dream. The reasons, therefore, which justify the use of the word "prakāśa" in reference to the individual self hold good in the case of the Universal Self also. For, both shine' (prakāśate) and are capable of receiving reflection, of shining as one with the cause of affection and of making it one with themselves. 

One point of difference, however, between the individual prakāśa and the universal, as substrata of what is reflected on them, has to be noted here ; namely, that the affection of the former is caused not only by the internal causes, as in the case of dream or imagination, but by the external also, as at the time of & direct perception. But, since the latter is universal and all-inclusive, its affection by any external cause is out of question. 

But the manifestation is a systematic action and requires a selection to be made out of the existing stock within. Therefore, it presupposes knowledge, will and self-consciousness (ānanda) Each of the above three 

1.

2. I. P. V., I, 182. 

ABHĀSAVĀDA 

203 

attributes depends upon that which immediately follows; because without self-consciousness, as our experience tells us, there can be no desire ; similarly without desire no knowledge is possible: and how can any systematic action be possible unless there be knowledge of the object, towards the accomplishment of which a particular activity is to be directed, and of the means by which the said object is to be achieved ? The word "vimarśa" therefore, when used with reference to the Universal Self stands for that power which gives rise to self-consciousness, will, knowledge and action in succession. 

SVÄTANTRYA SAKTA 

This very "vimarśa' is spoken of as "Svātantrya," because its existence does not depend upon any thing else, as does that of will, knowledge and action, each of which depends for its existence upon what immediately precedes. This represents the principal power of the Highest Lord (Maheśvara) as the Self is often called. This includes all other powers which are attributed to the Ultimate as the following quotations show : 

"Citih pratyavamarśātmā parāvāk svarasoditā 

Svātantryam etat mukhyam tad aišvaryam parameśituh." 

1. P. V., I, 204. "Eka evāsya dharmosau sarvākṣepena vidyate

T. A., I, 107. "Vastutah punarapyahampratyavamarśātmā svātantrya 

saktirevāsyāsti." 

T. A., Comm., 1, 108. 

For the conception of the principal power of the Parama Siva as Svātantrya, the Trika seems to be indebted to Pāṇini; because it is Pāņini, who, so far as we know at 

204 

CHAPTER 11 

4.cm 

present, first conceived the svātantrya to be the chief characteristic of an agent. 

"Svatantrab kartā." Pā.. I, 4, 54. For, according to the Trika, the relation between the 

Parama S'iva and the universe is that of the manifestor my and the manifested or manifestable, that is, of the subject 

and the object; and because it is the power of «Vimarsa" which gives rise to self-consciousness etc. and distinguishes the subject, and because, unlike the will etc., it does not depend for its being and causal efficiency on any thing else, therefore, the word "svātantrya" has at places been substituted for "Vimarśa." The word "Svātantrya" does not imply capriciousness, wantonness or self-willedness. The ultimate power, is not wanton, capricious or self-willed, according to the Trika, as a superficial reader of its literature often thinks. The simple implication of this expression, when used with reference to Parama Siva, firstly is, that He has the same independent power over what He contains within, as we ourselves, as limited conscious beings, have over our samskāras which lie within us before their rise, much as the universe lies within Him before its manifestation; and secondly, that just as in our case it is the power of conscious ness (vimarsa) which is responsible for bringing the sub conscious ideas into conscious state at the time of remem brance and imagination etc. so it is the svātantrya sakti which manifests without what lies within the Ultimate. The assumption of the svātantrya sakti will thus appear to be simple, natural and based on the fact of common experience and not a preposterous conception without any other basis than a theological prejudice, as some critics have opined. 

"Svātantrya sakti" is a very comprehensive expression of the Trika terminology. It is used with reference to the 

ĀBHĀSAVĀDA 

205 

Universal Self when all the possible powers, which can be attributed to it (Self), are intended to be implied. It is so often to be met with in the Trika literature and the idea, implied by it, is so characteristic of this system that it is often called the Svātantryavāda. 

OTHER NAMES OF SVĀTANTRYA SAKTI. Al 

The Saiva writers on the various branches of the Trika, looking at the Svātantry aspect of the Universal Consciousness from different points of view have given it different names. In the Siva Sutra of Vasugupta it is called "Caitanya' for the simple reason that it has the power of uniting and separating and dealing in multifarious other ways with what is within". It is called Sphurattā or Spanda in Spanda literature, because it represents that essential nature of the Universal Consciousness which is responsible for its apparent changes from the state of absolute unity. It is also called Mabāsattā, because it is the cause of all that can be said to exist in any way. Another name by which it is referred to at some places is Parāvāk", because it represents the speech in its most subtle form. 

PRAKĀŠA AND VIMARSA EXPLAINED. From what has been stated above two points become clear, namely, (I) that the word "prakāśa" is used for that aspect of the immanent Ultimate, which serves as a subs tratum for all that it manifests, exactly as the Buddhi does for the images that an individual builds up at the time of imagination ; and (II) that similarly the word "vimarsa." stands for that aspect which is simply a power, which, for

206 

CHAPTER II 

want of a better word, we call here "consciousness"; a power, which, by giving rise to self-consciousness, will, knowledge and action in succession, is responsible for selection from what is already within and manifestation of the so selected material as apparently separate from itself. The self-consciousness, and the powers of will, knowledge and action, may be said to be different aspects of this very "vimarsa". 

THE ESSENTIAL NATURE OF THE MANIFESTED AND 

THE MANIFESTABLE. But now the question arises : if the power which is ultimately responsible for manifestation is “Vimarśa" and the substratum of manifestation is prakāśa" what about the manifested and the manifestable? Are they different from both "prakāśa" and "vimarsa" and so something separate from the Ultimate ? The reply of the Trika to this question is that the manifestable and so naturally the manifested are prakāśa. 

(Prakāśātmā prakāśyortho nāprakāśaśca siddhyati). 

I. P. V., I, 159. The reason is not far to seek. This system holds that the manifested universe is brought about by the Ultimate exactly as are the objects of a dream by an individual and that the relation of the Ultimate with the manifested universe is the same as that which exists between the objects of a dream and the dreaming self. The objects of a dream and the residual traces of the former experiences, which are responsible for the rise of the appearances of a dream, are accepted to be essentially the same as the prakāśa aspect of the dreaming self. Believing, therefore, that what is true in the case of the mircocosm is no less so in that of the macrocosm, the Trika holds that the manifestable and the manifested are essentially prakāśa.

THE IMPLICATION OF "PRAKAŚA-VIMARSAMAYA" 

SUMMARIZED. Thus it appears that the word prakāśa stands not only for the common substratum of all the manifestables and the manifested but also for the manifestables and manifested themselves. Therefore, when the Trika speaks of the Ultimate as 'prakāśa vimarśamaya" it means to imply that the Ultimate, in its aspect of prakāśa, is both the universe, in either manifested or unmanifested state, and its permanent substratum ; and that in its aspect of Vimarsa, it is that power which is ultimately responsible for keeping the universe in the state of perfect identity with itself, as at the time of Mahāpralaya, and for manifesting it as apparently separate from itself, as at the time of Creation.

THE NAMES OF THE ULTIMATE AND THEIR DISTINCTIVI 

IMPLICATIONS. 

The Ultimate in its immanent aspect is referred to by three names with a distinctive implication in each case. The implied distinction refers to the relation of the Universal Consciousness with the manifestable. It is called Anuttara when the manifestable is in the state of absolute unity with it, as, for instance, at the time of the total universal dis solution (mahāpralaya). When the relation of absolute unity is substituted by predominant unity (bhedābheda) it is spoken of as Siva, as at the time of pure creation. The term Maheśvara, however, is applied only when the manifestable assumes distinct existence within the Universal Consciousness much as our thought currents or ideas do within ourselves, when we are about to deliver a very thoughtful speech. For a clear conception of the different relations of the manifestable with the Universal Conscious ness, as implied by the words Anuttara, Siva and Maheśvara, their comparison with the relations of speech

with consciousness (self) in the states of Parā Paśyanti and Madhyamā respectively, as described in the second chapter of the first part, will be useful. 

The available literature does not speak much on the former two, perhaps, because the first represents a state of absolute unity of all and, therefore, has not got much that calls for an explanation, and the second is related to & creation to which the perceptual and the inferential means of right knowledge do not apply: it is known only from the Āgamas It is only the last with which the Trika 

literature deals in detail. In fact, the Pratyabhijñā branch 1 of the Trika, which expounds the highest philosophy of the 

system, is primarily concerned with proving or establishing the existence of, Maheśvara. The two Adhikāras, Jõāna and Kriyā, which cover more than four-fifths of the Pratyabhijñā Vimarsinī, give simply an exposition of Maheśvara's two powers, after which the above mentioned Adhikāras are called. The following verses make it abundantly clear that the word "Maheśvara, in the Saiva terminology, means the manifestor of the impure creation, on which all the worldly transactions depend : 

"Evamanyonyabhinnānām 

Aparasparavedinām Jhānānāmanusandhāna Janmā naśyejjanasthitih Na cedantahkrtānanta Visvarūpo maheśvarah Syādekaścidvapur jñāna Smrtyapohanaśaktimän." 

1. P. V., I, 103-6. 

Our object in these pages, as set forth in the very beginning, is to explain the phenomena of knowledge of every day life. After discussing, therefore, a few questions which more or less relate to all the three aspects of theABHĀSAVĀDA 

209 

Universal Consciousness and the ābhāsas in general, we shall mostly confine ourselves to the impure creation and the Maheśvara. 

HOW ARE THE ABHĀSAS RELATED TO THE UNIVERSAL 

CONSCIOUSNESS ? The Trika. conception of the macrocosm, as we have just pointed out, is based on a very careful study of the microcosm. It holds that what is true in the case of the individual self is equally so in that of the Universal Self, for, both are identical ; and that the Self is nothing but consci ousness (Caitanya). We shall, therefore, be best able to answer the above question by pointing out how the individual manifestations are connected with the individual conscious ness. We know of five states of the individual consciousness, the waking, the dreaming, the deep sleep, the transcendental and the pure, which are technically called Jāgrat, Svapna, Sușupti, Turīya and Turīyātīta. The first three are well known. The last two refer to two kinds of concentrated states (Samādhi avasthās), The varying experiences of these states may be spoken of as the experiences of the unaffected (Suddha) and the affected (Parimlāna) states of consciousness. The latter is not always due to the external stimulus. At the time of imagination and dream there is no such external stimulus as there is at that of the direct perception ; but in the former case the consciousness is no less affected than in the latter. 

If we analyse our consciousness as affected by imagina tion, we find two elements in it, the subjective and the objective, i. e. the imagining consciousness which is respon sible for the rise of the images, of which it is itself both the back-ground and the perceiver, and the images them selves which have no other basis than the consciousness 

27 

210 

CHAPTER II 

itself and are due to internal factors. These factors, in order that they may affect the consciousness in a certain order and not promiscuously all at once, have to be supposed to be within the control of some intelligent power. This controlling power is nothing else than the consciousness itself, which may also be called self, because, as has already been pointed out, according to this system, self is nothing else than consciousness. 

Now the question is how these factors are connected with the self, or rather, where and how do they exist before their rise ? Our experience tells us that they rise at our will from our consciousness independently of all external help and appear on the back-ground of consciousness and again merge in the same, much in the manner of waves in the ocean. If so, the answer to the above question is that just as the waves exist in the ocean before they rise, so do the images, which affect the purity of consciousness at the time of imagination, in the self, before they appear on the back-ground of its prakāśa aspect. This is exactly what Abhinava says in regard to the relation of Abhāsas with the Universal Self in the course of discussion on the several meanings of the word "Anuttara" in the Parātrimśikā vivarana : 

"Tattvāntarāņi şaţtrimśat anāśritaśivaparyantāni 

parabhairavānupraveśāsāditatathābhāvasiddhīni." 

Thus, according to this system, all that has existen tiality, from the Siva down to the earth, exists within the Ultimate much in the same way as do our ideas within ourselves at the time when the self is in an unaffected state and so also all is externally manifested, at will, independently of all external causes. This explains why all that exists is called Abhāsa. It is Abhāsa because it is manifested (Abhāsyate) by the Universal Self or because it is manifest (Abhāsate). 

ĀBHĀSAVĀDA 

211 

THE "WHY' OF THE MANIFESTATION EXPLAINED. 

Here it may be asked “Why does the Self manifest these Ābhāsas ?" Abhinava answers this question by saying that the nature of a thing cannot be questioned. It is absurd to ask why fire burns. To burn is the very nature of fire and so to manifest without what lies within is the very nature of the Self. It is natural for consciousness to assume a variety of forms. In fact, it is this that differen tiates self from not-self. A jar, for instance, cannot change itself independently of external causes, but the self can and does : 

"Asthāsyadekarūpeņa vapusā cenmaheśvarah 

Maheśvaratvam samvittvam tadatyakşyad ghatādivat." 

Our study of the microcosm fully supports the fact that such is the nature of the Ultimate Reality. Can we attribute the individual manifestation of dream or imagination to anything else than the very nature of the individual self ? 

DOES THE ULTIMATE REALITY CHANGE ? 

Here it may be asked if the Ultimate Reality appears in all the perceptible forms it must be admitted to be changing ; how then can its eternal character be maintained ? In every day life the changeability and the destructibilty are found universally concomitant. In fact, our idea of destructibility of such things as the sun and the moon is simply a matter of inference drawn from the change that we perceive them undergo. Therefore, if the Highest Reality also changes, as it must, in order to appear in a variety of forms, it must also be transitory like momentary things of the world. Moreover, if the Highest Reality contains within all that it manifests how can it be represented to be one 2 

212 

CHAPTER II 

To take up these questions in their respective order, let us find out what is meant by change. When a thing is seen with some additions, it is said to have changed. When, for instance, we visit a certain place after a very long time and see very many things in addition to those which we saw on a former occasion, we say "the place is changed". Further, when the case is the reverse i. e. when we do not find many things which attracted our attention before, we say the same. The former kind of change is called "Āgama" (literally, coming in) or addition, and the latter "Apāya" (going out) or loss. There are two more kinds of change, known as transformation (Pariņāma) and modification (Vikāra). When milk changes into curd it is said to have been transformed (Pariņata) but when clay is changed into a jar, or gold into an ear-ring, it is said to have been modified (Vikāram gamitah), The chief distinction between the above two kinds of change is that while in the former case the thing cannot recover its former condition, milk, for instance, once it changes into curd, cannot again become milk in any way; in the latter case such a recovery is very common. A lump of gold, for instance, after having assumed a variety of forms, such as those of ear-ring and bangle etc., can again recover its old form of lump. It is thus clear that, while the first three kinds of change involve addition to or loss of the existing constituents, as in the first two, and irrecoverable loss of quality, as in the third, in the last there is simply a difference in the arrangement of the constituents. It is because of this that, while destructibility is admitted to be universally concomitant with the former three kinds of change, it is not so with the last one. How1 else could the Vaiseșika, who holds the atoms to be eternal, maintain their indestructibility? Because, according to him, these very atoms, being stirred by the Lord's wish at the 

1. Ta. San., T. D., 9. 

ABHÄSAVADA 

213 

time of creation and getting united with one another, form the various objects of the world, through the intervening stages of the binary' and the 'tertiary'. This is what the Vedāntins also imply, when they say that the eternal Brahman is both the material and the operative cause of the world exactly as clay and gold and the potter and the gold smith are of the earthen wares and gold ornaments. 

If we analyse the idea a little further we find that such a change, as is always concomitant with destruction, presupposes the changing thing to be limited and so the existence of something apart from it, something that it becomes. A seed, for instance, changes into a tree and so is destructible, because it is limited in its nature and becomes, what originally it was not, by assimilating with itself what has a separate existence from it. The Highest Reality, according to the Trika, as we have already shown, contains all within. There is nothing apart from it which it can be represented to become. What takes place, when a thing is said to have been manifested, is simply this, that out of the unlimited mass of things, which lies within, it manifests certain things, at will, as separate from itself, much as we do our own ideas at the time of imagination or dream. At all times, i. e. before, after and at the time of manifestation, the Abhāsas are within the Absolute, as the waves are within the sea ; and just as nothing goes out of or comes in the sea in consequence of the rise of waves so there is no substantial loss or gain to the Universal Consciousness because of the manifestation of Abhāsas. Thus, the change, if we so prefer to call it, in the Absolute, according to Abhāsavādin, is simply a different arrangement of the ever existing material, much

214 

CHAPTER II 

as that of atoms, according to the atomists, or, as that of entitative contents of the Brahman as the material cause of the universe, according to the Vedāntins. Therefore, just as the atomists and the Vedāntins maintain the eternality of their ultimate realities inspite of such a change so do the Ābhāsavādins. 

MONISM EXPLAINED. As to the question "how can the Ultimate Reality be said to be one, if it contains within all the Abhāsas ?" the Trika replies that that alone can be said to be truly existent which exists independent of others. As all these Abhāsas shine only on the background of the Absolute, much in the same manner as do the reflections in a mirror, so they cannot be said to have independent existence. And as this common basis of all the knowables is the only being that exists perfectly independent of others, so, this alone can be said to be truly existent (Sat). The system is held to be monistic, because, according to it, the Anuttara alone really exists. The Abhāsas are mere transitory appearances. 

ARE ABHĀSAS REAL ? No language is perfect. We cannot find a conventional expression for each shade of difference in our ideas, in any language. We have to depend upon approximations to convey the idea of subtle differences. We have, therefore, to clearly understand the implication of each word of a question regarding a philosophical problem. In fact, much of the confusion that we find in the writings of the later commentators on the ancient philosophical authorities is due to the fight over words. Let us, therefore, find out what is 

1. I. P. V., 1, 42-3. 

ABHÄSAVĀDA 

215 

meant when the question of reality is raised about Abhāsa, or rather, what do we mean when we ordinarily use the word "real". A thing is ordinarily considered to be real if it bears verification, if the experience of it is uncontradicted. The appearances of a dream are unreal because our experiences of them are contradicted in the wakeful state and much more so is the appearance of silver at the sight of a mother-of-pearl ; for, while the dream silver does not disappear as soon as we approach it and can be used for all practical purposes so long as the dream lasts, the illusory silver does disappear at our approach. Thus, when we use the word "unreal" with regard to the things of the above instances, we do not mean that they are unreal exactly in the sense in which the sky-flower is unreal. What we mean is that they are not as lasting as those of the ordinary wakeful state : we, however, do not deny their existence and their having been the objects of cognition, because to say so would be a self-contradiction. In an illusion or a dream we do see a separate object and our experience also, concerning the sight of the object as such, remains uncontradicted ever afterwards ; for, nobody ever feels that he did not have such an experience. But still, if that object is called unreal it is because of its not conforming to the conventional standard of reality in the wakeful state. 

It may be asked here what is it that we see in an illusion or a dream.? Why does it last for so short a time, and why is its knowledge called erroneous, or rather, where does the error lie ? Leaving aside for the present the explanation of dream, if we take up only the illusion of silver and look at it from the point of view of the Atmākhyātivādin, we get an explanation that it is nothing but a form that the limited self assumes at the sight of a mother-of-pearl because of the sudden and forceful revival of the Vāsanā: it is short lived, like & flash of lightning, because, there is nothing 

216 

CHAPTER II 

behind it to support its existence, as in the case of the illustration of lightning-flash. The mistake lies in considering what is purely subjective to be essentially objective in the ordinary accepted sense of the word. This explains also why the silver of an illusion is not perceptible to all like lightning-flash, though both of them are equally momentary. What we mean to point out is that what is really meant by unreal is not that the thing has no existence, for, if it were not existent nothing would have been seen; but what is meant is that it is an individual subjective manifestation and as such it is of a different kind from the objective one on which all worldly transactions depend, 

We have seen above that the word Abhāsa in this system is used in a very wide sense. It denotes all that appears in any way or form. Therefore, if the word "real" in the above question means "existent", or in other words, if the question is "Have the Abhāsas got existentiality (Sattā) ?" the reply, of the Abhāsavāda would be "Yes". But, on the other hand, if the question is "whether the Abhāsas have subjective or objective existence?", the answer would be that this difference is purely conventional and is assumed for practical purposes; it is, therefore, of the same nature as we feel between the objects of a dream and those of a dream within another dream. It is a matter of common experience that at times, when we are dreaming, we dream a dream, and make exactly the same distinction between the objects of the continuous long dream and those of the shorter one, which ends within the longer, as we do in practical life between the objects of the wakeful and those of the dreaming state. The essential nature of the Abhāsa is the same in both the cases, so that if one is called real the other is also real. In fact, the question, 

1. 

I. P. V., II, 114. 

ABHĀSAVĀDA 

217 

whether an appearance is subjective or objective, is not of much value, because the object of philosophy is not so much to point out the difference between one phenomenon, which is responsible for a certain kind of cognition, and another, as to explain in general why there is this cognitive change at all in the self and what it is that causes such a change. To say that one change is like another or that one cause of change is like another, as the Vedāntins always say that the external world is an illusion like the appearance of silver at the sight of a mother-of-pearl, is to avoid the real philosophical issue. We find that there are things which are external to self, it is another matter whether they are subjective or objective or more lasting or less ; and that they seem to so affect the self as to cause a variety of cognitions. The question, that philosophy has to answer, is, what are these things? How have they come into being and how are they connected with the self which they seem to affect ? This leads us to the treatment of Maheśvara. We have not so far been able to find much about Siva in the available literature. 

MAHEŚVARA. CL .307 *22, lod) 

Maheśvara represents that state of the All-inclusive Universal Self in which, as said above, the Abhāsas have a distinct existence from the Self, though no less within the Self than in the state of unity, exactly as our thoughts have within ourselves at the time when we are about to deliver a thoughtful speech. As such the Universal Self is beginningless and endless, because the universe itself is such. It is omnipotent and perfectly independent in the use of its powers. It contains within all that is entitative' and Glluminable'. It forms the permanent substratum of all 

1. 

T.A., I, 98-9. 

2. I. P. V., I, 32. 

28 

218 

CHAPTER II 

that is objective. The object can have no more existence apart from and independent of the Maheśvara than a reflec tion can from a mirror. I is beyond the limitation of time, place and form. It is a self-shining entity with which all the manifestations are connected exactly as the spreading rays are with a flame. It is perfectly free, because it does not require any prompting from without to set about and accomplish its work. It is perfectly independent of both the external material and the instruments. It is spoken of as "light;' but it is neither the recipient of light from the ordinarily known source, the sun, nor even is identicals with him or any other that can be thought of. It is perfectly independent of them. It is the ultimate source of all the sources of all lights. 

KNOWABILITY OF THE UNIVERSAL CONSCIOUSNESS. 

The Universal Consciousness is purely subjective. Objectivity cannot be attributed to it, because such an attribution presupposes the existence of another knower, as different from and independent of it, and therefore, is in consistent with the original hypothesis of the universality of the Universal Consciousness. Its existence cannot be denied, because the very act of denial presupposes a conscious being and that also similarly, in its turn, the Universal Consciousness to make the relation of the deniability possible. The in dividual selves are mere manifestations of it and their acts of knowledge are wholly dependent upon it. It is this very Universal Self, which sees and knows through the innumer 

1. T. A., I, 98. 2. I. P. V., I. 118. 3. I. P. V., I, 277. 4. I. P. V., I, 29. 5. T. A., I, 95.6 6. I. P. V. 1., 111.ABHĀSAVĀDA 

219 

able bodies and as such is called the individual. It is the very life of the means of right knowledge through which the existence of the external objects as such is established. How can the sword cut itself ? On this point there is perfect agreement between the Trika and the Vedānta. Like Utpalācārya's famous Kārikā: 

"Kartari jñātari svātmanyādisiddhe maheśvare Ajadātmā niședham vā siddhim vā vidadhīta kah." 

1. P. V., I, 29. 

the Vedānta also says: 

"Vijñātāramare kena vijānīyāt." Br. U., 2-5-19. 

THE POWERS OF THE UNIVERSAL CONSCIOUSNESS. 

The Trika conception of power is different from that of the Naiyāyikas. According to the latter, it is a quality which cannot exist without a substratum and, therefore, presupposes a possessor. The knower, therefore, according to them, is different from the power of knowledge. But the former holds that the power is the very being of the possessor. The distinction between them is imaginary. It is just like giving a name to a collocation of a certain number of things and calling each constituent a possession of what is indicated by the said name. Take, for instance, a chair. It is a collocation of a certain number of pieces of wood arranged in a certain way. Each piece is called by a separate name, indicative of its peculiar function, and all these taken together are given a different name "chair". We speak of the leg, the arm and the back of a chair, as if chair had a separate existence from the legs etc. The difference between the Universal Consciousness and its powers is, therefore, according to the Abhāsavādin, not real but purely imaginary and conventional. 

1. T. A., 1, 109. 

220 

CHAPTER II 

Similar is the case with the difference between one power and another. It is assumed because of the variety of its effects. It is of the same kind as is imagined between the fire's power of burning and that of baking. In reality, how ever, all the powers, as we have already pointed out above, which are attributed to Maheśvara, are mere aspects of the one all-inclusive power, the Vimarsa, or the Svātantrya Sakti. 

THE KARTRTVA AND THE TÑĀTRTVA SAKTIS AND THEIR 

FUNCTIONS. The Trika speaks of two kinds of manifestation, the external and the internal. For a clear understanding of the idea of internality and externality of ābhāsas let us suppose that each ābhāsa is constituted by a separate current in the sea of the Universal Self. These currents always flow throughout the state of creation underneath the surface of the sea, and as such represent internal ābhāsas. To bring about their internal separate manifestation and to maintain them in the state of the internal separateness, is the work of Kartrtva Sakti, omnipotence. At times, however, these currents are, for a moment, brought over the surface, as waves, and are put in such a position that that wave, which is capable of receiving reflection, can be affected by those which cast reflections. This is the work of the omniscience or power of knower (jñātrtva sakti) and the affection of that wave which is capable of receiving reflection is the pheno menon of knowledge. 

THE ASPECTS OF THE JNATRTVA SAKTI. 

The Jñātņtva Sakti has the following three aspects : 

1. The power of knowledge Jñāna Sakti) 2. The power of remembrance (Smrti Sakti) and 3. The power of differentiation (Apohana Sakti). 

1.

221 

THE POWER OF KNOWLEDGE. 

The first is that aspect of the power of the Univer sal Consciousness by virtue of which it takes out for sepa rate manifestation only certain things from the unlimited mass which lies merged in it (svarūpād unmagnam ābhāsayati). The difference between the phenomenon of knowledge and the power thereof is, that the former is the eflect and the latter is the cause. 

According to this system, the subject is no less a manifestation than the object and both are momentary collocations of a certain number of abhāsas or manifestations. A phenomenon of knowledge is, therefore, like the rise of two waves in the sea of the Universal Consciousness. One of these has nairmalya, the capacity to receive reflection, and the other is without it. The former is called Jivābhāsa (limited sentient manifestation) and the latter, Jadābhāsa (insentient manifestation). When the rising sentient wave is affected by the insentient which rises simultaneously with the former, as a mirror is by the objects, placed before, the phenomenon of knowledge is said to have taken place. Thus, knowledge is simply the affected sentient wave of consciousness; but the power of knowledge is that capacity of the Universal Consciousness which is responsible for the rise of both the waves necessary for the phenomenon of knowledge. This problem we propose to take up for a detailed discussion in the section, dealing with the Trika theory of perception. 

THE POWER OF REMEMBRANCE, 

But if both the sentient and the insentient ābhāsas are momentary so must be the knowledge also ; and if so, even 

1. I. P. V., 1, 108. 2. I. P. V., I, 215. 

222 

the postulate of the power of knowledge fails to explain the "why" of all the worldly transactions. Our experience tells us that our decision to try to gain or shun an object is reached after a sufficiently elaborate psychological process. The first thing that we do is to place, as it were, the experience of the present object by the side of that of a similar one in the past. Then we compare the two, draw a sort of inference as to the useful or harmful nature of what is present before us and accordingly decide to try to gain or shun it. The knowledge is momentary. It is destroyed in the very next moment after its production, but the comparison of experiences, necessary for motor response, requires its continued existence in some form till the comparison is done. The theory of momentary knowledge, therefore, cannot satisfactorily account for the togetherness of experiences of different times on which all worldly transactions depend. Therefore, in order to explain the psychological phenomenon of the above description, the ābhāsavādins postulate another aspect of the omniscience, 'the power of remembrance'. 

The power of remembrance is that power of the Universal Consciousness by virtue of which it manifests itself in the form of such an individual self as can retain the effects of the external stimuli, received at the time of perception, and is able to revive them at that of a subsequent perception of a similar thing so as to make the unification of the experiences of both the present and the past times possible. The fact is that the sentient wave is like a momentary wave of light emanating from a permanent source. It is this source that retains in a sub-conscious state the idea of having sent out a wave towards a certain object and that of having received a stimulus of a certain 

1. I. P. V., 1, 109. 

ABHĀSAVĀDA 

223 

kind therefrom. The point in question will become clear if in this case also, as we did in that of knowledge, we draw a distinction between the power and the phenomenon of remembrance. The former is that power which is the cause of such a limited perceiver as is the immediate permanent source of the emanating sentient wave and the latter is the effect thereof?. We take up the problem of remembrance for an exhaustive treatment in the 4th chapter. 

APOHANA SAKTI 

or 

THE POWER OF DIFFERENTIATION. 

It has been stated above that all that is, i. e., all that can be said to exist in any way or form, is within the Universal Self. For, consistently with the idea of its perfection we cannot admit the existence of any thing out side it. But both the psychic phenomena, the perception and the remembrance, presuppose the existence of both the cognisor and the cognised not only as separate from the Universal Self but also as separate) from each other. In fact, in our daily life we do not feel, as described above, that the subject and the object are like waves On the contrary our experience is that they have independent and mutually exclusive existence. The Trika accounts for this fact by postulating the third aspect of the omniscience, the Apohana Sakti. It is that aspect of the omniscience which manifests each ābhāsa, whether subjective (jīva) or objective (jada), as apparently completely cut off both from the Universal Consciousness and from one another, though in reality even at the time of such a manifestation they are one with their common substratum. Thus, it is that

224 

CHAPTER II 

power which is the cause of all the determinate knowledge of the limited self. This Trika concept of the Universal Consciousness as the cause of all the psychological phenomena is in complete accord with the one, contained in the following line of the Bhagavadgītā, 

"Mattah smrtirjñānamapohanafica." 

Bh. G., XV, 15. 

KARTRTVA SAKTI. 

It may be stated at the very outset that the word Kartrtva sakti is used in more than one sense. It is used in the sense of the creative power or power of manifestation in general: as such it means the same thing as Svātantrya sakti. Therefore, if we take Kartrtva sakti in this wider sense the omniscience or jñātrtva sakti will be simply an aspect of it. Abhinava has made this point very clear in the following words : 

“Sa cāyam svatantrah......... 

........tadevāsya pārameśvaryam mukhyamānandamayam rūpam iti pūrvamupāttar 'kartari' iti. Tadeva svātantryam vibhajya vakturh 'jñatari' iti paścānnirdiştam" 

I. P. V., I, 31-2. 

It is also used to denote that aspect of the Svātantrya sakti which is responsible for the innumerable varieties of the internal limited manifestation. These varieties, as the Jñātrtva sakti reveals them, are manifested in two ways, viz., (1) by a simultaneous manifestation of many forms, each of which is substantially different and apparently separate from the rest, for instance, when we see a beautiful landscape with all its trees and creepers ; and (II) by successive manifestation of a large number of forms which so resemble one another that they are recognised to be the various forms of the same thing, as when we see a fawn 

ÄBHÄSAVĀDA 

225 

frisking about. The former is called? Deśakramābhāsa due to Mürtivaicitrya and the latter Kālakramābhāsa caused by Kriyāvaicitrya. Thus "Kartstva Śakti" in its limited sense, the sense in which we are using the expression here, means that aspect of the Svātantrya sakti which is responsible for the innumerable varieties of the internal limited manifesta tion. It has two aspects, the Kriyā sakti and the Kāla sakti, 

KRIYĂ SAKTI. Kriyā or action, according to this system, is nothing but an appearance of a long series of closely similar physical forms in so quick a succession as to produce a persistence of vision. Let us take, for instance, the hero of a drama represented in a cinematographic film, and suppose that we are seeing that part of the film in which he is represented alone in a solitary place in a fit of anger, tearing his hair, grinding his teeth, rushing forward with a jerk, stopping suddenly and looking round wildly. At such a sight we use different expressions "tearing" etc., expressive of different kinds of the so called action, with reference to the hero. But let us ask why?" Is it not simply because of the appearance of a series of pictures, each of which, though different from the rest of the series, has yet enough common element to be identified with both the preceding and the the following; and does not each one of the expressions expressive of an action stand for the established convention which calls a certain number of similar successive pictures by one word ? For instance, when we say "the hero is rushing", does not the word "rushing" denote a set of pictures beginning with the one that represents the hero's first movement to raise one of his feet : and do we not use that word simply because of production of persistence of 

1. I. P. V., II, 13. 

29 

2. I. P. V., II, 14. 

226 

CHAPTER II 

vision and consequent consciousness that the same figure is doing all the movements indicated by the particular word ? 

To make the idea clear let us state here briefly that, just like the Bauddha, the Trika also holds that the Abhāsas are momentary and that the apparent continuity of a thing is due to the proportionately long series of similar ābhāsas, which follow one another in so quick a succession that we think that the same is having continuous existence. In the case of the fame of an oil lamp, for instance, the flame, as the scientists tell us, is changing every moment. But as the old flame disappears the fresh energy comes in its place and is transformed into a new one with such quickness that we feel that the same flame is having continuous existence. The Trika, therefore, holds that an action is noting but an appearance of the Universal Consciousness in those multi farious forms, a group of which is conventionally referred to by a single expression, much as the word "running" in the above illustration of the cinematographic film, is used for a large number of pictures beginning with the one showing the first attempt at lifting of the foot and ending with that which immediately precedes the first of the next group to be expressed by a similar word. 

To make the point a little clearer let us take, for ins tance, a dream in which we see a person running and try to explain it psychologically. We know that a dream is nothing but a certain arrangement of the residual traces (samskāras) now revived owing to some unknown cause. Now the question is "does the running man of the dream represent one revived impression or more ?" The natural answer to this is "more" i. e. as many as there are pictures required to represent this movement in a cinema-show. According to the Trika, the universe is simply a manifestation of the 

ABHĀSAVĀDA 

227 

Universal Consciousness very much similar to the individual manifestation of dream or the common lasting creation of a Yogin. Therefore, just as a running person is represented by a series of revived impressions in a dream and by a series of pictures in a cinema show, so in ordinary worldly life each activity is represented by a series of ābhāsas. Kriya sakti, therefore, is that aspect of the Kartrtva sakti, which is responsible for such internal ābhāsas as, being externally manifested by the power of knowledge (jñāna sakti) give rise to the idea of action. These ābhāsas are connected or disconnected with one another exactly as are the mental impressions in the case of a dream or the various pictures in the case of a cinema show. This very power is responsible for such manifestations also as give rise to concepts of conjunction (Sambandha), generality (Sāmānya), place (deśa), space (Dik) and time etc.4 

KĀLA SAKTI. 

Kāla sakti is another aspect of the Kartstva sakti, which is responsible for the manifestation of each constituent of the series of ābhāsas, on which the concept of action is based, as cut off from the rest, exactly as the Apohana aspect of the Jñātrtva sakti manifests each constituent of the block of images formed on the mirror of Buddhi as separate from the rest. 

We may add here that the Universal Consciousness with the powers described in the foregoing pages is called Mahe śvara on the analogy of a king. A person is called Isa, Isvara or lord because of his having control over a part of 

1. I. P. V., II, 174-5. 2. I. P. V., II, 12. 3. I. P. V., II, 24. 4. I. P. V., II, 42. 

228 

CHAPTER III the world. The Universal Consciousness is called Maheśvara because it controls, in every way, not only all that we can conceive but also all that which is beyond the conception of our limited power. 

1. I. P. V., 1, 44.CHAPTER III. THE CATEGORIES OF THE ABHĀSAVĀDA. 

In the preceding chapter we have dealt with the Abhāsavādin's concept of the Universal Consciousness as the manifestor. In this chapter, therefore, we propose to give & brief exposition of the Manifested. 

The Abhāsavāda divides the manifested into thirtysix categories. This division, as Abhinava very clearly states, is based, neither wholly on the scientific observation, nor purely or exclusively on the logical inference. The authority of the Agamas? is its sole basis. This, however, does not mean that it has no support of the facts of experience and that it is simply a matter of belief. It means only this that it is not within the reach of the ordinary means of perceptional or inferential knowledge to fully reveal the essential nature and the full implication of each one of the tattvas. It does not deny that it is a result partly of long intuitive (yogic) experiments and partly of a careful study of mind and matter. 

Of the thirty-six categories twenty-five i. e., from the puruşa to the earth are taken from the Sankhya, with some slight modifications in some cases, as we shall point out, while dealing with them separately ; and one, namely, the māyā, is adopted from the Vedānta. The remaining ten are common to both the dualistic and the nondualistic schools of the Saivāgama. Of these ten, which represent the first ten of the thirty-six categories, the first five represent five powers or to be more accurate, five aspects of the Ultimate Reality. The remaining five, which are placed between the 

1. I. P. V., II, 186. 

230 

CHAPTER III 

māyā and the purusa in the order of manifestation, represent the limitations of an individual self. 

These tattvas can be classed as pure or impure, accord ing as they belong to the pure or the impure creation. The first five are said to belong to the pure creation inasmuch as they are manifested by the Siva himself by the sheer force of his will, independently of any prompting cause, like karma, or material cause, like māyā). The rest, i. e., from the kala to the earth, are created by Aghora or Ananta, with the help of māyā. This is called impure creation because it is of limited nature. It is controlled by the law of karma, because its purpose is to supply the necessary stimuli for the varying experiences of the countless souls, the experiences which these souls must undergo according to their karmas. These categories can also broadly be divided into two groups, the self-luminous, consisting of the sentient categories constituted by various kinds of subject (Pramātr), and the illuminable, 

consisting of the insentient categories such as the earth etc. 

The categories are mere manifestations of the Ultimate, and as such are essentially the same as their source, and so are all the knowables, because they are mere collocations of some of the tattvas. A collocation is said to belong to one category or another, according as a particular tattva forms its basis by being the chief constituent of it. A jar, for instance, is said to be earthy, not because it is exclusively made up of earth, but because earth is its chief constituent. 

PRALAYA AND MAHĀPRALAYA. 

The universal dissolution (pralaya) is of two kinds, the 'small and the 'great'. In the former .every thing gets dissolved into its primordial substances and qualities. It is a state in which, according to the Sānkhya, the qualities 

1. T. A., VI, 55. 

THE CATEGORIES OF THE ABHÄSAVÅDA 

231 

(guņas), namely, sattva, rajas and tamas, are in a state of perfect equality; and, according to the Vaišeşika, every thing is reduced to atoms. The individual souls in this state are, as it were, in a deep sleep, though still in the bondage of their past individual karmas. Such a dissolution is referred to by the word "Pralaya". 

We have not so far discovered any thing which might give us the Trika idea of the condition of the tattvas in the state of small dissolution". There is, however, the following statement in the Tantrāloka : 

"īśvarecchāvasa kşubdha bhoga lolika cidganān 

Samvibhanktum aghoreśah srjatīha sitetaram" which shows that in regard to the condition of the individual there is a complete agreement between the Sānkhya and the Vaiseșika on the one hand and the Trika on the other. The Trika view, however, on the mahāpralaya is sufficiently clear in the existing literature. According to the available information, it is a state of perfect annihilation of all that is manifested. In this state the collocations and their consti tuents, the tattvas, suffer the same fate, and the individual selves, their bondages, āņava, kārma and māyīya, having been snapped, lose their individuality and are completely merged in the Universal Self, the Ultimate Reality. The Trika believes in both kinds of dissolution. How this belief does not conflict with the theory of karma, and, how creation of all kinds of limited selves does not make the Parama Siva cruel or partial, we shall explain in the course of our treatment of the theory of Karma in the fifth chapter. 

The creation of the physical universe is not wanton but purposeful. It is meant for supplying the necessary stimuli for varying experiences which the innumerable souls must enjoy or suffer according to their individual karmas. Hence it presupposes karma as its prompting cause. At the 

232 

CHAPTER III 

time of "pralaya" the souls with their individual karmas, are, as it were, in a state of deep sleep. Therefore, when theyə wake up from the sleep of pralaya, the prompting cause, the karma, being there, the creation can begin. The case with the mahāpralaya, however, is different. In that the individual souls are not merely in deep sleep. On the contrary, they then completely lose their individuality and are perfectly one with the Ultimate. Their waking up, as after pralaya, is, therefore, out of question. The prompting cause being absent, how can the creation take place ? 1t is because of this that the Naiyāyikas and the Vedāntins? etc. do not admit the Mahapralaya. 

The Trika, however, believes in the Mahāpralaya and reconciles this belief with its theory of dependence of the creation of the physical universe on the karmas of the individual selves by attributing a wider meaning to the word "karma" than that in which it is ordinarily used. In the non-Trika literature it means a certain effect that is produced on the limited self by the personal conviction of the potentiality of a particular action to lead to a certain ex perience at the time of maturation. But in the Trika literature it is used in another sense also, namely, the limited objectless desire, which, according to this system, arises in a newly manifested limited self, just before the creation of a new physical world which follows a mahā. pralaya. This desire is without any objective reference, because it precedes the creation of object. It may, therefore, be spoken of as a mere eagerness on the part of the limited self to use its limited power. When the distinction of one from the other is tried to be emphasised, the former is referred to as "karmasaṁskāra" and the latter as "kārmamala". Ordinarily, however, the simple word "karma" is used for both. 

1. 

V. S. S. Bh., 407, 

THE CATEGORIES OF THE ĀBHĀSAVĀDA 

233 

To make the point clear let us add here that, according to this system, the creation, maintenance and destruction are governed by the law of karma ; but the obscuration and the grace (tirodhāna and anugraha) depend entirely upon the will of the Lord. The obscuration is nothing else than the Lord's appearing in the form of the innumerable limited selves whose limitedness consists in their ignorance of their identity with the Universal Self, in mere consciousness of imperfection and in consequent limitation of their powers of knowledge and action. This limitation is technically called ānavamala. The powers of knowledge and action being limited, limitation in desire naturally follows. The above described assumption of the multifarious forms by the Universal Self precedes the new creation of the physical universe after a mahāpralaya. The desire, therefore, that arises in the limited self, is naturally without objective reference. It is a mere eagerness to use the powers of knowledge and action, and as they are limited so the desire also has naturally to be so. This desire is called kārmamala. 

Therefore, when the Trika says that the karma is the prompting cause in the creation of the physical universe which follows mahāpralaya, by the word "karma" it means kārmamala. For, how can there be any karmasa īskāra before that creation which comes after a total universal dissolution (mahāpralayānantarā srsti) in which the souls having been made free from all kinds of bondages and limitations become one with the Universal Self? Thus, according to the Trika, the grace is responsible for the total universal dissolution and the obscuration for the ordered creation that follows mahāpralaya. The power of obscuration, comes into play after a mahāpralaya only, to supply the prompting cause for the new creation to proceed, 

30 

234 

CHAPTER III 

In the case of the physical creation which follows pralaya, the prompting cause in the form of karma, as associated with the innumerable individual selves, being already there, the use of the power of obscuration is unnecessary. Both, the Mahāpralaya and the creation that follows, are, therefore, not possible, according to those systems which hold the karma to be merely karmasamskāra, and do not believe in the two independent functions of the Maheśvara, the obscuration and the grace. For, according to them, one of the most essential antecedent conditions of the creation is the karmasaņskāra, as the prompting cause. Therefore, if there be Mahāpralaya, i. e. if all were to completely merge in the Ultimate, if the individual souls were to lose their individuality and were to become free from karma, there being no prompting cause, the fresh creation would not take place. The Trika theory of karma receives more detailed treatment in the fifth chapter 

TATTVA DEFINED. 

A Tattva is that which lasts through the 'small dissolution of the universe and is always present in its effects, in its collocations, or in the beings marked by certain characteristics peculiar to itself. It is pervasive in so far as it forms the basis of all the collocations belonging to that creation of which it is the chief constituent. This world, in which we live, move and have our being, is called earthly (pārthiva) not because it is made up of earth alone, but because earth is its chief constituent. The definition, however, seems to be a little complicated. It is not equally applicable in all its parts to all the tattvas. For, though all are pervasive in the above sense, yet because of the. difference in the essential nature of certain groups of the tattvas from others and so of the things belonging to them, 

1. T. A.,, VI, 3. 

THE CATEGORIES OF THE ĀBHĀSAVĀDA 

235 

there is difference in the manner of pervasion. The earth, for instance, pervades what is earthly, as a material cause does its effects. Similarly the prakerti pervades its evolutes, according to the Sāukhya terminology, as qualities do their collocations, and the sentient tattvas, from puruşa to Siva, pervade those which have common characteristics with them, as a genus does the individual things. It is this fact which the words "the effect," "the collocation" and "the beings with common characteristics" are meant to indicate, as the following quotation shows: 

"Svasmin kāryetha dharmaughe 

Yadvāpi sva sadrg gune Aste sāmānya kalpena Tananād vyāptr bhāvatah Tattattvam kramaśah prthvi Pradhānam pum śivādayah." 

T. A., VI, 4-5. 

THE ORDER OF MANIFESTATION OF THE PURE CREATION 

The pure creation is & supersensuous creation. Just as the Naiyāyikas believe in the earthly, the watery, the airy, the fiery and the etherial beings and classify them according as any one of the five elements is the chief constituent of their bodies, so the Trika believes in five kinds of the super-sensuous and super-natural beings, who are in no way connected with body, senses, vital airs, intellect or mind, and classifies them as Sambhava Saktija, Mantra maheśvara, Mantreśvara, and Mantra, according as any one of the five powers of the Universal Self (Parama Siva), being (Cit), consciousness (ānand), will iccha), knowledge (jñāna) and action (kriya) predominates in them. The predominance of any one of these powers, 2 in the 

1. T. A., VI, 52. 2. T. A., VI, 49. 

236 

CHAPTER III 

absence of all connections with the material world, results only in a certain state of consciousness or an affection of the purity of self. These states very closely correspond to the successive states through which a person rises to the ordinary consciousness of the wakeful state from that of perfect senselessness, in which even breathing stops. These states can also be spoken of as similar to those, through which a yogin descends from the transcendental state 

(Turīyāvastha) to that of the ordinary worldly experience. 

Leaving aside, for the present, the consideration of purely super-sensuous spiritual states, if we analyse the psychological movements which precede an ordinary action of daily occurrence we come to the following two conclusions : (I) that an individual, who is, after all, only an epitome of the Universal Self, possesses all the five powers attributed to the latter, and (II) that, in the former's activity, these powers, because of the dependence of each of the following, in the above order on what immediately precedes, necessarily come into play in the same order in which they are supposed to be manifested in the pure creation Imagine, for instance, an artist, sitting bent over his canvas. At one time he picks up a brush, dips it in a paint and takes it so near the canvas that an on-looker feels sure that he would give some artistic strokes to it: but suddenly he stops his hand, thinks a little, and then places the brush back again in its place. What is it that controls his activity? Is it not an idea or mental image, which he is trying to produce, or rather, reproduce on the canvas, that does so ? And what is this idea after all? Is it not an affection of the self ? If it is, will it be wrong to call it knowledge ? If not, does it not prove that the production of a new thing presupposes its knowledge which controls the productive activity ? 

THE CATEGORIES OF THE ABHÄSAVĀDA 

237 

Now the next thing to be found out is as to why does a particular idea control at a particular time, or rather, why does a particular idea arise at a certain time to the exclusion of all the rest ? Is it not because of the artist's will? Is it not the power of will that gives rise to and maintains a certain idea for a certain time? Has it not often been found that, when the control of the will weakens, other ideas rush in and spoil the work ? Does it not often happen that after a long sitting without any appreciable progress in the work, when he loses his patience, he spoils his own work by giving some random strokes and then in sheer disgust, as if in a fit of madness, tears his canvas to pieces? Let it, however, be remembered that even these random strokes and the tearing of the canvas are not without a precedent idea for so doing ; nor is the idea without the prompting of the will. For, before these acts of madness are done, this will, often finds expression in such words as "It is a hopeless task." 

The invariable precedence of will to knowledge is thus undeniable." But is this will absolutely independent ? Can all the created will ? Or, can any limited creation always will ? If not, why? A log of wood can never will nor can a person in an utterly senseless condition. The will, there fore, apparently presupposes and depends upon consciousness. 

This consciousness is inseparably connected with the being', as the power of germination is with a seed. This being represents the ego, the entity, for which the word "self" stands in self-consciousness" or the word "aham" in Kaham asmi". 

Thus a careful study of microcosm proves that both, the attribution of the five powers to Parama Siva, the manifestor, and the order of their manifestation, as conceived 

1. T. A., VI, 48. 

238 

CHAPTER III 

by the Trika, are based on the facts of experience and are not matters of purely religious belief. 

The conception of these powers or aspects of the Universal Self and their coming into play in the same order as shown above, is not altogether foreign to the Upanişad literature. For instance, compare the following : 

"Sadeva saumyedam agra āsīd ekam evādvitīyam...... ...tadaikşata, bahu syām, prajāyeya, iti, tattejo asrjata." 

- Ch. D. 6, 2, 1-3. This passage is quoted by Sankara to point out the distinction between the insentient creator, the Pradhana of the Sārkhya, and the sentient creator, the Brahman of the Vedānta. While discussing this passage, Saükara admits that the 

being" (sat) aspect is common to both, the Pradhāna and the Brahman, but it is the consciousness (īksatikarma) that constitutes the point of difference between them and that being" precedes "consciousness." 

But Sankara's object in quoting and discussing the passage in question was simply to interpret the text of Bādarāyaṇa and to refute the Sāükhya theory of creation. He has, therefore, not discussed other points connected with the remaining two clauses. A careful study of the passage as a whole, however, shows that the Upanişad states all the five aspects of the Universal Self in which the Trika believes, and that there is perfect agreement between the two in regard to the order of their manifestation. Even Sankara admits that the being' is the first and the action is the last of the five aspects and that consciousness follows being. We have, therefore, got to consider only the remaining two, indicated by the two clauses "banu syām" and "prajāyeya' (may I be many, may I grow forth). It will be apparent even to a superficial reader that they express desire ; for,THE CATEGORIES OF THE ABHĀSAVĀDA S239 

the finite verbs of both the clauses are put in the potential mood. But the question is as to whether there is any distinctive implication of each of the two. In our humble opinion the first simply states the rise of will (desire) to become many, but the second the rise of an idea which controls the activity whereby the desire is to be realised, exactly as the mental image in the case of an artist, described in a preceding paragraph, controls his productive activities. One can become many in at least two ways, by dividing one's self into many, as a flame does into rays, or by growing itself into many, as a seed does through successive stages. The control of the idea of growth over the activity wherewith the desire to become many is realised consists in its directing the activity of the Universal Self into the channel of creation as opposed to that of self-division. It would, therefore, not be wrong to say that "prajāyeya" indicates the rise of the controlling idea (knowledge) precedent to the act of creation. Thus the Vedānta and the Trika appear to agree on the number, the nature and the order of manifestation of the five aspects of the Universal Self, 

SIVA TATTVA. Like the Sankhya, which believes that in every evolute of the prakrti all the three qualities are present and that the distinction of one evolute from another depends upon the difference in the proportion of the constituent qualities of an individual evolute, the Trika also holds that in every manifestation of the pure creation all the five powers of the Universal Self are essentially present and that the difference of one manifestation from another is due to the predominance of one of the powers in a particular manifestation. Siva tattva is the first manifestation and the power of being" (Cit) predominates in it. It is purely subjective, and has no objective or predicative reference. It is free not only 

240 

CHAPTER III 

atit 

Cerim 

from the impurities of karma and māyā but also from that impurity which is technically called anavamala. The experience of this state, if the use of such a word be permissible, is pure "I". This experience may be compared to that of nirvikalpa-samādhi. It is wrong to use even such a predicate as sam" in reference to it; because "am" also implies some kind of relation of identity, which presupposes both the self-consciousness and the consciousness, howsoever vague or indefinite, of something apart from the self. Both the self-consciousness and the object are, however, later manifestations. How can, therefore, any talk of them in reference to Siva be justifiable? It may be said to represent that entity the idea of which is conveyed by the word "self" in the compound "self-consciousness", when it is not used to refer to body, vital air, mind 

or Buddhi. 

SAKTI. The next category, the manifestation of which follows that of the Siva, is the Sakti. This can scarcely be called the second tattva. Its manifestation takes place almost simultaneously with the first, for, unless there be consciousness of what is manifested how can it be said to have been manifested at all? It is, however, spoken of as the second, because the consciousness presupposes the "being" as the rays do a flame. Just as there can be no rays without a flame so there can be no consciousness without being". But still just as in the succesive manifestations of the light energy, flame undeniably precedes the rays, so, in those of the Universal Self, being” precedes consciousness. Though the experience of the beings belonging to this state, like that of the preceding, is without any objective reference, yet it is not altogether without predicative reference. The experience 

1. I. P. V., I, 1. 

THE CATEGORIES OF THE ABHĀSAVĀDA 

241 

of the Saktijas is marked by the additional element of Wam" to the "I" as "I am" In this the Ananda Sakti 

predominates. 

SADĀŠIVA. This is the third category and the power of will predominates in it. The will, as our experience tells us, is not altogether without any objective reference, nor is its object so distinct as that of knowledge. W) This tattva, therefore, represents a very faintly affected state of the Self. It is a transitional stage between the unaffected state of the Siva and the Sakti and the distinctly affected state of the Isvara tattva. The affection of the Universal Self at this stage may be compared to that of the limited self of an artist when the desire to produce a master-piece first arises within him. It may also be compared to the extre mely faint outline of an intended artistic production on a canvas. 

The experience of the beings of this tattva may be represented as "I am this". It has, however, to be remem bered that the "this" which represents the universe, the cause of affection, is so indistinct that it can be said to affect the universal beings of this tattva as little as a picture does a canvas when it is represented by extremely faint outlining dots only. 

The experiencing entities belonging to this category are called Mantramaheśas. They are universal beings and because they are not perfectly free from the impurity, called āņavamala, their experience, therefore, is not without any objective reference. The object, however, is not of limited nature as in the case of the ordinary mortals. The whole universe constitutes their object and is conceived by them as identical with themselves (sarvasya avyatirekeņa, I. P. V., I. 36). 

1. I. P.IV., II, 192-3. 

31 

242 

CHAPTER III 

IŠVARA TATTVA. This is the fourth category. The power of knowledge predominates in it. It is marked by the rise into prominence of the "this" element of the Universal Self which had but very faintly begun affecting the Self in the Sadāśiva state. It is but natural, that the objective element should predomi nate in it, because knowledge is nothing but an affection of the self due to internal or external causes, and the distinction of the state of volition from that of knowledge is only this that the affection of the self in the former case is very faint but in the latter it is so very clear that the element of the self which predominates in the former case is thrown into the back-ground in the latter. The difference between these two states of the Universal Self may be compared to those of a canvas; the former to the one in which the intended picture is faintly outlined in hardly perceptible dots; and the latter to the other in which the picture is fully drawn and the canvas is thrown so much in the back ground that ordinary people instead of calling it canvas call it picture. 

The idea of the predominance of the objective element in the experience of the Isvara state is conveyed in the Trika literature by giving the first position not to "I" as in the case of the experience of the Sadasiva state "I am this" but to "this" as "this I am". It is perhaps to imply the idea of predominance of the objective element that this category is called "iśvara tattva", because lordliness of a lord consists in his holding what constitutes his lordliness, to be more important than his self. 

SADVIDYA. It is the fifth category and is marked by the predomi Dance of the power of action. In this the objective element 

1. I. P. V., II, 191. 

THE CATEGORIES OF THE ABHÄSAVÄDA 

243 

is neither so obscure as in the Sadasiva nor so predominant as in the Isvara, but it is, like the two pans of an evenly held balance, (samadhrta tulā puta nyāyena), in a state of perfect (1) equality with the subjective. The experience of this state may be expressed as "I am this". 

The Sadvidyā tattva is a distinct tattva from the Vidyā tattva, which represents one of the limited powers of a limited self. Although the experience of the Universal Self in the state of the Sadvidyā is to be expressed in the same words “I am this" as those required to state that of a limited individual self under the influence of the vidyā, yet the implication in each case is fundamentally different. In the former, both, "I" and "this", refer to the same thing i. e. both have sāmānādhikaranya; there is no consciousness of the subject as quite distinct from that of the object; but in the latter case "I” refers to the limited subject and this" to the limited object 

The order, in which the Tattvas of the pure creation are given here, represents the one in which they rise from the Universal Self. The order of merging of these tattvas back into the Universal Self, is the reverse of it. The self recognition (ātma pratyabhijñāna) is nothing but merging of individual self in the universal. It is, therefore, held by the Trika that an individual self, in order that it may get com pletely merged in the Universal Selfs, has to pass through the successive states represented by the universal beings belonging to the (I) sadvidyā, (II) īśvara, (IIIsadāśiva and (IV) siva-sakti tattvas, which are classed as (I) mantra, (II) mantreśa, (III) mantramaheśa, and (IV) siva. The chief 

1. I. P. V., II, 196. 2. I. P. V., II, 196-7. 3. T. A., VI, 78. 

244 

CHAPTER III 

point of distinction of one class from another is constituted by the association of each with one of the four states of āņavamala in the course of its destruction i. e. (I) kincit dhvasyamāna, (II) dhvasyamāna. (III) kinciddhvasta, and (IV) dhvasta, respectively. 

In the above manifestations of the Universal Self the objective universe is purely ideal and is realised as it is in reality. Their experier cing entities realise themselves as universal beings, which they really are, and their experiences also are free from all kinds of limitation. They, therefore, represent the sphere of true knowledge and are spoken of as pure creation which is characterised by freedom from limitation as opposed to the impure which is the work of the Māyā and as such is distinctively limited. 

MĀYA. We have just pointed out the distinction of the ex perience of the beings belonging to the Sadvidyā from that of a limited individual under the influence of the Vidyā. In the former case "I" and "this" refer to the same entity, but in the latter to two separate things, i. e. in the former case the subject and the object are identical but in the latter they are different. In the former the idea of unity predominates, but in the latter that of duality or plurality preponderates. This may be considered to be a typical point of distinction between the pure and the impure creations. The first manifestation of the impure creation is Māyā. It is this Tattva, the manifestation of which, first of all, apparently breaks the unity of the Universal Self. It is the most distinctive power of the Universal Self in its creative aspect. It manifests diversity independently of any external helper or prompter. It is conceived both as 

1. T. A., VI, 80-1. 2. T. A., VI, 116. 

THE CATEGORIES OF THE ABHÄSAVĀDA 

- 245 

the power of obscuration and as the primary cause of all the limited manifestations. In its former aspect it is often referred to as "Moha"! and in the latter as "parānisa" 2. Its effect also, by transference of epithet, (upacāra) is spoken of as "māyā". As such, Māyā is limited; for, whatever is manifested as apparently separate from the Universal Self is essentially so. It is pervasive, because it is the cause of the universe. It is subtle, because it passes ordinary comprehen sion. As an aspect of the Universal Self it is eternals. 

The impure creation consists of two kinds of limited manifestations, the sentient and the insentient. The māyā, as the force of obscuration, is responsible for the appearance of the one Universal Self as innumerable individual selves, whose distinguishing feature is the ignorance of their real nature (svarūpākhyāti) and consequent imperfection of their powers of knowledge and action : 

“Mohayati anena sakti višeșeņa iti moho māyā saktih tasyāḥ vaśah sāmarthyam mohana kāryam prati avirāmah yathoktam "Māyā vimohinī nāma'..........". 

I. P. V., I, 35. But Māyā Tattva as the primary cause of all the insentient limited manifestations i. e. as parāniśā, contains all the manifestables within : 

"Kāryam cāsyām sadevahi kalādi dharaṇī prāntam" 

T. A., VIII, 4. Its manifestative activities are controlled by the Maheśvara's will. 

The supposition of Māyā as a principle of obscuration is both necessary and logical. For, if the Ultimate Reality is possessed of all the five powers, cit, ānanda, icchā, 

1. I. P. V., I, 35. 2. T. A., VI, 116. 3. T. A., VI, 117. 

246 

CHAPTER III 

jñāna and kriyā, and so is perfect in every way, and the universe is identical with it, it has to be explained: where does the plurality of selves with all their limitations come from ; and what is the cause of the limited creation which forms the object of experience of the limited beings ? To account for these facts, or rather, to answer these questions it is that the māyā is supposed to be the force of obscuration. As such, Māyā Tattva hides the true nature of the Self so that not only all its five powers are obscured but the universe also, which was in relation of identity with it, disappears. Thus there arises the occasion for the other aspect of māyā, viz, as the cause of the limited universe, to come into play and produce the limited universe in all its parts almost simultaneously much as emblic myrobalan (āmalaki), being forcefully struck with a staff, lets fall its fruits. Different authorities, however, have differently fixed the order of precedence and succession of the manifestations of māyā and have accordingly represented them to be related by the relation of cause and effect to one another. Abhinava follows the authority of the Mālini Vijaya Tantra in his statement of the order of manifestation of the things belonging to the limited creation”. 

KALĀ. This is the first product of māyā. The obscuration by ināyā of the Universal Self leads to the affection of the latter by the impurity, called āņavamala, in an innumerable variety of forms and so to the appearance of the Universal Self in the form of multifarious limited selves. 

“Māyā svīkāra pāratantryāt sarvajñatva sarvakatrt vamayopi bodhah sarvajñatvādi guṇāpahastanena akhyāti rūpam anavam malam īpannah yena 1. T. A., VI, 128. 2. T. A., VI, 129. 

THE CATEGORIES OF THE ĀBHĀSAVĀDA 

247 

ghatākāśavat pārņa rūpāt cidākāśāt avacchedya parimitīkştah san tadeva puṁstvam ucyate." 

P. S., Comm. 45-6. Kalā, therefore, is that Tattva, which, being associated with the self, whose powers of knowledge and action have been obscured, partly restores? to it the power of action. It is related to a limited self not as an instrument to an agent, as the vidyā and other limited powers are, but as its causal agent. It is the knowledge of this tattva, and not of the prakrti as distinct from the Puruşa, that brings about the freedom from the bondage of karma and places an individual in the higher category of beings, called the Vijñānākala, who are beyond the sphere of Māyā). The knowledge of the distinction between prakrti and puruşa, as got through following the teachings of the Sānkhya, saves a soul only from going lower than the pradhāna". The kalā is admitted to be an independent Tattva because of its independent function of bringing limited power of action to a subject, a function which is quite distinct from, nay, opposite to that of obscuration which is the characteristic function of the māyā. 

But here it may be objected that action, in order that it may lead to a tangible result, presupposes knowledge of the object which is intended to be accomplished and towards which the agent's activity has to be directed. The power of knowledge having been obscured by the obscuring māyā, how can the limited power of action, restored to the limited self by the kalā, function? The Trika, therefore, believes in another tattva. 

1. T. A., VI, 136. 2. T. A., VI, 142. 3. T. A., VI, 143. 4. T. A., VI, 144-5. 

248 

CHAPTER III 

VIDYĀ. It is a tattva the association of which with the subject brings to the latter a limited power of knowledge. This may, more correctly, be spoken of as the power of discrimi nation, because its distinctive function is to know the various objects, reflected on the Buddhi, as distinct from one another. The assumption of the vidyā as a different tattva from the Buddhi is necessary; for, although the latter, being predominantly made up of sattva, can receive reflection, yet, being simply a product of guņas and, therefore, insentient, it cannot know either itself or that which is reflected on it. - Another question may be raised here, namely, that if the limited powers of knowledge and action are common to all the subjects, what is it that is responsible for the choice by each individual of different objects of his respective activities? The Trika postulates the following tattva to answer this question. 

RĀGA. Rāga (attachment ?) is that power which is responsible for an individual's choice of a certain thing as an object of a particular activity, to the exclusion of all the rest that he knows. It is not a mere absence of indifference (avairāgya) which is conceived to be a quality of the buddhi by the Sankhya. It is rather that power which is responsible for the indifference (vairāgya) itself. What is vairāgya after all ? Is it not indifference ? And as such has it not got an object of its own ? How then can it take place without the assistance of the Rāga as conceived by the Trika ? 

KĀLA. The Kāla tattva (time) forms another limiting condition of the limited self. 

1. T. A., VI, 151-2. 2. T. A. VI, 157THE CATEGORIES OF THE ABHÄSAVĀDA 

249 

NIYATI. 

It is that power which limits the causal efficiency of every thing. It is because of this that fire only burns and the sesame sprout comes out of the sesame seed only. This also is one of the limiting conditions of an individual, because he is controlled in his activities by this power1. 

The last mentioned four, vidyā, rāga, kāla and niyati are the effects of kalā tattvaa. 

PURUŞA. 

We have stated above how the Universal Self under the influence of its power, called māyā, assumes the innumerable forms of limited selves whose limitation consists in ignorance of their essential nature and consequent deprivation of the powers of knowledge and action. Such a sentient limited manifestation, when possessed of the five attributes kalā etc., is spoken of as puruşa. The above five attributes together with māyā, which is the cause of self-forgetfulness, as it were, of the Self, are at times spoken of as six covers. The deprivation of the Self of its powers of knowledge and action consequent upon the obscuration of its real nature is spoken of as "āņavamala". And the objectless desire to use the limited powers is called "kārma mala" to which its future associations with insentient objects are due. The puruşa, therefore, is often described briefly as the Self affected by two impurities, the anava and the kārma malas, but free from the third, the māyīya mala. It represents purely the subjective element in the midst of the body, the senses, the vital airs, the mind and the Buddhi. It constitutes the 25th category. It is often referred to

1. 3. 

T. A., VI, 160. T. A., VI, 164-5. 

32 

250 

CHAPTER III 

as pumān pudgala or aņu. It represents the permanent aspect of the individual, retains residual traces (saṁskāras) and passes through innumerable births and deaths. There is a marked similarity between the Trika and the Sankhya concepts of puruşa. The former also like the latter believes that there is no limit to the number of the puruşas and that the creation of the prakrti is for supplying the necessary stimuli for the varying experiences which these puruṣas must enjoy or suffer according to their individual karma. The conception of malas and six covers, however, is peculiar to the Trika. 

This very puruşa, when it momentarily identifies itself with body etc., is spoken of as the dehapramātā and so on. Further, being entirely free from all kinds of association with the gross world at the time of the dissolution and lying in a state of deep sleep as it were, it is called pralayākala. And when it is freed from the kārma mala and consequently from the limited experiences, which are peculiar to souls in the bondage of karma, it is called Vijñānākala. As such it represents the transitional stage through which an individual self has to pass before reaching the state of the universal experiencer of the S'uddha vidyā tattva which is also called Mahāmāyā.) 

Two points have to be specially noted in this connection viz., the word "karma" in the above statement does not stand for the sum total of the effects, produced on an individual by his personal conviction that the deeds done by him would, at the time of maturation, lead to a certain result; it means simply an objectless desire, which is responsible for the association of the Self with the effects of māyā, as we shall explain in the course of our treatment of 

1. I. P. V., II, 200. 

THE CATEGORIES OF THE ABHASAVADA 

251 

the Trika theory of karma in the fifth chapter. Similarly the word (māyīya" stands for the gross body with all its gross constituents and associations (sarīra-bhuyanākāro māyīyah parikīrtitah). In our above statement we are following the authority of Abhinava. Yogarāja holds a slightly different view. 

THE SANKHYA AND THE TRIKA CONCEPTS OF PURUSA 

COMPARED. 

According to the Sānkhya, the innumerable puruşas are independent entities ; but, according to the Trika, they are the manifestations of the same Ultimate Reality. Further, Puruşa, according to the former, remains always unaffected : it is a pure sentient entity (Puruşastu puşkara palāśavat nirlepah kintu cetanah). But, according to the latter, Puruşa, though equally sentient, yet it does not remain entirely unaffected under all circumstances. 

PRAKŘTI OR PRADHĀNA. 

In the order of manifestation, the Prakrti is the first objective manifestation. According to the Trika concept of causality, it is the first purely objective (vedyamātra) effect of the kala'. It represents the state of perfect equilibrium of the three qualities, sattva, rajas and tamas. Taking the variety of its future effects into consideration (bhāvi vedya višeşāpekṣayā), it is spoken of as the generic object (vedya sāmānyātmakam). It is as countless as the puruşa, because each puruşa has a separate pradhāna, (tacca prati pum niyatatvāt anekam T. A., Comm., VI, 172). It is stirred to productive activity for the sake of puruşa by the Svatan treśa or Ananta.” 

1. T. A., VI, 171. 2. T. A. VI, 180 

252 

CHAPTER III 

COMPARISON OF THE SANKHYA AND THE TRIKA 

CONCEPTS OF THE PRADHĀNA. While both agree on the question of the Pradhāna being a state of equilibrium of all the three qualities, sattva, rajas and tamas, and on that of its working for the sake of puruşa, they fundamentally differ on the following points : 

I. It is independent in its action according to the Sankhya ; but, according to the Trika, it works only when it is stirred to activity by Ananta. 

II. It is one according to the former, but many according to the latter. 

We shall state Abhinava's arguments in support of the Trika theory of Pradhāna as well as those which he advances in refutation of that of the Sankhya, in the 5th chapter. 

BUDDHI. 

It is a product of the qualities. It is capable of receiving reflection from all sides so that it receives the reflection of the light of the self from within as well as that of the external objects from without. The objects, which cast their reflection on buddhi, are of two kinds: (I) the external, such as a gross object like jar, the reflection of which is received through the eyes, as at the time of perception; and (II) the internal, i. e., the images built out of the revived residual traces (samskāras) the reflections of which are not got through the eyes, but which affect the buddhi no less, as at the time of free imagination, rememb rance and dream. The apparent change of the mirror-like buddhi, due to a reflection, is technically called buddhiurtti, or simply vrtti or jñāna. We shall dwell at some length on the important part that Buddhi plays in perception, in the next chapter. 

THE CATEGORIES OF THE ABHĀSAVĀDA 

253 

THE SANKHYA AND THE TRIKA CONCEPTS OF 

BUDDHI COMPARED. 

Thus, there is an agreement between the Sārkhya and the Trika on the conception of Buddhi so far as it is a common meeting place of both, the light of the puruşa from one side and the reflection of the external object from the other. They, however, fundamentally differ on the nature of the source of internal light. According to the former, it is the pure self, śuddha puruşa) that casts its light on buddhi; but, according to the latter, it is one that is affected by two impurities, āņava and kārma malas. Further, according to the former, it is not objective (asamvedya), but, according to the latter, being an instrument of knowledge, it is knowable, like any other instrument such as the mind. 

AHANKĀRA. It is a product of the buddhi. It is nothing but the identification of the limited self with the buddhi and consequent attribution of the latter's activity to itself. Its distinctive function is to control the five vital airs within the system and so the life itself. It is distinct from self consciousness (ahambhāva), because while the latter is purely subjective (svātma matra visrānti satattvah) and, therefore, without any objective reference; the former is due to superimposition of the self on the buddhi'. 

MANAS. The manas or mind is a product of ahankāra (egoity). The element of sattva predominates in it. How, without its cooperation with senses, no sensation of any kind is possible, how it carves images out of the blocks of sensations

CHAPTER III 

and what other important parts it plays in perception we shall show, while dealing with the Trika theory of knowledge in the next chapter. 

THE REMAINING TWENTY TATTVAS. 

The remaining twenty tattvas are as follows: (1) The five senses or powers of perception, called 

Buddhīndriyas or jñānendriyas, namely, the 

powers of (a) smelling (ghrāņendriya) (b) tasting (rasanendriya) (C) seeing (cakşurindriya) (d) feeling-by-touch (sparśanendriya) and 

(e) hearing (śravaņendriya.) (II) The five capacities of activity, called the karmen 

driyas, (organs of action ?) namely, the capacities of (a) resting and enjoying passively (upasthendriya) (b) rejecting or discarding (pāyvindriya) (c) locomotion (pādendriya) (d) handling (hastendriya) and (e) voicing (Vāgindriya) 

III. The five subtle elements (tanmā tras) of 

(a) smell (gandha tanmātra) (b) taste (rasa tanmätra) (c) form or colour (rūpa tanmātra) (d) touch (sparsa tanmātra) and (e) sound (sabda tanmātra) 

IV. The five gross elements of 

(a) earth (b) water (c) light 

THE CATEGORIES OF THE ABHĀSAVĀDA 

255 

(d) air, and (e) ether. 

The first three groups originate from ahankāra with the predominance of sattva, rajas and tamas respectively. And the five of the last group, namely, the gross elements, are the effects of the five of the preceding group of tanmātras respectively. 

Indriyas, according to the Trika, are not mere physical organs of smelling and handling etc. They are rather the powers of the individual self which operate through these physical organs. Leaving aside the mind and the intellect, there are ten Indriyas. Five are responsible for the perceptual activities of smelling, tasting, seeing, touching and hearing and as such are mere manifestations of the vidyā, the limited power of knowledge. The remaining five are similarly responsible for the five kinds of the physical activities of handling, locomoting, voicing, rejecting and resting or enjoying passively and as such are simply different forms of kalā, the limited power of action?.

T. A., VI, 199. 

CHAPTER IV. ABHĀSAVĀDA AS THE BASIS OF THE TRIKA THEORY 

OF KNOWLEDGE. Preliminaries and Presuppositions. 

ĀBHĀSAVĀDA AND PRACTICAL LIFE. 

Abhinava very clearly says, as has already been stated in the first chapter, that the practical utility of this system is that it explains the real nature of phenomenal existence and so enables its followers to recognise the Ultimate Reality. It is, therefore, meant for only those who are seeking the truth, who want to understand the real nature of the 'apparent'. As for those, who are completely engrossed in the worldly activities of momentary interest and, therefore, seek the explanation only of the apparent nature of the apparent, the view point and the method of the Naiyāyikas is the best. The Abhāsavāda holds that each object, as we perceive it, is a momentary collocation of a certain number of abhāsas; that the individual is in reality identical with the Universal Self and as such has no independent will of its own, but acts and moves as the latter makes it do; that whatever is, is ever one with the Universal Self and even when a thing appears to have a separate existence, it is as little independent of the Ultimate as the objects of a dream are of the dreaming self and that the difference between the real and the illusory i. e. between the silver appearing at the sight of a mother-of-pearl and the real silver or between the objects of a dream and those of the wakeful state, is purely conventional; both of them are equally real or unreal; the difference between them is of 

1. 1. P. V., I, 25. 

THE BASIS OF THE TRIKA THEORY OF KNOWLEDGE 257 

degree and not of kind. But does a practical man of the world require the knowledge of all these philosophical concepts ? Can such a knowledge help him in achieving what he has set his heart on ? Abhinava's statement: "In practical every-day life the view point of the Naiyāyikas is the best" seems, therefore, to have been inspired by the following words of Lord Krşņa : 

“The enlightened should not disturb the minds of the unenlightened, who are given to active life, by talk of knowledge (jñāna)" 

Bh. G., III, 26. In this respect he follows Sankara who in his commentary on the very first Sūtra says : 

“We maintain that the antecedent conditions are the discrimination of what is eternal and what is non-eternal; the renunciation of all desire to enjoy the fruit of one's action both here and hereafter ; the acquirement of tranquillity, self restraint and the other means and the desire of final release. If these conditions exist, a man may, either before entering on an enquiry into active religious duty or after that, engage in the enquiry into Brahman and come to know it, but not otherwise." 

(V. S., Th. 12). 

The philosophical knowledge of the phenomena of the external world is of as little use to the practical man of the world as the scientific knowledge of the mechanism of cinema is to one who goes to cinema simply for diversion. 

Looking, however, at the world with a philosopher's eye and trying to explain it from the point of view of the Trika, we find that it represents only two kinds of manifestations (ābhāsas) of the Universal Consciousness, and that both of them are of limited nature. The one is sentient (jīva) and the other is insentient (jada). And because the perception, 

33 

258 

CHAPTER IV 

on which all our ideas of the external phenomena are based, presupposes both, therefore, before attempting an exposition of the theory of perception, we state here the Trika concept of both jīva and jada. 

THE LIMITED SENTIENT ĀBHĀSA. It forms one of the thirty-six categories of this system. We have, therefore, already dwelt on it at some length in the preceding chapter. It may, however, be pointed out here that consistently with the postulate of the Universal Consciousness, the Trika holds, as the strict logic requires, that the limited self has no independent existence and as such has no freedom of will or action. It is the Universal Self that wills and acts through every mind and body. On this point also this system seems to be in agreement with the Vedānta Sūtra and the Bhagavadgītā. Compare, for instance, 

"Isvaraḥ sarvabhūtānām hrddeśerjuna tişthati 

Bhrāmayan sarvabhūtāni yantrārudhāni māyayā."

It has, as already pointed out, two aspects, the permanent and the transitory. The consciousness, with the beginningless impurities (malas) and six covers, (kañcukas), which is free from association with body and vital air and is capable of retaining the effects of the external stimuli, received at the time of perception, represents the permanent aspect of the individual consciousness. It is a determinateTHE BASIS OF THE TRIKA THEORY OF KNOWLEDGE 259 

consciousness inasmuch as it is limited, though the limitation is not of any particular kind and, therefore, may be said to be as imaginary as describing a bare piece of land as a place without jar (śünyam bhūtalam ghațābhāvah). 

This limited consciousness momentarily identifies itself at one time with body, as, for instance, when one has the consciousness "I am fat" at another with vital air as when one feels "I am strong" and at still another with Buddhi as at the time of determinate knowledge "I know this.” Even a lay man knows this identification to be momentary, for, the soul gets dissociated, as all know, from the body in the deep sleep state and from the vital air and the buddhi at the time of a fainting fit. Philosophically speaking, however, the dissociation of self from the object of identification is taking place literally every moment. For, according to the Trika, as according to the Bauddha, every object is momen tary and both the psychological and the physical activities presuppose the identification of the self with the momentary manifestation of the body and the mind. How can, therefore, the activity of either kind be possible unless the renewal of the identification be admitted to be taking place every moment ? Hence the self in its aspect of identification with body etc. is represented to be transitory. 

The fact is that the Trika has accepted the Bauddha theory of momentariness of both the subject and the object and has fitted it in with its own conception of the All-inclusive Universal Consciousness, a conception which differs from the Vedāntic conception of the Brahman only inasmuch as the latter, according to Abhinava, is pure light (Suddha prakāśa), while the former is not only Prakāśamaya but also has Vimarśa, the perfect power of control over what is Prakāśa (Prakāśa vimarśamayah). Abhinava has not tried to hide this fact. He has very clearly stated in his Brhatī Vimarsinī 

260 

CHAPTER IV 

that if dualistic doctrine were given up by the so called Agamikas; if Māyā were to be taken as the power of the Brahman by the Vedāntins; and if the two Vijñānas, the ālayavijñāna and the pravíttivijñāna, were to be admitted to be the manifestations of the Atmeśvara or Maheśvara, the Universal Consciousness, by the Bauddhas, all differences between the Trika on the one hand and the Agamikas, the Vedāntins and the Bauddhas on the other disappear. The latter become the exponents of the Trika philosophy : 

"Āgameşu dvaitavyākhyāmapāsya, Brahmavāde avidyām māyāśaktīkrtya vijñānadvayam ātmeśvarābhiprāyeņa nirūpya siddhyatyeșa janah" 

and also 

"Pārameśvareşu tāvadāgameşu saivavaişnavarahasyeşu Vedānteşu ca spaşta evoktoyam asmaduktorthah, Tadanusāriņaiva sugatenoktam Cittamātramidam, yaduta traidhātukamiti tadatra vivarana kārair durabhi niveśavašena vipratārito janaḥ. Idameva tu tattvamiti tu tātparyam." 

We may add here one interesting argument in support of the momentariness of the bodily and the intellectual selves. It is generally admitted that at all hours of the wakeful state some kind of knowledge or another is taking place; that knowledge is simply an affected state of consciousness due to an external stimulus and that a determinate knowledge is invariably preceded by an indeterminate. As we pass from knowledge of one thing to that of another, the transition is not usually sharp. One act of knowledge fades gradually into the next. If, for instance, we look at a coin for several moments, we feel that we have not had a single continuous perception. First we have the knowledge of the coin as a rupee, then that of the figure on it, then of its roughened edge and then of its date and so on. These acts of knowledge 

THE BASIS OF THE TRIKA THEORY OF KNOWLEDGE 261 

so run into each other that it is ordinarily not possible to say exactly when one act of knowledge begins and the other ends. Another noteworthy point in this connection is that the Trika, like the Vedānta, holds that all is one with the Universal Self at the time of the indeterminate knowledge. 

(Aindriyake nirvikalpake sadāśiveśvaradaśābhyudayāt). 

Now if a new determinate knowledge is accepted to be taking place every moment and if it is invariably preceded by an indeterminate one, in which all is in a state of unity with the Universal Self?, the irresistible logical conclusion from all this naturally is that the limited perceiver is mani fested anew every moment a knowledge takes place. 

THE LIMITED INSENTIENT MANIFESTATION 

or 

JADĀBHĀSA. An objective limited insentient manifestation is ordinarily called? Jaļābhāsa: a jar, for instance. It forms the basis of one idea and as such is expressible by one word and has to be separately taken through the whole cognitive process in order that it may be cognised. It is momentary, because like the sentient limited manifestation, it is manifested a-new at the time of every cognition. But if we carefully analyse our knowledge of the jar we find that, though ordinarily taken to be one ābhāsa, it is made up of many; it embodies as many ābhāsas as there are words which can be used with reference to it by various analytical perceivers, looking at it from different points of view. To an ordinary perceiver it is a combination of ābhāsas of roundness, materiality, externality, blackness and existence. But, if a scientist were to do an atomic analysis of the same, how many acts of perception will 

1. 2. 

I. P. V., II, 66. I. P. V., II, 69-71. 

262 

CHAPTER IV 

he have to do and how many words will he require to describe the results of his analysis ? Can any body say that the atoms of different kinds are not the constituents of what is ordinarily taken to be one thing ? The Trika, therefore, holds that each ābhāsa, as we perceive it, is a collocation of a certain number of Abhāsas, each of which requires a separate perceptual acti vity for its perception, that the causal efficiency (artha kriya kāritva) of each depends upon its being determinately cognised and that the determinate cognition also depends upon the will, the immediate need and the analytical capacity of each perceiver 

Imagine, for instance, a farmer hitting upon an oval piece of stone in the course of his farm work and suppose that it is a very precious stone, but that its brilliance is obscured by clay that has been covering it for centuries so that no eye but that of an expert jeweller can see its hidden value. Now the question is: will this piece of precious stone have the same causal efficiency of arousing certain ideas or feelings in the case of the farmer as in that of an expert jeweller? If not, why? Let us ask the facts of common experience for a reply. And what reply do we get but that which has just been stated above, viz, the stone is a collocation of a certain number of Abhāsas: its causal efficiency differs according as a greater or a smaller number of the constituent Abhāsas is perceived, according to the perceptual capacity etc. of the individual perceiver. 

Thus each individual lives in a world of his own, a world consisting not of shadows and apparitions, as the Vivartavāda would have us believe, nor of the momentary creations of the beginningless Vāsanā of the individual, as the subjectivism of the Vijñānavāda would represent it to be, but of Abhāsas, the apparent objects of perception or conception which 

1. I. P. V, II, 85-6. 

THE BASIS OF THE TRIKA THEORY OF KNOWLEDGE 263 

have got a separate existence from himself. Let it, however, not be forgotten that the world is not exclusively his own, as it would be if the Subjectivist's explanation of the universe be accepted, but that it has much in common with similar worlds of others. These are the common factors or the common elements in each individual world of Abhāsas which make possible all the worldly transactions, which depend upon the cooperation of many. 

The phenomenon of knowledge has been described in the 2nd chapter as very much like the rise of two waves, one subjective and the other objective, in the sea of the Universal Consciousness. The former has nairmalya, the capacity to receive reflection, so that when it rises facing the latter and receives the reflection of the same, the phenomenon of knowledge takes place. This phenomenon is of various kinds. It is not always that the objective wave affects only one subjective wave, nor is it that even when it affects more than one, the affection that it causes, is always the same in all cases. The objective wave is a collocation of ābhāsas and, therefore, only those constituents of it are reflected on a particular subjective wave which are in relation of knowability to the latter. 

Buddhi is held to be like a mirror. The analogy of mirror, therefore, will clear the point in hand. If we take four mirrors and place them in different positions facing an object, we find that the reflection in all cases is not the same, though in each case there is enough common element to give us the idea of the reflecting object being the same in all cases. Why is there this difference? Is it not because of the difference in the position of each mirror ? And if so, then the same can be said to be the cause of reflection of only some of the constituent ābhāsas of an objective wave on a certain subjective wave. 

264 

CHAPTER IV 

Imagine, for instance, two persons, one purchaser and the other seller, looking at the same thing, as we would ordinarily say. Does the article appear to be the same in every aspect to both ?1 Do both the persons have the same perception and conception of the object as a whole and in its parts ? Experience says "no" to this and the Abhāsavāda explains by saying that the constituent Abhāsas of a collocation which cast reflection, differ according to the will, the need, and the motive force of the perceptual or the cognitive activity, in short, the point of view of the percipient. 

THE CONSTITUENT ĀBHĀSAS. 

Each constituent ābhāsa is a separate entity and as such it is ever the same. All the talk of change refers only to combination. And the difference in the causal efficiency of a collocation depends upon the ābhāsa with which it is combined or associated. The idea will become clear if we were to bear in mind that, according to this system, each idea, for which a word stands, is a separate ābhāsa. Thus "seeing", tembracing" (ālingana), "present", "past", "far", "near", etc. are separate ābhāsas. Suppose, for instance, that a person is in love with a lady. He meets her in one fine moon-lit night in a beautiful garden. They remain together for a few hours. Now the question arises : will the causal efficiency of the lady in arousing certain feelings in the mind of her lover be the same throughout this time? Will there be no difference in her causal efficiency at the moment when she is embracing her lover from that when she sits apart, with her eye-brows knit? Will she not please her lover in the former and pain him in the latter case? If she 

1. I. P. V., I, 261. 2. I. P. V., I, 320. 3. I. P. V., I, 322. 

THE BASIS OF THE TRIKA THEORY OF KNOWLEDGE 265 

will the question arises, why? Ābhāsavāda replies that it is not because of any change in the individual ābhāsas, but because of difference in the combination. In the first case, when the lady is a source of pleasure, she, as a colloca tion, is combined with the "embracing" and the "near", but in the second case, with the "frowning" and the "far". What we mean to point out is this, that in both the cases, when the lady is embracing and when she is frowning, the mode, the form that consciousness assumes, is the same in respect of the lady, but the difference lies only in this, that in the former case she is combined with the ābhāsas of "embracing" and "near", but in the latter with those of “frowning" and "far". Thus the difference in the causal efficiency of the principal ābhāsa in a combination depends upon the constituent or the associated ābhāsas. In fact, the causal efficiency also is a separate ābhāsa. Just like the causal efficiency the externality (bāhyatva) also does not constitute the essential nature of the manifested. In both the states, viz., of internality and externality i. e, at the time when it is within the Universal Consciousness and that when it is manifested as apparently separate from it, an object is essentially the same. Externality is simply an associated abhāsa. And for the unification of these abhāsas, as also for their manifestation, it is the Lord's will, the element of the will power in the Universal Consciousness, that is responsible. 

The above statement makes it clear that one cognisable ābhāsa is a collocation of many, that its causal efficiency differs with difference in the constituent or the associated ābhāsas and that the combination of abhāsas is the work 

1. I. P. V., I, 329-30. 2. I. P. V., 1, 330. 

34 

266 

CHAPTER IV 

of the Lord's Svātantrya sakti. Here it may be asked: if each cognisable ābhāsa is a collocation of many why is it called one and if the unification of abhāsas by the Lord's will is a necessary antecedent condition of all cognitions, is there any limit to this unification? In reply to this Abhinava says that the ordinarily innumerable uncognizable ābhāsas forma cognizable one exactly in the manner in which innumerable unilluminative particles of light form an illuminating flame and, therefore, just as the latter is spoken of as one because of one causal efficiency, namely, that of dispelling darkness, so, for the same reason, the former also is so spoken of. A jar, for instance, though it is made up of many abhāsas such as big, round, bright, golden and heavy etc. yet, because it is conceived as having one causal efficiency at the time of cognition, it is spoken of as one. As regards the limit in the unification, he says that only such ābhāsas are united as are not of a conflicting nature. The ābhāsa of air, for instance, will not find union with that of form. 1 

REFUTATION OF THE RIVAL THEORIES OF 

PERCEPTION. 

In the philosophical works of Abhinava where he criticises rival theories, the Pratyabhijñā Vimarsinī, for instance, the Bauddha figures as the chief opponent. In fact, the whole of the Pratyabhijñā Vimarsinī, with the exception of the Agamādhikāra and the introductory Ahnika, is practically a reply to the Bauddha objections, recorded in the second Ahnika of the first chapter. The Sāökhya theories also have been criticised at places both in the Pratyabhijñā Vimarsini and the Tantraloka, but that is only by the way. Here we propose to follow our author's maxim that to begin with the refutation of the rival theories, is the 

1. I. P, V., II, 96. 

THEORY OF PERCEPTION 

267 

best way of establishing one's own. Therefore, before taking up the Trika theory of perception for an exposition, we first briefly state and then refute the Sārkhya and the Bauddha theories mostly with the help of the material collected from Abhinava's own works. 

SÄNKHYA THEORY OF PERCEPTION. According to the Sārkhya, the Buddhi is made up of three qualities, Sattva, Rajas and Tamas. It is predominated by the Sattva and, therefore, is possessed of the natural nairmalya, the capacity to receive reflection on all sides. And though, in the condition of bondage, it is shrouded by the tamas, yet it can partly receive the reflection of external objects, because the shroud of the tamas is partly removed by the activity of the rajas. It is insentient, because the qualities of which it is made are so, but still, being partly capable of receiving reflection, because of the working of the Rajas, as just pointed out, it receives light from the self-luminous self within. Thus a person is said to be knowing when the light of the self within, falling on the jada Buddhi, comes in contact with the reflection of an external object falling on the same. Knowledge, (jñāna) therefore, according to the Sārkhya, is nothing else than a form which, like a mirror, Buddhi assumes because of its being a meeting place of both, the light of the self-luminous self within and the reflection of an external object without. 

THE NECESSITY FOR SUCH AN ASSUMPTION. 

The subject and the object are of fundamentally opposite nature. The former is self-luminous but the latter is devoid of all light. The one is changeless but the other is changing. Therefore, if the puruşa, who is unaffectable pure 

1. I. P. V., I, 71. 

268 

CHAPTER IV 

light, be the illuminator of the objects which in themselves are devoid of all light it would be difficult to explain why things are perceived in succession and why a jar shines (prakāśate) as distinct from a piece of cloth : 

"Sa ca prakāśa ityetāvat svabhāvaḥ svabhāvāntaram aprakāśarūpam bhogyam............ Sa ca prakāśamātra syabhāvatvenaiva yadi viśvasya prakāsaḥ tarhi viśvam yugapat prakāseta ghataprakāsopi pataprakāśaḥ syāt iti viśvam samkīryeta" 

I. P. V., I, 74. 

The supposition of the self-luminousness of the object cannot explain the phenomena of knowledge. For, in that case it would be difficult to account for the limit and the degree of the individual kuowledge. If every thing is self-luminous why should it not, like the self-luminous self, be always equally known to all ? Even the supposition that the percep tion is consequent upon the illumination of the object by the light of self cannot improve the position ; for, in that case also, when the object has once become illuminated, it is difficult to find reason why it should not become equally manifest to all. About the sense contact as the cause of perceptibility of the object to some and not to all and its refutation by Abhinava, we shall write in the course of our treatment of the Prakatatāvāda of the Mīmāṁsaka. The Sānkhya, therefore, puts forward the Buddhivrtti theory of knowledge, as explained above. 

REFUTATION OF THE SANKHYA THEORY. 

The above theory of the Sankhya is not sound, firstly, because the analogy of mirror and jar, on which it is based, requires the reflecting and the reflected to be similar in their nature ; but Buddhi and self are of fundamentally opposite nature; the one is sentient, but the other lacks sentiency; secondly, because, ordinarily that which is less bright castsTHEORY OF PERCEPTION 

269 

its reflection on what is more so, but even the Sankhya will not be prepared to admit that in point of nairmalya buddhi exceeds self (But what about the reflection of a flame in a mirror or that of the sun in water ? It is perhaps because of the consciousness of this defect in his above argument that he puts forth another, the last and strongest) and thirdly, because the Sankhya cannot satisfactorily answer the question that naturally arises in this connection as to whether buddhi, in consequence of the reflection of the light of self, itself becomes light or not. In the latter case it will not be able to illumine the object exactly as the material light, reflected in a mirror, cannot, and, therefore, even when there is the reflection of the light of self on Buddhi the external object will not be illuminated (nārtha prakāśatā) Hence perception will be impossible. But if the case be the former i. e. Buddhi itself becomes an illuminant, the postulate of an illuminating Puruşa becomes useless, because then all the objections to remove which a separate Buddhi Tattva is assumed by the Sankhya will stand as before. 

BAUDDHA THEORIES OF PERCEPTION AND THEIR 

REFUTATIONS. Out of the four schools of Buddhism only two, the Sautrāntika and the Vijñānavāda, have been taken up for criticism by Abhinava in connection with the theory of perception. 

SAUTRĀNTIKA THEORY. According to the Sautrāntika, every thing is momentary. The subject, the self-luminous consciousness (Bodha), is no less momentary than the object. But each of these gives rise to another, which, in its essential nature, is similar to itself, in the second moment. Thus a jar of the preceding 

1. I. P. V., 1, 77, 

D 

270 

YET 

CHAPTER IV 

moment, being in touch with a sense organ, eye, for instance, gives rise to knowledge in the following moment which, in form, is similar to the object which casts its reflection. But the fact that the external object exists and that it is of a certain form, is a matter of inference only, drawn from the form of knowledge itself, because direct touch with it is not possible. Every thing is momentary and so must be the jar also. Logically, therefore, it ceases to exist immediately after casting its reflection. But the direct touch requires the coexistence of the object and the affected consciousness which is the effect of the reflection of the former (sākāram cittam jñānaśabdavācyam). How can the two co-exist? The one is the cause and the other is its effect. The cause must precede the effect ; therefore, if the object, which is the cause of the affected consciousness, precedes the existence of the latter, as it must, it cannot remain in existence at the time of its effect. The direct touch with the object, therefore, is not possible*. 

THE NECESSITY FOR SUCH A SUPPOSITION. 

The chain of momentary self-consciousness, called ālayavijñāna, is of the nature of pure light. It is uniform in its nature and is devoid of all diversity : 

"Anumātramapi na rūpāntaram asya asti iti abhinno bo dhah". 

But the object is admittedly of the opposite nature and as such is not self-luminous. How is then the phenomenon of the varying knowledge to be accounted for? It cannot be said that it is the very nature of the limited consciousness to assume a variety of forms in succession ; for, in that case, it would not be possible to explain such an unaffected state 

*S. D. S, Abhyankar's edition. 

THEORY OF PERCEPTION 

271 

as we experience at the time of deep sleep or as a yogin does in the state of Samadhi. Therefore, the explanation of the occasional varying affection of the limited consciousness (vicitrābhāsa) that the Sautrāntika gives is that it is due to the reflection of the external object on the self due to the contact of the latter with the former. The object, however, that casts the reflection, is momentary and therefore, is not directly perceived as we have already stated. For this reason this school is also known as Anumeyārthavāda?. 

ITS REFUTATION. 

All determinate cognitions presuppose the direct percep tion of their respective objects and so does the inference, because it is a determinate cognition. We, for instance, can infer fire from smoke, but not without first knowing their universal concomitance from daily perception of fire and smoke together in kitchen or elsewhere. Therefore, if the external object is never perceptible no inference either can be possible of it. 

The Bauddha may say here that an inference does not always presuppose the direct perception of the inferred, because it is unnecessary in the case of a generic inference, (sāmānyatodrsta) where the nature of an invisible thing is inferred from a previously known general law such as that of causality. Soul, for instance, is inferred by the Naiyāyikas from the necessity that Buddhi and other qualities must reside in a substance, according to the general law that every quality must have a substratum. Similarly, to take another instance, senses are inferred from the fact of perception, because of the general law that every event must have a cause, though senses as such are never directly perceived. But it can be pointed out to him 

1. 

I. P.V., 1, 166. 

272 

CHAPTER IV 

that in the case of the generic inference also the inferred is held to be not such as has never been directly known. Rather the fact is that it is always maintained to be as it has directly been perceived. If we take the instance of the inferred senses, we find that they are inferred not as of some definite nature, but simply as certain causes which are responsible for the events of perception; and the cause as such we daily perceive directly, as for instance, when we see a seed change into a sprout or threads into a piece of cloth'. And even if, for the sake of argument, it be admitted that an inference can be drawn even in the case of the unperceived, how will it be possible for the object, which is external to and in nature opposite from the self, to shine (abhāsate) in the latter ; because, as we have pointed out in the 2nd chapter, when we divide the subject from the object, the question of building the bridge from one to the other becomes difficult”. 

VIJÑANAVĀDIN'S THEORY. The sensationalists (Vijñānavādins) do not believe in the existence of the external world. According to them, there is a chain or stream of momentary self-consciousness, called alaya vijñāna santati or dhārā. This differs in the case of every individual and has an existence exclusive and independent of the rest of the innumerable similar chains which are ordinarily known as souls. It has got a certain power, technically called vāsanā, the capacity to give rise to the innumerable presentments (pravrttivijñāna) or sensations which constitute the variety of daily cognitions. This vāsanā also is momentary, like the stream of self-conscious ness, and each vāsanā of the chain thereof has got an independent capacity to give rise to a certain presentment. 

1. I. P. V., I, 188. 2. I. P. V., 1, 190 

THEORY OF PERCEPTION 

273 

In fact, the presentment is due to the maturescence (Paripāka) of a link of the chain of vāsanā. Thus, according to the sensationalists, a cognition is nothing but, as said just now, a presentment brought about by mature scence of a link of vāsanāl. 

S ITS REFUTATION. According to the Vijñānavādin, the existentiality is of two kinds, real and apparent, (paramārtha sattvam and Samvști sattvam). The vijñāna alone is real and all that appears in it (abhāsate)has only an apparent existence. Now, although the apparent may be spoken of as unreal, yet its cause has, of necessity, to be admitted to be real, because, how can one reasonably speak of what is non-exis tent in reality, as the cause of the apparent. How can, what is nothing in itself, be the cause of something? But if to get out of this difficulty the Vijñānavādin were to admit the separate real existence of the vāsanās, which are the cause of all that appears, he ceases to be Vijñānavadin; his theory, in that case, would be no better than that of the Bahyārthavādin who believes in the existence of the external world as the cause of variations in consciousness. The only difference which then remains is that he calls what is external by the name of vāsanā and not by that of artha (object) as the Bāhyārtha vādin does. Nor can the opponent say that these vāsanās are the cause of presentments in that aspect of theirs in which they are real (yena rūpena satyatā tena kāraṇatā). For, vijñāna, which, according to the opponent, represents the real aspect of vāsanā, has no variety in itself; the plurality of vāsanā in its real aspect, therefore, is out of question. How can then the variety in the presentment be explained ? And even if, for the sake of 

1. I. P. V., I, 167. 2. I. P. V., 1, 167-8, 

35 

274 

CHAPTER IV 

argument, variety in vāsanā be admitted, then also, there being nothing like time, place or object, which may serve as the immediate cause of maturescence of a certain vāsanā, how can the rise of only a certain presentment at a certain time to the exclusion of all the rest be explained ??. 

Moreover", if each stream of self-consciousness is different from all the rest ; if the sensations (pravrtti vijñāna) of each, being caused by its own vāsanā, are exclusive and independent and if each soul is living in a world of its own, how can the collaboration of many persons be possible in respect of the same object, as for instance, in lifting up of a heavy log? Thus the Vijñānavadin's theory fails to explain both the varying experiences of an individual and the common experience of a group. In fact, if we accept the Vijñānavādin's theory our world should be no better than the one, if there can be such a one, in which every soul, being, as it were, under the influence of a certain spirit, is living in a world of its own creation and, therefore, being completely cut off from the rest, is incapable of any attachment to or coopeation with any other. 

TRIKA THEORY OF PERCEPTION. The defects in the theories of knowledge of the rival systems, as pointed out above, are that the Sankhya and the Anumeyarthavādin leave a gulf between the subject and the object by holding them to be mutually exclusive and perfectly independent; and the Vijñānavādin fails to explain the common and the individual experiences on which depend all worldly transactions. The Trika, therefore, holds that the phenomenon of knowledge owes its 

1. I. P. V., I, 168. 2. I. P. V., I. 174. 

THEORY OF PERCEPTION 

275 

being solely to the will power of the Universal Cons ciousness which at the time of each cognition manifests externally anew the subject, the object and the means of cognition very much Ike a yogin who brings immediately into existence the innumerable objects, which he desires, by sheer force of will, without the assistance of any external thing whatsoever. In fact, if, in order to satisfactorily account for the phenomena of knowledge, the objects are to be admitted to exist, as they must be, if the facts of experience have not altogether to be ignored. they have necessarily to be admitted to be the creation of the Universal Subject. The modern philosophic thinkers also hold this to be the only sound philosophical view of the subject-object relation as the following statement of Prof. Radhakrisnan shows : 

“When we divide the subject from the object the ques tion of building the bridge from one to the other becomes difficult. Either we have to hold that the object is the creation of the subject or that there is no object at all" 

(I. Ph., Vol. I, 135) 

Abhinava has justified the above conclusion as follows: 

The object is not self-luminous (svātma vasenaiva na tāvadvyavatişthate). For, had it been so, like self, it would have always been equally manifest to all and would not have stood in the relation of knowability only to some per cipient or percipients at a particular time as the following judgments indicate: 

"This is now known to me". 

"This shines (avabhāsate) to Caitra". It has, therefore, to be admitted that manifestedness of the object depends upon some entity which is not only perfectly independent of but also of fundamentally opposite nature from the object inasmuch as it is self-shining. For, 

276 

CHAPTER IV 

otherwise, it would as little help in the illumination of the object as one blind man can another. Again, this self luminous entity, the subject, cannot be supposed to illumine the object without any connection with i. e. without being affected in any way by, the latter; for, in that case, its unaffectedness with regard to all being the same, it would be difficult to account for its illumining only some and not others. It is, therefore, held that when the self-luminous self faces some object or objects it throws its light on the latter. This light being reflected back by the obstructing ob ject, the sensory image, forms an image of the latter on the mirror-like Buddhi which, according to this system, is nothing else than a state of the limited self?. 

(Sopi yadi suddho nirviśeşo na tarhi nīlasyaiva vyava sthāhetuh bhavet pītādāvapi tasya tathātvāt, tadasau nīloparakto nīlonmukho nīlaprakāśasvabhāva ityābhāsah san nilasya vyavasthāpakah, tatprakaśasvabhāvataiva hi tadvya vasthāpakatā. 

te (I. P. V., II, 65). 

The illumination of only certain object or objects at a time to the exclusion of the rest, presupposes an apparently separate existence of both the subject and the object from the Universal Consciousness ; for, if it be supposed to illumine the object which is one with the Universal Self, oneness of all with the latter being the same, the illumination of one to the exclusion of the rest will be inexplicable. Again, the illumining subject also, in order that the illuminable object may have separate existence from it, must itself be at least apparently separate from the All-inclusive Universal Conscious ness ; for, otherwise, there being nothing outside the Universal Consciousness, the talk of separate existence of the 

1. T. A., VI, 156. 2. P. H., 11-2. 

277 

THEORY OF PERCEPTION 

illuminable from the illumining would be meaningless. But how can the separate existence of the subject be possible unless the Universal Consciousness itself were to assume some limitations and so to manifest its limited form separate both from itself and the manifested object ? 

Here it may be asked : If the subject and the object are so separate from each other, what is it that connects them, what is it that places the latter in the relation of knowability to the former, or, in other words, what is it that brings about the phenomenon of knowledge ? The Trika says in reply that it is the means of knowledge (Pramāņa). It is, as we pointed out above, the light proceeding from the self-luminous self facing the object, the light which comes in touch with the object and being affected by the latter in a certain way, is reflected back and so gives rise to image in the Buddhi; the light which transforms into a psychic state the stimulus of an external object on the sense organ which is resolved into a form of mechanical contact. About the momentariness of the subject and the object we have already spoken. They being so, the momentariness of the means of knowledge is a matter of course, because it will naturally change, as said above, according as it will be affected by the object which changes every moment even from the point of view of an ordinary observer, at least in respect of time, if in no other respect. Thus, according to this system, both, the creation, which is an act of the Universal Consciousness to manifest without, as apparently separate from itself, what exists within, and the dissolution, which is nothing but merging back in the Universal Consciousness of what is so manifested, are taking place every moment.

CHAPTER IV 

INDETERMINATE AND DETERMINATE KNOWLEDGE. 

Indeterminate knowledge is that which is not characterised by genus, admits of no specification and has no attribute of time, place and form etc. in common with any thing else?. It has no variety, because one knowledge can be said to be different from another only when the use of language is possible with regard to them ; but it is impossible in the case of indeterminate knowledge. The first experience of the world by a just born baby is generally accepted to be a typical instance of this kind of knowledge. Determinate knowledge is the reverse of the indeterminate. The substitution of the negative part of the definition of the latter by the positive assertion gives a clear definition of the former. 

THE PROCESS. The Trika makes a very clear distinction between the physical and the psychological activities involved in percep tion. It recognises the optical sense to be separate from the eyeballs. It believes that not only the optical sense but others also receive the reflection of their respective external objects and that an image, that is formed on the retina, is different from that on the real optical sense. Further, an image that is formed on a particular sense is different from another similar image on the Buddhi. The former is the cause and the latter is the effect; one is physical and the other is psychological. Therefore, when we speak of the object of illumination of the light of the self-luminous self we mean thereby the image on the sense. 

What happens, when a certain perception takes place, is that the mind (manas) sets a certain sense to work ; so 

1. I. P. V., I, 53-4. 2. T. A., II, 45-7. 3. T. A., II, 50.THEORY OF PERCEPTION 

279 

long as there is no prompting by or the cooperation of the mind, the object, though reflected on the external sense, retina for instance, does not cause any sensation. The sense comes in touch with its object which is nothing but the reflection of the external object on sense organ and recei ves its reflection, which may be said to consist of a number of sensations. This physical image is illumined by the light of knowledge proceeding from the self-luminous self, and casts its reflection through the medium of that very illuminating light as explained above, on the Buddhi. The latter may be called a psychological image in contrast to the former. This gives rise to the indeterminate consciousness i. e. the consciousness of the light of knowledge having been affected. It is called indeterminate knowledge, because it is not possible to say at this stage as to what exactly is the cause of the affection of the pure light of knowledge. 

The psychological activity involved in perception corresponds to the physical in almost every way. It is, therefore, admitted by the Trika that the so called one act of perception is not really one action but a large number of them taken to be one because of their leading to one result, the judgment (pramiti) : 

(Na ekaikatah pramāṇāt sā pravsttih api tu 

pramāna samūhādeva.) Taking, for instance, the physical action, the formation of an image on the retina, for a critical analysis, we find that it is caused not by a simple but a complex action ; an action which has clearly marked divisions, though they are not ordinarily recognised. It is admitted that no object is perfectly smooth nor every 

1. T. A., II, 47-8. 2. T. A., VI, 223. 3. T. A., VI, 224. 

280 

CHAPTER IV 

part thereof has the same reflecting power, Naturally, therefore, different rays of the illuminating light meet not only different objects in succession, according to the respective distance of each of them from the source, but the various parts also of the same object in the same way. Different rays then undergo different changes due to partial absorption of light by the objects or parts thereof and similar other causes. Thus they, (different rays) because of their meeting obstructions at different points of time, howsoever imperceptible, are reflected back in succession and so come in touch in the same succession with the object, on which the image is formed. Now, since the reflected rays are responsible for the formation of an image on the retina, it has naturally to be admitted to have taken place not all at once, without any order or succession, but gradually, point by point, in the same order in which each of the points is formed by a separate affected and reflected ray coming in touch with the retina. It is another matter that owing to the tremendous velocity of light time-lag between one ray and another is imperceptible. We are here simply pointing out its theoretical existence which can, by no means, be denied. 

Suppose a person is having three or four things in his fist and is showing them to another person by exposing them to the latter's view for the shortest possible time that the quickest movement of fingers can make possible. In such a case the percipient will get no idea whatsoever of the things so exposed. And suppose that next time he keeps the fist open for a little while so that the perceiver can have just a vauge idea of its contents, and so on. Now the question is what is it that gives rise to various kinds of perception, according as the things are kept exposed for shorter or longer time? Is it not because at different times the light rays, responsible for the rise of images on which the perceptual 

THEORY OF PERCEPTION 

281 

judgement is based, are affected differently because of the contact with different things or different parts of the same thing, which alone could be touched, because of the com parative shorter or longer exposure ? 

Thus, according to the Trika, whatever appears, what. ever is capable of affecting the light in any way and so of contributing something, it may be a point, to the formation of an image on the retina, of causing a separate sensation, of being distinctively imaged in the Buddhi and ultimately, at the time of the most analytical determinate knowledge, of being referred to by a separate word, requires a separate perceptual activity from the time it affects a particular ray of light to that when it is cognised to have got a separate existence and is given a name : 

"Tatra ca pratyakşam pratyābhāsam prämānyam bhajate vimarsalakṣaṇasya pramitivyāpārasya ekaikaśabdavā. cyerthe viśranteh, tadanusāritvācca pramāṇasya" 

I. P. V., I, 188-9. It may be pointed out here that these innumerable percep tions, which take place within that which prompts the percipient to some kind of motor response, are not always conceived separately. Their separate conception as such depends upon, as we pointed out before, the individual will, liking and analytical capacity. 

THE DISTINCTIVE PROCESS OF THE DETERMINATE 

KNOWLEDGE. The whole process from the time of illumination of the object by an external light to that of its mirroring on the Buddhi, leads only to an indeterminate knowledge which consists in the consciousness of the Buddhi having been affected ; a consciousness with regard to which the use of language is not possible. After this, begins the process which is distinctive of the determinate knowledge. 

36 

282 

CHAPTER IV 

When a person says "I am seeing a jar" it is not that he sees the jar alone. There are many other objects which are reflected on the Buddhi through the retina. Of these also he has some sort of consciousness, which, of course, is different from that of the jar. Why then does he make a definite statement about the jar to the exclusion of the rest of the presentation? The Trika replies that it is because on that part alone of the whole of the presentation the mind has acted, because that alone has been carried through the process leading to determinate knowledge. 

The determinative process begins with the selection by mind (manas) of some points out of the mass reflected on the Buddhi. It is like carving an image out of a big piece of stone. This is not all. For, every time a person sees a jar he does not feel it to be an altogether new thing ; he sees many points in it in common with his previous perceptions; he knows it to belong to a familiar class, gives it a name, conceives liking or dislike for it and accordingly tries to gain or shun it. How does all this happen? The explanation, which the Trika offers, is that soon after the carving out of an image from the block or mass of points or sensations there takes place a revival of the memory of a similar object perceived before; then, because of the law of association, wakes up the memory of its name and the feelings that it aroused in the past (Eka sambandhi jñānam apara sambandhi smārakam bhavati), then follow the comparison of the presented and the revived images, the classification of the former with the latter and finally the attribution of the latter's name and qualities to the former and consequent liking or aversion for it according as it is associated with pleasant or unpleasant memories. 

1. I. P. V., II, 40-1 

2. I. P. V., 11, 54-5. 

THEORY OF PERCEPTION 

283 

This is what takes place in the case of the perception of an extremely familiar object. The determinative process in the case of the unfamiliar is a little more complex inasmuch as it involves elimination. Suppose a fossil botanist has to classify a new fossil, the structure of which has no marked similarity with any, known before, so that there is no clue as to its class. In such a case, there arise many images of previously perceived fossils which may have some similarity with the present. And although ultimately it is identified with only one of them, yet the judgement is not reached till after the identification with the rest has been found to be unreasonable as a result of a careful comparison 

DETERMINATE KNOWLEDGE AND EXTERNAL OBJECT. 

Determinate knowledge has no direct reference to the external object. (Arthāsamsparsino vikalpāh). This is in reality a Buddhist idea. But it has come into the Trika as a logical consequence of its having accepted the Buddhist theory of momentariness as far as the 'apparent' is concerned. If the object is momentary and the determinate knowledge follows the indeterminate, it is obviously inconsistent with the theory of momentariness to say that the object of the indeterminate knowledge exists at the time of the determinate ; still more so is the notion of its forming an object of the latter. But the Trika holds this view for an additional psychological reason, namely, that the determina tive process consists in a reaction of the mind on the sense data recorded (to speak figuratively) on the Buddhi, in making a selection of a certain group of points from the whole mass, in adding to the selected something from the old store of memory and in giving it a definite shape and name. It is the second process which leads to the 

1. 2. 

I. P. V., I, 240. I. P. V., II, 103 

284 

CHAPTER IV 

judgement in regard to the object of perception, a process, without which no subsequent recollection of a simply sensed object is possible, as, for instance, in the case of the innumerable objects, sensed through the window of a mail train when she is running at a speed of fifty miles per hour. Thus the determinate knowledge is quite different from sensation which precedes it ; and as such it is purely internal and is in no way directly connected with any thing that is external. 

SUPERSENSUOUS EXPERIENCE OR 

ANUBHAVA. What we have said above in regard to the psychic movements consequent upon the reflection of an external object on a sense, say, optical, in short means that knowledge or cognition is the result of a causal action of an external object on the self, that all its contents are purely subjective states of the cognising self, that the causal objective manifestation does not form a part of knowledge and that knowledge, if it reproduces reality, can contain only copies of the real and not the objects themselves. Thus it is clear that the self never comes in direct touch with the external object. It knows only the copies of the real and not the real. It cannot satisfy itself that the copies are true by comparing them with the original. Therefore, according to the psychic process described above, it is not possible to be certain that our knowledge is correct. Further, if all that the self can know are the reflections on the retina which, being proportionate to the dimension of the eye. ball (in the case of an ocular perception, for instance) are much smaller than the original, how can the above explained theory of perception satisfactorily account for our common experience of such a huge thing as a mountain ? 

1. I. P. V., I, 141-2. 

THEORY OF PERCEPTION 

285 

It cannot be said to be a matter of inference, because inference presupposes the direct knowledge of the inferred and, according to the above theory, the real is known only through the copies. The theory of the All-inclusive Universal Consciousness may explain the fact of self and not-self coming together much in the same way as the sea accounts for the meeting of two logs which are floating on it, but it cannot explain the above difficulties. 

Abhinava, therefore, holds that the all-inclusiveness of the Universal Consciousness consists not in its being simply a substratum of things of diverse kinds and of opposite nature, but in its being the essence of all that has existentia lity (satta) exactly as the earth is of all that is earthy. He asserts that just as earthiness of a jar depends upon its being essentially earthy i. e. being made up of earth; and that just as jar, in order that it may have its being on earth must essentially be earth, so all that is indicated by the word "all" in "All-inclusive Universal Consciousness", in order that it may have its being in the Universal Consciousness, should essentially be itself consciousness. This is what a strictly logical explanation of the phenomenon of knowledge requires. This is what Professor Radhakrishnan seems to imply when he says in his Indian Philosophy : 

"If truth means agreement of ideas with reality and if reality is defined as that which is external to thought what is not thought or made up of thought then truth seeking is a wild goose chase". 

In the above quotation the learned professor seems to imply not only what we have already stated but also that the ascertainment of the correctness of our idea of the external, requires the object to be within the thought or consciousness to make the comparison possible. In this he seems to echo Abhinava's view on the matter. Abhinava 

286 

CHAPTER IV 

holds that before the commencement of the above described psychic process, that is, at the time of rise of desire for perception, the cognising self becomes pervasive as far as the object or objects of perception and that the objects also appear in their essential nature of being made up of con sciousness and become one with the self much in the same manner as the reflection does with the object that has the capacity to receive it. Thus a phenomenon of knowledge may be said to be a union of the subjective and the objective waves of consciousness in the sea of the All-inclusive Universal Consciousness. This supersensuous knowledge is technically called 'anubhava', which implies the subject's becoming what the object is. Just as when we say that Devadatta imitates Yajñadatta (Devadattah Yajñadattam anukaroti) we mean that the former does the same or similar thing as does the latter, so when we say "John experiences (anubhavati) a jar," it means, if we take the word "anubhavati" literally, that John becomes what the jar is. This is exactly what Abhinava has said in slightly different words in the Brhati Vimarsinī quoted in a foot note in I. P. V., I, 42 as follows: 

**Tathā ca ghato mama sphuratīti korthah, madīyam sphuranam spandanam āviştah madrāpatāmāpanna leva 

cinmayatvāt." To clear the point let us quote Bhāskarakantha's explanation of Abhinava's text on which the above statement is based : 

"Grahanasamaye bhāvasya māyayā bhāvatvena bhāsita 

nijam sahajaśuddhaprakāśākhyam svarūpameva pra mātāram prati sphuțībhavati, yatah tadā pramātā tadvastu prati diděkşāsamaye vyāpakībhavati yaduk tam : 

"Didrkşayeva sarvārthān yadā vyāpyāvatișthate Tadā kim bahunoktena svayam evāvabhotsyate"

Vyāpakībhavamśca tadvastu svātmasātkaroti tanmayī. bhāvāsādanañca vastunah suddhaprakāśarūpatvāsāda nameva pramātuḥ śuddhaprakāśamātra rūpatvāt." 

CRITICISM OF THE RIVAL THEORIES. 

The typical rivals of the above theory of subject-object union, as propounded by Abhinava, are the Mīmāmsakas and the Naiyāyikas. The rival theory of knowledge of the former is known as Prakatatāvāda and that of the latter as Kārana tāvāda. We take them here separately for criticism. 

PRAKAȚATĀVĀDA. This theory is said to have been founded by Bhatta Kumārila. He holds that a phenomenon of knowledge pre supposes some kind of relation between the subject and the object. This relation is brought about by the move ment of the knowing self and is an object of internal perce ption (mānasapratyakşa) alone. His conception of know ledge is that it is simply an act of the cognisor, which produces cognisedness (jñāta tā) or manifestedness (prakațatā) in the object. The action of the agent, the cognition, is not directly perceptible; it can only be inferred from the quality of cognisedness produced by it in the object. 

(Ittham tadvādah : 

Jñānam nāma kriyā, sā ca phalānumeyā phalam ca prakațatākhyam vişayadharmah saiva vedyatā iti Kaumārilah procuh 

I. P. V., I, 155). He is a dualist and, therefore, in order to maintain the independent existence of the object, he denies the self-luminosity to knowledge. He cannot either admit the cognition to be directly cognisable, for, it would then require another cognition to cognise it and that too another still and so on ad-infinitum. His theory, therefore, 

288 

CHAPTER IV 

in short is that the objects are known through cognition which has the capacity of manifesting them, though in itself it is only inferrable. 

ITS REFUTATION. 

If the subject and the object have an exclusive existence even at the time of cognition and if manifestedness, though produced, belongs to the object exactly as do the other qualities such as blackness, for instance, in the case of a jar, it is difficult to explain why it is manifest only to some and not to others. If it gets manifestedness i. e. if it is made manifest, there is no reason why it should not become equally manifest to all. But, if the Mimāṁsaka were to say that mere manifestedness of an object does not necessarily mean its connection with all perceivers so as to give rise to the particular consciousness "It is known to me" in each case, he has to be asked :-"Is the manifestedness of the object self-confined ?" Of course, it is not reasonable to suppose that the mere being of a thing makes it known to a perceiver without the subject's being connected with the object in some way; for, if it were so, all should be all-knowing. If, therefore, he were to admit the manifestedness of the object to be self-confined he will still find his position much the same, because then the object will not be known even to the person whose cognitional activity has produced cognisedness. For, the manifestedness of the object would be as much self confined for him as for any one else. There should, therefore, be perfect ignorance of the objective world according to the Mīmāṁsaka theory. Nor can it be said that the relation of causality will determine the relation of knowability, that is to say, the object will have manifestedness, will shine, to him only whose cognitive activity has given it manifested ness; because, our experience tells us that an effect, after it has come into being, need not depend for its existenceTHEORY OF PERCEPTION 

289 

upon or shine only to him, who has been instrumental in bringing it into existence. For, if it were so, a jar, made by a potter, should have no existence independent of him and should shine only to him, just as the Mīmāṁsaka would wish the manifestedness to be manifest only to its creator. Mīmāmsaka theory of knowledge, therefore, is not acceptable, because it cannot explain the fact of individual experience. 

THE NAIYĀYIKA THEORY OF KNOWLEDGE. We are not here concerned with the Naiyāyika view of the process involved in perception. The point under discussion is the part that an object plays in the production of a phenomenon of knowledge. We, therefore, state here only that part of the Naiyāyika theory of knowledge which has immediate bearing on the question in hand. According to the Naiyāyika, the relation between knowledge and its object is that of the illuminator and the illuminated, much the same as between a lamp and the object on which it sheds its light. 

("Jñānasyārtha prakāśatvam nanu rūpam pradīpavat” 

I. P. V., 1, 156). 

He also holds that variety in cognition is caused by variety of the instruments and objects. 

ITS REFUTATION. If the light of knowledge is to be taken as different from the object it has of necessity to be supposed to be uniform in its nature; because, it is the common element in all the multifarious cognitions, such as those of the red, the blue and the black. The red etc. cannot be considered to be the very forms of knowledge, for, then all the notion of independence of the object becomes baseless. If, however, they are taken to be separately existing entities the question arises : if it is with the help of the light of knowledge 

37 

290 

CHAPTER IV 

that we know the difference between the black and the blue, and if that light of knowledge is one and uniform in its nature how can the blue be known as blue with the help of that very light, by means of which the black is known as black ? The opponent cannot say that the difference in knowledge is caused by that in the objects; because, that is just the point under discussion. The objects, as they have no luminosity of their own, cannot be apprehended as different from one another. As for knowledge, it is admittedly of uniform nature. How can, then, the variety of consciousness, which is a matter of every body's experience, arise ? Moreover, how can, what is not shining, be made to shine ? Because, causal action of the agent presupposes, on the part of its object, the capacity for that action which the former makes the latter do. For instance, when a driver makes a horse go, he does so because the horse has itself got the capacity to go. Therefore, if the luminosity of the object of knowledge is to be taken to be the result of causal action of the light of knowledge, the object must be supposed to have some luminosity of its own. And if it be admitted to have that, there would cease to be any essential difference between the Naiyāyika and the Abhāsavādin. The acceptance of this would mean giving up by the Naiyāyika of his original theory of essential difference between knowledge and its object. 

The analogy also of a lamp to show the manner in which an object is illuminated by the light of know ledge, is not quite appropriate. Because, while & lamp shines independently of all objects, knowledge does not. Moreover, a lamp casts its light on the object and thus imparts to the latter its own luminosity, so that the appearance of the object varies with the light; but the opponent does not hold that knowledge affects its object in any such way. 

THEORY OF REMEMBRANCE 

291 

THE POINT OF DIFFERENCE. The chief point of difference between the theory of knowledge of the Abhāsavāda and the rival theories of other systems discussed above, is, that, while, according to latter, the object is separate from the subject and is related to the latter by some such relation as that of the instru mental cause with the effect or that of the illuminator with the illuminated ; according to the Abhāsavāda, subject and object are essentially one and the phenomenon of knowledge is simply a result of their unification, i.e. merging of the object in the subject. It has been pointed out in the preceding chapter how everything is essentially of the nature of consciousness, object being no less so than the subject, and, how phenomenon of knowledge is due to the momentary rise of the subjective and the objective waves, in the sea of the Universal Consciousness. 

Now the question may be asked: if the object is essentially of the nature of consciousness why is it not equally manifest to all the subjects? To this Ābhāsavāda replies that a phenomenon of knowledge is not the result of mere existence of the subject and the object but that of the unification of the two by the relation of identity (tādātmya sambandha). We know that a thing, which is connected with another by such relations as the Mīmāmsakas and the Naiyāyikas suppose to exist between the subject and the object, can exist independently of the related, but not certainly what is connected by relation of identity. This explains why an object always shines on the back-ground of the cognising self, and why, though self-manifest, it is not equally manifest to all. 

REMEMBRANCE. The Trika psychology hinges on its central theory of the permanence of the experiencing self. In fact, the psychological 

292 

CHAPTER IV 

problems are introduced in the philosophical works of the system only to show that their satisfactory explanation is not possible without the assumption of permanence as one of the most essential attributes of the self. The phenomenon of remembrance is supposed to be one of the strongest proofs in its support. In this case also, as in that of the perception, the Buddhist theory is pointed out to be wholly unsatisfactory. We have seen what an important part the remembrance has to play in the determinate perception and so in practical daily life; how the image, which is cut out of the block of sensations, received from an external stimulus, and which as such, is no better than the one on a canvas or in a cinema show, is made into a living one with the material supplied from the already existing stock in the memory; how, unless this image be associated with the past experiences of a similar object, it can neither give rise to any feeling nor to the consequent activity either to gain or to shun it; and lastly, how, without remembrance, no use of language of any kind is possible with regard to any thing whatsoever. 

BUDDHIST THEORY OF REMEMBRANCE. Remembrance is a representative consciousness; it is a mere reproduction of a former state of consciousness. Unlike the indeterminate and the determinate cognitions, it has no object of its own; its object is the same as that of the former experience. For, if it were to have an object of its own it would cease to be remembrance, because, then the consciousness would not be expressible as "that" (sah). 

Here the question arises : if knowledge is a momen tary phenomenon every experience would naturally pass away the very next moment after its coming into being : 

1 

I. P. V., I, 60-1. 

THEORY OF REMEMBRANCE 

293 

how can then there be a representation of a former state of consciousness so as to make the phenomenon of remembrance possible? The assumption of a permanent self cannot explain it. For, even if the self be permanent its experiences shall still have to be admitted to be momentary. This is what the facts of common experience require. Because in remembrance the consciousness of its object is associated with the idea of its absence. We refer to the object of remembrance as "that" and not as "this". But how can we have the idea of absence if the experience together with its object as such be having a continuous existence from the time of its production to that of its reproduction ; or to say the same thing in other words, how can there be any talk of its reproduction which is the characteristic feature of remembrance? The former experience, therefore, with its object, being no more at the time of remembrance, what we require to produce the characteristic consciousness of remembrance is some such thing as can reproduce the object. It is, therefore, assumed that when we have a certain experience, a link of the chain of self-consciousness is affected in a certain way; and because each momentary self-consciousness before its destruction produces a similar one in the next moment, naturally, therefore, the subsequent self-consciousness carries a residual trace (samskāra) of the past experience. This residual trace, when revived at a later time because of a subsequent cognition, which has some common element with a past experience, has the capacity of placing the subject-consciousness of that particular moment in the same relation to the object of the former experience as that in which it was when that experience first took place, exactly as that particular capacity, which is ordinarily known as elasticity, places

294 

CHAPTER IV 

the branch of a tree, which is perforce kept down for some time, back in its former position as soon as it is let off. 

BAUDDHA CRITICISM OF THE NAIYAYIKA THEORY. 

The Bauddha raises the following question to refute the Naiyāyika theory of the self as & permanent substratum of saṁskāra, which as a quality, cannot exist independently: Does the self change as a result of the production of the samskāra or not? In the former case it ceases to be eternal, because eternality and changeability cannot coexist. In the latter case the assumption of sarskāra is useless. But if it be said that it admits of no other change than that of samskāra and as such is different from other changing things, then it is nothing else than a chain of consciousness which, as has been said above, being affected by a stimulus, retains its residual trace and being combined with other factors produces the particular phenomenon of knowledge, called remembrance, at a subsequent time. 

REFUTATION OF THE BAUDDHA THEORY. There are two points to be noted in connection with remembrance here; one, that the consciousness of remem brance is expressed in judgement as "that" and not as "this"; and the other, that all our subsequent activities with regard to the object of remembrance are determined not by mere consciousness of the object as such, but by that of the pleasant or unpleasant experiences with which it was associated at the time of its former knowledge. Thus, if we accept the Buddhist explanation of remembrance as due to mere revival of residual traces of the former knowledge, not only we shall not have its characteristic consciousness "that" but also there will be nothing to determine our subsequent action ; because, the only thing that the residual traces can do is to place the subject in its former relation with that particular object the residual trace 

THEORY OF REMEMBRANCE 

295 

of which has been revived, and if so, there is no reason, why the former subject-object relation having been restored there should not consequently be the former consciousness expressible as "this". Moreover, the residual traces! can represent the object alone and not its former experiences also ; this consciousness, therefore, would lead to no action. The reason is obvious: we try to gain or shun an object according as we know it to have been the cause of pleasure or pain. This knowledge depends upon the representation of the past experience which, according to the Buddhist theory, is not possible. It cannot be assumed here that the residual trace will represent the past experience also, because, according to the Buddhist, self being nothing but knowledge (jñāna), it cannot have the former experience, which is but a form of knowledge, as its object; because, knowledge is self-luminous and cannot become an object of another knowledge (Drk svābhāsā nānyena vedyā). Nor can the Buddhist say that although the experience does not form an object of remembrance yet it seems to do so exactly as an object does in an erroneous perception ; because, the chief feature of remembrance is the true reappearance of the object of former experience in all its associations. Therefore, if the appearance of the object in remembrance be taken to be false, remembrance would cease to be remembrance. It would become an erroneous perception. 

REMEMBRANCE AND ERROR. 

Let us, for the sake of clearness, point out the distinc tion between remembrance and erroneous perception. In the former case the object of mental reaction or inner perception (adhyavasāya) is the same image as was produced by former perception or sense-contact and is associated with all the then experiences. What happens is simply this that the psychic image of the object, which was cognised with 

296 

CHAPTER IVA 

all its distinction of time and place and name and form at the time of the former perception, does not merge again in the Universal Consciousness soon after the perception, but remains with all its associations of time, place and the then momentary manifested perceiver, under a veil as it were, in the permanent aspect of the individual self. The existence of the objective manifestation (Bhāvābhāsa) in this condition is technically known as Samskāra, and its revival consists simply in the removal of the veil from over it, so that as soon as the veil is removed, the object shines in all its past glory and associations. Thus, it is because of the reappearance of the object in all its former associations, particularly that of the time, that the consciousness is expressed as "that". But in the case of the perceptual error what appears is a new form and as such has no association with the past time land, therefore, is referred to as "this". The fact is, as we have already pointed out, that the mind is very quick in its work of carving an image out of the block of sensations and completing it in an unspeakably short time with the material taken from the old stock of memory. Thus, the image that appears in the mirror of Buddhi at the time of an erroneous perception is erroneous, not because it has no existence, nor even because it is not made up of the material supplied by an external stimulus, but because the material taken from the old stock of memory is so much that the little that is taken from the block of sensations may be considered to be too insignificant to justify its being called and considered to be an image of an external object. It is this little material taken from the immediate sensations which accounts for only a certain kind of affection of consciousness at the sight of a certain object even in erroneous perception ; but for this, it would be difficult to explain why at the sight of a mother-of-pearl there is the erroneous perception of silver only and of nothing else. 

THEORY OF REMEMBRANCE 

297 

To clear the point in hand further, it may be pointed out here that imagination is still a different thing from both remembrance and erroneous knowledge, because it is due neither to unveiling of an already existing image with all its associations, as in the case of remembrance, nor to building up of an image with material mostly taken from the old stock of memory, but a perfectly independent creation of the mind without any element taken from the immediate external stimulus, if there be any, and without any clear association with the past time. It is because of the new presentations in the erroneous perception and the imagination that their objects are conceived as "this". But the consciousness of the object of remembrance is expressed as "that" because it is a mere representation. 

THE TRIKA THEORY OF REMEMBRANCE. Remembrance is a complex phenomenon. It requires an object, not a new presentation but a reproduction or representation of what has already been an object of some kind of determinate cognition. Further, in order that this object may lead to the characteristic judgement of remembrance that", and determine the activity of an individual rememberer with regard to itself, the remembrance requires the represented object to be associated with the time of its former perception and with the feelings of pleasure or pain which it then aroused. The Buddhist explanation, based on the assumption of samskāra, can place the momentary subject-consciousness in the same relation to the object in which it was on the occasion of the perception, but it can neither account for the characteristic judgement "that" nor the future activity with regard to the remembered. The Trika, therefore, puts forth the theory of unification of the abhāsas.

CHAPTER IV 

THE REMEMBERING SUBJECT. 

The limited individual self, as we pointed out before, has two aspects, the momentary and the permanent. The first dissolves with the dissolution of the momentary identification with the body etc. ; but the second lasts even through universal dissolution (Pralaya). And the objects of determinate cognition, i. e. the images made up of the material taken from the sense presentations and the old stock of memory, are also of two kinds. Some merge back into Universal Consciousness soon after the cognition but others continue to have separate existence with their associations of time, place and limited momentary individual perceiver, with which they were manifested as separate from the Universal Consciousness at the time of the former perception. They remain wrapped up, as it were, in the veil of darkness, (Shall we say they exist in a subconscious state ?) in the permanent aspect of the individual self exactly in the manner in which the ābhāsas which get merged back into the Universal Consciousness live there. An object in this state is technically called samskāra as we have already pointed out. 

(Yo bhāvah pūrvam anubhavakāle taddeśakālapramā trantarasācivyena prthak krto na ca ahantāyām eva vilīni krtah sa tādrg eva tamasevācchádya avasthāpitah samskāra sabdavācyah 

I. P. V., I. 118-9). 

(Etena punah smặtivişayam anāgatya bhāvajātam ahantāyām eva līyata iti dyotitam. (Bhaskarī) 

The remembering subject has got full power to unite or disunite the ābhāsas of which it is a permanent abode just as the Universal Consciousness has over those which it contains withinTHEORY OF REMEMBRANCE 

299 

THE REMEMBERED OBJECT. 

Remembrance is a determinate knowledge and as such cannot have an object of its own, because all the determina tive activity is a kind of reaction on what has already been mirrored on Buddhi (grhīta grahaņa svabhāvatvāt). Its object is the same as that of the former experience. From the time of the direct perception to that of remembrance, this object, this psychic image, has a separate veiled existence in the permanent limited perceiver and, being revived at the sight of something similar, reappears. 

THE OBJECTIVITY OF THE REMEMBERED EXPLAINED. 

The remembered is not an object in the sense that it is illumined by the light proceeding from the remembering self, because it is an essential part of the experience itself, which, being a kind of knowledge Jñāna), is self-luminous and as such cannot be the object of another knowledge. Now naturally the question arises: if not in the above sense in what sense is it an object, or rather if the experience is self shining and so is the object, how is it connected with remembrance ; in short, how does the phenomenon of remem brance arise ? The Trika replies that when the revival takes place the object shines as associated with the time of its former perception and the feelings of pleasure or pain which it then aroused. This is united with the momentary self-luminous self as identified with the body or the vital air etc. according to the nature of the thing remembered. 

This remembering self also has its own limitation of time of its manifestation. Thus when the constituent and the associated ābhāsas of the object of former experience are united with those of the limited self of the time of remembrance there arises a new phenomenon, called remembrance, similar to! that which is produced by hundreds of small lights shining 

300 

CHAPTER IV 

together at one place. The object of the former experience is called the object of remembrance because at the time of remembrance it shines in the additional light of the self luminous remembering self. It is called object of remem brance exactly in the manner in which an object, though illumined by various lights, is said to have been illumined by the one which illumines it in such a manner as is necessary for the immediate purpose. 

This unification of abhāsas is responsible for the peculiar consciousness of the object as that", because in remem brance there is the consciousness of both the times i.e. the time of the first appearance of the object in the past perception and that of its reappearance now in the additional light of the momentary remembering self as associated with the present time : 

Tadānīntanāvabhāsana prthakkrta sarīrādi sambandham anavadhūyaiva hi tatprakāśaḥ. Tataśca idānīntanāvabhāsana kālaparāmarsopi na nimilati iti etat parāmarsa bhitti prādha nyena pūrva kāla parāmarśaḥ, iti viruddha pūrvāpara parāmarśa svabhāva eva "sa" iti parāmarśa ucyate. 

I. P. V., I, 119. Another point of interest in this explanation is that, according to this system, the object of the former experience can reappear with all its associations of past feelings of pleasure or pain, that it then generated, and be a prompter of the subsequent activities of the perceiver without involving the violation of the principle that one knowledge does not shine as an object of another ; because, the Trika theory of unification of ābhāsas as the cause of remembrance does not place the former experience in the relation of an object to remembrance. According to this, the self-luminousness of the experience, which reappears at the time of remembrance, 

1. I. P. V., 1, 124. 

THEORY OF REMEMBRANCE 

301 

remains as much unaffected as the light of a lamp does remain even at the time when it illumines its former object in conjunction with other new lights. This unification of ābhāsas is the work of the permanent limited perceiver, who is no other than the Maheśvara, now called by a different name, because of his appearing as the remembering self, which retains within, all the former experiences with their associated objects, and appears at the time of remembrance", as identical with the body or the vital air etc. according to the need of the occasion. 

Thus the Trika seems to give a satisfactory explanation of English words "recollect" and remember" which stand for the activities of the self) involved in the production of the phenomenon, we are discussing. It is a recollection, because it requires the old separately manifested ābhāsas to be collect ed again as we pointed out above. And it is a remembrance because it involves the reunification into one whole of the old ābhāsas of the time of perception with the new ones of remembrance i. e. the old ābhāsas which formed constituent parts (members) of the former complex ābhāsa which served as the object of perception, are again made the necessary constituents of the new complex ābhāsa of remembranee.

CHAPTER V. THE THEORIES OF EFFECTABILITY CAUSAL 

AND KARMA. 

THE ABHĀSAVĀDA AND THE PHYSICAL PHENOMENA. 

The two powers of the Maheśvara, namely, the powers of knowledge and action (jñāna and kriyā sakti) are most prominently mentioned in the Saiva literature. The Pratya bhijña Vimarsinī, for instance, is primarily concerned with the exposition of these two powers in its first two voluminous adhikāras. In the preceding chapter we have dealt with the power of knowledge. In this, therefore, we propose to give a brief idea of the power of action. 

The? Ābhāsavādins, like some of the modern thinkers, have conceived the universe as broadly consisting of mind and matter. They attribute the psychological phenomena, as we have shown in a preceding chapter, to the omniscience (jñātrtva sakti) of the All-inclusive Universal Consciousness (Parā samvid) and the physical to another similar universal power, namely, omnipotence (Kartstva sakti). “Kriyāsakti" is an aspect of the latter. We have shown in the third chapter how it is responsible for such manifestations as give rise to the idea of action. Here we shall show how it manifests physical phenomena in general. 

This conception of the Kriyā sakti forms the chief point of difference between the different schools of Buddhism and the Abhāsavāda. For, the former, perhaps finding it impossible to explain the variety of experiences referring to the same thing at different times, have confined themselves 

1. 

I. P. V., II, 134-5. 

THEORY OF EFFECTABILITY 

303 

solely to the explanation of the knowability of the "knowable". They are significantly silent about what happens to the object after it ceases to be the object of a perception and why it is that every time we perceive it there is found some difference in it; or rather, what it is that causes the difference in the thing which in its turn brings about a change in percep tion. If, for instance, we take the subjectivists, who hold that each cognition is due to the waking up of a certain vāsanā, we find that they have failed to explain why only a certain vāsanā wakes up at a certain time and no other : 

"Na vāsanāprabodhotra vicitro hetutāmiyāt Tasyāpi tatprabodhasya vaicitrye kim nibandhanam" 

I. P. V., I, 165. Similarly, if we take the case of the Bāhyārthānumeyavādin, we find that though he accounts for difference in cognition by saying that it is due to difference in the external inferrable object, yet he too is silent as to why there is this change in the object itself. 

EFFECTABILITY. The thinkers of the Trika had noticed this weak point in the earlier systems and, therefore, took enough pains in their presentation of the system to explain this side also of the problem of human experience. In addition to the relation of knowability of the contents of the All-inclusive Universal Consciousness to its power of knowledge, they believe in another relation, which for want of a better word we call here the relation of effectability to another aspect of the same Universal Consciousness, namely, the power of action. The relation of knowability in this case consists in these contents being the objects of the operation of the power of knowledge of the Universal Consciousness, which at the time of each cognition manifests some object or objects out of the mass, which lies merged within, as 

304 

CHAPTER V 

separate both from itself and from the individual perceiver. It is momentary. But the relation of effectability is constant, so that even when the object is not being known, that is, not being manifested as apparently separate from the Universal Consciousness to an individual perceiver, it does not altogether lose its separate existence; because it is still the object of operation of the power of action which involves its separate existence no less than does the power of knowledge. Just as the latter (the power of knowledge) is concerned with giving rise to the subjective and objective waves in the sea of the Universal Consciousness and uniting them so as to give rise to the phenomena of knowledge, so the power of action may be said to be concerned with effecting that which is necessary for the rise of the objective wave. To make the point clear let us suppose that each object of the physical universe is like an under-current or sub-current, which at times, because of the influence of the power of knowledge appears as a wave over the surface of the sea of Universal Consciousness and serves as one of the necessary constituents of a phenomenon of knowledge. Therefore, just as the under current is not co-existent with the wave so the physical phenomenon is not (co-existent) with the psychological, which is based upon the former. That power which produces the innumerable currents and keeps them going is the power of action: (Kriyāśakti.)

THEORY OF CAUSALITY 

305 

THE PHYSICAL UNIVERSE AND THE ULTIMATE 

REALITY On the basis of what we have stated above it would not be wrong to say that the Trika conceives the Ultimate Reality not only as Universal Consciousness but also as Universal Energy. It is the latter, which, because of the Creative Desire (icchāvaśāt) appears in the forms of the innumerable physical phenomena much in the same way as the electric energy, because of the resistance, appears in the form of various lights. The Universal Energy and the Creative Desire, working in the aforesaid manner represent "kriya śakti". Thus the physical universe, with all its varieties, is a mere manifestation of the Universal Energy and is connected with it exactly in the manner in which light is connected with electric energy. Just as innumerable lights, being mere forms of electricity, do not break up its unity, so the physical phenomena leave the unity of the Universal Energy undisturbed : 

"Eșa cānanta saktitvād ayam ābhāsayatyamūn Bhāvān icchāvaśād eşā kriya nirmātstāsya sā." 

Eșa purānah pramātā amūn bhāvān ābhāsitapūrvān ābhāsamānān ābhāsayati avichinnena prabandhena, katham, icchāyā iśiturabhinnāyā avikalparūpāyā akramāyā vašena sāmarthyena. Kutrāsya te bhāvāh sthitāh ? āha "ananta Śaktitvāt" iti, viśve hi bhāvāstasyaiva Śaktirüpeņa svarūpāt matvena sthitāh" 

I. P. V., II, 136. 

CAUSALITY. The Trika conception of causality is not the same as that of the Satkāryavāda of the Sankhya, which holds that the effect is present in the cause exactly as oil is in a sesame seed, nor as that of the pūrvāparībhāvavāda of the Bauddha, which holds that of the two things, which come in the order of invariable immediate precedence and succession, the former 

1 .39 

306 

CHAPTER V 

is the cause and the latter is the effect. It is different from the Naiyāyika concept which differentiates between the material and the instrumental causes even in reference to the universal creation, as well as from that of a certain school of the Vedānta, which holds that the Brahman, as pure consciousness, without the power of control, is the cause of the universe. 

It may be of interest to note in this connection that there is a complete agreement between the Sānkara Vedānta and the Trika in respect of the nature of the ultimate cause of the universe. Both hold it to be not only all-inclusive but also all-controlling. In support of this opinion we quote below some interesting passages from the Pratya bhijña Vimarsins and the Sānkara Bhāşya on the Vedānta Sūtra for a comparative study : 

"Nanvetāvatā vijñānam eva brahmarūpam imām viśva rūpatāvaicitrīm parigrhņātu kim īśvaratāparikalpanayā ? ityāśankyāha" 

"Vastavepi cidekatve na syād ābhāsabhinnayoh Cikīrşālakṣaṇaikatvaparāmarsam vinā kriyā. 

............Tasmāt vāstavam cidekatvam abhyupagamyāpi tasya kartrtvalakşaņā bhinnarüpa samāveśātmikā kriyā nopapadyate parāmaršalaksanam tu svātantryam yadi bhavati tadopapadyate sarvam, parāmarso hi cikīrşā rūpā icchā tasyām ca sarvam antarbhūtam nirmā tavyam abhedakalpenāste 

I. P. V., II, 178-81. 

and "Prathamedhyāye sarvajñaḥ sarveśvaro jagata utpatti kāraṇam mrtsuvarnadaya iva ghatarucakādīnām, utpannasya jagato niyantrtvena sthitikāraṇam māyāvīva māyāyāh" 

V. S. S. Bh, 345. 

THEORY OF CAUSALITY 

307 

"Brahmāsya jagato nimittakāranam prakrtiśca ityetasya pakşasyākṣepah smrtinimittah parihstah." V. S. S. Bh, 354. 

Like the Buddhist, the Trika also holds that the 'apparent' is momentary. Its conception of causality, how ever, is different, because the process which, according to this system, leads to the phenomenal existence is so. It holds that the Universal Energy under the influence of the Creative Desire appears in the forms of innumerable objects of the universe which, before their external manifestation exist within the Universal Consciousness exactly as our own ideas do within ourselves, when we are about to deliver a very thoughtful speech. The life of each object, with all its innumerable changes, is constituted by a separate current of that Universal Energy which manifests itself in the innumerable successive forms, each of which represents a separate moment of existence in the so called life of that object. These forms come one after another with such quickness or velocity that their succession is not marked. Rather, the impression is that the same object is having continuous existence, as it is in the case of the flame of a lamp or in that of moving figure in a cinema-show. 

Creation, according to this system, takes place in two ways. It may be in a regular order of successive manifesta tions according to the universal law, technically called Niyati, which fixes the order of invariable immediate precedence and succession in which the things, which are conceived as related to each other by the relation of cause and effect, ordinarily appear. All the effects ordinarily take place in this way. A seed, for instance, appears as a gigantic tree after the successive manifestations of sprout etc. Or it may be in contravention of this law of Niyati i. e. without any succession of manifestations as also without any ordinarily necessary material, as for instance, when a 

308 

CHAPTER V 

yogin creates a city with all its palatial buildings and beautiful gardens, with all kinds of living beings, by sheer force of his supernatural power. In all manifestations working of the sentient principle is the most important factor. This being so, the Trika naturally holds that the causal relation, as it is ordinarily conceived, is a mere convenient conventional assumption based upon what is apparent and, therefore, cannot refer to reality. The real relation between the manifestor and the manifested is not that of cause and effect in the sense that the former constitutes the material of the latter, as does the Prakrti of all her evolutes, according to the Sankhya ; nor in that the manifestor works upon something that exists independently of it, as the God of the Naiyāyikas does on the independent atoms. The relation is similar to that which exists between the thinking self and the thought; it is a subject-object relation (kartrkarmabhāva sambandha). 

The Trika concept of causality offers one explanation for all kinds of creations or manifestations. It is the same energy, it says, which is the cause of the sudden (akramika) and the successive (kramika) as well as the universal and the limited creations or manifestations. It tells us of the most essential common factor in all. It also explains the basis of the popular conception of the material cause of an effect in ordinary creation. Because, ordinarily whatever in variably unconditionally and immediately precedes the existence of & certain thing, is taken to be the material cause of what follows, provided that the qualities, which characterise the one that precedes, characterise also the other that follows.3 A seed, for instance, is taken to be 

1. I. P. V., II, 150-1. 2 T. A. VI, 30. 3 T. A. VI, 10.THEORY OF CAUSALITY 

309 

the cause of a sprout. And according to the Trika conception also of the causality, in the Niyati-controlled creation, the form, which is ordinarily taken to be the material cause of what follows, must precede that which is taken to be its effect, exactly as it must, according to the Satkāryavāda. 

NECESSITY FOR SUCH A SUPPOSITION From what has been stated above it follows that the causal relation is in reality nothing but the subject-object relation. ("Kartr karmatva tattvaiva kārya kāramatā tatah" 

T. A., Comm. 24). It is the Universal Energy, which, being moulded by the Creative Desire, appears in the multifarious forms of the objective universe, just as the clay does in the forms of a jar, a dish and a cup and so on, as the potter's will moulds it. Let it not, however, be forgotten that the Universal Energy and the Creative Desire are non different from the Universal Consciousness. They can, at the most, be spoken of as the different aspects of the same Ultimate Reality. 

Action is of two kinds. The one relates to an object and the other is confined within the agent. In the former case a conscious relation of the agent with the object, to which his action relates, is necessary. A potter, for instance, must have conscious relation with what he intends to produce. Both the theories of causality, namely, the Satkāryavāda of the Sankhya and the Asatkāryavāda of the Nyāya and others, therefore, cannot stand. For, how can the insentient, which is devoid of the capacity of placing itself in a conscious relation with that object, to which its productive activity relates, produce an effect? The two, the seed and the sprout, are separate from each other, and, being insentient, are self-confined, i. e. there is no conscious relation similar to that which exists between the potter and the 

310 

CHAPTER V 

jar, that is to be created, so that if such things be supposed to be related to each other as cause and effect, there is no reason why any two things should not be supposed to be so related ?1 Moreover, if the essential nature of the effect before it comes into being is non-existence, as the Nyāya holds, it can never become existent in any way, for nature does not change ; but, if it be existence, as the Sankhya maintains, what is then to be effected by the cause. It cannot be said that the cause effects manifestation; for, the same question can be raised with regard to the manifestation also i. e. does the manifestation exist before manifestation or not? If it does, the activity to bring it about ceases to have any meaning. But, if it does not, how can it then be brought about ? For, according to the Satkāryavāda, nothing that does not already exist can be brought about. The Trika, therefore, puts forth its own theory of causality. 

CRITICISM OF THE BUDDHISTIC CONCEPTION 

The Buddhistic causal conception also cannot explain the above difficulty. The Bauddha holds that whenever phenomena happen in a series, each particular phenomenon, as soon as it takes place is invariably followed by another; that of the two phenomena the one that invariably unconditionally and immediately precedes the other is called "the cause" and that which follows "the effect", and that, everything being momentary, the latter is altogether a new production and is in no way materially connected with the former as in the case of the Sārkhya conception of causality, called the Satkāryavāda. The unsoundness of the above view is apparent. For, according to this, there is nothing which can justify one phenomenon being called the cause of another. The invariable precedence cannot be regarded 

1 T. A., VI, 23. 3 I. P. V., II, 139. 

2 T. A., VI, 25 ; 4 1. P. V., II, 168. 

THEORY OF CAUSALITY 

311 

as sufficient reason, for, in that case any two phenomena, one of which is perceived following the other, the two lunar mansions Krttikā and Rohiņi, for instance, shall have to be accepted as being connected by causal relation, or, for that matter, we shall have to suppose the pictures of a cinematographic reel, coming invariably one after the other, as connected with one another by causal relation. The Buddhist cannot say that it is not because of a mere incidence of invariable precedence that one phenomenon is called the cause, but because of its capacity to cause ; and that it is not because of mere succession that the other is called the effect, but because of its capacity to be effected. For, such a causality, in order that it may serve its purpose, presupposes conscious relation of the cause, which has the capacity to effect, with the object of its operation. According to the Buddhist hypothesis, however, the object is non-existent at the time of the causal activity. The causal operation, therefore, because of its being dependent upon its object, would not take place. And even if it be supposed to take place, it would lead to no result because of its being objectless : 

Atha pūrvatā nāma prayojaka sattākatvam parata ca nāma prayojya sattākatvam tarhi bījasya aukura prayoktrī sattā ankura viśrāntā apkurāntarbhāvamātmanyānayati, ankurābhāve prayoktrtva mātram syāt tadapi na kiñcit anyāpeksatvāt tasya. 

I. P. V., II, 168-9. 

CRITICISM OF THE SANKHYA. The exaplanation of the causal relation as given by the Sãrikya is no better. It holds that the cause and the effect are connected by the relation of identity (tādātmya). The defect of the theory is obvious; because, if the seed and the 

1 T. A., VI, 17. 

312 

CHAPTER V 

sprout be supposed to be identical, then the notion of their duality becomes meaningless. Therefore, either the seed or the sprout only can be said to exist; because, identity and separateness cannot co-exist. Thus, according to the Sārkhya also, the causal activity will remain objectless. Nor can the assumption of evolution of one into multifarious forms improve the position of the Sankhya; because, evolution in itself is an action inasmuch as it consists in the assumption of multifarious successive forms by one at different points of time; therefore, if the ultimate nature (prakrti) be supposed to evolve it ceases to be pure material cause. It becomes an agent? (kartr). Nor can it be said that the idea of authorship (kartrtva) of the ultimate nature is not against the Sāükhya conception: for, although the Sārkhya admits the prakrti to be an agent, yet such an admission is in conflict with its own theory of insentiency (jadatva) of the ultimate nature. The chief characteristic of an insentient thing is that it is of a certain fixed appea rance and that by itself it cannot manifest itself in any other than the fixed form. A stone, for instance, cannot assume multifarious forms of a man, a tree and a mountain etc and again after some time regain its original form; therefore, if Prakrti be insentient its manifesting itself in diverse forms at the time of creation and again assuming the state of equilibri um of qualities at the time of universal dissolution would be as impossible as the assumption by stone of its original condition as stated above : 

"Abhinnarūpasya dharmiņah satatapravahadbahutara dharmabhedasambheda svātantryalakṣaṇam pariņamana kriyākartrtvam yaduktam tat pradhānāderna yuktarh jada tvāt, jado hi nāma parinişthitasvabhāvah prameyapada patitah."

1. I. P. V., II, 173. 2. I. P. V., II, 174. 

THEORY OF CAUSALITY. 

313 

CRITICISM OF THE VEDĀNTIN'S THEORY. Even the assumption of the principle of pure Cit as the cause of the universe cannot explain the manifest variety. Manifestation is a causal action and as such necessarily pre supposes desire and this in order that it may lead to some definite action, must have an object of its own. This object before creation cannot have existence apart from the desiring self. It has, therefore, necessarily to be supposed to be one with the Self much as the words, that we utter, are one with ourselves at the time when we are preparing ourselves for some utterances. Hence the manifestation of the universe by pure Cit is out of question. 

THE TRIKA THEORY OF CAUSALITY. In opposition to the Suddhabrahmavādin, the exponents of the Trika, therefore, hold that the Ultimate Reality is Prakāśavimarśamaya i. e. it is not only all-inclusive but also all-controlling?. It is by virtue of the latter aspect that it manifests the universe, which is ever within itself in the form of universal energy, as apparently separate from itself on the back-ground of itself without losing its oneness, much in the same manner as that in which a mirror manifests what is reflected on it. The most important difference between the two cases is that, while, in the case of an ordinary mirror, reflections are cast by an external object, in that of the mirror of the Universal Consciousness they are caused by its own powers (saktis) which constitute different aspects of its Svātantrya saktis. 

Thus, according to the Trika, all that we see is a mere manifestation of the Universal Energy under the control of the Creative Desire. When for instance, a seed develops into

a sprout, it is the Universal Unergy underlying the seed soil and water etc. that manifests itself as a sprout; or when a potter, who also is a manifestation of the same energy, makes a jar, it is the Creative Desire that works through him on the Universal Energy, underlying the so called instrumental and material Causes, and, according to the law of Niyati, brings the jar into existence through various stages, 

THE TRIKA THEORY OF KARMA. Here it may be asked: if it is the Creative Desire that is working in and through the individual, if all that is accomplished is the work not of the individual but of the Universal Self, how can then any merit or demerit attach to the former ; how can the individual's experiences, good or bad, be attributed to his previous actions; and how can this concept of Kriyāśakti be reconciled with the acce pted theory of Karma? To this Abhinava replies in the 9th and the 13th Ahnikas of the Tantrāloka. His conclu sion on this point is based on the combined authority of Sambhunātha’ and Somānanda.3 

The theory of karma is meant to explain not only the variety of an individual's associations and experiences and his freedom from them but also the variety that we find in the so called physical universe. Just as individual karma determines individual experiences, so the sum total of all karmas of all the individual selves determines the variety to be found in the physical universe which supplies the necessary stimuli for innumerable experiences. The physical universe is not a capricious creation. It is created with a purpose. Its creation, therefore, is controlled by the necessities of that purpose. It is meant for meeting the innumerable

THEORY OF KARMA 

315 

shades of countless desires of an unimaginable number of limited selves; the selves which are mere limited manifesta tions of, or mere appearances assumed by, the Universal Consciousness by virtue of its power of obscuration (tirodhāna). To assume such appearances, is, according to the ābhāsavāda, as also, according to the monistic Vedānta, a mere sport of the Supreme. 

The limitedness of an individual self consists in the limitation of its powers of knowledge and action. It is called svarūpākhyāti, because it is due to the ignorance of the real nature of the individual self. This limitation necessarily involves another, namely, limitation in desire; for, desire presupposes the knowledge of the desired, and, therefore, cannot refer to what is beyond the reach of knowledge. The latter being limited the former also has necessarily to be so. This limited desire before the creation of the physical universe is objectless; it is a mere eagerness on the part of limited self to use its limited powers. It is the one cause of the future association of the soul with different kinds of bodies suited for its realisation. It is responsible for the limited associations of the limited self. It is the cause of transmigration. It is the root of all actions or Karmas. It does not presuppose a connection with a body, because it is a function of the self and not of the body. If it were not so, a yogin, having once reached the transcendental state i. e. having risen above the limitation of the body, would not be able to resume his connection with the same; because, to break the transcendental state requires a conscious effort which presupposes the rise of desire, so that if the latter were always to presuppose a connection with the body vyuthāna would never take place. This limited desire is called Kārmamala, because it leads to 

1. I. P. V., II, 220. 

316 

CHAPTER V 

action of a limited nature. It is determined by the Lord's will : 

Isvarecchāvaśād asya bhogecchā samprajāyate. Bhogasādhanasamsiddhyai bhogecchorasya mantrarāt Jagadutpādayāmasa māyāmāvisya saktibhih." 

TA., Comm., VI, 56. 

The limitation of desire is as beginningless as that of the powers of knowledge and action; and both are due to the All-Controlling Universal Will. Not only this, even the freedom from these limiting conditions and the regaining of godhead are due to the same cause. It cannot be objected that if the Lord be responsible for the variety of limitation in respect of powers of knowledge and action and therefore of desire and other conditions and circumstances, in which we find the living beings, it would naturally follow that He is partial and cruel ; for, some He has placed in very favourable circumstances, but others in the extremely adverse; some He has made so happy that they are envied by all who see them, but others so miserable that their very sight is heart-rending; some He liberates but others He keeps in bondage. The reason is that this is a non-dualistic system and, therefore, the so called differently circumstanced indi. viduals have no being apart from Him. And cruelty is cruelty and so partiality is partiality only if it be done to another. Therefore, according to this system, there being no being having a separate being from the Universal Being, the notion of partiality and cruelty being practised by Him is baseless. 3 Nor can it be questioned why He manifests this apparent diversity. Because to do so is His essential nature and it is absurd to question it. It is as meaningless as asking why fire burns ? 1. T. A., VIII, 74.

KARMA AND CREATION. 

In addition to the three functions of the Brahman accepted by Sankarācārya, who interpreted the Brahma Sūtras according to the teachings of the Upanişads, namely, creation maintenance and dissolution (srsti, sthiti, samhāra) the Trika, in common with all other āgamic schools, believes in two more, namely, obscuration and grace (tirodhāna and anugraha). It has to be very carefully noted here that only the last two functions are independent of Karma. Only the obscuration and the liberation are brought about by the Lord's independent force of will. The rest i. e. creation etc. depend upon the main prompting cause, the Kārmamala, 1 the sum total of the limited desires of the limited selves; because, the satisfaction of these is the only purpose of the creation, as we have already pointed out above. In fact, in the Tantrāloka the question is raised as to why the creation etc. also are not attributed to the free will of the Lord, and why the malas are assumed to be the prompting causes? And Abhinava has replied to this as follows: 

The Creation is of two kinds, the impure and the pure i. e, with and without limitation. In the latter case Siva himself is the creator and it is the work purely of His independent power of will. But the former is created by Ananta, who requires prompting causes, the malas, to determine his creative activities. ("Nanu yadyevam tat kim ebhih antargaduprāyaih malādibhih, īśvarecchaiva viśvasargādau nirapeksā nimittam astu ityāśankya āha :

T. A., VIII, Comm., 76-7.) 

In our humble opinion, therefore, in view of what has been stated above, Prof. Radhakrishnan's statement in the very brief summary of the Pratyabhijñā system in his Indian Philosophy, requires some modification in respect of the prompting causality of Karma in creation. His statement runs as follows: 

"The existence of a prompting cause, like karma, or material cause, like praksti, for the creation of the world is not admitted. Nor is Māyā the principle which creates illusory forms. God is absolutely independent, and creates all that exists by the mere force of His will." 

I. Ph. Vol. II 732. 

As regards the quotation from the Pratyabhijñā Vimar sinī, given by the learned professor, we may point out that it is connected with the discussion on the theory of perception and is meant to show how the objective wave is suddenly given rise to at the time of perception. And the illustration of yogin refers to the sudden creation (akrami kābhāsa) i. e. creation in violation of the law of Niyati, and is meant to show that this system does not believe in the material cause, like atoms, of the objective universe. ThisTHEORY OF KARMA 

319 

point we have already discussed at some length in the preceding pages, and we think that the Professor means to substantiate by this quotation only that part of his statement which denies a separate material cause and not that which is concerned with the denial of Karma as a prompting cause of the creation. And if so, we fully agree with him on that point. 

It may be pointed out here that Sankara agrees with Abhinava that the creation of universe is merely a sport of the Lord, that sportiveness is His nature and is unquestionable and that the grace is solely dependent upon the Lord's will. To support this statement we may give the following extracts from Thibaut's translation of the Sānkara Bhāşya : 

"But (Brahman's creative activity) is mere sport such as we see in common life" 

............ We see in every day life that certain doings of princes and other men of high position, who have no unfulfilled desires left, have no reference to any extraneous purpose, but proceed from mere sportfulness, as for instance, their recreations in places of amusement ............ Analogously, the activity of the Lord also may be supposed to be mere sport, proceeding from his own nature without reference to any purpose. For on the ground neither of reason nor of scripture can we construe any purpose of the Lord. Nor can His nature be questioned." (356-7) 

"And if we are asked how we come to know that the Lord in creating this world with its various conditions, is not bound by regards, we reply that scripture declares that. Compare, for instance, the two following passages. "For He (the Lord) makes him, whom He wishes to lead up from these worlds, do a good deed." (359) 

320 

CHAPTER V 

No doubt, this passage speaks of the grace being dependent upon the action of the recipient (Prāņikarma sāpekşam eva iśvarasyānugrahītrtvam), but the question is: on what does the action itself depend? Does it not on the Lord's will? How can then the ultimate dependence of the grace on the Lord's will be denied ? 

Thus, when, in accordance with the limitations of powers of knowledge, action and desire, an individual self gets associated with body, senses, vital air and mind and is placed in the requisite circumstances for the realisation of the limited desire, the universal will works through it. In reality, therefore, the individual self is not independent in its action nor does any merit or demerit, consequent upon the so called pious or sinful acts, attach to it ; because, their piety and sinfulness are imaginary and conventional. But among other effects of the universal will, there is this also that under its influence the individual self arrogates the authorship (kartstva) of the actions, so performed, to itself and is perfectly oblivious of the fact of its being simply a tool of the universal will. It is this self-arrogation of the individual which is responsible for the attachment of merit and demerit. On this the idea of the individual piety or sinfulness is based. 

One can very pertinently ask here : why is the limited desire of the individual self spoken of as Karma and whether it is not strange to suppose the Lord to be perfectly independent in some of His functions but in others to be entirely dependent upon mala etc.? To the former Abhinava replies that Karma is that which results in some limited experience and so in further obscuration of the real 

1. 2. 

T. A., VIII, 70. I. P. V., II, 149 

THEORY OF KARMA 

321 

nature of the experiencer. It is a different matter that in the ordinary use the word means something else: 

"Karma tallokarudham hi yadbhogam avaram dadat Tirodhatte bhoktộrūpam samjñāyām tu na no bharah." 

T. A., VIII, 161. 

The limited desire of the limited individual is, therefore, spoken of as karma because it is the primary cause of all kinds of its associations and experiences, as shown above. And to the latter question he replies that it is unreasonable to assume one and the same thing to be productive of opposite effects. How can a thing, which is the cause of bondage, be the cause of liberation also ? It is to satisfy the demand of reason that the Trika holds the Lord's grace, independent of any thing that is connected with mala, māyā and karma, to be the only cause of liberation : 

"Anusvarūpatāhānau tadgatām hetutām katham Vrajenmāyānapekṣatvam ata evopapādayet." 

T. A., VIII, 77. KARMA DEFINED. 

It is necessary here to point out the distinction between the Kārmamala and the Karmasaskāra. The former is the limited desire, as we have just stated, which is responsible for the future limited association of an individual self, after the Mahāpralaya, when the universe is created anew. The latter, the Karmasaṁskāra, is a certain effect that is produced on a limited self; an effect, not that which, being revived, is responsible for the rise of phenomenon of remembrance, but that which is caused by the personal conviction of the potentiality of a particular action to lead to certain experiences at the time of its maturation. Both these, the Kārmamala and the Karmasamskāra, may be spoken of as two aspects 

1. T. A., VI, 85 

41 

322 

CHAPTER V 

of the same thing. In fact, when the distinction of the former from the latter is not intended to be emphasised i. e. when the idea of both of them is intended to be conveyed, the simple word "Karma" is used. Karma in general, there fore, means that unseen factor which is responsible for the difference in the fruition of the same action done by a number of persons. Certain boys join the same school, are placed under the same teacher, are given the same facilities and opportunities, and read the same courses for the same number of hours daily, but the result is not the same in all cases. Why ? Certain children are born to certain parents, their surroundings are the same; the care that the parents bestow on each is the same and there is no difference in their external life. Will the result be the same in all cases ? And if not, why? The Trika, in common with other systems of Indian philosophy, replies that it is due to Karma! in general, as defined above. 

CONDITIONS NECESSARY FOR FRUITION OF KARMA. 

Karma is like a seed and as such does not fructify soon after it is sown. It requires the fertile soil of self-arrogation? and the manure of similar actions to help its growth; there fore, unless a person arrogates an action to himself it would not fructify. In fact, this is the chief point of distinction between the two kinds of experiencers, the pralayākalas and the vijñānākalas. The former arrogate their action to them selves and, therefore, are affected by the impurity called kārmamala, but the latter do not and so are free from it. It is this very absence of self-arrogation that keeps the persons, who are out of their senses, unaffected by the actions done in that state, as all the scriptures unanimously declare. The 

1. T. A., VI, 98. 2. T. A., VI, 85. 3. T. A., VI, 86. 

THEORY OF KARMA 

323 

self-arrogation is thus the soil without which the seed of Karma cannot grow. 

THE ASSOCIATED IDEA AND FRUITION. 

The result of an action, however, even when it is associated with the self-arrogation, is not always the same. It is greatly influenced by the associated ideas. When, for instance, a person practises certain austerities and desires that their fruit should go to the other person for whom he performs them, it is the other that gets the fruit and not the per former. This idea is common to most of the religions. It is on this that engaging of the priests for prayer, fasting and other kinds of austerities to effect a certain desired end is based. Leaving the religious questions aside, if we analyse our daily experiences we find that the nature of the effect of an action in the form of a mental state of some kind depends not on the action itself but on the idea with which it is associated. Suppose, for instance, that two new motor cars are driven by two different persons; one is a servant, driving his master to a certain place, and the other is the owner himself. The act of driving is the same; both the cars are equally new; they are of the same maker and have similar accessories; but will the pleasure of driving be the same in both the cases, and if not, why? Is not the difference due to the associated ideas? Is not the littleness of the servant-driver's joy, as compared to that of the master, in driving a new car, due to the association of the idea of service ? Thus, as in ordinary life so in the sphere of religion and morality, an act by itself is productive of no fruit; its productivity differs with the difference in the associated ideas.

CHAPTERI V 

DIFFERENT STATES OF KARMA 

Karma is associated not with the body but with the limited self, and, therefore, is not destroyed with the destruction of the body. It transmigrates with the soul and determines the soul's associations with the future body and its circumstances. It waits till it gets circumstances favourable for its growth and then it asserts itself. The state of Karma, when it is about to assert itself, is called the state of its maturity. When once this state is reached, nothing can stop it from running its course. Even self-realisation cannot prevent it from fruition. Even the enlightened souls have to undergo the experiences which follow the maturity of Karma. Even they cannot escape it. It is this maturity of the past karma which is responsible for the difference in the result of the same action done by a number of persons, as in the above stated case of school children. This state of Karma is technically called "Phalonmukhata" As opposed to this, there is the other state in which, the circumstances being extremely unfavou rable for its growth, a karma remains dormant; it is called "Phalānunmukhatā". The fructifiability of a karma in the latter state can be destroyed by a counter-action such as charity austerity and knowledge. The preventive measures against the fructification of Karma are like inoculations to safeguard a person against the attack of a certain disease. And just as inoculation, though effective, if it be done long before the attack, is yet useless when the attack has come, so charity, austerity and penance can prevent the fruition of a karma, only if they be done long before its maturity or Phalonmukhatā. But they are of no use when it has attained maturity. The mature 

1. T. A. VI, 103. 2. T. A., VI, 102. 

THEORY OF KARMA 

325 

Karma is like a boulder, slipped from the top of a mountain, which knows no obstruction and must have its course till it reaches a table land. 

KARMA AND LIBERATION. 

The destruction of karma is one of the most essential antecedent conditions of the liberation of soul. But let it be noted here that, according to this system, this is neither the only condition nor is this in itself Mokşa. Even when the karma is destroyed there remains another impurity, called āņavamala, associated with the self; and so long as this also is not destroyed there can be no emancipation. In fact, the only difference between the experiencer, known as Vijñānākala and Siva, is, that, while both are equally free from karma, the former has still got the anavamala but the latter is free from that also. This is another point of difference between the Vedānta and the Trika conceptions of Mokşa. According to the former, liberation means simply liberation from the bondage of karma (Naişkarmya), but, according to the latter, it means freedom from both kārma and anava malas. It cannot be objected here that if the āņavamala is the cause of the association of the soul with karma why does not Vijñānakevala get into the bondage of karma ? Because in the Vijñānākala state the āņavamala is about to be destroyed and, therefore, loses its causal efficiency". 

HOW IS THE DESTRUCTION EFFECTED ? 

We have pointed out above that the individual self is not free in its volition and action. These are the universal powers of will and action which are working in and through the individual. It is thus a mere tool and not a free agent. 

1. T. A., VI, 77. 2. T. A., VI, 79-80 

326 

CHAPTER V 

Under the influence of His will, however, it arrogates to itself the authorship of all that is done through the body with which it has identified itself. But, when through His grace true light dawns upon it, it realises its oneness with the Universal Self. As a necessary consequence of self realization, the identification with the body, together with the effect of self-arrogation of the deeds done in the state of ignorance (Moha) comes to an end. The fruition of the past action, therefore, naturally becomes out of question. This? nullification of the effect of self-arrogation of action which follows the cessation of identity of the self with the body, is technically called karmadāha in the Trika literature : 

"Karmaņaśca iyān dāho yad dehāhambhāvasamskāraguņi bhāvo nāma iti, sa ca vaiśvātmyam asritāyām samyidi ātmābhimānasya mukhyatvād bhavet ityuktam." 

T. A., Comm., VI, 108. 

CRITICISM OF THE RIVAL THEORY OF THE SANKHYA. 

According to the Sāükhya, liberation is nothing but the cessation of the activity of prakrti towards a particular puruşa. But it may be asked: if puruşa is never really affected in any way and is simply pure consciousness, (puşkara palāśavannirlepah kintu cetanah) in itself it must ever be the same; why is it then that prakrti is not active towards the so called liberated ? It cannot be said that the activity of praksti requires the presence of the old habits of experience of Buddhi (karmasamskāra) as a prompting cause, and because all the samskāras of the past actions of the liberated are destroyed, there is, therefore, nothing to prompt prakrti to work for the liberated; for, the opponent then may be asked : "what is it that is responsible for the destruction of 

1. T. A., VI, 106-7. 2. T. A., VI, 108. 

THEORY OF KARMA 

327 

saņskāras ?" It cannot be experience of the fruit by the doer, because experience in itself is an act and, therefore, rather than destroying the samskāras, would lead to the formation of another. Nor can the knowledge be the cause of destruction, because if the word "knowledge" means something which is to be got by performing the acts of piety, enjoined by the scripture, then it is only a fruit of a certain action and as such cannot rightly be represented to be the cause of destruction of the past karmas. For, if fruition of one action is supposed to destory another action there is no reason why fruition of those actions, by virtue of which one attains heaven, should not destroy those which result in knowledge. Nor can this be said that knowledge does not destroy karma, but simply sterilises it by removing ignorance, which is the most essential condition of its fruition. For, then the opponent may be asked to state what he means by ignorance. Is it a negation of knowledge which precedes the existence of knowledge (prāgabhāva) or that which follows its destruction (dhvarsa), In the for mer case again, is it the negation of all kinds of knowledge or only of some ? The former position is, of course, impossi ble, for, to deny all kinds of knowledge to a limited self is to deny sentiency and selfhood to it. The latter also is no better, because the absence of some kind of knowledge preceding its coming into being will always exist in the cases of both the bound and the liberated; for, according to the Sankhya, the Puruşa is simply sentient but not omniscient as the real self of the Vedāntin, so that even after liberation it can be spoken of as being without a certain knowledge preceding its existence. Nor can ignorance mean the absence of knowledge consequent upon its destruction, for, such an ignorance there will always be in the case of the liberated. 

1. T. A., VIII, 9. 

328 

CHAPTER V 

But if the opponent were to say that ignorance means not the absence of all knowledge, but simply wrong knowledge, then also it has to be made clear whether its causal relation to the fruition of an action depends upon its presence at the time of performance of the action or at that of the fructi fication. In the latter case, the accepted theory of each creation after dissolution being according to the individual karmas falls to the ground; for, association of a puruşa with a body is a sort of fruition of certain karmas, but how can the karmas fructify unless there be ignorance and how can there be ignorance unless there be the association of self with a body; because ignorance, according to the Sankhya, is a quality of buddhi, an evolute of prakrti, and as such it is non-existent at the time of dissolution. In the former case there is no reason why all karmas should not fructify in the case of the ignorant and the enlighter.ed alike, because the ignorance was present in both the cases at the time of per formance. Nor can it be said that ignorance is co-existent with sentiencyl and because sentiency lasts even through dissolution, ignorance also, therefore, is naturally present; for, in that case it will not be possible to deny the presence of ignorance even in the case of the enlightened ; because the enlightened are no less sentient than the unenlightened and therefore, it would be hard to explain why the karma of of the latter does not fructify. 

SANKHYA CONCEPTION OF IGNORANCE. 

The evolution of Prakrti has got a twofold purpose to serve, namely, (I) to supply the necessary stimuli for the varying experiences which the puruşas have helplessly to suffer or to enjoy, according to their individual karmas, and (II) ultimately to effect their salvation. The former is called 

1. T. A., VIII, 20.THEORY OF KARMA 

329 

bhoga and is due to the identification of the self with Buddhi. The latter is called apavarga and consists in the knowledge of difference between the self and the Buddhi and consequent cessation of the activity of the nature (pradhāna) with reference to a particular self. Bhoga depends upon the arrogation by puruşa of the work of buddhi to itself. Buddhi, according to the Sāökhya, is like a mirror, capable of receiving reflection from both the sides. Its capacity to receive reflection of the external object, however, depends upon its receiving light from puruşa. Thus Buddhi, though insentient in itself, appears to be sentient because of the reflected light. And puruşa too, though in reality indifferent to all the works of prakrti, yet, because of the co-evality of the reflection of the external objects on buddhi with the reflection of its own light, arrogates to itself the agency of assuming the form of the external object, which, in fact, belongs to buddhi. Apavarga similarly depends upon the distinctive knowledge that buddhi is of changing nature and that puruşa is unchangeable and something different from Buddhi. 

The beginningless ignorance of difference between the self and the prakrti is the prompting cause of the evolution of the latter for bhoga. After the rise of the knowledge of distinction, therefore, there remains nothing to prompt it to further action. Hence its evolutive activity towards that particular puruşa, on whom the knowledge has dawned, automatically comes to an end. 

REFUTATION OF THE SANKHYA THEORY. 

From what has been stated it is clear that, according to the Sānkhya, release is nothing but cessation of the evolutive activity of prakrti consequent upon the disappearance of the prompting cause, the ignorance of distinction between 

1. T. A., VIII, 21-2. 

42 

330 

CHAPTERIV 

puruşa and buddhi. But the defect of the Sānkhya theory is obvious. The Sānkhya is silent on the question of the relation of this ignorance. It cannot satisfactorily answer the query : "To whom does the ignorance belong ?" For, it cannot be attributed to puruşa, because that would make freedom from it impossible. Purusa, according to the Sārkhya, does not change. The loss of an attribute certainly means a change in the possessor; therefore, if it be said that ignorance belongs to purusa who loses it at the time of libera tion, the Sankhya theory of unchangeability of the purusa would fall to the ground. But if it be said that it belongs to prakrti, then puruşa being ever free from it, the notion that evolutive activity of prakrti is for the liberation of puruşa becomes absurd. Further, the Sājkhya cannot satisfactorily answer another question : if the ignorance lasts only so long as the knowledge of distinction between puruşa and buddhi does not arise, when does this knowledge arise ? It cannot be said that it arises when all the effects of praksti have been seen, because they are limitless and, therefore, it is impossible to see all of them. Nor can a general knowledge of the nature of praksti's evolute be represented to be the cause of liberation, for, that being possible even from seeing one evolute there is no reason why any puruşa should be in bondage. 

DUALISTIC SAIVA THEORY OF IGNORANCE. 

According to the dualist school of Saivaism, the recog nised exponent of which is Khetapāla, ignorance is some thing like a cover which hides the perfection of self in respect of the powers of knowledge and action. It is one, but possesses innumerable varieties of concealing power. It hides the perfection of each soul by a separate variety of its power. This, according to the dualist Saivas, accounts 

1. T. A., Comm., VIII, 36. 

THEORY OF KARMA 

331 

for the difference in knowledge or ignorance of one soul from that of another. This also explains why at the liberation or destruction of ignorance of one soul, all do not get liberated or enlightened. It is not a creation of māyā, for, if it be so, there would be no reason why māyā should not create it for the liberated also. It is not a mere negation or not-being of knowledge, but a positive entity, because it has the causal efficiency of hiding the perfection of the powers of knowledge and action of the Self. It is beginningless in itself and so is its association with the souls. It is insentient and is the cause of association of karma and māyā with the self. When the concealing power of this ignorance is nullified by divine grace (saktipāta) in the case of a certain soul, it (soul) shines forth in its true glory. This removal of the veil of ignorance, this recovery of the hidden powers, this freedom from all kinds of limitations, is called mokşa, in the dualistic śaiva literature. 

REFUTATION OF THE DUALIST THEORY. 

But what is the cause of the maturity (pāka) or destruc tion of this ignorance? It cannot be action (karma), because it is accepted to be the cause of the variety of pleasant or unpleasant experiences which a person enjoys or suffers. It is, therefore, unreasonable to represent it to be the cause of their cessation also. Nor can the Lord's will be said to be responsible for the said maturity, for, He is free from all partiality, and, therefore, if He be admitted to be the cause of destruction of ignoraace it would be dif ficult to explain why He frees only some and not all. Fur ther, according to the dualist, the ignorance is beginningless and causeless. Assumption, therefore, of its destruction, whatever be its cause, is against our common experience; 

1. T. A., VIII, 30.

CHAPTER V 

for, there is no instance of another thing which though both beginningless and causeless is yet destructible. The not-being of a thing before it actually comes into being, (prāgabhāva) has, of course, to be left out of consideration, because it is a non-entity and as such belongs to a different category from that of the ignorance which is an entitative being and possesses causal efficiency. It cannot be said that there is no destruction of ignorance but that its power falls into abeyance, like the fatal biting power of a snake in a charmed circle, because then there would follow simultaneous liberation of all and there will also be the possibility of all coming again back to bondage at the revival of the concealing power of ignorance. 

There is a further question : how and what does the ignorance conceal ? Souls are eternal and unchangeable. The ignorance, therefore, cannot be supposed to affect them in any way, for, such a supposition would bring them down to the level of transitory things. Therefore, if it be said to conceal powers of knowledge and action by its mere presence in the proximity of the self, then there is no reason why it should not do so in the case of Siva and other liberated souls. Moreover, if it conceals the powers of the self it conceals the very being of self, because self is nothing more than the said powers. How can then we know the very existence of the self? 

DUALIST THEORY OF KARMASĀMYA 

Now, leaving aside the question how and what the concealing power of ignorance conceals, if we were to take into consideration the question, "why does it fall into abeyance ?" we find the dualist's position no better. They hold that the Lord's will, prompted by the equili brium or equipoise of karmas (karma-sāmya), puts in 

THEORY OF KARMA 

333 

abeyance the concealing power of ignorance. The karma sāmya, according to them, is a state of maturity of two equipotential karmas of opposite nature. In this state each of the two karmas is equally mature for fruition, but is prevented from yielding its fruit by another which also is equally mature and is trying to push its way to fruition. Because both are equally strong, therefore, neither can assert itself over the other. And the result is that not only neither of these two can fructify but others also, which would have borne their fruits in ordinary course, are prevented from so doing, because of their way to fruition having, as it were, been stopped by the struggle of the two equipotential karmas. It is a case like that of two equally strong wrestlers trying to push their way through a small door through which only one person can pass at a time. The result is, as we often see at the opening of a barrier to a third class railway booking office window, that neither can pass; and while they are fighting, each trying to assert his right over the other to purchase his ticket first, other poor passengers have helplessly to wait behind. This state is marked by the absence of feeling of both pleasure and pain alike. The reason is obvious, Mind can have only one experience at a time (Yugapaj jñānānutpattir manaso lingam). The fruition of a karma is nothing but an experience. And because two experiences are not simultaneously possible, reasonably therefore, two karmas cannot be supposed to fructify at the same time. Karmasāmya, therefore, according to the dualists, is both natural and logical. 

REFUTATION OF KARMASĀMYA. 

There are three kinds of action, pious, sinful and mixed. Two fructifiable actions cannot take place simultaneously. Because an action, in order that it may have its necessary result, according to the law of karma, must have the 

334 

CHAPTER V 

cooperation of mind, must be associated with some idea. In fact, the moral fruition of an action depends not on the action itself so much as on the associated idea. It is because of this that motiveless action (niskāma karma) does not fructify. As the mind can have only one idea at a time so naturally two fructifiable actions cannot take place simultaneously. The performances of actions being in succession, their maturity also must necessarily be in succession. How can then two actions simultaneously attain maturity and produce karmasāmya ? Further, even if simultaneous maturity of two equipotential actions be admitted, there arises a very important question as to whether other actions do or do not fructify after the karmasāmya. In the former case, inspite of this karmasāmya, the bondage of karma will remain. In the latter case, cessation of the fruition of all actions being necessary, even those actions, which are responsible for the existence of the body, the life, and other circumstances of the liberated, should necessarily stop fruition and, therefore, there should be instantaneous death of the freed. Further, if the equilibrium of two actions can prevent the fruition of all other actions, what does there remain for the Lord's will to accomplish, what is then the Saktipāta assumed for ? Even if saktipāta be assumed to be necessary, the karmasāmya being the same in all cases, it is difficult to account for difference of saktipāta in different cases. The life of renunciation and other religious practices cannot explain it, because the limited selves cannot be assumed to be indepen dent in their performance. For, if it were so, it would be difficult to explain why all do not perform them. If, therefore, it be supposed to be dependent on something else, 

1. T. A., VIII, 49. 

THEORY OF KARMA 

335 that also logically will require something else still as a prompting cause and so on ad-infinitum. 

The Trika, therefore, holds that, while obscuration and liberation are the works of the independent will of the Lord, creation, maintenance and destruction are dependent upon innate ignorance and karma, and that this ignorance is not an insentient independent entity, as conceived by the dualists, but is a production of the Lord's will.1
