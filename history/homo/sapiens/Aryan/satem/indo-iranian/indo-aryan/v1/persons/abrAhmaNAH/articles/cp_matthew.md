The old man in the right in this picture can be easily mistaken for a great priest !!! No! He is Dr. C P. Mathew who was the Head of the Oncology Department at Kottayam Medical College and later principal. On the 'right' is Brahmashree Suryan Subramanian Bhattathiri. üôè

Dr Mathew was the first oncology professor in Kerala, Head of the Oncology Department at Kottayam Medical College and then the principal. Later when he retired he was a flying doctor & visiting professor of allopathic cancer treatment at universities in more than 50 countries. At the age of 60, he decided to unlearn everything he had learnt earlier and accepted a _Lada Vaidyan_ (a physician of traditional tribal medical system), whom he met on the street, as his guru.Then this great doctor saved tens of thousands of cancer patients from death using the Siddha medicine he learned from the late _lada_ guru. Patients he saved include many rejects from the Mayo Clinic in America. 

He was an in-depth student on Indian cultural texts, including the Vedas and the Upanishads. What's more, he received the Upanayana from Suryakaladi Mana, famous for its "Tantric rituals" and spent the rest of his life as a Sanatana Dharma Acharya.Dr Mathew passed away on 20 Oct 2021 at the age of 92. No leading media in Kerala reported his death due to unknown reasons. He was cremated as per Hindu Rituals.His elder son Mohan and his student Dr Sreejith performed the last rites.
