## turuShka-daNDa
> The very first inscription of Chandradeva, the founder of the Gahadavala dynasty mentions Turushka-Danda. In plain words, it was a special tax levied for the explicit purpose of maintaining additional troops for resisting Turushka inroads. In the annals of Hindu polity, Danda has a twofold meaning: tax and army (the other word for army or military in general, is Bala). Thus, in both senses, the meaning of Turushka-Danda is highly appropriate in this context.
