How did the Hinduization of the east happen? 

One hypothesis has been cultural diffusion. It is currently the preferred hypothesis among the "mainstream" academics of the Abrahamosphere. Additionally they emphasize a role for Buddhism while downplaying any https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.01.21.427591v1.full role of H. This hypothesis believes that it was largely a memetic transfer with little actual admixture of people from India. 

However, we know from at least as early as the 500s of BCE the H were deeply involved in East Asian trade. Moreover, the East Asian traditions themselves e.g. that from Khmer acknowledge the role of the H kauNDinya in their foundation mythology (also found in chIna sources). This suggested that the H were physically moving into the east to found kingdoms. 

This latest article from Changmai et al shows the clear presence of an Indian genetic signal across several Eastern populations except the tribal ones to the north & inland suggesting direct movement of H into the east via both land (Myanmar->) & coast (Thai, Cambodia, Viet<-). While it is popular among folks on this medium to confidentally talk about %s of ancestry, we should keep in mind that these are qpAdm models that give a general feel for the trends in admixture rather than precise %s. With that caveat in 12 East Asian populations we may have 2-15% Indian admixture. This mean that there was a sizeable movement of peoplefrom India followed by admixture with various local populations. 

Now, by their own claims the sthaviravAdin & early mahAyAna bauddhAcharya-s were celibates (though some did take mating opportunities when available); hence, this larger gene flow has to be attributed to H movements in large part with the nAstikamata taking a hold only after H declined in India due to marUnmatta depredations.+++(5)+++ It would have been good if the same study had also considered populations from the Malay archipelago. Nevertheless, it also indicates the genetic imprint of a Negrito-like population across mainland and peninsular South East Asia whose strongest signal in their data is seen in the Maniq Negritos of Thailand. These peoples are the remnant of that once great expansion of Onge-like people across Asia with relationships at the other end to Aus/Pap.
