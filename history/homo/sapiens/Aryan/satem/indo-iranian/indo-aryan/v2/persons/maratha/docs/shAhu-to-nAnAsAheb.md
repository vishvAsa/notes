After Balaji Vishwanath, Baji Rao rendered meritorious services with all unswerving devotion. He was sent to restore the Emperor to the throne after defeating Nadir Shah. The end of his life approached. His object was to bring back the wealth from Iran after defeating the Shah. By God's will this has happened, though hope was entertained (of defeating the Shah). You are his son and worthy of achieving great successes by faithful service Bajirao's aim remained unfulfilled, so also my resolve to obtain hall of India after protecting the weak Emperor from the Irani. You should now fulfil the resolve by accomplishing the conquest of the whole of Hindasthan without dispensing with the emperor.
