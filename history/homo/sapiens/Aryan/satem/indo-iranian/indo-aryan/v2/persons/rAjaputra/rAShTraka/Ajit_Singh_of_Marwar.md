  - who built jantar mantar, patronized scholarship and even conducted an ashvamedha.

  - had rest houses and Dharmashalas built at Mathura, Brindavan, Kashi, Gaya, Pune, Kabul, Lahore, Agra, Delhi, Chitrakoot, Ayodhya, Haridwar, Ujjain, and other sacred spots
  - had Euclid's "Elements of Geometry" translated into Sanskrit as also several works on trigonometry, and Napier's work on the construction and use of logarithms
  - "at some point he ceased issuing bilingual, i.e., Rajasthani and Persian, deeds and by 1712 was using only a form of Dhundari, the local dialect of Rajasthani, for such documents (Horstmann 1999a, 49)."
  - "He had also stopped using the Persian calendar, using instead the Vikram dating system."
  - "In 1716, he ceased paying tribute to the emperor on his official seal, a tradition that went back many generations, and began to pay tribute to his own father, Bishan Singh. Later, in 1727, the seal was dedicated to the deity Sri Sitaramji."
  - "On a more personal note, he refrained from formally or publicly using the 
title “Mirza Raja", which had been conferred in 1712 by both Jahandar Shah and 
Farrukhsiyar. Perhaps he simply preferred the title “Sawai”"
