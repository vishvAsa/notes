When partition of India proved inevitable, his brother and assiciate sharad bose tried hard to fork off united Bengal into a separate country (in cooperation with Suhrawardi and his political disciple Mujib Ur Rahman). Jinnah supposedly agreed to it (4 Pakistans is quite acceptable to Islamist interests). ([YT(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90AkCIXXW2E)) Mujib Ur Rahman himself was a anti-H rioter (and claimed to have broken the head of a Hindu mahAsabhA leader ).

Another associate Shardul singh of Forward block proposed the same for Punjab.

INA muslim returnees joined Jinnah's muslim league guards.
