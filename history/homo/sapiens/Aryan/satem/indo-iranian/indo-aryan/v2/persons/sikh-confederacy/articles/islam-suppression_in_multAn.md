The Sikh rule in Multan as described by Alexander Burnes


> In this city, which held for upwards of 800 years so high a Mahommedan supremacy, there is now no public ‘numaz'; the true believer dare not lift his voice in public. The 'Eeds' and the Mohuram pass without the usual observances, and the “Ullaho Acbar' of the priest is never heard; the mosques are yet frequented, but the pious are reduced to offering up their orisons in silence. Such has been the state of things since Mooltan fell in 1818, and yet the number of Seiks is confined to that of the garrison, from four to five hundred men. The Mahommedans, who amount to about 40,000 souls, suffer no other inconvenience from their new masters, who afford every protection to their trade. The Seiks excuse themselves, by alleging that they have not inflicted, in retribution, one fourth of their own sufferings at the hands of the Mahommedans.
