Raja Ganesha (Maharaja Ganeshnarayan Raybhaduri) ruled as a Bengali Hindu ruler in the early 15th century, when Bengal was bordering the Muslim state of Jaunpur on the North-west. Raja Ganesh was an officer for the Ilyas Shahi dynasty, which was ruling Bengal Sultanate. According to Firishta, Raja Ganesh acquired high influence in Bengal Sultanate's governance in the reign of Shihabuddin Bayazid Shah (ruled 1413-15).

1414: Raja Ganesh deposes the Ilyas Shahi dynast, Alauddin Firuz Shah, and becomes the de facto Hindu ruler of Bengal. Seeing a Hindu ruling after *deposing a Muslim ruler*, a Muslim Chishti Shaikh - Nur Qutb-ul-Alam - wrote a letter to Jaunpur Sultan Ibrahim Sharqi. There are conflicting accounts regarding the battle between Ibrahim Sharqi & Raja Ganesh, and its aftermath. Riaz-us-Salatin (1788 CE source) states that Raja Ganesh got his son converted to Islam to pacify Ibrahim Sharqi. But other Chinese, Arakanese accounts state that, Raja Ganesha defeated Ibrahim Sharqi in battle. Raja Ganesh got his converted son to become ruler for brief period to pacify Muslims. However, he still held de-facto power behind the scenes.

1416/17: The Chishti Shaikh, Nur Qutb-ul-Alam died. Seizing the opportunity, Raja Ganesh got his son to step down, and reconverted him to Hinduism! According to accepted view of many scholars, Raja Ganesh assumed the title of Danujamardana-deva on re-ascension. Raja Ganesha ruled for two years in this second phase.

1418/19: Raja Ganesh passed away. His son ascends the throne. The Ganesha dynasty founded by him ruled over Bengal from 1415âˆ’1435.
