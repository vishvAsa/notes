Maharaja Jaswant Singh and a 10,000 strong force under him were just across the road, but they did not move a muscle to protect Awrangzib’s uncle Shaista Khan as Shivaji mauled him, nor did he order a chase as Marathas retreated. Mughals strongly suspected Rathors of complicity.

tavArikh i muhammad shahi says that when Awrangzib heard of Maharaja Jaswant Singh’s demise in distant Kabul, he instantly broke out in jubilation and uttered: “darwaza-e-kufr shikast! shikast!” - door that saved Kafirs, fall! Same year Jazia was imposed all over the empire.
