**Chapter 2**

**The Composers of the Rigveda**

The composers of the Rigveda are divided into ten families. These ten families are identified on the basis of the fact that each family has its own AprI-sUkta.

An AprI-sUkta is a particular type of ritual hymn 'consisting of invocations to a series of deified objects, and said to be introductory to the animal sacrifice'.^([1](#1))

The ten AprI-sUktas, and the ten families of composers to whom they belong, are:

1. I.13 KaNvas (Kevala-ANgirases)  
2. I.142 ANgirases  
3. I.188 Agastyas  
4. II.3 GRtsamadas (Kevala-BhRgus)  
5. III.4 ViSvAmitras  
6. V.5 Atris  
7. VII.2 VasiSThas  
8. IX.5 KaSyapas  
9. X.70 Bharatas  
10. X.110 BhRgus

In addition to hymns and verses composed by members of these ten families, we also have the two following categories of hymns and verses:

11\. Those composed *jointly* by members of different families.

12\. Those composed by RSis whose family identity is *unknown* or unidentifiable.

**Clarifications regarding MaNDala X**

MaNDala X is a very late MaNDala, and stands out from the other nine MaNDalas in many respects. One of these is the general ambiguity in the ascriptions of the hymns to their composers. In respect of 44 hymns, and 2 other verses, it is virtually impossible even to identify the family of the composer.

In respect of many other hymns and verses, where we have identified the family affiliations of the composers, the following clarifications are in order:

**Family 1: KANVAS** (1 hymn)

1\. *Upastuta VArSTihavya* (1 hymn): X.115

 a. This RSi practically identifies himself as a KANva  
 in verse 5 of the hymn.

 b. Outside this hymn, three out of four references to  
 Upastuta are by KaNvas (I.36.10, 17; VIII.5.25; 103. 8),  
 and in the fourth reference, Upastuta is named  
 along-with Kali (another KANva RSi, composer  
 of VIII.66).

**Family 2: ANGIRASES** (19 hymns)

1\. *Indra VaikuNTha* (3 hymns): X.48-50

Saptagu ANgiras, the composer of X.47, is clearly the composer of these three hymns, which constitute a continuation of the theme in hymn 47.
Hymn 47 is addressed to Indra as Indra VaikuNTha, and these three hymns, in the manner of a dialogue-hymn, constitute Indra's 'reply' to Saptagu.

2\. *AGNEYAS* (8 hymns): X.51-53, 79-80, 156, 187-188  
 *Agni SaucIka/Sapti VAjambhara*: X.51-53, 79,-80  
 *Ketu Agneya*: X.156  
 *Vatsa Agneya*: X.187  
 *Syena Agneya*: X.188

 a. Agni SaucIka is identifiable with the BharadvAja  
 RSi Agni BArhaspatya (joint composer of VIII. 102).  
 b. SUcI is a BharadvAja gotra.  
 c. The word VAjambhara is found in only two verses  
 outside this hymn, both by ANgirases:  
 I. 60. 6; IV.1.4.  
 d. VAja-m-bhara is clearly an inverted form of  
 Bhara-d-VAja.  
 e. The only gotras with Agni are BharadvAja and  
 KaSyapa gotras.

3\. *SAURYAS* (4 hymns): X.37, 158, 170, 181 (joint)  
 *AbhitApa Saurya*: X.37  
 *CakSu Saurya*: X.158  
 *VibhrAT Saurya*: X.170  
 *Gharma Saurya*:X.181 (joint)  
 a. The only gotras with *SUrya* are BharadvAja  
 and ViSvAmitra gotras.  
 b. The only other hymns to SUrya are by g BharadvAja  
 (I.115) and a KaNva (I. 50).  
 c. The joint hymn b y Gharma Saurya is with a  
 BharadvAja and a VasiSTha.  
 d. A word meaning asura-slayer, *asurahan/asuraghna*,  
 occuring in X.170. 2, is found elsewhere only in  
 hymns by a BharadvAja (VI. 22. 4) and a VasiSTha  
 (VII.13.1).  
 e. The three above hymns by Saurya RSis have  
 repetitions in common only with hymns by  
 ANgirases and by GRtsamada (a descendant  
 of BharadvAja):  
 X.37.4: X.127.2 (RAtrI BhdradvAjI)  
 JyotiSA bAdhase tamo.  
 X.37.10: II.23.15 (GRtsamada Saunahotra)  
 DraviNam dhehi citram.  
 X.158.5: I.82.3 (Gotama RAhUgaNa)  
 SusandRSam tvA vayam.  
 X.170.4: VIII.98.3 (NRmedha ANgiras)  
 VibhrAjanjyotiSA svaragaccho rocanam divah.

4\. *AURAVAS* (3 hymns): X.11-12, 138  
 *ANga Aurava*: X.138  
 *HavirdhAna ANgi*: X.11-12

The patronymics of these RSis show them to be descendants of Uru ANgiras (joint composer of IX.108).

5\. *AriStanemi TArkSya* (1 hymn): X.178.  
 a. The only other hymns to horses are by ANgirases  
 (I.162-163; IV. 38-40) and a VasiSTha (VII. 44).  
 b. The word TArkSya, outside this hymn, is found only  
 in one verse by an ANgiras, Gotama RAhUgaNa  
 (1.89.6).  
 c. The only hymns which have repetitions in common  
 with X.178 are by VAmadeva Gautama:  
 X.178.2: IV.23.10  
 PRthvI bahule gabhIre  
 X.178.3: IV.38.10  
 SavasA pa√±ca kRSTIh sUrya iva  
 jyotiSApastatAna.

**Family 5: VISVAMITRAS** (9 hymns)

1\. *PRAJAPATYAS* (9 hymns): 90, 107 (joint), 121,  
 129-130, 161, 177, 183-184  
 *NArAyaNa*: X.90  
 *DakSiNA PrAjApatya*: X.107 (joint)  
 *HiraNyagarbha PrAjApatya*: X.121  
 *PrajApati ParameSThin*: X.129  
 *Yaj√±a PrAjApatya*: X.130  
 *YakSmanASana PrAjApatya*: X.161  
 *PataNga PrAjApatya*: X.177  
 *PrajAvAn PrAjApatya*: X.183  
 *ViSNu PrAjApatya*: X.184  
a. PrajApati ParameSThin, clearly the patriarch of  
 this group of RSis, is identifiable with PrajApati  
 VaiSvAmitra (composer of III.54-56).  
b. The only hymn which has a repetition in common  
 with X.129 (by PrajApati ParameSThin) is III.54  
 (by PrajApati VaiSvAmitra):  
 X. 129.6: III.54.5  
 Ko addhA veda ka iha pra vocat.  
c. All the above hymns deal with the subject of  
 creation. The only other hymn dealing with this  
 subject is X.190, composed by AghamarSaNa  
 VaiSvAmitra; and the only other verse to which the  
 AnukramaNIs assign the same subject is I.24.1,  
 composed by SunahSepa AjIgarti (VaiSvAmitra).  
d. ViSvAmitra is traditionally associated with creation.  
 The epics relate the story of TriSanku, in which  
 ViSvAmitra sets out to teach the Gods a lesson by  
 creating a parallel universe. He finally desists only  
 when the Gods plead with him and accede to his  
 demand. But, even today, 'duplicate' objects in  
 nature are called *ViSvAmitra-sRSTi* or ViSvAmitra's  
 creations.  
e. NArAyaNa is a ViSvAmitra gotra; and the hymn by  
 NArAyaNa a, who is not given any patronymic, is  
 placed immediately after a hymn by a ViSvAmitra:  
 Renu VaiSvAmitra (X.89).

**Family 7: VASISTHAS** (23 hymns)

1\. *Suvedas SairISI* (1 hymn): X. 147  
 SairISI is a VasiSTha gotra.

2\. *Vamra VaikhAnasa* (1 hymn): X.99  
 a. The word *SiSnadeva* (X.99.3) is found only once  
 outside this hymn in VII.21.5, composed by  
 VasiSTha MaitrAvaruNI.  
 The word *SiSnA* by itself occurs only thrice in  
 the Rigveda, once in a hymn by a VasiSTha,  
 Vasukra Aindra (X.27.19), and once in a hymn  
 by a VasiSTha associate, Kutsa ANgiras  
 (1.105.8). The third occurence, in X.33.3, is in a  
 hymn by a RSi whose family cannot be identified.  
 b. The only hymn which has a repetition in common  
 with this hymn is X.20, composed by a VasiSTha,  
 Vimada Aindra:  
 X.99.12: X.20.10  
 ISamUrjam sukSitim viSvamAbhAh.

3\. *Manyu TApasa* (2 hymns): X.83-84  
 a. Manyu TApasa is identifiable with Manyu  
 VAsiSTha (joint composer of IX.97).  
 b. TApasa, an epithet signifying heat or passion, has  
 an added symbolic significance in this case: Tapa  
 is a VasiSTha gotra.  
 c. The word Manyu is translated, by Griffith, as a  
 name in only one other hymn, X.73.10, composed  
 by GaurivIti SAktya, a VasiSTha.

4\. *PurUravas AiLa and UrvaSI* (1 hymn): X.95.  
 a. Verse 17 of the hymn clearly declares:  
 'I, VasiSTha, call UrvaSI to meet me.' The name  
 VasiSTha is translated by Griffith as 'her best love'.  
 b. Outside this hymn, the word UrvaSI occurs only  
 twice throughout the Rigveda: once in a hymn  
 by an Atri (V.41.19), where it is an epithet for a  
 deified river; and once in a hymn by a VasiSTha  
 (VII.33.11) where UrvaSI is referred to as the  
 mother of VasiSTha.

5\. *AINDRAS* (18 hymns): X.20-29, 38, 65-66, 86, 96  
 (joint), 103, 119, 180  
 *Vimada Aindra and VasukRta VAsukra*: X.20-26  
 *Vasukra Aindra*: X.27-29  
 *Indra MuSkavAn*: X.38  
 *VasukarNa VAsukra*: X.65-66  
 *VRSAkapi Aindra*: X.86  
 *Sarvahari Aindra*: X.96 (joint)  
 *Apratiratha Aindra*: X.103  
 *Laba Aindra*:X. 119  
 *Jaya Aindra*: X.180  
 a. The only hymns, other than X.38, in which Indra  
 is named as composer, are hymns in which the  
 God Indra is depicted as speaking in the first  
 person. But X.38 does not depict Indra speaking  
 in the first person, and it is clear that Indra here  
 is the name of the composer, who is the patriarch  
 of the Aindra group of RSis in MaNDala X.  
 b. Indra is a VasiSTha gotra.  
 c. Indra MuSkavAn is identifiable with Indrapramati  
 VAsiSTha (joint composer of IX.97).  
 d. The word *muSka* (X.38.5), which gives the RSi  
 his epithet MuSkavAn, is found only once outside  
 this hymn, in X. 102.4, composed by a Bharata.  
 The Bharatas are very closely associated with the  
 ANgirases and VasiSThas.  
 e. X.38.5 refers to the RSi Kutsa. The Kutsas are  
 very close associates of the VasiSThas: the only  
 reference to Kutsas by non-Kutsas are in hymns  
 by VasiSTha (VII.25.5; X.29.2); the only references  
 to VasiSTha by a non-VasiSTha is in a hymn by  
 a Kutsa (I.112.9); and the only hymn in which a  
 Kutsa figures as a joint composer is IX.97, which  
 is jointly attributed to eleven VasiSTha RSis  
 (including Indrapramati) and a Kutsa.  
 f. Vasukra Aindra is identifiable with Vasukri  
 VasiSTha (joint composer of IX.97).  
 g. VasukarNa VAsukra calls himself a VasiSTha  
 (in X.65.15), and, in verse 12 of the same hymn,  
 he refers to Vimada (Aindra).  
 h. Jaya is a VasiSTha gotra  
 i. All the four other hymns (including the joint hymn)  
 have repetitions in common with VasiSThas or  
 their associates:  
 X.86.5: VII.104.7 (VasiSTha MaitrAvaruNI)  
 X.103.4: VII.32.11 (VasiSTha MaitrAvaruNI)  
 X. 119.13: X. 150.1 (MRLIka VAsiSTha): III.9.6.  
 (ViSvAmitra GAthina).  
 X.96.13: I.104.9 (Kutsa ANgiras)  
 X.96.2: I.9.10 (Madhucchandas VaiSvAmitra):  
 X.133.1 (SudAs Paijavana).

Apart from these, the four hymns have only two other repetitions (one of which is in common with a ViSvAmitra).

**Family 10: BHRGUS** (11 hymns)

1\. *YAMAYANAS* (11 hymns): X.10, 13-19, 135, 144, 154  
 *Yama Vaivasvata and YamI VaivasvatI*: X.10  
 *VivasvAn Aditya*: X.13

 a. YAmAyana or YAmyAyaNa is a BhRgu gotra.  
 b. Mathita is also a BhRgu gotra.  
 c. The alternative names given in the AnukramaNIs  
 for the composer of X.19, Mathita YAmAyana,  
 are BhRgu or Cyavana BhArgava.  
 d. Yama is mentioned alongwith ancient, mythical  
 BhRgu RSis, AtharvaNa and USanA KAvya  
 in I.83.5.  
 e. Hymn X.14.5 states: 'Our fathers are ANgirases,  
 Navagvas, AtharvaNas, BhRgus.' BhRgu hymns  
 in MaNDalas IX and X often identify with both  
 ANgirases and BhRgus (see, for example,  
 IX. 62.9, and the comment on it in Griffith's  
 footnotes).  
 f. All the above hymns deal with the topics of  
 funerals and death. Tradition ascribes the  
 initiation of funeral rites and ceremonies to  
 Jamadagni BhArgava.

The family identities of the other composers of MaNDala X are either obvious from their patronymics, or known from the gotra lists, or else unidentifiable.
