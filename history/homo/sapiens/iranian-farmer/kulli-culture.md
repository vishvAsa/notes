- Gradual rather than sudden development of urban societies in Indian Subcontinent 6000 - 2000 BC. Some pottery shards show graffiti from proto-writing which was very different from the Indus Valley Civilization script. 
- Baluchistan 4300-3500 BC had growing settlements made of mud bricks, & featured granaries & stores. Lapis lazuli, steatite, turquoise, carnelian, & seashells were all worked with pottery in specialized workshops. Glass was made at same time as Egypt & Mesopotamia. 
- Baluchistan 3500-3000 shows signs of earliest irrigation channels in subcontinent, though debated. 3000-2600 population seems to have grown & social complexity increased. Monumental platforms (pyramids?) were built, & trade as far as Afghanistan & western India was conducted.
- Baluchistan coast under under influence of Indus Valley Civilization, but rest of Baluchistan remained culturally distinctive as the Kulli Culture 2500-2000 BC.
- Baluchistan was overrun by invaders from Central Asia or Iran around 2000 BC. Settlements were burned & abandoned, walls were destroyed, & many objects were smashed. Horse bones are found in subsequent layers. Continuity in axes & cylinder seals though.
