title = "+African Introgression"

Studies in past 10 years that suggest two distinct introgression events in Africa with archaic: 1 before Af-non-Af split & 2. After the latter diverged. This means archaics were around in African until relatively recently.

Interesting article studying several African groups in depth where the authors identify a possible archaic Homo which has introgressed into Africans independently of Neanderthals introgressing into the Eurasians. This is the network they reconstruct. Note the branch introgressing into the sub-Saharan Africans separated from other Homo sapiens more than 500 Kya. That is a deep split not long after the split of the sapiens lineage from neanderthal+denisova.

As ever the puzzle is what fossil population this lineage might have belong to. They also propose an even earlier population splitting off from the common ancestor of (sapiens, (denisova,neanderthal)) mixing slightly with Denisovans. Could this have been the Homo erectus hanging out in East Asia/Pacific islands before the coming of the Denisovans to those regions? The tantalizing material evidence from the far reaches of Indonesia suggest a much earlier presence of some Homo than sapiens or Denisovans.
