## H.heidelbergensis
- Narmada cranial fragment is believed to be H.heidelbergensis from around 250,000-300,000 years BP. [{MT}](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2007/07/12/giant-volcanos-and-humans/)
- Exact date of modern human entry as well as the effect of the giant Toba volcano explosion on Indian hominid population is unclear. [{MT}](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2007/07/12/giant-volcanos-and-humans/)
  - "Likewise, previous archaeological studies have recovered actual human fossils from only around 31,000 years (the Shri Lankan caves), though there are poorly studied assemblages of earlier stone tools from main land India."
