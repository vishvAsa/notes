title = "Military advantage"
+++

- Horse-poor populations were at a great military disadvantage - especially in the plains. See Indian example [here](/notes/history/homo/sapiens/Aryan/satem/indo-iranian/indo-aryan/v2/defence/military/Adaption_-_technology_and_tactics/). 

## Provenance
- Horses were advantageous in the charriot age. Eg. IA invasion.
- They increased their advantage in the horse-back age. Eg. kushAna, shaka, huNa, Turkik invasions into India.

## Battle tactics
- Could rapidly outflank infantry blocks and attack from sides.
- Could use archery or long spears to harrass from a distance, while rapidly changing positions, without risking precious horses.

## Numbers per rider
- Horses can charge full speed about 2-3 miles a day. Fully exhausted after that. So, 2-3 chargers per men needed in battle.
- Mongols often used multiple (7-10) horses per rider, and stored meat between saddle and the horse to each on horseback. They'd drink mare's milk and meat in extreme situations. So all they needed was fodder.
- Turks - 2-3 mounts.


## Range
- Range depended on breed, the weight of the rider (and armor), and many other factors, such as environmental conditions. Mongol ponies, for instance, were bred for stamina - i.e., traveling long hours and distances at a steady pace. The scrappy little Indian-bred horses used by the far-ranging Maratha cavalry in India were similarly bred for long-haul stamina.
- Infantry could cover at most 30 km per day. 
- During the invasion of Hungary in early 1241, they covered up to 100 miles (160 km) per day.
- Cavalry in the 19th century, marching and using one horse, would usually limit their daily march to about 40 miles. The troopers also didnâ€™t ride the horses the whole time. They would alternate between riding and walking beside the horses.
- There were warhorses that could cover 360 km in 1 day. ("The trade in horses between Khorasan and India in the 13th - 17th centuries" by Ali Bahrani Pour.) 

## Equalizers
- Battle of Agincourt was fought in a place where archers held advantage due to topography. English were helped by topography in most places. Indian northern plains had rarely such topographical advantages.
- Guns and cannons made things more equal.
