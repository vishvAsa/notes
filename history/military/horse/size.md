## Bronze Age
- Horses were mostly too small to be able to carry people on their backs (except light frail people).
- Kikkuli the Mittani wrote a manual for horse conditioning.
- Hence charriots - oft with multiple steeds drawing them.
- Even charriots were small.

## Iron age
- By 800 BCE, there are more references of horse riders.
- Back strength of the horse had increased.
- Riders wore light armors.
- Size remained small, legs dangled below the horse belly.

## 1200 Jump
- Sudden increase in horse size between 1100 and 1250. Legs no longer dangle down. 
- Started in Central Asia, spread west fast.
