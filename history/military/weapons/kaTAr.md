A thread on Katar and how it fell into disgrace.

Katar as a weapon had its origin in Southern India. During the Medieval period, it became a symbol of nobility and social status. From Mughal emperors to Rajput Rajas to Chhatrapati Shivaji, all can be seen carrying this weapon in paintings. 

Because of its shape and size, it was classified as a weapon of attack. It was used during close contact fighting, particularly when longer weapons like swords etc couldn't be used. And compared to an ordinary dagger, you can generate more thrusting power with it.

Since it was a short weapon, it was much easier to control. The attacker can stop the attack only to injure the enemy or bury it deep into the body. It was also easier to carry and conceal. All of these qualities of Katara ultimately became the cause of its demise.

During the late 19th century, in the Awadh region particularly, Katara became the weapon of choice for thugs and thieves. It was this association that stopped the respectable people of Awadh from carrying this weapon. So Katara, in the Awadh of the 19th century, enjoyed the same reputation which in modern times Chhuri (छुरी) or Country made firearms (desi Katta) enjoys. The fact that it was once a symbol of social status makes the story of Katara quite interesting.
