## Joint use
Modern warfare is about combined arms. Tanks, infantry, helicopters, artillery, etc. are all vulnerable if employed by themselves. Using them together is how you mitigate their vulnerabilities.

## Overall Evolution
### Plain battle
- Early infrantry with formations and stampede tactics
- Infantry supplemented by War chariots using small chariots (which could attack infantry from the sides).
- Infantry (thick formation) supplemented by cavalry (a thin line).
- Hunnic, Turkic, Mongol mounted archer blitzers who harrassed infantry till they broke formation and lost.
- Infantry and cavalry supplemented by Artillery
