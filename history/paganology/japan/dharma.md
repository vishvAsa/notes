## Conformity, collectivism
They have been a culture with a high emphasis on conformity: it is important not to stand out - either in good or bad ways, unless the social role requires it.

People often think about what others think about them. Social honor is a big component of individual honor. In old days, some people were driven to commit suicide by hAra-kiri stoically as a matter of punishment or grief over shame.

### Individual sacrifice
They have extraordinary tolerance of suffering without complaint (gamban). Eg: solidarity displayed after earthquakes and tsunamis without rioting.

During the war, kamikAze suicide attacks were partly motivated by this.

### Crime
Common crime is low: unlocked bikes are rarely stolen, and 'lost and found' property (even money) is returned to the police. Yet, there is organized crime, in the form of Yakuza, who have existed since recent feudal times.

## Stickiness of traditional values
They Americanized their tastes in clothes, music and even social attitudes- especially the urban population, that too, especially so in the years after their surrender in WW2. Traditionally, there was a heavy emphasis on quasi-vegetarianism; but under american influence, they started eating cow and horse meat.

Yet, there are strong revivalist threads Eg: Samurai movies.

They taken great pride and care in preserving their ancient arts - including martial arts (bushiDo, kenDo), music.
