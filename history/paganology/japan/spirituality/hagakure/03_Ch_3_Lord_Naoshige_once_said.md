+++
Lord Naoshige once said, “There is nothing felt quite
so deeply as giri. There are times when someone
like a cousin dies and it is not a matter of shedding
tears. But we may hear of someone who lived fifty
or a hundred years ago, of whom we know nothing and who has
no family ties with us whatsoever, and yet from a sense giri shed
tears.”+++(5)+++

When Lord Naoshige was passing by a place called Chiriku,
someone said to him, ’ ’In this place there lives a man who
is over ninety years old. Since this man is so fortunate, why
don’t you stop and see him?” Naoshige heard this and said,
“How could anyone be more pitiful than this man? How many
of his children and grandchildren do you suppose he has seen
fall before his very eyes? Where is the good fortune in that?”
It seems that he did not stop to see the man.

When Lord Naoshige was speaking to his grandson, Lord
Motoshige, he said, “No matter whether one be of high or low
rank, a family line is something that will decline when its time
has come. If one tries to keep it from going to ruin at that time,
it will have an unsightly finish. If one thinks that the time has
come, it is best to let it go down with good grace. Doing so, he
may even cause it to be maintained.”+++(5)+++

It is said that Motoshige’s younger brother heard this from
him.
