## Influx
- They seem to have left S China, settled in Shan (Tai) state, then to Kabaw Valley to Khampat to Chin Hills in Burma. They finally began to move across the river Tiau to India in the Middle of the 16th Century. Most of the Mizos and their clans had completely migrated to their present location by the third decade of the 18th century.
- The British acquired the Chin Hills a decade after the Third Anglo-Burmese War of 1885. American missionaries began arriving in the 1890s and, by the middle of the 20th century, most of the Chin people had converted to Protestant Baptist Christianity.
- "New Kukis" migrated to Manipur during the first half of the 19th century.  The Lushais were the last of the Mizo tribes migrate to India.
- Mizo Hills were formally declared as part of the British-India by a proclamation in 1895.
- More Burmese Chins have been migrating after Indian independence.
- Currently, there are 4M Mizos, with some 800k in mizoram, with the share with 8% chakmas.
- Some 9k of them claim to be Bnei Menashe jews since 1970s - with a few 100s having migrated to Israel.

## Mautam
- Occurs every 48–50 years in the northeastern Indian states of Tripura, Mizoram and Manipur, which are 30% covered by wild bamboo forests
- During mautâm, Melocanna baccifera, a species of bamboo, flowers at one time across a wide area. This event is followed invariably by a plague of black rats in what is called a rat flood. This triggers famine due to feeding on stored grains.

## Conflicts in India
- Anti-chief movement spread after Indian independence.
- Since 1955 they started demanding a separate state from Assam (and later a separate country). 
- They complained about 1959 Mautam famine handling, Assamese as state language, settlement of chakma refugees.
- In 1966, MNF started an armed uprising, with an ethnic component targetting Vai-s (non-mi-zos). Assam Rifles camp was besieged. IAF carried out air strikes and ground troops came in. MNF fled and started an insurgency.
- As the insurgents found security and refuge in the large number of tiny hamlets, Indian government started a "grouping" policy in the Mizo district. 80% of the rural population was shifted from their villages and resettled along the highways. The old villages were burnt, and the new settlements were kept under the control of the security forces until 1970. This subdued the insurgency a great deal. In 1986, MNF signed the Mizo accord with GOI and settled for the Mi-zo-ram+++(=land)+++ state.
