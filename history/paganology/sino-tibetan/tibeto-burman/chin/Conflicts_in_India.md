## Mautam
- Occurs every 48–50 years in the northeastern Indian states of Tripura, Mizoram and Manipur, which are 30% covered by wild bamboo forests
- During mautâm, Melocanna baccifera, a species of bamboo, flowers at one time across a wide area. This event is followed invariably by a plague of black rats in what is called a rat flood. This triggers famine due to feeding on stored grains.


## MNF saga
- Anti-chief movement spread after Indian independence.
- Since 1955 they started demanding a separate state from Assam (and later a separate country). 
- They complained about 1959 Mautam famine handling, Assamese as state language, settlement of chakma refugees.
- In 1966, MNF started an armed uprising, with an ethnic component targetting Vai-s (non-mi-zos). Assam Rifles camp was besieged. IAF carried out air strikes and ground troops came in. MNF fled and started an insurgency.
- As the insurgents found security and refuge in the large number of tiny hamlets, Indian government started a "grouping" policy in the Mizo district. 80% of the rural population was shifted from their villages and resettled along the highways. The old villages were burnt, and the new settlements were kept under the control of the security forces until 1970. This subdued the insurgency a great deal. In 1986, MNF signed the Mizo accord with GOI and settled for the Mi-zo-ram+++(=land)+++ state.
