## IE invasions
- "Indo-Europeans reached and probably overwhelmed the Eastern Steppes starting first around 5300 YBP symmetrically with the first invasion of western Europe. This eastern branch perhaps gave rise to the Tocharians though more data from the time Tocharian was actually attested would be useful. ... While the Afanasievo people who represent the 1st IE invasion of the east did not mix noticeably with the east Asians."
- "However, a second wave of Indo-Europeans, the Indo-Iranians, started advancing east perhaps starting around 4100 YBP. They appear to have conquered the Kazakh steppes by around 4000 YBP& sometime in the following 500 years invaded India: Aryan invasion."
- "By sometime around 3200-2900 YBP a branch of the Aryans advanced deeply to the east. ...This new Indo-Iranian wave mixed with the East Asians in Mongolia... This gene flow was not very extensive in the eastern reaches but it brought the technology of horse+goat+sheep+cow diary pastoralism to the east. This appears to have been transferred without much genetic acquisition of the lactase persistence phenotype."

Thence rose the iranic shakas and kuShANa-s; then the admixed huNa-s, thence the turks, then khitans, then the mongols. "Huns→Blue Turks→China→Blue Turks→[Arabs, Tibetans, various Turks, China]→Uighurs→Kirghiz→Kitans→Mongols of Chingiz Kha’Khan". They are separately considered in separate pages.
