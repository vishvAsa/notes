## Kök Türük Göktürk Khaganate 
- [Kök Türük (Gök Türk = Blue Turk)](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2010/03/06/the-epic-on-stone/)
- They took over from the Hunnic Rouran khanate.
- "However, legacy of the Blue Turks was lasting one- it gave the Turks the the concept of a nation, ethnic identity and made them into a civilizational influence. This  was also influenced the Mongols who had made similar earlier attempts at nationhoods in founding the two great Hunnic Khanates \[commonly termed the Xiongnu and Rouran or Juan-Juan Khanates\]. .. Their rise for the Turks was as momentous as the rise of the Bharatas amidst the Indo-Aryans. ... However, it had not sunk deep enough for the transformation of the entire Altaic people. Here lie the roots of modern Turkey and the Central Asian Stans’  identity crisis  which was hijacked by the desert delusion in the centuries to come.

Blue Turks & their successors were an important part of the Central Asian resistance against the Meccan demons. The Arab marUnmatta-s ibn Abd al-Maliq & Mohd. b Marwan launched massive invasions of the region between the Caucasus & Don-Volga to capture numerous Turks. The Orkhon inscriptions in Mongolia mention how the heathen Turks however blocked the advance of the Meccan evil in Sogdhiana.

The Turks entered unmAda in two ways.
- **Daawa** The Khazars partly accepted mUlonmAda. The Seljuks seem to have acquired mUlonmAda from the Khazars but quickly converted to marUnmAda evidently influence by u3 daayis.
  - After the collapse of Khazar power most survivors were taken as ghulaam-s & organically converted from u1 to u3.
- **Enslavement** Most other Turks acquired marUnmada via enslavement by the Arabs the founders of marUnmAda. In the 900s of CE the Arabs & Arabized marUnmatta potentates in Persia realizing the value of the hardy steppe-born Turks as slaves launched raids year after year to get Turks as slaves. The maru-s also preferred them as slaves for their relatively fair complexion. They were termed ghulaam and mamaaleek. The maru-s record that they were collecting annually around 12000 Turks as slaves from Central Asia @ 70-100 dirhams per head. Turk women & boys to some extant were utilized as sexual slaves. The males were given all sundry jobs but eventually took over the military. 
- **Forced mass conversions**: "Similarly, after the Seljuqs became u3 they forced the conversions of the Qaayi, Bayat, Bayandur and Pecheneg tribes of Turks to the Meccan madness. Thus, they became ghaazis who were to uphold the unmAda in its characteristically bloody within and without form"

### Impact
"Had it not been for the Turkic sword arm marUnmAda might have been a way more limited disease."

The Samanid Sultan Isma'il bin Ahmad captured numerou Turkic slaves in an assault on the Qarluq at Talas in 893CE. The forced the conversion of other smaller Turkic tribes& made them collect slaves for Samanids. One such was the Tukhsee tribe. The Tukhsee-s then attacked another small Turkic tribe and took Sebuktegin as slave and sold him to the Moslems at Shaash. That's how the Ghaznavids came into being as the spearhead of Islam.

##  Oghuz Turks
This branch went on to found the Seljuk and Ottomon empires.

## Indian radiations
- Mamluk, Khalji, Tughlaq dynasties.
- Timur and Babur were turko-mongol, but heavily turkified. 
- A common term for "muslim" in several Indian languages continues to be turk: turka, turuShka, tuluka.
