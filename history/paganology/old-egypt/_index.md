## Pyramids and slavery
- Biblical propaganda is that pyramids were built by slaves. This is false.
- "There is a lot more info available now about the lives of these workers, they were given their own separate quarters to stay & work on the pyramids by the Pharaoh. Egyptology has moved on but hordes r still stuck 200 yrs in past". [YT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LsEwVgNbyZg)


## Egyptian language

- Many claim monophyly with semitic, assyrrian, chadic etc.. Some contest semitic monophyly, speaking of absence of common inherited concept hierarchy which cant be explained as loans.
- Later survived among copts.

## Desecration
"Al-Malik al-Aziz Uthman the son of the counter-crusader Salah ad-Din who wanted clean Giza of its jāhilīyah devoted a large amount of labor to demolish the pyramids but only having succeeded in damaging the smallest of the big three eventually gave up. Then the Mamluqs of Nasir-ad-Din al-Hasan carved out the casing stones of the great pyramid to build masjids but could not get down the colossus.
