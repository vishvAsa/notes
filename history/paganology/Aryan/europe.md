## Present

- Khanty of Rus: " Khanty people remained heathen for long despite vigorous attempts to impose the Christian delusion on them by the Rus. They were finally subjugated by the 1800s and partly converted. In the 1900s they were subject to ethnic cleansing by Stalin who systematically suppressed their heathen religion and killed off all their shamans."

- Hegel the German \[[IMG](https://twitter.com/Rjrasva/status/578532934673518593)\]: "Is Judaea, then, the Teutons’ fatherland?" ([CH](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/works/pc/ch02.htm))
  - "Christianity has emptied Valhalla, felled the sacred groves, extirpated the national imagery as a shameful superstition, as a devilish poison, and given us instead the imagery of a nation whose climate, laws, culture, and interests are strange to us and whose history has no connection whatever with our own. A David or a Solomon lives in our popular imagination, but our country’s own heroes slumber in learned history books.... Anyone who did not know the history of the city, the culture, and the laws of Athens could almost have learned them from the festivals if he had lived a year within its gates... Athenian citizen whose poverty deprived him of the chance to vote in the public assembly, or who even had to sell himself as a slave, still knew as well as Pericles and Alcibiades who Agamemnon and Oedipus were when Sophocles or Euripides brought them on the stage."
- in Nietzsche's writings: "The two opposing values ‘good and bad’, ‘good and evil’ have fought a terrible battle for thousands of years on earth; and  although the latter has been dominant for a long time, there is still no lack of places where the battle remains undecided. ...   
    So the Romans were the strong and noble, stronger and nobler than anybody hitherto who had lived or been dreamt of on earth; their every relic and inscription brings delight, provided one can guess what it is that is doing the writing there. By contrast, the Jews were a priestly nation of ressentiment par excellence, possessing an unparalleled genius for popular morality: compare peoples with similar talents, such as the Chinese or the Germans, with the Jews, and you will realize who are first rate and who are fifth. Which of them has prevailed for the time being, Rome or Judea? But there is no trace of doubt: just consider to whom you bow down in Rome itself, today, as though to the embodiment of the highest values – and not just in Rome, but over nearly half the earth" \[[N1](https://archive.org/stream/GeneologyofMorals#page/n71/mode/2up)\]

### Lithuania

> "Why were the Lithuanian heathens most successful in holding out against the Christian steamroller?" \[[MT16](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2016/03/13/some-notes-on-the-heathen-lithuania-and-its-demise/)\]

> Thus, despite their many victories, broken by the Mongol strike and incessantly attacked by the crusades the heathen Lithuanian finally succumbed to Christianity in 1387 CE.

> "The answer we present is related to the unusual archaism of their language and potentially religion. Thus, we posit that they were in many ways parallel to the Hindus. The Hindus were remarkably successful in preserving their Indo-Aryan archaism and their now withering Iranian cousins in preserving their Avestan traditions in face of several assaults. This relates to a well-developed ritualist caste with a powerful oral tradition and specifically a grammatically tradition that allowed preservation of the language, especially in ritual, close to its old Indo-European state. While this was potentially ancestral to the Indo-Europeans as suggested by the Roman ritualist guild, the combination with a rigorous grammatically oriented oral tradition is clearly attested best in the Indo-Aryans and then the Iranians \[Notably, of the local Indian languages Tamil, a non-Aryan language, was the next best in its preservation of archaic tradition in India precisely because it adopted the Aryan linguistic methodology very early in its history\]. Hence, we hypothesize that the Lithuanians had such a tradition which approached the Indo-Iranian state to certain degree \[Totally contra-Rowell, who rather idiotically asserts that Germanic, Slav and Balt pagans built shrines to imitate Christians! A sign of how deep-rooted Abrahamistic prejudices are in academia\]. ... In support of this we have evidence from whatever scraps of information survive regarding the heathen Lithuanian state that they had a well-organized ritualist guild along with the duchy elite with whom they intermarried – a parallel to the brahma-kṣatra elite of the Hindus."  \[[MT16](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2016/03/13/some-notes-on-the-heathen-lithuania-and-its-demise/)\]
    
### Armenia
- "Book One is an alleged eyewitness account of the Armenian conversion to Christianity by one Zenob Klag. It is remarkable for its portrayal of this conversion as a colonial process, led and controlled by representatives of a new (foreign) religious movement. Albeit in collaboration with (a subjugated and obedient) section of the domestic nobility, this foreign Christian religion is only imposed after fierce battles against the (native) pagan leadership and its popular supporters. Once masters of the land. this new Church moves to appropriate the choice portions of the nation's property and wealth. The story unfolds in the form of a correspondence between Gregory the Illuminator in Armenia and his superior Archbishop Leo headquartered in Ghessaria. Neither is native to Armenia. Yet they talk as if they own the country and its population with some god-given power to do with them as they wish. Their air of confidence is unmistakable, no doubt sustained by religious righteousness. Preparing to consolidate their spiritual conquest of the local population, Gregory urges Leo to 'send forth your (priests) in order to reap God's harvest'. (p21) The harvest of course was not purely of souls. Control of people's spiritual life was to be the fertile ground for raising vast amounts of material wealth through all manner of religious taxes, dues and gifts."
