## Satem for 100
- Avestan satem, Persian sad, Sanskrit śatam, сто / sto in all modern Slavic languages, Old Church Slavonic sъto, Latvian simts, Lithuanian šimtas
- Slavic prefix sъ(n)- ("with")
- Tocharian B kante is a special, doubtful case.

## Ancestry
During the Bronze Age, Corded Ware people with admixture from Central Europe remigrated onto the steppe, forming a type of WSH ancestry often referred to as Steppe Middle and Late Bronze Age (Steppe MLBA) ancestry. Through the Sintashta culture, Andronovo culture and Srubnaya culture, Steppe MLBA was carried into Central Asia and South Asia along with Indo-Iranian languages, leaving a long-lasting cultural and genetic legacy.

## Central asia
- Earlier Tocharian wave considered separately.
- "However, a second wave of Indo-Europeans, the Indo-Iranians, started advancing east perhaps starting around 4100 YBP. They appear to have conquered the Kazakh steppes by around 4000 YBP& sometime in the following 500 years invaded India: Aryan invasion."
- "By sometime around 3200-2900 YBP a branch of the Aryans advanced deeply to the east. ...This new Indo-Iranian wave mixed with the East Asians in Mongolia... This gene flow was not very extensive in the eastern reaches but it brought the technology of horse+goat+sheep+cow diary pastoralism to the east. This appears to have been transferred without much genetic acquisition of the lactase persistence phenotype."
- Population replacement ~50%. R1a1a is quite common among some central Asian populations, reaching levels of up to 60% among the Kyrgyz and the Tajiks. It is possible that the haplogroup expanded through central Asia and into northwestern India shortly before the arrival of agriculture, which arrived in the region shortly after 10,000 years ago.

> Basically, the eastern Yamnaya ancestry has been sloshing around the steppe for thousands of years. After 2000 BC they were absorbed into Indo-Iranians, but their far eastern outliers, the Afanesievo maintained some cultural continuity in the form of the Tocharian languages.

### Replacement
- Central Asian waves led to close interaction with mongoloid people .:
