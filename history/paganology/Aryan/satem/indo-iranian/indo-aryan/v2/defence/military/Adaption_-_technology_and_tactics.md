## Horse
### Range
- Range depended on breed, the weight of the rider (and armor), and many other factors, such as environmental conditions. Mongol ponies, for instance, were bred for stamina - i.e., traveling long hours and distances at a steady pace. The scrappy little Indian-bred horses used by the far-ranging Maratha cavalry in India were similarly bred for long-haul stamina.
- Infantry could cover at most 30 km per day. Mongols often used multiple (3/4) horses per rider, and stored meat between saddle and the horse to each on horseback. They'd drink mare's milk and meat in extreme situations. So all they needed was fodder. 
- During the invasion of Hungary in early 1241, they covered up to 100 miles (160 km) per day.
-  Cavalry in the 19th century, marching and using one horse, would usually limit their daily march to about 40 miles. The troopers also didnâ€™t ride the horses the whole time. They would alternate between riding and walking beside the horses.
- There were warhorses that could cover 360 km in 1 day. ("The trade in horses between Khorasan and India in the 13th - 17th centuries" by Ali Bahrani Pour.) 

### Differential 
- Ancient and mideval sources (shAlihotra, sAyaNa) acknowledged the importance of horses in military success. \[[Tw](https://twitter.com/blog_supplement/status/679471919507320835)\]
- there was a HUGE price differential for horses between the Steppe and India. i.e. You could buy a horse in the steppe for 1 moroccan dinar. That same horse would cost 25 - 125 moroccan dinars in India (depending upon circumstances).
- Records show 1 lakh such horses were bought in central asia every year for resale in India, in the 16th C.
  
## Muskets and firing line
Muskets and the firing line were adapted early. \[Inquiring [post](https://agnimaan.wordpress.com/2015/06/28/handguns-in-hindu-military-why-the-slow-adoption/).\]

Adaption of European advances in tactics and weaponry was only partial - [Gordon 98 pdf](http://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/bitstream/handle/2027.42/67903/10.1177_001946469803500301.pdf?sequence=2).
