Some say he was rAjaputra. Others say  a janeudhari Mohyal (Ayachak Brahmin) of Bharadwaj gotra. He took up sannyAsa for inadvertently killing a pregnant deer in violation of the dharmashAstra-s, returned to the sword and gRhasthAshrama propelled by guru govinda-simha (while staunchly retaining his vegetarian vaiShNava base), avenged the guru, withstood torture, saw his one year killed and his liver stuffed into his mouth, refused to convert, and died. He never fully became an "sikh"ularist.
