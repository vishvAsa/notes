This lord of Marwar, refused to have any form of alliance with the Mughals and he defended his kingdom for nearly two decades against relentless attacks from the Mughals.

Born on 30 July 1541, Chandrasen was the son of Rao Maldeo, Raja of Marwar and Rani Swarup Deviji, daughter of Jhalo Jaito Sajivat. He was also the younger and only full-brother of Udai Singh, his successor. Rao Chandrasen Rathore became the Raja of Jodhpur at the age of 21 (1562). His father Maldeo named him as his successor, putting aside the claims of his older brothers, Ram and Udai Singh. This led to an eternal rivalry between Chandrasen and Udai Singh. In 1562, Ramchandra, Udai Singh and Raimal rebelled at Sojat, Gagani and Dunda respectively. Chandrasen then fought Ramchandra at Nadol in 1563 and when Ramchandra saw no chance of his success, he fled to Nagore. The initial six years of his exile seems to be the hardest and he was forced to sell his family's heirlooms in order to continue his struggle.

Akbar took advantage of these internal disputes, and with the help of the rajas of Bikaner and Amer, fought Chandrasen in several battles. In 1564, Hussain Quli Khan-i-Jahan invaded and captured the fort of Jodhpur. Bhadrajun Fort of Jalore, where he entrenched himself after 1564 and made it his base to fight against Akbar. Bhadrajun was put to siege and captured in 1571. Chandrasen escaped to fort of Siwana. He was then welcomed by Rana Udai Singh II of Mewar and his daughter was married to the Rao. His successor rANa pratApa-siMha refused to help Chandrasen as he was himself faced with many problems.

By March 1576 the powerful fort of Siwana fell to Akbar's Mir Bakshi Shahbaz Khan. Rawal Askaran of Dungarpur, offered help to Chandrasen who stayed at Dungarpur for a few months before leaving. He then proceeded to hills of Piplod, and thence to the mountain defiles of Sarand, making Sojat his capital. Chandrasen continued his struggle until his death on 11 January 1581 at Siriari Pass. After his death, Marwar was brought under direct Mughal administration until Akbar restored the throne of Marwar to Udai Singh in August 1583.

The memorial of Rao Chandrasen ji is an inscription carved on the stone of Makrane, in which Rao Chandrasen riding on a horse and his five queens (atleast 4 of whom did anugamana) are shown.
