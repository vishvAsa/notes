[shambhAji](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sambhaji), son of shivAji, who fought the siddi, Portuguese and mughals, who died rather than convert, \[[M](http://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2004/06/13/the-end-of-sambhaji/)1\] who tried to induce a pan-Indian hindu unity against the yavana-s \[[M2](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2010/04/25/the-scope-of-shivajis-plan-of-svarajya/) letter to rAmasimha\] \[battles 1680-1707 [here](https://aneeshbooks.wordpress.com/references-used-while-writing-brahmaputra/chhatrapati-sambhaji-battles-fought-during-maratha-war-of-independence-1680-to-1707/)\].

Nicolai Manucci reported that shambhu showed him his sword and said that he beheaded 30 of his traitorous officers himself.

> Sambhaji was given to women and drink in the company of a brave but lazy Kanyakubja brahmin poet Kalash. .. Sambhaji remained lazy and missed a golden opportunity even as Awrangzeeb pressed home his fierce attacks on Bijapur and Golconda.
