The Delhi sultanate rulers were well known for their oppressive policies towards the local Hindus. From jizya, to destruction of temples, Hindus of India had to go through a dark
period during the regime of the five dynasties that ruled from Delhi and are collectively referred to as the "Delhi Sultanate."

This was during the reign of Mubarak Shah, the second ruler of the dynasty. His entire reign was marked by internal disputes and chaos. Moreover, his policies towards the Hindus were as oppressive as the kings before him. At such situations, Two Hindu Khatri (Kshatriya) commanders in his army, Singharan (also Sadharan in some sources) and Sidhu Pal (also Sidhi Pal in some sources) planned to dethrone the Sultan.

Both Sidhu Pal and Singharan came from families that served as commanders to the rulers of Delhi for generations. Sidhu Pal was son of distinguished warrior Rajo Khatri. In their plans, the two found support from a Muslim minister named Sarwarul Mulk. But here is a little twist, Sarwar wasn't a born Muslim but a Hindu convert named Malik Sarup. It is nothing but obvious to assume that he must've changed the religion to gain favors from religiously fundamentalist Delhi sultans but otherwise harbored sympathies for his fellow Hindu citizens.

With the plan in place, Sidhu Pal, Singharan and Sarwarul Mulk proceeded to execute them. On afternoon of 14 February, 1434, Sidhu Pal beheaded Sultan Mubarak Shah with a single slash of his heavy sword. The assassination, resulted in widespread chaos and civil war with Hindu and Muslim nobles pitched against each other. Mubarak's nephew Muhammad Shah was declared to be his successor. the Khatri rebels supported the appointment of the new Sultan.

Meanwhile, Muslim nobles and soldiers were vying for the blood of the Hindus. A full scale civil war had broken out. Sarwarul Mulk, Sidhu Pal and Singharan retired to the Siri fort along with the newly crowned Sultan. There, despite the unwillingness of Muhammad Shah, Sidhu Pal and Singharan put up a brave battle against the forces of the Muslim nobles. They did everything within their capacity to protect the new Sultan and held the attacking forces for no less than three months with just a handful of Khatri soldiers. The forces of the Muslim nobles failed to break in within the Siri fort despite numerous attempts. However, the brave display of valor by the Khatris went in vein, when one night the Sultan who was sympathetic to the cause of the Muslim nobles, secretly allowed the attacking forces to sneak in. What followed was an onslaught and blood bath. Khatris were quickly outnumbered by attacking hordes.

Sensing that this is going to be a decisive war and chances of survival are scarce, Sidhu Pal set his own house with his wife and children inside on fire before launching the final attack on his enemies. He fought bravely till death. Singharan and a small band of remaining Khatri soldiers were caught alive. They were beheaded in Delhi, the next morning. Sarwarul Mulk also faced death penalty.

Even though the Muslim nobles eventually managed to crush the rebellion, it caused such irreversible damage that Sayyad dynasty collapsed within the reign of Muhammad Shah itself. While Muslim chroniclers have hurled much slanders at Sidhu Pal and Singharan, the two brave warriors were undoubtedly heroes for the Hindus.
