Ambedkar called on the Cabinet Delegation and the new Viceroy, Field Marshal Viscount Wavell. Wavell recorded a "Secret" memorandum about the discussion. Here too Ambedkar urged his case in the same words:

"The Scheduled Castes had beeen the earleist source of man-power for the East India Company's army, and so it was with their help that the British had conquered India," the Viceroy recorded Ambedkar as arguing.

"He (Ambedkar) thought that if India became independent, it would be one of the greatest disaster that could happen," Wavell recorded.
