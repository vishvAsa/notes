[ambeDkar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B._R._Ambedkar) 

Strived for respect and opportunities for the untouchable jAti-s - even at the cost of hinduism or Indian independence, an intelligent subversive inimical to hindus, used Christian categories to accomplish this (JDRoover [here](http://swarajyamag.com/politics/counterview-ambedkar-was-wrong-about-hinduism-the-right-can-stop-trying-to-appropriate-him)). As such he was a class opportunist.

> In 1942 Dr.Ambedkar's Golden Jubilee was celebrated. The function was presided over by Dr.M.R.Jayakar, a Hindu Maha Sabha leader. On this occasion, Veer Savarkar felicitated Dr.Ambedkar thus:
>
> Ambedkar's personality, erudition and capacity to lead and organize would have by themselves marked him out as an outstanding asset to our nation. But in addition to that, the inestimable services he has rendered to our motherland in trying to stamp out untouchability and the results he has achieved in instilling a manly spirit of self-confidence in millions of Depressed classes constitute an abiding, patriotic as well as humanitarian achievement. The very fact of the birth of such a towering personality among the so-called untouchables could not but liberate their souls from self depression and animate them to challenge the supererogatory claims of the so-called touchables.

He transformed into a hindu cultural nationalist ally ([CR12](../articles/ambedkar/bodhi-sattvas_hindutva/), [ambedkar_partition](http://www.columbia.edu/itc/mealac/pritchett/00ambedkar/ambedkar_partition/), sanskrit promotion [P1](http://i.imgur.com/h6N5vQ2.jpg) [T194909](https://twitter.com/Parikramah/status/582703386337792000),) when circumstances made the continuation of British empire unlikely.

He ultimately strived to ensure that dalita-s stay within the fold of dhArmic religions while rejecting caste hindu orthodoxy \[[T1936](https://twitter.com/parikramah/status/582704308262555648)\], a [clear thinker](http://www.ambedkar.org/pakistan/40C.Pakistan%20or%20the%20Partition%20of%20India%20PART%20II.htm) in regards to the security of hindustAn.

- "His education, encouraged and financed largely by the Gaikwad of Baroda, led to his role as the Untouchable's chief spokesman, the founder of a political party for Untouchables, and the moving spirit behind organizations, schools, and colleges established for their uplift."
- It is clear that bhImrAv Ambedkar was not an advocate of Indian independence (if not openly against it at times). For example, see AruN Shourie quote and Wavell's notes ([articles pages](../articles/ambedkar/)): "The Untouchables have stayed out of the Freedom Movement for good and strong reasons, he says again and again."
- His efforts to reactivate the mAhar regiment in the British army was only motivated by the desire for social upliftment rather than the "learn to fight and rebel" hopes of Savarkar.
- bhImrAv was (mostly willingly) a sort of enemy agent (someone used by the Brits to weaken and fracture the high caste Hindu dominated Indian independence movement). We would have got rid of untouchability etc.. (as the Japanese, Koreans, French and Spaniards did) without him as well, while preserving more of a feeling of national brotherhood. But he was somehow pumped up, like the khujliwal of Delhi. (That British would use these dalit leaders to subvert and fracture the hindus who were demanding that they leave is a no-brainer.)
- "In the 1930s and 40s, like other acclaimed heroes of social reform such as M.N. Roy and Periyar Ramaswamy Naicker, Dr. Ambedkar was literally a paid agent of the British, even becoming the Member for Labour of the Viceroy's Council." ([KE](http://koenraadelst.bharatvani.org/books/wiah/ch11.htm))
- This he did collude with the Brits (his big bet) and the Christians. \[eg [here](http://www.sakshitimes.net/blog/2008/09/22/dr-babasaheb-ambedkar-defender-of-conversions-and-a-friend-of-christianity-294/)\] It is only late in his life, after his attempts to convince the Brits to rule on with dalit help failed \[[AS_Redif](https://www.rediff.com/freedom/29ambed.htm), [WP](https://aryasamajvserranthindus.wordpress.com/2015/12/07/dalits-helped-british-conquer-india-b-r-ambedkar/)\] that he decided to tie dalit fate with buddhists so as to not denationalize them from the Hindu society where they found themselves.
- All this said, I do not begrudge bhImrAv - an intelligent enemy is better than a stupid friend. He knew when it was time to leave his treachery be. In that sense, it was far better that we deal with him than upper caste stupid "friends" such as the baldie and the chacha (without offence intended to anyone, this holds true today too).
- Among his bad legacies is a constitution that deviated from the spirit of the hindu dharmashAstra-s (explained [here](/AgamAH/hinduism/social-cultivation/dharma/)). “People always keep saying to me, oh, you are the maker of the Constitution. My answer is, I was a hack. What I was asked to do, I did much against my will. I am quite prepared to say that I shall be the first person to burn it. It does not suit anybody.” - B R Ambedkar on the floor of Rajya Sabha, on 2 Sep 1953, while debating in favour of the AP State formation.
