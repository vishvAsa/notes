### नीलकण्ठः सोमयाजी
-  (1444-1550)
- From the scanty biographical details given in the colophon of his commentary on the Ganita section of the Aryabhatiya and from a Malayalam work, Laghuramayanam, we learn that he was a Namputiri (Keḷallūr-illam), Ashvalayana Rigvedi of the Garga gotra  and  hailed  from  Silkundapura  or  Srikundagrama  (Malayalam,  Tr-k-kanti-yur)  near  Tirur  in  South Malabar,  a  place  which  in  medieval  times  rose  to  be  an  important  seat  of  Sanskrit  learning,  specially astronomy  and  mathematics.
- As  to  his  teachers,  besides  Damodara (son of parameshvara),  he  mentions  another  preceptor,  Ravi, versed in Vedanta. In his Siddhanta-darpana he refers to these two teachers. 
- Of the several works penned by Nilakantha, special mention may be madeof Golasara (Essence of the Sphere), Siddhanta-darpana (Mirror of Astronomy),  Candracchaya-ganita (Computations of the Moon‘s Shadow),  Tantrasangraha  (Collection  of  Astronomical  Works),  and  Aryabhatiya-bhasya  (Commentary  on the  Aryabhatiya).
- Nīlakaṇtha emphasized the need to accurately record use and observations, while critically examining and refining past theories (see jyotiSha notes).
- Nīlakaṇtha's greatest contribution to the world was his geoheliocentric cosmological model, which said the planets orbit the sun which in turn orbits the earth, one step ahead of the dominant geocentric view that had prevailed for millenia. The same model would be proposed by Tycho Brahe 200 years later.
- Somayājī's calculations on planetary orbit around the sun stayed the most accurate until Kepler published his work centuries later. It must be mentioned that his guru, Parameshvara was notable for providing 55 years worth of observed experimental data on eclipses which was made use of by Somayājī.
