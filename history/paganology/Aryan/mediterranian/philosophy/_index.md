## Theology
### Summary
- Among the patricians there were many views on religious aspects.
- Tired: gods are fake/just dead people, except the stars (euhemerism)
  - Euhemerus thought gods were men who lived earlier. Philosopher Panaetius, who was sceptic in religious views, was close to Scipio Aemilianus who carried on with religious traditions.
- Wired: gods are the elements, but also the elements are alive. And there are invisible god people (stoicism)
- Divinely inspired: Gods are hyperessential+++(=transcending substance and time)+++ henadic+++(=units of being)+++ hypostases+++(=underlying entities)+++ emanating a seira+++(=chain [of manifestations])+++ (neoplatonism)" - [KM](https://twitter.com/KaraMartiana/status/1077528569365049345)
- A good reference for platonism is [V's pages](https://vvasuki.github.io/saMskAra/kalpaH/general/tattvam/darshanam/).
