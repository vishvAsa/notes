## Early peopling
> mihirkula brought many V1s to revive culture in kAshmIra. I suspect sadyojyotis was among those v1s from roughly that time keeping with the idea of his Kashmirian locale. Also his focus on raurava-sUtrasaMgraha and svAyambhuva suggest an early age. - MT

## Later exoduses
- In 1990, kAshmIri muslims with and Islamic agenda forced out kAshmIri paNDit-s from the valley.
