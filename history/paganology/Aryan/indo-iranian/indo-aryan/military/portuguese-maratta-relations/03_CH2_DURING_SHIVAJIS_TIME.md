title = "03 CH2 DURING SHIVAJI’S TIME"

+++
While Shahaji, Shivaji’s father, was in the service of the Nizamshahi, his relations with  the Portuguese were friendly. In a letter from Bijapur reproduced in the daily journal of the  Portuguese Viceroy, Conde de Linhares, it is recorded that the annual income of Shahaji was  20,75,000 hons1and that his private army consisted of 3,000 horsemen.2In the same letter it is also mentioned that the son of Nizam Shah Murtuza was staying at Shahagad  (Xihagadda), i.e. Shahaji’s own residence.


Within four days of 26 September 1636,3 Shahaji addressed a letter to the Portuguese  Captain in charge of the Chaul fort. In this letter, Shahaji informed the captain that the eleven year-old Nizamshah was in his custody and that he was stationed at Balaghat in the fort of  Trimalvadi and that he was carrying on the governance of the Nizamshahi kingdom in the name of that boy-prince. Shahaji’s request was that the Portuguese should permit his family to stay in the Chaul fort in view of the fact that he had always maintained friendly relations with  them and wanted to ensure the safety of his family which was always in jeopardy because of  the enmity between him on the one hand and the Delhi Moghuls and Adilshahi kingdom of Bijapur on the other.


Shahaji had also added in this letter that, if the necessity arose, even he would seek  shelter in Chaul fort and, in return, even cede some territory from the Nizamshahi kingdom to the Portuguese if they wanted it, since it was all in his power. The Portuguese did not comply  with Shahaji’s request, as they feared this might arouse the hostility of Delhi and Bijapur. However, they informed Shahaji that if he wanted to remove his family to Danda-Rajpuri or some such place, they would secretly help him to do so.


Even after Shahaji entered the service of the Adilshahi, the Portuguese maintained friendly relations with him as is clear from a letter of the Portuguese Viceroy, Conde de Alvora,  which mentioned the traditional friendship between Shahaji and the King of Portugal.4


In 1654, Padre Gonsalo Martez was posted at Bijapur as Portuguese envoy. In the  instrument of instructions given to him by the then Portuguese Governor, Don Braz de  Castro, it was noted that Fateh Khan, Shahaji and Malik Yakut would side with the  Portuguese in the Adilshahi court.5



Rajwade writes in his preface to the Radhamadhava-vilasachampu by Jayaram  Pandey that Shahaji had invaded Goa in shaka 1576, Vaishakha Jyeshtha (page 93).  Portuguese documents in the Goa Archives, however, show that this Adilshahi invasion of  Salçette and Bardez was made on 12 August, 1654 under the command of Abdul Hakim. A  number of Hindus and Catholics of prestige joined Abdul Hakim in this campaign. Among  them was Kalu Shenvi Korgaonkar. Some gavkars of Hanjun, known as Porobs, also joined in  this intrigue. The well-known Catholic Bishop of Bicholim, Don Molias de Castro, a Goan,  was also one of the conspirators. But nowhere is Shahaji’s name mentioned in connection  with this invasion.6


In 1657, Shahaji demanded of Ali Adilshah the Mahals of Bhatagram and Pernem in the  vicinity of Bardez, then under Adilshahi domination, for his maintenance.7


The earliest Portuguese document in the Goa Archives which makes mention of Shivaji  is dated 28 November, 1657. It is stated in it that Shahaji’s son had taken possession of  Upper Chaul. The Portuguese Viceroy, in his letter to the king of Portugal dated 15 May, 1658  also mentions Shivaji as Shahaji’s son.8


In 1659, Shivaji laid the foundation of the Mahratta navy. The following reference  occurs to the event in the Goa Archives : “A son of Shahaji, the rebel [militant] nobleman of  the Adilshahi court has captured the territory around Chaul and Bassein and has become  quite powerful. He has built some men-of-war in Bhimdi, Kalyan and Panvel, ports in Bassein  Taluka. We are forced, therefore, to be cautious. To ensure that these men-of-war do not set  sail, we have ordered the Portuguese Captain not to let them come out of these ports.”9


The Portuguese used to build their ships, armed and others, in several ports of  Bassein Taluka. The frigate Santo Antonio de Thana equipped with 50 guns was one of those  built in 1681 at Thana.10 At the time there lived at Bassein some skilled Portuguese carpenters  and other artisans. Shivaji built his first twenty armed ships (sanguiceis) with the help of two  of these artisans, Roe Leitao Viegas and his brother Fernao Leitao Viegas. Shivaji had


declared that these ships were built to meet the menace of the Siddi of Janjira. About 340  workmen, Portuguese and others, worked under the supervision of Roe Viegas. Including  their families, they were about 400 people. There is a letter from Joao de Salazar de  Vascocelos in the Arquivo Historico Ultramarino in which it is said that the number of people  employed by Shivaji on ship-building were 300.11 It is also obvious from the complaint that  Raja Jaisingh made to the Portuguese that there were some Portuguese men in Shivaji’s army.12 Not only this, but there is evidence that the Portuguese Viceroy had by a  proclamation made on 19 May, 1668, ordered all Portuguese nationals in the service of the  Delhi, Bijapur and Shivaji armies to return to Portugal.13 Antonio de Melo de Castro made a



frantic effort to withdraw all the Portuguese from Shivaji’s service even before his warships  had been completed, because they would have been a source of trouble not only to the Siddi but to the Portuguese also. As a result of this, one day, all Portuguese in Shivaji’s service quit  their jobs and fled to Bombay and Bassein.14


No information is available on what happened to these twenty men-of-war, in the  Portuguese Archives. They were, in all probability, completed. No Portuguese document  speaks of their having been destroyed. In April or May 1662, the Governor of Goa says in a  letter that Ragho Ballal, Subedar of Dabhol, had requested him to allow five warships  (sanguiceis) and one pataxo interned in the Karanja creek to go out to the sea. The Governor  suggested to his Officers that they find some courageous person who would secretly set  these ships on fire.15 But there is no evidence of any such thing having happened.


The Captain of Chaul wrote to the Governor of Goa in August 1664 that Shivaji was  building 50 ships in Upper Chaul and that seven of them were ready to set out to sea. The  Portuguese adopted the policy of not obstructing their passage in view of Shivaji’s ever growing power.16 In this way, Shivaji’s navy went on gaining strength to such an extent and at  such speed that Vice-Rei Conde de San Vincente was constrained, at the end of 1667, to write to the King of Portugal : “I am afraid of Shivaji’s naval ships. We did not take sufficient  preventive steps and so he has built many a fort on the Konkan Coast. Today he has several ships and they are large ones.”17


Shivaji’s fleet consisted mostly of galvetas18 They were small but speedy—which gave  them an advantage over the slow, large-sized Portuguese ships. Shivaji’s ships captured or  looted tending ships from Malabar and other parts of Indin. A Portuguese biographer of  Shivaji writes that his ships did not molest European warships.19


Even in the days of Shivaji, the Portuguese considered themselves as supreme in the  Indian Ocean. As has been said earlier, trading ships from the territories of Bijapur, Delhi and  Shivaji were required to secure permits for plying from the Portuguese. For securing these  permits (cartazes) a fee had to be paid and certain conditions had to be complied with. The  Portuguese often found Shivaji’s ships without such permits and these ships were seized by  them. Similarly, there were cases of Shivaji’s ships seizing trading vessels from Portuguese  territory.20 But there were scarcely any armed engagements between the Portuguese and Mahratta fleets.


On one occasion, Shivaji’s fleet seized 121 trading ships from the Karnatak ports of  Honavar, Manglore, Barcelor and Gangoli (Cambolim). Cosme de Guarda, Portuguese  biographer of Shivaji recounts that the Portuguese Viceroy, Antonio de Melo de Castro, on



hearing of this ordered his son, the Commodore of the Portuguese fleet in the Buy of Goa at this time, to secure the release of these ships.21 Shivaji had twenty-five ships, while de Castro  had eight. Of the 25 Mahratta warships, 13 were in the vanguard of the convoy followed by  the captured vessels and twelve warships covered the rear of the convoy. The two fleets met  near Mormugoa. Castro attacked the ships in the Mahratta vanguard and captured them. Those in the rear fled. Castro returned with the 13 captured warships and the trading ships to  Goa. Shivaji sent an envoy to the Portuguese Viceroy to offer an apology for what had happened and asked for the return of his warships. The Portuguese granted his request.


There are some documents in the Goa Archives about this incident.22 There are some  letters about it in the Arquivo Historico Ultramarino, Lisboa, also. In a letter dated 16 April, 1665 from Antonio de Melo de Castra to Krishnaji Bhasker, Subedar of Shivaji, the Viceroy  mentions that the captured ships were released but does not mention their number.23 In a letter dated 4 June 1665 preserved in the Goa archives, the same Viceroy wrote to his  brother, Francisco de Melo and Diago de Melo who was in the service of the Moghul  Emperor, to say that the number of ships captured by the Portuguese from the Mahrattas, was eleven.24


Dr. Surendranath Sen says that this battle between eight Portuguese ships and  Shivaji’s fleet must have been fought after Shivaji’s invasion of Barcelor.25 The Viceroy’s letter to Krishnaji Bhaskar also bears this out. That Shivaji’s fleet came to Mormugoa and prevented  the Portuguese warships from taking trading vessles loaded with rice to Goa is what the  Viceroy says in his letter of 4 June 1665 to his brother.26 By November 1664, the news had spread that Shivaji’s fleet would attack Basnur and other ports on the Karnatak Coast and the  people there had become panicky. Shivappa Nayak of Iquery had taken from the Portuguese,  during 1653-54, the ports of Gangoli, Barcelor, Honavar and Manglore. Narayan Mahalo was working as an intermediary between Shivappa Nayak and the Portuguese, negotiating for the  return of these forts to the Portuguese and for this purpose an armed ships, the S. Jacinto,  had been despatched under the command of Don Manoel Lobo de Silveira to take  possession of them.


This de Silveira wrote to the Viceroy in a letter dated 30 November 1664 from Gangoli that the people there were frightened because of the reported and impending invasion of  Shivaji. If he did actually come, the people would run away and he would capture the whole  coast. People from Mirjan, Ankola, Shiveshwar and Karwar were in panic and if Shivaji took  these forts he would proceed to take the fort of Honavar also.27 When Shivaji looted Basroor, the S. Jacinto was probably not there.



In a letter written to Raoji Somnath Subedar by Vice-Rei Conde de Melo Castro on 26  March 1665, there is a reference to a battleship of the Portuguese (navio) having been taken  captive by Shivaji’s fleet.28 One more Portuguese warship (pataxo) was taken captive by Shivaji’s fleet in November 1670 while it was sailing for Surat from Daman. In retaliation, the Portuguese captured eleven unarmed Mahratta cargo ships (barcos de carga) and took them  to Bassein. Not only were the ships unarmed, but they were also empty and unimportant  according to the Governor of Goa who wrote to this effect to the Captain of Bassein in a letter  dated 13 December 1670.29


A letter from the Portuguese factory at Surat dated 17 December 1670 stated that the  Portuguese had captured twelve Mahratta ships30 and this erroneous statement has been  relied upon by Shivaji’s biographers.31 There is a letter in the Goa Archives of a Don, Aleico de  Almeida who states therein that he had taken part twice in naval battles with Shivaji’s fleet.32


Once a battle was fought in the gulf of Kelshi (enseada de Quellocy) when three ships from  Shivaji’s fleet were captured and on a second occasion, at the same place, a battle was  fought involving eighteen Mahratta ships, three of which were captured and on a second  occasion, at the same place, a battle was fought involving eighteen Mahratta ships, three of  which were captured by the Portuguese. Which of these two battles the said de Almeida  refers to is difficult to say. But it is a reliable statement based on certificates (certidoes) of  appropriate officers.


When Shivaji began to build up his fleet, it was, as has been stated before, for use  against the Siddi of Danda-Rajpuri.33 In the Siddi-Shivaji conflicts, the Portuguese helped the  Siddi. When Shivaji set some of his horsemen and infantry on the Siddi in July 1659, the  Portuguese Captains at Chaul and Bassein supplied foodgrains to the Siddi and helped him in  other ways also. Shivaji complained about this to the Vice-Rei. Because of this, the Portuguese decided from then on, to help the Siddi stealthily and not openly.34


The Portuguese were well-disposed towards the Siddi and to persuade them openly  to ally with him, the Siddi accepted Portuguese overlordship in 1667.35 In May 1669, Shivaji besieged Danda-Rajpuri. The Portuguese supplied ammunitions and foodgrains to the Siddi  and met his other requirements surreptitiously and instructed the Captain of Chaul that, if the  Siddi was prepared to hand over the Dada-Rajpuri fortress to the Portuguese, he should take possession of it.36


On 10, February 1670, Shivaji entered into a pact of friendship with the Portuguese.37 One of the terms of the pact was that, since the Siddi had accepted the overlordship of the  Portuguese, they were under an obligation to protect him; but since this ran counter to the  new friendship between the Portuguese and the Mahrattas, the Portuguese would use all their


CONTENTSinfluence to mediate between the Siddi and Shivaji with a view to concluding a treaty between  them to their mutual satisfaction. Vithalpant went to Goa as Shivaji’s envoy to finalise these  arrangements.


In March 1671, news was received in Goa that Shivaji had laid siege to Danda-Rajpuri  by land and sea and that there was a strong probability of the fort going over to Shivaji. If that  happened, it would be a menace to Chaul. Though it would have been proper for the  Portuguese to remain neutral in this conflict in view of the new treaty of friendship, the  Portuguese Viceroy estimated the situation as dangerous for the Portuguese and decided to  supply the Siddi with ammunition.38


In May the same year (1671), the Captain of Chaul informed the Portuguese Viceroy  that, since Shivaji had besieged Danda-Rajpuri, the position of the Siddi had much worsened  and that he was helping the Siddi in keeping with the Viceroy’s orders.39 The Captain also  wrote that the Siddi had no money to pay his soliders and that therefore he had returned to  the Siddi the ransom he had paid which was credited to the Chaul treasury. In reply, the  Portuguese Vicerory not only approved of this action, but also ordered the Captain of Chaul  to pay the Siddi Rs. 2,000 in addition. He also instructed that ammunition should be secretly  given to the Siddi and that if the Siddi was ready to hand over the fortress, it should be taken over. It was held by the Viceroy that if Shivaji captured Danda-Rajpuri, not only would  Revdanda and Korlai (Morro) be endangered, but the whole western coast. The importance  of this fort had been recognised by Portuguese statesmen right from the days of Afonso de  Albuquerque.40 In a letter written from Chaul on 25 March 1677, the Portuguese Captain  stated that Moropant Pingle, Shivaji’s Peshwa, was waiting in Upper Chaul with cavalry and  infantry for Annajipant to join him with more troops. He administered the Konkan as far as  Goa. Shivaji’s fleet was stationed at Nagao—there were ten warships (galvetas) and thirteen other ships.41


Joao Fuzeiro de Sande wrote in a letter from Chaul dated 2 May 1677, that the  Peshwa was in the vicinity of Danda with Durat khan’s (Daulat khan’s) fleet, that he had  9,000 troops, that he would lead an assault on Danda-Rajpuri and, further, that there was a  rumour that the Siddi had gone over to him. If this was correct, the Siddi would hand over the  fortress to the Peshwa.42 It is not known how the Portuguese in Goa reached to this but early  in September 1679, the Viceroy received a letter from the Captain of Chaul in which he said  that Shivaji was preparing to build a fort on Kennery (Khanderi-Underi) islands,43 and in  pursuit of this project, 2,000 of his men had already gone over to Upper Chaul and 3,000  more would soon join them. He added that Shivaji had ordered that if the Portuguese obstructed his plans, they were to be resisted. In order to counter this move, the Siddi was


preparing to build twelve galvetas.



The Governor called his Council together to consider this letter and decided to prevent Shivaji from building the Khanderi-Uderi fort. But when he learnt that the English from Bombay were going to oppose Shivaji’s project, he decided to remain neutral. The English  asked the Portuguese to join hands with them but they put forward the excuse of their having  entered into a treaty of friendship with Shivaji and rejected the proposal. Still, the Portuguese assured help in the form of foodgrains etc.


Just as the Portuguese were inclined towards the Siddi as against Shivaji, they also  helped the Adilshani of Bijapur as against Shivaji and, in any event, at least remained neutral  between them. But they never sided with Shivaji. They were obliged to adopt this attitude to  maintain balance of power. Besides, before Shivaji conquered the Konkan, Adilshah was the  neighbour or the Portuguese.


In the Shivaji-Moghul conflict, the Portuguese secretly helped Shivaji, because they  considered Delhi to be a greater menace. Since the days of Humayun, the Portuguese policy  was that all powers in South India should resist Moghul aggression from the north.44


At the end of May 1663, Shivaji went to Vengurla via Kudal. Adilshah’s havildars in  Bhatagram (Bicholim) and Sanquelim (Satari) fled. Antonio de Melo de Castro, Vice-Rei of  Goa, said that Shivaji would not attack Goa because he could not simultaneously fight Delhi,  Bijapur and Goa, but if he did, he was prepared for it.45 When he learnt that Shivaji had gone  to Vengurla, he sent Shivaji a letter dated 2, June 1663 congratulating him on his victory over


Bijapur.46 He sent it with Ramoji Shenvi Kothari. But Ramoji Kothari learnt on his way that  Shivaji had gone back and so he also returned to Goa. Ramoji had previously lived at Bicholim  and was well disposed towards Shivaji.47 Shivaji appointed Raoji Somnath Pandit as Subedar at Kudal.


Shivaji had intended to conquer the Konkan territory as far as Mirajan48 but be did not  do so. At this time, Kudal, Pernem, Satari, Maneri and Bhatagram, which constituted  Adilshahi territory, passed under him. The Mirjan river was generally regarded as the southern  limit of the Konkan in Shivaji’s times.49 It is on record that Shivaji had told the Dutch officers at  Vengurla that the Sultan of Bijapur had made a present of Kudal territory to him.50 In a letter of the Governor of Goa dated 7 January 1669, it is stated that, by a treaty of friendship, Adilshah  had given the whole of Southern Konkan to Shivaji.51 Shivaji was laying claim to Salçette and  Bardez then in the possession of the Portuguese on the ground that they were originally  Adilshahi territory.52 Ibrahim Adilshah had given Salçette and Bardez to the Portuguese on  certain conditions in 1543, thanks to Mealkhan. The Portuguese did not fully observe these  conditions but did not give up possession of both territories. On this account, several battles  were fought between the Portuguese and the Adilshahi.53 The last of these battles were



fought in 1654 and 1659.54 Shivaji must have been posted with some information in this matter.


The letter of the Dutch factory at Vengurla, referred to earlier, states that Shivaji’s  statement that Adilshah had made over the Kudal territory to him was untrue. On the  contrary, Adilshah had ordered his Subedar at Ponda, Trimbak Kalu (Trumbeg Calo) to expel  Shivaji from Kudal with the help of the four Desais, Lakham Savant, Keshav Naik, Khalu  Shenvi and Chanda Rana. If Trimbak Kalu did not succeed, Bijapur was to send a large army


to attack Shivaji.55 Of these Desais, Lakham Savant was of Kudal, Keshav Naik of Pernem,  Khalu Shenvi of Bhatagram (Bicholim) and Chanda Rana was of Sanquelim (Satari).


Just before June 1664, Captain Aziz Khan of Adilshah defeated Shivaji’s troops at  Kudal.56 Keshav Naik, Desai of Pernem and Keshav Prabhu fled for fear of Adilshah and  sought asylum with the Portuguese.57 According to a letter of the Viceroy dated 10 December  1669, Mir Mahamed Kasim was Adilshah’s havaldar at Bicholim (Bhatagram),58 and at


Sanquelim.59 From this letter, it would appear that between December 1663 and January  1664 Adilshah ruled over Bhatagram and Satari and not Shivaji.


In the middle of December 1664 Shivaji won a victory over Khavas Khan, Captain of  Adilshah, near Kudal and forced him to flee up the ghat.60 On this occasion, Shivaji looted  Bicholim and the border areas of Goa from Raibag to Sahapur.61 After this Shivaji’s writ ran again in the Konkan except in Ponda Panchmahal. Lakham Savant of Kudal, Keshav Naik and  Keshav Prabhu of Pernem, Khalu Shenvi of Bicholim. All Desais of Konkan, who fought Shivaji under the command of Khavas Khan took shelter with the Portuguese in different places.62 Of  these Desais, Lakham Savant fought Shivaji alongside Khavas Khan till the end and did not  run away to Goa till 13 December 1664. Jedhe Shakavali notes that this victory was won by  Shivaji over Khavas Khan in October-November 1664, i.e. Shake 1586, in the month of Kartik,  the name of the year being Krodha.


This victory of Shivaji is mentioned also in a letter of the Viceroy of Goa dated 7 January, 1665.63 It is clear from this that Shivaji had pushed Khavas khan up the ghat before  this date. The fight of the Desais and the Bijapur Havaldar at Vengurla is mentioned in the  Viceroy’s letter to Khavas Khan of 13 December, 1664.64 The Viceroy took it for granted that  Khavas Khan had been till then in the Konkan. It appears, therefore, that because the Desais fled to Goa a few days before 13 December, Shivaji’s victory over Khavas Khan was won  about the same date. Till this date, the Viceroy of Goa had no news of this victory.65


The Viceroy was informed by Keshav Naik and Keshav Prabhu, Desais of Pernem, a day or two before 11 November 1664, that a skirmish had taken place between Shivaji and



Khavas Khan.66 The Viceroy wrote a letter of welcome to Shivaji when he reached the  neighbourhood of Goa on 25 November 1664.67 On 29 November, the Viceroy said in a  meeting of padres that Shivaji had advanced with a large army and that Adilshah’s large force was also coming down the ghat.68 On 13 December, the Viceroy wrote a congratulatory letter to the envoy of Bijapur on the occasion of Khavas Khan’s victory over Shivaji.69 But this victory was shortlived. Shivaji routed Khavas Khant soon after and sent him running up the ghat and established Mahratta authority over the Konkan.


Shivaji appointed Krishna Savant as Deshmukh of Kudal (11 November 1664).70 The Viceroy of Goa, Antonio de Melo de Castro informed the King of Portugal in his letter dated 7  January 1665 that Khavas Khan had approached Goa with 2000 horsemen and a large force of  infantry, but Shivaji had put him to rout and pushed him up the ghat and liberated Konkan. Not only this, but Shivaji had pursued the enemy almost to the gates of the City of Bijapur.71


On 5 December, 1664 Shivaji laid the foundation-stone of his seafortress,  Sindhudurga. In the Shivaji chronicle by Chitragupta, it is stated that “a hundred skilled  workmen who knew about the construction of sea forts were called for from the Portuguese” for the purpose. But there is no mention of any of their skilled workmen having helped Shivaji  in any Portuguese document. Gaspar Correa writes (Lenda Ⅲ, 639) that Adilkhan employed  the services of Portuguese workmen for building the Belgaum Castle. Even the Firangi tower  of Bijapur appears to have been built by the Portuguese as its name indicates but no  contemporary document mentions that the Portuguese gave any help for the construction of  Sindhurga at Malvan.72


It has already been said that, as between the Moghuls and Shivaji, the Portuguese  preferred to side with Shivaji. According to the Viceroy of Goa who informed the King of  Portugal to that effect, when Shivaji returned with the Surat loot, he departed by the  Portuguese border, because he wanted to take shelter with them if the need arose. The  Viceroy had even expressed satisfaction that Shivaji came out of the raid unscathed.73 Because the Portuguese were sympathetic to Shivaji in the Surat affair, the Moghul captain,  Lodi Khan, led an attack on Bassein territory, captured a number of villages and destoryed  some. Finally, with great difficulty, the Portuguese entered into a treaty of friendship with Lodi  Khan.74 Even when Raja Jayasingh invaded the Deccan, the Portuguese policy in the  beginning was one of secretly helping Shivaji.75 The Portuguese had told him that, if it became  necessary, he should come down to Goa and not seek shelter in Chaul.76 Later, after the  Treaty of Purandar was concluded, the Portuguese had to change their policy for fear of the  Moghuls and, on 17 November 1666, they made a treaty of friendship with them.77 It was  obvious that it was made mainly to ensure that the Portuguese should give no quarter to



Shivaji.78 The draft of this treaty was probably presented to the Viceroy of Goa by Kojya  Allauddin, envoy of Raja Jayasingh, a few days before 17 November 1666.79


In March 1666, Shivaji besieged the Ponda fort. The Portuguese thought it would be  dangerous if the fort fell to Shivaji and so they secretly supplied ammunition to the fort and  also arranged secretly to escort all the Konkan Desais who were partisans of Bijapur to the  fort via the Chapora river.80 It would have been difficult for Bijapur to hold out in the Ponda  Fort even for a week, but thanks to Portuguese help, the protagonists of Bijapur held out till


Rustamjama came to their aid.81 Rustam came down the ghat and the siege was lifted. He  also brought Kudal, Pernem, Ponda, Bhatagram (Bicholim) and Satari (Sanquelim) under Adilshahi control. Vice-Rei Antonio de Melo de Castro wrote to the Captain of Chaul on 8 March 1666 to say that Rustamjama had come down the ghat and that Shivaji would soon  withdraw.82


After the evacuation of Ponda, Shivaji proceeded to Agra to meet Aurangzed and was  imprisoned by the Emperor. On 29 August 1666, he escaped from detention and, according  to the Shivapur Yadi, reached Raigad on 11 December 1666. In the opinion of Sir Janunath  Sarkar, Shivaji reached Raigad within 25 days of his leaving Agra, i.e. on 23 September  1666.83 If that is so, neither Raja Jayasingh nor the Portuguese Viceroy knew about it till 17  November 1666.84 Had they heard the news, the Portuguese would certainly not have entered  into a treaty with the Moghuls. As they did at the time.85 From Jayasingh’s letter dated 25  November 1666 it is clear that he had no idea that Shivaji had returned.86


Vice-Rei Conde de San Vincente informed the King of Portugal about Shivaji’s escape  from Agra in a letter dated 20 September 1667 in which he said that, “after escaping from Moghul detention, Shivaji travelled for 36 hours in fruit boxes which were closed. When he  reached his native hilly country, he sent his troops to many places to collect loot. Adilshah  sent an army of 40000 horsemen and a large number of infantry to intercept Shivaji. When this  army descended from the ghat, Shivaji presented a large treasure to the general, as a result  of which he resorted to arson in his own master’s territory and returned with plunder. This  general had come as close as twelve miles from Goa and we therefore considered him a  menace. Soon after the Bijapur army went back, Shivaji expeditiously came down to Konkan  and gained even a larger treasure than he had parted with. Shivaji has subdued and brought


under his control a number of Desais and he is now our neighbour at Ponda. His alacrity,  valour, alertness and military foresight are of the order of Ceaser and Alexander. He is  omnipresent and has no definite place of residence.”87


In the Vice-Rei’s letter dated 10 November 1666 it was stated that a Bijapur general,  one Haibatrao, had come down the ghat into the Konkan to fight Shivaji.88 On the same date,



the Vice-Rei wrote a letter to Prataprao who had been appointed Subedar of the Konkan by Adilshaha.89 From the Vice-Rei’s letter dated 26 November 1666 it would seem that Mian Abdul Mahomed, a Bijapur general, had come to the Konkan.90


After his escape from Agra, Shivaji regained all the territory of Konkan that Adilshah had taken from him except Ponda, Jambavli Panchmahal and Goa which were held by the  Portuguese. He had probably captured some villages around the Ponda fort.91 Lakham  Savant, Keshav Naik and Keshav Prabhu; all Konkan Desais and protagonists of Bijapur, often encroached upon Shivaji’s territory and terrorised the people. Often the Portuguese officers were in league with them.


These Desais received good treatment in Goa. On one occasion, Vice-Rei Conde de  San Vincente had even threatened to punish the Rector of Colvale for having compelled the  Pernem Desais to listen to a sermon. The Vice-Rei was very particular that they should not be  molested on account of their religion.92 This sermon incident occurred on or about 12 October  1667. But it is obvious from Vergel de Plantas e Flores da Provincia da Madre de Deos dos  Copuchos Reformados by Fr. Jacinto de Deos, published in Lisbon in 1690, that he was  resolutely trying to convert to Christianity those Hindus who were resident in Bardez. Permission was granted to publish this book in 1680. It records that “In 1667, through the


favour93 of Vice-Rei Conde de San Vincente, 7,000 Hindus from Bardez were baptised; efforts  to convert the remaining 3,000 to Christianity are being made and in all probability they will adopt the faith.”94 Similarly, Pais Dos Christaunce said in his statement made on 5 January 1678 that “But for Vice-Rei Conde de San Vincente’s untimely death, most of the Hindus in Goa island and Bardez would have become Christians, like those in Salçette.95


This Viceroy had issued a notification on 21 September 1667 that all Hindus should quit  the limits of Bardez within a period of two months. This notification is not to be found in the  Goa Archives but the present author found it mentioned in manuscript No. 8538 in Biblioteca Nacional de Lisboa, in 1954.96 Later, he also obtained a copy of it in Biblioteque Nationale de  Paris. It was published by him first in Assentos de Conselho do Estado, Part Ⅳ (p. 560) in  1956. The reasons given by the Vice-Rei in this notification for the expulsion of Hindus were  that their presence affected the loyalty of the Christians to their religion; that the Hindus had  risen in revolt against the King of Portugal several times; and that, in 1654, when Abdul Hakim  invaded Goa, many a Hindus turned traitor and joined the enemy against the Portuguese.


Religious persecution of Hindus in Goa was, more or less, a normal feature for many years before the birth of Shivaji. The Hindu subjects of Aurangzeb had also to undergo similar  religious persecution.97 Even in the Bijapur kingdom, the Hindus were, often enough, similarly mal-treated.98 How Goa under Portuguese rule became Christian is sufficiently known  today,99 and need not be elaborately discussed here. The Hindus in Goa were accustomed to



religious persecution by the Portuguese and were trying to wriggle out of their troubles  somehow or other.


In the situation, the notification of expulsion issued in Bardez in 1667 was not a bolt  from the blue for the Hindus. A similar notification had been issued by Vice-Rei Conde de  Linhares against the Hindus of Salçette on 11 January 1633.100 The same had happened in the  island of Goa in 1560.101 Cujos regio illus religio was an accepted principle in Goa policy and


laws were promulgated in keeping with it. It meant : Whatever the religion of the ruler is the religion of the subjects.102


While this was the state of things in Bardez, Narba Savant, a nephew of Lakham  Savant, Desai of Kudal, one of those Desais who had come to Goa, having taken fright at  Shivaji’s movements, went to Vengurla on 15 September 1667, caused a riot and molested the Dutch. He was accompanied by some Portuguese. The Dutch of Vengurla protested  against this to the Portuguese and probably complained to Shivaji also.103 These Desais who  were sheltered in Bardez often returned to their original seats of power (vatans) and terrorised people in the neighbouring territory controlled by Shivaji. In order to capture them  and also punish the Portuguese who had harboured them. Shivaji despatched an army of 1,000 cavalry and 5,000 infantry to Bardez on 19/20 November 1667.104


For three days (20-22 November) Shivaji’s troops plundered a number of villages and  arrested hundreds of people.105 Among them were many women and children. A  contemporary Dutch report says that they killed three padres and a number of Christians.106 On this occasion, Shivaji distributed some leaflets addressed to the people and some people  followed the instructions therein. Such was the allegation of the Vice-Rei who appointed Dr.  Francisco de Silva Fosch on 4 May 1668 to inquire into this. Of this there is evidence.107


There is a report made by the Franciscan padres on this invasion of Bardez by Shivaji  written in Goa in 1724 which is deposited in the Biblioteca Nacional de Lisboa.108 The author  believes that, though it was written many years afterwards, it was based on the records of the Franciscan Fathers. This report says :


“As the Portuguese had harboured Keshav Naik, a Desai, in the village of Colvale in  Bardez, Shivaji invaded Bardez with a large army and went straight to Colvale in search of  Keshav Naik. He cut to pieces many a Christian he came across on his way as revenge  against the Portuguese who had given asylum to Keshav Naik. He killed Fr. Manoel de San  Bernanden, Rector of Colvale, in order to frighten the Franciscan fathers and shut them in  their residences. This padre was a Goa-born Portuguese. He came out of the church door to  investigate on hearing hoarse shouts and, as soon as he was out of doors, he was put to



death by a Cutelo. Fr. Joao das Nevice, a Portuguese padre, was his guest in the church. He  had just then been appointed Commisario Geral. He was not aware what was going on  outside and probably thought that some enemy was near by and so be too came out. He too  was murdered, suffering 18 wounds. The padre knelt on the ground, threw his hands up and  stared heavenwards while receiving the strokes of the sword. The enemy then departed. His  efforts were futile, because the Desai who was being traced was not found. For more than  four days the dead bodies of the two padres and others were not removed as most of the  Bardez people had field and sought shelter in Reis Magos and Aguada forts.”


As the Portuguese Viceroy had received news of the impending invasion of Bardez by  Shivaji through his spies four days earlier, he had enough time to make arrangements for the  protection of the Portuguese and Keshav Naik, Lakham Savant and other Desais who were  then in Goa.


Vice-Rei Conde de San Vincente wrote to his secretary on 15 November 1667 that  more of Shivaji’s troops and ships were marching towards Goa, according to tidings received  by him, and so the fortresskeepers of Thivim and Caisuv (Chapora) should be instructed to  be ready. Similar instructions should be given, he said, to the Ranes of Revade and Nanode,  so that they too might be on the alert. They were to be instructed to prohibit entry of outsiders  in their areas. The refugee Desais, he instructed, should also be asked to be prepared with  their troops and Fernav Vaz de Sequeira was alerted and asked to keep his warships in  readiness to meet Shivaji’s fleet if the need arose.109 The Ranes of Rewade, Nanode and  Peirna, villages under Portuguese control on the outskirts of Bardez, were used by the  Portuguese as bases against the Mahrattas.110 Some of these Ranes had embraced  Christianity. Don Lucas de Lisboa Ranne and Don Lourenço de Lisboa Ranne are famous.


The Viceroy himself proceeded to meet the army of Shivaji and they came face to face  on 22 November. In a letter addressed to the Goa city municipality on 29 December, 1667, the Viceroy said : there were several reasons for not leaving the city of Goa when I went to  Bardez. When I fought the enemy I had only 84 Portuguese, including Fidaldos and Soldados. God willed that we should win a great victory, that our enemy should ignominiously retire from  the battlefield and crave for a peace as we wanted it.” In a letter written to fortress-keeper of Raitur on 29 November, the Viceroy says, “Shivaji is begging for peace and he is going to  return all that he has carried away from Bardez.111


Vice-Rei Conde de San Vincente placed on recoed that the Dutch officers in India  were ordered from Holland that they should ally with Adilshah and, since he had informed Shivaji about this, Shivaji did not raise any objection to entering into a treaty of friendship with  the Portuguese Besides, the Viceroy complained, Shivaji had allowed the Portuguese to open



a factory at Dabhol.112 The Negotiations for a treaty between Shivaji and the Portuguese  began after. 20 November, 1667. On 23 November, the Viceroy informed Shivaji that he too  was anxious to make peace. On 24 November, the Viceroy wrote a reply to another letter from Shivaji and said that maintenance of peace between him and the Portuguese was in his (Shivaji’s) hands. On a request from Shivaji, on 24 November, the Viceroy sent Ramoji  Shenvi Kothari to Shivaji as his envoy to carry on peace talks. He did so and returned immediately. He carried a letter from Shivaji to the Viceroy, who sent a reply on 27 November. Shivaji was then at Bicholim near Goa,113 and hence such speedy negotiations were possible.


Sakopant went to Goa as Shivaji’s envoy. It was with this envoy that the Viceroy concluded a treaty of friendship on 5 December 1667. When the envoy returned to Raigad,  the Viceroy sent a Jesuit Padre, Gonsalo Martence with him. The treaty was endorsed by the  Mahratta. Government on 12 December (25 Jamadilakhar). The text of the treaty is both in  Marathi and Portuguese. In the Portuguese version it is said that the treaty was endorsed on 5  December 1667. In the Marathi version, the date is mentioned as 6 December. The date in the  Marathi version is wrong. The Marathi version says that there is both the emblem and the  signature of Shivaji but in both the versions only the emblem of Shivaji is to be seen and not  his singature. There is no positive proof of Shivaji being literate in the source materials,  whether in Goa, Portugal or Paris. The author has not came across a single letter signed by  him in the Goa Archives. Dr. Balkrishna has said that the Portuguese have recorded that


Shivaji could read and write.114 But the two items of evidence given by him to establish  Shivaji’s literacy are not conclusive or convincing.115 Signed (assinado) does not mean that  the person concerned necessarily wrote in his own hand. Even if only the emblem was  impressed, assinado was the word used for that function. Sir Janunath Sarkar says that the  Marathi text of the treaty was written by Moro Pingale himself.116 But the many Portuguese  words used in it, like Vice-Rei, Novembro, Padre and Dezembro, show that it was Ramoji  Shenvi Kothari Who probably wrote it out.


There is no mention whatever about the religious persecution of Hindus in the  correspondence between the Mahrattas and the Portuguese concerning shivaji’s invasion of Bardez. The Vice-Rei had given GonsaIo Martence for his guidance a note of instructions  (Instruçoes) when he went to Raigad as the Portuguese envoy with the text of the treaty. The note prescribed what matters he should touch on in his conversation with Shivaji. There is no mention in it of the problem of the Bardez Hindus. If Shivaji had any grievance or complaint in  this behalf, its echoes should surely have been heard in this note of instructions.


There is only one point which has been continuously emphasised in the correspondence between the Viceroy and Shivaji since the beginning, i.e. from 23 November, viz. Shivaji’s complaint against the Desais of Kudal, Pernem and Bicholim who were living in



Goa. Even in the treaty of 1667, the same subject has been handled. If there is no relation of  cause and effect between the notification issued by Conde de San Vicente against the Bardez Hindus and Shivaji’s invasion of Bardez in 1667, why were the two padres and several Christians put to death? This question naturally arises but it is not difficult to answer it satisfactorily. Why the Mahrattas killed the padres is explained in the report of the Franciscan padres themselves which has been mentioned earlier.


There were hundreds of padres ih Bardez at that time. Two of them were done to  death because they were found out of doors.117 This action was not premeditated. There is no  mention anywhere of Shivaji having ever attacked monasteries or the residences of Catholic  priests. Padres often participated in battles as armed soldiers and therefore met with


resistence from the enemy. That they were not non-violent preachers must not be lost sight  of.118


The Portuguese have greatly admired R. Joao de Deos for having attacked the  Mahrattas as a skilled marksman on the occasion of Sambhaji’s invasion of Goa.119 The Portuguese have also recorded that the Mahrattas considered Portuguese priests excellent  soldiers.120 Besides, these padres were the leaders of the local Christians and their guidance  was helpful in formulating the political policies of the Portuguese rulers. Not only that, but in  those days the Christians believed that Portuguese rule was Christian rule. The Christians  were the rulers and Hindus did not have this authority.121 In 1668, when a Hindu was  appointed to a Government post in the city of Goa, the Vice-Rei himself came out strongly  against this.122 Because he was not a Christian, the Hindu was relieved of the post. It was  considered irreligious, that is against the Christian religion, that a Hindu should hold a  Government office under the administration of the King of Portugal.123 The Portuguese rulers  faithfully stood by the principle that a non-Christian should have no superiority whatsoever  over a Christian.124


In 1667, there remained only 3,000 Hindus in Bardez.125 This figure must have been  reduced still further after the notification of Hindu expulsion issued by the Vice-Rei Conde de  San Vincente. In a Portuguese document of 1722 it was said that a Hindu was then scarcely  seen in Bardez.126 In this way the total Christianisation of Bardez had been almost  accomplished in the times of Shivaji. In the chronicle of Sabhasad, Goa has been  appropriately described as Firangana.127 It is no exaggeration to say that in those days Goa  had become a prototype of Portugal. The Goan Catholics had not only adopted the religion of  the rulers but also their language, customs and manners, mode of dress, names etc. Shivaji’s  troops were in Bardez for three days. On 22 November, they left. Shivaji himself must have  been there at that time. The Mahrattas captured many prisoners. Rich and highly placed people had already taken refuge in the Reis Magos or Aguada forts or the island of Goa.


CONTENTSThose who were taken were mostly Christians. The Dutch of Vengurla recorded that among  the captured were women and children.128 A reference to the capture of women and children  is also found in the treaty of friendship concluded after this invasion.129


After establishing that the invasion of Bardez had nothing to do with the expulsion  notification issued by Vice-Rei Conde de San Vincente, it is proper to examine the basis on  which the contrary view has gained ground.130 The basis of the belief is a letter from an  Englishman in Goa dated 30 November, 1667.131


It would appear that this letter is based on mere street gossip. Its contents are not  supported either by any document in the Goa Archives nor any contemporary document. The  Dutch officer in charge at Vengurla, Lenartz, wrote in a letter dated 28 November, 1667 that  the object of Shivaji’s invasion of Bardez was exactly as the Franciscan padres have  recorded.132 Even the English Factor of Surat, in a letter dated 22 January 1667, stated that  Shivaji invaded Bardez on account of the Desais living in Goa.133 It must be taken into account  that the view of the Dutch of Vengurla is very significant because they were in league with  Shivaji in this affair.134


The Vice-Rei had protested to the Dutch of Vengurla in this matter in a letter dated 1 December 1667. Conde de San Vincente wrote that Shivaji had expressed regret to him for  having accepted ammunition from the Dutch and yielding to their pressure and invading  Bardez,135 (e desculpar-se o dito Sivagi comigo de que para isso fora induizido por V. S.).  Although the Dutch contradicted the charge made in a letter of protest regarding the invasion of Bardez, the charge was, neverthless, not baseless.136 The French traveller, Carre, was in  Goa in 1668 and 1672 who said that Shivaji invaded Bardez because he was badly treated by  the Portuguese.137 It is noteworthy that Carre has not mentioned religious persecution of the  Hindus as the cause of Shivaji’s invasion of Bardez.


The present author does not consider it credible that Shivaji put four padres to death  in Bardez for having refused to be converted to Hinduism as stated in the Englishman’s letter dated 30 November 1667. For there is no record to prove that in those days any European  Christian was converted to Hinduism. There are several examples in the sixteenth and  seventeenth centuries of some converted Christians having been accepted back into  Hinduism by a process of penance and purification, but they were originally Hindus.138 The  case of Europeans is entirely different. So it seems that the account in this letter was the  product of the imagination of someone unacquainted with the traditions, customs and


manners of the Hindus.



It is clear from the contemporary writings of Diagode Couto,139 Fr. Paulo de  Trinidade,140 Padre Francisco de Souza141 and others that a European Christian was on the  same footing as a Hindu untouchable in the Hindu society of Shivaji’s times. It was impossible to convert a European Christian to Hinduism in the seventeenth century. In a Portuguese  epistle of 1690 it is stated that the lowest among the low caste Hindus would not be prepared  to eat what the Vice-Rei ate sitting with him.142 It is well-known that when a Hindu was to be  converted to Christianity, the first step in that direction was to compel him to eat beef.143


The Franciscan padres have placed on record that the Mahrattas inflicted 18 wounds  on one of the two padres killed at Colvale. Was not even one stroke of a sword enough to  send him to the other world? But since he received so many wounds the natural inference is  that there must have been a scuffle between the Mahratta soldiers and this padre and  somebody might have sarcastically suggested to the Padre that he should become a Hindu.  However, the most important point is that if the Padre had died for his religion, the Fanciscan


fathers would surely have noted him as a great martyr. Beyond all this, shivaji’s policy of  toleration of all religions is so well known.144


The women who were captured during the invasion of Bardez were restored to the Vice-Rei of Goa after the treaty of friendship was concluded. As a matter of fact, women and children from enemy territory always received protection in times of war from Shivaji’s  soldiers.145 Shivaji’s strict instruction to his army was, as stated by Sabhasad in his  chronicle,146 that ‘in foreign territory no woman or child should be molested’.147 The Portuguese biographer of Shivaji, Cosme da Guarda, also testifies to this.148 There is no  mention in the Portuguese records of the women captured during the Bardez invasion having been hurt or molested. On the contrary, the Portuguese Vice-Rei, Conde de San Vincente, informed the King of Portugal that Shivaji duly returned all the plunder and women and children that his trops had seized.149


The Mahrattas carried the Christian women with them as captives because of the  peculiar situation in Firangana. It may be that they were held as hostages for extorting money  from their relatives. The Dutch records mention quite a different reason for this action,150 but it  is not supported by Portuguese records. Thevenot, a French traveller, has recorded that


Shivaji’s behaviour was similar in respect of the daughter of Shaista Khan. Even if Thevenot’s  information was inaccurate, it shows that Shivaji was held in esteem for his noble  behaviour.151


The present author brought to light for the first time in 1927 the treaty concluded between Shivaji and the Portuguese in 1667.152 A fascimile was also published by him.153 In  this treaty, consideration is first given to the Desais—Lakham Savant and Narba Savant of



Kudal, Keshav Naik of Pernem and Mal Shenvi of Bicholim. Shivaji having complained against  Lakham Savant and Keshav Naik, the Vice-Rei expelled them from Goa in June 1668. Shivaji  showed them mercy.154 Lenartz, the Dutch Factor of Vengurla, wrote in his letter dated 28 November, 1667 that, after attacking Bardez, Shivaji went to Bicholim and negotiated a treaty  with the Portuguese.155 In the original Portuguese text of the treaty, it is clearly stated that  Shivaji personally took part in the invasion of Bardez.156 Even in the Marathi text it is said that  Shivaji went to Bardez with his troops because the Desais were there.157 The Portuguese  Vice-Rei says that Shivaji himself told the Vice-Rei that the Dutch Factor at Vengurla  instigated him to invade Bardez.158 Padre Gonsalo Martence went to Raigad with the text of  the treaty on behalf of the Portuguese when Shivaji gave them permission to open a factory at  Dabhol.159 In accordance with the treaty, the Vice-Rei informed Shivaji that a fettor had been


appointed at the Dabhol factory of the Portuguese in July, 1668.160


The Vice-Rei received news that a day or two before 20 March 1668 Shivaji was  mobilising his troops with a view to leading an invasion on Goa.161 Accordingly the Portuguese  made defensive preparations but this invasion did not come off. On 6 November, 1668,  Conde de San Vincente died. A few days after his death, Shivaji had planned to invade


Salçette and Bardez but, according to the acting Governor of Goa in his letter dated 7  January, 1669, as the Portuguese preparations were formidable, Shivaji did not pick a quarrel  with them.162 Gifford and Chamberlain said in a letter from Karwar dated 26 December, 1668  that Shivaji had surreptitiously sent 400 to 500 of his people, on one pretext or another, in  small batches into Goa territory. Gradually this number was to be doubled and one night they  would have taken possession of a pass to enter Goa island and capture it before giving any opportunity to the Portuguese troops to deploy. But Shivaji found on coming to Vengurla that  his plan had been divulged, his men had been arrested, and the Portuguese were ready to  meet him. He therefore changed his plans.163 In a letter dated 12 November, 1668, the English  gave the news that Conde de San Vincente got information about Shivaji’s plans a few days


before his death and therefore made inquiries with Shivaji’s envoy to Goa, and that, in fact the  Vice-Rei slapped the envoy in the face two or three times and turned him and his people who  had come to the city with him away.164 The Portuguese records nowhere say anything of this  kind. Far from it, and on the contrary, the acting Portuguese Governor says in his letter dated  7 January, 1669 that Shivaji had informed him that he had intended in November 1668 to invade Salçette and Bardez after the 1667 invasion, but it was no longer his objective. This he  did by sending an envoy to the Portuguese.165


Shivaji carried out repairs on the temple of Saptakotishwara at Narve in Bhatagram in November 1668. An inscription in stone to that effect still stands at the entrance of the temple.  This temple was originally in Diwadi island. Minguel Vaz, a Portuguese priest, demolished it in 1540 along with other temples.166 It was erected again beyond Diwadi before 1558.167 The



Sanskrit pothi called Shri Shivarajyabhisheka Kalpataru by Nischalapuri mentions the  rebuilding of the temple of Saptakotishwara by Shivaji.168 Some information about this is  available in the Nischayapatra given to an astrologer of Narve by Suryarao Desai of  Bhatagram. It is commonly said that when Shivaji went to Narve to pay his respects to  Saptakotishwara, he got the inspiration for putting the temple into proper condition. The city  of Goa can be seen from Narve. What thoughts might have surged up in his mind when he  saw this city of the Portuguese?


Shivaji’s coronation in 1674 was considered a great event all over Maharashtra.169 The  English envoy, Oxendon, the interpreter of the English, Narayan Shenvi, and the Dutch  merchant of Vengurla, Abrahamle Feher, have left descriptions of this event. But what is very  surprising is that there is no Portuguese record, not even a few lines, of this event. Very


probably documents regarding this must have disappeared or must have been destroyed. For this reason, no correspondence between Shivaji and the Portuguese between 1669 to  November 1677 is traceable in the Goa Archives Livros dos reis vizinhos, Nos. 2 and 3.


The year after the coronation, i.e. 1675, on 18 April, Shivaji laid siege to the fort of  Ponda. The fort commander was one Mohamed Khan. When this fort was besieged in 1666, the Portuguese had helped its inmates to hold out. To ensure that this would not be  repeated, Shivaji had taken a pledge from the Portuguese to remain neutral. Even the  Portuguese envoy at the fortress was maintained secretly and, for that purpose, some men  and grain supplies were clandestinely sent to Ponda. But the Mahrattas waylaid and arrested  them.170 About 2,000 horsemen and 7,000 infantry of Shivaji were engaged in this siege.171


While this siege was in progress, Shivaji’s men attacked the village of Chandar on 29  April, 1675 and plundered two or three houses and killed a servant of the Catholic Church  (meirinho da igreja). These people happened to be there in pursuit of some Desais. On the  same day, about two hundred of Shivaji’s horsemen led an assault on Cuncolim in Salçette  and plundered many of the people in flight. They got away with Church ornaments also.


These horsemen were led by a Bijapur Sardar, Ranamast Khan.172 When the Vice-Rei learnt  about this aggression by the Mahrattas he ordered that Shivaji’s envoy be placed under arrest.173


About 16 May, the fortress of Ponda fell to Shivaji.174 As a consequence of this, Antruj,  Ashtaghar, Hemadbarse, Bali, Chandravadi and Kakode, corresponding to present-day  Ponda, Sanguem, Quepem and Canacona, came under his administration. In the same  month, Shivaji captured Shiveshwar and Ankola forts and Karwar.175 Shivaji’s writ now ran in  all of the Bijapur Konkan. Cosme de Guarda writes, “In this way Shivaji captured all the  Bijapur territory below the ghat till the Mirjan river.” Ponda fort was repaired and, at its



entrance, the idol of Ganapati was planted.176 The last of Bijapur’s fortress-keepers was  Mahomed Khan. Shivaji appointed Trimbak Pandit in his place.177


The ancestors of the Rajput house of Dharampur used to impose and recover chauthai from the people of Daman territory. On this account, the Portuguese called the prince of Dharampur Chauthiya Raja. The Italian traveller Manucei has also called him by the same  name. The oldest reference to this in the Portuguese records is found in a manuscript, Cronic  Dos Cucecuse Doreino de Gujarata. This was written in 1535 and is deposited in the  Biblioteca Nacional de Lisboa.178 Detailed information about chauthai is found in a manuscript  Tombo ce Damao prepared in 1592 and now in the Goa Archives.179


It is mentioned in the travelogue of Padre Manoel Godinho written in 1663 that the  chauth tax (pensao) was being paid from the days prior to the occupation of Daman by the  Portuguese to Chauthiya Raja.180 Godinho also says that the prince maintains a cavalry of  600. Useful information about this tax is also found in Garcia de Orta’s Coloquios, published


in 1563 in Goa.181 Decada Ⅶ by Diago do Couto182 and Decada ⅩⅢ and Livro das Fortalezas da India, a historical work by Antonio Bocarro.183 Unpublished information on this topic has been given elsewhere by the present author.184


Chauthai means a fourth part of the revenue. After the Sultans of Gujarat had  conquered Daman, the people of Daman used to pay 25 per cent of the revenue from the  villages to the Rajput princes (known as Sarset) in order that they should not molest them.  After Daman passed to the Portuguese the Rajput princes continued to recover it from the  people as they had done before. This led to brawls and skirmishes between the Portuguese  and the forces of the Chauthiya Raja. Fernao de Miranda, Captain of Daman, to avoid all  trouble, made an agreement with the Sarset prince, that ‘chauthai’ should not exceed 17 per cent of the total revenue and that the tax should be made over in cash to representatives of  the Raja at Daman.185


In 1670, in keeping with the agreement made with the Sarset prince, the ratio of  chauthai in Mahim pargana was 12·50 per cent and in Tarapur pargana 14 per cent.186 The  condition was laid down that, in exchange for this cess, the prince of Sarset should protect the people of these two parganas from the depradations of thieves and robbers.187 The prince  of Sarset was the Raja of Ramnagar. As mentioned earlier, it was customary to call him  Cauthiya Raja.188


The Koli Raja of Jawhar rebelled against the Chauthiya Raja in 1670 and demanded of the Portuguese that the chauthai be paid to him. The Portuguese did not do so. He therefore plundered and burnt several villages from Dahanu to Kalve Mahim. The Chauthiya Raja could



nowhere obstruct his progress. The Portuguese therefore came down and agreed to pay  chauthai to the Raja of Jawhar. Later, the Portuguese picked a quarrel with the Koli Raja with  the help of the Raja of Ramnagar and burnt down a number of his villages. However, the  Portuguese were unable to subdue the Koli Raja and they, therefore, through Manoel Furtado  de Mendonça who was appointed Captain of Daman in December 1671, secretly requested  Shivaji to punish him. Accordingly Moropant Pingle, the Peshwa of Shivaji, allacked Jawhar and put the Koli Raja to rout.189 Still, the Raja of Ramnagar did not surrender to Shivaji and


continued his resistance. After having taken most of the territory of Ramnagar, Shivaji  demanded, the chauthai of Daman from the Portuguese but on the excuse that the whole of  the Ramnagar raj had not been conquered, the Portuguese kept with them as deposit the  chauthai from 1671 to 1677 and did not pay it either to Ramnagar or to Shivaji.190 Even so, the  Portuguese have recorded, Shivaji did not molest Daman in any way.


In January 1677, Shivaji completed the conquest of Ramnagar and threatened the  borders of Daman by posting troops to prevent any depradations by thieves or robbers. He  then demanded chauthai from the Portuguese. The Daman Municipality resolved that the  demand was just and fair and the Vice-Rei of Goa was informed accordingly.191 On 10


January, 1678, the Vice-Rei informed Shivaji by a letter that the chauthai would be paid after  the Captains of Daman and Bassein had informed him about the capture of the Chauthaiya Raja’s whole territory.192


In a letter written to the General of Bassein, the Vice-Rei ordered that the chauthai should be recovered and an agreement should be made with Shivaji on the lines of the one  with the Chauthiya Raja. But the Vice-Rei instructed the sum to be paid to Shivaji should be  calculated only from the date on which his conquest of Ramnagar was completed; the arrears  were not to be paid.193 For a long time, the correspondence regarding chauthai was  continued between Shivaji and the Vice-roy. Shivaji’s envoys, Pitambar Shenvi, Jiwaji Shenvi  and Ganesh Sheth, went to Goa and held talks with the Portuguese Viceroy.194 The French


traveller Carre has in his book given an account of the mission Shivaji sent to the Portuguese  in 1672.195


At the beginning of May 1677, Shivaji had sent his representative, Abaji Pant, to meet  Don Manuel Lobo de Silveira and negotiate the question of chauthai.196 The Portuguese agreed to pay the chauthai for Daman according to past usage but on, one pretext or another, they did no pay the dues to the last.197 On the contrary, they paid, in several  instalments, more than Rs. 13,000 secretly to the Prince of Ramnagar so that the Chauthiya Raja might continue his resistance to Shivaji.198 A manuscript in the Biblioteca da Ajuda puts down the revenue of chauthai from Daman per year as 12,975 asurpees. Substracting 3,898 asurpees as the wages of the vatandars, the chauthiya Raja retained 9,077 asurpees,



according to a record dated 4 June, 1683.199 From this, how much the Portuguese owed  Shivaji on account of chauthai from Daman can be estimated.200 The same manuscript has  recorded that, by the end of 1681, the deposits with the Portuguese on account of chauthai were of the order of 11,728 asurpees. So, till the end of the year, the Mahrattas did not get  their chauthai dues.


Mention is made of a tax called gavkhandi having been paid to Shivaji by the  Portuguese from Tarapur and Sayban parganas of Bassein province in 1677.201 The  Portuguese paid this tax also to the Chauthiya Raja. Two letters from the Mahrattas to Portuguese officers written on 16 August 1677 mention this demand. One of them is from  Bayjipant.202 Chauthai and gavkhandi were different imposts.


In August 1678, the General of Bassein learnt that Shivaji had collected a large army  near Kalyan and Bhivandi with a view to attacking Salçette.203 In 1679, the relations between the Portuguese and Shivaji deteriorated considerably.204 The Governor of Goa kept 5,000  infrantry ready near Cuncolim Surmising that Shivaji would invade Salçette in Goa. Antonio de  Pais de Sande was then the Governor. He was aware of Shivaji’s prowess and valour. He  used to say that Shivaji was the Attila of India.205


The Portuguese planned to lead an attack on Ponda before the Mahrattas invaded  Goa. The Mahrattas, under the leadership of Mahadaji Anant, were ready for a fight. Just  then came the news of Shivaji’s passing away and the Mahratta troops that had gathered on  the Goa border hastily withdrew and this conflict was averted.206 The Portuguese Governor


Sande has said that Shivaji died on 13 April 1680.207 This date is in accordance with the new  system and is ten days earlier than the English date. In a contemporary work in Portuguese in  the Biblioteca Nacional de Lisboa, it is recorded that Shivaji died of an ulcer (anthrax).208


There is no mention of the age at which Shivaji died in Portuguese sources. The only  mention of his age is the one made by Cosme de Guarda.209 He says that in 1660 Shivaji was  29 years old (Sendo pois este ano de 1660 … se achava com 29 de idade). Jedhe Shakavali,  Shivabharat and some other sources indicate that Shivaji was born in 1630. Guarda’s


statement approximates to this indication. The figure 29 is not current in popular talk and so Guarda must have taken the trouble to find it out and record it.


Shivaji vigilantly watched the Portuguese in his declining years.210 The English, in a  letter written from Rajapur to Bombay on 31 May 1675, mentioned that Shivaji had become the  ruler of Karwar and that people expected him now to turn his attention to Goa. But there was  no wisdom in fighting the Moghuls and the Portuguese simultaneously and for this reason  Shivaji avoided a conflict with the Portuguese.211 The Vengurla Dutch have recorded that



Shivaji hated the Portuguese.212 He always claimed Salçette and Bardez as his.213 The  Portuguese also were afraid of him and considered him an enemy.214 The fact of the matter is  that he did not have the time to expel the Portuguese from Konkan or, may be, he did not  realise the urgency of it.


The Portuguese experienced a feeling of relief at Shivaji’s death. The then Governor of  Goa bas recorded : “This state is now free from anxiety. He was far more dangerous in peace  than in war.”215 The Jesuit father Lainez says in his Latin book Defensio Indicaram Missionum,  published in Rome in 1707, that, “The whole of India was in terror of Shivaji”.216


The same feeling has found expression in the Shiva Bavani of poet Bhushan in his  Hindi composition :


Oh Shivaji, the good son of Shahaji,


In terror of you the foreign residents (yavanas)


Of Bhelsa, Ujjain and Malva had to run away


As far as Shiraz, the Capital of Iran.


The residents of Gondvan, Telangan, Rohilkhand,


Karnatak and Firangana quake with fear.


Great Captains have lost courage and the doors of Bijapur Golconda, Agra and Delhi  forts open only once a fortnight and not daily.217

Baltazar Mascarenhas, a Brahman Christian of Sirula  (Shiroda) from Bardez was the first to inform the Goa Government about this conspiracy. About Mateos de Castro, see Don  Theodore Ghesquiere’s Mathieu de Castro (Louvain, 1937) and P. Carlo Cavallera, Matteo de Castro Mahalo, Primo Vicario  Apostolico dell’ India, Roma, 1936. There is information about this Bishop’s intrigues with the Dutch against the Portuguese in  Corpus Diplomaticum Neerlando Indicam, Vol. I (1596-1650). The letter of Bishop Mateos addressed to Brahman Christians of  Goa in regard to this revolt is in the records of the Jesuits in Rome (Goa 40, fls. 373r-383v). The author has a photostat copy of  this letter.

93) What Sarkar has written while commenting on the sentence ‘com e favour do Vice Rey’s is baseless. Those words refer to  the frantic efforts made by the Viceroy to turn Bardez Hindus into Christians. Sir Janunath has written : The words, ‘favour of the  Viceroy’ do not mean force but only the prohibition of the sale of Hindus as slaves to other than the Christian fathers who  converted them” (Shivaji, 1952, p. 355).

Accordingly, many  people bid adieu to Salcette and the land they owned for all time.
In the Bibliotheque Nacionale de Paris, there is a certificate given to Conde de Linhares for this good deed by the  Jesuit fathers. It is included in the manuscript by Barreto de Resende called Epilogo dos Vice-Reis. (BNP, Fond Portugais 1, fl.  68).

In Shivaji’s times, most Hindus in the territory under the Portuguese had been converted to Christianity, though some  Hindus still remained. For them, the old laws were in vogue. One of the most irksome of these laws was about orphans below  fourteen. Even if the mother was alive such children were forcibly converted. So what Sir Janunath says must be dismissed as a  half-truth (Shivaji, p. 354).

The date of the original letter is 20 September 1667. After this date at the end of the letter is the detailed report  reproduced below. Obviously the information contained therein was written after the conclusion of the treaty of 5 December  1667. Vice-Rei Conde de San Vincente says :
Depois de ter dado a V. Magde, conta do Estado da Asia, chegou Correo de Glanda, para os ministros da  Companhia, e como eu tenho entre elles pessoa de confiança, sobre o seguinte : Mandao ao seu geral que se venha a Cochim  com a armada e (porque elles tem muitos navios) sera o numero delles a medida da sua necessidade, que sem romper com os  Portugueses de todo, que facao as ostillidades possiveis em os navios que passarem ao sul… que va pessoa a Idalxa sobre  romper com os Portugueses, e que se arive a guerra do Canara, e de todas as outras partes com segredo, porem que  descobertamente se nao façao ostillidades aos nosses barcos…

What great part the Franciscan padres played on the occasion of Sambhaji’s invasion of Goa in 1684 is found in a letter  they sent to the king of Portugal (MR, 52, fl. 120) :

(Os religiosos da sua Ordem) assistiram com particular zelo e trabalho enquanto a guerra durou, obrando com  grande valor, guarnecendo as muralhas, fazendo vigias, rondas e sentinelas, nas partes do maior risco, acodindo pontualmente  aos ferods … animando a todos para defençe como sucedeo ao Pe. Frey Luis de S. Francisco e ao Pe. Manoel de S.

Surendranath Sen has translated this thus : “he made inroads into the territories of the Portuguese who had given him  offence; he wrested from them the island of Bardez and, after desolating the country, caused them great anxiety for Goa”  (Foreign Biographies of Shivaji, p. 206) .

He commanded his men, under rigorous pains,  not to do her the least hurt, but, on the contrary, to serve her with all respect; and being informed that her father was alive, he  sent him word, that if he would send the sum which he demanded for her ransom, he would send him back his daugher safe and  sound; which was punctually performed.”

The present author published the text of the treaty from the original in 1926. The celebrated Portuguese author, Cunha  Rivara, had published it in Boletim do Governo da India previously but in his version there are some grievous errors. Biker copied  Rivara once again (Tratados Ⅳ, p. 171). Dr. Braganca Pereira copied Rivara once again (APO, Ⅰ, 3, 1, p. lix) and so they repeated the mistakes of Rivara.
Cunha Rivara wrote “desculpando-se da entrada que elle (Shivaji) e suas gentes fizeram em Bardez” in place of  “desculpando-se da entrada que ignorando elle suas gentes fizeram em Bardez.” This led to complete misrepresentation and  Braganca Pereira reached the conclusion that Shivaji had not personally gone to Bardez and that his troops attacked Bardez  without clearance from him. Not only that, but Braganca even relied on a letter of the Karwar English factor dated 16 December  1668 (new style) and stated that the invasion of Bardez did not take place at all (APO. Ⅰ. Vol. Ⅲ, p. Ⅰ, p. 1vi). It is actually quite  unnecessary to point out that this letter refers to Shivaji in quite another connection.

174) The English factor at Rajapur mentions in his letter dated 15 May 1675 that the Ponda fort was completely besieged by  Shivaji and the English factor at Karwar says in his letter of 18 May, 1675 that Shivaji had captured the fort. From these letters, it  would appear that the Mahrattas captured the fort about 16 May, 1675. Adilshah’s chronicle, Basatin e Salatin says that Ponda  fort was captured by Shivaji on 15 Safar, 1086 (Pissurlencar, Antigualhas, p. 134) Dr. Balkrishna, Shivaji, Vol. Ⅱ. Part Ⅰ, pp. 139-

177) Goa Archives; RV No. 2, fl. 3v.; Pissurlencar, PM, Ⅱ, p. 4n. Riyasatkar Sardesai has written that Shivaji appointed one  Dharmaji Nagnath as Killedar (Shakakarta Shivaji, p. 169). The Goa Archives clearly show that he was appointed after Trimbak  Pandit.
Portuguese material throws a bright light on the history of this fort. In 1535, it was a small fortress under the charge of a Thanedar. His troops consisted of about five hundred solders and some twenty to thirty horses. (Gaspar Correia, lendas da  India, Vol. Ⅳ, p. 601). In 1547, Governor Don Joao de Castro attacked it and burnt it. (Leonardo Nunes, (Cronica de D. Joao  de Castro, pp. 167-8; Luis Keil, As Tapecarias de D. Joao de Castro, 1928). But Adilkhan built it again. The Governor of Goa,  Francisco Barreto, attacked Ponda fort in December 1556 and demolished it. But Adilkhan once again reconstructed it (Padre  Sebastiao Goncalves, Da Historia da Companhia de Jesus, Ms. BNL. fl. 79v).

The letter of 13 March 1679 was published and is quoted here :—
Porquanto sou informado que o dinheiro do chouto que os vazadares e curumbins das aldeas do distrito de Damao  pagavao a El-Rey Choutia, conforme aos consertos antigos, por defender as ditas aldeas dos ladroes, se tem cobrado por  conta de fazenda real de seis anos a esta parte. Pondesse em depozito em hum cofre no Collegio dos Padres da Companhia,  para depois se dar a quem pertencer. em razao das guerras em que o Sivagi anda com o dito Rey. para senhorear suas terras,  do qual dinheiro se tirarao por ordem do governo passado mais de treze mil rupias, porvezes, que se derao ao dito Choutia……
198) Ibid. Mention of secret payments by the Portuguese to Chouthia Raja is found for the first time, in the acting Governor’s  letter dated 12 May, 1678. (Goa Archives : RV No. 3, fls. 6-6v).

200) Five rupees were equal to 12 assurpees or one assurpee (Xerafim) was equal to six annas and eight pies. But, generally,  the Portuguese Court regarded a rupee equal a to two assurpees (Pissurlencar, PM Ⅳ, p. 168; Ⅴ. p. 24).

The tax was a fixed cess per khandi of grain to be recovered from peasants in all  villages (A. V. John and Aba Chandorkar, Shrishivashahicha Lekhanalankar, p. 31).

In August 1677, Bajajipant sought asylum with the Portuguese for himself and also for his wife and  nephew because Shivaji had charged him with having conspired with the Raja of Kolvan to hand over the raj to him for a  gratification (BACL: Livro do registo do 1° Conde de Assumar, MS. fls. 280, 287).
