Having gained the Konkan territory from the Moghul Emperor as a jagir for Chhatrapati  Shahu, the Mahrattas considered it a rightful and legitimate act to recover tribute from the  Portuguese also. Actually the Moghul Emperor never had any authority over this territory. But  the powerful have always dictated to the weak. Vice-rei Marquez de Alorna said that since  Chhatrapati Shahu of Satara and Chhatrapati Sambhaji of Kolhapur had the Mahratta  Kingdom divided between them and the Konkan passed to Sambhaji, the Mahrattas expected  a tribute from Goa also. But this position was never accepted by the Portuguese, says the  Viceroy, and so they did not pay the tribute.1


When Shahu returned from the Moghul Court, he informed the Portuguese that he had  gained the territory of Konkan as a jagir from the Emperor of Delhi.2 His first Peshwa, Balaji Vishwanath, brought to Satara the sanads of the sardeshmukhi rights from the Moghul Court  in 1719.3In those days Conde de Ericeira was in charge of Portuguese India at Goa. He said  that had Chhatrapati Shahu been more circumspect4he would have taken possession of the  whole of the Konkan as he conquered Kalyan and Bhimdi.5 But instead of paying attention to  increasing his military power he made rapid progress in consumption of alcohol and so was  not likely to make use of his great power. Had he the will to do so, the Conde said, he could  have raised as big an army as he wanted.


In a contemporary Portuguese report the following description of Kalyan when Shahu  took it appears :6 “This town is really a fortress. There are twelve good towers and a deep moat.” Ramchandra Mahadeo Chaskar took possession of Kalyan in 1719. The Portuguese  called it Galian. Portuguese records show that Kalyan was the base of operations for the  repeated Mahratta raids on the Bassein territory of the Portuguese.7 At least during the earlier raids, the planning and direction was in the hands of this Ramchandrapant8 This is supported  also by the Chronicle of Salçette.


A Portuguese report on the conflict between the Mahrattas and the Portuguese in 1737  states :9


After Kalyan was captured by the Mahrattas they stationed a big force there and their general demanded of the General of Bassein the sardeshmukhi dues. But the General replied  that the right that the Mahrattas had secured applied only to the Moghul territory and had  nothing to do with Portuguese possessions.



Bajirao Ⅰ and the Portuguese came in contact for the first time at the end of 1721 when  the English and the Portuguese had encircled Kolaba fort.


The Viceroy informed the King of Portugal by a letler dated 8 January 171810 that  Kanhoji Angria was a very powerful and insolent enemy of the Portuguese who was the main  cause of their Cheul trade becoming almost extinct. In those days it became impossible for  Portuguese trading ships to ply in the northen sea without a permit from Angria and without paying his levy. He used to collect seven lakh rupees a year from the villages on the Bassein territory coast.11 In an account in Portuguese published in Lisbon in 1715, a writer compared Kanhoji to the notorious Barbaroxa.12


The Portuguese attempted to capture Angria dead or alive in November 1720 by  secretly sending a large squadron of warships and an army against him. But the plan miscarried and only 13 of the 65 ships heading towards Kolaba reached there in time.13 The Portuguese suffered greatly at the hands of Kanhoji. The English also looked upon him as their inveterate enemy. So the English and the Portuguese joined forces and marched on Kolaba. The Angria tried hard to prevent this combination. On 7 August 1721, he sent a letter  to the Portuguese general at Bassein with a faithful servant, Syed Abdul Razak. In this letter he wrote that he had a force of 20,000 soldiers with him and that many more from the armies of his relatives would join him.14 Even Chhatrapati Shahu, like the English and the Portuguese, wanted to curb Kanhoji’s growing power. Chhatrapati Sambhaji of Kolhapur had even tried,  with Portuguese aid, to capture Kanhoji’s forts in 1716.


In a manuscript entitled, “An account of the period from the end of the region of Viceroy Vasco Fernandes Cezar till the end of 1738 in India” in the Biblioteca Naçional da  Lisboa, it is recorded that, when the Portuguese and the English marched on Kolaba fort,  Ramchandrapant, the Governor of Kalyan, and Damaji Krishna, the Governor of Bhimdi, went  to Koyna and met the Captain of Sabaho and suggested to him, on behalf of Chhatrapati  Shahu, that the Portuguese and Shahu’s forces should join hands to exterminate Kanhoji and  share his territory. But the Portuguese did not want a powerful neighbour like Chhatrapati  Shahu and did not entertain the proposal.15


Later, Kanhoji became a tributary of Shahu and brought Bajirao Peshwa to his aid. On  30 December 1720, Bajirao stationed 7,000 cavalry at Alibag for the protection of the town.16 On 1 January 1722 Bajirao informed the Portuguese that he was the Prime Minister of  Chhatrapati Shahu and that in that capacity he was in Alibag to get Kanhoji Angria to  acknowledge the paramountcy of the Chhatrapati to which Kanhoji had agreed. He would,  therefore, thereafter help Kanhoji. He also said that, for the protection of Kanhoji, he was  ready to make war or peace with the Portuguese, whatever was necessary. If peace was acceptable to them, their friendship would be accepted. Knowing that he would be helpless  before the Mahratta forces, the Viceroy agreed to enter into a treaty.


On 3 January talks commenced. The next day Bajirao sent his representative,  Mahadaji Krishna, on a Portuguese ship and on 9 January a treaty of friendship between Bajirao Pandit and the Portuguese was concluded at Varsoli.


Vice-Rei Conde de Ericeira wrote in 1720 : “Kanhoji became powerful because of  negligence on the part of the Portuguese. In the days of Caitano Melo de Castro (October  1702 to October 1707) the Angria had only eight or ten armed ships and he used to live at  Versova which was in Portuguese territory.”17 In 1721, Kanhoji’s fleet consisted of 6 palas with  16 to 18 cannons fitted on them, 30 galvetas and 6,000 sailors.18 The Viceroy further says.


Kanhoji has now become so inflated that he openly brags about easily capturing the  Portuguese-owned Cheul and Karanja. But he has eyes on Goa. Thirty years ago he was a  poor and humble nonentity. But within ten years, by his many manoeuvres, he has become  the owner of Suvarnadurg and 22 forts are under his control. An ex-Governor of the  Portuguese who was sailing from Cheul to Bassein in a pala was attacked by Kanhoji on the  seas, captured and ignominiously killed. Twenty-six Portuguese made captive by him were taken to Kolaba and beheaded.19 The name of the said Portuguese Governor was Gaspar Aranho de Lencastri.


In 1722, a treaty of friendship between the Portuguese and the Mahrattas was  concluded but it did not last long. On 26, November 1723, at 9 a.m. Pilaji Jadhaorao, at the  head of 40,000 horsemen, attacked Bassein territory on the pretext that it was part of the  Mahratta State20 and marched as far as Gokhirve, near Bassein. By way of retaliation, the  Portuguese plundered a number of villages in Mahratta territory. On 6, December 1723,  Bajirao sent a letter to the General at Bassein, Luiz de Melo Castro, saying :


If it is your desire that there should be friendly relations between us, release the  peasants of Taloja that you have detained and there should be no failure to do so. If you are  out to fight, say so frankly so that I can inform my forces accordingly. if you want peace,  make it up with Pilaji Jadhao and send a trustworthy person from your side as envoy.21


After receipt of this letter, the Portuguese made peace with Bajirao on 10 January 1724  by the treaty of Varsoli. It was concluded in a village called Kambe. The Mahrattas were  represented by Ramchandra pant, Pilaji Jadhav and Dayalji Somavanshi and the Portuguese  by Captain Jose Pereira de Vascocelos.22 On Mahratta insistence, a clause was included in the treaty to the effect that till May of that year (1724), the Portuguese would send a competent representative to Satara to confirm the treaty and that, till then, the Mahrattas  would not cause any disturbance in Portuguese territory.


The Portuguese understood the inward intent of this clause. The statesmen in Goa  conjectured that it was an attempt on the part of Bajirao to collect Sardeshmukhi or some  fixed tribute for Bassein from the Portuguese and they therefore decided not to send any envoy to Shahu at Satara.23 That Bajirao was pressing for such an envoy, reinforcing his  pressure with presents to the General at Bassein is apparent from the Peshwa’s letter dated 14 November 1724.24


Siddi Yakut Khan swooped on Kolaba with twelve palas, two frigates and a hundred  other armed ships in 1724. But Kanhoji bought him off with plenty of money and made peace  with him. The same year, however, Kanhoji entered into a pact with Shahu to capture the fort  of Rairi from the Siddi and Chhatrapati Shahu sent 500 select cavalry to Angria’s help for this purpose. The Siddi got scent of this and made perfect preparations to defend the fort and the Mahrattas were compelled to abondon the project for some time.25 Ten years later Rairi i.e.  Raigad was returned to the Mahrattas by the Siddi.


Among the Portuguese statesmens, Andre Ribeiro Coutinho, the officer at Bassein,  counselled the Viceroy at Goa on 5 December 1728, that the Portuguese would not be able to withstand the powerful Mahrattas with their small army. It was advisable, therefore, he said.  that the General of Bassein should make a small gift of Rs. 2,500 every year to the  Chhatrapati, his Minister or some favourite of the Mahratta king and avoid the damage that the Portuguese had to suffer every year from Mahratta depradations in Daman territory.26 The  Portuguese used to pay gavkhandi to the Chauthiya Raja to avoid his plundering in Portuguese territory. He used to collect about 2,000 asurpis from Daman as gavkhandi and the Mahrattas knew it.


Though a treaty was concluded between the Portuguese and the Mahrattas on 10  January 1724, the Portuguese feared that the Mahrattas were intent on invading Bassein  territory to recover tribute. This fear was not unfounded. Only six miles from Kalyan, near the  fort of Saivan, Ramchandra pant had already encamped but matters did not proceed further.


In May 1728, Pilaji Jadhavrao plundered two Portuguese villages in the vicinity of Daman.27 In retaliation, the General of Bassein attacked Kalyan in August and resorted to arson.28 The  Viceroy wrote that, as a result of this assault on Kalyan, Bajirao came down and made a  treaty at Bassein, but this treaty is untracable. In 1728, Ramchandra Chaskar died and his  brother Krishnaji Mahadeo was appointed Subedar of Kalyan.

In 1729, Kanhoji Angria died.29 That he probably died of wounds is suggested by the  fact that, in the Viceroy’s letter dated 14 July 1729 to the General of Bassein, the following  reference is found :30


Se o Angria morreo faru toda a dilligencia possivel para mover os animos dos  Capitaves das praças para que se sublevem e ajudara, e prometera ajudar aos que tal  fizerem; se inao morreo e sarou me avisará com toda a brevidade. [If Angria is dead, his fort captains should rebel and for this purpose you should exert and give the prospective rebels all  help or assurance thereof. But if he is not dead and if his wound had healed, you should inform me immediately accordingly.]


No reply to this letter is to be found in the Goa Archives. The date of Kanhoji’s death is  also not mentioned in any of the letters there. In a manuscript in the Biblioteca Naçional da  Lisboa the date 30 June 1729 (new style) is given as the date of his death31 and Dr.  Surendranath Sen has accepted this,32 but it does not corroborate the date given in the  Viceroy’s letter dated 14 July 1729 mentioned earlier. Even the Marathi sources mention that


Kanhoji died on 14 July 1729.33 A letter of the Goa Governor dated 30 August 1729 mentions  that those Portuguese who were the Angraia’s captives were released on the day of his  death.34


In May 1730, the Mahrattas invaded Bassein territory.35 Had the Bombay English not  sent 700 soldiers to the aid of the Portuguese, Salçette island would have fallen to the Mahrattas.36 On this occasion the Portuguese Viceroy had requested help in men and  ammunition from the French Governor at Pondichery also.37 In this war, the Portuguese strategy was to resort to arson in Mahratta territory, capture women and children and baptise  them. The Viceroy thought this would deter the enemy and he would come to terms. On 20 March 1731, the Viceroy informed the King of Portugal that he had captured many women and children and had threatened to turn them into Christians because the Mahrattas considered this as most deplorable. But in his letter dated 4 April 1731, he had written to the chief executive of Bassein that the captured women should not be let out and only the canard should be spread that they had been made over to Pae de Christaos, a Catholic religious authority, for being converted. The children were also to be given in charge of that authority  but they were not to be baptised until further orders were passed.


The Mahrattas started negotiations for a treaty in July. Bajirao sent his envoy to Goa  with a letter requesting the Viceroy to enter into a treaty of friendship. Before that, Pilaji  Jadhaorao had taken the Portuguese post of Kambe on 24 May 1731.38 In a letter written to the King of Portugal the Viceroy said :

The enemy has several times asked us for a treaty. The reason for this is not that he is afraid of us. He has other difficulties of his own which do not permit him to descend into the Konkan from the Deccan plateau. The Mahrattas are so powerful that they not only fight the  Moghul but have made him restless. So unless God’s grace is on us, the Mahrattas will  seriously threaten Bassein. In their negotiations for a treaty they never give up two conditions  : one is that we should pay them the same tribute that we have been paying the Chauthiya  Raja and Koli Raja, and the other is that we must allow the Hindus in Portuguese territory to  build temples.


Bajirao was finally prevailed upon to give up these two conditions and on 10 February  1732, through Robert Coevan, Governor of Bombay, a treaty between the Mahrattas and the Portuguese was signed. While the negotiations for the treaty were in progress, Bajirao himself had encamped at Kalyan.39 What is notworthy is that Robert Coevan has placed on record  that, through a trustworthy person. he inspired the Subedar of Kalyan to seek this treaty and  that otherwise, the Mahrattas did not care for it. After it was signed, Krishnaji Mahadeo was  relieved of the office of Subedar. A Portuguese letter says that Krishnaji Mahadeo was tired of Bajirao and sought employment with the Moghul.40 Krishnaji was considered a friend of the  Portuguese in Bassein. According to the Viceroy, Conde de Sandomela, the invasion of  Bassein in 1730 was largely the result of the efforts of Ganesh Naik.41


A member of this Naik family (Anzurkar) was arrested by the authorities of the  Inquisition in Bassein and despatched to Goa. While there, he embraced Catholism and was  given a new name, Inacio de Santo Terej. He knew the Portuguese language. Viceroy Conde  de Sandomela has said that he was a very cunning man and, having lived at his (the  viceroy’s) house for a long time, he was even capable of forging a letter. Ganesh Naik  incurred great favour with the Viceroy and one day fled, returning to north Konkan and getting  reconverted to Hinduism. The Viceroy said that he became a great enemy of the Portuguese in later years.42 Some information about Ganesh Naik is available in a letter in the Peshwa  Daftar written to the Peshwa43 by Krishnaji Ram from Bombay. There is a letter in the Goa  Archives written by Antaji Raghunath Kavle to the Viceroy in 1731 in which he has said that,  wherever he might be, he would always be at the service of the Viceroy.44 There is another letter written to the Viceroy by Pilaji Jadhav on 28 September 1731, in which he describes  Antaji Raghunath as dishonest.


Although a treaty was concluded between the Portuguese and the Maharattas in 1732,  Bajirao did not expect it to last long. He had therefore fixed 13 March 1733 as the date for an  assault on Salçette. At the beginning of the rainy season in 1733, Bajirao opened a campaign  against the Siddi but was not able to crush him as he had the help of the Bombay English.


The differences between the Siddi and the Mahrattas ended through mediation by the Portuguese. At the end of the first campaign against the Siddi, Bajirao had informed the  Dewan of Rajkot at Chaul on 8 June 1733, that he would attack Janjira of the Siddi. In 1734,  the Mahrattas forces again marched against the Siddi. With reference to this second campaign, the Portuguese Viceroy said in his letter to the Captain of Cheul on 5 November 1734 :45


I have received news that the Mahrattas have marched against the Siddi. Bajirao has  written to say that Shahu has once again ordered him to attack the Siddi. But he is prepared  to make up with him if he agrees to cooperate with him to fight the Angria. Even the English  and the Portuguese must co-operate with him as against the Angria...... I think it is because  it is not possible for the Mahrattas to capture the Siddi’s Janjira that they desire to take  Angria’s forts. Although we benefit by the extermination of the Angria, it will be more harmful  to us that the Mahrattas should take all ports on the coast. So, from our point of view it is  desirable that the conflict between the Angria and the Mahrattas should be long extended.  We must be cautious and not let the Mahrattas take the forts of the Angria. So, to all  appearances, you should help Bajirao but take care to see that he does not destroy the  Angria. I even suspect, that Bajirao has laid a trap to mislead the English and ourselves to  ensure that we don’t help the Siddi and thus ease his task, of conquering the Siddi. In view of  this, I warn you that, if the Siddi is cornered, you should give him the help he requires.  Similarly, let the Angria know what Bajirao has written to us about him, taking care to ensure  that Bajirao does not get scent of this.


The Academy of Sciences, Lisbon, has in its collection a letter written by the Vice-Rei Conde de Sandomele on 19 January 1734 to the King of Portugal in which he says :


At the beginning of the rains, the Mahrattas bought over a high officer of the Siddi’s  fleet and, with his help, captured a number of forts. They thus secured even the Siddi’s warships. But they have handed them over to the Angria. So now the Angria has more than twelve palas and about forty galvetas. Angria is one of our neighbours who is a danger to our trade.46


At the end of November 1734, there arose a dispute between the Angria brothers,  Sambhaji and Manaji. It seems from the letter the Viceroy wrote to Captain Caitano de Sousa  Pereira on 13 December 1734 that his Captain of Cheul had a hand in instigating this fraternal  quarrel.47 In fear of Sambhaji, Manaji took shelter with the Portuguese at Cheul. In this  dispute, Bajirao who wanted a good port on the coast, sided with Manaji. Referring to this,  Conde de Sandomele wrote that, in helping Manaji, Bajirao’s object was to exploit this  opportunity for securing some good port of the Angrias and capturing the Kolaba fort itself.48

With the help of Bajirao, Manaji captured the Rajkot at Cheul on 12 June 1732.49 This  port had been taken by Sambhaji Angria about a year earlier from Tajuddin Ali Khan, Dewan  of Cheul. The Captain of Cheul, Caitano de Sousa Pereira, had plotted for this port to pass  from Manaji to this Dewan. With this in view, the Portuguese took in their possession an old  mosque which was situated between Cheul and Rajkot while Manaji was at Cheul. Manaji did not like this. He left his Cheul camp and went to Rajkot on 2 January 1735 and attacked the  mosque in Portuguese possession. Khandoji Mankar, Shankaraji Keshao and other Sardars  of the Peshwa helped Manaji. On behalf of Manaji, Bajirao wrote a letter of complaint to the  Secretary of the Viceroy on 20 January 1735, which has been preserved in the Goa Archives.  This Marathi letter states that the Viceroy had given Manaji a letter to the General of Bassein  instructing him to cede some ground to the Mahrattas which letter was delivered to him. But far from doing so, the Captain of Cheul had launched an operation for the capture of the  Rajkot at Cheul. In view of the friendship between the Portuguese and the Mahrattas, Bajirao  urged this should be ended at once by the Viceroy’s order. However, he stated, if the Viceroy  wanted this strife, the Captain of Cheul was serving well and in that case Bajirao also would  act according to necessity. Bajirao concluded by saying that his envoy, Yesaji Rangaji, would  negotiate further in this behalf. This50 envoy himself carried this letter of 20 January 1735.


The Portuguese desired that since Rajkot of Cheul was originally Tajuddin Ali Khan’s it should be restored to him. But Bajirao not only objected to this, but also he was not ready to allow its demolition. The Portuguese did not want war with the Peshwa, because they feared  his power. In this connection the opinion of the Viceroy Joao de Saldanha de Gama’s opinion  is noteworthy. In his letter dated 4 November 1730, he says, “Shahu’s army today is so big  that if the Moghuls did not back us it will be difficult to resist it on land.” That Bajirao would  invade Bassein was suggested to the Captain of Cheul, Caitan de Sousa Pereira, at the end of April 1735 by Lakshmibai Angria, widow of Kanhoji.50


A few days before the skrimish between the Mahrattas and the Portuguese near the  Cheul mosque in January 1735, Bajirao wrote to the General of Bassein, in keeping with the  terms of the treaty of 1732, that some space should be given in Bassein to the traders of  Kalyan and Bhimdi to construct a store-house godown. Far from doing so, he used the  derogatory term Negro in respect of Bajirao.51 In those days, the Portuguese generally  referred to the Hindus as “gentios” (uneducated) or negros (blackmen)52 From a letter  written by Vassudev Joshi, Subedar of Kalyan on 8th of Ramzan, it is clear how enraged the  Mahrattas were against the Portuguese at that time.53 This must have happened a few days  before January 22, 1736.54


Siddi Yakutkhan of Janjira wrote to the Viceroy on September 18, 1735 that  Chhatrapati Shahu, in consonance with his long cherished desire to conquern the northern territory of the Portuguese, was about to send a big army and many Shenvis, Prabhus and  such other Hindus from that area who were in league with him. Valentin de Gouveia, Chief of  Stores at Bassein, also wrote in his letter dated 2, November 1734 that it was learnt from very  reliable soures that Chhatrapati Shahu was proceeding to Raigad with a big army to have  himself coronated. There was rivalry between the widow of Dabhade and Bajirao as to who  should exterminate the Siddi. Valentin Gouveia further added that all of them expected to be  finished after the Siddi was done away with.55


Taking stock of this situation, the Portuguese agreed to keep Rajkot with Manaji and  have the mosque demolished.56 In a letter dated November 14, 1735, the Viceroy has said that  Shahu had ordered Manaji to return Rajkot to Tajuddin Alikhan.57 Bajirao did not succeed in  his object of keeping the Kolaba fort in his possession, because, the General of Bassein  writes that Manaji himself was opposed to it.58 Bajirao only got Rajmachi and Kotia, both of  which were hill forts. Bajirao defeated Sambhaji Angria and forced him to give Kolaba fort to  Manaji. In April 1736, Siddi Sat attacked Manaji Angria Chimaji Appa, the Peshwa’s younger  brother, defeated Siddi Sat at Kamarli, near Alibag. This ended the three-year campaign of  the Mahrattas against the Siddi. As Bajirao was pre-occupied with the campaign against the  Siddii, the Portuguese had an opportunity of building a castle at Thana. From 24 March 1733,  Don Luiz Botelo was the General of Bassein. He quickly constructed the castle at Thana. On  September 11, 1736, the Bombay English informed the Viceroy at Goa that Bajirao was  making preparations to attack Thana and capture Salçette. The Viceroy informed Don Luiz  Botelo about it in a letter dated 24 September 1736.


Lakshmibai Angria sent her Karbhari Bhanji Lakhmanji with a letter dated October 25, 1736 to see the Viceroy in Goa. What intrigue she was carrying on is not clear. She received only an oral reply from Goa.59 She probably informed Goa about Bajirao’s movements in  Salçette and Bassein. Six months afterwards, on April 6, 1737, on Saturday at 11 p.m. the  Mahrattas captured a water-tower in Thana creek and entered Salçette.60 On April 6 and 7,  the Mahratta troops practically occupied the whole island. So the Portuguese had with them  only Bandra, Versoa, Karanja or Uran and Bassein Castle. As the Bombay English sent help  to the Portuguese at Bandra, it did not pass into Mahratta hands. At the time of the Mahratta invasion of Thana, the General of Bassein, Don Luiz Botelo was in Thana. From there he went  to Karanja and thereafter to Bassein.


On April 12, 1737, the news of Mahratta assault on Bassein reached Goa. On the  same day, the Viceroy Conde de Sandomele ordered the General of Bassein that he should  protect Dharavi with all his might. The importance of Dharavi as bastion of Bassein was as  well known to the Mahrattas as to the Portuguese. In a letter No. 27 in part 16 of Peshwa  Daftar it is said, “Dharavi is the nose of Bassein.” On April 18, an army under Pedro de Melo was despatched to Bassein. The Viceroy dismissed General Don Luiz Botelo and appointed  Antonio Cardim Froice in his place. He left Goa on May 18 and reached Bassein on May 23.  Next day he took over from Botelo. A few days before Cardim reached Bassein, the  Mahrattas had started building a fort on the Dongri Hill.


On May 26, 1737, Antonio Cardim attacked Dongri and turned out the Mahrattas from there. In his letter of May 28, 1737 he wrote, ‘I came to Bassein on May 23 and on May 26 I drove out the enemy from Dongri. I killed eighty of their men, exploded the fortress and  beheaded their Captain.” Antonio Cardim fancied that the Mahrattas would give rest to their troops during the rains. According to the Portuguese, about 25,000 soldiers were engaged in  this campaign and it was difficult for them to move from place to place during the rains. But  the Mahrattas sent select battalions on Bassein fort from Bahadurpura on June 9, 1737 in the  early hours and attacked the fortification between Reis Magus and San Goncalo towers. The  Portuguese say that 4000 men led this attack which lasted for half an hour. A number of men  were killed. Next day, the Portuguese found three wounded men and 32 ascending frames.  The Portuguese Chronicler, Diogo da Costa says that only two dead and five wounded were  the casualties from the Portuguese side.61


The Mahrattas led on attack on the Bassein fort for the second time on September,  15, 1737. It was Sunday. About 2000 soldiers sealed the fortification. The assault lasted for an  hour and a half but it was repulsed. As the Portuguese have recorded, 2000 Mahrattas were killed and 500 were wounded.62 But from the Shakavali in the Peshwa Daftar No. 359 in part  22 only about 500 were killed and about 500 were wounded. After the battle was over, the  Portuguese found at the base of the fortification 64 dead bodies and 44 scaling frames. Baji Bhivrao (Rethrekar) himself was wounded. The Portuguese sardar Pedro de Melo was also wounded. The Portuguese have written that several Mahratta Sardars fell in this battle.


The well-known historical research worker, Yeshwant Narsinha Kelkar has stated that  the second attack of the Mahrattas on Bassein took place on July 8, 1737.63 It is true that in  the Portuguese manuscript Relacao de Gerra and successao de India which the author has  published, this date as of the first attack on Bassein has been mentioned, but Antonio Cardim  himself in his letter dated August 29, 173764 says that the enemy led an assault on Bassein Castle at night on June 9 but it proved futile. In his letter dated March 5, 173865 he states that  the Mahrattas had twice assaulted the Bassein fort. It is hardly necessary to say that Antonio  Cardim’s dates are more trustworthy than those given by chroniclers. Besides, the Goa Archives also support the dates given by Antonio Cardim.66


Diogo de Costa who has written about the Bassein Campaign of the Mahrattas in his  Relacao dos guerras de India speaks of only these two attacks of June 9, 1737 and September 15, 1737. A manuscript (1487) in the library of the University at Coimbra contains  the same information.


After the Mahrattas were repulsed twice from Bassein Castle, they besieged Mahim,  Kelva and Shirgaon fortresses in October. Antonio Cardim states that the Mahrattas would  have captured these forts but because he sent timely help to them, the enemy had to  evacuate. (December 28, 1737 and January 27, 1738). Cardim had turned out the Mahhrattas  from Dongri i.e. Dharavi Hill on May 26, 1737., but on 30 November, 1737, 400 Hashams and  100 horsemen went up the top of the hill (aguada) and till February 1738, they established  themselves there and fixed Cannons, thus obstructing the passage of ships in the fort of  Bassein.

On 28, February 1738, Cardim once again attacked Dongri and routed the Mahrattas.  In this skirmish, the Portuguese made captive 50 soldiers and their captain. The Portuguese  found over 500 dead bodies of Mahrattas. Four Portuguese soldiers died and thirty were  wounded on this occasion. One of them was a captain of footmen. Of the native soldiers of  the Portuguese ten died and 20 were wounded. Cardim wrote that he reconquered the  Dharavi fortress only with the help of 200 Portuguese soliders. Nearly were 400 Mahratta horsemen and 1000 footmen who had to witness this rout.68 On 9 March 1738, Chimaji  attempted to take back Dongri hill from the Portuguese, but failed. He was very much hurt by  this defeat.69 He wrote to Nanasaheb, his nephew, ‘Dharavi’s iron has entered my heart and  God knows it. What could be done? Nothing at the moment. ‘Cardim in his letter, dated 5 March, 1738 said, “So far 12000 Mahrattas have died. Being numerous, they do not seem to be worried about it.”


The author has published the letters of Antonio Cardim and Pedro de Melo of  December, 5. 1738 in Part Ⅴ of Assentos do Conselho do Estado. These letters reveal how difficult the position of the Portuguese forces, engaged in this Bassein Campaign was. Antonio Cardim was a great general. Being well informed about the military power of the  Mahrattas he demanded of the Viceroy that more troops should be sent to Bassein. But he had neither troops nor money to raise them. So Antonio Cardim resigned the Generalship of Bassein Castle.


On October 17, 1738, the Viceroy convened a meeting of his councillors and presented  a list of the troops that were there in the vicinity of Bassein at the beginning of September  1738.70 It appears from this document that there were 897 soldiers of whom 521 were  Portuguese and 376 native. Subtracting those on the sick list, there were only 755 soldiers.  Besides these, 900 soldiers were engaged in the Bassein campaign. Of them 190 were on the  Bassein Coast, 411 at Dongri, 77 in Juvem, 144 at Mahim-Kelvem and 78 at Karanja-Uran.

From this authoritative information, it is clear that there were 3000 Mahrattas and under the  command of Pilaji Jadhav, there were 7000 soldiers and 700 horsemen ready to go there.  Such was the information of the Viceroy.


On 23 and 24 October 1738, troops from Portugal arrived in two ships. Among them  were 478 Renoles but 145 of them were ill. So from Goa, it was possible to send only 480,  men to Bassein. On November 1738, two frigates, three palas and three galvetas left Goa for  Bassein with these troops on board. On April 2, Martial Pedro de Mello was appointed  General of Bassein. On December 4, 1738 he went to attack Reis fort in Thana. On December  8, a cannon shot from the fort killed him. The Portuguese in Bassein received aid and supplies from sea from Goa and Daman. In order to stop this, Bajirao despatched in November 1738, 8000 horsemen and 10,000 footmen under the command of Shankarajipant. The Mahratta  armies marched towards Daman, captured Khattalvada, Umbargaon, Nargol and Dahanu  and carried away standing crops. A Portuguese chronicler says that the Mahrattas even  plundered the grain godowns near the fortifications of Daman. After such exploits in the neighbourhood of Daman, the Mahratta armies returned to Agashi and Bhadrapur.71 The  Portuguese had kept Pardi in their possession so far but gave it up under orders of their  superiors. Captain Domingos de Souza was then there.

After the death of Pedro de Mello, the Captain of the Bassein fort, Joao Xavier Pereira  Pinto kept on the fight until Martinho de Silveira de Menezes took over as the General of  Bassein province on 8, January 1739. He bravely kept on the struggle against the Mahrattas. The next day, the Mahrattas entered Mahim. Under the command of Chimaji Appa, Pilaji  Jadhav and Shankarjipant, 8000 horsemen arrived in Bassein town. A day previously, 6000  Hashams of the Mahrattas had come. This army encircled Mahim Fort. There were 14  elephants, several horses and 12 camels in the Mahratta army as stated by the Portuguese  Captain of Mahim on January 10, 1739.73


In a statement made by leading persons in Mahim Fort describing the movements of  the Mahrattas dated January 20, 1739 is available in Biblioteca Publica de Evora.74 The  statement says, “The Mahrattas so furiously bombarded the fortifications through their 30  cannons that several breaches were caused. There are excellent foreign gunmen  (Condestaveis) in the Mahratta army and they fling big boulders (morteiros) in the fort  through their cannons. They were showering fire on the fort day and night. General Martinno de Silveira de Menezes sent a battalion from Bassein to aid Mahim. But in the face of the  Mahratta firing, it took three days for it to enter the fort. This battalion consisted of only 50  Portuguese and 90 native soliders. The ammunition they brought with them was consumed  within two days. This fort has been holding out for a year and ten months and it is not possible to hold out longer. During the seige, the Mahrattas lost heavily in men and Shankarajipant’s brother Madojipant and forty-four other leading Mahrattas were killed.  Tonight the Mahrattas will explode the fort in a revengeful spirit for certain and therefore the  Captain of the fort should open talks of peace, capitulate and save the lives of the people  inside.”


The name of the Captain of Mahim was Antonio de Melo Pereira de Sousa. In  deference to the statement of the inmates of the Fort, he opened surrender talks with  Shankarajipant. Chimaji Appa was not then on the spot. The surrender deed was signed by  the Captain and Shankaraji and the Mahrattas took possession of the fort on January 20,  1739. This treaty enjoins that in the name of Bajirao, the Portuguese should be allowed to  depart with all their belongings but the minutes of the meeting of the Council of Ministers of  the Viceroy held on March 1, 1739 record that all the soliders in Mahim were beheaded and  the whole of the battalion that went from Bassein to the succour of Mahim was wholly  chopped off by the Mahrattas.75 But in the letter from Martinho de Silveira dated February 18,  1739 it is stated that the enemy had kept all the Portuguese captives at Kalyan.76


After Mahim, the Mahrattas conquered Kelve and Shirgaon, two more Portuguese  posts on January 21 and 22, 1739. Chimaji then proceeded with his army to Tarapore and laid siege to the fort. A Portuguese Chronicle says that Chimaji captured it on the seventh day but  from a letter written by Chimaji himself, it appears that it was captured on 4 February 1739.77 The Portuguese chroniclers say that the Mahrattas had to sustain heavy damages in the fight for Tarapore. Baji Bhivrao Rethrekar died in action. The Portuguese Captain of Tarapore Luiz  Veleso Machado also died while fighting. There were many Portuguese women in the fort who were made captive but Chimaji gave them very decent treatment, according to a Portuguese chronicler.78 (Chimaji Apa os tratou com toda a decencia) Another writer has recorded that  Chimaji Appa played the role of a perfect gentelman with the widow of Captain Luis Velezo.79 A story is current that Chimaji respectfully treated the wife of the General of Bassein and it has  found place in even poetical compositions. The root of that story could be traced to this  Tarapore incident.


Under the command of Haripant, 4000 Hashams and 500 cavalry were despatched from Tarapore to capture Asheri, which fell to the Mahrattas without much effort on February  13 or 14. The Peshwa Shakavali says that Asheri was surrendered because the family of the  Captain of Asheri were among the Tarapore Captives. Three days atter, on 17 February,  Chimaji went with his army to Bhadrapur which the Portuguese pronounced as Madrapur. Portuguese Chroniclers have said that the Mahratta army consisted of 25000 horsemen,  40000 footmen, 4000 mine-exploders, 5000 camels, 50 elephants and innumerable Pindaris.  The Mahrattas formed advance-guards despite the fire the Portuguese were pouring from the  towers of the castle. This was executed with such speed and discipline that the Chief Portuguese Engineer, Don Adriano de Gonvil was altogether amazed. A Portuguese  chronicler says that the innumerable people’s death from the cannonfire from the castle  towers must be described as utter barbarism.80


About this time, orders were given by the Viceroy to the General of Bassein. Martinho  de Silveira that he should surrender all the forts in Bassein territory except Daman, Bassein,  Diu, Revdanda and Karanja (Uran). Accordingly, Pardi, Bandra, Versova and Dongri were  given up for the Mahrattas to capture. On 20 February, they took possession of Versova. The  Bombay English with Portuguese collaboration demolished Bandra fortifications on 5 April  1739. On 25 April, the Mahrattas captured Dongri. On 21 March, Manaji Angria had already  taken possession of Karanja or Uran island. For the conquest of Uran, Manaji took 2000 men  in his armada which comprised forty galvetas according to the description in Relacao de  Guerra manuscript in Biblioteca Nacional de Lisboa. It was possible for the Portuguese to  maintain the defence of Bassein after surrendering Dongri (Dharavi) but they did not have strength enough to defend Dongri. To the north of Bassein fort, the land side was free, but  the Mahrattas had already established their sentinels there. All the three other sides were full  of mud and sea water. Whatever was at all possible to be done to help Bassein was only by  sea at grave risk.


In a meeting of the Councillors at Goa, one member expressed the opinion that even  Bassein and Revdanda should be surrendered out of helplessness.81 In order to cut off all help  from Goa to Bassein Salçete in Goa was invaded by Venkatrao Ghorpade under Bajirao’s  orders on January 23, 1739. The Mahrattas occupied the whole of salçete except the two forts  of Raitur and Mormugao. Dadajirao Bhave Nargundkar was Venkatrao’s colleague. On 5 March the Bhonsala Savant of Savantavadi invaded Bardez and captured it. The Portuguese kept with them only Aguada and Reis Magus. On March 1, 1739 the Mahrattas captured  Ponda fort from the Prince of Saunde. This became a direct menace to Goa island.82 Under  these circumstances, the Portuguese made a treaty of friendship with the Mahrattas on May  6, 1739 at Rai. One clause in the treaty provided for making over the Bassein Castle to the  Mahrattas.


While these events were taking place in Goa, a severe battle was being fought in  Bassein. On April 15, 1739, the General of Bassein, Martinho de Silveira, fell a victim to a bullet from the Mahrattas while reconnoitring from the tower, Reme Deos. His place was  taken by Caitano de Souza Pereira who kept on the fight. On 17 April 1739 he wrote a letter to  the Viceroy in which he has showered panegyrics on the military acumen of the Mahrattas. Another letter of his written on 17 August 1739 is also available which contains a detailed  description of the battle of Bassein from April 17 to its fall on May 16. He says there were two  lakh men engaged in the siege including soldiers and those behind them. During the last two

days alone over 10000 of them must have lost their lives. In the letter of 17 April, he said that  over 50000 soldiers were going to lead an assault on the fortifications of the Castle.83 Inside  the Bassein Castle, there were 1200 Hindus. Caitano de Sousa Pereira turned out 1000 of  them with the consent of the Viceroy, because it was feared that they might rebel, besides, there was paucity of foodgrains.84

The author came across a copy of the letter that Chimaji Appa had sent to Chhatrapati  Shahu, in Goa Archives. The whole of this letter is very important. Appasaheb writes, “The  Portuguese fought courageously like true soldiers. For four and a half hours, the Portuguese  showered fire on us. The Mahratta soldiers took in all this fire and bore it. It was the limit of  forbearance. There was no such resistance before.” Because of the Mahratta assault in this  manner, the situation inside the castle deteriorated very much on May 13 and 14. During the  course of the day on May 13, the Mahrattas led eleven and on May 14 six severe attacks on  San Sebastiao and Reme Deos towers. Between San Sebastiao and Cavaleiro towers, the  explosions of mines by the Mahrattas had made a breach. Four thousand Mahrattas  attempted to push through it. But the Portuguese fire made it futile. On May 15 and 16,  Caitano de Sousa Pereira conferred with his leading subordinates and came to the conclusion  that it was impossible to defend the fort longer and on 16th May, the Portuguese flew the white flag, indicating surrender and appeal for peace. Pereira appointed Pedro de Rego  Barreto de Gama e Castro to carry on peace talks with Chimaji Appa and a treaty was made  on 16 May 1739, between the Mahrattas and the Portuguese. On May 23, the Portuguese left  the castle to the accompaniment of band music and Chimaji took possession of it. He had written to Gangaji Naik Anjurkar at the beginning of the campaign of Bassein that the  Portuguese were not very affluent people; when starved they would come to terms. It  happened exactly like that. They were starved on every front. Supplies from Goa and Daman  stopped and they had no alternative left, but to surrender the castle.


In the Bassein battle, the Portuguese lost 500 Portuguese and 350 native soldiers.  Besides, quite many of them were beheaded according to the manuscript, sucessos do India in Biblioteca Nacional de Lisboa. Reports of Cardim and Pereira show that 22000 Mahrattas  lost their lives in this battle. Chhatrapati Shahu gave the same figure to Gordon. After the  battle of Bassein only Diu, Daman and Revdanda remained with the Portuguese. This war  went on for 25 months and a half. This Bassein campaign is an excellent illustration of the  military strategy of the Mahrattas. The Portuguese have written about the valour of the  Mahrattas that they exhibited in this campaign.


Viceroy Marquez de Alorna, in his letter written to the King of Portugal on 27  December 1745 says :86

“A ultima perda da Provincia do Norte nao so diminiun o Dominio e a renda do  estado, mas tambem o credito e o respeito que nos tinha os vezinhos de que antes se nao  fazia cazo, e nos erao, sumissos rebelarao-se contra nos e converterao-se em inimigos mais  perigosos por estazem mais a porta, aproeitarao-se da nossa fraqueza para insultarnos, e  intentarem expulsar -nos deste paiz, e ainda agora o Bonsulo nao perde de vista esta idea a  nos suscita inimigos ao longe a procura contra nos a sua alianca .”.


The gist of this passage is that being compelled to give up their north Konkan territory, the Portuguese lost in power, prestige and revenue. The Asian people lost the confidence  they had in the Portuguese and the respect they had for them. Their neighbours like Savant Bhonsle of Savantavadi and others who were afraid of them were busy making efforts to turn them out of India. People in Portugal were astonished to see that the Mahrattas observed the  terms of the treaty loyally and well.87


Sashtichi Bakhar describes how the Portuguese resorted to religious persecution of the Hindus and it conforms to a great extent to what obtains in Portuguese sources. Like the  Christianisation of Tiswadi, Salcete and Bardez in Goa, the Christianisation of Bassein was  effected on one and the same principle. “Cuins regio, illius religio” is that principle. It means  the people of a kingdom have the same religion that its ruler professes. In Goa Archives, there  is a manuscript entitled ‘Provisoes a favour da Cristandade”. Its name previously was ‘Livero  do Pai de Cristaos”. There are authoritative copies of all laws passed from time to time for the  dissemination of Catholism among the people under Portuguese rule.88 They afford a clear  idea of how the Portuguese persecuted non-Christians. As a matter of fact such laws were in  vogue in Portugal for many years intended for the Jews and the Mussalmans. Later on laws  on the same pattern were made for Hindus and Muslims in Goa and Bassein. Probably,  people in Bassein had to suffer even more rigorous persecution than people in Goa did. The  vatandar in that Province had to submit a report of his efforts for the spread of Christianity  among Hindus and Muslims in their respective villages.89


There is a letter in Arquivo Nacional da Torre do Tombo, Lisbon which was written by  Anji Naik (Anjurkar?) to the King of Portugal from Bassein on December 18, 1549.90 From that letter and the Chronicle of Salcete and Bassein, the feelings of the Hindus in that territory can  be guaged.91 The Inquisition was established in Goa in 1560. It was really meant for Jews and  Christians and not for the Hindus. But Pope Gregory ⅩⅢ had promulgated a bull named  incipit Antiqua indocrum improbitos and on that authority the Inqisition applied it to Hindus  also in some respects.92 There is a manuscript called Repertorio Geral in Biblioteca Nacional  de Lisboa in which are recorded the 3800 cases made by the Inquisition in Goa from 1565 to  1615; it is written by Joao Degaldo Figeira.93 Many Hindu names appear in it. It is true that  Hindu offenders were not burnt alive.94 They were either whipped or transported. The transportation had often to be served in such distant lands as Mozambique in Africa. In 1774  the Goa Inquisition was abolished when one Babu Shenvai of Uskai (Bardez) was serving  transportation sentence along with a number of Christian.95 The Goa Inquisition caught hold  of orphans below 14 and baptised them from 1645.96 Even the Viceroy was incapable of acting  against the Inquisition.97 It brought under its administration even pregnant Hindu widows. In a  letter dated April 19, 1737 addressed to Maiz de Santo Officio, the Viceroy says that one  reason why the Hindus in Bassein allied with the Mahrattas was their persecution by the Inquisition.98 The Viceroy has further said that the Captain of Salçette Joao de Souza Ferras  had informed him that if the Hindus in Bassein were left free to follow their religious practices  as they were in Diu, far from cooperating with the Mahrattas, they would have turned them  out of Bassein and therefore the maiz should consider this point well and give him the right  counsel.


Of course, the Inquisition authorities were wholly indifferent to the conciliatory gesture  of the Viceroy and they refused to alter the traditional practices of the Inquisition. There was one more important reason why the Salcete-Bassein Hindus allied with the Mahrattas. The  Portuguese had immensely oppressed the people by levying harshly cesses on the people  and at least in the early stages exploited rigorously the labourers while erecting the castle at  Thana. Great discontent prevailed in Salçete on this account and they helped the Mahrattas  to establish themselves in Salcete.99 In a letter written by Siddi Yakut Khan it is stated that  Chhatrapati Shahu aspired for many years to capture Bassein territory.100 Some historians take the view that Bajirao invaded Bassein in order to establish Mahrashtra Dharma. This view  is supported by Sashtichi Bakhar and some contemporary Marathi documents. Damaji  Gaikwad, Samsher Bahadur writes : The Portuguese persecuted Hindus. Therefore Appa  Saheb invaded Bassein territory and captured one or two places. (Peshwa Daftar Part ⅩⅥ, p. 135). Amritrao Shankar Dinkarrao also congratulates Chimaji Appa for having conquered  Bassein in the following words : “Since success has been achieved in Bassein, the  establishment of Hindu raj will be carried out (by you). (Peshwa Daftar, Part ⅩⅥ. p. 136).  There is a contemporary Marathi chronicle by Balaji Ganesh in Bibliothe Nationale de Paris  (Chronique de Shivadji, Ms. 661) in which the following sentence occurs : In the Bassein  campaign twelve to fourteen Hashams died. Appa Saheb exerted his utmost to conquer  Firangana and establish the rule of Hindu Dharma.


Yet, the Portuguese sources appear to make out that the Bassein campaign had not  much to do with religious considerations. There was some cursory discussion about the  Portuguese permitting Goa Hindus to observe their religious customs and traditions during  peace negotiations between the Portuguese and the Mahrattas.101 The Mahrattas had made  suggestions to the Portuguese to the effect that the Inquisition should exercise no authority  over the Hindus and the ‘Shendi tax’ should not be imposed upon them. But they were not stressed later and in the treaty that was ultimately signed all clauses regarding religious  concessions to the Hindus were dropped. Even the Viceroy has said that the Mahrattas did  not show much keenness about Hindu religious matters during several discussions on treaties  between the Mahrattas and the Portuguese.102


According to Portuguese sources, the main reason behind the Bassein campaign was expansion of territory and through that to secure ports on the western coast. The oontemporary manuscript (F. G. 1605) Relacao de guerra in Biblioteca Nacional de Lisboa  says : “In taking possession of Salcette the object is not only to exploit the fertile lands over  there, but also perhaps to resort to piracy from Versova as base of operations. On the  strength of the practice of this vocation, the notorious Angria became so rich and powerful.” Viceroy Conde de Sandomele also held the same opinion. In his letter dated 20 November  1738 he ways; “For long I have thought that the object of the enemy in this fight is to secure a  port on the coast and became powerful on the seas also.”103


Having this at the back of his mind, Conde de Sandomele intended to write on 27  January, 1739 the following letter to Chhatrapati Shahu. He says, “I believe that you have  entered into this battle because you desire to have a port on the coast that will be suitable for  commercial and allied interests of your State. If that is so, we shall have no objection to cede  to you such a port and fort.”104 Even the English of Bombay did not hold a different opinion as  to the objects of the aggression in Bassein and Salcette. The Governor of Bombay in his letter  dated September 23, 1737 has written.105 Their apparent chief aim has for a long time been  getting a sea port for themselves …… and this view of acquiring a port or settlement of the sea  coast must be considered as the principal motive that hath determined the Mahrattas to this  invasion, though, perhaps, it may have been hastened by the well-grounded complaints of  their Geotoo Brethren under the Portuguese Government who have been made frequent examples of the cruelty of the Inquisition which hath been exercised upon those unhappy  subjects with equal severity, ignorance and superstition.” (Bombay to Company, October, 1737, Orme Mss. No. 124).


From a letter written by Yesaji Raghunath to Bajirao, it is clear that the Mahrattas  desired to exercise power over the sea as they did on the land. Yesaji says, “Your glory spreads every day in all directions. But do you not aspire to own an area in Konkan and spread your glory in lower Konkan and the sea as it has spread up the ghauts?”106 The  Portuguese statesman Bispu de Alicarnaco has written in 1712 that after capturing Bassein the  Mahrattas have immediately started building warships at Arnala (Ⅰlhas de Vacas) and they  have their big armada there.107 A Portuguese chronicle mentions that the Mahrattas used to  say on the strength of the sanad of Sardeshmukhi that the Moghul Emperor had given to

Shahu in 1719 that the Mahrattas had the presogative of extending their authority in the  Portuguese territory in Konkan.108


A detailed description of the prowess of the Mahrattas in the Bassein campaign is to  be found in Vasaichi Mohim by Y. N. Kelkar who made quite a generous use of the author’s  two Portuguese books on this topic. But it will be proper to sum up in brief the information  that became available to the author after Kelkar’s book was published.


First of all it must be noted that when Bajirao invaded Goa, it was not his intention to  conquer that territory for all time. This conclusion is inescapable after the perusal of several  Marathi chronicles.109 Bajirao was compelled to attack Goa in order to stop supplies of men  and materials to Bassein by sea.110 According to the treaty of Warna, Goa territory fell in the  orbit of the Chhatrapati of Kolhapur and so the Chhatrapati of Satara did not consider it right  to meddle with Goa.111 Besides, Bajirao may have thought that the Portuguese would offer  stiff resistance in Goa.


There is a letter in Goa Archives sent by Annajipant, envoy of the Prince of Saunde to  the Secretary of the Viceroy, Dr. Luis Affonso Dantas on October 6, 1737 in which it is said, “I  hear from up the ghauts that Bajirao is going to invade this territory. Savant Bhonsla is being  instructed to be ready for this event in all respects. You may have learnt it from him or  otherwise. Letters have also gone to the Prince of Saunde, though what they contain is not  known. But what is he going to do by coming to this side? These things have happened  before. Twentyfive thousand soldiers came from Bijapur. Shivaji and Sambhaji also tried their  hands. What the effect of aII this was is well known. So Bajirao will go the same way. There is  a rumour that the Moghul is marching on him. God will save Goa and defeat the enemy.’’


It is remarkable that these are the thoughts of a Hindu statesman who was a  neighbour of Goa.


In a letter of Sardar Ramkrishna Chimnaji of Shahu’s Court, it is said, “Some people  think that Goa is a more difficult place than Bassein. It is no use sending armies there,  because the Portuguese will not pay. That is why no forces were sent on Goa. Bassein keeps  strong, because help from Goa reaches there frequently. Forces were to be kept in Savant Bhonsla’s territory and in Karnatak to exercise pressure. When Vyankatrao went and took  over Salcete and Bardez, the Chhatrapati and others were surprised. They were encouraged to see that it was easier to take Goa than Bassein.”


A contemporary Portuguese report says that when Bajirao invaded Goa and  conquered some territory, Chhatrapati Sambhaji of Kolhapur was much incensed.113

It is well known that many Hindus from Bassein allied with the Mahrattas during the  Bassein Campaign. Portuguese sources mention that some Hindus in Goa also allied with the  Mahrattas when Vyankatrao invaded Goa. But their names are not known.114


Goan Hindus were orginally with the Portuguese, but when they saw that the  Mahrattas were the winning party they went over to them according to a charge made by the  Chief of the Inquisition.115 But he was unable to produce any evidence in support of the  charge. On the contrary many a respectable Hindu, at least to all appearances, helped the  Portuguese to the last. Some of them were : Vyankati Kamat, Upya Kamat, Babulya Shenai  Sukhtankar, Baburao Desai of Narve, Santu Shenai Dangi, Vithoji Shenay Dhume, Bhagvan  Kamat Vagh etc.116


One source that alleges that Goan Hindus had gone over to the Mahrattas during the  invasion of Goa is a manuscript No. 4180 in Biblioteca Nacional da Lisboa. This was written  by a learned Portuguese who was in Goa in 1744. It is said therein that a certain Hindu  brought the Mahrattas in Goa in the battle of 1739 and he was sentenced to death. The name  of this Hindu is not given in the manuscript and the author did not find it even after a vigorous  search in Goa Archives Another source is a Portuguese report on the Mahratta invasion of  Goa which undoubtedly is a very valuable, authentic source. Its title is Relacao sumaria dos  Successos de Goa com e guerra do Maratta. When Bhonsala of Savantvadi invaded Bardez,  many people went over to him according to this report, but their names are not given.


The well-known Goan learned Padre. Sebastiao Rego gave a sermon in Goa in 1745 in  which he said that Hindus in Goa assured Mahrattas that the Portuguese were unable to  resist them and helped them to enter Bardez and Salcette. On top of this, people were then saying that the Hindus had conspired with the Mahrattas for making over Goa city to them.  But even this writer depends only on rumour for support. From this sermon, the Padre’s  prejudice against the Hindus is only laid bare.


As a matter of fact the Christians in Goa and especially the Padres like Sebastiao  Rego, were very jealous of the Hindus. They believed that the Hindus of Goa, by and large,  favoured the Mahrattas. They were also jealous of the wealth of the Hindu traders. Their expectation was that trade and commerce in Goa should be predominently in Christian  hands.117 These Padres held the view that the State of Goa rightfully belonged to the  Christians and Hindus should not have even the right to live there.118 There was a Portuguese writer in Goa in 1725 who held that the decline of Goa began when the Hindus began to enjoy  religious concessions in Goa.119

These Padres’ hatred for Hindus reached a saturation point when they saw that in the  war of 1739, the Mahrattas were winning one success after another over the Portuguese. The  Chief of the Inquisition even brought a resoultion in the meeting of the State Concil held on 11  March 1739 that the wealth of all Hindus in Goa be consficated and they be turned out of  Goa.120 The inquisition had made a similar attempt before, though it was unsuccessful.121 Rumours were spread in those days that the Hindus were secretly in league with the  Mahrattas.122 The Viceroy had kept under detention several leading Hindus in Mormugao fort  on 10, March 1739 on the ground that they were likely to be persecuted and tortured by the  Padres.123


One such canard brought one rich Hindu trader in serious trouble. Phondu Kamat  lived at Paneli near Goa. A canard spread in the town that 400 armed soliders of the enemy  were concealed in his mansion. This was on 8 March 1739. Taking advantage of this, many  padres and their Christian followers raided Kamat’s mansion and plundered whatever they  could lay their hands on. Viceroy Conde de Sandomele himself went there on horseback and  in order to pacify the people, he placed under arrest Phondu Kamat and his brother-in-law  Vithoji Naik Prataprao Sardesai. On inquiry, it was found that the charge against him was  baseless.124 In place of 400 armed Mahrattas, only half a dozen of Vithoji Naik Sardesai’s  soldiers were found. On the day this padre-led raid on Kamat’s house took place, some  Christians also plundered many Hindu shops.125


Some rioters insulted even Conde de Sandomele on this occasion and they did not  hesitate to allege that he was in the pay of Hindus. Really speaking, even the Viceroy’s  outlook on matters relating to Hindus and their religion was unsympathetic and harsh. The  Portuguese were wholly uncosious of the principle of toleration in those days. An illustration  would be in point in this connection. In 1735, A Hindu recluse came down the ghaut to bathe in the holy waters of Narve, but lost his way and came to Goa. The Portuguese arrested him  and with the consent of Conde de Sandomele forcibly converted him to Christianity in the  Bom Jesus Church at Goa.126 Illustrations of this kind can be multiplied with reference to  Conde de Sandomele. Whatever that may be, it is clear from the case of Phondu Kamat, that  he was against injustice being done.


On 23 January 1739, the Mahratta army under the command of Sardar Vyankatrao Ghorpade descended on Salcete through Dighi Ghat.127 He was accompanied by Dadajirao Bhave Nargundkar, Jiwaji Shinde and others. Vyankatrao was the brother-in-law of Bajirao  and Chimaji. Dadajirao was the nephew of Ramrao Bhave. Ramrao had carried away a loot of  over five lakh asurpis from Salcete in Goa on 25 April 1717.128 On this account he had earned a bad name in Goa. On behalf of Bajirao (Shahu) Vyankatrao Ghorpade and on behalf of



Chhatrapati Sambhaji of Kolhapur, Dadajirao Bhave were the leading men in this invasion of Goa.129


The Viceroy had come to know about a month previously from Captain Inchbird of the  Bombay English and Narsingrao, Captain of Mardangad that Vyankatrao Ghorpade would  march on Goa. Besides, a Sardar of the Court of the Bhonsla of Savantvadi had informed the  Viceroy that Bajirao had got the Bhonsla of Savantvadi and Sambhaji Angria to join him in this  invasion of Goa.130 But the Portuguese had neither the men not the money required for  resisting this aggression. This is apparent from the statement that the Viceroy had made in  the meeting of his Councillors on 17 October 1738.131 Viceroy Marquez de Lourical wrote on 20  September, 1741 that in the days of Conde de Sandomele there were only 1,156 paid  soldiers.132


A Portuguese report of those days says that the Mahratta army comprised 4,000  cavalry, 6,000 infantry and two thousand Pindaris.133 The biography of Shahu by Malhar  Ramrao Chitnis says “Vyankatrao Narayan with 10,000 Hashams and equipment was  sent.”134 Another Portuguese report says that there were 3,000 horsemen, 6,000 footmen and  2,000 unarmed Pindaris. In his letter to the Viceroy written in the beginning of February 1739,  Nagu Savant Bhonsla says that the army consited of from 5,000 to 6,000 horsemen and 2,000  footmen.135 Yet another contemporary report has it that there were 2,000 horsemen and 4000  footmen.136 This figure is more trustworthy, because the same has been given by Conde de  Sandomele.137 A letter written by the Sardar of Ponda, Narsingrao on 23 January 1739 at 6  p.m. to the Viceroy is available in Goa Archives which says that he was informing the  movements of the army to the Portuguese Government from the moment it camped at  Khanapur. There was no worth while resistance to the Mahratta army. It took Margao on  January 25 and camped near the town.138


Tuku Naik, a captain of native soldiers in the fort of Cuncolim joined with his battalion  the Mahratta army as soon as he learnt that the Mahrattas had captured the fort of Margao.139 The people in Ponda and specially the villagers of Marcaim gave every kind of help to  Vyankatrao’s army. The brave Kharvis of Durbate assured Vyankatrao that they would help  him to enter the island of Goa with alacrity. Not only this, but they captured an armed ship of  the Portuguese (galia) in the early hours of 4 February in the Rasai river and made it over to  the Mahratlas.140


Because of the co-operation of the people of Ponda, Vyankatrao captured  Mardangad without firing a single shot. Govind Ram Thakur, Dewan of Vyankatrao, marched  on Ponda at the head of 500 horsemen when Narsingrao, Captain of the fort himself, opened the gates of the Fort and surrendered himself and the fort to the Mahrattas. Immediately, the

Mahrattas captured the fort of Usgaon. All this happened on 1 March 1739.141 A few days  later, Vyankatrao took Sangem and Supem without any opposition and kept his army there.


The Portuguese were frightened out of their wits when they learnt that Ponda was  captured by the Mahrattas. Ponda was next door to Goa and they feared that the Mahrattas  would attack Goa town any moment. The canard spread in Goa that Vyankatrao had announced at Margao that after entering Goa he would ride in a palanquin to be carried over  the shoulders of four Inquisitors which terrified them and he would set free all their prisoners  according to a contemporary Portuguese report.142 The Mahrattas captured Salçete, but the  Portuguese did not surrender the two forts of Raitur and Mormugao. At this time there was  some intrigue going on between the Bhonsla of Savantvadi and the Portuguese.


On February 16, 1739, the Mahrattas besieged Raitur fort. On the same day, the Viceroy had thanked the Bhonsla of Savantvadi for having refused to co-operate.  Ramchandra Savant and Jairam Savant were ruling at Savantvadi whose Karbhari was Deoba  Vishram Sabnis, whom the Portuguese described as the Demosthenis of the Bhonsla.  Deoba’s brother Minoo Shenvi was a trader at Divadi in Portuguese territory. He was a son in-law of Santoppa Naik, who was a wealthy merchant of Goa. On this account, Minoo  Shenvi and Deoba Vishram came in contact with the Portuguese Viceroy. At the begining of March, the Bhonsla informed the Viceroy that Bajirao was pressing him to invade Bardez. So  if the Portuguese desired peace with him, they should return Khorjuve and Panale to him. Also the tribute of one thousandt asurpis that he was paying to the Portuguese should be  remitted. Besides, the expenditure that he had incurred for two months to protect Bardez  from Bajirao’s army should be given to him by the Portuguese. These conditions were not  acceptable to the Portuguese and on 5 March 1739 the Bhonsla invaded Bardez and captured it in deference to the wishes of the Peshwa.


The sons of Vishram Sabnis had informed Minoo Shenvi, in advance that this invasion  was expected and they had given even the precise timing and Minoo Shenvi duly kept the  Portuguese posted with it.143 One Portuguese account says that even after the Portuguese  had this information, it was not possible for them to protect Bardez, because a number of  people of Bardez had already gone over to the Savantvadi camp and so those Goan soldiers  who were in the neighbourhood of Kamurli made way for the Mahrattas to enter Bardez. The  Portuguese decided only to guard Aguada and Reis Magus and give up the rest of Bardez. It  is no wonder that there was great commotion in Goa because Bardez and Salcete had  passed on to the Mahrattas and Ponda was already in their hands except the Raitur,  Marmugao, Aguada and Reis Magus forts.

On March 8, 1739, all women and children in Goa and the nuns in the Monic  monastery were removed to Mormugao fort. On the Mahrattas entering Salçete, many  Christian families went to Goa island with all their valuables. They feared that the Mahrattas  would enter Goa also and everybody tried to run to Mormugao. In a letter written to Chimaji  Appa, Dadajirao Bhave said : “We are after Goa also. But all have fled away and only  desolate houses have remained. We shall act as all of us will decide.”145 Many cattle from Goa  had fled to the coast. Vyankatrao wrote to the Captain of Sidhudurg that they should be taken  away as loot but Raghoji Thorat did not carry out the suggestion of Vyankatrao, out of a  desire to show fraternal sympathy with the Portuguese146


People in Goa recalled the days of the invasion of Sambhaji in 1683, but their hope  then was that help from the Moghul would come. No help from Portugal was possible. So the  Viceroy requested help from the Pondichery French and the Bombay English.147 On February  27, 1739, a Dutch armada came near Goa. The Viceroy offered to give the Dutch the Cheul  fort and asked their help against the Mahrattas but the Dutch declined the offer.148


From January 27, 1739, the Portuguese were eager to enter into a treaty with the  Mahrattas. The Viceroy tried for it in various ways before Vyankatrao came to Goa. He tried to  establish contact directly with Chhatrapati Shahu, through Naro Ram Mantri but he was convinced that no treaty was possible without Bajirao’s consent149 and so he at last  beseeched Vyankatrao for a treaty on 8 March 1739. The whole account of this treaty is very  instructive and though Marathi documents do not give much information, the Portuguese  records are regular and consistent. This research throws a flood of light on the character of  Sardar Dadajirao Bhave Nargundkar and what is surprising is that several Marathi letters of  Dadajirao and his son Bhaskarrao support the inferences that can be drawn from the  Portuguese papers.150


A number of rich Hindu merchants lived in Goa. Several of them were greatly attached  to the Portuguese. Because their connections were with Brazil, Macao, Mozambique and  other Portuguese colonies, they earned rich profits. Portuguese records of those days clearly  show that well known Hindu business men like Phondu Kamat supplied information regarding  the Mahrattas to the Portuguese and offered other help.151 High officials of the Portuguese  also maintained cordial relations with them. The Viceroy hatched the project of postponing the battle by trying to bribe some sardars of the Mahrattas through these Hindu merchants.  Before that he made arrangements to despatch supplies of food and arms and men to Raitur  so that the Captain could maintain his resistance. Sardar Dadajirao was very obliging to the  Portuguese in this matter and a bribe of 70,000 asurpis was fixed for him and 12,000 were  immediately paid to him as first instalment through Vyankati Kamat, a rich Hindu merchant.

This intrigue was managed through Mahadaji Shenvi, Karbhari of Dadajirao. Mahadaji Shenvi  was related to Babulya Shenvi Sukhtankar. The Portuguese used him to win over Dadajirao.


A manuscript in Portuguese, purporting to be a report on the invasion of Goa by  Vyankatrao, says that Vyankati Kamat was called to Agshi (Agacim) and sent to the Mahratta camp. After returning from there he said that he made an agreement with Madu Shenvi and  Dadajirao that Dadajirao should resort to delaying tactics in regard to assault on Raitur and till  the treaty negotiation started he should allow the Portuguese to send help to the fort. For this  assistance he should be paid 70,000 asurpis of which 12,000 should be paid forthwith. Of this  sum Dadaji should keep 10,000 and 2,000 should be paid to his Karbhari, Madu (Madhavaji)  Shenvi. They were compelled to do this under the pressure of a very difficult situation.153


The same report says further : “The garrison of Raitur held out for many days in the  hope that a treaty was in the offing. All the same, the threat of an assault was there all the  time. One attack was made but it was not forceful. Dadajirao told the Portuguese envoy  assuredly that the assault was made without his consent and he raised obstruction in order  that it might not be effective. He also gave the assurance that the army under his command  would not raise impediments in the way of the Portuguese who were carrying aid to the Raitur garrison. There was paucity of grain in the fort.”154


Portuguese records show that Sardar Dadajirao Bhave had accepted bribes from the  Portuguese and established fraternal relations with them. The working of Dadaji’s mind can  also be followed on the basis of some of his letters. In a letter written to the Portuguese  Viceroy Marquez de Louriçala.155


In a letter written to Chimaji Appa in 1739 Dadaji wrote that the Portuguese were  sinners and they must be destroyed.156 The same Dadaji wrote to the Viceroy Marquez de  Louriçala that the Portuguese were good for conversation, honest in word and action, true to  the word once given. That was the intelligence he received as soon as he came down the  ghaut and therefore decided to save Goa. In another letter to the same Viceroy in February  1742 he says that the Viceroy had to pay attention to all directions. Goa was recently saved.  He only desired to be more and more serviceable. He had also sent a letter to the Secretary  saying that he had saved Goa. Until he was murdered in 1742157 his fraternising with the  Portuguese went on as could be verified from correspondence in Goa Archives.


Dadaji’s son Bhaskarrao wrote to Vithoji Shenvi Dhume that his father had cultivated a  special kind of friendship with the Portuguese in Goa over all others. The Portuguese were  very good-natured, true to their word and their action conformed with it and very brave too.  They could not be compared with any others on this earth. His father always impressed this on his mind and he found that out by personal experience.158 This Bhaskarrao, in another  letter to the Secretary, tells him that his father had served Goa and gained Goa’s favour. In  yet another letter he said his father earned the enmity of others but he fraternised with the  Portuguese. He also told Bhaskarrao that he had cultivated the friendship of the Portuguese  and they would be helpful to him (Bhaskarrao). The author can multiply extracts on these  lines to any length.


At the beginning, Vyankati Kamat went to see Dadajirao on behalf of the Portuguese  for the treaty talks. Later Dadaji asked the Viceroy to send some influential Portuguese to  continue the talks and so Antonio Carneiro de Alcaçoua and Jose Pedro Emaos were  nominated by the Portuguese. On March 11, 1739 these Portuguese Fidalgos, Bhagoon  Kamat Vagh, Vyankati Kamat and Upya Kamat with their retinue went to Kelshi on the bank of  the Zuari. On reaching Kelshi, Dhondobarao, Govindpant Thakur and Mahadaji Shenvi went to receive the Portuguese envoys. The Mahratta sardars had with them 50 horsemen, one  elephant and 150 armed men. A reception was given to them in the residence of the Jesuits.  The same evening, the Portuguese returned to Goa.


The next day on March 12, they met Sardar Vyankatrao in his tent at Rai. Two chairs were placed in the tent for the Portuguese envoys. Near them sat Vyankatrao, Dadajirao and Sambhaji Shinde. On a bench nearby Sayaji Gujar and Manaji Paigude had their seats  allocated. On the same bench Govindpant Thakur and Mahadaji Shenvi on one side and Venkati Kamat and Upya Kamat were given seats. On either side of the envoys, the interpreters and others from their retinue stood up. In this initial interview, representatives of both sides made short speeches after which the Portuguese envoys appealed for a truce. Vyankatrao agreed to one day’s truce and the Portuguese envoys left.


After three days, a message was sent to the Portuguese envoys by Vyankatrao that a  trusted Portuguese representative and an interpreter should see him. Accordingly Bhagoon Kamat Vagh, Joao Lobo, Vyankati Kamat and Babulya Shenvi Sukhtanker called upon Vyankatrao. Govindpant Thakur told them that Bajirao was an enemy of the Portuguese and  he had humbled the Moghul by his military power. The Moghul Empire included also Adilshahi  and Nizamshahi. The Portuguese had usurped the territory that they had in their possession  from Bijapur Adilshahi. Bajirao had already conquered Thana, Bassein as well as Salcete and Bardez. Only Goa had remained to be taken and he could do so without much effort. After  saying all this Govindpant Thakur informed the Portuguese representatives that there was no  hope for the Portuguese to regain any of the conquered territory and added that if the  Portuguese wanted to keep the Goa island with them they should payp the balance of 60  years in gold at the rate of three khandis a year which they had agreed to pay Chhatrapati Sambhaji. Besides they must also allow the Hindus in Goa to build temples. The Inquisition  should have no authority over them and the Shendi cess should be abolished.159


In reply, Joao Lobo, the Portuguese representative said that Salcete and Bardez were  not usurped but were presented to the Portuguese King by Mealkhan. Govindpant retorted  that the Portuguese had deceived Bijapur and in the same way put Bahadurshah to death by  unfaithful conduct at Bassein and that is why the place was known after his name as  Bahadurpura. Vyankati Kamat said that there was no written documentary proof about the  Portuguese having agreed to give three Khandis of gold every year to Sambhaji. Next day,  Govindpant Thakur wrote out the conditions of peace and handed over to Bhagoon Vagh, the  interpreter. The Portuguese envoy, Alcaçova was amazed to see the Portuguese translation  of the conditions but said nothing.


Vagh wrote, “Two Portuguese envoys met Sardar Dadajirao accompanied by Upya  Kamat. I do not know what transpired between them. But one day, Dadajirao sent word to  the envoys that they should see him.160 A copy of the letter that Viceroy Conde de Sandomele  wrote to Dadajirao on March 11, 1739 is in Goa Archives. It says “Although Bajirao wants to  take Portuguese territory, Mahadaji Vithal has told us that Dadajirao wants to maintain peace  and so I have sent Antonio Carneiro de Alcaçova for discussing terms of the treaty.”161 The  other Portuguese envoy Jose Pedro Emaous fell ill but Alcaçova continued the talks. He met  Dadaji and carried on discussion with Mahadaji Shenvi. Mahadaji wrote down his conditions and gave the paper to Alcaçova.


The Portuguese envoy sent both the documents of conditions, one from Govindpant  Thakur and the other from Mahadaji Shenvi to the Viceroy on March 18, 1739 and  consideration was given to them in the meeting of the State Council on March 23, 1739.162 This meeting decided that though the text of the treaty speaks of a treaty between Bajirao and  the Viceroy, Bajirao was a servant of Chhatrapati Shahu and so the treaty should be between  Shahu and the Viceroy or Bajirao as the authorised agent of Shahu and the Viceroy, because even the treaty of 1722 was made under the authority of Shahu.163 But the Portuguese Viceroy  soon learnt the high position and authority of Bajirao.


Shivaji Devji, a close friend of Naroram Mantri reached Goa as from Chhatrapati Shahu  on March 27, 1739. He brought letters to the Viceroy and asked the Viceroy to send envoys to  Satara. Shivaji Deoji also brought an order from Shahu on Vyankatrao asking him to postpone  fighting but the Viceroy knew that it was of no avail. In a manuscript purporting to be an  account of Bajirao’s invasion of Goa, it is said, “Everyone knows that Bajirao does not carry  out the orders of Shahu and his Sardars Vyankatrao and Dadajirao are so indifferent to Shahu’s name appearing in the treaty document. So they will not attach any importance to  the Chhatrapati’s order.”164


Even while knowing what the effect of Shahu’s order would be, the Viceroy respectfully sent Shivaji Deoji to the Mahratta camp in Salçete. The report referred to above  says that though Shivaji Deoji was not given the right reception, the Chhatrapati’s letter was  useful to a certain extent and the Portuguese envoy was not detained by Vyankatrao till the treaty was signed. Being aware of the true situation, the Portuguese statesmen did not think  it fit to run to Shahu for a treaty. So they took much time to send a reply to Shahu with Shivaji  Deoji who had come from Satara and wanted to return without delay. In this connection  Shivaji Deoji writes to the Secretary to the Viceroy on 6 April, 1739 that it was 25 days since he  left Satara and eleven since he reached Goa. He was asked to return post-haste. Even after  two meetings nothing seemed to result. He could not stay longer.


If the Chhatrapati had any idea that such would be the state of things, he would not  have sent him at all to Goa.


It is obvious from a letter written by Dadajirao on April 14, 1739 that Raitur was about  to fall to the Mahrattas.165 The Portuguese also knew that the Mahrattas would easily take it.  The Goa Government was anxious to make a treaty before that happened. One of the  conditions made by Govindpant Thakur was that Hindus in Portuguese territory should have  the same religious freedom that they had in Savantvadi and no shendi cess should be levied  on them. Even among the conditions of Mahadaji Shenvi the condition of religious freedom  and exemption from the authority of the Inquisition was there. On 2 April, 1739, Mahadaji  Shenvi presented fresh conditions on behalf of Vyankatrao and Dadajirao to the Portuguese  envoys.166 Even these fresh conditions contained these old conditions regarding religious  freedom. But the Portuguese made clear that the Viceroy had no power to meddle with the  existing religious practices and so those conditions were beyond discussion.


The shendi cess was imposed on the Hindus by the Portuguese from the beginning of  1705 like the Jijiya imposed by the Moghuls. On 14 August, 1732 it was decided that not only  the Hindus, but all non-Christians should pay that levy. The income from this tax was about  7,000 asurpis. It has already been pointed out that the Inquisition not only exercised authority  on the Catholics but even the Hindus had to suffer much persecution from it. At last,  conceding the Portuguese say on this point, Vyankatrao and Dadajirao concluded a treaty  with Portuguese envoys on behalf of Bajirao on 2 May, 1739. This treaty does not mention Chhatrapati Shahu’s name anywhere.

It was agreed that seven lakh rupees should be paid by the Portuguese towards  expenses of the Mahratta army camping in Goa. As soon as the treaty was duly signed and impressed, two respectable Portuguese should come with the first instalment of two lakhs to  the Mahratta camp, after which the army in Bardez should depart. Until the second instalment of three lakhs, to be paid within a week was actually paid, two Portuguese men should be  detained as hostages in the camp. This might be in the form of cash, gold and flannel. The  balance of two lakhs should be paid afterwards, but till the payment was made two Portuguese should remain as security with the Mahrattas. The author found this treaty in Goa  Archives which he has already published in Portuguese e Maratas as supplement to part Ⅳ.169


Although the Portuguese were to pay Rs. 7 lakhs, it was secretly agreed that Rs. one  lakh in addition should be paid to Mahratta sardars. Dadajirao had taken care that it should be an underhand deal.170 So it would be improper to call it state expenditure. While fixing this  tribute of Rs. 8 lakhs, the talks that were carried on by the Mahrattas and the Portuguese have been narrat by Bhagoon Kamat. He says, “After the preliminary conversation was over, Vyankati Kamat and Upya Kamat said that the amount of money must be settled. Envoy  Alcoçova said that he had accepted a ring of fraternity from Dadajirao; so he should name the  figure in view of Goa’s condition. Dadaji mentioned eleven lakhs. Vagh said that it was a little  too much. At last Vyankati Kamat, Upya Kamat, Babulya Shenvi and Mahadaji Shenvi went  aside, discussed among themselves in a low tone and decided that Rs. 7 lakhs should be  given by the Portuguese openly and Rs. one lakh clandestinely. The sum was written in Marathi (Hindavi) language on paper. The interpreter translated all that in Portuguese and  envoy Alcaçova said that he would communicate the proceedings to the Viceroy.


On May 2, 1739 another draft treaty was prepared. Its Portuguese version is in Goa  Archives and the Marathi version has been published by Krishnaji Purandare from the  Purandare daftar. It is also published in Y. N. Kelkar’s Vasaichi Mohim. Two principal conditions in it are : (1) Forty per cent of the revenue from Salcete and Bardez should be  given to Bajirao by the Portuguese (2) Khorjuve and Panale should be returned to Bhonsla Savant by the Portuguese. Bhonsla should stop paying to the Portuguese one thousand  asurpis according to the pact made through Siva Bhat.


On 6 May, 1739, Vyankatrao and Dadajirao made an independent in regard to Bassein  with treaty Alcaçova and Jose Pedro Emaons. This has been produced in Portuguese e  Maratas and by Y. N. Kelkar in Vasaichi Mohim. The manuscript Successos da India no  Governo do Conde de Sandomele says that the Portuguese had to pay a penalty of Rs. 50,000 for their fraternising with Dadajirao. In the report made by Bhagoon Kamat Vagh, a  Portuguese version of the receipt of Rs. 50,000 that Dadajirao took is available for perusal.

As a matter of fact, it was the Hindu merchants of Goa who were compelled to pay  this fine under compulsion for the most part.172 The Portuguese raised with very great difficulty  Rs. 2 lakhs towards the first instalment of the tribute for paying to Vyankatrao and Dadajirao.  The army in Salcete and Bardez ought to have decamped thereafter. But that did not happen.  The Bhonsla-Savant did not approve of the treaty made by Vyankatrao and Dadaji and kept  his army in Bardez. Vyankatrao withdrew his army from Salcete on May 21 and the siege of  Raitur had already been evacuated.


The Mahratta army for the most part went up the ghauts. Vyankatrao camped at  Sanguem with a small army, where he received Chimaji Appa’s letter of having captured  Bassein. So Vyankatrao went home. Before leaving Goa, he made arrangements regarding  the forts in Sanguem, Ponda and Usgaon. Dadaji was camping in Cuncolim. He tried in  person to persuade Bhonsla-Savant to evacuate Bardez in accordance with the treaty of Rai  but he failed. So Dadajirao returned the two Portuguese men who were kept as sureties to  Alcaçova after meeting him at Pilgaon, near Bicholim. He gave orders for taking some money  from Alcaçova and return it to the Portuguese. On July 19, 1739, the Mahrattas handed over  Margao fort to the Portuguese. As soon as the Mahrattas left, the Portuguese demolished the  fort.173 The Mahrattas did not give up Cuncolim village and fort and Asolnem under orders of  Bajirao.


The Viceroy had sent Santu Shenvi Dangi, a Goan disciple of Brahmendra Swami to  Satara with Shivaji Deoji who had come as Shahu’s emissary. He realised there that it was not  possible to succeed in treaty talks in Satara Court against the wishes of Bajirao.174 So Santu  Shenvi went to Poona and met Bajirao. Bajirao said that he was ready to make a treaty and  sent a letter to the Viceroy with Santu Shenvi Dangi in which he claimed 40 per cent of the  Salcete revenue and Daman and Cheul fortresses.175


Chhatrapati Sambhaji was incensed to see that Bajirao had found a foothold in Goa’s  Salçete and Ponda Panchmahal and insisted that Bajirao should give up their possession.176 The author found a number of letters in the Goa Archives in this connection and he has  extracted some of them in Portuguese e Maratas, Assentos do Conselho do Estado (Part Ⅴ)  and Agentes da Diplomacia Portuguesa na India. In Assentos he has even published a  photostat copy of one of them. Sambhaji’s policy can well be understood from these.


In a letter sent at the end of 1739 by Sambhaji to the Viceroy in which he himself has complained that although Bajirao invaded Salçete and Bardez and gave Goa so much trouble, the Viceroy did not write about it to Sambhaji. Although Bajirao had told him (Sambhaji) that  he would take good care of Ponda and serve him (Sambhaji), he had no intention of taking his service but to keep it with Goa and in order that Bajirao’s botheration should stop



thereafter, Hindurao Ghorpade was being sent with an army. He (Sambhaji) was determined  to keep Goa with the Portuguese as before.177


On November 4, 1739, Sambhaji wrote to Vyankati Kamat and Upya Kamat to the  same effect viz. that Hindurao Ghorpade was being sent to Ponda and that Sambhaji was at  Maraz for the time being and would soon be going to Goa. He had informed the Viceroy also  about it and details were given to Ramchandra Babaji. Hindurao Ghorpade was maternal  uncle of the wife of Nagu Savant Bhonsala who was on friendly terms with the Portuguese to  such an extent that he had informed the Portuguese that he would fight on their side with the  Peshwa during Vyankatrao’s invasion of Salcete178 As from several other Mahratta Sardars,  the Portuguese used to receive information about the Mahrattas from Nagu Savant also. In a  letter written at the beginning of February 1739 to the Viceroy of Goa, Nagu Savant pledged  complete loyalty and friendship to the Portuguese because he said it was traditional. He  expressed his condolence for events in Salcete. He pointed out that the intent of the  Mahrattas was to capture all Northern territory from the Portuguese. He referred to  Hindurao’s arrival in Goa and offered military help to Goa in consort with him. He also said in  the letter that about 2000 Mussalman soldiers could be recruited.


Not only the court of Chhatrapati Sambhaji but even some Sardars of Chhatrapati  Shahu’s Court like Naroram Mantri, Ramkrishna Chimaji and others were favourably inclined  towards the Portuguese. Ramkrishna Chimaji had informed the Portuguese that if they  resolutely resisted the Mahrattas, they would have a winning counter at the treaty talks. In a  letter he said that the Portuguese should hold out with determination so that people like him  would be in a strong position to speak in their favour at Shahu’s court.179 Even Shahu himself felt that Goa should remain with the Portuguese.180


Sambhaji wanted the help of the Portuguese to take Ponda from Bajirao, but the  Viceroy considered that to keep Ponda with Sambhaji was as dangerous to Goa as to keep it  with Shahu and so he offered the help of only some ammunition to Sambhaji and nothing  more according to a Portuguese report.181 It has already been mentioned that Bhonsala


Savant was not prepared to accept the treaty made between Vyankatrao and Dadajirao on  the one hand and the Portuguese on the other at Rai.


At the beginning of Vyankatrao’s invasion of Goa, Bhonsala- Savant was on friendly  terms with the Portuguese. His Karbhari kept himself in touch with the Portuguese through correspondence. Even in the midst of the battle, he wrote to the Viceroy and those letters are  in Goa Archives. Jairam Savant Bhonsala and Ramchandra Savant Bhonsala Sardesai, in a  letter to the Viceroy dated April 13, 1739 say that the Portuguese were traditional friends. The  Savant took Bardez in order to preserve it for the Portuguese without the help of the



Mahrattas. He did not differentiate between his control and Portuguese control and the Portuguese should understand for certain that Bardez would not be given to the Mahrattas. He then asked for expenses of the army to be paid and assured that Bardez would be kept  with him only until Vyankatrao went up the ghauts and then made over to the Portuguese.182


On behalf of the Bhonsala-Savant, Deoba Shenvi Sabnis, Jivaji Shenvi Sabnis, Yesu  Shenvi Havaldar and Jivaji Pundalik informed the Viceroy that the aggression of the Peshwa  on Portuguese territory was not acceptable to them and they were waiting for the departure of  the Mahrattas from there.183 Consideration was given to the points raised by the Bhonsla


Savant in the treaty made at Rai between Vyankatrao and the Portuguese. But Jairam Savant  Bhonsala and Ramchandra Savant Bhonsala planned to make an independent treaty with the  Portuguese on his own points. Accordingly be mentioned two fresh conditions in the letter he  sent to the Viceroy.184 They were : the point of religious freedom for Hindus should be  conceded if it is not already there in the treaty made with Vyankatrao and cash for expenditure  should be given. The Portuguese accepted neither of the conditions.


On 27, December 1739, Nago Savant Bhonsala appeared all of a sudden in the morning at Narve with 350 horsemen and 1000 footmen.185 It was agreed between the  Portuguese and Nagu Savant that they should pay him 20,000 asurpis and he should stay in  one of the villages near Bicholim with 4,000 soliders, because the Portuguese intended to  give him the gadi of Savantvadi. But it was not possible for Nagu Savant to hold his own  against the 4,000 soldiers of Ramchandra Savant and Jairam Savant. In the meanwhile the Portuguese learnt that Naroram Mantri was arriving from Miraj at Kavle to pay his respects to  his family deity. He was accompanied by 500 horsemen, 800 footmen, 1000 oxen and some  camels to carry their luggage. The Portuguese have recorded that there were three elephants and six palanquins for the family.


Naroram came to Bicholim from Savantvadi. Jairam and Ramchandra Savant  accompanied him as far as there. Naroram sent some of his soliders to fight Nagu Savant on  their request. Naroram’s and Nagu’s men had a skirmish for a day and a half at Narve. The  Portuguese and Naroram intervened and Nagu Savant was allowed to depart with his men.  He started for the ghaut on March 7.186 After Naroram reached Kavle, the Viceroy sent Pedro  de Geddis de Magaleice on 12 January 1740 with presents to see him.187 Afterwards Vithoji  Shenvi Dhume, a Saraswat merchant was appointed in place of Magaleice to carry on treaty  talks. Bhagoon Kamat Vagh and Shivaji Desai also were sent with Dhume to Kavle.


Although Naroram was favourably inclined towards the Portuguese he was not  prepared to help them against the wishes of Bajirao. In this connection, the Viceroy, in his  letter to the King of Portugal on February 9, 1740 says, “Since everybody is aware of the



importance of Bajirao, no project can reach its fruition without the consent of Bajirao, or  against his wishes.”188 Naroram went to Bicholim from Kavle. On 3 February, 1740 he learnt there that the Angria had captured two palas and two galias of the Portuguese and decided  that the times were against the Portuguese and so it was not advisable for him to use his  good offices in their favour and went home.189 After Naroram Mantri left for Satara, the Viceroy sent Vithoji Shenvi Dhume and Bhagoon Kamat Vagh to Bhonsala-Savants (Jairam and  Ramchandra) and entered into a treaty with them at Bicholim on 28 February, 1740. The  Portuguese did not take into consideration the question of religious freedom for Hindus even on this occasion. In terms of this treaty, Bhonsala-Savant ceded Bardez and Panalem to the  Portuguese and the Portuguese gave him Khorjuvem and Peerna.


On 12, March the Portuguese took possession of Bardez. It is needless to say that  they had to grease the palms of Naroram Mantri for the help he gave. Naroram even  volunteered to work as Agent of the Portuguese at the court of Shahu, but the Viceroy had  fully realised that nothing could be of avail to them against Bajirao’s wishes. Viceroy Conde de  Sandomele was trying through the Governor of Bombay that the Mahrattas should give up  Cuncolim and Assolanem in Salcete. The reply that Bajirao gave in connection with the treaty  for that purpose was received in Goa on 30, January 1740. Three out of the twelve points  made by Bajirao in his letter to the Governor of Bombay were : (1) The forts of Revdanda and  Korlai should be given as agreed before (2) The Portuguese should aid the Mahrattas in the  event of a conflict with the Angria (3) Mahrashtradharma should be freely followed by Hindus  in Salcete, Bardez and Goa. While negotiations for a treaty with Bajirao were in progress, the  Subedar of the Mahrattas at Ponda sent an army under the command of Haripant in Salçete  with 500 horsemen and 600 footmen and pluhdered it with a view to recovering 40 per cent of  the revenue. In order that there should be no more promiscuous plundering, the leading men  in Salcete entered into an agreement with the Mahrattas to pay up 40,000 asurpis in four instalments. This was done without the permission of the Portuguese Government but the  Viceroy wrote on 30 March, 1740 that he had to overtook that irregularity, even though Bajirao  had agreed that since treaty negotiations were in progress he would not send his army to that  side.190 Bajirao died on May 9, 1740, Vaishakh, Shuddha 13, Sunday, Shake 1662.


After the death of Bajirao, a treaty was made between his son Balaji Bajirao alias Nanasaheb and the Portuguese at Poona on 18, September 1740. Don Francisco Baurot de Galenflux on behalf of the Viceroy and Captain Inchbird on behalf of the Governor of Bombay  were present on the occasion. Captain Inchbird had carried on talks for a treaty on behalf of  the Governor of Bombay in favour of the Portuguese. With reference to that, the Governor of Bombay wrote to the Viceroy at Goa that, “The Mahrattas were so puffed up with pride that  while talking to the Captain they spoke in terms of only rooting out the Portuguese from  Goa.”191 The Bhonsla-Savant had sent Narba Shenvi Chitnis on his behalf to participate in the


CONTENTStreaty negotiations. This treaty was published by Parasnis in his Taha va Kararmadar on  pages 30-32 which contained some minor errors. After making due corrections, the author  published it again on the basis of the original in Goa Archives.192


Even in this treaty there is no reference to the religious question of Hindus in Salcete,  Bardez and Goa, even when Chimaji Appa and other Mahratta statesmen were well aware of  what persecution the Hindus had to suffer at the hands of the Portuguese.193 But the  Portuguese were very firm on this point. The Portuguese Viceroy has said, “No one has any  right to speak on this point in the territory of the Portuguese in India. This right is enjoyed only  by the King of Portugal. Besides, it can scarcely be said that Hindus in Goa, Salcete and  Bardez are not happy. Because Portuguese laws apply only to those Hindus who live in their  territory. No one compels the Hindus to live in their state. They live there in peace because of  the conveniences and concessions they get for their trade, commerce and business.”.


From one letter of the Viceroy, it has to be gathered that the Subject of religious  freedom for Hindus did not find place in the treaty because Chimaji Appa and members of the  Peshwa Court did not care very much about it.195 Viceroy Conde de Sandomele writes as  follows to the Governor of Bombay on 11, May 1740 : “It does not appear likely that the  Mahrattas will lay much stress on the point of religious freedom for Hindus in Goa. Last year,  Vyankatrao did not include any clause in the treaty he made with us. Even the draft treaty that  Bajirao sent with Santu Shenvi Dangi did not contain a word about it. Naroram in his talks with  us never mentioned it. Bajirao and Chimaji mentioned it during the treaty negotiations with  Bhonsala-Savant but neglected it in the end. Taking into consideration this experience, I do  not think the Mahrattas will object to the treaty on this point, when it is of such immense advantage to them otherwise.”196


In terms of this treaty, the Portuguese got a remission of Rs. 5 lakhs. Similarly, the 40  per cent of the revenue which was to be paid to the Mahrattas from Salcete and Bardez  according to the last treaty was remitted to the Portuguese. The Viceroy said that what was  very important was that as a result of these concessions the Vahivatdars of the Mahrattas  were prohibited to enter Bardez and Salcete. Cuncolim and Assolanem were returned to the  Portuguese. The Mahrattas got Revdanda and Korlai (Morro) instead. Besides the Mahrattas  handed over one pargana below the fortress of Daman for its upkeep to the Portuguese.  When the Portuguese envoy said that the income of one pargana should not be enough for  the maintenance of Daman, Chimaji Appa retorted, ‘I really wished like Bajirao to turn the  Portuguese out of India. But I have not done so only to oblige the English.”197


There is one more important clause in this treaty. It is to the effect that in the event of  a conflict with the Angria, the Portuguese should aid the Mahrattas with their armada. It was



the policy of Bajirao, Chimaji and Nanasaheb to break the Angria and make him their  subordinate. For this they needed the help of the Portuguese. Their policy also was to humble  the Portuguese and recover tribute from them and the Angria had realised that for this  purpose they wanted to subordinate the Angria to the Mahrattas. Manaji Angria tried hard to  prevent the Portuguese from handing over Revdanda and Korlai to the Mahrattas. He had  even written to the Viceroy that if the Portuguese kept the forts with them, he would bear the  expenditure for their maintenance.198


Through the mediation of Captain Inchbird, the Mahrattas handed over Cuncolim and Assolnem to the Portuguese on 25 November, 1740.199 In exchange, the Portuguese handed  over Revdanda, Cheul and Korlai (Morro de Cheul) to the Mahrattas. The island of Uran (Karanja) was already taken by Manaji with the help of local Hindus on March 21, 1739.200 Dr.  S. N. Sen has written that the Peshwa took Revdanda (Cheul) and Korlai (Morro) in  September 1740 in his possession.201 Riyasatkar Sardesai also has said so.202 But  contemporary Portuguese papers show that both the forts were not in the Peshwa’s hands  before December 5 or 6 of 1740.203 In the Adhikari Shakavali published in Angre Kalina  Ashtagar (p. 17) it is said that the flag of Chimaji Ballal was unfurled on Revdanda and Korlai  forts on 19 December, 1740.


When the Portuguese went to Cuncolim to take possession of the Cuncolim fort from  its Captain Ramaji Pandit, the army of Chhatrapati Sambhaji of Kolhapur had besieged  Mardangad. Naro Chimaji was the Subedar of this fort appointed by Bajirao. A translation in  Portuguese of a letter as well as the original written on 27 November, 1740 by Naro Chimnaji is  available. He writes therein that the army of the enemy i.e. Sambhaji of Kolhapur had come  but on learning that Bajirao had come to Kittur with 10,000 army, it fled away. He then asked  for the arms and luggage in Cuncolim and armada at Assolnem should be properly preserved  for taking away when convenient. He has also asked for the receipt of Cuncolim fort having  been handed over. From the tone of this letter it would appear that the Subedar of Ponda was  on friendly terms with the Portuguese. But the Portuguese really desired that it should pass  on to the Prince of Saunde, because the Peshwa as neighbour was considered dangerous by  the Portuguese.


It would be appropriate to say a word about Vyankati Kamat. This Hindu merchant  took much trouble for a treaty on behalf of the Portuguese. Even then the Viceroy detained  him in Mormugao fort and ordered him to pay Rs. 10,000 within ten days for the war fund and  he was informed that he would be held guilty of sedition and treated accordingly if he did not  pay up.204

The meaning is that after the padres came to Bassein, they  demolished temples of Hindus and mosques of Mussalmans. They deemed it a great calamity. The padres do not allow them to  observe their holy days in any way.
92) Some Catholic historians say that there was no compulsory proselytisation in Goa or Bassein but contemporary documents  can be cited to the contrary. Cunha Rivara, Padre Silva Rego, Padre Wicki and other Catholic historians have published quite  many documents. The author has also written much about this. In 1561, Catholics of different schools gathered together in the

Viceroy’s residence and expressed the view that compulsory proselytisation was not irreligious. (Rego, Documentacao Ⅷ, p.  301-302. Wicki Documentacao Ⅴ. P. 67).

118) Unsuccessful attempts were even made in order to keep the trade in Goa chiefly in Christian hands by legislation.
119) In 1745, Padre Sebastiao Rego has said, : “Nao necessitando pois Goa dos gentios, estes sao os que mais necessitam de  Goa…
O que tudo e tao certo, que se S. Magestade or denasse, que aquelles que nao professassem a lei de Christo nao  morassem nos seus dominios, em breve tempo todo este gentilismo se reduziria as gremio da igreja…
O que se praticou ja em Hespanha e Portugal com os mouros e judeus e em outras partes do christianismo, onde se  nao permitte domicilio firme aos infieis. “(Lisboa 1759)”.
The gist of this is that Goa does not need Hindus. It is the Hindus who need Goa. As a matter of fact had the King of  Portugal promulgated an order that those who were not Christians should not live in this state, all Hindus would have embraced  Christianity in a short while. It was so done in the case of Mussalmans and Jews in Spain, Portuugal and other Christian States.  No non-Christian is allowed to live there permanently.)
The Chief of the San Tomas Catholic Monastery informed Government on 10 January 1728, that : “O meu parecer …  era uzar S.
