## FOREWORD
The State Board for Literature and Culture (Sahitya Sanskriti Mandal) has been set up  by the Government of Maharashtra for the modernisation of the Marathi language and  literature and for encouraging research and publication with a view to protecting the rich  heritage Maharashtra has in the fields of literature, history, culture and fine arts. To attain this  objective, the State Board has undertaken a manifold programme of literary activities, one of these being to initiate, assist or undertake schemes for editing, translating and publishing in  Marathi, relevant important published or unpublished source material which will have a direct  or indirect bearing on the history and culture of Maharashtra. The Board has also the scheme  for the preparation and publication of the socio-political, cultural and literary history of  Maharashtra.

The Board has made a valuable contribution in this direction by publishing a few  important books, as its own publications. Professor N. R. Phatak’s translation of “Rise of the Maratha Power” by the late Justice M. G. Ranade, “Raigadachi Jeevankatha” by the  late Professor S. V. Avalaskar, “Portuguese Source Papers” relating to Maratha History,  Volume 3 translated by Shri S. S. Desai, from the original Portuguese collections, “A History  of Maratha Navy and Merchantships” by Dr. B. K. Apte, and “History and Inscriptions of the  Satavahanas and the Western Kshatrapas” by Dr. V. V. Mirashi are amongst such books.  The Board has a plan of writing a comprehensive history of Maharashtra and also what may  be called, the peoples’ history of Maharashtra. It has also undertaken the scheme for  translation and publication of records relating to Mahratta History and available only in  Portuguese, French, Urdu, Persian and the Rajasthani languages.

Since it is one of the objects of the Board to encourage writing history of Maharashtra  and collect necessary material for the writing of such a history, it had requested Shri T. V.  Parvate to translate Dr. P. S. Pisurlekar’s Marathi book “Portuguese-Mahratta Relations”  (original by published by the University of Poona, in 1967). Shri Parvate is a journalist of  eminence and an author of several important books in English and Marathi. This translation is of unique importance in the sense that it is based on original Portuguese and Mahratta  sources and gives an entire picture of the relations between the Portuguese and the  Mahrattas. We are sure that the book will be of great use to the scholars of history. The Board  has great pleasure in releasing this volume.

## TRANSLATOR’S THANKS-GIVING
It is one of the highly prized delights of my life that I was able to translate Dr. P. S.  Pissurlencar’s Portuguese-Mahratta Relations from Marathi into English to the satisfaction of  that eminent history research scholar. This translation has been awaiting publication by one  publisher or other for the last over fifteen years. I am not unhappy that all these publishers  were unable to bring it out for one reason or another, because I am firmly convinced that no  worthier publisher that the Maharashtra State Board for Literature and Culture, could be  found for a book of this kind. As the sub-title of Dr. Pissurlencar’s original Marathi book  explains, it is the history of the Mahrattas as found recorded in the Portuguese archives  covering 450 years.

Dr. Pissurlencar’s qualifications for this were unequalled. He was Director of the Goa  Archives for over twelve years and Honorary Professor of History and Director of the Historical  Research Centre of the University of Bombay. Besides, he was Honorary D.Litt. of Lisbon  University; Fellow of the Academy of Sciences of Lisbon and Portuguese Academy of History,  Portugal; Sir Jadunath Sarkar Gold Medallist of the Royal Asiatic Society of Bengal and  Campbell Memorial Gold Medallist of the Royal Asiatic Society of Bombay. When Dr.  Pissurlencar asked me to do this translation he really did me a great honour and I must  acknowledge this favour though it is inevitably posthumous.

It would have been better for all of us, had Dr. Pissurlencar been granted a few more  years of life on this earth, so that he could see in print the English translation of his work  brought out by the Sahitya Sanskriti Mandal of the Maharashtra State, but the Fates willed  otherwise!

## FOREWORD
My friend Dr. Pandurang Sakharam Pissurlencar agreed to deliver a series of lectures  delivered every year under the auspices of the University of Poona in memory of the late Mr.  N. C. Kelkar. Dr. Pissurlencar and myself have known each other for the last forty years. Dr.  Pissurlencar took up service in the Goa Archives under Portuguese rule, when he was quite  young. I was his guest once in those days when he arranged to let me have a good look at the  huge records of the Portuguese Government, carefully preserved and protected behind the  palace of the Governor-General of Portuguese India. I noticed a number of scientific methods  that Dr. Pissurlencar had adopted for the safe and secure preservation of important documents in the records. I saw fifty bound volumes of papers treated by chemical paste in  order to strengthen them and prolong their life. Dr. Pissurlencar was buried day and night in  the study and meditation of those papers. After a mature study of the original sources obtaining in those uncommon records, Dr. Pissurlencar produced his voluminous work in  Portuguese. He dedicated himself entirely to this work. Occasionally he has published stray  articles and original papers in Marathi and read papers in English at learned historical  gatherings. The Panaji records are predominantly full of sources in Portuguese. Records from  the days the Portuguese set their foot on Indian shores are to be found in the Goa Archives.  Europeans such as the English, French, Dutch and Portuguese have carefully put the dates  on their papers and that greatly helps research workers. On the other hand, in our historical records in Marathi, except on the sanads, the dates often are set but not necessarily the year.

This makes the task of determination of dates for the historical research worker, extremely  arduous and not less tortuous and even careful workers land into inexcusable errors. The  superiority of western sources from the view point of determining accuracy of dates is quite  remarkable.

Dr. Pissurlencar has immortalised himself by the invaluable addition he has made to  historical source material by his indefatigable industry and by his irredeemable obligations on  students of history. The Portuguese Government conferred highest honours on him for his  extraordinary achievements. Dr. Pissurlencar had the rare opportunity of studying original  sources in Portugal, France, Italy and England. At the moment he has a rare collection of unpublished source material. He is quite adept in deciphering old Marathi documents in the  Modi script also of which there are not a few in the Goa Archives. Dr. Pissurlencar has spent  the whole of his life in the pursuit of the study of historical source material but his writings have been mostly in Portuguese. Most of our Mahratta research students, not being  acquainted with that language, were denied the benefit of Dr. Pissurlencar’s vast fund of  knowledge. The Portuguese rule has vanished now, but before that happened, the  Portuguese rulers, in appreciation and recognition of Dr. Pissurlencar’s great services had  prepared his bust for being kept in the Directorate of Archives (It has now been kept there). I keenly felt that after Dr. Pissurlencar had retired from service, he should oblige Mahratta research workers by imparting his knowledge to fellow research scholars and research  students. In order at least partially to achieve that objective, I requested him to deliver a series  of lectures on Portuguese-Mahratta relations, when I was Vice-Chancellor of the University of  Poona. Although he was suffering from high blood pressure, he altered his first refusal and  agreed to come when he was well enough to undertake the journey to Poona and stand the  strain of delivering seven lectures and thus did me a great favour. He came to Poona with  prepared lectures, under much physical and mental strain, because the rules of the University make it obligatory on every lecturer to do so.

Our mental experience in the matter of these lectures was very happy indeed. The  curious Poona audience would not be content with his lectures in a closed hall of the  University and so they were arranged on the extensive lawn of the S. P. College and what  was very delightfully welcome was that Dr. Pissurlencar too lost all sense of his physical  weakness and enjoyed being emotionally one with the daily growing audience. He took a  promise from me that I must contribute a foreword when the lectures would be published as a  book. I am happy that I am able to keep the promise and in a way, to redeem the debt of his  obligation of having acceded to my earnest appeal to deliver these lectures.

The book will show that Dr. Pissurlencar has not made a single statement that is no  supported by documentary evidence. This is wholly in consonance with the creed of a  genuine research scholar. Every page in the book, replete with foot-notes, is an evidence of  this. Portuguese names occur with frequency and the book is interspersed with Portuguese  quotations. In order that their accuracy should be assured, Dr. Pissurlencar himself checked  all the proofs. Naturally this took much longer time than expected. I was also responsible for  some delay. Dr. Pissurlencar occasionally feared that he would not see his lectures in print  but we are all blessed with the publication in an agreeable way and I wish Dr. Pissurlencar  success in all his plans and schemes.

Dr. Pissurlencar discussed his subject in seven lectures, which are studded with new  information that was almost unknown to scolars on this side. Besides, its importance is  limitless. Since this information represents the view point of the Portuguese Government, a  very large portion of it could not conceivably be known on this side. In what respects the  Western powers were superior to indigenous powers has been faithfully depicted in this book.  Dr. Pissurlencar has shown that the Portuguse were not only superior to us in armaments but  even in medicine. Even in purely political contests, we have been weaker, disorganised and  divided as can be concluded on the basis of Dr. Pissurlencar’s well-grounded information.  These lectures will show that quite notable Mahratta celebrities did not hesitate to return Bassein to Portugal which was conquered by Chimaji Appa at enormous cost in men and material and perhaps greater valour. Our hearts would be overwhelmed to see that highly  placed princes and potentates and their consorts from Maharashtra conspired with the  Portuguese against their Kith and kin. This book will often open our eyes wide and more often  make us close them with shame. It will provide us with many new details, make us acquainted  with several new names and shed a flood of light on various complicated affairs. In a word,  we will have to modify what we consider standard history and accepted estimates of men and  events. This book has the potentiality to make us write our history anew. It is impossible to  forget the deep debt of obligation under which Dr. Pissurlencar has placed us by throwing  altogether new light on Portuguese-Mahratta relations. That the University of Poona has had  the good fortune and distinctive honour of publishing such a precious volume and while  publishing it, the University did not show any niggardliness in embellishing it with necessary  pictures and maps is certainly creditable to the University. My pleasure for having been the  original cause of this effect is altogether indescribable, because no such well-documented  and full monograph has appeared in any language so far and Dr. Pissurlencar did Marathi  language the honour of writing the same in it. I have not the slightest hesitation in saying that  every lover of Mahratta history and every close student of it must have this volume of Dr.  Pissurlencar in his possession.

## PREFACE BY THE AUTHOR
These lectures were given from March 23, 1964. Of the seven lectures six are  published exactly as they were delivered. Part of the first lecture was delivered when the  second lecture was delivered. At all these lectures, Mahamahopadhyaya Datto Vaman  Potdar, Vice-Chancellor of the University of Poona, was in the chair. I have attempted to deal  with all important events in connection with the Portuguese and the Mahrattas from the days  of Shahaji to Bajirao Ⅱ.

I have dealt with the subject extensively about 25 years ago in my books in Portuguese  such as Portuguese e Maratas, Antigualhas, Assentos etc. and they have been used by such  history research scholars as Sir Jadunath Sarkar, Dr. Surendra Nath Sen, Dr. Balkrishna, Dr.  G. S. Sardesai, Shri D. V. Apte, Prof. Sharma, Dr. Boxer, Dr. Moraes, Shri Y. N. Kelkar and  others. After these books were published the author had access to several manuscripts and  rare books containing new information in Portugal and Paris in particular. These have been  used for the purpose of these lectures.

Before I retired from the service of the Government of Goa, Daman and Diu as Director  of Archives, I had classified the Persian, Marathi and Kannada documents and arranged them  separately. I have in my possession microfilms and copies of the specially important of these  documents. I could see some Marathi papers relating to the 17th and 18th Centuries in  Arquivo Historico Ultramarino, Lisbon, Biblioteca Nacional de Lisboa and Biblioteca da Ajuda.  I have with me microfilms of those documents also. I look forward to publish these documents  with annotations in two or three parts. Preparations are also afoot to publish a revised edition  of Portuguese e Maratas in which use will be made of the notes on the basis of unpublished  material that I made during my stay in Lisbon. I am happy to see the turn that my study of  nearly 50 years of Mahratta history is taking.

The new Gregorian Calendar came into vogue in Bassein Goa and other territories  under Portuguese domination since October, 1583. But in the territories under the British, the  old Julian Calendar held the field till 1752. That leads to difference of ten days before February  1700 and eleven days thereafter. In order to avoid confusion I have given both Portuguese and  English dates according to the new Gregorian Calendar.

I am sincerely obliged to the University of Poona for having asked me to deliver these  lectures. I am also obliged to Shri Potdar for having spared time to contribute a foreword to  this volume. Shri Lakshmanrao Sardesai read the manuscript of the book and made some  alterations regarding syntax. Shri Keshav V. P. Bhembre prepared the press copy and Shri T.  V. Parvate went through the final proofs and made some suggestions for improvement of Marathi diction. I am beholden to all these friends. This book has been printed at the press of  the University and the managers thereof have done a neat job of it.

Lastly I cannot help recalling at this hour that my departed wife often used to feel hurt  that I did most of my writing in Portuguese and did not do any sizable writing in Marathi. She  would have been happy to see a book of this size in Marathi but that was not to be.
