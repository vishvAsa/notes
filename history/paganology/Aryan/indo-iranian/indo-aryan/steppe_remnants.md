## Kurus
> There were people with uniquely Indian admixture operating even in Central Asia around the time of the Aryan transition. This suggests that Indo-Aryan power was actually straddling their steppe base & northern India. I believe the memory of the former is that of the uttara-kuru-s. ... [I] hold that a branch of these steppe kuru-s re-emerged with another allied clan the kamboja much later on the Iranians side to form the elite of the hAkamAnashIya dynasty. - MT

## Massagetae
Tomyris, a legendary female ruler who is said to have reigned for 50 years over the Massagetae kingdom.

> Some ancient sources claim that she led them against Cyrys in the battle he was killed. Other ancients say that he was speared by an Indian elephant warrior while fighting an alliance of the Hindus & Derbikes. Were the Derbikes the same as/or a branch of the Massagetae? The term Massagetae seems to come from a old Iranic cognate of **matsya**. Just like some **kuru-kamboja**-s were left behind on the steppes were some matsya-s too left behind.
