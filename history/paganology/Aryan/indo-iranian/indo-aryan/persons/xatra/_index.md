## Days of the early epics

[![kRRiShNArjuna](http://larryavisbrown.homestead.com/files/arjuna_Krishna_chariot.jpg)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnbJxbUMI8s)


- manu vaisvata, pitR, the likely progenitor of 100M of us R1a carrying Indo Aryans \[[MT](../https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2016/05/08/the-giants-among-the-lilliputs/)\], first king of the solar dynasties, a the great lawgiver and ritualist, who among other things sagely advised wariness towards shUdra-s and mlecCha-s of his time \[[here](../social-cultivation/clan/ethnic-shifts/Arya-invasion/)\].
    - वैवस्वतो मनुर् नाम माननीयो मनीषिणाम्। आसीन् महीक्षिताम् आद्यः प्रणवश् छन्दसाम् इव॥ इति कालिदासः। 
- Others listed in ([SV](https://sites.google.com/site/samskrtamsfo/kavyam/itihasah/vansah/bhargavah)) and allied pages. Especially 
    - [parashu-rAma](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parashurama), the bhArgava revolutionary; and other bhArgava heroes .

## panchajana-wave

- sudAsa (contemporary of purukutsa) of the uttara-pAnchAlas, great grandson of rAjarShi divodAsa (RV mandala 6), who won the 10 king war, much honored in the veda-s.
  - "We come across an interesting account in the mahābhārata, which only mentions the defeat of saṃvaraṇa, the then king of the main hastināpura line at the hands of an unnamed "pañcala king" who went to "conquer the earth" with several akṣauhiṇīs of troops in all directions. The great king of the kurus, the first among equals to be called the "bhāratas"; saṃvaraṇa was defeated & had to flee far west. How far? To the west of the sindhū river! Such was the terrifying vīrapratāpaḥ of one blessed by indra, sudāsa of eternal fame. Now, the sāmaveda's jaiminīya brāhmaṇa speaks of "bhāratas" residing on the west of sindhū river during a difficult time but doesn't mention the name of the king of the bhāratas."
  - He appears in RV 3rd: when his purohita was a vaiśvāmitra ṛṣi and RV 7th: when a vāsiṣṭha ṛṣi is his purohita here (the lore of the vasiShTha-vidveShi verses of vaishvAmitras are pertinent here as per tradition).
- trasadasyu, born to Purukutsa by his wife, Purukutsānī, at a time of great distress, energetic king of the purus settled along the sarasvatI,  a famous sacrificer of ancient times.
- bhIShma, the one of the steadfast vow, who repulsed the attack of the cruel ugrāyudha the pAnchAla (grandson of noble dvimIDhas), who .
- kRShNa, leader of the yadu-s, who likely repulsed the sAlva invasion historically \[[SS](http://www.oocities.org/somasushma/dalbhya.html)\], famously naughty and \*\*violent\*\* as a kid \[[MT](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2005/08/27/the-dark-hero-of-the-yadus/)\], great guide, clever manipulator, the symbol of dharma in action at the social level (his role as a personification of the universe's mockery of silly humans' best plans and dharmas is entirely separate).

## ikShvAku wave

- bhagIratha, whose stupendous determination brought ganga to the earth and pAtAla, liberating his forefathers.
- janaka, knower of brahman, patron of brAhmaNa-s.
- [rAma](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rama), rAjA of ayodhyA, maryAdA-puruShOttama, keeper of the dharma, the symbol of family-consciousness.
    - On his abandonment of sItA: uttarakANDa is probably a a later insert into the epic. Nevertheless, rAma gets criticized in sanskrit literature (eg: kAlidAsa puts regret in rAma's mouth in raghuvaMsha). Also, a fair analysis [here](http://prekshaa.blogspot.com/2010/03/abandoning-of-sita.html?m=1). 
    - Killing the shUdra sage shambuka for the protection of dharma: A simple jAti-tapas dissociation does not fit well with the character who gladly eats fruit soiled by shabarI, who embraces guha the king of niShAda-s.
        - nArada's statement: "“...a man of the lowest caste may not give himself up to penance in the Dwapara Yuga; it is only in the Kali Yuga that the practice of asceticism is permitted to the Shudra caste."  

        - Wiki: "The apologetics[\[7\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shambuka#cite_note-7) firstly argue that not all tapas is done for a pious purpose. [Ravana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ravana "Ravana"), a Brahmin killed by Rama, had also performed penance but not for pious reasons. They argue that Shambuka was killed for conducting penance with a motive of attaining a celestial power with his material body, which is not an unselfish motive for which penance is meant to be performed. It is particularly forbidden (e.g. story of [Trishanku](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trishanku "Trishanku")) in [Hindu mythology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindu_mythology "Hindu mythology") to aspire for entering heaven with a material body. The belief is that the material body, i.e. Annamaya [Kosha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kosha "Kosha"), is mortal and is meant only for performing ones [Karma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karma "Karma") on earth."
- vibhIShaNa, who defected to do the right thing.
- satya-[harIshachandra](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harishchandra), who did not forsake the truth.

## kuru-s among puru-s

- vidura, the dAsI-putra, wise and honest counselor.
- yuyutsu, son of dhRtarAShTra from gAndhArI's vaishya maid, who aided the pANDava-s and the upholding of dharma in their contest against his own kaurava kin.
- vikarNa, the noble kaurava, who like yuyutsu vocally abhorred kaurava adharma, but stayed loyal to family, as is proper.
- shakunI, clever manipulator - one man felled the entire kuru clan.
- karNa, dAna-vIra-shUra, generous king, loyal friend, great warrior.  


## pANDava wave

- bhIma, so filled with kShatra and power, taunted his enemies, exacted his revenge by plucking out the beating heart of duHshAsana and eating it, before dying draupadii's hair with that blood. But more - he knew dharma (and thus counselled and scolded yudhiShThira as necessary). Knowing the difference between greater and lesser dharma, who killed an elephant on his side named ashvatthAman and told droNa of it, draining his will to fight. Who showed great composure at the death of his son, ghaTotkacha {[PS18](https://medium.com/@pranasutra/bhima-vairagya-the-death-of-ghatotkacha-a256b26289d5)}. Of whom madhva said: "भक्तिर्ज्ञानं सवैराग्यं प्रज्ञा मेधा धृतिः स्थिथिः। योगः प्राणो बलं चैव वृकोदर इति स्मृतः॥"
- draupadii pAnchAlI of five husbands, who desired and obtained revenge for her humiliation.
- abhimanyu, the hero who entered and died in a trap.


## yavana (Ionian) invasions:

- kRpA/ cleophis, queen of the ashvaka-s, who fought alexander and forced him to come to more honorable terms, only to be betrayed \[[Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleophis)\].
- chandragupta 1, a shUdra who started the empire with the aid of chANakya, overthrowing the nanda-s and subduing opposition.
    - Not to be confused with Ashoka's descendent of the same name who became a jain muni in karNAtaka (according to some).
- [chANakya](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chanakya) kauTilya, AchArya at takShashIla, author of arthashAstra, who guided chandragupta, checked the yavanas. \[[नीतिः](http://www.indiafacts.co.in/acharya-chanakyas-approach-knowledge/#.VDBkaXVGjUa)।\]
- Khāravela of kalinga, who led a resurgent kalinga, whose annual accomplishments are recorded in [hAtigumpha hill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hathigumpha_inscription), who was gifted in war (beating kings of magadha, tamil country and yavana-ruled punjaab), as well as in the gandharva lore of music and dance, who undertook major waterworks and patronized various spiritual sects.
- pushyamitra-shunga, who put an end to ineffective maurya dynasts and set the stage for a solid imperial renewal. An ancestor of agnimitra of mAlavIkAgnimitra fame.
- vikramAditya, rAjA of ujjayanI, the wise vanquisher of the vEtAla, vanquisher of shakas.
- gautamIputra shAtakarNI shAlivAhana/ [shAtavAhana](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satavahana), vanquisher of shakas, yavanas and pahlavas; he who is said to have created soldiers out of mud and breathed prANa into them (ie inspired and organized ordinary people) after the decimation of warriors.
- kaniShka the kuShAna, mahArajAdhiraja (Emperor of India), Kaisara (for the romans), Kshatriya-tama (for the Persians), and deva-putra (for the Chinese), one of the rare Indian powers who defeated the Chinese and kept them at bay, under whom the kaumAra-shAsana rose in hindu thoughtscape; under whom sogdiana was referred to by the chIna-s as uttarApatha; under whom Indic thought flowed over to central asia. \[[MT](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2005/11/26/chinese-policy-of-kushanas/)\] 

Non-heroes: ashOka chakravartI dEvanAmapriya, who - contrary to legend - did not give up warfare after the kaLinga carnage, who led to a temporary decline in brAhmaNa patronage.  

## Era of invasions of shakas and huNas, consolidations:

[![ajantA](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3f/Ajanta_cave9_2010.jpg/511px-Ajanta_cave9_2010.jpg)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKT-Gaf0cKo)  

- samudragupta parAkramAnka, chakravartin, great conqueror, son of chandra the first major gupta ruler and the lichChavi princess, chosen as successor over his (some elder) brothers, created an expansive kingdom starting from his base in prayAga + pATalIputra, parton of scholars, excellent musician, fine poet, wise king, devotee of viShNu whose standard was the garuDa. This wise vaidika/ tAntrika king included vasubandhu the bauddha among his advisors. He performed the ashvamedha in full splendour. Barbarians such as kushAna-s and shaka-s from far away as Bactria and lanka submitted to him and sought his protection with gifts. He destroyed nAga-s, vAkaTaka-s and gaNa-s such as yaudheya-s and mAlva-s. As a dhArmika conqueror, he defeated and restored kings ranging from kAmarUpa and vanga to kanchi. His conquests probably inspired kAlidAsa.
- chandragupta 2 "vikramAditya", patron of scholars (probably including mahAkavi kAlIdAsa), husband to multiple queens (including a nAga princess). The [gupta empire](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gupta_Empire) patronized universities at nalanda, vikramashIla, ujjainI. Fa Hien tells us his country had no trouble from robbers.
    - According to a fragmentary copy of a play devI-chandragupta by vishAkadatta (which ought to have been based on a tale well known in his times), he came to power by (unknowingly?) killing his jealous elder brother rAmagupta and marrying his dhruvadevI wife who he had earlier rescued from being captured by shaka-s after being surrendered to them by rAmagupta to save his life.
- skandagupta, who defeated the shveta-huNa invaders, whose western wing led by Atilla had recently defeated Romans, had trounced the Persians ([MT](http://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2009/04/02/geopolitics-of-the-tantra-age-an-attempt-at-a-blunt-assessment/)).
- bhadravarman, ruler of champa, reigned from 380CE to 413 CE and Sanskrit inscriptions from his reign show that he had learned the recitation of the vedic saMhitA-s and performed vedic rituals. He calls himself a devotee of rudra, and he celebrated the grace of rudra in securing his victory over the chIna-s by building the glorious temple for shiva termed shrI bhadreshvara. \[[MT](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2007/02/15/the-greatest-temple-of-shiva/)\]
- harShavardhana, parton of art and scholarship, whose big and well governed empire was visited by Xuanzang.
- vikramAditya 2 the chAlukya, who avenged pallava occupation of vAtApi by occupying kanchi without harm to its subjects, and whose son checked the arabs in sindh.
- amOghavarSha nRpatunga the [rAShTrakUTa](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rashtrakuta), who himself produced works in kannaDa and saMskRta, and also patronized other scholars (often under feudatories).
- [rAjEndra chOLa](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajendra_Chola_I), whose vigorous maritime trade with South east asia, China and the Arabs brought prosperity, whose wide conquests (maritime and otherwise) were gentle.
- akkadevI, wise chAlukya queen, under whom brAhmaNa-s prospered, who was called Gunadabedangi, meaning "beauty of virtues"; and "as courageous as Bhairavi in war".
- rudrama-devI (aka rudradeva mahArAja), queen of the kAkatIya-s, who took over the reigns of the kingdom when it was in disarray, led some firmly loyal generals and ministers thwarting rebellions and land+sea invasions by the choLa-s, pANDya-s and yAdava-s, thwarted her husband vIrabhadra the vengi chAlukya prince (cutting him up in a fight but letting him live at one point). She was the grandmother, through her daughter of pratAparudra, her successor.

- [guru tegh bahAdur](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guru_Tegh_Bahadur), hind di chAdar, whose refusal to convert led to his torture and death but supposedly saved many kAshmIri paNDits (tale likely to be false).  

- bandA bairAgI bahAdur, the rAjaputra who took up sannyAsa for inadvertently killing a pregnant deer in violation of the dharmashAstra-s, returned to the sword and gRhasthAshrama propelled by guru govinda-simha (while staunchly retaining his vegetarian vaiShNava base), avenged the guru, withstood torture, saw his one year killed and his liver stuffed into his mouth, refused to convert, and died. He never fully became an "sikh"ularist.  

- bhAI maNI-siMha, who was chopped to death piece by piece for wanting to retain the right to celebrate dIpotsava.
- [raNajIta sIMha](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ranjit_Singh), able ruler, devotee of kAshI vishvanAtha and jagannAtha, on whose [flag](http://p.twimg.com/AstzIq2CAAAybWz.jpg:large) stood kArttikEya \[[F1](../../../images/flags/raNajIta-simha-flag.jpg)\]. Banned azan (muslim call to prayer) and cow slaughter. \[[TW17](https://twitter.com/TrueIndology/status/854214062267396096)\]
- [hari-siMha](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hari_Singh_Nalwa) naLvA, terror to the afghAns ("khamOsh bash haria raghle"), brilliant general, slayer of the tiger.  

- Zoravar siMha the intrepid Dogra general, a kalhuria rAjaputra of the mountains, who solidly conquered Ladhak and Baltistan, repulsed the Tibetans and Chinese, and forced his way in pilgrimage to mAnasasarovara and kailAsa, reached the nepAla border and died fighting Tibetans on his way back ([wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zorawar_Singh_Kahluria)). So honest that "he would transfer to his master any gifts or tribute that came to him."
- To be continued.
