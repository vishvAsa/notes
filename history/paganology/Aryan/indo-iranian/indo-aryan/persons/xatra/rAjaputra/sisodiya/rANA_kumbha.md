By night, he delved deep into rasa & kRSNabhakti; and next morning, he was ready to slaughter mlechChas!
    - Finally killed during adoration of ekalingadeva by his treacherous worthless son udayasimha.
    - Maharana Kumbha is credited with writing the Samgita-raja, the Rasika-priya commentary on the Gitagovinda, the Sudaprabandha, and the Kamaraja-ratisara.
    - Bogus claim: " it also pays homage to the Muslim mercenaries who served in the Ranaâ€™s armies as well as the Muslim subjects who lived in his dominions by having the word Allah carved in Arabic around two stories of the pillar." \[[SW](https://swarajyamag.com/culture/looking-through-broken-glass-rajput-victories-in-indian-history?utm_content=bufferb2459&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer)\]
