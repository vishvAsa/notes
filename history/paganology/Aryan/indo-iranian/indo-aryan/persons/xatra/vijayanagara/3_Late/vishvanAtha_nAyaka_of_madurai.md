([wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viswanatha_Nayak)): His loyalty to the emperor kRShNadevarAya and state exceeded his filial duty and personal ambition. He volunteered to fight and depose his rebellious and greedy father (who was to negate the choLa feudatory invasion of pANDiya madurai). In an epic retelling in "Tanjavuri Andhra Rajula Caritra", kRShNadeva, setting him up as the dakShiNa-simhAsanAdhipati, praises him thus: "If I allow myself to be served by someone as dispassionate and great as you who are like the deva vishvanAtha, I will incur a fault." \[[YT](https://youtu.be/LbY82Py7Lqk?t=2533)\]
