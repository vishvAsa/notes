## kRShNadEva-rAya
[kRShNadEva-rAya](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krishnadevaraya), wise ruler of a powerful vijayanagara empire, patron of scholars and artists, a tuLuva who wrote in telugu, [vanquisher of the turks](http://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2005/10/18/sultans-felled/), who put an end to the bahmani annual jihads while he lived \[[TW](https://twitter.com/i/moments/890055413374173186)\], who won tough victories against the gajapati-s, whose influence stretched unto Lanka to aid against the Portuguese ([M](http://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2009/10/11/vijayanagaran-activities-in-shri-lanka/)).
    - In Amuktamalyada : dharma-centric advice: [img1](http://i.imgur.com/AoPQaJh.png).
        - "One shouldnt employ kShatriya-s as senApati-s or mantrin-s - because their ancestors were once kings, they may usurp the throne. Instead, if one were to employ brAhmaNa-s they will not be tempted thus since they did not have such a past, and because they'll profess not to even want it."
## vishvanAtha nAyaka of madurai
([wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viswanatha_Nayak)): His loyalty to the emperor kRShNadevarAya and state exceeded his filial duty and personal ambition. He volunteered to fight and depose his rebellious and greedy father (who was to negate the choLa feudatory invasion of pANDiya madurai). In an epic retelling in "Tanjavuri Andhra Rajula Caritra", kRShNadeva, setting him up as the dakShiNa-simhAsanAdhipati, praises him thus: "If I allow myself to be served by someone as dispassionate and great as you who are like the deva vishvanAtha, I will incur a fault." \[[YT](https://youtu.be/LbY82Py7Lqk?t=2533)\]

- Installed in place of his borther's sons by nobles considering the dire situation.
