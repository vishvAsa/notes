deputed by Shahaji himself to protect shivAjI, who as a senior nobleman at a crucial juncture (during the Afzal Khan campaign) inspired and convinced all the deshkumkh-s to fight for svarAj rather than buckle towards Adil Shah, played major role in planning and executing battle of pratApgaD against Afzal Khan.
    - "Kanhoji Jedhe went to Rajgad with the firmans received from Afzal Khan and publicly declared that he would relinquish his lands and his earnings to Shivaji but not join Afzal Khan. This simple act of bravery and farsightedness had an electrifying effect : that someone with the experience and seniority of Kanhoji Jedhe was supporting Shivaji meant that Swarajya was an idea they could and should fight for. All defections to Afzal Khan immediately stopped."
