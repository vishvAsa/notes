Why heroes? Stories of heros are often riveting; remembering their stories is an important part of cultivating a self which strives for these qualities when appropriate.

Why heroes from bhArata? We are emotionally (and biologically) attached to this 5000+ year old culture and people; so the inspiration we can draw from them is much stronger.  

Why make a list? Maybe this interests others. Helps organize one's thoughts on the matter, frees up my overly engrossed mind to pursue other interests.
