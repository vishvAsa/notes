Where there are heroes, villains are no surprise. Many were self-professed ghAzis (mujAhids intent on jihAd). Others power hungry people who pursued personal ambition at the cost of higher ideals.

### Various traitor marATha-s:
### Bhim Singh
who was conferred the title Raja Ghorpade Bahadur (Dakkani word for the Varanus lizard) by the Sultan at the behest of minister Gavan and his brother.
  - "The Turks advanced again, and Appaji decided to hold them up using the same tactic of defending from the well-fortified Vishalgad. However, Karan Singh and Bhim Singh were breeders of the Varanus lizard which they used in climbing forts. Accordingly Karan and Bhim decided to help the Moslems in taking the fort, in return for the province of Wai. Karan and Bhim sent out several lizards to scale the precipice on which the fort was located with ropes tied to them. With the aid of these ropes they climbed the fort and sent down rope ladders for more men to follow them. Then they cut their way to the main fort gate and opened it. In the process Karan Singh was killed by the Hindu defenders but the Moslems managed to get in and massacred Appaji and his men. With the fall of Vishalgad, Mahmud Gavan attacked the Chalukyan army by surprise at Samgameshvar." [MT](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2004/04/06/war-in-the-konkan/)

## Hindu charlatans

These bring the sanAtana dharma to disrepute, even as they deceive feeble hindu-s.

###  Swami Nithyananda

There was a [video](https://www.indiatvnews.com/news/india/new-video-nithyananda-celebrating-father-s-body-16939.html) where he gleefully dances over his father's corpse, then 'liberates' it by stomping on its forehead, gives it diksha post mortem, and declares it a sishya-turned-sanyasi.
