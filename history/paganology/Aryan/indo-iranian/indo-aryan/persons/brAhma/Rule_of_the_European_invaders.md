He provided highly refined poetic, Tamil translations of quotes from saMskRta purANas. He was also highly competent in English, using that knowledge to study and master the the durAgama of both the Christians and yahudas. He teamed up with his friend and student who was learning Tamil from him, senthilnAtha iyer and published bibiliya kutsitam (disgusting things in the Bible)"
    - He was so respected that dharmapura AdhInam, who used to pay worship mainly to the caturtha guru parampara and shiva and did not focus much on tirumALigai dEvar (a brAhmaNa and author of one of many books of the shaiva Tamil canon), heeded his gentle reprimand and got proper respects to be offered to dEvar
    - he challenged vaLLalAr, even sued him...and even after he had passed away, he still had great influence. He had managed to create a pool of sufficiently charges orthodox shaivas who managed to prevent vaLLalAr cultists from installing his statues  at mainstream shaivAgama temples

    - gave several public lectures in Chennai to attempt to increase the awareness of Hindus on modern astronomy and the importance of first hand and meticulous observations
        - "discussed the importance of modern astronomy with the ācarya of the Sriperumbudur śrīvaiṣṇava maṭha and convinced him to adopt a modern astronomical almanac, "
        - "demonstrated to his Vedic ritualist friends, Venkateshvara Dikshita and Sundaresha Shrautin, that the astronomical tables of the traditional astronomers of Andhra and Dramiḍa were otiose and that they badly mis-predicted basic astronomical events which are central to Vaidika rituals"
        - "during the solar eclipse of August 18, 1868 RA was able to demonstrate his predictions: He got the eclipse time correct with an error of 12 seconds using calculations done by his hand while the traditional astronomers performed dismally with a whopping 24 minute error. This had a strong effect and many traditional Hindus now switched over to his side. He then demolished the most recalcitrant traditional astronomers in a sadas of brāhmaṇa-s of the Dramiḍa country. Seeing this the Śaṃkara maṭha sent out a circular stating that the Vedic ritualists Venkateshvara Dikshita and Sundaresha Shrautin were correct in adopting modern theory and techniques for their rituals. His efforts were paralleled by those of Ketkar in Maharashtra and Venkatakrishna Raya in Andhra to get the Hindus to use modern astronomical calculations."

In the next stage KarpAtri ji encouraged people to pressurise local boards and municipalities to shut down slaughter houses.

## AchArya Pandurang Vaman Kane
chitpAvana, author of the stunning, expansive "History of the dharmashAstras", whose [autobiography](http://dadegaonkar.blogspot.com/2007/09/p-v-kane-notes-for-biography.html) is in its epilogue.
  - On his motivation via his son at [prexA](https://www.prekshaa.in/reminiscences-pandurang-vaman-kane-part3): "It turns out that long before commencing the writing of the volumes, PVK had a keen interest in all subjects related to Indian culture. He also had a deep understanding of the dharma-shastras and matters related to Indian heritage. He was a master of the Sanskrit language and of his own interest, he had read the Vedas, Upaniṣads, the Epics, the Purāṇas, and other traditional works. But time and again, when PVK would come across the writing of some Western scholar or soi-disant Indologist on the subject of the dharma-śāstra that showed Indian culture in bad light, and his blood would boil. His anger would know no bounds when he came across writers who passed loose comments on the dharma-śāstras or concluded that the Indian mind was uncivilized and nascent. At the dining table, he would express his anguish, “What does this fellow know about India and its heritage to comment this way? Where on earth does he find all these things in our dharma-śāstras? What were people in Europe and the Americas doing when we already had a flourishing civilization in India?” Such constant episodes convinced him that he had to write something to shut the mouths of Western scholars who spewed absolute drivel about our ancient works. He made up his mind. “It is my duty to write this. I shall write about the dharma-śāstra in greater detail so that it will put all confusion to rest.” Doubtless he ended up becoming successful. A needle prick in the beginning sufficed to put the great mind on track to undertake the herculean task of compiling all the dharma-śāstras and its commentaries right from Parāśara, Manu, and Yājñavalkya all the way until the day on which he wrote the specific chapter. This included the judgments passed by Indian courts and the Privy Council."
