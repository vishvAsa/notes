From the scanty biographical details given in the colophon of his commentary on the Ganita section of the Aryabhatiya and from a Malayalam work, Laghuramayanam, we learn that he was a Namputiri of the Garga gotra  and  hailed  from  Silkundapura  or  Srikundagrama  (Malayalam,  Tr-k-kanti-yur)  near  Tirur  in  South Malabar,  a  place  which  in  medieval  times  rose  to  be  an  important  seat  of  Sanskrit  learning,  specially astronomy  and  mathematics.  As  to  his  teachers,  besides  Damodara (son of parameshvara),  he  mentions  another  preceptor,  Ravi, versed in Vedanta. In his Siddhanta-darpana he refers to these two teachers. Of the several works penned by Nilakantha, special mention may be madeof Golasara (Essence of the Sphere), Siddhanta-darpana (Mirror of Astronomy),  Candracchaya-ganita (Computations of the Moon‘s Shadow),  Tantrasangraha  (Collection  of  Astronomical  Works),  and  Aryabhatiya-bhasya  (Commentary  on the  Aryabhatiya).
