## प्रवरः
काश्यप, आवत्सार, आसीत

## प्रजाः
- कद्र्वा नागाः।
- विनतया अरुणः, गरुडश् च।

## अर्वाचीनाः
### कणादः
- propounded the वैशेषिक दर्शन. His system allowed a place for both the वेद (thus making it an आस्तिक दर्शन) & a framework which postulated अनुसिद्धान्त (doctrine of atoms) & natural forces such as gravity. A sample from वैशेषिकसूत्रम्

### व्यासतीर्थः
- From the काश्यपगोत्र, hailed this stalwart of माध्वसिद्धान्त; most well-known for his work, the न्यायामृतम् which offered a powerful critique of शंकर's अद्वैत.

### मधुसूदन-सरस्वती
Springing from काश्यपगोत्र from वङ्गदेश, he mastered नव्यन्याय & अद्वैत. This काश्यप answered the challenge to advaita in न्यायामृत of another काश्यप (व्यासतीर्थ) in his magnum opus, अद्वैतसिद्धि & was also a connoisseur of bhakti with works like भक्तिरसायन.

### गङ्गेशोपाध्यायः
one of the greatest thinkers of भारत from वङ्गदेश; established the नव्यन्याय school, reformulating a brand of logic in a much more complex, sophisticated and rigorous manner; for the old न्याय school was successfully undermined by श्रीहर्श, an आचार्य of अद्वैत.

### मुत्तुस्वामि-दीक्षितः
A true स्मार्त, he composed on शिव/विष्णु/गणेश/स्कन्द/देवी & who not?! But at the depths of his heart, he was a श्रीविद्योपासक. How fitting that he attained mukti while remembering मीनाक्षी?

### विद्यापतिः
from मिथिलदेश, he not only wrote fine love poetry राधा-कृष्ण as a key theme but also wrote instructive texts on धर्म such as दुर्गाभक्तितरङ्गिणी & शैवसर्वस्वसार.

### गणेशो ऽवधानी
