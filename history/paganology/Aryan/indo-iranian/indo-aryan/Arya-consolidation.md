title: 03 Arya consolidation
---


## Spread within India
- From baudhAyana and manu, it is clear that kuru-pAnchAla realm was where major brAhmaNa vedic consolidation happened. Gradually, this culture and its carriers (mainly in the form of brAhmaNa-s) spread elsewhere in India and beyond. {[GA_17](https://twitter.com/GhorAngirasa/status/926791318109429761)}
  - baudhAyana-dharma-sUtra implies that vaidika karma-s can only be conducted in the "madhya-desha", not even in kalinga, vanga, AraTTa, gAndhAra etc.. - going where expiation is required \[[TW](https://twitter.com/GhorAngirasa/status/874755837155082240)\]. Yet, we observe baudhAyana-s and vaidika-s in kerala and TN.
  - "Almost none of the elite definitions: brahmavarta, brahmaRSidesha or madhyadesha. That region is indeed sacred for all Hindus today but there was a time when it was not held in high esteem by the kurupa~ncalas/madhyadeshis. In the baudhAyana shrauta sUtra, right after choosing the priests for his yaj~na, a yajamAna has to "deposit" all evils & illnesses in him in various "safe" places which were deemed suitable for storing those undesirable elements - It starts, "my anger in a lion, hunger in wolf..." & later has "may my bile (excess) settle among ikSvAkus & elephantisis among videhas"!!"
- Also see "Brahmanas → Penetration and Aryanization" note below and the [varNa-theory page](../../varna-theory/) regarding the "crossing the seas" prohibition.  
- "Can estimate that approximately at least 50% of the Y-chromosomes of  varNa populations as a group originated from invading Aryan males." See note on R1a1 in Genetics page.
- Some of the proto-Indian tribal population was incorporated into the fringes of evolving Indo-Aryan society as specialized service communities, while the rest retained their tribal existence with a symbiotic relationship with the Arya-s. The encounter and the with the tribal groups is seen in many different forms in the post-R^igveda texts of the Indo-Aryans.

## Early Arya vs shUdra conflict  
- Arya-s and dAsyu-s/ dAsa-s (mentioned int he Rg-veda) were enemies - differentiated by race(?) and culture. After subjugating the latter, they became shUdra-s in early Aryan society. (PV Kane)
    - Possible connection: Western shaka-s (who recided on the west coast of black sea) referred to themselves as skudra-s \[[SZ](http://www.azargoshnasp.net/history/Scythians/fouroldiranianethnicnames.pdf), [दारयवः](http://i.imgur.com/NOgGytU.png)।\].
- "The post R^igvedic texts allude to the Arya vs shUdra conflict and the brahma+kShatra vs shUdra conflicts. The mAnava dharmashAstra (manu smR^iti) and allied material alludes to the same 2 above-mentioned conflicts. ... Yet it is fairly plain from the manu smR^iti that the shUdra is feared as a danger to brAhmaNa-s. The same is true of the vaguer vedic allusions, where they are a threat to the Aryas or the brahma-kShatra aristocracy. " \[[MT1](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2004/09/01/inter-caste-strife/)\]
    - "It should stated here that this clearly contrasts the situation with the vaishyas. They are after all the “vish (people)” or the laity who function as traders and cultivators and should have the resources to for the brahma-kShatra or brahmin overlord to exploit. Further, given their resources they could actually mobilize a threat to the dominion of the aristocrats. Yet, there is no sense of hostile interactions vis-a-vis the vaishyas in the texts under discussion. They are discussed, variously, as Arya insiders or miscellaneous dvijas using a neutral or common-place terminology. This presents a major contradiction, for why should the brahma-kShatra, who were believed to be in power in Hindu society, fear the lowest group rather than the potential more dangerous vaishyas whom they are believed exploit. This is also in contrast with the generally neutral or positive treatment of the “low caste” trades which may be at the border of vaishya and shudra functions. The texts both vedic and the MDS, consider these trades and their practitioners a necessary feature of society that needs protection. So the sense of threat from the hostile shUdra suggests that term ‘shUdra’ was not merely applied to the lowest caste but actually extended to enemy of the brahmin or the brahma-kShatra alliance." \[[MT1](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2004/09/01/inter-caste-strife/)\]
    - "MDS 10.129 warns that shUdras on acquiring wealth could harass brahmins. Importantly, this is never stated of vaishyas who have the potential to do so. MDS 8.22 warns that a kingdom teeming with shUdra-run courts rapidly degenerates as though over-run by enemies of dvijas. MDS4.60-61 again mentions that the brAhmaNa should avoid residence in a shUdra kingdom, which is described as being over-run with inimical people and having practitioners of fake religions." \[[MT1](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2004/09/01/inter-caste-strife/)\]
    - "The redaction of the ancient law-books, which were in their core kuru-pa~nchala documents (as supported by their definition of Aryavarta=the kuru-pa~nchala realm; the territory of the bhAratas or sometime their feudatories and allies, the yadus and matsyas), seems to have occurred during the maurya, shu~Nga and kANva periods. These redactions were characterized by inclusion of negative references with respect to shudra, a term which specifically subsumed the recent hostile elements that the brahma-kShatra alliance had faced. However, the vedic references suggest that the redactors were not being innovative in this regard. It is clear that there was an ancient hostile sub-text to the shUdra term, as enemies of the Aryas. This parallels the term dAsa, that in ancient sanskrit literature was typically an individual or group hostile to the Aryans, but later also came to mean slave. These terminologies definitely have a link to the subjugation of hostile enemies and their eventual assimilation at the lower social rungs. So in conclusion, I would state that the entire enterprise of searching for a doctrine of oppression in negative statements regarding the shUdras in the MDS and allied texts is a rather misplaced venture. These texts are a product of a certain historical conflicts, where the brahma-kShatra alliance is merely seen to be defending its interests against competitors and threats. Whether, their texts or their interpretations based on misunderstood terminologies were basis of social inequities, which are very natural in primate societies, is highly questionable.  
        " \[[MT1](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2004/09/01/inter-caste-strife/)\]
- People living outside the domain of early Aryan society (south Indians, persians, chinese etc..) were considered fallen kShatriya-s, and now shUdra-s and called dasyu-s; having lost their saMskAra-s. \[[PVK_IMG](http://i.imgur.com/lWjiQD4.jpg), MDS 10.43-45\]
- shUdra-s of early Aryan society had very low status, with their main profession being the service of the dvija-s.
    - BR Ambedkar's summary seems mostly correct : 
        - "for the Shudras of the Indo-Aryan Society are absolutely different in race from the Shudras of the Hindu Society. The Shudras of the Hindu Society are not the racial descendants of the Shudras of the Indo-Aryan Society. This confusion has arisen because of the failure to realise that the meaning of the word 'Shudras' in the Indo-Aryan society is quite different from the meaning it has in the Hindu society. In the Indo-Aryans the word Shudra was proper name of one single people. It was the name of a people who belonged to a particular race. The word Shudra, as used in the Hindu society, is not a proper name at all. It is an epithet for a low uncultured class of people. It is a general cognomen of a miscellaneous and heterogeneous collection of tribes and groups, who have nothing in common except that they happen to be on a lower plane of culture. It is wrong to call them by the name Shudras. They have very little to do with their namesakes of the Aryan society, who had offended the Brahmins."
        - "We do not know exactly whether the Shudras were a tribe, a clan or a moiety or a group of families. But even if they were as big as a tribe, they could not have been larger than a few thousand. The Bharatas are being expressly spoken of in the Rig Veda, vii.33.6, as being small in number."

## Early trends in fluidity
- In the far antiquity, intermarriage among varNa-s must have been permitted.
    - Consider the tale of [satyavatI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satyavati) (when the marriage was proposed, neither bhIShma nor shantanu knew the supposed kShatriya origins of satyavatI).
- Later internal sources view mixing of the varNa-s with scorn.
    - dharmashAstra-s.
    - The famous stance of the bhagavadgItA against varNa-sankara.
- By the time Megasthenes visited, there were already rigid restrictions about intermarriage and avocations. \[[MI](http://www.sdstate.edu/projectsouthasia/upload/Megasthene-Indika.pdf)\]
    - " Such, then, are about the parts into which the body politic in India is divided. No one is allowed to marry out of his own caste, or to exercise any calling or art except his own: for instance, a soldier cannot become a husbandman, or an artizan a philosopher. "
