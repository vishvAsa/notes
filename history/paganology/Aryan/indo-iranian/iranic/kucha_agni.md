"In 615 AD, the 3 Central Asian kingdoms of Kucha, Agni (later Qara Shahar) and Khotan (gosthAna/ oDDiyAna-pITha) were islands of the Indic civilization in the Tarim Basin. They were at the pinnacle of their power and prosperity and were great centers of Sanksritic learning, producing a variety of texts on buddhist and classical hindu philosophies. .. The new king of Kucha, suvarNadeva renewed the non-aggression pact with Tai-tsung, the expansionist Chinese emperor. In all likelihood Hsuen Tsang was also acting as a spy to the emperor and providing him intelligence regarding these Indic Kingdoms. Shortly after Hsuen Tsang passed through this region, Tai-tsung decided to swallow these kingdoms, without much of a warning. ... Thus, the Tarim basin passed from the Indian cultural zone to the yoke of the Chinese. All traces of Indic civilization in this region were subsequently erased with the conquest of this region from the Chinese by the Tibetan hordes, followed by its conquest by the great Uighur Kha’khans of Mongolia." \[[MT1](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2005/11/24/destruction-of-the-4-central-asian-indic-garrisons/)\]

With the help of the internal Sinitic population they engineered a revolt and suddenly appeared at the head of a massive Chinese army of 80,000 to beseige and conqueror the kingdom. First Sheng and there after Yao declared themselves rulers of Khotan. Alarmed at this advance the descendent of lalitAditya, jayAditya, son of saMgrAmapIDa, who ascended the throne in 751 CE, assigned general vijaya vikrama a descendent of the original Hindu royal family of Khotan to wrest it back from the chInas, hUnas and “mlecchas”. ... " The rule of this dynasty continued till ~992, when, isolated, it fell to muslims. {[MT2](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2004/09/17/a-brief-history-of-the-vijayan-rule-of-khotan/)}
