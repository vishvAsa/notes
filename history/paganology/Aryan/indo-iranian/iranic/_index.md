## Invasion
- Population replacement 20-40%

### Radiation to near east
> Haplogroup R1a1a expanded less dramatically after the Ice Age in the Near East, parts of central Asia and northern India. It is found at levels of about 7% in Iraq and Syria, and at similar levels in Turkey. The higher genetic diversity of R1a1a in eastern Turkey and the decrease in frequency from east to west, indicates that R1a1a entered Turkey from the Iranian plateau, probably about 4,000 years ago.
