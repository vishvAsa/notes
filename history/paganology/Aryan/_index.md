## Intro
- Etymology of "Arya": [KE2015](http://koenraadelst.blogspot.com/2015/03/the-indo-european-vedic-and-post-vedic.html).


## Rapid radiation
- They radiated out widely, merged with and dominated prior occupants in vast tracts of Eurasia. \[[Vid2015](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdQwalCPNAs)\]
- Razib ran the 'back of the envelope' using reich lab qpadmin model, i estimate that something like 11% of the ancestry of modern ppl in the whole world can be modeled as 'yamnaya'. about 850 million people if you multiple genome*person

### Eurpoean migration
- [Nat](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v522/n7555/full/nature14317.html), [Arx](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1502.02783.pdf).
- Half of Western European men descended from one Bronze Age ‘king’. "In Western Europe, related lineages within R1b-L11 expanded ~4.8–5.9 kya (Supplementary Fig. 14e), most markedly around 4.8 and 5.5 kya. The earlier of these times, 5.5 kya, is associated with the origin of the Bronze Age Yamnaya culture." \[[N16](http://www.nature.com.ucsf.idm.oclc.org/ng/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/ng.3559.html) [T](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/science/2016/04/25/half-of-british-men-descended-from-one-bronze-age-king/)16 \]
- This resulted in 60-30% population replacement (more in the northeast, least in the southwest)

### Greek waves
- "One of the causes for the end of the Mycenaean civilization is held to be the invasion of another Greek group the Dorians. In Greek epics these invasions are believed to represent the return of the Heracleidai, he descendents of Herakles who set out to conquer Greece from the other rulers. From the historical view point it is interesting to note that the use of the script declined after the Dorian invasion even though the Dorians were Greek speakers and could have easily adapted the Linear B themselves." \[[MT11](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2011/08/03/homers-illiteracy/)\]

## Central asia
- "Indo-Europeans reached and probably overwhelmed the Eastern Steppes starting first around 5300 YBP symmetrically with the first invasion of western Europe. This eastern branch perhaps gave rise to the Tocharians though more data from the time Tocharian was actually attested would be useful. ... While the Afanasievo people who represent the 1st IE invasion of the east did not mix noticeably with the east Asians."
- "However, a second wave of Indo-Europeans, the Indo-Iranians, started advancing east perhaps starting around 4100 YBP. They appear to have conquered the Kazakh steppes by around 4000 YBP& sometime in the following 500 years invaded India: Aryan invasion."
- "By sometime around 3200-2900 YBP a branch of the Aryans advanced deeply to the east. ...This new Indo-Iranian wave mixed with the East Asians in Mongolia... This gene flow was not very extensive in the eastern reaches but it brought the technology of horse+goat+sheep+cow diary pastoralism to the east. This appears to have been transferred without much genetic acquisition of the lactase persistence phenotype."
- Population replacement ~50%. R1a1a is quite common among some central Asian populations, reaching levels of up to 60% among the Kyrgyz and the Tajiks. It is possible that the haplogroup expanded through central Asia and into northwestern India shortly before the arrival of agriculture, which arrived in the region shortly after 10,000 years ago.  (23andme)

> Basically, the eastern Yamnaya ancestry has been sloshing around the steppe for thousands of years. After 2000 BC they were absorbed into Indo-Iranians, but their far eastern outliers, the Afanesievo maintained some cultural continuity in the form of the Tocharian languages.

### Replacement
- Central Asian waves led to close interaction with mongoloid people .:

## Genes, memes, temes
What genes, memes or temes put them at an advantage?

- Technological and biological theories
    - "wheel in terms of technology & ideology played a serious role in this. The former especially because whatever else they did rapidly get from 1 place to another. " [MT18](https://twitter.com/blog_supplement/status/962865458687946753).
    - The people who spoke the Proto-Indo-European language lived at a critical time in a strategic place. They were positioned to benefit from innovations in transport, most important of these being the beginning of horseback riding and the invention of wheeled vehicles. \[David W. Anthony in "Indo-Europeans, The Horse, the Wheel, and Language: How Bronze-Age Riders from the Eurasian Steppes Shaped the Modern World"\]
    - " It has been proposed that the horse and chariot tradition frequently mentioned by some poets associated with Chu state might be a further marker of this contact. It indeed appears that the chariot and the equestrian culture were transmitted on one or even more occasions from the Indo-Iranians. It appears that a robust equestrian warfare arose somewhat later than the chariot culture (often linked to the need for the stirrup for effective warfare). Proto-Indo-Iranian tradition, while aware of horseback riding and equestrian warfare, placed much greater emphasis on the chariot in war and does not seem to record a stirrup." \[[MT](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2013/04/03/some-further-notes-on-the-mongol-religion/)\]
    - Lactose tolerance theory (discredited by genetic studies): Indo-Europeans developed a gene mutation that allowed them to digest milk even after being weaned, thus providing these nomads with a continuous and mobile source of nutrition.
- However, the dharma memeplex (../see [here](../dharma/)) is probably the most important competitive edge they had.
