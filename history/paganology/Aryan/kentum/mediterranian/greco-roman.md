## Greek waves
- "One of the causes for the end of the Mycenaean civilization is held to be the invasion of another Greek group the Dorians. In Greek epics these invasions are believed to represent the return of the Heracleidai, he descendents of Herakles who set out to conquer Greece from the other rulers. From the historical view point it is interesting to note that the use of the script declined after the Dorian invasion even though the Dorians were Greek speakers and could have easily adapted the Linear B themselves." \[[MT11](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2011/08/03/homers-illiteracy/)\]

## Population turnover

    - Emperor Augustus would introduce legislation to increase the birthrates of the Roman nobility.

### Etruscans
> Fortunately, recent advances in the field of archaeo-genetics have managed to clear up the situation somewhat. Showing us that while the mitochondrial DNA of ‘Etruscan’ remains may indeed tend to tether them to the pre-Indo-European populations of the neolithic (something that had generated some excitement amidst those claiming the Etruscans as a Basque-style ‘Isolate’) … the Y-chromosome analysis suggested a rather more familiarly Indo-European descent was salient.

## Deity similarities
- "In the Roman religion the “indra-like deity” was represented by Iuppiter: an etymological cognate of Indo-Aryan dyauH-pitR^i and Greek Zeus Pater (vocative: dyauH pitaH and Zeu Pater;)." \[[MT](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2014/07/27/some-comparative-considerations-on-the-indo-european-religion-with-a-focus-on-the-roman-religion/) \]
- "Mars had functional and iconographic similarity to kumAra the deity of para-Vedic provenance, who became a major deity among the Indo-Aryans starting from the latest-Vedic period. ... An interesting feature of the iconography of Mars was his non-human representation in the form of a spear. This was particularly important in the Regia, the office of the senior-most ritualist (Pontifex Maximus; Footnote 2), which lay between the temple of Vesta (where the Roman equivalent of the gArhapatya fire was housed) and the memorial of Julius commissioned by Augustus." \[[MT](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2014/07/27/some-comparative-considerations-on-the-indo-european-religion-with-a-focus-on-the-roman-religion/) \]

## Ritual language preservation
- "The ritual also included the chanting of the Saliaria Carmina which were ancient incantations which were part of the Roman “shruti”. They were composed in an ancient form of Italic that predated Latin and their text was faithfully handed by the ritualists along with their correct oral form. By the classical Roman period few understood their meaning they were learned by rote and deployed in the ancient language even as the ancient language of the veda is deployed by the Hindu ritualists." \[[MT](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2014/07/27/some-comparative-considerations-on-the-indo-european-religion-with-a-focus-on-the-roman-religion/) \]
