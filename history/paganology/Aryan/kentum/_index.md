## Kentum like
- Latin centum (originally pronounced with /k/, although most modern descendants of Latin have a sibilant there), Greek (he)katon, Welsh cant.
  - In the Germanic languages, the /k/ developed regularly by Grimm's law to become /h/, as in the English hund(red).
-  Latin, a centum language, as co(n)-; conjoin is cognate with Russian soyuz ("union")
