The present-day Armenians are an amalgam of the Indo-European groups with the Hurrians and Urartians.

## Hurrians
- During bronze age, they became subjects of the IA group mittAni.
- After mittani collapse, Urartu arose in 11th century BCE.
- It was to survive until the 7th century BC, by which time it was conquered fully into the Neo Assyrian Empire (911â€“605 BC).
- Finally, it was absorbed into the Persian empire.
