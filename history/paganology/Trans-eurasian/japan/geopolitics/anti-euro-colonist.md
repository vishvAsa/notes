Spanish, Dutch & Portuguese were always in fear of a Japanese invasion into their colonies like when Hideyoshi threatened to invade Spanish Philippines. In 1630's some Filipinos messaged the Japanese to liberate them from the Xtian Spanish tyranny & in response the Tokugawa began preparing for an invasion as they decided to clear Philippines of the Xtians as it was being used as a base to try & smuggle missionaries to Japan. Just then Shimabara rebellion broke out & these plans were shelved as 1 of the pushers for invasion at the court also died.

Later on when Ming loyalist Koxinga asked for Japanese help to conquer Taiwan from the Dutch, the Shogunate officially refused but as per Dutch records helped him covertly or turned a blind eye because they also saw the Dutch as a threat (they were also Xtians but of the Protestant kind, so less of a thread in eyes of the Shogunate at that time).
