## Records
- Ahmad Al Jallad's 21st CE writings. The below draws from it.
- The oldest surviving records from Ancient North Arabia are religious invocations to
  the gods carved on stone in an indigenous family of alphabets we call Ancient North
  Arabian.
  - Perhaps one of the earliest texts of this sort comes from the upper Wādī
  Sirḥān, the site of Bāyir in Jordan; while undated, its contents suggest that it was
  composed sometime the first half of the first millennium BCE.

### Islamic
- As Hawting convincingly argues, the narrative arch of kitābu l-ʾaṣnām –
the earliest work in the Islamic tradition devoted to the matter of pre-Islamic Arabian
religion – is the movement from primeval monotheism to paganism resulting from
the excessive veneration of ancestors and foreign influences ending ultimately with
the restoration of monotheism by the Islamic prophet.
  - What is noticeably absent from such works is any sense of a mythological framework  – the gods are isolated idols, stones, statues, and carvings, each one revered by a different social group with no narrative connection between them or any description of their role in cosmos.
    
## Rites
- Erection of the nṣb stone. Often accompanied by sacrifice.

### Animal sacrifice
- ḏbḥ is the common verb. w ḏbḥ l-bʿlsmn = ‘and he made an animal sacrifice to Baʿal-Samīn’
- Motivations
  - Several inscriptions record the performance of sacrifice before embarking on a raid
or journey.
  - The performance of a sacrifice is sometimes connected with the transition of seasons
and migration.
  - Thanksgiving.
- Location of Sacrifice: High ground preferred.

#### Burnt offerings
- Immolation of the sacrificed animal’s corpse was an important sacrifice type in the
  Hebrew Bible, there called ʿôlâ ‘that which goes up (in smoke)’.

### Pilgrimage
- ḥg in Safaitic and its verbal counterpart as ḥgg / yḥg.

### Ritual purity
- rḥḍ ‘to wash’ and ṭhr ‘to purify’.
- The rḥḍ ritual is performed before embarking on a pilgrimage or entering temples.
- Ritual ablution seems to have been required before engaging in other rites, like
  mourning.

### Sacred baths
- "He then became very sick, and was told, "There is a hot spring in al-Balqāʾ, in Syria (al-Sha'm);  if you would go there, you would be cured." So he went to the hot spring, bathed therein, and was cured."

### Vows and oaths
- oaths of self-amputation are twice attested in the context of retribution.
