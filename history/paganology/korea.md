## History
Korean elite for long accepted and appreciated an inferior vassal status relative to the Chinese empire in all respects. For notes on later barbarian invasions and Japanese takeover, see the [japan pages](../../japan/geopolitics/).

### Rebillion against Japanese: non factor
> 
> One reason given is that Xtianity was associated with resistance to Japan but this is not convincing as Xtians were still around 5% until Korean war. Most of the growth happened from Korean war to 1980's with US military/gov't backing. SK was still poor then, so Xtians were up to their usual huckster tricks of "prosperity gospel" etc. As SK got richer, growth tapered off a lot, Xtians have declined from 29% to 27% in last 10 yrs. 

### Yangban disdain
> Traditional Korean Society manifested, as Takashi Akiba long ago pointed out, a rather sharp cleavage between the life-orientation of the upper-class yangban and that of ordinary commoners. The yangban, absolutizing Confucianism, looked down on or ignored folk religion, but the coexistence of the two strata was made possible by their division into two social ranks.
>
> The new life-orientation developed in the cities in connection with the rapid social change of recent years, however, has exercised a profound influence even on agricultural village society through the Semaeull movement and other media. Members of the rural elite, quick to respond to the modernization and industrialization policy of the central government, played a leading role in abolishing or discontinuing traditional belief and practice, some in token of symbolic support for modernization, others in token of loyalty to the Semaeull movement. This resulted, on the one hand, in the diffusion of the Semaeull movement throughout the country as a new spiritual movement and, on the other, in the rapid destruction of the basis for cultural identity that existed in the traditional culture.

> it's elite tried to mimic China & had a Confucian base. At the same time they also had disdain for mudang. This was carried forward into the modern era. This Yangban & later elite disdain for mudang meant that during the so called modernization drive after Korean war, many traditions were stopped & the vacuum was filled by Xtians. 
> 
> Same reason why Xtians find it much easier to fool PRC Han, Singapore Han but find it very hard to do it with Taiwanese or Chinese in Malaysia. Korea & Japan r very different in their historic attitudes to China. Contrast the attitude of Yangban with say the development of Kokugaku or even Mitogaku (which integrated Confucian ideas).


### Misin Tapa Udong
- Late Joseon (1890s) - Protestantism sunk deep roots in Korea in the 1890s, establishing a network of schools and hospitals. The missionaries led campaigns for the burning of idols, ancestral tablets, shamans' tools and clothes, and shrines. The police began to arrest shamans, destroy shrines and burn ritual tools.
- The Yangban and later elite grew to disdain mudang. Partly hence, sporadic harassment of shamans continued under Japanese rule.
- Later, harassment continued vigorously as part of Park Chung-hee's Saemaul Undong. ([SP_TW_18](https://twitter.com/Rjrasva/status/954667990456287234)) Rituals were attacked with economic justification.
