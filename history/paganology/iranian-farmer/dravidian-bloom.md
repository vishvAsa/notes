## Harappan times
Harappans spoke a now lost/ subsumed language. In their southern borderlands were DR speakers who admixed with them and acquired some of the Harappan cultural elements.

## IA interactions
- IA met, and culturally influenced Dravidian language speakers, leading to acquisition of beneficial meme-plexes. They, as a consequence, expanded in to peninsular India, mixing and linguistically dominating the proto-Indian tribes.
