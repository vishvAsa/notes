## Western Hunter-Gatherers
They were tall.

## Caucasian Hunter-Gatherers
They split off WHG by around 43k BCE.

## Early European Farmers
Early European Farmers (EEF), First European Farmers (FEF), Neolithic European Farmers or Ancient Aegean Farmers (ANF).

They split from Caucasian Hunter-Gatherers (CHGs) around 23,000 BC.

The EEFs had settled Europe after the worst catastrophes following the Last Ice Age - the Storegga Slides. A continental shelf collapsed & resulting tsunamis drowned an entire landmass (Doggerland) while floods elsewhere in Europe devastated WHG communities. There was also terrible flooding in the Balkans in 6200 BC & the EEF invaded Europe from Anatolia via Greece at the same time.

## Megalith Builders
The Megalith Builders were the result of WHG chieftains overthrowing the decadent EEF chiefs like those of the Linear Ceramics around 4400 BC & subjugating an 1800 year old neolithic civilization. Possibly related to spread of copper-working.

By the time of their destruction the Megalith Builders themselves had been in a centuries long decline from their Golden Age in late 5th & early 4th millennium. Their great realms had likely disintegrated around 3500 BC into smaller chiefdoms engaging in endemic warfare.

## IE Invasions
The Indo-European invasions then happened- ending the Megalith Builder Civilization with their urban settlements & leaving much of Europe depopulated for 600 years.
