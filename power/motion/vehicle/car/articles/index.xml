      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;battery-and-range-stagnation&#34;&gt;Battery and range stagnation&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The status quo of electric cars: better batteries, same range.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If today&amp;rsquo;s supporters of EV&amp;rsquo;s would dig into the specifications and the sales brochures of early 20th century electric &amp;ldquo;horseless carriages&amp;rdquo;, their enthusiasm would quickly disappear. Fast-charged batteries (to 80% capacity in 10 minutes), automated battery swapping stations, public charging poles, load balancing, the entire business plan of Better Place, in-wheel motors, regenerative braking it was all there in the late 1800s or the early 1900s.
