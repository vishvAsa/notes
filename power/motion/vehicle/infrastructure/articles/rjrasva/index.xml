The result: more emissions and more congestion.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;wow. One could have thought that it reduces the absolute number of cars on road - but seems that it&amp;rsquo;s overridden by increase in aggregate time spent on road. - A&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;How will people use EVs?

More than a dozen studies show that ride-hailing simply replaced low-carbon alternatives such as walking, cycling, public transit or that notorious marvel of staying put. The result: more emissions and more congestion.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
