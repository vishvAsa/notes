## Force and mass
- The great genius Issac Newton postulated the existence of something called "Force"  (a vector) and "mass" (a scalar) - to describe the differing effects of the same effort on different objects. He said: let us say that all objects have "mass" - with lighter objects having lower mass. Then, F/m = a. Or F = ma. Aka Newton's second law of motion.
    - A corollary: In the absence of a force, there is no acceleration and no change in velocity. This is Newton's first law of motion.
    - Momentum vector := mv. Then force is rate of change of momentum.

## Reaction force
- To explain rebounds and such, Newton's third law states that when two bodies interact, they apply forces to one another that are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. Forces thus always occur in pairs.
- This results in the "conservation of momentum" in a closed system. Total of momentum of all bodies in a system remains constant (as internal forces and changes in momentum cancel each other out).
