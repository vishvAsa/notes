## General metrics
- Displacement s: a vector measuring change in position. Time t. 
- Velocity vector \\(v = \frac{ds}{dt}\\). Speed is it's magnitude (a scalar value - without direction arrow).
- Acceleration vector: \\(a = \frac{dv}{dt}\\) 

## Circular motion
- Let \\(\theta\\) represent angular position.
- Angular velocity \\(\gw = \dfrac{d\theta}{dt}\\).
  - This has a direction: counter clockwise is represented by an arrow going up from the plane of rotation, clockwise is represented by an arrow going down.
  - Canonical units are radians/second.
  - Velocity relation: \\(v = \gw r\\) where r is radius of the circle.
- Angular acceleration \\(\ga = \dfrac{d\gw}{dt}\\). This will be 0 for "uniform circular motion".
- Acceleration purely due to change in direction has magnitude \\(\abs{a_c} = \frac{dv}{dt} = \dfrac{|v|d\theta}{dt} = \abs{v}\gw = v^2/r = \gw^2r\\)
