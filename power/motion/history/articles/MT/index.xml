      <description>&lt;p&gt;The vimAna has been noticed by many since the publication of the samarA~NgaNa sUtradhAra (SS) of the great &lt;a href=&#34;http://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2005/12/raja-bhoja-glory-and-tragedy-of.html&#34;&gt;rAja bhoja-deva paramAra&lt;/a&gt;. The description is certainly obscure in parts (especially given the corrupt manuscripts), but what can be made sense of in the account definitely describes a flying machine. Many years ago when we had talked about this and both Mis-creant and dvipakSha-kesha expressed their skepticism that anything like this could have ever been really mentioned in the Hindu texts. After all, they chimed, there is enough reason to believe that the vaimAnika shAstra was a hoax of a text. While I was skeptic of the vaimAnika, I did know that bhoja-devaâ€™s work was real and so also the mention of the vimAna in it. So, I took these two to the library of Samskrit texts where I had a special inner access and showed them the text. Now many years later while planning new scripts for nATaka-s we ended up talking of it again- of course starting with the famous topic: did Hindus have an airplane?&lt;/p&gt;</description>
