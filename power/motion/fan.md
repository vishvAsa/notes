## Metrics
- Air Delivery : example 225 CMM (Cubic Meters per Minute)
- Number of blades
  - More blades - less speed, but also less noisy.
- Blade sweep. In ceiling fans: 600mm (2ft), 1200 mm (4 ft from center), 1400mm (5 ft) are common. Greater sweep is like adding more blades plus greater reach for air.
- Noise - double ball bearings mean less noise. 
- Speed RPM
- Mounting: Pedestal vs ceiling vs wall
- Looks
