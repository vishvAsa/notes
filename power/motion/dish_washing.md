## Power
- "Based on usage pattern of 2 months with most of the the time using quick mode which is only 30 minutes cycle with hot water and machine running once a day (every night). Our power consumption has gone up by 15 to 17 units of electricity from pre-installation six months average which in my highest slab of Rs 6.25 per unit costs that our power utility charges at this time costs Rs 94 to Rs 106 per month." - [AM](https://www.amazon.in/Bosch-Place-Settings-Dishwasher-SMS66GW01I/dp/B07JW77MVJ/ref=sr_1_5?dchild=1&qid=1612707479&s=kitchen&sr=1-5#customerReviews)

## Detergent
- "If I calculate for Fortune products. It is 110 detergent + 30 rinse aid + 50 (max) for salt." - 2020

## Compatible items
- "Aluminum vessels are not recommended to be put in dishwasher as the chemicals like detergent and rinse aid may chemically react with Aluminum and spoil the surface finish. I checked even the hard anodized aluminum items including from Hawkins are not dishwasher safe as per Hawkins so I have not put those. Some high end aluminum products are specifically designated as dishwasher-safe, those may be safe to use."
- Teflon coated non stick items are also not recommended to be cleaned in dishwasher. 
- "type of plastic that an item is made from determines whether or not it is dishwasher safe. If a plastic has a very low melting point then the high temperatures of a dishwasher can cause it to melt, but other types of plastic could become brittle and crack." 
- "most knife manufacturers don't recommend knifes to be put in dishwashers as the edge may get blunt after coming in contact with some chemicals for longer duration at high temperature."
- "Wooden items like belan and wooden cutting boards may also absorb chemicals and may get swelled and broken up is they contain glue etc. which can separate when hot."
