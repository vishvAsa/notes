## Systems:
- On-grid (with 2 way meter - to supply generated electricity to grid)
- On-grid without 2-way meter
- Off-grid
- Hybrid (aka Solar primary)

Hybrid and off-grid need battery. Battery costs generally too high. 

### Circuit details
- Panels (PV cells connected in series) generate DC electricity. Output is 24V or 12V usually.
- Panel output is connected to inverter and then to AC load or bi-directional meter.
- There may be just 1 inverter for all panels (common in off-grid or hybrid systems). Or there may be 1 "micro inverter" per panel (common in on-grid systems).
- Additionally, there may be good lightening arrestor and earthing. 
- Multiple panels connected in parallel may be connected in parallel to a battery and single inverter (in case of hybrid system).

## Components
- See panels [page](panels/).
- See [inverters page](../inverter/).

## On-grid BLR Cost
- Billing
  - There will be 2 meters (or 1 bidirectional meter): one measuring electricity consumed, another measuring electricity delivered. 
  - Subtraction in the final bill, potentially money back at a certain lower rate (paid annually) for excess electricity delivered.
- Excess units of current generated during summer will be accumulated. Some of these excess units will be used in cloudy season. Leftover will be purchased annually by BESCOM.
- If grid power is down - solar power generation will not be sent to grid. 

### 2020 Returns
- The Karnataka Electricity Regulatory Commission (KERC) policy came into effect in 2014 after KERC has listed out the implementation guidelines to all the ESCOMS.
- Calculations and comparisons [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DMpn8-yrXsemJfc-8mtk_6-DIix7Ar4dhyiTmwRx5Cs/edit#gid=0).
    - On-grid costs recoverable in 7 years. 
- 25 year agreement will be between house owner and BESCOM, usually mediated by vendor
  - Takes up to 60 days. If assistant engineer (AE) and installer have good understanding - can be done in 20-25 days.
