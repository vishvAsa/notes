## Size
- Panel size: 1mtr x 2 mtr = 3.3ft x 6.6ft.
- per kw 60-70 sqft as (prashAnt 2020 BLR)

## Capacity
- Ratings: Standard Test Conditions (STC) which is @ 25째C cell temperature
- Avg generation per KW per day in BLR (considering rain and cloud) 4kWh (as per prashant 2020).
- Annual degradation (as of 2020 tech) - 0.0045x annually (to be compounded during calculation).
- Solar cell negative temperature coefficient: .003739x/째C (to be compounded during calculation). The cell temperature may go to 70째C (=> .76x efficiency) and the ambient temperature will be 45째C in bengaLUru.

### Variance during day.
- Peak production time (BLR) is roughly 11AM to 2:30PM.

## Other features
- Maximum power point tracking MPPT - panels track the sun! 15% increase in winter and up to a 35% increase in summer. MPPT on the inverter side is separate.

## Installation
- 13 deg south slant (considering BLR latitude) to maximize winter production.

### Mounting structure
- Could be elevated or flat on the roof.
- Prefer corrosion resistant material like aluminum or galvanized steel for exposed parts.
- 5*6 + 4*3 = 42
- 4*6 + 4*6 = 48

## Choosing a brand
- Field performance anecdotes
  - Poor performance
    - 2021 - Vikram Solar panel
    - 2021 - MV
  - Good performance
    - Waree. Good service as well.
    - Loom
  - Uncertain
    - Canadian Solar
    - Panasonic
- When panel is not showing guaranteed perforamnce, maintenance from the company may be needed. If so, better to go for companies with good local presence.
