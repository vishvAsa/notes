## Lead acid batteries
- Flat plate
- Tubular
- Sealed

### Maintenance
- Refill with distilled water periodically. Specific gravity gauges are oft included with good batteries.

### Recycling
- Old (local) batteries are purchased by weight. Old tubular battery fetched 1200 Rs in 2020.  

## Cell stacking
### Battery capacity matching
- If one battery goes down sooner than another, current may continue to be drawn from low capacity one getting it to an unsafe/ damaged condition. So, never mix dissimilar batteries.
- "The weak cell holds less capacity and is discharged more quickly than their strong brothers. Going empty first causes their strong brothers to overrun their feeble sibling to the point where a high load can push the weak cell into reverse polarity. Nickel-cadmium can tolerate a reverse voltage of minus 0.2V at a few milliamps, but exceeding this will cause a permanent electrical short. On charge, the weak cell reaches full charge first, and then goes into heat-generating overcharge, while the strong brothers still accept charge and stay cool. The weak cell experiences a disadvantage on both charge and discharge; it continues to weaken until giving up the struggle."

### Parallel connection
- Cell mismatch is less critical (compared to series connection) here with regards to output voltage. But reverse polarization of the discharged battery and consequent heating can be a problem. 

### Series connection
- Cell mismatch can lead to big drop in voltage.
