## Current
- Current I - Rate of charge flow. 

## Support for current
- Potential difference V. Units: Volts

## Opposition to current
### Components
- Impedence: Overall opposition to current.
  - \\(Z = \sqrt{X^2 + R^2}\\) as reactance X comes with a phase shift.
- Resistence R. Independent of frequency. 
    - It is usually reasonable to assume that an input impedance is just resistance if the input signal has a low frequency (less than 1kHz).
- Reactance X dependent of frequency. 
  - Capacitive Reactance - Decreases with frequency. \\(X_C = \dfrac{1}{2 \pi f C} \\). DC has infinite \\(X_C\\).
  - Inductive reactance \\(X_L = 2 \pi fL\\). Increases with frequency. DC has zero  \\(X_L\\)
  - \\(X = X_L - X_C\\)
