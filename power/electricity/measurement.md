## Current
- Current I - Rate of charge flow. 

## V = Support for current
- Potential difference V. Units: Volts
- V = IR

### Utility supply
#### India
- 220V RMS AC, at 50Hz. Single phase.

#### USA
120 volts RMS Â± 6% at 60Hz.

## Opposition to current
### Components
- Impedence: Overall opposition to current.
  - \\(Z = \sqrt{X^2 + R^2}\\) as reactance X comes with a phase shift.
- Resistence R. Independent of frequency. 
    - It is usually reasonable to assume that an input impedance is just resistance if the input signal has a low frequency (less than 1kHz).
- Reactance X dependent of frequency. 
  - Capacitive Reactance - Decreases with frequency. \\(X_C = \dfrac{1}{2 \pi f C} \\). DC has infinite \\(X_C\\).
  - Inductive reactance \\(X_L = 2 \pi fL\\). Increases with frequency. DC has zero  \\(X_L\\)
  - \\(X = X_L - X_C\\)

## Power
- \\(P = VI = V^2/R = I^2R\\).
- This corresponds to the rate of heat generation + motion etc.. 
- To reduce power consumption, V being constant, reduce I.
  - In a parallel circuit, can turn off branches (as \\(I = I_1 + I_2\\) ).
  - In a series circuit, increase the resistance in the regulator/ rheostat (as \\(R = R_1 + R_2\\) ).
