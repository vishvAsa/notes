"The total electric current reaching the earth’s surface at any time is very nearly constant at 1800 amperes. This current, of course, is 'positive' — it carries plus charges to the earth. So we have a voltage supply of 400,000 volts with a current of 1800 amperes—a power of 700 megawatts!" A single bolt may transfer 30 Coulombs of charge!
