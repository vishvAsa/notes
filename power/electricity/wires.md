## Desiderata
- Weather resistance - high temperatures, high UV radiation.


## Wire gauge
Higher gauge implies lower diameter.  
SWG - standard wire gauge.  
AWG - American wire gauge.

### Heating circuit 
wire cross section - 4mm². Smaller cross section implies higher resistance, higher heat and consequent damage (melting insulation, plugs etc..). 

### Solar power
- DC cables - use bigger cross sections (4mm²) to minimize losses.
- Inverter to meter cables - at least 6mm². Increase with length.


### Fuse wires
Fuse wires have low melting point and high resistance (As $P = VI = IR^2$). For high resistance, wires of small cross section are used.

(Tinned) Copper Fuse Wire 28 SWG (diameter ~ 0.376)

- Current rating 12A.
- Approximate Fusing Current 16A - 18A.

## Casing
- Protect from water, plastic destroying UV radiation, heat etc..
- UPVC weather resistant pipes for outdoors. available in only few stores and need to be special ordered.
