## DC to AC UPS inverter
- Inputs:
  - DC power from battery, possibly also from other sources (solar panel, wind etc..)
  - AC power from the grid
- Output:
  - AC power fed to downstream loads (computer, lights etc..) and never to other parts getting "raw power" (boiler etc..). This output is never fed to the AC input (don't want to supply the grid or electrocute repairmen!).
- Processing:
  - AC power, when available, is used to charge battery and to run downstream loads.
  - When AC power is unavailable, battery is drained to run downstream loads.
