## Series connection
- String inverters are also known as ‘central inverters’. For example, they treat the solar array as one single solar panel.
- Disadvantage is that failure of one power source (solar panel shading) would cause a relatively big drop in voltage (possibly below the minimum starting voltage of the inverter) - MPPT may compensate to some extant. Shading of 9% of the solar array results in about 54% decrease in its power output (MPPT use unknown)!


## Microinverters
- Here, per inverter inputs are not stacked. Each power source may have its own inverter
- Costlier than central inverters (when you add up).
- Lower power eliminates many problems.
- Allow mounting PV modules on different surfaces and facing different directions.
- Can optimize performance and monitor better.
- Safer, both to install and maintain, since avoiding wiring lots of panels in series (when DC voltage can increase up to hundreds of volts) eliminates the need of high voltage DC wiring.
- much longer durability than central inverters due to the fact that they are not exposed to such a high power and heat like central inverters. micro inverters come with a more extended warranty – 20-25 years – compared to the typical 10 years guarantee of their string counterparts.
- High rated microinverter manufacturers include: Enphase.

### Micro parallel inverters
- A micro parallel inverter is a smart device containing four individual channels that can be connected to four separate solar panels. Each channel acts as a single micro inverter and can track the performance of its solar panel by using MPPT.
