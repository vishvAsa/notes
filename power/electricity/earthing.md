## Intro
- Fault current is best sent to ground. This includes surge current and lightening current.

## Structure
- An electrode is stuck in a pit in the ground and fault current is directed to it.
- The ground should have low resistivity at all times. But ground resistivity varies with space and season. So, electroloytes are added.
- With regular earthing, salt and coal is added around the electrode. Salt dissipates gradually and increases conductivity in the surrounding ground.
- With "chemical" earthing, special electrolytes and backfills are added, and the electrode itself comes surrounded by a case of electrolytes. As per IEEE 80 14.5 (d), there are certain compounds which has resistivity less than 0.12 ohm meter are called permanent earthing compounds. Which has a life span of more than 10 to 15 years (longer than "salt and charcoal" earthing).

## BS 7671 notation
- TN-S - most common in older housing stock, with supplier providing a separate earth conductor back to the substation. 
- TN-C-S - (Protective Multiple Earthing) Supply combines neutral and earth, but they are separated out in the installation. More common in newer houses. 
- TT -  No earth provided by supplier; installation requires its own earth rod etc.
- TN-C - No separate earth conductors anywhere - neutral used as earth throughout supply and installation (very rarely used).
- IT - Supply is e.g. portable generator with no earth connection, installation supplies own earth rod.

### Decoding
First letter:

- T The live parts have one or more direct connections to earth.
- I The live parts have no connection to earth, or are connected only through a high impedance. 

Second letter:

- T All exposed conductive parts are connected via your earth conductors to a local ground connection.
- N All exposed conductive parts are connected via your earth conductors to the earth provided by the supplier.

Remaining letters:

- C Combined neutral and protective earth functions (same conductor).
- S Separate neutral and protective earth functions (separate conductors).
