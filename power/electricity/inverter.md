title: Inverter

## Concept
### DC to AC UPS inverter
- Inputs:
  - DC power from battery, possibly also from other sources (solar panel, wind etc..)
  - AC power from the grid
- Output:
  - AC power fed to downstream loads (computer, lights etc..) and never to other parts getting "raw power" (boiler etc..). This output is never fed to the AC input (don't want to supply the grid or electrocute repairmen!).
- Processing:
  - AC power, when available, is used to charge battery and to run downstream loads.
  - When AC power is unavailable, battery is drained to run downstream loads.

## Non-grid-tied
### Power requirement calculation
- [अत्र](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1S8vd3QOw0CZ0H9xyblz0Fjt7q_ZV9XEAOMKTrvv8XEg/edit#gid=737255309)। 
- 890W in 2020 v-nilaya. VA rating of UPS at 70% efficiency - 1260VA.
- Battery capacity - 2522 Wh or 210 Ah at 12 V. 

## Grid tied
- grid-tie inverters must accurately match the voltage and phase of the grid sine wave AC waveform.
- Microinverters - one per solar panel are better than "one for all" inverters. Can optimize performance and monitor better. Lower power eliminates many problems.
- High rated microinverter manufacturers include: Enphase.


## Battery
### Lead acid batteries
- Flat plate
- Tubular
- Sealed

#### Maintenance
- Refill with distilled water periodically. Specific gravity gauges are oft included with good batteries.

#### Recycling
- Old (local) batteries are purchased by weight. Old tubular battery fetched 1200 Rs in 2020.
