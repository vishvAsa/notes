title = "Chinese ancestor memorial portraits"
+++

It’s always darkly funny to see how many German antique dealerships offer “Chinese paintings” for sale — that are actually idealized ancestral portraits of somebody dead. My Taiwanese wife warned me strongly against ever buying such portraits. And no sane culturally Chinese would hang up such a portrait in their living space. Especially not of an unrelated person. So not simply art, but religious objects.
