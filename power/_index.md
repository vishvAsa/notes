## Energy
Work $w = \int_{a}^{b}fds$ , energy.  
power. The law of conservation of energy. Potential and kinetic energy. Heat. Escape velocity.

## Thermodynamics
Molecular motion. Thermodynamic equilibrium is an equivalence relation.

Closed thermodynamic system: Change in the internal energy U = (Enthalpy) Heat supplied + work done.

Work/ energy: PV = nRT. 

## Engines
external combustion and internal combustion.  
PV curve; cyclical processes, Isothermic and adiabatic processes. 

Area of a cycle: No perfect engine law. Carnot cycle. 

### Misc topics
Refrigeration and compressors. The total entropy of any isolated thermodynamic system tends to increase over time, approaching a maximum value. Definition of Absolute Zero temperature. Boltzmann distribution of energy at temperature T. Heat: Conduction, convection, radiation. Stefan Boltzmann law. Radiation and absorption spectra.
