## Health
The positive correlation between per capita health expenditure in $ & energy supply. More costly health interventions are more energy-requiring or the more energy you have the more you can spend on energy-intensive health care.

## Sanitation
WHO issues an index of what fraction of a country's population has "safely managed sanitation facilities". This is positively correlated with the log of the per capita energy supply of the country. Of course the physical geography could account for lot of the observed variance. This illustrates the importance of energy supply in maintaining high levels of "safe" sanitation. This is especially true of bigger countries. 

Kyrgyzstan with a pc energy supp close to India supposedly has  91%  sanitation, probably a consequence of size & geography. One notable outlier is Myanmar  which apparently  has  60.9% safe sanit with an energy supply of  14.5 pc which is much less than what India has. Thus, while size remains a factor, theoretically one could do better for your energy band. While this is a mean over the past decade india has greatly improved in the last 5 years, especially in the rural domain.
