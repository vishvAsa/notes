## Intro
- can set timer or switches to save power.

## Coils
- These come in multiple forms - immersion coils, geysers.
- Geysers save power and are more convenient as they're equipped with a thermostat.
- With immersion coils, there is the risk of electric shock.
- "Instant" geysers are high powered and heat fast, but have low storage capacity. They are meant to drained slowly. (4.5kw 3L was insufficient for comfortable showering.)
- Storage geysers heat more slowly, but can be drained a lot more (20L?) at a time. Typical storage capacity - 15 - 25 L. (20L 2kW was used by 6 people in v-nilaya BLR in 2020. Heating time 15/20 min.)

## Air source heat pump (ASHP)
- Aka reverse-cycle air conditioners.
- General principles described in heat pump page.
- The heating efficiency of electric water heater is less than 100%, while that of air source heat pump water heater can reach 400% when the ambient temperature is high enough. This is because heat is transferred, rather than generated using electricity. Even under 0â„ƒ ambient temperature, the heating efficiency can be 200%, far higher than the heating efficiency of electric water heater. Thus, air source water heater can save more electricity and energy than electric water heater.
- Example. At .86 kw Power: if outside temperature is 20 deg can deliver 80 deg water in 1 hour. Say if outside air is 20 degrees and max cut off set to 55 degrees, heat pump will take even lesser time.
