## Desiderata
- Protection from wind
- Fuel supply
  - Continuous supply mechanism is better.
- Air supply
  - Bottom, top, sides in case of gasification.
- Chimney effect support
- Portability
- Pot support
- Life
  - Small gauge Iron wires degrade with use
- Repairability

### Gasification
- Aka wood gas.
- Gasifiers can separate gas generation from gas combustion in space and time. In a reactor (gas generator) that is optimized for heat-dependent drying and pyrolysis, solid biomass is first converted into gases and vapors. These are guided into a combustion zone (gas burner) where they are burnt with a surplus of oxygen from a secondary air inlet.
- In a conventional fire the heat is controlled by regulating the fuel supply: the more fuel we add, the more heat we generate, provided sufficient air is available for the combustion. Gasifiers control and optimize both fuel and air supply.
- Gasifier stoves are currently the cleanest burning option to burn solid biomass in a cook stove. The “gas burner” provides the convenience and efficiency similar to cooking on fossil gas with very little soot and other emissions.
- Heat output is not easy to regulate.

### Design patterns
- Provide holes below 

### Material

## Cubes with top side open
- If the combustion area is large enough and not cramped, equivalent to burning wood out in the open. Or in principle equivalent to a "Cube with 2 sides open" type stove with pot on top.  
- Example: traditional homa-kUNDa-s (Idealized).

</div>

### Characteristics 
- Consumes quite a bit of wood. 
- Lot of smoke when the fire is low, and in the initial and terminal stages. 
- Ash accumulation + charcoal creation observed.

### Improvement with grill and sieve
This seems to achieve characteristics similar to "Cube with 2 sides open + holes for ventilation at the bottom and sides" type described below.

### Improvement with holes, fan fitted at bottom

#### supernova model 
- "this kund generates lowest % of carbon-monoxide and needs less quantity of yagna herbal material as the material is vaporized and gasified 100% without waste because the temperature attained by the kunda is always above 300°C along with the purified flames upto 1300°C, the Kund is designed from copper pot to get the uniform temperature along with the impact of copper oxygenation which play vital role in purification of atmosphere. "

- "The fallen ash collects in a bottom plate, above the fan, which can be disposed easily.
   You can adjust the speed of the fan, or use it for initial jwalanam, then switch off. 
   I think this will be more useful where charu, apoopa etc are offered as havis."

## Cube with top + 1 sides open
### Characteristics 
- Relatively inefficient burning - tends to produce charcoal besides ash, quite a bit of smoke.
- Indian cooking smoke (indoor) said to equal 20 cigarettes a day (source: prakti promotional video).
- Temperature at top: max 580°C ([IG18](https://www.instagram.com/p/BgLspLPlHN0/))

### Realizations
- mud stoves cost 250 Rs in 2018 and lasted 6 months.

### Modifications
- Collapsible
  - Disadvantage - need to wait to cool down before disassembly. A hazzle. 

#### Ventilation at the bottom and sides
##### Realizations
- Prakti woodstove.

##### Characteristics 
- Relatively efficient burning. 70 to 90% less smoke compared to basic "Cube with 2 sides open". (Numbers from prakti woodstove videos 2018.) Is this still equal to 2 cigarettes a day (going by prakti promotional videos)?


## Rocket stove
- Good YT explanation [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TmWvLyaGdk).
- Types: L and J shapes.

### Characteristics
- Temperature at top: 715°C ([IG18](https://www.instagram.com/p/BgLspLPlHN0/)). With good insulation, can even reach 1100°C  ([IG18](https://www.instagram.com/p/BjkR34FBXob))
- Burns about 1 kg of fuel per hour ([himalayan video](https://youtu.be/tbBilWdfPgM)).

### Operation
- Must clean up ash buildup at the bottom so as to not block air. 
- One needs to keep pushing the wood in - with hand or with gravity to keep the stove burning.

### Key principles
- Air intake: One leaves generous space to suck in air from under the mesh which holds the wood fuel sticks - or one provides a separate air intake pipe at the bottom.
- Chimney effect - described seperately.
  - Needs a minimum height.
- Even the smoke/ soot burns in good models.
- Limited fuel consumption:
  - Only a small part of the wood ever burns - very efficiently at that, at high temperature.
- **Insulation**: Combustion, air-sucking and cooking efficiency keeps increasing with temperature increase. So, the stove body is ideally well insulated.

## Chimneys
See [chimney page](/notes/places/environment/air/chimney).

- It'll make the smoke exit point higher, at least - which will make standing around comfortable.

## Elevation
- कुण्डानाम् उच्चतया धूमप्रभावेणायुर्हरणं न स्यात् तावत्।
