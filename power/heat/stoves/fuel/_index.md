## Hexamine cubes
- burn smokelessly, do not liquefy while burning and leave no ashes
- As with trioxane, hexamine has an almost infinite shelf life if stored properly, in a sealed dry container.
- have a high energy density  - 30.0 MJ/kg (so ultra-lightweight)
- used for cooking by campers, often with disposable metal stoves

### Cooking 
- heat given off cannot be easily adjusted - cooking requiring simmering is more difficult.
- The burning tablets are sensitive to wind, so a simple windscreen should be used. Eg. a cup.

### Safety
- Not to be ingested 
- combustion can create formaldehyde, ammonia, nitrogen oxide, hydrogen cyanide. So good ventilation needed.
