## Energy and minerals
Energy and minerals drive modernity, science, convenience, space exploration etc..

## Pre-collapse
### Human trajectory
Our planet (+ barren mars, hypothetically) is finite. Can't add in other star systems - too far away to benefit those here.  
We grew exponentially, exploiting and even recklessly wasting resources.
So, cannot sustain current rate of resource exploitation and pollution.  
After that will be a grind down to stone age before ultimate extinction.  
Resource wastage, wars etc.. can speeden the decline.

### Resource wastage
As we fecklessly extract minerals, oils and gasses - and then waste them frivolously, we will soon not be able to extract them given our limited energy. This rate of resource extraction and waste cannot be sustained indefinitely.

#### Fossil fuel wastage
Humanity's wastes highly undervalued fossil fuel.  
It could've been better and more safely rationed out for developing cleaner energy sources, plastic manufacture, near-space colonization, delaying industrial collapse etc..  
Instead, it is burnt, leading to global warming and such.

#### Ores
All sorts of mines were richer in the past - Cu, Au, Ag, Al, Fe .. Many were totally exhausted, despite miles and miles of tunnels. 

### End of economic growth
Over-reliance on a limited store of frozen sunlight has led to rapid economic growth.  
This economic growth, being dependent on energy-usage growth, resource exploitation and population growth is not sustainable.  

## During collapse
There will be widespread famines, social unrest and depopulation.

### Energy
Some tech (nuclear breeder reactors, PV energy) may provide energy while they last.

#### Planned use
If one thought long-term, about the coming mostly-stone-age a few kilo-years later, one would use the current energy wealth to -

- make and store lots of copies of texts ( http://rebrand.ly/dg-archive  )
- make billions of stone tools (tools + weapons - axe-heads, knifes, plough-heads ...), magnifying glasses

Other ideas - please contact me.

## Post collapse
There might be islands of civilization which can manage advanced thought and material comfort.

It will be the time of adventurers and technomages.


### Energy
#### Long term
Solar thermal, and hydroelectric power plants would be fairly cheap and low-tech. 

### Minerals
Minerals will be scarce, but will be obtained from recycling and some high-energy techniques.
