## Human trajectory
Our planet (+ barren mars, hypothetically) is finite. Can't add in other star systems - too far away to benefit those here.  
We grew exponentially, exploiting and even recklessly wasting resources.
So, cannot sustain current rate of resource exploitation and pollution.  
After that will be a grind down to stone age before ultimate extinction.  
Resource wastage, wars etc.. can speeden the decline.

## Resource wastage
As we fecklessly extract minerals, oils and gasses - and then waste them frivolously, we will soon not be able to extract them given our limited energy. This rate of resource extraction and waste cannot be sustained indefinitely.

### Fossil fuel wastage
Humanity's wastes highly undervalued fossil fuel.  
It could've been better and more safely rationed out for developing cleaner energy sources, plastic manufacture, near-space colonization, delaying industrial collapse etc..  
Instead, it is burnt, leading to global warming and such.

## Reserves
All sorts of mines were richer in the past - Cu, Au, Ag, Al, Fe .. Many were totally exhausted, despite miles and miles of tunnels. 

### Energy
Energy drives modernity, science, convenience, space exploration etc..

### End of economic growth
Over-reliance on a limited store of frozen sunlight has led to rapid economic growth.  
This economic growth, being dependent on energy-usage growth, resource exploitation and population growth is not sustainable.
