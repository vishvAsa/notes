People claimed coal grows back in 1600's England but Rooke Church in his 1612 text "An olde thrift newly revived" was already writing on the need for tree planting to plan for when coal is gone

For if Coale should faile  
(as it is too apparant it beginneth to grow deere and scarce,  
and in many places there is none to be had)  
how then should we doe for this materiall of fuell?  
for doe we thinke that wood alone  
can beare the brunt to satisfie every mans chimney?  
assuredly now, except it were more plentifull.  
Then must there needs be some speedy means used  
for prevention of felling whole woods of timber,  
and grubbing up of Copies  
at pleasure to convert them into pasture, arrable, or meadow grounds,  
else in short time, this waste and scarcitie will grow to a consummation of the whole.35
