Patiently, I replied that this series had nothing to do with Castro or with “Communism”. Both Korea and Cuba are “Communist” countries yet the Cubans are eating while the North Koreans are starving. That, I said, was the point – the only point.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

There are two countries where it has already happened: North Korea and Cuba. Both countries have little or no oil resources of their own, both relied upon the Soviet Union for their oil imports, and both experienced a swift and severe drop in their oil imports following the demise of the Soviet empire. While showing proper respect for the suffering of people in both countries, perhaps we can benefit from studying their examples.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
