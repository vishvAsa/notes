## 2026 Blizzard

The recent blizzard/Arctic descent in the USA shows how life at current carrying capacity and even a modicum of comfort is impossible without fossil fuels. If people had gone whole hog with the gardabhin plan of "green energy" it would have resulted in many more deaths and extreme discomfort. It is also a reminder that civilization at a scale can only be a transient phenomenon with such a dependency.
