      <description>&lt;p&gt;Depending on background, math and equations may be an intimidating &amp;ldquo;foreign language&amp;rdquo; to some students. This brief appendix aims to offer a refresher on techniques, and hopefully inspire a more peaceful relationship for students.&#xA;A.1 Relax on the Decimals&#xA;First, we can form a more natural, forgiving relationship with numbers. Like your friends, they need not be held to exacting standards: they are simply trying to tell you something useful. Remembering that π is roughly 3 is far more important than committing any further decimals to&#xA;memory.&#xA;If a friend traced out a circle in the sand and asked how much area it had,&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; the poorly-defined and irregular boundary defies precise measurement, so why carry extra digits. Maybe just recognize that the radius is roughly one meter, so the area is about 3 square meters. Done.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; The message here is to give yourself a break and just not over-represent the precision (number of decimals) in your answer.&#xA;Part of the reason students have a rigid relationship with numbers is because homework and test problems tend to come pre-loaded with numbers assumed to be exactly known. But the real world is seldom so generous, leaving us to forage for approximate numbers and estima-&#xA;tions.&#xA;By being approximate in our use of numbers, we are liberated to do math in our heads more readily. Practice can make this into a life-long skill that becomes second nature. It is helpful to know some shortcuts.&#xA;Example A.1.1 To explore the flavor of approximate math, let&amp;rsquo;s consider the statement:&#xA;π ~ √10&#xA;~&#xA;10&#xA;3&#xA;~&#xA;3.&#xA;Your calculator will disagree, but that&amp;rsquo;s why we use the&#xA;symbol&#xA;(similar) instead of = (equal). Another common option is ≈ (approximately). Your calculator is not as clever as you, and can&amp;rsquo;t appreciate when things are close. It&amp;rsquo;s pedantic. Literal. You can be better.&#xA;How do we use this loose association? We saw one example of using&#xA;3 before, so will not repeat here.&#xA;π&#xA;A.1 Relax on the Decimals&#xA;359&#xA;A.2 Forget the Rules&#xA;.361&#xA;A.3 Areas and Volumes&#xA;362&#xA;A.4 Fractions A.5 Integer Powers&#xA;363&#xA;365&#xA;A.6 Fractional Powers&#xA;366&#xA;A.7 Scientific Notation.&#xA;367&#xA;A.8 Equation Hunting .&#xA;368&#xA;A.9 Equation Manipulation&#xA;369&#xA;A.10 Units Manipulation.&#xA;370&#xA;373&#xA;A.11 Just the Start&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This book does not rely heavily on past knowledge of chemistry, but it is helpful to know a few basic elements that play a role in fossil fuels, biological energy, and climate change. This section could act as a refresher, or a first exposure to the fundamentals.&#xA;B.1 Moles&#xA;Chemistry deals with atoms and molecules and the interactions between them. Atoms and molecules1 are irreducible nuggets of a substance the minimum unit that carries the essential properties of that substance. Water, for instance, is comprised of two hydrogen atoms bonded to a single oxygen atom, which we denote as H2O.&#xA;B.1 Moles&#xA;B.2 Stoichiometry B.3 Chemical Energy B.4 Ideal Gas Law.&#xA;375&#xA;376&#xA;379&#xA;.381&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>C Selected Answers</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Numerical answers are given as ranges or other hints, meant to facilitate checking for gross departures from the right track, without revealing the precise answer so that shortcuts are discouraged. Questions for which the answer is already known (questions asking to verify an answer), easily validated in the text, or that are a matter of original thought or opinion may not be included here.&#xA;The ranges sometimes may be annoyingly large, but think of them as guard rails to prevent a tragic miscalculation or to catch a fundamental misunderstanding of the underlying concepts. It can help catch errors like dividing the wrong things or swapping numerator and denominator, or multiplying when division is called for. In many cases, intuition, or guessing, might lead you already to similar answers or ranges. With practice, students may be able to anticipate what they think are reasonable ranges for answers. In fact, it is a great practice to think about expectations before working on the problem.&#xA;This appendix, then, might be thought of as an &amp;ldquo;intuition implant&amp;rdquo; that simulates how problems are for experts. Real life does not provide &amp;ldquo;answers at the back of the book,&amp;rdquo; so experts rely on experience, intuition, and a sense for &amp;ldquo;reasonable&amp;rdquo; results to help them understand when they&amp;rsquo;ve taken a wrong turn. A successful use of this appendix would help train students to develop their own &amp;ldquo;common sense&amp;rdquo; guard rails.&#xA;Chapter 1&#xA;20. A smidge higher then boiling&#xA;4.
