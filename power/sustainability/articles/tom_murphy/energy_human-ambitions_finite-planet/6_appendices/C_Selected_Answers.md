Numerical answers are given as ranges or other hints, meant to facilitate checking for gross departures from the right track, without revealing the precise answer so that shortcuts are discouraged. Questions for which the answer is already known (questions asking to verify an answer), easily validated in the text, or that are a matter of original thought or opinion may not be included here. 
The ranges sometimes may be annoyingly large, but think of them as guard rails to prevent a tragic miscalculation or to catch a fundamental misunderstanding of the underlying concepts. It can help catch errors like dividing the wrong things or swapping numerator and denominator, or multiplying when division is called for. In many cases, intuition, or guessing, might lead you already to similar answers or ranges. With practice, students may be able to anticipate what they think are reasonable ranges for answers. In fact, it is a great practice to think about expectations before working on the problem. 
This appendix, then, might be thought of as an "intuition implant" that simulates how problems are for experts. Real life does not provide "answers at the back of the book," so experts rely on experience, intuition, and a sense for "reasonable" results to help them understand when they've taken a wrong turn. A successful use of this appendix would help train students to develop their own "common sense" guard rails.
