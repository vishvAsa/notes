This section aims to answer the question: Why can't we just14 elec- trify transportation and be done with fossil fuels? It turns out to be hard. Rather then rely on external studies, this section applies lessons from the book to demonstrate the power of first-principles quantitative 
assessment.

Box 13.3 (p. 212) indicated that direct drive of cars and airplanes from solar energy is impractical: while it may work in limited applications, solar power is too diffuse to power air and car travel as we know it. 
Thus electrified transport becomes all about storage, generally in bat- teries. Several times in the book, the energy density of gasoline was compared to that of battery storage. In rough numbers, gasoline delivers about 11 kcal/g, working out to ~13 kWh/kg in units that will be useful to this discussion. Meanwhile, lithium-ion batteries characteristic of those found in cars15 have energy densities about one-hundred times 
smaller. 
This section will use the most optimistic energy density for lithium-ion batteries around 0.2 kWh/kg-which is about 65 times less than for gasoline. Offsetting this somewhat is the fact that electric drive can be as high as 90% efficient at delivering stored energy into mechanical energy, while the thermal conversion of fossil energy in large vehicles is more typically 25%. The net effect is roughly a factor of twenty16 difference in delivered energy per kilogram of fuel vs. storage. 
The enormous mismatch in energy density between liquid fossil fuels and battery storage is the crux of the problem for transportation, the implications of which are explored here. We will start at the hard end, and work toward the easier.

[^15]: The larger Tesla battery pack, for in- stance, provides 265 miles (425 km) of range and holds 85 kWh at a mass of 540 kg for an energy density of 0.16 kWh/g. 

[^16]: The math goes: 13 kWh/kg divided by 0.2 kWh/kg times 0.25/0.90, yielding a factor of 18. For the sake of estimation, 18 is close enough to a factor of 20 to use the more convenient and memorable 20x scaling factor in what follows. 
D.3.1 Airplanes 
Box 17.1 (p. 290) already did the work to evaluate the feasibility of powering typical passenger planes electrically. The result was a reduction in range by a factor of 20, consistent with the premise above: the best lithium-ion technology-not yet achieved in mass-market at 90% efficiency delivers about 5% as much mechanical energy per kilogram as do liquid fossil fuels. 
Keeping the same 15 ton17 "fuel" mass, but now at 0.2 kWh/kg results in a 3,000 kWh battery capacity. The factor-of-twenty energy reduction per mass results in ranges down from 4,000 km via jet fuel to 200 km on battery, which is a two-hour drive, effectively. Charging a 3,000 kWh battery in the 30 minutes it typically takes for a plane to turn around-in efficient operations, anyway-would consume 6,000 kW, or 6 MW of power, which is about the same as the average electricity consumption of 5,000 homes. 
We will keep track of kWh per kilometer as a useful metric for trans- portation efficiency, putting it all together at the end (Section D.3.7). In the case of air travel, it's 3,000 kWh to go 200 km, or 15 kWh/km. On a per-passenger basis, 150 passengers in the airplane results in 0.1 kWh/km/person. 

[^17]: One metric ton is 1,000 kg, and is often spelled tonne. Here, ton is used to mean metric ton, which is only 10% larger than the Imperial "short ton."

D.3.2 Shipping 
Large container ships ply the seas carrying stacks of shipping containers over very long stretches of open ocean. A typical ship operating between Shanghai and Los Angeles travels 10,400 km carrying 10,000 20-foot equivalent18 containers each bearing an average of something like 10 tons of cargo. Thus, the full (maximum) load is 100,000 tons.[^19] 
At normal cruising speed, the ship takes 10 days to make the journey, consuming about 325 tons of fuel per day. A battery large enough to replace 3,250 tons of fuel would be 20 times more massive, at 65,000 tons, displacing two-thirds of the cargo capacity, and requiring triple the number of ships to carry the same cargo. The resulting 13,000,000 kWh of storage20 to travel 10,000 km results in 1,300 kWh/km. 
The open ocean has no refueling stations. Even a refueling ship/platform would have to get the electrical energy from somewhere. Thus, shipping would be radically changed if electrified. Electric ships may not be able to cross open ocean, instead hugging the coast dotted with power plants21 to supply frequent and lengthy charge stops for the ships. 
D.3.3 Long-haul trucking 
Typical "big rigs" on the highway achieve a fuel economy around 6 miles per gallon (40 L/100 km) of fuel, while the most aerodynamic ones achieve 8 mpg (30 L/100 km). Long haul rigs carry two fuel tanks, each holding about 150 gallons (570 L; 425 kg). The range for the more efficient trucks therefore becomes about 2,000 miles (3,200 km).22 Cargo capacity is about 20 tons. 
23 
Total fuel mass is 300 gal times 2.85 kg/gal, or about 850 kg. The same mass of battery would hold 170 kWh and deliver a range of 100 miles (160 km; roughly 1 kWh/km). Ugh. Lots of recharging stops. 
But wait, trucks are big, right? Surely a larger battery can be accommo- dated. Unlike airplanes, where mass is critical, trucks can afford to pack on a larger battery. Some of the cargo space could be devoted to energy storage, surely. What fraction of the space would be acceptable? 
To achieve comparable range as is presently realized, the battery mass would need to be about 20 times the gasoline mass, or 17,000 kg. Oh dear the maximum cargo load was about 20 tons. So 85% of the cargo capacity is taken up by battery, which would seem to be unacceptable. 
A solution would be smaller batteries and more frequent charging stops possibly in the form of forklift-loaded pre-charged modules that are owned by the trucking company and can be interchanged among the fleet. Otherwise a substantial fraction of time would be spent charging: very possibly more time than is spent driving.

It is not impossible24 to electrify long-haul trucking, but neither is it free of significant challenges. Certainly it is not as easy and convenient as fossil fuels.

D.3.4 Buses 
Like cargo ships and long-haul trucks, public transit buses are on the go much of the time, favoring solutions that can drive all day and charge overnight. Given the stops and breaks, a typical bus may average 30 km/hour and run 14 hours per day for a daily range of approximately 400 km. At an average fuel economy of 3.5 mpg (70 L/100 km), each day requires about 300 L or 220 kg of fuel-no problem for a fuel tank. The equivalent battery would need to be 4,500 kg (900 kWh; 2.3 kWh/km), occupying about three cubic meters. Size itself is not a problem: the roof of the bus could spread out a 0.15 m high pack covering a 2 m x 10 m patch. Buses typically are $10^{-15}$ tons, so adding 4.4 tons in battery is not a killer. 
Electrified transit is therefore in the feasible/practical camp. What makes it so unlike the previous examples-is slow travel, modest daily ranges, and the ability to recharge overnight. Raw range efficiency is low, at 2.3 kWh/km, but this drops to a more respectable 0.2 kWh/km person for an average occupancy of 10 riders. 
per 
For charging overnight, a metropolitan transit system running 50 routes and 8 buses per route25 and therefore needs to charge 400 buses over 6 hours at an average rate of 150 kW per bus26 for a total demand of 60 MW equivalent to the electricity demand of about 50,000 homes. 
D.3.5 Passenger Cars 
Passenger cars are definitely feasible and practical for some uses. Typi- cally achieving 0.15-0.20 kWh/km, the average American car driving 12,000 miles per year (about 50 km/day, on average) would need at least 10 kWh capacity to satisfy average daily driving, but would need closer to 100 kWh to match typical ~500 km ranges of gasoline cars. 
At a current typical cost of $200-300 per kWh, such a battery costs $20,000 to $30,000, without the car.[^27] The most basic home charger runs at 120 V and 12 A,28 multiplying to 1,440 W. A 100 kWh battery actually takes closer to 110-120 kWh of input due to 80-90% charge efficiency. Dividing 115 kWh by 1.44 kW leaves 80 hours29 as the charge time. Table D.1 provides similar details for this and two other higher-power 
scenarios. 
The middle row of Table D.1 is most typical for home chargers and those found in parking lot charge stations, resulting in an effective charge speed of about 10 miles per hour, or 16 km/hr. This is a convenient way to

instance.

characterize charge times. Adding enough charge to cover an average day of 30 miles or 50 km will take about 3 hours for the middle-row case, or just over an hour for the high-power charge. 
Imagine now making a long road trip, driving at 100 km per hour. Even the fastest charge rate30 in Table D.1 is 2.5 times slower. Every 400 km driven will take 4 hours on the road plus 10 hours at a charger for an average rate of 28 km/hr,[^31] or 18 mi/hr. 
Special fast-charge stations can provide a staggering 250 kW32 of power, cutting charge times dramatically. But this is neighborhood-scale energy delivery that households cannot expect to supply themselves. It is also informative to compute the temperature rise of a battery from a fast charge. If charging is 90% efficient, the other 10% turns to heat in the battery. Each kilowatt-hour of battery capacity has an associated mass around 5-10 kg, and receives 0.1 kWh (360 kJ) of thermal energy when charged. At a specific heat capacity around 1,000 J/kg/°C, a 360 kJ deposition increases the cell's temperature by 36-72°C, depending on energy density.[^33] This is not a small rise (reaching boiling temperatures on warm days), and can contribute to shorter battery lifetime. 
So electric cars are not simple drop-in replacements for the gasoline machines roaming the roads today, that effectively refuel at a rate of 10 MW34 
given the fast delivery of an extremely energy-dense liquid. On performance and convenience measures, it would be hard to characterize them as superior substitutes. But they can certainly suit well for local travel when given ample time to recharge-overnight, for instance. And in the long run, it seems we will have little choice. 
For all this, several things still are not clear: 
1. Will large scale ownership of electric cars become affordable, or remain cost prohibitive? Battery prices will surely fall, but enough? 2. If widespread, how will residential areas cope with tremendous increases in electrical demand during popular recharge hours? 3. How could night-time charging utilize solar input? 4. Will enough people willingly give up long-range driving capabil- 
ity? Will dual-system cars (like plug-in hybrids) be preferred to maintain gas capability for the occasional longer trip? 
5. Will people sour over costly battery decline and replacement? 
Electric cars are a growing part of transportation, and will no doubt grow more. It is too early to tell whether they will be able to displace fossil cars in the intermediate term. If not, personal transportation is likely to decline as fossil fuel use inevitably tapers away.

D.3.6 Wired Systems 
To finalize the progression of hardest-to-easiest electrified transporta- tion, we leave the problematic element behind: batteries. Vehicles on prescribed routes (trains, buses) can take advantage of wires carrying electricity: either overhead or tucked into a "third rail" on the ground. Most light rail systems use this approach, and some cities have wires over their streets for trolley buses. High-speed trains also tend to be driven electrically, via overhead lines. 
The ease with which wired electrical transport is implemented 35 relative to the other modes discussed in this Appendix is another way to emphasize the degree to which storage is the bottleneck. 
D.3.7 Collected Efficiencies 
Each transportation mode in the previous sections reported an efficiency, in terms of kilowatt-hours per kilometer. Not surprisingly, mass and speed play a role, making container ships very hard indeed to push along, followed by airplanes. In some cases, it makes sense to express on a per-passenger or per-ton basis, distributing the energy share among its beneficiaries. Table D.2 summarizes the results, sometimes offering multiple options for vehicle occupancy to allow more fruitful compar- isons among modes. Note that air travel looks pretty good until realizing that the distances involved are often quite large, making total energy expenditure substantial for air travel. 

[^35]: Wired electrified transport has been a steady contributor to transportation for over a century.

Loads are expressed contextually either as people (ppl) or tons (1000 kg). Per-passenger/ton ef- ficiency depends on occupancy-expressed as kWh/km per person (psn)-for which multiple instances are offered in some cases. While trucks have a far better kWh/km measure than ships, ships are about four times more efficient per ton, carrying 5,000 times more cargo. Air freight is 100 times more energetically costly than by ship!
