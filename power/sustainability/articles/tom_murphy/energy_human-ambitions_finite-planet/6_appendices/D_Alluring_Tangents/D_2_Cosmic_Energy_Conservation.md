title = "D 2 Cosmic Energy Conservation"

+++
Sec. 5.2 (p. 69) discussed the foundational principle of the conservation of energy, claiming that the principle is never violated except on cosmic scales. Besides elaborating on that point, this section follows the story of energy across vast spans of time as our sun forms and ultimately delivers energy to propel a car. We also clarify what it means for energy to be "lost" to heat.

## D.2.1 Cosmological Exception 
Emmy Noether was a leading mathematician in the early twentieth century who also dabbled in physics. In a very profound insight, she recognized a deep connection between symmetries in nature and con- servation laws. A symmetry, in this context, is a property that looks the same from multiple vantage points. For instance, a sphere is symmetric in that it looks the same from any angle. A cylinder or vase also has symmetry about one axis, but more limited than the sphere. 
The symmetries Noether considered are more subtle symmetries in time, space, and direction. 
Definition D.2.1 Symmetry in time means that physics behaves the same at all times: that the laws and constants are the same, and an experiment cannot be devised that would be able to determine absolute time. 
Symmetry in space means that the laws of physics are the same no matter where one goes: fundamental experiments will not differ as a function of location. 
Symmetry in direction is closely related to the previous one. It says that the universe (physical law) is the same in every direction. 
The insight is that these symmetries imply conservation laws. Time symmetry dictates conservation of energy. Space symmetry leads to con- servation of momentum. Directional symmetry results in conservation of angular momentum. 
Great. As far as we know, the latter two are satisfied by our universe. To the best of our observational capabilities, the universe appears to be homogeneous (the same everywhere) and isotropic (the same in all directions). Yes, it's clumpy with galaxies, but by "same," we mean that physics appears to act the same way. Therefore, substantial observa- tional evidence supports our adopting conservation of momentum and conservation of angular momentum as a fact of our reality. 
But time symmetry is a problem, because the universe does not appear to be the same for all time. It appears to have emerged from a Big Bang (see Section D.1), and was therefore much different in the past than it is now, and continues to change/evolve. An experiment to measure the effective temperature of the Cosmic Microwave Background is enough to establish one's place on the timeline of the cosmic unfolding. 
As a consequence, conservation of energy is not strictly enforced over cosmological timescales. When a photon travels across the universe, it "redshifts," as if its wavelength were being stretched along with the expansion of the universe. Longer wavelengths correspond to lower energy. Where did the photon's energy go? Because time symmetry is broken in the universe, the energy of the photon is under no obligation to remain constant over such timescales. Deal with it, the universe says. 

D.2 Cosmic Energy Conservation 395 
On timescales relevant to human activities, conservation of energy is extremely reliable. One way to put this is that the universe is 13.8 billion years old, or just over $10^{10}$ years. So in the course of a year, physics would allow an energy change by one part in 1010, or in the tenth decimal place. Generally, this is beyond our ability to distinguish, in practical circumstances. 
But violations are even more restricted than that. A photon streaming across the universe is in the grip of cosmic expansion and bears witness to associated energy changes. But a deposit of oil lying underground for 100 million years is chemically bound and not "grabbable" by universal expansion, so is not "degraded" by cosmic expansion. In the end, while we acknowledge that energy conservation is not strictly obeyed in our universe, it might as well be for all practical purposes. Thus, this section amounts to a tiny asterisk or caveat on the statement that energy is always conserved. 

## D.2.2 Convoluted Conservation 
This section follows a chain of energy conversions that starts before our own Sun was formed, and ends in a car wreck as a way to flesh out the manner in which energy is conserved, in practice. Don't worry about understanding every step, but absorb the overall theme that energy is changing from one form to the other throughout the process. 
A gas cloud in space collapses due to gravitational attraction, exchanging gravitational potential energy into kinetic energy as the gas particles race toward the center of the cloud. The cloud collapses into a tight ball and all that kinetic energy in the gas particles "thermalizes" through collisions,[^2] generating a hot ball of gas that is to become a star. As the ball of gas contracts more, additional gravitational potential energy is exchanged for thermal energy as the proto-star gets hotter. 
Eventually, particles in the core of the about-to-be star are moving so fast as they heat up 
that the electrical potential barrier3 is overcome so that protons can get close enough for the strong nuclear force to take over and permit nuclear fusion to occur, at which point we can call this thing a star. Four protons bond together, two of which convert to neutrons to form a helium nucleus. The total mass of the result is less than the summed mass of the inputs, the balance going into photons, or light 
energy. 
The photons eventually make it out of the opaque plasma of the star, and stream toward Earth, where a leaf absorbs the energy and cleverly converts it to chemical energy by rearranging atoms and electrons into sugars. The leaf falls off and eventually settles at the bottom of a shallow sea to be buried by sediments and ultimately becomes oil, preserving most of its chemical energy as it changes molecular form. 

[^2]: Thermal energy is nothing more than kinetic energy-fast motion-of individual particles at the microscopic scale. Thermal- izing means transferring energy into heat, or into randomized kinetic energy of parti- cles in the medium. 

[^3]: ... charge repulsion of two protons as their collision course brings them close to each other 

[^4]:... hydrogen nuclei 

[^5]: 
via E = mc2; see Sec. 15.3 (p. 246) 

[^6]: We call this photosynthesis. 

[^7]: To the extent that energy is "lost" in any of these exchanges-operating at < 100% efficiency-we should recognize that the missing energy just flows into other paths, generally into heat.

One day, a silly human digs up the oil and combusts it with oxygen, converting chemical energy to thermal energy in a contained fireball explosion. The thermal energy is used to produce kinetic energy of a piston in a cylinder, transmitted mechanically to wheels that in turn propel a car along a freeway. 
The car climbs a mountain, converting chemical energy in the fuel into gravitational potential energy via the same thermal-to-mechanical chain described above. Along the way, kinetic energy is given to the air, thermal energy is given to the environment by the hot engine, and brakes get hot as the kinetic energy of the car is converted to heat via friction as the car comes to a stop. But the car does not fully stop in time before tipping over a cliff and giving up its gravitational potential energy to kinetic energy as the car plummets and picks up speed. 
At the bottom, the crunch of the car ends up in bent metal, and heat. It does not explode, since this is not a movie. All the heat that was generated along the way ends up radiating to space as infrared radiation (photons), to stream across empty space-probably for all eternity. 
Tracing the energy we use for transportation back far enough, passes through oil, photosynthesis, sunlight, and nuclear fusion in the sun's core. Going back further, we recognize nuclear energy as deriving from gravitational energy of the collapsing material. What gave the atoms in the universe gravitational potential energy? The answer would have to be the Big Bang, truly arriving at the end (beginning) of the story.

## D.2.3 Lost to Heat 
The sequence in Section D.2.2 terminated in heat and infrared radiation. But let's flesh this out a bit, as heat is an almost-universal "endpoint" for energy flows. 
Since energy is conserved, whatever goes to heat does not truly disappear: the energy is still quantifiable, measurable energy. It is considered to be "low grade" energy because it is hard to make it do anything useful, unless the resulting temperature is significantly different from the surroundings. Sec. 6.4 (p. 88) discusses notable exceptions, wherein we derive substantial useful work from thermal energy in heat engines.[^10] For now, we just note that it is entropy that limits the use of thermal 
energy. 
When a book slides across a floor, it gives up its kinetic energy to heat caused by friction in the floor-book interface. When a car applies brakes and comes to a stop, a very similar process heats the brake pads and rotors. As a car speeds down the road, it stirs the air and also experiences friction in the axle/bearings and in the constant deformation of the tire as its round shape flattens on the road continuously. The stirred air swirls around in eddies that break up into progressively smaller ones until at the millimeter scale viscosity (friction) turns even this kinetic motion into randomized motion (heat).

[^10]: In this way, we can make an explosion or fireball do useful work as in dynamite, internal combustion, or a coal-fired power plant.

Human metabolism converts chemical energy from food into exportable mechanical work (lifting, moving, digging, etc.) at an efficiency of 20â€“ 25%. The rest is heat, which is conveniently used to maintain body temperature in most environments. But even most of the external work performed ends up as heat. The primary exception may be lifting masses to a higher location. Even this is temporary in the very long run,[^11] and the stored energy will ultimately flow into heat.

Light from our artificial sources and screens survives for a few nanosec- onds as photon energy, but eventually is absorbed onto surfaces and turns to heat. Some small fraction of our light escapes to space and carries non-thermal energy away, but this is incidental and could be said to represent poor design (not putting light where it is useful). 
Even devices whose job it is to cool things are net generators of heat. The air pushed out the back and bottom of a refrigerator is warm, as is the exhaust from an air conditioning unit. Virtually all energy pulled out of an electrical wall socket ends up as heat in the room in some way or another. A fan actually deposits a little bit of energy (heat) into the room, but feels cool to us only because the moving air enhances evaporation of water from our skin (perspiration), carrying energy away. 
Essentially the only exceptions to the heat fate of our energy expenditures is anything that we launch into space, like electromagnetic radiation (radio, light). This is a very tiny fraction of our energy expenditure, and can be quantitatively ignored. Most of our energy is from burning fossil fuels, which is an inherently thermal process. The part we salvage as useful energy itself tends to end up as heat after serving its intended. 
purpose.

In the end, most of the heat we generate on Earth's surface finds its way back to space as infrared radiation. All objects glow in the infrared, and once the radiation escapes our atmosphere it is gone from Earth forever. At this point, the energy is pretty well spent, so that we would not be able to profit from its use should we try to capture it.[^13] The energy that came from the universe returns there, as part of the dull, fading glow that lingers from the Big Bang.
