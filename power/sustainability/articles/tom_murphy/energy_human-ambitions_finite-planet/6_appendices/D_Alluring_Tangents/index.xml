      <description>&lt;p&gt;Sec. 4.1 (p. 54) built a step-wise scale out to the edge of the visible universe, which a margin note clarifies as the visible horizon of our universe. This fascinating and deep concept deserves elaboration.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Two foundations of experimental physics and cosmology are that the speed of light is finite, and the universe began in a Big Bang 13.8 billion years ago. Ample evidence supports of both claims. It should be noted that these notions were not at all accepted by scientists until the preponderance of evidence left little choice but to adopt them as how the world really appears to work.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Sec. 5.2 (p. 69) discussed the foundational principle of the conservation of energy, claiming that the principle is never violated except on cosmic scales. Besides elaborating on that point, this section follows the story of energy across vast spans of time as our sun forms and ultimately delivers energy to propel a car. We also clarify what it means for energy to be &amp;ldquo;lost&amp;rdquo; to heat.&#xA;393&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;d21-cosmological-exception&#34;&gt;D.2.1 Cosmological Exception&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Emmy Noether was a leading mathematician in the early twentieth century who also dabbled in physics. In a very profound insight, she recognized a deep connection between symmetries in nature and conservation laws. A symmetry, in this context, is a property that looks the same from multiple vantage points. For instance, a sphere is symmetric in that it looks the same from any angle. A cylinder or vase also has symmetry about one axis, but more limited than the sphere.&#xA;The symmetries Noether considered are more subtle symmetries in time, space, and direction.&#xA;Definition D.2.1 Symmetry in time means that physics behaves the same at all times: that the laws and constants are the same, and an experiment cannot be devised that would be able to determine absolute time.&#xA;Symmetry in space means that the laws of physics are the same no matter where one goes: fundamental experiments will not differ as a function of location.&#xA;Symmetry in direction is closely related to the previous one. It says that the universe (physical law) is the same in every direction.&#xA;The insight is that these symmetries imply conservation laws. Time symmetry dictates conservation of energy. Space symmetry leads to conservation of momentum. Directional symmetry results in conservation of angular momentum.&#xA;Great. As far as we know, the latter two are satisfied by our universe. To the best of our observational capabilities, the universe appears to be homogeneous (the same everywhere) and isotropic (the same in all directions). Yes, it&amp;rsquo;s clumpy with galaxies, but by &amp;ldquo;same,&amp;rdquo; we mean that physics appears to act the same way. Therefore, substantial observational evidence supports our adopting conservation of momentum and conservation of angular momentum as a fact of our reality.&#xA;But time symmetry is a problem, because the universe does not appear to be the same for all time. It appears to have emerged from a Big Bang (see Section D.1), and was therefore much different in the past than it is now, and continues to change/evolve. An experiment to measure the effective temperature of the Cosmic Microwave Background is enough to establish one&amp;rsquo;s place on the timeline of the cosmic unfolding.&#xA;As a consequence, conservation of energy is not strictly enforced over cosmological timescales. When a photon travels across the universe, it &amp;ldquo;redshifts,&amp;rdquo; as if its wavelength were being stretched along with the expansion of the universe. Longer wavelengths correspond to lower energy. Where did the photon&amp;rsquo;s energy go? Because time symmetry is broken in the universe, the energy of the photon is under no obligation to remain constant over such timescales. Deal with it, the universe says.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>D 3 Electrified Transport</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This section aims to answer the question: Why can&amp;rsquo;t we just14 electrify transportation and be done with fossil fuels? It turns out to be hard. Rather then rely on external studies, this section applies lessons from the book to demonstrate the power of first-principles quantitative&#xA;assessment.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;beware of the word &amp;ldquo;just,&amp;rdquo; often hiding lack of familiarity&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Box 13.3 (p. 212) indicated that direct drive of cars and airplanes from solar energy is impractical: while it may work in limited applications, solar power is too diffuse to power air and car travel as we know it.&#xA;Thus electrified transport becomes all about storage, generally in batteries. Several times in the book, the energy density of gasoline was compared to that of battery storage. In rough numbers, gasoline delivers about 11 kcal/g, working out to ~13 kWh/kg in units that will be useful to this discussion. Meanwhile, lithium-ion batteries characteristic of those found in cars15 have energy densities about one-hundred times&#xA;smaller.&#xA;This section will use the most optimistic energy density for lithium-ion batteries around 0.2 kWh/kg-which is about 65 times less than for gasoline. Offsetting this somewhat is the fact that electric drive can be as high as 90% efficient at delivering stored energy into mechanical energy, while the thermal conversion of fossil energy in large vehicles is more typically 25%. The net effect is roughly a factor of twenty16 difference in delivered energy per kilogram of fuel vs. storage.&#xA;The enormous mismatch in energy density between liquid fossil fuels and battery storage is the crux of the problem for transportation, the implications of which are explored here. We will start at the hard end, and work toward the easier.&#xA;D.3 Electrified Transport&#xA;398&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Some forms of alternative energy are tagged with asterisks in Table 10.1 (p. 166), indicating that they are not technically renewable, but will last a very long time so might as well be considered to be renewable.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Tidal energy, covered in Sec. 16.2 (p. 280), is one such entry that honestly does not deserve much attention. The text mentioned in passing that aggressive use of tidal energy has the power to push the moon away from Earth, providing the mechanism by which we could &amp;ldquo;use up&amp;rdquo; this resource. Curious students demanded an explanation. Even though it&amp;rsquo;s not of any practical importance, the physics is neat enough that the explanation can at least go in an appendix.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Sec. 8.1 (p. 114) took a sweeping view of humanity&amp;rsquo;s timeline as a useful lens through which to appreciate the very short age during which fossil fuels impart a substantial energy benefit. This section revisits this timewarping perspective in a slightly different way as a means to reflect on humanity&amp;rsquo;s far future.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;d51-success-vs-failure&#34;&gt;D.5.1 Success vs. Failure&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We start by noting that human civilization is about 10,000 years old, to the nearest order-of-magnitude.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Consider this question:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;[[408]]&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Can it work? Can humans create the institutions and uncorrupted global authority to regulate the entire biosphere-or at least the human interface to prevent unsustainable disruption to the rest? Is human nature compatible with such schemes? Do we have the discipline to deny ourselves easily reached resources for the good of the whole? Individual desires for &amp;ldquo;more&amp;rdquo; may always work to subvert sustainable practices. Individual lifetimes are so very short compared to the necessarily long-term considerations of success that it will be very hard to universally accept seemingly artificial restrictions generation after generation. Also unclear is whether it is possible to maintain a technological society preserving knowledge and history while living on the annual renewable resources of the planet. We simply have no guiding precedent for that mode of human existence.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
