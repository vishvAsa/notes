Sec. 8.1 (p. 114) took a sweeping view of humanity's timeline as a useful lens through which to appreciate the very short age during which fossil fuels impart a substantial energy benefit. This section revisits this time- warping perspective in a slightly different way as a means to reflect on humanity's far future. 

## D.5.1 Success vs. Failure 
We start by noting that human civilization is about 10,000 years old, to the nearest order-of-magnitude.[^45] Consider this question: 

> Is human civilization still in its infancy, or are we closer to the end than the beginning? 

Wow. Heavy question. Of course, we do not know the answer, but most of us would prefer to believe the first-that we are only beginning. So let's roll with that and explore the consequences. 

[^45]: This roughly marks the start of agri- culture, and in any case is far closer to the truth than the adjacent order-of-magnitude figures of 1,000 years or 100,000 years. 
 
In order for human civilization to be in its infancy, it would have to continue for at least 10,000 years more, if not far longer. What would it mean for us to still be operating "successfully" 10,000 years from now? Our physics and math approach actually allows us to place constraints! 

This discussion is limited to living on Earth. Chapter 4 laid out reasons why imagining a space-faring future may be misguided. But even ignoring these arguments, Chapter 1 illustrated that human growth ambitions would be brought to an end long before 10,000 years pass. In this light, it is most straightforward to concentrate on what it would take to succeed on Earth itself.4

If we manage to carry our civilization into the far future,4 comfortably call this success. If we don't, well, that would be failure. Can we sketch out what success looks like? One easy way to get there is to start enumerating the things that can't be carried into the far future. 

1. Fossil fuels will not power civilization: a large fraction of the initial inheritance has been spent in a short 200 years, 48 so that 10,000 years in the future it is safe to say they will be long gone. 
2. No steady annual decline of natural resources like forests, fisheries, fresh water, or species populations can be brooked. Allowing any component to decline would mean eventually losing that resource, which may be critical to our survival. 
3. Human population will not be allowed to grow. Even small growth rates will step up pressure on natural resources, and Earth can only support so much, long-term. Independent of what the "right" number is, once settled, we will not be able to dial it up without imperiling the hard-won success.
   [^49] 
4. Even under steady human population, any increase in resource use per person will also not be compatible. In general, growth leads to a dead end: to failure. 
5. Mining materials from the Earth will not continue at anything near the current pace. In the last few hundred years, the best deposits of copper, gold, aluminum, etc. have been found and exploited. Even if only 10% of the attainable resource has been consumed thus far,[^50] continuing for tens of thousands of years (and beyond) cannot be expected. 
6. Ultimately, any activity that draws down a finite natural resource will be impossible to sustain if the extraction rate is modest or high in relation to the initial resource abundance. Anything that can't last for well over 10,000 years is not a viable long-term solution and should not be exploited if success is the goal.+++(4)+++ Likewise, any pollutant that can build up to dangerous levels on even these very long timescales cannot be tolerated, if failure is to be avoided.

[^46]: Even if extending to other planets, the same logic will apply. 

[^47]: A useful definition might be uninter- rupted preservation of the knowledge and history gained thus far, without some apoc- alyptic collapse forcing a start-from-scratch revival to the extent that's even plausible. 

[^48]: 

[^49]: most of this in the last 50 years 
unlikely as high as 10 billion, and 
it could even be well less than a billion, depending on living standards 

[^50]:... author's conjecture; it could well be higher 

7. We can use the rule of 70 to say that anything having a doubling time (or halving-time in the case of depletion) shorter than 10,000 years is a no-go for success on these timescales, meaning that any activity impacting resources would have to be held to a growth rate or depletion rate of less than 0.007% per year, which is essentially zero-growth. 

It becomes clear that long-term success is practically synonymous with the word sustainable. Any practice that is not long-term sustainable will fail to continue.[^51] We therefore cannot depend on any non-sustainable resource if we strive for success. 

[[406]] 

[^51]: Any activity today not geared to contribute to ultimate success (true sustainability) is therefore likely only contributing to failure. Most activities today are in the latter category, alarmingly. 

## D.5.2 Sustainable Living 
Imagine that you have a stash of $100,000 tucked under your mattress, and that you have figured out a way to live on $20,000 per year. You could decide to live on this fund for five years, and then figure out later how to keep going. Perhaps this is not the wisest move. A smarter move would be to figure out how long you expect to live-maybe 50 more years and ration out the fund, allowing $2,000 per year. You'll still need a job earning $18,000 per year to meet the $20,000 annual goal. Maybe the smartest move would be to ignore the money under the mattress and get a job for $20,000 per year. [^52] Now you have the safety of resources should you need it, and can even pass it along down the generations to kids and grandkids who have also been taught not to use it, but to survive on their annual income. 

The analogy is clear, and perhaps it is also clear why we did not allow interest accumulation, as many of Earth's resources are one-time endowments that do not spontaneously grow larger.[^53] If our human civilization succeeds at surviving uninterrupted for 10,000 years, it will necessarily be because we figured out how to live on the annual income[^54] provided by Earth's natural renewable flows, rather than on the inheritance in the form of finite resources that are not replenished. In other words, humanity needs to learn to refrain from any dependence on one-time resources (the inheritance). 

Success, therefore, puts humans as a part of nature, not apart from nature. Anything else is failure. The closer we are to nature, the more likely we are to succeed. 

Nature prepared a biosphere that has stood the test of time. Natural selection has operated to eliminate non-viable solutions and create inter- dependencies cleverly balanced in a stable equilibrium of sorts. Elements of modern human civilization-our cities, agricultural practices, fossil fuel dependence-have not withstood the test of time, nor can they. Which system would be the wiser bet for long-term survival: the well adapted natural world, or the artificial world humans have erected and operated for a few dozen decades-without attention to sustainable principles? The answer seems obvious. 

[^52]:  hardly different from $18,000 per year, so if you're going this far already, why not? 

[^53]: Interest is an artificial construct made possble by accelerating resource use. 

[^54]: Annual income would be in the form of solar energy delivered and biomass that has grown in the course of the year, for instance.

## D.5.3 Time to grow up
In a sense, humanity is going through an awkward adolescent phase: growth spurts, a factory (pimple) strewn landscape, an attitude that we have all the answers - adults[^55] can't possibly understand or tell us what to do.

[^55]: ... in this case hypothetical wise humans who have managed a successful transition through the adolescent phase

Conversely, nature is mature.[^56] Ignoring recent human influences, it had already forged its complex, never perfect, but functional interdependencies and had settled into something resembling a steady state.

[^56]: Note the similarity of the words!

Adolescents new to the scene may be hugely disruptive and destructive, and unless they change their ways, civilization drives straight into the jaws of failure. The adolescents lack the wisdom to build lasting systems that will have the privilege of co-existing with nature for very long.

In human society, most adolescents become adults who learn to live within their means. Sometimes this involves sacrifices or perhaps selecting a diet based on nutrition and health rather than what might be most tasty.[^57] Likewise, humankind needs to define a scale for its activities that fits within nature's capacity to replenish, so that each subsequent generation is not deprived of resources the previous ones enjoyed. At present, civilization is nowhere close to this operating principle.

## D.5.4 Frameworks
Humanity needs to develop a framework by which to evaluate its activities and ask whether each helps or hurts ultimate human success. Sometimes this might produce jarring results. Consider, for instance, a cure for cancer or other advances that might extend human lifetimes. Only if balanced against a smaller population or a smaller resource utilization per capita could such seemingly positive developments be accommodated once a steady equilibrium is established. Otherwise, total demand on Earth's resources goes up if the same number of people live longer at a fixed annual resource utilization per living person. In a successful world, any proposed new activity would have to demonstrate how it fits within a sustainable framework.+++(5)+++ Ignoring the issue would irresponsibly imperil overall long-term human happiness.[^58]

At some level, humans need to realize that success means the thriving of not only themselves, but all of Earth's precious irreplaceable species and ecosystems. Without them, humans cannot be successful anyway. This is another part of maturing: many adolescents have difficulty considering the impacts of their actions on anyone other than themselves. Humans need to realize that hurting any component of Earth is hurting humans, long-term. Our legal system affords rights to humans, but gives no agency to plants, animals, or even non-living features of our planet. A successful future must give voice to every element of our world, lest we trample it and rue the day.

[^58]: In such cases, the outcome may ulti- mately settle on longer lives for fewer peo- ple.
