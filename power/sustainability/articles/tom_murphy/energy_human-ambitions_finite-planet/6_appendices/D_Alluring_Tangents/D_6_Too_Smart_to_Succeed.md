Can it work? Can humans create the institutions and uncorrupted global authority to regulate the entire biosphere-or at least the human interface to prevent unsustainable disruption to the rest? Is human nature compatible with such schemes? Do we have the discipline to deny ourselves easily reached resources for the good of the whole? Individual desires for "more" may always work to subvert sustainable practices. Individual lifetimes are so very short compared to the necessarily long-term considerations of success that it will be very hard to universally accept seemingly artificial restrictions generation after generation. Also unclear is whether it is possible to maintain a technological society preserving knowledge and history while living on the annual renewable resources of the planet. We simply have no guiding precedent for that mode of human existence.

It is therefore an open question whether a technological society is even compatible with planetary limits. Are modern humans just a passing phase whose creations will crumble into oblivion in a geological blink, or can we stick it out in something other than a primitive state? We again have no evidence[^59] one way or another. The current state of apparent success cannot be taken as a meaningful proof-of-concept, because it was achieved at the expense of finite resources in a shockingly short time: an extravagant party funded by the great one-time inheritance.+++(4)+++ The aftermath is only beginning to appear.

[^59]: See Sec. 18.4 (p. 312) on the Fermi paradox for a worrisome-albeit inconclusive- lack of evidence of success in the universe.

We have a choice: work toward success-hoping and assuming that it is indeed possible; or acquiesce to failure. It seems that if we are not wise enough to know whether long-term success is even possible, the responsible course of action would be to assume that we can succeed, and do what we can to maximize our chances of arriving there. When should we start? Again-without knowing any better-the sooner we start, the more likely we are to succeed. Any delay is another way of driving ourselves toward a more likely failure. 

This section pairs nicely with Section D.5, taking a slightly different perspective on the prospect of future success. [^60] 

[^60]: After all, advantages make survival and procreation more likely.

Evolution works incrementally by random experimentation: mutations that either confer advantages or disadvantages to the organism. Advantages are then naturally selected to propagate to future generations," while disadvantages are phased out by failure of afflicted organisms in competition for resources and mates. Evolution is slow, and hard to spot from one generation to the next. When a common ancestor of the hippo evolved into whales, the nose did not suddenly disappear from the face to end up behind the head as a blow-hole, but took a tortuously long adaptive route to its present configuration. 

[[409]] 

Intelligence confers obvious advantages to organisms, able to "out-smart" competition to find resources, evade dangers, and adapt to new situations. It also has some cost in terms of energy resources devoted to a larger brain. But multiple organisms from across the animal kingdom have taken advantage of the "smart" niche: octopuses, ravens, dolphins, and apes to name a few. Experiments reveal the ability of these species to solve novel, brainy puzzles in order to get at food, for instance. 

Like other attributes, intelligence would not be expected to arrive suddenly, but would incrementally improve. Humans are justified in appraising themselves as the most intelligent being yet on the planet. 

So here's the thing. The first species smart enough to exploit fossil fuels will do so with reckless abandon. Evolution did not skip steps and create a wise being-despite the fact that the sapiens in our species name[^62] means wise. A wise being would recognize early on the damage inherent in profligate use of fossil fuels[^63] and would have refrained from unfettered exploitation. 

Put another way, the first species entertaining the notion that they are able to outsmart nature is in for a surprise. Earth's evolutionary web of life is dumb: it has no intelligence at all. But it exists in this universe on the strength of billions of years of tested success. All the random experiments along the way that were unworkable got weeded out. The vast majority of species around today have checked the box for long-term viability. 

Modern humans-those who have moved beyond hunter-gatherer lifestyles, anyway- represent an exceedingly short-lived experiment in evolutionary terms. This is especially true for the fossil fuel era of the last few centuries. It would be premature to declare victory. The jury is still out on whether civilization is compatible with nature and planetary limits, as explored in Section D.5. 

Evolution does not avoid mistakes. In fact, it is built upon and derives its awesome power precisely because of those few mistakes that somehow escape the more likely failed outcomes and find advantage in the mistake.[^64] Maybe humans are one of those more typical evolutionary mistakes that will culminate in the usual failure, as so often happens. The fact that we're here and smart says nothing about our chances for long-term success. Indeed, humankind's demonstrated ability to produce unintended global adverse consequences would suggest that success is less than a safe bet.

It seems fairly clear that hunter-gatherer humans could have continued essentially indefinitely on the planet. And the brains of hunter-gatherer Homo sapiens are indistinguishable from those of modern humans. So intelligence by itself is not enough to cross the line into existential peril, if continuing to operate within and as a part of natural ecosystems.  

[^61]: Intelligence is not the only sort of ad- vantage, and can easily lose to tooth and claw, or even mindless microscopic threats: nature has devised many ways to "win." 

[^62]: ... self-assigned flattery 

[^63]: Not only is climate change a problem, but building an entire civilization depen- dent on a finite energy resource and also en- abling a widespread degradation of natural ecosystems seems like an amateur blunder. 

[^64]: Since mutations are random mistakes, and some actually, surprisingly, turn out to be advantageous, one might say that life is a giant pile of mistakes that failed to de- liver the expected bad outcomes, snatching success from the jaws of failure.

[[410]]

But once that intelligence is applied toward creating artificial environments[^65] that no longer adhere to the ways of nature once we make our own rules as we "outsmart" nature we run a grave risk as nature and evolution cease to protect us. 

[^65]:..e.g., agriculture, cities

In other words, a species that lives completely within the relationships established by the same evolutionary pressures that created that species is operating on firm ground: well adapted and likely to succeed, having stood the test of time.[^66] 

Once we part ways with nature and create our own reality—our own rules-survival is no longer as guaranteed. Even 10,000 years is not enough time to prove the concept, when human evolution works on much longer timescales. This is especially true for the fossil fuel world, being mere centuries old. Nature will be patient while our fate unfolds.+++(4)+++ 

The situation is similar to establishing a habitat on the lunar surface: an artificial environment to provision our survival in an otherwise deadly setting. The resources that were available to construct the habitat are not continually provided by the lunar environment, just as the fossil fuels and mined resources and forests are not continually re-supplied[^67] deplete them. Just because the habitat could be built does not mean it can be maintained indefinitely. Likewise, the world we know today-being rather different from anything that nature prepared-may be a one-off that proves to be unsustainable in the long run. 

as we 

Since evolution is incremental, we cannot expect to have been made wise enough to avoid the pitfalls of being just smart enough to exploit planetary resources. And being slow, it seems unlikely that wisdom will evolve fast enough to interrupt our devastating shopping spree. It is possible[^68] that we can install an "artificial" wisdom by using our intelligence to adopt values and global rules by which to ensure a sustainable existence. Probably most smart people assume that we can do so. Maybe. But living in a collective is difficult. Wisdom may exist in a few individuals, but bringing the entire population around to enlightened, nuanced thinking that values nature and the far future more than they value themselves and the present seems like a stretch.

[^66]: Since evolution is slow, any species has
a reasonably long track record of success behind it.

[^67]: Forests can grow back, but not at the rate of their destruction at present.

[^68]: What hope we have lies here, and pro- vides the underlying motivation for writing this book. The first step is appreciating in full the gravity of the challenge ahead.

One way to frame the question: 

- Are humans collectively capable of leaving most shelves stocked with treats, within easy reach, while refraining from consuming them, generation after generation?  
- Do we have the discipline to value a distant and unknown future more than we value ourselves and our own time? 

Successful non-human species have never had to answer this question, but neither has any species been smart enough—until we came along to develop the capability to steal all the goodies from the future and, in so doing, jeopardize their own success.[^69] 

[^69]: Success here means preserving civiliza- tion. It is far easier-and perhaps more likely to at least survive as a species in a more primitive, natural state.

## D.6.1 Evolution's Biggest Blunder? 
As a brief follow-on, we framed evolution as a mistake-machine, sometimes accidentally producing functionally advantageous incremental improvements. Countless species adapt in ways that are not able to survive long term, and die off. So those "blunders" are inconsequential failed experiments. Evolution is indifferent to failure, being a mechanism rather than a sentient entity.

But most of the time, these failures are isolated, bearing little consequence on the wider world. Did anybody notice the three-dotted bark slug[^70] disappear? If the human species turns out to be another of evolution's failed experiments-having made a creature too smart to stay within the lanes of nature is it just another inconsequential blunder? 

Unfortunately, it may turn out to be a rather costly blunder, if the failed species creates a mass extinction as part of its own failure. By changing the climate and habitat on the planet, we have already terminated or imperiled a number of species, and are nowhere near finished yet. Mass extinctions have happened many times through history, but seldom due to an evolutionary blunder. We may yet distinguish ourselves! 

It is true that cyanobacteria transformed the climate starting about 2.5 billion years ago by pumping oxygen into the atmosphere. Called the Great Oxygenation Event, this precipitated the first-known mass extinction on the planet-essentially poisoning the simple anaerobic lifeforms that existed until that time. But we would hesitate to call it an unmitigated disaster, as it paved the way for multi-cellular life?1 in all the richness we see today. So accidental? Yes. Blunder? Okay. Disastrous? Let's say no, on balance.[^72] 

The most recent mass extinction, 65 Myr ago, was caused by an asteroid impact, and the two before that appear to be connected to volcanic activity. The two prior to these are mixed: the first appears to have been caused by geological processes, and the next by a changing climate likely connected to diversification of land-based plants. And that's it, since the much earlier cyanobacteria oxygenation event. Only one of the five is likely attributable to evolution itself—and in this case not the fault of a single species. 

A human-caused mass extinction could pave the way to whole new modes of lifeforms. But it was much easier in the early days to break new ground. It seems much less likely that a human-induced mass extinction will unleash a fantastic evolutionary richness hitherto unexplored. That leaves only downside, and the ignominious distinction of being the one species that evolution would most regret, if ever it could. 

Please, please, please let this tragic fate not come to pass! 

[^70]: totally made up 

[^71]: .although it took over a billion years to get there: no instant gratification 

[^72]: The anaerobic life would disagree, but when do we ever listen to them anymore? In any case, the result was tremendous bio-diversity, which ultimately may be a decent figure of merit for value in this world.
