  <meta property="og:description" content="Imagery from the groundbreaking movie The Matrix, by J. Rue.
This book has explored the energy surge of the last 150 years, largely casting it as a story of fossil fuels. Combining the finite nature of fossil fuels with their environmental cost makes it clear that we cannot expect fossil fuels to carry us into the indefinite future-and the sooner we transition away, the better. We have explored aspects of the chief alternatives in the preceding chapters. This chapter gathers key results.">

  <p>Imagery from the groundbreaking movie The Matrix, by J. Rue.</p>
<p>This book has explored the energy surge of the last 150 years, largely casting it as a story of fossil fuels. Combining the finite nature of fossil fuels with their environmental cost makes it clear that we cannot expect fossil fuels to carry us into the indefinite future-and the sooner we transition away, the better. We have explored aspects of the chief alternatives in the preceding chapters. This chapter gathers key results.</p>
<p>One striking realization is that no fundamentally new energy technologies have emerged in the last half-century. Hydroelectricity, nuclear fission, wind, and solar photovoltaics, had all been invented. Fusion has been in the research phase the entire time. It would be unwise to expect a miraculous new entry into the field of energy-a knight in shining armor.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> It is not as though scientists and engineers have not prioritized energy research: energy has been recognized as a lynchpin of modern life all this time. The peak of U.S. oil production in 1970 followed by two global oil crises that decade served as a wake-up call. Alarm bells have been ringing over climate change almost the entire time. Interest has been keen, and many ideas<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> have been entertained. Scratching our heads to generate more ideas is not so promising at this stage.</p>
<p>Perhaps, then, the table is set. We know the actors. We know the pros and cons, having many decades of experience with each of the technologies. Where does this leave us? This chapter<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> aims to pull it all together to take stock. The chapters to follow will begin to address how we might move forward in light of our predicament.</p>
<h2 id="171-the-alternative-energy-matrix">17.1 The Alternative Energy Matrix</h2>
<p>In exploring potential replacements for fossil energy, it soon becomes apparent that fossil fuels are unparalleled in many respects. [[290]] Even though viewed as a source of energy from the ground, fossil fuels are perhaps more aptly described as nearly perfect energy storage media, at energy densities that are orders of magnitude higher than anything achieved thus far in the best available battery technology. The storage is nearly perfect because it is reasonably safe, not especially corrosive, easy to transport<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>, lightweight yet dense enough to work in airplanes (see Box 17.1), and indefinitely storable-indeed, for millions of years-without loss of energy. No alternative storage technique can boast all the same benefits, be it batteries, flywheels, hydrogen, or ethanol.</p>
<details><summary>Box 17.1: Electric Airplanes?</summary>
<p>Box 13.3 (p. 212) demonstrated that an airplane receiving solar energy in ideal conditions could gather only 4% of the power typical of a cruising airliner, and would not be able to get off the ground on direct solar input. But what about battery storage?</p>
<p>The best lithium-ion batteries store 0.17 kcal/g, which is 65 times less energy-dense than gasoline, at ~11 kcal/g. A Boeing 737-the workhorse of the airline industry-has an empty weight around 35 tons, and accommodates about 15 tons of fuel and 15 tons of passengers/cargo. A comparable energy storage in the form of batteries—even allowing a factor of three difference in thermal efficiency<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup> versus electric efficiency-would take 300 tons of battery: far in excess of the entire plane&rsquo;s maximum takeoff weight. Or the airplane could just accept a reduced range by a factor of 20: down to 200 km. Recharge time could easily exceed flight time. It&rsquo;s not the same. See Sec. D.3 (p. 397) for additional analysis.
This chapter aims to build a relatively complete list of ways in which we might tap into Earth&rsquo;s various energy flows and stores (as in Table 10.2; p. 168), most of which have been addressed in some detail in Chapters 11-16.</p>
</details>
<p>In order to make comparisons, it is helpful to create a matrix of energy source properties so that the relative strengths and weaknesses of each are obvious at a glance. (See Figures 17.1 and 17.2.) The matrix is presented as a color-coded figure based on 10 different criteria.<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup> Blue, yellow, and red can be loosely interpreted as good, neutral, and deficient, respectively. Yellow boxes are often accompanied by brief reasons for their neutrality—the reasons for blue or red extremes often being obvious. While some criteria are quantitative, many are subjective. The following 10 properties are assessed for this comparison.</p>
<p>[[291]]</p>
<ul>
<li>Abundance. Not all ideas, however clever or practical, can scale to meet the needs of modern society. Hydroelectric power cannot expand beyond about 10% of current global demand, while the solar potential reaching Earth&rsquo;s surface is easily calculated to exceed this benchmark by a factor of about 5,000.+++(5)+++ Abundant sources are coded blue, while niche ideas like hydroelectricity that cannot conceivably fulfill a quarter of global demand are colored red. Intermediate players that can satisfy a substantial fraction of demand are coded yellow.</li>
<li>Difficulty. This field tries to capture the degree to which a resource brings with it large technical challenges. How many PhDs does it take to run the plant? How intensive is it to maintain an operational state? This one might translate into economic terms: difficulty serves as a crude proxy for expensive.</li>
<li>Intermittency. Colored blue if the source is rock-steady or available whenever it is needed. If the availability is beyond our control, then it gets a yellow at least. The possibility of substantial underproduction for a few days earns red.</li>
<li>Storage can offset this concern, at increased cost. Seasonal storage is particularly impractical, which hampers solar resources.</li>

<li>Heat. Can the resource produce direct heat? Colored yellow if only via electric means.</li>
<li>Transport. Does the technology relieve the looming decline in oil production? Anything that makes electricity can power an electric car, earning a yellow score. Liquid fuels are blue.

</ul>
<p>Environmental impact has no column in this matrix, although the &ldquo;acceptance&rdquo; measure captures some of this. Climate change is an obvious negative for fossil fuels, but not so much as to have resulted in curtailed global demand thus far (see Fig. 8.2; p. 118). None of the alternatives presented here contribute directly to carbon dioxide emissions, earning an added advantage for all entries.</p>
<p>[[292]]</p>
<p>Each energy source can be assigned a crude numerical score, adding one point for each blue box, no points for yellow boxes, and deducting a point for each red box. Certainly this is an imperfect scoring scheme, giving each criterion equal weight, but it provides some means of comparing and ranking sources. (9: See Section 17.3 for an alternate approach.)</p>

<p>Figure 17.1: Fossil fuel matrix of attributes. Blue is good (+1 point); yellow is neutral (0 points).</p>
<p>The conventional fossil fuels each score 7-8 out of 10 possible points by this scheme, displayed on the right side of Figure 17.1. Some attribute ratings are divided into heating versus electricity production for a few of the scoring categories.</p>
<p>The overall impression conveyed by this graphic is that fossil fuels perform rather well in almost all criteria. Because fossil fuels collectively supply about 80% of global energy usage, they are each classified as having intermediate abundance. But even this is not a permanent condition-providing significant motivation for exploring alternatives in the first place. Getting energy out of fossil fuels is trivially easy. Being free of intermittency problems, fully demonstrated, and versatile enough to provide heat, electricity, and transportation fuel, fossil fuels have been embraced by society and are frequently used directly in homes. Efficiency for anything but direct heat is middling, typically registering 15–25% for automotive engines and 30-40% for power plants.+++(4)+++</p>
<p>The commonly discussed alternative energy approaches display a wider range of ratings. Immediately, some overall trends are clear in Figure 17.2. Very few options are both abundant and easy. Solar photovoltaic (PV) and solar thermal are the only exceptions.+++(4)+++ A similar exclusion principle often holds for abundant and demonstrated/available again satisfied only by solar PV and solar thermal. This uncommon combination plays a large role in the popularity and promise of solar power.</p>
<p>Intermittency mainly plagues solar and wind resources, although many natural sources (hydroelectric, tidal, wave, biofuels) present mild inconvenience due to intermittency.</p>
<p>Electricity is easy to produce, resulting in many options. Since the easiest and cheapest will likely be picked first, the less convenient forms of electricity production are less likely to be exploited.<sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup></p>
<p>Transportation needs are hard to satisfy. Together with the fact that oil production will peak before natural gas or coal, transportation may appear as the foremost problem to address. Electric cars are an obvious albeit expensive solution.</p>

<p>Figure 17.2: Alternative energy matrix of attributes. Blue is good (+1 point); yellow is neutral (0 points), and red is bad (-1 point). Only green-labeled entries contribute more than a few gigawatts to our energy today, out of the 18,000 GW total. This comparison is meant to help differentiate attractive directions for future energy implementation.</p>
<p>Besides being unclear how we might all afford<sup id="fnref:10"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">10</a></sup> electric cars, the technology has a number of drawbacks relative to fossil fuels and does not lend itself to air travel or heavy shipping by land or sea (see Sec. D.3; p. 397).</p>
<p>A car filling its gasoline tank is transferring energy at an astounding rate of 15 MW, equivalent to 3,000 homes running air conditioning. Limited range and slow charge times<sup id="fnref:11"><a href="#fn:11" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">11</a></sup> do not permit electric transport to simply replace transportation as we currently know it.</p>
<p>Few of the options face serious barriers to acceptance, especially when energy scarcity is at stake. Some energy sources are available for individual implementation, allowing distributed power generation as opposed to centralized resources. For example, a passive solar home having PV panels, wind power, and some method to produce liquid fuels on-site would satisfy most domestic energy needs in a self-sufficient manner.+++(5)+++</p>
<p>Cost is not directly represented in the matrix, although the difficulty rating may serve as an imperfect proxy. In general, the alternative methods have difficulty competing against cheap fossil fuels. It is not yet clear whether the requisite prosperity needed to afford a more expensive energy future at today&rsquo;s scale will be forthcoming, as prosperity historically has been closely tied to the availability of natural resources, and these are precisely what our populated planet strains the most.</p>

<h2 id="172-tally-for-individual-alternative-sources">17.2 Tally for Individual Alternative Sources</h2>
<p>A single chapter cannot adequately detail the myriad complex considerations that went into the matrix in Figure 17.2. The previous chapters address a number of the considerations, but many of the quantitative and qualitative aspects for each were developed at the Do the Math website. The key qualities of each resource in relation to the matrix criteria are discussed in this section, focusing especially on less obvious characteristics.</p>
<h3 id="solar-pv">Solar PV</h3>
<p>(Sec. 13.3; p. 201): Covering just 0.4% of Earth&rsquo;s land area with PV panels that are 15% efficient satisfies global annual energy demand, qualifying solar PV as abundant. PV panels are being produced globally in excess of 100 gigawatts (GW) peak capacity per year,<sup id="fnref:12"><a href="#fn:12" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">12</a></sup> demonstrating a low degree of difficulty. Most people do not object to solar PV on rooftops or over parking areas, or even in open spaces. Solar panels are well suited to individual operation and maintenance.</p>
<p>Intermittency is the Achilles&rsquo; heel of solar PV, requiring storage solutions if adopted on a large scale. To illustrate the difficulty of storage, a lead-acid battery large enough to provide the United States with adequate backup power would require more lead than is estimated to be accessible in the world and would cost approximately $60 trillion at today&rsquo;s price of lead <sup id="fnref:13"><a href="#fn:13" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">13</a></sup>. Lithium or nickel-based batteries fare no better on cost or abundance. Pumped storage is limited by a small number of suitable locales.</p>
<h3 id="solar-thermal">Solar Thermal</h3>
<p>(Sec. 13.8.2; p. 219): Achieving comparable efficiency to PV but using more land area, the process of generating electricity from concentrated solar thermal energy has no problem qualifying as abundant—although somewhat more regionally constrained. It is relatively low-tech: shiny curved mirrors, tracking on (often) one axis, heat up oil or a similar fluid to drive a standard heat engine. Intermittency can be mitigated by storing thermal energy, perhaps even for a few days. A number of plants are already in operation, producing cost-competitive electricity. Public acceptance is no worse than for PV, but the technology generally must be implemented in large, centralized facilities.</p>
<h3 id="solar-heating">Solar Heating</h3>
<p>(Sec. 13.8.1; p. 218): On a smaller scale, heat collected directly from the sun can provide domestic hot water and home heating. In the latter case, this can be as simple as a south-facing window. Capturing and using solar heat effectively is not particularly difficult, coming down to plumbing, insulation, and ventilation control.</p>
<p>Technically, solar heating potential might be abundant, but since it is usually restricted to building footprints (roof, windows), it gets a yellow rating. Solar heating does not lend itself to electricity generation or transport, but it has no difficulty being accepted and almost by definition is a backyard-ready technology.</p>
<p>[[295]]</p>
<h3 id="hydroelectric">Hydroelectric</h3>
<p>(Chapter 11): Despite impressive efficiency, hydroelectric potential is already well-developed in the world and is destined to remain a sub-dominant player on the scale of today&rsquo;s energy use. It has seasonal intermittency,<sup id="fnref:14"><a href="#fn:14" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">14</a></sup> does not directly provide heat or transport, and can only rarely be implemented on a personal scale. Acceptance is fairly high, although silting and associated dangers - together with habitat destruction and the forced displacement of people-do cause some opposition to expansion and have resulted in removal of some hydroelectric facilities.</p>
<h3 id="biofuels-from-algae">Biofuels from Algae</h3>
<p>(Sec. 14.3.2; p. 234): Because algae capture solar energy-even at less than 5% efficiency-the potential energy scale is enormous.<sup id="fnref:15"><a href="#fn:15" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">15</a></sup> Challenges include keeping the plumbing clean, possible infection,<sup id="fnref:16"><a href="#fn:16" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">16</a></sup> contamination by other species, and so on. At present, no algal sample that secretes the desired fuels has been identified or engineered. No one knows whether genetic engineering will succeed at creating a suitable organism. Otherwise, the ability to provide transportation fuel is the big draw. Heat may also be efficiently produced, but electricity production would represent a misallocation of precious liquid fuel+++(4)+++.</p>
<h3 id="geothermal-electricity">Geothermal Electricity</h3>
<p>(Sec. 16.1; p. 275): This option makes sense primarily at rare geological hotspots. It will not scale to be a significant part of our entire energy mix. Aside from this, it is relatively easy, steady, and well demonstrated in many locations. It can provide electricity, and obviously direct heat although often far from locations demanding heat.</p>
<h3 id="wind">Wind</h3>
<p>(Chapter 12): Wind is neither super-abundant nor scarce, being one of those options that can meet a considerable fraction of present needs under large-scale development <sup id="fnref:17"><a href="#fn:17" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">17</a></sup>. Implementation is relatively straightforward, reasonably efficient, and demonstrated the world over in large wind farms. The biggest downside is intermittency. It is not unusual to have little or no regional input for several days in a row. Objections to wind tend to be more serious than for many other alternatives. Wind turbines are noisy and tend to be located in prominent places (ridgetops, coastlines) where their high degree of visibility alters scenery. Wind remains viable for small-scale personal use.</p>
<h3 id="artificial-photosynthesis">Artificial Photosynthesis</h3>
<p>Combining the abundance of direct solar input with the self-storing flexibility of liquid fuel, artificial photosynthesis is a compelling future possibility <sup id="fnref:18"><a href="#fn:18" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">18</a></sup>. Being able to store the resulting liquid fuel for many months means that intermittency is eliminated to the extent that annual production meets demand. A panel in sunlight dripping liquid fuel could satisfy both heating and transportation needs. Electricity can also be produced, but given an abundance of ways to make electricity, the liquid fuels would be misallocated if used in this way. Unfortunately, an adequate form of artificial photosynthesis has yet to be demonstrated in the laboratory, although the U.S. Department of Energy initiated a large program in 2010 toward this goal.</p>
<p>[[296]]</p>
<h3 id="tidal-power">Tidal Power</h3>
<p>(Sec. 16.2; p. 280): Restricted to select coastal locations, tidal power will never be a large contributor to global energy. The resource is intermittent on daily and monthly scales but in a wholly predictable manner. Extracting tidal energy is not terribly hard-the efficient technology is similar to that found in hydroelectric installations and has been demonstrated in a number of locations around the world.</p>
<h3 id="conventional-fission">Conventional Fission</h3>
<p>(Sec. 15.4.4; p. 255): Using conventional uranium reactors and conventional mining practices, nuclear fission does not have the legs for a marathon. On the other hand, it is certainly well demonstrated and has no intermittency problems-except that it cannot accommodate intermittency on the demand side (variable load). Compared to other options, nuclear power qualifies as a high-tech approach-meaning that design, construction, operation, and emergency mitigation require more advanced training and sophistication than the average energy producer.</p>
<p>Acceptance is mixed. Germany and Japan plan to phase out their nuclear programs by 2022 and the 2030s, respectively, despite being serious about CO2 reduction. Public unease also contributed to a halt in licensing new reactors in the United States from 1978-2012. Some opposition stems from unwarranted-yet no less real-fear, sustained in part by the technical complexity of the subject. But some opposition relates to political difficulty surrounding proliferation and the onerous radioactive waste problem that no country has yet solved to satisfaction.</p>
<h3 id="uranium-breeder">Uranium Breeder</h3>
<p>(Sec. 15.4.4.2; p. 258): Extending nuclear fission to use plutonium synthesized from 238U, which is 140 times more abundant than 235U, gives uranium fission the legs to run for at least centuries if not a few millennia, ameliorating abundance issues. Breeding has been practiced in military reactors, and indeed some significant fraction of the power in conventional uranium reactors comes from incidental synthesis of plutonium (239Pu) from 238U. But no commercial power plant has been built to deliberately tap the bulk of uranium for power production. Public acceptance of breeder reactors will face even higher hurdles because plutonium is more easily separated into bomb material than is 235U, and the increase in radioactive waste from an expansion of nuclear power causes trouble.</p>
<h3 id="thorium-breeder">Thorium Breeder</h3>
<p>(Box 15.5; p. 260): Thorium is more abundant than uranium and only has one natural isotope,<sup id="fnref:19"><a href="#fn:19" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">19</a></sup> qualifying it as an abundant resource. Like all nuclear options, thorium reactors fall into the high-tech camp and include new challenges<sup id="fnref:20"><a href="#fn:20" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">20</a></sup> that conventional reactors have not faced. A few small-scale demonstrations have been carried out, but nothing in the commercial realm; bringing thorium reactors online at scale is probably a few decades away, if it happens at all. Public reaction will likely be similar to that for conventional nuclear: not a deal breaker, but some resistance on similar grounds. It is not clear whether the novelty of thorium will be greeted with suspicion or enthusiasm.</p>
<p>[[297]]</p>
<p>Although thorium also represents a breeding technology (making fissile 233 U from 232Th), the proliferation aspect is severely diminished for thorium due to a highly radioactive 232U by-product<sup id="fnref:21"><a href="#fn:21" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">21</a></sup> and virtually no easily separable plutonium.</p>
<h3 id="geothermal-heating-allowing-depletion">Geothermal Heating allowing Depletion</h3>
<p>(Sec. 16.1.2; p. 277): A vast store of thermal energy sits in Earth&rsquo;s crust, permeating the rock and moving slowly outward. Ignoring sustainable aims, boreholes could be drilled a few kilometers down to extract thermal energy out of the rock faster than the geophysical replacement rate, effectively mining heat as a one-time resource. In the absence of water flow to distribute heat, dry rock will deplete its heat within 5-10 meters of the borehole in a matter of a few years, requiring another hole 10 m away from the previous, in repeated fashion. The recurrent large-scale drilling operation across the land qualifies this technique as moderately difficult.</p>
<p>The temperatures are marginal for running heat engines to make electricity with any respectable efficiency,<sup id="fnref:22"><a href="#fn:22" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">22</a></sup> but at least the thermal resource will not suffer intermittency problems during the time that a given hole is still useful. Kilometer-scale drilling hurdles have prevented this technique from being demonstrated at geologically normal (inactive) sites. Public acceptance may be less than lukewarm given the scale of drilling involved, dealing with tailings and possibly groundwater contamination issues on a sizable scale. While a backyard might accommodate a borehole, it would be far more practical to use the heat for clusters of buildings rather than for just one given the effort and lifetime associated with each hole.</p>
<h3 id="geothermal-heating-steady-state">Geothermal Heating, Steady State</h3>
<p>(Sec. 16.1.1; p. 276): Sustainable extraction of geothermal heat-replenished by radioactive decay within the Earth offers far less total potential, coming to about 13 TW of flow if summed across all land. And to get to temperatures hot enough to be useful for heating purposes, boreholes at least 1 km deep would be required. It is tremendously challenging to cover any significant fraction of land area with thermal collectors 1 km deep. As a result, a yellow score for the abundance factor may be generous. To gather enough steady-flow heat to provide for a normal U.S. home&rsquo;s heating demand, the collection network would have to span a square 200 m on a side at depth, which is likely unachievable.</p>
<p>Note that technologies known as &ldquo;geothermal&rdquo; heat pumps are not accessing an energy resource; they are simply using a large thermal mass against which to regulate temperature.</p>
<h3 id="biofuels-from-crops">Biofuels from Crops</h3>
<p>(Sec. 14.3; p. 230): While corn ethanol may not even be net energy-positive, sugar cane and vegetable oils as sources of biofuel fare better. But these sources compete with food production and arable land availability. So biofuels from crops can only graduate from &ldquo;niche&rdquo; to moderate scale in the context of plant waste or cellulosic conversion. The abundance and demonstration fields are thus split: food crop energy is demonstrated but severely constrained in scale.</p>
<p>Cellulosic matter becomes a potentially larger-scale source but is undemonstrated.<sup id="fnref:23"><a href="#fn:23" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">23</a></sup> Growing and harvesting annual crops on a relevant scale constitutes a massive, perpetual task and thus scores yellow in difficulty-also driving down EROEI.</p>
<p>[[298]]</p>
<p>If exploiting fossil fuels is akin to spending a considerable inheritance, growing and harvesting our energy supply on an annual basis is like getting a manual labor job: a most difficult transition.+++(4)+++ The main benefit of biofuels from crops is the liquid fuel aspect. Public acceptance hinges on competition with food or even land in general. Because plants are only about 1-2% efficient at harvesting solar energy, this option requires the commandeering of massive tracts of land.</p>
<h3 id="ocean-thermal">Ocean Thermal</h3>
<p>The ocean thermal resource uses the 20-30°C temperature difference between the deep ocean<sup id="fnref:24"><a href="#fn:24" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">24</a></sup> and its surface to drive a ridiculously low-efficiency heat engine. The heat content is not useful for warming any home (it&rsquo;s not hot). But all the same, it is a vast resource due to the sheer area of the solar collector (i.e., the ocean). Large plants out at sea will be difficult to access and maintain, and transmitting power to land is not easy. The resource suffers seasonal intermittency at mid-latitudes, but tropical installations would obviate this effect. No relevant/commercial scale demonstration exists. Like many of the other sources, this one produces electricity<sup id="fnref:25"><a href="#fn:25" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">25</a></sup> only. In terms of acceptance, few likely care what we put to sea: out of sight, out of mind. Ocean thermal is not a backyard solution!</p>
<h3 id="ocean-currents">Ocean Currents</h3>
<p>(Sec. 16.3; p. 281): Large-scale oceanic currents are slower than wind by about a factor of ten, giving a kilogram of current 1,000 times less power than a kilogram of wind. Water density makes up the difference to make ocean current comparable to wind in terms of power per rotor area. Not all the ocean has currents as high as 1 m/s, so the total abundance is put in the same category as wind, although this is likely far too generous and probably should be red. Placing machinery underwater (corrosive) and far from demand classifies this option as difficult. On the plus side, the current should be stable, eliminating intermittency worries, unlike wind. None of our electricity mix comes from ocean currents at present, so it cannot be said to have been meaningfully demonstrated.</p>
<p>For the remaining categories: it is electricity only; we might expect little resistance to underwater installations; and no backyard opportunity.</p>
<h3 id="ocean-waves">Ocean Waves</h3>
<p>(Sec. 16.4; p. 282): While they seem strong and ever-present, waves are a linear-collection phenomenon, and not an areal phenomenon. As a consequence, not that much power arrives at shores all around the world (a few TW at best). It is not particularly difficult to turn wave motion into useful electricity at high efficiency, and the proximity to land makes access, maintenance, and transmission far less worrisome than for the previous two ocean-based cases. Intermittency-largely seasonal—is moderate as storms and lulls come and go. Prototype concepts abound, and a few are being tested at commercial scale. So this is further along than the previous two oceanic sources, but not so much as to earn a blue box. Push-back would be moderate from people whose ocean views are spoiled, or who benefit from natural wave energy hitting the coast. Few people have access to waves in their backyard.</p>
<h3 id="d-t-fusion">D-T Fusion</h3>
<p>(Sec. 15.5; p. 264): The easier of the two fusion options, involving deuterium and tritium, represents a longstanding goal under active development since 1950. The well-funded international effort, ITER, plans to accomplish a 480 second pulse of 500 MW power<sup id="fnref:26"><a href="#fn:26" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">26</a></sup> by 2035. This defines the pinnacle of hard. Fusion brings with it numerous advantages: enormous power density; only moderate radioactive waste products; and abundant deuterium.<sup id="fnref:27"><a href="#fn:27" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">27</a></sup> Fusion would have no intermittency issues, can directly produce heat and derivative electricity, but like the others does not directly address transportation. The non-existent tritium can be knocked out of lithium with neutrons, and even though we are not awash in lithium, we have enough to last many thousands of years in the absence of demand for batteries. We might expect some public opposition to D-T fusion due to the necessary neutron flux and associated radioactivity. Fusion is the highest-tech energy we can envision at present, requiring a team of well-educated scientists/technicians to run-meaning don&rsquo;t plan on building one in your backyard, unless you can afford to have some staff PhDs on hand.</p>
<h3 id="d-d-fusion">D-D Fusion</h3>
<p>(Sec. 15.5; p. 264): Replacing tritium with deuterium means abundance of materials is no concern whatsoever for many billions of years. As a trade, it&rsquo;s substantially harder than D-T fusion.<sup id="fnref:28"><a href="#fn:28" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">28</a></sup> D-D fusion requires higher temperatures, making confinement that much more difficult. It is for this reason that we make a single exception to the scoring scheme and give D-D fusion a -2 score for difficulty.</p>
<h2 id="173-student-rankings">17.3 Student Rankings</h2>
<p>In Winter 2020, students at UC San Diego did Problem 11 from this chapter, which asks them to come up with their own weighting for the ten attributes in the comparison matrix, rather than the simple but poorly-justified practice of giving each category the same weight. This section reports the result from that exercise.</p>
<p>On average, the weights did not deviate dramatically from uniform, the adjustments being within a factor of 1.5 for all cases: ranging from 0.66 to 1.47, when each student&rsquo;s weighting was re-normalized after the fact to add to ten points. The attributes getting a clear boost were abundance, efficiency, and transportation capability. Those getting lower weight were the backyard criterion, acceptance, and ability to produce heat.<sup id="fnref:29"><a href="#fn:29" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">29</a></sup> What this is that students, on the whole, value solutions that can says get the job done efficiently and preserve transportation, not caring as much about individual resilience or acceptance.</p>
<p>Table 17.1 summarizes the outcome of this experiment, in which we see broad agreement with the nominal uniform-weighting scheme, mostly serving to downgrade the scores of some entries, and only promoting one (thorium breeding).</p>

<p>Note that the exercise preserved the blue/yellow/red color scheme of the figures and only changed relative importance of the attributes-thus much of the behavior is &ldquo;baked in&rdquo; based on the author&rsquo;s judgment of color assignment. Still, shifting emphasis on the attributes will shuffle the order somewhat, and that itself is interesting. Any ambitious reader is welcome to mess with the color scheme as well to see what happens.</p>
<h2 id="174-upshot-the-fossil-fuel-gap">17.4 Upshot: The Fossil Fuel Gap</h2>
<p>The subjective nature of this exercise certainly allows numerous possibilities for modifying the box rankings in one direction or the other. The matrices embody some biases, but no attempt by anyone would be free from bias. The result, in this case, is dramatic. Even allowing some manipulation, the substantial gap between the fossil fuels and their renewable alternatives would require excessive &ldquo;cooking&rdquo; to close.</p>
<p>A key take-away from this chapter is that we can devise methods to compare disparate sources of energy in a systematic way. The outcome does not provide an authoritative answer, but what it can do is:</p>
<ul>
<li>help guide our thinking;</li>
<li>expose gaps that we might not otherwise appreciate;</li>
<li>bring attention to the complexity of energy choices: it&rsquo;s more than how many terawatts are available.</li>
</ul>
<p>One lesson is that a transition away from fossil fuels does not appear at this time to involve superior substitutes, as has been characteristic of our energy history. The alternatives might be good enough, even if not as good as what we are accustomed to using. Fossil fuels represent a generous one-time gift from the earth. From our current vantage point, it is not clear that energy-vital to our economic activity-will be as cheap, convenient, and abundant as it has been during our meteoric ascent to the present. If not for finite supply and the CO2 problem, fossil fuels would continue to satisfy our energy needs-shifting focus to various other global-scale problems resulting from human pressures on the planet. Because of the downsides of fossil fuels and the inferiority of the substitutes on a number of fronts, it is unclear how we might patch together an energy portfolio out of the alternatives that allows a continuation of our current lifestyle. Even if the physics allows it, many other practical and economic barriers may limit options or successful implementations.</p>
<p>Adding to the hardship is the fact that many of the alternative energy technologies-solar, wind, nuclear power, hydroelectric, and so on require substantial up-front energy investment to build and deploy. If society waits until energy scarcity forces large-scale deployment of such alternatives, it risks falling into an &ldquo;energy trap&rdquo; in which aggressive use of energy needed to develop a new energy infrastructure leaves less available to society in general - a political non-starter. If there is to be a transition to a sustainable energy regime, it is best to begin it now.+++(4)+++</p>

<li>One consideration not present in the alternative energy matrix is EROEI. Identify at least one example that would likely receive a boost (move up in the rankings) if EROEI is considered, and at least one example that would likely move down as a result of considering it. Refer back to Chapter 14, both tables and text.</li>
<li>(Suggest double-credit problem) Count up the number of blue, yellow, and red squares for all ten attributes (columns) in Figure 17.2. Score each attribute the same way as energy resources were scored: +1 for blue; nothing for yellow; -1 for red.
a) What category has the highest score? What does this tell you
about alternative energy in terms of what is easy?
b) What category has the lowest score? What does this tell you about what attribute is hardest to satisfy in energy production?
c) Which two categories have the largest number of blue squares and which two have the lowest number? What do you learn in terms of what is easy and not so easy?
d) Which category has the largest number of red squares and which two have the lowest number? What do you learn in terms of what is hardest and what is least difficult to satisfy?</li>
</ol>

<ol start="5">
<li>Why is it so hard to satisfy transportation needs? What is it about fossil fuels that has made transportation so much easier than electrified transport would be?</li>
<li>Verify-showing work-the claim on page 292 that a car refueling at a gasoline station is transferring energy at a rate in the neighborhood of 15 MW if the transfer rate is about 6 gallons (23 L) per minute32 and gasoline contains about 34 MJ per liter.</li>
<li>What is at about the backyard33 attribute that earns so many red scores? What does this tell you about access to energy and the complexity of its capture/use?</li>
<li>What two resources are crippled by intermittency? How might that challenge be mitigated so that it is less problematic? What are some difficulties in this solution?</li>
<li>If biofuels turn out to be hampered by low EROEI values, the only transportation-friendly option left is artificial photosynthesis, which was not covered in this book because it&rsquo;s not a &ldquo;real thing&rdquo; at this time—as captured by the two red squares for difficulty and demonstrated. Two questions:
a) What other resources are in a similar &ldquo;not real yet&rdquo; state,
based on the same red squares?
b) What is most encouraging about the prospect of obtaining liquid fuels from sunlight? What problems does it solve for solar power and for transportation?</li>
<li>Figure 17.2 left out firewood as an energy resource, even though it has been with us for a long time and will no doubt continue to provide home heating. What would the ten colors be for this resource of intermediate abundance in the context of home heating? What would its score be, and which sources is it then tied with? Justify each of your color choices.</li>
<li>(Suggest triple-credit problem) For the sake of simplicity and transparency, the scoring system used a simple uniform weighting for each of the 10 attributes, but it is unlikely all ten are equally important. Make up your own weighting scheme. 34 For each energy resource, blue cells add the corresponding category&rsquo;s weight, and red subtracts, and yellow does nothing. Re-score the matrix using your own weights-including the fossil fuels. Now re-order the matrix from highest to lowest score and comment on any major upheaval from the nominal ordering. What are the big surprises? Did the fossil fuel gap persist?</li>
</ol>
<p>Different students may get different results, but this will provide some appreciation for considerations that enter the creation of such a scoring scheme.</p>
