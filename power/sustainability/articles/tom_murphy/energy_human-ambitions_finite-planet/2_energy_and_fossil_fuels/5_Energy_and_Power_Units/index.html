  <p>This chapter provides a baseline for understanding the rest of the content in this book, so that students may learn to interpret and convert units, while building a useful intuition in the process. Sec. A.10 (p. 370) in the Appendices offers some tips on manipulating units and performing unit conversions.</p>
<p>Unlike most chapters, this one does not tell a single story or advance our perspective on the world. But it builds a foundation, putting us in a position to start looking at consequential matters of energy use in our society in chapters to come. Hopefully, patience will be rewarded.</p>

<p>First, what is energy?</p>
<p>Definition 5.1.1<br>
Energy is defined as the capacity to do work.<br>
Work is well-defined in physics<br>
as the application of force through a distance.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>  The colloquial use of the word “work” matches relatively well, in that pushing a large couch across the floor (applying force through a distance) or lifting a heavy box up to a shelf feels like work and can tire you out.</p>
<p>The SI unit of force is the Newton (N), breaking down more fundamentally to kg m/s2. The best way to remember this is via Newton&rsquo;s Second Law: F = ma (force equals mass times acceleration). Mass has units of kg, and acceleration<sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup> is measured in meters per second squared.</p>
<p>Since work is force times distance,<br>
the unit for work (and thus energy) is Newtons times meters, or N. m.<br>
We give this unit its own name: the Joule (J).<br>
Thus, the application of 1 N of force across a distance of 1 m constitutes 1 J of work, requiring 1J of energy to perform.</p>

<p>Example 5.1.1<br>
Several examples<sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup> illustrate force times distance, the first two amounting to one Joule of energy:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pushing a book across a table, applying 2 N of force and sliding it 0.5 m amounts to 1 J of work.</li>
<li>Pushing a matchbox toy car across the floor might require only 0.1 N of force. One would have to push it through a distance of 10 m to make up one Joule of energy.</li>
<li>A car on level ground may require 150 N of force to roll against friction. Pushing a car 5 m would then require 750 J of work.</li>
</ul>

<p>Writing out Newtons as kg m/s2, we find that the unit of energy amounts to J = Nm = kg m2/s2. Notice that this looks like mass times velocity-squared. Box 5.1 explores how this makes a lot of sense.</p>
<details><summary>विस्तारः (द्रष्टुं नोद्यम्)</summary>
<p>Box 5.1: The Units Make Sense!<br>
Think about the famous equation E = mc2. Energy is mass times the speed of light squared. The units work! More on mass-energy in Chapter 15.<br>
Also, kinetic energy is K.E. = mv2, telling a similar story in terms of units: mass times velocity-squared. More on kinetic energy in Chapter 12.<br>
Gravitational potential energy is just the weight of an object times the height it is lifted through. The weight (force) is mass (m) times the acceleration due to gravity (g), so that lifting (applying a force equal to the weight) through a height (h) results in a potential energy gain of P.E. = mgh. More on gravitational potential energy in Chapter 11.<br>
The units again check out as $mgh → kg m m /s^2 = J$.</p>

<p>Sec. A.10 (p. 370) in the Appendices provides additional guidance on manipulating units.</p>

<h2 id="52-energy-forms-and-conservation">5.2 Energy Forms and Conservation</h2>
<p>Energy manifests in a variety of forms, which we will treat in greater detail in application-specific chapters in Part III of this text. For now we just want to name them and point to related chapters and applications, as is done in Table 5.2.</p>

<p>[[70]]</p>
<p>A bedrock principle of physics is conservation of energy, which we take to never be violated in any system, ever<sup id="fnref:10"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">10</a></sup>. What this means is that energy can flow from one form to another, but it is never created or destroyed.</p>
<details><summary>विस्तारः (द्रष्टुं नोद्यम्)</summary>
<p>Box 5.2: Energy: The Money of Physics</p>
<p>A decent way to conceptualize energy conservation is to think of it as the money of physics. It may change hands, but is not created or destroyed in the exchange. A large balance in a bank account is like a potential energy: available to spend. Converting to another form-like heat or kinetic energy-is like the act of spending money. The rate of spending energy is called power.</p>

<p>P.E. = 7 J K.E. = 0 J<br>
P.E. = 5 J K.E. = 2 J<br>
P.E. = 3 J K.E. = 4 J<br>
P.E. = 1 J K.E. = 6 J</p>
<p>Figure 5.1: Example exchange of potential energy (P.E.) into kinetic energy (K.E.) as an apple drops from a tree. The total energy always adds to the same amount (here 7 J). The apple speeds up as it gains kinetic energy (losing potential energy). When it comes to rest on the ground, the energy will have gone into 7 J of heat (the associated temperature rise is too small to notice)+++(5)+++.</p>
<p>Example 5.2.1 traces a few familiar energy conversions, and Figure 5.1 provides an example illustration. A more encompassing narrative connecting cosmic sources to daily use is provided in Sec. D.2.2 (p. 395).</p>
<p>Example 5.2.1 Various illustrative examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>A rock perched on the edge of a cliff has gravitational potential energy. When it is pushed off, it trades its potential energy for kinetic energy (speed) as it races toward the ground.</li>
<li>A pendulum continually exchanges kinetic and potential energy, which can last some time in the absence of frictional influences.</li>
<li>A stick of dynamite has energy stored in chemical bonds (a form of potential energy). When ignited, the explosive material becomes very hot in a small fraction of a second, converting chemical energy into thermal energy.</li>
<li>The fireball of hot material from the exploding dynamite expands rapidly, pushing air and nearby objects out of the way at high speed, thus converting thermal energy into kinetic energy.</li>
<li>Light from the sun (photons) hits a black parking lot surface, heating it up as light energy is converted to thermal energy.</li>
<li>A uranium nucleus splits apart, releasing nuclear (potential) energy, sending the particles flying off at high speed (kinetic energy). These particles bump into surrounding particles transferring kinetic energy into thermal energy.</li>
<li>Thermal energy from burning a fossil fuel or from nuclear fission can be used to make steam that drives a turbine (kinetic energy) that in turn generates electrical energy (voltage, current).</li>
</ul>
<p>Any of the forms of energy (e.g., in Table 5.2) can convert into the other, directly or indirectly. In each conversion, 100% of the energy is accounted for. In the general case, the energy branches into multiple paths, so we do not get 100% efficiency into the channel we want.+++(4)+++ For instance, the pendulum example above will eventually bleed its energy into stirring the air (kinetic energy) and friction (heat) at the pivot point. The stirring air eventually turns to heat via internal (viscous) friction of the air.</p>
<p>One useful clarification is that thermal energy is really just random motionskinetic energyof individual atoms and molecules. So in the case of nuclear fission in Example 5.2.1, the initial kinetic energy of the nuclear fragments is already thermal in nature, but at a higher temperature (faster speeds) than the surrounding material. By bumping into surrounding atoms, the excess speed is diffused into the medium, raising its temperature while &ldquo;cooling&rdquo; the fragments themselves as they are slowed down.</p>
<details><summary>विस्तारः (द्रष्टुं नोद्यम्)</summary>
<p>The differences between kinetic and thermal energy is about coherence, in that we characterize the kinetic energy of a raindrop by its bulk motion or velocity. Meanwhile, water molecules within the drop are zipping about in random directions and at very high speeds exceeding 1,000 meters per second.+++(4)+++</p>
</details>
<p>If accounting for all the possible paths<sup id="fnref:11"><a href="#fn:11" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">11</a></sup> of energy, we are confident that they always add up. Nothing is lost.<sup id="fnref:12"><a href="#fn:12" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">12</a></sup> Energy is never created or destroyed in any process we study. It just sloshes from one form to another, often branching into multiple parallel avenues. The sum total will always add up to the starting amount. Sec. D.2.3 (p. 396) provides a supplement for those interested in better understanding where energy ultimately goes, and why &ldquo;losing energy to heat&rdquo; is not actually a loss but just another reservoir for energy.</p>
<h2 id="53-power-w">5.3 Power (W)</h2>
<p>Before getting to the various common units for energy, we should absorb the very important concept and units of power.</p>
<p>Definition 5.3.1<br>
Power is simply defined as energy per time: how much energy is expended in how much time. The SI unit is therefore J/s, which we rename Watts (W). One Watt is simply one Joule per second.</p>
<p>While energy is the capacity to do work, it says nothing about how quickly that work might be accomplished. Power addresses the rate at which energy is expended. Figure 5.2 provides a sense of typical power levels of familiar animals and appliances.</p>

<p>Example 5.3.1<br>
Lifting a 10 kg box, whose weight is therefore about 100 N, through a vertical distance of 2 m requires about 200 J of energy. If performed in one second, the task requires 200 W (200 Joules in one second). Stretching the same task out over four seconds requires only 50 W.</p>
<p>Weight is mg. In this case, m is 10 kg. If we&rsquo;re being sticklers, g = 9.8 m/s2, but for convenience we can typically use g≈ 10 m/s2 without significant loss of precision.</p>
</details>
<p>[[71]]</p>
<p>Of course, we commonly apply the usual multipliers of factors of $10^3$ to the unit to make it more useful. Thus we have the progression W, KW, MW, GW, TW, etc. For reference, a large college campus will require several tens of MW (megawatts) for electricity. A large power plant is typically in the 1-4 GW range. See Table 5.3 for scales at which we are likely to use the various multiplying factors, and a more complete set of multipliers on page 420.</p>

<p>Although it won&rsquo;t come up too often in this course, it is worth mentioning that the common unit of horsepower equates to 745.7 W. Thus a 100 hp car is capable of delivering about 75 kW of power. It is usually sufficient to remember that 1 hp is about 750 W.</p>
<h2 id="54-kilowatt-hour-kwh">5.4 Kilowatt-hour (kWh)</h2>
<p>Definition 5.4.1 The kilowatt-hour is an amount of energy (not a power) resulting from an expenditure of energy at a rate of 1 kW for a duration of one hour, and is the unit of choice for residential electricity usage.</p>
<p>This unit causes no end of confusion, but it&rsquo;s really pretty straightforward. The kilowatt-hour is a kilowatt times an hour. Thus it is power multiplied by time, which is energy (since power is energy over time).</p>
<p>It may help to think of the sequence: kilowatt x hour; kWxh; kW-h; kWh.</p>
<details><summary>विस्तारः (द्रष्टुं नोद्यम्)</summary>
<p>Example 5.4.1<br>
Let&rsquo;s say you plug in a space heater rated at 1,000 W (1 kW) and run it for one hour. Congratulations-you&rsquo;ve just spent 1 kWh.</p>
<p>Or maybe you turn on a 100 W incandescent light bulb (0.1 kW) and leave it on for 10 hours: also 1 kWh!</p>
<p>What if you run a 500 W rice cooker (0.5 kW) for half an hour? That&rsquo;s 0.25 kWh.</p>
</details>
<p>[[72]]</p>
<p>It is straightforward to convert back to Joules, because 1 kW is 1,000 J/s and one hour is 3,600 s. So 1 kWh is 1 kW times 1 hr, which is 1,000 J/s times 3,600 s, and is therefore equal to 3,600,000 J, or 3.6 MJ.</p>
<p>A related measure sometimes comes up: the watt-hour (Wh). In much the same vein, this is equivalent to 1 J/s for 3,600 seconds, or 3,600 J.<sup id="fnref:14"><a href="#fn:14" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">14</a></sup></p>

<p>Box 5.3: Don&rsquo;t be one of those people&hellip;<br>
If you ever hear someone say &ldquo;kilowatts per hour,” it&rsquo;s likely a mistake,<sup id="fnref:15"><a href="#fn:15" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">15</a></sup> and has the side effect of leading people to erroneously think that kilowatts is a unit of energy, not a power. Kilowatts is already a rate (speed) of energy use: 1,000 Joules per second.</p>
</details>
<p>One tendency some people have is to mix up kW and kWh.<sup id="fnref:16"><a href="#fn:16" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">16</a></sup></p>
<p>Kilowatts is a unit of power, or how fast energy is being used. Think of it like a speedometer: how fast are you moving (through space or energy)? Kilowatt-hours is a multiplication of power times time, becoming an energy. It&rsquo;s more like the odometer: how much have you accumulated (distance or energy)?+++(5)+++ Just like distance is rate (speed) times time, energy is rate (power) times time.</p>
<details><summary>विस्तारः (द्रष्टुं नोद्यम्)</summary>
<p>Example 5.4.2<br>
We will explore kWh using a light bulb for an example. Let&rsquo;s say the light bulb is labeled as 100 W.<sup id="fnref:17"><a href="#fn:17" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">17</a></sup> How much energy does
it use?</p>
<p>Well, it depends on how long it&rsquo;s on. If it is never turned on, it uses no energy. If it is on for 10 seconds, it uses far less than if it&rsquo;s on for a day.</p>
<p>The characteristic quality of the light bulb is the power it expends when it&rsquo;s on-in this case 100 W. It only has one speed. In analogy to a car and speedometer, it&rsquo;s similar to saying that a car travels at a constant speed,<sup id="fnref:18"><a href="#fn:18" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">18</a></sup> and asking how far it travels. Well, it depends on how much time it spends traveling at speed.</p>
<p>So view kWh (energy) as an accumulated amount that increases with time. On the other hand, kW is a rate of energy expenditure.</p>
</details>
<p>[[73]]</p>
<h2 id="55-calories-kcal">5.5 Calories (kcal)</h2>
<p>A common unit for describing chemical and thermal processes is the calorie and its siblings.</p>
<p>Definition 5.5.1<br>
A calorie is defined as the amount of energy it takes to heat one gram of water (thus also 1 mL, or 1 cm3, or 1 cc) by one degree Celsius (Figure 5.3). One calorie (note the small &ldquo;c&rdquo;) is 4.184 J of energy.<br>
One Calorie (note the capital &ldquo;C&rdquo;)<sup id="fnref:19"><a href="#fn:19" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">19</a></sup> is 1,000 calories, or 1 kilocalorie (1 kcal), equating to 4,184 J. +++(5)+++</p>
<p>Most memorably, it is the amount of energy it takes to heat one kilogram (or one liter; 1 L) of water by 1°C. Due to the tragic convention of Calorie, we will opt for kcal whenever possible.</p>
<p>Food labels in the U.S. are in Calories, describing the energy content of the food we eat.<sup id="fnref:20"><a href="#fn:20" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">20</a></sup> We would all do ourselves a favor by calling these kcal instead of Calories (same thing). Many other countries sensibly use either kJ or kcal for quantifying food energy.</p>
<p>(1 cm3 = 1 mL = 1 g) 20°C + 50 calories (209 J) → 70°C</p>
<p>Example 5.5.1</p>
<p>To change 30 mL (30 g) of water by 5°C requires 150 cal, or a little over 600 J.</p>
<p>Injecting 40 kcal of energy into a 2 L (2 kg) bottle of water will heat it by 20 degrees.<br>
Drinking 250 mL of ice-cold water and heating it up to body temperature (thus raising its temperature by approximately 35 degrees) will take about 8,750 cal, or 8.75 kcal, or a bit over 36 kJ of energy.<br>
It is usually sufficient to remember that the conversion factor between calories and Joules is about 4.2-or just 4 if performing a crude calculation.</p>
<p>[[74]]</p>
<p>Figure 5.3: Following the definition of a calorie, adding 50 cal to one gram of water raises its temperature by 50°C.</p>
<p>20 deg 1cucm = 1mL = 1g + 50 cal (209J)  -&gt; 70 deg C</p>
<p>No deep significance attaches to the fact that 1 cal happens to equate to 4.184 J, other than to say this describes a property of water (called specific heat capacity).</p>
<p>1 cal = 4.184 J  ~ 4.2 J ~ 4J<br>
1 kcal = 4,184 J ~ 4.2kJ ~ 4 kJ</p>
<p>Two examples will help cement use of the kcal (a more useful scale in this class than the much smaller calorie).</p>
<p>Example 5.5.2 A typical diet amounts to a daily intake of about 2,000 kcal of food energy. If you think about it, 2,000 kcal/day is a power (energy per time). We can convert to Watts by changing kcal to J and one day to seconds. 2,000 kcal is 8.368 MJ. One day has 86,400 seconds. The division of the two is very close to 100 W.+++(5)+++<sup id="fnref:21"><a href="#fn:21" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">21</a></sup></p>
<p>A second example hews closely to the definition of the kcal: heating water.</p>
<p>Example 5.5.3 Let&rsquo;s say you want to heat a half-liter (0.5 kg) of water from room temperature (20°C) to boiling (100°C). Since each kcal can heat 1 kg by 1°C, that same energy will raise our half-kg by 2°C.<sup id="fnref:22"><a href="#fn:22" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">22</a></sup> So raising the temperature by 80°C will require 40 kcal, or 167 kJ.</p>
<p>If the water is heated at a rate of 1,000 W (1,000 J/s), it would take 167 seconds for the water to reach boiling temperature.</p>
<p>Notice that we did not apply an explicit formula in Example 5.5.3. By proceeding stepwise, we attempt to keep it intuitive. (Appendix Sec. A.8 (p. 368) addresses this philosophy in a bit more detail. )</p>
<p>We could write a formula, but we implicitly create the formula on the fly by recognizing that the amount of energy required should scale with the mass of water and with the amount of temperature increase. Hopefully, this approach leads to a deeper understanding of the concept, while printing a formula on the page might short-circuit comprehension.</p>
<p>[[75]]</p>
<p>This would be an excellent opportunity to create your own formula to capture the idea, like an expert!</p>
<h2 id="56-british-thermal-unit-btu">5.6 British Thermal Unit (Btu)</h2>
<p>Why would we waste our time talking about the arcane British thermal unit (Btu)? It&rsquo;s because data provided by the U.S. Energy Information Administration on global energy use is based on the Btu. More specifically, country-scale annual energy expenditures are measured in units of quadrillion ($10^15$) Btu (see Box 5.4). Also, heating appliances in the U.S.<sup id="fnref:23"><a href="#fn:23" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">23</a></sup> are rated in Btu/hour-a unit of power that can be converted to Watts.</p>
<p>Definition 5.6.1<br>
The Btu is the Imperial analog to the kcal.<sup id="fnref:24"><a href="#fn:24" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">24</a></sup><br>
One Btu is the energy required to heat one pound of water one degree Fahrenheit.<br>
In terms of Joules, 1 Btu is about 1,055 J, or not far from 1 kJ.</p>
<p>We can make sense of the conversion to Joules in the following way: a pound is roughly half a kilogram and one degree Fahrenheit is approximately half a degree Celsius. So a Btu should be roughly a quarter of a kcal. Indeed, 1,055 J is close to one quarter of 4,184 J.+++(5)+++</p>
<details><summary>विस्तारः (द्रष्टुं नोद्यम्)</summary>
<p>Box 5.4: Quads: qBtu<br>
The U.S. uses quadrillion Btu to represent country-scale annual energy expenditures. It is denoted as qBtu, or informally &ldquo;quads.&rdquo; One qBtu is approximately 1018 J.<sup id="fnref:25"><a href="#fn:25" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">25</a></sup><br>
The U.S. uses about 100 quads per year. Since a year is about 3.16× $10^{7}$ seconds,<sup id="fnref:26"><a href="#fn:26" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">26</a></sup> dividing energy in Joules by time in seconds tells us that the U.S. power is about 3 x $10^{12}$ W (3 TW), working out to about 10,000 W per person as a per-capita rate of energy use.</p>
</details>
<p>Example 5.6.1 For appliances characterized by Btu/hr, we can relate to power in Watts via 1 Btu/hr as 1,055 J per 3,600 s, working out to 0.293 W.
Thus, a hot water heater rated at 30,000 Btu/hr is effectively 8,800 W.
Let&rsquo;s also pause to understand how long it will take to heat a shower&rsquo;s worth of hot water at this rate. We&rsquo;ll do it two ways:</p>
<ol>
<li>Heating 15 gallons22 (125 pounds) from a cool 68°F to a hot 131°F at 30,000 Btu/hr will take how long? We must put in
We need to cover the unit in this chapter in order to be energy-literate in the U.S., and because it will come up later in this book.</li>
</ol>
<p>125 × 63 = 7,900 Btu of energy at a rate of 30,000 Btu/hr, so it will take 7,900/30,000 of an hour, or just over 15 minutes. 2. In metric terms, the equivalent to 15 gallons is 57 L (57 kg), and we heat from 20°C to 55°C at 8,800 W.23 Since one kcal heats one kilogram of water 1°C, heating 57 kg by 35°C will require 57 x 35 kcal, or 57 x 35 x 4, 184J = 8.35 MJ, which at 8,800 W will take 950 seconds, also just over 15 minutes (reassuringly, the same answer).
5.7 Therms
We will rarely encounter this unit, but include it here because natural gas utility bills24 in the U.S. often employ Therms. Since part of the goal of this book is to empower a personal understanding of energy and how to compare different measures of energy (e.g., on a utility bill), conventions in the U.S. demand that we cover the unit here.<sup id="fnref:27"><a href="#fn:27" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">27</a></sup>
Definition 5.7.1 One Therm is 100,000 Btu, or 1.055 x $10^{8}$ J, or 29.3 kWh.
Box 5.5: Why Therms?
The Therm is partly adopted for the near-convenience that 100 cubic feet of natural gas (CCF or 100 CF), which meters measure directly, equates to 1.036 Therms. Relatedly, one gallon (3.785 L) of liquid propane gas26 contains 91,500 Btu, which is 0.915 Therms. Thus the Therm very closely matches convenient measures of natural gas (100 cubic feet) or liquid propane (a gallon).
Example 5.7.1 It might take approximately 10,000 kcal of energy27 to heat a fresh infusion of cold water into a hot water heater tank. How many Therms is this?
We do a two-step conversion: first, 10,000 kcal is 41.84 MJ, which at 1,055 J per Btu computes to about 40,000 Btu, which is the same as 0.4 Therm, requiring approximately 40 cubic feet of natural gas, or a little less than half-a-gallon (about 2 L) of liquid propane.
If we learn that the hot water heater is rated at 30,000 Btu per hour, it will take an hour and 20 minutes to complete the job.

<p>Voltage is a measure of electric potential, in Volts, and can be thought of as analogous to how high something is lifted.<sup id="fnref:28"><a href="#fn:28" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">28</a></sup> A higher voltage is like sitting higher on the shelf, and can do more work if allowed to be released.
Charge is moved around by electrical forces, and the amount of charge moved plays a role similar to that of mass in gravitational settings. The unit of charge is the Coulomb (C), and the smallest unit of charge we encounter in normal situations is from the proton (+1.6 × $10^{-19}$ C) or the electron (-1.6 x $10^{-19}$ C).

<p>Example 5.8.2 A typical 9-volt battery has a capacity of 500 mAh. How much energy is this?
500 mAh is 0.5 Ah. Multiplying by 9 V produces 4.5 Wh. Recall that 1 Wh is 1 J/s times 3,600 s (one hour), or 3,600 J. So 4.5 Wh is 16.2 kJ.
How long can we power a 1 W LED array from this battery? We can go the long way (16.2 kJ divided by 1J/s) and say 16,200 seconds, or recognize that a 4.5 Wh battery can dispense 1 W for 4.5 hours. It&rsquo;s the same either way.

5.10 Light Energy
Light energy and its spectrum will be explored more extensively in Chapter 13, but the main concepts are covered here for completeness.
Light can be used to describe any part of the electromagnetic spectrum, from radio waves and microwaves, through infrared, visible, ultraviolet, and on to X-rays and gamma rays. Like atoms, light is &ldquo;quantized&rdquo; into smallest indivisible units-in this case particles called photons. An individual photon&rsquo;s energy is characteristic of its wavelength, A (Greek lambda), or frequency, v (Greek nu).3

26. The chapter banner image (page 68) shows data from the author&rsquo;s utility bill, reflecting 230 kWh of electricity and 4 Therms of gas usage. Annoyingly, the units are different. How do the actual energies compare, if expressed in the same units?51 How would you capture in a simple sentence the approximate comparison of energy use for each?
27. The chapter banner image (page 68) shows part of the hot water heater label in the author&rsquo;s home, showing a rating of 40,000 Btu/hr. How much power is it capable of putting out, in Watts?
28. The chapter banner image (page 68) shows the energy label associated with the author&rsquo;s hot water heater, estimating that it will use 242 Therms per year.

5.9 Electron Volt (eV)
The electron-volt (eV) is the unit of choice for energy at the atomic scale. This makes it ideal for discussing individual chemical bond strengths, the energy of individual photons of light emitted from atoms, and thermal energy per atom or molecule.<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup> We also use the eV for nuclear physics, but must increase the scale one million-fold and therefore speak of the mega-electron-volt, or MeV.
We have already hit all the relevant concepts for understanding the eV in Section 5.8. The main reason to have its own section is so that it
appears separately in the table of contents, making it easier to find and reference. The definition follows Definition 5.8.1 closely.
Definition 5.9.1 One electron-volt is the energy associated with pushing one fundamental unit of electron charge, |e| = 1.6×$10^{-19}$ Coulombs, through an electric potential of 1 V:
1 eV = 1.6 × $10^{-19}$ C. 1V = 1.6 × $10^{-19}$ J
(5.3)
The electron-volt, at 1.6 x $10^{-19}$ J, is a tiny amount of energy. But it&rsquo;s just the right level for describing energetic processes for individual atoms.
Example 5.9.1 When 12 grams of carbon (one mole, or 6 $10^{23}$ atoms35) reacts with oxygen to form CO2, about 394 kJ of energy is released.<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup> How much energy is this per carbon atom in electron-volts?
Since we have one mole, or 6 x $10^{23}$ carbon atoms, we divide our total energy (3.94 × $10^{5}$ J) by the number of atoms to get 6.5 x $10^{-19}$ J per atom. This is just a bit larger than 1 eV (1.6 x $10^{-19}$ J), and the division leads to something very close to 4 eV per atom.
Because CO2 has a total of four bonds between the carbon atom and the two oxygen atoms,<sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup> we see that each bond accounts for about 1 eV.

<p>&hellip; making electric potential a lot like gravitational potential energy in flavor
E = qV.
(5.1)
One Coulomb of charge at a potential of 1 V has an energy of 1J.
Current is the rate at which charge flows, and is usually symbolized by the letter I. Imagine setting up a toll booth in a conducting wire and counting how many charges (or how much cumulative charge) pass the gate per unit time. This gives rise to the Definition 5.8.2.
Definition 5.8.2 Current is measured in Amps,<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> which is defined as one Coulomb per second.
Moving one Coulomb through one Volt every second would constitute one Joule of energy every second, which is the definition of one Watt. Putting the concepts of Definition 5.8.1 and Definition 5.8.2 together, we find ourselves able to define electrical power.
Definition 5.8.3 Electrical power is simply current multiplied by voltage:
P = IV.
Current, I, is in Amps, and voltage, V is in Volts.
(5.2)
Example 5.8.1 Households in the U.S. often have circuit breakers allowing maximum currents of 15 or 20 Amps for regular power outlets. At a voltage of 120 V,30 this corresponds to a maximum power of 1,800 W or 2,400 W, respectively.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>
Finally, we are in a position to understand how much energy a battery will hold. Batteries are rated by two numbers: voltage, and charge capacity. Since current is charge per time, multiplying current and time results in just charge.<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup> Therefore, charge capacity in batteries is characterized as Amp-hours (Ah) or milli-amp-hours (mAh). Since Amps times Volts is Watts (Eq. 5.2), Amp-hours times Volts is Watt-hours, a familiar unit of energy
