  <meta property="og:description" content="Climate change stands tall among the global scale problems created by our energy appetite caused by the accumulation of carbon dioxide (CO2) in our atmosphere from the burning of fossil fuels. This chapter aims to provide a no-nonsense account of the basis for climate change that leaves little room for the kind of uncertainty often injected by (alarmingly successful) disinformation campaigns. While the response of our complex climate system is more difficult to predict in detail, the core physics is unassailable. We will see that the rise in CO2 is not at all mysterious, stemming from fossil fuels. We will also explore a few scenarios and connect the CO2 rise to temperature consequences.">

  <p>Climate change stands tall among the global scale problems created by our energy appetite caused by the accumulation of carbon dioxide (CO2) in our atmosphere from the burning of fossil fuels. This chapter aims to provide a no-nonsense account of the basis for climate change that leaves little room for the kind of uncertainty often injected by (alarmingly successful) disinformation campaigns. While the response of our complex climate system is more difficult to predict in detail, the core physics is unassailable. We will see that the rise in CO2 is not at all mysterious, stemming from fossil fuels. We will also explore a few scenarios and connect the CO2 rise to temperature consequences.</p>

9.1 The Source of CO2
The climate change forces at play today are primarily due to increased concentration of CO2 in our atmosphere as a result of burning fossil fuels.
The chemistry is unambiguous (Eq. 8.1; p. 121): energy is released when fossil fuels are combusted with oxygen (O2) to get CO2 and H2O. Table 9.1 extends properties of fossil fuels first presented in Chapter 8, adding CO2 attributes.

<li>mass ratio: how many grams of CO2 are produced per gram1 of
input fuel;</li>
<li>carbon intensity: how many grams of CO2 are produced per unit
of energy delivered.
While all forms produce a mass ratio of approximately 3 units of CO2 for every unit of fossil fuels, the lower energy density of coal together with its slightly higher mass ratio2 make it more than twice as carbon-intense as natural gas.
Example 9.1.1 Roughly how much CO2 is produced from each full tank of gasoline in a car?
A typical tank might hold about 50 L of gasoline (13 gallons). The density of gasoline is 0.75 kg/L, so that one tank has a gasoline mass of about 38 kg. Applying the simple and convenient factor-of-three ratio of CO2 mass to input fuel mass, we see that one tank of gasoline will produce something like 110 kg of CO2-not a small amount!</li>

<p>When the measurements started, the atmosphere consisted of less than 320 parts per million by volume (ppm), or &lt; 0.032%. By now, we are beyond 410 ppmy.
Measurements of trapped air bubbles in the Greenland ice sheet going back about 100,000 years and the Antarctic ice sheet going back 800,000 years indicate that CO2 has fluctuated between 180-280 ppm, reaching the higher end of the range during the warmer periods between ice ages (interglacial periods). For at least the last thousand years before the Fossil Fuel Age, CO2 held steady around 280 ppm..

We saw in Figure 8.2-repeated as Figure 9.2-a history of fossil fuel usage for the world, in coal, oil, and natural gas. Meanwhile, Table 9.1 indicates how much CO2 each fuel contributes per kilogram or Joule used. These two pieces can be combined to make an estimate of how much CO2 is emitted globally each year, and to track total CO2 emission over time. Table 9.2 and Box 9.1 elucidate how to go from the fossil fuel power figures (TW) in Figure 9.2 to CO2 atmospheric concentrations.
Box 9.1: Computing CO2 ppm, from TW
We will use oil as an example. In Figure 9.2, we appear to get about 6 TW from oil (5 TW from coal, 4 TW from natural gas). Multiplying by $10^{12}$ puts this in Watts (J/s) and by 3.156 × $10^{7}$ seconds per year results in the annual global energy from oil in Joules: 1.9 × $10^{20}$ J/yr. Table 9.1 indicates that oil contains about 11.5 kcal/g, so the number of grams of oil used per can be determined by first converting J to kcal

On the left is the raw usage rate expressed in terawatts, while the right is a per-capita measure. The three fossil fuel types are stacked on top of one another, so that gas makes the smallest contribution, not the largest. For instance, on the right-hand-edge of the left panel, coal goes from 0 to 5 TW, oil from 5 to 11 (thus 6 TW from oil), and gas from 11 to 15, indicating 4 TW from gas. The left-hand panel makes clear that fossil fuel use is still rising dramatically, and thus CO2
emissions.

(divide by 4,184), yielding 4.5 × $10^{16}$ kcal/yr, and thus 3.9 × $10^{15}$ g/yr of oil, or 3.9 × $10^{12}$ kg/yr.<sup id="fnref:26"><a href="#fn:26" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">26</a></sup> Table 9.1 shows that each kilogram of oil combusted produces 3.09 kg of CO2, translating to 1.2 x $10^{13}$ kg/yr of CO2 from oil. Incidentally, we get the same answer using 64 g/MJ from Table 9.1 and 1.9× $10^{14}$ MJ/yr from a few lines up. The remainder of the work, converting to parts per million, is covered in the text and the lower part of Table 9.2.

The mass of the atmosphere is about 5 × $10^{18}$ kg, obtained by multiplying 10,000 kg of air sitting over every square meter by the $4πR^2$ surface area of the earth. Dividing the 1.2 × $10^{13}$ kg of oil-generated CO2 by the mass of the atmosphere yields 2.4 x $10^{-6}$, or 2.4 parts per million. We are almost there. The quantity we have calculated is parts per million by mass (ppmm), not the conventional parts per million by volume (ppm). Since air averages 29 g/mol, and CO2 is 44 g/mol, the mass concentration of CO2 is higher than the volume occupation in air by a factor of 44/29, or 1.52. Thus we divide our 2.4 ppmm result by 1.52 to get 1.6 ppm. A final correction is that only half of this stays in the atmosphere, so that today we are putting 0.8 ppm, into the atmosphere each year from oil.
Figure 9.3 shows the result of this computation as a function of time in terms of annual rate and cumulative emission. We find that even though oil and coal deliver about the same global annual energy now, the carbon-intensity of coal is much higher so that its CO2 emission dominates10 over the other sources. In fact, coal always has been the dominant CO2 producer, seen by the fact that the black curve in the left-hand panel of Figure 9.3 has always been higher than the other two CO2 sources. In total, this estimate suggests that we should see CO2 levels rising by 2.6 ppm, per year, a little over half of which is due to coal (1.4 ppm/year).
11
Summing up the rising contributions over time, this method of estimation suggests that we have increased the atmospheric CO2 by 123 ppm, and that 75 ppm, of this (61%) is attributed to coal (right-hand panel of Figure 9.3).</p>

Figure 9.3: Estimated CO2 contributions from known fossil fuel expenditures based on chemistry and the assumption that half of CO2 stays in the atmosphere, while the rest is absorbed by the ocean and land. Units are parts per million by volume. The left-hand panel shows the annual addition, adding to 2.6 ppm, per year and accounting for the slope in Figure 9.1. The right-hand panel is the cumulative emission to date as a function of time essentially adding up all the annual emissions from the left-hand panel. These curves are not stacked as are the ones in Figure 9.2, so each can be read directly from the vertical axis. Note that oil and gas are still on the rise in the left-hand panel: we emit more CO2 each year than we did the year before.</p>
<p>Box 9.2: If We Ignored Oceans
Reflect on what our reaction might have been had we not corrected for oceanic and land absorption: we would conclude that we have no trouble quantitatively accounting for the CO2 rise based on fossil fuels, and would be left asking why we don&rsquo;t see an even larger rise. In other words, it is no stretch to account for the cause of excess CO2-making it far from mysterious. If our CO2 increase were not due to humans,<sup id="fnref:28"><a href="#fn:28" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">28</a></sup> we would be left with a real mystery: then where is all of the known CO2 emission from burning fossil fuels disappearing to?

9.1.3 Chief Contributors
Climate change is a global phenomenon. Even if all emissions came from one country or region, atmospheric circulation would spread the result around the globe-albeit more slowly across the equator. It is, therefore, a global problem. All the same, it is interesting to look at chief emitters.

The sun delivers energy to the top of the earth&rsquo;s atmosphere at a rate16 of 1,360 $W/m^2$. About 30% of this light-29.3%, to be precise-is immediately reflected by clouds, snow, and to a lesser extent water and terrain. The remaining 70.7% of the light intercepts the earth in a projected disk of area Aproj = πR (Figure 9.6).

The top panel shows solar input in red and infrared (thermal) radiation output in blue. The smooth curves are the theoretical blackbody Planck spectra at solar and terrestrial temperatures. Thus the smooth red curve represents the distribution of solar energy arriving at the top of Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere, while the solid red filled feature is what survives the path to the ground. The smooth blue curve (middle of the set of three) represents radiation from the ground, but only a small fraction (blue filled region) passes directly through the atmosphere-the rest absorbed by greenhouse gases. The lower panels detail where light gets absorbed or scattered. Gray regions indicate absorption and scattering, so that white portions can be thought of as the transmitted part-often called &ldquo;windows.&rdquo; Key contributors (greenhouse gases) are broken out in panels below the total absorption panel.

<p>which is about 0.6°C larger than it was before increasing the amount of CO2. We can express this as a sensitivity: how much AT do we get for a given imbalance in radiative forcing? In this case, 0.6°C from a 2.2 $W/m^2$ increase is 0.27°C per $W/m^2$. But when the known feedback mechanisms are included-most of them in the positive direction-the temperature sensitivity becomes 0.8°C for every $W/m^2$ of additional forcing: called the climate sensitivity parameter.<sup id="fnref:34"><a href="#fn:34" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">34</a></sup>
Definition 9.2.2 The climate sensitivity parameter connects the amount of warming expected for a given amount of radiative forcing. Current understanding puts this at 0.8°C per $W/m^2$ of radiative forcing.
Therefore, our current 2.2 $W/m^2$ of additional (fossil-fuel added) radiative forcing translates29 to a 1.7°C temperature increase (Figure 9.10), which is about three times what the non-feedback calculation would provide.
Example 9.2.1 If we double our CO2 concentration from pre-industrial levels, what would we expect the temperature increase to be?
Pre-industrial CO2 was 280 ppmy, so doubling it adds 280 ppm, for a total of 560 ppm. The radiative forcing is then 5.35 ln(2)≈ 3.7 $W/m^2$. Multiply this by the climate sensitivity of 0.8°C per $W/m^2$ to get a temperature increase of about 3.0°C (would be 1°C without feedback).
The positive feedbacks are important, and include factors like:</p>
<ol>
<li>A warmer planet means less ice (glaciers, Arctic cap), resulting in less reflected sunlight, increasing the 0.707 absorption factor in Eq. 9.3 to increase solar forcing.</li>
<li>Warmer air can hold more water vapor-the principal greenhouse gas, thus driving up the nominal 33°C greenhouse gas
contribution.</li>
<li>A warmer environment leads to additional CO2 loss from drying forests, desertification, and accelerated decomposition of plant matter and peat.
A few negative feedback mechanisms30 exist as well, but are outweighed by the positive feedback terms.
Global temperature increase is already about 1.0°C <sup id="fnref:35"><a href="#fn:35" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">35</a></sup>. Note that even if we never added another CO2 molecule to the atmosphere, the temperature would continue to rise as the ocean31 slowly catches up to the new equilibrium. We would expect the temperature to stabilize around 1.7°C higher for today&rsquo;s CO2 excess, according to the calculation above. Thus the climb is about 55% done. Of course, more CO2 will be added, so the eventual temperature rise is destined to be higher still.

</ol>
<p>By far the most important negative feedback mechanism is the infrared radiation itself, increasing dramatically as temperature increases (as T4), thus opposing the temperature rise by a cooling influence. Here, we mean negative feedback influences in addition to this main one.</p>

9.3 Possible Trajectories
Launching from the data used to generate Figure 9.3, we can now play a few games to understand what our future might hold in terms of total CO2 rise and corresponding AT increases by the year 2100 under various contrived scenarios.<sup id="fnref:36"><a href="#fn:36" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">36</a></sup>
First, let&rsquo;s imagine that we suddenly arrest the upward climb characteristic of fossil-fuel usage to date33 and maintain present-day levels of fossil fuel use from now until 2100. Figure 9.11 shows what happens. The total added CO2 rises to 2.75 times the current excess, to 339 ppm, 34 above pre-industrial levels. The associated radiative forcing would be 4.25 $W/m^2$ and result in a 3.4°C temperature increase. Table 9.5 summarizes this scenario and the three to follow.

<p>based on its lower energy density (5-8 kcal/g vs. 13 for natural gas) and its higher CO2-to-fuel mass ratio (3.67 vs. 2.75 for natural gas)</p>
<p>simulation allows us to evaluate the best-case (and unrealistic) scenario of instant, complete replacement, to put a limit on how much benefit such a move brings. Figure 9.12 shows what happens. The rate of CO2 emission would immediately drop to 1.8 ppm/year.<sup id="fnref:37"><a href="#fn:37" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">37</a></sup> That definitely helps, but the total emission by 2100-if carrying on at today&rsquo;s energy demand via fossil fuels-would climb to 268 ppmy. The effect would more than double the 123 ppm, that we&rsquo;ve already contributed to the atmosphere, and would approximately double the pre-industrial CO2 level in the atmosphere, leading to a forcing of 3.6 $W/m^2$ and AT ≈ 2.9°C (summarized in Table 9.5). So as beneficial as the termination of coal would be, any path that involves carrying our fossil fuel use forward at today&rsquo;s levels even substituting the best form for the worst form-does not look promising.

Table 9.7: Energy requirements to heat up (thermally &ldquo;charge&rdquo;) Earth components, derived from Table 9.6. The energy investment for the first three components depends on the temperature change sought, while melting ice is independent of temperature change.
Example 9.4.1 We will use the ocean as an example of how to interpret and use Table 9.7. The two numbers tell us what it takes to heat up the ocean per meter of depth and to heat the entire volume.
If we ask how much energy it would take to raise the temperature of the upper 10 m of the ocean by 2.5°C, we multiply 1.5 x $10^{21}$ J/m/°C by 10 m and 2.5°C to get 3.75 x $10^{22}$ J. Heating the entire volume of the ocean by 0.5°C would require 5.9 x $10^{24}$ J/°C times 0.5°C for 3 x $10^{24}$ J of energy.
Similarly but without any temperature element-it would take ~ 49 x $10^{21}$ J to melt 10 m of Earth&rsquo;s ice, and would take 8.8 x $10^{24}$ J to
melt it all.
We are now in a position to appreciate how long it can take to change temperatures on a planetary scale for a certain imbalance in radiative forcing. If, for instance, the imbalance is 1 $W/m^2$,55 then Earth receives an extra 5.1 x $10^{14}$ J each second, or 1.6 x $10^{22}$ J in a year.<sup id="fnref1:33"><a href="#fn:33" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">33</a></sup> We can compare this annual surplus energy to the values in Table 9.7 to understand how deeply the components would be heated or melted per year for a 1 $W/m^2$ radiative forcing imbalance.
Example 9.4.2 If we could direct all of the annual surplus 1.6 × $10^{22}$ J arising from a 1 $W/m^2$ imbalance into one component only,<sup id="fnref1:11"><a href="#fn:11" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">11</a></sup> we could ask: to what depth will each component be heated by 1°C or melt the ice?</p>

From this, we see that land is more easily heated, and ice is most resistant-only shaving about 3 m per year if somehow the entire wrath of radiative imbalance were directed upon it.
Likewise, we can explore how long it would take to raise the temperature of entire components or melt all of the ice-for an imbalance of 1 $W/m^2$.
Example 9.4.3 If we could direct all of the annual surplus 1.6 × 1022 J arising from a 1 $W/m^2$ imbalance into one component only,<sup id="fnref1:35"><a href="#fn:35" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">35</a></sup> we could ask: how much will the temperature rise of the entire body be per year, or how much ice would melt?
If the radiative forcing imbalance is larger or smaller than 1 $W/m^2$, the effect will be proportionally deeper or shallower. Likewise, if we ask about a temperature increase larger than 1°C, the depth would be smaller in proportion.</p>

The atmosphere is a wimp: it takes very little to change its temperature. The ocean, however, is very sluggish to change temperature. For ice, we look at fractional loss per year instead of temperature increase.
59
What we learn from the examples is that the ocean and ice are both substantial thermal brakes on fast heating. Even though ice has a much larger energy cost per kg, its total mass is substantially smaller than that of the entire ocean-the two effects roughly balancing. In reality, we might expect oceanic circulation patterns to concentrate heating in the upper layers rather then distributing uniformly to the full depth. So the upper layer of the ocean-which then controls air temperature can reach a 1°C increase well before 367 years elapse. Indeed, we are already seeing warming at this scale in less than a century.
60
The way things really work is that the excess 1.6 x 1022 J annually associated with a radiative excess of 1 $W/m^2$ gets distributed into lots of channels at once. If ice only gets 3% of the attention in proportion to its area, only 5 × 1020 J goes into the ice in a year. Dividing by 4.9 × 1021 J/m (from Table 9.7), we find that we might expect 0.1 m of ice to disappear each
Since the ocean is roughly 25 times larger than the ice areas, year. the associated sea level rise from redistributing the ice melt across the entire ocean surface would be about 25 times less, or about 4 mm/yr.<sup id="fnref2:18"><a href="#fn:18" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">18</a></sup>
Meanwhile, the constant, swirling contact between water and air, and between air and land, keeps all three in sync with each other: one will not race off to get hot without the others. And in this case, the ocean-with its giant thermal mass and extensive air-water interface is the limiting
As before, this pretends that the entire radiative imbalance is directed upon a single component, in turn. If the radiative imbalance is larger or smaller than 1 $W/m^2$, the effect will be proportionally more or less

factor on how fast things can heat up. If we confine ocean heating to the top 300 m62 of water, the excess 1.6 × 1022 J per year leads to an annual temperature rise of about 0.035°C per year, or about 30 years to climb 1°C (at a 1 $W/m^2$ imbalance).
Although this section may seem to be long, convoluted, and perhaps even boring, it accomplished a number of things for us:</p>
<ol>
<li>it showed how a change in GHG absorption fraction leads to a
radiative forcing imbalance;</li>
<li>it indicated how a radiative imbalance changes the surface temperature until the earth re-establishes a new equilibrium (balance) at a higher temperature, including feedback effects;</li>
<li>it assessed energy requirements for heating up relevant masses of
material and melting ice via straightforward physics;</li>
<li>it showed that the two most important thermal masses on the
planet are the ocean (first) and the ice sheets (second);</li>
<li>it established approximate timescales over which we might expect temperature to climb, and why the ocean in particular is important in slowing down the consequences.
An additional insight is that even if we stopped CO2 emissions today, Earth&rsquo;s temperature will continue to climb as the oceans slowly adjust to the new radiative reality imposed by 420 ppm, of CO2 in the atmosphere.

1880, sea level has risen about 230 mm At the current rate, we would expect a comparable addition by 2100 for a total of 0.5 m.
But the current rate is not likely to be the right measure, since warming air temperatures result in a faster rate of ice melting. Positive feedbacks also accelerate ice melt. For instance, melted pools of water on top of the ice are darker than ice, increasing the rate at which solar energy is absorbed.
We can get a quick handle on how much sea level rise might possibly be in store, based on the fact that the vast majority of &ldquo;permanent&rdquo; ice on the planet is in Antarctica and Greenland. These two ice sheets constitute 2.7% and 0.3% of the globe&rsquo;s surface area, respectively. From there, it is easy to estimate sea level rise, because the ocean (71% of the globe) has an area 26 times bigger than the Antarctic ice sheet and 210 times larger than the Greenland ice. What this means is that it takes 26 meters of ice
melting from Antarctica64 to raise sea level by 1 meter, and 210 meters off Greenland to do the same.<sup id="fnref:38"><a href="#fn:38" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">38</a></sup> See Figure 9.17 to understand the logic here.</p>
<p>Coastal cities are already struggling to deal with the present ~0.25 m rise. This may not sound like much, and on normal days does not cause problems. But the low pressure associated with storms results in a local swell in water level,<sup id="fnref:39"><a href="#fn:39" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">39</a></sup> so that a storm plus high tide plus heavy waves adds to the climate-change rise to destroy human structures that otherwise may have escaped harm. Even if CO2 emissions ceased today, the warming that has already happened will continue melting ice. Temperatures will also continue to climb as increased forcing from the already-present CO2 continues to heat the ocean as we creep toward equilibrium a slow process. So sea-level rise may turn out to be the gift that keeps on giving for centuries more.
Sea level in the distant past-tens of millions of years ago—has been as high as 200 m over where it is now. And 20,000 years ago, during the last glacial maximum, sea level was 120 m lower than it is today <sup id="fnref:40"><a href="#fn:40" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">40</a></sup>. So Earth is no stranger to large fluctuations in sea level. By contrast, many coastal cities do not know how to handle even a one meter rise-which is within the projections for 2100 in a number of models.

2. How many kilograms of CO2 are produced from consuming a 40 L tank of gasoline? Compare the result to typical human mass. Gasoline is about 0.75 kg/L.
3. Typical household electricity use in the U.S. is about 30 kilowatthours (kWh) per day. If the electricity is produced by a natural gas plant operating at 40% efficiency, each household requires 75 kWh of energy from natural gas each day. Converting this to Joules, and using the intensity of 49 g/MJ from Table 9.1, how much CO2 is produced daily to supply a house with electricity from a natural gas source?
4. Americans use energy at an average rate of 10,000 W. Convert this to Joules in a day, then MJ, then use a representative number75 in the right-hand column of Table 9.1 to estimate an approximate CO2 emission per American per day, in kg. Compare this to the mass of a typical person.
5. Getting more specific, Americans, on average, get about 320 MJ per person from oil each day, 265 MJ from gas, and 110 MJ from coal. Based on the CO2 mass per energy column in Table 9.1, how much mass, in kg, of CO2 does an American produce per day from each of these sources, and in total? Compare this daily emission to the mass of a person.
6. If carbon dioxide emission is a chief concern, switching from a coal-fired electricity plant to natural gas input is still a use of fossil fuels, but natural gas produces less CO2 per energy unit than coal (Table 9.1). By what factor would CO2 emissions be reduced if replacing all energy76 we now get from coal with energy from natural gas?
7. Divide the total CO2 increase by the annual CO2 increase in Figure 9.3 to get a timescale in years. Compare this timescale to the period over which we have been burning fossil fuels (e.g., Figure 9.2). Do they agree? If not, what reason would you offer?
8. The right-hand panel of Figure 9.3 is an accumulation of the values on the left-hand side-representing the area under the left-hand curve, for instance. Since the gas trend on the left looks like a triangle, it is easy to approximate its area.<sup id="fnref:41"><a href="#fn:41" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">41</a></sup> Does the result match the right-most value for gas in the right-hand plot?
9. According to the fossil fuel history shown in Figure 9.2, the world currently gets energy from coal at a rate of 5 TW. From this, figure out how many ppm/year we add in CO2 from coal, following the outline in Table 9.2 and Box 9.1. Use a typical coal energy density of 6.5 kcal/g and a mass ratio of 3.67 CO2 g/g.<sup id="fnref:42"><a href="#fn:42" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">42</a></sup> The result should match information gleaned from Figure 9.3.

11. What letter grade would you give to the performance of the red curve in Figure 9.4 for its faithful tracking of the measured CO2 blue curve? Describe reasons why you might deduct any points.
12. The allocation of CO2 emissions among countries in Figure 9.5 differs pretty markedly from the distribution in Table 9.3. What does this tell us about past and present activity among countries?
13. Use a modified version of Eq. 9.2 to compute what the earth&rsquo;s temperature would be if it had no greenhouse gases and absorbed 100% of incident solar energy. 80
Is this warmer or cooler than the actual average surface temperature (given GHG and ~30% reflection)?81
14. Based on Figures 9.7 and 9.8, is the atmosphere transparent or opaque at a wavelength of 1.0 um? What about at 6 μm? And how would you characterize the situation at 2 um?
15. If enough ice on Earth melted and resulted in 25% reflectance instead of 29.3%, what would the equilibrium temperature become, still applying the nominal 33 K GHG contribution? How much temperature rise is this compared to the equilibrium temperature at 29.3% reflection?
16. Table 9.4 has H2O as the leading greenhouse gas, and all of them adding to 33 °C of warming effect on Earth. Should it be our goal to reduce all of these effects to the lowest numbers possible?82 Why or why not? How would you characterize the greenhouse effect and why it is of concern to us?
17. Treating Figure 9.9 somewhat literally, in which one out of every four infrared photons escapes without being absorbed by a greenhouse gas molecule, what would the effective upward radiation be if 400 $W/m^2$ left the ground, and re-radiation of the absorbed fraction was split equally between upward radiation and radiation returning to the ground?83
18. If the &ldquo;bad&rdquo; news that we are about halfway through the fossil fuels is wrong, and we are only one-quarter of the way through, and we end up using all of it, what would the ultimate CO2 concentration be in ppm, extrapolating the increase so far? How many degrees would this turn into based on our understanding of radiative forcing and the climate sensitivity parameter?
19. Using Eq. 9.5 and CO2,orig = 280 ppm, together with a climate sensitivity parameter of 0.8°C per $W/m^2$, how much would you predict Earth&rsquo;s temperature to rise for CO2 levels of 330, 380, 430, 480, 530, and 580 ppm, 284 The inputs increase by steps of 50</p>

c) an increase in forest fire activity burns lots of carbon-based
material and leaves a blackened earth
d) snow covers less of the land each winter as temperatures rise</li>
<li>Coal is, and always has been, the worst offender of the fossil fuels in terms of CO2 emission. Based on the scenarios summarized in Table 9.5, what is the percentage reduction in final temperature rise (AT) based on emissions out to 2100 (in the case that we hold steady at today&rsquo;s fossil fuel levels) if we substitute natural gas for all uses of coal vs. if we keep things the same?</li>
<li>Which of the scenarios in Section 9.3 do you deem to be most realistic, and why? Given this, how much more eventual warming is likely in store compared to the 1°C to date?</li>

<li>Construct your own panel in the manner of Figure 9.15 corresponding to the third case in Section 9.3 in which we curtail fossil fuel use by 2100, resulting in a final equilibrium AT of 2.6°C (thus 290.6 K ground temperature).

<li>On a sunny day after a big snowfall, the (low winter) sun might put 500 $W/m^2$ onto the ground. Snow reflects most of it, but let&rsquo;s say that it absorbs 5% of the incoming energy.

<li>If the ocean absorbs an additional 3 $W/m^2$ of forcing,8% how long would it take to heat the ~4 km deep column of water directly under a particular square meter (thus 4 x 106 kg) by 1°C?87</li>

Tips: Upgoing radiation from the ground is computed from oT4. Verify that you can match the first or last (equilibrium) panel of Figure 9.15 by the same technique to know if you are doing it right.
Hint: It is easiest just to consider a single square meter of surface and figure out what fraction of a cubic meter (thus what fraction of a meter-depth) melts. Ignore any effect of air temperature.</p>
<p>forcing is 3 x 1022 J per year. How much would the temperature of the top 10 m of ocean rise in one year at this level?
29. If we somehow maintained a steady 2 x 1022 J/yr of unbalanced
input indefinitely, how long would it take to:
a) raise the entire ocean temperature by 1°C?
b) melt all the ice?
c) raise the entire atmosphere&rsquo;s temperature by 1°C? d) heat up the top 100 m of earth&rsquo;s land area?
The sum of all these is how long it would take to get all of these tasks done, even though they would be happening in parallel.
30. On a planet 60% covered in ocean, and 5% covered in a 3 km thick ice sheet on top of land, how much would the sea level rise if all the ice melted?
31. On a planet two-thirds covered in ocean, and 1% covered by an ice sheet melting at a rate of 1 meter per year, how fast would sea level be rising?
32. How might you express the tradeoffs between the available fossil fuel resource and climate change? In other words, if it turns out that we don&rsquo;t have nearly as much fossil fuel as we think, what does this mean for climate change vs. our economic/geopolitical stability and viability? On the other hand, if we have centuries of fossil fuels left, what does that mean? Which scenario is least disruptive?
33. If it were certain that the only way to provide a comfortable existence to future generations involved substantial cutbacks toward a lifestyle having far fewer energy and material comforts today, do you think humanity would voluntarily do so? Can we leave treats on the shelf, within easy reach? If so, is it only uncertainty that prevents us? If not, what do you see as the barriers?

Greenhouse gases
Naïvely speaking, going from 280 ppm, to 420 ppm, (an increase by a factor of 1.5), might be expected to turn the 8.6°C greenhouse effect from CO2 into 12.9°C (1.5x) for a 4.3 degree human-caused warming.<sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup> But the CO2 absorption feature at 15 um is saturated, so as CO2 is added, it becomes wider, but logarithmically rather than linearly as a function of CO2 concentration. Climate scientists often express the impact of various influences as a radiative forcing, measured in $W/m^2$.
Definition 9.2.1 Radiative forcing is used to describe the areal power (in $W/m^2$) of absorbed solar energy and infrared radiation to space. Various influences or constituents each contribute their own radiative forcing. In equilibrium, a balance exists so that the net25 radiative forcing is zero.
The average solar forcing is
RF = 1360 $W/m^2$ x 0.707/4≈ 240 $W/m^2$,
(9.3)
sharing substantial overlap with Eq. 9.2-the factors having been explained in that context. Without adding to the pre-industrial set of greenhouse gases (GHGs), we would solve for temperature26 as
Figure 9.9: In the absence of greenhouse gases, infrared radiation has no difficulty escaping to space (left). When greenhouse gases (GHGs) are present (right), most of the infrared radiation is absorbed by GHG molecules. These molecules later release the absorbed energy as new infrared radiation, but in a randomized direction, so that some energy is returned to the ground, thereby keeping the surface warmer than it would be without greenhouse gases.&#160;<a href="#fnref:8" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

Figure 9.15: Four steps to illustrate (in a grossly simplified way) the process of Earth adapting to an increase in greenhouse gas (GHG). Starting from the left within each panel, solar input is held constant at 240 $W/m^2$. Most of the radiation leaving the ground-quantitatively adhering to oT1-is absorbed by GHGs (fraction absorbed indicated in GHG &ldquo;cloud&rdquo;), the rest escaping directly to space. Half the absorbed energy is radiated up (escaping) and half back down. The dashed arrow at right is the net radiation escaping. Integer numbers are in $W/m^2$, and arrow widths are scaled accordingly. Ground temperature is indicated at bottom. See text for narrative sequence.
Figure 9.15 sums up the story.<sup id="fnref:16"><a href="#fn:16" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">16</a></sup> The first panel shows the pre-industrial equilibrium condition, in which 77% of the infrared radiation from the ground was intercepted by the greenhouse gases, while 23% (90 $W/m^2$)&#160;<a href="#fnref:15" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

directly escaped. The 77% absorbed (300 $W/m^2$) is re-radiated equally up and down (150 $W/m^2$ each). The net outgoing radiation matches the 240 $W/m^2$ solar input exactly, signaling equilibrium.
47
Pretend that we suddenly increased the CO2 concentration to 420 ppm in one instant, which takes us to the second panel of Figure 9.15. The ground has not had time to change temperature yet, but the added GHG absorbs more of the outgoing radiation (78%). Now the numbers are not balanced. Only 238 $W/m^2$ radiates away, leaving a 2 $W/m^2$ net influx of energy. This is what we have been calling the radiative forcing.
49
After some time (third panel; representing our current status, roughly), the extra input energy starts to heat up the earth environment to 289 K (16°C),48 which cranks up the radiation leaving the ground according to the σT4 radiation law. At the same time, the higher temperature drives some positive feedback effects, putting more GHG into the atmosphere and raising the absorption fraction. Meanwhile, the imbalance has moderated to 1 $W/m^2$ as the system edges toward a new equilibrium.
Finally, equilibrium is re-established in the last panel of Figure 9.15, at which point outgoing energy and incoming energy are again matched at 240 $W/m^2$. The feedback mechanisms essentially tripled the change in GHG absorption: initially a 1% bump ultimately becoming 3%. Without this effect, the system would equilibrate at 288.6 K (15.6°C),50 in which case 393 $W/m^2$ leaves the ground, and 153 $W/m^2$ is re-radiated from the atmosphere.
9.4.2 Heating Earth&rsquo;s Skin
Let&rsquo;s now understand a bit more about the process of heating up the Earth&rsquo;s air, water, land, and ice during the time when outgoing energy does not match incoming energy.<sup id="fnref1:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> We know from Sec. 6.2 (p. 85) that it takes energy to change something&rsquo;s temperature. For instance, it takes 4,184 J to raise the temperature of a kilogram (liter) of water by 1°C, or about 1,000 J for many other substances like air and rock. Also relevant, and not introduced before, is that it takes a substantial amount of energy to melt ice.
Definition 9.4.1 The heat of fusion of ice is 334 J per gram, meaning that every gram of ice that goes from just below freezing to just above 52 requires an input of 334 J.
To put this in context, that same 334 J would heat a gram of liquid water by 80°C, but gets eaten up in the phase change without changing the temperature really at all.<sup id="fnref:17"><a href="#fn:17" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">17</a></sup>
Using the properties of various constituents in Table 9.6, we can construct Table 9.7 to describe how much energy is needed to &ldquo;charge up&rdquo; different planetary components to a different temperature. 54 Note that the ocean.

<p>&hellip; eliminating carbon sinks and compromising nature&rsquo;s ability to adapt
9 Climate Change
158
The last chapters in this book, beginning with Chapter 18, deal with human factors that contribute to our prospects, ending at Chapter 20 discussing mitigation strategies at the individual level. It&rsquo;s not geoengineering, but behavioral adaptation leading to reduction can have a huge impact, if broadly adopted.
9.6 Upshot: Climate Change is Serious
Despite the ease with which we can demonstrate that the measured CO2 is from fossil fuels, and the straightforward physics governing the equilibrium temperature in the face of greenhouse gases, it is astounding that we are not fully embracing reality. But perhaps it should not be surprising. Climate change is a clear-and-present affront to some economic and political ideologies that wish we would let markets set our path, with no consequence. But operating in denial and insisting that we keep to the way things worked in the past is not our smartest play. Climate change is a stark indication that we can&rsquo;t just do whatever makes us the most money. Alternatives to fossil fuels are expensive and less convenient. Climate change is bad for business, and also threatens capitalism by imposing limits on our ambitions. It is little wonder that the U.S. has been among the most resistant to accepting climate change realities, being the most proud capitalist country, boasting an enormous per-capita energy demand, and having contributed the most to global CO2 emissions throughout history (Figure 9.5).

As real as climate change is, it is less clear whether it represents an existential threat to civilization.<sup id="fnref:24"><a href="#fn:24" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">24</a></sup> As costly as it may be to adapt, the changes are gradual enough on a human timescale to possibly be manageable though decidedly less than fun.
Resource74 disruptions, however, can send markets into free-fall and stimulate global military actions that could be far more devastating on a shorter timescale. We are in a sort of a race to see which causes the biggest problem the soonest. With luck, a third option presents itself that does not involve such hardship. But just keep in mind that human society is a highly nonlinear construct that could become unrecognizably disrupted on a much faster scale than will be the case for the physics-governed unfolding of climate change.&#160;<a href="#fnref:23" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

The curve computed from fossil fuel use overlaps the Keeling Curve so faithfully that little mystery is left as to where the excess CO2 in our atmosphere originates. The chemistry and historical use of fossil fuels are not in dispute. The only &ldquo;fudge&rdquo; is in what fraction of the CO2 emitted from fossil fuel combustion remains in the atmosphere vs. being absorbed by the ocean and other &ldquo;sinks.&rdquo; Empirically, about half stays in the atmosphere, while the rest disappears into the ocean, and into plant matter that gets buried in the ground. If unaware of the oceanic and land absorption mechanisms, we would have overestimated the amount of CO2 due to fossil fuels by a factor of two (see Box 9.2).

solving to T≈ 255 K, or -18°C (about 0°F). This is about 33°C colder than the 288 K (15°C; 59°F) we actually observe as the average temperature of Earth. The 33°C difference18 is due to greenhouse gases-mostly H2O-impacting the thermal balance by preventing most radiation from escaping directly to space.
We understand this mechanism perfectly. Being at a temperature of 288 K, the surface emission peaks at a wavelength around 10 μm.<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup> The atmosphere is not transparent at all wavelengths, its various absorption features depicted in Figure 9.7. The blue curve at upper right in this figure is the emission spectrum associated with infrared radiation.
Of the greenhouse gases contributing to absorption as pictured in Figure 9.7, water vapor is the dominant player, followed by CO2. Notice that the blue solid portion in the figure20 is mirrored in white in the total absorption panel just below,<sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup> and that the window is mostly defined by water vapor. But the right-hand-longer wavelength-side of the water window is stepped on by the CO2 absorption feature, seen more clearly in Figure 9.8. This CO2 feature is responsible for the sharp cutoff on the

<p>In the spirit of an approximate estimate, we ignore the 10% difference in the density of ice vs. water and assume that one cubic meter of ice displaces one cubic meter of
water.
Now if we just knew the average thickness of each ice sheet, we could figure out how much sea level would rise if all the ice melted. The Greenland ice sheet is estimated to be 2.85 million cubic kilometers, translating to an average depth of 1.7 km.<sup id="fnref:19"><a href="#fn:19" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">19</a></sup> 210 m goes into this 8 times, so we might expect something like 8 m of sea level rise if all the ice in Greenland melts. For Antarctica, the 26.5 million cubic kilometers corresponds to an average ice thickness of 1.9 km, which is about 70 of our 26 meter units, so we would expect about 70 meters of sea level rise in the extreme case of Antarctica losing all of its ice.
Box 9.3: A more rigorous estimate&hellip;
It is relatively easy to find references estimating sea level rise potential from complete melting of Greenland and Antarctica. One such <sup id="fnref:20"><a href="#fn:20" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">20</a></sup> arrives at a 7.4 m rise from Greenland melting, 58 m from Antarctica, and 0.3 m from glaciers.
So why did we go through the crude estimation process? The goal was to remove the mystery.<sup id="fnref:21"><a href="#fn:21" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">21</a></sup> Once we have an estimate of the depth and a ratio of surface areas, it is within our grasp to estimate the rise ourselves.

9.4.3 Sea Level Rise
The previous section covered the energetics of melting ice sheets. The resulting melt-water flows to the ocean63 and contributes to sea level rise. Besides melting ice, sea level also rises as a consequence of thermal expansion of water as it warms up. Figure 9.16 shows the recent history.
