 Akira Hayami on decline of domestic animals in Edo era
</details>


Looking at the decrease in livestock as an example, in 838 villages in the Mino and Owari regions (Nagoya Domain territory), where comparison is possible, the absolute number of cows and horses decreased by approximately 45%, from 17,825 to 8,104 between the years 1660 and 1810. Moreover, the population increased dur ing this period, so the number of cows and horses per capita decreased by approxi- mately 35%, from 0.055 to 0.019. The greatest decreases were in the Owari plains, and there was a 15% decrease in the Nakashima and Kaito districts (conversely, there was a 59% decrease in the mountain districts in Mino). Thus, the cows and horses still being used for agriculture in the 1670s were practically no longer in use by 1810. This tells us that for farming, animal labor was replaced by human labor.
