## Oil and comfort
No u won't find oil in any random place, no technology cannot create oil (in ground anyways, u can do coal to oil at a cost), most important keeping u comfortable in future isn't AI but oil, gas, & coal

## Dutch failure

1 kg of glass needed at least 2400 kg of wood to produce, such examples can be multiplied endlessly. Dutch were ahead of everyone for a century but never broke through as they were stuck with peat, its not enough to have inventiveness without easy coal. 

In the Dutch case, peat would have been exhausted quiet quickly by industrial civ, English coal was "infinite" in comparison

The amount of wood required to produce charcoal, and later charcoal used for smelting was enough to cause deforestation on a large scale. Why English were forced to move to coal ahead of other parts of the world? Because use of charcoal was wiping out their forests.

5kg wood to produce 1 kg charcoal  
8kg of charcoal to produce 1kg of pig iron

Massive increase in iron production in England after the switch from charcoal to coal, and the discovery and creation of steam engines
Making England the top producer in the world

## Mineral extraction
The extraction needed keeps going up as all the high ore grades were exhausted long back. Lower ore grades = more diesel needed. [cu-chile](https://mining-journal.com/base-metals/resourcestocks/4069657/chile-worlds-most-prolific-copper-producing-country)
