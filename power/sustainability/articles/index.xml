      <description>&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/4p4qt7/comment/d4il898/&#34;&gt;TW&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Thank you for asking this! My PhD thesis is on prehistoric ecological change in the eastern Levant, so I could talk about this all day, but since you&amp;rsquo;ve already got two good answers and I&amp;rsquo;ve already spent too much time replying to them, I&amp;rsquo;ll have to try and keep this short. (Try.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-fertile-crescent&#34;&gt;The Fertile Crescent&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The first thing to consider is that the Middle East is huge and very geographically diverse. Our image of it in the West tends to be fixated on the desert. And a lot of it is desert. There are &lt;a href=&#34;http://i.imgur.com/4NNmaxU.jpg&#34;&gt;scrubby deserts&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://i.imgur.com/UHD1DW1.jpg&#34;&gt;weird rocky deserts&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&#34;https://aos.iacpublishinglabs.com/question/aq/700px-394px/arabian-desert_3931286889d2d196.jpg?domain=cx.aos.ask.com&#34;&gt;proper sandy deserts&lt;/a&gt;. But there are also &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.timeforiran.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/53017176-e1416993494408.jpg&#34;&gt;snowy mountains in Iran&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.turkishclass.com/static/images/tc_pictures/upload/78/van_golu_800_600_jpg_1.jpg&#34;&gt;lakes in Turkey&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://america.aljazeera.com/content/ajam/articles/2014/7/13/restoring-iraqs-lostmarshes/jcr:content/mainpar/adaptiveimage/src.adapt.960.high.iraq_marsh.1405196806844.jpg&#34;&gt;marshes in Iraq&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.habeeb.com/images/lebanon.photos/Pine_Trees/Lebanese_pine_trees_017.jpg&#34;&gt;forests in Lebanon&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

In the coming 1970s, soaring populations and finite global resources would lead hundreds of millions of people to starve to death. Or so prophesized Paul and Anne Ehrlich in their book The Population Bomb. Paul Ehrlich, a Stanford entomologist, gained unlikely fame as an outrider of the apocalypse. He went on Johnny Carson and declared that “the end” was near.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;(En route, March 21)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Modern urban-industrial man is given to the raping of anything and everything natural on which he can fasten his talons. He rapes the sea; he rapes the soil; he rapes the natural resources of the earth. He rapes the atmosphere. He rapes the future of his own civilization. Instead of living off nature&amp;rsquo;s surplus, which he ought to do, he lives off its substance.+++(5)+++&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;He would not need to do this were he less numerous, and were he content to live a more simple life. But he is prepared neither to reduce his numbers nor to lead a simpler and more healthful life. So he goes on destroying his own environment, like a vast horde of locusts. And he must be expected, persisting blindly as he does in this depraved process, to put an end to his own existence within the next century. The years 2000 to 2050 should witness, in fact, the end of the great Western civilization. The Chinese, more prudent and less spoiled, no less given to over-population but prepared to be more ruthless in the control of its effects, may inherit the ruins.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

A new history of energy » by Jean-Baptiste Fressoz, we republished a detailed interview from May 2023 where he developed the theses of his book. In the conclusion of his work, he writes that « transition is the ideology of capital in the 21st century. Thanks to it, capital is on the right side of the climate fight. »&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Image credit: Petr Adamek.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(PhysOrg.com) &amp;ndash; The 440 commercial nuclear reactors in use worldwide are currently helping to minimize our consumption of fossil fuels, but how much bigger can nuclear power get? In an analysis to be published in a future issue of the Proceedings of the IEEE, Derek Abbott, Professor of Electrical and Electronic Engineering at the University of Adelaide in Australia, has concluded that nuclear power cannot be globally scaled to supply the world’s energy needs for numerous reasons. The results suggest that we’re likely better off investing in other energy solutions that are truly scalable.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Bill Rees’s big shoes: ‘ecological footprint’ inventor&lt;br&gt;&#xA;By Deborah Jones&lt;br&gt;&#xA;VANCOUVER, Canada 2005&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The epiphany that has driven William Rees’ life, and led to the creation of a scientific term that would make him famous, struck him at age 8.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;As Rees tucked into a hearty lunch on the family farm in southern Ontario,&lt;br&gt;&#xA;“I realized that I had a hand in growing every single thing on my plate,” he says.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;“I had an overwhelming sense of being connected to the earth, that we are, literally, what we eat.”&lt;br&gt;&#xA;That meal of roast beef, chicken, vegetables and apple pie launched Rees, now 61, on his life’s mission:&lt;br&gt;&#xA;to study humans as integral parts of the natural environment.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;details&gt;&lt;summary&gt;विस्तारः (द्रष्टुं नोद्यम्)&lt;/summary&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I would like to acknowledge and thank Rick Lakin, a teacher at Hilltop High School, 555 Claire Avenue, Chula Vista, CA 91911. Mr. Lakin obtained a copy of this speech from a biographer of ADM. Rickover. With the help of a student, he scanned and posted it at The Energy Bulletin.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Congressman Roscoe G. Bartlett&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;a href=&#34;http://energybulletin.net/23151.html&#34;&gt;http://energybulletin.net/23151.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Published on Saturday, December 2, 2006 by Energy Bulletin&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Source: &lt;a href=&#34;http://large.stanford.edu/courses/2011/ph240/klein1/docs/rickover.pdf&#34;&gt;TW&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Editorial Notes&lt;/p&gt;</description>

I respect Russell Means, one who had the courage to stand tall for what he believed in. Driven by the sufferings of his people, right or wrong, he spoke from his heart. Many things he said helped to open my eyes in good ways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Phillip B Gottfredson&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The following speech was given by Russell Means in July 1980, before several thousand people who had assembled from all over the world for the Black Hills International Survival Gathering, in the Black Hills of South Dakota. It is Russell Means&amp;rsquo;s most famous speech.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Central Role of Energy in Soddy&amp;rsquo;s Holistic and&#xA;Critical Approach to Nuclear Science, Economics,&#xA;and Social Responsibility&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Thaddeus J. Trenn&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The British Journal for the History of Science / Volume 12 / Issue 03 / November 1979, pp 261 -&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&#34;https://sci-hub.scrongyao.com/10.1017/s0007087400017325&#34;&gt;TW&lt;/a&gt;&#xA;Link to this article: &lt;a href=&#34;http://journals.cambridge.org/abstract_S0007087400017325&#34;&gt;http://journals.cambridge.org/abstract_S0007087400017325&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The fact remains that, if the supply of energy failed, modern civilization would come to an end as abruptly as does the music of an organ deprived of wind. [But]&amp;hellip; the still unrecognized &amp;rsquo;energy problem&amp;rsquo;&amp;hellip; awaits the future&amp;hellip;I&lt;br&gt;&#xA;F. SODDY, 1912&lt;/p&gt;</description>
