Their limitations become apparent in the fact that nutrition deteriorated steadily from the late Middle Ages, especially in qualitative terms. It has already been noted that under the condition of agrarian production, population growth in a particular area is expressed in people being provisioned at a lower trophic level. When population density grows in a solar energy system, it can be expected that meat consumption will decline in favour of vegetarian food. Precisely this process can be observed in Europe during the early modern period (Abel 1972, 1978; Montanari 1993).

In Germany annual meat consumption in the 14th and 15th centuries was about 100 kg per head. This figure was only reached again in the affluent society of the 20th century. In the 18th and early 19th century, the final phase of the agrarian system, meat consumption was 14 kg per person, i.e. it had dropped to an eighth. This sensational downturn saw the number of butchers in towns decline despite population growth. Of course, it must be remembered that the upper classes continued to consume meat in quantity, so that the general decline in meat consumption meant that the lower classes ate virtually no meat.
