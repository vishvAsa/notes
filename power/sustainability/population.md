## Carrying capacity

> Human ecologist William Rees made me familiar with the distinction between K-selected species (K for maximum carrying capacity) and R-selected species (R for maximum reproductive capacity). Humans are K-selected, which means they will expand as long as the carrying capacity allows. That's what happened with the green revolution and will indeed probably happen again if we are able to increase yields.
