SETTING THE STAGE: 
GROWTH AND LIMITATIONS 
We arrived late. 
All the good stuff was gone. Oh, what we would have paid. 
But no amount of money could bring it back. 
1 Exponential Growth 
Humans have amazing strengths, but also significant weaknesses. Chief among them, perhaps, is our collective difficulty in grasping the math- ematical consequences of exponential growth.1 This is an ironic state, given that our economic and political goals are often geared explicitly to support continued growth. The degree to which an expectation and desire for continued growth is woven into our society makes it important to examine the phenomenon carefully, so that we might avoid building upon a shaky foundation. In this chapter, we explore the general nature of exponential growth, in order to understand the impossibility of its long-term continuance by way of exposing various absurd consequences that uninterrupted growth prescribes. The upshot2 is that our societal framework eventually must face a mandatory departure from the current model-a piece of knowledge we should all lodge into the backs of our minds. Subsequent chapters will address applications to economic and population growth-including more realistic logistic growth curves, then pivot toward nailing down limits imposed by our finite planet. 
1.1 Bacteria in a Jar 
One hallmark of exponential growth is that the time it takes to double in size, or the doubling time, is constant. An important and convenient concept we will repeatedly use in this chapter is the rule of 70: 
Definition 1.1.1 Rule of 70: The doubling time associated with a percentage growth rate is just 70 divided by the percentage rate. A 1% growth rate doubles in 70 years, while a 2% rate doubles in 35 years, and a 10% rate doubles in 7 years. It also works for other timescales: if pandemic cases are increasing at a rate of 3.5% per day, the doubling time is 20 days.

We will see how the rule of 70 arises mathematically later in this chapter. But first, it is more important to understand the consequences. To make the math simple, let's say that a town's size doubles every 10 years (which by the rule of 70 corresponds to a 7% growth rate, incidentally). Starting in the year 1900 at 100 residents, we expect town population to be 200 in 1910, 400 in 1920, 800 in 1930, eventually climbing to over 100,000 by the year 2000 (see Table 1.1). Unabated 7% growth would result in the town reaching the current world population just 260 years after the experiment began. 
But let's explore an example that often reveals our faulty intuition around exponential growth. Here, we imagine a jar rich in resources, seeded with just the right number of bacteria so that if each bacterium splits every 10 minutes, the jar will become full of bacteria in exactly 24 hours. The experiment starts right at midnight. The question is: at what time will the jar be half full? 
Think about this on your own for a minute. Normal intuition might suggest a half-full jar at noon-halfway along the experiment. But what happens if we work backwards? The jar is full at midnight, and doubles every ten minutes. So what time is it half full? 
The answer is one doubling-time before midnight, or 11:50 PM. Figure 1.1 illustrates the story. At 11 PM, the jar is at one-64th capacity, or 1.7% full. So, for the first 23 of 24 hours, the jar looks basically empty. All the action happens at the end, in dramatic fashion.

10 minutes is perhaps a little fast for biology, but we're looking for easy understanding and picking convenient numbers. In prac- tice, 20-30 minutes may be more realistic. We will also ignore deaths for this "toy" ex- ample, although the net effect only changes the rate and not the overall behavior.

Figure 1.1: The last 90 minutes in the sequence of bacteria (green) growing in a jar, doubling every 10 minutes. For the first 22.5 hours, hardly anything would be visible. Note that the upward rise of green "bars" makes an exponential curve. 
Now let's imagine another illustrative scenario in connection with our jar of bacteria. The time is 11:30 PM: one-half hour before the end. The jar is one-eighth full. A thoughtful member of the culture projects the future and decides that more uninhabited resource-laden jars must be discovered in short order if the culture is to continue its trajectory. Imagine for a second the disbelief expressed by probably the vast majority of other inhabitants: the jar is far from full, and has served for 141 generations-a seeming eternity. Nonetheless, this explorer returns reporting three other equal-sized food-filled jars within easy reach. A hero's welcome! How much longer will the culture be able to continue growing? What's your answer?

The population doubles every ten minutes. If the original jar is filled at 12:00, the population doubles to fill the second jar by 12:10. Another doubling fills all four by 12:20. The celebration is short-lived. 
Now we draw the inevitable parallels. A planet that has served us for countless generations, and has seemed effectively infinite-imponderably large makes it difficult for us to conceive of hitting limits. Are we half-full now? One-fourth? One-eighth? All three options are scary, to different degrees. At a 2% rate of growth (in resource use), the doubling time is 35 years, and we only have about a century, even if at 1/8 full right now.3 
In relation to the bacteria parable, we've already done a fair bit of exploring. We have no more jars. One planet rhymes with jars, but it is hostile to human life, has no food, and is not within easy reach. We have no meaningful outlet. And even if we ignore the practical hardships, how much time would a second planet buy us anyway for uninterrupted growth? Another 35 years? 
1.1.1 Exponential Math 
Box 1.1: Advice on Reading Math 
This section is among the most mathematically sophisticated in the book. Don't let it intimidate you: just calmly take it in. Realize that exponential growth obeys an unchanging set of rules, and can be covered in just a few pages. Your brain can absorb it all if you give it a chance. Read paragraphs multiple times and find that each pass can add to your comprehension. Equations are just shorthand sentences5 capturing the essence of the concepts being covered, so rather than reading them as algorithms to file and use later when solving problems, work to comprehend the meaning behind each one and its reason for being a part of the development. In this way, what follows is not a disorganized jumble, recklessly bouncing between math and words, but one continuous development of thought expressed in two languages at once. The Preface offers additional thoughts related to this theme, and Appendix A provides a math refresher. 
The essential feature of exponential growth is that the scale goes as the power of some base (just some number) raised to the time interval. In the doubling sequence, we start at 1x the original scale, then go to 2x, then 4×, then 8x, etc. At each time interval, we multiply by 2 (the base). After 5 such intervals, for instance, we have 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 x 2, or 25 = 32. More generally, after n doubling times, we have increased by a factor of 2", where 2 is the base, and n is the number of doubling times. We might formalize this as

3: If we're at 1/8 right now and double every 35 years, we will be at 1/4 in 35 years, 1/2 in 70 years, and full in 105 years. 
4: Chapter 4 addresses space realities. 
Experts habitually read complicated pas- sages multiple times before the material sinks in. Maybe it's this calm habit that turns them into experts! 
5: Unlike words/language, the symbols chosen for equations are just labels and carry no intrinsic meaning-so electing to use x, n, t, b, M, etc. reflect arbitrary choices and can be substituted at will, if done con- sistently. The content is in the structure of the equation/sentence. 
M =

where M represents the multiplicative scale, t is the elapsed time, and t2 is the symbol we choose to represent the doubling time-so that n = t/t2 is just "counting" the number of doubling times. 
Box 1.2: Interest Example 
The same process happens in a bank account accumulating interest. Let's consider that you deposit $100 into a bank account bearing 2% annual interest. At the end of one year, you'll have $102, which is 1.02 times the original amount. For the next year, it's 1.02 times $102, or $104.04, which is the original $100 times 1.02 x 1.02. Then in three years it will be $106.18, or $100 times 1.023. Having sussed out the pattern, after 35 years it would be $100 times 1.0235, which happens to come to $199.99. Notice that doubling in 35 years at 2% exactly obeys the rule of 70. Table 1.2 summarizes this example. 
The pattern-whether doubling, or applying interest as in Box 1.2-is that we multiply a chain of the same number, the base, over and over. This is the same as raising the base to some power-the power equaling how many times the base appears in the chain to get our overall factor. Therefore, if we designate the base as b and the number of times it appears as n, we have 
M = b2. 
(1.2) 
Now we're going to play a math trick that will help us compute various useful attributes of growth. The exponential and natural logarithm are inverse functions, each undoing the other. So In (ex) = x and elnx = x. We can use this trick to express the number 2 as eln2, or any base number b = elnb. For the special case of b = 2 (doubling), we then have: 
t/t2 
M = 21/12 = (eln 2) /12 = et In 2/12, 
(1.3) 
where we started with Eq. 1.1, re-expressed the number 2, and then applied the rule that raising a power to another power is the same as multiplying the powers to form a single one. By employing such tricks, we could cast any base to a power, like b* as some exponential function ex lnb, and thus can transform any "power" relationship into an exponential using base e≈ 2.7183. Casting Eq. 1.2 in this form: 
M=b" "In b 
= e 
(1.4) 
If we want to go backwards, and compute the time to reach a certain M factor, we can take the natural logarithm of both sides to learn that 
For instance, doubling has M = 2, tripling has M = 3, and increasing by 29% would mean M

6: As an example, think of (53) as (5 x5× 5)=(5x5x5)x(5×5×5)×(5×5×5)X(5× 
5 x 5), which is just 12 fives multiplied, or 512. So we effectively just multiplied the two exponents 3 and 4-to get the 12. It always works. Often, one need not memorize math rules: quick experimentation reveals how and why it works.

so that the number of applications of base, b, needed to achieve multi- plicative factor M is found by solving the equation above for n, in which

case we get: n = In M/ln b. 
Example 1.1.1 The time it would take to increase by a factor of 1,000 (M = 1000) at a rate of 1.07 (annual growth rate of 7%; b = 1.07) is n = ln M/ln 1.07 = 102 years. 
The rule of 70 can be recovered? by setting the multiplicative factor, M, to 2. Comparing to interest accumulation described by (1 + p), where p is the annual interest (0.02 for 2%, e.g.) and t is the number of years, Eq. 1.4 can be re-expressed by substituting b = 1+p and n = t as the number of years, then equating the result to the doubling time representation in Eq. 1.3 to form 
M = et In(1+p) = et In2/t2 
(1.6) 
From this expression, we can gather that ln(1 + p) = In 2/t2 by equating the exponents, and then see that the doubling time, t2, can be solved as 
t2 = In 2/ln(1+p). 
(1.7) 
For small values of p (much smaller than 1), the natural log of 1 + p is approximately p. In other words, when p = 0.02, In 1.02≈ 0.02≈ p. This is part of the reason why we chose e as our base, as it is mathematically "natural." Since ln 2≈ 0.693.70, the doubling time, t2, is approximately 70 divided by the annual growth rate, p, in percent. So the reason it's a rule of 70 for doubling (and not a rule of 60 or 80) is basically because the natural log of 2 (representing doubling) is roughly 0.70. 
Example 1.1.2 To tie some things together, let's look at a quantitative case that can be used to validate how various pieces relate to each other. We will describe a 5% annual growth rate. 
The rule of 70 (Definition 1.1.1) indicates a 14 year doubling time, so that we could define t2 appearing in Eqs. 1.1, 1.3, 1.6, and 1.7 to be 14 years. Calculating exactly using Eq. 1.7 yields 14.2 years. 
To evaluate growth in 10 years, we could use Eq. 1.1 with t = 10 and t2 = 14.2 to suggest M = 1.63, meaning a 63% increase in size (1.63 times as large as at the start). Or we could apply Eq. 1.2 using b = 1.05 and n = 10 to get the exact same result. Note that we have freedom to define the base as 1.05 or 2, and the corresponding number of steps (n) as 10 or t/t2 = 0.704, respectively, and get the same answer. In terms of the exponential form in Eq. 1.4, either pair of b and n produces 20.488 
If we wanted to "work backwards" and ask when the amount is 3 times the original (M = 3), we could use Eq. 1.5 to find that n is 22.5 steps at b = 1.05 (thus 22.5 years, since this base is the yearly increase). Had we used b = 2, we would compute n = 1.58, meaning that the scale would reach 3x after 1.58 doubling times, or 1.58t2 = 22.5 years. 
The same result happens if using log instead of ln: try it! 
7: What follows is a high-brow symbolic approach, but the same effective result can be achieved by setting M 2 in Eq. 1.5 and solving for n. 
Try it yourself to verify on a calculator, by sticking in various small amounts for p. 
Don't view this as a recipe for solving prob- lems, but as a way to romp through the section and help piece it together. 
= 
More generally, we are not confined to any particular base, b, having just seized upon two convenient and relevant possibil- ities. If we wanted b 10, we would have n = 0.211, for example. In this case, the interpretation is that our ten-year point is 21.1% of the way to a factor-of-ten multi- plication, so that 47.4 years at 5% growth results in a factor of 10 growth.

We can check the result using Eq. 1.6 by putting in t = 22.5 and p = 0.05 or t2 = 14.2 in the latter form. 
1.2 Exponential Energy Extrapolation 
Having established some basic principles of exponential growth, it's time for a first look at how we can use the math to argue about limits to our expectations. We'll concentrate on energy use. The United States Energy Information Administration (EIA) provides information on energy use from 1949 to the present. An appendix (E1: [3]) presents an approximate account of energy use from 1635-1945. Figure 1.2 displays the more recent portion of this history.

Lacking comparable data for the world, we use U.S. data simply to illustrate the more broadly applicable global growth trend. Even countries far behind are growing en- ergy use often faster than the 3% charac- teristic of U.S. history.

Note that the energy rate at the left edge of Figure 1.2 becomes almost invisibly small. Presenting the data on a logarithmic plot, as in Figure 1.3, we can better see the entire trajectory. On such a plot, exponentials become straight lines. The trend is remarkably consistent with an expo- nential (red line) for most of the history, at a rate just shy of 3% per year. Note that this total effect includes population growth, but population has not grown as fast as energy, so that per-capita energy has also risen. This makes sense: our lives today are vastly more energetically rich than lives of yesteryear, on a per-person basis. 
Having established that energy growth over the past several centuries is well-described by an exponential, we can explore the implications of continuing this trend forward. Starting at a present-day global energy production rate of 18×1012 Watts (18 TW), we adopt a convenient growth rate of 2.3% per year for this exercise. We pick this for two reasons: 1) it is more modest than the historical trend, so will not over-exaggerate the

The astute reader might note a departure from the exponential fit in recent years. This only reinforces the primary point of this chapter that sustaining exponential growth indefinitely is absurd and will not happen. If growth is destined to stop, perhaps we are beginning to experience its limits well before the theoretical timescales developed in this chapter. 
Watts is a unit of power, which is a rate of energy. Chapter 5 will cover the concept and units more thoroughly.

What follows is a flight of fancy that quickly becomes absurd, but we will chase it to staggering levels of absurdity just because it is fun, instructive, and mind-blowing. Bear in mind that what follows should not be taken as predictions of our future: rather, we can use the absurdity to predict how our future will not look! 
The sun deposits energy at Earth's surface at a rate of about 1,000 W/m2 (1,000 Watts per square meter; we'll reach a better understanding for these units in Chapter 5). Ignoring clouds, the projected area intercepting the sun's rays is just А = πR, where R is the radius of the earth, around 6,400 km. Roughly a quarter of the earth's surface is land, and adding it all up we get about 30 x 1015 W hitting land. If we put solar panels on every square meter of land converting sunlight to electrical energy at 20% efficiency,10 we keep 6 x 1015 W. This is a little over 300 times the current global energy usage rate of 18 TW. What an encouraging number! Lots of margin. How long before our growth would get us here? After one century, we're 10 times higher, and 100 times higher after two centuries. It would take about 2.5 centuries (250 years) to hit this limit. Then no more energy growth. 
But wait, why not also float panels on all of the ocean, and also magically improve performance to 100%? Doing this, we can capture a whopping 130 x 1015 W, over 7,000 times our current rate. Now we're talking about maxing out in just under 400 years. Each factor of ten is a century, so a factor of 10,000 would be four factors of ten (104), taking four centuries. 
So within 400 years, we would be at the point of using every scrap of

8: Fundamentally, this relates to the fact that the natural log of 10 is 2.30. The analog of Eq. 1.7 using 10 in place of 2 and p 0.023 for 2.3% growth rate will produce a factor- of-ten timescale t10≈ 100 years.

10,000 is not too different from 7,000, and the "rounding up" helps us conveniently make sense of the result, since a factor of 10,000 is easier to interpret as four applications of 10x, and thus 400 years.

solar energy hitting the planet at 100% efficiency. But our planet is a tiny speck in space. Why not capture all the light put out by the sun, in a sphere surrounding the sun (called a Dyson sphere; see Box 1.3)? Now we're talking some real power! The sun puts out 4 x 1026 W. If it were a light bulb, this would be its label (putting the 100 W standard incandescent bulb to shame). So the number is enormous. But the math is actually pretty easy to grasp.11 Every century gets another factor of ten. To go from where we are now (18 x 1012 W) to the solar regime is about 14 orders-of-magnitude. So in 1,400 years, 12 we would be at 18 x 1026 W, which is about 4.5 times the solar output. Therefore we would use the entire sun's output in a time shorter than the 2,000-year run of our current calendar. 
Box 1.3: Dyson Sphere Construction 
If we took the material comprising the entire Earth (or Venus) and created a sphere around the sun at the current Earth-Sun distance, it would be a shell less than 4 mm thick! And it's not necessarily ideal material stock for building a high-tech sphere and solar panels. The earth's atmosphere distributed over this area would be 0.015 m thick. Don't hold your breath waiting for this to happen. 
Bypassing boring realism, we recognize that our sun is not the only star in the Milky Way galaxy. In fact, we estimate our galaxy to contain roughly 100 billion stars! This seems infinite. A billion seconds is just over 30 years, so no one could count to 100 billion in a lifetime. But let's see: 100 billion is 1011. Immediately, we see that we buy another 11 centuries at our 2.3% rate. So it takes 1,100 years to go from consuming our entire sun to all the stars in our galaxy! That's 2,500 years from now, adding the two timescales, and still a civilization-relevant time period. Leave aside the pesky fact that the scale of our galaxy is 100,000 light years, so that we can't possibly get to all the stars within a 2,500 year timeframe. So even as a mathematical exercise, physics places yet another limit on how long we could conceivably expect to maintain our current energy growth trajectory. 
The unhinged game can continue, pretending we could capture all the light put out by all the stars in all the galaxies in the visible universe. Because the visible universe contains about 100 billion galaxies, we buy another 1,100 years. We can go even further, imagining converting all matter (stars, gas, dust) into pure energy (E= mc2), not limiting ourselves to only the light output from stars as we have so far. Even playing these unhinged games, we would exhaust all the matter in the visible universe within 5,000 years at a 2.3% rate. The exponential is a cruel beast. Table 1.3 summarizes the results. 
The point is not to take seriously the timescales for conquering the sun or the galaxy. But the very absurdity of the exercise serves to emphasize

11: Math becomes easier if you blur your vision a bit and do not demand lots of pre- cision. In this case, we essentially ignore everything but the exponent, recognizing that each century will increment it by 1, at our chosen 2.3% rate. 
12: In this case, the "real" answer would be 1,335 years, but why fret over the details for little gain or qualitative difference in the outcome?

By coincidence, the visible universe has about as many galaxies as our galaxy has stars. By "visible" universe, we mean every- thing within 13.8 billion light years, which is as far as light has been able to travel since the Big Bang (see Sec. D.1; p. 392).

the impossibility of our continuing exponential growth in energy. All kinds of reasons will preclude continued energy growth, including the fact that human population cannot continue indefinite growth on this planet. We will address space colonization fantasies in Chapter 4.

1.3 Thermodynamic Consequences 
Physics places another relevant constraint on growth rate, and that concerns waste heat. Essentially all of our energy expenditures end up as heat. Obviously many of our activities directly involve the production of heat: ovens, stoves, toasters, heaters, clothes dryers, etc. But even cooling devices are net heat generators. Anything that uses power from an electrical outlet ends up creating net heat in the environment, with very few exceptions. A car moving down the road gets you from place A to place B, but has stirred the air,13 heated the engine and surrounding air, and deposited heat into the brake pads and rotors, tires and road. Our metabolic energy mostly goes to maintaining body temperature. But even our own physical activity tends to end up as heat in the environment. The only exceptions would be beaming energy out of the earth environment (e.g., light or radio) or putting energy into storage (eventually to be converted to heat). But such exceptions do not amount to much, quantitatively. 
What happens to all of this waste heat? If it all stayed on Earth, the temperature would climb and climb. But the heat does have an escape path: infrared radiation14 to space. The earth is in an approximate thermodynamic equilibrium: solar energy is deposited, and infrared radiation balances the input to result in steady net energy. As we will see in Chapter 5, the rate at which energy flows is called power, so that we can describe energy flows into and out of the earth system in terms of power. Physics has a well-defined and simple rule for how much power a body radiates, called the Stefan-Boltzmann law: 
P = Asurf (Thot-Told). 
16 
.15 
(1.8) 
P is the power radiated, Asurf is the surface area, Thot is the temperature of the radiating object in Kelvin (very important!), Tcold is the temperature of the environment (also Kelvin), and σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant: σ = 5.67 x 10-8 W/m2/K4.17 Note that the law operates on the difference of the fourth powers of two temperatures. 
Example 1.3.1 A table in a room in which the table and walls are all at the same temperature does not experience net radiation flow since the two temperatures to the fourth power subtract out. In this case, as much radiation leaves the table for the walls as arrives from the walls to the table. But a room-temperature object at 300 K radiates approximately 450 W per square meter to the coldness of space. 
Some time, go feel the exhaust air from an air-conditioning unit, or the heat produced at the back and bottom of a refrigerator. Even though these devices perform a cool- ing function, they make more heat than cool. 
13: Stirred-up air eventually grinds to a halt due to viscosity/friction, becoming heat.

16: Conversions to Kelvin from Celsius (or Fahrenheit) go like: 
T(K) = T(C) + 273.15; T(C) = (T(F) - 32)/1.8 
17: It's actually an easy constant to remem- ber: 5-6-7-8 (but must remember the minus sign on the exponent).

Murphy, Jr.; Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International Lic.; Freely available at: https://escholarship.org/uc/energy_ambitions.Because space is so cold (tens of Kelvin, effectively, unless exposed to the sun), the fourth power of such a small number pales so much in comparison to the fourth power of a number like 300 that we can safely ignore it for radiation to space: 
Pspace≈ AsurfOT4, 
(1.9) 
where we now just have a single temperature: that of the warm body in 
space. 
Earth reaches an equilibrium so that power-in equals power-out.18 If more power is dumped onto the planet, then the temperature rises until σT4 climbs to match. The relation in Eq. 1.9 is fundamentally important to Earth's temperature balance, and applies pretty universally, as highlighted in Box 1.4. 
Box 1.4: Everything Radiates 
The same relation (Eq. 1.8) governs the surface of the sun, light bulb filaments, glowing coals, and even the human body. While the human body expends metabolic energy at a similar rate to an incandescent light bulb (about 100 W), one is much hotter than the other because the surface areas are vastly different.

Sun's view 
To evaluate the expected temperature of the earth, we know that the sun delivers 1,360 W/m2 to the top of the earth's atmosphere [4] (a bit less reaches the ground). We also know that about 29.3% of this is reflected by clouds, snow, and to a lesser extent water and terrain. So the earth system absorbs about 960 W/m2. It absorbs this energy onto the area facing the sun: a projected disk of area Аproj= R. But the total surface area of the earth is four times this, all of it participating in the radiation to space (Figure 1.4). Equating the input and output for equilibrium conditions: 
Pin = 0.707 x 1360 W/m2 x R2 = Рout = 47RσT4, 
Figure 1.4: Earth-shown here in northern hemisphere summer intercepts sunlight across the projected area of the Earth's disk (R2), while radiating from the entire sur- face area, which is four times larger (4лR2). 
This 1,360 W/m2, known as the solar con- stant, is the incident energy rate (power), or the flux, of sunlight incident on Earth. 
(1.10) 
The 0.707 factor represents absorbed frac- tion after 29.3% is reflected.

Solving for T yields T≈ 255 K, or -18°C (about 0°F). This is cold-too cold. We observe the average temperature of Earth to be about 288 K, or 15°C (59°F). The difference of 33°C is due to greenhouse gases-mostly H2O-impacting the thermal balance by preventing most radiation from escaping directly to space. We'll cover this more extensively in Chapter 
9. 
Armed with Eq. 1.11, we can now estimate the impact of waste heat on Earth's equilibrium temperature. Using the solar input as a baseline, we can add increasing input using the exponential scheme from the previous section: starting today at 18 TW and increasing at 2.3% per year (a factor of 10 each century). It is useful to express the human input in the same terms as the solar input so that we can just add to the numerator in Eq. 1.11. In this context, our current 18 TW into the projected area лR2 adds 0.14 W/m2 to the solar input (a trivial amount, today), but then increases by a factor of ten each century. Taking this in one-century chunks, the resulting temperatures-adding in the 33 K from greenhouse gases-follow the evolution shown in Table 1.4. At first, the effect is unimportant, but in 300 years far outstrips global warming, and reaches boiling temperature in a little over 400 years! If we kept going (not possible), Earth's temperature would exceed the surface temperature of the sun inside of 1,000 years! 
A potential inconsistency in our treatment is that we based our exploration of energy scale on solar energy as a prelude to stellar energy capture. But in the thermodynamic treatment, we implicitly added our power source to the existing solar input. If the sun is the source, we should not double-count its contribution. Nonetheless, continued, re- lentless growth would eventually demand a departure from solar capture on Earth and drive the same thermodynamic challenges regardless. Synthesizing the messages: we can't continue 2.3% growth for more than a few centuries using sunlight on Earth. And if we invent something new and different to replace the fully-tapped solar potential, it too will reach thermodynamic limits within a few centuries.

Table 1.4: At a constant energy growth rate of 2.3% per year, the temperature climb from waste heat (not CO2 emissions) is slow at first, but becomes preposterous within a few-hundred years. Water boils in just over 400 years, and by 900 years Earth is hotter than the sun! The scenario of continued growth is obviously absurd. 
Connecting some ideas, we found in the previous section that we would be consuming the sun's entire output in 1,400 years at the 2.3% growth rate. It stands to reason that if we used a sun's worth of energy confined to the surface of the earth, the (smaller) surface would necessarily be hotter than the sun (in 1,400 years), just like a light bulb filament is hotter than human skin despite putting out the same power owing to the difference in area.19 
One key aspect of this thermal radiation scenario is that it does not depend on the form of power source. It could in principle be fossil fuels, nuclear fission, nuclear fusion, or some form of energy we have not yet realized and may not even have named! Whatever it is, it will have to obey thermodynamics. Thus, thermodynamics puts a time limit on energy growth on this planet.

1.4 Upshot: Physics Limits Physical Growth 
We saw in this chapter that unabated growth leads to absurd results. First, we calibrated our intuition in the context of bacteria in jars. The key point is that the jar is half full one doubling time before it is full. While this seems obvious, it delays the drama to the very end, acting fast to impose hard limits and catch the inhabitants by surprise. The conditions that persisted for many generations—thus taken for granted-suddenly change completely. 
Next, we found that continuing a modest growth rate in energy becomes hopelessly absurd in a matter of centuries. Then we saw another side to this coin, in the context of thermal consequences on the surface of the earth if energy growth continues. 
In the end, physics puts a timeline on expectations with respect to growth in energy on Earth. Maybe the ~300 year scale is not alarming enough. But it imposes a hard barrier against preserving our historical growth rate. In reality, other practicalities are likely to assert themselves before these hard limits are reached. We can therefore expect our growth phase to end well within a few hundred years. Given that the growth phase has lasted for far longer than that, we can say that we are closer to the end of the saga than to the beginning, yet the world is not collectively preparing for such a new reality. This seems unwise, and we will evaluate related concerns in subsequent chapters. 
Many factors will intercede to limit growth in both population and resource use: resource scarcity, pollution, aquifer depletion and water availability, climate change, warfare, fisheries collapse, a limited amount of arable land (declining due to desertification), deforestation, disease, to name a few. The point is only reinforced. By some means or another, we should view the present period of physical growth as a temporary phase: a brief episode in the longer human saga. 
1.5 Problems 
Hint: for problems that require solving temperature when it appears as T1, you'll need to take the fourth root, which is the same as raising to thepower. So use the y* button (or equivalent) and raise to the 0.25 power. You can check this technique by comparing the square root of a number to the result of raising that number to the 0.5 power. Another technique for the fourth root is to take the square root twice in a row. 
1. Verify the claim in the text that the town of 100 residents in 1900 reaches approximately 100,000 in the year 2000 if the doubling time is 10 years. 
2. Fill out Table 1.1 for the missing decades between 1940 and 2000.

Was the exercise pointless, since the math leads to absurdity? Is the math wrong? No- it's immensely valuable to learn that our assumption of continued growth (and ap- plication of the corresponding correct math) fails to make sense, ultimately. The logical conclusion is that growth cannot continue indefinitely. 
Note that a deviation from the assumed steady 2.3% growth rate changes all the numbers, and therein may lie the solution: ramp down growth! 
A number of these issues will be addressed in subsequent chapters.

3. Our example town from the text (page 3) starting at 100 people in the year 1900 and doubling every 10 years was said to take about 260 years (26 doubling times) to reach world population. Verify that the population indeed would approach 7 billion in 260 years (when the year would be 2160), by any means you wish.20 
4. Use Eq. 1.5 with b = 2 to figure out exactly how many years-via a computation of doubling times, which may not be an integer-our example town from the text (page 3) would take to reach 7 billion people. 
5. If our example town from page 3, doubling every 10 years, reaches a population of 7 billion in 260 years, how many years before it reaches 14 billion? 
6. In a classic story, a king is asked to offer a payment as follows: place one grain of rice on one square of a chess board (64 squares), then two on the next square, four on the next, 8 on the next, and double the previous on each subsequent square. The king agrees, not comprehending exponential growth. But the final number (adding all the grains) is one less than 264. How many grains is 
this? 
7. In the bacteria example of Section 1.1, how many "doubling times" are present in the 24 hour experiment (how many times did the population double)? 
8. A one-liter jar would hold about 1016 bacteria. Based on the number of doubling times in our 24-hour experiment, show by calculation that our setup was woefully unrealistic: that even if we started with a single bacterium, we would have far more than 1016 bacteria. after 24 hours if doubling every 10 minutes. 
9. If a one-liter jar holds 1016 bacteria, how many bacteria would we start in the jar so that the jar reaches full capacity after 24 hours if we increase the doubling time to a more modest/realistic 30 minutes? 
10. A more dramatic, if entirely unrealistic, version of the bacteria-jar story is having the population double every minute. Again, we start the jar with the right amount of bacteria so that the jar will be full 24 hours later, at midnight. At what time is the jar half full now? 
11. In the more dramatic bacteria-jar scenario in which doubling happens every minute and reaches single-jar capacity at midnight, at what time will the colony have to cease expansion if an explorer finds three more equivalent jars in which they are allowed to expand without interruption/delay? 
12. What is the doubling time associated with 3.5% annual growth? 
1 Exponential Growth 14 
20: E.g., brute force doubling 26 times or using math to get straight at the answer. 
Hint: In is the natural log function found on scientific calculators (sometimes as LN). 
Hint: M is the ratio of the final population to the initial population. 
To get 2,000 kcal of metabolic content per day, a person would need to eat 30,000 grains of rice each day. The amount of rice computed for this problem would feed the current world population for 240 years, which you are encouraged to check for your- self! 
Roughly 10 bacteria fit within a cubic micron (tiny), so you would not be able to see this tiny starting amount.

13. Using Eq. 1.5 and showing work, what annual growth rate, in per- cent, leads to the mathematically convenient factor-of-ten growth every century? 
14. Use Eq. 1.5 with b = 1+ p to figure out how long it takes to increase our energy by a factor of 10 if the growth rate is closer to the historical value of 2.9% (p = 0.029). Using 2.3% as we did in the examples (starting on page 7) puts this at 100 years.21 
15. Extrapolating a constant growth rate in energy is motivated by historical performance. During this period, population was also growing, albeit not as fast. If population were to double every 50 years, 22 how many people would Earth host when we hit the energy/thermodynamic limits in roughly 300 years? 
16. In extrapolating a 2.3% growth rate in energy, we came to the absurd conclusion that we consume all the light from all the stars in the Milky Way galaxy within 2,500 years. How much longer would it take to energetically conquer 100 more "nearby" galaxies, assuming they are identical to our own? 
17. In the spirit of outlandish extrapolations, if we carry forward a 2.3% growth rate (10x per century), how long would it take to go from our current 18 TW (18 x 1012 W) consumption to annihilating an entire earth-mass planet every year, converting its mass into pure energy using E = mc2? Things to know: Earth's mass is 6 x 1024 kg; c = 3 x 108 m/s; the result is in Joules, and one Watt is one Joule per second. 
18. Taking cues from the discussion of waste heat channels on page 10, describe some of the ways that all your energy output turns to heat when you go on a bicycle ride. 
19. Your skin temperature is about 308 K, and the walls in a typical room are about 295 K. If you have about 1 m2 of outward-facing surface area, how much power do you radiate as infrared radiation, in Watts? Compare this to the typical metabolic rate of 100 W. 
20. The moon absorbs 90% of the solar energy incident on it.23 How hot would you expect the surface to get under full sun? You don't need the factor of four here24 because the moon rotates very slowly under the sun and we're considering a patch experiencing overhead sunlight (rather than averaging over the sphere). Compare the result to boiling water temperature. 
21. Venus is, ironically, colder than Earth as an infrared radiator. This is because Venus is covered in bright clouds, absorbing only 25% of the incident solar flux. Sunlight is more intense there due to it's being closer to the sun: it's almost double, at 2,620 W/m2. Adapting Eq. 1.11, calculate the equilibrium temperature of Venus in the infrared and compare it to the Earth value of 255 K. 
1 Exponential Growth 15 
Hint: the exponential, ex, "undoes" the nat- ural logarithm. 
21: Hint: a good way to check your math. Note that if we were to use 2.9% instead of 2.3%, all of the time estimates in Section 1.2 are reduced by the ratio of this question's answer to 100 years. 
22: This corresponds to a 1.4% growth rate, but you don't need to use this number in your calculation. 
We are unlikely to reach such a number for a host of other reasons. 
Ignoring the fact that it impossible to get to them fast enough, even at light speed. 
Hint: Dividing the number of Joules asso- ciated with Earth's mass by the number of seconds in a year gives the number of Watts being consumed. You may wish to compare the result to the timescale before we would use the power output of all stars in the Milky Way galaxy? 
Air convection also takes some heat away, but then clothing reduces both to bring us to equilibrium/comfort.

22. Adapt Eq. 1.11 to Mars to find its equilibrium temperature. The solar flux averages 590 W/m2 there, and it absorbs 75% of incident sunlight. Express the answer in both Kelvin and Celsius, and put in context. 
23. If a human body having an outward surface area of 1 m2 continued to put out 100 W of metabolic power in the form of infrared radiation in the cold of space (naked; no sun), what would the equilibrium temperature be? Would this be comfortable (put in context)? 
24. Verify the total solar power output of 4 x 1026 W based on its surface temperature of 5,800 K and radius of 7 x 108 m, using Eq. 
1.9. 
25. Verify that Earth would reach a temperature far in excess of boiling point of water25 after 500 years if today's power output (18 TW) increased by a factor of 10 each century.

Chapter 1 demonstrated that the laws of physics and mathematical logic render a constant few-percent growth trajectory to be absurd and untenable even a few hundred years into the future. In this chapter, we develop implications for the less physics-bound concept of economic growth, which is a cornerstone of modern society. Investment, loans, retirement and social security schemes all assume the march of growth. The conclusion of this chapter is that economic growth will not be able to continue at any significant rate in the absence of physical growth-which we have seen cannot continue indefinitely. The suggestion usually evokes quick criticism from economists, but they can be talked down, with patience.1 This is how it goes. 
2.1 Historical Coupling 
In subsistence times, esthetics held little value compared to physical goods: you couldn't eat a sculpture, for instance-nor would it help keep you warm.2 Food, tools, resources like wood, pack or draft animals carried primary value. When basic subsistence requirements were met, gold or jewelry may have warranted some expenditure-but even these were physical resources. 
Agriculture freed some individuals in society to think and create. The economy found more room to value arts and performance: things that fueled the mind, if not the body. During the Renaissance, patrons would support artists and scientists whose output had few other channels of economic support. In today's world, a complex economy distributes financial assets to a wide variety of practitioners in general accordance with society's values.

But resources are still paramount. The United States prospered largely because it possessed a frontier rich in natural resources. Mining and animal pelts dominated early on, as well as agriculture (tobacco, cotton, corn, wheat). In the middle of the 20th century, the United States was the dominant oil exporter worldwide (first developed in Pennsylvania, then California and Texas). Escaping the World Wars largely unscathed in terms of domestic infrastructure, the country had tooled-up a massive manufacturing capability. Together with a can-do attitude, Americans set out to rack up superlatives in virtually every category. As a manu- facturing powerhouse during the middle of the 20th century, American raw materials joined a well-educated workforce to drive innovation and production. It is no accident that many in the U.S. yearn to return to these "glory days;" however we cannot possibly do so, having permanently depleted some of the original stocks. 
What was true in the past is largely still true today: resources like oil, steel, metals, agricultural products, and heavy machinery continue to fetch a significant price on the market. Resources fuel prosperity. It is not the only source, but remains a reliable and bedrock component. Figure 2.1 shows the tight correlation between economic scale and energy use, which is often expressed by saying that the two tend to be coupled. 
One might say that the U.S. was the Saudi Arabia of the day. 
It is important to recognize that the past was not "glorious" for all people.

One way to capture the physical connection to economic activity is to represent the energy expenditure associated with each dollar3 spent. This economic energy intensity (see Definition 2.1.1) of a country is just the energy expenditure of society divided by the gross domestic product (GDP).4 
Figure 2.1: Per capita energy use as a func- tion of GDP on a logarithmic scale. Per capita GDP is the sum total of a country's economy divided by population, effectively indicating average annual income. The rate at which an individual uses energy is ex- pressed as a power, in Watts. A strong cor- relation exists here across many orders-of- magnitude: rich countries use more energy, per person [6–8]. A few instructive cases (red dots) are labeled. The dot areas are scaled to population.

Definition 2.1.1 Energy intensity is a measure of how much energy a society uses relative to its economic scale-sort of like an efficiency. It can be a proxy for resource use in general, and is calculated as: 
2 Economic Growth Limits 
19 
Energy Intensity = 
Energy Expended Money Spent 
(2.1) 
In a resource-constrained world (limited material and energy supplies), a lower energy intensity translates to less energy consumption for a certain economic output, or conversely allows higher economic output for a fixed energy consumption rate. On a smaller scale, we can say, for instance, that spending $100 on an airplane trip is far more energy intense than spending the same amount of money on legal advice. 
Energy intensity therefore provides a measure of how resource-heavy a country is in relation to the size of its economy. For instance, the U.S. uses about 1020 Joules of energy per year and has a GDP of approximately 20 trillion dollars. Dividing these gives an intensity of 5 × 106 J/$, or 5 MJ/$ (many variants are possible in terms of units). The world as a whole uses about 4.5 x 1020 J in a year at an estimated $90 trillion gross world product, also resulting in 5 MJ/$. The variation among developed countries is not especially large-generally in the single-digit MJ/$ range. 
We will cover units of energy in Chapter 5. For now, it is sufficient to know that a Joule (J) is a unit of energy, and that MJ means megajoules, or 106 J.

Figure 2.2 illustrates the range of intensities for all the countries in the world. Among the factors driving energy use are geographical extent (large countries require more long-haul transportation), climate (cold countries require more heating), efficiency, and lifestyle. Russia, Canada, and the U.S. have large territories, and the former two require more heating than most. By contrast, Switzerland is geographically small

and outsources much of its heavy industry. Somebody should probably check on what's happening in Venezuela.5 
2.2 Decoupling and Substitution 
As economies expand beyond subsistence level, a larger fraction of the total activity can go to "frivolous" elements, such as art and entertain- ment. The intensity of such activities can be quite low. An art collector may pay $1 million for a coveted painting. Very little energy is required. The painting was produced long ago. It may even remain on display in the same location-only the name of the owner changing. Finan- cial transactions that require no manufacture, transport, and negligible energy are said to be "decoupled" from physical resources. Plenty of examples exist in society, and are held up by economists as illustrating how we can continue to expand the economy without a commensurate expansion of resource needs." 
Definition 2.2.1 Decoupling is the notion that economic activities need not be strongly tied to physical (e.g., energy) requirements, so that energy intensity might become arbitrarily small. The degree to which some economic activity is decoupled forms a continuous scale, where intense utilization of energy and physical resources (e.g., steel production) are on one end and fine art dealing on the other? The only way for an economy to maintain growth in the event that physical sector growth becomes limited is to increase the degree of decoupling in the society. 
The dream is that as development progresses, economic energy intensity may decline (greater decoupling) so that more money is made per unit of energy expended. If the economy can decouple from energy needs, we are not constrained in our quest to continue economic growth, bringing smiles to the faces of investors and politicians. Such a transition would mean less emphasis on energy and resource-intensive industrial development/manufacturing, and more on abstract services, broadly 
speaking. 
Because the world is a sort of "experiment," representing many countries having adopted many policies and in various states of development, Figure 2.2 can be viewed as a potential roadmap to decoupling. 
The question is: as countries develop and become more prosperous, does intensity decrease, as we would want it to do as a signal of decoupling? On the large scale, any effect is modest. Going from India to the U.S. affords only a factor-of-two improvement in intensity, while spanning most of the horizontal extent in personal prosperity (a factor of 30 in per capita GDP). That's pretty weak tea. 
At the upper end of personal income (right side of Figure 2.2), we might detect a downward slope. But we must be careful about cherry-picking in 
5: Maybe they left the oven on by mistake? 
6: This is the hope, anyway. 
7: Services, like plumbing, journalism, or marketing fall in between, using some phys- ical resources, but not as much as heavy industry. 
8: Such services might include things like singing lessons, life coaching, psychother- apy, financial planning, and other activities that demand little physical input. 
Part of the reason prosperous countries demonstrate a lower intensity is that man- ufacturing moves overseas. Driving the whole world toward lower intensity is a more difficult prospect, as the physical pro- cesses must still happen somewhere.

the face of non-replicable circumstances. Not every country can assume the geography and financially-focused nature of Switzerland. And at the same time, if the U.S. imagines itself providing a model that other countries might emulate, the intensity of many European countries could actually increase if adopting U.S. habits. But more broadly, we don't have evidence that a country on the prosperous end of the distribution can operate at even a factor-of-four lower intensity than the 4 MJ/$ level typical of developed countries. In the present context of assessing the future of growth, in which we are concerned with order-of-magnitude scales and limits (as in Chapter 1), it does not appear that decoupling has very much to offer.1

Definition 2.2.2 Substitution refers to the ability to switch resources when one becomes scarce or a better/superior alternative is found. Substitution is often invoked to counter concerns about scarcity. A common and cute way to frame it is that the stone age did not end because we ran out of stones-—we found bronze. 
The past is full of examples of substitution (Definition 2.2.2). Consider the progression in lighting technology from open fires to beeswax candles to whale oil lanterns to piped gas lanterns to incandescent electric bulbs to fluorescent lights to LED (light emitting diode) technology. Every step seems to be an improvement, and it is very natural to assume the story will continue developing along these lines. 
Box 2.1: A Story of Lighting Efficiency 
One way to quantify lighting progress is in the luminous efficacy of light, in units of lumens per Watt. In the 20th century, incandescent bulbs were so ubiquitous for so long that we fell into the bad habit of characterizing brightness in terms of the electrical power consumed by the bulb, in Watts. Thus we have generations of people accustomed to how bright a "100 W" or "60 W" bulb is. As technology changes, we should migrate to "lumens," which accurately captures how bright a source is perceived by the human eye. 
Table 2.1 and Figure 2.3 present the evolution of luminous efficacy as sources improved. Can this trend continue indefinitely? No. Every photon of light carries a minimum energy11 requirement based on its wavelength. For photons spread across the visible spectrum (creating light we perceive as white), the theoretical limit is about 300 lm/W [9]. At this extreme, no energy is wasted in the production of light, putting 100% of the energy into the light itself. Engineering rarely reaches theoretical limits, due to a host of practical challenges. It would therefore not be surprising if lighting efficiency does not improve over where it is today by another factor of two, ending yet another centuries-long trend. 
10: That is, no orders-of-magnitude that will allow us to continue growth for cen- turies more after physical resources limit growth. 
Through this example, we can see how substitution and decoupling might be con- nected: efficiency improves through substi- tution, requiring less energy for the same lighting value. 
Bulb packaging still refers to the "equivalent wattage" of a bulb, even though a "60 W equivalent" bulb may only consume 12 W of power. 
11: We will see this in Sec. 5.10 (p.79).

The historical progress can fool us into thinking that we can expect a continued march to better substitutes. Having witnessed a half-dozen rabbits come out of the hat12 in the example of lighting technology (Box 2.1), we are conditioned to believe more are forthcoming. It will be true until it isn't any more (e.g., see Figure 2.3) One way to put it is that 6 rabbits does not imply an infinite number. We should welcome each new rabbit, but not hinge our future on a continual stream of new rabbits. 
For financially secure individuals at the top end of the wealth distribution, it is easier to buy into the allure of substitution as a way forward. Many have achieved wealth from humble beginnings, and have therefore lived a life of continual upgrades in terms of housing, transportation, clothing, food, travel, etc. Even those who have been surrounded by wealth their whole lives have been in a position to afford new upgrades as they become available. Yet, it is not always possible to export the capabilities of those at the top to a significant sector of the population. Not everything can scale. 
Box 2.2: The Fate of the Concorde 
The fate of the Concorde which offered supersonic transatlantic passenger service between 1976-2003-may offer a useful lesson here: just because it is possible to construct a supersonic passenger airplane does not mean that enough people can afford it to result in an economically viable reduction in trans-oceanic travel time for all. Consumers no longer have the option for supersonic flight, even though 50 years ago it was assumed that this was the future. Sometimes we go backwards, when our dreams don't line up to practical reality. 
More generally, sometimes the best possible solution and "peak" technol- ogy arrives at some early point in history. As much as we mess around with elements on the Periodic Table, we are never going to beat H2O 
12: ... magician reference 
We will return to this theme in the context of fossil fuels, which might be termed the mother of all rabbits, in this context. Having pulled such a stupendous rabbit out of the hat once, many assume we're set from now on. In this case, equating one to infinity is even more dubious. 
An electric car having hundreds of kilome- ters of range seems like an obvious path forward beyond fossil fuels. But at a price tag above $40,000, it does not look like much of a solution to most people, and we can't be sure prices will fall steeply.

as a vital substance.13 Marketers might sell H2O2 as superior, having one more beneficial oxygen atom, but please don't drink hydrogen peroxide! Some technologies in use today would be recognized by pre-industrial people: wheels, string, bowls, glass, clothing. We won't always find better things, though we may make a series of incremental improvements over time. Not everything will experience game-changing developments. 
In summary, decoupling and substitution are touted as mechanisms by which economic growth need not slow down as energy and other resources become constrained. We can make money using less of the resource (decoupling) or just find alternatives that are not constrained (substitution), the thinking goes. And yes, this is backed up by loads of examples where such things have happened. It would be foolish to claim that we have reached the end of the line and can expect no more gains from decoupling or substitution. But it would be equally foolish to imagine that they can produce dividends eternally so that economic growth is a permanent condition. 
Box 2.3: Efficiency Limits 
Efficiency improvements would seem to offer a way to tolerate a stagnation or decline in available energy resources. Getting more from less is very appealing. Yes, efficiency improvements are good and should be pursued. But they are no answer to growth limits, for the following reasons. 
1. For the most part, realized efficiencies are already within a 
factor-of-two of theoretical limits.14 A motor or generator oper- ating at 90% efficiency has little room to improve. If efficiencies were typically far smaller than 1%, it would be reasonable to seek improvements as a "resource" for some time to come, but that is not the lay of the land. 
16 
2. Efficiency improvements in energy use tend to creep along at ~1% per year,15 or sometimes 2%. Doubling times are therefore measured in decades, which combined with the previous point suggests an end to this train ride within the century. 3. Efficiency improvements can backfire, in a process called the Jevons paradox or the rebound effect. Increased demand for the more efficient technology results in greater demand for the underlying resource. For example, improvements in refrigerator efficiency resulted in larger refrigerators and more of them," for a net increase in energy devoted to refrigeration. Consider that per-capita global energy and material resource use has climbed inexorably amidst a backdrop of substantial efficiency improvements over the last century [12]. 
17 
Efficiency improvements are not capable of resolving resource de- mand. 
13: Relatedly, consider that the Periodic Ta- ble is finite and fits easily on a single sheet of paper (Fig. B.1; p. 375). We don't have an unlimited set of substitute elements/com- pounds available. Astrophysical measure- ments validate that the whole universe is 
limited to the same set of elements.

2.3 Physically Forced Economic Limits 
Let us now consider a thought experiment. We will use Figure 2.4 as a guide as we go along. Colored numbers in the following text point to similarly-colored labels in the figure. We start by positing a constant growth rate for the entire economy (point 1; red curve in Figure 2.4) following the familiar 2.3% annual growth rate, picked for its convenient factor of 10 each century. Meanwhile, the scale of physical resources (energy, materials) in the economy also climbs at the same rate, starting at point 2. The vertical gap between the curves at the left-hand edge conveys that the economy is not 100% physical in the beginning: the total economy is larger than the physical piece.18

Fast-forward to a time when physical resources have stopped growing, starting at point 3. Chapter 1-using energy and thermodynamics as the basis-made the case that we cannot expect physical growth to continue indefinitely, ending on a few-century timescale at the longest.19 In this scenario, the scale of energy in our society flat-lines at a steady scale (point 4). 
If we demand continued economic growth in the context of fixed energy, decoupling becomes increasingly necessary, shown as a growing gap in Figure 2.4. In other words, if the gross domestic product (GDP; as an indicator of economic activity) is to continue rising20 (point 5), then overall intensity (energy per dollar) must continually decrease. For this to happen, less-energetic activities must assume increasing importance in the economy. So far, economists are on board: this is precisely what inspires an affinity for decoupling-a way forward in the face of physical limits. One might expect more abstract services, virtual experiences, art dealing, enhanced presentation: all requiring little or no additional

Figure 2.4: Model evolution of the economy after physical resources saturate. The blue curve is the scale of the physical economy (leveling out, or saturating). The solid red curve is the total economic scale, which we force to adhere to a constant growth rate (10x per century, or 2.3% annual rate). The magenta curve is the percentage of the economy in non-physical sectors, and the red dashed curve is a more realistic reaction of the economy to a saturating physical sector. Colored arrows point to the scale that each curve should use -logarithmic on the left for economic scales and linear on the right for the percentage curve. This model is constructed simply to illustrate the overall behavior: time scales and other quantitative details should not be taken literally. 
19: It is assumed here (optimistically) that we have managed to find a renewable alter- native that can satisfy a constant demand effectively indefinitely. If not, the story is even worse and we are forced to ramp down the scale of the physical sector, which would force the blue curve in Figure 2.4 to descend in later years.

25 
energy expenditure, or perhaps even less than before. In this way, the economic scale could keep rising while physical resources are held flat. 
If the economy is to continue to expand on the basis of decoupled activities, a greater fraction of it must go toward these non-physical sectors. This means more monetary flow is associated with low-impact activities. In practical terms, then, a greater fraction of one's income is directed toward experiences not tied to energy or other physical demands. In Figure 2.4, we see, at point 6, the percentage of the economy in the non-physical sector starting at 25%: not dominant, but not negligible. The magenta curve must rise as the red and blue lines separate, until at point 7 it approaches 100% non-physical and continues to drive arbitrarily close to 100%. 
During this process, the obvious converse consequence is that the energetically or physically costly activities like transportation, food, heating, cooking, manufactured items-become an ever-smaller fraction. of the economy, or an ever smaller fraction of monthly expenses, to put it more personally. In other words, they become cheap. 
Now, in our imagined scenario of continued economic growth, the ruthlessness of the exponential grabs the reins and drives the gulf ever wider, so that physical goods become arbitrarily cheap and demand an ever-smaller fraction of income. By the time we reach the right side of Figure 2.4, the economic scale is over 1,000 times as large as the physical scale, meaning that the physical component is less than 0.1% of the total economy. Table 2.2 illustrates the progression under the foregoing growth rate of 2.3%. If in the year 2000, 50% of one's income (and thus about half of one's work hours) goes toward physically intense products, this becomes ever smaller until by the end of the table it only takes 6 minutes of your annual work to earn enough for the physically intense goods: all your food, clothing, transportation, heating, cooking, manufactured goods. 
If this is starting to feel like unrealistic fantasy, then good: your intuition is serving you well. How can essential, non-negotiable, life-sustaining commodities that are in finite supply become essentially free? The idea goes against another, more fundamental economic principle of supply and demand. A limited life-essential resource will always carry a moderately high value. Limited supply and inflexible demand dictate a floor to the price. 
This, we will argue, is unrealistic. 
Again, seems unrealistic. 
Clearly absurd result.

Box 2.4: Monopoly Made Easy 
One way to highlight the absurdity of the scenario is that if the physically-limited but essential (life sustaining) resources became arbitrarily cheap in the fullness of time, a single person could buy them all for a pittance, and then charge a hefty price for anyone

who wants to keep living. We simply will not find ourselves in the situation where precious and limited resources become arbitrarily cheap. Alternatively, if people only needed to work an hour per year to accommodate basic needs, expect a lot less work to be done, acting as a drag on economic productivity and thus preventing inexorable growth-one way or another. 
Once the price floor is reached, the cost of physical resources will not be able to fall any further. This happens pretty soon after physical resources cease to grow in scale. Indeed, it seems unlikely (to the author) that limited resources essential for survival would fall much below 10% of the total economic scale, which happens within a century of physical saturation in our 2.3% growth scenario. Point 8 in Figure 2.4 depicts a more realistic trajectory for the economy (red dashed line) in reaction to a saturated physical scale. In this case, the economy keeps growing a bit more than the physical sector, but eventually settles down itself into a non-growth phase. 
We therefore have a logical sequence providing a few-century timescale for an end to economic growth. Thermodynamics limits us to at most a few centuries of energy growth on Earth, and economic growth will cease within a century or so thereafter, assuming a target rate of a few percent per year. In practice, growth may come to an end well before theoretical extremes are reached. 
What seems like a reasonable lower limit to you? How economically insignificant can essentials be and 
still make sense? 
2.4 No-Growth World 
The foregoing arguments spell out why economic growth cannot be expected to continue indefinitely-contrary to prevalent assumptions. When a mathematically-framed model delivers nonsense results-like the one we used to extrapolate energy use to absurd extremes-it does not mean the math itself is wrong, just that it has been misapplied or layered onto faulty assumptions. In this case, the breakdown indicates that the assumption of indefinite growth is untenable. 
The growth regime is woven deeply into our current global society. And why wouldn't it be? We've enjoyed its benefits for many generations. We celebrate the myriad advantages it has brought, and therefore align our political and economic institutions toward its robust preservation. Community planning, interest rates, investment, loans, the very role of banks, social safety net systems,21 and retirement plans all hinge on the assumption of growth.22 Shock waves of panic reverberate at signs of (even temporary) recession, given the importance of growth to our institutions. Yet the message here is that we cannot expect its unfaltering continuance implying that many things will have to change. 
21: In the U.S., Social Security and Medicare are examples. 
22: Growth in both workforce and invest- ments are essential ingredients of these schemes that pay out more than an indi- vidual's past contributions to the program.

Returning to the roots of economic theory, the earliest thinkers-Adam Smith, David Ricardo, Thomas Malthus, John Stuart Mill-had founda- tions in natural philosophy23 and saw growth as a temporary phase, ulti- mately limited by a prime physical resource: land. In that time, land held the key to outputs from farming, timber, mining, and game-thereby dic- tating economic development. What these pioneering economic thinkers did not foresee was the arrival of fossil fuels, and the technological developments that accompanied this energy explosion. 
24 
Now, we have fallen into something of a lulled complacency: having rescued ourselves so far from the end-of-growth predictions of the early economists, the temptation is to conclude that they were just wrong, and we have outsmarted natural limits. This is dangerous thinking. In the end, nature is indifferent to how smart we imagined ourselves to be. If we were truly clever, we would start thinking about a world that does not depend on growth, and how to live compatibly within planetary limits. Chapter 19 touches on this theme, after intervening chapters paint a more complete picture of energy constraints. 
2.5 Upshot: Economic Growth Will End 
It is worth re-iterating the recipe for an end to economic growth in summary form, as spelled out in Box 2.5. Make sure you can trace the logic and connections from one point to the next-not to be memorized as disconnected facts. 
Box 2.5: Economic Growth Limit 
1. Physical resources (energy in our example) ultimately stabilize 
to a fixed annual amount. 
2. Non-physical sectors of the economy must assume responsibil- 
ity for continued economic growth, if growth is to continue. 3. The economy comes to be dominated by non-physical sectors. 4. Physical sectors are relegated to an ever-smaller fraction of the economy, ultimately vanishing if exponential growth is to hold. 5. In this scenario,25 physical goods (energy among them) become arbitrarily cheap, requiring only one week's worth of earnings, then a day's worth, then an hour, a minute, a second. 
6. This situation is impossible and does not respect common- sense supply/demand notions: a finite, limited but absolutely vital resource will never become arbitrarily cheap in a market system. 
7. At some point, physical resources will "saturate" to a minimum fraction of the economy, at which point overall growth in non- physical sectors must also cease.

23: ... closer to modern-day physics than to modern-day economics, rooted in the natural world 
24: The classic example is Thomas Malthus, who warned of limits over 200 years ago based on finite resource limits before fossil fuels ripped the narrative apart. The lasting association is that "Malthus equals wrong," leading to the dangerous takeaway that all warnings in this vein are discredited and can be ignored. Note that the most consequential and overlooked lesson from the story about "the boy who cried wolf" is that a real wolf did appear. 
As was stated before, experts frequently read complex sections more than once to fully absorb the arguments; feel free to do so here.

Just because we can point to some completely legitimate examples of decoupled activities and many impressive substitution stories does not mean that an entire economy can be based on indefinite continu- ance of such things. We are physical beings in a physical world and have non-negotiable minimum requirements for life. The activities and commodities that support critical functions cannot continue to expand indefinitely, and will not become arbitrarily cheap once their expansion hits physical limits. The finite nature of our world guarantees that such limits will be asserted, committing economic growth to stall in turn. Nothing, in the end, escapes physics. 
So, while acknowledging that growth in the past has brought uncount- able benefits to the human endeavor, we have to ask ourselves: If the end of growth is inevitable, why does it remain our prevailing plan? 
2.6 Problems 
1. At a 3.5% growth (interest) rate, how much would $1,000 invested at the time Columbus sailed to America be worth today (hint: use the rule of 70)? Put this in context (compare to richest individuals or find a similar GDP for some country). 
2. As an indication of how sensitive the accumulation is to interest rate, compare the result from Problem 1 to what would happen for interest rates of 4% and 5%-again putting into context. 
3. Find the energy intensity for at least four countries spanning a range of development levels. For each country, look up the GDP, and find energy consumption at: Wikipedia page on Primary En- ergy Consumption. [13] In order to compare to Figure 2.2, multiply the number in quadrillion Btu (qBtu) by 1.055 × 1018 J/qBtu. Also note that a trillion is 1012. 
4. Estimate the energy intensity of the UCSD campus, based on an annual electricity expenditure around 1015 J.26 For the financial side, assume that student payments (tuition, fees, room and board) accounts for 40% of the total budget.27 Use your knowledge of typical tuition/fees and enrollment to come up with a number. Compare your result to global figures for energy intensity. 
5. Typical energy costs are in the neighborhood of $0.10 per kilowatt- hour (kWh), and 1 kWh is 3.6 MJ (megajoules). Take the ratio of these two figures to form an economic energy intensity of energy itself, in units of MJ/$. 
28 
6. If a country clocks in at 5 MJ/$ for its overall energy intensity, 
and its energy costs work out to an energy intensity of 30 MJ/$,2 what percentage of the economy do we infer constitutes the energy sector? 
Retention of Chapter 1 material is as- sumed. The real world is not partitioned into chapters, and neither should your brain be. 
Look at the column for total energy con- sumption in units of quadrillion Btu. 
26: Based on a 30 MW electrical load times the number of seconds in a year; this won't account for all energy expenditures, missing transportation, for instance. 
27: Federal grants comprise most of the rest, and a small amount from state taxes 
Don't get hung up on in-state fraction; just make a crude guess (maybe guess an aver- age) and clearly state assumptions. 
The result should be larger than the typical energy intensity for all economic activities within a country, since not all monetary expenditure goes toward energy.

7. Come up with some of your own examples (at least three; not listed in the text) of economic activities29 that have little resource footprint and are therefore fairly decoupled. These are transactions for which the intensity (energy or resource expenditure) is very low compared to the dollar amount. 
8. If a candle has a luminous efficacy of 0.3 lm/W and a modern LED light bulb achieves 100 lm/W, by what factor30 have we improved lighting efficiency? If the theoretical limit is around 300 lm/W, what factor do we still have to go? 
9. In going from 0.3 lm/W candle technology to the theoretical maximum luminous efficacy, we see a factor of 1,000 increase. Taking about 300 years to do this, we might recognize that we are following along our familiar factor-of-ten each century trajectory. Approximately how long31 might we expect it to take to achieve the final factor of three to go from our current technology to the theoretical limit, at this same rate? Is it within lifetime that 
your we hit the limit? 
10. Provide your own example of a sequence of substitutions com- prised of at least two qualitatively superior32 substitutions over time (thus three steps: original, first replacement, second replace- ment). 
11. List three substances or critical concepts we rely on that have no 
superior substitutes in the universe. 
12. Based on your present state of knowledge, detail what you think an optimist might say about the superiority of post-fossil energy substitutes? 
13. Based on your present state of knowledge, detail what you think a pessimist might say about the lack of superiority of post-fossil energy substitutes?

3 Population 
Underlying virtually every concern relating to our experience on this planet is the story of human population. The discussion of continued energy growth in Chapter 1 was based on the historical growth rate of energy, which is partly due to growing population and partly due to increased use per capita. But the notion that population will continue an exponential climb, as is implicit in the Chapter 1 scenario, is impractical- one of many factors that will render the "predictions" of Chapter 1 invalid and prohibit "growth forever." 
So let's add a dose of reality and examine a more practical scenario. Americans' per-capita use of energy is roughly five times the global average rate. If global population eventually doubles, and the average global citizen advances to use energy at the rate Americans currently do,1 then the total scale of energy use would go up by a factor of 10, which would take 100 years at our mathematically convenient 2.3% annual rate (see Eq. 1.5; p. 5). This puts a more realistic-and proximate— timescale on the end of energy growth than the fantastical extrapolations of Chapter 1. 
Although the focus of this chapter will be on the alarming rate of population growth, we should keep the energy and resource context in mind in light of the overall theme of this book. To this end, Figure 3.1 shows the degree to which energy demand has outpaced population growth, when scaled vertically to overlap in the nineteenth century. From 1900 to 1950, per-capita energy consumption increased modestly, but then ballooned dramatically after 1950, so that today we have the equivalent of 25 billion people on the planet operating at nineteenth century energy levels. 
Since population plays a giant role in our future trajectory, we need to better understand its past. We can also gain some sense for theoretical

3.1 Population History 
Figure 3.2 shows a history of global population for the last 12,000 years. Notice that for most of this time, the level is so far down as to be essentially invisible. It is natural to be alarmed by the sharp rise in recent times, which makes the current era seem wholly unusual: an aberration. But wait-maybe it's just a plain exponential function. All exponential functions ruthless as they are would show this alarming rise at some point, sometimes called a "hockey stick" plot. In order to peer deeper, we plot population on a logarithmic vertical axis (Figure 3.3). Now we bring the past into view, and can see whether a single exponential function (which would have a constant slope in a logarithmic plot) captures the story. 
Wait, what? It still looks somewhat like a hockey stick (even more literally so)! How can that be?! This can't be good news. Peering more closely, we can crudely break the history into two eras, each following exponential growth (straight lines on the plot), but at different rates. The early phase had a modest 0.044% growth rate. By the "rule of 70," the corresponding doubling time is about 1,600 years. In more recent times, a 1% rate is more characteristic (70 year doubling). Indeed, we would be justified in saying that recent centuries are anomalous compared to the first 10,000 years of the plot. If we extend the the 0.04% line and the 1% line, we find that they intersect around the year 1700, which helps identify the era of marked transition. 
The recent rapid rise is a fascinating development, and begs for a closer look. Figure 3.4 shows the last ~1,000 years, for which we see several exponential-looking segments at ever-increasing rates. The doubling times associated with the four rates shown on the plot are presented in Table 3.1. 
An interpretation of the population history might go as follows. Not much changed during the period following the Dark Ages.2 The Renaissance (~1700) introduced scientific thinking so that we began to conquer diseases, allowing an uptick in population growth. In the mid-19th century (~1870), the explosive expansion of fossil fuel usage permitted industrialization at a large scale, and mechanized farming practices. More people could be fed and supported, while our mastery over human health continued to improve. In the mid-20th century (~1950), the Green Revolution [17] introduced a fossil-fuel-heavy diet of fertilizer and large- scale mechanization of agriculture, turning food production into an industry. The combination of a qualitative change in the availability of cheap nutrition and the march of progress on disease control cranked the population rate even higher.

In more recent years, the rate has fallen somewhat from the 1.7% fit of the last segment in Figure 3.4, to around 1.1%. Rounding down for convenience, continuation at a 1% rate would increase population from 7 billion to 8 billion people in less than 14 years. The math is the same as in Chapter 1, re-expressed here as 
P = Poeln(1+p)(t-to) 
(3.1) 
where Po is the population at time to, and P is the population at time t if the growth rate is steady at p. Inverting this equation, we have

Example 3.1.1 We can use Eq. 3.1 to determine how many people we will have in the year 2100 if we continue growing at a 1% rate, starting from 7 billion in the year 2010. We set Po=7Gppl,4 to 2010, p = 0.01, then compute the population in 2100 to be P = 7eln 1.01.90 = 17 Gppl. 
Eq. 3.2 is the form that was used to conclude that increasing from 7 to 8 Gppl takes less than 14 years at a 1% rate. The computation looks like: In(8/7)/In 1.01 = 13.4. Note that we need not include the factors of a billion in the numerator and denominator, since they cancel in 
the ratio.

Table 3.2: Population milestones: dates at which we added another one billion liv- ing people to the planet. The Time and Doubling columns are expressed in years. Around 1965, the growth rate got up to 2%, for a 35 year doubling time. 
Table 3.2 and Figure 3.5 illustrate how long it has taken to add each billion people, extrapolating to the 8 billion mark (as of writing in 2020). The first billion people obviously took tens of thousands of years, each new billion people taking less time ever since. Growth rate peaked in the 1960s at 2% and a doubling time of 35 years. The exponential rate is moderating now, but even 1% growth continues to add a billion people every 13 years, at this stage. A famous book by Paul Ehrlich called The Population Bomb [18], first published in 1968, expressed understandable alarm at the 2% rate that had only increased to that point. The moderation to 1% since that period is reassuring, but we are not at all out of the woods yet. The next section addresses natural mechanisms for curbing growth.

3.2 Logistic Model 
Absent human influence, the population of a particular animal species. on the planet might fluctuate on short timescales (year by year) and experience large changes on very long timescales (centuries or longer). But by-and-large nature finds a rough equilibrium. Overpopulation proves to be temporary, as exhaustion of food resources, increased predation, and in some cases disease (another form of predation, really) knock back the population. On the other hand, a small population finds it easy to expand into abundant food opportunities, and predators reliant on the species have also scaled back due to lack of prey. 
We have just described a form of negative feedback: corrective action to remedy a maladjusted system back toward equilibrium. 
Definition 3.2.1 Negative feedback simply means that a correction is applied in a direction opposite the recent motion. If a pendulum moves to the right, a restoring force pushes it back to the left, while moving too far to the left results in a rightward push. A mass oscillating on a spring demonstrates similar characteristics, as must all equilibrium phenomena. 
We can make a simple model for how a population might evolve in an environment hosting negative feedback. When a population is small and resources are abundant, the birth rate is proportional to the population. 
Example 3.2.1 If a forest has 100 breeding-aged deer, or 50 couples, we can expect 50 fawns in a year (under the simplifying and unimportant assumption of one fawn per female per year). If the forest has 200 deer, we can expect 100 fawns. The birth rate is simply proportional to the population capable of giving birth." 
If the setup in Example 3.2.1 were the only element to the story, we would find exponential growth: more offspring means a larger popula- tion, which ultimately reaches breeding age to produce an even larger population. But as the population grows, negative feedback will begin to play a role. We will denote the population as P, and its rate of change as P.8 We might say that the growth rate, or P, is 
p = rP, 
(3.3) 
where r represents the birth rate in proportion to the population (e.g., 0.04 if 4% of the population will give birth in a year)." This equation just re-iterates the simple idea that the rate of population growth is dependent on (proportional to) the present population. The solution to this differential equation is an exponential: 
P = Poer(t-to), 
(3.4) 
5: For reference, the SARS-CoV2 pandemic of 2020 barely impacted global population growth rates. When population grows by more than 80 million each year, a disease killing even a few million people barely registers as a hit to the broader trend. 
The word negative may sound like some- thing we would not want, but its cousin- positive feedback-leads to disastrous run- away conditions. An example of positive feedback is the bacteria example from Chap- ter 1: having more bacteria only increases the rate of growth. Exponentials are the hallmark of positive feedback, while equi- librium signals negative feedback. 
6: 
...no negative feedback yet 
7: We have just described a state of positive feedback: more begets more. 
8: P is a time derivative (note the dot on top), defined as P = dP/dt. But don't panic if calculus is not your thing: what we de- scribe here is still totally understandable. 
9: In terms of the growth rate we used before, p, as in Eq. 3.1, r = ln(1 + p). So for instance, if growing at 2%, p = 0.02 and r also is 0.02 (r≈ p for small values of p). 
2022 T. W. Murphy, Jr.; Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International Lic.; Freely available at: https://escholarship.org/uc/energy_ambitions. 
which is really just a repeat of Eq. 3.1, where r takes the place of In(1+p). 
Example 3.2.2 Paralleling the deer population scenario from Example 3.2.1, if we set r = 0.5, and have a population of P = 100 adult deer (half female), Eq. 3.3 says that P = 50, meaning the population will change by 50 units.10 
We could then use Eq. 3.4 to determine the population after 4 years: P = 100e0.5.4≈ 739. 
Let's say that a given forest can support an ultimate number of deer, labeled Q, in steady state, while the current population is labeled P. The difference, Q-P is the "room" available for growth, which we might think of as being tied to available resources. Once P = Q, no more resources are available to support growth. 
Definition 3.2.2 The term "carrying capacity" is often used to describe Q: the population supportable by the environment. The carrying capacity (Q) for human population on Earth is not an agreed-upon number, and in any case it is a strong function of lifestyle choices and resource dependence. 
Q-P quantifies a growth-limiting mechanism by representing available room. One way to incorporate this feature into our growth rate equation is to make the rate of growth look like

population (P) 
We have multiplied the original rate of rP by a term that changes the effective growth rate r→ r(Q-P)/Q. When P is small relative to Q, the effective rate is essentially the original r. But the effective growth rate approaches zero as P approaches Q. In other words, growth slows down and hits zero when the population reaches its final saturation point, as PQ (see Figure 3.6). 
The mathematical solution to this modified differential equation (whose solution technique is beyond the scope of this course) is called a logistic curve, plotted in Figure 3.7 and having the form 
Figure 3.6: The rate of growth in the logistic model decreases as population increases, starting out at r when P :0 and reaching zero as P →Q (see Eq. 3.5).

values of P to see how the effective growth rate will be modified.

The first part of the curve in Figure 3.7, for very negative values11 of t- to, is exponential but still small. At t = to (time of inflection), the population is Q/2. As time marches forward into positive territory, P approaches Q. As it does so, negative feedback mechanisms (limits to resource/food availability, predation, disease) become more assertive 
11: The parameter to is the time when the logistic curve hits its halfway point. Times before this have negative values of t - to.

Example 3.2.3 Continuing the deer scenario, let's say the forest can ultimately support 840 adults,12 and keep r = 0.5 as the uninhibited growth rate. Using these numbers, Eq. 3.6 yields 100 adults at t = to-4 years (effectively the initial state in Example 3.2.1). One year later, at t = to 3, Eq. 3.6 yields 153-very close to the nominal addition of 50 members. But now four

The logistic curve is the dream scenario: no drama. The population simply approaches its ultimate value smoothly, in a tidy manner. We might imagine or hope that human population follows a similar path. Maybe the fact that we've hit a linear phase-consistently adding one billion people every 12 years, lately-is a sign that we are at the inflection, and will start rolling over toward a stable endpoint. If so, we know from the logistic curve that the linear part is halfway to the final population. 
3.2.1 Overshoot 
But not so fast. We left out a crucial piece: feedback delay. The math that leads to the logistic curve assumes that the negative feedback14 acts instantaneously in determining population rates. 
Consider that human decisions to procreate are based on present con- ditions: food, opportunities, stability, etc. But humans live for many decades, and do not impose their full toll on the system until many years after birth, effectively delaying the negative feedback. The logistic curve and equation that guided it had no delay built in.

Definition 3.2.3 Overshoot is a generic consequence of delaying negative feedback. Since negative feedback is a "corrective," stabilizing influence, delaying its application allows the system to "get away" from the control, thereby exceeding the target equilibrium state. 
This is a pretty easy concept to understand. The logistic curve of Figure 3.7 first accelerates, then briefly coasts before decelerating to arrive smoothly at a target. Following an example from [1], it is much like a car starting from rest by accelerating before applying the brakes to gently come to a stop when the bumper barely kisses a brick wall. The driver is operating a negative feedback loop: seeing/sensing the proximity to the wall and slowing down accordingly. The closer to the wall, the slower the driver goes until lightly touching the wall. Now imagine delaying the feedback to the driver by applying a blindfold and giving voice descriptions of the proximity to the wall, so that decisions about how much to brake are based on conditions from a delayed communication process. Obviously, the driver will crash into the wall if the feedback is delayed, unless slowing down the whole process dramatically. Likewise, if the negative consequences-signals that we need to slow down population growth-arrive decades after the act of producing more humans, we can expect to exceed the "natural" limit, Q-a condition called overshoot. 
Example 3.2.4 We did not detail the mechanisms of negative feedback operating on the deer population in Example 3.2.3 that act to stabilize the population at Q, but to illustrate how delayed negative feedback produces overshoot, consider predation as one of the operating forces. To put some simple numbers on it, let's say that steady state can support one adult (hunting) mountain lion for every 50 deer. Initially, when the population was 100 deer, this means two predators. When the deer population reaches Q = 840, we might have ~17 predators. But it takes time for the predators to react to the growing number of prey, perhaps taking a few years to produce the requisite number of hunting adults. Lacking the full complement of predators, the deer population will sail past the 840 mark until the predator population rises to establish the ultimate balance. In fact, the predators will likely also exceed their steady population in a game of catch-up that leads to oscillations like those seen in Figure 3.8. 
We can explore what happens to our logistic curve if the negative feedback is delayed by various amounts. Figure 3.8 gives a few examples of overshoot as the delay increases. To avoid significant overshoot, the delay (7) needs to be smaller than the natural timescale governing the problem: 1/r, where r is the rate in Eqs. 3.5 and 3.6. In our deer example using r = 0.5, any delay longer than about 2 years causes overshoot. For more modest growth rates (human populations), relevant delays are in decades (see Box 3.1). 
By "generic consequence," we just mean an outcome that is characteristic of the situa- tion, independent of details. 
[1]: Meadows et al. (1972), The Limits to Growth: A Report for the Club of Rome's Project on the Predicament of Mankind 
Another example of feedback delay leading to overshoot: let's say you are holding down the space bar and trying to position the cursor in the middle of the screen. But your connection is lagging and even though you release the space bar when you see the cursor reach the middle, it keeps sailing past due to the delay: overshooting.

Figure 3.8: Feedback delay generally re- sults in overshoot and oscillation, shown for various delay values, T. The black curve (T 0) is the nominal no-delay logistic curve. As the delay increases, the severity of overshoot increases. Delays are explored in increments of 0.5 times the characteris- tic timescale of 1/r (using r = 0.5 here to match previous examples, so that a delay of 1.5/r equates to 3 time units on the graph, for instance). The delay durations are also indicated by bar lengths in the leg- end. 
15 
Eventually all the curves in Figure 3.8 converge to the steady state value of 1.0, but human population involves complexities not captured in this bare-bones mathematical model.16 All the same, the generic phenomenon of overshooting when negative feedback is delayed is a robust attribute, even if the oscillation and eventual settling does not capture the future of human population well.

Figure 3.9: Human population data points (blue) and a logistic curve (red) that repre- sents the best fit to data points from 1950 onward. The resulting logistic function has Q≈ 12 Gppl, r = 0.028, and a midpoint at the year 1997. The actual data sequence has a sudden bend at 1950 (Green Revolution?) that prevents a suitable fit to a larger span of data. In other words, the actual data do not follow a single logistic function very well, which is to be expected when conditions change suddenly (energy and technology, in this case) [14, 15]. 
Box 3.1: Will Human Population Overshoot? 
Are humans in danger of population overshoot? What is our r value? It is tempting to take r = 0.01 corresponding to the present 1% growth rate. This would imply that any delay shorter than 100 years will not produce significant overshoot, which seems reassuring. But if human population is following a logistic curve rather than an exponential, resource availability is already exerting a moderating influence, now appearing to be in the linear "cruise" phase roughly

halfway to the limiting value. A fit to the data (Figure 3.9) suggests that r≈ 0.028, corresponding to a timescale of 36 years (1/r). This puts the overshoot-prone delay squarely into relevant timescales for human lifetimes, generations, and societal change—thus leaving the door open for an overshoot scenario.

3.2.2 Logistic Projection 
As suggested by Figure 3.9, Human population is not following a strict logistic curve. If it were, the early period would look exponential at the ~2.8% rate corresponding to the best-fit logistic matching our recent trajectory, but growth was substantially slower than 2.8% in the past. Technology and fossil fuels have boosted our recent growth well beyond the sub-percent rates typical before ~1950. The point is that while reference to mathematical models can be extremely helpful in framing our thinking and exposing robust, generic modes of interest, we should seldom take any mathematical model literally, as it likely does not capture the full complexity of the system it is trying to model. In the present case, it is enough to note that: 
1. exponentials relentlessly drive toward infinity (ultimately unreal- 
istic); 
2. logistic curves add a sensible layer of reality, capping growth in 
some steady-state outcome; 
3. other dynamical factors such as delays can prevent a smooth 
logistic function, possibly leading to overshoot; and 
4. many other factors (medical and technological breakthroughs, war, famine, climate change) can muddy the waters in ways that could make the situation better or worse than simple projections. 
3.3 Demographic Transition 
Perhaps not surprisingly, the rate of a country's population growth is correlated to its wealth, as seen in Figure 3.10. An attractive path to reducing population growth would be to have poor countries slide down this curve to the right: becoming more affluent and transforming societal values and pressures accordingly to produce a lower net population growth rate. 
Population growth happens when the birth rate exceeds the death rate. 
Definition 3.3.1 Birth rate, typically expressed in births per 1,000 people per year, minus death rate (also in deaths per 1,000 people per year) is the net population rate. If the difference is positive, the population grows, and it shrinks if the difference is negative.

Figure 3.10: Net population rate, in per- cent, as a function of per-capita GDP. A clear trend shows wealthier countries hav- ing lower growth rates. A win-win solution would seem to present itself, in which every- one arrives at the lower right-hand side of this graph: more money for all and a stable population! Dot size (area) is proportional to population [6, 8, 19, 20]. 
Example 3.3.1 The U.S. has a birth rate of about 12 people per 1,000 per year, and a death rate of 8.1 people per 1,000 per year. The net rate is then roughly +4 per 1,000 per year, translating to 0.4% net growth. 
Niger has a birth rate of 46 per 1,000 per year and a death rate of 11, resulting in a net of positive 35, or 3.5%. 
As conditions change, birth and death rates need not change in lock-step. Developed countries tend to have low birth rates and low death rates, balancing to a relatively low net population growth rate. Developing countries tend to have high death rates and even higher birth rates, leading to large net growth rates. Figure 3.11 depicts both birth rates and death rates for the countries of the world. A few countries (mostly in Europe) have slipped below the replacement line, indicating declining population.19 
The general sense is that developed countries have "made it" to a respon- sible low-growth condition, and that population growth is driven by poorer countries. An attractive solution to many20 is to bring developing countries up to developed-country standards so that they, too, can settle into a low growth rate. This evolution from a fast-growing poor country to a slow (or zero) growth well-off country is called the demographic transition. 
Definition 3.3.2 The demographic transition refers to the process by which developing countries having high death rates and high birth rates adopt technologies, education, and higher standards of living that result in low death rates and low birth rates, more like advanced countries. 
In order to accomplish this goal, reduced death rates are facilitated by

introducing modern medicine and health services to the population. Reduced birth rates are partly in response to reduced infant mortality— eventually leading to fewer children as survival is more guaranteed. But also important is better education-especially among women in the society who are more likely to have jobs and be empowered to exercise control of their reproduction (e.g., more say in relationships and/or use of contraception). All of these developments take time and substantial financial investment.21 Also, the economy in general must be able to support a larger and better-educated workforce. The demographic transition is envisioned as a transformation or complete overhaul, resulting in a country more in the mold of a "first-world" country.22

Figure 3.11 hints at the narrative. Countries are spread into an arc, one segment occupying a band between 5-10 deaths per 1,000 people per year and birth rates lower than 20 per 1,000 people per year. Another set of countries (many of which are in Africa) have birth rates above 20 per 1,000 per year, but also show higher death rates. The narrative₤20- arc is that a country may start near Lesotho, at high death and birth rates, then migrate over toward Nigeria as death rates fall (and birth rates experience a temporary surge). Next both death and birth rates fall and run through a progression toward Pakistan, India, the U.S., and finally the European steady state. Figure 3.12 schematically illustrates the typical journey. 
The demographic transition receives widespread advocacy among West- ern intellectuals for its adoption, often coupled with the sentiment that it can't come soon enough. Indeed, the humanitarian consequences appear to be positive and substantial: fewer people living in poverty and hunger;

It might even seem condemnable not to wish for these things for all people on Earth. 
However, we need to understand the consequences. Just because we want something does not mean nature will comply. Do we have the resources to accomplish this goal? If we fail in pursuit of a global demographic transition, have we unwittingly unleashed even greater suffering on humanity by increasing the total number of people who can no longer be supported? It is possible that well-intentioned actions produce catastrophic results, so let us at least understand what is at stake. may be condemnable not to wish for a global demographic transition, but failing to explore potential downsides may be equally ignoble.

net population rate (annual births minus deaths per 1000 people) 
Figure 3.13 shows the net population rate (birth minus death rate) on a world map. Africa stands out as the continent having the largest net population growth rate, and has been the focus of much attention when discussing population dynamics. 
But let us cast population rates in different countries in a new light. Referring to Figure 3.13, it is too easy to look at Niger's net population rate—which is about ten times higher than that of the U.S. (see Example 3.3.1) and conclude that countries similar to Niger present a greater risk to the planet in terms of population growth. However, our perspective changes when we consider absolute population levels. Who cares if a country's growth rate is an explosive 10% if the population is only 73 people?23 
Figure 3.14 multiplies the net rate by population to see which countries contribute the most net new people to the planet each year, and Table 3.3 lists the top ten. Africa no longer appears to be the most worrisome region in this light.24 India is the largest people-producing country at present, adding almost 18 million per year. Far behind is China, in second

Figure 3.14: Absolute population growth rate by country: how many millions of peo- ple are added per year (birth rate minus death rate times population) [8, 19, 20]. 
Table 3.3: Top ten populators [8, 19, 20], in terms of absolute number of people added to each country. Birth rates and death rates are presented as number per 1,000 people per year. These ten countries account for 55% of population growth worldwide. 
Adding another relevant perspective, when one considers that the per- capita energy consumption in the United States is more than 200 times that of Niger,25 together with the larger U.S. population, we find that the resource impact from births is almost 400 times higher for the U.S. than for Niger.26 On a per capita basis, a citizen of the U.S. places claims on future resources at a rate 28 times higher than a citizen of Niger via population growth.27 On a finite planet, the main reason we care about population growth is in relation to limited resources. Thus from the resource point of view, the problem is not at all confined to the developing world. Table 3.4 indicates how rapidly the top ten countries are creating energy demand (as a proxy to resource demands in general) based on population growth alone. Figure 3.15 provides a graphical perspective of the same (for all countries). For reference, one gigawatt (GW) is the equivalent of a large-scale nuclear or coal-fired power plant. So China, the U.S., and India each add the equivalent of 10-20 such plants per year just to satisfy the demand created by population growth.2 
28 
25: The average American rate of energy use is 10,000 W vs. 50 W for Niger. 
26: In other words, for every additional kilogram of coal, steel, or whatever required by Niger's added population, the U.S. will require 400 kg of the same to satisfy its population growth. 
27: 28 is smaller than 400 by the ratio of populations in the two countries. 
28: This does not even consider rising stan- dards placing additional burdens.

The last column in Table 3.4 is the per-citizen cost, meaning, for instance that each person in the U.S. adds about 50 Watts per year of energy demand via the country's net population growth rate.29 In this sense, the last column is a sort of "personal contribution" an individual makes to the world's resource demands via net population rates and consumption rates in their society. Those having high scores should think twice about assigning blame externally, and should perhaps tend to their own house, as the saying goes. 
Before departing this section, let us look at continent-scale regions rather than individual countries in terms of adding people and resource demands. Table 3.5 echoes similar information to that in Table 3.4, in modified form. What we learn from this table is that Asia's demands are commensurate with their already-dominant population; North America creates the next largest pressure despite a much smaller population; 
Figure 3.15: Graphical representation of Ta- ble 3.4, for all countries. Dots, whose size is proportional to population, indicate how many people are added per year, and how much additional energy demand is created as a consequence. Color indicates the added population-growth-driven power demand an individual citizen is responsible for gen- erating each year as a member of the society. Negative cases (contracting) include Russia, Japan, Germany, and Ukraine [7, 8, 19, 20]. 
29: A citizen of Niger, by comparison, only adds 1.7 W of demand per year on energy resources via population growth.

Africa is significant in terms of population growth, but constitutes only 10% of resource pressure at present. Finally, Europe holds 10% of the globe's people but lays no claim on added resources via pop- ulation growth, resembling the target end-state of the demographic transition.3 30 
3.3.2 Cost of the Demographic Transition 
A final point relates to the trajectory depicted in Figure 3.12 for demo- graphic transitions: death rate decreases first while birth rates remain high or rise even higher-before starting to come down. An example se- quence is illustrated in Figure 3.16: initially the rates are high (at r1), and the same (resulting in steady population); then the death rate transitions to a new low rate (r2) over a time T; and the birth rate begins to fall some time t later before matching the death rate and stabilizing population again. The yellow-shaded area between the curves indicates the region where birth rate exceeds death rate, leading to a net population growth (a surge in population). 
The amount of growth in the surge turns out to be proportional to the exponential of the area between the curves. For this trapezoid cartoon, the area is just the base (T) times the height (rate difference), so that the population increase looks like e(1-2), where r1 is the initial rate per year and r2 is the final rate. The actual curves may take any number of forms, but the key point is that delayed onset of birth rate decrease introduces a population surge, and that magnitude of the surge grows as the area between the curves increases. 
Example 3.3.2 If we start at a birth/death rate of 25 per 1,000 per year (r1 = 0.025), end up at 8 (r2 = 0.008; verify that these numbers are reasonable according to Figure 3.11), and have a delay of t = 50 years for the birth rate to start decreasing, we see the population increasing by a factor of

Figure 3.16: Schematic demographic transi- tion time sequence. 
Note in the cartoon example of Figure 3.16, the area between the curves is only depen- dent on the rate difference (height) and the delay, 7. The time it takes to complete the transition, T, is irrelevant, as the area of the parallelogram is just the base times the height. Thus the population surge as- sociated with a demographic transition is primarily sensitive to the rate difference and the delay until birth rate begins to decline.

This means that the population more than doubles, or increases by 134%. 
So to effect a demographic transition means to increase the population burden substantially. Meanwhile, the transitioned population consumes resources at a greater rate—a natural byproduct of running a more advanced society having better medical care, education, and employment opportunities. Transportation, manufacturing, and consumer activity all increase. The net effect is a double-whammy: the combined impact of a greater population using more resources per capita. The resource impact on the planet soars. 
The pertinent question is whether the Earth is prepared to host a dramatic increase in resource usage. Just because we might find appealing the idea that all countries on Earth could make it through the demographic transition and live at a first-world standard does not mean nature has the capacity to comply. The U.S. per-capita energy usage is roughly five times the current global average. To bring 7 billion people to the same standard would require five times the current scale. Completion of a global demographic transition would roughly double the current world population so that the total increase in energy would be a factor of ten. The blue-dashed projection in Figure 3.17 looks rather absurd as an extension of the more modest-but still rather remarkable energy climb to date. As we are straining to satisfy current energy demand, the "amazing dream" scenario seems unlikely to materialize. 
Energy in this context is a proxy for other material resources. Consider the global-scale challenges we have introduced today: deforestation, fisheries collapse, water pressures, soil degradation, pollution, climate change, and species loss, for instance. What makes us think we can survive a global demographic transition leading to a consumption rate many times higher than that of today? Does it not seem that we are already approaching a breaking point? 
If nature won't let us realize a particular dream, then is it morally responsible to pursue it? This question becomes particularly acute if the very act of pursuing the dream increases the pressure on the system and makes failure even more likely. Total suffering might be maximized if the population builds to a point of collapse. In this sense, we cleverly stack the most possible people into the stadium to witness a most spectacular event: the stadium's collapse-which only happened because we packed the stadium. You see the irony, right? 
The drive to realize a global demographic transition is strong, for the obvi- ous set of reasons discussed above (improved quality of life, educational opportunity, greater tolerance, dignity, and fulfillment). Challenging the vision may 
be an uphill battle, since awareness about resource limits is not prevalent. This may be an example of the natural human tendency to extrapolate: we have seen the benefits of the demographic transition in many countries over the last century, and may expect this trend to

continue until all countries have completed the journey. But bear in mind that earlier successes transpired during times in which global resource availability was not a major limitation. If conditions change, and we reach a "full" earth, past examples may offer little relevant guidance. 
3.4 Touchy Aspects 
3.4.1 Population Discussions Quickly Get Personal 
Some of the decisions we make that translate into impact on our physical world are deeply personal and very difficult to address. No one wants to be told what they should eat, how often they should shower, or what temperature they should keep their dwelling. But the touchiest of all can be reproduction. It can be tricky to discuss population concerns with someone who has kids. Even if not intentional, it is too easy for the topic to be perceived as a personal attack on their own choices. And we're not talking about choices like what color socks to wear. Children are beloved by (most) parents, so the insinuation that having children is bad or damaging quickly gets tangled into a sense that their "angel" is being attacked-as is their "selfish" decision to have kids (see Box 3.2). The disconnect can be worse the larger the number of kids someone has. Couples having two kids take some solace in that they are exercising net-zero "replacement." 
One common side-step is to focus attention on the high birthrates in other countries, so that the perceived fault lies elsewhere. As pointed out above, if stress on the planet-and living within our means-is what concerns us, undeveloped countries are not putting as much pressure on global resources as many of the more affluent countries are. So while pointing elsewhere offers a bit of a relief, and is a very natural tendency, it does not get the whole picture. 
The overall point is to be aware of the sensitive nature of this topic when discussing with others. Making someone feel bad about their choices- even if unintentionally-might in rare cases result in an appreciation and greater awareness. But it is more likely to alienate a person from an otherwise valuable perspective on the challenges we face. 
Box 3.2: Which is More Selfish? 
Parents, many of whom sacrifice dearly in raising kids-financially, emotionally, and in terms of time investment—understandably view their tireless commitment as being selfless: they often give up their own time, comfort, and freedom in the process. It is understandable, then, that they may view those not having kids as being selfish: the opposite of selfless. But this can be turned on its head. Why, 
Having two kids is not a strict replacement, in that parents and children overlap (double- occupancy) on Earth. But the practice is at least consistent with a steady state.

exactly, did they decide to have kids and contribute to the toll on our planet? It was their choice (or inattention) that placed them in parental roles, and the entire planet—not just humans-pays a price for their decision, making it seem a bit selfish.31 In the end, almost any decision we make can be called selfish, since we usually have our own interests at least partly in mind. So it is pointless to try assigning more or less selfishness to the decision to have kids or not to have them. But consider this: if the rest of the Earth-all its plants and creatures—had a say, do you think they would vote for adding another human to the planet? Humans have the capacity, at least, to consider a greater picture than their own self interest, and provide representation to those sectors that otherwise have no rights or voice in our highly human-centric system.

31: Reasons for having children are numer- ous: genetic drive; family name/tradition; labor source; care in old age; companionship and love (projected onto not-yet-existing person). Note that adoption can also satisfy many of these aims without contributing additional population. 
3.4.2 Population Policy 
What could governments and other organizations do to manage popula- tion? Again, this is touchy territory, inviting collision between deeply personal or religious views and the state. China initiated a one-child pol- icy in 1979 that persisted until 2015 (exceptions were granted depending on location and gender). The population in China never stopped climb- ing during this period, as children born during prior periods of higher birth rates matured and began having children of their own-even if restricted in number. The population curve in China is not expected to flatten out until sometime in the 2030-2040 period.32 Such top-down policies can only be enacted in strong authoritarian regimes, and would be seen as a severe infringement on personal liberties in many countries. Religious belief systems can also run counter to deliberate efforts to limit population growth. In addition, shrinking countries are at a competitive disadvantage in global markets, often leading to policies that incentivize having children. 
One striking example of rarely-achieved sustainable population control comes from the South Pacific island of Tikopia [21]. Maintaining a stable population for a few thousand years on this small island involved not only adopting food practices as close to the island's natural plants as possible, but also invoking strict population controls. The chiefs in this egalitarian society routinely preached zero population growth, and also prevented overfishing. Strict limits were placed on family size, and cultural taboos kept this small island at a population around 1,200.33 Population control methods included circumventing insemination, abortion, infanticide, suicide, or "virtual suicide," via embarking on dangerous sea voyages unlikely to succeed. In this way, the harshness of nature was replaced by harsh societal norms that may seem egregious to us. When Christian missionaries converted inhabitants in the twentieth century, the practices of abortion, infanticide and suicide were quenched and the population 
The net effect of the various exceptions meant that for most of this period half of Chinese parents could have a second child. 
32: This is another case of delay in negative feedback resulting in overshoot.

began to climb, leading to famine and driving the population excess off the island. 
In the end, personal choice will be important, if we are to tame the population predicament. Either conditions will be too uncertain to justify raising children, or we adopt values that place short term personal and human needs into a larger context concerning ecosystems and long-term human happiness. 
3.5 Upshot: Everything Depends on Us 
We would likely not be discussing a finite planet or limits to growth or climate change if only one million humans inhabited the planet, even living at United States standards. We would perceive no meaningful limit to natural resources and ecosystem services. Conversely, it is not difficult to imagine that 100 billion people on Earth would place a severe strain on the planet's ability to support us-especially if trying to live like Americans—to the point of likely being impossible. If we had to pick a single parameter to dial in order to ease our global challenges, it would be hard to find a more effective one than population. 
Maybe we need not take any action. Negative feedback will assert itself strongly once we have gone too far-either leading to a steady approach to equilibrium or producing an overshoot/collapse outcome. Nature will regulate human population one way or another. It just may not be in a manner to our liking, and we have the opportunity to do better via awareness and choice. 
Very few scholars are unconcerned about population pressure. Yet the issue is consistently thorny due to both its bearing on personal choice and a justified reluctance to "boss" developing nations to stop growing prior to having an opportunity to naturally undergo a demographic transition for themselves. Conventional thinking suggests that under- going the demographic transition ultimately is the best solution to the population problem. The question too few ask is whether the planet can support this path for all, given the associated population surge and concomitant demand on resources. If not, pursuit of the transition for the world may end up causing more damage and suffering than would otherwise happen due to increased populations competing for dwindling resources. 
Nature, it turns out, is indifferent to our belief systems. 
A common knee-jerk reaction to a statement that we would be better off with a smaller population is to demand an answer to who, exactly, we propose eliminating. Ideally, we should be able to discuss an important topic like population without resorting to accu- sations of advocating genocide. Of course we need to take care of those already alive, and address the problem via future repro- ductive choices. 
3.6 Problems 
1. The text accompanying Figure 3.1 says that Earth currently hosts the equivalent of 25 billion nineteenth-century-level energy consumers. If we had maintained our nineteenth-century energy appetite but

followed the same population curve, what would our global power demand be today, in TW? How does this compare to the actual 18 TW we use today? 
2. Notice that on logarithmic plots,34 factors of ten on the logarithmic axis span the same distance. This applies for any numerical factor- not just ten.35 Shorter (minor) tick marks between labeled (major) ticks multiply the preceding tick label by 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. The graphic below illustrates the constant distance property for a factor of two.36 Now try a different multiplier (not 2 or 10), measuring the distance between tick marks, and report/draw how you graphically verified that your numerical factor spans the same distance no matter where you "slide" it on the axis. 
Hint: It is perfectly acceptable to hold a (preferably transparent) straight-edge up to a graph! 
34: See, for example, Figures 3.3 and 3.4.

3. Looking at Figure 3.3, if humans had continued the slow growth phase characteristic of the period until about 1700, what does the graph suggest world population would be today, approximately, if the magenta line were extended to "now?"37 Put the answer in familiar terms, measured in millions or billions, depending on what is most natural.3

4. Looking at Figure 3.4, if humans had continued the moderate growth phase characteristic of the period from the year 1000 to 1700, what does the graph suggest world population would be today, approximately, if the magenta line were extended to "now?" 
5. If we were to continue a 1% population growth trajectory into the future, work out how many years it would take to go from 7 billion people to 8 billion, and then from 8 billion to 9 billion. 
6. At present, a billion people are added to the planet every 12 years. If we maintain a 1% growth rate in population, what will global population be in 2100 (use numbers in Table 3.2 as a starting point), and how quickly will we add each new billion at that point?

think that is (hint: what changed so that we invalidated a single, continuous mathematical function)? 
8. Using the logistic model presented in Problem 7, what would the population be in the year 2100? How does this compare to the exponential result at 1% growth as in Problem 6? 
9. Which of the following are examples of positive feedback, and 
which are examples of negative feedback? 
a) a warming arctic melts ice, making it darker, absorbing more 
solar energy 
b) if the earth's temperature rises, its infrared radiation to space 
increases, providing additional cooling 
c) a car sits in a dip; pushing it forward results in a backward 
force, while pushing it backward results in a forward force d) a car sits on a hill; pushing it either way results in an acceler- 
ation (more force, thanks to gravity) in that direction 
e) a child wails loudly and throws a tantrum; to calm the child, parents give it some candy: will this encourage or discourage similar behaviors going forward? 
10. Think up an example from daily life (different from examples in the text) for how a delay in negative feedback can produce overshoot, and describe the scenario. 
11. Pick five countries of interest to you not represented in any of the tables in this chapter and look up their birth rate and death rate [19, 20], then find the corresponding dot on Figure 3.11, if possible. 40 At the very least, identify the corresponding region on the plot. 
12. A country in the early stages of a demographic transition may have trimmed its death rate to 15 per 1,000 people per year, but still have a birth rate of 35 per 1,000 per year. What does this amount do in terms of net people added to the population each year, per 1,000 people? What rate of growth is this, in percent? 
13. If the population of the country in Problem 12 is 20 million this year, how many people would we expect it to have next year? How many were born, and how many died during the year? 
14. Figure 3.11 shows Egypt standing well above China in terms of excess birth rate compared to death rate.41 Yet Table 3.3 indicates that China contributes a much larger annual addition to global population than does Egypt. Explain why. Then, using the first four columns in Table 3.3, replicate the math that produced the final column's entries for these two countries to reinforce your understanding of the interaction between birth and death rates and population in terms of absolute effect. 
15. In a few clear sentences, explain why the maps in Figure 3.13

16. Table 3.4 indicates which countries place the highest population- driven new demand on global resources using energy as a proxy. Which countries can American citizens regard as contributing more total resource demand? At the individual citizen-contribution level, what other citizens can Americans identify as being responsible for a greater demand on resources via population growth? 
17. The last two columns in Table 3.4 were computed for this book from available information on population, birth and death rates, and annual energy usage for each country (as represented in the first four columns; references in the caption). Use logical reasoning to replicate the calculation that produces the last two columns from the others and report how the computation goes, using an example from the table. 
18. The bottom row of Table 3.4 is important enough to warrant having students pull out and interpret its content. What is world population, in billions? How many people are added to the world each year? What is the typical power demand for a global citizen (and how does it compare to the U.S.)? If a typical coal or nuclear plant puts out 1 GW of power, how many power-plant-equivalents must we add each year to keep up with population increase? And finally, how much power (in W) is added per global citizen each year due to population growth (and it is worth reflecting on which countries contribute more than this average)? 
19. If you were part of a global task force given the authority to make binding recommendations to address pressures on resources due to population growth, which three countries stand out as having the largest impact at present? Would the recommendations be the same for all three? If not, how might they differ? 
20. Table 3.5 helps differentiate concerns over which region contributes pressures in raw population versus population-driven resource demand. By taking the ratio of population growth (in %) to population (as % of world population), we get a measure of whether a region is "underperforming" or "overperforming" relative to its population. Likewise, by taking the ratio of the added power (in %) to population, we get a similar measure of performance in resource demand. In this context, which region has the highest ratio for population pressure, and which region has the highest ratio for population-induced pressure on energy resources? 
21. If a country starting out at 30 million people undergoes the demographic transition, starting at birth/death rates of 35 per 1,000 per year and ending up at 10 per 1,000 per year, what will the final population be if the delay, 7, is 40 years? 
3 Population 51 
The point is that the U.S. is a major con- tributor to increased resource demand via population growth. 
Careful about 106 factors and GW = 109 W. 
Some students may see this as free/easy points, but consider the value in internaliz- ing the associated information. 
For instance, Oceania has a ratio of 1.0 for population growth (0.5% of popula- tion growth and 0.5% of global population), meaning it is not over- or under-producing relative to global norms. But in terms of power, it is 3 times the global expectation (1.5 divided by 0.5).

22. The set of diagrams below show five different time sequences 
on the left akin to Figure 3.16, labeled 1-5. The first four on the left have increasing 7 (delay until birth rate begins falling), and the last increases birth rate before falling again. On the right are five trajectories in the birth/death rate space (like Figure 3.12), scrambled into a different order and labeled A-E.42 Deduce how the corresponding trajectory for each time sequence would appear in the birth/death rate plot on the right, matching letters to numbers for all five.

4 Space Exploration vs. Colonization 
This textbook assesses the challenges and limitations imposed upon us by living on a finite planet having finite resources. If harboring expectations that we will break out into a space-faring existence as a way to mitigate our earthly challenges, then it becomes harder for us to respond earnestly to information about where things are headed on Earth. This chapter is placed where it is to "close the exit" so that the content in the rest of the book might become more relevant and worth the investment to learn. Some of the sections in this chapter offer more of an author's perspective than might be typical for a textbook. Some may disagree with the case that is made, but consider that the burden of proof for a way of life unfathomably beyond our current means should perhaps fall to the enthusiasts.1 
4.1 Scale of Space 
In the span of two hours, we can sit through a movie and "participate" in interstellar travel without getting tired. Let's step out of the entertainment (fiction) industry and come to terms with the physical scale of the real space environment. 
Describing an analogous scale model of the solar system, galaxy, and universe as we will do momentarily is a fraught exercise, because in order to arrive at physical scales for which we have solid intuition (driving distance in a day?) we end up with inconceivably small (invisible) specks representing familiar objects like the earth. By the time we make Earth the size of something we can hold and admire, the scales become too big for easy comprehension. Figures 4.1 and 4.2 demonstrate how awkward or impossible correctly-scaled graphics are in a textbook.

Figure 4.2: Proving the point that textbooks are not conducive to correctly-scaled graphics of objects in space, by the time the Earth-Sun distance spans the page, 
Earth (on far right) is too small to be visible in print, at less than 1% the diameter of the orange sun at far left. The Earth-Moon distance is about the width of the arrow shaft pointing to Earth. Humans have never traveled more than the arrow shaft's width from Earth, and have not even gone 0.2% that far in about 50 years! Mars, on average, is farther from Earth than is the sun. 
Let us first lay out some basic ratios that can help build suitable mental models at whatever scale we choose. 
Definition 4.1.1 Scale models of the universe can be built based on these approximate relations, some of which appear in Table 4.1 and Table 4.2: 
1. The moon's diameter is one-quarter that of Earth, and located 30 earth-diameters (60 Earth-radii) away from Earth, on average (see Figure 4.1). 
2. The sun's diameter is about 100 times that of Earth, and 400 times as 
far as the moon from Earth (see Figure 4.2). 
3. Mars' diameter is about half that of Earth, and the distance from Earth 
ranges from 0.4 to 2.7 times the Earth-Sun distance. 
4. Jupiter's diameter is about 10 times larger than Earth's and 10 times smaller than the sun's; it is about 5 times farther from the sun than is the earth. 
5. Neptune orbits the sun 30 times farther than does Earth. 
6. The Oort cloud2 of comets ranges from about 2,000 to 100,000 times 
the Earth-Sun distance from the sun. 
7. The nearest star3 is 4.2 light years from us, compared to 500 light- 
seconds from Earth to the sun-a ratio of 270,000. 
8. The Milky Way galaxy has its center about 25,000 light years away 
away, and is a disk about four times that size in diameter. 
9. The next large galaxy5 is 2.5 million light years away, or about 25 
Milky Way diameters away. 
10. The edge of the visible universe is 13.8 billion light years away, or 
about 6,000 times the distance to the Andromeda galaxy. 
We will construct a model using the set of scale relations in Definition 4.1.1, starting local on a comfortable scale. 
We'll make Earth the size of a grain of sand (about 1 mm diameter). The moon is a smaller speck (dust?) and the diameter of its orbit would 
span 
the separation of your eyes. On this scale, the sun is 100 mm in diameter (a grapefruit) and about 12 meters away (40 feet). Mars could be anywhere from 4.5 meters (15 feet) to 30 meters (100 feet) away. Reflect

for a second that humans have never ventured farther from Earth than the moon, at 3 cm (just over an inch) in this scale. Mars is outlandishly farther. Neptune is about four-tenths of a kilometer away (on campus at this scale), and the next star is over 3,000 km (roughly San Diego to Atlanta). So we've already busted our easy intuitive reckoning and we haven't even gotten past the first star. Furthermore, this was starting with the earth as a tiny grain of sand. We've only ever traveled two- finger-widths away from Earth on this scale, and the next star is like going on a giant trip across the country. For apples-to-apples, compare how long it takes to walk a distance of two-finger-widths (3 cm) to the time it would take to walk across the U.S. The former feat of traveling to the moon was super-hard; the latter is comparatively impossible. 
Box 4.1: When Will We Get There? 
8 
It took 12 years for Voyager 2 to get to Neptune, which is "in our back yard." The only spacecraft to date traveling fast enough to leave the solar system are the two Voyagers, the two Pioneers, and the New Horizons probe [23]. The farthest and fastest of this set is Voyager 1 at about 150 times the Earth-Sun distance after 43 years. The closest star is about 2,000 times farther. At its present speed of 17 km/s, it would reach the distance to the nearest star in another 75,000 years. 
The fastest spacecraft on record as yet is the Parker Solar Probe, which got up to a screaming 68.6 km/s, but only because it was plunging (falling) around the sun. Because it was so close to the sun, even this amount of speed was not enough to allow it climb out of the sun's gravitational grip and escape, as the five aforementioned probes managed to do. Even if Voyager 1 ended up with 70 km/s left over after breaking free of the solar system,10 it would still take 20,000 years to reach the distance to the nearest star. Note that human lifetimes are about 200 times shorter. 
Pushing a human-habitable spacecraft up to high speed is immensely harder than accelerating these scrappy little probes, so the challenges are varied and extreme. For reference, the Apollo missions to the very nearby Moon carried almost 3,000 tons of fuel [24], or about. 80,000 times the typical car's gasoline tank capacity. It would take 
Table 4.2: Symbols, relative sizes, and dis- tances in the solar system and to the nearest star. An AU is an Astronomical Unit, which is the average Earth-Sun distance of about 150 million kilometers. The fact that both the sun and moon are 240 of their radii away from Earth is why they appear to be a similar size on the sky, leading to "just so" eclipses.

a typical car 2,000 years to spend this much fuel. Do you think the astronauts argued about who should pay for the gas? 
Let's relax the scale slightly, making the sun a chickpea (garbanzo bean). Earth is now the diameter of a human hair (easy to lose), and one meter from the sun. The moon is essentially invisible and a freckle's-width away from the earth. The next star is now 300 km away (a 3-hour drive at freeway speed), while the Milky Way center is 1.5 million kilometers away. Oops. This is more than four times the actual Earth-Moon distance. We busted our scale again without even getting out of the galaxy. 
So we reset and make the sun a grain of sand. Now the earth is 10 cm away and the next star is 30 km.11 Think about space this way: the swarm of stars within a galaxy are like grains of sand tens of kilometers apart. On this scale, solar systems are bedroom-sized, composed of a brightly growing grain of sand in the middle and a few specks of dust (planets) sprinkled about the room.12 It gets even emptier in the vast tracts between the stars. The Milky Way extent on this scale is still much larger than the actual Earth, comparable to the size of the lunar orbit.

In fairness, fuel requirements don't simply scale with distance for space travel, unlike travel in a car. Still, just getting away from Earth requires a hefty fuel load.

12: Even a solar system, which is a sort of local oasis within the galaxy, is mostly empty space. 
Box 4.2: Cosmic Scales 
It is not necessary to harp further on the vastness of space, but having come this far some students may be interested in completing the visualization journey. 
As mind-bogglingly large as the solar system is, not to mention that it itself is dwarfed by interstellar distances, which in turn are minuscule compared to the scale of the galaxy, how can we possibly appreciate the largest scales in the universe? Let's start by making galaxies manageable. If galaxies are like coins (say a U.S. dime at approximately 1 cm diameter), they are typically separated by meter- like scales. The edge of the visible universe (see Sec. D.1; p. 392) would be only 1.5 km away. Finally, the picture is easy to visualize: coins as galaxies separated by something like arm's length and extending over an area like the center of a moderately-sized town. We can even imagine the frothy, filamentary arrangement of these galaxies, containing house-sized (5–50 m) voids empty of coins (galaxies). See Figure 4.3 for a visual explanation. 
But penetrating the nature of the individual galaxies (coins, in the previous example scale) is extremely daunting: they are mostly empty space, and by the time we reduce the galaxy to a manageable scale (say 10 km, so that we can picture the whole thing as city-sized), individual stars are a few tenths of a meter apart and only about 50 atoms across (roughly 10 nm). Cells and bacteria are about 100-1,000 times larger than this. So it's nearly impossible to conceive of the scale of the galaxy while simultaneously appreciating the sizes of the stars and just how much space lies between. 
Figure 4.3: Galaxies are actually distributed in a frothy foam-like pattern crudely lining the edges of vast bubbles (voids; appearing as dark regions in the image). This structure forms as a natural consequence of gravity as galaxies pull on each other and coalesce into groups, leaving emptiness between. This graphic shows the bubble edges and filaments where galaxies collect. The larger galaxies are bright dots in this view-almost like cities along a 3-dimensional web of highways through the vast emptiness. From the Millennium Simulation [25].

travel 
Given the vastness of space, it is negligent to think of space as a "solution" to our present set of challenges on Earth-challenges that operate on a much shorter timescale than it would take to muster any meaningful space presence. Moreover, space travel is enormously expensive energetically and economically (see Table 4.3). As we find ourselves competing for dwindling one-time resources later this century, space travel will have a hard time getting priority, except in the context of escapist entertainment.13 
4.2 The Wrong Narrative 
Humans are not shy about congratulating themselves on accomplish- ments, and yes, we have done rather remarkable things. An attractive and common sentiment casts our narrative in evolutionary terms: fish crawled out of the ocean, birds took to the air, and humans are making the next logical step to space-continuing the legacy of escaping the bondage of water, land, and finally Earth. It is a compelling tale, and we have indeed learned to escape Earth's gravitational pull and set foot on another body. 
But let's not get ahead of ourselves. Just because we can point to a few special example accomplishments does not mean that such examples presage a new normal. A person can climb Mt. Everest, but it is not ever likely to become a commonplace activity. We can build a supersonic passenger airplane for trans-atlantic flight, but it does not mean it will be viable to sustain.14 One can set up a backyard obstacle course for squirrels and generate viral videos, but the amusing demonstration does not signal a "new normal" in backyard design. We need to separate the possible from the practical. The moon landings might then be viewed as a nifty stunt a demonstration of capability-rather than a path to our future. We encountered similar arguments in Chapter 2 in relation to decoupling: just because it can happen in certain domains of the economy does not mean that the entire economy can decouple and "defy gravity." 
The attractive evolutionary argument misses two critical facets of reality. When fish crawled out of the sea, they escaped predation (as the first animals on land) and found new food sources free of competition. That's a win-win: less dangerous, more sustenance.15 Likewise, when birds took flight (or we could discuss insects, which beat the birds to it), it was a similar story: evade ground-based predators who could not fly, and access a whole new menu of food-another win-win. 
Going to space could easily be cast as a lose-lose. It's an extremely hostile environment offering no protection or safe haven,16 and there's nothing to eat.17 Think about it: where would you go to grab a bite in our solar system at present, outside of Earth? And a solar system is an absolute oasis compared to the vast interstellar void. The two factors that jointly

Box 4.3: Accomplishments in Space 
Before turning attention to what we have not yet done in space, students may appreciate a recap of progress to date. The list is by no means exhaustive, but geared to set straight common misconceptions. 
► 1957: Sputnik (Soviet) is the first satellite to orbit Earth. 
1959: Luna 3 (Soviet; unmanned) reaches the moon in a fly-by. 
► 1961: Yuri Gagarin (Soviet), first in space, orbits Earth once. 
► 1965: Alexei Leonov (Soviet) performs the first "space walk." 1965: Mariner 4 (U.S.; unmanned) reaches Mars. 
► 1968: Apollo 8 (U.S.) puts humans in lunar orbit for the first time. 
► 1969: Apollo 11 (U.S.) puts the first humans onto the lunar surface. 
► Pause here to appreciate how fast all this happened. It is easy to see why people would assume that Mars would be colonized within 50 years. Attractive narratives are hard to retire, even when wrong. 
1972: Apollo 17 (U.S.) is the last human mission to the moon; only 12 people have walked on another solar system body, the last about 50 years ago. 
► 1973-now: as of this writing (2020), humans have not ventured farther than about 600 km from Earth's surface (called low earth orbit, or LEO; see Figure 4.4) since the end of the Apollo missions. 
► 1981-2011: U.S. operates the Space Shuttle, envisioned to make space travel routine. After 135 launches (two ending in catastro- phe), the shuttle was retired, leaving the U.S. with no human space launch capacity. 
‣ 1998-now: The International Space Station (ISS) [30] provides an experimental platform and maintains a presence in space. It is only 400 km from Earth's surface (4-hour driving distance), and despite its misleading name is not used as a space-port hub for travel. It is the destination.

One "win" some imagine from space is access to materials. Yet Earth is already well- stocked with elements from the Periodic Table, and the economics of retrieval from space are prohibitive in any case.

4.3 A Host of Difficulties 
If undeterred by the vast emptiness, hostile conditions, or lack of human- supporting resources in space, then maybe it's because you believe

human ingenuity can overcome these challenges. And this is correct to a degree. We have walked on one other solar system body.18 We have had individuals spend a year or so in earth orbit. Either these represent first baby steps to a space future, or just rare feats that we can pull off at great effort/expense. How can we tell the difference? 
Box 4.4: Comparison to Backpacking 
The way most people experience backpacking is similar to how we go about space exploration: carry on your back all the food, clothing, shelter, and utility devices that will be needed for a finite trip duration. Only air and water are acquired in the wild. For space travel, even the air and water must be launched from Earth. So space travel is like a glorified and hyper-expensive form of backpacking—albeit offering breathtaking views!. 
One way to probe the demonstration vs. way-of-the-future question is to list capabilities we have not yet demonstrated in space that would be important for a space livelihood, including: 
1. Growing food used for sustenance; 
2. Surviving long periods outside of Earth's magnetic protection 
from cosmic rays;1 
3. Generating or collecting propulsive fuel away from Earth's surface; 4. Long-term health of muscles and bones for periods longer than a 
year in low gravity environments; 
5. Resource extraction for in-situ construction materials; 6. Closed-system sustainable ecosystem maintenance; 7. Anything close to terraforming (see below). 
It would be easier to believe in the possibility of space colonization if we first saw examples of colonization of the ocean floor.20 Such an environ- ment carries many similar challenges: native environment unbreathable; large pressure differential; sealed-off self-sustaining environment. But an ocean dwelling has several major advantages over space, in that food is scuttling/swimming just outside the habitat; safety/air is a short distance away (meters); ease of access (swim/scuba vs. rocket); and all the resources on Earth to facilitate the construction/operation (e.g., Home Depot not far away). 
Building a habitat on the ocean floor would be vastly easier than trying to do so in space. It would be even easier on land, of course. But we have not yet successfully built and operated a closed ecosystem on land! A few artificial "biosphere" efforts have been attempted, but met with failure [31]. If it is not easy to succeed on the surface of the earth, how can we fantasize about getting it right in the remote hostility of space, lacking easy access to manufactured resources?

18: The last Apollo landing was in 1972. 
19: The ISS (space station) remains within Earth's protection. 
20: Even just 10 meters under the surface! 
This is not to advocate ocean floor habi- tation as a good idea; it is merely used to illustrate that space habitation is an even less practical idea, by far.

2022 T. W. Murphy, Jr.; Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International Lic.; Freely available at: https://escholarship.org/uc/energy_ambitions.On the subject of terraforming, consider this perspective. Earth right now has a problem of excess CO2 as a result of fossil fuel combustion (the subject of Chapter 9). The problem has flummoxed our economic and political systems, so that not only do we seem to be powerless to revert to pre-industrial CO2 levels, but even arresting the annual increase in emissions appears to be beyond our means. Pre-industrial levels of CO2 measured 280 parts per million (ppm) of the atmosphere, which we will treat as the normal level. Today's levels exceed 400 ppm, so that the modification is a little more than 100 ppm, or 0.01% of our atmosphere.21 Meanwhile, Mars' atmosphere is 95% CO2. So we might say that Earth has a 100 ppm problem, but Mars has essentially a million part-per- million problem. On Earth, we are completely stymied by a 100 ppm 
CO2 increase while enjoying access to all the resources available to us on the planet. Look at all the infrastructure available on this developed world and still we have not been able to reverse or even stop the CO2 increase. How could we possibly see transformation of Mars' atmosphere into habitable form as realistic, when Mars has zero infrastructure to support such an undertaking? We must be careful about proclaiming notions to be impossible, but we can be justified in labeling them as outrageously impractical, to the point of becoming a distraction to discuss. Figure 4.5 further illustrates the giant gap between tolerable conditions and actual atmospheres on offer in the solar system. 
We also should recall the lesson from Chapter 1 about exponential growth, and how the addition of another habitat had essentially no effect on the overall outcome, aside from delaying by one short doubling time. Therefore, even if it is somehow misguided to discount colonization of another solar system body, who cares? We still do not avoid the primary challenge facing humanity as growth slams into limitations in a finite world (or even finite solar system, if it comes to that). 
4.4 Exploration's Role 
It is easy to understand why people might latch onto the idea that we will likely leverage our exploration of space into ultimate colonization. Much as early explorers of our planet opened pathways for colonization of "new worlds," the parallels in exploring literal new worlds like planets are obvious.22 In short, it is a familiar story, and therefore an easy "sell" to primed, undoubting minds. Plus, we're captivated by the novelty and challenge space colonization represents as attested by a vibrant entertainment industry devoted to stories of eventual life in space. But not all exploration leads to settlement, and entertainment is not truth. 
Humans have explored (a small portion of) the crushing deep ocean, scaled Earth's highest and wholly inhospitable peaks, and visited the harsh ice cap at the north pole. In such instances, we had zero intention of establishing permanent residence in those locations. They represented 
4 Space Colonization 61 
Terraforming is the speculative idea of trans- forming a planet so its atmosphere resem- bles that of Earth (chemical makeup, tem- perature, pressure) and can support human life. 
21: While the increase from 280 to 400 is about 50%, as a fraction of Earth's total atmosphere, the 100 ppm change is 100 divided by one million (from definition of ppm), or 0.01%.

of "comfort" for Earth is shown as a blue rectangle going from -10°C to 40°C and 0.2 atm (where the atmosphere would need to be 100% oxygen) to (arbitrarily) 10 atm. Not only are the other bodies far outside our comfort range, the composi- tions are noxious, and lack oxygen. Bear in mind that a change of even a few degrees- as in climate change is a big deal. Even Mt. Everest, where humans can survive for only a few hours with supplemental oxygen is substantially more hospitable than Mars. 
22: Reaching the Americas involved a leap across a span of (life-supporting) ocean about twice the size of Europe. Reaching Mars involves a leap across inhospitable space 5,000 times the diameter of Earth- not very similar at all.

4 Space Colonization 62 
places to test our toughness and also learn about new environments. We do not view these sorts of explorations as mistakes just because they did not pave the way for inhabitation. Rather, we speak fondly of such excursions as feathers in our collective cap: feats that make us proud as a species. Space might be viewed in a similar way: superlative in terms of challenge and wonderment, reflecting positively on our curiosity, drive, ingenuity, and teamwork. We also derive benefits23 in the way of technological advancement propelled by our quest to explore, and in furthering our scientific understanding of nature. 
So even if space does not fulfill the fantasy of continued human expansion across the cosmos, it is in our nature to at least explore it. We would do well to put space exploration in the category of conquering Mt. Everest rather than that of Europeans stumbling upon the West Indies (one is as imminently uninhabitable as the other is inhabitable). Let us not make the mistake of applying the wrong narrative to space. 
Many positive things might be said about space exploration, and hope- fully we continue poking into our outer environment indefinitely. Yet hoping that such exploration is a pathway to human colonization of space is probably wrong and almost certainly counterproductive at present, given the short timescale on which human expansion is likely to collide with Earth's limits. 
If, in the fullness of time, we do see a path toward practical space colonization, then fine. But given the extreme challenge and cost- both energetically and economically, and for what could only be a tiny footprint in the near term-it seems vastly more prudent to take care of our relationship with Planet Earth first, and then think about space colonization in due time, if it ever makes sense. Otherwise, not only do we spend precious resources unwisely, but (even worse) our mindset is tainted by unrealistic dreams that diminish the importance of confronting the real challenge right here on the ground. We need to have our heads in the real game. Perhaps twenty one pilots said it best in the song Stressed Out: 
We used to play pretend, give each other different names We would build a rocket ship and then we'd fly it far away 
Used to dream of outer space but now they're laughing at our face Saying, "Wake up, you need to make money." Yeah. 
Space colonization might be treated as a pretend fantasy for the moment. We would be better off waking up to face real here-and-now challenges. In some sense, perhaps the only way to achieve the dream of migration to space should that be in the cards at all-is to first pretend that it is impossible and turn attention to the pressing matters on Earth. Otherwise we risk failing at both efforts. 
23: 
among them a deeper appreciation for the rare and precious Earth 
Despite the pessimistic tone of this chapter, the author is himself captivated by space, and has built a life around it: Star Wars was a transformative influence as a kid, and later Star Trek. The movie The Right Stuff is still a favorite. He has peered to the edge of the universe first through a 10-inch tele- scope he built in high school, and later us- ing the largest telescopes in the world. He has worked on a Space Shuttle experiment, met astronauts, knew Sally Ride, and spent much of his career building and operating a laser system to bounce and detect indi- vidual photons off the reflectors placed on the lunar surface by the Apollo astronauts (as a test of the fundamental nature of grav- ity), which directly inspired part of a Big Bang Theory episode via personal interac- tions with the show's writers. So a deep fondness for space? Yes. Would volunteer to go to the moon or Mars? Yes. Believes it holds the key to humanity's future? No.

Box 4.5: Q&A on State of Exploration 
After reading the first draft of this chapter, students had a number of remaining questions. Here are some of them, along with the author's 
responses. 
1. How long before we live on other planets? 
Maybe never.24 The staggering distances involved mean that our own solar system is effectively the only option. Within the solar system, Mars is the most hospitable body-meaning we might live as long as two minutes without life support. By com- parison, Antarctica and the ocean floor are millions of times more practical, yet we do not see permanent settlements there.25 
2. What is the status of searches for other planets to colonize? 
We understand our solar system pretty well. No second homes stand out. We have detected evidence for thousands of planets around other stars [32], but do not yet have the sensitivity to detect the presence of earth-like rocks around most stars. It is conceivable that we will have identified Earth analogs in the coming decades, but they will give new meaning to the words "utterly" and "inaccessible." 
3. Haven't we benefited from space exploration in the technology 
spin-offs, like wireless headsets and artificial limbs? 
No doubt! The benefits have been numerous, and I would never characterize our space efforts to date as wasted effort. It's just that what we have done so far in space does not mean that colonization is in any way an obvious or practical next step. Actually, the banner image for this chapter from the Apollo 8 mission captivated the world and made our fragile shell of life seem all the more precious. So perhaps the biggest benefit to our space exploration will turn out to be a profound appreciation for and attachment to Earth! 
24: True, never is a long time. The notion that we may never colonize space may seem preposterous to you now. Check back at the end of the book. The odds favor a more boring slog, grappling with our place in 
nature. 
25: Staffed research stations are not the same as human settlements, in the case of Antarctica.

4.5 Upshot: Putting Earth First 
The author might even go so far as to label a focus on space colonization in the face of more pressing challenges as disgracefully irresponsible. Diverting attention in this probably-futile26 effort could lead to greater total suffering if it means not only mis-allocation of resources but perhaps 
26: ... at least on relevant time scales

more importantly lulling people into a sense that space represents a viable 
escape hatch. Let's not get distracted! 
The fact that we do not have a collective global agreement on priorities or the role that space will (or will not) play in our future only highlights the fact that humanity is not operating from a master plan27 that has been well thought out. We're simply "winging it," and as a result potentially wasting our efforts on dead-end ambitions. Just because some people are enthusiastic about a space future does not mean that it can or will happen. 
It is true that we cannot know for sure what the future holds, but perhaps that is all the more reason to play it safe and not foolishly pursue a high-risk fantasy.28 From this point on, the book will turn to issues more tangibly relevant to life and success on Planet Earth. 
Box 4.6: Survey Says? 
It would be fascinating to do a survey to find out how many people think that we will have substantial populations living off Earth 500 years from now. It is the author's sense that a majority of Americans believe this to be likely. Yet, if such a future is not to be for a host of practical reasons, including the possibility that we falter badly and are no longer in a position to pursue space flight-we would find ourselves in a situation where most people may be completely wrong about the imagined future. That would be a remarkable state of affairs in which to find ourselves-though not entirely surprising. 
4 Space Colonization 64 
27: Prospects for a plan are discussed in Chapter 19. 
28: Tempted as we may be by the e-mail offer from the displaced Nigerian prince to help move his millions of dollars to a safe account, most of us know better than to bite. The promise of wealth can lead the gullible to ruin. 
4.6 Problems 
1. If the sun were the size of a basketball, how large would Earth be, and how far away? How large would the moon be, and how far from Earth, at this scale? 
2. Find objects whose sizes approximately match the scales found in Problem 1 and place them in your environment at the scaled/a ap- propriate distances. Submit a personalized/unique picture of your arrangement. 
3. How far would the nearest star be at the scale from Problem 1, and 
how big is this in relation to familiar objects? 
4. Find an Earth globe and an object about one-fourth its size to represent the moon, then place at the appropriate distance apart. Report on how far this is. Take a personalized/unique picture to document, and take some time appreciating how big Earth would look from the moon. 
This kind of exercise might seem like a hassle, but it can really help internalize the scales in a way words never will. 
By doing this, you can get maybe 2% of the enjoyment of a trip to the moon for less than one-billionth the cost: a real bargain! Can you make out Florida? Japan?

5. Highway 6563 in New Mexico has signs along a roughly 30 km stretch of road corresponding to the solar system scale from the Sun to Neptune. On this scale, how large would Earth, Sun, and Jupiter be, in diameter? Express in convenient units appropriate to the scale. 
6. Using the setup in Problem 5, how fast would you have to travel on the road to match the speed of light, for which it takes 500 seconds to go from Earth to the sun? Express in familiar/convenient units. 
7. Note that the size of the moon in Figure 4.1 is about the same size as the sun in Figure 4.2. Explain how this is related to the fact that they appear to be about the same size in our sky. Hint: imagine putting your eye at the earth location in each figure and looking at the other body. 
8. Use Table 4.1 to accumulate (multiplicatively combine) scale factors and ask: which is a bigger ratio: the distance to the nearest star compared to the diameter of Earth, or the distance to the edge of the universe compared to that to the nearest star? Compared to the large numbers we are dealing with, is one much smaller or much bigger than the other, or are they roughly the same? 
9. It may be tempting to compare Earth to a life-sustaining oasis in the desert-maybe spanning 100 m. But this is a pretty misleading view. One way to demonstrate this is to consider that in a real desert, the next oasis might be a perilous 100 km journey away. Using the ratio of distance to size (diameter of planet or oasis), how close would another Earth have to be (and compare your answer to other solar system scales) to hold the analogy?29 How long would it take to drive this distance? Do we have another oasis or potential oasis within this distance? 
30 
10. Another way to cast Problem 9 is to imagine that the actual distance between Earth and a comparable oasis is more like the distance between stars. In this case, how far would the next oasis be in the desert if we again compare the 100 m scale of the oasis to the diameter of the Earth?31 How long would it take to drive between oases at freeway speeds (cast in the most informative/intuitive units)? 
11. On the eighth bullet of Box 4.3 (the one that asks you to pause), imagine someone from the year 2020 traveling back 50 years and explaining that we have not been to the moon since 1972, and that Americans get to space on Russian rockets. How believable do you think they would be, and what assumptions might be made to reconcile the shock? 
12. Prior to exposure to this material, what would you honestly have said in response to: How far have humans been from the planet in 
4 Space Colonization 65 
This is why eclipses are special on Earth. 
29: In other words, oasis size is to distance between oases as Earth's diameter is to how far? 
30:...since Earth is the only livable "oasis" in our own solar system 
31: In other words, Earth diameter is to interstellar distances as a 100 m oasis is to how far? 
The insight you develop will not depend on exact choices for distance and speed, as long as they are reasonable.

17. Come up with three examples (not repeating items in the text) of 
feats that are technically possible, but not common or practical. 
18. For some perspective, imagine you were able to drive your car up a ramp to an altitude characteristic of low-earth orbit (about 320 km, or 200 miles). It takes about 5 x 1010 J of energy33 to win the fight against gravity. Meanwhile, each gallon of gasoline can do about 25 x 106 J of useful work. How many gallons would it take to climb to orbital height in a car? Roughly how many miles per gallon is this (just counting vertical miles)? 
19. In Problem 18, we ignored the energy required to provide the substantial orbital speed (~ 8 km/s, but will not need), which essentially doubles the total energy.34 How much gasoline will it now take, and how massive is the fuel if gasoline is 3 kg per gallon, compared to the 1,500 kg mass of the car?

32:...just in terms of temperature and pressure; ignoring composition and a host of other considerations! 
33: We'll encounter gravitational potential energy later, but this quantity is computed as mgh with m≈1,500 kg. 
34: The same amount of energy to climb against gravity must go into accelerating to speed (kinetic energy). 
Given this mass of fuel, and its signifi- cance compared to the car's mass, we can see that we've underestimated the fuel re- quired since we'll have to put substantial additional energy into lifting the fuel away from the earth.
