ESTIMATED YEARLY ENERGY USE 
YOUR COST WILL DEPEND ON YOUR UTLITY RATES AND USE 
This chapter provides a baseline for understanding the rest of the content in this book, so that students may learn to interpret and convert units, while building a useful intuition in the process. Sec. A.10 (p. 370) in the Appendices offers some tips on manipulating units and performing unit conversions. 
Unlike most chapters, this one does not tell a single story or advance our perspective on the world. But it builds a foundation, putting us in a position to start looking at consequential matters of energy use in our society in chapters to come. Hopefully, patience will be rewarded. 
5.1 Energy (J) 
First, what is energy? 
Definition 5.1.1 Energy is defined as the capacity to do work. Work is well-defined in physics as the application of force through a distance.1 The colloquial use of the word “work” matches relatively well, in that pushing a large couch across the floor (applying force through a distance) or lifting a heavy box up to a shelf feels like work and can tire you out. 
The SI unit of force is the Newton (N), breaking down more fundamen- tally to kg m/s2. The best way to remember this is via Newton's Second Law: F = ma (force equals mass times acceleration). Mass has units of kg, and acceleration2 is measured in meters per second squared. 
Since work is force times distance, the unit for work (and thus energy) is Newtons times meters, or N. m. We give this unit its own name: the

1: This definition applies to the common circumstance when the motion is aligned with the direction of force, like pushing a box across a level floor, propelling a car along the road, or lifting a weight. 
2: Acceleration is the rate of change of ve- locity. Since velocity is measured in meters per second, the rate at which it changes will be meters per second per second, or m/s/s, or m/s2. Some students may know that gravitational acceleration on Earth's surface is 9.8 m/s2, which is another way to remember.

Joule (J). Thus, the application of 1 N of force across a distance of 1 m constitutes 1 J of work, requiring 1J of energy to perform. Table 5.1 offers contextual examples (unit prefixes are on page 420). 
Example 5.1.1 Several examples3 illustrate force times distance, the first two amounting to one Joule of energy: 
► Pushing a book across a table, applying 2 N of force and sliding it 0.5 m amounts to 1 J of work. 
► Pushing a matchbox toy car across the floor might require only 0.1 N of force. One would have to push it through a distance of 10 m to make up one Joule of energy. 
A car on level ground may require 150 N of force to roll against friction. Pushing a car 5 m would then require 750 J of work. 
Writing out Newtons as kg m/s2, we find that the unit of energy amounts to J = Nm = kg m2/s2. Notice that this looks like mass times velocity-squared. Box 5.1 explores how this makes a lot of sense. 
Box 5.1: The Units Make Sense! 
Think about the famous equation E = mc2. Energy is mass times the speed of light squared. The units work! 
Also, kinetic energy is K.E. = mv2, telling a similar story in terms of units: mass times velocity-squared. 
Gravitational potential energy is just the weight of an object times the height it is lifted through. The weight (force) is mass (m) times the acceleration due to gravity (g), so that lifting (applying a force equal to the weight) through a height (h) results in a potential energy gain of P.E. = mgh. The units again check out as

Sec. A.10 (p. 370) in the Appendices pro- vides additional guidance on manipulating units. 
We'll encounter other ways to describe energy in this book, but any energy unit can always be cast into units of Joules, if desired. Later sections in this chapter detail alternative units whose acquaintance we must make in order to interpret energy information in our lives. 
5.2 Energy Forms and Conservation 
Energy manifests in a variety of forms, which we will treat in greater detail in application-specific chapters in Part III of this text. For now we just want to name them and point to related chapters and applications, as is done in Table 5.2.

Table 5.2: Energy forms. Exchange is possi- ble between all forms. Chemical energy is represented here by Gibbs free energy. 
A bedrock principle of physics is conservation of energy, which we take to never be violated in any system, ever. What this means is that energy can flow from one form to another, but it is never created or destroyed. 
Box 5.2: Energy: The Money of Physics 
A decent way to conceptualize energy conservation is to think of it as the money of physics. It may change hands, but is not created or destroyed in the exchange. A large balance in a bank account is like a potential energy: available to spend. Converting to another form-like heat or kinetic energy-is like the act of spending money. The rate of spending energy is called power. 
Example 5.2.1 traces a few familiar energy conversions, and Figure 5.1 provides an example illustration. A more encompassing narrative connecting cosmic sources to daily use is provided in Sec. D.2.2 (p. 395). 
Example 5.2.1 Various illustrative examples: 
► A rock perched on the edge of a cliff has gravitational potential energy. When it is pushed off, it trades its potential energy for kinetic energy (speed) as it races toward the ground. 
▸ A pendulum continually exchanges kinetic and potential energy, which can last some time in the absence of frictional influences. 
► A stick of dynamite has energy stored in chemical bonds (a form of potential energy). When ignited, the explosive material becomes very hot in a small fraction of a second, converting chemical energy into thermal energy. 
The fireball of hot material from the exploding dynamite ex- pands rapidly, pushing air and nearby objects out of the way at high speed, thus converting thermal energy into kinetic energy. 
► Light from the sun (photons) hits a black parking lot surface, heating it up as light energy is converted to thermal energy. 
► A uranium nucleus splits apart, releasing nuclear (potential) energy, sending the particles flying off at high speed (kinetic energy). These particles bump into surrounding particles trans- ferring kinetic energy into thermal energy. 
Thermal energy from burning a fossil fuel or from nuclear fission 
6: The only exception is on cosmological scales and times. But across scales even as large as the Milky Way galaxy and over millions of years, we are on solid footing to consider conservation of energy to be inviolate. It is fascinating to note that con- servation of energy stems from a symmetry in time itself: if the laws and constants of the Universe are the same across some span of time, then energy is conserved during such time a concept we trace to Emmy Noether. See Sec. D.2 (p. 393) for more.

Figure 5.1: Example exchange of potential energy (P.E.) into kinetic energy (K.E.) as an apple drops from a tree. The total en- ergy always adds to the same amount (here 7 J). The apple speeds up as it gains kinetic energy (losing potential energy). When it comes to rest on the ground, the energy will have gone into 7 J of heat (the associated temperature rise is too small to notice).

Any of the forms of energy (e.g., in Table 5.2) can convert into the other, directly or indirectly. In each conversion, 100% of the energy is accounted for. In the general case, the energy branches into multiple paths, so we do not get 100% efficiency into the channel we want. For instance, the pendulum example above will eventually bleed its energy into stirring the air (kinetic energy) and friction (heat) at the pivot point. The stirring air eventually turns to heat via internal (viscous) friction of the air. 
One useful clarification is that thermal energy is really just random motions-kinetic energy-of individual atoms and molecules. So in the case of nuclear fission in Example 5.2.1, the initial kinetic energy of the nuclear fragments is already thermal in nature, but at a higher temperature (faster speeds) than the surrounding material. By bumping into surrounding atoms, the excess speed is diffused into the medium, raising its temperature while "cooling" the fragments themselves as they are slowed down. 
8 
If accounting for all the possible paths of energy, we are confident that they always add up. Nothing is lost. Energy is never created or destroyed in any process we study. It just sloshes from one form to another, often branching into multiple parallel avenues. The sum total will always add up to the starting amount. Sec. D.2.3 (p. 396) provides a supplement for those interested in better understanding where energy ultimately goes, and why "losing energy to heat" is not actually a loss but just another reservoir for energy. 
5.3 Power (W) 
Before getting to the various common units for energy, we should absorb the very important concept and units of power. 
Definition 5.3.1 Power is simply defined as energy per time: how much energy is expended in how much time. The SI unit is therefore J/s, which we rename Watts (W). 
While energy is the capacity to do work, it says nothing about how quickly that work might be accomplished. Power addresses the rate at which energy is expended. Figure 5.2 provides a sense of typical power levels of familiar animals and appliances. 
Example 5.3.1 Lifting a 10 kg box, whose weight is therefore about 100 N, through a vertical distance of 2 m requires about 200 J of energy. If performed in one second, the task requires 200 W (200 Joules in one second). Stretching the same task out over four seconds requires only 50 W. 
5 Energy and Power Units

The differences between kinetic and ther- mal energy is about coherence, in that we characterize the kinetic energy of a raindrop by its bulk motion or velocity. Meanwhile, water molecules within the drop are zipping about in random directions and at very high speeds exceeding 1,000 meters per second. 
7: 
sometimes called channels 
8: Actually, the principle is so well estab- lished that new particles (like the neutrino) have been discovered by otherwise unac- counted energy in nuclear processes. 
One Watt is simply one Joule per second. 
Weight is mg. In this case, m is 10 kg. If we're being sticklers, g = 9.8 m/s2, but for con- venience we can typically use g≈ 10 m/s2 without significant loss of precision.

Orange entries are per-capita totals for societal (non-metabolic) energy use. Note that appliances whose job it is to create heat demand the greatest power. The "heating appliance" entry stands for things like microwave ovens, toaster ovens, space heaters, or hair dryers plugged into electrical outlets. Do not take the numbers provided as definitive or exact, as almost everything in the figure will vary somewhat from one instance to another. 
Of course, we commonly apply the usual multipliers of factors of 103 to the unit to make it more useful. Thus we have the progression W, KW, MW, GW, TW, etc. For reference, a large college campus will require several tens of MW (megawatts) for electricity. A large power plant is typically in the 1-4 GW range. See Table 5.3 for scales at which we are likely to use the various multiplying factors, and a more complete set of multipliers on page 420. 
Although it won't come up too often in this course, it is worth mentioning that the common unit of horsepower equates to 745.7 W. Thus a 100 hp car is capable of delivering about 75 kW of power. 
5.4 Kilowatt-hour (kWh) 
Definition 5.4.1 The kilowatt-hour is an amount of energy (not a power) resulting from an expenditure of energy at a rate of 1 kW for a duration of one hour, and is the unit of choice for residential electricity usage. 
This unit causes no end of confusion, but it's really pretty straightforward. The kilowatt-hour is a kilowatt times an hour. Thus it is power multiplied by time, which is energy (since power is energy over time). 
Example 5.4.1 Let's say you plug in a space heater rated at 1,000 W (1 kW) and run it for one hour. Congratulations-you've just spent 1 kWh. 
Or maybe you turn on a 100 W incandescent light bulb (0.1 kW) and leave it on for 10 hours: also 1 kWh! 
What if you run a 500 W rice cooker (0.5 kW) for half an hour? That's 0.25 kWh.

It is straightforward to convert back to Joules, because 1 kW is 1,000 J/s and one hour is 3,600 s. So 1 kWh is 1 kW times 1 hr, which is 1,000 J/s times 3,600 s, and is therefore equal to 3,600,000 J, or 3.6 MJ. A related measure sometimes comes up: the watt-hour (Wh). In much the same vein, this is equivalent to 1 J/s for 3,600 seconds, or 3,600 J.9 
Box 5.3: Don't be one of those people... 
If you ever hear someone say "kilowatts per hour,” it's likely a mistake,10 and has the side effect of leading people to erroneously think that kilowatts is a unit of energy, not a power. Kilowatts is already a rate (speed) of energy use: 1,000 Joules per second. 
One tendency some people have is to mix up kW and kWh.11 Kilowatts is a unit of power, or how fast energy is being used. Think of it like a speedometer: how fast are you moving (through space or energy)? Kilowatt-hours is a multiplication of power times time, becoming an energy. It's more like the odometer: how much have you accumulated (distance or energy)? Just like distance is rate (speed) times time, energy is rate (power) times time. 
Example 5.4.2 We will explore kWh using a light bulb for an example. Let's say the light bulb is labeled as 100 W.12 How much energy does 
it use? 
Well, it depends on how long it's on. If it is never turned on, it uses no energy. If it is on for 10 seconds, it uses far less than if it's on for a day. 
The characteristic quality of the light bulb is the power it expends when it's on-in this case 100 W. It only has one speed. In analogy to a car and speedometer, it's similar to saying that a car travels at a constant speed,13 and asking how far it travels. Well, it depends on how much time it spends traveling at speed. 
So view kWh (energy) as an accumulated amount that increases with time. On the other hand, kW is a rate of energy expenditure.

5.5 Calories (kcal) 
A common unit for describing chemical and thermal processes is the calorie and its siblings. 
Definition 5.5.1 A calorie is defined as the amount of energy it takes to heat one gram of water (thus also 1 mL, or 1 cm3, or 1 cc) by one degree Celsius (Figure 5.3). One calorie (note the small "c") is 4.184 J of energy. 
One Calorie (note the capital "C")14 is 1,000 calories, or 1 kilocalorie 
14: This might win the prize for the dumb- est convention in science: never define a unit as case-sensitive, as it cannot be differ- entiated in spoken language! 
2022 T. W. Murphy, Jr.; Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International Lic.; Freely available at: https://escholarship.org/uc/energy_ambitions. 
(1 kcal), equating to 4,184 J. Most memorably, it is the amount of energy it takes to heat one kilogram (or one liter; 1 L) of water by 1°C. Due to the tragic convention of Calorie, we will opt for kcal whenever possible. 
Food labels in the U.S. are in Calories, describing the energy content of the food we eat.15 We would all do ourselves a favor by calling these kcal instead of Calories (same thing). Many other countries sensibly use either kJ or kcal for quantifying food energy.

1 cm3 = 1 mL = 1 g 
70°C 
Example 5.5.1 To change 30 mL (30 g) of water by 5°C requires 150 cal, or a little over 600 J. 
Injecting 40 kcal of energy into a 2 L (2 kg) bottle of water will heat it by 20 degrees. 
Drinking 250 mL of ice-cold water and heating it up to body tempera- ture (thus raising its temperature by approximately 35 degrees) will take about 8,750 cal, or 8.75 kcal, or a bit over 36 kJ of 
energy. 
It is usually sufficient to remember that the conversion factor between calories and Joules is about 4.2-or just 4 if performing a crude calcula- tion. 
5 Energy and Power Units 
74 
15: Human metabolism is not the same as heating water, but the energy involved can still be counted in an energy unit that is defined in terms of heating water. It's still just energy. 
Figure 5.3: Following the definition of a calorie, adding 50 cal to one gram of water raises its temperature by 50°C. 
No deep significance attaches to the fact that 1 cal happens to equate to 4.184 J, other than to say this describes a property of water (called specific heat capacity). 
1 cal = 
1 kcal 
= 
4.184 J 4,184 J 
4.2 J 
4J 
4.2 kJ 
4 kJ 
Two examples will help cement use of the kcal (a more useful scale in this class than the much smaller calorie). 
Example 5.5.2 A typical diet amounts to a daily intake of about 2,000 kcal of food energy. If you think about it, 2,000 kcal/day is a power (energy per time). We can convert to Watts by changing kcal to J and one day to seconds. 2,000 kcal is 8.368 MJ. One day has 86,400 seconds. The division of the two is very close to 100 W.16 
A second example hews closely to the definition of the kcal: heating 
water. 
Example 5.5.3 Let's say you want to heat a half-liter (0.5 kg) of water from room temperature (20°C) to boiling (100°C). Since each kcal can heat 1 kg by 1°C, that same energy will raise our half-kg by 2°C.17 So raising the temperature by 80°C will require 40 kcal, or 167 kJ. 
If the water is heated at a rate of 1,000 W (1,000 J/s), it would take 167 seconds for the water to reach boiling temperature. 
Notice that we did not apply an explicit formula in Example 5.5.3. By proceeding stepwise, we attempt to keep it intuitive. We could write a

16: It would serve little purpose to perform exact math here-producing 96.85 W in this case since the idea that someone's daily diet is exactly 2,000.00 kcal is pretty preposterous. It will likely vary by at least 10% from day to day, and by even larger amounts from individual to individual, so that 100 W is a convenient and approximate representation. 
17: Make sure this is clear to you; by under- standing, we are installing concepts instead of formulas, which are more powerful and lasting. 
Appendix Sec. A.8 (p. 368) addresses this philosophy in a bit more detail. 
formula, but we implicitly create the formula on the fly by recognizing that the amount of energy required should scale with the mass of water and with the amount of temperature increase. Hopefully, this approach leads to a deeper understanding of the concept, while printing a formula on the page might short-circuit comprehension.

This would be an excellent oppor- tunity to create your own formula to capture the idea, like an expert! 
5.6 British Thermal Unit (Btu) 
Why would we waste our time talking about the arcane British thermal unit (Btu)? It's because data provided by the U.S. Energy Information Administration on global energy use is based on the Btu. More specifically, country-scale annual energy expenditures are measured in units of quadrillion (1015) Btu (see Box 5.4). Also, heating appliances in the U.S.18 are rated in Btu/hour-a unit of power that can be converted to Watts. 
Definition 5.6.1 The Btu is the Imperial analog to the kcal.19 One Btu is the energy required to heat one pound of water one degree Fahrenheit. 
In terms of Joules, 1 Btu is about 1,055 J, or not far from 1 kJ. 
We can make sense of the conversion to Joules in the following way: a pound is roughly half a kilogram and one degree Fahrenheit is approxi- mately half a degree Celsius. So a Btu should be roughly a quarter of a kcal. Indeed, 1,055 J is close to one quarter of 4,184 J. 
Box 5.4: Quads: qBtu 
The U.S. uses quadrillion Btu to represent country-scale annual energy expenditures. It is denoted as qBtu, or informally "quads." One qBtu is approximately 1018 J.20 
The U.S. uses about 100 quads per year. Since a year is about 3.16×107 seconds,21 dividing energy in Joules by time in seconds tells us that the U.S. power is about 3 x 1012 W (3 TW), working out to about 10,000 W per person as a per-capita rate of energy use. 
Example 5.6.1 For appliances characterized by Btu/hr, we can relate to power in Watts via 1 Btu/hr as 1,055 J per 3,600 s, working out to 0.293 W. 
Thus, a hot water heater rated at 30,000 Btu/hr is effectively 8,800 W. 
Let's also pause to understand how long it will take to heat a shower's worth of hot water at this rate. We'll do it two ways: 
1. Heating 15 gallons22 (125 pounds) from a cool 68°F to a hot 131°F at 30,000 Btu/hr will take how long? We must put in 
We need to cover the unit in this chapter in order to be energy-literate in the U.S., and because it will come up later in this book.

19: Recall that 1 kcal is the energy it takes to heat one kilogram of water by 1°C. 
20: 1.055 x 1018 J, more precisely. 
21: A cute and convenient way to remember this, approximately, is л x 107 seconds per 
year. 
22: Typical shower flow is about 2 gallons, or ~8 L, per minute.

125 × 63 = 7,900 Btu of energy at a rate of 30,000 Btu/hr, so it will take 7,900/30,000 of an hour, or just over 15 minutes. 2. In metric terms, the equivalent to 15 gallons is 57 L (57 kg), and we heat from 20°C to 55°C at 8,800 W.23 Since one kcal heats one kilogram of water 1°C, heating 57 kg by 35°C will require 57 x 35 kcal, or 57 x 35 x 4, 184J = 8.35 MJ, which at 8,800 W will take 950 seconds, also just over 15 minutes (reassuringly, the same answer). 
5.7 Therms 
We will rarely encounter this unit, but include it here because natural gas utility bills24 in the U.S. often employ Therms. Since part of the goal of this book is to empower a personal understanding of energy and how to compare different measures of energy (e.g., on a utility bill), conventions in the U.S. demand that we cover the unit here.25 
Definition 5.7.1 One Therm is 100,000 Btu, or 1.055 x 108 J, or 29.3 kWh. 
Box 5.5: Why Therms? 
The Therm is partly adopted for the near-convenience that 100 cubic feet of natural gas (CCF or 100 CF), which meters measure directly, equates to 1.036 Therms. Relatedly, one gallon (3.785 L) of liquid propane gas26 contains 91,500 Btu, which is 0.915 Therms. Thus the Therm very closely matches convenient measures of natural gas (100 cubic feet) or liquid propane (a gallon). 
Example 5.7.1 It might take approximately 10,000 kcal of energy27 to heat a fresh infusion of cold water into a hot water heater tank. How many Therms is this? 
We do a two-step conversion: first, 10,000 kcal is 41.84 MJ, which at 1,055 J per Btu computes to about 40,000 Btu, which is the same as 0.4 Therm, requiring approximately 40 cubic feet of natural gas, or a little less than half-a-gallon (about 2 L) of liquid propane. 
If we learn that the hot water heater is rated at 30,000 Btu per hour, it will take an hour and 20 minutes to complete the job. 
5 Energy and Power Units 76 
23: 30,000 Btu/hr is equivalent to 8,800 W, as worked out above. 
24: See, for instance, the banner image for this chapter on page 68. 
25: Chapter 20 will explore what might be learned from utility bills. 
26: Propane is often used in more remote lo- cations as a substitute for natural gas when the pipeline infrastructure for natural gas is absent. 
27: Based on a capacity of 200 L, pulling in chilly water at 5°C and heating it to 55°C, thereby requiring 200 kg x 50 C kcal. 
It is interesting to reflect on the notion that 200 L of water can be heated by 50°C for only 2 L of liquid fuel: 1% of the water vol- ume in fuel. If heating to boiling, it would take twice as much fuel, so 2% of the wa- ter volume. Seems like a good bargain- especially for backpackers who want to boil water and have to lug the fuel around to do so. Inefficiencies in getting heat into the water might require more like 10% fuel vol- 
ume. 
5.8 Electrical Power 
Electronic interactions are governed by charges pushing on each other. For the purposes of this course, we need only understand a few concepts. The first is voltage. 
2022 T. W. Murphy, Jr.; Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International Lic.; Freely available at: https://escholarship.org/uc/energy_ambitions. 
Voltage is a measure of electric potential, in Volts, and can be thought of as analogous to how high something is lifted.28 A higher voltage is like sitting higher on the shelf, and can do more work if allowed to be released. 
Charge is moved around by electrical forces, and the amount of charge moved plays a role similar to that of mass in gravitational settings. The unit of charge is the Coulomb (C), and the smallest unit of charge we encounter in normal situations is from the proton (+1.6 × 10-19 C) or the electron (-1.6 x 10-19 C). 
Definition 5.8.1 The amount of energy in a charge, q, at a voltage, V, is 
5 Energy and Power Units 
77 
28:... making electric potential a lot like gravitational potential energy in flavor 
E = qV. 
(5.1) 
One Coulomb of charge at a potential of 1 V has an energy of 1J. 
Current is the rate at which charge flows, and is usually symbolized by the letter I. Imagine setting up a toll booth in a conducting wire and counting how many charges (or how much cumulative charge) pass the gate per unit time. This gives rise to the Definition 5.8.2. 
Definition 5.8.2 Current is measured in Amps,29 which is defined as one Coulomb per second. 
Moving one Coulomb through one Volt every second would constitute one Joule of energy every second, which is the definition of one Watt. Putting the concepts of Definition 5.8.1 and Definition 5.8.2 together, we find ourselves able to define electrical power. 
Definition 5.8.3 Electrical power is simply current multiplied by voltage: 
P = IV. 
Current, I, is in Amps, and voltage, V is in Volts. 
(5.2) 
Example 5.8.1 Households in the U.S. often have circuit breakers allowing maximum currents of 15 or 20 Amps for regular power outlets. At a voltage of 120 V,30 this corresponds to a maximum power of 1,800 W or 2,400 W, respectively.31 
Finally, we are in a position to understand how much energy a battery will hold. Batteries are rated by two numbers: voltage, and charge capacity. Since current is charge per time, multiplying current and time results in just charge.32 Therefore, charge capacity in batteries is characterized as Amp-hours (Ah) or milli-amp-hours (mAh). Since Amps times Volts is Watts (Eq. 5.2), Amp-hours times Volts is Watt-hours, a familiar unit of energy 
from Section 5.4. 
29: Amperes, formally 
30: The alternating current nature is al- ready accommodated in this measure of voltage. 
31: Safety regulations limit continuous use to 80% of the breaker current capacity, so that realistically the limits are 1,400 W and 1,920 W, respectively. This is why "heating appliances" in Figure 5.2 top out around 1,500 W: circuit/safety limits. 
32: For example, 0.1 Amps (0.1 Coulombs per second) of current sustained for a dura- tion of 100 seconds results in 10 Coulombs of charge flow.

Example 5.8.2 A typical 9-volt battery has a capacity of 500 mAh. How much energy is this? 
500 mAh is 0.5 Ah. Multiplying by 9 V produces 4.5 Wh. Recall that 1 Wh is 1 J/s times 3,600 s (one hour), or 3,600 J. So 4.5 Wh is 16.2 kJ. 
How long can we power a 1 W LED array from this battery? We can go the long way (16.2 kJ divided by 1J/s) and say 16,200 seconds, or recognize that a 4.5 Wh battery can dispense 1 W for 4.5 hours. It's the same either way.

33: Approaching a problem from multiple directions provides validation and also pro- motes greater flexibility. 
5.9 Electron Volt (eV) 
The electron-volt (eV) is the unit of choice for energy at the atomic scale. This makes it ideal for discussing individual chemical bond strengths, the energy of individual photons of light emitted from atoms, and thermal energy per atom or molecule.34 We also use the eV for nuclear physics, but must increase the scale one million-fold and therefore speak of the mega-electron-volt, or MeV. 
We have already hit all the relevant concepts for understanding the eV in Section 5.8. The main reason to have its own section is so that it 
appears separately in the table of contents, making it easier to find and reference. The definition follows Definition 5.8.1 closely. 
Definition 5.9.1 One electron-volt is the energy associated with pushing one fundamental unit of electron charge, |e| = 1.6×10-19 Coulombs, through an electric potential of 1 V: 
1 eV = 1.6 × 10-19 C. 1V = 1.6 × 10-19 J 
(5.3) 
The electron-volt, at 1.6 x 10-19 J, is a tiny amount of energy. But it's just the right level for describing energetic processes for individual atoms. 
Example 5.9.1 When 12 grams of carbon (one mole, or 6x1023 atoms35) reacts with oxygen to form CO2, about 394 kJ of energy is released.36 How much energy is this per carbon atom in electron-volts? 
Since we have one mole, or 6 x 1023 carbon atoms, we divide our total energy (3.94 × 105 J) by the number of atoms to get 6.5 x 10-19 J per atom. This is just a bit larger than 1 eV (1.6 x 10-19 J), and the division leads to something very close to 4 eV per atom. 
Because CO2 has a total of four bonds between the carbon atom and the two oxygen atoms,37 we see that each bond accounts for about 1 eV. Chemical bonds are often in this range, highlighting the usefulness of the eV unit at the atomic level. 
34: Really, this is just the kinetic energy of the particle. 
35: See Appendix B for a primer/refresher on chemistry. 
36: Tables in chemistry books contain this type of information. 
37: Each carbon-to-oxygen link is a double bond, meaning that two electrons partici- pate in the link, for a total of four.

5.10 Light Energy 
Light energy and its spectrum will be explored more extensively in Chapter 13, but the main concepts are covered here for completeness. 
Light can be used to describe any part of the electromagnetic spectrum, from radio waves and microwaves, through infrared, visible, ultraviolet, and on to X-rays and gamma rays. Like atoms, light is "quantized" into smallest indivisible units-in this case particles called photons. An individual photon's energy is characteristic of its wavelength, A (Greek lambda), or frequency, v (Greek nu).3

where h = 6.626 × 10-34 J·s is Planck's constant and c≈ 3.0 × 108 m/s is the speed of light. 
Example 5.10.1 Visible light has a wavelength of 0.4-0.7 μm, sponding to 2.8-5.0x10-19 J for each photon. 
We also routinely express photon energy in electron-volts (eV) according to Definition 5.10.2.

Example 5.10.2 The red-end of the visible spectrum, around 0.7 μm, corresponds to photon energies around 1.8 eV, while the blue-end, around 0.4 μm, corresponds to 3.1 eV. 
5.11 Upshot on Units 
Every chapter has an upshot, usually distilling key lessons from the chapter or offering final thoughts. Such a treatment is not necessary here, although we could reinforce the idea that energy can always be expressed in Joules, or converted into any of the units described in the chapter. Also critical is the notion that energy is conserved-only exchanging from one form to another but never truly disappearing or coming from nowhere. 
Students may wish to see a master table of conversions between all the units discussed-and what a glorious table this would be! But it is intentionally left out for three reasons:

5.12 Problems 
1. A typical textbook may have a mass of 1 kg, and thus a weight of about 10 N. How high could the textbook be lifted (against the force of gravity) by supplying one Joule of energy? 
2. If you look in your "energy wallet" and only have 24 J of energy available to spend, how far can you expect to slide an empty box across the floor if it takes 6 N of force to move it along? 
3. A 50 kg crate might require 200 N to slide across a concrete floor. If we must slide it 10 m along the floor and then lift it 2 m into a truck, how much energy goes into each action, and what fraction of the total energy expenditure is each? 
4. Come up with your own scenario (a force and a distance) that 
would result in 100 J of energy expenditure. 
5. The numbers in Table 5.1 are reasonable but should not be thought of as right.40 You can make your own table by using mgh for lifting and mo2 for kinetic energy. For this exercise, pick three familiar activities or situations that allow you to estimate an energy scale in Joules and compute/estimate the results. 
6. Just for fun, compute the energy associated with the mass of a tiny bit of shaving stubble having a mass of 0.01 mg41 using E = mc2. Make sure you use the correct units to put the result in Joules. The speed of light, c, is approximately 3 x 108 m/s. 
7. What exchanges of energy (between what forms) happens when a hand grenade explodes and sends pieces of its casing flying away from the explosion at high velocity? You may wish to describe more than one step/exchange. 
8. Follow the evolution of energy exchanges for a wad of clay that you throw high into the air. Describe what is happening as the clay moves upward, as it reaches its apex, as it falls back down, and finally hits the ground with a thud. Where does the initial energy you put into the clay end up?

15. If a typical metabolic intake is 2,000 kcal each day, approximately how much energy does this translate to for one day, in units of kWh? Compare this to a typical American household's electricity usage of 30 kWh in a day. 
16. The chapter banner image (page 68) shows food labels for peanut butter and Nutella. The former indicates 188 Calories in a 32 g serving, while Nutella is 539 kcal in 100 g. To compare, we must adjust to the same serving size. Using 100 g as a sensible reference, which of the two is more energetic for the same serving size, and by how much (as a percentage)? 
17. Based on the peanut butter label in the chapter banner image (page 68), showing 188 Cal per 32 g serving, how much mass of peanut butter would need to be consumed daily to constitute a 2,000 kcal/day diet? If a baseball has a mass of 145 g, how many baseballs of peanut butter would need to be consumed each day? 
18. A generic $10 pizza might contain about 2,500 kcal. What is this in kWh? Electricity typically costs $0.15 per kWh,44 so how much would a pizza's amount of energy cost in electrical terms? Which of the two is a cheaper form of energy? 
19. A refrigerator cycles on and off. Let's say it consumes electrical power at a rate of 150 W when it's on, and (essentially) 0 W when it's off. If it spends half of its time in the on-state, what is its average power? How much energy does it consume in a 24-hour day, in

23. If Problem 21 had resulted in 5,000 W,46 how many kilowatt-hours (kWh) are expended in a 24-hour period? At an electricity cost of around $0.15 per kWh,47 about how much will it cost, per day, to 
maintain heat? 
24. If Problem 21 had resulted in 5,000 W,48 how many Btu are required in a day to maintain temperature? How many Therms is this? At a typical cost of around $1.25 per Therm, about how much does it cost per day to heat the home? 
25. If Problem 21 had resulted in 5,000 W,49 how many gallons of liquid propane 50 would be consumed in heating the home for a day? At a cost of around $2.50 per gallon, about how much does it cost per day to heat the home? 
26. The chapter banner image (page 68) shows data from the author's utility bill, reflecting 230 kWh of electricity and 4 Therms of gas usage. Annoyingly, the units are different. How do the actual energies compare, if expressed in the same units?51 How would you capture in a simple sentence the approximate comparison of energy use for each? 
27. The chapter banner image (page 68) shows part of the hot water heater label in the author's home, showing a rating of 40,000 Btu/hr. How much power is it capable of putting out, in Watts? 
28. The chapter banner image (page 68) shows the energy label associ- ated with the author's hot water heater, estimating that it will use 242 Therms per year. If the estimated energy cost is distributed evenly across 12 months, what would the utility bill be expected to report? Based on an actual utility bill in the same image, the usage for one billing period was 4 Therms. How does actual usage compare to estimated usage, as an approximate percentage?

6 Putting Thermal Energy to Work 
S 
A 
R 
We have already encountered thermal energy in two contexts. The first was infrared radiation (Eq. 1.8; p. 10), and the second was in the definition of the kilocalorie (Sec. 5.5; p. 73). Otherwise, heat has often been treated as a form of "waste" in a chain of energy conversion: friction, air resistance, etc. The insinuation was that heat is an unwanted byproduct of no value. 
Yet 94% of the energy we use today is thermal in nature [34]: we burn a lot of stuff for energy!1 Sometimes heat is what we're after, but how can we use it to fly airplanes, propel cars, and light up our screens? This chapter aims to clarify how heat is used, and explore limits to the efficiency at which heat can perform non-thermal work. 
Like the previous chapter, this topic represents a slight detour from the book's overall trajectory, which otherwise aims to build a steady narrative of what we can't expect to continue doing, what options we might use to change course, and finally how to bring about such change. Nonetheless, the way we utilize thermal energy is a key piece of the story, and relates to both current and future pathways to satisfying our energy demands.

6.2 Heat Capacity 
First, we'll connect a basic thermal concept to something we already covered in Sec. 5.5 (p.73) in the context of the calorie. The statement that it takes 1 kcal to heat 1 kilogram of H2O by 1°C is in effect defining the specific heat capacity of water. In SI units, we would say that H2O has a specific heat capacity of 4,184 J/kg/°C.2 Very few substances top water's specific heat capacity. Most liquids, like alcohols, tend to be in the range of 2,000 J/kg/°C. Most non-metallic solids (and even air) come in around 1,000 J/kg/°C. Metals are in the 130-900 J/kg/°C range-lighter metals at the top, and heavier ones at the lower end.3 Table 6.1 provides a sample of specific heat capacities for common substances. 
Knowing the specific heat capacity of a substance allows us to compute how much energy it will take to raise its temperature. A useful and approximate guideline is to treat water as 4,000 J/kg/°C and all other stuff (air, furniture, walls) as 1,000 J/kg/°C. Mixtures, like food, might be somewhere between, at 2,000-3,500, due to high water content. If in doubt, 1,000 J/kg/°C is never going to be too far off. For estimation purposes, deviate from this only for high water-content1 or for metals.5 
Example 6.2.1 A 2,000 kg pick-up truck is transporting a one-cubic- meter container of water. How much energy will it take to raise the temperature of the whole ensemble by 5°C? 
A cubic meter of water (1,000 L) is 1,000 kg and has a heat capacity around 4,000 J/kg/°C; the truck is mostly steel, so we might guess 500 J/kg/°C. Multiply each specific heat capacity by the respective mass and the 5 degree change to get 20 MJ to heat the water and 5 MJ to heat the truck for a total of 25 MJ.6

2: For temperature changes, it is always possible to interchange per-degrees-Celsius and per-Kelvin because the two are only different by a constant offset, so that any change in temperature is the same measure in both. 
3: The pattern here is that substances like water or alcohols containing light atoms like hydrogen have higher heat capacities than substances like metals containing heavier 
atoms.

6 Putting Thermal Energy to Work 86 
To perform computations using specific heat capacity, try an intuitive approach rather than some algorithmic formula. The following should just make a lot of sense to you, and can guide how to put the pieces together: it takes more energy to heat a larger mass or to raise the tempera- ture by a larger amount. It's all proportional. The units also offer a hint. 
To 
go from specific heat capacity in J/kg/°C to energy in J, we need to multiply by a mass and by a temperature change. 
Example 6.2.2 To compute the amount of energy it will take to heat a 30 kg piece of furnitures by 8°C, we will multiply the specific heat capacity by the mass-to capture the "more mass" quality—and then multiply by the temperature change-to reflect the "more temperature change" element. In this case, we get 240 kJ. 
7: Although, this would be a good oppor- tunity for a student to make up their own formula, driving home the concept and the fact that equations simply capture a con- cept. Also, the choice of symbols is arbitrary, which the experience would reinforce.

6.3 Home Heating/Cooling 
Our personal experience with thermal energy is usually most connected to heating a living space and heating water or food. Indeed, about two-thirds of the energy used in residential and commercial spaces9 relate to thermal tasks, like heating or cooling the spaces, heating water, refrigeration, drying clothes, and cooking. 
When it comes to heating (or cooling) a home, we might care about two things: 
how long will it take to change its temperature by some certain amount; and 
how much energy it will take to keep it at the desired temperature. 
The first depends on how much stuff is in the house,10 how much AT you want to impart, and how much power is available to create11 the heat. The 
energy required is mass times AT times the catch-all 1,000 J/kg/°C specific heat capacity. The time it takes is then the energy divided by the available power. 
Example 6.3.1 How long will it take to heat up the interior of a mobile home from 0°C to 20°C using two 1,500 W space heaters? We'll assume that we must heat up about 6,000 kg of mass.12 
The first job is to find the energy required and then divide by power to get a time. We'll use the good-for-most-things specific heat capacity of 1,000 J/kg/°C. 
Multiplying the specific heat capacity by mass and temperature change results in 120 MJ of energy. At a rate of 3,000 W, it will take 40,000 s to inject this much energy, which is about 11 hours. 
How much it takes to maintain temperature depends on how heat flows out of (or into) the house through the windows, walls, ceiling, floor,

and air gaps. But it also depends linearly on AT-the difference between inside and outside temperatures-that is being maintained. A house can be characterized by its heat loss rate in units of Watts per degree Celsius.13 This single number then indicates how much power is needed to maintain a certain AT between inside and outside. Box 6.1 explores an example of how to compute the heat loss rate for a house, and Example 6.3.2 applies the result to practical situations.

Figure 6.1: External walls and windows for the house modeled in Box 6.1. The floor and ceiling are not shown. The numbers in W/m2/°C are U-values, and in this case represent the very best engineering prac- tices. Most houses will have larger values by factors as high as 2-6. Don't forget the door in a real house! 
Box 6.1: House Construction 
The very best practices result in a snugly-built house qualified as a "Passive House," achieving 0.15 W/°C for each square meter of external-interfacing surface14 and 0.8 W/°C per square meter of 
windows. 
Let's imagine a house having a square footprint 12 m by 12 m, walls 2.5 m high, each of the four walls hosting two windows, and each window having an area of 2 m2 (Figure 6.1). The floor and the ceiling are both 144 m2, and the wall measures (perimeter times height) 48 x 2.5= 120 m2. But we deduct 16 m2 for the eight windows, leaving 104 m2 for the walls. The resulting heat loss measure for the house is 13 W/°C for the windows (0.8 W/m2/°C x 16 m2), plus 59 W/°C for the walls/floor/ceiling for a total of 72 W/°C. 
The loss rate for a decently-constructed house might be about twice this, while a typically-constructed house (little attention to efficiency) might be 3-6 times this several hundred W/°C. Of course, smaller houses have smaller areas for heat flow and will have smaller loss 
rates. 
ceiling-to-

The numbers used to characterize heat loss properties of walls and windows are called U-values, in units of W/m2/°C, where low numbers represent better insulators. In the U.S., building materials are described by an inverse measure, called the R-value, in ugly units of °F ft2 hr/Btu. The two are numerically related as R 5.7/U, so that our Passive House wall has R≈ 38 and the windows have R≈ 7-both rather impres- sive and hard to achieve.

Example 6.3.2 Let's compare the requirements to keep three different houses at 20°C while the temperature outside is 0°C (freezing point). The first is a snugly-built house as described in Box 6.1, where we round the heat loss rate to a more convenient 75 W/°C. We'll then imagine a decently built house at 150 W/°C, and a more typical15 
house at 300 W/°C. 
The temperature difference, AT, is 20°C, so that our super-snug house

will require 75 W/°C times 20°C, or 1,500 W16 to keep it warm, while the decent house needs 3,000 W and the shoddy house needs 6,000 W. 
Once we understand how much power it takes to maintain a certain temperature (AT) in a house, we can anticipate the behavior of the house's heater. Heaters are typically either on full-blast or off. Regulation is achieved by turning the heat on and off-usually controlled by a thermostat. Given the rating of a heater,17 it is then straightforward to anticipate the duty cycle: the percentage of time it has to be on to produce an average output meeting the power requirement for some particular ΔΤ. 
In a sensible world, heaters are characterized by W (or kW). In the U.S., the measure for many appliances is Btu/hr. Since 1 Btu is 1,055 J and one hour is 3,600 s, one Btu/hr equates to 0.293 W.18 A whole house heater-sometimes in the form of a furnace-might be rated at 30,000 Btu/hr (about 10 kW), in which case the three outcomes in Example 6.3.2 would require the heater to be on about 15%, 30%, or 60% of the time19 to maintain AT = 20°C in the three houses. 
It is also possible to assess how much AT the foregoing heater could maintain in the three houses. It should stand to reason that a house requiring 100 W/°C and having a 10,000 W heater can support a AT as high as 100°C.20 Thus, the three houses from Example 6.3.2 could support AT values of 133°C, 67°C, and 33°C if equipped with a 10 kW (~30,000 Btu/hr) heater. The snug house does not need such a powerful heater installed. The poorly built house can maintain a AT = 33°C differential at full-blast, which means that if the temperature drops below -13°C (8.6°F) outside, it will not be able to keep the inside as high as 20°C. So a house in a cold climate should either be built to better thermal standards, or will require a bigger heater-costing more to heat the home.21 
Cooling a home (or refrigerator interior, or whatever) is also a thermal process, but in this case involves removing thermal energy from the cooler environment. Removing heat is harder to do, as witnessed by the length of human history that has utilized heating sources starting with fire-compared to the relatively short amount of time when we have been able to produce cooling on demand.22 Section 6.5 will get into how this is even possible, in principle. For now, just be aware that the rating on air conditioners uses the same units as heaters: how much thermal energy can be moved (out of the cooler environment) per unit time. In SI units, we know this as the Watt. In the U.S., it's Btu/hr.

18: 1,055 J in 3,600 s is 0.293 J/s. 
19: These are duty cycles. 
20: First, this is a ridiculously high number! Second, rather than rely on an equation, or memory about whether the 100 W/°C and 10,000 W should be divided or multiplied, try to internalize the meaning of each, or at least use the units as a guide. Then, the appropriate math manipulation becomes more obvious. 
21: Other possible options are to tolerate a lower internal temperature or move some- place warmer. 
22: In fact, we've had the word "warmth" for a long time, but have not even gotten around to inventing the word "coolth" yet. 
6.4 Heat Engines 
Now we get to the part where thermal energy can be used to do something other than just provide direct heat to a home. It may seem odd to always

characterize burning fuel as a purely thermal action, since what transpires within the cylinder of a gasoline-burning internal combustion engine seems like more of a little explosion than just the generation of heat. This is not wrong, but neither is it the whole story. The process still begins as a fundamentally thermal event. When the fuel-air mixture ignites, the temperature in the cylinder increases dramatically. To appreciate what happens as an immediate consequence, we turn to the ideal gas law: 
PV = NkBT. 
23 
(6.1) 
P, V and T are pressure, volume, and temperature (in N/m2, m3, and Kelvin). N is the number of atoms or molecules, and kg = 1.38×10-23 J/K 
kB is the Boltzmann constant, which we will see again in Sec. 13.2 (p. 199). The temperature rise upon ignition is fast enough that the cylinder volume does not have time to change. Eq. 6.1 then tells us that the pressure must also spike when temperature does, all else being held constant. The increase in pressure then pushes the piston away, increasing the cylinder volume and performing work.24 But it all starts thermally, via a sharp increase in temperature. 
In the most general terms, thermal energy tries to flow from hot to cold-out of a pot of hot soup; or into a cold drink from the surrounding air; or into your feet from hot sand. Some part of this flow can manifest as physical work, at which point the system can be said to be acting as a heat engine. 
Definition 6.4.1 A heat engine is loosely defined as any system that turns heat, or thermal energy into mechanical energy: moving stuff. 
Example 6.4.1 Example heat engines: when heat drives motion. 
1. Hot air over a car's roof rises, gaining both kinetic energy and 
gravitational potential energy; 
2. Wind is very similar, in that air in contact with the sun-heated ground rises and gains kinetic energy on an atmospheric scale; 3. The abrupt temperature increase in an internal combustion cylinder drives a rapid expansion of gas within the cylinder; 4. Steam in a power plant races though the turbine because it is 
flowing to the cold condenser. 
The last example deserves its own graphic, as important as this process is in our lives: almost all of our electricity generation-from all the fossil fuels and even from nuclear fission-follows this arrangement. Figure 6.2 illustrates the basic scheme. Table 6.2 indicates that 98% of our electricity involves turning a turbine on a shaft connected to a generator, and 84% involves a thermal process as the motive agent for the turbine-most often in the form of steam. 
This is the physicist's version, which looks a little different than the chemist's PV nRT. For a comparison, see Sec. B.4 (p. 381). 
23: The moving piston allows the volume to change, but on slower timescales. 
24: Work is measured as pressure times the change in volume. Pressure is force per unit area, so the units work out to force times distance, as they should given the definition of work.

Figure 6.2: Generic power plant scheme, in which some source of heat at Th generates steam that flows toward the condenser-where the steam cools and reverts to liquid water, by virtue of thermal contact to a cool source at Te provided by a body of water or evaporative cooling towers. Along the way, the rushing steam turns a turbine connected to a generator, exporting electricity. This basic arrangement is employed for most power plants using fossil fuels, nuclear, solar thermal, or geothermal sources of heat. 
6.4.1 Entropy and Efficiency Limits 
A deep and powerful piece of physics intervenes to limit how much useful work may be extracted out of a flow of heat from a hot source at temperature Th to a cold source at temperature Te. That piece is entropy. You don't need to fully grasp the deep and subtle concept of entropy in order to follow the development in this chapter and understand the role entropy plays in limiting heat engine efficiency. All the same, it is a stimulating topic that we'll dip a toe into for some appreciation. 
Definition 6.4.2 Entropy is a measure of how many ways a system might be organized at the microscopic level while preserving the same internal energy.25 
This definition may be an obscure disappointment to those expecting entropy to be defined as a measure of disorder.26 Consider a gas main- tained at constant pressure, volume, and temperature-thus fixing the total energy in the gas. The atoms/molecules comprising the gas can arrange into a staggeringly large number of configurations: any number of positions, velocities, rotational speeds and axis orientations, or vibra- tional states of each molecule, for instance-all while keeping the same overall energy. 
Example 6.4.2 To illustrate, consider a tiny system containing 3 molecules labeled A, B, and C, having a total energy of 6 units split 
25: E.g., at constant temperature, pressure, volume. 
26: Entropy is indeed related to disorder, in that there are many more ways to configure matches in a mess than there are ways to neatly stack them. 
2022 T. W. Murphy, Jr.; Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International Lic.; Freely available at: https://escholarship.org/uc/energy_ambitions.6 Putting Thermal Energy to Work 
between them in some way. They can all have exactly 2.0 units of energy apiece, or can have individual energies of 1.2, 1.8, and 3.0 units; or 3.2, 0.4, and 2.4; or any other of myriad combinations adding to the same thing. Entropy provides a measure of how many combinations27 are possible. 
91 
27: It is far beyond the scope of this book to detail the counting scheme, but it is perhaps important to appreciate that energy levels are discrete or quantized-which prevents an infinite number of possible energy com- binations.

Figure 6.3: A box containing 4 atoms or molecules of one type (white) and 4 of another type (red) has many more configurations available (number in parentheses) when species are equally distributed so that left and right sides both have two of each. Entropy is related to the number of ways a system can distribute itself (at the same energy level), acting to favor disordered mixing over (improbable) orderly separation. 
Example 6.4.3 To better elucidate the connection between entropy and disorder, imagine a box of air, containing both N2 and O2 molecules. As Figure 6.3 illustrates, a thoroughly-mixed arrangement has a larger number of possible configurations, thus the highest entropy. Nature does not give rise to spontaneous organization in a closed system.? 
28 
The First Law of Thermodynamics is one we already encountered as conservation of energy: 
Definition 6.4.3 First Law of Thermodynamics: the energy of a closed system is conserved, and cannot change if nothing including energy— enters or leaves the system boundaries. 
Now we are ready for the Second Law. 
Definition 6.4.4 Second Law of Thermodynamics: the total entropy of a closed system may never decrease. 
It is entropy that governs which way heat flows (hot to cold, if left alone) and in a deep sense defines the "arrow of time." 
Box 6.2: The Arrow of Time 
Consider that if you were shown videos of a rock splashing into water, a coffee mug shattering on the floor, or an icicle melting, you would have no difficulty differentiating between the forward and reverse playbacks of the video. 
The reverse action, you would conclude, is preposterous and can 
28: It is, however, possible to see lowered entropy in one place if balanced by an in- crease elsewhere: life organizes matter, but at the expense of increased entropy in the wider universe.

never happen. Pieces of ceramic strewn about the floor will never spontaneously assemble into a mug and leap from the floor! Energy is not the barrier, because the total energy in all forms is the same29 before and after. It's entropy: the more ordered states are less likely to spontaneously emerge. To appreciate how pervasive entropy is, imagine how easy it is to spot a "fake" video run backwards. 
These two laws of thermodynamics, plus a way to quantify entropy changes that we will see shortly, are all we need to figure out the maximum efficiency a heat engine can achieve in delivering work. If we draw an amount of heat, AQh from a hot bath30 at temperature Th, and allow part of this energy to be "exported" as useful work, AW, then we must have the remainder flow as heat (AQc) into the cold bath at temperature Te. Figure 6.4 offers a schematic of the process. The First Law of Thermodynamics31 requires that AQh = AQc + AW, or that all of the extracted heat from the hot bath is represented in the external work and flow to the cold bath: nothing is lost.

So where does entropy come in? Extracting heat from the hot bath in the amount AQh results in an entropy change in the hot bath according to Definition 6.4.5. 
Definition 6.4.5 Entropy Change: when energy (heat, AQ, in J) is moved into or out of a thermal bath at temperature T, the accompanying change in the bath's entropy, AS, obeys the relation: 
= 
Figure 6.4: Heat engine energy balance. Heat flowing from the hot bath to the cold bath can perform useful work, AW, in the process subject to conservation of energy (AQh AQc + AW), where AQ is a heat flow. Entropy constraints limit how large AW can be. Arrow widths are proportional to energy, and red numbers are example energy amounts, for use in the text.

When heat is removed, entropy is reduced. When heat is added, entropy increases. The temperature, T, must be in Kelvin, and entropy is measured in units of J/K. 
So the extraction of energy from the hot bath results in a decrease of entropy in the hot bath of ASh according to AQh = ThASh. Meanwhile, AS, of entropy is added to the cold bath according to AQc = TASc. The Second Law of Thermodynamics enforces that the total change in

entropy may not be negative (it can't decrease). In equation form (symbol definitions in Table 6.3):32

(6.3) 
where we have subtracted ASh since it was a deduction of entropy, while AS, is an addition. We therefore require that

(6.4) 
Now we are in a position to ask what fraction of AQh can be diverted to useful work (AW) within the constraints of the Second Law. We express this as an efficiency,33 denoted by the Greek epsilon: 
ε = 
AW AQh - AQc 
AQh 
=V 
AQh 
(6.5) 
The second step applies conservation of energy: AQh = AQc + AW. 
Example 6.4.4 Actual Efficiency: If a heat engine is observed to remove 30 J from the hot bath and deposit 20 J into the cold bath, as in Figure 6.4, what is the efficiency of this heat engine in producing useful work? 
Whether we deduce that AW = 10 J and use the first form in Eq. 6.5 or apply the second form using the given heat flows, the answer is 1/3, or 33%. 
We can add a step to Eq. 6.5 to express it in terms of entropy changes: 
32: Remember: treat equations as sentences expressing important concepts in precise ways not merely as algorithmic machines to memorize for plugging in while solving problems. What does it say? 
33: This definition of efficiency captures what we care about: what fraction of the extracted heat can be turned into useful

where we have re-expressed each AQ as an equivalent TAS with- drawal/deposit of entropy. Now we can divide both numerator and denominator by ASh to be left with

where we create η (eta) to represent the ratio of entropies: n = AS/ASh which we know from Eq. 6.4 cannot be smaller than one:

7≥1. 
(6.8) 
Looking at Eq. 6.7, if we want the highest possible efficiency in extracting work from a flow of heat, we want the numerator to be as large as possible. To achieve this, we want to subtract as little as possible from Th If η were allowed to be very large, then the numerator would be reduced. So we want the smallest possible value for η, which we know from Eq.

Temperature must be in Kelvin. Recall that T(K)≈ T(°C) + 273. 
where we have designated AT = Th - Te as the temperature difference between hot and cold baths. A major takeaway is that efficiency improves as AT gets bigger, and becomes vanishingly small for small values of ΔΤ. 
Example 6.4.5 If operating between a hot bath at 800 K and ambient temperature around 300 K,35 a heat engine could produce a maximum efficiency of 62.5%. 
Example 6.4.6 A heat engine operating between boiling and freezing water has Th≈ 373 K and AT 100 K, for a maximum possible 
efficiency of Emax = 0.268, or 26.8%. 
Example 6.4.7 A heat engine operating between human skin tem- perature at 35°C and ambient temperature at 20°C has a maximum efficiency of Emax = 15/308≈ 0.05, or 5%. 
If the cold bath is fixed,36 the maximum possible efficiency improves as the temperature of the hot source goes up. Conversely, for a given Th the efficiency improves as the cold temperature decreases and thus AT increases. 
Box 6.3: At the Extreme Limit... 
If Tc approaches 0 K37, the maximum efficiency approaches 100%. We can trace this back to the relation AQ = TAS, which implies that when T is very small, it does not take much heat (AQ) to meet the requirement for the amount of entropy added to the cold bath (ASC) to be large enough to satisfy the prohibition on net entropy decrease, so the arrow width in Figure 6.4 for AQ, can be rather thin (small) allowing AW to be about as thick (large) as AQh, meaning that essentially all the energy is available to do work and the efficiency can be very high. In practice, Earth does not provide baths cold enough for this effect to kick in, but discussing it is a means to better understand how Eq. 6.9 works. 
Real heat engines like power plants (Figure 6.2) or automobile engines tend to only get about halfway to the theoretical efficiency due to myriad practical challenges. A typical efficiency for an electrical power plant is 30-40%, while cars are typically in the 15-25% range. In contrast, com- bustion temperatures around 700-800°C suggest a maximum theoretical efficiency around 60%. 
35: 300 K is a convenient and reasonable temperature for "normal" environments, corresponding to 27°C or 80.6°F. 
36: This is a common situation, as Te is usually set by the ambient temperature of the air or of a body of water.

6.5 Heat Pumps 
We can flip a heat engine around and call it a heat pump. 
In this case, we apply some external work to drive a heat flow opposite its natural direction-like pushing heat uphill. This is how a refrigerator38 works, for instance. Figure 6.5 sets the stage.

Figure 6.5: Heat pump energy balance. The application of work (AW; from an electrical source, for instance) can drive heat to flow- counterintuitively-from a cold reservoir (like the interior of a freezer) to a hotter en- vironment. Example Tc →Th pairs might include freezer-interior→ room-air; cooled- inside summer-outside; winter-outside →warmed-inside. We still must satisfy con- servation of energy (AQh AQc + AW), where AQ is a heat flow. Entropy constraints limit how large AQc can be for a given AW input. Arrow widths are proportional to en- ergy, and red numbers are example energy amounts, for use in the text. 
= 
A very similar chain of logic can be applied to this configuration, invoking the Second Law to guarantee no entropy decrease. We define the efficiency according to the application and what we care about, giving rise to two different figures of merit. 
Definition 6.5.1 Ecool: For cooling applications,39 we care about how much heat can be removed from the cooler environment (AQc) for a given input of work (AW). The efficiency is then characterized by the ratio & cool = AQc/AW. 
40 
Definition 6.5.2 Eheat: For heating applications, we care about the heat delivered to the hot bath (AQ) for a given amount of input work (AW). The efficiency is then characterized by the ratio Eheat = AQh/AW. 
The derivation goes similarly to the one above, but now we require that the entropy added to the hot bath must not be smaller than the entropy removed from the cold bath so that the total change in entropy is not negative.41 In this case, the maximum allowed efficiencies for cooling and heating via heat pumps are:

6 Putting Thermal Energy to Work 
Example 6.5.1 What is the limit to efficiency of maintaining a freezer at -10°C in a room of 20°C? 
First, we express the temperatures in Kelvin: T≈ 263 K and AT = 30 K.43 The maximum efficiency, by Eq. 6.10, computes to cool ≤ 8.8 (880%). 
Example 6.5.2 What is the limit to efficiency of keeping a home interior at 20°C when it is -10°C outside? 
First, we express the temperatures in Kelvin: Th≈ 293 K and AT = 30 K.44 The maximum efficiency, by Eq. 6.11, computes to Ɛheat ≤9.8 (980%). 
Box 6.4: Is >100% Really Possible? 
At first, it seems to be spooky and impossible that efficiencies can be greater than 100%. Example 6.5.1 essentially says that as many as 8.8 J of thermal energy can be moved for a mere 1 J input of work! The situation bears analogy to the martial art of Jiu Jitsu, whereby the opponent's momentum is used to their detriment, requiring little work to direct its flow. In this case, we convince a bundle of thermal energy sitting in the freezer to move outside where it is hotter (uphill; against natural flow) and in the process use less energy than the amount of thermal energy residing in the bundle. 
The fact that our "efficiency” metrics come out to be greater than 100% is an illusion: an artifact of how we defined cool and Ɛheat. Conservation of energy is not violated; we're just putting the small piece (AW) in the denominator to form the efficiency metric.45 In this sense, it's not the usual sort of efficiency measure, which puts the largest quantity (total budget) in the denominator. 
In the case of heating, it is worth comparing the output of a heat pump to the application of direct heat. Let's revisit the scenarios explored in Section 6.3. 
.46 
Example 6.5.3 If a house's thermal performance is 150 W/°C and we want to maintain 20°C inside while the outside temperature is a frigid -20°C, we would need to supply 6,000 W of energy to the home in the form of burning fuel (natural gas, propane, firewood) or electricity for direct-heating application.47 
But according to Eq. 6.11, a heat pump could theoretically move 6,000 W of thermal energy by only applying 820 W without violating the Second Law, since Ɛheat ≤ 293/40 = 7.3 and 6,000 J (AQh) divided by 7.3 (to get AW) is 820 J.48 
Engineering realities will prevent operating right up to the thermody-

44: Note that AT = 30 in either K or °C. 
Maybe the situation can be compared more understandably to money transfers, where one might pay a $20 fee to wire $1,000 from account A to account B. It doesn't mean that $1,000 was created out of $20-just that $20 was spent (like AW) to move a much larger sum into account B. But if account A belonged to somebody else, it would seem like you just turned $20 of your own money into $1,000 at a gain of 5,000%, even though it really came from elsewhere. 
45: Following the example numbers in Fig- ure 6.5, we would say that cool, defined as AQC/AW, is 2.0, and heat is 3.0.

namic limit, but we might at least expect to be able to accomplish the 6,000 W goal of Example 6.5.3 for under 2,000 W. Thus the heat pump has shaved a factor of three (or more) off the energy required to provide heat inside. Heat pumps are very special. 
As Eq. 6.10 and Eq. 6.11 imply, heat pumps are most efficient when AT is small. Thus a refrigerator in a hot garage must not only work harder to maintain a large AT, it does so less efficiently-making it a double-whammy. For home heating, heat pumps offer the most gain in milder climates where AT is not so brutal.

6.5.1 Consumer Metrics: COP, EER, HSPF 
When shopping for heat pumps or air conditioners (or freezers/refriger- ators), products are specified by the coefficient of performance (COP) or energy efficiency ratio (EER) or heating seasonal performance factor (HSPF), as in Figure 6.6. How do these relate to our Ɛheat and cool values? The first one is easy. 
Definition 6.5.3 COP: Heat pumps used for heating are specified by a coefficient of performance (COP), which turns out to be familiar already: 
COP = Ɛheat. 
(6.12) 
Example 6.5.4 COP Example: Using the red numbers in Figure 6.5, we can compute Ɛheat, the COP, and then determine the minimum T theoretically permissible (resulting in maximum possible efficiency) if Th= 300 K.49 
We go back to the original definition of Eheat as AQh/AW, which for our numbers works out to 30/10, or 3.0 The COP is then simply 3.0. 
Setting Ɛheat,max= Th/AT equal to 3.0, we find that AT is 100 K, so that the minimum permissible T = 200 K in this case. 
The EER is different, and perhaps a little odd. EER is defined as the amount of heat moved (AQc), in Btu, per work input (AW), in watt-hours (Wh). What?! Sometimes the world is just loopy. But we can manage this. If handed an EER (Btu/Wh), we can convert it to our same/same numer- ator/denominator units by converting both numerator and denominator to the same units. We could convert Btu to Wh in the numerator and 
be done, or convert Wh to Btu in the denominator and be done, or we could convert both numerator and denominator to Joules50 to get there. For illustrative purposes, we'll pick the last approach. To get from Btu to Joules, we multiply (the numerator) by 1,055. To get from Wh to Joules, we multiply the denominator (or divide the EER construct) by 3,600.51 The net effect is highlighted in the following definition.

(6.14) 
Example 6.5.5 EER Example: Using the red numbers in Figure 6.5, we can compute &cool, the EER, and then determine the maximum Th theoretically permissible (resulting in maximum possible efficiency) given a target Tc of 260 K, as we might find in a freezer. 
We go back to the original definition of cool as AQc/AW, which for our numbers works out to 20/10, or 2.0. The EER is then 3.41 times this amount, or 6.8. 
Setting Ecool,max = Te/AT equal to 2.0, we find that AT is 130 K, so that the maximum permissible Th = 390 K in this case. 
Because the theoretical maximum efficiency depends on AT-according to Eq. 6.10 and Eq. 6.11-and therefore can fluctuate as outdoor temper- atures change, a seasonal average is often employed, called the SEER (seasonal EER). In a similar vein, the HSPF measures the same thing as the COP, but in units of EER52 and averaged over the heating season. 
Definition 6.5.5 HSPF: Heat pumps used for heating are sometimes specified by the heating seasonal performance factor (HSPF), which modifies Eq. 6.11 as follows.

Example 6.5.6 HSPF Example: Using the red numbers in Figure 6.5, we can compute Ɛheat and the HSPF. 
We go back to the original definition of Ɛheat as AQh/AW, which for our numbers works out to 30/10, or 3.0. The COP is then 3.0, and the 
HSPF is 3.41 times this, or 10.2. 
Typical COP values for heat pumps range from about 2.5-4.5.53 This means an energy savings by a factor of 2.5 to 4.5 for heating a house via heat pump vs. direct electrical heating. Quite a bargain. An air conditioner EER rating is typically in the range 10-20, corresponding to 3-6 in terms of Ecool-similar to the range for heat pumps in heating

mode.54 Houses equipped with electric heat pumps can typically be run for both cooling and heating applications, making them a versatile and efficient solution for moving thermal energy in or out of a house. 
Heat pumps leveraging the moderate-temperature ground just below the surface as the external thermal bath are called "geothermal" heat pumps, but have nothing to do with geothermal energy (as a source). Compared to heat pumps accessing more extreme outside air temper- atures, geothermal heat pumps benefit from a smaller AT, and thus operate at higher efficiency. 
99 
54: EER and HSPF numbers are "inflated" by a factor of 1/0.293≈ 3.41 compared to COP due to the unfortunate choice of units 
for EER and HSPF. 
6.6 Upshot on Thermal Energy 
Sometimes we just want heat. Cooking, home heating, and materials processing all need direct heat. Burning fossil fuels, firewood, biofuels, extracting geothermal energy, or simply letting the sun warm our houses all directly utilize thermal energy. Specific heat capacity tells us how much thermal energy is needed to change something's temperature, using 1,000 J/kg/°C as a rough guess if lacking more specific infor- mation.55 We also saw how to estimate home heating demand using a metric of heat loss rate, such as 200 W/°C. 
But it turns out that we use heat for much more than this. 84% of our electricity is produced by heat engines, using heat flow to drive a turbine to turn a generator. The maximum efficiency a heat engine can achieve is set by limits on entropy and amounts to Emax < AT/Th, although in practice we tend to be a factor of two or more short of the thermodynamic limit.56 In any case, thermal energy plays a giant role in how we run our society. 
Heat pumps are like heat engines in reverse: driving a flow of thermal energy against the natural hot-to-cold direction by putting in work. Any refrigeration or cooling system is likely to use this approach.57 Because heat pumps only need to move thermal energy, each Joule they move can require a small fraction of a Joule to accomplish, making them extremely clever and efficient devices. 
55: Or we frequently use water's value at 4,184 J/kg/°C, connected to the definition of a kcal. 
56: Typical efficiencies are 20% for cars and 35% for power plants-compared to 60% theoretical. 
57: A notable exception is evaporative cool- ing.

Using the catch-all specific heat capacity for all of this stuff, how much energy will it take, and how long to heat it up at a rate of 10 kW? Express in useful, intuitive units, and feel free to round, since it's an estimate, anyway.

19. If a refrigerator works at half of its theoretical &cool limit, how much more energy does it take to maintain an internal temperature of 0°C in a 40°C garage vs. a 20°C house interior? Two things are going on here: even at the same efficiency, the cooling energy scales as AT, but the efficiency also changes for a double-whammy. 
20. Changing from direct electrical heating to a heat pump operating with a COP of 3 means spending one-third the energy for a certain thermal benefit. If a house averages 30 kWh/day in heating cost through the year using direct electrical heating at a cost of $0.15/kWh, how long will it take to recuperate a $5,000 installation cost of a new heat pump?

7 The Energy Landscape 
Now that we have a handle on common energy units and thermal processes, we can take a look at various sources of energy data and make sense of the information, allowing meaningful cross-comparisons. In this chapter, we will do exactly that, gaining in the process a perspective on the past and present roles different energy sources play at a national and global level. 
Most of the information in this chapter comes from the U.S. Energy Information Administration's (EIA's) Annual Energy Review [34], and from a compilation of global data owing to Vaclav Smil and the British Petroleum Statistical Review of World Energy [16]. Rather than laboriously citing each instance, it is sufficient to assume for this chapter that numbers for the U.S. come from the former and global numbers come from the latter, unless stated otherwise.

7.1 The Annual Energy Review 
Until 2011, the Annual Energy Review (AER) was compiled for the U.S. as an annual report. Since then, a web interface provides access to many of the same products, but not as a single document. An impressive amount of detail is available in the AER products, and we will only scratch the surface in this book, looking at high-level overviews. Later chapters will sometimes rely on deeper information to provide state-by-state use of hydroelectric, solar, wind, etc. But for now, we stick mostly to section 1 of the Annual Energy Review (AER), labeled Energy Overview.

11 Total energy consumption, which is the sum of primary energy consumption, electricity retail sales, and electrical system energy losses. Losses are allocated to the end-use sectors in proportion to each sector's share of total electricity retail sales. See Note 1, "Electrical System Energy Losses," at the end of U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), Monthly Energy Review (April 2019), Section 2. 
Notes:⚫ Data are preliminary. Values are derived from source data prior to rounding for publication. Totals may not equal sum of components due to independent rounding. Sources: EIA, Monthly Energy Review (April 2019), Tables 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4a, 1.4b, and 2.1. 
Figure 7.1: The flow of energy in the U.S. for 2018, as presented in [34]. Units are quadrillions of Btu (qBtu), unfortunately. From U.S. EIA. 
From past experience, many students dislike this graphic. Firstly, it's a product of the EIA, and not a creation of this book. Secondly, it is actually not so bad, once you get the hang of it. 
Resources come in from the left. Expenditures or exports go off to the right. The format guarantees that all inputs must match all outputs.1 We also see at a glance the big players vs. small players. 
To understand, let's start in the middle section. To the left of center, we see that the total supply sums to 122.44 qBtu. Of this, we consume 101.25 qBtu (right of center) and export the remaining 21.19 qBtu. Now we focus on the central column to get a powerful visual and quantitative snapshot of how our energy is partitioned.2 From this, we see that 13% is coal, 31% is natural gas, 36.5% is petroleum (oil), 8% is nuclear energy, and 11.5% is renewable energy.3 
1: That is, no significant amount of energy is stored or drawn from a stockpile. 
2: By luck, total consumption is very nearly 100 qBtu, so the amount of each source in qBtu is already approximately a percentage! 
See how they add up? 
3: Think of the three forms of fossil fuels as solid (coal), liquid (petroleum/oil) and gas (natural gas; not the same as liquid gasoline, which is a petroleum product).

Now the right-hand side shows the sectors into which the energy flows, finding roughly equal distribution between residential (homes), commercial (businesses), industrial (manufacture), and transportation (both personal and commercial/shipping). In this graphic, we lose entirely any sense for how much of each energy source contributes to each sector, but that is coming in the next section. 
Finally, the left-hand side indicates the inputs, grouped as domestic fossil fuel supply at top (out of our own ground), nuclear energy and renewable in the middle, and imports at bottom. From this, we can learn that we export some coal,5 that almost all of our natural gas and 100% of our nuclear is domestic, and that 62% of our petroleum comes from domestic crude oil production. 
Other insights are present in the graphic as well. Don't be afraid to subtract or divide numbers to aid new discoveries. 
Box 7.1: 100 quads? So what? 
To put the scale into a bit of perspective, 100 qBtu in a year for the U.S. is about 1020 J in a year. A year is 3.156 × 107 seconds long, meaning that the U.S. power budget is just over 3 TW (3 × 1012 W). Distributed among a little over 300 million people, the average contribution per person is about 10,000 W. That's a lot. As we have seen in Sec. 5.5 (p. 73), human metabolism is about 100 W. So Americans have approximately 100 times as much energy available as their personal metabolism. The situation has been compared to each person having 100 energy servants! No wonder we live better than royalty of ages past. Even though the U.S. uses about 4.5 times the global energy per capita (about 20% of the world's energy and 5% of population), the average citizen of Earth still has over 20 energy servants available, on average, thanks almost entirely to fossil fuels. They have been an unqualified game changer. 
7 The Energy Landscape 
104 
4: For instance, we cannot tell how much coal is used in the industrial sector. 
5: For instance, the supply of 15.33 qBtu that is mined is larger than the 13.24 qBtu 
we consume. 
Ask yourself what else you can learn 
from the numbers! 
6: Neat trick: roughly л x 107 seconds in a 
year. 
7: This showed up in Table 3.4 (p. 43) and also in Box 5.4 (p. 75). 
8: American energy usage is much higher than average because of consumerism, diet, comfort standards, prevalence of detached housing, and transportation. 
7.1.2 Source and Sector 
Figure 7.2 provides a more detailed breakdown of how energy flows from source to usage sectors." In other words out of the 101.25 qBtu consumed in 2018, we see how much comes from each source, and within each source can track how much goes to each end-use category. For example, we learn that 91% of coal and 100% of nuclear go to electricity, and that 92% of transportation is based on petroleum. 
Notice the black and gray block at lower center, representing electricity. We derive electricity from all the sources on the left, and electricity is consumed in all sectors. Also, of the 38.3 qBtu going into making electricity, only 13.0 qBtu (34%) makes it out the door as electricity, due to thermodynamic losses that were covered in Chapter 6. 
9: Notice that the source and end-use num- 
bers in the boxes match the numbers in Figure 7.1 within rounding error.

Figure 7.2: Tracking of energy sources and end-use in the U.S. for 2018, from section 2.0 of the AER. Small numbers beside the blocks represent percentages. Numbers that are not percentages are qBtu (quads). From U.S. EIA. 
In principle, it is possible (and would be nice) to put percentages where the arrows enter and exit the electricity sector, but enough numbers are present to work this out, as Example 7.1.1 demonstrates. Without these numbers, the story is a little misleading. For instance, only 17% of natural gas goes directly to residential use, but some natural gas produces electricity, which then flows to residences. It is therefore not immediately obvious what percentage of residential energy ultimately comes from natural gas, but it's more than the 43% indicated in the figure. 
A similar graphic combining some elements of both Figure 7.1 and Figure 7.2 is provided by Lawrence Livermore National Lab [35],10 
Example 7.1.1 Let's work through the numbers in Figure 7.2 to elucidate what percentage of residential energy ultimately derives from natural gas. The same technique can be pursued to ask similar questions about any source-to-sector pathway, by incorporating the electricity contribution. 
We start simply, by noting that 43% of the 11.9 qBtu residential energy

106 
budget comes directly from natural gas. So that's 5.1 qBtu."1 
Now, 35% of natural gas goes toward electricity, which we can compute to be 10.9 qBtu. 
12 
So of the 38.3 qBtu total energy coming into the electricity block, 10.9 qBtu (28%) is from natural gas. 
13 
Assuming the 34% efficiency14 of electricity production applies equally across all sources (close to the truth), we can say that 28% of the electricity output comes from gas: 28% of 13.0 qBtu (electricity output) is 3.7 qBtu. 
But not all of this goes into homes. The home gets 42% of its 11.9 qBtu from electricity, or 5.0 qBtu. We can assume that 28% of the 5 qBtu of electricity flowing into the home derives from natural gas, as decided above. So that's 1.4 qBtu of gas-derived electricity flowing into the home. 
We can add this 1.4 qBtu of gas-derived electricity to the 5.2 qBtu15 of direct gas-to-home to learn that 6.6 qBtu of residential input is sourced from natural gas either directly or via electricity. Compared to the 11.9 qBtu total for residences, natural gas therefore contributes 55% of the energy used in homes, not just 43% as listed. Now we know. 
7.1.3 Detailed Mix 
Delving a bit further into the AER, Section 1.3 provides a more de- tailed breakdown of consumption, now separating out the "renewable" category into its constituent parts, as seen in Table 7.1 and Figure 7.3. 
In sum, 80% of the U.S. energy in 2018 came from fossil fuels. Less than 2.5% came from wind, and less than 1% was solar in origin-the other 16% mainly in the form of nuclear, biomass, and hydroelectricity. Most of the renewable energy is from biomass-like burning wood. The wider world is pretty similar, in that about 80% of energy is from fossil fuels. It's still our main squeeze. Table 7.2 breaks out electricity sources separately. 
Box 7.2: Thermal Equivalent 
Note that the EIA-and thus Table 7.1-habitually applies a ther- mal conversion factor to some energy sources in order to more meaningfully compare one source to another. Fossil fuel energy is characterized by its thermal content, which makes sense as they are burned for thermal energy. Often-but not always-the thermal energy is turned into electrical energy. Meanwhile, some sources, like solar, hydroelectric, wind, nuclear, and geothermal are almost exclusively used for electricity production and are most easily mea- 
11: As a check, we note that the other side 
of the blue arrow has 17% of 31.0 qBtu, or 5.3 qBtu leaves the gas block for homes: close enough to the 5.1 qBtu we got on the other side (essentially the same, to rounding error). 
12: 35% of 31.0 qBtu 
13: Wouldn't it be nice if Figure 7.2 printed

sured by electrical output, not thermal input (which is meaningless for solar, wind, and hydro). 
Multiplying the electrical output by a factor of about 3 recovers the thermal equivalent.16 The interpretation is: how much fossil fuel (thermally) would have been necessary to achieve the same result? As a consequence, when Table 7.1 says the solar contribution is 0.92 qBtu, and therefore about 1% of the total, the actual solar energy was smaller by a factor of three, but the practice is fair because now we can directly compare solar to the fossil fuels. Reporting electrical output alongside thermal inputs would make the renewables appear to have a smaller contribution than they effectively do, against fossil fuels. 
7 The Energy Landscape 
107 
16: The actual factor is just the inverse of the electrical conversion efficiency discussed above (34%, so 1/0.34). The conversion ef- ficiency adopted by the EIA has slowly in- creased over time, and is tracked in Ap- pendix A6 of the AER-now at 37.5%, lead- ing to a conversion factor of 2.67.

Figure 7.4: Recent history of primary energy consumption in the U.S. The three fossil fuels and nuclear are shown separately, and then all renewable sources are grouped together. Note that at the end of the plot, coal has sunk into a tie with renewable resources. The plot on the right shows percentages of total energy. Most of the lines are fairly flat, although in recent years the main story is gas replacing coal. 
7.1.4 Energy Trends 
It is worth looking at trends to understand not only the state of affairs today, but what happened over past decades and trends that may carry into the near future. Section 1.3 of the AER includes data going back to 1950 on the categories in Table 7.1. 
Figure 7.4 shows the trends for the fossil fuels over the last 70 years, along with the slow rise of the sub-dominant non-fossil sources. Recent news touted the fact that the renewable sources17 surpassed coal as an energy source in the U.S. Indeed, the lines basically meet on the

right-hand side of the plot, and the trends suggest a clear reversal of rank going forward. Note, however, that this result is largely due to natural gas replacing coal at electrical power plants. The sharp rise in natural gas nearly mirrors the decline in coal, while the rise in renewable resources is more modest. So this is really more a story of trading gas for coal than renewables replacing coal. Figure 7.4 also shows each source as a percentage of all energy. For a few decades (1980-2010), coal and gas were essentially tied, while oil sat at almost double these two. Lately, gas is approaching oil while coal plummets.

Figure 7.5: Recent history of non-fossil energy consumption in the U.S. Nuclear, hydroelectric, and biomass have dominated, while wind and solar are rising to join as players. Asterisks indicate thermal equivalents, as described in Box 7.2. The same data are plotted at right as a percentage of total energy. Aside from the rapid rise of nuclear in the middle years of the plot, the recent entry of wind and solar (though still only a few percent) are the most interesting developments. 
The non-fossil consumption in Figure 7.5 clarifies the breakdown of the "renewables" curve in Figure 7.4, alongside nuclear. From this, we see that nuclear dominates non-fossil energy, rising quickly from 1970 to 2000 and holding steady since then. Hydroelectric has been pretty stable over the last 50 years as other sources surpass it and lower its rank. The surge in biofuels around 1980 appears to be largely driven by increased burning of wood, while the next surge (2000-2010) was due to biofuels mostly ethanol. Wind is approaching a 3% contribution to our total ~100 qBtu consumption budget, edging up about 0.2% per year. Solar is also on the move, reaching the 1% level recently and rising more slowly than wind. Geothermal is and will continue to be a paltry contributor.

For non-fossil contributions, Figure 7.8 shows the evolution of recent decades. Here, we see that a large part of the reason why renewables exceed nuclear energy globally is because of biomass. This makes sense, as countries having a lower standard of living are more likely to burn wood and less likely to have nuclear power.

data, which expressed energy in qBtu, the units on the plot (Fig. 7.7) changed to terawatt-hours (TWh). It means what it sounds like: tera is 1012, so this is 1012 watt-hours (Wh). We use kWh more often than Wh, so a TWh is the same as a giga-kWh, or GkWh (can you do that?). One kWh is 3.6 x 106 J, so 1 TWh is 3.6 x 1015 J. Meanwhile, 1 qBtu is 1.055 × 1018 J, facilitating a conversion. The figures for global power also 
put qBtu on the right side for easier comparison between plots. 
The source of numbers for this section [16] mix thermal and electrical output, so the plots have multiplied some entries (asterisks in plot legends) by 3.06 for reasons described in Box 7.2. 
[16]: Smil (2017), Energy Transitions: Global and National Perspectives 
7.2.1 U.S. Global Share 
A final overview to help frame a number of discussions in this textbook looks at the U.S. share of consumption of various energy resources compared to the global total. The evolution seen on the left side of Figure 7.9 contains a crucial insight into geopolitics. In 1950, the U.S. used an astounding 84% of global natural gas and 72% of petroleum. At only 6% of the world's population at the time, Americans used more than ten times the global average oil and gas, and substantially more than the rest of the world combined. Since energy per year is the definition of power, we can understand how the U.S. was a literal superpower during this era. Parroting Bill Clinton: It's the resources, stupid. 
This may be a factor in nostalgia for what some Americans see as the "glory days" of the 1950s. To the extent that U.S. energy share played a role, longing for a return to that era is not likely to materialize.

Figure 7.9: The left figure combines Figure 7.4 and Figure 7.7 to show the percentage of energy resources consumed by the U.S. over time. The overall picture is of a world catching up to an early leader. The U.S. was a literal "superpower" in the middle of the twentieth century. The dashed line at bottom represents the fraction of U.S. population in the world, so that energy use above this line means a greater-than-average share, which is true for all sources. The plot at right combines Figure 7.5 and Figure 7.8 to show the percentage of renewable and nuclear energy resources consumed by the U.S. over time. Solar and wind are characteristic of a nation known for innovation: first on the scene. 
The thicker dark blue line in the left panel of Figure 7.9 represents all sources of energy, combined. Around 1950, Americans used a third of all the global energy, corresponding to almost 8 times0mm the global

The right side of Figure 7.9 similarly explores U.S. share of renewables. The only up-trending resource is biomass, due to mandates for ethanol usage. But it is a minor player in the scheme of things. Solar and wind are interesting, in that the U.S. initially held a large global share as pioneers of the technology before the rest of the world joined in. 
7.3 Upshot: Go to the Source 
The purpose of this chapter was twofold: first to introduce students to sources of reliable information on national and global energy production; and second to communicate the landscape of energy use. What emerges is a picture of a world still firmly in the grip of fossil fuels, whose annual usage continues to increase. Wind and solar are making inroads, but only at the few-percent levels thus far. The U.S. has played an outsized role in global energy relative to its population, especially in the mid-twentieth century.

7.4 Problems 
1. Referring to Figure 7.1 and Figure 7.2, figure out the following 
measures: 
a) What percentage of energy consumption in the U.S. is from 
petroleum? 
b) What percentage of transportation is powered by petroleum? c) What percentage of petroleum goes directly to transportation? d) What percentage of petroleum goes directly to industrial 
processes (ignoring via electricity)? 
2. The electricity block at the bottom center of Figure 7.2 is said to be 38.3 qBtu in size. Using the qBtu numbers in the sources at left, and the percentages of each going to electricity, figure out how many qBtu each line connecting to the left side of the electricity block represents.19 What is the total, and does it match the 38.3 qBtu expectation, within reasonable rounding errors? 
3. Building off the result in Problem 2, calculate the percentages20 of contributions coming into the left side of the electricity block in Figure 7.2? Which is the dominant input? 
4. Following a similar approach as for Problem 2,21 concentrate on the output side of electricity production22 and figure out how many qBtu are delivered to each sector on the right-hand side of the figure, based on input percentages to each of the four sectors 
Not the same as previous question.

and their total qBtu amounts. Treat "< 1%" as 0.5%. Do these add to 13 qBtu, as they should, within rounding error?23 
5. Figure 7.2 hides contributions of sources to end sectors behind the "electric black box."24 Following similar logic to that in the margin, and using results from Problem 4, figure out "corrected" values for what percentage of coal provides energy to each of the four end-sectors (re-distributing the 91% going to electricity into end-sectors).25 
6. Figure 7.2 makes it look as if residential demand is satisfied without coal or nuclear, but 42% of residential demand comes from electricity, which does depend in part on coal and nuclear. Using numbers derived in Problem 3, and following a logic similar to that in Problem 5 and Example 7.1.1, redistribute this 42% residential contribution from electricity into its primary sources to ascertain what fraction of residential demand comes from each of the five source categories. For instance, petroleum would be the direct 8% plus 42% times the fraction (or percentage) of electricity coming from petroleum.26 
7. While no energy source is free of environmental harm, arguably the last four entries in Table 7.1 are the cleanest, requiring no burning and no evidently problematic "waste." What percentage of the total U.S. energy is in this "clean" form, at present? 
8. Let's say that in the course of one year a county in Texas produces 5 million kWh of electrical output from wind, and also pumps 100,000 barrels of oil from the ground containing a (thermal) energy content of about 6 GJ per barrel. What percentage of total energy production came from wind, if scaling wind in terms of thermal equivalent, as explained in Box 7.2? 
9. Referring to Figure 7.4, what is the fastest-growing energy source 
in the U.S., and is it one of the fossil fuels? 
10. If the approximately linear trends for recent increases in solar and wind seen in Figure 7.5 were to continue at the current (linear) pace, approximately how long would it take for the pair of them to cover our current ~ 100 qBtu per year demand?27 
11. If the downward trend in U.S. coal use continues at its current 
pace, approximately what year would we hit zero? 
12. Globally, do any of the resources appear to be phasing out, as coal is in the U.S. (as in Problem 11)? If so, how long before we would expect to reach zero usage, globally, based on simple extrapolation? 
13. Globally, would you say that renewable energy sources are climb- ing faster than the combined fossil fuels, or more slowly? Can we therefore confidently project a time when renewables will overtake

23: This is a great way to check the correct- ness of your answers. 
24: For example, the figure indicates that 17% of natural gas goes directly to residen- tial end-users. But a substantial fraction of natural gas (35%) also goes to electricity, and 38.5% of electrical output goes toward residential use a result of Problem 4. So the fraction of natural gas ending up satis- fying residential demands is the direct 17% plus 38.5% of 35%, adding to 30.5%. 
25: The four numbers you get should add to 100%, within rounding error. 
26: Make sure your five numbers add to 100%, within rounding error.

Keep it simple, as there is no single correct way to extrapolate this far into the future; just explain your approach. 
27: We can hope to see faster-than-linear expansion in renewables, but this question asks what would happen without dramatic changes to the recent trends.

8 Fossil Fuels 
We are now ready to dive into the core content of the book: assessing global energy demands and prospects. For most of human history, we derived energy from food-supplied muscle power of people and work animals, burning firewood, and harnessing wind and water flow (all deriving from solar energy). Then a most remarkable thing happened: the discovery and widespread utilization of fossil fuels. The abundance of energy delivered by fossil fuels profoundly changed the human condition, such that many elements of our modern world would seem like magic to someone living 200 or even 100 years ago. 
Fossil fuels still completely dominate our energy usage. Every country is reliant on some amount of fossil fuels especially for transportation. Even though fossil fuels cannot be our future due to finite resource depletion and climate change concerns it is critical that we look at these pillars of modern life, assessing what makes them both amazing and terrible, and what we might expect going forward. Facing the stark and underappreciated reality of fossil fuels will sharpen our desire to learn more about what might come after, as subsequent chapters address. 
8.1 The Most Important Plot Ever 
We have so far gained a few big-picture perspectives on the human endeavor. First, we illustrated the absurdity of constant growth in both physical and economic terms, concluding that growth must be confined to a temporary phase and will not be physically allowed to continue indefinitely. Next, we looked at population realities to understand how that story might develop. Then we looked at the scale of the universe, how minuscule Earth is in the vast emptiness, and explored the extreme

difficulties of colonization-putting the emphasis on managing our challenges right here on Earth. 
In order to frame just how important fossil fuels are and have been, we again take a broad view to put our energy trajectory in perspective before getting into the nuts and bolts of fossil fuels. The picture that emerges has the potential to reframe personal perspectives on our future. 
The result may have greater impact if you are an active participant in its creation. So get some paper, the back of an envelope, or something. Draw a horizontal axis as a timeline. Label the left edge as -10,000 years (past). The right edge is +10,000 years (future). The middle is 0 (now; see the example in the margin). The vertical axis represents global energy production, on a linear scale. For ages, this was too tiny to see poking up above the floor. Only about 200 years ago did it become visible. So for the first 98% of the way from -10,000 to 0, draw a line hugging the floor. In the last 200 years, energy usage has increased exponentially.1 So draw a smooth curve connecting the previous line into a steep rise at present (middle of the plot), using much or all of the available vertical space. 
What emerges is the classic "hockey stick" plot that applies to many physical attributes of our world: population, carbon dioxide, temperature, and in the present case-energy use. In the long flat portion of the plot, our energy came from firewood and muscle (both animal and human labor). But the sudden transformative rise is really a story of fossil fuels. Even today, having added hydroelectric, nuclear, solar, wind, geothermal, and tidal power to the mix, fossil fuels still account for over 80% of the total.2 
Let us then continue the plot in the context of fossil fuels. Being a finite resource, we know in broad terms what the curve must look like. It must drop back down to zero and ride into the future looking much as it did in the past: at zero. One may debate the exact timing of the peak of fossil fuel use, but for a variety of reasons we would be well justified in placing it sometime this century. We'll leave it to individual preference if you want to allow the curve to climb a bit more before turning down, but don't stray too far. This century ends only 1% of the way from 0 to +10,000, so don't let the peak get very far at all from the middle of the plot. Once turning down, the curve is likely to look reasonably symmetric, returning to zero in short order and staying there. 
Independent of individual choices, if keeping within reason we're all looking at the same basic plot (as in Figure 8.1): fossil fuels are a blip on the time scales we associate with history. We live in a most abnormal time, 3 
Because the upswing has lasted for generations, it seems entirely normal to most people: it's the only reality we or any person we've ever met has known. Lacking perspective, a child will view their life circumstances as normal, no matter how impoverished or privileged: it's the only world they've ever known or seen. Likewise, we accept and define our current world as normal-even if historical perspective

3: Social scientists are trained to not label their own time as abnormal, as such think- ing may reflect a sloppy bias that all people through history might be tempted to adopt. Yet, neither should we declare that abnor- mal times can never happen. Any quantita- tive assessment of the current human scale and planetary resource impact argues that we are justified in allowing ourselves an exception for the present age.

Figure 8.1 should stimulate a swarm of questions. Where are we on the curve? When is the peak? Is the decline phase marked by escalating energy scarcity, or the advent of a renewable energy future? Might the far future look more like the past (muscle and firewood) than the present? Will this plot change how we interpret the world and our own plans for the future? The only fair conclusion is that we really do not know how the future will unfold. We can label the left side as "muscle and firewood," and the spike as fossil fuels, but the only credible occupant of the right-hand side is a gigantic question mark. 
The idea of Figure 8.1 is not original to this textbook, having been portrayed in various incarnations over the last half-century or so [38]. When anyone makes a claim about what they think will happen by late-century, think about this plot. So many of our assumptions are based on the recent but abnormal past. All bets are off in defining the future. In one sense, those who rightly point out that we can't expect to be clever enough to foresee the future are correct-but perhaps in an unintentionally symmetric way. The future could be far more dismal than our dreams currently project. That would also be a surprise to many. We need to approach the future with humility, and set aside preconceived notions of where things are heading so that we can make choices now that will help define what comes next. Taking it for granted is a risky move. Only by acknowledging the potential for a disastrous outcome can we take steps to mitigate that possibility. Waving it off is the most dangerous move we could make. 
Box 8.1: Will Renewables Save Us? 
Just because fossil fuel energy must return to pre-industrial levels in Figure 8.1 does not dictate that human society must return to pre-industrial energy levels. After all, solar, wind, nuclear, hydroelec- tricity are available to us now. Yet we will struggle to match today's energy levels on these resources alone. More disturbing is the notion that we may not be able to maintain high-technology approaches in a world devoid of fossil fuels. No one has demonstrated how, yet. 
Figure 8.1: Energy over the ages, in the form of fossil fuels. Up until the present, fossil fuels capture the bulk of the human energy story. We know what it must look like in the long term as well. The huge question is how the second half of human history looks, after fossil fuels are depleted or abandoned. The yellow star is a guess as to our current position, based on evidence addressed later in the chapter suggesting that the resources are nearly halfway depleted. 
4: We can rule some things out, though, like unending growth and fossil fuels lasting centuries more.

Also, the very disruption of losing such a critical resource without adequate advanced preparation may damage our capabilities. The short answer is: we simply do not know. The question mark in Figure 8.1 is the most fair statement we can make. 
Note that Figure 8.1 is not intended to predict a particular future path. But it can serve to to counterbalance the prevailing optimism about a technologically marvelous future by providing a sanity check so that we might acknowledge that we really do not know. How can it be wrong to say that we do not know what the future holds? Yet, accompanying this uncertainty is a glimmer of hope: if the future is so uncertain and unscripted, then perhaps we have the power to write the script and set ourselves onto a viable and pleasant future path. If we elect to do so, it is of paramount importance that we do not ignore limitations imposed by nature in the process. 
8.2 Overview: Coal, Oil, and Gas 
Fossil fuels are found in three principal forms: coal, oil (petroleum), and natural gas. They are essentially a form of ancient solar energy that plants once captured and stored as chemical energy to be locked away underground for many millions of years.7 Sporadic, low-level use of fossil fuels dates back millennia, but modern use began in earnest in the eighteenth century with coal in Britain. Figure 8.2 makes clear that the use of coal did not really gather steam until the mid-nineteenth century, when industrialization took off. One may suspect that much of the rise in the use of fossil fuels is simply a reflection of population growth, but this turns out to be wrong. The right-hand side of Figure 8.2 divides the amount of fossil fuel use by global population to show that energy use per capita has also risen steeply over this time period, so that the exponential-looking phenomenon in the left panel is a combination of more people and more use per person. Today, the global average rate of use of fossil fuel use is a little over 2,000 W per person. From Figure 8.2, we may say that coal really ramped up starting around 1850, oil around 1915, and natural gas around 1970.9 
8.2.1 Coal 
8 
Coal-which looks like black rock-is the remnant of plant matter deposited, turned to peat, and heated/compressed by burial to form a mostly-carbon substance that can be combusted with oxygen to generate heat. The heat can be used to make steam, which can then power machinery or turbines for producing electricity.10 Or the heat may be used directly for materials processing, like creating molten steel in blast furnaces. 
6: Think of the three forms of fossil fuels as solid (coal), liquid (petroleum) and gas (natural gas). 
7: It is in this sense that the word "fossil" is appropriate: ancient remnants of life buried underground. 
8: 15 TW of fossil fuel use divided by nearly 8 billion people is about 2,000 W per person. Compare to the U.S. total energy appetite of 10,000 W per person. 
9: All of these sources were first used much earlier, but at insignificant levels. Natural gas makes a meaningful appearance start- ing around 1920, but heavy use began 50 years later after pipeline infrastructures were in place.

The three types are stacked on top of one another, so that gas makes the smallest con- tribution, not the biggest. On the left is the raw usage rate expressed in terawatts, while the right is a per-capita measure showing that the left-hand rise is much more than 
just a reflection of population growth [16]. 
Coal opened the door on the Industrial Revolution" in the late eigh- teenth century, allowing locomotion (trains), mechanized manufacturing, large-scale materials processing, and heating applications. Somewhat circularly, the first major use of the steam engine12 was to pump water 
out of coal mines to accelerate the extraction of... coal. This fact further highlights that from the very start, the Industrial Revolution was focused on the fossil fuel resource that enabled it. 
Today in the U.S., coal accounts for 13% of total energy consumption13. down considerably from 23% in 2000.14 For the world at large, coal still accounts for 25% of primary energy use.15 The vast majority of coal (91%) in the U.S.goes to electricity production, the remainder fueling industrial processes requiring lots of heat. The quality of coal varies greatly. Table 8.1 presents properties of the four main coal categories. Anthracite is the king of coals, but has been largely consumed at this stage. Coal grades having lower energy content contain more non-combustible materials16 like SiO2, Al2O3, Fe2O3, and water.

plastics. Virtually all transportation: planes, trains, automobiles, and ships run on petroleum-based energy. 
Petroleum first entered the modern scene around 1850, and the first drilled well18 was in 1858 in Pennsylvania. Early uses were for kerosene lamps.19 The first commercial internal combustion engine closely fol- lowed in 1859, arriving at an essentially modern form in 1876 at the hands of Nikolaus Otto.20 The first production automobile using a gasoline-powered internal combustion engine was developed by Karl Benz in 1885 and Henry Ford's Model T began mass-production in 1913. In the intervening years, electric cars surprisingly were more popular, but quickly gave way to the gasoline21 car due to superior range, quick refueling, and cost. 
23 
Today, petroleum supplies 37% of energy consumption in the U.S.22 70% of petroleum goes to transportation (92% of transportation energy is in the form of petroleum), while another 24% goes to industrial processes. Globally, petroleum usage represents a slightly smaller fraction of total energy than in the U.S., at 31% of total energy consumption.24 
The petroleum extracted from the ground is often called crude oil, and consists primarily of hydrocarbon chains of various lengths. The lighter molecules (shorter chains)-typified by octane (Figure 8.3)—are useful for gasoline, while the much heavier (longer) molecules are found in tar/asphalt, lubricants, or used as "petrochemical feedstock" for plastics. The process of refinement separates constituents by chain. length, producing gasoline, kerosene, diesel, heating oil, lubricants, tar, etc. 92% of crude oil goes to energy production of some form (burned), while 8% is used to create petrochemical products, as depicted in Figure

Petroleum is measured in barrels (bbl), equating to 159 L (42 gal). Each barrel of crude oil contains about 6.1 GJ of energy (1,700 kWh; 5.8 MBtu). For reference, the world consumes about 30 billion barrels a year (the U.S. is about 7 billion barrels per year, or 20 million barrels per day). No single country produces oil at a rate greater than about 12 million barrels per day.25 
To provide some perspective on how special/rare oil is, the chances of finding any by drilling a random spot on the planet is about 0.01%.26 This is because many geological conditions must be met to make oil: 
1. Organic material must be deposited in an oxygen-poor environ- ment to inhibit decomposition, like dead animal and plant rem- nants settling to the bottom of a still, shallow sea; 
2. The material must be buried and spend time under at least 2 km of rock, to "crack" large organic molecules into the appropriate size, like octane, for instance (Figure 8.3); 
3. The material must not go below about 4 km of rock, or the pressure will "overcrack" the molecules to form natural gas (still useful, if trapped underground); 
4. An impermeable caprock structure must sit atop the permeable and porous rock (Figure 8.5) that holds the high-pressure oil to keep it from simply escaping.27 
Oil deposits are rare and tend to be clustered in certain regions of the world where ancient shallow seabeds and geological activity have conspired to sequester organic material and transform it appropriately. The process takes millions of years to complete, and we are depleting the resource about 100,000 times faster than it is being replenished.28 
Many early oil wells were "gushers"-under enough pressure to push up to the surface under no effort. Modern extraction is not so lucky, having depleted the easy oil already. A combination of techniques is used to push or pull the oil out of its porous rock, including pumps, injecting water under high pressure, bending the drill path to travel horizontally through the deposit, or fracturing29 the underground rock via pressurized fluids. More work is required to coax the oil out of the ground as time moves forward. 
25: As a consequence, the U.S. is presently unable to support its petroleum needs from domestic resources alone.

8.2.3 Natural Gas 
Natural gas is familiar to many as a source of heat in homes (stoves, hot water, furnace), but is also a major contributor to electricity production and industrial processes (usually for direct heat in furnaces/ovens). It is also used extensively in the production of fertilizer via the Haber process.30 
Natural gas is primarily methane (CH4). Its formation process is similar to that of oil, but deeper underground where the pressure is higher and 
30: The Haber process uses the energeti- cally cheap hydrogen in methane (CH4) to produce ammonia (NH3) as a chief ingredi- ent in nitrogen-rich fertilizers.

longer-chain hydrocarbons are broken down to single-carbon methane molecules. We find natural gas trapped in underground reservoirs, often on top of oil deposits (Figure 8.5). Thus petroleum drilling operations typically also produce natural gas output.31 The gas itself tends to flow out freely once a well is drilled, since it is under great pressure and not viscous like oil. The first commercial use of natural gas started with a well in New York in 1821, leading to a pipeline distribution for street lighting in Philadelphia in 1836. Because of its low density32 compared to coal or petroleum, it is often impractical to collect, store and transport the gas, strongly favoring a pipeline infrastructure for its delivery. Lack of pipeline infrastructure delayed widespread use of natural gas until about 1970. It is also possible to liquefy natural gas (called LNG) by cooling to -160°C and then storing/transporting in cryogenic vessels. 
Natural gas constitutes 31% of energy consumption in the U.S., and 22% globally.33. Because of the need for pipeline infrastructure in order to deliver gas to consumers, remote areas are typically unable to take advantage of the resource. The uses for natural gas in the U.S. are more diverse than for coal or oil: 35% goes to electricity production, 34% for industrial purposes, and 29% for residential and commercial heating.34 
8.3 Chemical Energy 
Chemical energy is released as heat when combustible materials are ignited in the presence of oxygen. Sec. B.3 (p. 379) in Appendix B provides some background. 
Fossil fuels all work the same way, chemically. The three key reactions for coal, methane, and octane35 are:

The energy amounts above represent the total energy available per gram of input fuel.36 Table 8.2 provides several key attributes of fossil fuel combustion. Energy density, in kJ per gram or often kcal/g, is a fundamentally important measure of the fuel's potency. By expressing in kcal/g, we can compare to food labels in the U.S., for which fats are around 9 kcal/g, while carbohydrates and proteins clock in around 4 kcal/g.

Note that fossil fuels are more like fat (near 10 kcal/g) than carbohydrates (at 4 kcal/g). 
37 
Box 8.2: Superlative Energy Density 
To put these energy densities into perspective and demonstrate how amazing fossil fuels are, consider that the explosive TNT38 has an energy density of just 1.0 kcal/g. But comparing to TNT is somewhat unfair, as explosives must carry their oxygen with them.39 Hydrogen gas tops the energy density charts, chemically, at 34 kcal/g, because hydrogen is such a light atom.40 If having to carry the oxygen along, as rockets must, for instance, the hydrogen-plus-oxygen source is down to 3.8 kcal/g. Rocket fuels and explosives, in general, tend to be in this range of a few kcal/g for this reason. Aside from hydrogen, very few compounds outperform methane for energy density. So crudely, 15 kcal/g is about the top of the chemical scale. 
37: The simplest way to understand this is that carbohydrates (sugars, such as glu- cose: C6H12O6) already have oxygen in the molecules, and are in some sense already half-reacted (combusted) with oxygen, as elaborated in Sec. B.3 (p. 379). 
38: ... C6H2(NO2)3CH3 
39: An explosion is too fast-and violent- to get oxygen from the surrounding air. 
40: But hydrogen is both bulky and so highly flammable as to be dangerous to store in gaseous form (look up Hindenburg), so don't get too excited. 
8.4 Fossil Fuel Pros and Cons 
8.4.1 What Makes Fossil Fuels Amazing 
Energy Density: We have seen in Section 8.3 that the energy density of fossil fuels is quite respectable: about the best that chemistry deliv- ers. Anything over 10 kcal/g is a "superfood" energetically. Table 8.3 compares to other substances, by which we see that fossil fuels are two orders-of-magnitude more energy-dense than battery storage. 
Safety: Fossil fuels have greater energy density than explosives, without being particularly explosive! The safety aspect of fossil fuels is a big selling point. Sure, gasoline burns, but really it's the vapor mixed with oxygen that goes poof. If you (foolishly; please don't do this!) throw a match onto a bowl of gasoline, you'll certainly get some lively fire, but the thing won't explode. Only the vapor above the pool will be on fire. Think about how many cars you've seen in your life, and how many of those have exploded. How many wrecked cars have you seen, and how many of those exploded? It is not impossible to have an explosive accident from gasoline, but it's pretty rare. 
Cheap: Fossil fuels were bestowed upon us as a byproduct of biological and geological processes on our planet. They are essentially free-at least the way we have historically viewed natural resources as ours to grab. How cheap are they? Hiring a physical laborer to exert 100 W of mechanical power (digging, for instance) for 40 hours a week at $15/hr costs $600 for a week. For that price, we receive 4 kWh of work. In electricity terms, the same 4 kWh costs $0.60 at typical rates (1,000 times cheaper than human labor). Gasoline for which one gallon contains

37 kWh and costs $4—would be just $0.43. Efficiency differences, and the cost of the machine to perform the labor also factor in. But the point should be clear enough. 
Perfect Storage: Effectively, fossil fuels represent a form of long-term storage of ancient sunlight, captured in plant matter and (sometimes via animal ingestion) ending up buried underground as chemical en- ergy. Compared to other forms of storage, like rechargeable batteries, flywheels, or even hydroelectric reservoirs (pumped storage), fossil fuels are astoundingly superior. Fossil fuel deposits are tens or hundreds of millions of years old. Try finding a battery that will hold its charge that long! Seemingly permanent man-made dams/reservoirs are unlikely to last even one-thousandth as long. Combined with their superior energy density, fossil fuels are perhaps the best form of energy storage available to us, aside from nuclear materials. 
Food Production: The Green Revolution in agriculture would not have been possible without fossil fuels. Not only did they provide the motive force for mechanized farming (plowing larger tracts of land, harvesting and processing crops quickly), but the all-important fertilizer is derived from natural gas. 42 
Technology Catalyst: Fossil fuels opened the door to widespread mech- anization and electrification, completely transforming our way of life. As central as their role has been, it is difficult to claim that many 
of the benefits we enjoy today-whether health care, technology, scientific knowledge, or comfortable living standards-would have been possible without them. Much that we celebrate in this world rode on the back of 
fossil fuels. 
42: Methane (CH4) provides an energeti- cally favorable source of hydrogen to make ammonia (NH3) as a way to deliver nitro- gen to plants (called the Haber process). Water (H2O) may seem like a more obvious and abundant source for hydrogen, but in this case substantial energy would have to be injected to extract hydrogen. Methane, by contrast, will give up its hydrogen more easily. 
8.4.2 What Makes Fossil Fuels Terrible 
Climate Change: Nothing comes for free. Fossil fuels also bring many downsides. Chief on many peoples' minds today is climate change, via CO2 emission-an unavoidable consequence of combustion (Eq. 8.1). Extracting energy from fossil fuels, 43 leaves no choice but to accept CO2 as a byproduct, in large quantities. We will get to the details of climate change in Chapter 9, but for now will just say that increased CO2 in the atmosphere changes the equilibrium temperature of Earth by altering how effectively the surface can radiate heat away to space through the atmosphere. The physical mechanism is very well understood, and the amount of CO2 that fossil fuel combustion has produced is more than enough to account for the measured CO2 increase in our atmosphere. What is less certain is how the complex, nonlinear, interconnected climate systems will react, and whether positive feedbacks that exacerbate the problem dominate over negative feedbacks that act to tame the consequences. In the meantime, fossil fuels have handed us a global-scale

problem of uncertain magnitude and may end up costing us and other species dearly. 
Population Enabler: Human population pressures on our planet may also be traced to fossil fuels via agricultural mechanization and fertilizer feedstock (the Green Revolution). Since so many new global challenges- deforestation, fisheries collapse, species loss, climate change-scale with the population, perhaps all of these ills can be attributed to fossil fuels- in that it is doubtful these problems would exist at the present scale had we never discovered or utilized them. 
Military Conflict: Fossil fuels represent such a prize that access and control of the resources has played a key role in many armed conflicts. Put another way, how many have lost their lives to fights over these precious resources? It is hard to view the complex and fraught relationships in the middle-east as being disconnected from the fact that it is the most oil-rich region in the world.45 
Environmental Toll: Environmental effects from the extraction of fossil fuels can be pretty destructive. We have seen oil tankers crash and coat beaches and wildlife in tarry sludge. The Deepwater Horizon drill platform failure in 2010 spewed vast amounts of oil into the ocean. Coal extraction can leave mountaintops bare and contaminate local water sources from the tailings. Hydraulic fracturing (fracking) can contam- inate groundwater supplies. Natural gas wells including fracking sites often leak methane into the atmosphere, which is 80 times more potent than CO2 as a greenhouse gas46 on short timescales. 
Substance Addiction: Finally, the very fact that fossil fuels are finite may be viewed as a serious negative. Granted, an effectively inexhaustible supply would be devastating for the climate change story. Setting that aside, the fossil fuel inheritance might be viewed as a sort of bait-and- switch trick. We have built up to our current state wholly in the context of cheap and available fossil fuels, and simply do not know if we can continue to live at a similar standard in a post-fossil world. Fossil fuels have lasted long enough (several generations) to seem normal. We take them for granted, and have not formulated a master plan for a viable world devoid of these critical resources. How will air travel, ships, trains, and long-haul trucking47 be handled without petroleum? The current situation is precarious. Failure to plan wisely for a post-fossil world would not be the fault of fossil fuels by themselves. But the fossil fuel endowment that happened to grace our planet was large enough to harm the climate and to lull us into complacency. Had it been a much smaller amount, we would be less likely to fall into the trap. This is the "rabbit out of a hat" referred to in Chapter 2: just getting one conditions us to expect an eternal state of rabbits. 
48 
45: Countries and regions lacking impor- tant resources receive far less attention from the developed world. 
46: Although, methane does not last in the atmosphere as long as CO2. Still, this is why gas is often flared (burned) at drill sites lacking pipeline infrastructure, rather than allowing it to escape as methane. 
47: All of these modes of transportation are difficult to accomplish via electric drive (Sec. D.3; p. 397), and critical to our global supply chains for manufacture of consumer goods. 
48: By the same token, it is unlikely that we would be at a comparable technologi- cal level if our inheritance had been much 
smaller.

8.4.3 On Balance? 
Deciding whether fossil fuels have had a net-positive or net-negative influence on humanity may not be answerable (Table 8.4 provides a summary of the previous two subsections). How many lives has it saved through better technology and health care? How many lives has it destroyed through conflict, pollution, and transportation accidents? How many lives has it created, through vast increases in agricultural productivity as well as via better medical care? How many species has it destroyed, by promoting habitat loss both directly via extraction and indirectly as a catalyst to population growth via increased agricultural productivity? Sometimes it is even hard to decide which category to put these impacts into. For instance, in the fullness of time, will we see all the lives created on the back of fossil fuels as a good thing? If the result is overshoot, collapse, and the unprecedented suffering of billions of people, then perhaps not. It's a mess. 
In essence, humanity is running this global-scale unauthorized experi- ment on the planet without a plan. Nothing like this has ever happened, so we don't know how it will turn out. We have plenty of evidence that past civilizations overextend and collapsed [43], but we can't identify a fitting analog to successful navigation of the fossil fuel phenomenon. Meanwhile, plenty of signs justify grave concern. 
8.5 The Future of Fossil Fuels 
8.5.1 Scenarios 
Figure 8.1 provocatively asserts that fossil fuel use must fall back to essentially zero in a relatively short time (within a century or two). This fact alone does not define our future on the spectrum of dismal to glori- ous, but it is one we need to consider carefully given the fundamentally important role fossil fuels have played in getting us to where we are today. The return to zero fossil fuels could take a variety of forms: 
1. We discover a new form of cheap energy not yet known or appre- ciated that is a game changer, quickly abandoning the fossil fuels still left in the ground. 
2. Known renewable energy sources (solar, wind) are developed to the point of being effectively superior to fossil fuels so that market forces naturally move us away from fossil fuels before actually running out. 
3. Climate change concerns result in politically enforced financial dis-incentives to using fossil fuels, so that we migrate away-albeit likely at higher cost, politically controversial, and not globally adopted.

4. Increased difficulty in extracting fossil fuels drives their price up so that the market is ultimately forced to accept less convenient and more expensive forms of energy. 
5. We fail to find suitable substitutes to this precious and unique resource, so that global geopolitics increasingly center on compe- tition for remaining fuel, likely touching off destructive resource 
wars. 
6. Perhaps together with the previous point, society slowly grinds to a less energy-rich state, diminishing agricultural capacity and decreasing both the number and standard of living of people on the planet. 
We cannot predict which of these paths might manifest, but it is not hard to find adherents to any of these narratives. Part III of this book covers alternatives to fossil fuels, and Chapter 17 summarizes practical challenges to the various alternatives. One lesson that emerges is that fossil fuels beat out alternatives on a host of considerations, leaving a gap between the two groups. If not for the finite supply and climate ills, we would have no incentive to adopt otherwise inferior sources of energy at higher cost. But first, we should briefly look into future prospects for extraction of fossil fuels. How limiting is the physical resource? 
8.5.2 Timescales 
The simplest approach to evaluating a timescale for resource availability is the R/P ratio: reserves to production.49 The idea is very intuitive: if you have $10,000 in a bank account, and tend to spend $1,000 per month on living expenses, you can predict that-absent additional income-you will be able to go for ten months. So if we have an estimate for resource remaining in the ground, and the current rate of use, we simply divide to get a timescale. 
Table 8.5 reports the proven reserves in the world and in the U.S. for the three fossil fuels, the estimated fraction used so far globally, the rate of consumption, and the timescale given by the R/P ratio.

49: Here, "production" means "obtaining from the ground," not fabricating artifi- cially. 
50: Consumption and production are es- sentially identical: no stockpiling. 
Table 8.5: Summary of proven reserves, usage rates, and time remaining for the world and for the U.S. (if using only its domestic supply) [44-46]. Oil is measured in giga-barrels (Gbbl; 109 bbl), gas in tera- cubic-meters (Tcm; 1012 m3), and coal in gigatons (Gt; 1012 kg; noting that 1 ton is 1,000 kg). 
The world has already consumed 1.5 trillion barrels of oil, which is nearly the same amount as the 1.7 trillion barrels of proven reserves—indicating that we are roughly halfway through the resource.51 Certainly, we can expect that additional resources will be discovered and added to the

proven reserves, 52 but the globe is pretty well explored now, and we would not expect huge surprises like another hidden middle-east-size oil deposit. Note that for natural gas, the estimated total resource in the U.S. (what we think we may yet find beyond proven reserves) is about 55 Tcm, which would last just over 60 years. 
53 
It is difficult to compare the remaining resource in the three forms directly, since different units are used for each. But we can cast each in terms of energy units for comparison. Doing so, the global reserves of oil, gas, and coal correspond to 10, 8, and 20 ZJ54 remaining, respectively. We have so far consumed 8, 4, and 8 ZJ of oil, gas, and coal (Table 8.6). These form the basis of the estimated fraction consumed in Table 8.5. Note that the amount of oil and gas remaining are roughly comparable in energy, while coal is roughly twice as much. 
Coal55 therefore seems to be our most abundant fossil fuel, which prompts two comments. The first is that it is the worst offender in terms of CO2 emission, emitting roughly twice as much CO2 per unit of delivered energy as the other fossil fuels (covered in Chapter 9). The second is a caution in trusting the reserves estimates for coal, having often been vastly overestimated and then reduced significantly. For instance, Britain had to downward-revise their estimated coal reserves over the period from 1970-2000 to about 1% of their original because most of the estimated resource turned out to be in seams too thin and difficult to be commercially viable [47]. 
For some, the R/P numbers in Table 8.5 may seem alarmingly short, while for others they may signal a comfortable amount of time to devise alternative energy strategies. Either way, this century is critical. But it is also important to recognize that the story is not quite as simple as the R/P ratio. While it provides a useful scale,56 we should consider these 
nuances: 
1. The production (thus consumption) rate is not steady, but on the whole has grown over time (continued growth would shorten timescale). 
2. New exploration and discovery adds to reserves (lengthening the 
timescale), but with diminishing success lately. 
3. Advances in oil extraction technologies increase the amount of 
accessible oil (lengthening timescale). 
4. Geological challenges limit the rate of production (lengthening 
timescale but also limiting resource availability). 
5. Demand (thus production) could plummet if superior substitutes 
are found. 
Point number 4 deserves some elaboration. We should not think of fossil fuel reserves as a bank account from which we may withdraw funds at an arbitrary rate, or as a cavernous underground lake just waiting to be slurped out by whatever straw we wish to shove in. Coal, firstly, does not flow, requiring substantial physical effort to expose and remove. The 
52: Also, technological advances can make previously impractical resources available, adding to reserves. 
53: Because gas is harder to transport, and typically delivered by pipelines, domestic supply is more relevant for gas than it is for the globally-traded oil resource.

55: Coal reserves estimates [46] are bro- ken into higher-quality anthracite and bitu- minous (~7 kcal/g), then sub-bituminous and lignite (~4.5 kcal/g) varieties, totaling 480 Gt (gigatons) and 430 Gt, respectively. (see Table 8.1).

rate at which it can be removed depends on the thickness of the seam, how deep it is located, and how hard it is to dig out surrounding rock. Even oil is not in some sloshing reservoir, but permeates porous rock, limiting how quickly the viscous fluid can be coaxed to flow out of the rock and into the pump tube. Gas is the quickest to escape its rocky tomb, but at this stage the U.S. has moved to "tight gas" that does not so easily break free-forcing a technique of fracking the rock to open channels for gas to flow. The same technique is being used to access "tight oil" that otherwise refuses to be pumped out of the ground by conventional means. 
57 
In all cases, it is obvious that we would pursue the easiest resources first: the low-hanging fruit. As time marches on, we are forced to the more difficult resources. Adding to the geological factors is the simple fact that we do not possess unlimited extraction machinery, limiting the rate at which fossil fuels can be delivered from the ground. It is also worth pointing out that drilling deeper will not continue to pay dividends, as Section 8.2.2 points out that oil buried too deep will be "cracked" into 
gas. 
Figure 8.6 illustrates three variants of possible trajectories for a finite resource. The left-most panel corresponds to the R/P ratio: how long can we go at today's rate of use, if we locked in consumption at a steady value? The second assumes we continue an upward trajectory, which shortens the time compared to the R/P ratio before the resource runs out (using it ever-faster). Both of these are unrealistic in their own ways-the second one because of the physical constraints on extraction listed above (not a free-flowing resource). The third case is more realistic: a peak and somewhat symmetric decline. This is how real fossil fuel resources behave in practice. All three scenarios could create shocks to the system, but note that the (realistic) peak scenario brings the trauma of declining supplies soonest long before the R/P ratio would suggest. 
8.5.3 Clues in the Data 
Despite the uncertainties listed above, we can say for sure that Earth is endowed with a finite supply of fossil fuels, and that in order to consume the resource, deposits must first be discovered via exploration and then developed into active wells. Even in areas known to have oil,58 only about one in ten exploratory wells bears fruit. The chances of striking oil at a random location59 on Earth is in the neighborhood of 0.01%. Section 8.2.2 indicated the chain of events that must transpire to produce oil. 
A plot of the discovery history of conventional oil is revealing, seen in Figure 8.7. In it, we see that discovery peaked over 50 years ago. Since we can't extract oil we have not yet discovered-much like we can't possess an iPhone model that hasn't even been designed yet, the area under the consumption (red) curve must ultimately be no larger than

the area under the discovery data (blue). It is therefore inevitable that consumption will peak and fall at some point, by whatever means. Note that a symmetric curve peaks when the resource is half-consumed. 
The information in Figure 8.7 can also be re-cast to ask how many years remain in the resource. For any given year, the total remaining resource can be assessed as the cumulative amount discovered to date minus the cumulative amount consumed. Then dividing by that year's annual production (same as consumption) rate produces an estimate of remaining time (the R/P ratio again). Figure 8.8 shows the result.

Figure 8.7: Historical discovery rate of con- ventional oil (blue), measured in billion bar- rels (Gbbl) discovered each year [48]. The red curve shows annual global consump- tion of conventional crude oil. Until about 1985, we tended to discover more oil than we used each year, but the rate of discovery peaked decades ago and is now in decline as we complete the job of exploring Earth's re- sources. The blue area is made equal to area under the red curve, which itself represents the amount of oil used to date. This effec- tively means that we have used all the oil discovered up to 1976, and are now left with a dwindling bank account (oil reserve)—our annual income (new discovery) being less than our spending (consumption).

We have seen this story play out numerous times within oil-producing regions. Discovery of oil in the North Sea put the U.K. into the oil business about 50 years ago (Figure 8.9). At first, the discovery rate was brisk, followed by 20 years of modest discovery. It appears that nothing is left to find, as discoveries have stopped. The production shows a double-peak structure maybe echoing the discovery lull around 1980- but in any case is nearing the end of extraction. Only about 6% of the discovered oil (effectively that discovered after 1996; unshaded in Figure 8.9) is left: not much remains to pump out.

The U.S. experienced a similar history (Figure 8.10) in that discovery of conventional oil peaked around 1950, and production peaked two decades later, around 1970. Nobody wanted this to happen, although some oil geologists (notably M. King Hubbert) pointed out its inevitability based on the preceding discovery peak and simple logic.60 The U.S. had been the largest oil producer since the dawn of the oil age, and was now slipping.61 The peak and subsequent fall caused great anxiety and stimulated tremendous effort to find and develop additional oil resources, leading to the discovery of oil at Prudhoe Bay in Alaska-responsible for the second (lower) peak in the mid 80s. But then the decline resumed for another couple of decades, to the chagrin of many." 
62 
60: Still, the prevailing attitude was one of denial, until it actually happened. 
61: This is a large factor in the prosperity of the U.S.: it was the "Saudi Arabia" of the first half of the 20th century, leading oil exports and expansion of automotive transportation. 
62: To reiterate a key point: it wasn't for lack of will or effort.

Something unexpected happened next, which may serve as a cautionary tale to those who might attempt confident predictions of the future. The "fracking" boom opened access to "tight" oil deposits that were previously untenable for conventional drilling. The history is shown in Figure 8.10. 
How long will the fracking boom last? One aspect to appreciate is that conventional wells take something like a decade to fully "develop,"63 and even after individually peaking continue to deliver at diminishing rates for many years. Notice the approximate symmetry of the curve64 in Figure 8.10 and its slow decline phase prior to 2010. Fracking "plays"65 are fast: once the small region has been fractured and pumped, the whole process can be over in a matter of a few years. Thus it is certainly possible that the fracking boom on the right-hand-side of Figure 8.10 will end as abruptly as it started the easy plays being exploited first, leaving less productive fields to round out the declining phase of this boom. In any case, declaring the current state of oil production in the U.S. to represent a "new normal" seems premature. 
Figure 8.10: U.S. oil production history (blue; from [49]) and consumption history (red; from [34]), in both million barrels per day (left axis) and billion barrels per year (right). The conventional production peak is visible around 1970, a second peak around 1985 from Prudhoe Bay in Alaska, and fi- nally a dramatic upturn due to hydraulic fracturing practices in the last decade. The gap between blue and red curves is made up by imports. The downturn in fracking pro- duction in 2020 coincides with the COVID pandemic, so it is not clear whether U.S. oil production will resume the climb or if we are past the peak. 
63: By develop, we mean populate the de- posit with multiple drill sites and pumps. 
64: Note that the curve is an aggregation of many hundreds of individual wells whose individual production rates rise and fall on shorter time scales.

8.5.4 Geopolitics 
Another wrinkle worth mentioning is the geopolitical angle. Much of the world's proven reserves are not owned by the countries having the highest oil consumption. Figure 8.11 shows which countries hold the largest stocks, with a caveat that the deposits in Venezuela and Canada are heavy oils,66 which are harder to extract and refine into lighter forms like gasoline, making the middle-east (Saudi Arabia, Iran, Iraq, UAE, and Kuwait) the "real" leaders of light67 crude oil dominated by the more useful shorter-chain hydrocarbon molecules like octane (Figure 8.3). One thing that should cause Americans alarm is to go around the circle looking for close allies. Aside from Canada, with its inconvenient heavy-oil, the picture is not terribly reassuring. Proven reserves of oil in the U.S. amount to 35 billion barrels. At a consumption rate of 20 million barrels per day, the math suggests only 5 years, if we only used our own supply. The proven reserve, however, is a conservative number, often short of estimated total resource: exploration can add to proven reserves. The estimated resource in the U.S. is closer to 200 Gbbl, which would last a little less than 30 years without imports at the present rate of consumption. These short timescales offer some relief for climate change concerns, but perhaps represent bad news for global economies utterly dependent on fossil fuels.

Figure 8.11: Distribution of proven oil reserves by country, on left, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. The oil in Venezuela and Canada is heavy oil, harder to extract and process than the light oil characteristic of the middle-east. At right is the oil consumption by country for the top ten consumers (U.S. EIA). Note that the U.S. possesses 2% of the oil, but consumes about 20% of annual production, and an overall lack of correlation between who has oil and who needs it. 
68 
Because the rate of extraction can be a limiting factor, it often happens that the rate of production begins to slow down (peaks) around the time half the resource has been exhausted, producing a symmetric usage curve over time. This suggests that the peak can occur well before the timescales resulting from the R/P ratio, as depicted in Figure 8.6. Once the world passes the peak rate of oil production, a sequence of panic-driven damaging events could ensue, making it more difficult (less likely) for us to embark on a renewable-centered post-fossil world. Boxes Box 8.3 and Box 8.4 paint scenarios that cause concern.

Box 8.3: Resource War 
Imagine the scenario in which oil prices climb from their current $50/bbl to $100/bbl.69 Some major oil-producing country-seeing the writing on the wall that this precious resource is only going to become more valuable as supplies inevitably diminish-will decide that its economy was doing just fine at $50/bbl, so can sell half as much at $100/bbl and have the same income. Removing that oil from the market pushes oil prices up further to $150/bbl, at which point other countries may begin playing the same game, but now selling a third as much oil for the same income. The resulting domino effect will cause international crisis, and some military power, acting as the world's police,70 will step in to ensure continued flow of this vital global resource. Other countries possessing military strength will object to this one country's presumption and control of important segments of the global oil supply, and might potentially engage in a resource war. Sadly, this turn of events would consume massive amounts of energy and other resources to destructive ends, rather than channel these resources into constructive activities like building a post-fossil renewable energy infrastructure. 
69: Oil has been as high as about $160/bbl, in June 2008 (inflation-adjusted for 2020). A compelling argument can be made that the stress of high oil prices on many sec- tors of our economy provided a trigger for the financial crisis-putting an end to the growth-fueled bubble in the sub-prime housing market. 
70: This hypothetical country may also have built numerous military bases in the middle-east, in anticipation of this day. 
Box 8.4: The Energy Trap 
If we find ourselves in a state of annual decline in 
energy resources— having clung too tightly to fossil fuels as a cheap and largely superior energy resource—we will have a hard time politically pulling out of the dive, because to do so means transitioning away from fossil fuels via a renewable infrastructure. But such an enormous enterprise will require substantial energy investment. And energy is the very thing in short supply. To embark on this transition, the society would have to voluntarily sacrifice even more than they already are in the energy decline crisis by diverting energy toward the decades-long initiative. The temptation to vote for a politician who would end the program and bring instant energy relief in the short term may be overwhelming. In other words, we could find ourselves in an energy trap. Witness the difficulty the world is having weaning itself off of fossil fuels despite obvious perils in the form of climate change. If it were easy, cheap, and superior to move to renewables, it would have already happened in a heartbeat. Maybe we're stuck on the flypaper. 
This notion is further explored in Sec. 18.3 (p. 310). 
8.6 Upshot: Amazing, Terrible, and Limited 
History may very well view this time period as the Fossil Fuel Age rather than the Industrial Age. Fossil fuels are a ubiquitous and defining characteristic of this unusual time. The current level of technology,

global population, or impressive state of knowledge would not have been possible without fossil fuels. We therefore owe a great debt of gratitude to these three amazing resources. Perhaps the first species on any planet to discover and use fossil fuels will follow a similar madcap trajectory and even temporarily poke into space, as we have. 
Yet fossil fuels bring a number of downsides, like climate change, po- tential population overshoot (and associated myriad pressures on the planet), pollution and environmental damage. More subtly, a near- complete dependence on fossil fuels has transformed human expecta- tions in a way that could result in failure to adapt once they are no longer available. Superior substitutes are not guaranteed, and inferior replacements may not be gracefully adopted. 
One thing we know for sure about fossil fuels is that the supply is finite. We are arguably approaching the halfway point?2 in extraction, and have naturally harvested the easiest deposits of the resources. As extraction gets harder, supply-rate (relative to demand) may become the limiting factor well before the R/P ratio says we will "run out" (see Box 8.5). Recall that fossil fuels are not situated in the equivalent of a single bank account permitting withdrawals of arbitrary size and speed. 
Box 8.5: Running Out One Day? 
Fossil fuels will not abruptly run out one day, or even one year (see Figure 8.6). Production will taper off slowly over decades as ever-smaller deposits are harder to access and extract. In this sense, "running out" of fossil fuels will not be a sudden, jarring event in human history that sends us into a panicked chaos. Nonetheless, passing the peak and having less available with each passing year creates its own set of hardships. In the best scenario, alternatives ramp up fast enough to offset declining fossil fuel supplies. But the challenge is enormous, and success is far from guaranteed. 
Given the important role the diminishing fossil resource plays in our world, today's insignificant contribution from renewable sources-as presented in Chapter 7-is all the more worrisome. This fate has been apparent to many for at least 50 years, but fossil fuel use has only continued to increase, while growth of alternatives has been lackluster. Part of the reason has to do with the low cost and amazing convenience of fossil fuels compared to alternatives.73 Another part is lack of awareness. Sometimes old yet no less important-stories have trouble maintaining currency in our news-oriented society. 
Box 8.6: Why Not Raise the Price? 
If continued reliance on fossil fuels is risky-both from resource 
71: It is plausible that fossil fuels would be a common result of billions of years of evo- lution, resulting from buried biological mat- ter on planets supporting rich ecosystems- Earth being the only one we know about (see Sec. 18.4; p. 312).

73: One is justified in asking why prices are not raised to discourage fossil fuel use and catalyze development of alternatives. See Box 8.6.

scarcity and climate change points of view-then why do prices remain low, serving to encourage continued use and hinder adoption of alternatives? Why doesn't the government raise the price? 
The rookie mistake here is assuming that adults are in charge. Markets are in charge. Governments may impose taxes and tariffs, but cannot go overboard before voters74 object. Global competition without global government penalizes those countries self-imposing additional costs on their citizens. And finally, short-term sacrifice for long- term benefit is not a human strong suit-especially in the face of uncertainty. Convincing people of a future problem that has never surfaced for generation after generation turns out to be hard.

8.7 Problems 
1. Make a zoom-in75 of Figure 8.1 showing the central fossil fuel spike. You could have it "leave the floor" around 1850, reach a peak maybe at 2050 (fine for the purposes of this problem), and return to zero in symmetric fashion. Now draw-perhaps using a different color-the part of the curve you've lived through, and project out using a dotted line the part of the curve you think you'll live through (over the peak?). Now draw a segment representing your parents, and do the same for your grandparents and great grandparents. You'll end up with overlapping lines." Don't worry about exact dates; we're just looking for a visual impression. Has anybody you've ever met known any period but the rapid growth phase in energy you've experienced in your life? 
76 
2. If you had to fill in the big question mark in Figure 8.1 with a prediction of the scenario you think is most likely to result in a few thousand years, what would you say? How do you think humans will live?78 This is really an exercise to make us think about possibilities: no one knows the "right" answer. 
3. If for some reason we are grossly mistaken about the amount of fossil fuels remaining, and have 1,000 years instead of ~100 left, how qualitatively different would Figure 8.1 look? 
4. Today, 20% of energy comes from non-fossil resources. Redraw Figure 8.1 under the condition that we manage to hold on to this capability indefinitely, after fossil fuels are gone. 
5. Guided by Figure 8.1, how do you think humans 200 years from 
now will view the period from 1900-2100? 
6. It is fair to say that the scientific consensus has held for a while that curtailing our use of fossil fuels would be in the best interest of the planet. From Figure 8.2, report on what has happened to

global fossil fuel use (total, not per-capita) during the last 20 years. 
7. Coal usage in the U.S. has declined dramatically in the last 20 years as natural gas has replaced much of the electricity production from coal. What does Figure 8.2 say about the global coal trend during this period? 
8. As we exploit the best coal resources first, working our way from the premium Anthracite towards Lignite (Table 8.1), will we need to mine more coal, or less, to achieve the same energy output from coal, in terms of mass removed? 
9. Referring back to Fig. 7.2 (p. 105), deduce what fraction of the 38.3 qBtu electricity budget derives from coal. How much would the U.S. need to reduce its electricity dependence if we suddenly stopped using coal? 
10. Octane is C8H18. On either side is heptane and nonane, containing 7 and 9 carbons, respectively. Referring only to Figure 8.3 and recognizing the pattern, what would the chemical formulas for heptane and nonane be, in the form of CxHy? 
11. The U.S. uses approximately 20 million barrels of oil per day, and has a population of about 330 million people. On average, then, how many barrels per year is one person responsible for consuming?79 
12. If an average American is responsible for consuming a barrel80 of 
oil every 18 days, what power does this correspond to, in Watts? 
13. Using the values in Table 8.2, compute the energy content of a gallon of gasoline assuming that octane (C8H18) is a good repre- sentative, energetically. Express your answer in both MJ and kWh. One gallon is 3.785 L and in the case of gasoline has a mass of 2.8 kg.81 
14. Every day, Americans use about 9 × 108 J of energy per person. Since we know that 37%, 13%, and 31% of this comes from oil, coal, and gas, respectively, use Table 8.2 to figure out how much mass of each is used per day on American's behalfs, and take a moment to compare to equivalent-mass volumes of water to provide familiar 
context. 
15. What if we could get our energy from drinking gasoline?82 Refer- ring to Table 8.2, how many grams of gasoline83 would we have to drink daily to satisfy the typical 2,000 kcal/day diet? How much volume does this represent if gasoline is 0.75 g/mL? Relate this to a familiar container for holding liquids. 
84 
16. One liter of gasoline (1,000 mL) has a mass of about 750 g and contains about 9.7 kWh of energy. Meanwhile, a typical AA battery

occupies 7.4 mL of volume at a mass of 23 g, while holding about 0.003 kWh of energy. How much volume and how heavy would a collection of AA batteries be in order to match the energy in a liter of gasoline, and by what factors (in volume and mass) is gasoline superior? 
17. A gallon of gasoline contains about 37 kWh of energy and costs about $4, while a typical AA battery holds about 0.003 kWh and costs about $0.50 each, in bulk. By what factor are batteries more expensive, for the same amount of energy? 
18. Putting the cheapness of fossil fuels into perspective, a gallon of gasoline purchased for $4 might deliver 6 kWh of mechanical energy after accounting for efficiency of the associated engine. A laborer might be expected to export 100 W of mechanical power, on average, and be limited to 8 hours per day. How many hours would it take for the laborer to accomplish the equivalent output of a gallon of gasoline? At a rate of $15/hr, how much will this cost you? 
19. A number of attempts to estimate the energy investment in our food arrive at the conclusion that every kcal of food we eat took 10 kcal85 of fossil fuel input energy, so that we are effectively eating our fossil fuels! As a sanity check, what fraction of our fossil fuel energy would have to go into food production in the U.S. if diets are typically 2,000 kcal/day and we use fossil fuels at a rate of 8,000 W?86 Does the answer seem plausible? 
20. List at least five ways in which your life benefits from fossil fuels. 
21. List at least three negative impacts of fossil fuels that most concern 
you (or explain why not, if they don't concern you). 
22. Which of the possibilities from the list on page 125 (or combination thereof) seem most likely to play out, to your mind? Explain what makes you think so. 
23. Let's say that Earth was originally endowed with one million flerbits,87 and that we have already used up 400,000 of them. We currently extract 15,000 per year. How long does the R/P ratio suggest the resource will last? 
24. Proven remaining reserves of oil, gas, and coal are 10, 8, and 20 ZJ,88 while we have used 8, 4, and 8 ZJ of each. What fraction of the original total fossil fuel resource have we already used, then? 
25. Explain, both in practical and mathematical terms, why the R/P ratio overestimates the time remaining for a resource if the rate of production (use) of that resource is continually increasing. 
26. It is hard for many people to appreciate that fossil fuels will not just

"run out one day," because they don't appreciate the substantial amount of work that must go into extracting the resource from a reluctant ground. What common, day-to-day personal experiences do you imagine contributes to this disconnect?89 
27. Simultaneously considering Table 8.5 and the lessons from Figure 8.6, what sort of timescale might you guess for when the world might see a more-or-less permanent downturn in oil production? Say how many years you think we have until a downturn and explain your reasoning. 
28. What analogy from everyday life can you think of that would help someone understand the idea that extraction of oil from the ground must be preceded by exploration and discovery of the resource, and that we can't produce more than we discover?

9 Climate Change 
Climate change stands tall among the global scale problems created by our energy appetite caused by the accumulation of carbon dioxide (CO2) in our atmosphere from the burning of fossil fuels. This chapter aims to provide a no-nonsense account of the basis for climate change that leaves little room for the kind of uncertainty often injected by (alarmingly successful) disinformation campaigns. While the response of our complex climate system is more difficult to predict in detail, the core physics is unassailable. We will see that the rise in CO2 is not at all mysterious, stemming from fossil fuels. We will also explore a few scenarios and connect the CO2 rise to temperature consequences.

9.1 The Source of CO2 
The climate change forces at play today are primarily due to increased concentration of CO2 in our atmosphere as a result of burning fossil fuels. 
The chemistry is unambiguous (Eq. 8.1; p. 121): energy is released when fossil fuels are combusted with oxygen (O2) to get CO2 and H2O. Table 9.1 extends properties of fossil fuels first presented in Chapter 8, adding CO2 attributes.

2. carbon intensity: how many grams of CO2 are produced per unit 
of energy delivered. 
While all forms produce a mass ratio of approximately 3 units of CO2 for every unit of fossil fuels, the lower energy density of coal together with its slightly higher mass ratio2 make it more than twice as carbon-intense as natural gas. 
Example 9.1.1 Roughly how much CO2 is produced from each full tank of gasoline in a car? 
A typical tank might hold about 50 L of gasoline (13 gallons). The density of gasoline is 0.75 kg/L, so that one tank has a gasoline mass of about 38 kg. Applying the simple and convenient factor-of-three ratio of CO2 mass to input fuel mass, we see that one tank of gasoline will produce something like 110 kg of CO2-not a small amount!

2: Coal produces more CO2 per gram of fuel because the other fossil fuels also con- tain mass in the form of hydrogen, which not only adds to energy production but also does not end up in CO2. 
9.1.1 CO2 Measurements 
Beginning in 1958, Dave Keeling of the Scripps Institution of Oceanogra- phy began recording CO2 concentration in the atmosphere from the top of Mauna Loa in the middle of the Pacific ocean.3 In addition to seeing annual variation due to the seasonal cycle of photosynthesis, he began to see a steady year-by-year increase in the level. The measurements have continued to the present, now known as the "Keeling Curve," shown in Figure 9.1.

Figure 9.1: In blue (left axis), CO2 measure- ments from Mauna Loa (Hawaii) for the last 60 years, showing a relentless and acceler- ating upward trend now at abut 2.6 ppm, per year [50]. Seasonal variations due to photosynthesis are seen on top of this trend. Pre-industrial levels were around 280 ppmv, so that we have added about 130 parts per million (ppm). Red dots (right axis) show global average mean temperature records over the same period [51]. Thus far, global average temperature has risen about 1°C. Note that the Kyoto Protocol in 1997 and Paris Agreement in 2015 (Box 19.4; p. 320) do not visibly curb the upward trajectory of CO2 emissions.

When the measurements started, the atmosphere consisted of less than 320 parts per million by volume (ppm), or < 0.032%. By now, we are beyond 410 ppmy. 
Measurements of trapped air bubbles in the Greenland ice sheet going back about 100,000 years and the Antarctic ice sheet going back 800,000 years indicate that CO2 has fluctuated between 180-280 ppm, reaching the higher end of the range during the warmer periods between ice ages (interglacial periods). For at least the last thousand years before the Fossil Fuel Age, CO2 held steady around 280 ppm..

We saw in Figure 8.2-repeated as Figure 9.2-a history of fossil fuel usage for the world, in coal, oil, and natural gas. Meanwhile, Table 9.1 indicates how much CO2 each fuel contributes per kilogram or Joule used. These two pieces can be combined to make an estimate of how much CO2 is emitted globally each year, and to track total CO2 emission over time. Table 9.2 and Box 9.1 elucidate how to go from the fossil fuel power figures (TW) in Figure 9.2 to CO2 atmospheric concentrations. 
Box 9.1: Computing CO2 ppm, from TW 
We will use oil as an example. In Figure 9.2, we appear to get about 6 TW from oil (5 TW from coal, 4 TW from natural gas). Multiplying by 1012 puts this in Watts (J/s) and by 3.156 × 107 seconds per year results in the annual global energy from oil in Joules: 1.9 × 1020 J/yr. Table 9.1 indicates that oil contains about 11.5 kcal/g, so the number of grams of oil used per can be determined by first converting J to kcal 
Figure 9.2: Historical use of fossil fuels worldwide, repeated from Figure 8.2 [16]. On the left is the raw usage rate expressed in terawatts, while the right is a per-capita mea- sure. The three fossil fuel types are stacked on top of one another, so that gas makes the smallest contribution, not the largest. For instance, on the right-hand-edge of the left panel, coal goes from 0 to 5 TW, oil from 5 to 11 (thus 6 TW from oil), and gas from 11 to 15, indicating 4 TW from gas. The left-hand panel makes clear that fossil fuel use is still rising dramatically, and thus CO2

(divide by 4,184), yielding 4.5 × 1016 kcal/yr, and thus 3.9 × 1015 g/yr of oil, or 3.9 × 1012 kg/yr.5 Table 9.1 shows that each kilogram of oil combusted produces 3.09 kg of CO2, translating to 1.2 x 1013 kg/yr of CO2 from oil. Incidentally, we get the same answer using 64 g/MJ from Table 9.1 and 1.9×1014 MJ/yr from a few lines up. The remainder of the work, converting to parts per million, is covered in the text and the lower part of Table 9.2.

The mass of the atmosphere is about 5 × 1018 kg, obtained by multiplying 10,000 kg of air sitting over every square meter by the 47R2 surface area of the earth. Dividing the 1.2 × 1013 kg of oil-generated CO2 by the mass of the atmosphere yields 2.4 x 10-6, or 2.4 parts per million. We are almost there. The quantity we have calculated is parts per million by mass (ppmm), not the conventional parts per million by volume (ppm). Since air averages 29 g/mol, and CO2 is 44 g/mol, the mass concentration of CO2 is higher than the volume occupation in air by a factor of 44/29, or 1.52. Thus we divide our 2.4 ppmm result by 1.52 to get 1.6 ppm. A final correction is that only half of this stays in the atmosphere, so that today we are putting 0.8 ppm, into the atmosphere each year from oil. 
Figure 9.3 shows the result of this computation as a function of time in terms of annual rate and cumulative emission. We find that even though oil and coal deliver about the same global annual energy now, the carbon-intensity of coal is much higher so that its CO2 emission dominates10 over the other sources. In fact, coal always has been the dominant CO2 producer, seen by the fact that the black curve in the left-hand panel of Figure 9.3 has always been higher than the other two CO2 sources. In total, this estimate suggests that we should see CO2 levels rising by 2.6 ppm, per year, a little over half of which is due to coal (1.4 ppm/year). 
11 
Summing up the rising contributions over time, this method of estimation suggests that we have increased the atmospheric CO2 by 123 ppm, and that 75 ppm, of this (61%) is attributed to coal (right-hand panel of Figure 9.3).

Adding all three contributions from the right-hand panel of Figure 9.3 and plotting the result on top of the Keeling Curve,12 we find astounding overlap in the shape-as shown in Figure 9.4. 
Figure 9.3: Estimated CO2 contributions from known fossil fuel expenditures based on chemistry and the assumption that half of CO2 stays in the atmosphere, while the rest is absorbed by the ocean and land. Units are parts per million by volume. The left-hand panel shows the annual addition, adding to 2.6 ppm, per year and accounting for the slope in Figure 9.1. The right-hand panel is the cumulative emission to date as a function of time essentially adding up all the annual emissions from the left-hand panel. These curves are not stacked as are the ones in Figure 9.2, so each can be read directly from the vertical axis. Note that oil and gas are still on the rise in the left-hand panel: we emit more CO2 each year than we did the year before.

The curve computed from fossil fuel use overlaps the Keeling Curve so faithfully that little mystery is left as to where the excess CO2 in our atmosphere originates. The chemistry and historical use of fossil fuels are not in dispute. The only "fudge" is in what fraction of the CO2 emitted from fossil fuel combustion remains in the atmosphere vs. being absorbed by the ocean and other "sinks." Empirically, about half stays in the atmosphere, while the rest disappears into the ocean, and into plant matter that gets buried in the ground. If unaware of the oceanic and land absorption mechanisms, we would have overestimated the amount of CO2 due to fossil fuels by a factor of two (see Box 9.2). 
13 
Figure 9.4: Fossil fuel contribution to CO2 (red) on top of CO2 measurements (blue). The red curve uses a starting point of 285 ppm, and has 49% of CO2 emissions staying in the atmosphere. The overlap is remarkably good and convincing.

Box 9.2: If We Ignored Oceans 
Reflect on what our reaction might have been had we not corrected for oceanic and land absorption: we would conclude that we have no trouble quantitatively accounting for the CO2 rise based on fossil fuels, and would be left asking why we don't see an even larger rise. In other words, it is no stretch to account for the cause of excess CO2-making it far from mysterious. If our CO2 increase were not due to humans,14 we would be left with a real mystery: then where is all of the known CO2 emission from burning fossil fuels disappearing to?

9.1.3 Chief Contributors 
Climate change is a global phenomenon. Even if all emissions came from one country or region, atmospheric circulation would spread the result around the globe-albeit more slowly across the equator. It is, therefore, a global problem. All the same, it is interesting to look at chief emitters.

Figure 9.5 indicates that the U.S. is the single country bearing the largest responsibility for cumulative CO2 emissions: roughly twice that of the second-largest (China) [52]. Today, China is the largest emitter, at 9.4 Gt per year, while the U.S. is in second place at 5.15 Gt/yr. Table 9.3 lists the top six emitters lately, accounting for about 60% of the 34 Gt per year [53].

9.2 Warming Mechanism 
The 
presence of excess CO2 in our atmosphere is undeniably from fossil fuel combustion. But how does this alter our climate? How can such a minor constituent of the atmosphere (now 0.04%) cause so much trouble? The answer lies in infrared radiation [54]. Recall from Sec. 1.3 (p. 10) that

this is the mechanism by which energy leaves the earth, the power which is governed by the Stefan-Boltzmann law P = AsurfσT4, where the Stefan-Boltzmann constant,15 σ = 5.67 x 10-8 W/m2/K4, and T is the temperature of the radiating surface, in Kelvin.

Sun's view 
The sun delivers energy to the top of the earth's atmosphere at a rate16 of 1,360 W/m2. About 30% of this light-29.3%, to be precise-is immedi- ately reflected by clouds, snow, and to a lesser extent water and terrain. The remaining 70.7% of the light intercepts the earth in a projected disk of area Aproj = πR (Figure 9.6). But the total surface area of the earth is four times this, all of it contributing to infrared radiation to space. In perfect balance,117 energy absorbed equals energy radiated: 
0.707 x 1360 W/m2 × лR2 = 4лR2σТ4. 
(9.1) 
The лR factors cancel, and we can rearrange to isolate temperature: 
Figure 9.6: Earth intercepts sunlight across the projected area of the Earth's disk (R2), while radiating from the entire surface area, which is four times larger (4πR2). 
16: This is called the solar constant [4], and will appear again in Chapter 10 and Chapter 
13.

solving to T≈ 255 K, or -18°C (about 0°F). This is about 33°C colder than the 288 K (15°C; 59°F) we actually observe as the average temperature of Earth. The 33°C difference18 is due to greenhouse gases-mostly H2O-impacting the thermal balance by preventing most radiation from escaping directly to space. 
We understand this mechanism perfectly. Being at a temperature of 288 K, the surface emission peaks at a wavelength around 10 μm.19 The atmosphere is not transparent at all wavelengths, its various absorption features depicted in Figure 9.7. The blue curve at upper right in this figure is the emission spectrum associated with infrared radiation. 
Of the greenhouse gases contributing to absorption as pictured in Figure 9.7, water vapor is the dominant player, followed by CO2. Notice that the blue solid portion in the figure20 is mirrored in white in the total absorption panel just below,21 and that the window is mostly defined by water vapor. But the right-hand-longer wavelength-side of the water window is stepped on by the CO2 absorption feature, seen more clearly in Figure 9.8. This CO2 feature is responsible for the sharp cutoff on the

Thus the smooth red curve represents the distri- bution of solar energy arriving at the top of Earth's atmosphere, while the solid red filled feature is what survives the path to the ground. The smooth blue curve (middle of the set of three) represents radiation from the ground, but only a small fraction (blue filled region) passes directly through the atmosphere-the rest absorbed by green- house gases.

If some portion of the infrared radiation does not escape to space is absorbed by the atmosphere, the planet does not cool as effectively, adding some offset to Eq. 9.2-in Earth's case 33°C. It is like the earth is wearing a blanket that raises its temperature by 33°C. Figure 9.9 illustrates the mechanism. Water vapor is responsible for ~20°C of this 33°C, and CO2 is responsible for another ~8°C, leaving ~5°C for ozone, methane, and other minor contributors (Table 9.4). Incidentally, methane (CH4) is about 80 times more potent than the same amount of CO2 as a greenhouse gas, but is at a far lower concentration than CO2, and also shorter-lived in the atmosphere before being chemically destroyed.23 We focus on CO2 because this is what human activity is changing rapidly by burning fossil fuels. The vast ocean-air interface means water concentration is impossible to control, and simply responds to temperature due to the fact that warmer air holds more moisture- becoming an important feedback agent.

Naïvely speaking, going from 280 ppm, to 420 ppm, (an increase by a factor of 1.5), might be expected to turn the 8.6°C greenhouse effect from CO2 into 12.9°C (1.5x) for a 4.3 degree human-caused warming.24 But the CO2 absorption feature at 15 um is saturated, so as CO2 is added, it becomes wider, but logarithmically rather than linearly as a function of CO2 concentration. Climate scientists often express the impact of various influences as a radiative forcing, measured in W/m2. 
Definition 9.2.1 Radiative forcing is used to describe the areal power (in W/m2) of absorbed solar energy and infrared radiation to space. Various influences or constituents each contribute their own radiative forcing. In equilibrium, a balance exists so that the net25 radiative forcing is zero. 
The average solar forcing is 
RF = 1360 W/m2 x 0.707/4≈ 240 W/m2, 
(9.3) 
sharing substantial overlap with Eq. 9.2-the factors having been ex- plained in that context. Without adding to the pre-industrial set of greenhouse gases (GHGs), we would solve for temperature26 as 
Figure 9.9: In the absence of greenhouse gases, infrared radiation has no difficulty escaping to space (left). When greenhouse gases (GHGs) are present (right), most of the infrared radiation is absorbed by GHG molecules. These molecules later release the absorbed energy as new infrared radiation, but in a randomized direction, so that some energy is returned to the ground, thereby keeping the surface warmer than it would be without greenhouse gases.

evaluating to 288 K, or about 15°C. If we add (or deduct) radiative forcing from another source, it would add (subtract) in the numerator of Eq. 9.4. The addition of CO2 over the original amount (CO2,orig; 280 ppm) generates a radiative forcing of

which is about 0.6°C larger than it was before increasing the amount of CO2. We can express this as a sensitivity: how much AT do we get for a given imbalance in radiative forcing? In this case, 0.6°C from a 2.2 W/m2 increase is 0.27°C per W/m2. But when the known feedback mechanisms are included-most of them in the positive direction-the temperature sensitivity becomes 0.8°C for every W/m2 of additional forcing: called the climate sensitivity parameter.28 
Definition 9.2.2 The climate sensitivity parameter connects the amount of warming expected for a given amount of radiative forcing. Current understanding puts this at 0.8°C per W/m2 of radiative forcing. 
Therefore, our current 2.2 W/m2 of additional (fossil-fuel added) radia- tive forcing translates29 to a 1.7°C temperature increase (Figure 9.10), which is about three times what the non-feedback calculation would provide. 
Example 9.2.1 If we double our CO2 concentration from pre-industrial levels, what would we expect the temperature increase to be? 
Pre-industrial CO2 was 280 ppmy, so doubling it adds 280 ppm, for a total of 560 ppm. The radiative forcing is then 5.35 ln(2)≈ 3.7 W/m2. Multiply this by the climate sensitivity of 0.8°C per W/m2 to get a temperature increase of about 3.0°C (would be 1°C without feedback). 
The positive feedbacks are important, and include factors like: 
1. A warmer planet means less ice (glaciers, Arctic cap), resulting in less reflected sunlight, increasing the 0.707 absorption factor in Eq. 9.3 to increase solar forcing. 
2. Warmer air can hold more water vapor-the principal green- house gas, thus driving up the nominal 33°C greenhouse gas 
contribution. 
3. A warmer environment leads to additional CO2 loss from drying forests, desertification, and accelerated decomposition of plant matter and peat. 
A few negative feedback mechanisms30 exist as well, but are outweighed by the positive feedback terms. 
Global temperature increase is already about 1.0°C [58]. Note that even if we never added another CO2 molecule to the atmosphere, the temperature would continue to rise as the ocean31 slowly catches up to the new equilibrium. We would expect the temperature to stabilize around 1.7°C higher for today's CO2 excess, according to the calculation above. Thus the climb is about 55% done. Of course, more CO2 will be added, so the eventual temperature rise is destined to be higher still.

We are now at 420 ppm, corresponding to a radiative forcing of 2.2 W/m2 and 1.7°C of ultimate temperature increase (red star). Presently, the temperature has only in- creased by 1.0°C (red circle), but will catch up to a new equilibrium once oceans warm and ice melts.

9.3 Possible Trajectories 
Launching from the data used to generate Figure 9.3, we can now play a few games to understand what our future might hold in terms of total CO2 rise and corresponding AT increases by the year 2100 under various contrived scenarios.32 
First, let's imagine that we suddenly arrest the upward climb charac- teristic of fossil-fuel usage to date33 and maintain present-day levels of fossil fuel use from now until 2100. Figure 9.11 shows what hap- pens. The total added CO2 rises to 2.75 times the current excess, to 339 ppm, 34 above pre-industrial levels. The associated radiative forcing would be 4.25 W/m2 and result in a 3.4°C temperature increase. Table 9.5 summarizes this scenario and the three to follow.

We would still add 2.6 ppm, per year from now until the end of the run in 2100, and would have accumulated a total rise of 339 ppmy, or 2.75 times the problematic amount al- ready accumulated to date. The associated temperature rise would be 3.4°C. For this and all subsequent scenarios, the plots show only the half of emitted CO2 that remains in the atmosphere.

We're already seeing serious problems emerging today, at about 1°C increase, so this 3.4°C scenario is not desirable.35 And reflect for a moment how unlikely it is that we can even arrest the climb of fossil fuel use so suddenly. It would seem that the rate of CO2 emission is destined to climb higher than it is today: we have not yet found the peak! 
The second scenario focuses on eliminating coal, since it is the highest intensity CO2 emitter,36 as Figure 9.3 makes clear. What if natural gas the fossil fuel having the lowest carbon intensity-could replace all coal applications? This is already happening-gradually-in the electricity generation sector. Countless advocates encourage such a transition as rapidly as can be accomplished. The pretend world of

simulation allows us to evaluate the best-case (and unrealistic) scenario of instant, complete replacement, to put a limit on how much benefit such a move brings. Figure 9.12 shows what happens. The rate of CO2 emission would immediately drop to 1.8 ppm/year.37 That definitely helps, but the total emission by 2100-if carrying on at today's energy demand via fossil fuels-would climb to 268 ppmy. The effect would more than double the 123 ppm, that we've already contributed to the atmosphere, and would approximately double the pre-industrial CO2 level in the atmosphere, leading to a forcing of 3.6 W/m2 and AT ≈ 2.9°C (summarized in Table 9.5). So as beneficial as the termination of coal would be, any path that involves carrying our fossil fuel use forward at today's levels even substituting the best form for the worst form-does not look promising.

The emphasis, then, should be to taper off fossil fuel use so that we wean ourselves of dependency. The transition could be fast or slow. A slower version might target the year 2100 for a full termination of fossil fuels. Figure 9.13 shows an idealization of what this might look like. Notice that the resulting curves are roughly symmetric, in that the downslope is not terribly different from the upslope. Let's pause to reflect on how incredible and fast the rise of fossil fuels has been. A descent as steep as the rise represents change at an astounding pace-which would be pretty disruptive in the best circumstances. In the absence of suitable substitutions, this would be a tremendously difficult journey, but one we may be forced to make by any number of paths.38 In any case, the eventual added CO2 would end up at 235 ppm, almost doubling what we have already emitted, and nearly doubling the pre-industrial CO2 level in the atmosphere. The forcing in this case would be 3.3 W/m2 and 
AT≈ 2.6°C. 
Reducing fossil fuel use even more quickly, tapering to zero by 2050, results in Figure 9.14. The descent is alarmingly steep, and difficult to imagine happening in practice unless major disruptions 39 force this upon us. In any case, should we manage such a feat, our total CO2

Our annual contribution would drop from 2.6 ppm/yr to 1.8 ppm/yr based on this substitution, and the total accumulation would be 268 ppm, by century's end (2.2 times the accumulation to date). The associ- ated temperature rise would be 2.9°C.

contribution to the atmosphere would be an increase of 169 ppmv, which is 37% more than we have emitted to date. Adding another~ 40%, then, seems like the best we could hope to see, but possibly accompanied by serious hardships in adapting. The radiative forcing associated with this scenario is 2.5 W/m2, corresponding to AT ≈ 2°C. 
9.4 Climate Change Consequences 
Turning up the thermostat on the planet results in too many effects to chronicle here. Obviously, the climate is impacted-in terms of storm frequency and intensity, rainfall, snowfall and water supply, season durations, and the ability of plant and animal species to adapt to the changes. The timescale over which we are changing the climate is far faster than evolution can track, except for microbial life and maybe insects, whose shorter generational turnover permits a more dynamic response. Humans are late arrivals to a long evolutionary sequence, which laid a foundation to support our lives in complex interconnected

Climate change messes with the system in such a way to prevent accurate prediction of the long-term consequences of one species or another disappearing from the web of life. 
The consequences of climate change are elaborated in many sources that are not difficult to find. Rather than try to add to the general awareness, this section in the spirit of the book-aims to provide students with some tools40 to be able to quantitatively understand how the physical world reacts to changes in radiative forcing. Specifically, we concentrate on the process of heating up11 elements of the planet, and on sea level

9.4.1 Heating Up 
Recall that the radiative forcing of 2.2 W/m2 arising from a 50% enhance- ment to the pre-industrial CO2 concentration42 is expected to result in 1.7°C of eventual warming. But measurements indicate only 1.0°C of warming so far. Is our understanding wrong? 
As we saw in Sec. 6.2 (p. 85), it takes energy to change something's temperature. When the rate of energy input43 is limited, it takes time to accomplish a temperature rise.44 
Earth is by-and-large in thermodynamic equilibrium. The sun deposits energy onto Earth at a rate of 240 W/m2, when averaged over the surface (Eq. 9.3). Prior to the modern increase in CO2 concentration, we had no additional radiative forcing from CO2 and had an average surface temperature of 288 K (15°C), as in Eq. 9.4. Because it was in equilibrium, we know that the infrared radiation from Earth must have also totaled 240 W/m2 to match the solar input.

Figure 9.15: Four steps to illustrate (in a grossly simplified way) the process of Earth adapting to an increase in greenhouse gas (GHG). Starting from the left within each panel, solar input is held constant at 240 W/m2. Most of the radiation leaving the ground-quantitatively adhering to oT1-is absorbed by GHGs (fraction absorbed indicated in GHG "cloud"), the rest escaping directly to space. Half the absorbed energy is radiated up (escaping) and half back down. The dashed arrow at right is the net radiation escaping. Integer numbers are in W/m2, and arrow widths are scaled accordingly. Ground temperature is indicated at bottom. See text for narrative sequence. 
Figure 9.15 sums up the story.45 The first panel shows the pre-industrial equilibrium condition, in which 77% of the infrared radiation from the ground was intercepted by the greenhouse gases, while 23% (90 W/m2)

directly escaped. The 77% absorbed (300 W/m2) is re-radiated equally up and down (150 W/m2 each). The net outgoing radiation matches the 240 W/m2 solar input exactly, signaling equilibrium. 
47 
Pretend that we suddenly increased the CO2 concentration to 420 ppm in one instant, which takes us to the second panel of Figure 9.15. The ground has not had time to change temperature yet, but the added GHG absorbs more of the outgoing radiation (78%). Now the numbers are not balanced. Only 238 W/m2 radiates away, leaving a 2 W/m2 net influx of energy. This is what we have been calling the radiative forcing. 
49 
After some time (third panel; representing our current status, roughly), the extra input energy starts to heat up the earth environment to 289 K (16°C),48 which cranks up the radiation leaving the ground according to the σT4 radiation law. At the same time, the higher temperature drives some positive feedback effects, putting more GHG into the atmosphere and raising the absorption fraction. Meanwhile, the imbalance has moderated to 1 W/m2 as the system edges toward a new equilibrium. 
Finally, equilibrium is re-established in the last panel of Figure 9.15, at which point outgoing energy and incoming energy are again matched at 240 W/m2. The feedback mechanisms essentially tripled the change in GHG absorption: initially a 1% bump ultimately becoming 3%. Without this effect, the system would equilibrate at 288.6 K (15.6°C),50 in which case 393 W/m2 leaves the ground, and 153 W/m2 is re-radiated from the atmosphere. 
9.4.2 Heating Earth's Skin 
Let's now understand a bit more about the process of heating up the Earth's air, water, land, and ice during the time when outgoing energy does not match incoming energy.51 We know from Sec. 6.2 (p. 85) that it takes energy to change something's temperature. For instance, it takes 4,184 J to raise the temperature of a kilogram (liter) of water by 1°C, or about 1,000 J for many other substances like air and rock. Also relevant, and not introduced before, is that it takes a substantial amount of energy to melt ice. 
Definition 9.4.1 The heat of fusion of ice is 334 J per gram, meaning that every gram of ice that goes from just below freezing to just above 52 requires an input of 334 J. 
To put this in context, that same 334 J would heat a gram of liquid water by 80°C, but gets eaten up in the phase change without changing the temperature really at all.53 
Using the properties of various constituents in Table 9.6, we can construct Table 9.7 to describe how much energy is needed to "charge up" different planetary components to a different temperature. 54 Note that the ocean.

Table 9.7: Energy requirements to heat up (thermally "charge") Earth components, de- rived from Table 9.6. The energy invest- ment for the first three components depends on the temperature change sought, while melting ice is independent of temperature change. 
Example 9.4.1 We will use the ocean as an example of how to interpret and use Table 9.7. The two numbers tell us what it takes to heat up the ocean per meter of depth and to heat the entire volume. 
If we ask how much energy it would take to raise the temperature of the upper 10 m of the ocean by 2.5°C, we multiply 1.5 x 1021 J/m/°C by 10 m and 2.5°C to get 3.75 x 1022 J. Heating the entire volume of the ocean by 0.5°C would require 5.9 x 1024 J/°C times 0.5°C for 3 x 1024 J of energy. 
Similarly but without any temperature element-it would take ~ 49 x 1021 J to melt 10 m of Earth's ice, and would take 8.8 x 1024 J to 
melt it all. 
We are now in a position to appreciate how long it can take to change temperatures on a planetary scale for a certain imbalance in radiative forcing. If, for instance, the imbalance is 1 W/m2,55 then Earth receives an extra 5.1 x 1014 J each second, or 1.6 x 1022 J in a year.56 We can compare this annual surplus energy to the values in Table 9.7 to understand how deeply the components would be heated or melted per year for a 1 W/m2 radiative forcing imbalance. 
Example 9.4.2 If we could direct all of the annual surplus 1.6 × 1022 J arising from a 1 W/m2 imbalance into one component only,57 we could ask: to what depth will each component be heated by 1°C or melt the ice?

From this, we see that land is more easily heated, and ice is most resistant-only shaving about 3 m per year if somehow the entire wrath of radiative imbalance were directed upon it. 
Likewise, we can explore how long it would take to raise the tempera- ture of entire components or melt all of the ice-for an imbalance of 1 W/m2. 
Example 9.4.3 If we could direct all of the annual surplus 1.6 × 1022 J arising from a 1 W/m2 imbalance into one component only,58 we could ask: how much will the temperature rise of the entire body be per year, or how much ice would melt? 
If the radiative forcing imbalance is larger or smaller than 1 W/m2, the effect will be proportionally deeper or shallower. Like- wise, if we ask about a temperature increase larger than 1°C, the depth would be smaller in proportion.

The atmosphere is a wimp: it takes very little to change its temperature. The ocean, however, is very sluggish to change temperature. For ice, we look at fractional loss per year instead of temperature increase. 
59 
What we learn from the examples is that the ocean and ice are both substantial thermal brakes on fast heating. Even though ice has a much larger energy cost per kg, its total mass is substantially smaller than that of the entire ocean-the two effects roughly balancing. In reality, we might expect oceanic circulation patterns to concentrate heating in the upper layers rather then distributing uniformly to the full depth. So the upper layer of the ocean-which then controls air temperature can reach a 1°C increase well before 367 years elapse. Indeed, we are already seeing warming at this scale in less than a century. 
60 
The way things really work is that the excess 1.6 x 1022 J annually associated with a radiative excess of 1 W/m2 gets distributed into lots of channels at once. If ice only gets 3% of the attention in proportion to its area, only 5 × 1020 J goes into the ice in a year. Dividing by 4.9 × 1021 J/m (from Table 9.7), we find that we might expect 0.1 m of ice to disappear each 
Since the ocean is roughly 25 times larger than the ice areas, year. the associated sea level rise from redistributing the ice melt across the entire ocean surface would be about 25 times less, or about 4 mm/yr.61 
Meanwhile, the constant, swirling contact between water and air, and between air and land, keeps all three in sync with each other: one will not race off to get hot without the others. And in this case, the ocean-with its giant thermal mass and extensive air-water interface is the limiting 
As before, this pretends that the entire ra- diative imbalance is directed upon a single component, in turn. If the radiative imbal- ance is larger or smaller than 1 W/m2, the effect will be proportionally more or less 
severe.

factor on how fast things can heat up. If we confine ocean heating to the top 300 m62 of water, the excess 1.6 × 1022 J per year leads to an annual temperature rise of about 0.035°C per year, or about 30 years to climb 1°C (at a 1 W/m2 imbalance). 
Although this section may seem to be long, convoluted, and perhaps even boring, it accomplished a number of things for us: 
1. it showed how a change in GHG absorption fraction leads to a 
radiative forcing imbalance; 
2. it indicated how a radiative imbalance changes the surface tem- perature until the earth re-establishes a new equilibrium (balance) at a higher temperature, including feedback effects; 
3. it assessed energy requirements for heating up relevant masses of 
material and melting ice via straightforward physics; 
4. it showed that the two most important thermal masses on the 
planet are the ocean (first) and the ice sheets (second); 
5. it established approximate timescales over which we might expect temperature to climb, and why the ocean in particular is important in slowing down the consequences. 
An additional insight is that even if we stopped CO2 emissions today, Earth's temperature will continue to climb as the oceans slowly ad- just to the new radiative reality imposed by 420 ppm, of CO2 in the atmosphere.

62: The ocean is such a dominant thermal player that the rate at which temperature rises depends critically on how well and deeply mixed the thermal influence is. 
9.4.3 Sea Level Rise 
The previous section covered the energetics of melting ice sheets. The resulting melt-water flows to the ocean63 and contributes to sea level rise. Besides melting ice, sea level also rises as a consequence of thermal expansion of water as it warms up. Figure 9.16 shows the recent history.

1880, sea level has risen about 230 mm At the current rate, we would expect a comparable addition by 2100 for a total of 0.5 m. 
But the current rate is not likely to be the right measure, since warming air temperatures result in a faster rate of ice melting. Positive feedbacks also accelerate ice melt. For instance, melted pools of water on top of the ice are darker than ice, increasing the rate at which solar energy is absorbed. 
We can get a quick handle on how much sea level rise might possibly be in store, based on the fact that the vast majority of "permanent" ice on the planet is in Antarctica and Greenland. These two ice sheets constitute 2.7% and 0.3% of the globe's surface area, respectively. From there, it is easy to estimate sea level rise, because the ocean (71% of the globe) has an area 26 times bigger than the Antarctic ice sheet and 210 times larger than the Greenland ice. What this means is that it takes 26 meters of ice 
melting from Antarctica64 to raise sea level by 1 meter, and 210 meters off Greenland to do the same.65 See Figure 9.17 to understand the logic here. 
64: ... if uniformly distributed across the continent 
65: In the spirit of an approximate estimate, we ignore the 10% difference in the density of ice vs. water and assume that one cubic meter of ice displaces one cubic meter of 
water. 
Now if we just knew the average thickness of each ice sheet, we could figure out how much sea level would rise if all the ice melted. The Greenland ice sheet is estimated to be 2.85 million cubic kilometers, translating to an average depth of 1.7 km.66 210 m goes into this 8 times, so we might expect something like 8 m of sea level rise if all the ice in Greenland melts. For Antarctica, the 26.5 million cubic kilometers corresponds to an average ice thickness of 1.9 km, which is about 70 of our 26 meter units, so we would expect about 70 meters of sea level rise in the extreme case of Antarctica losing all of its ice. 
Box 9.3: A more rigorous estimate... 
It is relatively easy to find references estimating sea level rise potential from complete melting of Greenland and Antarctica. One such [60] arrives at a 7.4 m rise from Greenland melting, 58 m from Antarctica, and 0.3 m from glaciers. 
So why did we go through the crude estimation process? The goal was to remove the mystery.67 Once we have an estimate of the depth and a ratio of surface areas, it is within our grasp to estimate the rise ourselves. 
Figure 9.17: If sea area is x times that of an ice-covered island, water level will rise by 1/x times the ice thickness if it all melts. The diagram shows a way to think about this, for x = 
3: by slicing the ice into x = 3 layers to redistribute the volume on top of the water. In this case, a 30 m ice sheet would raise sea level by 10 m if melted.

Coastal cities are already struggling to deal with the present ~0.25 m rise. This may not sound like much, and on normal days does not cause problems. But the low pressure associated with storms results in a local swell in water level,68 so that a storm plus high tide plus heavy waves adds to the climate-change rise to destroy human structures that otherwise may have escaped harm. Even if CO2 emissions ceased today, the warming that has already happened will continue melting ice. Temperatures will also continue to climb as increased forcing from the already-present CO2 continues to heat the ocean as we creep toward equilibrium a slow process. So sea-level rise may turn out to be the gift that keeps on giving for centuries more. 
Sea level in the distant past-tens of millions of years ago—has been as high as 200 m over where it is now. And 20,000 years ago, during the last glacial maximum, sea level was 120 m lower than it is today [62]. So Earth is no stranger to large fluctuations in sea level. By contrast, many coastal cities do not know how to handle even a one meter rise-which is within the projections for 2100 in a number of models.

9.5 What Can Be Done? 
So far, we have simply described the climate change phenomenon as an unambiguous consequence of our fossil fuel habit, but have not addressed what we might do to combat it. In this section, the author will not attempt to conceal his personal take on the matter, and will keep it short. 
First, clever geo-engineering ideas ring of hubris, and seem like solving a problem of hurtling toward the ground by digging a hole ahead of the fall fast enough to keep up. Our whole problem is that we have convinced ourselves that we can outsmart nature.69 You would stop going to a doctor who tried to treat your illness by applying superficial remedies to a resulting skin condition without addressing the underlying cause. 
In this case, the underlying cause is very simple: unchecked70 human ambitions. The combination of fossil fuels, an incessant drive for growth, destruction of forests and habitat,71 population pressures, and an in- dustrial approach to agriculture all play a role. This is why it has been hard to combat: it's us. It pervades all the things we do. We are our own adversaries. How do we fight ourselves? To do so requires honesty and even a collective willingness to sacrifice and prioritize planetary health over narrow short-term human interests. What is more important: that individuals attempt to fulfill all their dreams now, or that civilization endures for the long haul? Are we willing to dial back our own desires so that billions of future humans who we will never meet and countless other species on the planet can also enjoy life? We have never had to make such a difficult choice as a global whole, so it is hard to say if Homo sapiens can pull it off.

The last chapters in this book, beginning with Chapter 18, deal with human factors that contribute to our prospects, ending at Chapter 20 discussing mitigation strategies at the individual level. It's not geo- engineering, but behavioral adaptation leading to reduction can have a huge impact, if broadly adopted. 
9.6 Upshot: Climate Change is Serious 
Despite the ease with which we can demonstrate that the measured CO2 is from fossil fuels, and the straightforward physics governing the equilibrium temperature in the face of greenhouse gases, it is astounding that we are not fully embracing reality. But perhaps it should not be surprising. Climate change is a clear-and-present affront to some economic and political ideologies that wish we would let markets set our path, with no consequence. But operating in denial and insisting that we keep to the way things worked in the past is not our smartest play. Climate change is a stark indication that we can't just do whatever makes us the most money. Alternatives to fossil fuels are expensive and less convenient. Climate change is bad for business, and also threatens capitalism by imposing limits on our ambitions. It is little wonder that the U.S. has been among the most resistant to accepting climate change realities, being the most proud capitalist country, boasting an enormous per-capita energy demand, and having contributed the most to global CO2 emissions throughout history (Figure 9.5). 
73 
As real as climate change is, it is less clear whether it represents an existential threat to civilization.72 As costly as it may be to adapt, the changes are gradual enough on a human timescale to possibly be manageable though decidedly less than fun. 
Resource74 disruptions, however, can send markets into free-fall and stimulate global military actions that could be far more devastating on a shorter timescale. We are in a sort of a race to see which causes the biggest problem the soonest. With luck, a third option presents itself that does not involve such hardship. But just keep in mind that human society is a highly nonlinear construct that could become unrecognizably disrupted on a much faster scale than will be the case for the physics-governed unfolding of climate change.

9.7 Problems 
1. If you were asked to characterize a typical carbon cost of fossil fuels, in grams of CO2 emitted per gram of input fuel, what single simple number would be a good approximation to all three types, referring to Table 9.1?

2. How many kilograms of CO2 are produced from consuming a 40 L tank of gasoline? Compare the result to typical human mass. Gasoline is about 0.75 kg/L. 
3. Typical household electricity use in the U.S. is about 30 kilowatt- hours (kWh) per day. If the electricity is produced by a natural gas plant operating at 40% efficiency, each household requires 75 kWh of energy from natural gas each day. Converting this to Joules, and using the intensity of 49 g/MJ from Table 9.1, how much CO2 is produced daily to supply a house with electricity from a natural gas source? 
4. Americans use energy at an average rate of 10,000 W. Convert this to Joules in a day, then MJ, then use a representative number75 in the right-hand column of Table 9.1 to estimate an approximate CO2 emission per American per day, in kg. Compare this to the mass of a typical person. 
5. Getting more specific, Americans, on average, get about 320 MJ per person from oil each day, 265 MJ from gas, and 110 MJ from coal. Based on the CO2 mass per energy column in Table 9.1, how much mass, in kg, of CO2 does an American produce per day from each of these sources, and in total? Compare this daily emission to the mass of a person. 
6. If carbon dioxide emission is a chief concern, switching from a coal-fired electricity plant to natural gas input is still a use of fossil fuels, but natural gas produces less CO2 per energy unit than coal (Table 9.1). By what factor would CO2 emissions be reduced if replacing all energy76 we now get from coal with energy from natural gas? 
7. Divide the total CO2 increase by the annual CO2 increase in Figure 9.3 to get a timescale in years. Compare this timescale to the period over which we have been burning fossil fuels (e.g., Figure 9.2). Do they agree? If not, what reason would you offer? 
8. The right-hand panel of Figure 9.3 is an accumulation of the values on the left-hand side-representing the area under the left-hand curve, for instance. Since the gas trend on the left looks like a triangle, it is easy to approximate its area.77 Does the result match the right-most value for gas in the right-hand plot? 
9. According to the fossil fuel history shown in Figure 9.2, the world currently gets energy from coal at a rate of 5 TW. From this, figure out how many ppm/year we add in CO2 from coal, following the outline in Table 9.2 and Box 9.1. Use a typical coal energy density of 6.5 kcal/g and a mass ratio of 3.67 CO2 g/g.78 The result should match information gleaned from Figure 9.3.

11. What letter grade would you give to the performance of the red curve in Figure 9.4 for its faithful tracking of the measured CO2 blue curve? Describe reasons why you might deduct any points. 
12. The allocation of CO2 emissions among countries in Figure 9.5 differs pretty markedly from the distribution in Table 9.3. What does this tell us about past and present activity among countries? 
13. Use a modified version of Eq. 9.2 to compute what the earth's temperature would be if it had no greenhouse gases and absorbed 100% of incident solar energy. 80 
Is this warmer or cooler than the actual average surface temperature (given GHG and ~30% reflection)?81 
14. Based on Figures 9.7 and 9.8, is the atmosphere transparent or opaque at a wavelength of 1.0 um? What about at 6 μm? And how would you characterize the situation at 2 um? 
15. If enough ice on Earth melted and resulted in 25% reflectance instead of 29.3%, what would the equilibrium temperature become, still applying the nominal 33 K GHG contribution? How much temperature rise is this compared to the equilibrium temperature at 29.3% reflection? 
16. Table 9.4 has H2O as the leading greenhouse gas, and all of them adding to 33 °C of warming effect on Earth. Should it be our goal to reduce all of these effects to the lowest numbers possible?82 Why or why not? How would you characterize the greenhouse effect and why it is of concern to us? 
17. Treating Figure 9.9 somewhat literally, in which one out of every four infrared photons escapes without being absorbed by a green- house gas molecule, what would the effective upward radiation be if 400 W/m2 left the ground, and re-radiation of the absorbed fraction was split equally between upward radiation and radiation returning to the ground?83 
18. If the "bad" news that we are about halfway through the fossil fuels is wrong, and we are only one-quarter of the way through, and we end up using all of it, what would the ultimate CO2 concentration be in ppm, extrapolating the increase so far? How many degrees would this turn into based on our understanding of radiative forcing and the climate sensitivity parameter? 
19. Using Eq. 9.5 and CO2,orig = 280 ppm, together with a climate sensitivity parameter of 0.8°C per W/m2, how much would you predict Earth's temperature to rise for CO2 levels of 330, 380, 430, 480, 530, and 580 ppm, 284 The inputs increase by steps of 50

20. Which of the following are positive vs. negative feedback effects 
for climate change as a result of warming, and why? 
a) warming tundra releases methane trapped in the permafrost b) more water in the atmosphere creates more clouds and 
increases the amount of sunlight reflected from Earth 
c) an increase in forest fire activity burns lots of carbon-based 
material and leaves a blackened earth 
d) snow covers less of the land each winter as temperatures rise 
21. Coal is, and always has been, the worst offender of the fossil fuels in terms of CO2 emission. Based on the scenarios summarized in Table 9.5, what is the percentage reduction in final temperature rise (AT) based on emissions out to 2100 (in the case that we hold steady at today's fossil fuel levels) if we substitute natural gas for all uses of coal vs. if we keep things the same? 
22. Which of the scenarios in Section 9.3 do you deem to be most realistic, and why? Given this, how much more eventual warming is likely in store compared to the 1°C to date? 
23. Verify for each panel in Figure 9.15 that the sum of the upper two arrows in the middle of each panel and the difference of the lower two arrows in the middle match the effective (dashed) arrow at the right (a total of 8 comparisons). 
24. Construct your own panel in the manner of Figure 9.15 correspond- ing to the third case in Section 9.3 in which we curtail fossil fuel use by 2100, resulting in a final equilibrium AT of 2.6°C (thus 290.6 K ground temperature). Characterize the final equilibrium state, when net upward radiation equals solar input. After balancing the books, figure out what the GHG fractional absorption must be (the number in the "cloud" in Figure 9.15). 
25. On a sunny day after a big snowfall, the (low winter) sun might put 500 W/m2 onto the ground. Snow reflects most of it, but let's say that it absorbs 5% of the incoming energy. How much snow (ice) will melt in an hour from the absorbed energy if a cubic meter of snow has a mass of 100 kg? 
26. If the ocean absorbs an additional 3 W/m2 of forcing,8% how long would it take to heat the ~4 km deep column of water directly under a particular square meter (thus 4 x 106 kg) by 1°C?87 
27. Based on Table 9.7, if we could magically turn off infrared radiation to space, how long would it take for the sun's 240 W/m2 average to heat the entire ocean by 1°C? It is fine to assume that the ocean covers the whole globe, for this limiting-case calculation.

forcing is 3 x 1022 J per year. How much would the temperature of the top 10 m of ocean rise in one year at this level? 
29. If we somehow maintained a steady 2 x 1022 J/yr of unbalanced 
input indefinitely, how long would it take to: 
a) raise the entire ocean temperature by 1°C? 
b) melt all the ice? 
c) raise the entire atmosphere's temperature by 1°C? d) heat up the top 100 m of earth's land area? 
The sum of all these is how long it would take to get all of these tasks done, even though they would be happening in parallel. 
30. On a planet 60% covered in ocean, and 5% covered in a 3 km thick ice sheet on top of land, how much would the sea level rise if all the ice melted? 
31. On a planet two-thirds covered in ocean, and 1% covered by an ice sheet melting at a rate of 1 meter per year, how fast would sea level be rising? 
32. How might you express the tradeoffs between the available fossil fuel resource and climate change? In other words, if it turns out that we don't have nearly as much fossil fuel as we think, what does this mean for climate change vs. our economic/geopolitical stability and viability? On the other hand, if we have centuries of fossil fuels left, what does that mean? Which scenario is least disruptive? 
33. If it were certain that the only way to provide a comfortable exis- tence to future generations involved substantial cutbacks toward a lifestyle having far fewer energy and material comforts today, do you think humanity would voluntarily do so? Can we leave treats on the shelf, within easy reach? If so, is it only uncertainty that prevents us? If not, what do you see as the barriers?

In practice, this is not how things will go. The ocean will heat up more near the surface, allowing air to get hotter and ice to melt faster while the deep ocean stubbornly resists warming for centuries.
