This version of the book-available for free in digital form at https:// escholarship.org/uc/energy_ambitions-is prepared for electronic viewing: not differentiating between left and right pages, and thus not ideal for printing. A two-sided version better-suited for printing is also available at the aforementioned site. Most graphics in this version are vector-based and can be safely magnified to alarming proportions.

This book makes extensive use of margin space for notes,1 citations, figures, tables, and captions. Hopefully, the utilization of margins leads to a smooth reading experience, preventing parenthetical, contextual information from interrupting the flow of primary text.

References to figures and tables, glossary items, citations, chapters and sections, definitions, boxes, equations, etc. are hyperlinked within the electronic PDF document2 allowing easy navigation, appearing as blue text. To help navigate in print versions, references to material outside the chapter also include page numbers. Note that the page numbering in this electronic version differs from that in the two-sided print versions.3

The electronic version of this book is far easier to use once figuring out how to navigate "back" within the PDF viewer, so that a link-or even several in a row-may be clicked/tapped, followed by a painless return to the starting point that may be hundreds of pages away. It is therefore strongly recommended that you figure out how to navigate using your viewing platform. For instance, viewing the document in Adobe Acrobat on a Mac, the back and forward functions are accomplished with cursor/arrow keys as - and -→ In Mac Preview, H-[ and H-] go back and forward. Some mouses especially those for gaming-have additional buttons that map to forward/backward navigation.

Call-out boxes indicate places where a student might enhance their understanding by engaging in personal exploration. An information symbol() in the margin is occasionally used-mostly in Problems sections to denote supplemental content that build useful contextual links to the real world but may otherwise obscure what the problem seeks. A caution symbol (A) appears when an argument is being put forth that is likely faulty or nuanced. Students should be careful to avoid literal acceptance of these points and work to understand the subtleties of the argument.

This electronic version contains a Changes and Corrections section that lists any modifications since the original release the relevant dates being provided on page ii. Within the text, a red square■ marks the location of a change, the square being hyperlinked to the corresponding entry describing the change, which itself has a hyperlinked page reference

1: Numbered notes point to a specific loca- tion in the text.

Non-numbered notes are general asides re- lating to the paragraph.

2: A link to the electronic document is in the first paragraph, above.

3: due to the two-side rule that new parts or chapters start on right-side pages, often leaving empty (even-numbered) pages

4: ... much like the "back" button in a web

browser

5: Learn how to navigate "back" in your PDF viewer to make hyperlinks within the document more attractive.

A number of the examples (set apart in yellow boxes) are not posed in the form of a traditional question, but rather appear as a statement that captures a quantitative instance of the concept at hand. From this, students can construct multiple different questions that omit one piece of information and then solve for it using the remaining numbers. In this way, the example becomes a versatile guide to understanding. Note also the convention that≈ is used to indicate "quantitatively very close to," while ~ represents a less precise numerical value that might be read "in the neighborhood of," or "roughly."

After the primary presentation of material, an Epilogue attempts to put the tone of the textbook in context as it relates to the challenges ahead.

Appendices include supplemental information on math, chemistry, worthy tangents, and a partial answer key for problems. The answer key is constructed to discourage shortcuts. Rather than give direct numerical answers, for instance, it often provides a range within which the answer is expected to lie. In this sense, it acts more like an intuition transplant, guiding more likely correct analysis in a manner closer to the way an expert operates. This approach allows students to at least catch any glaring errors in approach, like dividing rather than multiplying, for instance.

The Bibliography at the end applies to the whole book. Clicking on a green reference number navigates to the reference entry. Each reference indicates the (hyperlinked) page or pages on which the reference is cited. Many of the entries contain hyperlinks to online resources. The ability to navigate "back" from these explorations is very useful.

A Notation section after the bibliography provides an overview of physical constants and symbols used in the text, unit pre-factors, and a table of Greek letters.

A Glossary provides a collection of important terms encountered in the text. Hyperlinked words in the text (appearing blue) lead to the glossary, whose entries are also often internally linked to other glossary items. Additionally, page numbers where entries appear in the text are linked to easily navigate to them. The "back" navigation feature is extremely helpful in this context for returning from a rabbit hole of exploration.

Finally, a full alphabetical Index appears at the end to facilitate finding information in non-electronic versions of this text.



The graphic below reflects all chapters by page count, suggesting a few different ways to approach this book. Just reading the "Upshot" for each chapter, and possibly the first few introductory paragraphs for each will convey a decent overview of the book's contents. The core message can also be picked out based on the guide below. The book has a definite quantitative slant, so it will not be possible to avoid math-laden sections completely, but the guide can help find the less numerically intense sections. Finally, different class formats might take various routes through the material, as suggested above.


6: Experts often have a pretty good sense of the answer even before a detailed analysis, which serves as a way to identify possible mistakes and force a closer look.

References often provide convenient links to data collections in the form of Wikipedia pages. Primary references are easy enough to track from there.

7: ... and in some cases singles out individ- ual sections by size and position within the chapter
