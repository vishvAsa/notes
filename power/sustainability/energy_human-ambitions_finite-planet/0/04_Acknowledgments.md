I thank Brian Siana, David Crossley, and Barath Raghavan for extensive review and substantive suggestions on elements of the text. Allegra Swift offered tremendous help on permissions and open access publishing.

The first draft of this book was written in late 2019 and early 2020 for use in the Physics 12 general-education course on Energy and the Environment at UC San Diego in Winter quarter 2020. Students were presented with one chapter at a time in PDF form, lacking margin notes, having fewer figures and tables, and containing untested content. As part of weekly assignments, students were to read each chapter and offer substantive feedback on: confusing elements; missing content that would be interesting to include; ideas for additional graphics or tables; anything that seemed wrong or of questionable veracity; a critique of problems (for clarity, value, level of difficulty); and any typographical errors or wording suggestions. The voluminous feedback that resulted has been extremely valuable in shaping the current iteration of the book, so that each student in the class deserves acknowledgment here for hard work and keen insights.
