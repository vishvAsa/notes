title = "D 1 Edge of the Universe"

Sec. 4.1 (p. 54) built a step-wise scale out to the edge of the visible universe, which a margin note clarifies as the visible horizon of our universe. This fascinating and deep concept deserves elaboration. 

Two foundations of experimental physics and cosmology are that the speed of light is finite, and the universe began in a Big Bang 13.8 billion years ago. Ample evidence supports of both claims. It should be noted that these notions were not at all accepted by scientists until the preponderance of evidence left little choice but to adopt them as how the world really appears to work. 

The finite speed of light means that looking into the distance amounts to looking back in time. Here, Imperial units have a brief moment of glory, in that every foot of distance (0.3 m) is one nanosecond of time. We see the moon as it was 1.25 seconds "in the past," the sun as it was 500 seconds (8.3 minutes) ago, and the nearest star 4.2 years back. The "nearby" Andromeda Galaxy is 2.5 million years in the past, and as we peer farther into the universe we look ever farther back in time. Indeed, at great distances we see infant galaxies in the process of forming as gravitational vacuum cleaners collecting materials from the diffuse gas that came before. 

So what happens when we look 13.8 billion years into the past, when the Big Bang is alleged to have happened? Shouldn't we see the explosion? And shouldn't it-perhaps confusingly-be visible in all directions? 

The answer is a resounding, though qualified, YES. Yes, we see evidence of the Big Bang in all directions, as a glow that appears in the microwave region of the electromagnetic spectrum. The Cosmic Microwave Background, or CMB, as it is called, represents the glowing plasma when the universe was just 380,000 years old and about 1,100 times smaller than it is today. We cannot see earlier than this because the hot ionized plasma [[392]] that existed before this time is opaque1 to light travel. The universe only became "clear" after this time, when the plasma cooled into neutral (mostly) hydrogen atoms. So we can see almost back to the Big Bang, at least 99.997% of the way before the scene becomes opaque. 

So that's the limit to our vision, based on the idea that light has not had time to travel farther since the universe began. This is what we mean by the edge of the visible universe. 

But is it a real edge? All indications are that it is certainly not. When we look 13.8 billion light years away, we just see this glowing plasma (the CMB). But in the intervening years, galaxies and stars and planets have formed in that region of space, and would appear "normal," or mature today. So imagine a being on such a planet looking at us today, 13.8 billion light years distant. But they see us 13.8 billion years ago, when our neighborhood was still a glowing plasma well before the formation of galaxies, stars, and planets. 

Let's say the distant being is directly behind you and you are both looking off in the same direction-the alien essentially looking over your shoulder as you look directly opposite the direction to the alien. You (or the primordial gas that will someday become you) are at the limit of their vision, and they can't see anything beyond you. You sit at their edge. But to you it's no edge. You have no trouble seeing more "normal" universe stretching another 13.8 billion light years beyond what our distant friend can see. It's only a perceived edge, based on the limit of light travel time. 

A nice way to think of it is familiar scenes of limited vision, like in a fog or in the ocean, or even on the curved surface of Earth. All cases have a horizon: a limit to the distance visible. Yet moving to the edge of vision reveals a whole new region that was before invisible. Keep going and your starting region will no longer be visible, or within your horizon. But it has not ceased to exist. 

Similarly, the universe would seem to be much larger than our visible horizon. Measurements of the "flatness" of the geometry of space suggest a universe that is at least 100 times larger than our horizon, and may in fact be unfathomably larger. We may never know for sure, as limits to light travel seal us off from direct observation of most of the universe.+++(5)+++
