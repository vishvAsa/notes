+++
In a sense, humanity is going through an awkward adolescent phase: growth spurts, a factory (pimple) strewn landscape, an attitude that we have all the answers - adults[^55] can't possibly understand or tell us what to do. 

[^55]: ... in this case hypothetical wise humans who have managed a successful transition through the adolescent phase

Conversely, nature is mature.[^56] Ignoring recent human influences, it had already forged its complex, never perfect, but functional interdependencies and had settled into something resembling a steady state. 

[^56]: Note the similarity of the words!

Adolescents new to the scene may be hugely disruptive and destructive, and unless they change their ways, civilization drives straight into the jaws of failure. The adolescents lack the wisdom to build lasting systems that will have the privilege of co-existing with nature for very long. 

In human society, most adolescents become adults who learn to live within their means. Sometimes this involves sacrifices or perhaps selecting a diet based on nutrition and health rather than what might be most tasty.[^57] Likewise, humankind needs to define a scale for its activities that fits within nature's capacity to replenish, so that each subsequent generation is not deprived of resources the previous ones enjoyed. At present, civilization is nowhere close to this operating principle.

## D.5.4 Frameworks 
Humanity needs to develop a framework by which to evaluate its activities and ask whether each helps or hurts ultimate human success. Sometimes this might produce jarring results. Consider, for instance, a cure for cancer or other advances that might extend human lifetimes. Only if balanced against a smaller population or a smaller resource utilization per capita could such seemingly positive developments be accommodated once a steady equilibrium is established. Otherwise, total demand on Earth's resources goes up if the same number of people live longer at a fixed annual resource utilization per living person. In a successful world, any proposed new activity would have to demonstrate how it fits within a sustainable framework.+++(5)+++ Ignoring the issue would irresponsibly imperil overall long-term human happiness.[^58] 

At some level, humans need to realize that success means the thriving of not only themselves, but all of Earth's precious irreplaceable species and ecosystems. Without them, humans cannot be successful anyway. This is another part of maturing: many adolescents have difficulty considering the impacts of their actions on anyone other than themselves. Humans need to realize that hurting any component of Earth is hurting humans, long-term. Our legal system affords rights to humans, but gives no agency to plants, animals, or even non-living features of our planet. A successful future must give voice to every element of our world, lest we trample it and rue the day. 

[^58]: In such cases, the outcome may ulti- mately settle on longer lives for fewer peo- ple.
