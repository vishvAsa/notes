GOING FORWARD
We have layered an artificial world atop the natural one. Which do you think will stand the test of time? The sooner we dovetail back to the natural,
the greater our chances for success become.
18 Human Factors
Energy has occupied center-stage in this book because it is the physical currency of activity. Fossil fuel availability permitted the Industrial Revolution and all that came with it. Human civilization has never before faced the prospect of such a crucial global resource either disappearing or being abandoned due to other ills (e.g., climate change).
Despite the mixed suitabilities of alternative energy sources presented in Chapter 17, some physically viable avenues are open to us. In other words, physics itself does not preclude development of an energy landscape consisting primarily of solar, wind, and hydroelectric power, plus a few small contributions from a variety of other sources. Life may be different; less air travel or transportation in general, as one possibility. The enormous solar potential combined with decent storage technologies could conceivably maintain our 18 TW appetite without fossil fuels. Or we could scale back and not expect to live in such a profligate manner, viewing our current ways and expectations in the broader human experience as anomalous, temporary, and not important to preserve.
In any case, the barriers are not completely due to physical constraints— though we must heed limits where they exist. A practical concern is the expense of a non-fossil energy infrastructure: both in energy and financial terms. It is possible that the prosperity required to afford such a dream is physically unavailable.1 Another limitation involves people and how they work collectively, which is the focus of this chapter.
18.1 Personality
Discussion of personality may seem out of place in a physics-based textbook. But how we react to a looming crisis-both individually

or collectively becomes a central question. Physics and nature are indifferent to the choices we make, and whether or not these choices serve our long-term interests. Success or failure therefore depends more on our attitudes and reactions to physical reality than it does on physics itself. While this section addresses how personality preferences might influence human reaction to crisis, it is by no means the only determining factor. Education, socio-economic status, financial interests, and many other attributes can play a role. Yet underneath it all, we are humans, and possess various traits that influence our reactions.
A common fallacy is that a collection of people, possessing access to the same set of facts,2 will respond similarly. Having only occupied one person's head, each of us cannot easily comprehend the reactions another might have to a situation. A variety of metrics have been devised to characterize different personalities and preferences, which play a role in shaping reactions. The Big-5 and Myers-Briggs are among the most well known. The former provides a scale for each of five traits:
1. Openness: creative and curious vs. careful and regimented 2. Conscientiousness: degree of organization and efficiency 3. Extraversion: socially energetic vs. preference for quiet or alone 4. Agreeableness: engaging and sympathetic vs. aloof or cranky 5. Neuroticism: easily rattled vs. confident and stable
   The Myers-Briggs scheme3 has four categories that are usually repre- sented as binary (either/or) labels, but in truth also exist on a continuum as do the Big-5 traits. Each category in Myers-Briggs acquires a one-letter label, in the end generating 16 possibilities. The categories are:
1. I/E: Introvert vs. Extravert: are parties draining or energizing? 2. N/S: iNtuiting vs. Sensing: preference for abstract vs. concrete
   direct-sensory information
3. T/F: Thinking vs. Feeling: preference for intellectual/logical or
   emotional reasoning
4. J/P: Judging vs. Perceiving: decisiveness vs. keeping options

   If you have never taken a Myers-Briggs type test, the following three citations include links to online tests [114-116]. These sites, and many others, offer descriptions of the types. For instance, here is a link to a description of the INTJ type from [114]. Other types are linked from that
   page.
   Many scientists find themselves in the INTX camps.? Technically speak- ing, the last category (J/P) reflects whether a person relies more heavily on the N/S axis (if P) or the T/F axis (if J). In the case of INTP, abstrac- tion/theory is valued over logic, and the reverse for INTJ. Figure 18.1 provides an indication of the frequency of each type.8

   Figure 18.1: Frequency of Myers-Briggs types from one collection of data, as per- centages [117]. Areas are proportioned ac- cordingly. Don't take the numbers literally: they are not as precisely determined as dec- imals indicate, but visually at least this rep- resentation gives a decent sense for distri- bution. Note how significant it is when a two-thirds majority of interest-selected indi- viduals piles into the small INTJ and INTP boxes at upper right, as described in the
   text.
   this text, found that a staggering 44% of about 1,000 survey respondents shared the same INTJ type as the author, despite INTJs constituting only about 2% of the population. The over-representation of INTJ is thus about a factor of 20, and beyond question a statistically significant result (see Figure 18.2). The adjacent INTP cohort accounted for an additional 21% of visitors, despite being about 3% of the population. Thus about two-thirds of the site visitors represented 5% of the population for more than a factor-of-ten anomaly. While the Myers-Briggs scheme is not free of criticism (see Box 18.1), the result from Do the Math is pretty convincing that the Myers-Briggs scheme is measuring something relevant. Had the site asked for astrological sign, we can be pretty sure that representation would have been essentially uniform: no statistical anomalies. Myers-Briggs is evidently telling us something.
   Box 18.1: Criticism of Myers-Briggs
   Much of the criticism of the Myers-Briggs personality type indicator owes to the binary nature of each result, unlike the Big-5 percentage for each category. The argument is that people are more complex than this, and do not fall into 16 distinct and tidy categories. But any Myers-Briggs test will indicate where you fall on the spectrum from the hard extremes-based on the number of answers in the survey toward each direction. Some people fall in the middle of a category and get an X designation. 16 rigid types is illusory and unnecessary.
   It is easy enough to accept this valid criticism yet still value the fact that people do spread out in their preferences. Also, some of the dimensions map onto the more widely-embraced Big 5 scheme.
   The most important aspect of personality that bears on our energy/re- source challenges, and a key reason for covering the topic at all in this book, is that the Myers-Briggs "S" types constitute 73% of the population, yet are most resistant to the argument that unprecedented disruptive changes are on the horizon. S-types place more value on direct sen- sory input than on abstraction. Things directly experienced-seen with their own eyes, heard by their own ears, personally touched, smelled or tasted-carry much greater weight than "theory." Presented with

Areas of blue boxes represent frequency of types in the general population, as a variant of Figure 18.1. Pink areas reflect the readership of Do the Math, and overlaps appear purple. Visible pink means over-representation on the site, and visible blue indicates under- representation. 73% of the readership occu- pies the top right corner of the personality types, even though these three boxes only capture 7% of the population. A result this extreme, involving over 1,000 respondents, is absurdly far from random. Percentages are shown in the three most overwhelm- ingly over-represented boxes, plus a 1% box for reference.

   warnings about climate change, a hard-over S-type [118] might hold up a snowball (as Senator Inhofe famously did in front of Congress in 2015) to demonstrate-in their mind-how preposterous this global warming talk is. When warned about potential hardships following fossil fuel availability, an S-type may look out the metaphorical window and sense that everything seems to be fine.
   Box 18.2: Scientists Have a Type
   Scientists tend to be NT types, combining a preference for abstraction and models with a favoring of logical thought. Note that not all scientists are alike; it is good to have diversity, so it is possible to find any personality type within the science community. But the NT types will be perhaps more attracted to scientific pursuits as a good match to their personality preferences. The NT combination is the most rare, comprising 10% of the population (see Figure 18.3). Meanwhile, SF-the diametric opposite of NT-is over four times as prevalent.
   When it comes to forming rational plans for future unseen challenges, NT types are well suited to the task. Ironically, if N-type predictions of future threats were faithfully heeded and mitigated, the threats would be averted and their failure to materialize would make the N-types look like terrible predictors to the S-type crowd! Failure by success.9
   18.1.1 Consequences and Coping
   The S-type asymmetry10 in human populations may confer an overall adaptive advantage. In stable times, recent history and apparent condi- tions provide reliable guidance to the likely future. It is understandable, therefore, that humankind would have difficulty adapting early to an upcoming reversal of fortunes, or even acknowledging its possibility. The prevailing narrative of growth and progress are so firmly rooted in society that the mere suggestion of a more primitive future11 is dis- cordant enough to be rejected by cultural antibodies-alien enough to resist comprehension, as if spoken in a foreign language.
   The growth narrative's firm grip is easy to understand: Earth has always been large enough to accommodate human cravings, for countless generations. Yet 8 billion people competing for finite resources12 at an unprecedented rate, climate change, deforestation, fisheries collapse, species loss, and a host of other crises signal that the prevailing narrative may simply be wrong13 (Figure 18.4).
   Timely, effective mitigation is possible only by seriously entertaining a radically new paradigm before widespread disruption becomes unmis- takably evident. Is it possible to implant a wholly different narrative

   about the long-term relationship of humans to this planet, or is it cooked in to human nature14 that we fail this challenge?
   One aspect of this dilemma is a pattern of unwillingness to accept personal responsibility for our predicament. Our own habits and expec- tations place demands on planetary resources that lead to global-scale challenges larger than we have ever faced. People have a tendency to blame others for their plights. In this complex world, it is never dif- ficult to identify some other contributor to our problems: capitalists, socialists, liberals, conservatives, environmentalists, illegal immigrants, other religions, other powerful countries. What fraction of the blame might we assign to ourselves, and is it honest/accurate? In the end, we as humans must accept responsibility for the conditions we and our expectations-create.
   The human penchant for blaming and even demonizing "others" might lead to resource wars in the face of hardships imposed by limited resource availability. Such a path is lamentable on many levels, not least of which is that precious resources and energy would be channeled toward destructive acts rather than using them to build a better future. Are humans capable of mounting a transformative effort of global cooperation on a scale even greater than that of, say, World War II if we are not fighting an enemy other than ourselves and our own resource demands? Can we identify a precedent in which human societies have done so in the past at a large/relevant scale?
   The first step in avoiding these pitfalls is awareness of the roles that human personality and psychology play in these problems, as this section has attempted to point out. One thing that became evident to the author on the basis of the Do the Math survey was that like seems to attract like: the communication style of the blog was a magnet for those of the same or adjacent types. But the message had startlingly little grip on the S crowd-especially the population-dominant xSFx types (second column in Figure 18.2). Perhaps a concerted effort to recruit all personality types to communicate important messages will better reach a broader audience, in terms that are more resonant with recipients.
   One other coping mechanism is simple: time. The world a child is born into is by definition "normal" to the child. Future generations who do not grow up spoiled by abundant fossil fuel energy will not fight for a bygone lifestyle, and will simply adapt to the world as they find it-where the S-types shine. One way or another, nature will settle on a solution, and humans will be part of that solution, whatever its form. Ideally, we can guide ourselves into a mutually agreeable coexistence.

   18.2 Policy vs. Individual Action
   From where does power15 stem? Monarchs of old claimed divine prove- nance as a source of power. Authoritarians might use a combination of personality and strong military backing. Some countries put on a show of democracy, while exercising power to thwart rivals and control the legal apparatus-resulting in sham elections.
   In a functioning democracy, power is meant to come from the people. Votes send ineffective or crooked politicians packing, replacing them with folks promising to be faithful servants to the people and to the country's constitution. If democracy works as planned, then how far can a politician be from the sentiment of the people16 and still get elected (or re-elected)? Since presumably politicians cannot afford to stray far from the views of their constituents, are democratic politicians leaders or followers?
   What would happen in a functioning democracy if the government told people what to eat, how many kids to have, or what temperature to set in homes? If people are not already willing to make the changes on their own,17 how can a democratic government impose "responsible"
   choices when those choices involve unwanted sacrifice in some form? If democratically-elected politicians are constrained to only offer "better," more personally attractive choices, a democratic world may no longer have the flexibility necessary to address our fundamental challenges.
   So if democratic governments turn out to be ineffective at promoting substantive change involving reduction, what can be done if indeed that's the necessary course of action? Citizens are free to take charge of their own choices, for the greater good. Yet, individual action as a response to our predicament often provokes criticism and debate. The argument is that only policy has the teeth to bring about effective change. If person A uses less of a resource, it just leaves person B free to use more of it.
   But consider that voting is also an individual action. One person's vote seldom makes any measurable difference: it is a tiny drop in the bucket. Yet, if everyone18 concluded that the individual action of voting was wasted and meaningless, the result would be disastrous: gross underrepresentation and distortion of the will of the people.
   We understand in the context of voting that individual action leads to collective representation, and tend to practice this right even though policy does not demand that we do so. We see it as part of a civic responsibility as the right way to participate in our society. Our system can tolerate a certain fraction of individuals who won't donate time to their civic responsibility, but things fall apart if we have too many such people.19 Next time someone challenges your individual efforts to improve the world in some way, labeling them as meaningless, ask them to be consistent with their espoused principles and please refrain from
   15: Wait, Watt? For once, we are not talking about Joules per second.
   16: If 73% of the people are S-type person- alities, then our policies will lean toward satisfying that contingent.
   17: ...and in fact, already changing habits on their own accord
   It feels icky to point out flaws in democ- racy, as this form of government has ad- mirably lifted countless individuals up and promoted enlightened progress. It really is the best in many respects-except for this fundamental flaw in a world of constraints and possible reductions.

   voting in the future, lest they be labeled hypocrites. Often such objections are rooted in defense: they want stuff, and your giving something up is a threat to their perceived moral "right" to have it. The sense of sanctimony and righteousness of the individual making sacrifices-even if not intentional-can be very offputting.
   One other aspect of individual action is that it could influence others to follow, thus amplifying the individual's effect. This approach is perhaps most effective if others see benefits for themselves, and are not made to feel bad for not already being "woke" to the right side of the practice.
   18.3 The Energy Trap
   If we unwisely mount a response only after we find ourselves in fossil fuel decline as crisis responders, not proactive mitigators-we could find ourselves in an energy trap: a crash program to build a new energy infrastructure requires up-front energy, for decades. If energy is already in short supply, additional precious energy must be diverted to the project, making peoples' lives seem even harder/worse.20 A democracy will have a hard time navigating this decades-long sacrifice.
   Let's flesh this concept out a bit more. In the financial world, money can be borrowed on the promise of paying it back.21 In this way, something is created from nothing, essentially. Modern monetary systems are based on fiat currency, rather than being tied to physical gold or silver. This means money can be "willed" into existence by the financial system. Energy does not work that way. To build a hydroelectric dam, solar panels, wind turbines, or a nuclear plant, all the energy must be available
   up
   front. Nature offers no financing!
   Recall from Sec. 14.3.1 (p. 231) that the EROEI, or energy returned on energy invested, describes the ratio of output energy over the lifetime of the resource to the input energy needed to secure it in the first place. For many cases, like a hydroelectric dam, nuclear plant, wind turbine, or solar panel, most of the energy input happens before any energy is delivered. In other cases, like biofuels, the investment may be more drawn out and seem more like an efficiency. In the context of the energy trap, we will focus on the input as an up-front investment.
   Example 18.3.1 If a solar panel has an EROEI of 6:1, that "1" unit has to be paid up front, even though ultimately the panel will more than pay for itself, energetically. How many years of the panel's energy needs to be available up front if the panel lasts 30 years in the sun?22
   The 6 in the EROEI figure relates to the total output of the resource. So we equate 30 years of operation to the number 6, meaning that 1 "unit" is 5 years of output (Figure 18.5). Since the input is 1 unit (in

   22: Any EROEI estimate must assume some resource lifetime in order to compute the amount of energy delivered.

   6:1 construction; see Sec. 14.3.1; p. 231), we conclude that it takes 5 years of the panel's output energy to fabricate the panel. So its first five years are spent paying off the "loan," in a sense.
   As another example, development of a resource that will last 40 years and whose EROEI is 10:1 will require 4 years of its energy output ahead of time23 to bring it to fruition.
   Example 18.3.2 In order to replace the current 15 TW24 now derived from fossil fuels with a renewable resource whose lifetime is 40 years and EROEI is 10:1,25 what options might you suggest for diverting the 15 TW into construction and how long would it take under those options?
   It takes four years of the ultimate resource output to create the resource in this scenario. In one extreme, all 15 TW from fossil fuels could be diverted into the effort over a four year period26 to develop 15 TW
   27
   of the new resource. Or half of the 15 TW fossil resource could be dedicated to the effort over 8 years, or a quarter over 16 years, or 10% over 40 years.2 Choosing this last path for a 40-year resource means "starting over" at this juncture, essentially forever re-investing 10% of available energy into perpetuating a resource with EROEI of 10:1.
   Imagine now that we find ourselves having reduced access to oil,28 driving prices up and making peoples' lives harder. Now the government announces a 16 year plan to divert 25% of energy into making a new infrastructure in an effort to reduce dependence on fossil fuels. That is a huge additional sacrifice on an already short-supply commodity. Voters are likely to respond by tossing out the responsible29 politicians, installing others who promise to kill the program and restore relief on a short timescale. Election cycles are short compared to the amount of time needed to dedicate to this sort of major initiative, making meaningful infrastructure development a difficult prospect in a democracy. And this is before addressing the likely contentious fights about what the new infrastructure should be, out of the table of imperfect30 options.
   Now it is perhaps more apparent why this is called an energy trap: short-term political and economic interests forestall a proactive major investment in new energy, and by the time energy shortages make the crisis apparent, the necessary energy is even harder to attain. Short-term focus is what makes it a trap."
   31
   One wonders how democracies will fare in the face of declining resources. The combination of capitalism and democracy have been ideal during the growth phase of our world: efficiently optimizing allocation of resources according to popular demand. But how do either work in a decline scenario, when the future is not "bigger" than today, and may involve sacrifice? We simply do not yet know. This is a giant unauthorized experiment that is not operating from a script. Chapter 19 will return to this notion.

   18.4 Fermi Paradox Explained?
   Having discussed some of the top-level challenges facing our technologi- cal society, it is too tempting to speculate on how universal our trajectory might be. We do so in the context of the Fermi Paradox [119], which asks: if the universe produces a reasonably high probability of intelligent life developing, why have we seen no credible evidence32 of advanced civilizations? Yes, this is a bit of a tangent,33 but it could be interpreted as a relevant data point in the likelihood that we maintain an advanced civilization for a long duration.
   The setup to the question is a "big if." The usual approach to estimating the number of intelligent species in our galaxy34 is via the Drake Equation [120]. The equation is simple, just multiplying the number of stars by a chain of probabilities: that the star has planets at all; that one of the star's planets is "habitable;" that the environment is benign and that life has had enough time to develop; and finally that the life develops into an intelligent form, capable of communicating. Also factored in is the likelihood that any such species would endeavor to reach out, and how long their civilization lasts in that state so that we might overlap35 in time. For the Milky Way galaxy, 100 billion stars almost all of which we now know are likely to have planets-gives a huge start so that even if the chance of intelligent life arising is one in a million, we're left with quite a margin.
   35
   36
   But maybe our trajectory is pretty typical. By the time an intelligent species arises, the many millions or billions of years of life leading up to that event may ubiquitously lead to deposits of fossil fuels.3 The first species smart enough to utilize the planet's fossil fuels does so with reckless abandon. Because evolution does not skip steps, we should not expect to find a species wise enough to refrain from rapid fossil fuel use emerging before a species who is just smart enough to use them, but not smart enough not to. So the "intelligent" species short-circuits the battery37 in a blaze of glory that may even involve baby-step excursions into space before either climate change or other resource/planetary limitations removes the fossil fuel source that made it all possible. Lacking wisdom and foresight, solid plans are not in place to handle the withdrawal, which does not go well and leaves the species in a crippled lower-tech state. Rebuilding from the ashes is then much less likely to explode without that one-time elixir that made it all possible the first time.38 A simple, and possibly quite satisfying life may await, but it may not involve traveling or communicating across space for others to learn of our existence.
   This notion is, of course, highly speculative and of little practical value. Except it may allow us to think "bigger" than ourselves and ponder whether it is surprising that we might fail to achieve a Star Trek future. It is at least somewhat relevant to note that the universe we peer into does not have an evident intergalactic intelligent presence. Perhaps the

   combination of evolution and fossil fuels makes our path-including a possible decline to follow-a very natural and expected outcome, leaving the universe a quiet place.
   18.5 Upshot on Humanity
   We face unprecedented pressures on resources and on our environment, as human population and standard of living both surge on a finite planet. Nature will not allow this trend to continue indefinitely. While much of this book has pointed out limitations of one form of energy or the other, we should be clear that physics does not preclude a satisfying route to the future that operates within planetary limits. It would appear that the real barrier is human limitations in accepting physical constraints. Failure (as a whole) to:
1. process abstract information;
2. anticipate situations that have never yet arisen;
3. make individual sacrifices39 for the greater good, even if not
   mandated;
4. recognize that awaiting a clear-and-present crisis may leave us
   unable to mount a timely response;
5. acknowledge that our loneliness in the universe might constitute
   evidence that intelligent species don't routinely "make it."
   Of course, individuals in a society may not share all of these shortcom- ings. But if these failings are collectively prevalent, the more cognizant individuals have too little sway.
   Can we collectively overcome these limitations? Can we use the gift of intelligence40 to bypass built-in limitations? Only by being well aware of the barriers do we have any meaningful chance of managing them. This chapter aimed to at least raise awareness so that readers can begin to think about the role that human nature plays in the challenges ahead.
   For extended thought on this subject, see Sec. D.6 (p. 408).

1. If each of the four axes in the Myers-Briggs type happened to be equally11 likely that is, 50% chance of being I and 50% chance of E, etc., and uncorrelated, then how probable would you expect each of the 16 types to be, in percent?

   If we imagine that the four axes do not correlate with each other, 43 we could approximate the fraction of the population that is ESFP as 0.49 0.73 0.60 0.46 0.103, or approximately 10%. What would you expect the most abundant personality type to be, and what percentage of the population would be this type? What is the rarest, and what percentage would you expect in this type? How do the results compare to the probabilities in Figure 18.1?
3. Reproduce the numbers in Figure 18.3 from the percentages in Figure 18.1. The visual width of each of the four columns in Figure 18.1 also speaks to this.
4. In reference to box sizes in Figure 18.2, answer the following
   questions:
   a) Which three types are vastly over-represented45 in the survey? b) Which three types turn out to be almost perfectly represented? c) Which column is most poorly represented (what common
   letters in four associated types)?
   d) Which two types are most vastly under-represented, and by
   roughly what factor, based on area of the squares?
   46
   e) What relationship do you notice between the types in com- paring the two most over-represented types and the two most under-represented types?
   f) How would you explain to a fellow student who dispar- ages the Myers-Briggs scheme as little better than astrology what this figure/result means in terms of far-from-random outcomes and predictiveness?
5. Imagining for a moment that the distribution of human personality types is adaptive47 in an evolutionary sense, we might try to understand the asymmetry between "S-types" and "N-types." When trying to plot a course for the future, what advantages does each type bring, and what disadvantages? Another way to frame the question is: how can the contributions of each help things go right, and how might each one contribute to wrong decisions?
6. How might you propose getting people of all personality types on board with a collective campaign to fight a credible future threat that may involve sacrifice and the recognition that our own habits are part of the problem?

8. Let's say that the U.S. were willing to divert a one-time investment of 10 qBtu out of its 100 qBtu annual energy budget toward building a new energy infrastructure having a 10:1 EROEI and a 40 year lifetime. How many qBtu will the new resource produce in its lifetime, and now much per year? How many years before the amount of energy put in is returned by the output?
9. If some country or the entire world committed to a one-decade program to replace fossil fuels with solar photovoltaics at an EROEI of 6:1 (Table 14.1; p. 232) based on a 36 year panel lifetime expectation, what fraction of that region's 49 energy would have to be poured into this effort?
10. Imagine that we hit energy decline as a result of less energy available each year in traditional fossil forms, experiencing 5% less energy each year50 A new renewable energy infrastructure effort will require up-front energy, reducing the available energy even further.51 Imagine yourself as a politician wanting to get elected after such a program has been started, and you think you can get elected by pledging to kill the program. What is your pitch to the voters to get elected?

    19 A Plan Might Be Welcome
    Having discussed some of the human factors related to accepting and mitigating challenges, we now turn to the question of what humanity's goal might be if we could collectively start rowing in the same direction.
    First, we will have to assess the form that our actions have taken in the absence of a coherent plan. Next, we address challenges inherent in devising and adopting a roadmap for our future. Finally, a possible target is presented that bears consideration as we grapple with possible modes of human society going forward.

    19.1 No Master Plan
    The "adults" of this world have not established a global plan for peace and prosperity. This has perhaps worked okay so far: a plan hasn't been necessary. But as the world changes from an "empty" state in which humans were a small part of the planet with little influence to a new "full" regime1 where human impacts are many and global in scale, perhaps the "no plan" approach is the wrong framework going forward.2
    Most decisions are made based on whether money can be made or saved in the short or intermediate term. The market then becomes the primary arbiter of what transpires, constrained only by a light touch of legal regulations and public sentiment. Earth and its ecosystems have little voice3 in our artificially-constructed societal framework-at least in the
    short term.
    Perhaps we are structuring our world exactly backwards. An attempt to put a monetary value on the earth and its intricate biological web-a web that by construction is exactly the foundation humans rely upon
    for survival-produces absurdly large numbers in the sextillions of dollars

    (Box 19.1). In this context, the $100 trillion global annual economy is such a minuscule fraction of the value of the earth. Yet reflect on the question: which valuation drives almost all of our decisions?
    Box 19.1: Earth's Dollar Value
    How much would it cost to purchase a barren planet and then to layer atop it a complete, functioning ecosystem? Starting with the basics, the cost of rough rock, sand, or dirt in the U.S. bottoms out at about $5 per cubic yard. It is the very definition of "dirt cheap." We'll upgrade the volume to a cubic meter for ease. The earth is roughly 1021 cubic meters in volume, so even if given a smoking deal on the materials at $1 per cubic meter, the price tag is in the sextillion dollar regime ($1021). The high central density of the earth makes the price tag even higher under the more sensible cost per ton, considering the 6 sextillion ton mass of the earth. This is an admittedly naïve way to price a planet, but it puts a scale on things.
    A similarly simple calculation applies to minerals. Ignoring the material in the molten mantle, using crustal abundances and only the stuff in the 30 km crust under dry land," the continental crust contains $0.6 quintillion ($0.6 × 1018) of silver, $3 quintillion in gold, $5 quintillion in copper, and $20 quintillion in nickel.10 Aluminum leaps up to $2 sextillion, but probably reflects the energy-intensive extraction process.
    By these estimates, the earth is already worth something in excess of $1021, and that's before adding biology, whose billions of years of tuning under evolution is not something we even have the skill to replicate, let alone affix a price tag. Perhaps an evolved biology is more valuable than the raw materials. Given all the barren planets in the universe, an argument can be made that a biologically diverse planet would fetch a premium price. Comparing this to the global $1014 budget, the economy registers at less than a millionth the worth of the planet, yet all our decisions are made based on what is good for the tiny flea, ignoring the essential and much larger canine host.
    As human actions on this planet close the door on one species after another, it is important to realize that we are losing an investment of millions upon millions of years of evolutionary fine-tuning that led to this splendid place we call home. The human race has set about to negligently, unwittingly destroy its home, showing essentially no regard for its worth.

The crust in question has a volume of 4.4 x 1018 m3 and a mass around 1.3 x 1022 kg. The ex- pected mass of gold is then about 5x1013 kg, and would cost $3 x 1018. Notice that the total values are amazingly close for these metals: rarer is more expensive in inverse proportion and thus in rough balance.

    there, has always been there, feels "right" and good on their claws, and surely can serve no other purpose than to satisfy their urges. How could they possibly understand what it would cost to replace, or why we even care about the appearance to begin with? It would be an even better analogy if the cats' very survival depended11 on maintaining an unspoiled sofa, in ways the cats could never grasp.
    19 A Plan Might Be Welcome 318
    Maybe humans as a species are as clueless12 as the cats in Box 19.2 about their present actions. In some sense, this possibility provides a compelling reason to stop. If we can't understand the consequences of our actions, maybe that signals a tremendous risk and we should cease until we have a better grasp: do no more harm until we know what we are about. Unfortunately, there's no money in that idea.
    19.1.1 The Growth Imperative
    13
    Lacking a master plan, the current situation can be described as operating on "autopilot," guided-rather cleverly and impressively-by market forces. In a world far from environmental limits, this model effectively maximizes growth, development, innovation, and prosperity.
    Much as it is in the case of fossil fuels, it is hard to fault growth for all the good it has brought to this world. Yet, as with fossil fuels, nature will not allow us to carry the model indefinitely into the future, as was emphasized earlier in this book. Growth must be viewed as a temporary phase,14 emphasizing the need to identify a path beyond the growth phase. Before discussing how this might manifest, the list below illustrates the dominance of growth in our current society.
1. If a politician or activist calls your phone during an election cycle, ask if their platform supports growth.15 Of course it does. It is hard to find mainstream politicians opposed to growth, and this is fundamentally a reflection of attitudes among the populace. 2. Communities make plans predicated on growth. Most seek ways to promote growth: more people, more jobs, more housing, more stores, more everything.
3. Financial markets certainly want growth. Recessions are the scariest prospect for banks and investors. What would interest rates or investment even mean without growth? What role would banks play?
4. Social safety net systems16 are predicated on growth both in the workforce (as population grows) and the economy (so that interest accumulates). In this way, post-retirement pay can be greater than the cumulative contributions that an individual pays during their career. A retiree today is benefiting not only by accumulated interest on their past contributions to the fund, but on a greater workforce today paying into the fund. If growth falters in either or both (workforce/interest), the institution is at risk. It is essentially a

   slow-moving pyramid scheme that cannot be sustained long-term, given limits to growth. It was a neat idea for the growth period, but its time will come to an end.
5. Various figures from this text (Fig. 1.2; p. 7, Fig. 3.2; p. 31, Fig. 7.7; p. 109, Fig. 8.2; p. 118, Fig. 9.1; p. 139) show a relentless growth in people and resources-often looking like exponential growth. Growth has been a central feature of our regime for many genera- tions.
   In other words, human society is deeply entrenched in a growth-based model for the world. This does not augur well when the finite planet dictates the impossibility of indefinite growth.
   19.2 No Prospect for a Plan
   Not only do we lack a plan for how to live within planetary limits, we may not even have the capacity to arrive at a consensus long-term plan. Even within a country, it can be hard to converge on a plan for alternative energy, a different economic model, a conservation plan for natural resources, and possibly even different political structures. These can represent extremely big changes. Political polarization leaves little room for united political action. The powerful and wealthy have little interest in substantial structural changes that may imperil their current status. And given peoples' reluctance to embrace austerity and take personal responsibility for their actions, it is hard to understand why a politician in a democracy would feel much political pressure1 to make long-term decisions that may result in short-term hardship-real or perceived.
   Globally, the prospects may be even worse: competition between coun- tries stymies collective decision-making. The leaders of a country are charged with optimizing the prosperity of their own country-not that of the whole world, and even less Earth's ecosystems. If a number of countries did act in the global interest, perhaps by voluntarily reduc- ing their fossil fuel purchases in an effort to reduce global fossil fuel use, it stands to reason that other countries may take advantage of the resulting price drops18 to acquire more fossil fuels than they would have otherwise-defeating the original purpose. Then the participating countries will feel that they self-penalized for no good reason. Unless all relevant nations are on board and execute a plan, it will be hard to succeed at global initiatives. The great human experiment has never before faced this daunting a set of global, inter-related problems (see Box 19.3 for an underwhelming counterpoint). The lack of a global authority to whom countries must answer may make global challenges almost impossible to mitigate. Right now, it is a free-for-all, sort-of like ~200 kids lacking any adult supervision.

   Box 19.3: What About Ozone?
   Scientists discovered an alarming decrease in stratospheric ozone (03) in the latter part of the twentieth century—particularly acute aver the Antarctic, earning the title "ozone hole." A global agreement in 1989 called the Montreal Protocol banned the use of chlorofluorocarbons.19 Substitutes largely but not entirely-mitigated the ozone problem. Ozone depletion has improved by 20% since 2005 [122]. While the problem is not yet gone, or solved, it is encouraging that global policy can at least reverse and possibly fix a problem.
   On the scale of things, this was an easy problem to solve. Climate change and fossil fuel dependence are much harder, making the ozone comparison a false equivalency. Getting energy out of fossil fuels demands the release of CO2. We can't "just" switch20 to some other liquid fuel that doesn't have this problem, as this book makes clear.
   Problems are not all the same size. Switching to alternate refrigerants was painful, but not so much that countries and industries could not absorb the cost. Asking to abandon primary energy sources is a much bigger ask. Witness the fact that the rate of CO2 emissions grows every year, despite global awareness of the problem.
   Many residents of the U.S. also remember great concern over acid rain in the 1970s and 1980s, along with other environmental damages that seem to have been fixed. Part of this is real, and part is illusory. The real part is that coal-fired power plants did adopt technology to scrub sulfur and other trace pollutants out of the emissions stream. This is relatively easy compared to dealing with CO2, which is not a tiny fraction of emissions, but practically all of it.21 The illusory part of reduced acid rain impact on the U.S. environment has to do with moving much of the manufacturing capacity overseas. What happened to environmental quality in Asia as a result? Local solutions are not global ones.
   Whether trying to bring about change on a national or global level, the associated political decisions are especially fraught if any form of sacrifice is involved. Examples may be reduced travel, less "comfortable" thermostat settings, taxes or other cost structures making energy and resources more expensive, or more responsible diets. Imposing any such hardships may be politically untenable. Yet, if constrained to operate under a condition of no sacrifice in solving our problems, the only viable paths forward may be closed off, thus setting the stage for failure. In an attempt to have everything, we risk winding up with nothing.

Progress in eliminating MSG says little about prospects for addressing the much larger problem.

Occasionally, the U.N. sponsors international pacts to set limits on CO2 emissions in a quest to limit the harm of climate change. The Kyoto Protocol of 1997 and Paris Agreement of 2015 are the most notable of these.
   Despite the best of intentions, the agreements have not yet shown effectiveness, in that CO2 rises faster than ever (Fig. 9.1; p. 139). Countries fail to meet their target reductions, and suffer no penalties: what authority would enforce the targets, and how? Until people are willing to voluntarily use less and/or pay more for energy, these scientifically solid and well-meaning international agreements will lose out to political pressures for cheap comfort at a national level.
   19.2.1 Who Makes the Plan?
   19 A Plan Might Be Welcome 321
   So how might a viable plan emerge? Who might produce one? Corpo- rations cannot be expected to lay out a responsible plan for our future. Their interest is in company health and profits.22 In fact, corporations have a fiduciary obligation to their shareholders to maximize profit. Demonstrable failure to do so is technically illegal, and could result in damaging lawsuits.
   Governments are in a better position, presumably interested in the long- term health and viability of the country. Many governments, however, are constrained by election cycles that in the U.S. are every 2, 4, or 6 years. Decades-long planning is not natural in such high-turnover23 systems. Authoritarian governments may be in a better position to effect long-term planning, and even have the ability to impose sacrifice for longer-term goals. Yet, here again the goals are not aimed at achieving global peace and prosperity, but rather securing that particular country's fortunes and survival.
   Similar limitations apply to the military sector. Military bodies do have the luxury to form long-term strategic plans, and can recognize real threats24 to the global order. The only problem is that their charge is to win the day: in the event of a global resource competition, they vie to end up in control, generally through use of force or strategic superiority.
   The job of formulating a plan may be best suited to the academic world, as academics have the freedom to pursue research in any direction of their choosing, can spend entire careers focused on the effort, and can afford to think over longer timescales than their own lifetimes. An academic agenda can be global in scope, rather than fighting for the interests of a single corporation or country. As long as an academic is able to demonstrate impact-typically via substantive and original contributions to published literature-they may uphold their end of the tenure pact.2 Ideally, academics of all stripes would gather to formulate a viable future plan for how human civilization might carry forward in a way that respects realities from the realms of physical sciences, engineering,

   Author's note: while this box downplays the impact of international agreements, I still would rather have them than not, in that they do have some impact on emissions and serve as a very public symbolic state- ment of concern. I'm just not sure they are nearly enough, lacking enforcement and focusing only on climate change: one evident symptom of a much deeper dis- ease about planetary limits and ecosystems. These agreements do not address funda- mentals of growth and resource exploita- tion, and so are band-aids at best. Some- times band-aids are the appropriate choice for minor wounds, but don't expect them to cure potentially fatal diseases.

   economics, political science, sociology, psychology and cognitive science, history, anthropology, industrial studies, communications, and really all other academic fields. Every field of study has a stake in the fate of human civilization and has meaningful understandings and insights to contribute.
   Of course, any such plan that might emerge will be attacked from all sides, derided as alarmist academic fantasy. It is exceedingly difficult to imagine that the entrenched world will just decide to get started rebuilding the world according to "the plan." But the hope is that if conditions eventually deteriorate to the point that continuation of business as usual is clearly not viable, enough people may remember the plan and dust it off to see what insights it might contain.20 In such a scenario, hopefully it is not too late to salvage a satisfying future.
   26
   A vital group has been left out of the discussion thus far: people. The vast majority of people are not on corporate boards, in positions of government or military power, or in academic roles. Any effective adaptation to a different future plan will need people to be on board, which means educating them on the choices ahead and the consequences of our actions. Broad support will likely be crucial in redesigning our world to gracefully adapt to the realities of planetary limits.
   19.3 Economic Regimes
   A very nice metaphor presented in the 2003 documentary The Corporation is that early attempts at mechanized flight were doomed to fail because the contraptions were not built on aerodynamic principles of sustainable flight. All the same, the would-be pilots launched off cliff edges and momentarily felt the thrill of flying: the wind was in their hair. Meanwhile, the ground was rushing up. Likewise, our economy and society are not built on principles of sustainable steady-state operation. Even though it feels like quite the amazing rush,27 it is not hard to see evidence that the ground rushing up. Our only chance is to develop a steady- state economic model-one that is based on principles of long-term sustainability in partnership with Earth's ecosystems.
   Paying heed to true sustainability is challenging. Firstly, it is difficult to define what it means. Much depends on the lifestyle imagined. The earth can support fewer people if resource consumption per capita is high, for instance.
   A story illustrates the challenge. An economist named Herman Daly worked at the World Bank in a division focused on the interaction between the economy and the environment. When his division was asked to issue a report on this interaction, an early draft had a standard depiction of the economy showing firms and households (Figure 19.1). Firms supplied goods and services to households, while households

   provided labor for the firms. Resources fed the firms and waste was emitted from the households (and firms). Dr. Daly said: "great, now draw a box around this and label it: The Environment. The obvious point is that all economic activity takes place inside the environment. The next draft came back sporting a box drawn around the figure, but no label. Dr. Daly's response: "It looks nice, but unless the box is labeled The Environment, it's only a decorative frame." The next draft eliminated the figure altogether.
   Once a box is drawn around the economy, many uncomfortable ques- tions arise: how big should the box be (Figure 19.2)? Are we running out of room? What happens when the box fills up? Economists and governments are not prepared to answer such questions.
   A nascent field called Ecological Economics [123], of which Herman Daly is a pioneer, has emerged from deep concerns about interactions between human activity and natural systems. Unlike the more established branch called Environmental Economics, which preserves the basic foundations of neo-classical economics and attempts to put prices28 on environmental factors, ecological economics abandons the growth paradigm and tries to establish rules for maintaining an indefinite relationship with our planet's resources and natural services.
   Herman Daly described the different philosophies by analogy to loading a boat. Macro-economics concerns itself with the overall distribution of products within the boat. It is unwise to load all the cargo into the front or back, or all on one side: much better to uniformly load the boat so that it stays level. In analogy, an economy wants to strike a balance across the wide variety of goods and services offered, so that it is not riddled by giant surpluses in one area and deficits in another. Micro- economics deals with the details of how to efficiently manufacture and sell the contents of each box: materials; supply chains; labor; marketing; distribution. But traditional economics has no concept for how much cargo the boat should hold-much like we have not established the size of the "box" within which the economy operates (as in Figure 19.2).
   Figure 19.1: Standard concept of the econ- omy, but importantly surrounded by a finite box labeled "The Environment." Most in- stances of this figure avoid the insinuation that the economy is contained in a finite domain, in part because it raises the un- comfortable question of how close we are to filling up the box.

   In effect, our "boat" has no "waterline" painted on its side to indicate when it is fully loaded. The word "macro" in macro-economics makes it sound like the "big picture" view, but it's really just intermediate. By analogy, we might say that micro-economics is about understanding all the complex workings within a house or building. Macro-economics concerns itself with the distribution of various building types and functions within a city. Missing is a branch evaluating how many cities can fit on Earth and be supplied by the environment. Ecological Economics attempts to address this shortcoming, which is not important in an "empty" earth but becomes crucial as the human scale begins to dominate the planet.
   19.3.1 Steady State Economy
   Chapter 2 demonstrated that economic growth cannot go on forever. Continuing to operate as if growth can and should-persist risks irrevocable damage to that from which all value ultimately depends and derives: a healthy natural environment. The sooner we can jump ship to a new economic model that can survive the long haul, the better.
   A few key principles will help flesh out aspects of how a steady state economy might work. A critical goal is to reduce the flow (or demand) of resources into the economy, and reduce the waste (pollution, CO2, for instance) back into the environment. This would be akin to diminishing the sizes of the two thick arrows in Figure 19.1. One approach would be to levy substantial taxes on every tree that is cut, mineral that is mined, drop of oil that is extracted, or wild animal that is unnaturally removed from the environment. Likewise, a heavy tax would accompany disposal of waste and emissions of pollutants. Meanwhile, labor would no longer be taxed. Labor can add value to resources already in hand. The idea is to tax the damaging things, not the beneficial things.
   Think about what happens under these conditions. Buying a newly manufactured item becomes expensive. Throwing away an old device becomes expensive. Repair (labor) becomes cheaper. Say goodbye to the disposable economy, or "planned obsolescence." Durable goods. and lifetime warranties become popular. Items are designed to facilitate upgrade or repair. For instance, once you own a large display at high resolution, good contrast, and good color representation, it should satisfy for a lifetime.29 Human visual acuity is static, and modern displays are effectively perfect, relative to our biological hardware. If a small electronic component fails, the environmental cost of manufacturing a whole new unit and disposing of the old one is enormous especially compared to the environmental cost of replacing the small failed compo- nent. At present, repair cost often exceeds the cost of replacement and disposal.30 Under the new arrangement, we begin to place greater value in craftsmanship, community resources, and high-quality goods.31

   Consider now the effect on our consumer treadmill.32 Let's say you the perfect toothbrush. When it is worn out, you try to get the same one again. But the company has changed its style, so the one you like is no longer available. Why does this happen? The company has a standing army of designers and marketers that must continually "improve" the product to stay competitive in the market. If we all bought less stuff, or more durable items that lasted far longer, the demand for manufacturing would wane. Markets and politicians shudder to contemplate this, as the result would be recession and loss of jobs.
   But a widespread cessation of constant disposal and replacement of low-quality goods would mean that not as much income would be required to satisfy basic needs and to enjoy a quality life. Maybe all those jobs are not really necessary. Maybe a lot of what presently occupies society is a bunch of wasted effort in service of growth33 and not serving ourselves or the planet well in the process. What if it only takes 10 hours of work per week to live comfortably, having reduced the flow and expense of low-quality stuff once planned obsolescence is rather poetically-rendered obsolete? Perhaps we could spend more of our time enjoying life, community, family, friends, the natural world, while still retaining scientific literacy and basic technology standards.
   34
   It seems that humanity got stuck in a frenetic lifestyle because money and an unrealistic vision of our future trajectory told us to do so. Maybe we need to rethink what we want life to be about, and not simply accept that productivity and profit are the drivers that matter. Are we the boss of money, or is money the boss of us?
   Careful thought [124, 125] has been put into how to modify the present financial system toward a steady state. The process has been compared to converting an airplane, which must keep moving forward in order to stay up as the current economy must grow to survive-into a helicopter that can remain stationary. And this transformation would ideally happen mid-flight. It's a difficult prospect. Moreover, none of the necessary steps would ever spontaneously happen without the population first embracing the ultimate goal of a steady-state economy. Therefore, a collective push to abandon our current economic model must initiate the process, and it is unclear how this ground swell might materialize.
   It is possible that a steady-state economic framework-for all its merits and careful thought-is ultimately naïve and infeasible. Individuals may be naturally driven to work very hard to build an empire and improve their own lot. It is not obvious that human nature is suited to a steady state existence: competition and acquisition of power may be built in.35 Imposing rules to prevent outsized accumulation of wealth or power may seem oppressive and would be hard to sustain, unless societal values uniformly shunned excessive wealth, power, and consumption. But for how many generations could such a state of affairs be maintained? It seems like an unstable scenario.

   19.4 Upshot on the Plan
   Humanity has historically not needed a master plan. Plenty of space, resources, and natural services allowed unwitting expansion. Yes, wars occasionally broke out over contested resources, but generally in localized regions. This state of affairs will continue to be true until it isn't any more. That is to say, just because something has never happened before does not mean it cannot. Earth has never hosted 8 billion high-demand humans, yet here we are. Human imagination is not the ultimate limit in this physical world. At this juncture, it would be prudent to heed the warning signs and attempt to make a plan for survival/prosperity.
   37
   Currently, it is hard to imagine any global consensus arising around a plan. Even if able to maintain the current level of global resource demand,36 those who use resources at a much higher rate than average may have to scale back as the world equilibrates, and this will not easily be agreed upon. Academic circles may be the only place from which a credible plan might emerge,38 but any such plan would likely be ridiculed and discarded as impractical.
   The silver lining is that some folks have thought about alternative ways to structure the economy allowing abandonment of growth and living within ecological limits. Some of the elements of this plan are very appealing. Only if embraced on a large scale would it be feasible to migrate in this direction, and it is unclear what circumstances might bring about such an attitude change, if it is possible at all.
   19.5 Problems
1. To visualize the scale of the $100 trillion global economy relative to the value of the earth-conservatively one million times larger- let's think in terms of animal volume. Volume scales like the cube of linear dimension. How much would you have to shrink a dog in linear scale for its volume to be one-millionth its original size? If the typical scale of a dog is 0.5 m, how large is the shrunken version, and what animal is about this size?
2. Subjectively, how much more do you think a planet teeming with biodiversity is worth compared to a comparable planet harboring no life at all? Express as a factor: 1.2 times as much, 2 times as much, 10 times as much, 100, 1 million etc.
3. In analogy to the clueless cats in Box 19.2 and the paragraph following, describe how we might plausibly destroy something valuable on our planet without understanding it fully enough to repair the damage.
   36: It is not at all clear that we could.
   37: Ahem, America.
   38: Who else would pay for it?

   you.

   19 A Plan Might Be Welcome 327
4. What institutions can you think of that are prevalent now but will be rendered obsolete—or at least radically diminished-if the economy stopped growing permanently?
5. Why do you think we have not yet formulated a master plan for how humans can live on the earth indefinitely without exceeding limits?
6. Do you see a route to global acceptance of a plan? What would it take to get there? Would we first need a global government having authority over all nations?
7. What is your major in college, and what insights or contributions do you imagine may be offered by this field of study in formulating a workable plan for the future of human life on this planet?
8. Presently, the American tendency is to buy a missing tool for a job that may not be needed again for a very long time, if at all. It is likely that some nearby neighbor already has the same tool collecting dust. What do you imagine would be advantages and disadvantages of pooling resources in a lending arrangement?
9. Why do you think the field of traditional economics does not recognize limits to growth, and does not have a macro-macro branch looking at the whole planet and its finite nature?
10. A central question in mapping a comfortable future has to do with how large our economy is with respect to physical boundaries.39 One solution would be to set aside some fraction of the planet (land and ocean) off limits to human extraction of any plants, animals, or other resources. What fraction seems tolerable to you? If it turns out that half needs to be protected to guarantee long-term survival, do you think that's possible/practical? How many generations do you think could maintain the discipline to preserve that rich world in a pristine state?
11. What do you find appealing about a steady-state economic model?
    What do you find worrisome?
12. Section 19.3.1 contains four instances in which the economy is compared to analogous systems. What are these four, and which do you find most impressionable/memorable?
13. Do you think that human nature the desire to improve one's lot and expand empire-is compatible with a steady state economic model? Can you see a way that it might work?
14. Are you left thinking that we are likely to establish and implement a viable global plan for how humans might live prosperously on the planet indefinitely, or do you think it is more likely we will fail to do so and "wing it" into whatever fate awaits?
    39: It is even possible we have exceeded those steady-state bounds and are spend- ing down an irreplaceable inheritance right
    now.

    20 Adaptation Strategies
    We made it to the final chapter. How are we doing? Anxious? Excited? Alarmed? Inspired? This book has compressed a perspective that took the author many years to absorb. Exposure in one short sprint would likely be overwhelming, and might even generate an impulse to reject the message as both unfamiliar and grim-thus hopefully wrong?
    Up to this point, the theme of the book might be characterized as one of closing lots of exits. Growth can't continue indefinitely requiring a whole different economic model. Space is not a realistic escape hatch. Fossil fuels are what made this life possible, but will not last and are causing disruptive climate change. The alternative options all have their own practical limitations, and offer no drop-in replacements for fossil fuels. At least sunshine offers a ray of light as a super-abundant energy flow. But when it comes to making collectively smart decisions about a future path, more obstacles surface on the human side. Success requires long-term planning and not the more common crisis response.
    This chapter changes gears a bit to touch on individual actions and values that could amount to big things in aggregate. At the very least, it may provide individual-scale escape hatches allowing some peace of mind about personal contributions to the problem.

    20.1 Awareness
    How many people do you know who are concerned about a legitimate threat of collapse of our civilization? It is an extreme outcome, and one without modern precedent. It seems like a fringe, alarmist position that is uncomfortable to even talk about in respectable company. Yet the evidence on the ground points to many real concerns:

1. The earth has never had to accommodate 8 billion people at this
   level of resource demand;
2. Humankind has never run out of a resource as vital as fossil fuels; 3. Humans have never until now altered the atmosphere to the point
   of changing the planet's thermal equilibrium;
4. We have never before witnessed species extinction at this rate, or
   seen such dramatic changes to wild spaces and to the ocean.
   Just because something big has not happened yet does not constitute strong evidence that it cannot or will not. But more important than that argument which is always true is the number of credible causes for concern that are evident today.
   Also important to recognize is that a challenge cannot be effectively mitigated unless it is first identified and acknowledged. The very lack of collective awareness about a credible risk of collapse is itself unsettling. If open discussion of the possibility of collapse were not so uncomfortable and off-putting, we would stand a better chance of preventing its unfolding. It would be a huge relief to be wrong about the concern. But not taking it seriously represents a colossal risk.
   20 Adaptation Strategies
   329
   Box 20.1: The Y2K Scare
   The Y2K1 scare in 1999 offers a good template for how to mitigate a potential disaster. Computer systems became the dominant means for managing financial and government records, transactions, and accounts in the 1960s through 1980s. A two-digit code was used for the year in many records, not anticipating the roll-over to 2000 decades away. The early programmers either doubted that their code would still be functioning in 20002 or assumed it would be cleaned up in time. In the year or two leading up to Y2K, the issue got tons of coverage and predictions of mayhem, as peoples' digital lives-a new phenomenon were tossed into any number of unknown upheavals. But the very fact that the issue dominated public consciousness was exactly what ensured a smooth transition. Every bank and agency got on the job and Y2K came and went without a ripple. It would be great to see a repeat in the case of potential collapse. The lack of a specific time prediction is one barrier, unlike Y2K. Without a firm deadline or a clear-and-present danger, the temptation to delay serious attention is strong.
   A key contributor to awareness is in how information sources and activi- ties shape opinions and views. A world overflowing with information can be difficult to navigate, and has a tendency to coagulate into isolated domains that cater to predispositions. The result can be disagreement on basic facts, making coordinated progress difficult. Luckily, attentive individuals can perform an assessment of the trustworthiness of various information outlets. The process is to watch an entire live event, like a

   debate or a hearing, and see how the event is covered by various news sources. Does the coverage3 reflect the event as you experienced it? Did it focus on the key developments or on distractions that might be emotionally "triggering?"
   Entertainment is another source/activity that can influence mindsets in subtle ways. For example, the grossly simplified and virtual world of video games promotes a false sense of what is possible—rather than helping model responses to real-world challenges, constrained by many layers of practical considerations. Reaching level 42 without suffering too many damage points is a fairly empty accomplishment1 that just means having followed some game designer's artificial and arbitrary rule set pretty well, combined with some skill in pressing buttons. More impressive is building or creating something, repairing something, or having some beneficial impact in the external world that would not otherwise have happened.
   Likewise for movies and shows, which can provide healthy joy and social bonding. But because the industry is not constrained to follow rules of nature, it is easy to form dangerous misconceptions about what humans are capable of doing. As a result, not only does the likelihood of disappointment increase, but the necessary sort of deliberate and unglamorous work that must be initiated well before crisis becomes apparent is less likely to materialize if the populace is trained to hold out for unrealistic and spectacularly successful outcomes.

   20.2 Communication
   In a democracy, collective public awareness drives the issues politi- cians serve. Only by having voters demand action will progress follow. Conversations with friends and family then become necessary to raise awareness among others. Effective communication that accomplishes this goal without turning people off is tricky. When the message contains bad news or suggests sacrifice, the effort can easily backfire.
   It is important not to polarize the conversation by "bossing" people or projecting a sense of authority. An effective strategy is to fairly represent uncertainty, while still conveying credible concern. Caveats like "it seems that," or "it appears to me that," or "I may be wrong, but" go a long way to taking the edge off of the message and inviting the listener into a constructive conversation. It is possible to couch the language in uncertainty while still hitting the main points. Words like "possible," "likely," "plausible," and "risk" can be useful to soften the tone but still express concern.
   Division in the U.S. is frighteningly high right now, so that distrust is a real barrier to sharing a common factual basis. The communication needs to be "we," not "you." For instance, "we really should be concerned

   331
   about X" rather than "I think you should X." It is best to try to convey a sense that we are all in this together. Expressions like "I worry that," or "Do you also feel that..." bring a human touch and invite a sense of inclusion and collaboration.
   One potentially interesting approach is to appeal to the fundamentally conservative nature of most people. This is conservative with a small "c," rather than the Conservative (right-leaning) political party. In this sense, conservative means:
1. low risk: let's not gamble the future on speculative notions; 2. conservation of resources and quality of the earth environment; 3. laying the groundwork for future generations (e.g., grandchildren)
   to have a livable world.
   8
   By these traditional definitions of conservative, many in the Conservative wing are more fairly labeled as free market radicals-willing to risk future stability and damage our environment in exchange for short term financial gain. This approach is not inherently conservative. Political identities in the world may, in fact, be ripe for a massive realignment wherein many traditionally conservative values pair more naturally with the political "left" (liberal wing) than with the "right." In recent decades, the left has been more concerned about environmental issues and ecological damage. It would make sense that the most conservative— or low risk-proposals for future paths would emerge from the political left.
   An apt analogy is that our society is, metaphorically, barreling toward a cliff. Faced with credible warnings, the low-risk (conservative) approach would be to alter course: get serious about a non-fossil infrastructure and transition away from growth. At the very least, let off the gas pedal: reduce resource use while we learn more. Keeping the foot down on the pedal and seeking to accelerate as fast as possible is probably the least wise decision, yet best characterizes the current approach.
   Unfortunately, a common tendency of people on the receiving end of the kind of message this book advances is to get frustrated when the story is not tied up neatly into a happy ending. Perhaps our story-telling culture has irreversibly conditioned people to expect resolution at the end of every movie or show. Nature and the world are under no such obligations to satisfy our psychological need for closure, so it is unfair to blame the messenger for accurately conveying the perils and uncertainty of our times. Perhaps people seek a hopeful conclusion so that they can walk away unencumbered-satisfied that everything is under control and that somebody will figure something out. But this tendency is perhaps counter-productive, in that only by internalizing and burdening oneself with the daunting nature of our challenge will it be possible to mount a collective and effective response. If human nature is such that unpalatable stories don't gain traction, it is another way to say that we are not built to overcome a global dilemma of this scale. So push back

   on any criticism demanding that you need to supply a happy picture at the end of the story. Challenge the listener to deal with the tension, as this book has attempted to do. Tough love.
   20.2.1 Predicament, not Problems
   It may also be advisable to avoid characterizing the set of interconnected global challenges as "problems," because the word problem implies a solution. It implicitly isolates the issue at hand into a stand-alone simple issue, promoting "what if we just..." proposed solutions. The real story is far more intricate, and more like a game of whack-a-mole.10 A simple "fix" to one corner of the problem makes something worse elsewhere. A better word is predicament, intoning a more serious and possibly intractable situation. Perhaps a predicament can be viewed as an interconnected set of thorny challenges rather than a collection of isolated problems.
   11
   Predicaments don't have solutions, but responses. Piecemeal fixes are unlikely to "solve" the current predicament in a way that permits moving on and relegating the problems to the past. But we can imagine re- crafting our world, responding to the challenges by adapting our mode of living to be compatible with planetary limits. Problems can be faced head-on and be defeated, whereas predicaments call for stepping around and finding a different path.

   20.3 Personal Adaptation and Guidelines
   Previous chapters have discussed the challenges democratic govern- ments have in imposing any form of reduction that feels like sacrifice to the population. Since political power in democracies starts with individ- uals, we focus here on what individuals can do to reduce their demand on energy resources. If enough individuals are not willing to make such adjustments, it is doubtful that the U.S. government, for instance, would exert authority over this sensitive domain of personal freedom.
   12
   This section addresses ways to take personal control of energy expen- ditures.12 The presupposition is that the reader is interested in ways to reduce their impact, or footprint, on the planet and its resources. Col- lective progress on this front would reduce the current 18 TW demand on energy, making it that much easier for fossil fuel replacements to satisfy a more modest demand. A voluntary course of reduction on a broad enough scale would reduce vulnerability to forced reduction that would ultimately accompany declining fossil resource availability or climate-motivated reduction targets. It is also good preparation for potential scarcity.
   12: Energy usage correlates strongly with resource usage, in general.

   We will first look at attitudes and framing, then some overarching guidelines, followed by specific quantitative assessment of energy expen- ditures. Readers can identify for themselves areas for potential change in their own habits and expectations.
   20.3.1 Overall Framing
   In the absence of a major shift in public attitudes toward energy and resource usage, motivated individuals can control their own footprints via personal decisions. This can be a fraught landscape, as some people may try to out-woke each other and others will resist any notion of giving up freedoms or comforts-only exacerbated by a sense of righteous alienation from the "do-gooders."
   Some basic guidelines on effective adaptation:
1. Choose actions based on some analysis of impact: don't bother
   with superficial stuff, even if it's trendy.
2. Don't simply follow a list of actions or impart a list on others: choose a more personalized adventure13 based on quantitative
   assessment.
3. Avoid showing off. It is almost better to treat personal actions as secrets. Others may simply notice those choices and ask about them, rather than you bringing them up."
   14
4. Resist the impulse to ask: "what should I buy to signal that I'm environmentally responsible?" Consumerism and conspicuous consumption are a large part of the problem. Buying new stuff is perhaps counterproductive and may not be the best path.
5. Be flexible. Allow deviations. Rigid adherence makes life more difficult and might inconvenience others, which can be an unwel- come imposition. Such behavior makes your choices less palatable to others, and therefore less likely to be adopted or replicated. 6. Somewhat related to the last point, chill out a bit. Every corner of your life does not have to be perfect. We live in a deeply imperfect world, so that exercising a 30% footprint compared to average is pretty darned good, and not that much different than a "more perfect" 25%. Doing a few big things means more than doing a lot of little things that may drive you (and others) crazy.
7. In the end, it has to matter to you what you're doing and why. It's
   not for the benefit of others.1

   The first two items on the list are not easy: most people are not themselves equipped to quantitatively evaluate the impact of their choices. But some simple guidelines can help.

   20.3.2 Energy Assessment Principles
   This section contains a number of key insights that can guide actions. Each starts with a simple statement in bold font, followed by elaboration and then an example or two16 for most.
   16
   Heat is costly. Anything whose job it is to create thermal energy (heat) is a power-hog: clothes dryer; home heating; hot water heater; space heater. A small device called the Kill-A-Watt is handy for assessing power
   draw by plug-in appliances.
   Example 20.3.1 How much energy does it take to dry a load of clothes using a 5,000 W clothes dryer?
   Assuming it takes about an hour to run, this is 5 kWh, or 18 MJ.
   Example 20.3.2 How much energy does it take to heat all the water in a 40 gal (150 L) tank from 10°C to 50°C?
   Recalling Def. 5.5.1 (p.73) or the definition of the kilocalorie, heating 150 L (150 kg) by AT = 40°C will take 6,000 kcal, which converts to 25 MJ or 7 kWh of energy.
   How often is it on? Duty cycle matters a lot: how often it's on. A microwave oven uses a lot of power, but not so much energy, because it is hardly ever running. The Kill-A-Watt mentioned above accumulates kWh and allows determination of the average power of a device.
   Example 20.3.3 How much energy is a 1,500 W microwave oven at home likely to use in a day, compared to a 25 W television tuner box running 100% of the time?
   The microwave might be on for 12 minutes per day, or 0.2 hours. That makes 0.3 kWh17 for the microwave and 0.6 kWh for the tuner box.
   Time matters.
   Large AT is costly. The power it takes to maintain a temperature difference is proportional to the temperature difference.18 For related reasons, a refrigerator in a hot garage has to work especially hard19 to maintain a large AT.
   Example 20.3.4 How much more daily energy does it take to keep a home at 25°C inside when it is 5°C outside versus keeping it at 15°C inside?
   In the first case, AT is 20°C, while it's just 10°C in the second case. So it will take twice as much energy to keep the interior at 25°C compared to 15°C.
   Use common units. Cross-comparison of energy usage is made more difficult by different units. Table 20.1 provides conversions to kWh as a
   16: A number of the examples require some thought and estimation, which is not typical of assigned problems but may be advanta- geous here to promote the kind of thinking that is useful when applying to personal- ized situations.

   standard. In terms of power, many appliances are rated in Btu/hr, which is 0.293 W. So a hot water heater at 30,000 Btu/hr is equivalent to about 10 kW and will consume 5 kWh if running for half-an-hour, for instance. Putting everything in the same units (kWh as a suggestion here) allows useful comparisons of choices.
   Example 20.3.5 In a month, the utility bill for a house shows 600 kWh, 20 Therms, and the two cars of the household used a total of 60 gallons of gasoline. How do these stack up, when assessed in the same units?
   Using Table 20.1, the gas amounts to 586 kWh-almost identical to electricity and the gasoline totals about 2,200 kWh, far outweighing the other two.
   Electricity source matters. Your local source for electricity20 can impact choices. It should be possible to determine your local mix via online sources [126]. The fact that conventional power plants tend to convert chemical energy into delivered electricity at 30-40% efficiency needs to be considered in comparing direct use of a fossil fuel against electrical solutions based on fossil fuel. A heat pump design for a water heater can compensate for this loss, and then some.21
   Example 20.3.6 A hot water heater using natural gas is likely about 85% efficient at transferring the heat of combustion into the water (enclosed, insulated), while an electric hot water heater manages to get 100% of the delivered energy into the water via a heating coil immersed in the water. If the source of electricity is also natural gas form a power plant achieving 40% efficiency at converting thermal energy into electricity and then transmitting it to the house at 95% efficiency, which method uses more total fossil fuel energy, and by what factor?
   We compare 85% efficient for the direct usage to 40% times 95% times 100%.22 The ratio of 85% to 38% is 2.2, so it will take 2.2 times more gas at the power plant than in the home to produce the same result in heated water.
   Weight is a guide. A rough rule of thumb is that the energy cost of consumer goods is not too far from the energy contained in the equivalent weight23 in gasoline, meaning 13 kWh/kg (Table 20.1). Should you use paper or plastic bags? The one that weighs more probably required greater energy and resource use. Should you drive back home if you forgot your reusable bag? Compare the amount (weight) of gasoline you'll use to the weight of the disposable bags the store uses.24 High-tech gadgets, like smart phones, almost certainly break this rule and cost far more energy to produce than their gas-equivalent weight-as can be approximated in the next point.

   Example 20.3.7 Should you buy a new, more efficient refrigerator that will use 1.8 kWh per day (75 W average) instead of your current one that uses 2.4 kWh/day (100 W average)?
   At a mass around 150 kg, the refrigerator's manufacture might require ~2,000 kWh,25 taking about 9 years to pay back at the 0.6 kWh/day saving. This is long enough that considerations such as material resources and disposal might tip the scale against replacement.
   Cost is a guide. A secondary approach to figuring energy content is to suspect that the item's cost is appreciably greater than the cost of the energy that went in. Perhaps a reasonable number is that 15% of the total cost goes toward energy.26 Conveniently, a typical retail price of electricity of $0.15/kWh then translates to 1 kWh for each $1 of consumer spending. When results from the two approaches (by mass or by price) differ, the higher energy cost number may be the safer bet.
   Example 20.3.8 What do the two methods say about a 1,500 kg car that costs $25,000 and a smart phone that costs $1,000 and has 200 g of mass?
   The car estimates are 1,500 kg times 13 kWh/kg for about 20,000 kWh or $25,000 times 1 kWh/$ for 25,000 kWh. In this case, they're pretty close and it hardly matters which one we favor.
   For the phone, the mass estimate is just 2.6 kWh, but by price it would be 1,000 kWh. In this case, for reasons argued above, the larger one is more likely on target.
   27
   Focus on the big. Keep your eye on the big impacts. We are not actually under threat of running out of landfill space, for instance. So while recycling is a preferred approach,28 very visible in society, and should be practiced when possible, the impact is not dramatic: it still takes a lot of energy to process recycled goods. Metal recycling (especially aluminum) is most effective from energy and resource standpoints, and paper from a resource standpoint (trees), but plastic is less clear on both energy and resource bases. Reducing its use may be best.
   Example 20.3.9 How effective is it to buy a water bottle for my daily needs?
   Compare the weight and cost of the water bottle to the weight and cost of all the plastic cups it displaces29 as a reasonable guide to the relative impact.
   The best of all worlds is not buying something for the purpose, but finding something you already have that will get the job done.
   Reduction rules. Reduction is by far the action with the biggest impact. Buy less stuff. Live more simply. Travel less often and less far.30 Adapt
   20 Adaptation Strategies 336
   25:... 150 kg times 13 kWh/kg
   26: This is not a capricious estimate, as it is approximately representative of energy costs in our society as a whole-stacked a little higher here to better reflect manu- facturing activities, which are bound to be more energy-intensive than the economy as a whole. Also note that energy intensity, as seen in Fig. 2.2 (p. 19), is characteristically around 5 MJ/$, which is 1.4 kWh/$ and not far from our rule of thumb here.
   27: We would not go so far as to say that either method is "right." They should be viewed as very approximate guidelines that at least can help differentiate big deals from insignificant things.
   28: Better yet is to try getting by without purchasing items that require later disposal.
   29: Consider the duration of ownership or of usage and how many disposable cups are avoided.
   30: A side benefit to these actions is sav- ing money, maybe working less hard and retiring earlier.

   yourself better to the climate.31 Eat more responsibly. The next section digs into related actions in more quantitative detail.
   20.3.3 Quantitative Footprint
   A useful exercise is to compare your own energy footprint to national averages. How much more or less are you using? For some categories, information is hard to assess. For instance, how much oil is used to transport the goods you buy and the food you eat? How much energy is used in the industrial and commercial sectors on your behalf?32 In part, your level of consumerism is a good clue, but it still may be hard to compare to others. The following items offer some guidance. The first two entries can be derived from Fig. 7.2 (p. 105), after unit conversions and dividing by the U.S. population.
   Electricity: A typical American uses 12 kWh of electricity per day in their residence. To get your own share, look at an electricity bill for your residence and divide by the number of people living in the place and by the number of days33 in the billing period.
   Example 20.3.10 In 2019, the author's utility bills34 indicate total use was 3,152 kWh for a household of two. What is the daily average per person and how does it compare to the national average?
   3,152 kWh divided by 365 days and 2 people is 4.3 kWh per person per day, about one-third of the national average.
   Natural Gas: A typical American uses about 13 kWh of natural gas per day in their residence, amounting to 0.44 Therms per day.35 To get your own share, look at a gas bill for your residence, if applicable, and divide by the number of people living in the place and by the number of days in the billing period.
   Example 20.3.11 In 2019, the author's utility bills 36 indicate total use was 61 Therms for a household of two. What is the daily average per person and how does it compare to the national average?
   61 Therms divided by 365 days and 2 people is 0.084 Therms (2.4 kWh) per person per day, about 20% of the national average.
   Gasoline: A typical American buys about 400 gallons of gasoline37 per year for personal transportation, amounting to a daily equivalent of 41 kWh38 of energy use. Keep track of your fuel purchases39 and compare how much you use. In the case of multiple occupancy in the car, your share can be computed by dividing how many gallons were used in the trip by the number of people. Knowing an approximate fuel economy40 for the car and distance traveled is enough to estimate fuel usage.

   39: This practice is good for tracking fuel economy as well.
   40:...e.g., miles per gallon or L/100 km

   Example 20.3.12 The author's household has two vehicles,41 one of which drove 400 miles and used 22 gallons of gasoline in 2019, and the other covered 8,660 miles using 69 gallons. What is the daily average use per person in the household, and how does this compare to the national average?
   A total of 91 gallons for two people is about 45 gallons per person, equivalent to 4.5 kWh/day, and 11% of the national average.
   Air travel: Expressing an average in this case is inappropriate, as many Americans do not fly at all, while all use some combination of electricity, gas, and gasoline in some capacity. The average works out to 2,300 miles (3,700 km) per year when averaging all people, but among those for whom air travel is a utilized, the number is generally a good bit higher. To put it in context and enable useful comparisons, we will compare it to ground transportation.
   Typical passenger jets get approximately 90 miles per gallon (m.p.g.) per seat 42 (2.6 L/100 km) for a fully-occupied plane-worse if seats are empty: down to 45 m.p.g. per passenger if half full, for instance. So traveling 1,000 km in a full airplane uses the same amount of fossil fuel energy per person as driving the same 1,000 km in an efficient doubly-occupied car that gets 45 m.p.g. (5.2 L/100 km). For an 80% full airplane,43 the effective per-passenger mileage is about 70 m.p.g., coming to an energy cost of about 0.5 kWh per mile (0.32 kWh/km) per passenger. Because air travel tends to involve long trips, the energy used (thus CO2 emissions) for air travel can easily exceed that for personal car usage, as is seen in the next example.
   Example 20.3.13 The author, in 2019, flew about 4,200 miles for personal travel and 9,600 miles work-related. How many kWh per day does this translate to in the two categories, and how does it compare to expenditures in electricity, gas, and personal gasoline?
   For personal air travel, 4,200 miles times 0.5 kWh per mile is 2,100 kWh or 5.8 kWh/day, which is slightly larger than the 4.3, 2.4, and 4.5 kWh/- day from electricity, natural gas, and personal gasoline computed in previous examples, but still really in the same ballpark. Business travel44 accounts for 13 kWh/day, by itself exceeding the sum of household expenditures.
   Example 20.3.14 If three people are traveling from San Diego to San Francisco at a distance of 700 km, how good does the car's gas mileage need to be to beat an 80% full airplane that would get 90 miles per gallon per passenger if full?
   Being 80% full knocks the effective fuel economy down to 72 m.p.g. per passenger. For the three people in question, a car achieving 24 m.p.g. (9.8 L/100 km) will match the airplane's energy expenditure, so

   ... a non-commuting truck and a com- muting plug-in hybrid that mostly uses elec- tric drive, charged at home (the electrical demand for which is represented in Exam- ple 20.3.10)
   42: The airplane as a whole gets less than one mile per gallon, but each passenger's share of gallons used makes it better on a per-passenger basis. It takes almost the same amount of energy to fly a plane from point A to point B independent of passenger load. Most of the energy is used to fight air resis- tance, which is related to the size and speed of the airplane, essentially independent of the number of passengers inside.

   44: Ugh. Wish I didn't have to.
   Note that we didn't need the distance. This may seem like a "trick," but consider that life is even trickier: real-world problems have no (or maybe all available) information provided, and it's up to us to sort out what's relevant.

   anything getting better performance will deliver the three people at a lower energy cost.
   Diet Impacts: Modern agricultural practices result in a 10:1 energy expenditure on the production, distribution, and waste of food-so that each kilocalorie of food eaten requires 10 kcal of energy input [97]. A typical 2,100 kcal/day diet translates into 2.4 kWh/day, and applying the 10:1 ratio means that about 24 kWh of energy input is required to cover a typical American's diet-which is substantial on the scale of residential/personal energy use. Because food is also grown for livestock and poultry, then those animals convert the food to meat at some low efficiency, raising animals for meat is a net energy drain: directly eating the food ourselves45 would use less

   20.3.4 Dietary Energy
   This last point on food energy deserves some elaboration, setting the stage for a quantitative evaluation of diet choices. For any food type, it is possible to characterize the amount of energy spent producing the food as a ratio to the metabolic energy contained in the food.46 Key results of some such studies ([127] and [128]) are provided in Table 20.2. Treat these as rough guides rather than absolutely definitive numbers, since specific agricultural, feeding, or fishing practices play a huge role in the energy requirements: large variations can be expected, in practice. All the same, fruits and vegetables consistently require small energy expenditures relative to meat and dairy products.
   46: In this sense, it is the inverse of EROEI: energy invested to extract the food divided by energy delivered.

   Table 20.2: The ratio of energy invested in producing various common foods to the metabolic energy delivered by the food (sort-of an inverse EROEI), broken into five categories. High ratios indicate large energy costs. When known, the distribution within the category is given for standard American diets. Beef is grain-fed, salmon is farmed, and milk is a stand-in for dairy products more generally. Data synthesized from [127, 128].
   47
   Let's be clear about what Table 20.2 says. The production of 100 kcal of rice requires an input of 48 kcal, making it a net energy gain. Meanwhile, 100 kcal from beef takes 1,600 kcal of energy to produce, as an energy loser. Lamb and shrimp are very costly, while herring is a steal. It may seem surprising that eggs require more energy input than chicken, but consider that it takes longer for a chicken to produce its weight in eggs than for a chicken to get large enough to be processed for meat.
   Armed with this information, it is possible to assess a dietary energy factor48 for various dietary choices.
   47: Owning egg-laying chickens and feed- ing them scraps is a delightful win, however.

   Table 20.3: Dietary energy factor computa- tions for various diets. Energy factors are aggregations over categories from Table 20.2, assuming equal distributions when unknown (e.g., each fish type is 25% and each plant type is 10% of that category's in- take). The net effect, at bottom, is a weighted sum of the individual energy ratios, and spans large factors in terms of energy im- pact.
   In Table 20.3, the first column of numbers is a weighted average of factors from Table 20.2, using the distribution weights listed where available, and assuming equal spread otherwise. The next column scales the energy ratios so that the vegetable category has R1 = 1,49 making the dietary energy factor a measure of energy requirements relative to a strictly plant-based diet. For instance, red meat requires 37 times as much energy as vegetable matter, for the same metabolic energy content. What follows in the table are four diet types, reflecting the average American diet and three variants, each having its own set of fx factors.50
   Example 20.3.15 Let's replicate the American diet result in Table 20.3 using Eq. 20.1.
   Using fv = 0.72, frm = 0.09, ff = 0.01, fp = 0.05, and fa = 0.13, then Rv = 1, Rrm = 37, Rf = 55, Rp 8.5, and Ra = 8, the dietary energy factor computes to 0.72 +3.33+0.55+0.425 +1.04 = 6.07, confirming the final row. By breaking things out this way, the red meat category stands out as contributing more51 than any other category.
   Compared to a strictly plant-based (vegan) diet, the typical American diet requires about six times the energy. Since the average American diet accounts for 24 kWh per day, a vegan diet is therefore down to 4 kWh/day. A vegetarian diet partaking of dairy and eggs (lacto-ovo diet) is 2.4 times52 the vegan diet, or a little less than 40% of the American diet (about 9 kWh/day). Just replacing all meat consumption with chicken (final column) cuts energy demand in half. These are just a few of the countless examples that may be explored using Eq. 20.1 or variants thereof to evaluate the energy impact of dietary choices.
   49: The second column of numbers is the first column divided by 0.65.
   50: Note: contrived to add to 1 in each case.
   51: Red meat is 3.33, which is 55% of the total energy cost while providing only 9% of the dietary benefit.
   52: The actual number depends on the frac- tion of calories coming from dairy/eggs (fa), and can be dialed at will: it's not stuck at exactly 2.4.
   Get on it! Evaluate your own diet and how you might modify it.

   Example 20.3.16 What is the dietary energy factor for a diet in which one-third of caloric intake is from red meat, 10% is from dairy/eggs, and the rest is plant matter?
   Setting frm= 0.33 and fa = 0.10, we require that fy = 0.57 in order that all three sum to 1.0. Now using Rrm = 37, Ra = 8, and Ry = 1, the dietary energy factor computes to 12.2+0.8+0.57 = 13.6 for red meat, dairy, and vegetable matter, respectively. This diet requires more than twice the production energy as a standard American diet.
   It is possible to abandon Eq. 20.1 and roll your own formulation following similar principles. Rather than adopt the distributions from Table 20.2, the technique can be customized to any diet for which energy factors can be found.

   Example 20.3.17 A diet that is 35% rice, 35% wheat, 15% corn, 10% milk, and 5% chicken has an energy cost of 0.35 0.48+0.35 0.45+ 0.15 0.40+0.10.4.9+0.05.5.5 0.17+0.16+0.06+0.49+0.28 = 1.15. This has not been normalized to Ry
   1 yet, so we divide by the aggregate 0.65 value for the plant energy ratio found in Table 20.3 to get a dietary energy factor 1.8 times that of a strictly plant-based diet. Note from the sum that milk and chicken are the largest two contributors, despite being a small fraction of the diet.
   The 10:1 input:output energy ratio mentioned at the beginning of this diet segment may at first glance not square with the whole-diet energy factors computed here (e.g., a factor of 6 for the typical American diet). Missing is food waste. The U.S. produces 1.8 kcal of food value for every 1 kcal consumed [127]. This amount of waste may be hard to fathom, but consider waste at restaurants, cafeterias, and grocery stores when perishable items are not consumed before health standards suggest or require disposal. Still, this is an area ripe for improvement.
   20.3.5 Flexitarianism
   Echoing Point #5 in the list in Section 20.3.1, it is worth pointing out that energy and resource concerns are a largely quantitative game. One need not become a strict vegan to affect energy demands substantively. For instance, eating meat one meal a week,54 and tending to stick to poultry when doing so would drop the energy factor of Eq. 20.1 to a value so near to 1.0 that the difference is of little consequence.
   Example 20.3.18 For instance, if one meal per week, or about one in 40 of your meals looks like the last column in Table 20.3-72% plant-based and the rest poultry and dairy-what is the dietary energy factor for this diet?
   Since only one in 40 meals is of this type, multiply the poultry and
   53: In other words, if performing the same sort of calculation for 10% contributions from each of the ten plant-based foods in Table 20.2, the raw result would be 0.65.

   dairy contributions by
   and adjust f、 to bring the total to 1.0. Doing so yields f、 = 0.993, fp = 0.00375, and fa=0.00325. Multiplying by the respective Rx values and summing produces 1.05.
   Thus, the one meal of poultry/dairy per week achieves 99% of the journey from normal-American (6.1) to full vegan (1.0), from an energy perspective.
   The result of Example 20.3.18 is so nearly 1.0 that it is essentially indistin- guishable from a purely plant-based diet, quantitatively. This is especially true in the context that the rule-of-thumb factors are themselves not to be taken literally as high-precision numbers. All pork will not have an energy ratio of 27.0. All tuna will not be 17.0. All wheat will not be 0.45. The methods of producing the food-of all types become important at this stage. Note that gardening (and canning) one's own food is a way to nourish ourselves at a super-low resource burden-undercutting the nominal vegan energy factor even further.
   55
   The quantitative focus suggests an approach best called flexitarianism. If energy and resources are the primary concern, rather than ethical issues around eating meat, then the occasional meat treat is no big deal. Under this scheme, it is still possible to enjoy traditional foods on special occasions like holidays.56 If a friend serves meat at a dinner party, just do the quick calculation and realize that you can easily offset later57 and make this special-occasion meal disappear into the quantitative noise. The perception you generate is therefore more likely to be as a grateful friend, rather than as a person whose needs are difficult to satisfy.
   More people are likely to be attracted to join in responsible behaviors if they are not too rigid or strict. Imagine ordering a bean, rice, and cheese burrito only to take a bite and discover a morsel of meat inside. Score! Meat Treat! It doesn't have to be a bad thing, if resource cost is what matters most. This flexibility can also apply to waste food. Before watching meat get thrown into the trash, intercept with your mouth. From a resource point of view, wasting meat-or any food, really-is also something we should strive to avoid: better that the energy investment produce metabolic benefit than be utterly wasted.
   20.3.6 Discretionary Summary
   We don't have direct and immediate control over all the energy expendi- tures made on our behalf in the same way that we have control over our own light switches and thermostats. Yet, we must accept our communal share of energy and resources used by governmental, military, indus- trial, agricultural and commercial sectors providing us with structure, protection, goods, and services. The 10,000 W average American power frequently used as a benchmark throughout this book and mapping to 240 kWh per day is not all in our direct control. Individuals can make

   58
   Of the things that are under our discretion, as discussed in the sections above, Table 20.4 summarizes the average American values and those of the author in 2019.5% Recall that the average American air travel corre- sponds to just 2,300 miles (3,700 km) per year. If adding consumerism to the personally-controlled energy toll, perhaps an average American spends $10-20,000 per year on "stuff," which would amount to another 25-50 kWh per day if using the rule-of-thumb 1 kWh/$ from Section 20.3.2.
   Combining the discretionary factors in Table 20.4 and a consumerism estimate, Americans have direct control over about half of their total energy footprint.60 As the author demonstrates, it is possible to make drastic cuts to this portion-in this case a factor of three lower than average. Mostly, this comes about by a combination of awareness, caring, and tolerance for a simpler life without every possible comfort.
   Box 20.2: Out of Our Control
   Many energy expenditures are part of a consensus social contract that individuals cannot easily control. Examples would be lighting and interior temperature control policies for large common spaces like office buildings, campuses, libraries, and airports, for instance. Likewise for street lighting in neighborhoods and along highways. Only by large scale shifts in values would the community potentially prioritize energy and resource costs over financial cost or public health and safety.

   20.4 Values Shifts
   In the end, a bold reformulation of the human approach to living on this planet will only succeed if societal values change from where they are now. Imagine if the following activities were frowned upon-found distasteful and against social norms:
1. keeping a house warm enough in winter to wear shorts inside;

   20 Adaptation Strategies

2. keeping a house so cool in summer that people's feet get cold; 3. having 5 cars in an oversized garage;
4. accumulating enough air miles to be in a special "elite" club; 5. taking frequent, long, hot showers;
6. using a clothes dryer during a non-rainy period;
7. having a constant stream of delivery vehicles arrive at the door; 8. a full waste bin each week marking high consumption;
9. having a high-energy-demand diet (frequent meat consumption); 10. upgrading a serviceable appliance, disposing of the old;
11. wasteful lighting.
    At present, many of these activities connote success and are part of a culture of "conspicuous consumption." If such things ran counter to the sensibilities of the community, the behaviors would no longer
    carry
    social value and would be abandoned. The social norms in some Scandinavian countries praise egalitarianism and find public displays of being "better" or of having more money/stuff to be in poor taste. Abandonment of consumerist norms could possibly work, but only if it stems from a genuine understanding of the negative consequences. If curtailment of resource-heavy activities is imposed by some authority or is otherwise reluctantly adopted, it will not be as likely to transform societal values.
    While it may seem objectionable, it is worth recognizing that public shame carries surprising power.61 A recent experiment in Bolivia put traffic monitors on the streets wearing zebra costumes62 to combat irresponsible driving habits endangering pedestrians. The zebras would "call out" violators by making a show and pointing to the offenders. That simple action has been effective. Other cultures have required perpetrators of unsavory acts to stand in a public place for a day wearing a sign announcing their transgression, recognizing the power of public shame. It is difficult to imagine similar remedies today, and for many good reasons.63
    Yet our society has perhaps gotten too far away from personal ownership of actions. Anonymity in our modern world promotes rude behavior: on roads, on the internet, and in heavily-populated urban areas, where often no one within sight is familiar. If environmentally costly activities were to acquire taboo status, it is pretty certain we would see far less of it, for fear of shame.
    61: The author became aware of this power in the context of student project demon- strations open to the whole department to watch. The prospect of public failure pro- vided supplemental motivation for students to work super-hard-harder than the au- thor typically observed in other courses.

    20.5 Flexibility as an Answer to Uncertainty
    No one has a crystal ball. No one can credibly say what the future holds. Anyone claiming that we're heading for certain complete collapse should not be trusted. But neither should someone who says everything will be glorious. It is not hard to find either sort of message in this world, yet we cannot discern with confidence which is ultimately correct.

    While this text may seem more aligned toward a grim outlook, it is somewhat intentional as a means to raise awareness toward what seems like a minority view-without crossing the line and claiming any certainty on the possible perils ahead.

    utter disaster
    see, we were fine
    plan B

    inconvenience
    Another rationale for this book's tone relates to asymmetric risk (Figure 20.1). If we take potentially catastrophic threats seriously and at least formulate plans to mitigate them, then little harm is done if the threat does not materialize: just "wasted" time and effort being careful.64 But ignoring the threat could mean "game over." Even if the probability of the threat is low, like 10%, it is worthy of attention if the consequences of ignoring it could be devastating. People routinely buy insurance for similar reasons: to mitigate low-probability but potentially debilitating
    events.
    That said, how does a person navigate their own life choices under a cloud of existential uncertainty? One answer is to pick avenues that can be useful in either eventuality. Choosing a route that only makes sense if things hum along as they have done for the past many decades could be risky. So put some thought into directions that are likely to be valued whether or not the human endeavor suffers large setbacks. Be flexible. Mostly, this involves imagining a more difficult future and asking what paths still work in that scenario, while still having a place in today's world.
    What skills or functions will likely always be valuable? One approach is to think about what elements of human existence are likely to always be present. We will always need food, shelter, health care, transportation, fabrication capability, resource utilization, wisdom, and entertainment. The exact form ranges from primitive to high-tech. But not every profes- sion supported today has an obvious place on this list. In the face of this, it seems worthwhile to learn the fundamentals of any vocation you elect to pursue, so that if deprived of all the technological assistance available today, you can fall back on the basics and still achieve some worthwhile results.
    65
    A first step may be to become less reliant on technology for simple tasks. Use brains more and devices less. The practice will lead to greater mental capacity in any outcome. Do math in your head. Learn and retain important facts and concepts, so that Google is not required to form full thoughts.

    Try modes of living that are less cushy than normal, even if temporarily. A week-long backpacking trip is a great way to feel like a part of nature, and come to understand that some level of discomfort or hardship is tolerable or even confidence-building.66 The first few days may be a difficult adjustment, but it is surprising how well and how quickly adaptation can happen-given time, decent weather, and a constructive attitude. After doing this a few times, minor inconveniences or discom- forts that arise might be met with far greater grace. The person who remains stable in the face of adversity will be more resilient than of their peers, and can help others hold things together in crisis.
    Keep in mind that humans evolved outdoors, dealt with seasons, and often went many days without food. When did we become so fragile that we need to live within a narrow temperature range to be comfortable, and lose our heads if we don't get three square meals a day? What would our ancestors think of us? By learning to toughen up, the future— whatever way it goes-will have less power over us. We can strive to be less vulnerable and at the mercy of events beyond our control. We will have some agency to cope and help others cope with any variety of outcomes. Just by having some confidence in our ability to deal with a bit of adversity or discomfort will allow us to keep cooler heads and be able to recognize important opportunities if and when they come along, rather then being paralyzed by distress.
    Hopefully, such preparedness will never be truly needed. And how bad would it be if we "built some character" along the way for no reason.

    20.6 Upshot on Strategies
    No one can know what fate awaits us, or control the timing of whatever unfolds. But individuals can take matters into their own hands and adopt practices that are more likely to be compatible with a future defined by reduced resource availability. We can learn to communicate future concerns constructively, without being required to paint an artificial picture of hope.67 Our actions and choices, even if not showcased, can serve as inspiration for others—or at least can be personally rewarding as an impactful adventure. Quantitative assessment of energy and resource demands empowers individuals to make personal choices carrying large impacts. Reductions of factors of 2 and 3 and 4 are not out of reach. Maybe the world does not need 18 TW to be happy. Maybe we don't have to work so hard to maintain a peaceful and rewarding lifestyle once growth is not the driver. Maybe we can re-learn how to adapt to the seasons and be fulfilled by a more intimate connection with nature. The value of psychological preparedness should not underestimated. By staring unblinking into the abyss, we are ready to cope with disruption, should it come. And if it never does in our lifetimes, what loss do we

    really suffer if we have chosen our adventure and lived our personal values?
    In this sense, the best adaptation comes in the form of a mental shift. Letting go of humanity's self-image as a growth juggernaut, and finding an "off-ramp" to a more rewarding lifestyle in close partnership with nature is the main goal. The guidelines provided in this chapter for quantifying and reducing resource demands then simply become the initial outward expressions of this fresh vision. Ignore the potentially counterproductive allure of fusion, teleportation, and warp drive. Em- brace instead a humbler, slower, more feasible future that stresses natural harmony over conquest and celebrates life in all forms-while preserving and advancing the knowledge and understanding of the universe we have worked so hard to achieve. Picture a future citizen of this happier world looking back at the present age as embarrassingly misguided and inexplicably delusional. Earth is a partner, not a possession to be exploited. Figuratively throwing Earth under the bus precludes our own chances for long-term success. A common phrasing68 of this sentiment is that humans are a part of nature, not apart from nature. Let's not lose the path in a flight of fossil-fueled fantasy.

2. Why is the lack of open acknowledgment that collapse is a distinct possibility itself more likely to facilitate exactly that outcome?

5. Come up with an example in life of a predicament that can't be directly solved, but perhaps side-stepped to get around it without eliminating or "solving" the problem's origin.

    Epilogue
    350
    This book may be distressing for some: a body-slam to hope. The message can be more than some are ready to take in, or of an unacceptable flavor. I myself first approached this subject-when assigned to teach a general-education course on energy and the environment-with great enthusiasm, intending to sort out to my own satisfaction how I thought our gleaming future would migrate to renewable energy.
    As I "ran the numbers" on various sources, I came to appreciate the tremendous quantitative advantage that solar power has over the alter- natives. Being a hands-on person, I started cobbling together various off-grid photovoltaic systems, learning the practical ins and outs of stand-alone solar power1 coupled with storage as a crucial means to mitigate intermittency of the solar resource. My wife and I also bought a plug-in hybrid vehicle in 2013 to learn the pros and cons2 of electric cars, while preserving the ability to do occasional longer trips on gasoline. My commute to work is via an electric-assist bicycle charged by my off-grid solar system for a fossil-free transportation option.3 I have found adventure and delight in challenging myself to live a lower-energy lifestyle, and know from personal experience that dialing down demand does not have to be a crushing defeat for the human race. Our ambitions1 might suffer, but our spirits need not.
    This book takes an approach that deliberately asks the wrong question, chapter after chapter: how can we keep going in a manner resembling the present form in the face of declining fossil fuel resources and/or a commitment to wean ourselves from fossil fuels as a mitigation strategy for climate change? This approach manifested itself as: can we get 18 TW of power5 from this or that alternative resource? In most cases, the answer was no. Solar is the glaring exception. Also, nuclear breeders- bringing a tangle of tough problems-and the perpetually intractable nuclear fusion could offer long term provision of electricity. But none of the abundant resources easily replace liquid fuels for transportation, and effective utilization of the abundant yet intermittent solar resource depends critically on storage capabilities.
    Thus, pretending that the goal is to keep 18 TW and carry on business as usual after a tidy substitution of energy turns out to be misguided. The real question becomes one of adapting to a new landscape: one in which our ambitions are checked by planetary limits. Indeed, if energy became essentially unlimited by some technology, I shudder to think what it would mean for the rest of the planet." An age-old saying goes: With great power comes great responsibility. Humans have achieved great power, but have not yet demonstrated a respectable degree of responsibility in prioritizing the protection of plants, animals, and ecosystems.

    Should attention to planetary limits turn out to be a crucial element in the assessment of our situation, then we owe it to ourselves to get it straight. Imagine that you are running across a rooftop and have to make a quick decision about whether to jump a large gap between buildings. Would you appreciate a lightning-quick analysis of physics concluding that a successful jump is impossible? Certainly, such insight would be valuable, permitting the formation of an alternate plan, and saving yourself from the unfortunate fate of misplaced faith in your jumping abilities or in some fanciful notion of gravity's weak grip over the chasm.8
    Humanity is staring at a leap unlike anything history has prepared us to face, having accelerated ourselves to previously unimaginable speeds by the grace of fossil fuels, but now confronting their inevitable removal from the menu. The past offers little guidance on how to navigate such a situation, so we need to do our level best to soberly assess the challenges and recognize what is and what is not within the realm of practical expectations. I would love to be wrong about the numerous concerns raised in the book, but the asymmetric risk of trying the leap and failing could lead to a devastation that frightens me. Please, let us not risk it all on unfounded hopes or magical thinking."

    The situation reminds me of the housing bubble in the U.S. in the early 2000s. My wife and I bought a house when we moved to San Diego in 2003, and soon became worried about a potential crash10 leaving us "underwater"-owing more than the reduced worth of the house. I pored over articles on the matter, and found two camps. One camp provided rafts of alarming quantitative analysis of the peril: sub-prime lending, soaring price-to-income ratios, unprecedented unaffordability by average families, vulnerability to any weakness in other sectors. The other camp said that the housing market was manifesting a new normal, that San Diego's universal appeal would prevent a price drop, that scary lending practices were easily skirted by re-financing before interest payments ballooned. I chose to go with the quantitative analysis over the hand-wavy platitude-based set of beliefs, and am glad that I did.
    Now consider the quality and nature of common counter-arguments to the core message in this book. Humans are smart, innovative, and will figure out something. People 200 years ago could not have possibly predicted our capabilities today, so we are likewise ill-equipped to predict how amazing the future will be. I get the appeal. I really do. But does that mean we get to dismiss the difficulties exposed by careful analysis? Can we ignore the fact that we are pushing planetary boundaries for the first time ever? I would argue that this time really is different. The facts are inescapable:
    11
    The world has never before been strained with 8 billion people.12
    ► Fossil fuels bear tremendous responsibility for our recent climb.
    7:
    as might happen in a movie
    8: The Matrix, while an excellent movie, encourages physics-breaking thinking. Not to be a kill-joy, but it probably is air you're breathing, and that probably is a spoon.
    9: More often, lack of critical thought is to blame: unconscious assumptions about how the future will unfold based on recent, anomalous history.
    10: Aha! Am I just a recurrent predictor of crashes? Not at all. Numerous times, I had faith in rising markets and prospects for achieving success in difficult endeav- ors. Meanwhile, I blew off concerns of Y2K (Box 20.1; p. 329) and even downplayed the COVID-19 pandemic in early 2020-in both cases on the premise that high levels of awareness and fear would trigger massive attention and mitigating actions by respon- sible governments and stakeholders. In the COVID case, my faith in competence was sadly misplaced: I was too optimistic.
    11: The wolf did come in the apocryphal tale. The adults should accept some responsibil- ity for their failures, rather than throwing the "boy who cried" under the bus.
    12: ... and growing

    Fossil fuels are a one-time resource- -an inheritance that will not continue propelling the future, and nature does not guarantee a superior substitute.
    ▸ Wild spaces on the planet are rapidly diminishing as development spreads and resources are culled. Permanent extinction of species accompanies pollution and habitat loss.
    ► Climate change and habitat destruction threaten a mass extinc- tion and environmental disruption whose full consequences are unpredictable.
    Modern human constructs13 have not stood the test of time, and are unlikely to do so given that they have not been founded on principles of sustainable harmony within planetary limits.
    Any convincing counter-argument about why we need not take this seemingly perilous position seriously would itself need to be serious- relying less on general faith in human abilities and more on nuts- and-bolts details: How are we going to supply energy needs without fossil fuels? It isn't good enough to say "solar and wind," without specifying how we deal with the glaring mismatch between demand and intermittent energy availability. What would we use to provide sufficient storage? Do we have the materials and means to make enough battery capacity? What is our strategy for battery upkeep and replacement? How will we afford the new scheme and its prohibitive up-front costs? What about agriculture: how do we permanently fix soil degradation; aquifer depletion? How do we halt deforestation, habitat loss, and resulting permanent extinctions? What is the specific global governance plan to protect planetary resources and deal with the consequences of climate change? How do we structure economies to be complacent and functional without a foundation in growth?
    14
    As it is, we have no credible global plan11 to deal with these foundational global problems. We owe it to ourselves to do a better job than imagine that the future may work out just fine.15 We need to face the challenges, put pencil to paper, and craft a plan that could work-even if it involves some compromise or sacrifice. Let us not forget that we do not have the authority to conjure any reality we might dream: we have no choice but to adapt to the physical world as we find it.
    Returning to the analogy of receiving quantitative analysis on a contem- plated leap across a chasm-having indicated serious shortcomings in the notion of maintaining current luxuries-please think twice about trying to carry our resource-heavy ways into the future in heroic fashion. Ignominious failure, not glory, may lie there. But this does not mean the human endeavor has been all for naught, and that we should just sit down and cry about dashed dreams. Let's be smart about this: heed the warning signs; alter course; re-imagine the future; design a new adventure.

    13: ... economic, political, societal, agricul- tural, provision of energy and material re- sources, manufacturing, buildings, and vir- tually everything else
    Those who tend to dismiss collapse per- ils are unlikely to detail a cogent plan of the sort solicited here, because to do so would require some acknowledgment that the exercise is necessary and valuable. No one yet has produced a comprehensive and widely accepted plan for just how all this is supposed to work out!
    14:
    largely due to lack of consensus that we even need a non-growth plan
    15: The burden of proof is on those who argue for continued modernity: ample ev- idence indicates that humans can live in primitive relation to nature for tens of thou- sands of years, but no evidence demon- strates that it can survive in anything like the mode of the last century or two for very long. Even the universe fails to deliver evidence (see Sec. 18.4; p. 312).
    16: If the dreams were never realistic, then good riddance!

    challenges and succeeding at (some of) them.17 Indeed, my irrational hope is that a textbook like this may help get people thinking proactively about changing the course of humanity. In that spirit of wild-eyed opti- mism, I leave you with the following upbeat-adjacent thoughts about the world into which we may endeavor to gracefully adapt:
    Crisis is opportunity: we have a chance to transform the human relationship with this planet.
    Imagine the relief in shedding an old narrative of growth and faulty ambitions that only seems to be creating increasingly intractable problems instead side-stepping to make a fresh start under a whole new conception of humanity's future. It's liberating!
    ► People alive today get to witness and shape what may turn out to be the most pivotal moment in human history, as we confront the realities of planetary limits.
    ► Committed pursuit of steady-state principles could set up reward- ing lives for countless generations.
    Nature is truly amazing, and making it a larger part of our world 18 could be very rewarding.
    ► We, as individuals, are privileged to witness and celebrate the much grander phenomenon of life in this universe: let's be hum- ble participants and value this role over some misguided, ill- considered, hubristic, and perhaps juvenile attempt at dominance.
    ► We have learned so much about how the universe works, and have the opportunity for greater insights still if we can find a glide-path to a long-term sustainable existence. We have built much of value that bears preservation. Posterity19 relies on a successful embrace of a new vision.
    We may yet learn to value nature above ourselves, to the enduring benefit of us all.
    That would be a fine way to end the book, so pause for a moment to take in that last point. Richard Feynman once mused about what one, compact sentence transmitted to the future would best help a derailed, post-apocalyptic society get back on track.20 He decided: “Everything is made of atoms." Personally, I think that misses the mark-putting too much emphasis on the values of (some small subset of) our present civilization. Think about what you would want to communicate. For me, the final point above might suggest something along the lines of: Treat nature at least as well as we treat ourselves.
    17: This is harder for pessimists to pull off: one has to believe in what is possible to get started on years-long ambitious undertak- ings.
    18:
    ...as
    opposed to hacking it down to ever-smaller parcels
    19: Billionaires who strive for immortal recognition by launching the human race into space are likely to fail and be forgotten, while those who set us on a truly sustain- able path have by design a better shot at long-term respect.
    20: ... as if the present track would even be deemed desirable: if such a catastrophic de- railment comes to pass, maybe our wisdom is not worth so much.
