APPENDICES 
Math and Equations 
A 
Depending on background, math and equations may be an intimidat- ing "foreign language" to some students. This brief appendix aims to offer a refresher on techniques, and hopefully inspire a more peaceful relationship for students. 
A.1 Relax on the Decimals 
First, we can form a more natural, forgiving relationship with numbers. Like your friends, they need not be held to exacting standards: they are simply trying to tell you something useful. Remembering that π is roughly 3 is far more important than committing any further decimals to 
memory. 
If a friend traced out a circle in the sand and asked how much area it had,1 the poorly-defined and irregular boundary defies precise measurement, so why carry extra digits. Maybe just recognize that the radius is roughly one meter, so the area is about 3 square meters. Done.2 The message here is to give yourself a break and just not over-represent the precision (number of decimals) in your answer. 
Part of the reason students have a rigid relationship with numbers is because homework and test problems tend to come pre-loaded with numbers assumed to be exactly known. But the real world is seldom so generous, leaving us to forage for approximate numbers and estima- 
tions. 
By being approximate in our use of numbers, we are liberated to do math in our heads more readily. Practice can make this into a life-long skill that becomes second nature. It is helpful to know some shortcuts. 
Example A.1.1 To explore the flavor of approximate math, let's con- sider the statement: 
π ~ √10 
~ 
10 
3 
~ 
3. 
Your calculator will disagree, but that's why we use the 
symbol 
(similar) instead of = (equal). Another common option is ≈ (approxi- mately). Your calculator is not as clever as you, and can't appreciate when things are close. It's pedantic. Literal. You can be better. 
How do we use this loose association? We saw one example of using 
3 before, so will not repeat here.

A.11 Just the Start 
1: Now that's a quality friend! 
2: Also notice that the circle fits within a 
square 2 meters on a side, so the area should be less than 4 m2: it hangs together. 
Some classes formalize the concept of sig- nificant digits, which is all well and good. But such systems can add to the stress of students learning the material (one more thing that can be wrong!).

What about √10 3?3 This implies that 3 x 3 10, which is true enough (because 9 and 10 are very close; only 10% different). This means if you pay me $30 per day for a month, I know immediately that's about $1,000. Is the month 30 days, or 31? Who cares? Knowing I'll have an extra ~$1,000 is a good enough basis to make reasonable plans, so it's very useful, if not precise. 
5 
How about 10 ~ 3?4 This one is actually pretty similar to saying that √10~3, since both imply 3x3 ~ 10. To use another example, let's say you land a $100,000/yr job, but can only work for 4 months (a third of a year). If 10~3, then you'd expect to get about $30,000. Why mess around being more precise? Taxes will be larger than the imprecision anyway. Again, it's good enough to have a sense, and make plans. 
Much like we have multiplication tables stamped into our heads, it is often very useful to have a few reciprocals floating around to help us do quick mental math. Some examples are given in Table A.1 that multiply to 10. Students are encouraged to add more examples to the table, filling in the gaps with their favorite numbers. 
The values in Table A.1 are selected to multiply to 10, which is an arbitrary but convenient choice. This lets us "wrap around" the table and continue past three down to 2.5, 2, etc. and learn that the entry for 1.5 would be 6.67. To make effective use of the table, forget where the decimal point is located! Think of the reciprocal of 8 as being "1.25-like," meaning it might be 0.125, 12.5, or some other cousin. The essential feature is 125. Likewise, the reciprocal of 2.5 is going to start with a 4. 
Example A.1.2 How is Table A.1 useful to us? We can turn division problems, which tend to be mentally challenging, into more intu- itive multiplication problems. Several examples may highlight their usefulness. 
What is one eighth of 1,000? Rather than carry out division, just multiply 1,000 by the reciprocal-a "125-like" number. In this case, the answer is 125. We can use common sense and intuition to reject 1,250 as of 1,000, as we know the answer should be significantly smaller than 1,000. But 12.5 goes too far. Also, we can recognize that is not too far from one-tenth, one-tenth of 1,000 would be 100, close 
to 125. 
How many hours is one minute? Now we are looking for one-sixtieth () of an hour, so we pull out the "167-like" reciprocal and weigh the choices 0.167, 0.0167, 0.00167, etc. Well, can't be too far from 100 which would be 0.01. We expect the result to be a little bigger than 100' leaving us to have one minute as 0.0167 of an hour. 
Now we do a few quick statements that may not match our table exactly for all cases, but you should be able to "read between the lines" using blurry numbers to reconcile the statements. One out of seven 
3: Really V10≈ 3.162. 
4: Really it's about 3.333. 
5: Money examples often seem easier to mentally grasp because we deal with money all the time. To the extent that money exam- ples are easier, it says that the math itself isn't hard: the unfamiliar context is often what trips students up.

Americans is roughly 15%. A month is about 8% (0.08) of a year. Six goes into 100 a little more than 16 times. Four quarters make up a dollar. π fits into 10 about 7 times. Each student in a 30-student class represents about 3% of the class population. 
Some students view math and numbers as dangerous, unwelcoming territory-maybe like deep water in which they might drown. But think about dolphins, who not only are not afraid to immerse themselves in deep water (numbers), but frolic and play on its surface. Numbers can be that way too: flinging them this way and that to see that a calculation makes sense in lots of different ways. Humans are not natural-born swimmers, but we can learn to be comfortable in water. Likewise, we can learn to be quantitatively comfortable and even have fun messing around. So get your floaties on and jump in! 
A.2 Forget the Rules

A.2 Forget the Rules 
Math, in some ways, is just an expression of truth-a logic about relationships between numbers and their manipulations. It is easy to be overwhelmed by all the rules taught to us in math classes through the years, and students' can lose sight of the simple and verifiable logic underneath it all. Most math mistakes come from faulty or deteriorating memorization. The good news is that we can usually do simple tests to make sure we're getting it right. The lesson is not to memorize math! Math makes logical sense, and we can create the right rules by understanding a few core concepts. This section attempts to teach this skill. 
Consider for a moment the concept of language (and see Box A.1 for fun examples). Language is riddled with rules of grammar and spelling, yet we learn to speak without needing to know what adjectives or prepositions are. We learn the rules later, after speaking is second-nature. And unlike math, the rules of language can defy logic and have many exceptions. In this sense, math is much easier and more natural. It is the language of the universe. We would likely share no words in common with an alien species, but we can be sure that we would agree on the integers, how they add and multiply, all the way up through calculus and other advanced mathematical concepts. We can use its innate nature 
to expose 
the rules for ourselves. 
Box A.1: Rules of Language 
Let's step aside for a moment to explore how rules of language are obvious to us without explicit thought." Consider the following constructions: trlaqtoef; flort; aoipw; squeet; yparumd. None of these are English words, but only two of them are even worthy of consideration as viable words. The others violate “unspoken" rules 
7:... teachers, too! 
8: Except, perhaps we would learn that we inexplicably share the word "sock."

A.3 Areas and Volumes 362 
about how letters might be arranged in relation to each other. We recognize the nonsense without being able to cite specific rules. Math can work the same way: we can rely on intuition to rule out nonsense. 
How about this collection of four words: that, how, happen, did. Now arrange them into a single sentence, ignoring punctuation. Notwithstanding how Yoda might arrange things, only one of the 24 possible arrangements10 makes a single valid sentence. Have you intuited what it is? How did that happen? Without conscious thought, you understand the underlying rules of grammar well enough to see the answer without having to sift through all the combinations. Math can work like that, too. 
10: The number of combinations is 4! (four- factorial), or 4.3.2.1. It is a worthy exercise to write out all 24 combinations, not only to verify the result but to give practice in how to systematically shuffle the words in an orderly manner-inventing your own functional rules as you go. You might even stumble on why 4.3.2.1 is the right way to count the combinations based on your method of systematizing. 
A.3 Areas and Volumes 
This book, and the problems within, often assume facility in computing areas or volumes of some basic shapes. Students who have focused on memorizing formulas may see a jumble of л, r to various powers, and some hard-to-remember numerical coefficients. For circles and spheres, how do we bring order to the mess? 
w 
1= 
A helpful trick is to turn the circle into a square, or the sphere into a cube, where our footing is more secure. Hopefully it is clear that the perimeter (length around) of a square whose side length is a will be 4a. The area will be a a = a2. Units can help us, too: if a 
3 m, then the perimeter should also be a length with units of meters and the area should be in square meters. It would never do to have something like a2 describe a perimeter (wrong units) or to have the area not contain something like a2. The cube version has volume a3. 
11 
About those circles and spheres: The task is to fit a circle or sphere inside of a square or cube, so that a = 2r. In other words, the diameter (2r, where r is radius) fits neatly across the side length of the square. The perimeter of the circle should be smaller than the 4a perimeter of the square,11, but a good deal larger than 2a, which would represent a round trip directly across the square, through its center.12 So the circle perimeter is between 2a and 4a, probably not far from 3a. Since a = 2r, the perimeter should be somewhat close to 6r. Suspecting that л ~ 3 shows up somewhere, the leap is not far to the perimeter being 2лr. 
Likewise for the area: a circle within the square has an area smaller than that of the surrounding square (a2), but surely larger than half the square area—maybe around three-quarters. In terms of radius, the whole square has area a2 = 4r2, and three-quarters of this is 3r2~ πr2. Correct again! 
Volume is a little harder to visualize, but again the sphere will have a volume smaller than that of the cube: a3 = 8r3. Maybe the sphere's

. literally cutting corners 
12: This path would look like a line across 
the square, traversed twice as a there-and- back trip. 
 
volume is about half that of the cube, so 4r3. But where would a л go? It's always a multiplier in these situations, so we can harmlessly throw in a pi/3 ~ 1 factor to get a volume 
r3. 
The point is that forgetting the exact formulas is not fatal: just back up to a more familiar setting and build out from there. For cylinders, just combine elements of circular and rectangular geometries to realize that the volume is the area of the circle times the height13 of the cylinder. External surface area is twice the areas of the end-caps (each лr2) plus the perimeter of the circle times the height-as if rolling out the skin into a rectangle and calculating its area.

A.4 Fractions 
Stressed about fractions? Do you have an intuitive sense for what half a pie (1) would look like? A fifth of a pie (1)? Which is larger: one-third () of a pie or one-quarter (4)? Do you have an immediate sense of how many quarters are in a dollar? Back to the pie: if a friend hands you two pie plates, each containing a third (3) of a pie, do you now have less than half of a pie in total, more than half, or exactly half? If you had little trouble picturing and answering these questions, then you're all set! 
But isn't there a lot more to fractions: rules of adding, subtracting, multiplying, and dividing? What about common denominators and all that business? The point of this section is that you can build on your natural intuition14 to verify and construct the right rules for how the 
mechanics of fractions should work. You're not in the dark! 
First, representation. What does mean? Literally, we can say that we divide something (a pie, for instance) into 5 pieces (denominator) and extract 1 (numerator). Implicitly, we are multiplying the something (pie) by the fraction. Now what about something like? We can interpret this multiple ways,15 which we will express several ways: 
1 
6 
3 = 1 
pie = (3 pies) pie (2 pies) 
10 
3 
=

(A.1) 
Figure A.1 shows the first two options in Eq. A.1 graphically. We can either slice one pie into five slices and take three of them, or slice three pies into five equal pieces and take one. Either way, we end up with the same amount. The possibilities are endless, and it is worth concocting your own variants. The last steps in Eq. A.1 hint at one type of freedom: we could split one pie into 10 pieces and select 6. Or we could split two pies into ten pieces and take 3 of those to end up with the same amount of pie. 
Let's formulate rules about multiplication of fractions based on stuff we know (intuition). What is the rule for the general multiplication of two fractions, expressed symbolically so we can substitute any number

Figure A.1: Paralleling Eq. A.1, we can slice one pie into five equal pieces (left) and keep three of them (lower left); or we can split three pies into equal-area pieces (same color; sometimes split up across different pies) and take one of the resulting pieces. In both cases, the bottom row is the same amount of pie: of one pie equals of three pies. 
for any symbol (placeholder) and get the right answer? In other words, what should the question marks be in the following:

(A.2) 
To answer, pick a scenario you already know and back-out the answer. You know that one half of one-half is one quarter. You also know that one half of must be, or that three thirds must be a whole "one." In math terms:

From these examples and others that can be fabricated as wished or needed-it is possible to arrive at the conclusion that

(A.4) 
In other words, just multiply the numerators together and multiply the denominators together, simplifying by common factors as needed. 
Example A.4.1 What is of the fraction? By the straight rules, we get 30 in the numerator and 120 in the denominator.16 Many common factors appear in the numerator and denominator (even the original 
could have been reduced to) to give the final answer of 1. 
15 
24 
One more framing of fractions and their relationship to multiplication and division: dividing by 8 is the same as multiplying by . Multiplying by is the same as dividing by 2. Multiplication and division are thus essentially the same, only having to flip the number or fraction upside-down into its reciprocal. 
How can our intuition assist us in figuring out addition and subtraction of fractions? Use what you know: 
16: We can apply our lesson on reciprocals (see Example A.1.2) and realize that multi- plying 24 by 5 is a lot like dividing it by 2, up to a decimal place. This gives us something 12-like and thus 120.

(A.5) 
Hopefully, the first two statements in Eq. A.5 are apparent enough. The 
 
last one bounds the answer by what you already know. Since is larger than 1.17 So adding + must be larger than += 2. By similar logic, since one-third is smaller than one-half,18 their sum must be smaller 
than 1. 
Adding fractions like and is where common denominators come in. We can add numerators only if the fractions share the same denominator. We never add denominators. We can't replicate the middle example in Eq. A.5 by adding numerators and denominators, or we would get the nonsense answer? , rather than 2. 
== 
So how would we ever recreate the whole common denominator scheme based on intuition? Let's return to the case of +. We have already bounded it to be between 0.75 and 1.0 (in Eq. A.5), which is already useful as a check to whatever rule we might try. Looking at the problem graphically, as in Figure A.2, we see that overlaying and naturally creates a missing gap of 1. How do 2 and 3 in the denominators conspire to form 6? Via multiplication, of course. Re-expressing as 3 and as 2,19 allows us to add the numerators directly, having made the denominators the same: += .

To some students, this may seem like an unnecessary and elementary review,20 but the main point is that when in doubt, use what you already know to test your technique and verify that you are doing things right. If the rules you are trying to apply seem to work for a few different known cases, then you're probably golden. Approaching math this way makes you the boss of the formulas, rather than the other way around. 
A.5 Integer Powers

17: Splitting a pie into three parts will surely leave larger pieces than splitting it into more (4) parts, so (> 1). 
18: If such statements are less than intuitive, think about pie or money, where the natural context lends itself to better intuition. 
The point of this section (and appendix) is that you can use what you already know to check whether you are applying the right rules, and even re-create the rules that work-verifying that you get the answers you expect for cases you know and trust. Dis- cover for yourself! Doing so gives you full ownership of the math. It's no longer some- thing someone taught you to do: you've taught it to yourself, and that is far more powerful.

A.5 Integer Powers 
Raising a number to a power, like 43, is just a mathematical shorthand for 4 4 4. Think of all the room we save in the case of 423!

So what are the rules for dealing with exponents when we raise the whole thing to another power, or when we multiply two exponentiated pieces together, or if we divide by (or invert) the thing? In other words, what are: 
(xa)b =? x2 • x¶ =? 
1 
xn 
=? 
(A.6) 
The theme of this appendix is: discover the rule through your own experimentation. Tackling in stages, what is (74)3? We can write out 74 as 7.7.7.7 easily enough. If we cube this number, it's the same as 
 
Notice that the the symbols used in this equation are just stand-ins for numbers, and have no intrinsic significance-whether we use n or p or a for an exponent is irrelevant. For that matter, x is not special either and we could have used a hexagon to stand in for the base in these relations, as a symbolic placeholder. 
A.6 Fractional Powers 
366 
writing this set three times, all multiplied together, or (7.7.7.7) X (7.7.7.7)x(7.7.7.7), which is just 12 sevens multiplied, or 712. So we have discovered/formulated the rule: 
(x) = xa.b 
(A.7) 
We multiply the exponents when raising the inner exponent to an outer 
one. 
How about 32.35? What is the rule there? The process21 is similar to before, expanding out to (33) x (3-3-3-3-3), which just looks like seven threes multiplied together, or 37. Therefore, our rule is: 
xPx = x(p+q). 
(A.8) 
We add exponents when multiplying two pieces, each having their own exponent. Note that this does not work when the bases are unequal, as you could verify yourself for 32.54. 
X 
Finally, what about inversion, or dividing by x"? As a preview, a negative power is equivalent to putting the item in the denominator, so that x-1=. To see this, consider Eq. A.8 in the case where p and q are opposite sign but the same magnitude. For instance, following the "add the exponents rule" we get that 34.3-4-34-4 = 30 = 1, because anything raised to the zero power is 1.22 The only thing we can multiply into 3.3.3.3 in order to get 1 is 
This means that 3-4 is the same as 1/34, or more generally: 
1 3-3-3-3 
1 
= 
xn 
(A.9) 
Negative exponents therefore flip the construction to the denominator, or denote a division rather than multiplication. 
A.6 Fractional Powers 
In the previous section, we only dealt with integer powers, so that we could write out 34 as 3.3.3.3. How would we possibly write 31.7? Yet it is mathematically well defined. A calculator has no trouble. 
We can get a hint from Eq. A.8. Consider, for example, 52. 52. We know that we can just add the exponents, which in this case add to a tidy 1, meaning that the answer is just 5. Therefore we interpret 5 as the square root of 5, since multiplying it by itself yields 5. So we can re-express our familiar friend as a fractional power: 
21: Note that some care must be exercised in selecting the example. For instance, pick- ing both exponents as 2 would leave some ambiguity: is the result of 4 2 + 2, 2 x 2, or 22? 
22: Think of the exponent as how many in- stances of a number are multiplied together in a chain, implicitly all multiplied by 1. If we have zero instances of the number, then the implicit 1 is all we have left in the mul- tiplication. In other words, 1 is the starting point for all multiplications, just like zero is the starting point for all additions. 
x2 = √x. 
(A.10) 
In principle, then, we could approach 31.7 by taking the tenth-root of 3 and raising it to 17th power: 31.7 = (3)17 = 30. 
 
More generally, in Chapter 1, we saw that we can represent any base, b, raised to some arbitrary number, n, as: 
bn = en lnb = 10n log10 b 
(A.11) 
where we use the exponential function and its inverse function (natural log, ln), or alternatively the base-10 equivalents. If, for some reason, we lacked a y* calculator button, these approaches allow more fundamental ways to get at the same thing. 
A.7 Scientific Notation 
The single-biggest mistake students make when it comes to scientific notation is easily remedied by understanding it not as a set of rules, but for what it's actually doing. 
Most of the time, students get it right: they see 1.6 x 102 and move the decimal to the right two times to get 160. A little harder is negative exponents, like 2.4 x 10-2. Moving the decimal point twice to the left results in the correct 0.024 answer. 
The hangup can come about if the process is misconstrued as simply "counting zeros." Ironically, a student might correctly convert 6 × 103 by adding three zeros to the 6 to get 6,000, but then mistake 103 for 10,000-thinking: start with 10 and add three zeros. 
# 
The sure-fire way is to connect to the concept of integer powers, so that 103 is simply 10 10 10, which is unmistakably 1,000. Likewise, 10-4 is four repeated (multiplied) instances of 10-1, each one representing 10/ or 0.1. String four together, and we have 10,000, or 0.0001. So fall back on 
the basics. 
Example A.7.1 We can also apply the rule of multiplying exponenti- ated quantities covered in Eq. A.8. So 3.2 × 103 times 2 × 102 can be written out as 3.2 2 103 102 (order does not matter), which we can recognize as 6.4 x 105. 
What about division: 2.4 x 1013 divided by 8 x 107? Several ways to approach this might be instructive. Let's ignore the pre-factors (2.4 and 8) for now and focus on the powers of ten. The standard practice is to subtract the exponent in the denominator from that in the numerator: 13 - 7 = 6 in this case, so that we are left with 24 × 106. We could also represent the 107 in the denominator as 10-7 in the numerator, as per Eq. A.9. Now we just add the exponents to get the same result. Or we could invert the 8 x 107 to become 0.125 x 10-7 and multiply this by 2.4 x 1013 
But I want to present the way I would do it to make it easy enough 
 
A.7 Scientific Notation 
367 
to perform in my head. Recognizing that 24 is divisible by 8, I am strongly tempted to re-express the first number as 24 × 1012. See what I did there? I multiplied the prefactor by 10, and decreased the exponent by one accordingly to end up at the same place. Now I have 24 x 1012-7, which reduces to 3 x 105. All methods get the same answer,23 which turns into another lesson that math provides many paths to the same answer, which can be used to check and reinforce. 
A.8 Equation Hunting 
Students often form a counter-productive dependency on formulas. Experts focus on learning the concept expressed by an equation, since an equation is very much like a sentence that speaks some truth.24 Once the fundamental principle is mastered, the equation or formula is automatic, and can be generated from a place of understanding—which is more permanent than memorization. 
The practice is more common and natural than it might seem at first. Let's say a person has a take-home pay of $50,000 per year. Rent is $2,000 per month, groceries and other bills come to $1,000 per month. How much is left per month for discretionary spending? Where is the formula for that problem? Of course, you wouldn't bother hunting for a formula in this case and would instead build your own math. You essentially create your own formula on the fly. Whether you first divide the annual figure by 12 and then subtract the monthly expenses, or multiply monthly expenses by 12 before subtracting from the annual amount and then dividing by 12, the result is the same: a little more than $1,000 per month. 
It is also clear in this context that it makes little sense to perform math down to the penny, since the grocery and other expenses are not going to be exactly the same each month. The lesson is that most people are expert enough in managing money that they don't scramble to find printed formulas whenever they want to figure something out, and they are also forgiving on precision because they know from context not to take it all too literally. 
This book tries to foster a more expert-like approach to the material. For instance, Def. 5.3.1 (p. 71) introduces the concept of power without explicitly saying P = AE/At. It just says that power is how much energy is expended in how much time. If a student internalizes that idea, then why print a formula? By doing so, a student may bypass real understanding25 and rely on the formula as a crutch, never planting the core idea firmly in the brain. Shortcuts can end up disadvantaging students, as attractive as they may look in the moment. The student who masters the concepts will be in a far better position to deploy them in a wider variety of circumstances including unfamiliar test questions.

Physics instructors often joke that they teach students the "three Ohm's Laws." The joke is that only one is needed: V = I. R. The other forms: 
I 
= 
V 
R 
V I 
X and R = can be derived from the first. Rigid memorization leads some students to remember all three forms, rather than simply move things around in a way that maintains the relationship. 
The rules are easy enough to generate on your own. Think of an equation as a perfectly balanced see-saw-maybe an elephant sitting on both sides. The equation is only valid if it remains balanced. You may add a chicken, but do it to both sides. You may multiply or divide the number of elephants, as long as it is done the same way to both sides. Dividing both sides of (the first) Ohm's Law above by R leads to the second form, for instance. 
Example A.9.1 Let's say you are given something you consider to be an ugly equation, or you simply want to solve for one variable. Using symbols for everything,26 we might have 
a 
b 
x + y 
+c= 
Z 
Let's say we hate the appearance of fractions. Multiply both sides by 
b: 
26: It is easy to substitute numbers any- where you wish at any time 
x + y 
a+b. c = b 
Z 
Now multiply both sides by z to eliminate the remaining fraction: 
a.z+b.c⋅z = b. (x + y) 
What if you wanted a solution for y? Guess we're going to have to return b to denominator status, as we need to divide both sides by b. 
x + y 
= 
a 
b 
· 
Z+c z 
And finally we subtract x from both sides to get 
y 
- 
a 
b 
· 
- 
Whatever you want to do, just do it to both sides. 
It's not always so straightforward. Sometimes we have to "undo" or "invert" a mathematical function. Consider for instance a familiar prob- lem: find the side length, a, of a right triangle whose other side is b and hypotenuse c. We know from the Pythagorean Theorem that a2+b2 = c2, so that a2 = c2b2. But we want a, not a2. How do we "undo" the square? Take a page from Eq. A.7. We want a to the power of 1, so we want to raise a2 to whatever power will neutralize the 2 via multiplication. 
 
Looks like (square root) will do the trick. But we need to treat both sides: 
a = 
= (a2)2 = √a2 = √c2 = b2 
n 
(A.12) 
In this case, the power can be said to perform the inverse function of the power n. In more familiar contexts: subtraction is the inverse of addition; division is the inverse of multiplication. Less familiarly, but in similar veins: the sine is "undone" by arcsine;27 the exponential ex is undone by the natural log (ln x); 10 is undone by log10 x, etc. 
If you have not done it before (or recently), mess around on a calculator, starting with a custom number you make up that is pleasing to you and recognizable.28 Square it and then take the square root. Calculate the sine and then inverse sine (ASIN). Take the exponential and then natural log or other way around. Get to know these things on your own terms!

A.10 Units Manipulation 
In the real world, numbers often are packaged with associated units. The radius of the earth is 6,378 km. If we change the unit, we change the number, too. Earth's radius becomes 6,378,000 m or 3,963 miles. Most generally, we aim to quantify something in nature, and the numeric value is utterly dependent on the units we choose to represent the physical reality. 
Because the numbers are often meaningless without the accompanying units, we should29 carry around the units in all manipulations. Any time we do something to the number, we need to do the same thing to the unit. 
Example A.10.1 If we travel 4 meters in 2 seconds, we have

Dividing the numbers alone to get 2 is not the whole story. We also divided the units to create a new one that was not in the initial set (m and s). 
If we fill a room whose floor area is 10 square meters with water one meter deep, the volume is 
10m2 1 m = 10.1 m2 m = 10 m3. 
. 
So we multiply the meters together just like we do the numbers, following the same rules but acting as if they are variables and keeping it symbolic. 
More complicated arrangements follow the same rules. For example, the force of drag30 on an object moving at speed v through a medium of density p is Fdrag = CDApv2, where A is the frontal (cross-sectional) area of the object and cp is the dimensionless drag coefficient.31 The dimensions of area are m2; density is kg/m3 (mass per volume), and velocity is m/s (distance over time). The whole arrangement therefore has dimensions:

The end result matches the definition of Newtons, and can be verified by the (possibly familiar) F = ma form of Newton's Second Law,32 whereby we have mass in kg times acceleration in m/s2 making kg. m/s2. 
When performing a chain of multiplications or divisions, we can carry the units around and multiply, divide, or (hopefully) cancel them as we 
go. 
Example A.10.2 Let's say we want to know how much energy, in Joules, the U.S. uses in a year based on knowledge that the average citizen accounts for 10,000 W (a Watt is a Joule per second) and the U.S. has 330 million people. First, let's work with the 10,000 W per person metric: 
32: Force equals mass times acceleration 
104 J/s 
person 
104 J 
person. s 
where we have just moved the seconds into the denominator to multiply "person" (order doesn't matter). Most of the problem is in going from seconds to years. It would like like this: 
104 J 
person. s 
60 s 
60 min 24 hour 
1 min 1 hour 1 day 
365 day 1 year 
Notice that each of the factors we multiply, even though they carry a non-unity numeric value, are essentially identities that describe equal intervals on top and bottom, in differing units.33 So we are effectively multiplying by 1 repeatedly in a unit conversion process. 
Also note that the chain we construct allows a boatload of cancella- tions, as almost all units present appear in both the numerator and denominator once. The only ones that do not are J in the numerator and year and person in the denominator. When we carry out the multiplication above and cancel units, we find that we are left with: 
3.15 x 1011 
J 
year person 
Oops, the units are helping us here by reminding us that we need to multiply by the population (3.3 x 108 persons) to get the answer 
33: E.g., 24 hours and 1 day describe the same time interval. 
 
we sought.34 In this case, we end up with 1.04 × 1020 J/year, which is 
what we were after. 
We just carried out unit conversions (in time) in Example A.10.2, when we multiplied by constructs like 60 s/1 min. The key to unit conversions is to arrange a fraction expressing the same physical thing in both the nu- merator and denominator, just using different units. So we're looking for equivalent measures. Most of the time, one of them will be 1, numerically, as in the following example. 
Example A.10.3 We might want to convert the 1.04 × 1020 J/year from Example A.10.2 into quadrillion Btu per year. We know that 1 Btu is 1,055 J, and that a quadrillion is 1015. So we arrange the following: 
J 1 Btu 1 quadrillion 1.04 × 1020 
year 1,055J 
1015 
≈ 100 quadrillion Btu/year. 
Finally, units can help guide correct usage of factors in a problem. In Example A.10.3, what if we did not know whether to divide or multiply by 1,055? The fact that we wanted to eliminate Joules told us we needed the Joules in the denominator, and so the relation 1 Btu = 1,055 J told us the 1,055 travels with Joules and must be in the denominator. 
But what if we are faced with a problem whose application is not as apparent?35 Let's explore how this might go in a less familiar setting. 
Example A.10.4 For some inexplicable reason, you put a brick in the refrigerator, which is 20°C colder than the brick is, initially, and want to find out how long it will take for the brick to cool off. The brick has a mass of 2.5 kg, will dump its heat into the refrigerator at a rate of 10 W (10 J/s), and has a specific heat capacity of 1,000 J/kg/°C.36 So you feel overwhelmed by lack of familiarity, right? Good, because the units are here to help. 
You want an answer in time units, and see one instance in the 10 J/s rate at which heat leaves the brick. To get seconds "up top," you want to make sure the 10 W value is in the denominator. This puts Joules in the denominator, and we don't want it to survive to the final answer. We notice Joules in the specific heat capacity thing in the numerator, so that thing must go in the numerator. Let's take stock of where that leaves us. 
A.10 Units Manipulation 
372 
34: So units, handled carefully, can provide important clues as to how to get the problem right. 
35: ...or we don't know the formula, which is no bad thing, as we then have the chance to construct it from what we know, like a real expert! 
36: This construction means that kg and °C are both in the denominator together.

It looks like if we multiply by the mass in kg and multiply by the temperature difference, we're home free. Doing so results in 5,000 seconds. Whenever possible, try to extract the most context/intuition out of an answer as you can. Does 5,000 seconds mean a lot to you? Divide by 60 (or multiply by 1min) to get 83 minutes. Better. Or another factor of 60 and we're at 1.4 hours. That seems like the most natural

way 
to express 
the answer. 
It is also useful to pause and reflect on our operations and whether they made sense. For instance, since we multiplied by mass to get the cooling time, it implies that a larger brick would take longer, which is sensible. If heat left at a rate faster than 10 W, it would cool down faster, again making sense. 
We will do one more example in an unfamiliar context, this time involving some ambiguity that your wits can help resolve. 
Example A.10.5 An outer wall on a sealed brick building measures 5 m long and 2.5 m high, having a thickness of 0.1 m. You are asked how fast heat (thermal energy) is being lost through the wall.37 It is 20°C warmer inside the wall than it is outside, and you are told that brick has a thermal conductivity of 0.6 W/m/°C.38 Thermal what? But don't panic. 
We want an answer in J/s, or W. We see Watts in the numerator of the thermal conductivity, so we want that in the numerator of our answer. We would need to multiply by meters and by °C to cross the finish line. Seems simple enough. But meters shows up three times in the dimensions of the wall. Which should we choose? Or is it a 
combination? 
Engage the intuition. Put yourself in the building next to the wall, mentally. It's warm inside, cold outside. Will I need more heaters (power) or fewer if the wall is taller? If the wall is wider? If the wall is thicker? What does your intuition say? 
You might reason that a thicker wall will require less power to keep warm, but that a larger area (increasing width or height or both) would make the job of maintaining temperature more challenging. This suggests that the power will increase if width or height increase, and decrease if thickness increases. So we should multiply by width and height (or equivalently, by area) and divide by thickness. Area over thickness indeed has units of meters, which we already concluded we needed as a multiplier to get our desired outcome. Putting things together, we have 
At this point, we could create our own for- mula based on requiring the units to work! See: formulas are not sacred tablets to be memorized-they are just statements that make logical sense and can be created by you to accomplish a task. 
37: The units would be energy per time, or J/s, which is a power (W).

useful foundation. The key lesson is that the knowledge and intuition students already hold in their heads can be leveraged effectively to recreate forgotten rules of math. Just remember: it all makes sense and hangs together. Creating customized simple problems39 allows a way to make sure the math rules being applied replicate the right answer. If not, a few tests can often get things back on the right track. By doing so, students can claim greater personal ownership of the math, and have a better internal mastery of its workings.

Chemistry deals with atoms and molecules and the interactions between them. Atoms and molecules1 are irreducible nuggets of a substance the minimum unit that carries the essential properties of that substance. Water, for instance, is comprised of two hydrogen atoms bonded to a single oxygen atom, which we denote as H2O.

Figure B.1 presents a stripped-down version of the periodic table. Addi- tional exploration of more fully-featured versions is encouraged.2 
It is natural to imagine that a first step in dealing with piles of atoms and/or molecules is being able to count them. But since individual atoms are fantastically small, the numbers can be overwhelmingly large. This is where the mole3 comes in. A mole is just a number, and that number is called Avogadro's number, having a value of NA = 6.022 × 1023, or 602,214,076,000,000,000,000,000, if written out.4 
The way the mole is defined, essentially, is that 12.000000 grams of neutral carbon atoms (of the isotope having 6 protons and 6 neutrons in its nucleus) will constitute one mole of atoms. In this way, the masses of

2: Perhaps at least identifying the high- lighted elements would be worthwhile. 
3: 
the word molecule begins with mole. 
4: Unfortunately, it can be hard to remem- ber if it is supposed to be 6.022 x 1023 or 6.023 x 1022. For this reason, may be wise to forget about the 22 and just remember 6.0×1023, or even 6.023 × 1023 as something that is very slightly wrong but much better than being 10 times off! 
B.2 Stoichiometry

other elements-being comprised of an integer number of protons and neutrons5-will tend to be close to an integer number of grams. For instance, a mole of hydrogen atoms is very close to 1.00 grams. A mole of helium is very nearly 4.00 grams, nitrogen 14, oxygen 16, etc. 
So the concept of the mole is pretty straightforward: just a number— albeit a very large one. 
Box B.1: Moles to Mass 
Incidentally, the inverse of Avogadro's number becomes the definition of the atomic mass unit (a.m.u.). The a.m.u. can be thought of as the average mass of an atom per nucleon. In other words, carbon-12 (6 protons, 6 neutrons) has a mass of 12 a.m.u. In fact, this is how the a.m.u. is defined. This means that hydrogen (a single proton) has a mass very close to 1.00 a.m.u., and oxygen-16 (8 protons, 8 neutrons) has a mass close to 16.00 a.m.u. Chapter 15 delves into the subtle reason why these are not exactly 1.00000 and 16.00000 in these cases. 
Since one mole of 12.00000 a.m.u. carbon-12 atoms is defined to have a mass of 12.00000 g, one mole of 1.000000 a.m.u. particles would have a mass of 1.000000 g. Therefore, a single 1.000000 a.m.u. particle would have a mass of 1.000000 g divided by Avogadro's number, NA = 6.02214076 x 1023, which turns out to be 1.66053907 × 10-24 
g, or 1.66053907 × 10-27 kg. This is the number you will find if looking up the atomic mass unit (also called a Dalton).

B.2 Stoichiometry 
Chemistry starts by counting atoms and molecules. Since molecules are comprised of integer numbers of atoms of specific types, the counting fun does not stop there. When atoms and molecules react chemically, the atoms themselves are never created or destroyed-only rearranged. This means that an accurate count of how many of each atom type are present at the start, a proper count at the end should yield exactly the same results. 
Before we get into balancing chemical reactions, we need to know some- thing about the scheme for labeling chemical compounds. A compound is an arrangement of atoms (representing pure elements) into a molecule. For instance, water is made of three atoms drawn from two elements: hydrogen and oxygen. Two atoms of hydrogen are bonded to an atom of oxygen to make a molecule of water. We denote this as H2O. 
Examples of a few familiar atoms and molecules are presented in Figure B.2. Each one is named at the top. Below each one appears the bond structure in the case of molecules and the chemical "formula" in all cases. Notice that hydrogen atoms always have a single bond (single

Figure B.2: Representing atoms as colored spheres for schematic purposes, we can de- pict the general appearance of molecules as bonded collections of atoms. Here, we have three elements-hydrogen, oxygen, and carbon-combined into familiar molecules. Oxygen in the air we breathe is self-bonded into a "diatomic" molecule. Two represen- tations appear below each molecule: a dia- gram indicating bonds (including double- bonds in some cases), and the chemical formula.

electron to share), oxygen has two (wants to "borrow" two electrons to feel good about itself), and carbon tends to have four (either donating four in the case of CO2, or accepting four when bonding to hydrogen). The chemical formula for each uses elemental symbols to denote the participants and subscripts to count how many are present.? 
Now we come to a bedrock practice in chemistry called stoichiometry— which boils down to counting atoms in a reaction to make sure no atoms are missing or spontaneously appear. To get a sense of this, see Figure B.3 for two examples. The graphical version captures the physical reality, so that simply counting the number of spheres of each color on the left and right had better match. Below each graphical reaction is the associated chemical formula. Each formula contains an arrow indicating the direction of the reaction (separating "before" and "after"). Numerical factors (coefficients, or prefactors) in front of a molecule indicate how many molecules are present in the reaction. To get the total number of atoms represented, we must multiply the subscript for that atom (implicitly 1 if not present) by the prefactor.10 
Example B.2.1 Let's figure out a tougher formula, pertaining to the combustion of ethanol (depicted in Figure B.2). In this situation, we combine a C2H6O molecule with some number of oxygen molecules (O2), and the reaction products will be CO2 and H2O (carbon dioxide and water). Our job is to figure out how many molecules are needed to balance the reaction: 
C2H6O+?O2 →?CO2 + ?H2O 
9: Two variants are shown for ethanol. The first is a no-nonsense census of the atoms, while the second pulls one of the H symbols to the end to call attention to the OH (hy- droxyl) tagged onto the end of the molecule. In either case, the formula specifies 2 car- bons, 6 hydrogens, and 1 oxygen, in total. 
10: For example, 2H2O has a total of 4 hy- drogen atoms and 2 oxygens.

Figure B.3: Two example fossil fuel reac- tions (combustion) are shown here. The first is coal and the second is natural gas (methane). Both cases simply rearrange the input atoms without creating or destroying any, so that the count is the same on both sides of the arrow (which denotes the direc- tion of the reaction). In other words, four purple hydrogens on the left in the case of methane must all appear on the right some- where. The formula version also just counts instances of each atom/molecule, in which pre-factors (coefficients) indicate how many molecules are present. 
CH12+

+202 → CO2+ 2H2O 
where question marks indicate what we need to figure out. Three unknowns and one equation? It may seem hopeless, but the formula is not the equation. The equations are that the total number of carbons on each side are equal, the total number of oxygens are equal, and the total number of hydrogens are equal. So we actually have three equations.11 
Start by noticing that the left side has 2 carbons and 6 hydrogens. We don't know how many oxygens yet, but it's good enough to start. On the right, carbon only shows up in CO2, so getting 2 carbons on the right requires 2CO2. Likewise, hydrogen only shows up in water, and ethanol has 6 hydrogen atoms to stuff into water molecules that hold 2 hydrogens apiece. It will obviously take 3 water molecules to account for 6 hydrogens.12 So now the right side is hammered out: 
C2H6O+?O2 → 2CO2 + 3H2O 
The only thing left to figure out is how many oxygens are on the left. To balance the reaction, count the number of oxygen atoms on the right. Four come from the two CO2 molecules, and 3 from the water for a total of 7. One oxygen was already present in the ethanol molecule on the left, so only need 6 in the form of O2, thus requiring three of these: 
11: Equations are just statements of truth that we can create on our own. They are just a way to express what we know about a problem. 
12: What if the starting point had an odd number of hydrogens on the left? We'd need to double the number of hydrogen- containing molecules on the left to produce an even number and start over. 
C2H6O302 → 2CO2 + 3H2O 
The job is done: the reaction is now balanced. That's stoichiometry. 
The treatment above cast chemical reactions at the most fundamental level of individual molecules reacting. In practice, reactions involve great numbers of interacting particles, so it is often more convenient to think in moles. In fact, common practice is to look at the prefactors13 in chemical reaction formulas as specifying the number of moles rather than the number of individual molecules. Either way, the formula looks exactly the same,14 and it's just a matter of interpretation. 
Thinking of the chemical formulas in terms of moles makes assessment of the masses involved more intuitive. Recall that one mole of carbon 
13: ... also called coefficients 
14: To be explicit, if a formula is balanced for individual molecules, then it should also be balanced if doubling the "recipe," or tripling, multiplying by 10, or even by 6 × 1023. 
 
atoms is exactly 12 grams, that hydrogen is 1 g, and oxygen is 16 g. That means one mole of water molecules (H2O) will be 18 g (16 + 1 + 1), one mole of carbon dioxide (CO2) is 44 g (12 + 16 + 16), and one mole of ethanol (C2H6O) is 46 g (12 + 12 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1+1+1+16). We refer to this figure as the molar mass, and standard periodic tables display the molar masses for each element: the mass of one mole of the substance. The unit is typically grams per mole, or g/mol. 
Example B.2.2 How much mass of CO2 will emerge from the burning of 1 kg of ethanol? We start with the formula we worked out in Example B.2.1: 
C2H6O302 → 2CO2 + 3H2O 
This problem can be approached in Two equivalent ways: either figure out how many moles of ethanol it takes to amount to 1 kg and then scale the formula accordingly; or just work it out for one mole to get a ratio and then apply to 1 kg. We'll do it both ways. 
Since ethanol has a molar mass of 46 g, one kilogram corresponds to 21.7 moles. So we could re-write the formula as: 
21.7C2H6O+ 65.202 
43.5CO2 + 65.2H2O 
where we have multiplied each prefactor (coefficient) by 21.7. CO2 has a molar mass of 44 g/mol, so 43.5 moles will come to 1.91 kg. 
The other approach is to note that 2 moles of CO2 are produced for every one mole of ethanol combusted. So 88 g of CO2 (44 g/mol) results for every 46 g of ethanol supplied. This ratio is 1.91. So 1 kg of ethanol input will make 1.91 kg of CO2 out, as before. 
B.3 Chemical Energy 
379 
B.3 Chemical Energy 
Atoms (elements) can bond together to make molecules (compounds). The bond-formed by outer electrons within the atoms can be strong or weak. It takes energy15 to pull apart bonded atoms. It stands to reason that when two atoms form a new bond, energy is released-usually as vibrations that we know as heat. In a typical reaction, some bonds are broken and other new ones formed. If the balance is that the new bonds are stronger than the broken bonds, energy will be released. Otherwise, energy will have to be put into the reaction to allow it to happen. 
In the context of this book, chemical energy is typically associated with combustion (burning) a substance in the presence of oxygen. This is true for burning coal, oil, gas, biofuels, and firewood. In a chemistry class, one learns to look up the energetic properties of various compounds in tables, combining them according to the stoichiometric reaction formula 
15: Recall that energy is a measure of work, or a force times a distance. 
 
to ascertain a net energy value. We're going to take a shortcut to all that, by introducing the following approximate formula for combustion 
energy. 
The approximate energy available from the compound CcHhOoNn where the subscripts represent the number of each atom in the molecule to be burned-is: 
16 
100 
c+0.3h 0.50 
12c+h+160 + 14n 
kcal/g. 
(B.1) 
For instance, sucrose has the formula C12H22O11, so that c = 12, h = 22, 0 = 11, and n = 0. The denominator in the formula is just the molar mass, or 342 in this case. The numerator adds to 13.1, so that the result is 3.8 kcal/g-very close to the expected value around 4 kcal/g for a carbohydrate like sugar. 
The numerator of Eq. B.1 tells us that we get the most energy from each carbon atom, 30% as much from each hydrogen atom, and take a 50% hit (deduction) for each oxygen atom. Nitrogen is energetically inert and does not contribute to the numerator-while degrading the energy density by adding mass in the denominator. The negative coefficient for oxygen tells us something important. Since combustion is a process of joining oxygen to atoms in the fuel, the presence of oxygen already in the fuel means it is already partly "reacted" and has less to offer in the way of new oxygen bonds. 
We can explore the sensibility of Eq. B.1 by testing it on some known boundary cases.17 Since one ubiquitous end-product of combustion is CO2, calculating for CO2 should offer no energy to us, since it's a "waste" product at the end of the energy process. H2O, as another common combustion product, is likewise effectively neutralized in the formula (the result is at least made to be very small). Table B.1 provides some examples of what Eq. B.1 delivers for familiar carbon-based substances. Note that oxygen content (last column) drives energy down, while hydrogen offers a boost.

This empirical formula can serve as a gen- eral guide, but should not be taken as a literal truth from some profound deriva- tion. It captures the main energy features and produces a useful, approximate result. 
16: The coefficients in the denominator re- flect the fact that carbon is 12 units of mass, oxygen is 16, etc. 
17: This is a generically useful practice: it helps integrate new knowledge into your brain by validating the behavior in known contexts. Does it make sense? Can you ac- cept it, or does it seem wrong/suspect? Experts often apply new tools first to famil- iar situations whose answers are known to build trust and competence using the new tool before applying it more broadly.

The resulting calculated energies are definitely in the right (expected) ranges. Notice that the "winners" have little or no oxygen as a percentage of the total molecular mass. The lower-energy entries in Table B.1 are more than half oxygen, by mass.

381 
B.4 Ideal Gas Law 
Another topic covered in chemistry classes that strongly overlaps physics is the ideal gas law. This relationship describes the interactions between pressure, volume and temperature of a gas. In chemistry class, it is learned as 
PV = nRT, 
(B.2) 
where P stands for pressure (in Pascals18), V is volume (cubic meters), n is the number of moles, T is temperature (in Kelvin), and R is called the gas constant, having the value 
R = 8.314 
J 
mol. K 
(B.3) 
To get degrees in Kelvin, add 273.15 (273 among friends) to the tempera- ture in Celsius.19 Standard atmospheric pressure is about 105 Pa.20 
Example B.4.1 Let's say we have a gas at "standard temperature and pressure" (STP), meaning 0°C (273 K) and 1.013 x 105 Pa. How much volume would one mole of gas21 occupy? 
We have everything we need to solve for volume, so 
18: A Pascal (Pa) is also a Newton of force per square meter, which reduces to more fundamental units of J/m3 (Joules of energy per cubic meter). 
19: And T(°F) 1.8 T(°C) + 32. 
= 
20: 1 atmosphere is 101,325 Pa. 
21: It may be surprising, but the ideal gas law does not care what element or molecule we are considering! 
nRT (1 mol)(8.314 J/K/mol)(273 K) 
V = 
≈ 0.0224 m 
3 
= 22.4 L. 
P 
1.013 x 105 Pa 
Okay; lots going on here. After the three values in the numerator are multiplied, the only surviving unit is J (Joules of energy). The unit in the denominator is Pascals, but this is equivalent to Joules per cubic meter. So the answer emerges in cubic meters, as a volume should. Since a cubic meter is 1,000 liters, we find that a mole of gas at STP occupies 22.4 L-a number memorized by many a chemistry student! 
Physicists prefer a variant of the ideal gas law that derives from the study of “statistical mechanics,” which is practically synonymous with thermodynamics and relates to the study of interactions between large ensembles of particles. The form looks pretty familiar, still: 
PV = NKBT. 
(B.4) 
Pressure, volume, and temperature are all unchanged, and expressed in the same units as before. Now, N describes the number of particles (quite large, usually), and kB is called the Boltzmann constant, having a value 
J K 
KB = 1.3806 × 10-23 
(B.5) 
Notice that N, the number of particles, and n, the number of moles, differs simply by a factor of Avogadro's number, NA = 6.022 x 1023. Indeed, if we multiply NA by kв, we get 8.314, and are back to R.22 
22: The units work, too, since NA effectively has units of a number (of particles) per mole. 
 
B.4 Ideal Gas Law 
382 
Example B.4.2 Gas is stored at high pressure at room temperature in a metal cylinder, at a pressure of about 200 atmospheres.23 The cylinder is designed to meet a safety factor of 2, meaning that it likely will not fail until pressure reaches 400 atmospheres. If a fire breaks out and the cylinder heats up, the pressure will rise. How hot must the gas get before the cylinder may no longer be able to hold the pressure (assuming no fire damage to the cylinder itself)? 
We could start throwing numbers into the ideal gas law, but we don't know the volume or number of moles (or particles). Heck, we're not even given a temperature. Ack! Students hate this sort of problem, because it does not appear to be algorithmic in nature. No plug and chug (an activity that does not engage the brain heavily, and thus its appeal). 
But we're okay. What is room temperature? Something like 20-25°C, so that's 293-298 K. Whatever the volume is, or the amount of gas in the cylinder, those things don't change as the temperature rises.24 What we're left with is a straightforward scaling between temperature and pressure (because the numerical factors are all constant for our problem). Therefore, if temperature doubles, pressure doubles.25 
Hey, it's doubling pressure that we are interested in, which will happen if the temperature doubles. So if the temperature goes up to about 600 K, we may be in trouble. It is easy to imagine that a fire could create such conditions. Notice that we are not bothering to say 586-596 K, but just said about 600 K. Do you want a precise temperature when the thing will rupture? Good luck. The point at which it explodes may be 405 atmospheres or it may hold on until 453. Also, how likely is it that all the gas throughout the cylinder is at exactly the same temperature when being heated by a nearby fire? So let's give ourselves a break and not pretend we're totally dialed in. There's a fire, after all. 
23: 
sure 
means 200 times atmospheric pres- 
This is an example where internalizing the ideal law for what it means, or what it 
gas says is more important than treating it like a recipe for cranking out problems. Don't just treat equations as mechanical objects: learn what it is they have to say! 
24: The gas is not leaking out, and the cylinder does not change size-at least not significantly—as it warms. 
25: That's one of the things Eq. B.4 is trying to say, beneath all the bluster.

Numerical answers are given as ranges or other hints, meant to facilitate checking for gross departures from the right track, without revealing the precise answer so that shortcuts are discouraged. Questions for which the answer is already known (questions asking to verify an answer), easily validated in the text, or that are a matter of original thought or opinion may not be included here. 
The ranges sometimes may be annoyingly large, but think of them as guard rails to prevent a tragic miscalculation or to catch a fundamental misunderstanding of the underlying concepts. It can help catch errors like dividing the wrong things or swapping numerator and denominator, or multiplying when division is called for. In many cases, intuition, or guessing, might lead you already to similar answers or ranges. With practice, students may be able to anticipate what they think are reasonable ranges for answers. In fact, it is a great practice to think about expectations before working on the problem. 
This appendix, then, might be thought of as an "intuition implant" that simulates how problems are for experts. Real life does not provide "answers at the back of the book," so experts rely on experience, intuition, and a sense for "reasonable" results to help them understand when they've taken a wrong turn. A successful use of this appendix would help train students to develop their own "common sense" guard rails.

This Appendix contains tangential information that may be of interest to students, but too far removed from the main thread of material to warrant placement within chapters. Many of these items were prompted by student feedback on the first draft of the textbook, wanting to know more about some tantalizing piece mentioned in the text. Pick and choose according to your interests. 
D.1 Edge of the Universe 
Sec. 4.1 (p. 54) built a step-wise scale out to the edge of the visible universe, which a margin note clarifies as the visible horizon of our universe. This fascinating and deep concept deserves elaboration. 
Two foundations of experimental physics and cosmology are that the speed of light is finite, and the universe began in a Big Bang 13.8 billion years ago. Ample evidence supports of both claims. It should be noted that these notions were not at all accepted by scientists until the preponderance of evidence left little choice but to adopt them as how the world really appears to work. 
The finite speed of light means that looking into the distance amounts to looking back in time. Here, Imperial units have a brief moment of glory, in that every foot of distance (0.3 m) is one nanosecond of time. We see the moon as it was 1.25 seconds "in the past," the sun as it was 500 seconds (8.3 minutes) ago, and the nearest star 4.2 years back. The "nearby" Andromeda Galaxy is 2.5 million years in the past, and as we peer 
farther into the universe we look ever farther back in time. Indeed, at great distances we see infant galaxies in the process of forming as gravitational vacuum cleaners collecting materials from the diffuse gas that came before. 
So what happens when we look 13.8 billion years into the past, when the Big Bang is alleged to have happened? Shouldn't we see the explosion? And shouldn't it-perhaps confusingly-be visible in all directions? 
The answer is a resounding, though qualified, YES. Yes, we see evidence of the Big Bang in all directions, as a glow that appears in the microwave region of the electromagnetic spectrum. The Cosmic Microwave Back- ground, or CMB, as it is called, represents the glowing plasma when the universe was just 380,000 years old and about 1,100 times smaller than it is today. We cannot see earlier than this because the hot ionized plasma

that existed before this time is opaque1 to light travel. The universe only became "clear" after this time, when the plasma cooled into neutral (mostly) hydrogen atoms. So we can see almost back to the Big Bang, at least 99.997% of the way before the scene becomes opaque. 
So that's the limit to our vision, based on the idea that light has not had time to travel farther since the universe began. This is what we mean by the edge of the visible universe. 
But is it a real edge? All indications are that it is certainly not. When we look 13.8 billion light years away, we just see this glowing plasma (the CMB). But in the intervening years, galaxies and stars and planets have formed in that region of space, and would appear "normal," or mature today. So imagine a being on such a planet looking at us today, 13.8 billion light years distant. But they see us 13.8 billion years ago, when our neighborhood was still a glowing plasma well before the formation of galaxies, stars, and planets. 
Let's say the distant being is directly behind you and you are both looking off in the same direction-the alien essentially looking over your shoulder as you look directly opposite the direction to the alien. You (or the primordial gas that will someday become you) are at the limit of their vision, and they can't see anything beyond you. You sit at their edge. But to you it's no edge. You have no trouble seeing more "normal" universe stretching another 13.8 billion light years beyond what our distant friend can see. It's only a perceived edge, based on the limit of light travel time. 
A nice way to think of it is familiar scenes of limited vision, like in a fog or in the ocean, or even on the curved surface of Earth. All cases have a horizon: a limit to the distance visible. Yet moving to the edge of vision reveals a whole new region that was before invisible. Keep going and your starting region will no longer be visible, or within your horizon. But it has not ceased to exist. 
Similarly, the universe would seem to be much larger than our visible horizon. Measurements of the "flatness" of the geometry of space suggest a universe that is at least 100 times larger than our horizon, and may in fact be unfathomably larger. We may never know for sure, as limits to light travel seal us off from direct observation of most of the universe. 
D.2 Cosmic Energy Conservation 
Sec. 5.2 (p. 69) discussed the foundational principle of the conservation of energy, claiming that the principle is never violated except on cosmic scales. Besides elaborating on that point, this section follows the story of energy across vast spans of time as our sun forms and ultimately delivers energy to propel a car. We also clarify what it means for energy to be "lost" to heat.

D.2.1 Cosmological Exception 
Emmy Noether was a leading mathematician in the early twentieth century who also dabbled in physics. In a very profound insight, she recognized a deep connection between symmetries in nature and con- servation laws. A symmetry, in this context, is a property that looks the same from multiple vantage points. For instance, a sphere is symmetric in that it looks the same from any angle. A cylinder or vase also has symmetry about one axis, but more limited than the sphere. 
The symmetries Noether considered are more subtle symmetries in time, space, and direction. 
Definition D.2.1 Symmetry in time means that physics behaves the same at all times: that the laws and constants are the same, and an experiment cannot be devised that would be able to determine absolute time. 
Symmetry in space means that the laws of physics are the same no matter where one goes: fundamental experiments will not differ as a function of location. 
Symmetry in direction is closely related to the previous one. It says that the universe (physical law) is the same in every direction. 
The insight is that these symmetries imply conservation laws. Time symmetry dictates conservation of energy. Space symmetry leads to con- servation of momentum. Directional symmetry results in conservation of angular momentum. 
Great. As far as we know, the latter two are satisfied by our universe. To the best of our observational capabilities, the universe appears to be homogeneous (the same everywhere) and isotropic (the same in all directions). Yes, it's clumpy with galaxies, but by "same," we mean that physics appears to act the same way. Therefore, substantial observa- tional evidence supports our adopting conservation of momentum and conservation of angular momentum as a fact of our reality. 
But time symmetry is a problem, because the universe does not appear to be the same for all time. It appears to have emerged from a Big Bang (see Section D.1), and was therefore much different in the past than it is now, and continues to change/evolve. An experiment to measure the effective temperature of the Cosmic Microwave Background is enough to establish one's place on the timeline of the cosmic unfolding. 
As a consequence, conservation of energy is not strictly enforced over cosmological timescales. When a photon travels across the universe, it "redshifts," as if its wavelength were being stretched along with the expansion of the universe. Longer wavelengths correspond to lower energy. Where did the photon's energy go? Because time symmetry is broken in the universe, the energy of the photon is under no obligation to remain constant over such timescales. Deal with it, the universe says. 
 
D.2 Cosmic Energy Conservation 395 
On timescales relevant to human activities, conservation of energy is extremely reliable. One way to put this is that the universe is 13.8 billion years old, or just over 1010 years. So in the course of a year, physics would allow an energy change by one part in 1010, or in the tenth decimal place. Generally, this is beyond our ability to distinguish, in practical circumstances. 
But violations are even more restricted than that. A photon streaming across the universe is in the grip of cosmic expansion and bears witness to associated energy changes. But a deposit of oil lying underground for 100 million years is chemically bound and not "grabbable" by universal expansion, so is not "degraded" by cosmic expansion. In the end, while we acknowledge that energy conservation is not strictly obeyed in our universe, it might as well be for all practical purposes. Thus, this section amounts to a tiny asterisk or caveat on the statement that energy is always conserved. 
D.2.2 Convoluted Conservation 
This section follows a chain of energy conversions that starts before our own Sun was formed, and ends in a car wreck as a way to flesh out the manner in which energy is conserved, in practice. Don't worry about understanding every step, but absorb the overall theme that energy is changing from one form to the other throughout the process. 
A gas cloud in space collapses due to gravitational attraction, exchanging gravitational potential energy into kinetic energy as the gas particles race toward the center of the cloud. The cloud collapses into a tight ball and all that kinetic energy in the gas particles "thermalizes" through collisions,2 generating a hot ball of gas that is to become a star. As the ball of gas contracts more, additional gravitational potential energy is exchanged for thermal energy as the proto-star gets hotter. 
Eventually, particles in the core of the about-to-be star are moving so fast as they heat up 
that the electrical potential barrier3 is overcome so that protons can get close enough for the strong nuclear force to take over and permit nuclear fusion to occur, at which point we can call this thing a star. Four protons bond together, two of which convert to neutrons to form a helium nucleus. The total mass of the result is less than the summed mass of the inputs, the balance going into photons, or light 
energy. 
The photons eventually make it out of the opaque plasma of the star, and stream toward Earth, where a leaf absorbs the energy and cleverly converts it to chemical energy by rearranging atoms and electrons into sugars. The leaf falls off and eventually settles at the bottom of a shallow sea to be buried by sediments and ultimately becomes oil, preserving most of its chemical energy as it changes molecular form. 
2: Thermal energy is nothing more than kinetic energy-fast motion-of individual particles at the microscopic scale. Thermal- izing means transferring energy into heat, or into randomized kinetic energy of parti- cles in the medium.

4:... hydrogen nuclei 
5: 
via E = mc2; see Sec. 15.3 (p. 246) 
6: We call this photosynthesis. 
7: To the extent that energy is "lost" in any of these exchanges-operating at < 100% efficiency-we should recognize that the missing energy just flows into other paths, generally into heat. 
 
D.2 Cosmic Energy Conservation 396 
One day, a silly human digs up the oil and combusts it with oxygen, converting chemical energy to thermal energy in a contained fireball explosion. The thermal energy is used to produce kinetic energy of a piston in a cylinder, transmitted mechanically to wheels that in turn propel a car along a freeway. 
The car climbs a mountain, converting chemical energy in the fuel into gravitational potential energy via the same thermal-to-mechanical chain described above. Along the way, kinetic energy is given to the air, thermal energy is given to the environment by the hot engine, and brakes get hot as the kinetic energy of the car is converted to heat via friction as the car comes to a stop. But the car does not fully stop in time before tipping over a cliff and giving up its gravitational potential energy to kinetic energy as the car plummets and picks up speed. 
At the bottom, the crunch of the car ends up in bent metal, and heat. It does not explode, since this is not a movie. All the heat that was generated along the way ends up radiating to space as infrared radiation (photons), to stream across empty space-probably for all eternity. 
Tracing the energy we use for transportation back far enough, passes through oil, photosynthesis, sunlight, and nuclear fusion in the sun's core. Going back further, we recognize nuclear energy as deriving from gravitational energy of the collapsing material. What gave the atoms in the universe gravitational potential energy? The answer would have to be the Big Bang, truly arriving at the end (beginning) of the story. 
8: ... kinetic energy 
9: 
... a form of electric potential energy 
D.2.3 Lost to Heat 
The sequence in Section D.2.2 terminated in heat and infrared radiation. But let's flesh this out a bit, as heat is an almost-universal "endpoint" for energy flows. 
Since energy is conserved, whatever goes to heat does not truly disappear: the energy is still quantifiable, measurable energy. It is considered to be "low grade" energy because it is hard to make it do anything useful, unless the resulting temperature is significantly different from the surroundings. Sec. 6.4 (p. 88) discusses notable exceptions, wherein we derive substantial useful work from thermal energy in heat engines.10 For now, we just note that it is entropy that limits the use of thermal 
energy. 
When a book slides across a floor, it gives up its kinetic energy to heat caused by friction in the floor-book interface. When a car applies brakes and comes to a stop, a very similar process heats the brake pads and rotors. As a car speeds down the road, it stirs the air and also experiences friction in the axle/bearings and in the constant deformation of the tire as its round shape flattens on the road continuously. The stirred air swirls around in eddies that break up into progressively smaller ones 
10: In this way, we can make an explosion or fireball do useful work as in dynamite, internal combustion, or a coal-fired power 
plant.

until at the millimeter scale viscosity (friction) turns even this kinetic motion into randomized motion (heat). 
Human metabolism converts chemical energy from food into exportable mechanical work (lifting, moving, digging, etc.) at an efficiency of 20– 25%. The rest is heat, which is conveniently used to maintain body temperature in most environments. But even most of the external work performed ends up as heat. The primary exception may be lifting masses to a higher location. Even this is temporary in the very long run,11 and the stored energy will ultimately flow into heat. 
11 
Light from our artificial sources and screens survives for a few nanosec- onds as photon energy, but eventually is absorbed onto surfaces and turns to heat. Some small fraction of our light escapes to space and carries non-thermal energy away, but this is incidental and could be said to represent poor design (not putting light where it is useful). 
Even devices whose job it is to cool things are net generators of heat. The air pushed out the back and bottom of a refrigerator is warm, as is the exhaust from an air conditioning unit. Virtually all energy pulled out of an electrical wall socket ends up as heat in the room in some way or another. A fan actually deposits a little bit of energy (heat) into the room, but feels cool to us only because the moving air enhances evaporation of water from our skin (perspiration), carrying energy away. 
Essentially the only exceptions to the heat fate of our energy expenditures is anything that we launch into space, like electromagnetic radiation (radio, light). This is a very tiny fraction of our energy expenditure, and can be quantitatively ignored. Most of our energy is from burning fossil fuels, which is an inherently thermal process. The part we salvage as useful energy itself tends to end up as heat after serving its intended. 
purpose. 
12 
In the end, most of the heat we generate on Earth's surface finds its way back to space as infrared radiation. All objects glow in the infrared, and once the radiation escapes our atmosphere it is gone from Earth forever. At this point, the energy is pretty well spent, so that we would not be able to profit from its use should we try to capture it.13 The energy that came from the universe returns there, as part of the dull, fading glow that lingers from the Big Bang. 
D.3 Electrified Transport 
This section aims to answer the question: Why can't we just14 elec- trify transportation and be done with fossil fuels? It turns out to be hard. Rather then rely on external studies, this section applies lessons from the book to demonstrate the power of first-principles quantitative 
assessment. 
11: The "shelf" we place the mass on even- tually collapses or is otherwise disturbed. 
12: .except for some improbable paths that reflect off the moon, for instance, and return to Earth 
13: The temperature of the radiating entities is so close to ambient temperature that its efficiency to perform useful work would be nearly zero.

Box 13.3 (p. 212) indicated that direct drive of cars and airplanes from solar energy is impractical: while it may work in limited applications, solar power is too diffuse to power air and car travel as we know it. 
Thus electrified transport becomes all about storage, generally in bat- teries. Several times in the book, the energy density of gasoline was compared to that of battery storage. In rough numbers, gasoline delivers about 11 kcal/g, working out to ~13 kWh/kg in units that will be useful to this discussion. Meanwhile, lithium-ion batteries characteristic of those found in cars15 have energy densities about one-hundred times 
smaller. 
This section will use the most optimistic energy density for lithium-ion batteries around 0.2 kWh/kg-which is about 65 times less than for gasoline. Offsetting this somewhat is the fact that electric drive can be as high as 90% efficient at delivering stored energy into mechanical energy, while the thermal conversion of fossil energy in large vehicles is more typically 25%. The net effect is roughly a factor of twenty16 difference in delivered energy per kilogram of fuel vs. storage. 
The enormous mismatch in energy density between liquid fossil fuels and battery storage is the crux of the problem for transportation, the implications of which are explored here. We will start at the hard end, and work toward the easier. 
D.3 Electrified Transport 
398 
15: The larger Tesla battery pack, for in- stance, provides 265 miles (425 km) of range and holds 85 kWh at a mass of 540 kg for an energy density of 0.16 kWh/g. 
16: The math goes: 13 kWh/kg divided by 0.2 kWh/kg times 0.25/0.90, yielding a factor of 18. For the sake of estimation, 18 is close enough to a factor of 20 to use the more convenient and memorable 20x scaling factor in what follows. 
D.3.1 Airplanes 
Box 17.1 (p. 290) already did the work to evaluate the feasibility of powering typical passenger planes electrically. The result was a reduction in range by a factor of 20, consistent with the premise above: the best lithium-ion technology-not yet achieved in mass-market at 90% efficiency delivers about 5% as much mechanical energy per kilogram as do liquid fossil fuels. 
Keeping the same 15 ton17 "fuel" mass, but now at 0.2 kWh/kg results in a 3,000 kWh battery capacity. The factor-of-twenty energy reduction per mass results in ranges down from 4,000 km via jet fuel to 200 km on battery, which is a two-hour drive, effectively. Charging a 3,000 kWh battery in the 30 minutes it typically takes for a plane to turn around-in efficient operations, anyway-would consume 6,000 kW, or 6 MW of power, which is about the same as the average electricity consumption of 5,000 homes. 
We will keep track of kWh per kilometer as a useful metric for trans- portation efficiency, putting it all together at the end (Section D.3.7). In the case of air travel, it's 3,000 kWh to go 200 km, or 15 kWh/km. On a per-passenger basis, 150 passengers in the airplane results in 0.1 kWh/km/person. 
17: One metric ton is 1,000 kg, and is often spelled tonne. Here, ton is used to mean metric ton, which is only 10% larger than the Imperial "short ton."

D.3.2 Shipping 
Large container ships ply the seas carrying stacks of shipping containers over very long stretches of open ocean. A typical ship operating between Shanghai and Los Angeles travels 10,400 km carrying 10,000 20-foot equivalent18 containers each bearing an average of something like 10 tons of cargo. Thus, the full (maximum) load is 100,000 tons.19 
At normal cruising speed, the ship takes 10 days to make the journey, consuming about 325 tons of fuel per day. A battery large enough to replace 3,250 tons of fuel would be 20 times more massive, at 65,000 tons, displacing two-thirds of the cargo capacity, and requiring triple the number of ships to carry the same cargo. The resulting 13,000,000 kWh of storage20 to travel 10,000 km results in 1,300 kWh/km. 
The open ocean has no refueling stations. Even a refueling ship/platform would have to get the electrical energy from somewhere. Thus, shipping would be radically changed if electrified. Electric ships may not be able to cross open ocean, instead hugging the coast dotted with power plants21 to supply frequent and lengthy charge stops for the ships. 
D.3.3 Long-haul trucking 
Typical "big rigs" on the highway achieve a fuel economy around 6 miles per gallon (40 L/100 km) of fuel, while the most aerodynamic ones achieve 8 mpg (30 L/100 km). Long haul rigs carry two fuel tanks, each holding about 150 gallons (570 L; 425 kg). The range for the more efficient trucks therefore becomes about 2,000 miles (3,200 km).22 Cargo capacity is about 20 tons. 
23 
Total fuel mass is 300 gal times 2.85 kg/gal, or about 850 kg. The same mass of battery would hold 170 kWh and deliver a range of 100 miles (160 km; roughly 1 kWh/km). Ugh. Lots of recharging stops. 
But wait, trucks are big, right? Surely a larger battery can be accommo- dated. Unlike airplanes, where mass is critical, trucks can afford to pack on a larger battery. Some of the cargo space could be devoted to energy storage, surely. What fraction of the space would be acceptable? 
To achieve comparable range as is presently realized, the battery mass would need to be about 20 times the gasoline mass, or 17,000 kg. Oh dear the maximum cargo load was about 20 tons. So 85% of the cargo capacity is taken up by battery, which would seem to be unacceptable. 
A solution would be smaller batteries and more frequent charging stops possibly in the form of forklift-loaded pre-charged modules that are owned by the trucking company and can be interchanged among the fleet. Otherwise a substantial fraction of time would be spent charging: very possibly more time than is spent driving.

It is not impossible24 to electrify long-haul trucking, but neither is it free of significant challenges. Certainly it is not as easy and convenient as fossil fuels.

24: Indeed, Tesla offers a Semi capable of 500 mile range, but see this careful analysis [129] on the hardships. 
D.3.4 Buses 
Like cargo ships and long-haul trucks, public transit buses are on the go much of the time, favoring solutions that can drive all day and charge overnight. Given the stops and breaks, a typical bus may average 30 km/hour and run 14 hours per day for a daily range of approximately 400 km. At an average fuel economy of 3.5 mpg (70 L/100 km), each day requires about 300 L or 220 kg of fuel-no problem for a fuel tank. The equivalent battery would need to be 4,500 kg (900 kWh; 2.3 kWh/km), occupying about three cubic meters. Size itself is not a problem: the roof of the bus could spread out a 0.15 m high pack covering a 2 m x 10 m patch. Buses typically are 10-15 tons, so adding 4.4 tons in battery is not a killer. 
Electrified transit is therefore in the feasible/practical camp. What makes it so unlike the previous examples-is slow travel, modest daily ranges, and the ability to recharge overnight. Raw range efficiency is low, at 2.3 kWh/km, but this drops to a more respectable 0.2 kWh/km person for an average occupancy of 10 riders. 
per 
For charging overnight, a metropolitan transit system running 50 routes and 8 buses per route25 and therefore needs to charge 400 buses over 6 hours at an average rate of 150 kW per bus26 for a total demand of 60 MW equivalent to the electricity demand of about 50,000 homes. 
D.3.5 Passenger Cars 
Passenger cars are definitely feasible and practical for some uses. Typi- cally achieving 0.15-0.20 kWh/km, the average American car driving 12,000 miles per year (about 50 km/day, on average) would need at least 10 kWh capacity to satisfy average daily driving, but would need closer to 100 kWh to match typical ~500 km ranges of gasoline cars. 
At a current typical cost of $200-300 per kWh, such a battery costs $20,000 to $30,000, without the car.27 The most basic home charger runs at 120 V and 12 A,28 multiplying to 1,440 W. A 100 kWh battery actually takes closer to 110-120 kWh of input due to 80-90% charge efficiency. Dividing 115 kWh by 1.44 kW leaves 80 hours29 as the charge time. Table D.1 provides similar details for this and two other higher-power 
scenarios. 
The middle row of Table D.1 is most typical for home chargers and those found in parking lot charge stations, resulting in an effective charge speed of about 10 miles per hour, or 16 km/hr. This is a convenient way to

characterize charge times. Adding enough charge to cover an average day of 30 miles or 50 km will take about 3 hours for the middle-row case, or just over an hour for the high-power charge. 
Imagine now making a long road trip, driving at 100 km per hour. Even the fastest charge rate30 in Table D.1 is 2.5 times slower. Every 400 km driven will take 4 hours on the road plus 10 hours at a charger for an average rate of 28 km/hr,31 or 18 mi/hr. 
Special fast-charge stations can provide a staggering 250 kW32 of power, cutting charge times dramatically. But this is neighborhood-scale energy delivery that households cannot expect to supply themselves. It is also informative to compute the temperature rise of a battery from a fast charge. If charging is 90% efficient, the other 10% turns to heat in the battery. Each kilowatt-hour of battery capacity has an associated mass around 5-10 kg, and receives 0.1 kWh (360 kJ) of thermal energy when charged. At a specific heat capacity around 1,000 J/kg/°C, a 360 kJ deposition increases the cell's temperature by 36-72°C, depending on energy density.33 This is not a small rise (reaching boiling temperatures on warm days), and can contribute to shorter battery lifetime. 
So electric cars are not simple drop-in replacements for the gasoline machines roaming the roads today, that effectively refuel at a rate of 10 MW34 
given the fast delivery of an extremely energy-dense liquid. On performance and convenience measures, it would be hard to characterize them as superior substitutes. But they can certainly suit well for local travel when given ample time to recharge-overnight, for instance. And in the long run, it seems we will have little choice. 
For all this, several things still are not clear: 
1. Will large scale ownership of electric cars become affordable, or remain cost prohibitive? Battery prices will surely fall, but enough? 2. If widespread, how will residential areas cope with tremendous increases in electrical demand during popular recharge hours? 3. How could night-time charging utilize solar input? 4. Will enough people willingly give up long-range driving capabil- 
ity? Will dual-system cars (like plug-in hybrids) be preferred to maintain gas capability for the occasional longer trip? 
5. Will people sour over costly battery decline and replacement? 
Electric cars are a growing part of transportation, and will no doubt grow more. It is too early to tell whether they will be able to displace fossil cars in the intermediate term. If not, personal transportation is likely to decline as fossil fuel use inevitably tapers away.

D.3.6 Wired Systems 
To finalize the progression of hardest-to-easiest electrified transporta- tion, we leave the problematic element behind: batteries. Vehicles on prescribed routes (trains, buses) can take advantage of wires carrying electricity: either overhead or tucked into a "third rail" on the ground. Most light rail systems use this approach, and some cities have wires over their streets for trolley buses. High-speed trains also tend to be driven electrically, via overhead lines. 
The ease with which wired electrical transport is implemented 35 relative to the other modes discussed in this Appendix is another way to emphasize the degree to which storage is the bottleneck. 
D.3.7 Collected Efficiencies 
Each transportation mode in the previous sections reported an efficiency, in terms of kilowatt-hours per kilometer. Not surprisingly, mass and speed play a role, making container ships very hard indeed to push along, followed by airplanes. In some cases, it makes sense to express on a per-passenger or per-ton basis, distributing the energy share among its beneficiaries. Table D.2 summarizes the results, sometimes offering multiple options for vehicle occupancy to allow more fruitful compar- isons among modes. Note that air travel looks pretty good until realizing that the distances involved are often quite large, making total energy expenditure substantial for air travel. 
35: Wired electrified transport has been a steady contributor to transportation for over a century.

Loads are expressed contextually either as people (ppl) or tons (1000 kg). Per-passenger/ton ef- ficiency depends on occupancy-expressed as kWh/km per person (psn)-for which multiple instances are offered in some cases. While trucks have a far better kWh/km measure than ships, ships are about four times more efficient per ton, carrying 5,000 times more cargo. Air freight is 100 times more energetically costly than by ship!

D.4 Pushing Out the Moon 
Some forms of alternative energy are tagged with asterisks in Table 10.1 (p. 166), indicating that they are not technically renewable, but will last a very long time so might as well be considered to be renewable. 
Tidal energy, covered in Sec. 16.2 (p. 280), is one such entry that honestly does not deserve much attention. The text mentioned in passing that 
 
aggressive use of tidal energy has the power to push the moon away from Earth, providing the mechanism by which we could "use up" this resource. Curious students demanded an explanation. Even though it's not of any practical importance, the physics is neat enough that the explanation can at least go in an appendix. 
D.4 Pushing Out the Moon 
403 
less pull 
more pull 
Moon (10x farther) 
The first step is realizing that Earth and Moon each pull on each other36 via gravitation. Since the strength of gravity decreases in proportion to the square of the distance between objects, the side of the earth closest to the moon is pulled more strongly than the center of the earth, and the side opposite the moon is pulled less strongly. The result is an elongation of the earth into a bulge-mostly manifested in the oceans (Figure D.1). 
rotation drags bulge 
Moon 
The second step is to appreciate that the earth rotates "underneath" the moon, so that the bulge-pointing at the moon-is not locked in place relative to continents.37 But friction between land and water "drag" the bulge around, very slightly rotating the bulge to point a little ahead38 of the moon's position (Figure D.2). 
orbital velocity 
resultant (mostly to Earth) has nudge to side 
Now think about how the moon sees the earth, gravitationally. It mostly sees a spherical earth, but also a bulge on the front side, slightly displaced, and a bulge on the back side, also displaced in the opposite direction (Figure D.3). While the bulge masses are equal, the closer one has a greater gravitational influence and acts to pull the moon a little forward in its orbit, speeding it up. 39 
Accelerating an orbiting object along its trajectory adds energy to the orbit and allows the object to "climb" a little farther away from the 
 
Figure D.1: The moon pulls harder on the near side of the earth, and less hard on the back side. Relative to the earth as a whole (medium force), the near side advances to- ward the moon and the back side lags the rest of the earth, creating a bulge on both sides that is aligned toward the moon. Note that a drawing to scale would put the moon well off the page. 
36: In fact, equally, per Newton's third law. 
Figure D.2: The rotation of Earth and it continents "underneath" the tidal bulge creates a friction, or drag, that pulls the bulge around a few degrees (somewhat exaggerated here), so that it no longer points directly at the moon. 
37: This is why we experience two high tides per day and two low tides: the earth is spinning underneath the opposite bulges, so that a site on the surface passes under a bulge (high tide) every 12 hours. 
38: The angular shift is around 1-2°. 
Figure D.3: Gravitationally, the earth looks like a big central mass and two bulge masses displaced from the connecting line. The closer mass pulls harder than the more dis- tant one, so the addition of all the force vectors (not to scale) results in a little asym- metry, leaving a small sideways component of the force along the same direction as the moon's orbital velocity (up in this drawing). 
39: It may help to think of this bulge as being like a carrot dangled in front of a horse, encouraging it forward. 
central body. So this displaced tidal bulge on Earth is tugging the moon forward and causing it to climb about 3.8 cm per year away from Earth. That's one-ten-billionth of its orbital radius per year, so it's not going away for a very long time, indeed.4 
41 
40 
orbital velocity 
resultant force has much larger nudge 
If we built global-scale structures (Figure D.4) to capture tidal energy in a big way,11 we would effectively increase the lag angle of the tidal bulge. This is because we would likely release the captured stack of water over a period of many hours, 42, rotating this stack of water around the planet farther than it would naturally go. Now the gravitational pull in the forward direction would increase and the egress would speed up. If we managed to extract 18 TW43 out of tides, this would be six times larger than the current 3 TW of tidal dissipation, and we might expect the egress to increase to about 23 cm per year. 
It's still a slow rate, and would not drive the moon away faster than hundreds of millions of years. So technically tidal energy is a one- time resource whose use diminishes its long term capacity.44 But the timescales are so ridiculously long that we may as well think of tidal energy as inexhaustible. 
D.5 Humanity's Long View 404 
40: All the same, total solar eclipses will no longer occur after several hundred million years because the moon will be farther and too small to entirely block the sun. 
Figure D.4: If we built some inconceivable global-scale tidal capture structure the size of oceans and let them drain for six hours or so, the artificial bulges we created would travel farther around with the earth's ro- tation, enhancing the sideways "kick" and encouraging the moon to climb away from earth at a faster rate. 
41: Don't count on this happening: it's a truly ludicrous idea plagued by a giant list of practical problems, and all for such a small gain.

D.5 The Long View for Humanity 
Sec. 8.1 (p. 114) took a sweeping view of humanity's timeline as a useful lens through which to appreciate the very short age during which fossil fuels impart a substantial energy benefit. This section revisits this time- warping perspective in a slightly different way as a means to reflect on humanity's far future. 
D.5.1 Success vs. Failure 
We start by noting that human civilization is about 10,000 years old, to the nearest order-of-magnitude.45 Consider this question: 
Is human civilization still in its infancy, or are we closer to the end than the beginning? 
Wow. Heavy question. Of course, we do not know the answer, but most of us would prefer to believe the first-that we are only beginning. So let's roll with that and explore the consequences. 
45: This roughly marks the start of agri- culture, and in any case is far closer to the truth than the adjacent order-of-magnitude figures of 1,000 years or 100,000 years. 
 
In order for human civilization to be in its infancy, it would have to continue for at least 10,000 years more, if not far longer. What would it mean for us to still be operating "successfully" 10,000 years from now? Our physics and math approach actually allows us to place constraints! 
This discussion is limited to living on Earth. Chapter 4 laid out reasons why imagining a space-faring future may be misguided. But even ignoring these arguments, Chapter 1 illustrated that human growth ambitions would be brought to an end long before 10,000 years pass. In this light, it is most straightforward to concentrate on what it would take to succeed on Earth itself.4 
46 
47 
we can 
If we manage to carry our civilization into the far future,4 comfortably call this success. If we don't, well, that would be failure. Can we sketch out what success looks like? One easy way to get there is to start enumerating the things that can't be carried into the far future. 
1. Fossil fuels will not power civilization: a large fraction of the initial inheritance has been spent in a short 200 years, 48 so that 10,000 years in the future it is safe to say they will be long gone. 
2. No steady annual decline of natural resources like forests, fisheries, fresh water, or species populations can be brooked. Allowing any component to decline would mean eventually losing that resource, which may be critical to our survival. 
3. Human population will not be allowed to grow. Even small growth rates will step up pressure on natural resources, and Earth can only support so much, long-term. Independent of what the "right" number is, once settled, we will not be able to dial it up without imperiling the hard-won success. 
49 
4. Even under steady human population, any increase in resource use per person will also not be compatible. In general, growth leads to a dead end: to failure. 
5. Mining materials from the Earth will not continue at anything near the current pace. In the last few hundred years, the best deposits of copper, gold, aluminum, etc. have been found and exploited. Even if only 10% of the attainable resource has been consumed thus far,50 continuing for tens of thousands of years (and beyond) cannot be expected. 
6. Ultimately, any activity that draws down a finite natural resource will be impossible to sustain if the extraction rate is modest or high in relation to the initial resource abundance. Anything that can't last for well over 10,000 years is not a viable long-term solution and should not be exploited if success is the goal. Likewise, any pollutant that can build up to dangerous levels on even these very long timescales cannot be tolerated, if failure is to be avoided. 7. We can use the rule of 70 to say that anything having a doubling time (or halving-time in the case of depletion) shorter than 10,000 years is a no-go for success on these timescales, meaning that any activity impacting resources would have to be held to a growth rate 
D.5 Humanity's Long View 
405 
46: Even if extending to other planets, the same logic will apply. 
47: A useful definition might be uninter- rupted preservation of the knowledge and history gained thus far, without some apoc- alyptic collapse forcing a start-from-scratch revival to the extent that's even plausible.

50:... author's conjecture; it could well be higher 
 
or depletion rate of less than 0.007% per year, which is essentially zero-growth. 
It becomes clear that long-term success is practically synonymous with the word sustainable. Any practice that is not long-term sustainable will fail to continue.51 We therefore cannot depend on any non-sustainable resource if we strive for success. 
D.5 Humanity's Long View 
406 
51: Any activity today not geared to con- tribute to ultimate success (true sustainabil- ity) is therefore likely only contributing to failure. Most activities today are in the latter category, alarmingly. 
D.5.2 Sustainable Living 
Imagine that you have a stash of $100,000 tucked under your mattress, and that you have figured out a way to live on $20,000 per year. You could decide to live on this fund for five years, and then figure out later how to keep going. Perhaps this is not the wisest move. A smarter move would be to figure out how long you expect to live-maybe 50 more years and ration out the fund, allowing $2,000 per year. You'll still need a job earning $18,000 per year to meet the $20,000 annual goal. Maybe the smartest move would be to ignore the money under the mattress and get a job for $20,000 per year. 52 Now you have the safety of resources should you need it, and can even pass it along down the generations to kids and grandkids who have also been taught not to use it, but to survive on their annual income. 
The analogy is clear, and perhaps it is also clear why we did not allow interest accumulation, as many of Earth's resources are one-time endowments that do not spontaneously grow larger.53 If our human civilization succeeds at surviving uninterrupted for 10,000 years, it will necessarily be because we figured out how to live on the annual income54 provided by Earth's natural renewable flows, rather than on the inheritance in the form of finite resources that are not replenished. In other words, humanity needs to learn to refrain from any dependence on one-time resources (the inheritance). 
Success, therefore, puts humans as a part of nature, not apart from nature. Anything else is failure. The closer we are to nature, the more likely we are to succeed. 
Nature prepared a biosphere that has stood the test of time. Natural selection has operated to eliminate non-viable solutions and create inter- dependencies cleverly balanced in a stable equilibrium of sorts. Elements of modern human civilization-our cities, agricultural practices, fossil fuel dependence-have not withstood the test of time, nor can they. Which system would be the wiser bet for long-term survival: the well adapted natural world, or the artificial world humans have erected and operated for a few dozen decades-without attention to sustainable principles? The answer seems obvious. 
52: 
. hardly different from $18,000 per year, so if you're going this far already, why not? 
53: Interest is an artificial construct made possble by accelerating resource use. 
54: Annual income would be in the form of solar energy delivered and biomass that has grown in the course of the year, for instance. 
 
D.5 Humanity's Long View 407 
D.5.3 Time to Grow Up 
In a sense, humanity is going through an awkward adolescent phase: growth spurts, a factory (pimple) strewn landscape, an attitude that we have all the answers-adults55 can't possibly understand or tell us what to do. Conversely, nature is mature.56 Ignoring recent human influences, it had already forged its complex, never perfect, but functional interdependencies and had settled into something resembling a steady state. Adolescents new to the scene may be hugely disruptive and destructive, and unless they change their ways, civilization drives straight into the jaws of failure. The adolescents lack the wisdom to build lasting systems that will have the privilege of co-existing with nature for very long. 
In human society, most adolescents become adults who learn to live within their means. Sometimes this involves sacrifices or perhaps select- ing a diet based on nutrition and health rather than what might be most tasty.57 Likewise, humankind needs to define a scale for its activities that fits within nature's capacity to replenish, so that each subsequent generation is not deprived of resources the previous ones enjoyed. At present, civilization is nowhere close to this operating principle. 
55: ... in this case hypothetical wise hu- mans who have managed a successful tran- sition through the adolescent phase 
56: Note the similarity of the words! 
57:...opting out of the plan to eat ice cream for dinner 
D.5.4 Frameworks 
Humanity needs to develop a framework by which to evaluate its activities and ask whether each helps or hurts ultimate human success. Sometimes this might produce jarring results. Consider, for instance, a cure for cancer or other advances that might extend human lifetimes. Only if balanced against a smaller population or a smaller resource utilization per capita could such seemingly positive developments be accommodated once a steady equilibrium is established. Otherwise, total demand on Earth's resources goes up if the same number of people live longer at a fixed annual resource utilization per living person. In a successful world, any proposed new activity would have to demonstrate how it fits within a sustainable framework. Ignoring the issue would irresponsibly imperil overall long-term human happiness.58 
At some level, humans need to realize that success means the thriving of not only themselves, but all of Earth's precious irreplaceable species and ecosystems. Without them, humans cannot be successful anyway. This is another part of maturing: many adolescents have difficulty considering the impacts of their actions on anyone other than themselves. Humans need to realize that hurting any component of Earth is hurting humans, long-term. Our legal system affords rights to humans, but gives no agency to plants, animals, or even non-living features of our planet. A successful future must give voice to every element of our world, lest we trample it and rue the day. 
58: In such cases, the outcome may ulti- mately settle on longer lives for fewer peo- ple. 
 
D.6 Too Smart to Succeed? 408 
Can it work? Can humans create the institutions and uncorrupted global authority to regulate the entire biosphere-or at least the human interface to prevent unsustainable disruption to the rest? Is human nature compatible with such schemes? Do we have the discipline to deny ourselves easily reached resources for the good of the whole? Individual desires for "more" may always work to subvert sustainable practices. Individual lifetimes are so very short compared to the necessarily long- term considerations of success that it will be very hard to universally accept seemingly artificial restrictions generation after generation. Also unclear is whether it is possible to maintain a technological society preserving knowledge and history while living on the annual renewable resources of the planet. We simply have no guiding precedent for that mode of human existence. 
It is therefore an open question whether a technological society is even compatible with planetary limits. Are modern humans just a passing phase whose creations will crumble into oblivion in a geological blink, or can we stick it out in something other than a primitive state? We again have no evidence59 one way or another. The current state of apparent success cannot be taken as a meaningful proof-of-concept, because it was achieved at the expense of finite resources in a shockingly short time: an extravagant party funded by the great one-time inheritance. The aftermath is only beginning to appear. 
We have a choice: work toward success-hoping and assuming that it is indeed possible; or acquiesce to failure. It seems that if we are not wise enough to know whether long-term success is even possible, the responsible course of action would be to assume that we can succeed, and do what we can to maximize our chances of arriving there. When should we start? Again-without knowing any better-the sooner we start, the more likely we are to succeed. Any delay is another way 
of driving ourselves toward a more likely failure. 
D.6 Too Smart to Succeed? 
This section pairs nicely with Section D.5, taking a slightly different perspective on the prospect of future success. 
60 
Evolution works incrementally by random experimentation: mutations that either confer advantages or disadvantages to the organism. Advan- tages are then naturally selected to propagate to future generations," while disadvantages are phased out by failure of afflicted organisms in competition for resources and mates. Evolution is slow, and hard to spot from one generation to the next. When a common ancestor of the hippo evolved into whales, the nose did not suddenly disappear from the face to end up behind the head as a blow-hole, but took a tortuously long adaptive route to its present configuration. 
59: See Sec. 18.4 (p. 312) on the Fermi para- dox for a worrisome-albeit inconclusive- 
lack of evidence of success in the universe. 
60: After all, advantages make survival and procreation more likely. 
 
D.6 Too Smart to Succeed? 
409 
Intelligence confers obvious advantages to organisms, able to "out- smart" competition to find resources, evade dangers, and adapt to new situations. It also has some cost in terms of energy resources devoted to a larger brain. But multiple organisms from across the animal kingdom have taken advantage of the "smart" niche: octopuses, ravens, dolphins, and apes to name a few. Experiments reveal the ability of these species to solve novel, brainy puzzles in order to get at food, for instance. 
Like other attributes, intelligence would not be expected to arrive sud- denly, but would incrementally improve. Humans are justified in ap- praising themselves as the most intelligent being yet on the planet. 
So here's the thing. The first species smart enough to exploit fossil fuels will do so with reckless abandon. Evolution did not skip steps and create a wise being-despite the fact that the sapiens in our species name62 
means wise. A wise being would recognize early on the damage inherent in profligate use of fossil fuels63 and would have refrained from unfettered exploitation. 
Put another way, the first species entertaining the notion that they are able to outsmart nature is in for a surprise. Earth's evolutionary web of life is dumb: it has no intelligence at all. But it exists in this universe on the strength of billions of years of tested success. All the random experiments along the way that were unworkable got weeded out. The vast majority of species around today have checked the box for long-term viability. 
Modern humans-those who have moved beyond hunter-gatherer lifestyles, anyway-represent an exceedingly short-lived experiment in evolutionary terms. This is especially true for the fossil fuel era of the last few centuries. It would be premature to declare victory. The jury is still out on whether civilization is compatible with nature and planetary limits, as explored in Section D.5. 
Evolution does not avoid mistakes. In fact, it is built upon and derives its awesome power precisely because of those few mistakes that somehow escape the more likely failed outcomes and find advantage in the mistake.64 Maybe humans are one of those more typical evolutionary mistakes that will culminate in the usual failure, as so often happens. The fact that we're here and smart says nothing about our chances for long-term success. Indeed, humankind's demonstrated ability to produce unintended global adverse consequences would suggest that success is less than a safe bet. 
It seems fairly clear that hunter-gatherer humans could have continued essentially indefinitely on the planet. And the brains of hunter-gatherer Homo sapiens are indistinguishable from those of modern humans. So intelligence by itself is not enough to cross the line into existential peril, if continuing to operate within and as a part of natural ecosystems. But once that intelligence is applied toward creating artificial environments65 that no longer adhere to the ways of nature once we make our own rules 
61: Intelligence is not the only sort of ad- vantage, and can easily lose to tooth and claw, or even mindless microscopic threats: nature has devised many ways to "win." 
62: ... self-assigned flattery 
63: Not only is climate change a problem, but building an entire civilization depen- dent on a finite energy resource and also en- abling a widespread degradation of natural ecosystems seems like an amateur blunder.

as we "outsmart" nature we run a grave risk as nature and evolution cease to protect us. In other words, a species that lives completely within the relationships established by the same evolutionary pressures that created that species is operating on firm ground: well adapted and likely to succeed, having stood the test of time.66 
Once we part ways with nature and create our own reality—our own rules-survival is no longer as guaranteed. Even 10,000 years is not enough time to prove the concept, when human evolution works on much longer timescales. This is especially true for the fossil fuel world, being mere centuries old. Nature will be patient while our fate unfolds. 
The situation is similar to establishing a habitat on the lunar surface: an artificial environment to provision our survival in an otherwise deadly setting. The resources that were available to construct the habitat are not continually provided by the lunar environment, just as the fossil fuels and mined resources and forests are not continually re-supplied67 deplete them. Just because the habitat could be built does not mean it can be maintained indefinitely. Likewise, the world we know today-being rather different from anything that nature prepared-may be a one-off that proves to be unsustainable in the long run.

Since evolution is incremental, we cannot expect to have been made wise enough to avoid the pitfalls of being just smart enough to exploit planetary resources. And being slow, it seems unlikely that wisdom. will evolve fast enough to interrupt our devastating shopping spree. It is possible68 that we can install an "artificial" wisdom by using our intelligence to adopt values and global rules by which to ensure a sustainable existence. Probably most smart people assume that we can do so. Maybe. But living in a collective is difficult. Wisdom may exist in a few individuals, but bringing the entire population around to enlightened, nuanced thinking that values nature and the far future more than they value themselves and the present seems like a stretch. 
One way to frame the question: 
Are humans collectively capable of leaving most shelves stocked with treats, within easy reach, while refraining from consuming them, generation after generation? 
Do we have the discipline to value a distant and unknown future more than we value ourselves and our own time? Successful non-human species have never had to answer this question, but neither has any species been smart enough—until we came along to develop the capability to steal all the goodies from the future and, in so doing, jeopardize their own success.

a reasonably long track record of success behind it.

D.6.1 Evolution's Biggest Blunder? 
As a brief follow-on, we framed evolution as a mistake-machine, some- times accidentally producing functionally advantageous incremental improvements. Countless species adapt in ways that are not able to survive long term, and die off. So those "blunders" are inconsequential failed experiments. Evolution is indifferent to failure, being a mechanism rather than a sentient entity. 
But most of the time, these failures are isolated, bearing little consequence on the wider world. Did anybody notice the three-dotted bark slug70 disappear? If the human species turns out to be another of evolution's failed experiments-having made a creature too smart to stay within the lanes of nature is it just another inconsequential blunder? 
Unfortunately, it may turn out to be a rather costly blunder, if the failed species creates a mass extinction as part of its own failure. By changing the climate and habitat on the planet, we have already terminated or imperiled a number of species, and are nowhere near finished yet. Mass extinctions have happened many times through history, but seldom due to an evolutionary blunder. We may yet distinguish ourselves! 
It is true that cyanobacteria transformed the climate starting about 2.5 billion years ago by pumping oxygen into the atmosphere. Called the Great Oxygenation Event, this precipitated the first-known mass extinction on the planet-essentially poisoning the simple anaerobic lifeforms that existed until that time. But we would hesitate to call it an 
unmitigated disaster, as it paved the way for multi-cellular life?1 in all the richness we see today. So accidental? Yes. Blunder? Okay. Disastrous? Let's say no, on balance.72 
The most recent mass extinction, 65 Myr ago, was caused by an asteroid impact, and the two before that appear to be connected to volcanic activity. The two prior to these are mixed: the first appears to have been caused by geological processes, and the next by a changing climate likely connected to diversification of land-based plants. And that's it, since the much earlier cyanobacteria oxygenation event. Only one of the five is likely attributable to evolution itself—and in this case not the fault of a single species. 
A human-caused mass extinction could pave the way to whole new modes of lifeforms. But it was much easier in the early days to break new ground. It seems much less likely that a human-induced mass extinction will unleash a fantastic evolutionary richness hitherto unexplored. That leaves only downside, and the ignominious distinction of being the one species that evolution would most regret, if ever it could. 
Please, please, please let this tragic fate not come to pass!
