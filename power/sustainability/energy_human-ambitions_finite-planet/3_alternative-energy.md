ALTERNATIVE ENERGY
The options have not changed in 50 years. There is nothing new under the sun.
10 Renewable Overview
We now understand that the path human civilization has traveled to this point-a path paved by fossil fuels cannot lead very much farther before a new path must take over. One distinct possibility is a trek back toward a low-tech existence, but most people would consider such a development to be a failure. What would success look like, then? Sec. D.5 (p. 404) in the Appendices takes a look at the big picture of long-term human success, but for present purposes we will focus on the critical issue of energy: where could we get enough energy to replace the prodigious one-time gift of fossil fuels?
This chapter is very brief, only setting the stage for upcoming chapters that go into alternative energy sources in greater detail. At the end of this effort, Chapter 17 summarizes the potential of all the energy resources. For now, we describe the origins and scales of Earth's energy inputs, and finish with a reminder of how much energy we get from these sources today.
10.1 The Players
Before launching into detailed attributes of energy sources beyond fossil fuels, it is helpful to list the cast of characters.
► Hydroelectric energy (Chap. 11) traps water from a river behind a dam, forced to flow through a turbine1 that spins a generator to make electricity.
► Wind energy (Chap. 12) spins a turbine2 that makes electricity via a generator.

10 Renewable Overview

► Solar energy (Chap. 13) can provide direct heat or make electricity via photovoltaic (PV) panels or in a utility-scale solar thermal installation.
► Biological energy (Chap. 14) can range from food to firewood, or biofuels. These are generally a source of thermal energy, via burning, able to drive heat engines.
▸ Nuclear Fission (Chap. 15) relies on mining a finite supply of radioactive elements in the Earth's crust whose fission (splitting) generates heat that can make steam to run a heat engine and generator to make electricity.
▸ Nuclear Fusion (Chap. 15), if successful, would use abundant hydrogen resources from water to build helium nuclei-a process that would release heat to make steam for running a heat engine and generator to make electricity.
► Geothermal energy (Chap. 16) originates in Earth's hot interior, and can be used for heating or to make steam to run a heat engine and generator to make electricity.
► Tidal Capture (Chap. 16) is very similar to hydroelectricity, but based on trapped tidal basins instead of dammed rivers.
▸ Ocean Currents (Chap. 16) behave much like wind, and can be
used similarly to produce electricity, but underwater.
► Waves (Chap. 16) bring energy to shorelines that can drive special- ized generators to make electricity.
One prevalent theme connects most of these entries: lots of electricity, often by way of heat engines and/or generators. Indeed, alternatives to fossil fuels tend to excel at electricity production. But as we saw in Fig. 7.2 (p. 105), electricity makes up only 38% of energy demand in the U.S., and only 17% of the energy delivered to the four end-use sectors.3 One lesson is that current energy uses that are not electricity-based-like transportation and industrial processing-will be more difficult to replace by the alternatives above.
3: While 38.3 qBtu of the 101.3 qBtu total energy input in the U.S. is dedicated to elec- tricity production, only 13.0 qBtu emerges from the process, which is 17% of the 76 qBtu total flowing into these end-use sectors.

10.2 Alternatives vs. Renewables
Before going further, we should clarify the difference between "alterna- tive" and "renewable" resources.
Definition 10.2.1 Alternative Energy is a non-fossil source of energy. Solar, wind, and nuclear would be examples.
Definition 10.2.2 Renewable Energy is a source of energy that is replen- ished by nature, so that its use may be sustained "indefinitely," without depletion. Solar energy, for instance is not "used up" by placing a panel in the sunlight.

The sun will continue to shine no matter how many solar panels we set out. Wind is replenished daily by the sun heating the land and driving air currents. Solar energy drives the hydrological cycle, refilling the reservoirs behind hydroelectric dams. Plants grow back to replace harvested ones again thanks to the sun. Ocean currents and waves are also driven by the sun, via wind.
Nothing, of course, lasts forever, but the sun will continue to operate in its current mode for billions of years more, and this is long enough to count as indefinite, for our purposes. Table 10.1 classifies various sources as to whether they are alternatives or renewables, along with justifications. The items with asterisks are technically not renewable, but last long enough that we can treat them as such in a practical sense (see Box 10.1).

Just because a resource is renewable does not mean it is limitless.5 We only have so much land, nutrients, and fresh water to grow biomass, for example. Cutting trees down faster than they grow back would result in depleting the resource-possibly permanently if the land is altered severely enough that trees do not grow back. Installing turbines throughout the ocean to capture ocean currents would eventually create enough impediment to the flow that it could stop altogether.
Box 10.1: About Those Asterisks...
The items sporting asterisks in Table 10.1 deserve additional expla- nation as to why they are not technically renewable, even if the depletion timescales are extremely long.
Capturing all available tidal energy would end up accelerating the moon's egress from Earth, eventually causing loss of the resource.
About half of the geothermal energy store represents a one-time
5: Ultimately, only so much sunlight strikes
the earth.
6: This would be a hugely expensive and impractical undertaking, but helps illustrate the point that renewable does not mean unlimited.
7:...now at 3.8 cm/year
8: It would take hundreds of millions of years to "accomplish" this (see Sec. D.4; p. 402).

deposit of heat left over from the collapse/formation of the earth, the other half coming from radioactive decays of elements ultimately tracing to ancient astrophysical cataclysms.10 For both the formation and radioactive contributions, the supply is not replenished after its use, although the timescale for the radioactive decays to fade away is billions of years.
Nuclear fusion needs deuterium and tritium." Roughly one out of every 10,000 hydrogen atoms is deuterium, so ocean water (H2O) will have enough deuterium to last billions of years. Tritium, however, is not found naturally and must be synthesized from lithium, in finite supply. Details will follow in Chapter 15.
10.3 Renewable Energy Budget
Notice that all of the unqualified12 "Yes" entries in Table 10.1 originate from the sun. For that matter, fossil fuels represent captured ancient solar energy, stored for all these years. The sun sends energy toward the earth at a rate of 1,360 W/m2. Multiplying this by the projected area13 of the earth (R≈ 1.28 x 1014 m2) results in 174,000 TW of solar power intercepting the earth. This number absolutely dwarfs the 18 TW societal energy budget of all humans on Earth. Figure 10.1 shows graphically what happens to this energy input.

Example 10.3.1 Solar Input: Because we will encounter solar power flux many times in this textbook, this is a good opportunity to spell out some key numbers and concepts.
First, sunlight arriving at the top of Earth's atmosphere delivers energy at a rate of 1,360 Joules per second per square meter (1,360 W/m2), which is known as the solar constant [4].
Figure 10.1: Energy inputs to the earth, ig- noring the radiation piece (since that is an output channel). About 70% of incoming solar energy is absorbed by the atmosphere and land, while about 30% is immediately reflected back to space (mostly by clouds). About half of the energy absorbed at the surface
into evaporating water, while goes smaller portions drive winds, photosyn- thesis (land and sea), and ocean currents. Additional non-solar inputs are geothermal and tidal in origin [63-65].

Treating Earth as a sphere of radius R, it has surface area 47R2, but the sun doesn't "see" the whole surface at once. In fact, from the vantage point of the rays of sunlight intercepting Earth, what matters is the projection of Earth,14 which just looks like a disk of area лR2. Averaging the solar input across the entire planet therefore reduces the 1,360 W/m2 by a factor of 4 to 340 W/m2.
Not all the sunlight arriving at the top of the atmosphere makes it to the surface, so in practice, a typical location will receive an average15 of about 200 W/m2. This is a number that comes up often as a typical insolation, so is worth remembering.
Clouds and ice (mostly) reflect almost 30% of incoming sunlight, leaving 123,000 TW to be absorbed by land, water, and atmosphere in various forms (see Table 10.2). Virtually all of the energy hitting the surface goes to direct thermal absorption,16 much of which then flows into evaporation of water-the starting point of the hydrological cycle. A tiny portion of the absorbed energy gives rise to wind, some of which will drive waves. An even smaller portion contributes to photosynthesis and supports essentially all life (biology) on the planet. And finally, a tiny fragment of the absorbed energy drives ocean currents. Table 10.2 tracks where the incoming solar energy goes, in several stages, also listing non-solar geothermal and tidal contributions. For comparison, the current energy scale of human activity is approximately 18 TW, while human metabolism,17 is about 0.8 TW.

Example 10.3.2 Solar Heating: How much would a black table18 warm up sitting in full sun for ten minutes?
A nice round-number approximation of full overhead sunlight is that it delivers 1,000 W/m2 to the ground. If we situate a table whose top surface area is 1 m2, has a mass of 20 kg, and a specific heat capacity

of 1,000 J/kg/°C under full sun, we can proceed as follows.
The table will absorb 1,000 J per second,19 and therefore receives 600,000 J over the course of ten minutes. Multiplying the specific heat capacity by the table mass means the table absorbs 20,000 J for every 1°C of temperature rise, and therefore would climb 30°C in 10 minutes, in this case. That's a little unrealistically high, because a real table would also have cooling influences from the air and infrared radiation. But the main point is to show how absorbed sunlight heats things up-like the Earth.
Box 10.2: Making New Fossil Fuels
We know from Chapter 8 that fossil fuels get their energy from ancient photosynthesis trapped in buried plant matter.20 We also now have a figure for how much solar power goes into photosynthesis: 100 TW.
We can compare this to the power that goes into making new fossil fuels right now by noting that the entire fossil fuel resource contains roughly21 1023J (page 127), and formed over something like 100 million years, or about 3 x 1015 seconds. Dividing the two gives a
of about 3 x 107 W, or 30 MW.22
power
Three neat insights come out of this. First, we currently burn fossil fuels at a rate of about 15 TW, which is 500,000 times faster than they are being replaced! It's like short-circuiting a battery in a dramatic explosion of power. Imagine charging a phone for 2 hours and discharging it 500,000 times faster: in 0.014 seconds! Now look at the extravagant lights of Las Vegas: should we be proud of the blaze of glory or appalled?23
Secondly, out of the total 100 TW photosynthetic budget on Earth, only 30 MW gets captured as fossil fuels, which is one part in three-million. Therefore, the chances that any given living matter on the planet today eventually ends up converted to fossil fuels is exceedingly slim.
Finally, if we only used fossil fuels at a rate of 30 MW,24, then we could consider fossil fuels to be a renewable resource, as the sun/geology will slowly make more! So whether or not something is renewable also relies on the rate of use not exceeding the rate at which it is replenished.
19: Because a Watt is a Joule per second and the table area is 1 m2; the black property essentially means that it absorbs all light that hits it.
20: In some cases, animals ate the plants first, but the energy starts in plants.
21: It is not important to nail down precise numbers for this exercise.
22: For reference, a single large university consumes energy at about this rate.
23: Also coming to mind is the Big Bay Boom in San Diego, July 4, 2012, when the entire fireworks display that was meant to last 15-20 minutes all went off in a few dazzling seconds. LMAO. Best ever!
24: This amount of power could supply only a single campus-sized consumer on Earth.

Table 10.3: U.S. Renewable energy con- sumption in 2018. The last column compares to the 101.3 qBtu total U.S. consumption in 2018 [34]. Asterisks denote thermal equiva- lent conversions. While the second column of numbers would be more naturally ex- pressed in GW, the choice of TW is delib- erate to emphasize how small renewable usage is compared to the available resource.
In 2018, roughly 11% of energy in the U.S. came from renewable resources. Table 10.3 lists the contributions from each, the data coming from the Annual Energy Review published by the U.S. Energy Information Administration for 2018. As introduced in Box 7.2 (p. 106), the EIA adopts the practice of assigning a thermal equivalent for each source, in qBtu, even if the source had nothing to do with a thermal process. The rationale is to put everything on the same footing as fossil fuels, for more direct quantitative comparisons. In doing so, they implicitly use the average thermal-to-delivered energy efficiency for fossil fuels of 37.5%.25 In other words, it takes 100 units of thermal fossil energy to produce 37.5 units of useful work. If, then, a solar panel delivers 37.5 units of energy over some amount of time, it will be called 100 units of "input" (thermal equivalent), even though it only delivered 37.5 units.26
27
Four forms dominate Table 10.3 (and Figure 10.2), each roughly equal in contribution. Lumping wood and biofuels into a generic "biomass" puts this aggregate category in the clear lead, accounting for nearly half of our renewable energy. As noted, the entries in Table 10.3 are in qBtu of thermal equivalent, and these have been converted to TW, for easy comparison to Table 10.2.28 A key take-away is how tiny the renewable energy numbers are compared to the natural flows in Earth's energy budget.
10.5 Upshot: Our Path Forward
We are now ready to plunge into learning about renewable energy resources. The topics are arranged according to ease of understanding the associated physics, which will be new to many students. So while solar is the most potent of the resources, its chapter follows those of hydroelectricity and wind, since its scheme for generating electricity29 is likely the least intuitive of the three. Biologically-derived energy comes next sharing its direct sunlight origin with solar. Following a foray into nuclear energy, a number of minor contributors that are unlikely to be important are relegated to a single chapter of misfits, for completeness.
After this, we will be in a position to assess the entire landscape of alternative energy options (Chapter 17). The book will then take a turn

    sun overhead, a solar panel has access to more light than the 48% depicted reaching the ground. If we can also capture the portion that on average is reflected by the ground and clouds,35 what might we expect for the rate of energy reaching the ground (in W/m2) if the input at the top of the atmosphere is 1,360 W/m2?
12. Similar to Example 10.3.2, how much warmer would you expect a 10 cm deep puddle of water36 to get after an hour in full sun, if the water absorbs all the energy and does not lose it to the environment?
13. Comparing Table 10.2 and Table 10.3, what is the most striking mismatch,37 in terms of large potential vs. small contribution to U.S. energy consumption?
14. In one day, a typical residential solar installation might deliver about 10 kilowatt-hours of energy. Meanwhile, a gallon of gasoline contains about 37 kWh of thermal energy. But the two ought not be directly compared, as burning the gasoline inevitably loses a lot of energy as heat. Correcting the solar output to a thermal equivalent,38 how many gallons per day of gasoline could it displace?
15. The U.S. occupies about 2% of Earth's surface area, thus collecting only part of the 83,000 TW absorbed at the surface. Compare the amount of solar power received by the U.S. to the total renewable power in Table 10.3.39 By what factor are we "underutilizing" the solar input, under the simplifying assumption that we could use all of it?
    35: Recall, it's a clear day; no clouds.

    11 Hydroelectric Energy
    Energy has been harnessed from flowing water for ages. Milling oper- ations were often located on streams so that water could turn a wheel attached to grinding machinery. Today, captured water flow is a signifi- cant contributor to electricity worldwide in the form of hydroelectricity. The U.S. gets about 2.8% of its current energy (and 7% of electricity) from hydropower. Globally, hydropower accounts for about 9% of energy, or 16% of electrical production (Table 7.2; p. 107).
    Hydroelectricity taps into the solar-driven evaporation cycle, relying on the gravitational energy embodied in water lifted onto the land from lower bodies of water. In other words, solar energy lifts water, giving it gravitational potential energy, which is captured and converted to electrical energy.
    While hydroelectric power is a simple and low-tech form of renewable energy that has been heavily exploited for over a hundred years, it is not one that is easy to expand beyond its current level of usage. This chapter will provide a better understanding of this mainstay of the renewable portfolio and its likely role in our future.
    11.1 Gravitational Potential Energy
    Gravitational force is incredibly weak. It may not seem so from daily experience, but consider the fact that a magnet held in your hand can lift a paperclip overwhelming the gravitational pull of the entire earth! By comparison, electromagnetic forces are forty orders-of-magnitude stronger than gravitational force. We don't tend to notice because electric charges tend to balance out so that gravity is the most obvious force in our daily lives.1

    Tidal power works in exactly the same way as hydroelectricity, but is a niche player and will be deferred to Section 16.2.
    1: Somewhat ironically, we only feel gravity because of a much stronger electromagnetic force that prevents us from falling through the floor. Electrons in the atoms in the floor and our feet repel each other to prevent free- fall a weightless state in which gravity can't be felt!
    We know intuitively that lifting a massive object requires work, and thus energy. In fact, since work is defined as a force times distance,2 and the force of gravity on an object follows Newton's second law, F == ma,3 the force we need to exert on an object to lift it against gravity is called its weight, and is W = mg, where g = 9.8 m/s2≈ 10 m/s2 is the acceleration due to gravity on the surface of the earth. Thus, to lift an object through height, h, requires an energy input of this force, W, times the height, h. We call this gravitational potential energy since the energy put in to lift something can be released later if the mass is allowed to fall or be lowered. An early use of gravitational potential energy was in the form of weights on chains in old clocks.
    Definition 11.1.1 gravitational potential energy is computed as
    11 Hydroelectric Energy 174
    2: Recall Def. 5.1.1 (p. 68).
    3: Force is mass times acceleration.
    G.P.E. = mgh,
    (11.1)
    where m is the mass in kg, g≈ 10 m/s2 is the acceleration due to gravity, and h is the height to which the mass is raised, in meters. The result is in Joules.
    Most commonly, gravitational potential energy is converted to kinetic energy as an object falls: slowly at first but accelerating as more potential energy is converted to kinetic energy while the object gains speed (see Fig. 5.1; p.70). Only the vertical distance matters in computing gravitational potential energy: sideways motion does not operate against the gravitational force. Sliding a crate across a flat, level floor does take work to overcome friction, but that energy is converted to heat and cannot be later returned in useful form.5 In this case, the crate has gained no gravitational potential energy, since its height never changed.
    Example 11.1.1 Lifting a 20 kg box of books, whose weight is therefore W = mg≈ 200 N,6 from the floor to a high shelf through a vertical distance of 2 m involves an energy expenditure of mgh≈ 400 J (Figure 11.1). We would say the box gained 400 J of potential energy.
    If the person doing the work is exerting energy at a rate of 200 W (200 J/s), it will take two seconds to complete the action.
    If the box later falls off the shelf and hits a 1.5 m tall person on the head, the box has lost 100 J (20 kg × 10 m/s2x 0.5 m) of potential energy (now kinetic) by the time it hits the person's head.
    11.1.1 Comparison to Other Forms
    To give a flavor of how weak gravitational potential energy is compared to other familiar forms of energy storage, we will consider the energy content in a standard AA alkaline battery and in a similar volume of gasoline. So we're talking about something approximately the size of
    4: Some may remember it more pedanti- cally as 9.8 m/s2, but for the purposes of this book, 10 m/s2 will do nicely. Note that choosing this number implies that we are concerned only with gravitational energy on the earth's surface.
    5: We often say in this case that the energy is "lost." But energy is strictly conserved- not created or destroyed so it is never really lost, it just escapes into a non-useful form.

    a small finger. We want to know how much mass must be lifted to yield the same amount of gravitational potential energy as is contained in a battery or equivalent volume of gasoline. In the comparison, we will imagine having a hoist that can lift a large mass? 4 m high-about house-height.
    A standard AA battery cell has a charge rating of 2.5 Ah3 and operates at about 1.5 V. Following the development in Sec. 5.8 (p.76), we multiply these two numbers to get 3.75 Wh, translating to 13.5 kJ. Equating this to mgh, where we know g≈ 10 m/s2 and h = 4 m, we find that m≈ 340 kg. That's really heavy-about the mass of 4-5 people." Meanwhile, the AA battery is a puny 0.023 kg. Reflect for a moment on this comparison, visualizing 340 kg lifted 4 m above the ground providing the same amount of energy as a AA battery held in your hand.
    11
    10
    Gasoline is even more extreme. At an energy density around 34 kJ per mL of volume, filling a AA-sized cup10 with gasoline yields about 250 kJ of energy.11 Performing the same computation, we would need to lift over 6,000 kg (6 metric tons) to a height of 4 m to get the same energy content. Typical cars have masses in the 1,000-2,000 kg range, so we're talking about something like 4 cars! One caveat is that we are not typically able to convert the thermal energy in gasoline12 into useful work at much better than 25%, while gravitational potential energy can be converted at nearly 100%. Still, being able to lift 1,500 kg13 to a height of 4 m using the energy in 7 mL of gasoline is rather impressive, again emphasizing that gravitational potential energy is pretty weak. It only amounts to significance when the masses (volumes) of water are rather large.
    11.2 Hydroelectric Energy
    The basic idea behind hydroelectricity is that water in a reservoir behind a dam (Figure 11.2) creates pressure at the base of the dam that can force water to flow through a turbine that drives a generator to make electricity-sharing elements of Fig. 6.2 (p. 90) but spinning the turbine by water flow instead. The amount of energy available works out to be the gravitational potential energy corresponding to the height of water at the lake's surface relative to the water level on the other side. It's as if dropping the water from the surface to the turbine and asking how much potential energy it gave up in the process. In reality, water is not dropping from the lake surface, but the force on the water at the turbine is determined by the height of water above it: the "pressure head," as it is called. The process is highly efficient, approaching 90% capture of the potential energy in the water delivered as electrical power from the generator.

    Box 11.1: Why So Efficient?
    14
    Achieving 90% efficiency is superb! Electric motors and generators1 can be > 90% efficient in converting between mechanical energy (rotation) and electrical energy. When coupled with low-friction turbines, dams just have very little loss-unlike thermal sources where most of the energy is unavoidably lost (for reasons covered in Sec. 6.4; p. 88).
    Example 11.2.1 To compute the power available from a hydroelectric plant, we need to know the height of the reservoir and the flow rate of water-usually measured in cubic meters per second. The density of water is, conveniently, 1,000 kg/m3 (Figure 11.3), so that if we consider a dam having a flow rate of 2,000 m3/s and a reservoir height of 50 m, we can see that every second of time will pass 2 × 106 kg of water,15 and the associated potential energy is mgh≈ 109 J. If each second delivers 1 GJ of energy, the power available is 1 GJ/s, or 1 GW. At an efficiency of 90%, we get to keep 900 MW of electrical power.
    The largest hydroelectric facility in the world is the Three Gorges Dam in China, rated at an astounding 22.5 GW. The largest in the U.S. is the Grand Coulee on the Columbia River, producing a maximum of 6.8 GW. The iconic Boulder Dam (a.k.a. Hoover Dam) is just over 2 GW.
    Note that flow rates vary seasonally with rainfall, so that dams cannot always operate at full capacity. In fact, the U.S. has about 80 GW of capacity installed, but operates at an annual average of about 33 GW. This implies a typical "capacity factor" around 40%.
    Definition 11.2.1 A capacity factor is the ratio of actual performance over time to the peak possible performance—or average output divided by maximum output, expressed as a percentage.
    Example 11.2.2 Boulder (Hoover) Dam on the Colorado River is listed in [66] as having a capacity of 2,080 MW and an annual production of 4.2 TWh. What is its capacity factor?
    We just need to turn the 4.2 TWh in a year into an average delivered power. Following the definition of a watt-hour, we note that all we really have to do is divide 4.2 x 1012 Wh16 by the number of hours in a year: 24 times 365, or 8760.
    4.2 x 1012 Wh/8760 h≈ 480 MW average power. Dividing this by 2,080 MW (max capacity) gives a 23% capacity factor.
    As we saw in Fig. 7.5 (p. 108) and Table 10.3 (p. 170), hydroelectricity in the U.S. accounts for 2.7% of the nation's total energy consumption, corresponding to about 33 GW of production. Globally, hydroelectric production averaged 477 GW in 2017. By comparison, Table 10.2 (p. 168)

    indicates that 44,000 TW of solar input goes into evaporation and the hydrological cycle. Why, then, are we only able to use 0.477 TW (0.001%) of this bounty? Is this a great, untapped renewable resource?
    11.2.1 Theoretical Potential
    To understand the giant mismatch between solar input and hydroelectric development, we first need to study evaporation.
    Definition 11.2.2 The heat of vaporization of water is about 2,250 J per gram, meaning that every gram of water that goes from liquid to gas (vapor) requires an energy input of ~2,250 J.
    Box 11.2: Vaporization is Serious Energy
    To put this in perspective, it takes 100 calories (418 J) to bring one gram of water from freezing to boiling temperature. Then it takes another 2,250 J to evaporate the water, which is a far larger quantity. This is why water in a pot does not all flash into steam once the water reaches 100°C, as it would if the evaporation energy was very small. Instead, a boiling pot will retain water for a good while as energy continues to be applied before all boiling away.

    800 m
    So let's follow the energetics of a gram of water17 on its journey to a hydroelectric dam-most of which is represented in Figure 11.4. First, the sun injects 2,250 J to evaporate that gram. Then let's say it gets lofted to 5 km.18 The gravitational potential energy, mgh, comes to 0.001 X 10 X 5000 = 50 J. That's only 2% of the amount that went into evaporation.19
    When the water condenses in the cloud, it releases 2,250 J of thermal energy into the cloud/air, then falls back to the ground as rain, offering 50 J of still-available energy. If it falls on the ocean, where it presumably started, it gives up all 50 J of gravitational potential energy into useless forms.20 But if it falls on land-higher than sea level-it retains some gravitational potential, based on how high that land is above sea level.

    Figure 11.4: The hydrological cycle. Sun- light evaporates water from the surface, at a cost of 2,250 J per gram. Each kilometer of height the gram of water gains in forming clouds costs an additional 10 J. When rain falls on terrain, most of the gravitational potential energy is spent, but on average retains 8 J-based on an average land ele- vation of 800 m. The 2,250 J of evaporation energy is released as heat when the water condenses into clouds.

    On
    average, terrain is about 800 m above sea level, so each gram that falls on land has an average of 8 J left as available energy. But only 29% of the earth's surface is land, so that the gram of water we're tracking preserves about 2 J of energy, on average.
    21
    We're down to only 0.1% of the input solar energy-2 J out of 2,300 J input-so that the theoretical hydroelectric potential might be about 44 TW: reduced from the 44,000 TW input. But only a small fraction of rain flows into rivers suitable for damming. And once dammed, a typical dam height is in the neighborhood of 50 m, knocking us down even further. Much of the journey from terrain to reservoir involves losing elevation in streams too small to practically dam, or just seeping through the ground. In the end, perhaps it is not surprising that we end up in the sub-TW regime globally.
    Detailed assessments [67] of hydroelectric potential globally estimate a technically feasible potential22 around 2 TW, but only half of this is deemed to be economically viable. Recall that 477 GW, or about 0.5 TW, is delivered globally, which is therefore about half of what we believe to be the practical limit of ~1 TW. Thus we might not expect more than a factor-of-two expansion of current hydroelectricity as possible/practical. The low-hanging fruit has been plucked already, capturing about half of the total practical resource.
    Compared to the 18 TW global scale of energy use, hydroelectricity is not poised to assume a large share at this level, unless the overall scale of energy use is reduced substantially. Let's say this more visibly: hydroelectric power cannot possibly come close to satisfying present global power demand.
    11.3 Hydropower in the U.S.
    Hydroelectric power is not available to the same degree everywhere. Geography and rainfall are key factors. This brief section serves to present a snapshot of the distribution and qualities of hydroelectric power generation in the United States. We start with Figure 11.5, showing the average hydroelectric power generated in each state, the top four states being listed in Table 11.1. These four states account for 56% of hydroelectricity in the U.S., and the next states on the ranked list drop to 1 GW or lower. Most of the California generation is in the northern part of the state, effectively as part of the Pacific Northwest region.
    To get a sense for how concentrated different sources are, we will make a habit of examining power density for renewable resource implemen- tations. Figure 11.6 indicates the state-by-state density of hydroelectric power generation,23 just dividing generation by state area. No state exceeds 0.05 W/m2, which can be contrasted to insolation values (see Ex. 10.3.1; p. 167) of ~200 W/m2. Globally, total land area is about
    21: ... reduced from 8 J since most rain falls back onto ocean
    The 90% efficiency of a hydroelectric dam is now contextualized a bit better. That last step is pretty efficient, but the overall pro- cess is extremely inefficient. Still, it takes rel- atively little effort to exploit, and provides real power. Efficiency is not everything.

    1.25 x 1014 m2, so that a total hydroelectric potential of 2.5 TW24 would yield 0.02 W/m2. Therefore, the state of Washington stands out as unusual, having already developed a generation capacity 2.5 times larger than the upper-end global average expectation. In other words, most of the world cannot emulate what nature has provided in Washington. Not all places have the same available resources.

    Hydro density (mW/m2)
    Next, we look at hydroelectric generation per capita. Figure 11.7 shows the result. In this view, the states of the Pacific Northwest really pop up, and New York dims relative to its by-area showing. The contrast between Figure 11.6 and Figure 11.7 is effectively reflecting population density: large, sparsely-populated states26 show up more prominently on the per-capita map than the per-area map.
    Finally, for completeness, we look at the capacity factors of hydroelectric installations, by state. The total installed capacity in the database used for these plots is 77.6 GW spread among 1,317 dams, while producing an annual average of 28.1 GW-corresponding to an overall capacity factor of 0.36. Figure 11.8 shows how this distributes around the country. Since the Pacific Northwest dominates in installed hydroelectric power, it largely determines the overall capacity factor. Iowa stands out as having a high capacity factor, but only has 0.153 GW of installed capacity.27 Contrast this to Washington, having an installation capacity of 20.7 GW.28

    11.4 Global Hydropower
    This section provides a brief snapshot of hydroelectric production glob- ally, which we saw at the end of Section 11.2.1 amounts to 477 GW. Figure 11.9 shows which countries have the most hydroelectricity, the corre- sponding numbers appearing in Table 11.2-including the percentage of electricity derived from hydroelectric sources within the country. Notice that Norway, Venezuela, Brazil, and Canada derive more than half their electricity demand from hydroelectricity. Keep in mind that electricity is not the whole energy story for a country, as Fig. 7.2 (p. 105) made clear.

   11.5 Upshot: Pros and Cons of Hydro
   The two lists below provide some pros and cons to hydroelectric power that are relevant to our assessment of its value to our mix of renewable energy options. First, the positive attributes:
   2022 T. W. Murphy, Jr.; Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International Lic.; Freely available at: https://escholarship.org/uc/energy_ambitions.► Natural source, solar-driven, without waste products or pollu- tion;29
   ► Technologically simple, therefore straightforward to implement and maintain;
   ► High efficiency, turning 90% of available energy into useful elec- tricity;
   ▸ Good baseline of steady power over daily timescales;
   Life-cycle CO2 emissions only 4% that of traditional fossil fuel electricity [68];
   ► Facilities31 can last a century or longer;
   While not directly related to energy, dams can provide flood control and reliable water supplies.
   And some of the downsides that may discourage further development:
   ► Silt can build up behind dams displacing the reservoir, eventually rendering them useless and dangerous;
   ► Requires the semi-permanent flooding of an ecological habitat, of varying quality and value;
   ‣ Seasonal variability of available power, often by a factor of ten;
   Defunct or poorly maintained facilities represent a dam-burst danger to downstream residents;
   Blocks salmon runs and impacts the health of both oceanic and forest ecosystems;
   ► As the distribution maps show, hydroelectric is not a viable option everywhere: the combination of terrain32 and rainfall is needed.
   On balance, our society has embraced hydroelectricity as a clean and reliable resource. One can view it as nature's low-hanging fruit, partly evidenced by how early it was adopted on a large scale. It is likely to remain an attractive form of energy as we face increasing pressures to migrate away from carbon-based fuels.33 It will not, however, be able to provide an avenue for wholesale replacement of fossil fuels given its limited scale and electric-only nature. Only if our overall energy demand is reduced substantially will it form a large fraction of our portfolio.

   How much net gravitational potential energy was given to the box from the start to the end of the process?
4. A standard AA battery cell stores about 13.5 kJ of energy. At a mass of 23 g each, how high would you have to lift the battery to get the same amount of gravitational potential energy?
5. A gallon of gasoline contains about 130 MJ of chemical energy at a mass of around 3 kg. How high would you have to lift the gallon of gasoline to get the same amount of gravitational potential energy? Compare the result to the radius of the earth.
6. Problem 5 used one gallon of gasoline to compute the equivalent height for gravitational potential energy. Does the result depend on what volume of gasoline we selected? Make an airtight argument as to why or why not. Solving symbolically36 may be a helpful route-but not the only one.
7. A typical American household uses approximately 30 kWh per day of electricity. Convert this to Joules and then imagine building a water tank 10.8 m above the house37 to supply one day's worth of electricity.38 How much mass of water is this, in kg? At a density of 1,000 kg/m3, what is the volume in cubic meters, and what is the side length of a cube39 having this volume? Take a moment to visualize (or sketch) this arrangement.
8. The biggest hydroelectric installation in the U.S. is the Grand Coulee dam on the Columbia River. The enormous flow rate reaches its maximum at 4,300 m3/s, and the dam (reservoir) height is 168 m. At an efficiency of 90%, at what rate is this dam capable of producing hydroelectric power (in GW40)? Don't forget the density of water and that g≈ 10 m/s2.
9. The Hoover Dam (also called Boulder Dam) on the Colorado River is rated at 2.08 GW when the flow is at its maximum rate of 1,280 m3/s. How high is the reservoir if the efficiency of the installation is 90%?
10. A dam 50 meters high is constructed on a river and is delivering 180 MW at some moment in time. What is the flow rate of water, in cubic meters per second, if the facility converts gravitational potential energy into electricity at 90% efficiency?
11. A hydroelectric facility is built to deliver a peak power of 1 GW, which it manages to do for three months of the year during the spring snow-melt. But for three months in summer, it drops to 700 MW, then 500 MW for three months in fall. In winter, it drops way down to 200 MW for three months. Using the concept of the capacity factor (Definition 11.2.1), what is the annual average capacity factor for this facility?

12. While the Chief Joseph Dam on the Columbia River can generate as much as 2.62 GW (2.62 x 109 W) of power at full flow, the river does not always run at full flow. The average annual production is 10.7 TWh per year (10.7 x 1012 Wh/yr). What is the capacity factor of the dam: the amount delivered vs. the amount if running at 100% capacity the whole year?
13. The Robert Moses Niagara dam in New York is rated at 2,429 MW41 and has a high capacity factor of 0.633. How many kWh does it produce in an average day, and how many homes would this serve at the national average of 30 kWh/day?
14. The Robert Moses Niagara dam from Problem 13 is 30 m high. What is the peak flow rate, in m3/s, if it can produce full capacity power (2.43 GW electrical output) while converting gravitational potential energy to electricity at 90% efficiency?
15. It takes 2,250 J to evaporate each gram of water, while only taking about 330 J to raise the temperature of water from room temperature to the boiling point. If it takes 10 minutes to bring a pot of water from room temperature to boiling, how much additional time will it take to boil off (evaporate) all the water if injecting energy at the same rate the whole time?
16. Starting at 44,000 TW of solar input to the hydrologic cycle, par- allel the development in Section 11.2.1 by computing the power remaining at each stage42 if, for each gram of water:
    a) water is evaporated and lifted to 5 km height;4
    .43
    b) 30% of the water falls on land where collection is possible; c) the typical land height is 800 m;
    d) only 20% of the water makes it to dammable locations;
    e) only 50 m of height (of the original 800 m average) is left for
    the dam.
    By this analysis, how much hydroelectric power is theoretically possible, globally?
17. Fig. 10.1 (p. 167) indicated that about 44,000 TW globally goes into evaporating water. We can turn this into an estimate of how much rain we expect per year, on average. The simplest way to do this is to think of a single square meter of ocean surface, receiving an average evaporation input power of 120 W.44 Each millimeter of of water depth across our square meter has a volume of 1 L, or a mass of 1 kg. At a steady input of 120 W,45 how many millimeters of water are drawn off in a year? That same amount will come back down somewhere as precipitation.

    12 Wind Energy
    Wind energy has made significant inroads for electricity production in the U.S. and globally. Today, the U.S. gets about 2.5% of its energy (and 6.5% of electricity) from wind. Globally, wind accounts for about 2.6% of energy, or 4.8% of electrical production (Table 7.2; p. 107).
    The basic technology of harnessing wind power is rather old, powering ships, milling operations, and water pumps for centuries. Today, the predominant use of wind drives generators to make electricity.
    Just as hydroelectric power is related to the very basic form of grav- itational potential energy, wind is connected to another simple and easy-to-understand form: kinetic energy. This chapter first develops familiarity with kinetic energy, then explores how we get energy from wind, how much we get, and future prospects.
    12.1 Kinetic Energy
    An object in motion carries kinetic energy equal to one-half its mass times the velocity squared.

    Example 12.1.1 A 70 kg person walking at a brisk 2 m/s would have a kinetic energy of 140 J.
    Pushing a 50 kg ice skater from rest at a power of 75 W for 3 seconds would impart 225 J of kinetic energy, resulting in a speed of 3 m/s.
    For examples like these, framed as state- ments and not questions, you can practice solving several types of problems by cov- ering up one number and then solving for it using still-available information. So they provide several examples in one!

    Often, we use energy sources to deliver kinetic energy, as in moving planes, trains and automobiles.
    Example 12.1.2 A 1,500 kg car moving at freeway speeds (30 m/s) has a kinetic energy around 675 kJ.
    Getting up to this speed from rest in 5 seconds would require a power of 135 kW,1 equating to 180 horsepower.2
    But we can also go the other direction and convert kinetic energy into different forms of energy3 for versatile use. Most commonly, we turn kinetic energy into electrical potential energy (a voltage) that can drive a circuit. At this point, the energy can be used to toast a bagel, charge a phone, or wash clothes.
    The method for converting kinetic energy into electricity is usually accomplished by transferring kinetic energy in a moving fluid into rotation of a shaft by way of a turbine-essentially fan blades. The spinning shaft then turns an electric generator, which consists of the relative motion between magnets and coils of wire, and is essentially the same construction/concept as an electric motor run in reverse.
    Hydroelectric installations do the same thing-turning a shaft via blades of a turbine—even though we framed the energy source as one of gravitational potential energy. Within the dam's turbine, the water acquires kinetic energy as it flows from the reservoir to the outlet. Wind energy acts in much the same way, converting kinetic energy in the moving air into rotational motion of a fan/turbine whose shaft is connected to a generator located behind the blades.
    12.2 Wind Energy
    It is tempting to think of air as "empty" space, but at sea level air has a density of 1.25 kg per cubic meter (Pair≈ 1.25 kg/m3). Let this sink in visually: imagine a cubic meter sitting next to you (as in Figure 12.1). The air within has a mass of 1.25 kg (about 2.75 lb). Now draw a square meter on the ground either literally or in your imagination. The many kilometers of air extending vertically over the top of that square meter has a mass of ~10,000 kg! For context, figure out how many cars that would be (typ. 1,500 kg ea.), or what kind of animal would be this
    massive.
    What this means is that air in motion can carry a significant amount of kinetic energy, since neither its mass nor velocity are zero. If the entire earth's atmosphere moved at 5 m/s-a noticeable breeze-at a total mass of 5 x 1018 kg, we'd have 6 x 1019 J of kinetic energy in air currents. If we somehow pulled all this energy out of the air-stopping its motion entirely we might expect the atmosphere to revive its normal wind

    patterns over the course of 24 hours: a full day of the driving solar input around the globe. The associated power works out to 700 TW. Notice that the value for wind in Table 10.2 (p. 168) is pretty-darned close to this, at 900 TW. As the margin note indicates, we should be pleased to get within a factor of two for so little work and very off-the-cuff assumptions about global average air speed (see Box 12.1 for related thoughts). Figure 12.2 shows the annual average wind velocity at a height of 80 m (typical wind turbine height) for the U.S. Note that the 5 m/s we used above falls comfortably within the 4-8 m/s range seen in the map.

Box 12.1: The Value of Estimation/Checking
Calculations like the one above offer a way to see if something at least checks out and seems plausible. If we had found that the whole atmosphere would have to be moving at 50 m/s to get the 900 TW figure in Table 10.2 (p. 168), we would suspect a problem, and either distrust the 900 TW number-seeking another source to confirm or re-evaluate our own understanding. If we could get to 900 TW by only having wind speeds of 0.1 m/s, we would also have cause for skepticism. When crude estimates of this type land in the general vicinity of a number we see in a table, we can at least be assured that the number is not outlandish, and that our basic understanding of the phenomenon is okay. Checking understanding against presented data is excellent practice!
But we can't capture the entire atmospheric wind, because doing so would require wind turbines throughout the volume, up to 10 km high! In fact, some estimates [70] of practical global wind installations come in as low as 1 TW-well below our 18 TW demand. Wind alone is unlikely

12.2.1 Wind Turbines
To understand practically-available energy, we back up and consider how much air hits a wind turbine whose rotor diameter is R. Figure 12.3 illustrates the concept. If the wind speed is v, the air travels a distance vAt in time interval At.?
9: We can pick any value for At: a long interval makes a very long cylinder, while a small At results in a short, stubby cylinder. In the end, the value we chose for At will cancel out, so as not to matter.
R
VɅt
Cylinder volume: лR2νAt
The cross-sectional area of the wind turbine (rotor) is defined as the area swept out by the blades, so лR2. Thus the volume of the cylinder of air interacting with the turbine over time interval At is the "base" (circular) area of the cylinder times its "height" (straight length, vAt), or V = nR2ʊAt. We know the density of the air,10 so the mass of the cylinder is m = PairV = Pair R2vAt. The kinetic energy contained in this cylinder of air is therefore K.E. = m2 = Pair 7R23 At. Now let's get rid of that pesky At. Think for a moment what happens if we divide both sides by At: it will definitely get rid of the At on the right-hand-side, but what does the left-hand side mean: energy over time? Hopefully, this is familiar by now as the concept of power.

Notice that the delivered power scales, sensibly, with the area of the wind turbine's blade path, but more importantly and perhaps surprisingly as the velocity cubed (Table 12.1). The cubed part should make you sit

up straight: that's a very strong function of velocity! It means that if the wind changes from a gentle 5 m/s to a brisk 10 m/s, the power available goes up by a factor of 8. A strong wind at 20 m/s has 64 times as much power as the 5 m/s breeze.11 We can understand the three powers of velocity thusly: two powers come from kinetic energy, and one from the length of the cylinder. As wind speed increases, not only does the oncoming air have more kinetic energy per fixed volume, but also a larger volume encounters the turbine in a given time.
Setting & = 1 in Eq. 12.2 corresponds to the total power present in the wind. But we can't be greedy and grab all of it. In fact, if we did, it would mean stopping the air at the wind turbine: pulling out all the kinetic energy means no velocity is left. If we did this, newly arriving air would divert around the stopped mass of air, and the turbine would no longer have access to oncoming energy. The theory has all been worked out:12 a turbine is limited to ε ≤ 16/27 (59%) of the available energy, known as the Betz limit [72]. This is not a technological limitation, but comes from the physics of fluid flow. A second consideration enters for low-speed rotor motion, known as the Glauert limit [73], resulting in diminishing efficiency as wind speed drops.

Figure 12.4 shows these theoretical limits, along with design limits from various rotor configurations. Curves reflect an optimum rotor speed for each design: speeding up produces more generator output until it gets fast enough that air drag on the blades starts to dominate. The most common modern turbine is the 3-blade design,13 able to get roughly 50% of the energy out of the wind. Notice that the tip speed can be quite high: 6-8 times the wind speed. This can be quite alarming to birds in the area, whose cruising speed is nearer wind speed, and they
Figure 12.4: Theoretical and practical wind turbine efficiencies (e, or cp in the plot), for various designs. The parameter A is the ratio of tip speed to wind speed: higher A means a faster tip speed [74]. All designs must be below the Betz limit (horizontal line near top). At slower speeds, the Glauert limit confines performance to occupy the region to the right of the curve marked 2. Each of the 7 designs shown have arched curves, achieving maximum efficiency at a particular tip speed. Too slow, and the turbine is not transmitting much energy; too fast and drag/friction begins to dominate. Adapted from ©2010 WIT Press.
13: Not only is the three-blade design the most efficient, its lower tip speed is less dangerous than for 2 or 1-blade designs, according to Figure 12.4.

have never met something so fast before. For a modern derivation of the Betz limit and how efficiency depends on tip speed, see [71]. The largest turbines having 150 m diameter rotors are rated for up to 10 MW of electrical power production.
Example 12.2.1 How much power could you expect a small (4 m diameter) 3-blade wind turbine situated atop your house to deliver in a respectable 5 m/s breeze?
The radius is 2 m and we'll pick a middle-of-the-road efficiency of 45%; P=0.45
0.45. (1.25 kg/m3) 7 (2m)2. (5 m/s)3 comes to about 450 W 14
Besides the limit on how much power can be pulled out of the air by a single turbine, we also find limits on how densely they may be populated in a given area: how much space is required between turbines so that one does not disrupt the other. Obviously, it would not serve to put one turbine directly behind another, as they would at best split the available power arriving as wind. Even side by side, it is best to leave room between windmills so that additional rows are not deprived of wind power. A rule of thumb is to separate turbines by at least 5-8 diameters side-to-side, and 7-15 diameters15 along the (prevailing) wind direction. For the sake of illustration, Figure 12.5 shows a spacing on the denser side of the range, but otherwise we adopt the more recent recommendations and use 8 diameters side-to-side and 15 diameters deep [75]. This works out to a 0.65% "fill factor," meaning that 0.65% of the land area contains an associated rotor cross section."

wind is not always blowing, and its speed varies over wide ranges. this sense, wind is an intermittent power source. Just as for hydroelectric installations, wind resources are characterized by a regionally-dependent capacity factor, which is the ratio of energy delivered to what would have been delivered if the generation facility operated at full capacity at all times. Typical capacity factors for wind in the U.S.18 are around 33%, and Figure 12.6 provides a visual sense for how this manifests in the real world: pretty erratic.

For very low wind speeds,19 wind turbines do not have enough wind to turn at all and sit still at zero output. Furthermore, a turbine is rated at some maximum power output, which occurs at some moderately high wind speed,20 beyond which the generator risks damage-like "redlining" a car's engine. When the wind climbs above this maximum- rated speed, the turbine is pegged at its maximum power-no longer following a v3 relation and deliberately twists its blades21 to be less efficient as the wind speed grows so that it maintains constant (maximum) power output. When the wind speed becomes large enough to endanger the turbine, it will twist its blades parallel to the wind to allow the air to pass without turning the rotor at all, so that it no longer spins while it "rides out" the high winds.22
18: Capacity factors for wind are smaller than for hydroelectricity due to wind being more variable than river flow.

Global wind installations are rising rapidly, currently (as of 2020) above 600 GW of installed capacity.23 Table 12.2 lists the major players, in terms of installed capacity, average generation, fraction of total energy, capacity factor, and share of global wind generation. The amount of wind energy in each country depends on a combination of how much wind is available in the country, how fast electricity demand is growing, electrical infrastructure, and political interest in renewable energies.
23: A small fraction of this is realized, due to the capacity factor.
24: To compare wind to total energy, we follow the thermal equivalent convention discussed for Table 10.3 (p. 170)
Table 12.2: Global wind installations in 2018 [78-84]. The top six countries capture 85% of the global total.

4 6 Wind generation (GW)
In 2018, the U.S. had about 94 GW of installed wind capability.25 This number has recently surpassed hydroelectric installed capacity (about 80 GW). Both are impacted by capacity factors, which for wind averages 33% in the U.S., while hydropower is just over 40%. The net effect is that the generation for the two is pretty comparable.26 Where is the wind power in the U.S. installed? Figure 12.8 shows that Texas wins, at 8.7 GW. Oklahoma is a distant second at 3.2 GW, Iowa at 2.5 GW. California is in fifth place at 1.6 GW.
Figure 12.8: Wind power by state, in terms of average generation, in GW, in 2018. The color scale may seem unhelpful, but the unavoidable truth is that many states don't have a lot going on, and Texas is so dom- inant as to render other states almost in- significant. A logarithmic color scale could help, but then the important lesson on the gross disparity might go unappreciated.

Figure 12.9: Average wind power by state, divided by state area to indicate a density of the developed resource, in milliwatts per square meter (based on 2018 data). We might expect some resemblance to Figure 12.2, based on where the resource is most favorable.
Following the flow we used in Sec. 11.3 (p. 178), we show wind generation as a function of area (Figure 12.9), to get a sense for how concentrated the installations are. Oklahoma and Iowa jump in front of Texas by this measure. Texas has more total generation than all others, but is a very large state in terms of area. Iowa, for instance produces about 30% as much wind power as Texas, but at only 20% the size. The numbers, reaching about 0.017 W/m2 are a bit smaller than those for hydroelectricity, where two states exceeded this value. We can compare these numbers to the 0.2 W/m2 fully-developed potential we estimated in the paragraph following Eq. 12.3 to conclude that in principle we could expand wind by a large factor.28

Next, we look at wind generation per capita in states, in Figure 12.10. Now North Dakota blows away the rest, at 1.6 kW by four states at about half of this value. We can put this in context by noting that the average power consumption in the U.S. per capita is around 10 kW.
Finally, Figure 12.11 shows wind capacity factors, indicating where the wind is most reliable. It peaks around 41% in Kansas, but all of the plains states in general do well. The southeastern U.S. has almost no wind development,29 as is evident in any one of these figures.

12.4 Upshot: Wind is not Overblown
Wind has surged tremendously in the last decade (Fig. 7.5; p. 108), proving to be an economically viable and competitive resource. But how much could we expect to get from wind?
Putting a few of the previous results together, If the entire contiguous U.S. (area ~1013 m2) were developed for wind at an estimated power density of 0.2 W/m2-which was based on a 5 m/s average wind speed-and a capacity factor of 33%, the U.S. could theoretically produce 0.7 TW30 from wind-roughly 20 times what is produced today. We should take this crude estimate as an extreme upper end, since it is inconceivable that we would develop wind so fully as to never be more than a few hundred meters- -a few rotor diameters-away from a wind turbine, no matter where we go. Also, many areas are sub-threshold and would not support investment in wind development.
Even so, the inflated 0.7 TW estimate falls short of the current 3.3 TW energy demand in the U.S., has major intermittency problems, and is not in a form that can be well-used in all sectors, like transportation and industrial processing. While wind alone cannot replace fossil fuels at the current level of demand, it can doubtless be a significant contributor.
Globally, estimates for wind potential tend to be in the few-terawatt range, though can be as low as 1 TW for a number of practical reasons [70]. As was the case for hydroelectricity, wind is a viable player in the renewables mix, but is unable to shoulder the entire load.
Wind energy is not free of environmental concerns, disturbing landscapes and habitats. Its impact on birds31 and bats is most worrisome, as the rotors move far faster than anything to which the wildlife is habituated. Still, compared to the environmental toll from fossil fuels, it is fairly clean similar to the impact of hydroelectric power.
A pros and cons list will help summarize. First, the positive attributes:
► Wind is replenished on the planet daily by solar illumination;
30: We're fudging things a bit here for the sake of simplicity. If turbines are built for 12 m/s, the capacity factor already has some averaging built in, so using 5 m/s and a capacity factor of 0.33 is unfair. On the other hand, much of the country spends substantial time below the cut-in speed for turbines, and the cruel cubic function of velocity greatly suppresses much of the land area as impractical for wind development. So the approach is a compromise that might balance out reasonably.

► Harnessing wind is relatively low-tech and straightforward; Wind has decent efficiency-typically 40-50%-in extracting en- ergy from the oncoming wind;
Life-cycle CO2 emissions for wind is only 2% that of traditional fossil fuel electricity [68];
Growth in the wind sector points to economic viability;
▸ Wind is able to scale up to cover a meaningful fraction of energy
demand.
And the downsides:
Wind is intermittent: power when nature allows, not when people demand;
Wind is regionally variable: many places do not produce enough wind to support development;
▸ Wind can cause environmental disruption to habitats especially
dangerous to birds and bats;
Esthetic objections to noise and degradation of scenery hamper expansion.

   2 m/s. How much kinetic energy is this?
2. A hard slap might consist of about 1 kg of mass moving at 10 m/s. How much kinetic energy is this, and how much warmer would 10 g of skin33 get if the skin has the heat capacity properties of water, as in the definition of a calorie (Sec. 5.5; p. 73 and Sec. 6.2; p. 85 are relevant)?
3. A 10 kg bowling ball falls from a height of 5 m. Using the convenient g≈ 10 m/s2, how much gravitational potential energy does it have?

5. Thermal energy is just randomized kinetic energy on a microscopic scale. To gain some insight into this, consider one liter (1 kg) of water, and figure out how much energy it would take to heat it from absolute zero temperature37 to 300 K assuming that the definition of the calorie (Sec. 5.5; p. 73) applies across this entire range.

6. A typical house may have a floor area around 150 m2 (1,600 square feet). If the floor-to-ceiling distance is typically 2.5 m, how much mass is in the air within the house? Could you lift this much mass if handed to you as bags of rocks?
7. Atmospheric pressure is about 105 N/m2, meaning that a 100,000 N weight of air-corresponding to a mass of 10,000 kg-sits atop very square meter of the ground (at or near sea level). If the air density were constant at 1.25 kg/m3-rather than decreasing with height as it actually does how high would the atmosphere extend to result in this weight (mass)?
8. Comparing the pale green region in the southeastern U.S. to the purple region of the plains states in Figure 12.2, how much more power would we expect out of the same rotor placed in the plains than in the southeast (by what factor is it bigger in the plains)?
9. How much more powerful is a hurricane-strength wind of 50 m/s

10. How much power would a moderate-sized 50%-efficient wind turbine produce whose radius is 10 m at wind speeds of 5 m/s, 10 m/s, 15 m/s, and 20 m/s? Express the answers in kW or MW, depending on what is most natural.
11. The Betz limit says that we get to keep no more than 59% of the available wind power. If 59% of the kinetic energy in a lump of air moving at speed 38 v is removed, how fast is it going afterwards,3 as a fraction of the original speed?

14. Compare the tip speed of a three-blade turbine operating at its optimal efficiency (as per Figure 12.4) in a moderate wind of 7 m/s to typical freeway driving speeds in the same units.
15. Traveling down the road, you carefully watch a three-bladed wind turbine, determining that it takes two seconds to make a full revolution. Assuming it's operating near the peak of its efficiency curve11 according to Figure 12.4, how fast do you infer the wind speed to be if the blade length+2 appears to be 15 m long?

17. In a way similar to Figure 12.5, replicate the statement in the text that the fraction of land covered per rotor area is 0.65% if turbines are separated by 15 rotor diameters along one direction and 8 rotor diameters along the cross direction.
18. Check that the units of Eq. 12.343 indeed are equivalent to Watts

19. Provide a clear explanation of why the area under the blue curve in Figure 12.6 compared to the area of the whole rectangular box is an appropriate way to assess the capacity factor of the depicted wind farm?
20. What capacity factor would you estimate for the wind farm per- formance depicted in Figure 12.6? In other words, what is the approximate area under the curve compared to the entire box area, as explored in Problem 19? An approximate answer is fine.
21. Referring to Figure 12.7, examine performance at 5 m/s and at 10 m/s, picking a representative power for each in the middle of the cluster of black points, and assigning a power value from the left-hand axis. What is the ratio of

22. Figure 12.7 surprisingly has all the information required to deduce the rotor diameter! The turbine appears to produce 1,400 kW when the wind velocity is 10 m/s, and we also know it appears to operate at ε = 0.44. What is the rotor diameter?
23. Considering that wind turbines are rated for the maximum- tolerable wind speed around 12 m/s, and tend to operate at about 30% capacity factor, how much average power44 would a 100 m diameter turbine operating at 45% efficiency be expected to produce?

    13 Solar Energy
    Now we come to the main attraction. As we saw in Chapter 10, all of the strictly renewable energy options are ultimately derived from the sun. The two resources of the last two chapters-hydroelectricity and wind-represent tiny crumbs of the overall solar input to the planet.
    Practically speaking, it is difficult to concoct ways to harness more than a few terawatts of power from hydroelectric or wind-based resources. Similar limitations apply to biologically-derived energy, geothermal, tidal, ocean currents, wave energy, etc. This may be worrisome consid- ering that human society currently demands 18 TW. Meanwhile, the sun delivers 83,000 TW to the earth's surface (Fig. 10.1; p. 167, Table 10.2; p. 168). That's almost 5,000 times more than the demand. By the numbers, then, the sun seems to offer all we might ever need. In fact, the quantitative imbalance is so extreme as to make one wonder why we would ever mess around doing anything else.
    Yet at present, the U.S. gets only about 0.9% of its energy from solar power, or 2.3% of its electricity. Similarly for the world, 1.2% of global energy is solar (2.1% of the electricity). It would seem to be vastly underutilized.
    This chapter explains the nature of solar energy, its potential for use, practical considerations, and looks at the state of installations. While most of the focus is on photovoltaic (PV) panels that directly generate electricity from light, solar thermal power generation is also covered.
    13.1 The Energy of Light
    Sec. 5.10 (p.79) introduced the basics of the energy of light. This section acts as a refresher and lays the foundation for the rest of the chapter.

    Light a form of electromagnetic radiation-is composed of photons— individual particles of energy each having a characteristic wavelength- what we might call color. Photons are such tiny quanta of energy that familiar environments are awash in unfathomably large numbers of them. A typical light bulb, for instance, emits quintillions1 of photons every second.
    Definition 13.1.1 The energy of a single photon, in various forms, is

    where h = 6.626 × 10-34 J. s (Planck's constant), and v is the frequency of the light in Hertz (Hz, or inverse seconds).
    The second form (hc/A) is useful, as we more commonly characterize the "color" of light by its wavelength, A. The speed of light, c≈ 3 x 108 m/s, connects frequency to wavelength via
    λν = c.
    (13.2)
    The third form in Definition 13.1.1 makes it easy to compute photon energy in Joules given the wavelength in microns.2 Visible light has a wavelength around 0.4–0.7 μm (violet-to-red), so a typical photon energy, at 0.5 μm, is about 4 x 10-19 J. It's a tiny number!
    Example 13.1.1 About how many photons strike a 0.4 m2 patch of sidewalk per second if the overhead sun is delivering 1,000 W/m2?
    For the visible light characteristic of sunlight, we can use a convenient wavelength of 0.5 μm, amounting to 4 × 10-19 J of energy per photon. The patch of sidewalk we describe receives light energy at a rate of 400 W or 400 J/s.3 How many 4 x 10-19 J photons does it take to amount to 400 J? Divide1 to get 1021.
    The final form in Definition 13.1.1 relates to the fact that photons fre- quently interact with electrons as we will see in Section 13.3, making it convenient to convert to another energy unit called the electron-volt, or eV (introduced in Sec. 5.9; p. 78). One electron volt is the energy it takes to move an electron through an electric potential of one Volt. The conversion is 1 eV = 1.602 × 10-19 J. For instance, the 0.5 μm (blue-green) photon we used in the previous example would have an energy around 2.5 eV.
    Why should we care about unthinkably small quantities of light? Three reasons come to mind:
1. Eq. 13.1 elucidates that bluer photons have higher energy than
   red photons, which is important to know;
   2: One micron, or micro-meter, abbreviated μm, is 10-6 m.
   3:
   0.4 m2 times 1,000 W/m2
   4: ... or try reasoning it out: 1019 of them would make 4 J, so we need 100x more
   5:... shorter wavelength

2. Individual photons interact with matter at the microscopic scale and are relevant to understanding solar photovoltaics and photo- synthesis;
3. It's how nature really works.
   13.2 The Planck Spectrum
   We should first understand where photons originate, which will help us understand how solar panels work and their limitations. Until recent technological advances, photons tended to come from thermal sources. It's true for the white-hot sun," and true for flame and incandescent light bulb filaments. Likewise, hot coals, electrical heating elements, and lava are all seen to glow. Physics tells us how such hot sources radiate, as covered by the next three equations. The first (with units) is:
   P = AσT4 (W).
   (13.3)
   We already saw this equation in the context of Earth's energy balance in Sections 1.3 and 9.2. It is called the Stefan-Boltzmann law, describing the total power (in W, or J/s) emitted from a surface whose area is A (in square meters) and temperature, T in Kelvin.8 The constant, o≈ 5.67 × 10-8 W/m2/K+ is called the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, and is easy to remember as 5-6-7-8.9

   Eq. 13.4 might look formidable, but only A and T are variable. It describes the Planck spectrum, otherwise known as the blackbody10 spectrum. For some temperature, T, this function specifies how much power is emitted at each wavelength, A. Three fundamental physical constants from key areas of physics make an appearance: c≈ 3 x 108 m/s is the familiar speed of light from relativity; h≈ 6.626 x 10-34 J. s is Planck's constant from quantum mechanics, and kB≈ 1.38 x 10-33 J. K is the Boltzmann constant of thermodynamics.11

   8: Recall that temperature in Kelvin is the temperature in Celsius plus 273 (273.15, technically).
   9: The Stefan-Boltzmann constant is actu- ally a witch's brew of more fundamental constants h (Planck's constant), c (speed of light), and KB (the Boltzmann constant) as
   2π5k/(15c2h3).

   10: The term blackbody effectively means a perfect emitter and absorber of thermal radiation.
   11: This last one may be more familiar to students in its chemistry form of the gas constant R = kB NA≈ 8.31J/K/mol, where NA≈ 6.022 × 1023 is Avogadro's number.
   Eq. 13.5 is called the Wien law and is a numerical solution identifying the peak of the blackbody spectrum as a function of temperature. Higher temperatures mean higher kinetic energies at a microscopic scale, so that higher-energy (shorter-wavelength) photons can be produced. This is why as objects get hotter, they move from red to white, and eventually to a blue tint.
   All this may seem overwhelming, but take a breath, then just look at Figure 13.1. Everything so far in this section is captured by Figure 13.1.

   The shape of each spectrum is a plot of the function in Eq. 13.4 for three different temperatures. If comparing output of Eq. 13.4 to Figure 13.1, be aware that the units have been manipulated to favor microns over meters.12
   Let's come at this again with numbers to help us make sense of things. Looking at the curve (spectrum) for 6,000 K, we will verify that each equation makes some sense.
   Example 13.2.1 First, Eq. 13.5 says that the wavelength where emission peaks should be about 2.898×10−3/6000 ≈ 0.483×10−6 m, or 0.483 μm.
   Now look at the graph to see that the peak of the blue curve is indeed just short of 0.5 μm, denoted by the red star at the top.
   Example 13.2.2 Let's now verify a point on the Planck spectrum, picking 6,000 K and 1 μm to see if Eq. 13.4 lands in the same spot as indicated in Figure 13.1.
   If we go through the laborious exercise of plugging in numbers to Eq. 13.4 for T = 6000 and A = 1 × 10-6 (1 μm), we find13 the overall outcome is 3.73 × 1013 W/m2 per meter of wavelength. Once we adjust by 10-6 for the units on the plot (see earlier margin note), we expect 0.373 x 108 W/m2 per micron.
   Indeed, the blue curve passes through this value at a wavelength of 1 μm, as indicated by the dotted line in Figure 13.1.

The shapes of the three curves (spectra) are described by Eq. 13.4, the star locations are found by Eq. 13.5, and the total power radiated, per square meter of surface is the area under each curve, as captured in Eq. 13.3. The dotted line relates to Example 13.2.2. Note the le8 factor on the vertical axis, meaning that the axis goes from 0 to 1.0 x 108 W/m2/μm.
   12: Eq. 13.4 uses units of meters for A, but Figure 13.1 uses microns (um, or 10-6 m) for convenience. Also, Eq. 13.4 delivers an answer in units of W/m2 per meter of wave- length, but for the plot we divided by 106 so it would be W/m2 per micron of wavelength. By taking care of this detail, the area under each curve in Figure 13.1 should match σT4 as in Eq. 13.3.
   13: Numerically, the numerator is 3.74 x 10-16, the denominator is 10-30, and the argument in the exponential is 2.4, so that the second fraction is 0.1.

   Example 13.2.3 Finally, to assess Eq. 13.3, we can crudely estimate the area under the blue curve by drawing a rectangle that we think has about the same total area. We put the top of the rectangle at the top of the blue curve and ask how wide it would need to be to approximately match the area under the blue curve.
   If we make it 0.5 μm wide, it seems too thin: the area is smaller than what's under the blue curve. 1.0 μμm wide seems like too much area. So we pick something in the middle like 0.75 μm (Figure 13.2).
   This choice makes the area about 1.0 x 108 W/m2/um (value at the top of the rectangle) times 0.75 um, coming to 7.5 x 107 W/m2. Since this is power per area, we make a minor rearrangement of Eq. 13.3 to P/A = σT1 and evaluate for T = 6000 K to find 7.35 x 107 W/m2. Hey, not bad! So it all hangs together.
   Now that we've batted the equations around a little bit, like a cat might do if given a new mouse toy, let's absorb some key takeaways. First, as the source gets hotter, the area under the curve14 increases drastically-as the fourth-power of T, according to Eq. 13.3. This is seen in Figure 13.1 in that going from 3,000 K to 6,000 K15 leads to a tremendous increase in
   area under the curve: 16 times, in fact.
   Second, as an object gets hotter, it emits at shorter wavelengths, going from red-hot to yellow-hot to white-hot. The sun, at 5,800 K, peaks at 0.5 μm, in the blue-green region. We don't see it as blue-green because it emits plenty of red light as well, making a blend. Notice how well the 6,000 K spectrum in Figure 13.1 covers the visible colors. A cooler star at 3,000 K has a red tint to it, since the 3,000 K spectrum (Figure 13.3) shows a marked red-heavy tilt: blue is not as well represented as red is. Conversely, a hot star at 10,000 K will have a blue tint to it, since it peaks around 0.3μm and has considerably more flux at the blue end of the spectrum than at the red end.
   Finally, it is worth absorbing the overall lesson that photons from a glowing source emerge as a distribution, spanning a wide range of wavelengths (colors). This will turn out to be important in understanding why solar panels have the efficiencies that they do.

   13.3 Photovoltaics
   We are now prepared to dig into how photovoltaic (PV) panels actually work, and what governs panel efficiency.16 The word "photovoltaic" can be loosely read as: volts from photons, or electricity from light.
   Various materials are used as the principal component in PV panels, but the vast majority are made of high-purity silicon, so we will speak in these terms alone. The basic physics will be the same for other materials as well. Getting too far into the weeds in describing the semiconductor

   physics is outside the scope of this course, but it is worth painting a general picture enough to appreciate how much we can expect to get out of a PV panel.

Figure 13.4 illustrates the basic scheme. The underlying idea is that adjoining two slabs of silicon into which small amounts of two kinds of impurities have been deliberately introduced17 that either contribute extra electrons (n-type, for negative charge donors) or create vacancies for electrons (p-type, for effective positive charge donors). Putting p- doped and n-doped materials together creates a junction1s exhibiting a contact potential. The result is that "donated" electrons right at the junction in the n-doped material decide to relocate across the junction to vacancies in the p-doped material, creating a wall of negative charge on the p-side of the junction and leaving behind "holes" (missing electrons) effectively creating positive charges1 on the n-side of the junction. In the region right around the junction20 an electric field is set up between the separated charges. Any electron wandering into this depletion region will be swept across the junction, across the contact potential, and will contribute to a current that is then driven around the external circuit to return to its p-side home.21 Figure 13.4 shows additional salient features that will be pointed out as the story develops below.
13.3.1 Theoretical Efficiency of Photovoltaics
We will now follow the fate of one photon as it encounters the photo- voltaic material. Doing so will expose the physical process of photo- voltaics and simultaneously track losses to elucidate efficiency expecta- tions.
The basic scheme is that a photon knocks an electron away from an atom in the PV cell, and this electron has some chance of being swept across the junction upon which it contributes to a useful current.22 The goal is to get an electron across the line. It is not unlike some sports where crossing a line is the goal, but many factors are lined up defending against successful attainment of this goal. Efficiency is related to the chance that a photon will produce a "win."
Figure 13.4: PV cell structure and function. A junction between n-doped and p-doped semiconductors sets up an electric field across the junction. If an electron promoted to the conduction band by an incoming pho- ton wanders into the junction, it is swept across (red arrow) and successfully con- tributes to current. Electrons do not con- tribute if created above the junction-as is more probable for blue photons that are not likely to penetrate as far. Electrons do not contribute to the external (useful) current if they recombine (fill a hole) before finding the junction (red "poof").
17: ... either during or after the semicon- ductor crystal growth; a process called "doping"
18: So-called p-n junctions form the basis of diodes and transistors.
19: When a (negatively-charged) electron leaves an otherwise neutral medium, the medium becomes more positively charged.
20: ... called the "depletion region," as elec- trons have been depleted from the portion of the n-side adjacent to the junction
21: Once it is "home," the electron will fill a vacancy created by a sun-liberated electron to end the journey.
22: Current is just flow of charge, and in this case is just movement of electrons through the external circuit.

A photon leaves the hot solar surface aimed right at a PV panel on Earth. The photon can be any "color," distributed according to the Planck spectrum23 in Figure 13.1. The most probable wavelength for a 5,800 K blackbody-according to Eq. 13.5-is ~0.5 μm, but it could reasonably be anywhere from 0.2-3 um. The atmosphere will knock out (absorb or scatter) most of the ultraviolet light before it reaches the panel, and some of the infrared light is absorbed in the atmosphere as well. But almost 75% of the energy24 makes it to the panel. What happens next depends on the wavelength.
First, we must understand something about the silicon material. The atoms in a typical silicon PV cell are arranged in an orderly lattice, grown as a single crystal. Expensive panels have mono-crystalline silicon, meaning that each 15 cm square cell comprising the panel is a thin slice of one giant crystal. Less expensive poly-crystalline (or multi-crystalline) panels have cells that are a patchwork25 of randomly-oriented crystals at the millimeter to centimeter scale. But microscopically, both types are orderly crystals. Silicon has four electrons in its valence shell (outermost shell), so that a "happy" silicon atom is home to a four-outer-electron family. These electrons are said to exist in the valence band.26 But provided a sufficient energy kick, an electron can leave home and enter the conduction band,27 where it can freely move through the crystal and can potentially contribute to an electric current, if it finds the junction. The threshold energy level to promote an electron from the valence to the conduction band is called the band gap,20 which for silicon is 1.1 eV (1.8 × 10-19 J).
28
Infrared photons at a wavelength of > 1.1 um have an energy of E < 1.1 eV,29 according to Eq. 13.1. The energy falls below the band gap of silicon, and as such is not capable of promoting an electron within the silicon from the valence band to the conduction band. These longer-wavelength photons sail right through the silicon crystal as if it were transparent glass. Since these photons are not absorbed, the part of the incident energy in the infrared beyond 1.1 μm is lost. For the solar spectrum, this amounts to 23%, and is portrayed in Figure 13.5.
For the 77% of sunlight whose photons are energetic enough to bump an electron into the conduction band,30 it's game-on, right? Well, not so fast literally. Photons whose energy is higher than 1.1 eV have more
energy
than is needed to lift the electron into the conduction band. It only takes 1.1 eV to promote the electron, so a blue-green photon at 0.5 μm (~ 2.5 eV) has an excess of about 1.4 eV. The lucky electron is not just lifted out, but is given a huge boost in the process, rocketing out of the atom. It's going too fast! It knocks into atoms in the crystal and generally shakes things up a bit before settling down. We call this heat, or thermal energy:31 its excess kinetic energy is transferred to vibrations (randomized kinetic energy of atoms) in the crystal lattice. The blue curve in Figure 13.5 reflects this loss: we get to keep all the energy at 1.1 μm (1.1 eV), thus the blue curve joins the overall black curve here.

23: The spectrum can be thought of as a probability distribution for photon wave- length, if picking out one photon.
24: This is roughly 1,000 W/m2 out of the 1,360 W/m2 incident at the top of the at- mosphere (the solar constant, which will be derived in Section 13.4).

Figure 13.5: Energy budget in silicon PV cell. The areas of the four regions repre- sent the fraction of the total incident energy going to each domain. All light at wave- lengths longer than 1.1 μm (infrared; 23%) passes through the silicon without being absorbed. The photons that are absorbed give excess kinetic energy to electrons, los- ing 33% of the incident energy as heat. This effect is progressively more pronounced the shorter the wavelength. Of the remaining 44%, about a quarter disappear as electrons "recombine" with vacancies (holes) in the silicon before getting a chance to contribute to a useful current by crossing the junction, leaving 32% as the maximum theoretical efficiency.
But as the wavelength gets shorter and the energy gets higher, a greater fraction is lost to heat. Overall, 33% of the incident photon energy is lost to heat as the boosted electrons rattle the crystal before being tamed.
Now we're down to 44% of the original incident energy in the form of conduction-promoted electrons that have shaken off their excess kinetic energy. But then here's the rub: electrons are dumb. They don't know which way to go to find the junction, so aimlessly bounce around the lattice, in a motion called a random walk.32 Some get lucky and wander into the junction, where they are swept across33 and contribute to external current. Others fall into an electron vacancy (a hole) in a process called recombination: game over.34 Roughly speaking, about three-quarters of the electrons get lucky by wandering into the junction before being swallowed by a hole. So of the 44% available, we keep 32% (called the Shockley-Queisser limit [86]).
.35
Another significant loss arises because some photons are absorbed in the very top layer above the junction, so that the resulting electrons do not have the opportunity to be swept across the junction to contribute to useful energy. The shorter the wavelength, the shallower the photon is likely to penetrate into the cell.36 Meanwhile, photons around 1 um are likely to penetrate deep-well past the junction-making it less likely that the liberated electrons will find the junction before settling into a new home (lattice site) via recombination. Figure 13.4 reflects this color-dependence, and also depicts one electron from the blue photon being generated above the junction, which will not have an opportunity to do useful work by crossing the junction.
In total, the basic physics of a PV cell is such that 20% efficiency is a reasonable expectation for practical implementations.37 Indeed, commercial silicon-based PV panels tend to be 15-20% efficient, not far from the theoretical maximum. This may seem like a low number, but don't be disappointed! Biology has only managed to achieve 6%

34: ... red "poof" in Figure 13.4
35: Naïvely, 50% are lucky and wander up to the junction, and 50% make the wrong choice and go down. But even those initially going down still have a chance to wander back up to the junction before time expires and they recombine, so that effectively 75% make it.
36: Any given photon has a probability distribution of being absorbed as a function of depth. Blue photons can penetrate deep, but are more likely to be absorbed near the front surface. A 1 μm photon can be absorbed near the front surface, but it is more likely to penetrate deeper into the silicon.
37: Fancy, very expensive multi-junction PV cells may be used for special applica- tions like in space, where size and weight are extremely important and cost is less of a limitation. These devices can reach efficien- cies approaching 50% by stacking multiple junctions at different band gaps, better uti- lizing light across the spectrum.
efficiency in the best-case photosynthesis (algae). PV technology beats that by a factor of three! And as we'll see in Section 13.6, the only thing higher efficiency really does besides driving up the price is it makes the footprint (area occupied) smaller for the same power delivery. But it's already small enough to comfortably fit on most roofs, so efficiency is not a chief limitation at this point.
top contact grids
13 Solar Energy

bottom contacts
Figure 13.6: PV panels (modules) are constructed of typically 18, 36, 54, or 72 cells in series, two of which are depicted here. Cells are usually ~15 cm squares layered exactly as depicted in Figure 13.4. The bottom sides are covered by a continuous metal contact and the tops host a fine grid of metal contacts that minimize blockage of incident sunlight. Each cell presents ~0.5 V, arranged in series to add up to tens of volts per panel. To accomplish this, the top grid of one cell is connected to the bottom contact on the next, all down the line.
PV panels are usually constructed of many individual PV cells wired in series, as depicted in Figure 13.6. Each cell delivers maximum power when it's at a voltage around 0.45 V, and cells are usually arranged in strings of 18, adding to about 8 V. Panels commonly have 2, 3, or 4 such strings of 18-thus 36, 54, or 72 cells total-becoming 16 V, 24 V, or 32 V devices at peak power. Figure 13.7 shows typical performance curves for a PV cell (or whole panel) operating in various light levels. Recalling from Eq. 5.2 (p. 77) that electrical power is current times voltage, the power put out by a PV panel can be found as the area of the rectangle formed from the origin to the operating point somewhere on the curve. The point that maximizes area (power) is shown in Figure 13.7 as the "maximum power point." A battery being charged might hold the panel to a lower voltage, whose corresponding rectangle has a smaller area, thus operating at less than the panel's maximum power.
One serious downside of panels is that because cells are wired in series, partial shading of a single cell limits the current the whole panel delivers to that of the weakest link in the chain. In other words, 17 of 18 cells in a chain might be in full sun, but if the shadow from a roof vent, chimney, or tree shades one cell and limits its current to 10% of its full value, the whole chain38 is knocked to 10%. Bypass diodes can isolate problem sections, but usually in chunks of 18-24 cells, so that the panel can still be seriously impaired by partial shading. Connecting panels in series also creates vulnerability to partial shadowing.
Box 13.1: Why Not Parallel?
Given the downsides of series connection of cells, why not connect cells in parallel-the only other option for connecting many cells together?

The maximum power point (mppt) is about 0.45 V for silicon, while the nominal design might be for 0.35 V so that a 36-cell panel is sized to charge a 12 V battery. Rectangle area is proportional to power delivered, since P = IV.

38:...because in series, each cell shares the same current
This problem is sometimes mitigated via micro-inverters: each panel has an inverter so that higher-voltage outputs are combined in parallel.

Series combination adds voltages, keeping the same common current. Parallel combination shares a common (low) voltage but adds cur- rents. The same power (P = IV) obtains either way. But two problems arise from a parallel combination of cells. First, the ~0.5 V voltage is too small to be useful for most devices. Second, the power lost in connecting wires scales as the square of current, so designing a system with a large current is asking for trouble.39
That said, PV installations often combine panels in both series and parallel-like 10 panels in series in parallel to another 10 in series. By this time, the voltage is plenty high to offset the losses.

39: Making things worse, the voltage drop in the lines is proportional to current, di- minishing an already small voltage to even less by the time it gets to its application.
13.4 Insolation
Let's start our journey from the physics principles we covered in Section 13.2. The sun's surface is a sweltering 5,770 K, meaning that it emits oT4≈ 6.3 x 107 W/m2 over its surface. The sun's radius is about 109 times that of the earth's,40 which itself is 6,378 km at the equator. Multiplying the radiation intensity by the area gives total power output: 4πRσт4≈ 3.82 × 1026 W. That's one bright bulb!
42
Sunlight spreads out uniformly into a sphere expanding from the sun. By the time it reaches Earth, the sphere has a radius equal to the Earth-Sun distance, which is reo = 1.496 x 1011 m.41 Spreading 3.82 × 1026 W over a sphere of area 47r computes to 1,360 W/m2. That's what we call the solar constant [4], and it's a number worth committing to memory.
Earth intercepts sunlight over the projected area presented to the sun: a disk of area R. Bright features like clouds and snow reflect the light back to space without being absorbed, and even darker surfaces reflect some of the light. In all, 29.3% of the incoming light is reflected, leaving 960 W/m2 absorbed by the R projected area of the planet. But now averaging the 960 W/m2 input over the 47R2 surface area of Earth cuts the number down by a factor of four,43 to 240 W/m2.
High latitude sites suffer more from low sun angles, and obviously cloudier locations will receive less sun at the surface. Taking weather into account, a decent number for the average amount of power from sunlight reaching the ground is about 200 W/m2. This is called insolation44-the "sol" part of the word stemming from solar.
40: Why this convoluted path? Context. Building from pieces we are more likely to know/remember better engages our un- derstanding and ownership of the material.
41:...150 million kilometers, or 1 AU
42: See: isn't it satisfying to know that the number comes from somewhere? It's not just a random fact, but connects to other pieces. That's what the earlier margin note meant about context.
See Fig. 9.6 (p. 144) for a visual example.
43: We can understand this factor of four as two separate factor-of-2 effects determining how much solar power a particular location receives: one is simply day vs. night: half the time the sun is not up. The other half relates to the fact that the sun is not always overhead, so the amount of light hitting each square meter of land is reduced when the sun's rays are slanting in at an angle.

Figure 13.9: Horizontal insolation for the U.S. for a flat plate facing directly upward. Native units for the graphic are in kWh/m2/day, the break-points between colors running from 4.0 to 5.75 kWh/m2/day in steps of 0.25. These values can be converted to W/m2 by mul- tiplying by 1,000 W/kW and dividing by 24 h/day. Annotations are added once in each color band (in black or yellow) to in- dicate the equivalent measure in W/m2 [87]. Alaska is not even close to scale. From NREL.
Figure 13.9 shows the variation of insolation across the U.S. The latitude effect is evident, but also weather/clouds make a mark, giving the southwest desert the highest solar potential. Even so, the variation from best to worst locations45 is not even a factor of two.

the sky near the equator, so panels there should lie flat.48 But at high northern latitudes, the sun is lower toward the southern horizon, so the panels should tilt up to best face the sun. Tilting at an angle equal to the latitude is the best compromise, as Figure 13.10 illustrates.

Tilting panels toward the equator at an angle equal to site latitude optimizes annual yield, and the results are shown in Figure 13.11. Note that the numbers in Figure 13.11 are not strictly insolations, since that's defined as what reaches flat ground. In this case, the area (square meters) is that of the panel, not of the land.
The fact that the numbers in Figure 13.11 are higher than in Figure 13.9 is not to say that the land offers more solar energy if the panels are tilted: just that an individual panel can get more light. But in this case, panels need to be spaced out to avoid shadowing,49 as Figure 13.12 illustrates.
Some applications need to track the sun, like those that concentrate solar power, and only work when the sun is not blocked by clouds.50 This brings us to Figure 13.13, showing the potential per square meter of collector (mirror or lens) used for the concentration (the topic of Section 13.8.2). The same pattern holds, in that the desert southwest dominates. But a look at the numbers indicates that the cloudier regions are not much better than just a flat panel facing upward (as is the case for Figure 13.9). In the southwest, where skies are often cloud-free, the boost can be

Stepping back, let's appreciate a few big-picture facets from these maps. First, numbers tend to be in the general neighborhood of 150-300 W/m2. Burn this range in-it's a useful context. Second, the variation from the most solar-intense places in the contiguous U.S. to the weakest areas 51 is not more than a factor of two on an annual basis. This is astounding. The Mojave desert in California and the rain-forest Olympic Peninsula in Washington would seem to be practically day vs. night with respect to solar illumination. But not so much: only a factor of two.52 Part of what this means is that if storage over annual timescales could be realized, solar power would become practical almost everywhere.53
Box 13.2: Hours of Full-Sun Equivalent
A useful take-away comes from the native units used in the three maps presented here: kWh/m2/day, as opposed to our preferred W/m2. Although they look different at a glance, kWh is a unit of energy, so kWh/day is a power, just like W. Since a kilowatt is 1,000 W and a day is 24 h, 1 kWh/day is 1,000 Wh/24 h = 41.67 W.54 So we can multiply 6 kWh/m2/day by 41.67 to get 250 W/m2.

The graphic is presented in units of kWh/m2/day, the break-points between colors running from 4.0 to 7.5 kWh/m2/day in steps of 0.5.

But the main purpose of this box is to point out the following. Full overhead sunshine bathes the ground in about 1,000 W/m2.55 So if you could contrive to keep the sun directly overhead for 5 hours, you'd get 5 kWh of solar energy for each square meter on the ground. Therefore, if your site is listed as getting 5 kWh/m2/day, it's the equivalent amount you'd get from 5 hours of direct overhead sun.56
What actually happens is that the day is longer than 5 hours, but for much of the day the sun is at a lower angle so that the panel is not directly illuminated, and weather can also interfere. This leads to a concept of full-sun-equivalent-hours. A site getting an annual average of 5.4 kWh/m2/day might be said to get 5.4 hours of full-sun-equivalent each day. It's a pretty useful metric.
Box 13.2 leads to a crucial bit of understanding on characterizing a PV system. Panels are rated on what they would deliver when illuminated by 1,000 W/m2 at a temperature of 25°C.57 So the measure in kWh/m2/day, or full-sun-equivalent hours tells you effectively what fraction of a day the panel will operate at its rated capacity.
Example 13.4.1 A 250 W panel at a location getting 4.8 kWh/m2/day, or 4.8 full-sun-equivalent hours, is basically operating at 250 W for 4.8 hours out of every 24, or 20% of the time. So the panel delivers an average power of 50 W, not 250 W.58
The 250 W rating is referred to as "peak" Watts, sometimes denoted 250 Wp. Panels are sold this way, and now cost about $0.50/Wp.
A 30-year study by the National Renewable Energy Lab [88] initiated in 1960 characterized solar potential across the U.S. and produced detailed statistics on what each location might expect to collect each month for panels in different orientations. Table 13.2 is a subset of the complete data for St. Louis, Missouri.59 All cases in Table 13.2 correspond to a panel facing south, at various tilts (including flat, at 0° and vertical at 90°; other tilts are relative to the site latitude of ≈ 39°). From this, we see that tilting the panel at the site latitude delivers an annual average of 4.8 kWh/m2/day, matching the graphic expectation from Figure 13.11. Also shown is the monthly breakdown and how different tilts translate to performance. We will visit this table again in Section 13.6 to help us establish an appropriate size for a residential installation.

55: It's 1,360 W/m2 at the top of the atmo- sphere, and the atmosphere blocks/scatters some of the wavelengths outside the visible part of the spectrum.
56: This equivalence relies on the conve- nient fact that full overhead sun is about 1,000 W/m2. It would not work otherwise.
57: The 1,000 W/m2 is reasonable, but a photovoltaic panel in full sun will be about 30-40°C hotter than its surroundings (it gets hot!), so it would have to be very cold outside to meet the specification of 25°C panel temperature. Solar panel performance wanes when hot, and will only reach 85-90% of rated capacity in typical conditions.
58: We would need to apply a de-rating of 0.85 to 0.9 to account for typical PV tem- peratures in the sun, bringing the panel to about 45 W average power.

13.5 The Incredible Solar Potential
The potential of sunlight can be assessed by pieces we have already seen. Multiplying the solar constant of 1,360 W/m2 by the projected area of Earth (R) and by 0.707 to account for the 29.3% reflection loss, we compute that Earth absorbs solar energy at a rate of 1.23 x 1017 W, or 123,000 TW (1 TW is 1012 W). Compared to the 18 TW societal scale, that's huge! Notice that the non-reflected entries back in Table 10.2 (p. 168) add60
to this same value.
Placing solar panels on just 10% of the land (itself 29% of Earth's surface
61
area) capturing the incoming energy at 15% efficiency would produce solar power at ~500 TW: about 25 times today's 18 TW usage rate. This, in turn, means that our current energy demand could be met by covering only 0.4% of land62 with photovoltaic panels: see Figure 13.8 for a visual representation of how much this is. Solar is the only currently-available resource that can come anywhere close to satisfying our current energy appetite.63 And it exceeds our demand by such a huge margin! We therefore have reason to be excited about solar energy: the raw numbers are great news, indeed.
So it seems like a done deal. Solar. Let's get started! Wait, why aren't we there yet?
Naturally, solar has some downsides. First, the cost. Panel cost has dropped to something like $0.50 or less per peak-Watt. To get 10 TW of delivered (average) power at typical locations getting 20% capacity factor64 would require about 50 TWp (Example 13.4.1 defines Wp), costing 25 trillion dollars. The cost of other necessary components and installation double the cost for utility-scale projects [89], bringing the cost to $50 trillion.65 The global annual economy is not quite twice this. To outfit the world with the requisite number of panels would take about 60% of the economy for a year, or 6% over 10 years, or 1.5% continuously.66 For comparison, the world goes through 30 billion barrels of oil each year at a cost of $50/bbl, meaning $1.5 trillion per year. Installing enough panels to fully satisfy demand would cost three-decades-worth of the entire global petroleum budget. So it's not going to happen fast. To put things on a personal scale, Americans use power at a rate of 10,000 W. To cover this, we would need about 50 kWp of panel per person, costing $50k per person.67 When can we expect your payment?
Another daunting realization is that even though only 0.4% of the land is needed to match today's demand, this is comparable to the amount of area currently covered by roads and buildings. A road trip across the country conveys a sense for how vast (and boring) all that pavement can be. And pavement is a fancy form of dirt. It is true that PV panels are also an ultra-pure, ultra-fancy form of dirt. But it's a different level of high-tech. It becomes hard to fathom that much PV around the world.
60: 83,000 TW plus 40,000 TW absorbed by the surface and atmosphere, respectively
61: ... out of the 123,000 TW total
62: ...1/25 of the 10% starting point
63: As we have seen, global wind may be limited to a few TW, and global hydropower would be hard-pressed to reach 2 TW.
64: 20% of 24 hours corresponds to 4.8 full- sun-equivalent hours per day.
65: The cost over the ~40 year lifetime of the panels is already competitive with con- ventional means, but when fuel cost is zero, all the cost is up-front, which presents a significant barrier.
66: ... based on 40 year effort, at which point the first panels need replacing
67: A subtlety here is that most of the 10 kW Americans use presently is in thermal form (fossil fuels), at ~35% efficiency. For non- heating applications that can use electric- ity, solar has an advantage. On the other hand, mitigating intermittency via storage requires a larger PV installation by as much as a factor of two. For the purposes of a crude estimate, we'll call it even and say that 10 kW per capita from PV would cover the entire demand 100% of the time.

A major impediment to solar power is its intermittency. Figure 13.15 shows 31 days of solar capture, along with typical state-wide electricity demand. The two do not look very similar: not well matched. Demand is far more constant than the solar input, which is obviously zero at night. Even the peaks do not line up well, since demand is highest in the evening, well after solar input has faded away.

March/April date in 2020
Figure 13.15: Solar input (red) and electricity demand (blue) look nothing alike. Solar data from the author's home begins 31 March 2020, while demand is for California. Tick marks denote the start of each date, at midnight. April 22-27 are essentially perfect cloudless days, while the earlier part of the month had rainy periods. Note that even a very rainy day (April 10) provides some solar power (15% as much as a full-sun day). Intermittent clouds cause the "hair" seen on some days. The capacity factor for the month is 19%, while the perfect six days near the end perform at 27% capacity. From this, we infer that weather caused the yield to be 70% what it would have been had every day been cloudless.
Storage is required in order to mitigate the intermittency, allowing the choppy solar input to satisfy the demand curve of Figure 13.15. We don't have good solutions for seasonal storage,69 so a complete reliance on solar energy would necessitate over-building the system to handle months of low-sun conditions through winter (see the annual variation in Table 13.2), making it cost all that much more.
Finally, all energy is not equivalent and substitutable. Solar PV cannot power passenger airplanes or power our cars down the road real-time (only via storage).70 For all its potential, the hangups are serious enough that more than 60 years after the first demonstration of a photovoltaic cell, less than 1% of our energy derives from this ultra-abundant source.
69: It's not a matter of how long the energy is stored, but a matter of sufficient capacity to store enough excess energy in summer for use during the darker winter.
70: It is possible to build a solar-powered aircraft or car, but not airplanes and cars as we know them (see Box 13.3). We can consider such things to be "cute" demon- strations, rather than a viable path to sub- stitution.
Box 13.3: Why no Solar Planes?
Consider that full overhead sun delivers 1,000 W/m2. The top surface area of a typical commercial airplane (Boeing 737) is about 450 m2. If outfitted with the most expensive space-worthy multi-junction PV cells getting 50% efficiency, the plane would capture about 500 W/m2 and a total of 225 kW. Sounds like a lot! The problem is that a Boeing 737 spends about 7 MW while cruising (and more during the climb). We're shy by a factor of about 25, even in optimal"1 conditions! Any solar-powered airplane would be very light and very slow by air travel standards. See also Box 17.1 (p. 290) on the difficulty of battery-powered planes.
71: An airplane will not always have full overhead sun!
72: If your niece or nephew draws a solar plane in crayon, just smile, say it's very nice, put it on the refrigerator, and cry

Cars have a similar problem: a top area around 10 m2 equipped with the most expensive PV money can buy would get 5 kW, or less than 7 horsepower. That's about 20 times less powerful than typical cars, so again: light and slow.

13.6 Residential Solar Considerations
Despite these drawbacks, it can still make a lot of sense73 to invest in solar photovoltaics for the home. We'll explore sizing and cost in this section.
73: The author runs most of his house from an off-grid PV system he built: a solar en- thusiast when it comes down to it.
13.6.1 Configurations
A typical household uses much or most of its energy when the sun is not shining: lighting, cooking, evening entertainment, charging an electric vehicle, etc. To get around this, the system would need to have local storage,74 or be tied to the regional electrical grid so that excess production can be exported in the daytime and electricity produced by the utility used at night or when household demand exceeds solar production. The overwhelming majority of solar installations in the U.S. are grid tied, and very few mess with batteries, which can double the cost of a system and need replacement before the system has paid for itself in electricity bill savings.
Box 13.4: Disappointing Dependence
A disappointing surprise to many who "go solar" is that their house has no power when the electrical service to the house is disrupted— even in the light of day. A grid tied system needs the grid to operate. Safety concerns prohibit PV systems from continuing to energize a disabled grid.
Only "off-grid" battery systems continue to work in these scenarios, but then the disappointment shifts to the price tag, maintenance, and replacement of worn-out batteries after a few thousand cycles.
While a description of the components and practical workings are beyond the scope of this book, students might be interested in an article the author wrote after first getting started tinkering with PV systems [90].
13.6.2 Sizing and Cost
How large does an installation need to be? If the goal is to cover annual or monthly electricity use in a grid-tied system, the only two pieces of information needed are the typical electricity consumption in the

74: ... batteries: expensive, require mainte- nance, and periodic replacement

relevant period and the average solar input at that location for the period of interest.
The first can be surmised from electricity bills, usually giving a monthly total usage in kWh. We can get an approximate average scale from Fig. 7.2 (p. 105), which indicates that 42% of residential energy (11.9 qBtu per year) is from electricity. That's 5 qBtu, or 5.3 × 1018 J in one year (3.156 x 107 s), or 167 GW. Distributed among 130 million households in the U.S.,75 average household electricity consumption is 1,285 W. Applied over 24 hours, this makes for just over 30 kilowatt-hour (kWh) per day for an average household.76
The next piece is solar potential at the location of interest. We'll use the excerpted data from [88] for St. Louis, Missouri found in Table 13.2.
Example 13.6.1 Let's design a grid-tied PV system for an average U.S. household in an average" U.S. city (St. Louis). We'll orient the panels facing south and tilted to the site latitude (39°) and purchase PV panels at 18% efficiency (pretty typical).
78
Table 13.2 indicates that for this configuration we can expect an annual average of 4.8 kWh/m2/day of input. If we're shooting for 30 kWh per day, we would need 6.25 m2 of panel operating at 100% efficiency.
But 18% panels will require about 35 m2 of panel,79 which would be a square array about 6 meters on a side (about 20 feet) or a rectangle 5 by 7 meters, etc. The total area (400 square feet) is much smaller than a typical house footprint, so that's good news.
But panels are not marketed by the square meter. They are sold in terms of peak Watts: what the panel would deliver in 1,000 W/m2 sunlight (see Example 13.4.1). How do we convert? Two ways are instructive.
Example 13.6.2 In one method, we multiply the 35 square-meter area from Example 13.6.1 by 1,000 W/m2 and then by the PV efficiency (18% in this example) to get how much would be delivered: 6.3 kW.
Alternatively, we could adopt the interpretation of 4.8 kWh/m2/day as the equivalent full-sun hours operating at peak output (Box 13.2). To get our target 30 kWh in 4.8 hours of full-sun-equivalent, we would need to produce 6.25 kW for those 4.8 hours.80
We get the same answer either way, which is a good check.8
81
We should assume that the panels will not achieve their rated potential due to the facts that:
The 25°C specification is almost never realized for a PV panel in the sun: PV panels in the sun get hot, and less efficient as a result;
► The panels will get a little dirty;

The equipment that converts panel output to AC electricity is not 100% efficient.
So it's a good idea to bump the number up by 20% or so, and order a 7.5 kW PV system for the case under study. A typical full cost (panels, electrical converters, installation) lately runs just shy of $3 per peak Watt (Figure 13.16), which in this case brings the price tag to roughly $20k. If electricity costs $0.15 per kWh—approximately the national average each 30 kWh day costs $4.5, accumulating to $20k after 12 years. Federal and state incentives can make the payback time shorter.
What would these numbers become if trying to meet monthly instead of annual demands? December is usually the worst month for PV in the northern hemisphere, when the sun is lowest in the south, and the days are shortest. Table 13.2 backs this up, showing 3.1 kWh/m2/day for the chosen panel orientation in December. This is about two-thirds the annual average, so we would need to increase the size of the system (and thus cost and payback time) by a factor of 1.5 to produce enough in December.8
82
If sizing for an off-grid system, we need to factor in some inefficiency for battery charge/discharge and design for poorer months, so should increase by another factor of at least 1.5. The cost of batteries can be rather large, too. A good rule of thumb is to have at least three days of storage in the event of no solar input for several days during a stormy period. For our 30 kWh per day target, we would want about 100 kWh of storage. As an easy way to get a cost estimate for storage, the Tesla powerwall 2 is 13.5 kWh83 and costs about $7k apiece. If we follow along, the cost of the off-grid PV system for 30 kWh/day at an installation cost of $3/W will be 7500 W x 1.5 x 1.5 x $3≈ $50k for panels/installation plus $56k for batteries.84 Then the batteries may be in need of replacement every 10-15 years.85

If this seems rather alarming, don't worry-there's a trick to making it much more affordable/practical: don't demand 30 kWh per day! Even though we picked 30 kWh/day due to the fact that it is the average American electricity demand, it is a worthwhile challenges to seek ways to use far less energy than the average. Trying to make solar fit our present expectations may be the wrong approach. Also, expecting to get away from fossil fuels and have it be cheaper may be unrealistic.

13.7 Photovoltaic Installations
The Energy Information Administration's Electric Power Monthly (EPM) [85] provides detailed statistics on power generation in the U.S. Pho- tovoltaic data is available in the EPM's tables 1.17.B and 6.2.B. In the usual way, we first look at installed capacity, based on the actual average delivered power. Figure 13.17 shows the situation in the U.S. California is

rocking it! The average solar power in California was 4.3 GW in 2018, far ahead of the next biggest: North Carolina at 0.82 GW. For California, this is 13% of its electricity. But electricity production is 38% of all energy in the U.S., so we might say that California gets about 5% of all its energy from solar. This is far ahead of other states.87 The U.S. as a whole gets about 0.9% of its energy from solar.

PV density (mW/m2)
Next, we divide by area to get power density from photovoltaic installa- tions. A site having an insolation of 200 W/m2 and 15% efficient panels has access to 30 W/m2 of production capability (Table 13.1). Figure 13.18 shows how much we're actually getting. New Jersey has its moment in the sun, here. A few sites (NJ, MA) are pushing88 15 mW/m2, which is a factor of 2,000 lower than the full potential. What this says is that only 1/2,000 of the land (0.05%) is covered by solar panels. This sort-of makes sense, right?
On a per-population basis (Figure 13.19), Nevada shines brightest, at 180 W per person.89 The southwestern U.S. is doing well overall, as is North Carolina on this measure.
Finally, we look at capacity factor: how much was generated compared to installed capacity (Figure 13.20). We expect something like 20%, corresponding to 4.8 full-sun-equivalent hours per day. The best states top out at about 0.27, equating to about 6.5 full-sun-equivalent hours per day. States at higher latitude and/or having more clouds will do

Globally, two-thirds of the photovoltaic capacity is represented by five countries, shown in Table 13.3. Note that delivered power is significantly lower than installed capacity because of the low capacity factor for solar.
13.7.1 Pros and Cons of Photovoltaics
Before advancing to solar thermal generation, let's summarize the major advantages and disadvantages of solar photovoltaics. First, the good stuff:
PV taps into a super-abundant resource-the only renewable that has such a margin;

► PV technology has no moving parts or steam; panels are robust and last a long time;
► PV is one of the few resources that can fit on a rooftop and provide self-contained electricity generation;
► PV efficiency is rather good: close to theoretical expectations and much better than biology has managed at getting energy from sunlight;
► PV technology works well, and despite expense has been deployed on rooftops across the world;
Life-cycle CO2 emissions are 15 times smaller than that of tradi- tional fossil fuel electricity [68];
PV is often a good solution when utility electricity is far away.
And now the less attractive aspects:
► PV is intermittent, and not well-matched to energy demand; it would be hard to "balance" the electrical grid if too much of the input came from such an intermittent source, and storage is difficult;
► PV is still expensive90 relative to prevailing energy resources- especially important in terms of up-front cost;
Electricity alone is not well-suited to many of our current energy demands, like transportation and industrial heat/processing; Stand-alone operation requires batteries, at least doubling the cost and adding maintenance/replacement demands;
▸ Even partial shading can be disproportionally disruptive;
PV manufacturing involves environmentally unfriendly chemicals;
► PV deployment can harm habitats if installed in undeveloped
areas.

90: Cost has been a major barrier, but may cease to be so as prices fall further.
13.8 Solar Thermal
Photovoltaics (Section 13.3) convert sunlight directly into electricity, but this is not the only way to harness energy from the sun. Solar energy can also be used for heat. We'll first have a brief look at home heating, then turn to electricity generation from solar heat.
13.8.1 Passive Solar Heat
Full sun delivers something like 1,000 W/m2 at the earth's surface. Now imagine a window in a house intercepting 1.5 m2 of sunlight, in effect admitting 1,500 W into the home-like a space heater, and it's free! Depending on window construction, some of the infrared energy may be blocked, so maybe not all 1,000 W/m2 will make it inside, but a sizable portion will. Clever design has south-facing windows for receiving low-angle winter sun, but an overhang to keep out the high summer sun

(Figure 13.21). A dark and massive absorber91 inside the house capturing the heat can continue to provide warmth through the evening hours. The Passive House designs mentioned in the context of Box 6.1 (p. 87) attempt to maximize solar capture so that little active heating is required.

winter; low sun angle
summer; high sun angle
Figure 13.21: A well-designed house has thick walls, thick insulation, and double- paned windows. Even better, it can have south-facing windows that admit sunlight in the winter but not in the summer (the overhang shields the window). A large, dark thermal mass-stone or brick works well- can absorb energy and continue to release heat into the evening.
13.8.2 Solar Thermal Electricity
While 1,000 W/m2 is nice, the power is too diffuse to get anything very hot and create a large enough AT to allow the operation of an efficient heat engine (Sec. 6.4; p. 88). More complex arrangements can concentrate solar power-think of a magnifying glass-to heat up a liquid in pipes. Figure 13.22 shows an example of a parabolic reflector that can track the sun to concentrate light onto the energy-absorbing central pipe. This shape can be extruded along a long cylinder-a "trough"-following the pipe.

Figure 13.23: A common solar thermal power scheme uses parabolic "trough" reflectors to focus sunlight onto a central pipe, which carries oil that can be heated to very high temperatures for making steam to run a traditional electrical power plant very much like that of Fig. 6.2 (p. 90). Optional thermal storage can save heat for later use.
Figure 13.23 shows a schematic representation of a typical solar thermal (ST) collector, and a picture of one appears in Figure 13.24. A curved reflector tilts to track the sun, concentrating light onto a long pipe in

front of the reflector carrying a fluid (usually oil) that can be heated to a high temperature by the absorbed sunlight. The hot oil pipes can then be run through water to boil it and make steam, thereafter driving a traditional steam power plant. Such ST arrangements are sometimes called concentrated solar power (CSP). Another common variant-called a "power tower"-is shown in Figure 13.25, in which an array of steerable flat mirrors on the ground direct sunlight to the top of a central tower to make steam.
As for efficiency, solar thermal is at face value similar to PV: 15-20% is fairly typical. Broken down, roughly 50-75% of the available energy successfully transfers to the fluid, and then the heat engine delivers about 25-30% efficiency. But these numbers only apply if we count just the area of the reflective collector. Because they have to track the sun, and self-shadowing is to be avoided, only a small amount of the land area is occupied by the reflectors. Characterization of real facilities indicates that only 3% of the solar energy hitting the patch of land corresponding to the power plant is exported in the form of electrical energy.
But efficiency is not everything. 3% of a gigantic resource like solar energy input can still be tremendously large. It translates to over 6 W/m2 for a standard insolation of 200 W/m2, which is about thirty-times better than wind, per land area. While a field of PV panels outperform an ST installation by a factor of 5-6, the technologically simpler solar thermal designs can be more cost effective than PV. Reflectors and oil pipes are low-tech cheap devices, compared to photovoltaic material. The production cost for solar thermal is estimated to be about $0.06/kWh, which is lower than the typical retail cost of electricity, but still a factor of two higher than fossil fuel electricity production costs.
One disadvantage of solar thermal is that concentration only works when the sun itself is visible in the sky: no obscuring clouds. One way to think of it is: if you can't see your shadow, solar concentration will not work. Meanwhile, PV panels will still produce a meaningful amount of daytime electricity from the bright sky and clouds even if the sun itself is not "out."
Balancing this disadvantage is the fact that solar thermal has some built-in storage capacity, in that the heated oil can be "banked" for some hours 92 and continue to produce electricity even during the passage of a cloud or for a few hours into the evening. In this sense, it can better match the peak of electrical demand (early evening: Figure 13.15) than can PV, which goes to zero once the sun sets.
As seen in Figure 13.13, the desert southwest is the best place in the U.S. for solar thermal electricity generation. It makes sense that deserts would be good spots, since effective concentration requires no interference from clouds. Incidentally, transmitting electricity over intermediate distances (across regions) is fairly efficient: typically better than 90% for distances shorter than ~1,000 km.

In 2018, only four states produced solar thermal power, 68% from California and 22% from Arizona. Table 13.4 provides some context, comparing ST to PV in each of the four states that have any solar thermal. For the entire U.S., less than 0.1% of electricity derives from solar thermal, and PV is about 25 times bigger on the whole. Globally, ST averages about 1.1 GW93 (2016), about half in Spain and a third in the U.S.94

13.8.3 Pros and Cons of Solar Thermal
Summarizing the pros and cons for solar thermal (ST), starting with the good aspects:
►ST taps into a super-abundant resource the only renewable that has such a margin;
ST technology is low-tech and inexpensive, using well-developed power plant technologies;
ST has built-in short-term storage capacity for covering evening power demands;
Life-cycle CO2 emissions are 20 times smaller than that of tradi- tional fossil fuel electricity [68].
And the less great stuff:
►ST requires direct sunlight; intolerant of clouds;
ST is only possible at utility-scale, requiring a power plant;
ST has a lower land-area efficiency than PV panels;
► Some disruption will be imposed on the local environment/habitat.
13.9 Upshot for Solar
Hands down, solar is the only renewable resource capable of matching our current societal energy demand. Not only can it reach 18 TW, it can exceed the mark by orders of magnitude. Finding space for panels is not a limitation. The efficiency of PV panels is perfectly respectable based on physics expectations, and beats the best that biology has done by a factor of 3-4. The efficiency is high enough that roof space tends to be more than sufficient to satisfy the demands of individual houses.
[68]: (2020), Life Cycle GHG Emissions
Pros and cons are listed separately for PV and ST in Section 13.7.1 and Section 13.8.3, respectively.

Holding solar back is its intermittency95 and high up-front cost. Intermit- tency can be solved by battery storage, but this can double the cost and require maintenance and periodic battery replacement. Additionally-as for many of our renewable options-all of our society's demands9% are not well met by electricity generation.

Sizing up a PV installation is fairly straightforward. Having first deter- mined how many kWh per day are to be produced, on average, divide this by the kWh/m2/day value for the site," which is essentially the number of hours of full-sun" equivalent, and tends to be in the 4-6 hour ballpark. This says how many kilowatts the array should produce in full sun (peak Watts). For instance, if only 10 kWh/day are needed," and the region in question gets 5 kWh/m2/day, the system needs to operate at a peak power of 2 kWp, costing about $6k to purchase and install (grid tied). Inflating by 20% offsets unaccounted losses100 to better match real conditions.
Solar thermal energy is another way to run a traditional steam-based power plant, using relatively low-tech mirrors and pipes to concentrate solar energy into a heat-carrying fluid that can later make steam. Effective efficiencies are relatively low,101 but on the bright side, the low-tech nature makes it fairly cheap, and the technique can accommodate some degree of thermal storage for use some hours into the evening. Anything102 starting from solar input has the potential to be a major player, given the ~100,000 TW scale of solar energy incident upon the earth.

If the illumination is low and the panel continues to operate at maximum power,110 which changes the most compared to full-sun operation: the voltage or the current? Why might lower light (fewer photons) directly connect to a lower current based on the physics of PV operation?

29. If typical insolation is 200 W/m2, how much land area would be needed for a 15% efficient flat PV array supplying an average of 10,000 W for every person in the U.S. (population 330 million). If arranged in a square, how large is the side-length of this array? Draw it on top of a state of your choice, to scale.
30. Based on what is presented in the text,115 why is solar power still such a minor player if it is so hugely abundant and the technology has been around for a long time? What are some of the challenges?

32. According to the table in Problem 26, San Diego can expect an annual average solar yield of 5.7 kWh/m2/day when the panel is tilted to the site latitude and facing south.116 If a household seeks to produce a modest 8 kWh per day using 16% efficient panels,

33. Using the parameters from Problem 32, interpreting the solar yield as daily hours of peak-sun-equivalent (at solar exposure of 1 kW/m2) what should the array size be in terms of peak Watts in order to deliver 8 kWh per day? How much would the system cost to install at $3.00 per Wp?
34. One way to look at solar payback time time is to note that an
    installed system will cost something like $3,000 for each kWp (peak capacity), and that you'll produce x kWh from that 1 kW, array if your region gets x hours of full-sun-equivalent on average. Since each kWh of electricity costs something like $0.15, it becomes straightforward to compute the value per day as $0.15x, and determine how long to match the $3k investment. The result is independent of the actual array size, depending only on the cost per Wp, the solar yield at your location, and the cost of electricity. What would the payback time be, in years, if the cost is $3/Wp p the yield is 6 hours per day of full-sun-equivalent, and electricity in your region costs $0.15/kWh?

38. Solar thermal has a fairly low efficiency in terms of land area of about 3%, compared to 15-20% for PV. Many would shake their heads and say that's too low to be of any use. What is the counter-argument that it may be fine?
    It is a good practice to round the final size up a bit to make sure additional inefficiencies do not prevent reaching the goal.

    14 Biological Energy
    The renewable energy options discussed thus far have been rather different from the chemically-stored thermal energy provided by fossil fuels. These sources-hydroelectricity, wind, and solar-are good at making electricity, but are intermittent to various degrees and are not directly suitable for transportation, except via bulky batteries.
    Biologically-based energy is more similar to fossil fuels in that it is a form of chemical energy burned to create thermal energy. We will focus on two major forms: solid biomass and liquid biofuels. The latter is well-suited to transportation: one of the few renewable energies that can make this claim. In some cases, the same plant can produce either food or bio-energy-depending on whether it is eaten by another biological form or by a machine.
    Ultimately, biologically-based energy is a form of solar energy, creating chemical storage by means of photosynthesis. Fossil fuels are also an ancient form of biofuel, deriving from photosynthetic energy captured millions of years ago. So sunlight is the actual energy source, and photosynthesis is the mechanism by which the energy is stored in chemical form.

    14.1 Photosynthesis
    This textbook will not focus on the complex mechanisms responsible for photosynthesis, but rather will describe the net result and efficiency. Photosynthesis involves the absorption of individual solar photons that ultimately facilitate the movement of electrons in order to change bonding structures, forming sugars, cellulose, and other materials used to construct a plant. The fundamental chemical reaction is depicted in

    CO2 + H2O + light → CH2O + O2
    (14.1)
    In sentence form: energy from light transforms carbon dioxide and water into a building block of sugar and releases oxygen back to the air.
    Box 14.1: Where Do Plants Get Their Mass?
    A valuable question to ponder: where do plants get their mass? Is it from the soil? Is it from water? Is it from the air? Take a moment to
    think about it. We can rule out soil on the observation that massive trees are not sitting in holes of excavated earth. Yes, the roots displace some of the soil, but a fallen tree reveals little root volume compared to the trunk and branches. And while living plant material contains significant water, completely dry plant matter1 has plenty of mass without water.
    Plant matter contains substantial carbon content,2 and we now connect the knowledge that plants' leaves "breathe in" CO2 and release O2, as in Eq. 14.1. Every time this happens, the plant steals a carbon atom from the air, spitting the oxygen right back out. The carbon is stuck into a sugar or other structural molecule and stays in the plant. Thus plants obtain their dry mass out of "thin air."
    In terms of efficiency, plants tend to convert sunlight into stored chemical energy at a rate of 0.01-6%. The range is rather large due to limitations in water and nutrients. A well-watered and fertilized corn field might reach 1.5% efficiency. Algae tend to top the charts at 5-6%. Dry climates might have ample sunlight, but too little water for efficient use of the available light. Box 14.2 provides an example of how one might estimate what fraction of incident solar energy is turned into chemical storage by a potato plant.
    Box 14.2: Example Photosynthetic Efficiency
    Let us consider a potato plant (Figure 14.2) as an example by which to estimate photosynthetic efficiency. The potato plant might have a leafy footprint of 0.5 m2-a square roughly 0.7 m on a side or a circle about 0.8 m in diameter and produce four 0.5 kg potatoes, or 2 kg of starchy material. Carbohydrates have an energy density of 4 kcal/g, so the potato plant has stored 8,000 kcal, or about 32 MJ.3
    If the typical five-month growing-season (~ 1.25 x 107 s) has inso- lation of 250 W/m2, the plant collects 125 W5 times 1.25 x 107 or 1.6 x 109 J, while making 32 MJ of spuds. The photosynthetic

    14.2 Biomass
    Biological mass, or biomass, has long been utilized to supplement our energy needs, via controlled use of fire starting hundreds of thousands of years ago. Burning wood or other plant matter, and in some places dried animal feces counts as utilization of biomass. Wood provides about 4 kcal of energy per gram when burned, or about 16 MJ/kg-much like proteins or carbohydrates in our diet. Burning of biomass is most typically used for heating and cooking within individual homes.
    Example 14.2.1 A 10 kg bundle of dry firewood is used to heat a home that requires 4,000 W to stay warm. How long will the wood last?8
    Every gram of wood has 4 kcal or about 16 kJ of energy. We get 4,000 W by burning one gram every 4 seconds: 16 kJ/4 s is 4 kW. Each kilogram will therefore take about 4,000 s (a little over an hour) and the whole bundle will be gone after 11 hours.
    In the U.S. in 2018, 2.36 qBtu of the 101.25 qBtu total came from burning wood, and an additional 0.5 qBtu came from incinerating waste products [34]. Thus about 2.8% (0.1 TW) of U.S. energy comes from biomass. Out of the 11.41 qBtu of all renewables in 2018, biomass accounted for 25% of the U.S. renewable budget."
    Globally, biomass use is estimated to be more important, at 6%,10 constituting more than a third of global renewable resources (Fig. 7.8; p. 109). The high use of biomass in the wider world is a reflection on the difference between developed countries like the U.S. and developing countries that are more likely to rely on more primitive forms of energy like firewood and animal dung. Since most biomass around the world is burned for individual use, emissions controls are essentially non-existent, resulting in high levels of pollution-smoke and harmful chemicals that would be scrubbed out of a power plant's exhaust.11

    Box 14.3: Life is Thin and Precious
    The total mass of living organisms on Earth is estimated to be about 2 trillion tons [94]. Having a density similar to that of water, 2x 1015 kg, if spread uniformly around the planet, would stack to 4 mm high! Put another way, a random line projecting upward from the surface of the earth would go through about 4 mm of living matter, on average. That's a pretty thin shell of life!

    biological matter,12 we would run through all the currently-living mass-land and sea-in a short 15 years!
    Can you imagine burning through all of Earth's forests and animals in 15 years? That's the rate at which we use energy today-illustrating the disparity between the biological resources on the planet and our staggering energy appetite. We can't expect to maintain our based on biomass and biofuels, and still have a vibrant natural
    pace planet.

    12: About a quarter of the biomass is "dry" combustible material, at about 4 kcal/g.
    14.3 Biofuels
    Biofuels deserve their own category because the origins and end uses are different enough to warrant distinction. While the biomass sources from Section 14.2 tend to be in solid form, biofuels as treated here are liquid. Liquid fuels are instantly a big deal because they have the energy density and versatility to be used in transportation applications. An airplane can't very well fly on firewood, hydroelectricity, solar, wind, ocean currents, geothermal, or nuclear energy.13 matter. Biofuels therefore occupy a special place in the pantheon of renewable resources as the most obvious viable replacement for petroleum-the dominant fossil fuel responsible for 92%14 of transportation in the U.S.
    In the U.S. in 2018, 2.28 qBtu (2.3%; 0.08 TW) came from biofuels [34], which is very similar to the amount from biomass (wood, waste). Out of the 11.41 qBtu of all renewables, biofuels account for 20% of the U.S. renewable budget (Table 10.3; p. 170).
    Most prominently, ethanol is the chief biofuel, accounting for about 80% of the total. It is an alcohol that can be produced by fermenting the photosynthetically-produced sugars in the plant and then distilling the result.15 Structurally, ethanol is very similar to ethane16 except that the terminating hydrogen on one end of the chain is replaced by a hydroxyl group (OH; shown in Figure 14.3).
    Though it is not necessary to fully understand the chemistry,17 combus- tion of ethanol-for comparison to the fossil fuel reactions in Eq. 8.1 (p. 121) goes according to
    C2H5OH + 202 → 2CO2 + 3H2O + 29.7kJ/g.
    (14.2)
    In other words, ethanol combines with oxygen via combustion (burning) producing carbon dioxide and water, also releasing energy. It is almost like the photosynthesis reaction (Eq. 14.1) in reverse.
    The energy density works out to 7.1 kcal/g, which is considerably lower than octane (representing gasoline) at 11.5 kcal/g (Table 8.2; p. 121). In terms of CO2 production, the reaction generates 88 g of CO2 for each 46 g of ethanol, coming to 1.9 g/g-which is lower than the 3.09 factor

In terms of CO2 energy intensity, ethanol produces 64 g of CO2 for every 1 MJ of energy: exactly the same as petroleum (Table 8.2). Generally speaking, biofuels-and other forms of biomass-are often considered to be carbon-neutral,18 as the carbon released upon burning was taken in from the atmosphere in the process of photosynthesis, making it a cycle.
    Most of the ethanol in the U.S. is blended into gasoline into E10, E15, or E85 products meaning 10%, 15%, or 85% ethanol. Not all vehicles are equipped to handle the more corrosive ethanol, and those that are ("flex-fuel" vehicles) might expect lower energy performance due to the fact that ethanol has lower energy density than gasoline.
    Both the lower energy density and lower carbon mass per input fuel mass can be attributed to the oxygen atom hosted by the ethanol molecule.19 Ethanol can derive from a number of plants. In the U.S., corn is the most common feedstock. Brazil uses sugar cane, which requires tropical climates.

    14.3.1 EROEI
    Before going further, we introduce a crucial metric for evaluating the merit of any energy source: the EROEI.
    Definition 14.3.1 EROEI, or Energy Returned on Energy Invested, is a measure of how profitable an energy source is in terms of energy, expressed as a ratio. For instance, a 9:1 EROEI means 9 units were extracted or produced for an investment of 1 unit, leaving a net gain of 8 units of energy. 1:1 is break-even, deriving no net energy benefit
    By and large, energy does not come for free. Oil has to be actively drilled; hydroelectricity requires construction of a dam; solar panels are fabricated in an industrial process requiring energy input. So the question is: how much energy do we get out compared to the amount we had to put in? If we extract less energy than we invest, we lose net energy and probably should not bother.20 If we only get a little more out, we still may question the investment.
    Example 14.3.1 Let's say an oil drilling operation uses petroleum products (like gasoline) as its only energy input for drilling and extracting oil. In one year, the operation pumps 12,000 barrels of oil, and in the effort uses 800 barrels of oil as energy input. What is the EROEI?
    In this case, we just have to arrange output to input as 12,000:800, and reduce to 15:1.
    Early oil wells were shallow and under pressure, producing "gushers" that exceeded 100:1 in EROEI. To understand what this means, imagine
    EROEI (sometimes just EROI) is one level above efficiency. Efficiency asks how much of a source is converted into a form useful to us. EROEI asks about what went into obtaining that source in the first place. It's still an efficiency, of sorts. Maybe a pre-efficiency.
    20: In some cases, it may still make sense to pursue EROEI < 1 resources if the resulting form is otherwise hard to obtain, like food
    energy.
    As another example, we might use coal to process biofuels, in effect converting a less useful solid to a more useful liquid, even if losing energy in the process. But such desperate measures will not be favored if alternatives exist.

    using oil as the energy source for the original exploration, building the equipment, running the drill, and collecting/storing the product. An EROEI of 100:1 means that for
    every barrel of oil that goes into the process, 100 barrels come out. That's a good deal. A high EROEI means nearly "free" energy: low effort for high reward.
    As we progress to more challenging oil resources, 21 the EROEI drops- now around 10-15:1 for conventional oil and as low as 3:1 for tar sands [95]. Table 14.1 provides one set of EROEI estimates for various sources. Note that estimates vary due to difficulties in proper accounting of all energy inputs, so don't take these numbers literally-just as approximate guides.

    If life were a video game, we would look at Table 14.1, decide that hydroelectric and wind are "the best," cursor over to them and "plus" those two up until we're getting all our energy from these low-energy- investment sources. But of course the world is constrained, placing real limits to what is possible. We saw in Chapter 11 and Chapter 12 that hydroelectricity and wind cannot be expected to provide more than a few terawatts, leaving a large shortfall. Meanwhile, solar has the largest raw potential. In other words, it is useful to appreciate the EROEI of various resources, but EROEI is not the sole determining factor of what is practical. A low EROEI can be tolerable if abundance makes up for
    it.
    For resources whose energy investment is mostly up-front, before pro- duction begins, the resulting EROEI depends critically on how long the resource will provide energy. After all, the energy return gets larger the longer the facility can operate, while the investment part may be essentially done and unchanging. It can be difficult to predict how long a resource will last, which is part of why EROEI estimates are just that: approximate guidelines.
    Example 14.3.2 Let's say a particular wind turbine achieves a 20:1 EROEI after operating for a 40 year lifetime. How many years-worth of its energy output went into constructing and installing it?
    Each year the turbine produces some amount of energy, which we can call E (in Joules, for instance). In this case, it will produce 40E Joules in its lifetime. Since EROEI is 20:1, it must have taken 40E /20 = 2E Joules of input energy to create.22 At a rate of E per year, it will produce 2E

    in 2 years, therefore taking two years to produce as much as went into its manufacture-paying for itself, energetically.
    In a self-supporting sense23 the net energy is x - 1 for an EROEI of x:1. In other words, an EROEI of 1.25:1 only "really" produces 0.25 units of exportable energy for every one unit invested, if that one invested unit comes from the 1.25 units extracted in a closed system. In this case, for every one unit netted,24 4 units went in and 5 came out-only 1 of the 5 free and clear.
    Example 14.3.3 A self-contained operation to produce ethanol man- ages to only use its own ethanol to run the entire operation of growing, harvesting, and processing the crops to produce ethanol. In one year, the operation produced a total of 250,000 L of ethanol at an EROEI of 1.25:1. How much ethanol were they able to export/sell from the operation?
    The 1.25 number is associated with total production, which is 250,000 L in this case. Multiplying both sides of the 1.25:1 ratio by 200,000 results in an output:input ratio of 250,000:200,000 meaning that the operation required 200,000 L of input. Thus the operation was able to deliver 50,000 L to market.
    Low EROEI cuts into the effective available resource, demanding in- vestment of precious energy. As conventional resources are exhausted, forcing us to lower-EROEI deposits, even if we keep up with energy demand in absolute terms,25 the net energy available will decline as a greater fraction of the harvest must go back into extraction.
    Example 14.3.4 What would have happened to an early agricultural society if the EROEI of growing food26 slipped below 1:1, if all of the energy used to harvest the food came from workers and animals fed. by the same food?
    At 1:1, every unit of energy extracted requires one unit of investment. Then 100% of the energy is spent acquiring energy, leaving no energy for other functions of the society (shelter, defense, etc.). Such a marginal existence could not be maintained, so some minimum exists below which the society becomes non-viable.
    Note that many of the entries in Table 14.1 have low numbers, translating to a tough life in which a substantial fraction of the total energy resource is dedicated to continued energy procurement. Biological forms of energy are not superstars in this regard.

    food energy consumed [97]. In a sense, we are eating27 our fossil fuels! It also points to an EROEI of 0.1:1, which is well below break-even. Obviously in times prior to fossil fuels, when we used human and animal labor in our agricultural pursuits, an EROEI less than 1:1 would spell starvation: more energy going in than was recouped from the land. Today, fossil fuels give us a temporary exception, so that we can afford to lose useful energy in the bargain, turning 10 units of fossil fuel energy into one unit that we eat. We might view this as a negative aspect of the Green Revolution.
    14.3.2 EROEI of Biofuels
    Various estimates exist for the EROEI for different biofuels. Unfortunately for the U.S., the corn ethanol industry is estimated to have an EROEI of anywhere from 0.8:1 to 1.6:1. The former would mean it's a net loss of energy, and that we would have more energy available if we did not spend any of it trying to get ethanol from corn. Biodiesel (a non-ethanol biofuel produced from vegetable oils or animal fat) is estimated to have an EROEI of 1.3:1 [98]. Sugar cane may be anywhere from 0.8:1 to 10:1 [99] (see Table 14.2).
    To explore an example of how this all plays out, let's say that corn ethanol provides an EROEI of 1.2:1-in the middle of the estimated range. This means that in order to get 1.2 units of energy out, one unit has to go
    in. Or for every 6 units out, 5 go in. If we use that same resource as the energy input-in other words, we use corn ethanol as the energy input to grow, harvest, distill, and distribute corn ethanol-then we get to "keep" one unit for external use out of every 6 units produced. For the U.S. to replace its 37 qBtu/yr oil habit with corn ethanol, it would take six times this much, or 220 qBtu (2.3 x 1020 J) of corn ethanol production each year.
    If the growing season is 5 months, the solar input is 250 W/m2 on average, and the corn field is 1.5% efficient at turning sunlight into chemical energy, then each square meter of corn-land produces 4.9 x 107 J of energy28 and we would therefore need about 5 x 1012 m2 of land for corn. This is an area 2,200 km on a side (Figure 14.4)! The U.S. does not possess this much arable land (estimated at about 30% of this). About 4 x 1011 m2 of land in the U.S. is currently used for corn production, which is 8% of what would be needed. And of course we must still feed ourselves. In 2018, 31% of U.S. corn production went into ethanol. We would somehow need to ramp corn ethanol production up by a factor of 40 to derive our current liquid fuels from corn in a self-sufficient way. Don't expect to see this fantasy materialize.

    Why do we have mandates to introduce ethanol into fuel blends?
    Don't assume that the world is always scientifically rational and run by "adults" whose interests extend beyond personal gain. Many political factors enter: votes from midwestern swing-states,29 job dependencies, influences from a powerful industry, the appearance of "green" (carbon-neutral) energy30 all play a role.
    A fundamental reason why the EROEI for biofuels tends to be low is that processing the material into ethanol requires a fair amount of energy input in the form of heat. Burning biomass, by contrast, does not have this requirement. Also, burned biomass is often gathered from untended (natural) environments that required little deliberate energy input on the parts of humans. Therefore, low EROEI is more a problem for biofuels than biomass.

    Upshot for Biomass and Biofuels
    Wood has always provided a source of heat for people, and will continue to do so. Its use occupied a much higher fraction of energy resources hundreds of years ago before being supplanted by fossil fuels. Still, several percent of U.S. energy comes from wood (and over 5% globally). Wood represents a renewable resource that can often be locally obtained, and will likely continue steady use, potentially assuming a greater fraction again if overall energy expenditure declines.
    31
    Biofuels are special due to their liquid nature, as a potential replacement for oil to drive transportation. Because photosynthesis is not terribly efficient, and the EROEI of biofuels tends to be on the low side, the amount of land needed to replace petroleum is anywhere from daunting to prohibitive. This is even before addressing the crunch an extensive expansion would place on water resources or food supply, or the degra- dation of arable land that may result from depleting nutrients in the soil. Algae may represent another approach, but so far the process appears to be well below break-even in terms of EROEI (from 0.13-0.71:1 [100]). It is difficult to see a meaningful path forward for wholesale replacement of liquid fuels using biological resources.
    A final perspective is that the total biological scale on the planet is estimated to be 100 TW (Table 10.2; p. 168), which is not outrageously
    more
    e32 than the current 18 TW scale of the human endeavor. Can we really imagine commandeering 20% of all life on Earth to serve our energy needs? It would actually need to be substantially more than this, given EROEI limits. It may be that Earth does not possess enough biology to offer a substitute for our current fossil fuel appetite-even if we tried to use it all.

    We conclude by listing some pros and cons for biologically-derived energy, beginning with the advantageous aspects:
    ► Biofuels offer a possible liquid fuel substitute to support trans- portation needs;
    ► Biological energy relies on dependable solar input, replenished as harvested stocks grow back;
    ► Biofuels represent a form of storage of solar energy, mitigating intermittency;
    ► Methods for growing and harvesting crops are well established; Burning biomass is low-tech and likely to remain part of our energy portfolio.
    And the less savory aspects:
    ► It is difficult to scale biological energy to meaningful multi-terawatt levels;
    Heavy reliance on biological energy co-opts earth's biology and displaces natural habitat;
    ► Cultivating biofuels competes with food production for water and land resources;
    Low EROEI for biofuels reduces net energy available;
    ► Smoke and other pollutants from burning biomass can be prob- lematic.

    14.5 Problems
1. A large tree might have a trunk 0.5 m in diameter and be 40 m tall. Even though it branches out many times, pretend all the wood fits into a cylinder maintaining this 0.5 m diameter for the full height of the tree. Wood floats,33 so let's say it has a density around 800 kg/m3. How many kilograms of CO2 did this tree pull out of the atmosphere to get its carbon, if we treat the tree's mass as 50% carbon?
2. Using the geometry and density of the tree in Problem 1, if the resulting wood has an energy density similar to carbohydrates (4 kcal/g), and the tree spent 50 years accumulating this bulk while receiving an average of 250 W/m2 of solar input over 5 months each year in a leafy area averaging 200 m2 to receive sunlight, what is the net photosynthetic efficiency of the tree?
3. The U.S. gets 2.4 qBtu per year of energy from burning biomass (mostly firewood). At an energy density of 4 kcal per gram, and a population of 330 million, how many 5 kg logs per year does this translate to per person?
   33: Water has a density of 1,000 kg/m3.
   Hint: carbon dioxide is 44/12 times the mass of plain carbon.
   Now if you could just think of a way to put the answer on a log scale, ha ha.

4. How many logs of firewood per day (whose parameters are speci- fied in Problem 3) would you need to burn to provide 5,000 W of heating to a house?
5. Replicate the conclusion of Box 14.3 by assuming one-quarter of the 2 trillion tons (5 x 1014 kg) of mass is combustible at 4kcal/g. How long-in years would this amount of energy last if burning at 18 TW?
6. Given the energy densities of ethanol vs. octane (gasoline), how many liters of ethanol does it take to replace one liter of gasoline, if the densities are 789 g/L for ethanol and 703 g/L for octane?
7. If 50 kJ of energy are spent to extract 1 MJ of energy content in the
   form of coal, what is the EROEI?
8. Re-express an EROEI of 1.5:1 in terms of how many total units of energy must be produced in order to extract one unit of net energy in a self-supporting operation.
9. Imagine that the extraction of a low-EROEI biofuel is performed using energy derived from that biofuel alone in other words, a self-contained operation not using any other (external) form of energy. We can think of the situation thusly: for each hectare of land producing fuel for external use, some additional land must be dedicated to raising the energy used to perform the extraction operation-like an overhead. If the EROEI is 1.5:1,34 how much total land area would need to be devoted to the endeavor for every hectare (or any area unit you wish) that contributes to net production? See Problem 8 for a related scenario.
10. It takes a certain energy investment to fabricate a solar panel. Referring to Table 14.1, figure out how many years of the panel's output energy it takes to "pay off" the investment if the EROEI estimate assumed operation for 30 years.
11. Our modern food industry has an EROEI of 0.1:1. In pre-industrial settings, when energy investment for food production was in the form of muscle power (animal and human), why would a 0.1:1 EROEI for food have been untenable? Next, describe the conditions
    for an exact break-even food EROEI of 1:1. What would this mean in terms of where effort/energy goes? What would this leave for building shelters, cathedrals, or esthetic pursuits?
12. Parallel the development in the text for the land required for corn ethanol if it is self-sufficient35 in the case for EROEI of 1.5:1-near the optimistic end of the range. How much larger is this than the area now devoted to corn, and how does it compare to total arable land in the U.S.?
13. Using the setup for Problem 12, how large would the required corn

    area be in terms of the side length of a square in units of kilometers. Draw this to approximate scale on a crude representation of the contiguous U.S. And this is at the optimistic end.
14. What fraction of the earth's 100 TW biological budget (all life on the planet) do you think is justifiable to use in service of human energy needs? Explain your reasoning. What does this become in TW, and how does it compare to our 18 TW current appetite?
    If the EROEI is less than 2:1 (as it is for many biofuels), we would cut your estimate in TW by more than half to account for the diverted energy used for extraction.

    15 Nuclear Energy
    Most of the energy forms discussed thus far derive from sunlight— either contemporary input or fossilized storage. The fuel for nuclear energy is truly ancient, predating the solar system. The heavy elements participating in fission were produced by astrophysical cataclysms (most likely merging neutron stars), while the hydrogen building blocks for fusion originated in the Big Bang itself. In brief, fission involves the splitting of heavy nuclei into smaller pieces, while fusion builds larger nuclei from smaller ones.
    While only fission has been successfully implemented as a source of societal energy, both types essentially boil down to the same thing: a source of heat to make steam and drive a heat engine. How and why nuclear material generates heat will be a primary focus of this chapter. Many practical concerns surround nuclear power, such as safety, weapons, waste, and proliferation of dangerous material. Self-pride for the impressive accomplishment of mastering nature well enough to implement nuclear power may not adequately justify continued reliance upon it-even if it is not a direct emitter of CO2.
    Understanding nuclear energy requires a longer journey than was needed for hydroelectricity, wind, and solar photovoltaics. We first learn about the nucleus and its many configurations, how nuclei transform from one to another through radioactive decay, the role E = mc2 plays, and finally dig into the workings of fission and fusion.
    15.1 The Nucleus
    First, what is a nucleus? Every (neutral) atom consists of a positively- charged nucleus surrounded by a cloud of negative electrons (Figure 15.1).

    The nucleus is about 100,000 times smaller than the electron cloud,1 but contains 99.97% of the atom's mass in a super-dense nugget composed of protons (positive charge) and neutrons (no charge). While electro- magnetic forces vehemently resist the close congregation of positively- charged protons, the strong nuclear force overpowers this objection and sticks the protons and neutrons together in a stable existence.

    6), or even in some cases the fully-described 113C, (A = 13; Z = 6; N = 7). The latter two forms are somewhat redundant-though sometimes appreciated/helpful— because all carbon atoms have Z = 6, and N = A - Z always. Therefore, 13C
    says it all, provided you can easily find or remember the Z number for carbon. The general pattern for an isotope of element X is X Other common designations are, for example, C12, C13, U238, or C-12, C-13, U-238 as alternatives to 12C, 13C, and 238 U, respectively.

     The physicist's version of the periodic table is called the Chart of the Nuclides, and contains a wealth of information. The basic layout idea is introduced in Figure 15.2, for the extreme low-mass end of nuclides.
     Definition 15.1.1 A nuclide is any unique combination of nucleons, so that every nucleus is one of the possible nuclides. For example, the 12C nucleus is one nuclide, while 13C is a distinct, different nuclide.
     Figure 15.3 provides a full view of the chart layout: neutron number, N, runs horizontally and proton number, Z, runs vertically. Stable nuclei are indicated by black boxes at some particular integer value of N and

This can be traced to the fact that protons repel each other due to their electric charge, so the nucleus can be more tightly bound if fewer protons than neutrons are present-balanced against another penalty for being too far away from N = Z.

For each element (horizontal row), properties of all known isotopes are listed-even those that are radioactive and do not persist for even a small fraction of a second before decaying. Stable isotopes are denoted by gray boxes. The mass of each, in atomic mass units (a.m.u.)— defined so that the neutral 12C atom is exactly 12.0000 a.m.u.—is given, and the natural abundance as found on Earth, in percent. The Chart of the Nuclides lets us peak inside the periodic table in great detail, as Example 15.1.2 suggests.

     Example 15.1.2 From the Boron row (Z 5) in Figure 15.4, we can see that 19.9% of boron is found in the form of 10B, while the other 80.1% is 11B.
     The weighted composite mass is therefore 0.199 x 10.0129370+0.801× 11.0093055, yielding 10.81103 a.m.u., which is the number presented as the molar mass on the periodic table."
     Because the Chart of the Nuclides has neutron number, N, increasing from left to right, and proton number, Z, increasing vertically, nuclei having the same mass number, A = Z+N, are arranged on diagonals. Notice that in the region shown in Figure 15.4, we never find more than one stable element at each mass number (constant A).
     Figure 15.3: Layout of the Chart of the Nuclides, showing positions of naturally- occurring nuclei (stable or long-lived enough to be present on Earth). Stable nuclei tend to have more neutrons than protons-especially for heavier nuclei. This is why the track of stable nuclei bends away from the N = Z diagonal line. Arrows point to important elements of iron, lead, thorium, and uranium at Z values of 26, 82, 90, and 92, respectively.
     5: Even this level of detail is short of what can be found in the actual Chart of the Nu- clides, which also provides quantitative val- ues for neutron absorption, nuclear spins, excited states, additional decay paths and associated energies.

Scientific notation is expressed as, e.g., 8e-23, meaning 8 x 10-23. A wealth of information is included: spend some time studying the surrounding guides to learn what data each box contains.
15.2 Radioactive Decay
When one nuclide, or isotope changes into another, it does so by the process of radioactive decay. Stable nuclides have no incentive to undergo such decays, but unstable nuclides will seek a more stable configuration through the decay process.
8
The black squares in Figure 15.3, or gray squares in Figure 15.4 are stable, leaving all others as unstable, meaning that they will undergo radioactive decay to a different nucleus after some time interval that is characterized by the nuclide's half life.
Definition 15.2.1 The half life of a nuclide is the time at which the probability of decay reaches 50%. A large sample of such nuclides will be reduced to half the original number after one half-life. Each subsequent half-life interval removes another half of what remains.

Figure 15.4 lists a half-life9 for each unstable nuclide. For example, the half-life for a neutron (n1 in Figure 15.4) is 10.25 minutes, meaning that a lone neutron has a 50% chance of surviving this long. The process is statistical, so an individual neutron might only last 3 seconds, or might still be around in 15 or even 60 minutes. The predictive power is sharpened the larger the sample is: half will remain after 10.25 minutes.
Example 15.2.1 If starting with 16 million separate neutrons, we would expect 8 million to still be present after 10.25 minutes, 4 million after 20.5 minutes, 2 million after 30.75 minutes, and down to 1 million neutrons in 41 minutes.
Correspondingly, a single isolated neutron has a 50% chance of still being around in 10.25 minutes, a 25% chance of lasting 20.5 minutes, and a 6.25% chance of surviving 41 minutes. Every half-life interval cuts the probability of survival in half again.
Table 15.1 summarizes these results, adding jumps to 10 and 24 half lives for illustration, ending at one neutron.
Luckily, radioactive decays don't go just any which way, but stick to a very small menu of possible routes. When a decay happens, the nucleus always spits something out, which could be an electron, a positron, a helium nucleus (called an alpha particle), a photon, or more rarely might spit out one or more individual protons or neutrons. Because these particles can emerge at high speed (high energy), they are like little bullets firing at random times and directions into their surroundings. These bullets are potentially damaging to materials and biological tissues-especially DNA, able to cause mutations and/or initiate cancerous growth. The primary decay mechanisms pertaining to the vast majority of decays are listed below and accompanied by Figure 15.5.

Figure 15.5: Radioactive decay mechanisms for a, ß, and ßt. Protons are colored red, and neutrons light purple. The total nucleon counts are correct for the two beta decays, but only schematic for the larger 144Nd nucleus used to illustrate alpha decay, which is predominantly seen only in heavier nuclei (aside from "Li and Be). The positron is an anti-electron: a positively-charged antimatter counterpart to the electron. Neutrinos are sometimes called "ghost" particles for their near-complete non-interactivity with ordinary matter.
1. Alpha decay (a), in which a foursome of two protons and two neutrons essentially a 'He nucleus-leaps out.10 When this hap- pens, the nucleus reduces its N by two, reduces its Z by two, and therefore A by 4. On the chart of the nuclides, it moves two squares left and two squares down (see Figure 15.7). For example, Be decays this way, essentially splitting into two 4He nuclei;

2. Beta-minus (ẞ) decay is a manifestation of the weak nuclear force, in which a neutron within the nucleus converts to a proton, and in the process spits out an electron (ẞ particle, really just e ̄) to conserve total electric charge, and a neutrino-which we will ignore." The mass number, A is unchanged, but N goes down one and Z goes up one (gaining a proton and losing a neutron). Thus on the chart of nuclides the motion is one left, one up.
   It's like a chess move (Figure 15.7);
3. Beta-plus (+) decay, like ß-, is a manifestation of the weak nuclear force, in which a proton within the nucleus converts to a neutron, emitting a positron (B+, or e+, or anti-electron; a form of antimatter) again maintaining charge conservation, and an ignored neutrino. Similar to ẞ decay, A is unchanged, but Z is reduced by one and N gains one. On the chart, the move is diagonal: down one and right one (Figure 15.7).
4. Gamma decay (7) happens when a nucleus is in an excited energy state, having been rattled by some other decay or bombardment, and it emits a high-energy photon, called a gamma ray, as it settles into a lower energy state (Figure 15.6). For y decays, Z, N, and A do not change, so the nucleus does not morph into another flavor, and thus does not move on the Chart of the Nuclides.
   Figure 15.7 demonstrates the motion of each of these decays on the Chart of the Nuclides, and Table 15.2 summarizes the nucleon arithmetic.

   11: Perhaps it is fair to ignore neutrinos since they ignore us. Neutrinos interact so infrequently with matter that a neu- trino could fly through light years of rocky (Earth-like) material before being expected to hit something (interact). This extreme non-interactivity earns it the title of "ghost" particle.

   Figure 15.7: Radioactive decays shown as moves on the "chess board" of the Chart of the Nuclides. The different decay types are color-coded to match Figure 15.8, and are only shown in a few representative squares. Decays frequently occur in a series, one after the other (a decay chain), as hinted by the double-sequence starting at and ending on 12C. Note that the square of every unstable nuclide indicates a decay type, even if arrows are not present.

   Example 15.2.2 What will the fate of He be, according to Figure 15.4?
   We can play this chess game! According to the chart, the primary decay mechanism of He8 is ẞ with a half-life of about a tenth of a second. It will become Li, which hangs around for about a second before undergoing another ß- decay to Be. This one lasts almost no time at all (~ 10-16 s) before a decay into two alpha particles (two *He). Such a sequence is called a decay chain.
   As is evident in Figure 15.8, unstable isotopes above the stable track in Figure 15.3 tend to undergo ẞ+ decays to drive toward stable nuclei, while those below the track tend to experience ẞ- decays to drive up toward the stable track. The a decays are more common for heavy nuclei (around uranium), which drive toward the end of the train of stable elements in Figure 15.3, ending up around lead (Pb). We can understand the abundance of lead as a byproduct of heavy-element decay chains.

   Box 15.1: The Weak Nuclear Force
   An aside worth making is that having discussed beta decays, gov- erned by the weak nuclear force, we have now covered all four known forces of nature: gravity, electromagnetism, the weak nuclear force, and the strong nuclear force. That's it: a small menu, really. The latter three are unified into a Standard Model of Physics, but gravity-described by General Relativity has defied all attempts at "grand unification," or a "theory of everything" trying to unite all four forces under a single theoretical framework. One implication is that known physics offers no other "magic" solutions to our energy needs. No new forces have come to light in more than half-a-century, despite dramatic advances in tools to probe the fundamental nature of physics.

   15.3 Mass Energy
   Energy-whatever the form has mass and actually changes the weight of something, although almost imperceptibly. A hot burrito has more mass than the exact same burrito-atom for atom-when it's cold.12 Most of us are familiar, at least casually, with the famous relation E = mc2. More helpfully, we might express it as
   AE = Amc2,
   (15.1)
   where the A symbols indicate a change in energy or mass, and c≈ 3 x 108 m/s is the speed of light. Using kilograms for mass results in Joules for energy. Because c2 is such a large number (nearly 1017), the mass change associated with daily/familiar energy quantities is negligibly small. Box 15.2 explains why E = mc2 is valid for all energy exchanges not just nuclear ones but generally results in mass changes too small to measure in non-nuclear contexts. Earlier, we discussed conservation of energy. More correctly, we observe conservation of mass- energy. That is to say, a system can actually gain or lose net energy if the mass changes correspondingly. In the case of nuclear energy release, the "new" energy comes at the expense of reduced mass.
   Box 15.2: E = mc2 Everywhere
   mc2. It
   Physics is not selective about when we might apply E = always applies, to every situation. It's just that outside of nuclear reactions it does not result in significant mass differences.
   For example, after we eat a 1,000 kcal burrito to fuel our metabolism, we expend the energy13 and lose mass according to Am = AE/c2. Since AE ~ 4 MJ (1,000 kcal), we find the associated mass change is 4.6 × 10-11 kg, which is ten orders-of-magnitude smaller than the mass of the burrito itself.14 So we'd never notice, even though it's really there.
   When we wind up a mechanized toy, coiling a spring, we put energy into the spring and the toy actually gets more massive! But for every Joule we put in, the mass only increases by about 10-17 kg. Forgive us for not noticing. Only in nuclear contexts are the energies large enough to produce a measurable difference in mass.
   Example 15.3.1 Since mass and energy are intimately related, it is common to express masses in energy terms. How would we express 12.0 a.m.u. in MeV (a unit of energy; see Sec. 5.9; p. 78)?
   1 a.m.u. is equivalent to 1.66 x 10-27 kg (last row of Table 15.4), so 12 a.m.u. is 1.99×10-26 kg. To get to energy, apply E = mc2, computing to 1.8 × 10-9 J of energy. Since 1 MeV is 1.6 x 10-13 J, we end up with
   12: The burrito is also ever-so-slightly more massive if it has kinetic energy, gravitational potential energy, or any form of energy. A battery is more massive when charged, even if no atoms or electrons are added. Inci- dentally, charging a battery does not mean literally adding electrical charges (adding particles), but amounts to rearranging elec- trons among the atoms within the battery.

   11,200 MeV corresponding to 12 a.m.u. (1 a.m.u. is 931.5 MeV).
   In practice, and perhaps surprisingly, atoms (nuclei) weigh less than the sum of their parts due to binding energy. In order to rip a nucleus completely apart and move all the nucleons far from each other, energy must be put in (left part of Figure 15.9). And any change in energy is accompanied by a change in mass, via AE = Amc2. All the energy that must be injected to completely dismantle the nucleus weighs something! So the mass of the individual pieces after dismantling the nucleus is effectively the mass of the original nucleus plus the mass-equivalent of all the energy that was put in to tear it apart (middle panel of Figure 15.9). Therefore, binding energy effectively reduces the mass of a nucleus, which we will now explore quantitatively.

  A careful look at Figure 15.4 reveals that lighter stable nuclei (gray- squares) at the lower left of the chart have a mass a little larger than the corresponding mass number, but by the upper right-around oxygen- the mass has edged just lower than A. Table 15.3 shows this trend, confirmable in Figure 15.4 for the first four nuclides in the table. The difference between mass and A is most negative around iron, then turns around and becomes positive again for heavy elements like uranium.
  What is going on here? If the mass of a nucleus were just the sum of its parts, we would expect the total mass to just track linearly as we add more pieces. In fact, if we try to build a neutral carbon atom out of 6 protons, 6 neutrons, and 6 electrons, the sum, according to Table 15.4, should be 12.099 a.m.u., not 12.000. The discrepancy is due to nuclear binding energy, as was introduced in Figure 15.9.
  MeV/c2
  Figure 15.9: One must add energy to over- come nuclear binding energy in order to bust up a nucleus into its constituent nu- cleons (left). Thus, the collective mass of a nucleus plus the mass associated with the energy it takes to break it apart (via E = mc2) must be equal to the sum of the masses of the constituent parts (middle). Therefore, if we compare the mass of the nucleus alone (removing the energy's mass from the scale) it must be less than the mass of the loose collection of nucleons (right).

  on short length scales, but ceases to operate much beyond the confines of the nucleus. Think about binding energy this way: if we tried to pry a proton or a neutron (nucleon, generically) away from a nucleus, we would encounter a very powerful force opposing the action. But let's say we persist, and do work in extracting the nucleon by the usual recipe of force times distance. It is so much work, in fact, that AE = Amc2 becomes relevant, measurably altering the mass.
  Table 15.5 walks through some example calculations, one of which is traced in Example 15.3.2. Because the 1H nuclide is just a lone proton, it has no binding energy.

  Example 15.3.2 Following the entry in Table 15.5 for 56Fe, we first multiply the individual proton, neutron, and electron masses from Table 15.4 by the 26 protons, 30 neutrons, and 26 electrons comprising 56 Fe to get a sum-of-parts value of 56.46340 a.m.u..17
  The actual mass, as it appears for 56Fe in the Chart of the Nuclides is 55.934942 a.m.u., which is smaller by 0.528447 a.m.u.18
  Since 1a.m.u. is 1.660539×10-27 kg, we can convert this mass difference into kilograms, then multiply by c2, where c = 2.99792458 x 108 m/s to get the associated energy in units of Joules. Traditionally, nuclear physics adopts a more convenient scale of electron-volts, and in particular, the MeV.19 To get our mass-energy difference from Joules to MeV, we divide by 1.6022 × 10-13 J/MeV, and this is the 492 MeV number appearing in the Amc2 column of Table 15.5.
  Finally, we divide by the number of nucleons in the nucleus-A = 56 in this case to determine how much binding energy is present per nucleon-the significance of which will soon become clearer.
  Therefore, the difference between the sum-of-parts mass and actual nucleus mass in Table 15.5 provides a measure of how much binding energy holds the nucleus together.20
  Notice that the first entry in Table 15.5 for the single-proton hydrogen atom has no binding energy in the nucleus: the lonely proton has no other nucleon to which it might bind. But deuterium (2H) has a proton and a neutron, held together by 2.2 MeV of binding energy. The binding

Next is measured electrons, per mass, then the difference. The difference is re-cast in MeV, representing the total bind- ing energy of the nucleus, inexorably rising with the size of the nucleus. The final col- umn divides by the mass number to get binding energy per nucleon, which peaks around iron. See Example 15.3.2 to under- stand how these numbers are computed.

  energy per nucleon in the last column of Table 15.5 starts out small, but soon settles to the 7-9 range for most of the entries. It is extremely insightful to plot the binding energy per nucleon as a function of the nucleon mass number, A, which we do in Figure 15.10.

The value of Figure 15.10 is hard to over-emphasize. Key take-aways
are:
1. Most nuclei are at around 8 MeV per nucleon, meaning that it would take an average of about 8 MeV of energy to rip out each member (proton or neutron) from a nucleus;
2. The peak is at 56Fe,21 meaning that this is the most tightly bound
   nucleus;22
3. The slope on the left side is much steeper than the slope on the right side, after the peak, which speaks to why fusion (building from small to big) is more potent than fission (tearing apart very massive nuclei);
4. Fusion in stars does not build elements beyond the peak around iron, since to go beyond the peak is not energetically favorable.
   It can be helpful to think of Figure 15.10 upside-down, as in Figure 15.11, turning the iron "peak" into a trough. A ball will roll toward and settle near the bottom of the trough, which is what both fusion and fission do, but from opposite directions.

Note in particular that 56Fe sits at the peak of the curve. Fusion operates from left to right, building larger nuclei, and fission goes from right to left, tearing apart nuclei. Only actions that climb this curve are energetically favorable, meaning that fusion is profitable on the the left-hand side, and fission makes sense on the right: each driving toward the peak binding energy per nucleon.

Note that a nuclear fission plant has much in common with a coal-fired power plant, as evidenced by the similarity of Figure 15.12 to Fig. 6.2 (p. 90).

   15.4.1 The Basic Idea
   Out of all the nuclides, three are amenable for use in a fission reactor.
   Two are isotopes of uranium: 233U and 235U; and one is plutonium: 239 Pu. Of these, only 235U is found in nature, so we will concentrate on this one, returning later to the other two when we talk about breeder reactors in Section 15.4.4.2.
   What makes 235U (and the other two) special is that a slow23 neutron- one just bumping around at a speed governed by the local temperature, and thus called a thermal neutron-can walk up to and stick24 to the nucleus and cause it to split into two large chunks-depicted in Figure 15.13. Other nuclei would not break up, just accepting the new neutron and possibly converting a neutron to a proton via ẞ- decay.

   tends to bounce rather than stick to the

   24: No forces prevent a neutron from ap- proaching a nucleus. Happening to hit the tiny nucleus is the only barrier.
   Figure 15.13: Fission schematic for 235U, showing one of many possible outcomes- in this case 90Br and 144La plus two neu- trons (an example case treated in detail in the text). The intermediate state, 236U, cre- ated when 235U absorbs a neutron, is highly unstable and will spontaneously break into (always) two different-size large fragments ("daughter" nuclei) and perhaps some extra neutrons. Gamma rays and kinetic energy (high-velocity fragments) are also released. Note that at each stage, the total number of nucleons is always 236.their way to a halt. Gamma rays25 are also released. By catching all of this energetic output, the surrounding material gets very hot and can be used to make steam.

   15.4.2 Chain Reaction
   As we have seen, in order to get fission to happen, we need 235U and some wandering neutrons. Once fission commences, the breakup of the nucleus usually "drips" a few spare neutrons, like crumbs left after cutting a piece of bread. The left-over neutrons provide a replenished source of neutrons ready to initiate more fission events. Now the door is open for a chain reaction, in which the neutrons produced by the fission events are the very things needed to stimulate additional fission events.
   When the nucleus splits, any extra neutrons come out "hot" (high speed), which tend to bounce off uranium nuclei without sticking. They need to be slowed down, which is accomplished by a moderator: basically light atoms26 that can receive the neutron impact as a sort of damping medium. Then the main trick is to prevent a runaway that could occur if too many neutrons become available; in which case it's a party that can get out of control. So nuclear plants employ control rods containing materials particularly effective at absorbing (trapping) neutrons. The colors of the lower halves of some squares in the Chart of the Nuclides (Figure 15.4) indicate neutron capture cross section. Boron (10B) is a favorite choice to soak up neutrons and tame (or even halt) the reaction. The goal is to maintain a chain reaction that produces a net balance of exactly one unabsorbed slow neutron per fission event, available to attach itself to a waiting 235U nucleus.
   15.4.3 Fission Accounting
   The nucleus (uranium in the present discussion) always breaks up into two largish pieces, possibly accompanied by a few liberated spare neutrons. Because of the way the track of stable elements curves on the Chart of the Nuclides, the resultant pieces are likely to be neutron rich, to the right of the stable nuclei. To understand this, refer to Figure 15.14 and the associated caption.
   The math always has to add up: nucleons are not created or destroyed during a fission event. They just rearrange themselves, so the total number of neutrons stays the same, as does the total number of protons. After the split, ẞ decays will carry out flavor changes, but we'll deal with that part later.

   Figure 15.14: Fission of 235U (small red square, upper right) tends to produce two neutron-rich fragments. If it split exactly in two, the result would lie at the midpoint of the orange line connecting 235U to the origin, at the yellow circle. In practice, an equal split is highly unlikely, as one frag-
   ment tends to be around A 95 and the other around A
   Au
   140, as depicted by the probability histogram in green. The two green stars separated along the orange line represent a more likely outcome for the two fragments. As long as the green stars are located so that the yellow circle is exactly between them, the accounting of proton and neutron number is satisfied. Because the or- ange line lies to the right of the stable nuclei, the fission products tend to be neutron-rich and undergo a series of radioactive ẞ-de- cays before reaching stability, which could take a very long time in some cases.
   90 Br
   Example 15.4.1 If one of the two fragments from the fission of a 235U nucleus (Z = 92) after adding a thermal neutron winds up being (Z = 35), what is the other nucleus going to be?
   =
   The other fragment will preserve total proton count, so Z = 92-35 = 57, and as such is destined to be the element lanthanum. Which isotope of lanthanum is produced depends on how many neutrons escape the split. Table 15.6 summarizes the particle counts of the various players.
   If no spare neutrons are left over, the lanthanum must have N 144 - 55 = 89 neutrons,27 in which case its mass number will be A = 146, so 146 La. If two neutrons are set free, then the lanthanum will only keep 87 neutrons and be 144 La, as depicted in Figure 15.13.
   Typically, about 2-3 neutrons are left out of the final fragments, and can go on to promote additional fission events in the chain reaction.

   Being a probabilistic (random) process, each fission can result in a large set of possible "daughter" nuclei-only one set of which was explored in Example 15.4.1. As long as the masses all add up, and the two-hump probability distribution in Figure 15.14 is respected, anything goes. In other words, we have no control over exactly what pieces come out. Figure 15.15 provides a graphic illustration of four different possible pairs of daughter fragments. The counting requirement is satisfied by having the products located diametrically opposite from the 235U midpoint (yellow circle). The positions of the stars will distribute along A-values

Note the completely distinct peaks, conveying that virtually every fission event results in just two fragments: one bigger and one smaller.

   Figure 15.15: Various fission product out- comes are possible, indicated here by four sets of colored star pairs and connecting lines. The average position of each pair is the yellow circle (the stars are diametrically opposite the circle), which guarantees that the total number of neutrons and protons is unchanged from the parent nucleus to the daughter nuclei. To the extent that addi- tional neutrons are left behind like crumbs, the stars will displace to the left of their indicated positions a bit, as hinted by the lighter-shaded "ghost" stars, whose offsets from the nominal star positions will also vary depending on how many neutrons are left out of the two final fragments. The col- oring of the histogram indicates radioactive lifetime for the decay chain of a neutron-rich fragment at each mass number, matching the half-life color scheme used in Figure

   The masses of each piece, according to the Chart of the Nuclides, appear in Table 15.7. Again, we find that the mass sums don't equal: the final parts are lighter than the inputs. The fission managed to lose 0.185 a.m.u. of mass, corresponding to 172 MeV of energy (via E = mc2; see Example 15.3.1). That's a 0.08% change in the mass, and converts to an energy density of roughly 17 million kcal/g, making the process over a million

   times more energy-dense than our customary ~10 kcal/g chemical energy density. See Box 15.3 for an example of how to compute this.
   Box 15.3: Nuclear Energy Density
   The example corresponding to Table 15.7 is said to correspond to 17 million kcal/g, but how can we get here? The mass change of 0.185 a.m.u. corresponds to a mass in kilograms of 3.07 x 10-28 kg, according to the conversion that 1 a.m.u. is 1.6605 x 10-27 kg (Table 15.4). Multiply this by c2 to get energy in Joules, yielding 2.76 × 10-11 J.29 In terms of kcal, we divide by 4,184 J/kcal to find that this fission event yields 6.6 x 10-15 kcal.
   We now just need to divide by how many grams of "fuel" we supplied, which is 236.05 a.m.u. (Table 15.7), equating to 3.92 × 10-25 kg, or 3.92 × 10-22
   g. Now we divide 6.6 x 10-15 kcal by 3.92 × 10-22 get 16.8 × 106 kcal/g. Blows a burrito out of the water.
   g to
   Example 15.4.2 Considering that the average American uses energy at a rate of 10,000 W, how much 235U per year is needed to satisfy this
   demand for one individual?
   Since we have just computed the energy density of 235U to be 17 × 106 kcal/g (Box 15.3), let's first put the total energy in units of Joules, multiplying 104 W by 3.155 x 107 seconds in a year and then dividing by 4,184 J/kcal to get kilocalories. The result is 75 million kcal, so that an American's annual energy needs could be met by 4.5 g30 of 235U. That translates to about a quarter of a cubic centimeter, or a small pebble, at the density of uranium. Pretty amazing!
   We can take a graphical shortcut to all of Section 15.4.3, which hopefully will tie things together in an instructive way.
   Example 15.4.3 Refer back to Figure 15.10 (and/or Table 15.5) to see that 235U has a binding energy of about 7.6 MeV per nucleon. Where we end up, around A≈ 95 and A≈ 140, the binding energies per nucleon are around 8.7 and 8.4 MeV/nuc at these locations, respectively.
   Multiplying the binding energy per nucleon by the number of nucleons provides a measure of total binding energy: in this case 1,790 MeV for 235U, about 825 MeV for the daughter nucleus around A≈ 95, and 1,175 MeV for A≈ 140.31 Adding the latter two, we find that the fission products have a total binding energy around 2,000 MeV, which is greater32 than the 235U binding energy by about 210 MeV-somewhat close to the 172 MeV computed for the particular example in Table
   15.7.
   The graphical method got us pretty close with little work, and hopefully led to a deeper understanding of what is going on. The rest of this

   paragraph explains the discrepancy, but should be considered non- essential reading. The fission process typically results in a few spare neutrons. Each left-over (unbound) neutron deprives us of at least 8 MeV in unrealized binding potential,33 and the subsequent ẞ- decays from the neutron-rich daughter nuclei to stable nuclei also release energy not accounted in Table 15.7. Both of these contribute to the shortfall in comparing 172 MeV to 210 MeV, but even without this, we got a decent estimate just using the graph in Figure 15.10.
   15.4.4 Practical Implementations
   As we saw above, nuclear fission involves getting fissile nuclei generally 235U-to split apart by the addition of a neutron. The following criteria
   must be met:
1. presence of nuclear fuel (235U);
2. presence of neutrons, provided as left-overs from earlier fission
   events;
3. a moderator to slow down neutrons that emerge from the fission
   events at high speed;
4. a high enough concentration of nuclear fuel that the slowed-down
   spare neutrons are likely to find fissile nuclei;
5. neutron absorbers in the form of control rods that can be lowered into the reactor and act as the main "throttle" to set reaction speed (thus power output), and also prevent a runaway chain reaction; 6. a containment vessel to mitigate radioactive particles (gamma rays, high-speed electrons and positrons) from escaping to the environment.
   Figure 15.16 shows a typical configuration.
   15 Nuclear Energy

   33: Each missing neutron deprives us of more than the standard ~8 MeV per nu- cleon, as neutrons have no penalty for repul- sive electric charge. The 8 MeV per nucleon is an average over protons and neutrons.

   The water acts as the moderator to slow neutrons and also circulates around the rods to carry heat away, boiling to form steam that can run a standard power plant. Control rods set the pace of the reaction based on how far they are inserted into the spaces between fuel rods. Extra control rods are poised above the reactor core ready to drop quickly into the core in case of emergency suddenly bringing the chain reaction to a halt.

   In the design of Figure 15.16, called a boiling water reactor, the water acts as both the neutron moderator and the thermal conveyance medium. Nuclear fuel (uranium) is arranged in fuel rods, providing ample surface area and allowing water to circulate between the rods to slow down neutrons and carry the heat away. Neutron-absorbing control rods- usually containing boron-set the reaction speed by lowering from the top. An emergency set of control rods can be dropped into the core in a big hurry to shut down the reactor instantly if something goes wrong. When the emergency rods are in place, neutrons have little chance of finding a 235U nucleus before being gobbled up by boron.
   34
   As of 2019, the world has about 455 operating nuclear reactors, amounting to an installed capacity of about 400 GW.35 The average produced power— not all are running all the time-was just short of 300 GW. The thermal equivalent would be approximately three times this, or 1 TW out of the 18 TW we use in the world. So nuclear is a relevant player. See Table 15.8 for a breakdown of the top several countries, Fig. 7.7 (p. 109) for nuclear energy's trend in the world, and Fig. 7.4 (p. 107) for the U.S. trend.

35: From this, we glean that reactors aver- age roughly 1 GW each.
Table 15.8: Global nuclear power in 2019 [101], listing number of operational plants, installed capacity, average generation for 2019 (Japan currently has stopped a num- ber of its reactors), percentage of electricity (not total energy), and fraction of global production (these 7 countries accounting for over 75%). Notice the close match be- tween number of plants and GW installed for most countries, indicating that most nu- clear plants deliver about 1 GW.
Nuclear plants only last about 50-60 years, after which the material comprising the core becomes brittle from exposure to damaging ra- dioactivity and must be decommissioned. The median age of reactors in the U.S. is 40 years, and all but three are over 30 years old. Additional challenges will be addressed in the sections that follow.
When nuclear energy was first being rolled out in the 1950s, the catch phrase was that it would be "too cheap to meter," a sentiment presumably fueled by the stupendous energy density of uranium, requiring very small quantities compared to fossil fuels. The reality has not worked out that way. Today, a 1 GW nuclear power plant may cost $9 billion to build [102]. That's $9 per Watt of output power, which we can compare to the cost of a solar panel, at about $0.50 per W (Fig. 13.16; p. 215), or utility-scale installation at $1 per Watt [89]. While it seems that solar36 wins by a huge margin, the low capacity factor of solar reduces average power output to 10-20% of the peak rating, depending on location. Meanwhile, nuclear reactors tend to run steadily 90% of the time-the off-time used for maintenance and fuel loading. So nuclear fission costs about $10 per delivered Watt, while solar panels are $2.5-5 per delivered

Watt and installed utility-scale systems are $5-10 per Watt. In short, nuclear power is not an economic slam dunk.

So far, we have ignored a crucial fact. Only 0.72% of natural uranium on Earth is the fissile 235U flavor. The vast majority, 99.2745%, is the benign 238.37 The ratio is about 140:1, so for every 235U atom pulled out of the ground, 140 times this number of uranium atoms must be extracted. The origin of the disparity is a story of astrophysics and eons, covered in Box 15.4.
Box 15.4: Origin of Uranium
The Big Bang that formed the universe produced only the lightest nuclei. By-and-large, the result was 75% hydrogen (H) and 25% helium (4He). Deuterium (2H) and 3He were produced at the 0.003% and 0.001% levels, respectively, and then the tiniest trace of lithium. No carbon or oxygen emerged, which must be "cooked up" via fusion in stars.
Fusion in stars does not "climb over" the peak of the binding-energy curve in Figure 15.10, so stops in the vicinity38 of iron. From where, then, did all of the heavier elements on the periodic table derive? Exploding stars called supernovae and merging neutron stars appear to be the origin of elements beyond zinc.
The relative abundance of 235U and 238U on Earth can be explained by their different half-lives of 0.704 Gyr and 4.47 Gyr, respectively. Even if starting at comparable amounts, most of the 235U will have decayed away by now. Solving backwards39 to when they would have been present in equal amounts yields about 6 Gyr, which is older than the age of the solar system (4.5 Gyr) and younger than the universe (13.8 Gyr). This is a reasonable result for how old the astrophysical origin might be allowing a billion years or so for the material to coalesce in our forming solar system.
Uranium is not particularly abundant. Table 15.9 provides a sense of how prevalent various elements are in the earth's crust. Uranium is more abundant than silver, but the useful 235U isotope is four times rarer than silver, and only about 5 times as abundant as gold. Proven reserves of uranium [103] amount to 7.6 million (metric) tons available, and we have used 2.8 million metric tons to date. The implication is that we could continue about 3 times longer than we have gone so far on proven reserves. But nuclear energy has played a much smaller role than fossil fuels, so maybe this isn't so much.
Evaluating the uranium reserves in energy terms is the most revealing
37: A trace amount, 0.0055%, is in 234U.
38: Iron has Z = 26; stars tend not to pro- duce elements beyond zinc (Z 30) by fusion.

approach. First, we take 0.72% of the 7.6 million tons available to represent the portion of uranium in the form of 235U. Enrichment (next section) will not separate all of the 235U, and the reactor can't burn all of it away before the fuel rod is essentially useless. So optimistically, we burn half of the mined 235U in the reactor. Multiplying the resulting 27,300 tons of usable 235U by the 17 million kcal/g we derived earlier yields a total of 2×1021 J. Table 15.10 puts this in context against fossil fuel proven reserves from page 127. We see from this that proven uranium reserves give us only 20% as much energy as our proven oil reserves, and about 5% of our total remaining fossil fuel supply. If we tried to get all 18 TW from this uranium supply, it would last less than 4 years! This does not sound like a salvation.
Proven uranium reserves would last 90 years at the current rate of use, so really it is in a category fairly similar to that of fossil fuels in terms of finite supply. To be fair, proven reserves are always a conservative lower limit on estimated total resource availability. And since fuel cost is not the limiting factor for nuclear plants, higher uranium prices can make more available, from more difficult deposits. Still, even a factor of two more does not transform the story into one of an ample, worry-free
resource.

15.4.4.2 Breeder Reactors
In its native form, 235U is too dilute in natural uranium-overwhelmingly dominated by 238U-to even work in a nuclear reactor. It must be enriched to 3-5% concentration to become viable.40 Enrichment is difficult to achieve. Chemically, 235U and 238U behave identically. The masses are so close just 1% different-that mechanical processes have a difficult time differentiating. Centrifuges are commonly used to allow heavier 238U to sink faster41 than 235U. But it's inefficient and usually requires many iterations to work up higher concentrations. The process is also lossy, in that not all of the 235U finds its way to the enriched pile.42
But what if we could use the bulk uranium, 238U, in reactors and not only save ourselves the hassle of enrichment, but also gain access to 140 times more material, in effect? Doing so would turn the proven reserves of uranium into about 7 times more energy supply than all of our remaining fossil fuels. Well, it turns out that despite its not being

The result is that sterile 238U can be turned into fissile 239Pu that can be used in fission reactors. This process of transmuting an inert nucleus into a fissile one is called breeding, and is how we get any plutonium at all.44 A nuclear reactor is a great place to introduce 238U to neutrons: both are already in attendance. In fact, breeding happens as a matter of course in a nuclear reactor: it is estimated that one-third of the fission

energy in ordinary nuclear reactors comes from plutonium breeding and subsequent fissioning-without any extra effort. Special reactor designs enhance plutonium production, allowing the fuel rod to be "harvested" for plutonium. Usually, the plutonium is destined for use in weapons, but in principle reactors could be designed to efficiently produce and use plutonium from the 238U feedstock. Downsides will be addressed in Section 15.4.6 on weapons and proliferation.
Box 15.5: Thorium Breeding
Another form of breeding merits mention. Notice that thorium45 is more abundant than uranium in Table 15.9. But like 238U, it is not fissile. However, applying the breeding trick, the absorption of a neutron by 232Th ends up as 233U-the last of our three fissile nuclei in about a month's time. This provides an avenue for an even greater energy store than exists in 238U via breeding to 239 Pu, by virtue of greater abundance. Unlike the plutonium route, thorium breeders are less susceptible to weapons and proliferation concerns.46 That said, thorium reactors are more complex than uranium reactors, so that technical hurdles have thus far prevented any commercial scale application of the technique, leaving us unclear whether thorium represents a viable nuclear path.

15.4.5 Nuclear Waste
As we saw in our description of the fission process, the fragments distribute over a range of masses in a randomized way (Figure 15.15). The results are generally neutron-rich, and will migrate toward stable elements via ẞ decays over the ensuing seconds, hours, days, months, and years. Some will go fast, and some will take ages to settle, depending on half-lives. Radioactive waste is dangerous to be around because the high-energy particles (like sub-atomic "bullets") spewing out in all directions can alter DNA, leading to cancer and birth defects, for instance.
The lighter of the two fission fragments has a 59% chance of landing on a stable nucleus within a day or so. For the heavier fragment, it's a 45% chance. The rest get hung up on some longer half-life nuclide, and could remain radioactive for a matter of weeks or in some cases millions of years. The colors in the fission probability histograms in Figure 15.15 provide a visual guide for the mass numbers that reach stability promptly (gray) vs. those that get hung up for a long time (blue is more than 10 years). For example, the histogram element at A = 90 is blue because 90Sr-discussed below-stands in the way of a fast path to stability.

Figure 15.19 shows how the fission decays play out over time. For the first month or so out of the reactor, the spent fuel is really "hot" radioactively, but falls quickly as 95Zr and then 144 Ce dominate around one year out. At about 5 years, the pair of 90Sr and 137Cs begin to dominate the output for the next few-hundred years. Some of the products survive for millions of years, albeit at low levels of radioactive power. In addition to the daughter fragments, uranium in the presence of neutrons transmutes into neptunium, plutonium, americium, and curium via neutron absorption and subsequent ẞ decays, represented approximately and collectively in Figure 15.19 by a dashed curve labeled Actinides. 47
The bottom line is that fission leaves a trash heap of radioactive waste that remains at problematic levels for many thousands of years. When nuclear reactors were first built, they were provisioned with holding tanks deep pools of water-in which to place the waste fuel until a more permanent arrangement could be sorted out (Figure 15.20). We are still waiting for an adequate permanent solution for waste storage, and the "temporary" pools are just accumulating spent fuel. Transporting the spent fuel is hazardous-in part because it could fall into the wrong hands and be used to make "dirty" bombs—and no one wants a nuclear waste facility in their backyard, making the problem politically thorny. On the technical side, it is difficult to identify sites that are geologically stable enough and have little chance of groundwater contamination. Underground salt domes offer an interesting possibility, but political challenges remain daunting.
Figure 15.19: Decay activity of fragments from 1 kg of fissioned 235U over time, on a log-log plot. The vertical axis is the power of radioactive emission, in W, for a variety of relevant isotopes-each having their own characteristic half life. The black line at the top is the total activity (sum of all contribu- tions), and some of the key individuals are separated out. The dashed line for actinides is an approximate representative indicator of the role played by heavy nuclides formed in the reactor by uranium absorption of neu- trons. Minor tick marks are at multipliers of 2, 4, 6, and 8 for each axis. As a matter of possible interest, the exponential decays of each element on this log-log plot have the functional form of exponential curves drawn upside-down.
47: Breeder reactors can "burn" the ac- tinides, reducing some of the long-term waste threat, but will unavoidably still be left with all the radioactive fission products.

15.4.6 Nuclear Weapons and Proliferation
Nuclear bombs are the most destructive weapons we have managed to create. The first bombs from the 1940s were based on either highly enriched 235U or on 239Pu. For uranium bombs, the idea is shockingly simple. Two separate lumps of the bomb material are held apart until detonation is desired, at which point they are slammed together.48 It's not the collision that creates the explosion, but a runaway process based on having a high concentration of fissile material and no neutron absorbers present to control the resulting chain reaction. The concept is critical mass. The combined lump exceeds the critical mass, and explodes.49
As simple as nuclear weapons are to build, the bottleneck becomes obtaining fissile material. Plutonium does not exist in nature, since its 24,100 yr half-life means nothing is left over from the astrophysical processes that gave us uranium and thorium (Box 15.4). We only still have the latter two thanks to their long half lives. So fissile material has to start with uranium. But as we have seen, natural uranium is only 0.72% fissile (235U). In order to be explosive, the uranium must be enriched to at least 20% 235U, and generally much higher (85%). Reactor fuel, at 3-5% 235U will experience meltdown if the critical mass is exceeded, but will not explode. Enrichment is technically difficult, and attempts to acquire and enrich uranium are monitored closely. Often we hear of countries pursuing uranium enrichment, claiming that they are only interested in domestic energy production-a peaceful purpose. And it is true that the first step in nuclear power generation is also enrichment. So it is very difficult to ascertain true intentions. Once a country has the ability to enrich uranium enough for a nuclear plant, they can in principle keep the process running longer to arrive at weapons-grade 235U.
While we worry about 235U falling into the wrong hands, perhaps more disturbing is 239Pu. Having a much shorter half-life than 235U (24 kyr vs. 704 Myr), it is more dangerous to handle.50 But plutonium is otherwise easy to deal with, since it requires no enrichment and can be chemically separated to achieve purity. It is the material of choice for nuclear weapons.
Serious pursuit of breeder reactors effectively means manufacturing lots of plutonium, leading to proliferation of nuclear materials: it becomes harder to track and keep away from mal-intentioned groups. The world becomes more dangerous under a breeder program. Thorium breeding (Box 15.5) is less risky in this regard because the 233U prize is mixed with a ridiculously dangerous 232U isotope that puts plutonium to shame, so working with it is pretty deadly, which may deter would-be pursuit of this material by rogue groups.
A related concern involves proliferation of the abundant radioactive waste from fission plants, which could be mixed into conventional ex- plosives31 to radioactively contaminate a city or local region-poisoning

15.4.7 Nuclear Safety
A properly operating nuclear facility actually emits less radioactivity than does a traditional coal-fired power plant! As is true for many materials mined from the ground, coal contains some small amount of radioactive elements found in the earth's crust: principally thorium, uranium, and potassium. Lacking any shielding or protection, the exhaust from a coal plant distributes these products into the atmosphere. Nuclear plants, by contrast, have no exhaust,52 and carefully control the exposure to radioactivity.
However, things can go wrong. The U.S. had a scare in 1979 when a six-month-old nuclear plant at Three Mile Island in Pennsylvania (Figure 15.21) suffered a loss-of-cooling incident that resulted in severe damage to (meltdown of) the core. But the containment vessel held and no significant radioactivity was released to the environment. Workers at the plant received a dose equivalent to an extra 100 days of natural53 exposure. So we dodged a bullet.
Chernobyl was not so lucky in April 1986 when an ill-conceived test went sideways and resulted in an actual explosion of the core. This scenario was previously thought to be impossible, but it was a steam explosion, not a nuclear blast-so more like a "dirty bomb" that scattered radioactive material across the region. Thirty-one people died in the immediate aftermath, and about 200 people got acute radiation sickness. It is estimated that in the long term, 25,000 to 50,000 additional cancer cases will result, but this number is controversial and it is hard to tease Chernobyl-caused cancer/deaths apart from the much larger number of background cancer cases. The town of Chernobyl is still abandoned and only recently has begun to allow strictly limited incursions.
The most recent major accident was the Fukushima Daiichi plant in Japan following the Sendai earthquake in March 2011, resulting in the evacuation of 200,000 people and agricultural loss. The earthquake caused the three operating reactors to shut down (safely), while diesel- fueled generators ran to power pumps maintaining cooling flow over the hot fuel rods. The core of a reactor is still very hot after fission stops and continues to generate heat as daughter nuclei decay, so cooling flow must be maintained or the core can melt. The ensuing tsunami54 ruined the plan to keep the cores cool, as the generator rooms flooded, causing the cooling flow to fail. The cores of all three reactors melted down and hydrogen gas explosions created a major release of radioactivity. Perhaps in contrast to the Chernobyl plant, Fukushima was designed by General Electric and operated by a well-educated high-tech society. No one is exempt from risk when it comes to nuclear reactors.

15.4.8 Pros and Cons of Fission
Collecting the advantages and disadvantages of fission, we start with the positive aspects:
▸ Nuclear fuel has extraordinary energy density, about a million
times better than chemical energy density;
► Nuclear fission is proven technology providing a substantial frac- tion of electrical energy at present;
► Life-cycle CO2 emissions for nuclear fission is only 2% that of traditional fossil fuel electricity [68];
Breeder reactors could provide thousands of years of fuel, by way of uranium and thorium (undeveloped as yet).
And for the downsides:
and no
Radioactive waste is dangerous for thousands of years, clear solution to its disposal or long-term storage has emerged.
► Conventional uranium fission has limited fuel supply, measuring in decades;
55
Breeder reactors exacerbate the waste issue and promote prolifera- tion of nuclear materials;
► Development of nuclear energy technology prepares an easy step to immensely destructive nuclear weapons;
► Accidents happen even to the best-managed reactors, the conse- quences often being severe for a region.
Nuclear fission is a complex topic that has compelling advantages and worrisome faults. Not surprisingly, attitudes are highly mixed. One survey [104] indicates that adults in the U.S. oppose building more nuclear plant by a slim 51% to 45%, while scientists overall favor advancing nuclear plants by a 2:1 margin,56 and physicists surveyed favored nuclear by 4:1. Scientists are much more likely to view climate change as a serious threat than the U.S. population as a whole, and therefore are likely to be attracted to energy resources that do not emit CO2. Of the physicists surveyed, it would be a mistake to assume that even the majority know the topic as thoroughly as it is covered in this chapter-given the degree of specialization within the field. Among those who understand the topic thoroughly57 it is almost certain you'd find a healthy split: those for whom the perils outweigh advantages, and those who are concerned enough about climate change to accept the "lesser of two evils," and/or who are enthusiastic about the technology as a glowing example of our mastery over nature's hidden secrets.
15.5 Fusion
Given that fission has problems of finite uranium supply, radioactive waste, proliferation and weapons, and safety issues, its future is uncertain.

Fusion, on the other hand, is not plagued by most of these issues. It's main problem is that it is incredibly difficult and has been in the research stage for 70 years. Other than that, it has many (virtual) virtues. To be clear, the world does not have and never has had an operational fusion power plant. It may belong to the future, but is not guaranteed to ever become practical.
58
First, the basics. We have alluded to the fact that fusion builds from the small to the big. Putting four 1H nuclei together, at 1.007825 a.m.u. each and forming *He at 4.0026033 a.m.u. leaves a difference of 0.0287 a.m.u.— 0.7% of the total mass-which amounts to 153 million kcal/g. This is almost ten times as large as the amount for fission (17 million kcal/g; Box 15.3), making it ten-million times more potent than chemical reactions. Recall that fusion's better performance can be related to the steepness of the left-hand-side of the binding-energy-per-nucleon curve of Figure 15.10.
What makes fusion so difficult is that getting protons to stick together is incredibly hard. Their electric repulsion is so strong that they need to be approaching each other at a significant fraction of the speed of light (about 7%) in order to get within reach of the strong nuclear force that takes over at distances smaller than about 10-15 m. The corresponding temperature is a billion degrees.59 Even the center of the sun is "only" 16 million degrees. The sun has the advantage of being enormous, though. So even at a comparatively chilly 16 million degrees, some rare protons by chance will be going extra fast and have enough oomph to overcome the repulsion and stick together. It's like winning the lottery against very long odds, but the sun is large enough to buy ample tickets so the process still happens often enough.60 We don't have such a luxury in a terrestrial laboratory setting, so we need higher temperatures than what exists in the center of the sun!
Using 2H nuclei (deuterons, labeled D) instead of 1H (protons) in what is called a D-D fusion reactor, allows operation at 100 million degrees instead of 1 billion. And colliding one deuteron with a triton61 (3H nucleus, labeled T; 12.3 year half-life), only requires 45 million degrees for a D-T fusion reactor. For this reason, only D-T fusion is currently pursued.
For all three types, the relevant reactions62 are:
P-p: 1H+1H+1H+1H →He
D-D:
D-T:
+ 26.7 MeV
  2H + 2H →>> 4 He
+ 23.8 MeV 2H+3H4He + n + 17.6 MeV
  (15.3)
  But the 45 million degrees required for D-T fusion is still frightfully hard to achieve. No containers will withstand temperatures beyond a few thousand degrees. Containment-or confinement-is the big challenge then. The multi-million degree plasma63 cannot be permitted to touch the

58: The calculation is that 0.0287 a.m.u. cor- responds to Am = 4.8 x 10-29 kg, or E Amc2 4.2 x 10-12 J (26.7 MeV). We con- vert the Joules to kcal by dividing by 4,184, and then divide by the input mass in grams (4.03 a.m.u. times 1.6605 x 10-24 g/a.m.u.) to get 153 kcal/g. Starting with two deu- terium nuclei reduces energy yield a bit to to 137 kcal/g, and for deuterium-tritium reactions it's down to 81 million kcal/g.
59: For temperatures this high, it does not matter whether we specify Kelvin or Cel- sius, as the 273 degree difference is nothing compared to a billion degrees. The scales are therefore essentially identical here.
60: This is no accident: if the center were too
cool, the sun would contract in the absence of radiation pressure until the center heated up from the compression and nuclear fusion ignited just enough to hold off further contraction. It finds its own equilibrium right at the edge of fusion. In the case of the sun, all it takes is one out of
every 1026 collisions to stick in order to keep the lights
on.

walls of the chamber, despite its constituents zipping around at speeds around 1,000 km/s! This feat can be sort-of managed via magnetic fields bending the paths of the fast-moving charged particles into circles. But turbulence in the plasma plagues attempts to confine the D-T mixture at temperatures high enough to produce fusion yield.
Box 15.6: Successful Fusion
Note that besides stars as an example of successful fusion, we have managed to create artificial fusion in a net-energy-positive manner in the form of the hydrogen bomb. This is indeed a fusion device, but we could not call it controlled fusion. It actually takes a fission bomb (plutonium) right next to the D-T mixture in a hydrogen bomb to heat up the D-T enough to undergo fusion. It's neat (and awful) that it works and is demonstrated, but it's no way to run a power plant.
If a 45 million degree plasma could be confined in a stable fashion, the heat generated by the reactions64 could be used to make steam and run a traditional power plant-replacing the flame symbol in Fig. 6.2 (p. 90) with something much fancier. The scheme, therefore, requires first heating a plasma to unbelievable temperatures in order for the plasma to self-generate enough additional heat through fusion that the game shifts to one of keeping the plasma cool enough to produce a steady rate of fusion without blowing itself out. In this scenario, the heat extracted from the cooling flow makes steam. It's the most elaborate 65 possible source of heat to boil water. It may be a bit like working hard to develop a light saber whose only use will be as a letter opener.
15.5.1 Fuel Abundance
66
Deuterium-an isotope of hydrogen-is found in 0.0115% of hydrogen, which means that the occasional H2O molecule is actually HDO.67 Therefore sea water is chock-full of deuterium. The global 18 TW appetite would need 3 × 1032 deuterium atoms per year for D-D or 2 x 1032 each of deuterium and tritium atoms per year for D-T. Running with this latter number for the comparatively easier D-T reaction, we would need to process 9 x 1035 water molecules each year to find the requisite deuterium. This corresponds to 26 million tons of water, which is a cubic volume about 300 m on a side. Yes, that's large, but the ocean is larger. Also, it corresponds to a volume of 0.16 billion barrels per year, which is about 200 times smaller than our annual oil consumption. Thus, the volume required should be not at all challenging.68 The ocean volume is 60 billion times larger than our 300-m-sided cube, implying that we have enough deuterium for 60 billion years. The sun will not live that long, so let's say that we have sufficient deuterium on Earth.

Tritium, however, is essentially nowhere to be found, as it has a half-life of 12.3 years. We can generate tritium by adding a neutron to lithium and stimulating an a decay. So the question moves to how much lithium we have. Proven reserves are at about 15 million tons, currently produced at about 30,000 tons per year.69 We would need 2,300 tons70 of lithium per year to meet our 2 × 1032 tritium atom target (for 18 TW). In the absence of competition"1 for lithium resources, the associated R/P ratio timescale is 6,500 years. Yes, that is a comfortably long time, but not eons. The thought is that this would buy time to solve the D-D challenge.

15.5.2 Fusion Realities
It is clear why people get excited by fusion. It seems like an unlimited supply that can last thousands if not billions of years at today's rate of energy demand. For some perspective, think about what else we know that lasts billions of years. We already have a giant fusion reactor parked 150 million kilometers away that requires no mining, servicing, or any attention whatsoever. In this sense, the sun is essentially as inexhaustible as fusion promises to be, but already working and free of charge. Photovoltaic panels plus batteries work today and have already shown a possible path to eternal energy. The author built his own off-grid solar setup on a budget that's tiny compared to the fusion enterprise.
As for the fusion enterprise, an effort called ITER (Figure 15.23) in southern France is an international effort currently constructing a plasma confinement machine that aims to commence experimental D-T fusion by the year 2035 via occasional 8-minute pulses of 0.5 GW thermal power. This machine is a stepping stone that is not designed to produce electricity. Estimates for construction cost range from $22 billion to $65 billion. By comparison, a nuclear fission plant costs $6-9 billion to build. Admittedly, the first experimental facility is going to cost more, but it is hard to imagine fusion ever being a real steal, financially. Even if the fuel is free, so what? Solar is the same.
An effort in the U.S. called the nuclear ignition facility (NIF) is pursuing a different approach to fusion research: attempting to implode a tiny sphere of D-T mixture by blasting it with 192 converging laser beams, crushing it to enormous pressure exceeding that in a star's interior, leading to an explosive release of heat. The building, mostly taken up by gigantic lasers, is the size of three football fields and has so far cost something to the tune of $10 billion. Again, this experimental facility is not provisioned to harness any net energy gain?2 to create electricity.
72
Let's say
that by the year 2050, we will have mastered the art and can build a 1 GW electrical-output73 fusion plant for $15 billion. That's $15 per Watt of output, which we can compare to a present-day solar utility-scale installation cost of $1 per peak Watt [89]. Applying typical capacity factors74 puts fusion at twice what solar costs already, today.

Fusion is therefore a complicated and not particularly cheap way to generate electricity. Meanwhile, we are not running terribly short on renewable ways to produce electricity: solar; wind; hydroelectric; geother- mal; tidal. Liquid fuels for transportation represent a greater and more pressing challenge, and fusion does not directly address this aspect any better than other options for electrical production. Fusion is by far the most complex power generation scheme we have ever attempted, evidenced by the 70 year effort to bring it to fruition that is still underway. How many physics PhDs will it take to keep a fusion plant running? Sometimes, we get stuck pursuing a flawed vision of the future, and have trouble reevaluating our options. Imagine being a middle-aged physicist or engineer in the 1950s. In your lifetime, you would have seen the advent of the car, airplane, radio, television, nuclear fission, among a blur of other technology advances. The next frontier was obviously fusion, so let's crack that one! At this point, 70 years later, maybe we should ask: why?
And let's point out that fusion is not without its waste challenges. It is still a radioactive environment, albeit not one that produces dangerous direct products (4He is okay!). It does involve a radioactive fuel source (tritium), and it does embed the containment vessel with high energy particles and neutrons that over time compromise the integrity of the vessel so that it must be discarded as a radioactively-charged hunk of metal.75
By comparison, solar, wind, and other renewable sources based on the sun have no such problems. All of the nastiness is created in the sun, and stays in the sun.

15.5.3 Pros and Cons of Fusion
Collecting the advantages and disadvantages of fusion, we start with the positive attributes:
► Fusion would enjoy an inexhaustible supply of deuterium, easily accessed, outlasting the sun;
The fusion reactor would serve as a heat source for tried-and-true steam-driven power plant technology.
And now the not-so-good aspects:
Stable plasmas are exceedingly hard to generate at the requisite temperatures;
➤ 70
70 years of effort have not yet borne fruit as an energy supply;
► Tritium is not available, and must be fabricated from a limited supply of lithium;
Fusion still contends with radioactive fuel (tritium) and a contain- ment vessel that is radioactively contaminated.

The smaller number of positive points is not in itself an indicator of imbalance, since the first point is huge. One elephant can balance dozens of kids on a playground see-saw.
15.6 Upshot on Nuclear
Nuclear fission is a real thing: it can and does produce a significant fraction the world's power. A number of substantive challenges stand in the way of scaling up significantly.76 For conventional nuclear fission as it has been practiced thus far, the proven reserves of uranium only last 90 years at today's rate of use, and less than 4 years if we tried to get all 18 TW from fission. Radioactive waste is an unsolved problem that persists for hundreds to thousands of years. Breeder programs can extend the resource by large factors (into the 500 or 1,000 year range under an 18 TW nuclear-breeder effort). But proliferation and bomb dangers become more pronounced-not to mention an even more pressing waste issue and greater accident rates given the profusion of operating reactors. It can be difficult to get excited about a nuclear future. It is
very cool that we figured out how to do it. But just because we can do something does not mean it is a good idea to scale it up.
Fusion is a harder prospect to pin down. At present, it is not on the table, having never been demonstrated in a viable reactor capable of producing commercial-scale electricity. But even if we did manage it, how could it compete economically, as complex as it is? Even if the fuel itself is free," it may turn out to be the most expensive form of electricity we could muster. Fusion is not without radioactivity concerns, and placed side-by-side, solar can look a lot better-intermittency being the crippling drawback, necessitating storage.
77
Nuclear options cause us to grapple with the question: who are we? What is our identity? What are our aims, and where do we see ourselves going? Are we plotting a course for a Star Trek future, in which case it seems we have little choice but to adopt the highest-tech solutions. Or are we aiming for a more modest future more aligned with natural ecosystems on Earth? So even if we can do something, does it mean we're obligated to? Sometimes the costs may be too high.
15.7 Problems
1. If an atom were scaled up to be comparable to the extent of a mid-sized campus, how large would the nucleus be, and what sort of familiar object would be similar?

   stable nuclei exist?
6. What are the only three long-lived radioactive isotopes in the portion of the Chart of the Nuclides appearing in Figure 15.4, and which one lives the longest (how long)?
   79
7. Cosmic rays impinging on our atmosphere generate radioactive 14C from 14N nuclei.78 These 14C atoms soon team up with oxygen to form CO2, so that plants absorbing CO2 from the air will have about one in a trillion of their carbon atoms in this form. Animals eating these plants will also have this fraction of carbon in their bodies, until they die and stop cycling carbon into their bodies. At this point, the fraction of carbon atoms in the form of 14C in the body declines, with a half life of 5,715 years. If you dig up a human skull, and discover that only one-eighth of the usual one-trillionth of carbon atoms are 14C, how old do you deem the skull to be?
8. If a friend creates a nucleus whose half-life is 4 hours and gives it to you at noon, what is the probability that it will not have decayed by noon the following day?

9. In close analog to the half-lives of 235U and 238U, let's say two
   elements have half lives of 4.5 billion years and 750 million years. If we start out having the same number of each (1:1 ratio), what will the ratio be after 4.5 billion years? Express as x:1, where x is the larger of the two.
10. Control rods in nuclear reactors tend to contain 10B, which has a high neutron absorption cross section.81 What happens to this nucleus when it absorbs a neutron, and is the result stable? If not, track the decay chain until it lands on a stable nucleus.
11. If someone managed to create a 14B nucleus, what would its fate be? Track the decay chain on Figure 15.4-indicating the type of decay at each step-until it reaches stability, and indicate how long each step is likely to take.

    How much mass does this translate to via E = mc2? Rock has a density approximately 3 times that of water, translating to about 3 mg per cubic millimeter. So roughly how big would a chunk of rock material be to provide a year's worth of energy if converted to pure energy? Is it more like dust, a grain of sand, a pebble, a rock, a boulder, a hill, a mountain?

24. A particular fission of 235U + n (total A = 236) breaks up. One fragment has Z = 54 and N = 86, making it 140 Xe. If no extra neutrons are produced in this event, what must the other fragment be, so all numbers add up? Refer to a periodic table (e.g., Fig. B.1; p. 375) to learn which element has the corresponding Z value, and express the result in the notation AX.

30. Since each nuclear plant delivers ~1 GW of electrical power, at ~40% thermodynamic efficiency this means a thermal generation rate of 2.5 GW. How many nuclear plants would we need to supply all 18 TW of our current energy demand? Since a typical lifetime is 50 years before decommissioning, how many days, on average would it be between new plants coming online (while old ones are retired) in a steady state?
31. Extending Problem 16 toward what actually happens, we know from Table 15.7 that the change in mass (which was close to 1 kg in Prob. 16) is only 0.08% of the 235U mass.84 Furthermore, a fresh fuel rod is only 5% 235U-the rest being 238U. So how much total uranium 85 must be loaded into the reactor each year, if all the 235U is used up?86

    needs. But given realities that only 0.08% of mass is converted to energy in nuclear reactions, that only 0.72% of natural uranium. is fissile 235U, and that only half of the 235U is retrievable88 and "burned" in reactors, how many tons of uranium must be mined per year to support 18 TW via conventional fission, assuming for the sake of this problem that 5 tons of mass need to convert to energy via E = mc2?
33. Based on the abundance of 235U in the earth's crust (Table 15.9), how many kilograms of typical crust would need to be excavated and processed per year to provide the~ 0.005 kg of 235U you
    need for your personal energy (as in Example 15.4.2)?
34. In crude terms, proven uranium reserves could go another 90 years at the present rate of use. But the world gets only about a tenth of its electricity from nuclear. What does this imply about the timescale for the uranium supply if the world got all of its electricity from conventional (non-breeding) nuclear fission?
35. Replicate the calculation and show the work that if we have 2×1021 J of proven uranium reserves under conventional fission, we would exhaust our supply in less than 4 years if using this source to support the entire 18 TW global energy appetite.
36. Use Figure 15.18 to reconstruct the breeder route from 232Th to 233 U by describing the associated nuclei and decays (and half-lives)

37. For spent nuclear fuel a few decades old, what isotopes are respon-
    sible for most of the radioactivity, according to Figure 15.19?
38. Let's say that spent fuel rods are pulled out of the holding pool at the nuclear facility ten years after they came out of the core. Based on the total radioactive power from waste products (black line on Figure 15.19), approximately how long will you have to wait until the radioactivity level is down by another factor of 1,000 from where it is at the time of extraction?
39. Operating approximately 450 nuclear plants over about 60 years at a total thermal level of 1 TW, we have had two major radioactive releases into the environment. If we went completely down the nuclear road and get all 18 TW89 this way, what rate of accidents might we expect, if the rate just scales with usage levels?
40. On balance, considering the benefits and downsides of conven- tional nuclear fission, where do you come down in terms of support for either terminating, continuing, or expanding our use of this technology? Should we pursue breeder reactors at a large scale? Please justify your conclusion based on the things you consider to be most important.

    This short chapter serves to round out the menu of renewable energy options. While all of the entries are viable, at various levels of demonstra- tion and implementation, none of them can scale up to be an important contributor to global power at the relevant level of many terawatts. In this sense, we might call the remaining resources "cute." Because of this, items are kept brief-not warranting unjustified attention. Likewise for graphical adornment: the chapter is a little bare, in part because the subjects do not deserve much in the way of undue promotion.
    Skipping this chapter will not sacrifice much in the way of knowledge vital to our future. It simply fills in the gaps and addresses some of the "but what about insert-scheme?" questions that may arise. The next chapter, Chapter 17, highlights the pros and cons of the full range of alternative energy resources, so this installment largely exists to provide a basis for the conclusions of that more important capstone.
    16.1 Geothermal Energy
    The interior of Earth is still hot from the initial collapse of mass in the formation of the planet. We can think of this as the thermal conversion of gravitational potential energy as pieces fell into the gravitational field of the earth, converting first to kinetic energy and then into thermal energy (heat) after collision. But that's only half of the story. The other half is radioactive decay of long-lived unstable elements within the earth [106]. Of the radioactive decay part, 40% is from uranium (238U), 40% is from thorium (232Th), and 20% is from potassium (40K). As was indicated in Table 10.2 (p. 168), a total of 44 TW of geothermal power flows through the earth's crust. Divided by total surface area, this amounts to less than

    16.1.1 Sustainable Harvest
    Let's evaluate what it would take to tap into the steady 44 TW geothermal heat flow in order to provide some or all of today's 18 TW energy demand. In this way, we could be assured of steady flow for billion-year timescales, as the half lives of the radioactive elements measure in the billions of years and the residual heat of formation is still slowly leaking out after 4.5 billion years. On the face of it, 44 TW compared to 18 TW would suggest that geothermal has margin to spare.
    In order to utilize geothermal energy for most of the things we do, we really need to turn the heat into a versatile form of energy like electricity. The only exception would be for heating water and air spaces. Otherwise, it is not hot enough to perform most industrial process demands, like melting metals. We know how to turn a temperature difference into electricity, via a heat engine (Sec. 6.4; p. 88). We saw that the theoretical efficiency of a heat engine is

    where the hot and cold thermal reservoirs are at temperatures Th and Te, and AT is the difference.
    A typical temperature gradient in the earth's crust is 25°C per kilometer, meaning that the temperature rises by another 25°C for each kilometer of depth. A heat engine constructed to operate between the surface (288 K average) and 1 km down (313 K) could expect a maximum thermodynamic efficiency of 8%. Now imagine an ambitious deployment across 100% of land (29% of the globe): 8% of 29% of the original 44 TW flow is down to a paltry 1 TW.2 And that's if achieving the theoretical maximum efficiency limit3 and somehow accessing the entire flow of heat 1 km down through a network of pipes across every bit of land area on Earth. Can you imagine the scale of this effort? And for all that, it would fall well short of 1 TW, considering practical limitations. Don't hold your breath for this long-term-sustainable form of geothermal energy to provide an answer to our 18 TW appetite.
    Box 16.1: Deeper and Oceans, Too
    While the ambitious global-scale 1 km deep geothermal network was disappointing in its output, the mathematical solution is to "just"5 use the entire globe and dig deeper, allowing a larger thermal gradient and therefore higher efficiency, according to Eq. 16.1. Allowing for
    2: 44 TW x 0.08 x 0.29 ≈ 1 TW.
    3: Typically, we fall short by a factor of two.
    4: In fact, the continental share of the steady geothermal flow-29% of 44 TW-is only 13 TW and not enough to satisfy demand even at the impossible-to-realize efficiency of 100%.

    engineering challenges that may limit us to half the theoretical efficiency, we would have to capture 36 TW of theoretical flow to end up at 18 TW. Now we need a theoretical efficiency of 82%, translating to Th of 1,600 K, which would be about 50 km down: deeper than the earth's crust is thick.
    For context, the deepest mine is less than 4 km deep, and the deepest drill hole is about 12 km. So outfitting 100% of Earth's surface- including under the oceans-with a dense thermal collection grid 50 km down sounds like pure fantasy.
    6: 36 out of 44
    7: Drilling stopped because technical chal- lenges prevented going deeper. The project goal was 15 km.
    16.1.2 Geothermal Depletion
    The previous section was framed in the context of accessing the 44 TW steady geothermal flow, sustainable for billions of years-finding that we cannot expect to satisfy demand by that route. But when did we ever exhibit collective concern for long-term sustainable solutions? The human way is more about exploiting a resource fully, not worrying about consequences even decades down the line. In that sense, geothermal energy has more to offer at least on paper.
    A one-time extraction of thermal energy under out feet-not worrying about replenishment-amounts to mining thermal energy, in much the same way that we mine copper, or fossil fuels. Using a rock density of 2,500 kg/m3 and a specific heat capacity of 1,000 J/kg/°C (Sec. 6.2; p. 85), each cubic meter of rock has an extra 60 MJ of thermal energy for each kilometer deeper we go-based on a gradient of 25 °C/km, as before. Is that a lot? It's about the same as the energy in 2 L of gasoline. The energy density works out to 0.006 kcal/g, to put in familiar units (see Table 16.1).
    So it's no screaming-good deal, but it's still energy, and the earth's crust has a heck of a lot more rock than it does oil. To appreciate the scale, the land area of the lower-48 states is approximately 1013 m2. A 1-meter- thick slice of earth under the U.S. at a depth of 1 km therefore contains 60 MJ/m3 times 1013 m3, or 6 x 1020 J of energy. It's a big number, but recall that 1 qBtu is about 1018 J, so we're talking about ~600 qBtu. The U.S. uses about 100 qBtu per year of energy, but at an average efficiency of 35% in heat engines, so that we seek about 35 qBtu of useful energy. As we saw, the geothermal resource, at lower temperature, is less potent in terms of efficiency. If achieving half of the theoretical 8% efficiency for the 1 km AT of 25°C, a one-meter-thick slice would provide about 24 qBtu of useful work. Reaching the 35 qBtu goal would require a slice about 1.5 m thick, at 24 qBtu per meter.
    To summarize, we would need to completely remove all the heat from all the rock 1 km below our feet in a 1.5 m-thick layer every year. Once we cool the underground rock, it will take a long time for the surrounding

    heat to diffuse in, so we'd have to keep moving down, year after year. This would mean completely replacing the collection network (whatever comprises it—this is all fantasy) every few years. It's ludicrous to imagine we would endeavor to go to such extremes, plowing through the deep earth to remove every scrap of thermal energy in a massive never-ending effort. Such a colossal scheme makes oil drilling seem like child's play.
    Granted, as one drills deeper, the thermal energy goes up and the efficiency increases as AT climbs. The result is quadratic, in that the energy yield 3 km down is 9 times that at 1 km down.10 At the same time, drilling gets more challenging and at some point exceeds the current state of the art. By the time the temperature reaches 150°C-which is thought of as a minimum viable temperature for traditional geothermal ventures-drilling technology runs into limitations.
    Box 16.2: There Will Be Hype
    As long as an idea is not outright impossible, the world is big enough and competitive enough that enterprising individuals will be able to generate interest and investment in ideas that seem viable and can be touted to have great promise. Whether that idea is truly capable of benefiting humanity as a "good" idea is not fully evaluated. Instead, if it can make money in the short term, then it may get a green light.
    12
    So be wary of claims by people or companies whose financial interests lie in the perception of success and promise. Even media coverage that should be objective is often quantitatively sloppy,12 and has a much easier time finding enthusiasts willing to devote time and quotes than non-enthusiast experts who are too busy pursuing their own projects to waste time poking holes in shoddy ideas.

    16.1.3 Geothermal Reality
    Enough, then, about "pipe dreams" of massive geothermal exploitation on a planetary scale. Geothermal energy is not all fantasy, as some places are able to capture significant energy from this resource.
    In a few locations, hot magma is brought near the surface, offering rare cracks of access to high temperatures. An electrical power plant, as depicted in Fig. 6.2 (p. 90), does not care particularly where the thermal energy derives, as long as it's hot enough to make steam. The ideal site has:
    ‣ magma near the surface-volcanic regions, for instance;
    ► fractured rock above the magma in which water can flow; water temperatures in excess of 180°C (under pressure);
    ‣ a caprock above the fractured rock, able to trap pressurized steam.
    2022 T. W. Murphy, Jr.; Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International Lic.; Freely available at: https://escholarship.org/uc/energy_ambitions.
    The most common scheme-labeled "hydrothermal"—is to drill two holes into the ground near each other, injecting water into one and collecting pressurized steam from the other. Fractures in the rock permit water and/or steam to flow between the two holes. Alternatively, but far less common, a fluid13 can be run through a closed loop that passes through the hot medium. By either direct use of the steam in the hydrothermal case, or generating steam from the hot fluid in the closed- loop case, the resulting steam can be used to run a turbine and generator in the usual
    way.
    A newer form, called "binary" geothermal uses two fluids: water in the ground as in other schemes, but a second fluid having a much lower boiling point to make a steam analog at lower temperatures. This opens additional power generation possibilities at temperatures below 100°C, but of course will suffer the inevitable efficiency hit when Th is lower, according to Eq. 16.1.
    Globally, roughly 10 GW of electricity is produced from geothermal energy [107], and an estimated additional 28 GW of direct heating is obtained from this source [108]. Together, these account for 0.4% of the 18 TW global energy budget, after a thermal equivalent adjustment.

    Table 16.2 lists the top 7 producers of geothermal electricity, capturing 72% of the global total. Note that many are on the Pacific Rim, sometimes called the "ring of fire" for its volcanic activity. Iceland gets 30% of its electricity14 from geothermal sources. But in absolute terms, it is a small amount of energy. Considering that a single nuclear plant puts out about 1 GW, the countries in Table 16.2 have the equivalent of 1-2 nuclear plants in the form of geothermal (compare to Table 15.8; p. 256).
    The U.S. gets an average of 1.9 GW of electrical production15 from geother- mal sources [85]. 72% of this is produced in California-almost all at a site called The Geysers in the northern part of the state-accounting for ~6% of the state's electricity. Another 22% of U.S. geothermal electricity is produced in in Nevada. The rest is in Utah, Hawaii, Oregon, Idaho, and New Mexico, in that order (7 states total).

    16.2 Tidal Capture
    Table 10.2 (p.168) indicates that the earth currently receives 3 TW of power in the form of tidal energy. Gravity from the moon (and the sun16) tug on the earth, pulling slightly harder on the nearest side, and less enthusiastically on the far side. This deforms the otherwise spherical Earth1 into a prolate ellipsoid, which is a fancy way to say oval-somewhat like an egg. The bulges that form on either side (near and far; see Figure 16.1) as a consequence are more pronounced in the ocean than the land, but both indeed deform.
    16: The tidal influence from the sun is sub- dominant, at 45% the strength of lunar tides, so for simplicity we will describe just lunar tides from here on.
    17: Actually, an even larger (21 km) effect is the spinning motion of the earth flattening it into an oblate ellipsoid.
    bulge
    Moon (10x farther)
    The earth rotates "under" these bulges, since the bulges point along the Earth-Moon axis and take a month to make a complete revolution in space, while the earth rotates once per day. At a fixed position on Earth, then, the experience is two high tides and two low tides each day.18 As the tide comes in and flows out, friction between land and water results in energy dissipation, to the tune of 3 TW.19
    The idea for capturing this natural flow of energy is to allow the tide to enter a bay or inlet-raising the water level by perhaps several meters- then closing the exit, trapping the water behind a wall. At this point, the situation is very much like a hydroelectric dam (Sec. 11.2; p. 175), but at a much lower water height than is typical for hydroelectric dams. All the same, exiting water can be forced through turbines turning generators to create electricity. Draining through turbines over a 6-hour period allows the process to begin again at low tide, opening the gates to refill the inlet as the tide comes back in.
    The amount of energy depends on the area of the captured body of water and the height of water trapped behind the wall. We use the familiar gravitational potential energy: E = mgh to calculate the energy involved (Sec. 11.1; p. 173). If the height of water trapped behind the wall at high tide is called h, the height of water behind the wall smoothly transitions from h → 0 as the water drains out, so that the average height of water behind the wall is h/2, and the gravitational potential energy available really looks like mgh/2. The mass is density (p =1,000 kg/m3) times volume, and volume is the area of the captured water surface, A, in square meters, times the initial water height, h. To get power, we
    Figure 16.1: The moon (pictured closer here to fit on page) raises bulges on the near and far side of the earth, while the earth rotates underneath, causing two high tides and two low tides each day.
    18: The sun also contributes, sometimes adding to the peaks and troughs (near new and full moon, when Earth, Moon, and Sun are arranged along a line), and sometimes moderating the tides by filing in the gaps a bit (at quarter moon phases).
    19: An aggressive global-scale tidal capture enterprise could actually increase the total tidal energy budget, which would have the side effect of pushing the moon further away, slowly, as is described in Sec. D.4 (p. 402).

    where g≈ 10 m/s2 is the acceleration due to gravity and ε is the efficiency of converting gravitational energy into electrical energy.
    Example 16.2.1 The Rance tidal capture station in France has a capture area of A = 22.5 km2, and a height capacity of 8 m. If operating off of a 7 m high tide and draining for 6 hours, what is the expected power delivered at an efficiency of 90% (as is typical for hydroelectric power)?
    Expressing A in square meters yields 22.5 x 106 m2. The time is 21,600 seconds, leading to a calculated value of 230 MW.
    Only two large tidal facilities operate in the world today: Rance in France (Example 16.2.1) has a rated capacity of 240 MW, and produces an average of 57 MW. Thus the capacity factor is about 24% due to the fact that it can only generate tidal power half the time21 and not all high tides are at the full design height. The h2 in Eq. 16.2 indicates particular sensitivity to height-due to the double-whammy that lower height means less trapped mass and lower pressure head.
    The other facility is Sihwa Lake in South Korea, a 254 MW facility that came online in 2011. Much like Rance, and for the same reasons, its capacity factor is 25%, averaging 63 MW. Its basin is 30 km2 and has similar operating height as the French installation. The Sihwa Lake facility cost $560 million to build, making it $9 per average Watt of delivered power. This puts it roughly in line with the cost of nuclear power (page 256), and a little higher than utility-scale PV, currently.
    Two other large tidal stations in the 300-400 MW capacity range are in the works for the UK and Scotland. But it's not something that works well everywhere: best suited for areas that have large tidal swings and large inlets having narrow mouths that are easy to dam. It's a niche player now and always will be. After all, the 3 TW global budget for tidal energy suggests that it is not an energy jackpot.
    16.3 Ocean Currents
    Steady currents throughout the volume of the ocean22 are estimated to total 5 TW (see Table 10.2; p. 168). This is not much more than total tidal dissipation on the planet, at 3 TW. Already, we don't hold out much hope for an energy bonanza. Wind in the atmosphere, by contrast, has

    almost 200 times as much power. And we saw that getting even a few terawatts out of wind is a challenge, globally.
    The physics is very similar to that of wind (Chapter 12). Kinetic energy from the motion of the water is transferred to rotational motion in a turbine to turn a generator to make electricity. Echoing Eq. 12.2 (p. 187), we have
    1
    2
    Pcurrent = Eρwater R23.
    (16.3)
    The efficiency, & is limited by the same physics as for wind, so 50% is a reasonable maximum. Recall that pwater = 1,000 kg/m3.
    So we still have the quadratic dependence on rotor radius and the crucial cubic power of velocity. Ocean currents tend to be far slower than wind velocities, but the density of water is about 800 times the density of air, so that for the same rotor area, water moving at 1 m/s has similar power as air moving at 9 m/s.
    One problem is that the giant land-based wind turbines whose rotors move at high speeds relative to the wind would not be practical in water, so individual units would more likely be on the ten-meter scale and not a 100-meter scale. Individual rotors would therefore likely generate a few hundred kilowatts apiece, requiring thousands of rotors to make up a typical 1 GW power plant output.
    Example 16.3.1 A 10 m diameter rotor sits in a brisk 2 m/s current. At an efficiency of 50% (similar to wind), how much power would the turbine deliver?
    All the pieces23 fall right into Eq. 16.3 to yield about 160 kW.
    Among the advantages, marine currents are very steady and dependable, so that capacity factors would be high. This is in contrast to solar, wind, and even hydroelectric and tidal resources.
    24
    However, marine environments are not kind to underwater structures,2 making it hard to imagine the headache it would be to maintain the moving parts in good condition-all in a difficult operating environment for human workers. Additionally, marine life might not be so happy to get whacked by a rotor blade.
    In the end, we should not expect this sector to contribute substantively to global energy, given the small scale of total energy available and the practical difficulties associated with harnessing any sizeable piece of it.
    23: Just be careful about diameter vs. ra- dius.
    24: Look at pier pilings and sunken ships to get an idea.
    16.4 Wave Energy
    Waves present an interesting case to study, being composed of a continu- ous interplay between potential and kinetic energies-water particles

    executing circular paths as they gain and lose gravitational potential energy. Meanwhile, the energy in a packet of waves travels efficiently onward, until reaching a barrier like a shoreline, where they break in a display of kinetic energy. It is hard to stare at a coastline being pounded by surf without admiring the power of nature. What if we harnessed that power?
    As a means of estimation, let's imagine sinusoidal25 waves 1 m in amplitude (peak-to-trough) arriving every 6 seconds, traveling at about 3 m/s. Crests must then be 18 m apart, since the distance between crests is their rate (3 m/s) times time (6 seconds). We call this the wavelength, symbolized by A (Greek lambda). See Figure 16.2 for the layout.

    In order to figure out the energy involved, we need the mass of water raised and a height to which it is raised. Notice that in Figure 16.2, the potential energy in the wave can be extracted by making the water flat again, which is equivalent to taking all the water from the crest and putting it into the trough. We just need to know how much water we're moving, and through what height. Figure 16.2 has done the fancy math already and redrawn the wave as rectangular chunks that have equivalent area as the sinusoidal crest and trough and also the same average (midpoint) height relative to the average surface height (dashed line). From this, we learn that the wave crest has area А1/2π and the height of the displacement is лA/8, where A is the wave amplitude from the top of the crest to the bottom of the trough.
    To assess potential energy as mgh, we need three pieces. We already know g≈ 10 m/s2, and we now know that h = TА/8. The mass is a density, p, times a volume. We already have the area of the crest cross section as А1/2л. To get a volume, we need a length along the wave, which we are free to make up as a variable we'll call . The mass, m, of our block of water is then pАll/27. Putting this together, the gravitational potential energy (GPE) associated with putting the water back to a flat state along a length, l, of one wave is
    Figure 16.2: Sinusoidal waves have ampli- tude A, and wavelength A. In terms of har- vesting the gravitational potential energy, we can think of it as lopping off the crest and flipping it over onto the trough to level the water surface. In doing so, we move some mass, m, down a height h to get mgh of en- ergy. The block-equivalent is shown below, where the area and average height of the sinusoidal trough/crest has been faithfully captured by rectangles of height ~0.39A and length ~0.41A. From these, it is possible to figure out the potential energy associated with the wave.
    Author's note: we'll be going through a bit of a derivation here-not because wave power is particularly important, but because physicists sometimes can't help it. Feel free to skip past all the equations, as this is meant as a sort of entertainment. What can I say: the introduction had a warning about skipping the whole chapter, yet here you
    are.

    It's not an equation to remember, just a way to keep track of the physics as we build toward a final/useful result. Next, we want to understand the
    power delivered as the waves come and come. We get a new one every At = 6 s. And we also reasoned before, in slightly different form, that At A/v, where v is the velocity of the wave: 3 m/s in our example. The power looks like:

    This is how much power the potential energy part of waves contributes as the waves pile onto the shore. But waves also have kinetic energy. It turns out that kinetic energy and potential energy are balanced in a wave which is perpetually sloshing back and forth between potential and kinetic forms, much as happens in the motion of a pendulum. So the total power is just double PGPE, or
    pl g A2 v Ptot =
    8
    (16.6)
    It is a little awkward to have to specify the length of the wave, but we needed it to make sense of the mass involved. At this point, let's switch to expressing the power per unit length of the wave, or P/l.

    Notice that this expression does not actually depend on the wavelength, in the end. The only measures of the wave that enter are the amplitude and velocity.26
    For our example of 1 m amplitude and 3 m/s velocity, we compute a power per unit length of 3,750 W/m. Okay, this is a new unit, and it looks vaguely encouraging. Blow dryers, toaster ovens, space heaters, or similar power-hungry appliances consume about 1,800 W of power when running full blast, so 3,750 W/m is roughly equivalent to having two such appliances plugged in and running for every meter of length along the wave, or coastline. It seems like a bonanza: Our collective hair will be dry in no time! Take a moment to picture a beach cluttered with a power-hog appliance plugged in every 0.5 m all down the beach, all running at full power. That's what the waves can support, and it seems pretty impressive.
    But what we care about, in the end, is how much total power the waves can deliver: how many terawatts? So we need to multiply the wave P/l value by a length along the wave, or a shoreline length.
    Example 16.4.1 How much wave power arrives on the U.S. Pacific coast if the whole coastline is experiencing 1 m amplitude waves at a
    26: The velocity of near-shore waves is set only by the depth, d, of the water (v = √gd).
    We will use this 3,750 W/m figure from here on for our rough analysis, but it should be borne in mind that larger wave ampli- tude has a quadratic effect on power, and waves are not all 1 m peak-to-trough!

    wave speed of 3 m/s?
    The foregoing text already worked out that P/l for these wave pa- rameters is 3,750 W/m. Now we just need to multiply by a coastline length. The Pacific coast of the U.S. is approximately 2,000 km long. Multiplying 3,750 W/m by 2,000,000 m yields 7.5 GW.
    Getting 7.5 GW on the Pacific coast, and maybe a similar amount on the Atlantic coast for a total of 15 GW is nothing to sneeze at. But consider that the U.S. electricity demand is about 450 GW, and various alternatives already top the upper limit of wave potential, as shown in Table 16.3.27 Also, to get 15 GW from waves would require extracting all the wave energy from the U.S. coasts. Sorry surfers. Sorry marine life who depend on the waves for stirring nutrients and other functions a physicist can only guess. The point is that when a fully developed wave energy resource only provides a few percent of demand, while a promising thing like solar is already roughly matching it and has ample room to grow, we can be pretty confident that wave power will not become an important player.
    But let's make a quick estimate of global potential to compare to the 18 TW demand. The question becomes one of how much coastline28
    receives wave energy.
    We can play a crude trick by recognizing that two big clumps of connected land occupy the eastern and western hemispheres, each having an east coast and a west coast, running roughly pole to pole. So the exposed coastlines roughly ring the globe twice. Our familiar unit of length, the meter, was actually chosen to yield approximately 10,000 km from equator to pole, so it takes 40,000 km to circle the earth once, and we therefore estimate 80,000 km of wave-receiving coastline. Multiplying 3.75 kW/m by 80,000 km yields 0.3 TW, or less than 2% of global demand, if fully developed.
    3,750 W/m seemed so promising at first, especially compared to insola- tion numbers we saw in Chapter 13 that tend to be around 200 W/m2. But a huge difference here is that wave density is a linear measure (Watts per meter of coastline) versus an areal measure in the case of insolation (Watts per square meter of land). A country has far more square meters than linear meters. So wave power, even if fully developed around all the world's coastlines, could not amount to very much, and is therefore placed in the "boutique" category, along with the other occupants of this chapter.
    We have not even mentioned the technologies that can convert wave power to electricity-because what's the point? Suffice it to say that the same relative motion of magnets past coils of wire that create electrical energy in a generator can work in applications that do not spin all the way around, as is usually the case. A back-and-forth motion like one cylinder inside another, or a joint bending back and forth can be configured to generate electrical power as well.

    16.5 Hydrogen
    Combustion of hydrogen gas produces energy, and indeed is sometimes used as rocket fuel and in some demonstration vehicles. It can also be combined with oxygen in a fuel cell (not combustion) to generate electricity. Twenty years ago, references to a hydrogen economy replacing fossil fuels were common. So why has it been left out of this book, shoved unceremoniously into the last part of a chapter on miscellaneous small players? One key reason: hydrogen is not a source of energy. Pockets of hydrogen gas are not found underground.29
    Hydrogen can be produced from water given enough energy input, typically via electrolysis, which splits H2O into hydrogen and oxygen. Electrolysis efficiency is typically 65-80% in terms of capturing input energy in the form of stored hydrogen. So hydrogen should be thought of as energy storage-like a chemical battery-rather than as an energy source. Combustion of hydrogen to drive a car, for instance, would suffer the usual heat engine inefficiency of ~25%. Combined with electrolysis inefficiency, total efficiency is down to 15-20%. A standard battery does far better in round-trip30 storage efficiency: 60-90%. Fuel cells are far more efficient than combustion-around 65%. Combined with the electrolysis step, the overall efficiency is still well short of battery storage, at around 50% overall.
    Hydrogen in gaseous form is bulky and hard to package-especially in mobile applications like cars. The alternative to gaseous storage is as a cryogenic liquid, adding other complications. Hydrogen is more dangerous than gasoline as an explosion hazard. Fuel cells are not particularly robust and have difficulty in cold weather. On balance, hydrogen is unlikely to come roaring onto the scene as a fossil fuel replacement. An article [110] summarizes the pros and cons well.
    16.6 Upshot on Small Players
    The topics discussed in this chapter are presented more out of duty to completeness than as set of hopeful candidates for the energy of tomorrow. The first four are physically viable sources of real energy. Geothermal and tidal (to a lesser extent) contribute to today's energy mix, and new development is underway to expand both.
    Geothermal energy is only practical in a small number of places that provide proximate access to high-temperature magma. Plans to extract geothermal energy from "normal" locations have not yet materialized, and the challenges are substantial. We should not expect geothermal energy to contribute at the terawatt scale, in practice.
    Tidal energy, like geothermal, is very location-dependent-requiring large inlets with large tidal amplitude that can be closed off easily. But
    29: It is too reactive to survive on its own, in- stead bound in H2O and CH4, for instance.

    some locations are well-suited to supplement local power generation from this resource. The possibilities for terawatt-scale extraction are essentially non-existent, so tidal will remain a small player.
    Ocean currents and wave power are sometimes explored in small demon- stration projects, but never yet at scales that add significantly to the total energy mix. Terawatt-scale implementation is not to be expected.
    Hydrogen is not a source of energy, but a possible means of energy storage. Various challenges make it less than exciting as a fuel of the future.
    As much as anything, this chapter may go to show that physics can be used to explore all sorts of ideas, operating within a finite set of rules and options. Humans have had a very long time to explore the world and identify possible sources of energy.31 The options on the table are now well known, and any new ideas can be assessed quantitatively- usually only to show that the resource is small compared to present-day demand.
    31:... which has been understood to be a pressing concern for at least half-a-century
    16.7 Problems
1. A typical college campus is probably about one square kilometer in area. How much power out of Earth's 44 TW geothermal budget passes through the campus area, assuming uniform distribution across the 5.1 x 108 square kilometers of earth's surface? How does this compare to a typical college electrical demand of about
   20 MW?
2. If it were possible to achieve 60% of the theoretical maximum heat engine efficiency for a geothermal plant, how deep would it have to drill to access high enough temperatures to match the 35% efficiency of fossil fuel power plants if the thermal gradient is 25 °C/km? Have we drilled this far before?
3. At 4 km down, we expect the AT to be about 100°C, and each cubic meter of rock would contain about 250 MJ of thermal energy. If 50% of the maximum theoretical efficiency were achieved from an ambient environment at 288 K, how much rock thickness would have to be depleted in a year to satisfy a 1 km2 campus whose output electricity demand is 20 MW?
4. Your friend just visited a geothermal power plant, and is excited by the facts that it is environmentally clean, not intermittent like solar or wind, can last ages, totals more than twice our 18 TW budget, and it really works-seen with their very own eyes. What are the key points you might offer to temper their unvarnished enthusiasm?
   Hint: using T = 288 K, solve for Th at the target theoretical maximum efficiency, then figure out AT.
   Hint: breathe. Realized efficiency; amount of thermal power needed; thermal energy in a year; how many cubic meters; how thick for the campus area?

5. What are your thoughts on whether we should "mine" geothermal heat in a way that could theoretically last hundreds or thousands of years, but not tens of thousands of years before depleting the resource? Such activity would not be strictly sustainable in the long haul, but could seem abundant for many generations. Should we care about this? Where do you land?
6. Work out the capacity factors of geothermal installations for various
   countries and the world as a whole from the data in Table 16.2.
7. The average global production, in GW, for hydroelectricity, wind, solar, and nuclear are 477, 125, 67, and 393, respectively (Tables 11.2, 12.2, 13.3, and 15.8). Add geothermal production from this chapter to the list and express each of the five as percentages32 and draw an approximate pie chart to help put these alternative electricity resources in context.
8. The Sihwa tidal power plant has a reservoir area of 30 km2 and is rated to generate 254 MW of electrical output. If generation efficiency is 90%, what initial water height does the power rating correspond to, assuming a 6 hour discharge time?
9. On the basis of fluid power scaling as the cube of velocity, show the supporting math for the claim in the text that a water current at 1 m/s delivers the equivalent power (per rotor area) as a wind speed of about 9 m/s.
10. If placed in a steady current of 1 m/s, and at a generation efficiency of 40%, how large would an ocean current rotor be (diameter) to satisfy the 10,000 W demand of the average American? Put this scale in the context of some familiar object or space.
11. The running example for waves in the text delivers 3,750 W/m of energy along a coastline. It sounds like a lot. But if we put the 40 million residents of California along its 1350 km coastline, how many meters does each person have, and how much power from waves?
12. Let's imagine waves hitting the entire 2,000 km Pacific coastline of the U.S. that are different from those evaluated in the text. This time, the waves have 50 m wavelength, arriving every 10 seconds, and 2 m crest-to-trough amplitude. How much power does the coast receive under these more active conditions?

    This book has explored the energy surge of the last 150 years, largely casting it as a story of fossil fuels. Combining the finite nature of fossil fuels with their environmental cost makes it clear that we cannot expect fossil fuels to carry us into the indefinite future-and the sooner we transition away, the better. We have explored aspects of the chief alternatives in the preceding chapters. This chapter gathers key results.
    One striking realization is that no fundamentally new energy technolo- gies have emerged in the last half-century. Hydroelectricity, nuclear fission, wind, and solar photovoltaics, had all been invented. Fusion has been in the research phase the entire time. It would be unwise to expect a miraculous new entry into the field of energy-a knight in shining armor.1 It is not as though scientists and engineers have not prioritized energy research: energy has been recognized as a lynchpin of modern life all this time. The peak of U.S. oil production in 1970 followed by two global oil crises that decade served as a wake-up call. Alarm bells have been ringing over climate change almost the entire time. Interest has been keen, and many ideas2 have been entertained. Scratching our heads to generate more ideas is not so promising at this stage.
    Perhaps, then, the table is set. We know the actors. We know the pros and cons, having many decades of experience with each of the technologies. Where does this leave us? This chapter3 aims to pull it all together to take stock. The chapters to follow will begin to address how we might move forward in light of our predicament.

    17 Comparison of Alternatives
    290
    viewed as a source of energy from the ground, fossil fuels are perhaps more aptly described as nearly perfect energy storage media, at energy densities that are orders of magnitude higher than anything achieved thus far in the best available battery technology. The storage is nearly perfect because it is reasonably safe, not especially corrosive, easy to transport, lightweight yet dense enough to work in airplanes (see Box 17.1), and indefinitely storable-indeed, for millions of years-without loss of energy. No alternative storage technique can boast all the same benefits, be it batteries, flywheels, hydrogen, or ethanol.
    Box 17.1: Electric Airplanes?
    Box 13.3 (p. 212) demonstrated that an airplane receiving solar energy in ideal conditions could gather only 4% of the power typical of a cruising airliner, and would not be able to get off the ground on direct solar input. But what about battery storage?
    The best lithium-ion batteries store 0.17 kcal/g, which is 65 times less energy-dense than gasoline, at ~11 kcal/g. A Boeing 737-the workhorse of the airline industry-has an empty weight around 35 tons, and accommodates about 15 tons of fuel and 15 tons of passengers/cargo. A comparable energy storage in the form of batteries—even allowing a factor of three difference in thermal efficiency versus electric efficiency-would take 300 tons of battery: far in excess of the entire plane's maximum takeoff weight. Or the airplane could just accept a reduced range by a factor of 20: down to 200 km. Recharge time could easily exceed flight time. It's not the same. See Sec. D.3 (p. 397) for additional analysis.
    This chapter aims to build a relatively complete list of ways in which we might tap into Earth's various energy flows and stores (as in Table 10.2; p. 168), most of which have been addressed in some detail in Chapters 11-16.
    In order to make comparisons, it is helpful to create a matrix of energy source properties so that the relative strengths and weaknesses of each are obvious at a glance. (See Figures 17.1 and 17.2.) The matrix is presented as a color-coded figure based on 10 different criteria.6 Blue, yellow, and red can be loosely interpreted as good, neutral, and deficient, respectively. Yellow boxes are often accompanied by brief reasons for their neutrality—the reasons for blue or red extremes often being obvious. While some criteria are quantitative, many are subjective. The following 10 properties are assessed for this comparison.
    ▸ Abundance. Not all ideas, however clever or practical, can scale to meet the needs of modern society. Hydroelectric power cannot expand beyond about 10% of current global demand, while the solar potential reaching Earth's surface is easily calculated to exceed this benchmark by a factor of about 5,000. Abundant

    Electric flight is not impossible. Model air- planes, drones, and other cute demonstra- tions may get airborne. But this is not at all the same thing as practical air travel!
    6: The criteria are defined by the author: this method of comparison is not common practice even if something like it perhaps should be.

    sources are coded blue, while niche ideas like hydroelectricity that cannot conceivably fulfill a quarter of global demand are colored red. Intermediate players that can satisfy a substantial fraction of demand are coded yellow.
    ► Difficulty. This field tries to capture the degree to which a resource brings with it large technical challenges. How many PhDs does it take to run the plant? How intensive is it to maintain an operational state? This one might translate into economic terms: difficulty serves as a crude proxy for expensive.
    ► Intermittency. Colored blue if the source is rock-steady or avail- able whenever it is needed. If the availability is beyond our control, then it gets a yellow at least. The possibility of substantial under- production for a few days earns red.
    ▸ Demonstrated. To be blue, a resource has to be commercially available today and providing significant energy to society. Proof of concept on paper, or prototypes that exhibit some of the technology, do not count as demonstrated.
    ► Electricity. Can the technology produce electricity? For most sources, the answer is yes. Sometimes it would make little sense to try. For other sources, it is impractical.
    Heat. Can the resource produce direct heat? Colored yellow if only via electric means.
    Transport. Does the technology relieve the looming decline in oil production? Anything that makes electricity can power an electric car, earning a yellow score. Liquid fuels are blue. Bear in mind that large-scale migration to electric cars is not guaranteed to happen, as the cars may remain too expensive or impractical to be widely adopted, among other challenges related to grid infrastructure for mass-scale charging.
    ► Acceptance. Is public opinions favorable to this method? Is resis- tance likely, whether justified or not? This dimension encompasses environmental concerns, threats to health and safety, and unsight- liness in natural settings.
    ► Backyard. Is this something that can be used domestically, in someone's backyard, rooftop, or small property, managed by the individual? Distributed power adds to system resilience. Efficiency. Over 50% earns blue. Below about 10% gets red. It is not the most important of criteria, as the abundance score implicitly incorporates efficiency expectations, but we will always view low efficiency negatively.
    Environmental impact has no column in this matrix, although the "acceptance" measure captures some of this. Climate change is an obvious negative for fossil fuels, but not so much as to have resulted in curtailed global demand thus far (see Fig. 8.2; p. 118). None of the alternatives presented here contribute directly to carbon dioxide emissions, earning an added advantage for all entries.

    Figure 17.1: Fossil fuel matrix of attributes. Blue is good (+1 point); yellow is neutral (0 points).
    The conventional fossil fuels each score 7-8 out of 10 possible points by this scheme, displayed on the right side of Figure 17.1. Some attribute ratings are divided into heating versus electricity production for a few of the scoring categories.
    The overall impression conveyed by this graphic is that fossil fuels perform rather well in almost all criteria. Because fossil fuels collectively supply about 80% of global energy usage, they are each classified as having intermediate abundance. But even this is not a permanent condition-providing significant motivation for exploring alternatives in the first place. Getting energy out of fossil fuels is trivially easy. Being free of intermittency problems, fully demonstrated, and versatile enough to provide heat, electricity, and transportation fuel, fossil fuels have been embraced by society and are frequently used directly in homes. Efficiency for anything but direct heat is middling, typically registering 15–25% for automotive engines and 30-40% for power plants.
    The commonly discussed alternative energy approaches display a wider range of ratings. Immediately, some overall trends are clear in Figure 17.2. Very few options are both abundant and easy. Solar photovoltaic (PV) and solar thermal are the only exceptions. A similar exclusion principle often holds for abundant and demonstrated/available again satisfied only by solar PV and solar thermal. This uncommon combination plays a large role in the popularity and promise of solar power.
    Intermittency mainly plagues solar and wind resources, although many natural sources (hydroelectric, tidal, wave, biofuels) present mild incon- venience due to intermittency.
    Electricity is easy to produce, resulting in many options. Since the easiest and cheapest will likely be picked first, the less convenient forms of electricity production are less likely to be exploited.10
    Transportation needs are hard to satisfy. Together with the fact that oil production will peak before natural gas or coal, transportation may appear as the foremost problem to address. Electric cars are an obvious- albeit expensive solution. Besides being unclear how we might all afford11 electric cars, the technology has a number of drawbacks relative

A car filling its gasoline tank is transferring energy at an astounding rate of 15 MW, equivalent to 3,000 homes running air conditioning. Limited range and slow charge times12 do not permit electric transport to simply replace transportation as we currently know it.
    Few of the options face serious barriers to acceptance, especially when energy scarcity is at stake. Some energy sources are available for individ- ual implementation, allowing distributed power generation as opposed to centralized resources. For example, a passive solar home having PV panels, wind power, and some method to produce liquid fuels on-site would satisfy most domestic energy needs in a self-sufficient manner.
    Cost is not directly represented in the matrix, although the difficulty rating may serve as an imperfect proxy. In general, the alternative meth- ods have difficulty competing against cheap fossil fuels. It is not yet clear whether the requisite prosperity needed to afford a more expen- sive energy future at today's scale will be forthcoming, as prosperity historically has been closely tied to the availability of natural resources,

    17.2 Tally for Individual Alternative Sources
    A single chapter cannot adequately detail the myriad complex consider- ations that went into the matrix in Figure 17.2. The previous chapters address a number of the considerations, but many of the quantitative and qualitative aspects for each were developed at the Do the Math website. The key qualities of each resource in relation to the matrix criteria are discussed in this section, focusing especially on less obvious characteristics.
    14
    Solar PV (Sec. 13.3; p. 201): Covering just 0.4% of Earth's land area with PV panels that are 15% efficient satisfies global annual energy demand, qualifying solar PV as abundant. PV panels are being produced globally in excess of 100 gigawatts (GW) peak capacity per year,13 demonstrating a low degree of difficulty. Most people do not object to solar PV on rooftops or over parking areas, or even in open spaces.1 Solar panels are well suited to individual operation and maintenance. Intermittency is the Achilles' heel of solar PV, requiring storage solutions if adopted on a large scale. To illustrate the difficulty of storage, a lead-acid battery large enough to provide the United States with adequate backup power would require more lead than is estimated to be accessible in the world and would cost approximately $60 trillion at today's price of lead [112]. Lithium or nickel-based batteries fare no better on cost or abundance. Pumped storage is limited by a small number of suitable locales.
    Solar Thermal (Sec. 13.8.2; p. 219): Achieving comparable efficiency to PV but using more land area, the process of generating electricity from concentrated solar thermal energy has no problem qualifying as abundant—although somewhat more regionally constrained. It is relatively low-tech: shiny curved mirrors, tracking on (often) one axis, heat up oil or a similar fluid to drive a standard heat engine. Intermittency can be mitigated by storing thermal energy, perhaps even for a few days. A number of plants are already in operation, producing cost-competitive electricity. Public acceptance is no worse than for PV, but the technology generally must be implemented in large, centralized facilities.
    Solar Heating (Sec. 13.8.1; p. 218): On a smaller scale, heat collected directly from the sun can provide domestic hot water and home heating. In the latter case, this can be as simple as a south-facing window. Captur- ing and using solar heat effectively is not particularly difficult, coming down to plumbing, insulation, and ventilation control. Technically, solar heating potential might be abundant, but since it is usually restricted to building footprints (roof, windows), it gets a yellow rating. Solar heating does not lend itself to electricity generation or transport, but it has no difficulty being accepted and almost by definition is a backyard-ready technology.

    17 Comparison of Alternatives 295
    Hydroelectric (Chapter 11): Despite impressive efficiency, hydroelectric potential is already well developed in the world and is destined to remain a sub-dominant player on the scale of today's energy use. It has seasonal intermittency,15 does not directly provide heat or transport, and can only rarely be implemented on a personal scale. Acceptance is fairly high, although silting and associated dangers-together with habitat destruction and the forced displacement of people-do cause some opposition to expansion and have resulted in removal of some hydroelectric facilities.
    Biofuels from Algae (Sec. 14.3.2; p. 234): Because algae capture solar energy-even at less than 5% efficiency-the potential energy scale is enormous.16 Challenges include keeping the plumbing clean, possible infection,17 contamination by other species, and so on. At present, no algal sample that secretes the desired fuels has been identified or engineered. No one knows whether genetic engineering will succeed at creating a suitable organism. Otherwise, the ability to provide transportation fuel is the big draw. Heat may also be efficiently produced, but electricity production would represent a misallocation of precious liquid fuel.
    Geothermal Electricity (Sec. 16.1; p. 275): This option makes sense primarily at rare geological hotspots. It will not scale to be a significant part of our entire energy mix. Aside from this, it is relatively easy, steady, and well demonstrated in many locations. It can provide electricity, and obviously direct heat although often far from locations demanding heat.
    Wind (Chapter 12): Wind is neither super-abundant nor scarce, being one of those options that can meet a considerable fraction of present needs under large-scale development [70]. Implementation is relatively straightforward, reasonably efficient, and demonstrated the world over in large wind farms. The biggest downside is intermittency. It is not unusual to have little or no regional input for several days in a row. Objections to wind tend to be more serious than for many other alternatives. Wind turbines are noisy and tend to be located in prominent places (ridgetops, coastlines) where their high degree of visibility alters scenery. Wind remains viable for small-scale personal use.
    Artificial Photosynthesis: Combining the abundance of direct solar input with the self-storing flexibility of liquid fuel, artificial photosynthesis is a compelling future possibility [113]. Being able to store the resulting liquid fuel for many months means that intermittency is eliminated to the extent that annual production meets demand. A panel in sunlight dripping liquid fuel could satisfy both heating and transportation needs. Electricity can also be produced, but given an abundance of ways to make electricity, the liquid fuels would be misallocated if used in this way. Unfortunately, an adequate form of artificial photosynthesis has yet to be demonstrated in the laboratory, although the U.S. Department of Energy initiated a large program in 2010 toward this goal.

    Tidal Power (Sec. 16.2; p. 280): Restricted to select coastal locations, tidal power will never be a large contributor to global energy. The resource is intermittent on daily and monthly scales but in a wholly predictable manner. Extracting tidal energy is not terribly hard-the efficient technology is similar to that found in hydroelectric installations- and has been demonstrated in a number of locations around the world.
    Conventional Fission (Sec. 15.4.4; p. 255): Using conventional uranium reactors and conventional mining practices, nuclear fission does not have the legs for a marathon. On the other hand, it is certainly well demonstrated and has no intermittency problems-except that it can- not accommodate intermittency on the demand side (variable load). Compared to other options, nuclear power qualifies as a high-tech approach-meaning that design, construction, operation, and emer- gency mitigation require more advanced training and sophistication than the average energy producer.
    Acceptance is mixed. Germany and Japan plan to phase out their nuclear programs by 2022 and the 2030s, respectively, despite being serious about CO2 reduction. Public unease also contributed to a halt in licensing new reactors in the United States from 1978-2012. Some opposition stems from unwarranted-yet no less real-fear, sustained in part by the technical complexity of the subject. But some opposition relates to political difficulty surrounding proliferation and the onerous radioactive waste problem that no country has yet solved to satisfaction.
    Uranium Breeder (Sec. 15.4.4.2; p. 258): Extending nuclear fission to use plutonium synthesized from 238U, which is 140 times more abundant than 235U, gives uranium fission the legs to run for at least centuries if not a few millennia, ameliorating abundance issues. Breeding has been practiced in military reactors, and indeed some significant fraction of the power in conventional uranium reactors comes from incidental synthesis of plutonium (239Pu) from 238U. But no commercial power plant has been built to deliberately tap the bulk of uranium for power production. Public acceptance of breeder reactors will face even higher hurdles because plutonium is more easily separated into bomb material than is 235U, and the increase in radioactive waste from an expansion of nuclear power causes trouble.
    Thorium Breeder (Box 15.5; p. 260): Thorium is more abundant than uranium and only has one natural isotope,18 qualifying it as an abundant resource. Like all nuclear options, thorium reactors fall into the high-tech camp and include new challenges19 that conventional reactors have not faced. A few small-scale demonstrations have been carried out, but nothing in the commercial realm; bringing thorium reactors online at scale is probably a few decades away, if it happens at all. Public reaction will likely be similar to that for conventional nuclear: not a deal breaker, but some resistance on similar grounds. It is not clear whether the novelty of thorium will be greeted with suspicion or enthusiasm. Although thorium also represents a breeding technology (making fissile

    233 U from 232Th), the proliferation aspect is severely diminished for thorium due to a highly radioactive 232U by-product20 and virtually no easily separable plutonium.
    Geothermal Heating allowing Depletion (Sec. 16.1.2; p. 277): A vast store of thermal energy sits in Earth's crust, permeating the rock and moving slowly outward. Ignoring sustainable aims, boreholes could be drilled a few kilometers down to extract thermal energy out of the rock faster than the geophysical replacement rate, effectively mining heat as a one-time resource. In the absence of water flow to distribute heat, dry rock will deplete its heat within 5-10 meters of the borehole in a matter of a few years, requiring another hole 10 m away from the previous, in repeated fashion. The recurrent large-scale drilling operation across the land qualifies this technique as moderately difficult.
    The temperatures are marginal for running heat engines to make elec- tricity with any respectable efficiency,21 but at least the thermal resource will not suffer intermittency problems during the time that a given hole is still useful. Kilometer-scale drilling hurdles have prevented this technique from being demonstrated at geologically normal (inactive) sites. Public acceptance may be less than lukewarm given the scale of drilling involved, dealing with tailings and possibly groundwater contamination issues on a sizable scale. While a backyard might ac- commodate a borehole, it would be far more practical to use the heat for clusters of buildings rather than for just one given the effort and lifetime associated with each hole.
    Geothermal Heating, Steady State (Sec. 16.1.1; p. 276): Sustainable extraction of geothermal heat-replenished by radioactive decay within the Earth offers far less total potential, coming to about 13 TW of flow if summed across all land. And to get to temperatures hot enough to be useful for heating purposes, boreholes at least 1 km deep would be required. It is tremendously challenging to cover any significant fraction of land area with thermal collectors 1 km deep. As a result, a yellow score for the abundance factor may be generous. To gather enough steady-flow heat to provide for a normal U.S. home's heating demand, the collection network would have to span a square 200 m on a side at depth, which is likely unachievable.
    Biofuels from Crops (Sec. 14.3; p. 230): While corn ethanol may not even be net energy-positive, sugar cane and vegetable oils as sources of biofuel fare better. But these sources compete with food production and arable land availability. So biofuels from crops can only graduate from "niche" to moderate scale in the context of plant waste or cellulosic conversion. The abundance and demonstration fields are thus split: food crop energy is demonstrated but severely constrained in scale. Cellulosic matter becomes a potentially larger-scale source but is undemonstrated.2 Growing and harvesting annual crops on a relevant scale constitutes a massive, perpetual task and thus scores yellow in difficulty-also driving down EROEI.

    17 Comparison of Alternatives 298
    If exploiting fossil fuels is akin to spending a considerable inheritance, growing and harvesting our energy supply on an annual basis is like getting a manual labor job: a most difficult transition. The main benefit of biofuels from crops is the liquid fuel aspect. Public acceptance hinges on competition with food or even land in general. Because plants are only about 1-2% efficient at harvesting solar energy, this option requires the commandeering of massive tracts of land.
    Ocean Thermal: The ocean thermal resource uses the 20-30°C temper- ature difference between the deep ocean23 and its surface to drive a ridiculously low-efficiency heat engine. The heat content is not useful for warming any home (it's not hot). But all the same, it is a vast resource due to the sheer area of the solar collector (i.e., the ocean). Large plants out at sea will be difficult to access and maintain, and transmitting power to land is not easy. The resource suffers seasonal intermittency at mid-latitudes, but tropical installations would obviate this effect. No relevant/commercial scale demonstration exists. Like many of the other sources, this one produces electricity24 only. In terms of acceptance, few likely care what we put to sea: out of sight, out of mind. Ocean thermal is not a backyard solution!
    Ocean Currents (Sec. 16.3; p. 281): Large-scale oceanic currents are slower than wind by about a factor of ten, giving a kilogram of current 1,000 times less power than a kilogram of wind. Water density makes up the difference to make ocean current comparable to wind in terms of power per rotor area. Not all the ocean has currents as high as 1 m/s, so the total abundance is put in the same category as wind, although this is likely far too generous and probably should be red. Placing machinery underwater (corrosive) and far from demand classifies this option as difficult. On the plus side, the current should be stable, eliminating intermittency worries, unlike wind. None of our electricity mix comes from ocean currents at present, so it cannot be said to have been meaningfully demonstrated. For the remaining categories: it is electricity only; we might expect little resistance to underwater installations; and no backyard opportunity.
    Ocean Waves (Sec. 16.4; p. 282): While they seem strong and ever-present, waves are a linear-collection phenomenon, and not an areal phenomenon. As a consequence, not that much power arrives at shores all around. the world (a few TW at best). It is not particularly difficult to turn wave motion into useful electricity at high efficiency, and the proximity to land makes access, maintenance, and transmission far less worrisome than for the previous two ocean-based cases. Intermittency-largely seasonal—is moderate as storms and lulls come and go. Prototype concepts abound, and a few are being tested at commercial scale. So this is further along than the previous two oceanic sources, but not so much as to earn a blue box. Push-back would be moderate from people whose ocean views are spoiled, or who benefit from natural wave energy hitting the coast. Few people have access to waves in their backyard.

    D-T Fusion (Sec. 15.5; p. 264): The easier of the two fusion options, involving deuterium and tritium, represents a longstanding goal under active development since 1950. The well-funded international effort, ITER, plans to accomplish a 480 second pulse of 500 MW power25 by 2035. This defines the pinnacle of hard. Fusion brings with it numerous advantages: enormous power density; only moderate radioactive waste products; and abundant deuterium.26 Fusion would have no intermit- tency issues, can directly produce heat and derivative electricity, but like the others does not directly address transportation. The non-existent tritium can be knocked out of lithium with neutrons, and even though we are not awash in lithium, we have enough to last many thousands of years in the absence of demand for batteries. We might expect some public opposition to D-T fusion due to the necessary neutron flux and associated radioactivity. Fusion is the highest-tech energy we can envi- sion at present, requiring a team of well-educated scientists/technicians to run-meaning don't plan on building one in your backyard, unless you can afford to have some staff PhDs on hand.
    D-D Fusion (Sec. 15.5; p. 264): Replacing tritium with deuterium means abundance of materials is no concern whatsoever for many billions of years. As a trade, it's substantially harder than D-T fusion.27 D-D fusion requires higher temperatures, making confinement that much more difficult. It is for this reason that we make a single exception to the scoring scheme and give D-D fusion a -2 score for difficulty.
    17.3 Student Rankings
    In Winter 2020, students at UC San Diego did Problem 11 from this chapter, which asks them to come up with their own weighting for the ten attributes in the comparison matrix, rather than the simple but poorly-justified practice of giving each category the same weight. This section reports the result from that exercise.
    On average, the weights did not deviate dramatically from uniform, the adjustments being within a factor of 1.5 for all cases: ranging from 0.66 to 1.47, when each student's weighting was re-normalized after the fact to add to ten points. The attributes getting a clear boost were abundance, efficiency, and transportation capability. Those getting lower weight were the backyard criterion, acceptance, and ability to produce heat.2 What this is that students, on the whole, value solutions that can

    importance of the attributes-thus much of the behavior is "baked in" based on the author's judgment of color assignment. Still, shifting emphasis on the attributes will shuffle the order somewhat, and that itself is interesting. Any ambitious reader is welcome to mess with the color scheme as well to see what happens.
    17.4 Upshot: The Fossil Fuel Gap
    The subjective nature of this exercise certainly allows numerous pos- sibilities for modifying the box rankings in one direction or the other. The matrices embody some biases, but no attempt by anyone would be free from bias. The result, in this case, is dramatic. Even allowing some manipulation, the substantial gap between the fossil fuels and their renewable alternatives would require excessive "cooking" to close.
    A key take-away from this chapter is that we can devise methods to compare disparate sources of energy in a systematic way. The outcome does not provide an authoritative answer, but what it can do is:
    ‣ help guide our thinking;
    expose gaps that we might not otherwise appreciate;
    bring attention to the complexity of energy choices: it's more than how many terawatts are available.
    One lesson is that a transition away from fossil fuels does not appear at this time to involve superior substitutes, as has been characteristic of our energy history. The alternatives might be good enough, even if not as good as what we are accustomed to using. Fossil fuels represent a generous one-time gift from the earth. From our current vantage point, it is not clear that energy-vital to our economic activity-will be as cheap, convenient, and abundant as it has been during our meteoric ascent to the present. If not for finite supply and the CO2 problem, fossil fuels would continue to satisfy our energy needs-shifting focus to various other global-scale

    problems resulting from human pressures on the planet. Because of the downsides of fossil fuels and the inferiority of the substitutes on a number of fronts, it is unclear how we might patch together an energy portfolio out of the alternatives that allows a continuation of our current lifestyle. Even if the physics allows it, many other practical and economic barriers may limit options or successful implementations.
    Adding to the hardship is the fact that many of the alternative energy technologies-solar, wind, nuclear power, hydroelectric, and so on- require substantial up-front energy investment to build and deploy. If society waits until energy scarcity forces large-scale deployment of such alternatives, it risks falling into an "energy trap" in which aggressive use of energy needed to develop a new energy infrastructure leaves less available to society in general-a political non-starter. If there is to be a transition to a sustainable energy regime, it is best to begin it now. 31
    17.5 Problems
1. What is your overall assessment of our energy future given the presentation of alternatives to fossil fuels presented in this chapter? What key take-aways do you form?
2. What, to you, is the biggest surprise in the rank order of alternatives
   in Figure 17.2?
3. One consideration not present in the alternative energy matrix is EROEI. Identify at least one example that would likely receive a boost (move up in the rankings) if EROEI is considered, and at least one example that would likely move down as a result of considering it. Refer back to Chapter 14, both tables and text.
4. (Suggest double-credit problem) Count up the number of blue, yellow, and red squares for all ten attributes (columns) in Figure 17.2. Score each attribute the same way as energy resources were scored: +1 for blue; nothing for yellow; -1 for red.
   a) What category has the highest score? What does this tell you
   about alternative energy in terms of what is easy?
   b) What category has the lowest score? What does this tell you about what attribute is hardest to satisfy in energy production?
   c) Which two categories have the largest number of blue squares and which two have the lowest number? What do you learn in terms of what is easy and not so easy?
   d) Which category has the largest number of red squares and which two have the lowest number? What do you learn in terms of what is hardest and what is least difficult to satisfy?
   30: ... which could conceivably get only worse if humans "solved" energy, effectively unconstrained
   See Sec. 18.3 (p. 310) for more discussion of the energy trap.
   31: We can't count on better options show- ing up, and may need to get busy migrating to available choices. Fossil fuels not only drive climate change, but create an addic- tion that is best tapered slowly rather than risk chaos and war if we remain completely reliant on a dwindling crucial resource.

5. Why is it so hard to satisfy transportation needs? What is it about fossil fuels that has made transportation so much easier than electrified transport would be?
6. Verify-showing work-the claim on page 292 that a car refueling at a gasoline station is transferring energy at a rate in the neigh- borhood of 15 MW if the transfer rate is about 6 gallons (23 L) per minute32 and gasoline contains about 34 MJ per liter.
7. What is at about the backyard33 attribute that earns so many red scores? What does this tell you about access to energy and the complexity of its capture/use?
8. What two resources are crippled by intermittency? How might that challenge be mitigated so that it is less problematic? What are some difficulties in this solution?
9. If biofuels turn out to be hampered by low EROEI values, the only transportation-friendly option left is artificial photosynthesis, which was not covered in this book because it's not a "real thing" at this time—as captured by the two red squares for difficulty and demonstrated. Two questions:
   a) What other resources are in a similar "not real yet" state,
   based on the same red squares?
   b) What is most encouraging about the prospect of obtaining liquid fuels from sunlight? What problems does it solve for solar power and for transportation?
10. Figure 17.2 left out firewood as an energy resource, even though it has been with us for a long time and will no doubt continue to provide home heating. What would the ten colors be for this resource of intermediate abundance in the context of home heating? What would its score be, and which sources is it then tied with? Justify each of your color choices.
11. (Suggest triple-credit problem) For the sake of simplicity and transparency, the scoring system used a simple uniform weighting for each of the 10 attributes, but it is unlikely all ten are equally important. Make up your own weighting scheme. 34 For each energy resource, blue cells add the corresponding category's weight, and red subtracts, and yellow does nothing. Re-score the matrix using your own weights-including the fossil fuels. Now re-order the matrix from highest to lowest score and comment on any major upheaval from the nominal ordering. What are the big surprises? Did the fossil fuel gap persist?
    32: Time it yourself some time.
    33: ...just shorthand for energy on a per- sonal scale at home
    Different students may get different results, but this will provide some appreci- ation for considerations that enter the cre- ation of such a scoring scheme.
    34: A category might be worth 2 points, 0.3 points, 5 points, or whatever you wish; need not add to 10
    First, make sure you can reproduce the scor- ing in the present table based on all weights being 1.0.
