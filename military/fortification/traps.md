## Mines
- usually stationary explosive device

### Mine clearing
- Unmanned Ground Vehicles (UGV) are oft used.
- Mine Clearing Line Charge (MICLIC) is a rocket-projected explosive line charge which provides a "close-in" demining capability.
  - Example: M58 provides a lane 8 meters by 100 meters (8.75 yards by 109 yards)

### Seismic mine
- the mine is laid with its "legs" spread, it then gives the soldiers six minutes to leave before going into sentry mode, analyzing ground fluctuations, thanks to which it then calculates the coordinates of the target.

## Loitering munitions
- Cheaper UAVs which fly around till the target shows itself.
