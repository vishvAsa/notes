Alright team, afternoon thread on fortifications in light of the ongoing Russian offensive. The Donbass right now is probably the most heavily-fortified place on earth besides the Korean DMZ. Fortifications can range from shell craters to underground fortresses. Let's dive in.

The most basic "fortification" is simply a good piece of cover found out in the wild. The process of turning that good piece of cover into a proper fighting position is known as "position improvement" in the US Army.

Battle positions intended for deliberate use should be planned out properly ahead of time, with ranges and fields of fire integrated, target references established, dead zones covered with indirect fire and booby-traps, etc. Then it's time to start digging. 

## Infantry
For soldiers, fighting positions develop from shallow scrapes, to foxholes, to proper bunkers with overhead cover. Levels of overhead cover can vary quite a bit. The ones pictured are made out of thin logs and would only be good against shell splinters. To withstand direct artillery strikes you need a meter of earth at least. This is a serious construction project!

Trenches and tunnels can be then developed to connect individual fighting positions to allow troops to move about freely and reinforce stressed areas of the line. These also provide additional space to fight from and stage troops for attacks, etc. Trenches are generally provided with shell-proof dugouts sunk into the sides of the trench to allow troops to shelter during bombardment, and to provide safe(r) living areas for the occupying troops, as well as command posts and so on.

Entrenched Ukrainian defenses, heavily bombarded and recently taken by DPR troops, can be seen in this recent video of Checkpoint 29. This is what it looks like in the field. And all of this was just for the infantry. 

## Armored vehicles and artillery 
Armored vehicles and artillery require their own positions, generally constructed by bulldozer instead of by hand.

The basic position for a fighting vehicle is "hull down," with only the turret exposed. As the position develops the engineers will dig out additional sections to the rear to allow the tank to completely hide in the position, to roll forward only when ready to engage. An intermediate position exposes only the turret-top sighting devices.

Berms are a bad idea for anything liable to take an APFSDS +++(Armour-piercing fin-stabilized discarding sabot)+++ round, but they work fine for shell splinters. Most non-tank/IFV positions (artillery, command posts, trucks, etc.) will be bermed up around the piece to be protected rather than dug. It's easier to do.

Fortifications can also be constructed up in some circumstances rather than dug in, although against a serious threat it can be a "worst practice" because they're very prominent. HESCO made a fortune providing earth bins to do this in Iraq and Afghanistan. 

Addendum: Fighting vehicles generally will not permanently occupy their battle positions - they'll stage at a "hide site" nearby and roll into their BPs once they're alerted to an attack. This hide sight and sometimes the route itself may also be dug in.

## Tunnels
The best practice in the modern day seems to be constructing tunnels between camouflaged bunkers. This echoes French practice on the (very effective but very bypassed) Maginot line, as well as Japanese practice in the Pacific, and Chinese and Vietnamese techniques since.+++(4)+++

We've seen reports so far of Ukraine doing this in some particularly hot sections of the front near Donetsk city, with tunnels connecting camouflaged positions constructed inside of houses. North Korea and Iran certainly maintain vast networks of underground facilities.

While precision weapons can certainly destroy individual bunkers if they've been identified, overrunning an entire fortified complex protected by obstacles is another task entirely. We'll get into that one later.
