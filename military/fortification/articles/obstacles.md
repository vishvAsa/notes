Alright team, in light of the ongoing Russian offensive in the Donbass we'll be talking obstacles, protective fortifications, and getting through them. First up will be tactical obstacles. There's a key distinction here - I'll be specifically speaking to obstacles intended to keep an enemy from moving through an area. Many kinds of fortifications are purely or partially protective of your own troops - I'll cover those later.

Obstacles can either be deployed "protectively" - to keep the enemy from overrunning your battle positions, or "tactically" - to funnel them into a kill zone, delay them, or otherwise force them to move in a way you want them to. 

Little-appreciated fact - machine guns didn't cause the stalemate of the WWI Western Front. Barbed wire did, by forcing attacking troops to slow down to work their way through the wire and keeping them exposed to gunfire and artillery. Barbed wire remains a key part of any obstacle scheme, deployed as either "straight" wires or in concertina coils. To make something that enemy troops can't just carefully walk or crawl through takes a lot more time and effort than you'd think. Don't believe me? Ask the Vietnamese, they got really, really good at it. Barbed wire is evil stuff, it can even tangle up tracked vehicles if you use enough of it.

Next up is ditches. Antitank ditches can be used as fighting positions in a pinch, but generally you want an infantry trench to be narrow to protect from airbursts. AT ditches need to be wide and deep, to the point that tanks can't get across them properly.

Roads can be cratered with explosives, and trees felled to create an abatis. The terrain can also be flooded to create a near-impassible mire.

## Mines
And I haven't even gotten into land mines. Minefields are one of the fastest obstacles to emplace, and they can be seeded into constructed obstacles to make clearance extremely hazardous. They can also be laid remotely by aircraft, rockets, and artillery. They can also remain extremely hazardous for an extremely long time.

Still-extant Argentine minefield on the Falklands pictured, deliberately left uncleared to provide a penguin sanctuary. Most old minefields have much grimmer long-term results. Clearance can take decades. All of this is integrated together into a planned set of obstacles designed to keep the enemy where you want them - in your kill zone, and out of your fighting positions.

Next up will be those fighting positions, and then I'll get into clearing through all of this.

Addendum: There's all kinds of other obstacles beyond just these.
