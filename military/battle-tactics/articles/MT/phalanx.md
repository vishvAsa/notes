The "Companion Cavalry" was a key element of Alex's force that people often neglect. On the Indian terrain in the Panjab the phalanx seems to have fared poorly & in more direct combat the Macedonians were pulped by the elephant corps. Then there are mobile archers. The Roman testudo was well protected in the flanks but still could be harried by the Iranian archers playing the long game.
