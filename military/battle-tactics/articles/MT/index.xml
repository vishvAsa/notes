      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The correct ques, which Greeks thought about a lot was opposite&amp;ndash;&amp;ldquo;How do you even protect this formation?&amp;rdquo; The answer lied in being very selective about terrain, actively deploying lighter troops &amp;amp; cavaliers to protect, have competent generals &amp;amp; rank who can stop them from panicking.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As anyone can see, these are highly immobile and aren&amp;rsquo;t solid blocks which will remain standing even if you chip at one end &amp;ndash; they come falling down immediately. You can&amp;rsquo;t turn them either, only two occasions are known when they were turned.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
