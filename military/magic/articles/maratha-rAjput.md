According to Sabhasad Bakhar, Mirza Rajah Jai Singh before embarking on his Deccan campaign—against CSM and Bijapur sultanate—sponsored a grand three-month-long sacrifice, employing 400 brahmins, in order to propitiate the Goddess Bagalamukhi-Kalaratri. The Bakhar further claims the Goddess Tuljabhavani possessed Chhatrapati and advised him to broker peace with Mirza Rajah, warning him of his inability to defeat the latter, as he had turned invincible for the time being as a result of his tantric penances.

Similarly, when Mirza Rajah's son Rajah Ram Singh, punished with the appointment of the distant Kamrup campaign, for his complicity in CSM's escape from Agra, he took Guru Tegh Bahadur, with him after managing the latter's release from Aurangzeb's custody. While the Rajah acted as the Guru's temporal protector, the Guru was his supernatural protector. The Guru would engage in duels with the infamous Mayong magicians. In one encounter, a witch hurled a huge stone towards the Guru, which he deflected, making the witches submit.
