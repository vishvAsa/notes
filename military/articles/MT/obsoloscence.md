Unfortunately, the dynamics of war are like natural selection: in the early stages, much of the variation in ability, tactics and weaponry gets culled. What survives becomes "battle-hardened" stable strategies for a while until they are invaded by invention of new upAya-s. Hence, tactical and to an extant strategic diversity benefits from maintaining an innate pool of diversity to provide the variation to counter upAya-s that break hitherto stable upAya-s. That's the lesson of all life.
