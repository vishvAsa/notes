      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Q: You have mentioned that there are parallels between the maintenance of sex and that of a military in fighting shape. What are they and how are they geopolitically relevant?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;sex&#34;&gt;Sex&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In prokaryotes sex is casual. They exchange genetic material routinely, often across distant phylogenies, because DNA is not just a genetic molecule but also a structural molecule that holds together their biofilms. One of the defining events that marked the origin of eukaryotes was the institutionalization of sex. It is an expensive process because it means meiosis and sharing half your genetic material with another individual. Often the process of finding a partner is a failure resulting in a genetic endgame. Yet, sex is rather persistently maintained throughout eukaryotic evolution despite the ease with which one could reproduce by forming clones. In fact, many organisms forego their clonal reproduction for sex. Why is this so?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&#34;https://x.com/blog_supplement/status/1922883195000770930&#34;&gt;TW&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, the dynamics of war are like natural selection: in the early stages, much of the variation in ability, tactics and weaponry gets culled. What survives becomes &amp;ldquo;battle-hardened&amp;rdquo; stable strategies for a while until they are invaded by invention of new upAya-s. Hence, tactical and to an extant strategic diversity benefits from maintaining an innate pool of diversity to provide the variation to counter upAya-s that break hitherto stable upAya-s. That&amp;rsquo;s the lesson of all life.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
