      <description>&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&#34;https://unrollthread.com/t/1516948748756078592/&#34;&gt;TW&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Alright team, quick thread tonight on &amp;ldquo;morale.&amp;rdquo; I&amp;rsquo;ll get back to obstacle breaching tomorrow. Amateur military enthusiasts bandy the term about constantly. But what is morale, really? Like most things in the military it&amp;rsquo;s both far more and far less than it&amp;rsquo;s cracked up to be.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Far more&amp;rdquo; because morale can be shorthand for unit cohesion, which is extremely important. However, most amateurs use the term in the sense of &amp;ldquo;how happy are the troops right now?&amp;rdquo; That&amp;rsquo;s generally quite unimportant. Let&amp;rsquo;s consult Maslow&amp;rsquo;s Hierarchy of Needs to explain why. Soldiers in combat generally exist at the rock bottom of the pyramid of needs. They are primarily going to be concerned with their basic physiological needs - food, water, warmth, and sleep. All of those get put on the back burner in combat. This is not a recipe for happiness. Troops in the field are basically homeless people with guns.+++(5)+++ Being hungry, cold, tired, sleeping in uncomfortable places way too close to people you don&amp;rsquo;t particularly like, and in constant danger is part of the job.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&#34;https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1537290958219333632.html&#34;&gt;TW&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Alright team, I owe you guys a thread on battle theory. Let&amp;rsquo;s talk force employment and why no single weapon system is ever going to be a &amp;ldquo;game-changer&amp;rdquo; in modern war&amp;hellip; at least between opponents who know what they&amp;rsquo;re doing.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The key to understanding why is grasping the concept of the &amp;ldquo;empty battlefield,&amp;rdquo; something which emerged in the late 19th century but which truly came into its own during the First World War. Prior to WWI, armies stood out of the terrain. Soldiers wore bright uniforms, carried standards into battle, and little if any thought was paid to camouflage except by specialized units.+++(5)+++ If there was a battle going on, it was usually pretty obvious.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
