## Riding
- Bare back riding is very uncomfortalbe for both the rider and the horse - delicate spine protrudes.

### Blankets
- Alexander depicted in Roman mosaic was riding on a blanket; no stirrups; no belt under the horse to hold the blanket in place.
- Horses needed to be gripped with thighs.  Alexandrian Greek horse riding manual : "Riding a horse is like standing upright on your thighs". This while galloping at 20 kms per hour and weilding bows and lances, controlling the horse with the bridle.
- Can't use a buckle - the blanket would keep rotating.

### Saddles
- First around 100BCE. Slowly spread.
- Superior weight distribution.
- Relief for the spine - so gap or rise in the middle is critical.
- Precise fit required for best effect.
- Increased weight bearing capacity.
- Could now use a buckle - to keep saddle in place.

### Stirrups
- Seen in sanchi 200 BCE.
- No longer holding on to the horse with thighs.
- Another way to control the horse (+ can add spurs).
- better weight distribution for horse.
- By 600 AD seen from Central Asia to Europe. By 700 AD, seen in Iran as well.
