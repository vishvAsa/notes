- Relatively flat plains. Good horses need to run around in the first year.
- More grass implies more horses.

## Suitable Spots
- Eastern steppe, aka Mongolian-Manchurian steppe - between Tibet, below altai mountains, from Taklamakan desert right up to Manchurian mountains.
  - Very undulating terrain.
  - Severe cold winds from the north - climate change prone.
  - Very fertile. Lush green grass.
- Kazakh Steppe (Central Steppe) - Mostly desert -  Kara-Kum, Kizil-kum. Amu and Syr darya-s draining into Aral Sea provide water. Turan area. Big fertile patches surrounded by flat desert provide good horse growing areas. Sournce of major invasions into India. 
  - In the south east is the fergAna valley.
  - In the west : Khwarezm oasis, Samarkand oasis and Bukhara oasis along the Zeravshan River. Khwarezm is bigger than sAmarkanD and bukhAra put together - hence dominated those + oft persia.
- Pontic–Caspian steppe (Western Steppe) - above black sea.
  - Drier grassland compared to Eastern steppe. 
  - Bulgaria / Thrace. Source of Greek horces. Very fertile.
- Miscellaneous Europenan spots
  - Macedonian depression
  - Hungarian plains
- Persia
  - Southern caspian.
  - South of herat in afghAnistAn.
- Arabia
  - Southern Arabia and Yemen (Tihamah) - narrow coastal fog fed fertile patch. Horse growing area much bigger than that in India.
- India
  - Tiny sliver between kAThiawar, mewar, mArvAr. Famous Indian breeds - balUchi, kAThiawadi, mewari. Most of kAThiawar peninusula: Shrubbery prevents massive horse-rearing. Mewar/ mArvAr - much drier, less fertile than say - similar sized sAmarkanD oasis.
  - One hourse would take area which would support 60 people.
  - Gangetic plain is flat - but forested and agriculture intensive.
- US great plains
- Uruguay, argentina

## Central Asia
Central Asia & Middle East didn’t have horses until 1500 years after Europe did. Their raiders were less effective, & improvements on land were more valuable as result of lack of horses perhaps. No wild horses in southern Central Asia - only onagers. Horses first introduced around 2000 BC - same time as Mesopotamia & Iran. They were not eaten, & were a status symbol & trade commodity imported from the steppe.
