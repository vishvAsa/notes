Two englishmen [talking](https://t.co/244fplvRAL) about a crossbow and a longbow. Having not shot in ages I've totally lost longbow accuracy. But some years ago an acquaintance showed me how to shoot a crossbow. Reasonable accuracy could be gained the next day. Speed vs accuracy might have been a major factor -- I know this first hand having shot from both longbows & crossbow in the past. 

It is notable that though both chIna-s & Iranians on the respective flanks, & H kingdoms of SE Asia extensively used crossbows. The subcontinental H seem to have used it much less. In fact that picture you posted is the only one I know of from early time. However, the jAmadagnya interpreted as the mahAshara-yantra (mentioned by kauTilya) might have used ballista.

One could make the case that the hand-arm crossbow-wielding cultures did no better than those or even worse against a good volley of fire from a composite bow. If it were revolutionary, I would not see H dropping after acquiring multiply: even in medieval.
