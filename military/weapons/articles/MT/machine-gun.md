Sometimes a technology takes a long time to really meet its potential. This is well illustrated by the machine gun.

- The American Gatling invents a primitive version of it and sells it to many countries. The Union side uses it during the American civil war but does not realize its utility.
- A little later, the Americans underperform with it in their wars against the First American tribal armies. 
- The British buy it from Gatling and then adopt it for their war against African tribal armies, and show its true military potential for the first time, mowing down charging Zulus and others.

- Another American inventor, Maxim (who competed with Edison on the electric bulb), working for the British, invents the modern (automatic) version of the machine gun before the Americans even realized the full potential of Gatling’s weapon. 
- The Brits again show its potential in putting down African tribal armies. 
- However, neither the Brits on the Americans really show its potential against modern armies.

-In the meantime, the French invent their own machine gun (Canon à Balles) and use it against the Germans (Prussians). Despite slaughtering the German infantry in one battle with it, they screw up tactically, and the Germans neutralized it with their long-range cannons. 
- The Germans capture all their units but, seeing it as a losing weapon, sell it back to the French after the war.

- An Austrian nobleman, Baron von Ujezd, invents a new gas-operated air-cooled version of the machine gun as opposed to Maxim's water-cooled version. The American-French company Hotchkiss buys the patent for this.
- Danes follow suit and invent their own machine gun, the Madsen. It is the first light machine gun that can be used by a single soldier.

- The Germans procure the Maxim early on due to the Kaiser intuitively seeing its potential and start its domestic production, but remain unsure about its tactical utility.
- The first to figure out how revolutionary these guns truly were, were the Rus and the Japanese. The Rus bought the Maxim version from the British and the Madsen from the Danes. The Japanese bought the Hotchkiss from the French. They fielded these in their epic confrontation of 1904-1905, which was in many ways a dress rehearsal for WW1. Both sides were able to inflict heavy losses on the other with these guns, but in the end, the offensive use of these weapons by the Nipponese was one of the factors that swung the war in their favor.

- The Germans, studying all this, soon took it seriously to become the best machine gun force in the world, superior to their British and French enemies. Their prowess with the weapon was seen early in the war as they massacred thousands of French troops in key encounters. Yet, despite their upper hand in this department, they lost the war.

So too in biology, the invention of a biochemical weapon can go through many rounds of transfer from organism to organism across the tree of life until its full potential is realized.
