      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have proposed that more popular a weapon with early IEans, the more likely they were to incorporate non-IE words for them: a predominantly oral culture tends to acquire clusters of synonyms for meeting metrical constraints. We see this for bow, arrow &amp;amp; axe. Compare it to organisms with a diversified metabolism acquiring multiple paralogous copies of genes of enzymes catalyzing a similar reaction in slightly different biochemical contexts.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Two englishmen &lt;a href=&#34;https://t.co/244fplvRAL&#34;&gt;talking&lt;/a&gt; about a crossbow and a longbow. Having not shot in ages I&amp;rsquo;ve totally lost longbow accuracy. But some years ago an acquaintance showed me how to shoot a crossbow. Reasonable accuracy could be gained the next day. Speed vs accuracy might have been a major factor &amp;ndash; I know this first hand having shot from both longbows &amp;amp; crossbow in the past.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It is notable that though both chIna-s &amp;amp; Iranians on the respective flanks, &amp;amp; H kingdoms of SE Asia extensively used crossbows. The subcontinental H seem to have used it much less. In fact that picture you posted is the only one I know of from early time. However, the jAmadagnya interpreted as the mahAshara-yantra (mentioned by kauTilya) might have used ballista.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
