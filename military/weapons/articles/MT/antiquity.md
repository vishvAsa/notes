I have proposed that more popular a weapon with early IEans, the more likely they were to incorporate non-IE words for them: a predominantly oral culture tends to acquire clusters of synonyms for meeting metrical constraints. We see this for bow, arrow & axe. Compare it to organisms with a diversified metabolism acquiring multiple paralogous copies of genes of enzymes catalyzing a similar reaction in slightly different biochemical contexts.
