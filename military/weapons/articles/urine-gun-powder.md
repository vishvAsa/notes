The Ahoms used to make gunpowder from cow urine. The process involved setting up a cow shed with the floor being made of soil & dung. For over a period of 6 months, the regular discharge of urine from the cows was allowed to settle on the floor. 

Later, the cows were moved out and the shed kept closed for a year. White salt particles gradually emerge as bacteria in the soil-dung start the bio-oxidation process resulting in formation of nitrates, mainly calcium nitrate.

(Urea->Ammonia->Nitrite ->Nitrate) 

Calcium Nitrate was converted to Potassium Nitrate (Saltpetre) by adding locally sourced Potash which was prepared by drying and burning select local plants including a few aquatic ones. 

After filtering and sun drying, the resulting Saltpetre is mixed Charcoal & Sulphur in 4:1:1 proportion to make some excellent gunpowder.
