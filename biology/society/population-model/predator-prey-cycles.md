## Hare lynx cycle
{{< figure src="../images/lynx-hare-cycle.png" title="" class="thumbnail">}}

> hare–lynx cycle described by Lotka–Volterra equations \\(\dfrac{dV}{dt} = rV - aVP \\) and \\(\dfrac{dP}{dt} = -qP + baVP\\). Here V is hare density; P is lynx density; t marks time such that dV/dt gives the rate of change in the hare density and dP/dt similarly for lynx; r, a, b and q are parameters thatdetermine how quickly hares reproduce (r), how many hares are eaten (a) for a given density of lynx and hare, how efficiently eaten hares are converted into lynx offspring (b) and how quickly lynx die when food is in short supply (q). The limit cycle is drawn using values r=0.1, a=0.2, b=0.1, and q=0.1. The predator–prey cycle shows qualitatively nice cycling, but the model is meant to beconceptual only: parameters are hardly realistic when at the peak of lynx density there are only twice as many hares as there are lynx in the forest. - Hanna Kokko's book.
