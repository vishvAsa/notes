      <description>Sounds words sentences There are sounds. Certain ordered sounds make up words. Words make up phrases (Eg: noun phrases, verb phrases), which in-turn make up sentences.
Word morphology Morpheme Parts of a word which are not further divisible are called morphemes. Eg: In &amp;lsquo;sunism&amp;rsquo;, &amp;lsquo;sun&amp;rsquo; is the root/ stem word, while &amp;lsquo;ism&amp;rsquo; is an affix; both are morphemes.
Inflection Inflectional morphemes alter the words gender, tense, number etc.: &amp;rsquo;s&amp;rsquo; in suns.</description>
