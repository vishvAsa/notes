They were buffalo hunters. They were essentially a stone-age tribe.

## War
Their war strategy was mostly guerrilla warfare. Their battles were essentially well planned raids - initially for stealing horses, cattle and captives. In raids, all adult males were automatically killed. Young children were sometimes adapted. Women were enslaved.

## Captives
They also traded in captives. THey acquired horses from the Spanish territories. They raided to capture horses and captives from others.

They routinely adapted very young captives into their tribes to adjust for their high infant mortality and low fertility.

### Torture
Captives were brutally tortured in many creative ways - including cutting off toes etc.., burning, gang-rape. This was partly due to animal nature, and partly to weaken the resolve of the enemy people (mostly the latter in the case of white people who were claiming their territory). When the latter reason became prime, torture and mutilation became especially gruesome.

## Comanche
Two main aspects of their life was the buffalo economy and battle.

### Military
All Comanche males were warriors: it was a spartan culture. THey were skillful warriors.

#### Successes and subdual
They then subdued all other tribes, including the Apache. They very successfully repressed Spanish and French expansion into the plains. They were the reason the Mexicans let Anglo-saxon settlers settle in Texas. The Anglo-saxons eventually succeeded in beating the Comanche - initially by coordinated attacks, but ultimately by killing off the buffalo herds. The weakened, starving Comanche surrendered and lived reservation lives
