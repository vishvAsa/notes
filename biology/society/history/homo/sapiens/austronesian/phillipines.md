-Butuan
-Cebu
-Madyas

"The Rajahante of Cebu was interesting because it was found by Sri Lumay who claimed Chola descent. When the Cholas invaded Sriwijaya, a branch of Cholas settled there are married native Malay wives. One of the princes went to Philippines to establish his own kingdom."

### Culture
Some places in Philippines still have names of Sanskrit etymology (eg: visaya-s, manila); local language - esp religious language borrows from deva dharma. Eg. daiwata.

## Missionary activity
"The grandson of the king, Raja Humabon would be baptised by the Spanish missionaries as Don Carlos on 14 April 1521. His consort Hara Humamay would be christened as Juana. His nephew Rajah Tupas would also be baptized later as Felipe Tupas on 21 March 1568."
