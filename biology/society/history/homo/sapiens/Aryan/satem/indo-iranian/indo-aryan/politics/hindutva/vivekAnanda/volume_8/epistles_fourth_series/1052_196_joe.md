## CXCVI

*To Miss Josephine MacLeod*

PORT TEWFICK  
*26th November, 1900*.

DEAR JOE,

The steamer was late; so I am waiting. Thank goodness, it entered the
Canal this morning at Port Said. That means it will arrive some time in
the evening if everything goes right.

Of course it is like solitary imprisonment these two days, and I am
holding my soul in patience.

But they say the change is thrice dear. Mr. Gaze's agent gave me all
wrong directions. In the first place, there was nobody here to tell me a
thing, not to speak of receiving me. Secondly, I was not told that I had
to change my Gaze's ticket for a steamer one at the agent's office, and
that was at Suez, not here. It was good one way, therefore, that the
steamer was late; so I went to see the agent of the steamer and he told
me to exchange Gaze's pass for a regular ticket.

I hope to board the steamer some time tonight. I am well and happy and
am enjoying the fun immensely. How is Mademoiselle? Where is Bois? Give
my everlasting gratitude and good wishes to Mme. Calve. She is a good
lady.

Hoping you will enjoy your trip.

Ever affectionately yours,

VIVEKANANDA.
