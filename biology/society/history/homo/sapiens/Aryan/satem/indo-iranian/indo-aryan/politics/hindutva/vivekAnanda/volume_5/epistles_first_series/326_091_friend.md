THE MATH,  
ALAMBAZAR (?),  
*14th June, 1899*.

MY DEAR FRIEND, (Raja of Khetri.)

I want your Highness in that fashion as I am here, you need most of
friendship and love just now.

I wrote you a letter a few weeks ago but could not get news of yours.
Hope you are in splendid health now. I am starting for England again on
the 20th this month.

I hope also to benefit somewhat by this sea-voyage.

May you be protected from all dangers and may all blessings ever attend
you!

I am yours in the Lord,

VIVEKANANDA.

PS. To Jagamohan my love and good-bye.
