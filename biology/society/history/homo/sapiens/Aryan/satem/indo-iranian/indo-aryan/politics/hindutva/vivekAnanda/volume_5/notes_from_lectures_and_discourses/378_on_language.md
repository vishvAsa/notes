## ON LANGUAGE

Simplicity is the secret. My ideal of language is my Master's language,
most colloquial and yet most expressive. It must express the thought
which is intended to be conveyed.

The attempt to make the Bengali language perfect in so short a time will
make it cut and dried. Properly speaking, it has no verbs. Michael
Madhusudan Dutt attempted to remedy this in poetry. The greatest poet in
Bengal was Kavikankana. The best prose in Sanskrit is Patanjali's
*Mah훮bh훮shya*. There the language is vigorous. The language of
*Hitopadesha* is not bad, but the language of *K훮dambari* is an example
of degradation.

The Bengali language must be modelled not after the Sanskrit, but rather
after the P훮li, which has a strong resemblance to it. In coining or
translating technical terms in Bengali, one must, however, use all
Sanskrit words for them, and an attempt should be made to coin new
words. For this purpose, if a collection is made from a Sanskrit
dictionary of all those technical terms, then it ill help greatly the
constitution of the Bengali language.
