SEVEN  
Statement of Intellectuals and Writers in Protest against the arrest of
Sita Ram Goel[1](#1)

  
Sir,

The following statement has been issued by a number of leading
intellectuals and writers of the country in protest against the arrest
of Shri Sita Ram Goel by the Delhi police on December 19 for printing
the Hindi translation of a scholarly study - *Understanding Islam
Through Hadis* by Ram Swarup - which was published abroad in 1982 and
which has since been through two reprints in India. The Hindi
translation was seized by the police from the premises of the binder
even before it was published. Your cooperation is requested in making it
known to our countrymen at large.

Statement

The arrest of Shri Sita Ram Goel, the well-known writer and publisher on
19 December for publishing a Hindi translation of a scholarly study on
Islam, *Understanding Islam Through Hadis* by Shri Ram Swarup, is a
deplorable event which raises grave questions of intellectual freedom in
our country. The legal aspects of the action by the Delhi police will be
gone into by the appropriate court, but the moral and political issues
involved need urgent public consideration.

The book in question - *Understating Islam Through Hadis* by Shri Ram
Swarup - was first published abroad five years ago and has since been a
subject of scholarly discussion. The author of the book is well-known
for his deep philosophical, and reflective thought on religion, informed
by a concern for man's religious quest. This study on Islam through the
*Hadis* is based on sources held in the highest esteem by Muslim
scholarship, viz., the *Hadis* collection by Muslim (the second most
authoritative compilation according to Muslim tradition), *Sirat Rasul
Allah* by Ibn Ishaq (the first authoritative biography of the Prophet),
*Tarikhi-i-Tabri*, by at-Tabri, and several other works listed in the
bibliography appended to the book. The resulting picture of Islam may or
may not meet with the approval of all those interested in the subject,
but the extent of approval a work enjoys has never been the criterion
for determining its scholarly merits, not at least in a free society.

That publication of a Hindi translation of Shri Ram Swarup's book should
attract the repressive attention of the Delhi police bodes ill for
intellectual freedom in our country. We have rather special problems of
intercommunity relations and there is a laudable concern on the part of
those in authority to establish a climate of mutual tolerance between
communities. It is, in our view, however, very doubtful if such a
climate can be built on the foundation of ignorance and suppression of
critical thought. Shri Ram Swarup's study on Islam through the *Hadis*
seeks to inform his readers on aspects of Islam about which we ought to
be far better enlightened than we have been hitherto, and therefore it
ought to receive a far greater attention from the media than it has done
so far. The book needs to be translated into all the Indian languages
and widely disseminated throughout the country. The better we understand
the major religious and cultural traditions of India the better we might
be able to pursue the goal of national integration. Those in authority
should take a national and a long term perspective on the
nation-building process rather than opt for repression of thought and
suppression of information because some people find information
disagreeable and thought uncomfortable. Without free discussion on
religious doctrines or traditions we will never achieve national
integration.
