During this period, Nanasaheb and Sadashiv rao witnessed the impact artillery had on Indian warfare. Since an attempt to recruit Muzaffar Khan Gardi had failed, and the Peshwa was keen to employ a disciple of Bussy into his army, he decided to try and recruit Ibrahim Khan. On 4 November 1757, during the battle, Nanasaheb wrote to Dattaji and asked him to offer Ibrahim Khan a job in the Maratha army. This unpublished letter in Nanasaheb's own hand reached Dattaji Scindia on 14 November 1757.

To Rajashri Dattaji Shinde Gosavi,  
My Blessings. 

There is a disturbance with Ibrahim Khan Gardi. If he agrees to come over to our side, offer him one lakh rupees and draw out the agreement that I have sent in Chiranjeev's (Vishwas rao's) letter. Everybody should act accordingly. That you have been entrusted with this duty will be duly recorded. 

Dated 21 Safar.
