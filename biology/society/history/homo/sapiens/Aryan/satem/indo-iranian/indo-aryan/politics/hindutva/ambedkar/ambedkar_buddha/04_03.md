> § 1. On Good, Evil, and Sin
>
>  1. Do good. Be no party to evil. Commit no sin.  
>  2. This is the Buddhist way of life.  
>  3. If a man should do that which is good, let him do it again and
> again, let him turn the desires of his heart thereto. Happy is the
> heaping of good.  
>  4. Think not casually of the good, saying, "it will not come to
> me." Drop by drop is the water pot filled. By little added to little
> does good grow.  
>  5. But well done is that deed which brings one no regrets, the
> fruit whereof is received with delight and satisfaction.  
>  6. Well done is the deed which, done, brings no regrets, the fruit
> whereof is received with delight and satisfaction.  
>  7. If a man does what is good, let him do it again; let him
> delight in it; the accumulation of good is delightful.  
>  8. Even a good man sees evil days, so long as his good deed does
> not ripen; but when his good deed ripens, then does the good man see
> good things.  
>  9. Let no man think lightly of good, saying in his heart, "it will
> not come right unto me." Even by the falling of water drops a
> water-pot is filled; the wise man becomes full of good, even if he
> gathers it little by little.  
>  10. Far surpassing the fragrance of sandal or incense or lotus or
> jasmine, is the fragrance of virtue.  
>  11. Faint is this fragrance of incense and sandal, but the
> fragrance of virtue ascends to the highest place.  
>  12. Treat not lightly of evil, saying, "it will not come to me."
> Drop by drop is the water pot filled. By little added to little evil
> accumulates.  
>  13. It is not well to do a deed which, done, brings regrets, the
> fruit whereof is received with tears and lamentations.  
>  14. If a man speaks or acts evil of mind, suffering follows him,
> close as the wheel the hoof of the beast that draws the cart.  
>  15. Follow not after things evil. Dwell not in negligence. Cherish
> not false ideas.  
>  16. Hasten towards the excellent, suppress all evil thoughts.
> Whoso is backward in doing good, his mind delights in evil.  
>  17. It is not well to do that deed which, done, brings regrets,
> the fruit whereof is received with tears and lamentations.  
>  18. Even an evil-doer sees happiness, so long as his evil deed
> does not ripen; but when his evil deed ripens, then does the evil-doer
> see evil.  
>  19. Let no man think lightly of evil, saying in his heart, "it
> will not come right unto me." Even by the filling of water drops a
> water-pot is filled; the fool becomes full of evil, even if he gathers
> it little by little.  
>  20. A man should hasten towards the good, and should keep his
> thought away from evil; if a man does what is good slothfully, his
> mind delights in evil.  
>  21. If a man commits a sin, let him not do it again, let him not
> delight in sin; the accumulation of evil is painful.  
>  22. Follow the law of virtue; do not follow that of sin. The
> virtuous rests in bliss in this world.  
>  23. From lust is born sorrow, from lust is born fear. To him who
> is wholly free from lust, there is neither sorrow nor fear.  
>  24. Hunger is the worst of diseases (component), existence the
> worst of distress. This knowing, in accordance with truth and fact,
> Nibbana becomes the highest happiness.  
>  25. The evil done by oneself, self-begotten, self-bred, crushes
> the doer, as a diamond breaks even a precious stone.  
>  26. He whose wickedness is very great brings himself down to that
> state where his enemy wishes him to be, as a creeper does with the
> tree which it surrounds.  
>  27. Bad deeds, and deeds hurtful to ourselves, are easy to do;
> difficult to do, what is beneficial and good.
>
>   
> § 2. On Craving and Lust
>
>  1. Do not be possessed by Craving, nor by Lust.  
>  2. This is the Buddhist way of life.  
>  3. Not in a rain of riches is satisfaction of desire to be found.
> "Unsatisfying, grievous are desires"--so the wise man well knows.  
>  4. Even in the pleasures of the heaven-worlds he takes no delight;
> his delight is in the ending of craving; he is the disciple of the
> Supremely Awakened One, the Buddha.  
>  5. From craving is born sorrow, from craving is born fear. To him
> who is wholly free from craving, there is neither sorrow nor fear.  
>  6. From craving is born sorrow, from craving is born fear. To him
> who is wholly free from craving, there is neither sorrow nor fear.  
>  7. He who gives himself to vanity, forgetting (the real aim of
> life) and grasping at pleasure, will in time envy him who has exerted
> himself in meditation.  
>  8. Let no man have attachment to anything; loss of it gives pain.
> Those who love nothing, and hate nothing, have no fetters.  
>  9. From pleasure comes grief, from pleasure comes fear; he who is
> free from pleasure knows neither grief nor fear.  
>  10. From attachment comes grief, from attachment comes fear; he
> who is free from attachment knows neither grief nor fear.  
>  11. From lust comes grief, from lust comes fear; he who is free
> from lust knows neither grief nor fear.  
>  12. From greed comes grief, from greed comes fear; he who is free
> from greed knows neither grief nor fear.  
>  13. He who possesses virtue and intelligence, who is just, speaks
> the truth, and does what is his own business--him the world will hold
> dear.  
>  14. Kinsmen, friends, and lovers salute a man who has been long
> away, and returns safe from afar.  
>  15. In like manner his good works receive him who has done good,
> and has gone from this world, as kinsmen receive a friend on his
> return.
>
>   
> § 3. On Hurt and Ill-will
>
>  1. Cause no hurt; cherish no ill-will.  
>  2. This is the Buddhist Way of Life.  
>  3. Is there in all the world a man so blameless that he gives no
> occasion for reproach, as a spirited horse gives no occasion for the
> stroke of the lash?  
>  4. By confidence, by virtue, by energy, by meditation, by
> investigation into the Truth, by perfection in knowledge and conduct,
> by recollectedness, leave ye this great suffering behind.  
>  5. The most excellent of ascetic practices is the practice of
> forbearance, of long sufferin ; most excellent of all is Nibbana"--so
> says the Buddha. He is no ascetic who does hurt to others; he is no
> disciple who works another's woe.  
>  6. To speak no ill, to do no harm, to practise restraint in
> conformity with the discipline, this is the counsel of the Buddha.  
>  7. Kill \[not\], nor cause slaughter.  
>  8. He who, seeking his own happiness, does not punish or kill
> beings who also long for happiness, will find happiness.  
>  9. If, like a shattered, metal plate (gong), thou utter nothing,
> then thou has reached Nibbana; anger is not known to thee.  
>  10. He who inflicts pain on \[an\] innocent and harmless person,
> will soon come to grief.  
>  11. He who, dressed in fine apparel of tranquillity, is quiet,
> subdued, restrained, chaste, and has ceased to find fault with all
> other beings, he indeed is an ascetic (Samana), a friar (Bhikku).  
>  12. Is there in this world any man so restrained by shame that he
> does not provoke reproof, as a noble horse the whip?  
>  13. If a man offend a harmless, pure, and innocent person, the
> evil falls back upon that fool, like light dust thrown up against the
> wind.
>
>   
> §4. On Anger and Enmity
>
>  1. Cherish no anger. Forget your enmities. Win your enemies by
> love.  
>  2. This is the Buddhist Way of Life..  
>  3. The fire of anger should be stilled.  
>  4. One who harbours the thought: "He reviled me, maltreated me,
> overpowered me, robbed me"--in him anger is never stilled.  
>  5. He who harbours not such a thought, in him anger is stilled.  
>  6. Enemy works evil to enemy, hater to hater, but whose is the
> evil?  
>  7. Let a man overcome anger by love; let him overcome evil by
> good; let him overcome the greedy by liberality, the liar by truth.  
>  8. Speak the truth, do not yield to anger; give, if thou art asked
> for little.  
>  9. Let a man leave anger, let him forsake pride, let him overcome
> all bondag ; no sufferings befall the man who is not attached to name
> and form, and who calls nothing his own.  
>  10. He who holds back rising anger like a rolling chariot, him I
> call a real driver; other people are but holding the reins.  
>  11. Conquest begets enmity; the conquered lie down in distress.
> The tranquillised lies down in happiness, dismissing alike victory and
> defeat.  
>  12. There is no fire like lust, no ill-fortune like hatred. There
> is no misery like the constituents of existence, no happiness higher
> than the Peace of Nibbana.  
>  13. For hatred does not cease by hatred at any time: hatred ceases
> by love. This is an old rule.
>
>   
> § 5. On Man, Mind, and Impurities
>
>  1. Man is what his mind makes him.  
>  2. The training of the mind to seek the good, is the first step in
> the path of Righteousness.  
>  3. This is the main teaching in the Buddhist Way of Life.  
>  4. In everything the primal element is mind. Mind is
> pre-eminent.  
>  5. If a man speaks or does evil, suffering follows him, close as
> the wheel of \[=to\] the hoof of the beast that draws the cart.  
>  6. If a man speaks or acts from uprightness of mind, happiness
> follows him, close like his never-departing shadow.  
>  7. This fickle, unsteady mind, difficult to guard, difficult to
> guide--the wise man makes it straight, as the fletcher makes straight
> the arrow.  
>  8. As quivers and throbs the water-dwelling fish, when thrown up
> out of the water on to the land, so quivers and throbs the mind
> forsaking the realm of Mara.  
>  9. Hard to control, unstable is this mind, ever in quest of
> delight. Good is it to subdue the mind. A mind subdued brings
> happiness.  
>  10. Make thyself an island, work hard; when thy impurities are
> blown away, and thou art free from guilt, thou wilt enter into the
> heavenly world of the elect.  
>  11. Let a wise man blow off the impurities of himself, as a smith
> blows off the impurities of silver, one by one, little by little, and
> from time to time.  
>  12. As the impurity which springs from the iron, when it springs
> from it, destroys it; thus to \[=do\] a transgressor's own works, lead
> him to the evil path.  
>  13. But there is a taint worse than all taints. Ignorance is the
> greatest taint. O mendicants! throw off that taint, and become
> taintless.  
>  14. Life is easy to live for a man who is without shame--a crow
> here, a mischief maker, an insulting, bold, and wretched fellow.  
>  15. But life is hard to live for a modest man, who always looks
> for what is pure, who is disinterested, quiet, spotless, and
> intelligent.  
>  16. He who destroys life, who speaks untruth, who in the world
> takes what is not given him, who goes to another man's wife.  
>  17. And the man who gives himself to drinking intoxicating
> liquors--he, even in this world, digs up \[=digs\] his own grave.  
>  18. O man, know this: that the unrestrained are in a bad state;
> take care that greediness and vice do not bring thee to grief for a
> long time.  
>  19. The world gives according to its faith or according to its
> pleasure; if a man frets about the food and the drink given to others,
> he will find no rest either by day or by night.  
>  20. He in whom that feeling is destroyed, and taken out with the
> very root, finds rest by day and by night.  
>  21. There is no fire like passion, there is no torrent like
> greed.  
>  22. The fault of others is easily perceived, but that of oneself
> is difficult to perceive; a man winnows his neighbour's faults like
> chaff, but his own faults he hides, as a cheat hides the bad dice from
> the player.  
>  23. If a man looks after \[=looks for\] the faults of others, and
> is always inclined to be offended, his own passions will grow, and he
> is far from the destruction of passions.  
>  24. Refrain from all evil; cultivate the good; cleanse your own
> thoughts; this is the teaching of the Buddha.
>
>   
> § 6. On Self and Self-Conquest
>
>  1. If one has self, let him practise self-conquest.  
>  2. This is the Buddhist Way of Life.  
>  3. Self is the lord of self-- who else could be the lord? With
> self well subdued, a man finds a lord such as few can find.  
>  4. The foolish man who scorns the rule of the venerable (arahat),
> of the elect (ariya), of the virtuous, and follows a false doctrine,
> he bears fruit to his own destruction, like the fruits of the Katthaka
> reed.  
>  5. By oneself the evil is done, by oneself one suffers; by oneself
> evil is left undone, by oneself one is purified. The pure and the
> impure (stand and fall) by themselves, no one can purify another.  
>  6. He who loves looking for pleasures only, his senses
> uncontrolled, immoderate in his food, idle and weak, will certainly be
> overthrown by his own overdoing, as the wind throws down a weak
> tree.  
>  7. He who lives without looking for pleasures, his senses well
> controlled, moderate in his food, faithful and strong, he will not be
> overthrown any more than the wind throws down a rocky mountain.  
>  8. If to himself a man is dear, let him keep close watch upon
> himself.  
>  9. First establish thyself in the right; then thou mayest counsel
> others. Let not the wise man give occasion for reproach.  
>  10. Oneself, they say, is hard to control. If one shapes oneself
> according as one counsels others, thus well controlled, one will have
> control over others.  
>  11. A man pays in himself for the evil he has done, and in himself
> is purified. The good and evil are purified severally, no one purifies
> another.  
>  12. Though one should conquer in battle thousands and thousands of
> men, who shall conquer himself, he is the greatest of warriors.  
>  13. First establish thyself in the right, then thou mayest counsel
> others. Let not the wise man give occasion for reproach.  
>  14. If one shapes oneself according as one counsels others, thus
> well controlled, one will have control over others. Oneself, they say,
> is hard to control.  
>  15. Verily oneself is the guardian of oneself. What other guardian
> should there be? Guarded by oneself, one gets a guardian the like of
> which is not likely gotten.  
>  16. If to himself a man is dear, let him keep close watch upon
> himself.  
>  17. A man pays in himself for the evil he has done, and in himself
> is purified. The good and evil are purified severally, no one purifies
> another.  
>  18. Verily oneself is the guardian of oneself; what other guardian
> should there be? Guarded by oneself, one gets a guardian the like of
> which is not easily gotten.
>
>   
> § 7. On Wisdom, Justice, and Good Company
>
>  1. Be wise, be just, and choose good company.  
>  2. This is the Buddhist Way of Life.  
>  3. If you see a man who shows you what is to be avoided, who
> administers reproofs and is intelligent, follow that wise man as you
> would one who tells of hidden treasures; it will be better, not worse,
> for him who follows him.  
>  4. Let him admonish, let him teach, let him forbid what is
> improper--he will be beloved of the good, by the bad he will be
> hated.  
>  5. Do not have evil-doers for friends, do not have low people for
> friends; have virtuous people for friends, have for friends the best
> of men.  
>  6. He who drinks in the Dhamma lives happily with a serene mind;
> the sage rejoices always in the Dhamma as preached by the elect.  
>  7. Well-makers lead the water (wherever they like); fletchers bend
> the arro ; carpenters bend a log of wood; wise people fashion
> themselves.  
>  8. As a solid rock is not shaken by the wind, the wise people
> falter not amidst blame and praise.  
>  9. Wise people, after they have listened to the Dhamma, become
> serene, like a deep, smooth, and still lake.  
>  10. Good men indeed walk (warily) under all circumstances; good
> men speak not out of a desire for sensual gratification; whether
> touched by happiness or sorrow, wise people never appear elated or
> depressed.  
>  11. It is sweet as honey, so thinks the fool, while as yet the
> evil has not ripened. But when the evil ripens, the fool comes to
> grief.  
>  12. A fool does not know when he commits his evil deeds; but a
> wicked man burns by his own deeds, as if burnt by fire.  
>  13. Long is the night to him who is awak ; long is a mile to him
> who is tired; long is life to the foolish who do not know the true
> Dhamma.  
>  14. If a traveller does not meet with one who is his better, or
> his equal, let him firmly keep to his solitary journey; there is no
> companionship with a fool.  
>  15. "These sons belong to me, and this wealth belongs to me"--
> with such thoughts a fool is tormented. He himself does not belong to
> himself; how much less sons and wealth?  
>  16. The fool who knows his foolishness, is wise at least so far.
> But a fool who thinks himself wise, he is called a fool indeed.  
>  17. If a fool be associated with a wise man even all his life, he
> will perceive the truth as little as a spoon perceives the taste of
> soup.  
>  18. If an intelligent man be associated for one minute only with a
> wise man, he will soon perceive the truth, as the tongue perceives the
> taste of soup.  
>  19. Fools of poor understanding have themselves for their greatest
> enemies, for they do evil deeds which bear bitter fruits.  
>  20. That deed is not well done of which a man must repent, and the
> reward of which he receives crying and with a tearful face.  
>  21. Know, that deed is well done of which a man does not repent,
> and the reward of which he receives gladly and cheerfully.  
>  22. As long as the evil deed done does not bear fruit, the fool
> thinks it is like honey; but when it ripens, then the fool suffers
> grief.  
>  23. And when the evil deed, after it has become known, turns to
> sorrow for the fool, then it destroys his bright lot; nay, it cleaves
> his head.  
>  24. Let the fool wish for a false reputation, for precedence among
> the Bhikkus, for lordships in the convents, for worship among other
> people.  
>  25. A man is not an elder because his head is grey; his age may be
> ripe, but he is called "old-and-vain."  
>  26. He in whom there is truth, virtue, pity, restraint,
> moderation, he who is free from impurity and is wise, he is called an
> elder.  
>  27. An envious, stingy, dishonest man does not become respectable
> by means of much talking only, or by the beauty of his complexion.  
>  28. He in whom all this is destroyed, and taken out with the very
> root; he when freed from hatred, and wise, is called respectable.  
>  29. A man is not just if he carries a matter by violence; no, he
> who distinguishes both right and wrong, who is learned and guides
> others, not by violence, but by the same Dhamma, being a guardian of
> the Dhamma and intelligent, he is called just.  
>  30. A man is not learned simply because he talks muc ; he who is
> patient, free from hatred and fear, is called learned.  
>  31. A man is not a supporter of the Dhamma because he talks much;
> even if a man has learnt little, but sees the Dhamma bodily, he is
> supporter of the Dhamma, a man who never neglects the Dhamma.  
>  32. If a man find a prudent companion who walks with him, is wise,
> and lives soberly, he may walk with him, overcoming all dangers,
> happy, but considerate.  
>  33. If a man finds no prudent companion to walk with him, is wise,
> and lives soberly, let him walk alone, like a king who has left his
> conquered country behind, like an elephant in the forest.  
>  34. It is better to live alone, there is no companionship with a
> fool ; let a man walk alone, let him commit no sin, with few wishes,
> like an elephant in the forest.  
>  35. If the occasion arises, friends are pleasant; enjoyment is
> pleasant, whatever be the cause; a good work is pleasant, whatever be
> the cause; a good work is pleasant in the hour of death; the giving up
> of all grief is pleasant.  
>  36. Pleasant in the world is the state of a mother, pleasant the
> state of a father, pleasant the state of a Samana.  
>  37. Pleasant is virtue lasting to old age, pleasant is a faith
> firmly rooted; pleasant is attainment of intelligence, pleasant is
> avoiding of sins.  
>  38. He who walks in the company of fools suffers a long way;
> company with fools, as with an enemy, is always painful; company with
> the wise is pleasure, like meeting with kinsfolk.  
>  39. Therefore, one ought to follow the wise, the intelligent, the
> learned, the much-enduring, the dutiful, the elect; one ought to
> follow such a good and wise man, as the moon follows the path of the
> stars.  
>  40. Follow not after vanity, nor after the enjoyment of love and
> lust. He who is earnest obtains ample joy.  
>  41. When the learned man drives away vanity by earnestness, he,
> the wise, climbing the terraced heights of wisdom, looks down upon the
> fools,;free from sorrow he looks upon the sorrowing crowd, as one that
> stands on a mountain looks down upon them that stand upon the plain  
>  42. Earnest among the thoughtless, awake among the sleepers, the
> wise man advances like a richer \[=racer?\], leaving behind the hack.
>
>   
> § 8. On Thoughtfulness and Mindfulness
>
>  1. In everything be thoughtful; in everything be mindful; in all
> things be earnest and bold.  
>  2. This is the Buddhist Way of Life.  
>  3. All that we are is the result of what we have thought; it is
> founded on our thoughts, it is made up of your thoughts. If a man
> speaks or acts with an evil thought, pain follows him. If a man speaks
> or acts with a pure thought, happiness follows him. Therefore pure
> thoughts are important.  
>  4. Be not thoughtless, watch your thought! Draw yourself out of
> the evil way, like an elephant sunk in mud.  
>  5. Let the wise man guard his thoughts, for they are difficult to
> perceive, very artful, and they rush whenever they list; thoughts
> well-guarded bring happiness.  
>  6. As rain breaks through an ill-thatched house, passion will
> break through an unreflecting mind.  
>  7. As rain does not break through a well-thatched house, passion
> will not break through a well-reflecting mind.  
>  8. This mind of mine went formerly wandering about as it liked, as
> it listed, as it pleased; but I shall now hold it in thoroughly, as
> the Elder who holds the hook holds the furious elephant.  
>  9. It is good to tame the mind, which is difficult to hold in and
> tightly, rushing wherever it listeth; a tamed mind brings happiness.  
>  10. Those who bridle their mind which travels far, will be free
> from the bonds of temptation.  
>  11. If a man's faith is unsteady, if he does not know the true
> Dhamma, if his peace of mind is troubled, his knowledge will never be
> perfect.  
>  12. Whatever a hater may do to a hater, or an enemy to an enemy, a
> wrongly directed mind will do him greater mischief.  
>  13. Not a mother, not a father will do so much, nor any other
> relatives. as a well directed mind will do \[for\] us.
>
>   
> §9. On Vigilance, Earnestness, and Boldness
>
>  1. When, vigilant, the wise man puts from him negligence,
> ascending the tower of wisdom he looks down, free from sorrow, upon
> the sorrow-laden race of mankind. As from a mountain top, the wise man
> looks upon the fools in the valley.  
>  2. Vigilant among the negligent, awake among those asleep, as a
> fleet courser leaves behind a sorry nag, so go the wise.  
>  3. Give not yourselves unto negligence. Have naught to do with the
> lust of the flesh. The vigilant is given to meditation.  
>  4. Earnestness leads to where death is not; heedlessness is the
> way to death. Those who continue in earnestness do not die, but the
> heedless are as if already dead.  
>  5. Fall not away from your purpose for the sake of another,
> however great this latter may be. When once you have seen your goal,
> hold it firm and fast.  
>  6. Be watchful! Have done with indolence! Travel the True Path!
> Whoso walks thereon, happy he lives in the world.  
>  7. Idleness is a disgrace; constant sloth is defilement. By
> strenuous striving and with the help of insight, you should pull out
> the poisoned arrow of indolence.  
>  8. Give not yourselves unto negligence. Have not to do with the
> lust of the flesh. The vigilant, the given to meditation--these attain
> an overflowing happiness.  
>  9. If an earnest person has roused himself, if he is not
> forgetful, if his deeds are pure, if he acts with consideration, if he
> restrains himself and lives according to Dhamma, his glory will
> increase.
>
>   
> § 10. On Sorrow and Happiness; On Charity and Kindness
>
>  1. Poverty gives rise to sorrow.  
>  2. But removal of poverty does not necessarily give rise to
> happiness.  
>  3. Not \[a\] high standard of living, but a high standard of
> culture, is what gives happiness.  
>  4. This is the Buddhist Way of Life.  
>  5. Hunger is the worst of diseases.  
>  6. Health is the greatest of gifts, contentedness the best riches;
> trust is the best of relationships, Nibbana the highest happiness.  
>  7. We must learn to live happily indeed, not hating those who hate
> us !  
>  8. We must learn to live happily indeed, free from ailments among
> the ailing men.  
>  9. We must learn to live happily indeed, free from greed among the
> greedy.  
>  10. Mankind is ruined by passion, just as fields are damaged by
> weeds. Therefore charity done to the passionless brings great
> reward.  
>  11. Mankind is damaged by vanity, just as fields are damaged by
> weeds. Therefore charity done to those who are free from vanity brings
> great reward.  
>  12. Mankind is ruined by lust, just as fields are damaged by
> weeds. Therefore charity done to those who are free from lust brings
> great reward.  
>  13. Charity to Dhamma exceeds all gifts. The sweetness of the
> Dhamma exceeds the Dhamma. The delight in the Dhamma exceeds all
> delights.  
>  14. Victory breeds hatred, for the conquered is unhappy. He who
> has given up both victory and defeat--he, the contented, is happy.  
>  15. There is no fire like passion; there is no losing throw like
> hatred; there is no pain like this body; there is no happiness higher
> than the rest.  
>  16. Fix not your gaze upon the ill-words and ill-deeds of others,
> upon what others do or leave undone. Look rather at what \[you\] by
> yourself have done or left undone.  
>  17. Hard always is life for the modest, the seeker after purity,
> the detached, the retiring, the cleanly of life, the discerning.  
>  18. Is there in the world a man so blameless that he gives no
> occasion for reproach, as a spirited horse gives no occasion for the
> stroke of the lash? Like a spirited horse that needs not the lash, be
> fiery, be fleet.  
>  19. Do not speak harshly to anybody: those who are spoken to will
> answer thee in the same way. Angry speech is painful, blows for blows
> will touch thee.  
>  20. Liberty, courtesy, good-will and unselfishness--these are to
> the world what the linch-pin \[is\] to the chariot.  
>  21. This is the Buddhist Way of Life.
>
>   
> § 11. On Hypocrisy
>
>  1. Let not anyone speak falsely. Let not anyone lead another to
> speak falsely, nor yet approve of the action of one who speaks
> falsely. Let every kind of lying and false speech be put away from
> among you.  
>  2. As the Perfect One speaks, so He acts. As the Perfect One acts,
> so He speaks. And because He speaks as He Acts and acts as He speaks,
> therefore is He called the Perfect One.  
>  3. This is the Buddhist Way of Life.
>
>   
> § 12. On Following the Right Way
>
>  1. Choose the Right Way. Depart not from it.  
>  2. There are many paths; not all lead to the Right Way.  
>  3. The Right Path is for the happiness not of the few but of
> all.  
>  4. It must be good at the beginning, good in the middle, and good
> at the end.  
>  5. To follow the right way is to lead the Buddhist Way of Life.  
>  6. The best way is the eightfold way; the best of truths the four
> words; the best of virtues passionlessness; the best of men he who has
> eyes to see.  
>  7. This is the way, there is no other that leads to the purifying
> of intelligence. Go on this path.  
>  8. If you go on this way, you will make an end of pain! The way
> was preached by me, when I had understood the removal of the thorns
> (in the flesh).  
>  9. You yourself must make an effort. The Tathagatas are only
> preachers.  
>  10. "All created things perish"; he who knows and sees this
> becomes passive in pain.  
>  11. "All forms are unreal"; he who knows and sees this becomes
> passive in pain.  
>  12. He who does not rouse himself when it is time to rise; who,
> though young and strong, is full of sloth; whose will and thought are
> weak; that lazy and idle man never finds the way to knowledge.  
>  13. Watching his speech, well restrained in mind, let a man never
> commit any wrong with his body ! Let a man but keep these three roads
> of action clear, and he will achieve the way which is taught by the
> wise.  
>  14. Through real knowledge is gotten, through lack of real
> knowledge is lost; let a man who knows this double path of gain and
> loss thus place himself that knowledge may grow.  
>  15. Cut out the love of self, like an autumn lotus, with thy hand!
> Cherish the road of peace. Nirvana has been shown by the Sugata.  
>  16. Do not follow the evil law! Do not live on in thoughtlessness!
> Do not follow false doctrine!  
>  17. Rouse thyself! Do not be idle! Follow the law of virtue! The
> virtuous rests in bliss in this world.  
>  18. He who formerly was reckless, and afterwards became sober,
> brightens up this world, like the moon when freed from clouds.  
>  19. He whose evil deeds are covered by good deeds, brightens up
> this world, like the moon when freed from clouds.  
>  20. If a man has transgressed the one law, and speaks lies, there
> is no evil he will not do.  
>  21. Those who are ever watchful, who study day and night, and who
> strive after Nirvana, their passions will come to an end.  
>  22. This is an old saying: "They blame him who sits silent, they
> blame him who speaks much, they also blame him who says little"; there
> is no one on earth who is not blamed.  
>  23. There never was, there never will be, nor is there now, a man
> who is always blamed, or a man who is always praised.  
>  24. Beware of the anger of the tongue, and control thy tongue.
> Leave the sins of the mind, and practise virtue with thy mind.  
>  25. Earnestness is the path of Nirvana, thoughtlessness the path
> of death. Those who are in earnest do not die, those who are
> thoughtless are as if dead already.
>
>   
> § 13. Mix not True Dhamma with False Dhamma
>
>  1. Those who mistake false for true and true for false, there
> abides wrong-mindedness--they arrive not at the truth.  
>  2. Those who know true as true and false as false, there abides
> right-mindedness--these arrive at the truth.  
>  3. As rain gets into an ill-thatched house, so craving gets into
> an ill-trained mind.  
>  4. As rain gets not into a well-thatched house, so craving gets
> not into a well-trained mind.  
>  5. Arise! Be not negligent! Walk the Good Way of the Teaching! Who
> walks in the way of the teaching, happy is he in this and in all
> worlds.  
>  6. Walk the Good Way of the teaching; walk not in ways that are
> evil. Who walks in the way of the teaching, happy he lives in this and
> in all worlds.
