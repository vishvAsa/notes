## SIX SANSKRIT MOTTOES

(Reproduced from *Swami Vivekananda in America*: *New Discoveries*.
These together with the English translations, were transcribed by
Swamiji in six of his photographs.)

1\.         Ajarāmaravat prājnah vidyām  
        artham cha chintayet  
Grihita iva kesheshu mrityunā  
        dharmam ācharet

When in search of knowledge or prosperity think that thou would never
have death or disease, and when worshipping God think that death's hand
is in your hair.

  

2\.         Eka eve suhrid dharma  
       nidhanepyanuyāti yah

Virtue is the only friend which follows us even beyond the grave.  
Everything else ends with death.

VIVEKANANDA.

3\.         One infinite pure and holy — beyond  
thought beyond qualities I bow down  
to thee

Swami Vivekananda.

4\.         Samatā sarva-bhuteshu etanmuktasya lakshanam.

Equality in all beings this is the sign of the free

Vivekananda.

5\.         Thou art the only treasure in this world

Vivekananda.

6\.         Thou art the father the lord the mother the husband and love

Swami Vivekananda.
