 Blessed be the name of the Lord. After all, it is only
"Thy will be done" — our only refuge. I will not insult you by offering
you consolation — you know it all already. Only this line to remind you
of one who is in entire sympathy with you and who knows that all your
plans must be good in joy or sorrow, as you are dedicated to the eternal
Mother. Well, the Mother phenomenal has merged in the Mother absolute,
eternal. Thy will be done.

By this time you must have made a decision, or, rather, the "Mother" has
shown you the way, surely. I rest content.

The soldier of the Queen has gone abroad to fight for Her cause, leaving
all he loves to Her care. The soldier is to look to his duty. The Queen
of the Universe knows the rest.

With all love as usual,  
VIVEKANANDA.
