kaniShka's own Rabatak inscription is plainly suffused with his religious identity. He is a worshipper of  the goddesses nAnA ~ Iranic: aredvi shUrA AnahitA; goddess ummA = umA; ahura mazdha, muzhduwan= Iranic rudra; sraosha, mithra. He also indicates the identity of sraosha with kumAra & vishAkha -- evidently for this Indian subjects.  Thus we can see he was a votary of the non-Zoroastrian Iranic religion with Hindu elements. Thus, calling him H is not far from the mark.
