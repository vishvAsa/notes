The year 1906 was a landmark in Indian politics. During
this year Savarkar, the leader of the Abhinava Bharat, went
to London. That year saw the birth of the Muslim League at
Dacca. The formation of Barindranath’s revolutionai'y party
at Maniktola, a suburb of Calcutta, and the foundation of the
revolutionary institution, the Anushilan Samiti, took place
during the same year.

With a band of a few hundred youths at his command in
Maharashtra, Savarkar left India. Maharashtra was too small
a field for the young lion and the lion went in search of lions.
During those days revolutionaries from Russia, Ireland, Egypt
and China occasionally took shelter in London. Under the
garb of a law student, Savarkar also was going to enter the
gates of the Empire capital. His main object was to have a
look at the den of the British lion, to learn how to organize
a revolution and carry on the struggle for the liberation of
Hindusthan by inculcating tenets of revolution into the
brilliant brains of the cream of the Indian students, who went
abroad either for academic careers or for qualifying them-
selves for the civil service. The young orator of Maharashtra
was now to be in London, the largest debating society under
the sun.

On board the ship Persia Savarkar happened to come across
a youth named Harnam Singh who became since then a
devoted follower of Savarkar. Harnam Singh was homesick.
He was about to give up his journey to England. But Savarkar
persuaded him easily. He pointed out to him how the
adventurous and ambitious British, French and Portuguese
youths served in foreign lands for the glory and welfare of
their Motherland and how his Motherland suffered for want
of daring sons. He further said to Harnam Singh : “ Dear is
one’s own mother, but dearer, by far, is and ought to be our



28 SAVARKAR AND HIS TIMES

Motherland, the Mother of mothers of our race.”^ And
Hamam Singh went to London.

Savarkar reached London in the first week of July 1906,
and took his lodgings at the India House founded by Pandit
Shyamji Krishna Varma. In due covu*se Savarkar was
admitted to Gray’s Inn, one of the four Iims of Court in
London, Pandit Shyamji, who had awarded the Shivaji
scholarship to Savarkar, had established a Home Rule Society
and the India House during the first quarter of 1905. A
sterling patriot and a noted social reformer. Pandit Shyamji
was highly respected as an incomparable authority on Sanskrit
Works by eminent scholars like Prof. Max Muller and Prof.
Monier Williams. Born on October 4, 1857, he came of a poor
family by name Bhansali. He studied upto the Matriculation
class in the Elphinstone High School, Bombay. During his
school days he went on a lecturing tour on behalf of the Arya
Samaj as the right-hand man of Swami Dayananda. He
married the daughter of Seth Chhabildas Lallubhai and
through the influence of Prof. Monier Williams proceeded to
London in March 1879, took his B.A. at Cambridge and was
called to the bar. There he read his essay on ‘ The Origin of
Writing in India ’ in the Royal Asiatic Society of London and
was elected its member. In 1881 he was sent by the Secretary
of State for India to represent India at the Berlin Congress
of Orientalists. On his return to India he successfully served
three Indian States, Ratlam, Udaipur and Junagad either in
the capacity of a Divan, or a Member of the Council. Dtu-ing
his term of office at Junagad he went out of his way to oblige
one European officer named Maconochie, who, with the aid of
Divan, ultimately sacked the Pandit himself. This one-time
disciple of Swami Dayananda was greatly influenced by Tilak
also. After the arrest of Tilak he permanently left India for
London. There he studied Herbert Spencer and was deeply
influenced by his philosophy, so much so that he announced
at the latter’s fvmeral on December 4, 1903, a donation of
£1,000 for establishing a Lectureship in the name of his
English Guru in the University of Oxford.

Through the columns of his Indian Sociologist Pandit
Shyamji started agitation for Home Rule for India. Observing

Savarkar’s whole-hearted devotion to the cause of freedom,
burning mission and phenomenal energy, he developed a
paternal affection for Savarkar. He went over to the
Abhinava Bharat, and was initiated into its fold. In 1907 he
entrusted the management of the India House entirely to
Savarkar and left for Paris. Few have spent so much,
struggled so hard, and donated so abundantly towards the
freedom movement of India as Pandit Shyamji, the great
patriot, did in those early days of difficulties, dangers and
despair of Indian Freedom Movement. He was a lover of
Spencer’s dictum that ‘ re.sistance to aggression is not simply
justifiable but imperative What was most striking, he had
ruthlessly denounced Gandhiji for helping the British against
the Boers who fought for their liberation.

It is worth mentioning what the Muslim students thought
of this India House. Mr. Ziauddin Ahmed, then in Germany,
warned Mr. Abdulla Sulmawardy in these clear words : “ You
know that we have a definite political policy at Aligarh, i.e.
the policy of Sir Syed ... I understand that Mr. Krishna
Varma has founded a society called ‘ Indian Home Rule
Society ’ and you are also one of its vice-presidents. Do you
really believe that the Mohammedans will be profited if Home
Rule be granted to India ? . . . There is no doubt that this
Home Rule is decidedly against the Aligarh policy. . . . What
I call the Aligarh policy is really the policy of all the
Mohammedans generally — of the Mohammedans of Upper
India particularly.” ^ Mr. Asaf Ali wrote to Pandit Shyamji
in September 1909 : “ I am staying with some Muslim friends
who do not like me to associate with nationalists ; and, to save
many unpleasant consequences, I do not want to irritate them
unnecessarily.” - Thus the Muslim antagonism to the Freedom
Movement of India dates back to its beginning itself.

n

As soon as Savarkar established himself, he started the
“ Free India Society It was a recruiting institution of the
Abhinava Bharat and worked openly. Savarkar organised
Indian students and transformed majority of them into patriots

1 S. L Karandikar, Savarkar-Charitra, pp. 132-33.

30 SAVARKAR AND HIS TIMSS

and martyrs. His magnetic personality brought Bhai Parma-
nanda, then a well-known leader of light and learning, into the
revolutionary movement. He attracted Lala Hardayal. A
staimch Hindu, Hardayal had an instinctive disbelief in, and
hatred for, the Muslims. He was a man of strong emotions and
great vision, and wielded a mighty pen. Savarkar’s another
colleague was Vireiidianath Chattopadhyaya, brother of the
late Mrs. Sarojini Naidu. He was a student at the Middle
Temple Inn and was expelled during Savarkar’s slonny days
in London. A great bi'ain and a brilliant journalist, he died
mysteriously an exile in tiie custody of Stalin’s Russia during
World War II. Sri V. V. S. Aiyer, a lawyer from Rangoon,
had been to London for qualifying himself for the bar. He
was drawn to the Abhinava Bharat by Savarkar and became
the Vice-President of the Abhinava Bharat and the right-hand
man of Savarkar. Aiyer was a saintly soul who lived a life
of sacrifice and worship. Sri Sardarsinghji Rana hailed from
one of the old ruling families of Kathiawar. He had natur-
alised in France and was a fearless supporter of the struggle
for Indian Independence.

Sri Gyanchand Varma was Secretary of the Abhinava
Bharat, and was a man of great capacity and calibre. Madame
Cama was another great patriotic personality. She was
previously secretary to Dadabhai Naoroji while he was a
member of the British Parliament. She accepted the
revolutionary philosophy of the Abhinava Bharat and was the
first Indian to hoist the national tricolour flag of India at the
Socialist Conference in Germany in 1907. She died unnoticed
in 1937 in Bombay amidst ungrateful surroundings. Senapati
Bapat was meant for Ekigineering, but, destined as he was to
engineer bridges and roads for Indian Freedom, he joined the
revolutionary camp. A peerless patriot and selfless saintly
leader, he has been a great and good name in the revolutionary
movement. Madanlal Dhingra was another Engineering
student. He was a darting arrow in the handcuffed hands of
Mother India. Many others who rose in their later life to
eminence like Dr. Rajan, Sri Shukla — ^who later became Prime
Minister of C.P. — Sri Sukhasagar Dutt, brother of Ullaskar
Dutt of Andamans fame, Sir Sikandar Hyat Khan, Khan of

Nabha and others were initiated as members of the London
branch of the Abhinava Bharat Society.

What was the condition of Indian students in Britain in pre-
Savarkarian days ? Formerly eight out of ten Indian students
prided themselves on being more English in their make-up
and mind than Englishmen themselves. So far, the dream of
Lord Macaulay seemed realized to a large extent. He had
expected the emergence of “ a class Indian in blood and colour,
but English in tastes, in opinions, in morals, and in intellect.” ’
Almost all educated Indians suffered from Anglomania. Indian
students drank merrily, danced lustily and donned richly.
They visited all quartei's freely, and were very apologetic in
their talk about things Indian. After returning to India, these
ambitious position-seekers would drum in the ears of their
cotmtrymen many faked tales and garbled facts about the
goodness and greatness of the British men and minds !

In these days India had no place in the pictures and columns
of the British Press. That is why Dadabhai Naoroji, the
Grand Old Man of India, had to purchase the shares of the
Daily News to secure a place for his say in its columns.

With the appearance of Savarkar the sun shone on the dark
deeds of British Imperialism in India, and revealed the good
side and the noble aspirations of India to Europe. Savai'kar
was a youth great in courage, great in vision, great in ideas
and great in action. The skyhigh towers and the ocean-wide
powers of the British could not dazzle, delude, or overawe him.
The mist disappeared. The towers and powers looked in their
naked perspective. The members of the Free India Society
began to think. They held weekly meetings, celebrated
anniversaries of Shivaji, Guru Govind Singh and Guru Nanak
and also the Dasara Festival. Indian students from all corners
of Britain joined the festivals heart and soul. Of course there
were some like Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru who did not join.
They were political sucklings in their swaddling clothes resting
at the breast of the West. With Savarkar’s powerful group
to defend Indian aspirations, officially sponsored meetings in
London did not go well. Strong youthful voices began to blow
away the sheep clothing of God-fearing Englishmen like Sir
Henry Cotton. Moved by the tragic vision of the downfall

1 K. B. Krishna, the Problem of Minorities, p. 138.



32


SAVARKAR AND HIS TIMES


of the Indian Empire, Sir Henry Cotton appealed to the Indian
youths to desist from their pei’ilous aim of carving out a free
Independent India.^ English people and Press felt something
stinging in their hearts. At this stage (Senapati) Bapat wrote
a brochiure demanding Home Rule for India. As a result of
this the Bombay University deprived him of the Sir Mangaldas
Nathubhai Scholarship. Upon this Savarkar pungently
commented whether that scholarship was meant for a student
who prayed for the perpetual slavery of Hindusthan ! -
In Britain May First was observed as a thanksgiving day
in honour of the British victory over the Indian revolutionaries
of 1857. In addition, now a drama was staged in London in
1907 in which Rani Laxmi and Nanasahib were depicted as
ruffians and murderers. To counteract the vilifying pro-
paganda carried through the English play Savarkar decided
to celebrate the Diamond Jubilee of the heroes of 1857. On
the 10th of May 1907, Indians in Britain held meetings, observ-
ed fasts, took vows, and paid their grateful homage to those
great martyrs of 1857 and displayed on their chests memorial
badges with pride. In trains and in streets scuffles ensued
between impudent Britishers and the patriotic Indian youths
who wore badges to commemorate the great memory of their
heroes. Mr. Hamam Singh and Mr. R. M. Khan, who wore
such badges, quitted their college protesting against the
Principal’s words of insult about the heroes of 1857. Patriotic
feelings clashed. These fearless heroic actions stirred the
hornets’ nest of the British Press. The much-admired and
adored Pandit Shyamji became notorious as a patriot Pandit ;
for the patriotism of a Hindu was a narrower phase than
Hmnanism in the eyes of the Imperialist Britishers ! Pandit
Shyamji attained a marvellous notoriety in the eyes of the
British journals and gentlemen who scathingly condemned
him for his fearless propaganda for Home Rule ! Suspicion
and alarm tightened their grip on the British mind. A little
while ago Elnglishmen had described the blessings of Brahmins
on Surendranath Banerjee as the coronation of the Emperor
Surendranath ! This shock also quickened the palpitation of
the Empire capital for a good many hours.

The debates and discussions held in the Free India Society
on the political philosophy were hi^y inspiring and of a very
high order. They echoed abo throughout India in Savarkar’s
letters from London which were read with great interest. The
members of the Abhinava Bharat were all intellectual giants.
Savarkar gave them life and light. He told them that whoso-
ever wanted to live a deathless life should die for the freedom
of his country. He impressed upon their minds that peaceful
evolution had a meaning and a sense, but peaceful revolution
had neither. He emphasized : “ In the end passive resis-
tance falls because it has no backing of the army and because
it presupposes all men to be selfless and believes that all men
will not co-operate with the aggressor." " Besides, it blindly
presumes,” he went on, “ that the aggressor has a high sense
of morality and will not resort to arms or enact new orders
and ordinances.” He illustrated how passive resistance staged
by the farm-workers of Narbonne in Southern France was
suppressed by military forces in 1907 !

In young Savtirkar’s view the sea of htunanity was progres-
sing. “The sooner the deliverance of humanity,” he pro-
claimed, “ the surer the downfall of the British Imperialism ! ”
According to him France was the God-given political labora-
tory for making experiments with all kinds of Governments,
all sorts of revolutions, and all categories of societies. “ The
French people,” he said, “ are by nature gifted with imagina-
tion and initiative and wonderful creative ability,” *

Such was the power of his thoughts and personality !
Savarkar was both magnetic and mesmeric. The India House
was completely under his spell. Sri M, P. T. Acharya,
Savarkar’s one-time colleague, describes the young leader of
the Abhinava Bharat vividly. He says : “ His personal
charm was such that a mei'e shakehand could convert men as
V. V. S. Aiyer and Hardayal — ^not only convert but even
bring out the best out of them. Sincere men always became
attached to him whether they agreed with or differed h:om
him. Not only men in ordinary walks of life but even those,
aspiring to high offices, recognised the purity of purpose in
him, although they were poles apart from him, and deadly
opponents as regards his political objectives. They even opened

S



34 SAVARKAR AND HIS TIMES

their ptirse for his propaganda. That means Savarkar had
a rare tact in dealing with men of every variety. Savarkar’s
aiisterity was itself a discipline to others, which easy-going
people hated and shimned. England was a coimtry for amuse-
ment and most people wanted to make the most out of it.” ^
Relating the story of his conversion Senapati Bapat observes :
“ Before I met Savarkar, I had planned a revolutionary
pamphleteer’s and lecturer’s life for myself. A few months
after I met him, I cancelled my plan and took up the idea of
going to Paris for learning bomb-making.” Bapat further
observes : “ One of the chief reasons was the impression that

Savarkar made on me by his brilliant writing and speaking.

‘ Here is a born revolutionary writer and speaker ; ’ I said to
myself, ‘ I may well leave writing and speaking to him and
tixrn to some other work in the revolutionary field ’.” “
Mr. Asaf Ali described nicely the serious atmosphere of the
India House of Savarkar’s days and wrote in his memoirs of
Savarkar : “ I wonder how so young a person — for he could

not have been much beyond two or three and twenty in 1909
— commanded the will of almost everyone who came into
contact with him.” Asaf Ali added that Savarkar was the
spirit of Shivaji.*


m

Another great task to which Savarkar devoted his energy
was foreign propaganda. He was the first and foremost
Indian leader who perceived and foresaw the impact of vital
forces in international politics. Years after, Subhas Bose took
up the thread where it had been left by this precmrsor and
moved international forces for the cause of Indian freedom.
To that end Savarkar wrote vigorous political articles on
Indian affairs in the Gaelic America of New York, got them
translated into German, French, Italian, Russian and
Portuguese languages and had them published in the respec-
tive countries. In this his aim was two-fold. First, he
wanted to acquaint the civilised world with Indian affairs and
enlist their moral sympathy for the cause of Indian freedom ;

REVOLUTIONARY ACTIVITIES IN EUROPE 35

and secondly, he strove to make India a living issue in inter-
national politics. It was with this aim in view that Savarkar
had deputed Madame Cama ahd Sardar Singh Rana to
represent India at the International Socialist Congress which
was held in August 1907 at Stuttgart in Germany, In spite
of the opposition from the British Socialist representative,
Mr, Ramsay MacDonald, Madame Cama, with the support of
Mr. Hyndman of England and M. Jean Jaures of France,
stood before the Conference to move the resolution on India
and unfurled tlie flag of Independence of India which was a
creation of Savarkar and his colleagues. Inspired by the call
of Independence Madame Cama addressed the Conference
fervently and said : “ This flag is of Indian Independence.

Behold it is born ! It is already sanctified by the blood of
martyred Indian youths ! I call upon you, gentlemen, to rise
and salute this flag of Indian Independence. In the name of
this flag I appeal to lovers of freedom all over the world to
co-operate with this flag in freeing one-fifth of the human
race ! ” ^ The delegates rose up and saluted the flag of Indian
Independence. They were tremendously impressed by her
speech and described Madame Cama as an Indian Princess !
How far these Herculian efforts of Savarkar and the great
endeavours of his comrades were successful can be seen when
no less a personality than the Kaiser himself clearly stated
in his famous reply to President Wilson that absolute political
Independence of India was one of the indispensable conditions
for world peace !

The Indian revolutionaries of Abhinava Bharat were also
in touch with the revolutionary forces of Russia, Ireland,
Eg 5 T>t and China. Savarkar’s aim was to oi'ganize a united
anti-British BYont with a view to rising in revolt simultane-
ously against the British Empire. One of the schemes to be
carried out by the United Front was ‘ the blocking of the Suez
Canal in the event of an armed rising in India ! Prominent
Egyptian leaders then residing in Paris had promised active
support for carrying out the scheme ’ ! - Thus every minute,
every word, every thought and every act of Savarkar breathed
some sort of plan or idea for the liberation of his Motherland

and the downfall the British Empire. Such intense
patriotism coupled with his yoimg age, his brilliant brains, his
long*range plans and the British statesmen's correct reading of
men and times were destined to invite on Savarkar unusually
long incarceration as is the fate of every pioneer liberator of
a slave coimtry !

The liberation of the Motherland was to be achieved by a
preparation for war which included (1) the teaching of
Swadeshi, Boycott and national training ; (2) purchase and
storing of weapons in neighbouring states ; (3) opening of
small factories ; (4) purchasing weapons in foreign coimtries
and smuggling them into India ; (5) adopting guerilla tactics
whenever possible, and (6) waiting for a favourable oppor-
tunity to rise in revolt. That opportimity was drawing near.
There were abundant indications that a war was imminent in
Europe; and the revolutionaries of the Abhinava Bharat
expected to take advantage of the world situation and fight
out the Britishers to win back the independence of their
Motherland. In the first issue of the Talwar, the chief organ
of Abhinava Bharat, Savarkar had fully discus.sed and
weighed the possibilities of the outbreak of a war in Europe
within four or five years while explaining the complicated
affaii's arising out of the Kiel Canal in 1908. And that golden
opportunity was not to be missed.

With that end in view Savarkar and his Abhinava Bharat
Society were busy writing, printing, packing and posting
explosives and inflaming literature. Savarkar often appeared
at the weekly meetings of Abhinava Bharat with the colour
of picric acid on his hands. Pistols were smuggled into India
through books and books through false bottoms. The
atmosphere was filled with heroic pride. The Abhinava
Bharat deputed Senapati Bapat and Hemchandra Das to study
the art of manufacturing bombs. They learnt it from a
Russian revolutionary in Paris and brought a Bomb Manual
from him. And Bapat, Hotilal Varma and Hemchandra Das
left London for India with cyclostyled copies of the Bomb
Manual.

In India persecution and prosecution, repression and sup-
pression reared their ugly heads. Brave and brilliant
editors wrote with fiery pens. Vivekananda’s brother.



REVOLUTIONARY ACTIVITIES IN EUROPE 37

Bhupendranath Dutt, editor of the Yugantar, Babu Arvind
Ghosh, editor of the Bande Mataram, Sri Prithvigir Harigir,
editor of the Harikishor, Yeotmal, and Sri Bhaskar Vishnu
Phadke of the Vihari, Bombay, were arrested and sentenced
to one or two years’ rigorous imprisonment. In the Punjab
discontent and political excitement fanned by a set of regu-
lations proposed for the new canal colonies reached a demge-
rous point. To avert the trouble, Punjab’s great leader, Lula
Lajpat Rai and the violent agitator Sardar Ajit Singh, were
deported.

The year 1907 was in a turmoil and tempo. The left wing
was forging ahead with the rise of Tilak. His titanic intellect,
formidable personality and his great gifts of leadership wield-
ed an unparalleled influence. Tilak was the first great mass
leader of modern India who enjoyed a universal popularity.
He denounced the mendicancy of the Congress method. His
doctrine spread from province to province. All forces of action
rose under his banner and ultimately the Surat Congress
broke over the Ironsides of Tilakites and the young revolu-
tionaries of Abhinava Bharat who had gathered at Surat and
held a secret meeting of some two hundred strong at the
instance of Babarao alias Ganeshpant Savarkar.

IV

The year 1908 saw many other stirring events in India. A
new spirit was rising in India. The country was at the dawn
of a new epoch. It was a time of violent repression, profound
discontent and fierce antagonism. New hopes, .new desires,
new measures and new thoughts were in the air. Love of
freedom, hatred of slavery and hope for a great future
captivated the young and the old alike. Poets and patriots
blossomed forth. Youths vied with one another in making the
purest and greatest sacrifices on the altar of freedom. Even
revellers shed their revelry and revolted. India drifted from
the policy of petition to the politics of pressure under Tilak
and from the politics of pressure to the potency of powder
under Savarkar. So tense were the feelings and so grim was
the fight that even the good-hearted and god-fearing grand old
man of India, Dadabhai Naoroji, was driven to despair and to
the thought of revolt. The fiery doctrines of boycott of foreign



38


SAVARKAR AND HIS TIMES


goods, the propagation of Swadeshi and the hatred of foreign
rule were spreading all over India. As a result of their fiery
speeches Sri Subramanya Bharati, and Chidambaram Pillay,
an initiated member of the Abhinava Bharat, were jailed.
From London Savarkar was eagerly watching these events in
Madras province.

Another important event of note was that Senapati Bapat,
Hotilal Varma and Hemchandra Das had bj^ now reached
India and circulated the cyclostyled copies of the Bomb
Manual through important centres of the revolutionaries. The
new technique made bombs really effective. And then follow-
ed the most outstanding and memorable event of the year that
■fanned the sacrificial flames of revolution, when Khudiram
Bose threw a bomb in Muzaffarpur on April 30. Two
unfortunate English ladies were killed in the act instead of the
District Magistrate, Mr. Kingsford, for whom the bomb was
intended. It shook violently the whole of Hindusthan and
resulted in the incarceration and transportation of brilliant
editors, great leaders and daring youths of Bengal and Maha-
rashtra. Khudiram’s comrade, Prafulla Chakravarti, killed him-
self w’ith his revolver ; his other comrades, Kanailal Dutt and
Satyendra Bose shot down the approver Narendra Goswami
in the hospital of the Alipore jail and died on the gallows, and
the famous Maniktola trial ended in the transportation of a
batch of valiant fighters like Babu Arvind’s brother Barindra-
nath Gbose, \311askar Dutt, Hemchandra Das, Indu Bhushan
■Roy, Dpendranath Bancrjee and many others to the Andamans.
To cope with the growing furious tide of this revolution Lord
Minto, the Viceroy of India, asked Lord Morley, the Secretary
of State for India for more repressive measures. Morley was
opposed to a policy of repression. But vain, vacillating,
touchy, subtle and a bookish liberal that he was, he ultimately
yielded. And Lord Minto promulgated new regulations,
Criminal Law Amendment Acts and blacked out all the “ Four
Freedoms ”. In Mahara.shtra, Shivrampant Paranjpe was
sentenced to 19 months’ rigorous imprisonment for his inflam-
matory article on the Muzaffarpur Bomb affair. For a similar
reason Tilak, the father of Indian unrest, was deported to
Mandalay on July 23. From his talk with Gokhale, Morley
had scented that Tilak was in close touch with Savarkar and



BEVOIiUTlONARY ACTIVITIES IN EUROPE 39

Bapat and the British Government had asked the Indian Gov-
ernment to arrange for his incarceration. For just before the
decision of the Tilak case some of the members of the
Abhinava Bharat had intercepted in Bombay one night
a message from the British Government regarding the Tilak
affair which contained the information. Sri R. N. Mandlik,
editor of the Vihari, Sri Dhondopant Phadke of the Arunoday,
Thana, Sri Balwantrao Limaye of the Swaraj, Sholapur, Sri
Achyut Balvant Kolhatkar of the Sandesh, Nagpur, Sri N. V.
Bhave of the Harikishor, Yeotmal, and the editor of the Pratod,
Satara, were also put in prison. The approver in the Alipore
case had disclosed Senapati Bapat’s connection with the
Bengali revolutionaries. Upon this Senapati Bapat eluded the
police, escaped and went into voluntary exile for years. Bengal
and Maharashtra were closely linked ! Sir Valentine Chirol
who was then travelling in India wrote to the London Times :

“ The Deccan is honeycombed with secret societies. . . . Even
in Bengal, the Bengalees did the shouting ; it was Poona that
provided the brains that directed the Bengali extremists.” ^

And the fountainhead of the revolutionary movement in
India was Savarkar, the acknowledged leader of the India
House.

The news of Tilak's arrest came as a thunderbolt to Indians
in London. The great statesman Sri Gokhale was then in
London on his fourth political visit, this time on account of the
Morley-Minto Reforms proposals then in the offing. Fearfully
or prayerfully Gokhale declined to preside over a meeting
held in London to protest against the deportation of Tilak and
the repressive measures of the Indian Government, nor did
he attend the meeting. What a contrast ! Morley rightly
wrote to Minto that Gokhale, as a party manager, was a baby
and while any politician aspiring to be a leader should never
whine, Gokhale whined like a second-rate leader ! - In the
same letter Morley appreciated Tilak’s spirit. Whereupon
Minto expressed his view that Tilak was an arch-leader of
sedition ! ® Hiuniliated at the timid and spineless attitude of
Gokhale and hurt by his blank refusal, some of the hotheads

in the revolutionary camp thought of putting an end to his
life. But Savarkar bridled them and Wtterly condemned the
very sinful thought. He voiced a timely warning that such
a mad act and attack on one of their compatriots for his own
way of thinking would imperil the power and prestige of the
revolutionary movement.^ The proposed meeting was then
held in the Caxton Hall under the chairmanship of Mr. Parekh,
and by a special resolution condemned Gokhale’s attitude
vehemently.

Immediately after Gokhale’s arrival Savarkar with his
lieutenants, Dr. Rajan and Sri V. V. S. Aiyer, had seen
Gokhale and Sri Ramesh Chandra Dutt. There was a discus-
sion on the War of 1857 between them. Gokhale had taught
history and Dutt was a historian. In the course of his talk
with them Savarkar stressed the point of writing and
interpreting the history of 1857 from the national point of
view. The historian agreed to this, but the statesman
disagreed and the discussion ended.

V

The last quarter of 1908 was the busiest period for the Free
India Society. Leaders of note and figures of fame from
India had reached London. Lala Lajpat Rai, Gokulchand
Narang, Babu Bcpin Chandra Pal, Gokhale, .Dutt, G. B.
Khaparde and R. V. Karandikar — ^the last pair for the Tilak
case appeal — ^were then in London. October 16 was observed
as Anti-Partition day, and under the chairmanship of Lala
Lajpat Rai, Khaparde, Karandikar and B. C. Pal spoke on the
occasion. On the same day in the same hall a meeting was
held to extend sympathies to the Indians in South Africa. Sir
Mancherjee Bhownagari was in the chair and Lajpat Rai,
Savarkar, Pal, Khaparde and others were the speakers. Babu
Bepin Pal captivated his audience with his powerful oratory.
His lectimes delivered later on in the Caxton Hall on the 20th
and 21st December were attended by many Englishmen.

On December 20, a National Conference was held. Dada-
sahib Khapsurde presided. Madame Cama spoke on the * Boy-
cott ’ resolution which was seconded by Sri Gyanchand

Vanna. At the same meeting Sri V. V. S. Aiyer spoke on the
resolution on Turkastan congratulating her on becoming a
Republic and was seconded by Sir Aga Khan, afterwards
H.H. the Aga Khan. The main resolution demanding ‘ Swaraj ’
was moved by Dr. Kumarsxvami and Savarkar seconded it.
Addressing the Conference Savarkar said that the true
meaning of Swaraj was absolute political independence. He
also told his audience : “ Knowing this full well, you are
voting for this resolution. Before pas.sing this resolution just
bring before your mind’s eye the dreadful pi'ison walls, and
the dreary dingy cells.” The resolution was passed
unanimously. “The Morley-Minto Reh rms,” declared the
conference by another resolution, “ are deceptive, disappoint-
ing and insulting inasmuch as they will foment communal
tension in India.” And so indeed they proved to be a great
slur on the growdh of constitutionalism in India. Minto’s
craze to outshine the efficient Curzon, his policy of counter-
poise, his fear of a Muslim revolt as threatened by Sir Syed
Ahmed, the spineless nature and want of grit in Gokhale and
Morley’s proverbial unfamiliarity with Indian affairs cul-
minated in a communal division of India holding a nascent
threat to Indian unity ! But the reforms were beyond doubt
a surrender to the revolutionary agitation in India and outside.
“ I detect,” wrote Sir Valentine Chirol from Bombay on
January 8, 1909, to the London Times, “ a very general
tendency to ascribe these lavish gifts to the vigorous actions
of the extremists. If it had not been for the bombs, we should
not have had these boons, was a remark which roughly
summed up the popular opinion in this aspect of the subject.” ^
Immediately after the conference in the decorated Caxton
Hall, the birth-day anniversary of Guru Govindsingh was
celebrated on the 29th of December 1908, when Babu Bepin
Chandra Pal presided. The function began with the song
‘ Amar Desh ’, and Savarkar’s famous song ‘ Priyakar
Hindusthan ’. Sri Gokulchand Narang read at the meeting
his essay on the Guru. Lala Lajpat Rai with his unbending
personality, sturdy patriotism, hallowed by his constructive
work and with his profound erudition poured forth his burn-
ing words. He was a very effective speaker and held a high

place among the orators of India. Babu Bepin Chandra Pal,
a sterling patriot, an orator of high rank, a well-read scholar,
a thinker and a great editor also spoke on the occasion. It
was a meeting of scholars, speakers and orators ! After these
great speeches, Savarkar was pressed by the audience to
speak, and he rose amid a deafening applause. Gifted with a
moving tongue, spotless sincerity and burning heart, he
thrilled his audience. A man of faith and conviction is
always irresistible and all-conquering. So was Savarkar with
the personality of a hero ! In the lighted, moving and inspired
atmosphere created by Savarkar even the magic speech of
India’s greatest orator, Sui-endranath Banerjee, the heartforce
and fire of Bepin Babu, the freshness and fervour of Lajpat
Rai and the polished diction of Syed Reza paled into
insignificance ! The only giant Savarkar had not crossed his
swords with, was Pherozeshah Mehta, but even with his great
power of rhetoric Mehta was no Surendranath. Describing
Savarkar as the best orator he ever heard in India or England,
Mr. Asaf Ali wrote afterwards : “ Nor is it an exaggeration to
say Savarkar is one of the few really effective speakers I have
known and heard, and there is hardly an orator of the first
rank either here or in England whom I have not had the
privilege of hearing — excepting Mr. Eardly Norton, of whom
I have heard so much that I should be almost reluctant to
avail myself of the opportunity of hearing him speak lest I
should be disappointed.” '

The fervid patriotism, love of unity and a will to sacrifice
in the Indian youths became an eyesore to the Britishers.
One man’s meat is another man’s poison ! The newspapers
cried hoarse against them. “ Crush the extremists and rally
roxmd the Moderates ” was their theme. British Press,
pensioners and patriots also grew alarmed at the daring and
disloyal attitude of the Indian youths. In the words of the
Standard, “ it is beyond question that not a few of the highly
intelligent Indians in our Universities and reading for the Bar,
are striving their utmost by such means, particularly to
accustom the minds of young rising generation to the idea of
an armed revolt ! ” ^

The London Times endorsed this view and asked the Gov-
enunent to take great care to control education and to be very
careful as to the kind of people whom it appointed to teach
the youth of India.’ A meeting was also held under the
presidency of Lord Lamington, an ex-Govemor of Bombay, to
consider and adopt means to socialize these warlike elements.
But the meeting was hotly disturbed, only B. C. Pal getting
a smooth hearing. An incident added fuel to the fire. Sri Vasu-
deo Bhattacharya, ex-editor of Sandhya and one-time editor
of Yugantar at about the same time struck Sir William Lee-
Warner a blow on the face for having called Sri Kunjavihari
Bhattacharya “ a dirty nigger ”. Sir Lce-Warner was, while
in India, a terror to the Indian Princes ; and the attack on such
a person was not an ordinary matter. Sri Vasudeo Bhatta-
charya was prosecuted and fined Rs. 20. But the attack made
India House the talk of the whole city. If anyone gave his
address as India House, the listener would at once look up
at the man and say, “ Then you belong to the revolutionary
party ! ” Artists and careerists in London took a dread and
said, “ Who will go to India these days ? There bombs may
explode anywhere and at any moment ! ”

The British Press and the people thus turned their attention
to the wonderful India House at Highgate and its leader. But
when representatives of newspapers visited it, they were
surprised to see that Savarkar whom they criticised and
opposed was merely a beardless and uptodatc youth of
twenty-five. The Standard described Savarkar as an Indian,
with youth and intelligence stamped upon him. Mr. Cambel
Green wrote in the Sunday Chronicle that Savarkar was not
only the spokesman of the students but also of Shyamji
Krishna Varma and said, “ He has a clear olive complexion,
clear deep penetrating eyes, and a width of jaw such as I have
seen in few men. His English is excellent.” He added, “ The
fact is Mr. V. D. Savarkar believes in India for the Indians
and in the complete emancipation of India from the British
Rule. He says India has nothing for what to thank the
English, unless it be the denationalization, as he calls it, of
the Hindus.” ^

44 SAVARRAR AND BIS TIMES

The Indian students talked in the Indian languages and
Scotland Yard became non-plussed. So to their succoxu* was
deputed one Mr. Kirtikar, who had worked in the Bombay
High Coxurt in the capacity of a translator, to watch the
activities of the Abhinava Bharat. This plain-clothed detec-
tive resided at the India House under the guise of a student of
Dental Surgery and every day he sent a secret report to the
C.I.D. Office. Suspicion soon fell on him. Dr. Rajan and Sri
Aiyer kept a watch over his activities. One night when he
was out, they broke into his room and found an incomplete
report awaiting dispatch to the C,I.D. On Kartikar’s return
Savarkar and Aiyer interrogated him and unmasked his veil.
Finding that his treachery was unearthed, he trembled from
head to foot at the sight of Aiyer ’s rev'olver and confe.ssed the
facts. The dental surgeon felt the loss of his teeth. However,
instead of ejecting him Savarkar shrewdly allowed him to
continue in India House to make him less troublesome. He,
however, decided that Kirtikar’s reports should go to the
C.I.D. only after his perasal !

Savarkar’s resourceful brain knew all the types and twists
of the revolutionary business. He won the sympathies of the
Irishmen serving in Scotland Yard who actually helped the
Indian revolutionaries in smuggling political literature.
Besides, the Abhinava Bharat had its secret agents in Scotland
Yard. Niranjan Pal, a comrade of Savarkar and son of the
Bengal leader, Bepin Chandra Pal, writes : “ In those days
we, too, had our secret agents in Scotland Yard. Some of
them were sent to London ostensibly as students but really to
act as spies. Two of such men ingratiated themselves with
Savarkar and secured lodgings in the India House. But such
was Savarkar’s magnetic personality that soon they came
under his spell and of their own accord, confessed everything
to him.”^ Savarkar’s sharp and penetrating eyes and the
peculiar way in which he cross-examined any visitor to the
India House exposed many an expert C.I.D. and hoodwinked
the watchdogs many a time.

But the most remarkable and rare gift of Savarkar was
his balanced mind and the power of discrimination. He was
a revolutionary realist and never dre2unt of giving and taking

life emotionally or by wasting human enei^ and life blindly.
That outstanding characteristic of Savarkar distinguished him
fron. the terrorist or a solitary reckless revolutionary. His
aim was to rise in an organised revolt at the opportime time
and liberate his country from the foreign yoke. The gift of
his marvellous presence of mind and the realist in revolutio-
nary Savarkar were seen when he checked Senapati Bapat
who offered to bomb the House of Commons. Senapati Bapat
states : “ I proposed once to attempt the life of the Secretary
of State for India, at another time, I offered to drop a bomb
in the Parliament House. On both occasions Savarkar
refused his consent and on the second occasion took great
pains to persuade me to return to India without delay for
such work as was waiting for me here. I treasured his advice
and followed it soon enough.” ' Savarkar checked the
Senapati lest their secret mastery of science would be exposed
before it reached India. Moreover, Savarkar prevented the
revolutionary movement from falling into an abyss from a
horrible precipice !


VI

The hot discussions in the India House and the fiery speeches
of Savarkar were too hot for some of the Indian leaders who
visited England in those days. Gandhi ji of South African
fame, who was proud of his being a loyal citizen of the British
Empire, was one of them. Accompanied by the South African
delegates, Gandhiji discussed political philosophy with Savar-
kar. Arguments, reason and history were against Gandhiji,
and his lieutenants supported Savarkar’s views. This left a
sting of bitterness and Gandhiji vehemently attacked the
London revolutionaries and indirectly Savarkar in a violently
non-violent booklet entitled Maro Koto Panth ! The ideological
fight between Gandhiji and Savarkar thus started during the
first decade of the twentieth century, and continued markedly
pronounced, though Savarkar was behind the bars xmdergoing
trials and stresses of life away from the political scene. Their
viewpoints, nay, their very outlook on life, were poles
asunder ! It was a fight between the conscious Gautam and the

SAVARKAR AND HIS TIMES


spirited Shivaji. Gandhiji arrogated the religion of God to
himself and imputed irreligion of the devil to the revolution^
aries and to those leaders who opposed him. Savarkar repre-
sented the revolting force of a subject people. That force was
the outcome of historic and human laws. This he had made
amply clear in the opening issue of the Talwar, the chief organ
of revolutionaries published from Pai-is in 1909. The passage
quoted below will conspicuously cast a flood of light on
Savarkar’s mental make-up and his human stand and prove
his rational outlook. It states : “ We feel no special love for
secret organisations or surprise and secret warfare. We hold
that whenever the open preaching and practising of truth is
banned by enthroned violence, then alone secret societies and
secret warfare are justified as the inevitable and indispensable
means to combat violence by force.’’ Savarkar further says :
“ Whenever the natural process of national and political evo-
lution is violently suppressed by the forces of wrong, then
revolution must step in as a natural reaction and therefore
ought to be welcomed as the only effective instrument to re-
enthrone Truth and Right.” He then brilliantly sums up :

“ You rule by bayonets and under these circumstances it is a
mockery to talk of constitutional agitation when no constitu-
tion exists at all. But it would be worse than a mockery, even
a crime, to talk of revolution when there is a constitution that
allows the fullest and freest development of a nation. Only
because you deny us a gun, we pick up a pistol. Only because
you deny us light, we gather in darkness to compass means
to knock out the fetters that hold our Mother down.” *

This great, grand and concise doctrine of the revolutionary
philosophy of Savarkar would shine out amongst the
doctrines of world-famous revolutionary philosophers. Presi-
dent Thomas Masaryk, one of the eminent thinkers and men
of action of the modern world, supports this stand when he
says : “ Revolution is a moral act when it is the only means
left for the defence of liberty and justice.”- And Masaryk
was a leader who had worked out and experienced what a
revolution was like ! Savarkar philosophized his doctrines
when he was only six and twenty. If this is not rational

t hinking , if this is not revolutionary realism and historical
truth, what else is it ? A Shivaji is born with a love for
justice, loyalty to truth, and obedience to God. He is a foe
to tyranny and terror to aggression, for he believes with
Franklin in the eternal truth that rebellion against tyrants is
obedience to God.

Despite these differences Gandhi ji presided over the Dasara
Sammelan in London in 1909 which Savarkar was to address.
Gandhiji said he was very proud to have the honour of sitting
by the side of Savarkar. He expressed the hope that India
would reap the fruits of Savarkar’s sacrifice and patriotism.
Mr. Asaf Ali tells us that while formally introducing Savarkar
that evening to the audience Gandhiji said, “ But Mr. Savar-
kar, the speaker of the evening, is to follow me and I should
not like to stand between you and him,” and Asaf Ali has des-
cribed Savarkar’s speech on the day as one of the finest
speeches he ever listened to ! ' In this speech Savarkar
impressed upon his audience that without Sri Ramachandra
life in India would be nothing. He asked them to remember
that Rama established Ram Raj after slaying Ravan, the
symbol of tyraimy, aggression and injustice, and added that
Hindus were the heart of Hindusthan.

The most singular and consistent note that prevails from
that time till this day in Savarkar is that he was proud of his
race and heritage. An incident of that period also underlines
this fact. One day an English lady, residing in a hotel, asked
Savarkar if he went to church on Sundays. He said, “ No ! ”
The lady paused for a moment and asked him whether he and
his friends were Hindus. Savarkar proudly replied that he
was a Hindu. One of his colleagues protested that Sav'arkar’s
assertion was too direct and would offend the English lady’s
ear. Thereupon Savarkar retorted : “ Then change your
father’s name if you are cowardly ashamed of it. But you
may as well tell the lady that her being English offends my
ear too.” - Savarkar, however, never hated any Englishman
because he was an Englishman.

In the meanwhile Minto was striving to crush the forces
of seditious agitation in India with his new measures.

4ft SAVABKAHANOHISTIMSS

Repression was raging all round. But the revolutionary move-
ment was still spreading and its morning shadow appeared to
the Government longer than what it was. Soon one

branch of Abhinava Bharat was unearthed at Gwalior, another
at Satara and a few small factories of bombs and secret stores
were unearthed in Maharashtra after the arrest of Savarkar’s
elder brother Babarao. Babarao himself was sentenced to
transportation for life on June 8, 1909. on a charge of having
waged a war against the King-Eniperor by publisliing a book-
let of inspiring poems ! One of these poems asked the people.
‘'Pray tell, whoever got political freedom without a war?”
In the absence of his leader brother, Bahai'au led in Maha-
rashtra the then ‘ Quit India ’ movement backed by bombs
and pistols. So hearing the shocking news of the confirmation
of Babarao's transportation for life by the Bombay High Court
in November 1909, Savarkar wrote from London a letter in
poetical lines to his sister-in-law, Babarao’s wife, consoling
her in her great sorrow at the severe blow. The letter written
in verse has since then been a charm for Maharashtrian
womanhood. Savarkar wrote —

“ . . . Even so this our Motherland, our Mother, craving
for the assistance of the Lord that she too be rescued
from the crocodile clutches of Bondage, enters om:
Garden, plucks a fresh flower from the bough and offers
it at His feet in worship. . . .”

“ Behold, O Sister, on one side stands watching the
Past — souls of sages, saints aind heroes of our race gone
before and on the other the Future — generations yet
unborn.” ^

“ Deathless is the family that falls to a man,

For the emancipation of its Motherland,

Filling the skies with the fragrance of their sacrifice,
Made in the welfare of man’s rise.” *

Mark the great simile, noble interpretation of life ! The
feelings are real, experienced and not adopted. He is truly a
Great Man whose heart soars high, whose courage remains
supreme and who can composedly dissolve himself into the
Universal self or feels oneness with Him even when his ‘ self ’
is surroimded by flames !
