## XXXVIII

*To Mrs. G. W. Hale*

C/O MRS. OLE BULL  
168 BRATTLE STREET  
CAMBRIDGE, MASS.

*5 October 1894*

DEAR MOTHER,

I have not heard from you for long. Have you received the huge packages
I sent over to you? Have you heard anything about the phonograph from
the express office?

I will be with Mrs. Ole Bull a few days, and then I go to New York to
Mrs. Guernsey's.

Yours ever affectionately,  
VIVEKANANDA
