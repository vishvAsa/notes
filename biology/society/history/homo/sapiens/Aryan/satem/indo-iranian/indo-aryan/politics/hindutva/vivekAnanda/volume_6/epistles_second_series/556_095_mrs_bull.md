INDIANA AVE., CHICAGO, ILL.,  
*6th April, 1896*.

DEAR MRS. BULL,

Your kind note was duly received. I had beautiful visits with my friends
and have already held several classes. I shall have a few more and then
start on Thursday.

Everything has been well arranged here, thanks to the kindness of Miss
Adams. She is so, so good and kind.

I am suffering from slight fever the last two days; so I can't write a
long letter.

My love to all in Boston. 

Yours with kind regards,

VIVEKANANDA.
