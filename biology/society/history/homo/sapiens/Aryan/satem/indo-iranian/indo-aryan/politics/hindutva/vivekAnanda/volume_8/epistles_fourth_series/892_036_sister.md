*To Miss Mary Hale*

CAMBRIDGE,  
*December, 1894*.

DEAR SISTER,

I received your letter just now. If it is not against the rules of your
society, why do you not come to see Mrs. Ole Bull, Miss Farmer, and Mrs.
Adams the physical culturist from Chicago?

Any day you will find them there.

Yours ever affectionately,

VIVEKANANDA.
