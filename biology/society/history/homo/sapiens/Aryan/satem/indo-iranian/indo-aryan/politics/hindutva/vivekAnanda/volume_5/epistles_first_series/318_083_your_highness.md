## LXXXIII

ALMORA,  
*9th June, 1898*.

YOUR HIGHNESS, (Maharaja of Khetri.)

Very sorry to learn that you are not in perfect health. Sure you will be
in a few days.

I am starting for Kashmir on Saturday next. I have your letter of
introduction to the Resident, but better still if you kindly drop a line
to the Resident telling him that you have already given an introduction
to me.

Will you kindly ask Jagamohan to write to the Dewan of Kishangarh
reminding him of his promise to supply me with copies of Nimbārka
Bhāshya on the *Vyāsa-Sutras* and other Bhashyas (commentaries) through
his Pandits.

With all love and blessings,

Yours,

VIVEKANANDA.

PS. Poor Goodwin is dead. Jagamohan knows him well. I want a couple of
tiger skins, if I can, to be sent to the Math as present to two European
friends. These seem to be most gratifying presents to Westerners.
