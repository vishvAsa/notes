## XXXVIII

*To Miss Isabelle McKindley*

528, 5TH AVE., NEW YORK,  
*24th Jan., 1895*.

DEAR MISS BELL,

I hope you are well. . . .

My last lecture was not very much appreciated by the *men* but awfully
so by *vemen*. You know this Brooklyn is the centre of anti-women's
rights movements; and when I told them that women deserve and are fit
for everything, they did not like it of course. Never mind, the women
were in ecstasies.

I have got again a little cold. I am going to the Guernseys. I have got
a room downtown also where I will go several hours to hold my classes
etc. Mother Church must be all right by this time, and you are all
enjoying this nice weather. Give Mrs. Adams mountain high love and
regard from me when you see her next.

Send my letters as usual to the Guernseys.

With love for all,

Ever your aff. bro.,  
VIVEKANANDA.
