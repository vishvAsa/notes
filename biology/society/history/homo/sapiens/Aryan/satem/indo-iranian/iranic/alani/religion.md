- 3. a "re-Paganization" during the fourteenth and fifteenth century following the Mongol invasions and the disruption of the contacts with the Byzantines; 
- 4. a partial re-Christianisation during the sixteenth and seventeenth century conducted by Georgian missionaries; 
- 5. a further re-Christianisation conducted by Russian missionaries beginning in the late eighteenth century; 
- 6. enforced state atheism during the Soviet Union from 1921 to 1991; and
