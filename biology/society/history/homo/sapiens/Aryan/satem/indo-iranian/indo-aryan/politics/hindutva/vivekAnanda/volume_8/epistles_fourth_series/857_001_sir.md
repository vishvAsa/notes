BAGHBAZAR,  
CALCUTTA,  
*28th November, 1888*.

DEAR SIR, (Shri Pramadadas Mitra)

I have received the book of Pānini which you so kindly sent me. Please
accept my gratitude for the same.

I had an attack of fever again — hence I could not reply to you
immediately. Please excuse. I am ailing much. I am praying to the Divine
Mother to keep you happy physically and mentally.

Your servant,  
VIVEKANANDA.
