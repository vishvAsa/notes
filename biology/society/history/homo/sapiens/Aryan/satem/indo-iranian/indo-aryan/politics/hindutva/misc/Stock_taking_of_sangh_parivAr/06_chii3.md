At the very outset I would like to say that the eight formulations
popularised by Sangh Parivar in recent years as stated, is not the whole
fact. There may be even some more such formulations put forth by
individuals as social hypothesis yet to be put to tests before being
accepted as useful practices. The most that can be said is that the
Sangh Parivar may also be in a mood to carry out some such tests.

As for the second document which deals with ‘Sarva Panth Samãdar Manch’,
I do not find any mention of EQUAL in it, as alleged. The honour is to
be extended to ‘all ways of worship’ and nothing more (i.e. not ghetto
mentality and hatred to all others etc.). I would request **Voice of
India** to deal with this sensitive issue cautiously in the National
interest (not secular, of course) and refer to the real intent of such
moves of Sangh Parivar or some individuals as the case may be.

I share the two comments of Voice of India except the words ‘Muslims
have become as aggressive and intransigent as during pre-partition
period’ (it should be ‘They have since become more aggressive’ etc.) and
‘Now leaders of Sangh Parvar look like following the same path’. I feel
they have yet not decided to commit suicide.

My feelings on the two documents are attached.  
 

**FIRST DOCUMENT**

Dr. Shreerang Godbole’s anxiety and his comments offered at Pune Seminar
as well as his letter to Sri K.S. Sudarshan are an alarm to all Hindus
to seriously ponder over the issues in question. And I think they will.
Hindus are thankful to him for the alarm.

> 1\. The rejection of efforts of Quraiysh by Mohammad and the
> destruction of idols and pictures in Kaba by him is not enough to
> force Hindus to leave their own liberal and comprehensive Hindu view
> of life. We have to keep in mind that certain Arya Samajees are wildly
> critical to idol-worship and Sanatan Dharma itself. If someone is
> narrow and not co-operative, we will have to do something to let him
> become a sharer of humanity in general because ultimately true
> humanism is Hinduism.
>
> 2\. ‘All *religions* lead to God’ is in fact a wrong saying. Religion
> is one like God is one. The paths leading to God may be several. They
> definitely are not equal from all the angles. Some of these may even
> be misleading. We should try to block and renounce such routes but
> with a Caution. Any Hurried action may cause, not only a confusion but
> may harm us in another way. Here again the word EQUAL has been
> stressed upon by Dr. Godbole which is not there in the basic
> reference.
>
> 3\. ‘Islam is good Muslims are bad.’ In my opinion we should not waste
> time on this particular point. Muslims are not going to renounce Islam
> specially when Hindus or Dr. Godbole say that.
>
> 4\. ‘The Muslims, if told of their common ancestry, will unite with
> Hindus’ is not necessary but there is no harm to tell them so. One
> would not be wrong if he tries to find out a possibility of a change
> in them. We can accept such harmless trial and error efforts.
>
> 5\. Congress used Muslims or Muslims used Congress: Why aim at two
> extremes only? I feel the Congress and Muslims did not follow one way
> traffic. Their interests especially since 1947 were mutual. Now the
> Muslims have become well-practised in political manoeuvring. And thus
> today at least the point that Dr. Godbole has put forth has a
> considerable weight. Their basic anti-Hindu view has emerged as
> anti-BJP stand in Indian politics. In such a situation, no part of
> Indian population (not even infiltrators) can be deprived of their

> turn their direction towards the national fold by softer means seems
> imperative; we cannot stop the ball from bouncing if struck too hard

> 6\. Discussion of Sufis has little to do in dealing with the Muslim
> Problem.

> 7\. Having better knowledge of their so-called holy books, Muslim

> slowly.
>
> 8\. ‘Namaz offered on a disputed site is not acceptable to Allah.’
> While we can neither confirm nor deny this, even if there are any such
> instructions anywhere, Muslims would not follow them. They follow only
> what is of advantage to them as Muslims and not as human beings.

  
**SECOND DOCUMENT**

‘There are encouraging signs that the foundations of Islam are showing
cracks… many Muslims have begun to question the basic premises of Islam.
Islam as an ideology is bound to become a museum piece’, is just an
over-optimistic expression of Dr. Godbole.

Dr. Godbole is however closest to fact in saying that ‘the Quran, Hadis,
Sunnah all cultivate an exclusivist, separatist, imperialist political
mind-set of its adherents’. But similarity with Islam of other groups
like Marxism etc., does not have a similar bearing on Hindus for
diversified reasons. Had such other groups been a problem to Hindus just
as Muslims are, Hindus would not have neglected them. It is unuseful to
engage one-self on different issues just in a geometrical manner, which
are not face to face today or ever in the close future.

No doubt the Muslims of India are the greatest victims of Islam and
better they are weaned from the Islamic ideology, but they have since
definitely turned as oppressors of non-Muslims. None can aim at Muslims
without getting in touch with them. None can preach a ‘Sarva Panth
Chikitsã’ (including the Muslims) because they are not going to listen
to such preachings.

I am not interested in scanning the literal meanings of SARVA PANTH
SAMBHÃV or SAMÃDAR but some platform seems necessary where adherent of
all Panths should have an opportunity to discuss the values of their
respective Panths, compare with one another, add or delete, accept or
renounce the one that was adhered to in ignorance so far.

I would like to explain my position with regard to the word ‘SAMÃDAR’.
This word is SAM+ÃDAR which means just ÃDAR in a more sophisticated
form. It stands for ‘a reasonable respect’ and not for EQUAL respect. It
is widely used in Sanskrit and Hindi for reasonable respect. Dr. Godbole
has not interpreted the word correctly.

In the footnote regarding, ‘Parãvartana’, Dr. Godbole has again used the
word EQUAL which is just disturbing. This word remaining there, Hindus
will be, I am sure, in full agreement with Dr. Godbole on the futility
of ‘Parãvartana’.
