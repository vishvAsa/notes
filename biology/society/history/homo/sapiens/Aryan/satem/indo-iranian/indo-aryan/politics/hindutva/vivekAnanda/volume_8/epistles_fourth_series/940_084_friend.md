## LXXXIV

*To Mr. E. T. Sturdy*

KIEL,  
*10th September, 1896*.

DEAR FRIEND,

I have at last seen Prof. Deussen. . . . The whole of yesterday was
spent very nicely with the Professor, sight-seeing and discussing about
the Vedanta.

He is what I should call "a warring Advaitist". No compromise with
anything else. "Ishwara" is his bug-bear. He would have none of it if he
could. He is very much delighted with the idea of your magazine and
wants to confer with you on these subjects in London, where he is
shortly going. . . .
