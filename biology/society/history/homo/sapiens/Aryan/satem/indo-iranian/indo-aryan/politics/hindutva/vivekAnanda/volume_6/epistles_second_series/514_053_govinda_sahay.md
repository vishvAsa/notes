DEAR GOVINDA SAHAY,

. . . Honesty is the best policy, and a virtuous man must gain in the
end. . . . You must always bear in mind, my son, that however busy or
however distant, or living with men however high in position I may be, I
am always praying, blessing, and remembering everyone of my friends,
even the humblest. 

Yours, with blessings,

VIVEKANANDA.
