*To Miss Josephine MacLeod*

SRINAGAR, KASHMIR,  
*30th September, 1897*.

MY DEAR MISS MACLEOD,

Come soon if you intend to come really. From November to the middle of
February India is cool; after that it is hot. You will be able to see
all you want within that time, but to see all takes years.

I am in a hurry; therefore excuse this hasty card. Kindly tender my love
to Mrs. Bull and my good wishes and earnest thoughts for Goodwin's
speedy recovery. My love to Mother, to Alberta, to the baby, to
Holister, and last, not the least, to Franky. 

Yours in the Lord,

VIVEKANANDA.
