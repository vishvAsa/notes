1453: Raja of Khelna (vishAlgaD), Shankar Rao Shirke made a diplomatic play,by surrendering to Malik-ut-Tujjar on the condition that he invade his supposed-rival at Sangmeshwar. Malik-ut-Tujjar tried converting him to Islam forcibly, but the Raja refused, unless his condition was fulfiled. Due to the Raja's gloomy description to the Bahmani general of the dense Konkan jungles on the path to Sangmeshwar, many soldiers deserted the Bahmani army! Still the Raja gave him enough assurance to carry on the campaign to Sangmeshwar. On the other hand, Raja Shankar Rao Shirke, also sent secret word to Raja of Sangmeshwar regarding the Bahmani army movement. Raja of Sangmeshwar deployed 30000 infantry, lancers & artillery. The army was adept in mountain warfare which was to ensue. On the 3rd day of marching to Sangmeshwar, the Bahmani general took ill due to dysentry & the army camped in the remote valley amidst tall mountains. At the night-time, the army of Raja of Sangmeshwar fell upon the Bahmanis. Bahmani army was surrounded. The general, Malik-ut-Tujjar was put to death. More than 7000 Bahmanis were killed, including 500 Syeds from Medina, Karbala & Najaf. The remaining army fled towards Chakan.
