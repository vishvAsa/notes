> At the dawn of the twenty-first century, Christianity is still a force to contend with in Greece. The church is an occupying and colonial and colonizing force. The church in Greece is the highest of all conceivable corruption. It stole the identity of the Greeks and continues to muddle their minds with anti-Hellenic thoughts. The church is also the wealthiest institution of the country. It has made religion into an extraordinary profitable business.... 
> 
> What Christians did to the Hellenes and their culture.... is a closed and secret page of Greek history in Greece.... Most Greeks don't know that their church collaborated with the Turks to keep them slaves for 400 years. Adamantios Koraes was straightforward. Writing anonymously in 1806, he said the priests and monks and bishops were primarily responsible for the Turkish occupation of Greece.... The country is a Palimpsest. Barbarians are writing over the scraped history and culture of Hellas.... Greek children and students sing the praises of Christian saints, some of them with abominable records of anti-Hellenism, but barely know the poetry, or even the names of, Homeros, Hesiodos, Aischylos, Sophocles.... (pp. 171-172  Vallianotos the Greek)

### Nietzsche
> The two opposing values ‘good and bad’, ‘good and evil’ have fought a terrible battle for thousands of years on earth; and  although the latter has been dominant for a long time, there is still no lack of places where the battle remains undecided. ...  
>
> So the Romans were the strong and noble, stronger and nobler than anybody hitherto who had lived or been dreamt of on earth; their every relic and inscription brings delight, provided one can guess what it is that is doing the writing there. By contrast, the Jews were a priestly nation of ressentiment par excellence, possessing an unparalleled genius for popular morality: compare peoples with similar talents, such as the Chinese or the Germans, with the Jews, and you will realize who are first rate and who are fifth. Which of them has prevailed for the time being, Rome or Judea? But there is no trace of doubt: just consider to whom you bow down in Rome itself, today, as though to the embodiment of the highest values – and not just in Rome, but over nearly half the earth \[[N1](https://archive.org/stream/GeneologyofMorals#page/n71/mode/2up)\]
