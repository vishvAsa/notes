As a retainer of the Nabeshima clan, one should
have the intention of studying our province’s history and traditions, but provincial studies are made
light of nowadays. The basic reason for this study
is to understand the foundation of our clan, and to know that
the clan’s forefathers established its perpetuity by means of their
suffering and compassion. The fact that our clan has perpetually continued in an unrivaled manner up to this very day is due
to the humanity and martial valor of Master Ryuzoji Iekane,
the charity and faith of Master Nabeshima Kiyohisa, and the
appearance of Lord Ryuzoji Takanobu and Lord Nabeshima
Naoshige and their might.
I am at a complete loss when it comes to understanding
why people of this generation have forgotten these things and
respect the Buddhas of other places. Neither the Shakyamuni
Buddha, nor Confucius, nor Kusunoki, nor Shingen were ever
retainers of the Ryuzojis or the Nabeshimas; hence it cannot
be said that they are in harmony with our clan’s customs. In
times of war or in times of peace it would be sufficient if both
the upper and lower classes would worship our ancestors and
study their teachings. One worships the head of whatever clan
or discipline to which he belongs. Outside learning for retainers
of our clan is worthless. One may think that it is fine to study
other disciplines as a diversion after his provincial studies are
replete. Yet if a person has a good understanding of provincial
studies, he will see that there is nothing lacking in them.
Today, if someone from another clan were to ask about the
origin of the Ryuzojis and the Nabeshimas, or why the fief was
transferred from the former to the latter, or if they were to
ask something like, “I have heard that the Ryuzojis and the
Nabeshimas are the greatest in Kyushu for deeds of martial
valor, but can you tell me some of the particulars?” I suppose
that the man with no knowledge of provincial studies would not
be able to answer a word.
For a retainer there should be nothing other than doing his
own job. For the most part people dislike their own jobs, find
those of others more interesting, cause misunderstanding, and
bring on utter disasters. Good models of men who performed
their duty in their work are Lord Naoshige and Lord Katsushige.
The retainers of those times all performed their duties. From
the upper classes, men who would be of good use were searched
out, while from the lower classes men desired to be useful. The
minds of the two classes were of mutual accord , and the strength
of the clan was secure.
In all our generations of masters there has never been a bad
or foolish one, and in the end there has never been one who
ranked second or third among the daimyo of Japan. It is truly a
wonderful clan; this is due to the faith of its founders. Moreover,
they did not send the clan’s retainers to other provinces. nor did
they invite men from other provinces in. Men who were made
ronin were kept within the province, as were the descendants of
those who were made to commit seppuku. The wonder of being
born into a clan with such a deep pledge between master and
servant is an inexpressible blessing, passed down through the
apes, for both farmer and townsman. This goes without saying
for the retainer.
The foundation of a Nabeshima samurai should be in knowing this fact; in being deeply resolved to return this blessing by
being useful; in serving more and more selflessly when treated
kindly by the master ; in knowing that being made a ronin or
being ordered to commit seppuku are also forms of service ;
and in aiming to be mindful of the clan forever, whether one
is banished deep in the mountains or buried under the earth.
Although it is unfitting for someone like me to say this, in dying it is my hope not to become a Buddha. Rather, my will
is permeated with the resolution to help manage the affairs of
the province, though I be reborn as a Nabeshima samurai seven
times. One needs neither vitality nor talent. In a word, it is a
matter of having the will to shoulder the clan by oneself.
How can one human being be inferior to another? In all
matters of discipline, one will be useless unless he has great
pride. Unless one is determined to move the clan by himself, all
his discipline will come to naught. Although, like a tea kettle, it
is easy for one’s enthusiasm to cool, there is a way to keep this
from happening. My own vows are the following:

- Never to be outdone in the Way of the Samurai.
- To be of good use to the master.
- To be filial to my parents.
- To manifest great compassion, and to act for the sake of
Man.

If one dedicates these four vows to the gods and Buddhas
every morning, he will have the strength of two men and will
never slip backward. One must edge forward like the inchworrn,
bit by bit. The gods and Buddhas, too, first started with a vow.
