## Economy
" Trade is not just a game. Over the long sweep of history some nations lose independence and control of their destiny if they fall behind in trade. Therefore nations must think about it strategically, not just as a matter of where they can buy the cheapest shirt this week."

## Hindu vs west conflict 
- "The lessons learned by other nations show what lies ahead. You have the rudhira-varṇa-s of mahākrauñcadvīpa whose numerous tribes were overpowered and exterminated by the mleccha-s."
- "Then there are the kṛṣṇa-s of sthūladvīpa whom they along with the marūnmatta-s reduced to being slaves. They have been excluded from civilization and left with merely the preta/rākṣasa-pustaka in their hand."
- "Among the pītavarṇa-s, the cīna-s and the ati-prācya-s fought the mleccha-s but were defeated. Yet, by paying an enormous price they either expanded their territorial integrity (the cīna-s) or at least kept the śava-mata limited in their lands (the bindudhvaja-s)."
- "These illustrate to you the options that are available for bhārata-s – either you make an exit without even realizing you are out, or you prepare for a conflict where your costs will be enormous. Else a puerile existence will indeed be the nation’s lot like that of the cīna-bhṛtya-s at the edge of the mahādvīpa. Of the dasyu-s, the mleccha-s do not even need to attack directly anymore – by using the marūnmatta-s and their plants, the śavārādhaka-s, they can sink the Hindus if they continue the way they are. The cīna-s will joyfully grab up the rest even as the Hindus are claiming that they had civilizationally subjugated them from the time of Taizong."" - \[[MT14](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2014/09/14/the-fifth-story/)\]
