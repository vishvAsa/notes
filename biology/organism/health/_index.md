## लक्षणानि
बलाधिष्ठानम् आरोग्यं  
यदर्थोऽयं क्रियाक्रमः।(चरकः)

- "Health is the most important asset you have - but it's an invisible asset, only becoming apparent when you start losing it. ... Good health is the functioning of all systems; ill health only needs one thing to go wrong - hence our lives are inevitably 'doomed to failure'. .. Of course it is good to retain strength and muscle mass in older age." (Anna Karenina principle.)
- "Realise that the condition of youth is the prime expression of health - Do things to recreate youth. It isn't a single metric - Don't mistake one marker of health for a decisive marker against disease." See aging page to grok what youth entails.

## प्रभावः
Having negative health conditions diminishes our enjoyment of life, and makes us fragile to environmental and manmade stressors and unexpected events.

## मार्गः
- Do things to recreate youth. Even the "vigorous hunter mode".
- "Adopt systemic 'self-preservation' methods – calorie restriction, fasting, (don't constantly eat), daily activity, robust challenges, resistance training". 
- "Ditch ultra-processed foods, sugars, +++(most)+++ seed oils and refined carbohydrates" 
- "Use the advances of modernity to protect you from acute harm, accidents and disease" 

## Lifestyle and environment
- "People talk about key or 'master conditions' s.a. insulin resistance, obesity or inflammation from which ill-health springs, but those upstream conditions are downstream effects of lifestyle and environment."
- "Modern trauma healthcare is miraculous in saving us from certain death from catastrophic accidents, but can't resolve the diseases of civilization tsunami; meaning that millions of people live for years, sick but not dead. .. It's good that healthcare keeps us alive, but it's not good we are chronically sick."

### Good environment
- "As a biological organism the human body is adaptive; more than that, it is antifragile, this is an important distinction in that things that are antifragile need stress to improve. So, the health and ‘fitness’ of the body is demand led – the demand comes from our environment."

## Naturalness
"Despite what we've been told by people seduced by modern diet and medicine, good health is our natural state - we don't need to be saved from our natural state: we have a predisposition for health, not illness." 


THE BEST PREDICTOR OF YOUR FUTURE HEALTH IS YOUR CURRENT HEALTH.
Out of interest, I asked a friend if, our health status today has a bearing on our health status tomorrow', is a Markov or Martingale process. He replied, "Martingale. Markov just means that whatever happens next only depends on what happens now
