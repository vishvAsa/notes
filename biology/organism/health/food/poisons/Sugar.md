One must avoid rapid rises and fall in sugar levels in most
circumstances - except after exercise, when it is used up by muscles.
Reasons: According to
[link](http://nutritiondiva.quickanddirtytips.com/how-sugar-affects-your-body.aspx):
suppression of immune system and growth hormone secretion, promotion of
inflammation, glycation, and insulin-resistence (by promoting fat livers
even in lean people according to
[link](http://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/17/magazine/mag-17Sugar-t.html?_r=1)
).

Further complications include: higher blood pressure, higher trglyceride
levels, lower HDL cholesterol levels, higher LDL cholesterol levels (aka
metabolic syndrome), thence leading to both type 2 diabetes and heart
disease (surprise\!).

There are also observations leading to speculation about its role in the
increased incidence of cancer with western diet/ lifestyle: insulin
promotes tumor growth\!
