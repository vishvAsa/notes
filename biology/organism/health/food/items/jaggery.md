## Adultration
Problem is that jaggery blocks are oft adultrated.  

Fake Organic claims: 

> I do get bits of plastic now and then with powdered jaggery. But if you dilute the block jaggery, you will find particles for sure. I buy organic branded products from Amazon. But yes, most of them are namesake organic, we donâ€™t have any chance to check if they are authentic /genuine. -SN, Bengaluru, 2021
