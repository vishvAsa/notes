## Importance
It might also help more rapid detection because these mycosis are super-destructive. Hence, it is important the molecular biologists develop & standardize the primers for detecting these.

## Mucor
Mucors are more basal fungi (i.e. outside of the "crown fungi" composed of ascomycetes, e.g. the alcohol yeast & basidiomycetes, e.g. mushrooms). They are commonly seen as molds on decaying food and their spores are abundant in any place with a little decay, especially in desh. We inhale their spores all the time but normal humans are quite resistant to it. 

### Epidemiology
#### Warm bloodedness
> It appears that cold blooded animals are way more susceptible to fungal infections. Warm blooded animals like mammals and dinosaurs are less so. One of the selective advantages that might have led to the fixation of warm bloodedness is probably a high degree of natural resistance to systemic mycosis.  My own investigations suggest that cold-blooded animals might have a special defense against such fungal pathogens that we have lost as endothermy takes care. Thus, we see frogs being decimated by systemic fungal infection but rare to see mammalian (except probably bats) or bird species being similar attacked. ... So there has to be a special condition for systemic mycosis & probably the diabetes prevalence in desh is the big factor in this.

#### Comorbidities
> cases of mucor infections being reported in the current wave in the desh. In America I have seen reports of it arising from infections of injuries in war or during hurricanes but didn't read of it as sequel of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

##### Diabetes
- majority of cases arise in patients with diabetes with high ketone concentration in blood.
    - "This could explain the high incidence in the current COVID wave due to the high incidence of diabetes in India which might be exacerbated by the steroid treatment & perhaps pushing some to ketoacidosis." - MT


> while it might not immediately affect treatment it would be good for them to keep an eye on: 1) what are the prevalent species in this wave? 2) Are ascomycetes also involved like aspergillosis?

### Symptoms
- Mucormycosis( Black fungus)
- Facial pain.
  - pain in eye, loss of vision.
- Headache.
- Black lesions on upper inside of mouth.

### Treatment
- The cost of one vial of Ambisome( Amphotericin ðŸ˜Ž used to be INR 4000.
  
### Cost during COVID
- But during COVID time 202105, as the demand has gone up,the cost of a 50mg vial has been increased to INR 7400.
  - An average 70Kg person requires 7 vials per day.It makes INR 50,000 per day.
- A minimum of 10 days have to be administered. So the cost of the drug itself turns out to be INR 5  lakhs.
- Plus the continuation phase requires oral antifungal drugs which are again expensive.


## Detection 
> Is there a difference in pathology between the different species? This might be important for prevention especially if some species tend to be more common 1 could keep an eye on the common sources of decaying matter where they are growing in the vicinity of healthcare settings. 
> 
> The most widely reported mucors include: Mucor, Rhizopus, Lichtheimia Cunninghamella, Rhizomucor, Apophysomyces & Phycomyces. Primers for these could be easily developed. In addition to the ascomycosis by Aspergillus, physicians would also want to keep an eye to see if Basidiobolus or Conidiobolus might be active. Further, their response to different antifungals should also be carefully monitored. Wonder if small molecules or odor tests could also allow a detection like Basidiobolus having that geosmin smell. But if it has come to that it might be too advanced.
