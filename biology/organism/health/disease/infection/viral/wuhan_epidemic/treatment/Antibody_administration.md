## Monoclonal antibodies
-  One antibody comes from a human who had recovered from a SARS-CoV-2 infection; a B cell that makes the antibody was harvested from the personâ€™s blood and the genes for the immune protein isolated and copied.
- The other antibody is from a mouse, which was engineered to have a human immune system, that had the spike protein injected into it.
- Experiments in both golden hamsters and rhesus macaque monkeys that intentionally were infected with SARS-CoV-2 showed that the cocktail could reduce viral levels and disease pathology.
- These monoclonal antibodies cocktails are very expensive,one pack that can treat one patient is being sold close to Rs 60,000.


### Regeronone
- combination of Casirivimab and imdevimab in India.
- It is recommended only in mild to moderate cases, it has to be administered within 48-72 hours to any newly infected patient according to the manufacturers. given to those patients who hadn't formed the antibodies.

### Bamlanivimab
#### Efficacy vs B 1.617.2
- Serum from those infected upto 12 months post symptoms and serum from Pfizer vaccines showed 3 to 6 fold reduced potency against this mutant.This comparison of 3 to 6 fold is in reference with B 117 aka the variant from the UK.



### Convalescent plasma therapy
- **Before** the patient's immunity kicks in, the idea is to supplement it with antibodies from another person. So - narrow window of time where it is useful.
- You need to give very early, within 3 to 7 days of onset of symptoms and that too the donor should have high levels of antibodies to have any beneficial effects.
- Might have resulted in escape and evolution of variants in an immunocompromised patient.

#### Hype
- Donald Trump underwent this. He received was 8gm of monoclonal antibodies (Rogenerone) - very expensive right now.
- Details [here](https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/convalescent-plasma-therapy/about/pac-20486440). Plasma from a person who has recently recovered from the disease (within 28 days) is given to the patient.

## Other peptides
- Fucoidans in seaweed act as a decoy. "Recent research by Rensellear Polytechnic Institute and Prof Kou Hayakawa of Japan confirm this. Seaweed based spirulina chikki (cftri chikki made by aquaseal technologies) was administered to the first batch of covid-19 patients at Mysore with astounding success."

### Nanobodies
nanobodies, based on a kind of antibody naturally produced by some camelids, including llamas and alpacas. Nanobodies are easier to make, and often can be produced in bacterial cells that are much cheaper to grow and maintain than are the mammalian cells required for normal antibody production.
