- Do not take steroids before the stage of requiring oxygen as it is proven to cause more problems (eg. Black fungus - mucor-mycosis) than do good.
- No CT scans for mild symptoms not requiring oxygen. (like exposing yourselves to 300-400 chest X Ray's in one go - or  3.6 years of natural exposure. Some have had 2-3 scans in 10 day hospitalisation. life time additional risk of getting a fatal cancer: 1/25k. ) A Chest X ray can tell you all that along with Oxygen saturation.

##  Protocols
- AIIMS guidelines [here 202104](https://twitter.com/AIIMSRDA/status/1385311406182965249/photo/1).
  - pravINa - "don't even take Ivermectin as drug interactions of this drug with others can cause problems."
- AIIMS & ICMR protocol

- Tamil Nadu protocol
- WHO recommendations [20200902](https://www.bmj.com/content/370/bmj.m3379).

## Symptomatic treatment
- Multivitamins + Cough Syrup + Anti-allergics + Paracetamol (650 mg for adults). The goal from Day 1 has to be to keep fever low if it is high: Hydrate (High fluid intake) + Steam + Paracetamol.
- Keep monitoring disease severity (see [diagnosis](../diagnosis/) page.)


## Oxygen supply
- Pronal breathing demo [here](https://twitter.com/DNeurosx/status/1383848158430588935)
- Severe cases:
    - If oxygen levels are falling below 90 and there is access to a concentrator, please use it. If levels are extremely low (<80), high pressure cylinders are needed; if not, concentrators are useful to maintain levels above 90.
    - Prone (face-down) ventilation useful.
    - BengaLUru supply: [covid.army site](https://covid.army/bangalore)
    - Below 70% doctors usually say 50:50 chances..

## Hospitals and help - bengaLUru
- Beds, ventilators etc. [here](https://covid-19-hospital-data.el.r.appspot.com/?location=Bangalore).


## Case severity
- Non-severe - not the other two levels
- Severe - Sp2 < .9. Respiratory rate > 30 in adults.
- See [diagnosis](../diagnosis/) page.
- Critical
    - Life sustaining treatment needed
    - Acute respiratory syndrome
    - Sepsis
    - Septic shock

## Natural response
- The earlier your body makes the antibody response,more likely you will make a recovery and come out at the other end.
- Those who succumb,make the delayed response with antibodies by the time virus has already gone hiding to various organs.
