- The only effective treatment for Covid in these cases of pneumonia + high inflammation is: Steroids (and possibly Blood thinners). If O2 falls to below 93, either or both of these will have to be used. Three main sorts:
  - Budesonide
  - Methylprednisolone
  - Dexamethasone
- While Dexamethasone is now proven to be beneficial at late stages, Interferon (IFN-1) administration early on likely to save lives.
- (Systemic) Corticosteroids. Alternatives below ("No clear differences in efficacy or adverse effects between different corticosteroids"):
  - Dexamethasone 6mg oral or intravenous daily for 7-10 days.
  - Hydrocortisone 50mg IV every 6 hours 7-10 days
  - Methyl-prednisolone 10mg IV every 6 hours 7-10 days
  - Prednisone 50mg Oral - daily for 7-10 days.
- Tociluzumab. Blocks inflammatory mediator Interleukin 6. UK approved. Within 48 hours of deterioration to Oxygen dependency if used has a mortality benefit.
  - Givne to severely ill patient admitted to hospital within 14d of onset, requiring more than 10L of oxygen and on dexamethasone.
- Remdesivir no mortality benefit (Solidarity trial). Still recommended in many algorithms - may help reduce day or two of hospital stay if administered in the right dose at the right time - [TS](https://twitter.com/Tejasvi_Surya/status/1386334961335078919) .
  - No benefit in normal oxygen saturation.

## Very critical cases
- Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is a final resort for critically ill COVID patients where in both the lungs and heart are given rest for the intended recovery using machines to do what heart and lungs do in our body. An international registry involving 213 hospitals across 36 countries has shown 90 day mortality of patients put on ECMO is about 38%

## Medicine procurement
- The above are extremely difficult to come by right now (in Delhi) but not impossible: be prepared to speak to 50+ pharmacies and to have to use Dunzo/WeFast to pick up meds from afar. Tip: Save as many pharmacist numbers in your phone as you can
