Some sociobiologists have speculated that the long arc of the 1918 Spanish Flu was what led to the rise of National Socialism in Ger and the events culminating in WWII. This extrapolation is from the well supported correlation between behavioral/personality traits & disease load.

The Wuhan disease has already caused overt aggravating effects: Some people have (massively) suffered while others have hugely profited. There will probably be long term consequences of this. There would also be a lot of other subtler effects where causality with be hidden behind a long fuse. In the occident this will entangle with the rise of navyonmAda & everything that would trigger. 

India of the recent centuries has been the land of ill health. It is conceivable this will be exacerbated by the effect of the Wuhan corruption. India being very receptive to bad ideas from the occident will also be afflicted to a degree by navyonmAda. However, there could be other troubles -- antibiotic resistance. The uniquely India mycoses para-epidemic gave a taste of these "side-effects" of possibly ill-prepared medical mechanisms. A lot of the details are hard to work at present. 

The chIna-s will feel enormously vindicated about their approach to things even as the western approach tinged by navyonmAda will look less shiny. However, the economic ascendancy of the west would mean that it will remain an attractive destination for seekers, like those coming in from the south into the US or Europe. Whether these might change the demography is early to say but they have great potential as a vote bank for piNDaka-s supporters & the occident will in the least see the rise conflicts from them at a small-middle scale. 

The Rus despite Sptunik have failed to control the virus and will face further decline.

South America will decline too with the talk of the Brazilian promise probably ending. 

South Africa is already on the brink. All these little events could be the effects.
