## Intro
### Effectiveness expectations
- There are different strains - so vaccination may not be totally effective (just as in case of reinfection).
- Flare-up possibility: The antibodies the vaccine elicits will have virus neutralizing capabilities and that is what needed. But there are other non neutralizing antibodies that gets produced that can flare up the disease. Called ADE (antibody dependent enhancement) has been observed in Dengue and other viral infections.

#### Risks
- 1) Those who are taking vaccines now may become complacent and not wear masks
- 2) The others not vaccinated seeing those getting vaccinated might assume they are protected and not bother
- 3) People might just take one shot and drop out for the second 
- 4) Those vaccinated assume they are protected immediately after the shots which is not true
- 5) People would like to wait to get vaccinated.

### Effectiveness duration
- T cell response following even mild and asymptomatic infection can last upto 6 months. See reinfection page for details. 
- What the duration of immunity is for a given COVID-19 vaccine will only be resolved once community-wide vaccination programmes progress. Phase 3 trials will tell us about efficacy and safety, but well designed phase 4 trials are essential based on representative and large numbers of those vaccinated and follow up over time.

## Approaches
### mRNA for spike protein
- COVID-19 mRNA vaccines give instructions for our cells to make “spike protein”, which gets desposited on cell surface. Then, an immune response to them devolops.

### Spike protein injection
Trigger antibody development thence.

### Foiling Spike protein
- Idea is to bind and block S proteins.

#### ACE2 decoys
- Entry of the virus which happens through binding of Spike (S) protein of the virus with ACE2 receptors found in the lungs. If you use decoy ACE2 substance (which bind better),the virus might bind to this synthetic ACE2 rather than original ACE2 receptors resulting in less viruses thus reducing the inflammation in the lungs. The main problem is the short half life of this synthetic ACE2. Scientists are working how to increase the half life.

### Viral vector vaccines
- viral vector vaccines blood clots are happening - J&J, Oxford.

### Inactivated viral vaccines
- Hepatitis A and Salk Polio virus are inactivated vaccines. These vaccines have adjuvants with alum or aluminium that can cause severe reactions at injection site as opposed to mRNA or DNA vaccines.
- Dr Kang expresses reservations if the inactivated vaccines like COVAXIN work with new mutants as the mutations are occurring at the spike of the virus.

## Natural infection
- See [reinfection](../reinfection) page.

## Vipin's summary
- 1-Ten different Covid-19 vaccines have shared their Phase III data; 2 based on mRNA, 4 on viral vector, 3 on inactivated & 1 on protein subunit platform
- 2-After 4 months of their trials, now there is a definite gradient in their performance:
  - Highly efficacious: mRNA, moderate: viral vector, & low to moderate: inactivated vaccines.
- 3- Efficacy (Point estimates as per published/shared data): Pfizer 95%; Moderna 94.1%, Sputnik-V 91.6%, Novavax 89.3%, AstraZeneca (AZ) 62-90%, Sinopharm’s (BBIBP-CorV) 79%, Covaxin 78%, JNJ 72%, CanSino’s 65.7%, & Sinovac’s (CoronaVac) 50.4%.
- 4-Quality of evidence (confidence):
  - • Highest (Real world use, Effectiveness data & Publication of Efficacy trial)-Pfizer, AstraZeneca & Moderna;
  - • Moderate (Real world use, Publication of efficacy trial): JNJ, Sputnik-V, Sinopharm, & Novavax;
  - • Low-moderate (Real world data, no publication of efficacy trial): CanSino, Sinovac & Covaxin
- 5-Israel, Chile, Bahrein, US & UK are the 5 leading countries as far as highest share of fully vaccinated population is concerned
- 10- Breakthrough infections observed with almost all vaccines. Most mild & moderate, deaths are also seen in fully vaccinated (out of 5800 breakthrough cases with mRNA vaccines in the US, 7% hospitalized & 74 died)
- 11-Most vaccines have comparatively lower efficacy in elderly & comorbidities than in younger and healthy people
- 12-Most gene-based vaccines (mRNA & Viral vector) have high reactogenicity profile.
- 13-Adenovirus vector-based vaccines (AZ & JNJ) have rare, serious adverse events called VITT (vaccine induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia). Incidence varies from 1 case in 40 000 to 1 in 100 000, but the benefits far outweigh than the risks
- 14. Efficacy against variants: Most vaccines have only very modest reductions in efficacy against UK’s B117 & Brazil’s P1 variants. Most vaccines have lower efficacy against South Africa’s B1351 variant (containing E484K mutation).
  - 15-AZ vaccine has got only 10% efficacy against B1351 variant, whereas JNJ (57%) & Novavax (49%) had major reductions in efficacy trials. Sputnik-V, Pfizer & Moderna vaccines have reduced neutralization against B1351.
  - 16-Pfizer vaccine has shown intact efficacy against B1351 in Qatar in real world evidence after 2 doses. Nevertheless, most leading vaccines are developing boosters with revised formulation to tackle B1351 variant.
- 17-So far, natural infection induced protection seems to be more lasting than vaccine induced, particularly in context with non-mRNA vaccines.
  - 18-Only 4 vaccine candidates elicited several folds higher titers of neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) than natural infection (NAbs titers measured in human convalescent serum): Pfizer, Moderna, Novavax & Sputnik-V.  However, natural immunity is much more broader.
  - 19- We know now that natural infection provides at least 8 months of protection. Whereas mRNA vaccines are found to provide protection at least for 6 months without any appreciable loss of efficacy. Other vaccines like inactivated & AZ vaccines may provide lesser duration of protection.
  - 20-Natural infection may provide resistance against immune evader variants also since there is immune responses against not only against S protein but against other antigens of the virus. Further, the variants do not have changes in T-cell epitopes.
  - 22. Those had natural infection can wait for THREE MONTHS for their Covid vaccine shot.
  - 23. In previously infected individuals with anti-spike IgG positive individuals, only ONE DOSE of mRNA vaccine is sufficient!
- 21. Most vaccines elicit both humoral and T cell immunity. However, viral vector vaccine, particularly AZ vaccine has got particularly good CD8 cell response which kill virus infected cell and ameliorate severity of disease.
- 28. Several vaccines are now conducting trials for use of Covid vaccines in pediatric population. Pfizer showed 100% efficacy in 12-15 yrs old, Moderna is doing trial in 6mo to 12 yrs (in US) & 5-11 yrs (in Canada), JNJ 12-17 yrs, Sinovac 3-11 yrs & Novavax 12-17 yrs. AZ has paused their trial in 6-17 yrs.

## Oxford Astra-Zeneca
- ChAd0x1 vaccine azd1222
- Aka Covishield by SII in India. 
-  It is chimpanzee adenovirus packaged with viral Spike protein instruction DNA, due to which the body produces spike proteins and thence antibodies to those.
- safely stored at temperatures of 2C to 8C, about the same as a domestic fridge

### Efficacy
- if you have antibodies to the vector that they use, Chimpanzee Adenovirus results in neutralizing the vaccine efficacy. Such antibodies may develop after the first dose as well, nullifying the second dose. (Chinese had tried similar trials and had demonstrated 52% of their participants had antibodies to Adenovirus which is a naturally occurring viral infection.)

#### Init strain
- Indian population, init strain: Efficacy with single dose 52%. Second dose close to 12 weeks 78.79%
- UK Population, init strain: The efficacy with the first dose is about 70%. UK govt is going for single shot followed by 2nd dose by 12 weeks (will supposedly make efficacy 80%). 
  - vaccine efficacy was 62.1% (n=8,895; CI 41.0% to 75.7%), and 90.0% (n=2,741; CI 67.4% to 97.0%) in participants who received a half dose followed by a full dose.
  - The protection starts on the 22nd day after the first dose.
- It reduces both asymptomatic ones as well as Severe cases.

#### Against other variants
- Against the South African mutant E484 10.4%.
- Symptomatic #B117 70% reduction. Asymptomatic #B117 29% reduction.

### UK Trial problems
- Less Black  and Asian representation.
- Less data about 65 plus age group. Only 5.9% were above age 65. Antibody titre levels were less in those >65 years. The lowered antibody response was because the 2nd dose was given <6 weeks.

### Severe Adverse reactions
- Side effects wise, relatively more side effects (fever, pain etc) reported compared to mRNA vaccines.
- Rare side effect of clots following Covishield - VIPIT(Vaccine induced thrombosis and thrombocytopenia). UK: 30 cases, 24 cerebral venous thrombosis, 8 other with low platelets (among 18 million doses) MHRA released number
  - Not transfusing platelets,treating with immunoglobulins and using non heparin drugs to thin the blood should treat the complication.
- Many sudden deaths and deaths occurring in the first three to seven days of taking the Covishield vaccine in India could also be explained by this autoimmune mechanism.
- Oxford Vaccine caused 1 transverse myelitis (inflammation of the spinal cord)  in a volunteer

## Pfizer-BioNTech 
- An mRNA vaccine
- Storage requirement at -70 C

### Efficacy
- ≥14 days after a single dose:       42%
- ≥7 days after the second dose:    86%
  - Reduces mild/ severe cases by 95% 7 days after 2nd dose of vaccine; reduces infection by 90%. 100% efficacy in adolescents
- 91.3% efficacy even after 6 months.
- Immune response after mRNA vaccinations after 2 doses demonstrated good and safe antibodies 8 weeks later. The efficacy against mutants was slightly reduced.
- Both the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines are 10 times less effective against the South African variant

### Severe Adverse reactions
- The exclusion criteria that was used during Pfizer vaccine trial included people with allergies. Bang on, on the field, exactly same happened. 2 healthcare professionals in the UK had anaphylactic reaction. Now the health regulators have adviced those having similar allergies or anaphylaxis should not get this vaccine.
- Pfizer vaccine volunteers got Bell's palsy(4 of them)
- Low platelet count called Immune thrombocytopenia following Pfizer/Moderna vaccine administration are getting reported in the USA in small numbers.
- Till date,66 cases out of ~18 million vaccinations (=0.00000003%) had such reactions. All but 1 within 11 minutes. No deaths at all.

## Moderna vaccine
- Synthetic mRNA-1273 for spike protein.
- Storage: -20 Deg up to 6 months

### Efficacy
- 94.1% efficacy.
- Shown effective about 40 days after injection.
- It is not doing much to reduce the asymptomatic ones. The mRNA vaccines give good robust antibodies but not the IgA antibodies coating the nasal passages.So,you still carry viruses and keep spreading.
- Both the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines are 10 times less effective against the South African variant

## Novavax/ Novavac/ Covovax vaccine
- Directly injects stabilized spike proteins (mRNA or DNA not used.) This same technology has been used since 1986 with Hep B vaccines that are given to even infants and found extremely safer.
  - They took the code for the Spike Protein, put it into another virus called baculovirus that infected moth cells. Spike proteins made were collected, made into nanoparticles, and used as vaccine.
- can be stored in warmer temperatures, anywhere between 36°F and 46°F.
- Serum Institute in India tied up with Novavax and ready to roll out vaccines by July. US blocked raw materials in April.
- Efficacy: Overall - 89%, South Africa - 50%
  - Current strain D614G: 95%
  - UK strain B1.1.7: 89.3% 
  - South African  variant 501Y.V2: 60%
    - HIV Neg: 60.1%
    - HIV Pos: 49.4%
    - Severe disease: 100%
- Among placebo group for Novavax’s vaccine in South Africa, people with prior #COVID19 infections appeared just as likely to get sick as people without prior infections—means past infection wasn’t fully protective for B1351 variant.


## Bharat Biotech Covaxin BBV152
- inactivated / attenuated whole virus particles 
- DCGI approval for Phase 3 clinical trials in 26,000 participants in over 25 centres across India.

### Severe Adverse reactions
- 1 person developed encephalitis. Was threatened with a lawsuit.

### Efficacy
- The efficacy against severe COVID-19 disease was 100 per cent (95%CI: 60-100), with an impact on reduction in hospitalisations. The efficacy against asymptomatic COVID-19 infection was 70 per cent, suggesting decreased transmission in COVAXIN recipients.
  
### Dosage gap
- However, the immunity level produced after the first dose of Covaxin is not as high and "this means the second dose should be taken after four weeks to ensure full efficacy".


## Gamelaya Sputnik V
- The Russians have used human (rather than chimp) Adenovirus and use 2 different strains (Ad26 and Ad5) as vectors in first and second dose respectively. Apparently,this reduces the chances of preexisting antibodies reducing the efficacy.
- Russia says its Sputnik V vaccine is 91% effective. Good effectiveness against  B117(UK variant).
- Not that good against African B1351 variant.
- Storage: Regular fridge temperature. 

### Risks
- FDA says: there should be less than 1 virus particle in 30 billion particles. Brazilians fear that due to replication in cell lines, the virus may acquire and retain immortal reproductive ability.
- Adenovirus is also a horrible virus specially in the immunocompromised.It causes deaths also in the immunocompromised by causing liver damage,gut infiltration and Brain infiltration.

## Sinovac CoronaVac 
- inactivated / attenuated whole virus particles 
- Brazil: 50.38% effective in late-stage trials in Brazil (far below the 78% previously announced)
- Indonesian drug regulators say interim data from Phase 3 trials showed it is 65.3% effective
- stored in a standard refrigerator at 2-8 degrees Celsius

## Sinopharm vaccine
- inactivated / attenuated whole virus particles 
- Supposedly 79.34% effective. UAE: 86% effective

## Johnson and Johnson (JNJ Janssen) vaccine
-  uses Ad26 Adenovirus as a vector carrying the virus spike protein.
- single dose vaccine.
- Efficacy
  - Overall - 66%, South Africa: 57%
  - 66 % effective in Latin America, 57 % effective in South Africa. 
  - 85 % effective overall at preventing severe disease

## Other Trials as of 2020-12
- FDA standards - "If a particular vaccine doesn't demonstrate a minimum of 50 percent efficacy, it will not be approved."

## Failed attempts
- BCG vaccination effect.

## India
### Approvals
- J&J vaccine will 'get back on track soon'
- Sputnik V 202104
- Bharat Biotech - approved "in public interest as an abundant precaution, in clinical trial mode, to have more options for vaccinations, especially in case of infection by mutant strains".
- Oxford/ AstraZeneca. manufactured locally by the Serum Institute of India.

### Immunization priority
60% of vaccines globally, plans to immunise about 300 million people by July 2021. It will prioritise health care workers, the emergency services, and those who are clinically vulnerable because of age or pre-existing conditions.
