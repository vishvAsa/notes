- Novavax/ Novavac/ Covovax vaccine
- Directly injects stabilized spike proteins (mRNA or DNA not used.) This same technology has been used since 1986 with Hep B vaccines that are given to even infants and found extremely safer.
  - They took the code for the Spike Protein, put it into another virus called baculovirus that infected moth cells. Spike proteins made were collected, made into nanoparticles, and used as vaccine.
- can be stored in warmer temperatures, anywhere between 36°F and 46°F.
- Serum Institute in India tied up with Novavax and ready to roll out vaccines by July. US blocked raw materials in April.

## Efficacy

- UK strain B1.1.7: 89.3% 
- South African  variant 501Y.V2: 60%

100% efficacy against moderate to severe disease.
