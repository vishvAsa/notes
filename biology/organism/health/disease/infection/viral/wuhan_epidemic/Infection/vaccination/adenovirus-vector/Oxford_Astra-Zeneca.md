title = "Oxford Astra-Zeneca"

+++
- ChAd0x1 vaccine azd1222
- Aka Covishield by SII in India. 
-  It is chimpanzee adenovirus packaged with viral Spike protein instruction DNA, due to which the body produces spike proteins and thence antibodies to those.
- safely stored at temperatures of 2C to 8C, about the same as a domestic fridge

## Efficacy
- if you have antibodies to the vector that they use, Chimpanzee Adenovirus results in neutralizing the vaccine efficacy. Such antibodies may develop after the first dose as well, nullifying the second dose. (Chinese had tried similar trials and had demonstrated 52% of their participants had antibodies to Adenovirus which is a naturally occurring viral infection.)

### B 1.617
#### Hospitalization
According to Public Health England after both doses:

- AstraZeneca is 92% effective against hospitalization

#### Symptomatic covid
- 1 dose - 33% efficacy
- 2 doses - 60% efficacy

### Init strain
- Indian population, init strain: Efficacy with single dose 52%. Second dose close to 12 weeks 78.79%
- UK Population, init strain: The efficacy with the first dose is about 70%. UK govt is going for single shot followed by 2nd dose by 12 weeks (will supposedly make efficacy 80%). 
  - vaccine efficacy was 62.1% (n=8,895; CI 41.0% to 75.7%), and 90.0% (n=2,741; CI 67.4% to 97.0%) in participants who received a half dose followed by a full dose.
  - The protection starts on the 22nd day after the first dose.
- It reduces both asymptomatic ones as well as Severe cases.

### Against other variants
- Against the South African mutant E484 10.4%.
- Symptomatic #B117 70% reduction. Asymptomatic #B117 29% reduction.


## UK Trial problems
- Less Black  and Asian representation.
- Less data about 65 plus age group. Only 5.9% were above age 65. Antibody titre levels were less in those >65 years. The lowered antibody response was because the 2nd dose was given <6 weeks.

## Severe Adverse reactions
- Side effects wise, relatively more side effects (fever, pain etc) reported compared to mRNA vaccines.
- Rare side effect of clots following Covishield - VIPIT(Vaccine induced thrombosis and thrombocytopenia). UK: 30 cases, 24 cerebral venous thrombosis, 8 other with low platelets (among 18 million doses) MHRA released number
  - Not transfusing platelets,treating with immunoglobulins and using non heparin drugs to thin the blood should treat the complication.
- Many sudden deaths and deaths occurring in the first three to seven days of taking the Covishield vaccine in India could also be explained by this autoimmune mechanism.
- Oxford Vaccine caused 1 transverse myelitis (inflammation of the spinal cord)  in a volunteer
