title = "Gamelaya Sputnik V"

+++
- The Russians have used human (rather than chimp) Adenovirus and use 2 different strains (Ad26 and Ad5) as vectors in first and second dose respectively. Apparently,this reduces the chances of preexisting antibodies reducing the efficacy.
- Russia says its Sputnik V vaccine is 91% effective. Good effectiveness against  B117(UK variant).
- Not that good against African B1351 variant.
- Storage: Regular fridge temperature. 

## Risks
- FDA says: there should be less than 1 virus particle in 30 billion particles. Brazilians fear that due to replication in cell lines, the virus may acquire and retain immortal reproductive ability.
- Adenovirus is also a horrible virus specially in the immunocompromised.It causes deaths also in the immunocompromised by causing liver damage,gut infiltration and Brain infiltration.
