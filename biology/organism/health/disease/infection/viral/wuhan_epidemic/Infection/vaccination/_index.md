## Effectiveness expectations
- There are different strains - so vaccination may not be totally effective (just as in case of reinfection).
- Flare-up possibility: The antibodies the vaccine elicits will have virus neutralizing capabilities and that is what needed. But there are other non neutralizing antibodies that gets produced that can flare up the disease. Called ADE (antibody dependent enhancement) has been observed in Dengue and other viral infections.

### Risks
- 1) Those who are taking vaccines now may become complacent and not wear masks
- 2) The others not vaccinated seeing those getting vaccinated might assume they are protected and not bother
- 3) People might just take one shot and drop out for the second
- 4) Those vaccinated assume they are protected immediately after the shots which is not true
- 5) People would like to wait to get vaccinated.

## Effectiveness duration
- T cell response following even mild and asymptomatic infection can last upto 6 months. See reinfection page for details.
- What the duration of immunity is for a given COVID-19 vaccine will only be resolved once community-wide vaccination programmes progress. Phase 3 trials will tell us about efficacy and safety, but well designed phase 4 trials are essential based on representative and large numbers of those vaccinated and follow up over time.

## Mixed vaccination
- Germany, Canada recommend using Pfizer/Moderna as the second shot following the AZ vaccine as the first shot.
