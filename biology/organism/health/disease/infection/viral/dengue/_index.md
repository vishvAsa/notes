## Vectors
Dengue fever is transmitted to humans through the bites of infected female mosquitoes. Aedes mosquitoes (especially Aedes aegypti) are the primary vectors. After virus incubation, an infected mosquito is capable of spreading the virus for the rest of its life.

These mosquitoes are found in tropical and subtropical regions around the world. They live in urban habitats and breed mostly in man-made containers (like buckets of water, potted plants etc) .
