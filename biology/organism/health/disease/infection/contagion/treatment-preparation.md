- Every winter,hospitals in the west prepare themselves for winter surges with extra beds, extra oxygen and ICU beds.

## Oxygen
### India
- Under normal circumstances,a typical 500 bed hospital catering to multiples of specialities required Oxygen that was supplied through cylinders which cost very cheap INR 100-150.
- There was never a huge demand that individual hospitals or the govt had to invest in Oxygen plants at every district level. A typical Oxygen plant costs INR 75 lakhs to a hospital if they had to install one. It would take 8 to 10 years for any hospital investing this Oxygen plant to recover the money as the consumption was less.
