## Principle
You inject antigens into the body. Then antibodies are generated, which last for a certain duration. Booster doses might increase the duration.

## Efficacy

- Vaccine effectiveness - ability of vaccine to prevent outcomes of interest in the “real world”
- For some vaccines, booster dose increases efficacy.
