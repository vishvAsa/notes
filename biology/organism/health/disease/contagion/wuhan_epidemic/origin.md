- SARS-like viruses as a whole (i.e. SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV2 and several related bat SARS-like viruses) which from a distinct branch from the MERS-CoV.   
- "Unrelated respiratory disease viruses like adenoviruses & coronaviruses might have exchanged genes in their deep evolutionary history. This interesting finding would have come about had the impetus not come from the ongoing pandemic." - MT

### Engineering
- Analysis of SARS-like viruses suggests that engineering or directed modification in a lab before release.

## Outbreak theories
- Might have got to man due to eating animals in the infamous wet-market. (The original SARS epidemic could be linked to consumption of civets. )
- leaked from a nearby lab (into cats or lab workers) unintentionally or otherwise. Wuhan is a major virological center of China and given that it has been involved in SARS-like coronavirus research for more than decade.
