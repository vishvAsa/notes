## Presymptomatic phase
Infection can be 2-14 days before symptoms appear. 

## Symptoms
### Major
- Fever
- Cough
- Shortness of breath

### Minor
- Tiredness, body ache, sore throat, diarrhea, vomiting
- stuffy nose, Loss of smell

### Case studies
- 2020 Aug - Devanahalli, BLR. Patient and wife reported fever which came and went for about 4 days. Then, pulse oxymeter showed 92% saturation in patient. He tested positive.
- When on oxygen, saturation level is 95, but when he goes to toilet etc.., it comes down to 80.

## Tests
- "The current RT-PCR has a sensitivity at best of 70 percent with a turn around time of 120 minutes."
- A Crisper based diagnostic testing tried out in Thailand offers 97-100 percent sensitivity to detect the virus and has a turn around time of 75 minutes.
- RT-PCR remains the gold standard for the diagnosis of COVID-19 in sputum samples. However, the combination of different diagnostic tests is highly recommended to achieve adequate sensitivity and specificity. ... Meta-analysis showed that computed tomography has high sensitivity (91.9% [89.8%-93.7%]), but low specificity (25.1% [21.0%-29.5%]). The combination of IgM and IgG antibodies demonstrated promising results for both parameters (84.5% [82.2%-86.6%]; 91.6% [86.0%-95.4%], respectively). For RT-PCR tests, rectal stools/swab, urine, and plasma were less sensitive while sputum (97.2% [90.3%-99.7%]) presented higher sensitivity for detecting the virus.
