## Duration
- "About 80 percent of infections, according to the World Health Organization, “are mild or asymptomatic,” and patients recover after two weeks, on average."
- Can last very long - "When I spoke with LeClerc on day 66, she was still experiencing waves of symptoms. “Before this, I was a fit, healthy 32-year-old,” she said. “Now I’ve been reduced to not being able to stand up in the shower"" [AT](https://medium.com/the-atlantic/covid-19-can-last-for-several-months-c3391bddbe6c)

## Short term effects
- For basic symptoms see [diagnosis page](../diagnosis/) .

### Severity

- Initial estimates: "For COVID-19, data to date suggest that 80% of infections are mild or asymptomatic, 15% are severe infection, requiring oxygen and 5% are critical infections, requiring ventilation." - [WHO-2020-03-06](https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/situation-reports/20200306-sitrep-46-covid-19.pdf?sfvrsn=96b04adf_4)
- Indian scenario highest mortality between the age 40-70 years. 56% of the severely affected in India are under 40's.

## Long term effects
### Heart
- Several cases are getting reported of young adults sent home after 7 days with a negative result, develop sudden symptoms and die. Suspected cause: The small blood vessels of the heart had intense inflammation an entity known as MIS(Multi System Inflammatory Syndrome),see the photograph taken attached below. [FB](https://www.facebook.com/drpraveenks/posts/10158729975141385) Exercise should be avoided for some time.
- Scientists took the mother cells called stem cells that differentiate to heart muscle cells and infected them with the virus. Within 72 hours,the virus could cause death of cells and stop the cells contracting.

- 35% infected athletes got myocarditis. "“extremely dangerous” for athletes diagnosed with myocarditis to play competitive sports for at least three to six months, because of the risk of serious arrhythmia or sudden death"
- Case of Dr Praveen of London: "I had bad chest symptoms for 3 months now fully normal."

### Brain 
- Cov2 virus can disrupt this blood brain barrier and enter brain cells and infect them directly.
- Cognitive penalty: [medarxiv](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.10.20.20215863v1). "People who had recovered, including those no longer reporting symptoms, exhibited significant cognitive deficits when controlling for age, gender, education level, income, racial-ethnic group and pre-existing medical disorders. They were of substantial effect size for people who had been hospitalised, but also for mild but biologically confirmed cases who reported no breathing difficulty."
- It exploits the brain cells’ machinery to multiply, but doesn’t destroy them. Instead, it chokes off oxygen to adjacent cells, causing them to wither and die.
- The coronavirus seems to rapidly decrease the number of synapses, the connections between neurons. “Days after infection, and we already see a dramatic reduction in the amount of synapses,” Dr. Muotri said. “We don’t know yet if that is reversible or not.”

- MRI based study has demonstrated micro structural defects in olfactory (smell recognition area) and hippocampus (short term memory area) which translated to loss of smell that is widely known in acute setting to memory loss observed 3 months later.

### Lung scarring 
- 6 weeks and 12 weeks after discharge,the scarring decreases (Pics [FB](https://www.facebook.com/drpraveenks/posts/10158842491361385) )
- Many around the world are suffering with shortness of breath,chest tightness 3 months post infection.

### Eye
- Sudden vision loss due to occlusion of blood vessels supplying the eye increasingly recognized these days. Doctors advise retina scan post recovery.

### Other effects
- Multi-system inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C)
- 26% of those admitted to ICU from COVID had invasive fungal infections.
- Auto immune disorders like guillan barre.

## Genetic susceptibility
- Neanderthal genetic inheritence.

## Comorbidity
Severe disease can result in people with diabetes, obesity, chronic breathing difficulty (like asthma), compromised immune system.

## Causal chain
- Lung epithelial cells are infected.
- Virus is then detected by macrophages. They produce interferons and cytokines. But the virus is oblivious to anti-viral effects of interferons. Cytokines attract more white blood cells. So there is a cytokine storm from a chain reaction.
- This results in inflammation, formation of fibrin and damage to lung cells, weakinging of blood vessels leading to seepage and drowning.
