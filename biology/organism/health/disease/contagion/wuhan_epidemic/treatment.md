## Overview
- AIIMS guidelines [here 202104](https://twitter.com/AIIMSRDA/status/1379821305780858886/photo/1).
  - pravINa - "don't even take Ivermectin as drug interactions of this drug with others can cause problems."
- WHO recommendations [20200902](https://www.bmj.com/content/370/bmj.m3379).
- Do not take steroids before the stage of requiring oxygen as it is proven to cause more problems than do good.
- Keep oxygen concentrators. Prone (face-down) ventilation useful.

### Case severity
- Non-severe - not the other two levels
- Severe - Sp2 < .9. Respiratory rate > 30 in adults.
- Critical
  - Life sustaining treatment needed
  - Acute respiratory syndrome
  - Sepsis
  - Septic shock

## Severe and critical cases
- While Dexamethasone is now proven to be beneficial at late stages, Interferon (IFN-1) administration early on likely to save lives.
- (Systemic) Corticosteroids. Alternatives below ("No clear differences in efficacy or adverse effects between different corticosteroids"):
  - Dexamethasone 6mg oral or intravenous daily for 7-10 days.
  - Hydrocortisone 50mg IV every 6 hours 7-10 days
  - Methyl-prednisolone 10mg IV every 6 hours 7-10 days
  - Prednisone 50mg Oral - daily for 7-10 days.
- Tociluzumab. Blocks inflammatory mediator Interleukin 6. UK approved.

### Very critical cases
- Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is a final resort for critically ill COVID patients where in both the lungs and heart are given rest for the intended recovery using machines to do what heart and lungs do in our body. An international registry involving 213 hospitals across 36 countries has shown 90 day mortality of patients put on ECMO is about 38%


## Upcoming drugs
- Bacricitinib which has proven more benefit when combined with Remdesivir.
 
## Failed drugs
- Hydroxychloroquine
- Azithromycin the antibiotic was thought to have a role. The RECOVERY trial from Oxford has shown no benefit.
- Itolizumab
- Remdesvir in isolation. "The manufacturer Gilead was aware of WHO sponsored Solidarity trial showing no clear benefit but struck the deal with EU just before the trial results were made public."
- "Fabi flu is useless drug given only in India with absolutely no benefit" - Praveen

## Antibody administration
### Monoclonal antibodies
-  One antibody comes from a human who had recovered from a SARS-CoV-2 infection; a B cell that makes the antibody was harvested from the personâ€™s blood and the genes for the immune protein isolated and copied.
- The other antibody is from a mouse, which was engineered to have a human immune system, that had the spike protein injected into it.
- Experiments in both golden hamsters and rhesus macaque monkeys that intentionally were infected with SARS-CoV-2 showed that the cocktail could reduce viral levels and disease pathology.

#### Convalescent plasma therapy
- Donald Trump underwent this. He received was 8gm of monoclonal antibodies - very expensive right now.
- Details [here](https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/convalescent-plasma-therapy/about/pac-20486440). Plasma from a person who has recently recovered from the disease (within 28 days) is given to the patient.
- Plasma therapy is fading away, instead monoclonal antibodies are showing more promise.

### Other peptides
- Fucoidans in seaweed act as a decoy. "Recent research by Rensellear Polytechnic Institute and Prof Kou Hayakawa of Japan confirm this. Seaweed based spirulina chikki (cftri chikki made by aquaseal technologies) was administered to the first batch of covid-19 patients at Mysore with astounding success."

#### Nanobodies
nanobodies, based on a kind of antibody naturally produced by some camelids, including llamas and alpacas. Nanobodies are easier to make, and often can be produced in bacterial cells that are much cheaper to grow and maintain than are the mammalian cells required for normal antibody production. 

## Long term
### Look for heart damage
- People might be dying of discharge for this reason.
- Check D dimer after discharge, do MRI.
