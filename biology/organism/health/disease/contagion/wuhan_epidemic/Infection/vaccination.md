## Effectiveness expectations
- There are different strains - so vaccination may not be totally effective (just as in case of reinfection).
- Flare-up possibility: The antibodies the vaccine elicits will have virus neutralizing capabilities and that is what needed. But there are other non neutralizing antibodies that gets produced that can flare up the disease. Called ADE (antibody dependent enhancement) has been observed in Dengue and other viral infections.

## Trials as of 2020-08
- Trackers - [WaPo](https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2020/health/covid-vaccine-update-coronavirus)
- FDA standards - "If a particular vaccine doesn't demonstrate a minimum of 50 percent efficacy,it will not be approved."

## Inactivated viral vaccines
- Hepatitis A and Salk Polio virus are inactivated vaccines. These vaccines have adjuvants with alum or aluminium that can cause severe reactions at injection site as opposed to mRNA or DNA vaccines.
