## Immuno-compromised folks
Cancer patients and those who have a compromised immune system keep shedding viruses for long. Example: a cancer patient who had chemotherapy kept shedding virus till 105 days( 3 months) despite twice being titrated with Remdesivir and plasma therapy.


## In internal organs
The virus can persist in various internal organs.The gastrointestinal system is a good nidus for this virus. The biopsy of the gut from asymptomatic infected  patients 3 months later showed persistence of the virus in the gut.
