## Strain difference
Some strains are much more infectious. 

## 20J/501Y.V3
- Manaus, Brazil

## VOC-202012/01, B.1.1.7, 20I/501Y.V1

### Mutations
- N501Y. Slight change in highly variable protein region [here](https://twitter.com/blog_supplement/status/1340755077594816518). One claim is that plasma therapy triggered it.
- It has acquired another troublesome mutation E484 (found earlier in South Africa strain) which makes it adopted well to escape out from antibodies,cause re-infections and lessened vaccine efficacy.

### Spread
- Scientists speculate the B117 arose from one single source in an immunocompromised one where the virus underwent mutation.
- In September, it first appeared from England.
- By Nov it accounted for 28% of the virus moving around
- Was circulating in the USA in mid Nov itself.
- By Dec 9th,62% of the virus was this variant in London.
- B117 variant “may be associated with higher degree of mortality” (30-40% increase in 60+ age group), in addition to 50-70% more transmissible. 


## South Africa 501.V2, 20H/501Y.V2,  B.1.351 lineage
- spreading faster,tends to have high viral load and possibly more severe to young adults.
- Mutations: N501Y E484K. 
- Preliminary data from South Africa suggests that the novel variant 501.V2 wasn't recognised by antibodies in 21/44 serum samples collected from people infected in the first wave.


## D614G and G614
- Round about Feb 2020, new variant emerged in the Europe that had a mutation to make it spread faster.

## L452R California
- Resurfaced in Jan 2021
