- In September, it first appeared from England.
- Was circulating in the USA in mid Nov itself.
- Mutations
  - N501Y. Slight change in highly variable protein region [here](https://twitter.com/blog_supplement/status/1340755077594816518). One claim is that plasma therapy triggered it.
- By Nov it accounted for 28% of the virus moving around
- By Dec 9th,62% of the virus was this variant in London.
