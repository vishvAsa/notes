## General
- When disease attacks, an effective fight must be orchestrated. Information and a fighting-attitude is essential.
- Rest - When illness attacks, attempt to stop all work, take rest; otherwise the stressed body will be open to other illnesses. Don't even venture out for amusement- because it often simply means catering to old addictions.

### Depression
- During disease, one may feel: 'Life has no purpose. It is not worth living in this pain.'

#### Counteraction
The minutest exercise - repeatedly and purposefully moving a finger or contracting a muscle - is a great help. No situation where such exercise is not possible.
