## Pulse oxymeter
- can rapidly detect even small changes in how efficiently oxygen is being carried to the extremities furthest from the heart.
- a small, clip-like device that attaches to a body part, like toes or an earlobe.
- Small beams of light pass through the blood in the finger, measuring the amount of oxygen -  by measuring changes of light absorption in oxygenated or deoxygenated blood.
- Healthy lungs keep the blood oxygenated at a level between 95 and 100 percent -- if it dips below 92 percent, it's a cause for concern and a doctor might decide to intervene with supplemental oxygen.
