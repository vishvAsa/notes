- Bones heal best when loads are applied to them. Weight bearing activities through injured bones stimulates an increase in bone growth at injury sites and a subsequent increase in bone strength. This concept is why immobilizer boots are often used in ankle and foot fractures rather than plaster casts. Allowing patients to walk while protecting their healing bone allows the bony repair process to occur faster and more thoroughly than keeping weight entirely off of a fracture site.
