## Detection
- Cartilage is also aneural – meaning that it has no nerve supply. Because of the lack of nerve endings, pain is generally not felt when cartilage is damaged until it has been worn down significantly. Pain is felt when faulty movement at the injury site has started to impact another tissue in the area, such as underlying bone or associated ligamentous tissue.

## Healing
- Cartilage is avascular - no blood supply. Very slow-healing. Nutrition to cartilage is maintained by fluid in the joints, which lubricates the tissue. The lubrication process occurs by a sort of flushing mechanism, when load is applied and then removed from the tissue repeatedly. Activities such as stationary cycling and walking that involve repeated smooth joint movement can promote this lubrication process without creating too much stress on injured cartilage tissue.
- Inactivity has negative effects on joint cartilage. Lack of movement or of weight bearing can cause thinning of cartilage, making it susceptible to injury. Therefore – even fairly immediately after injury – exercises that encourage joints to move throughout their range of motion and that involve some degree of load bearing through the joint surfaces help cartilage to heal. 

## Maintenance
Inactivity has negative effects on joint cartilage. Lack of movement or of weight bearing can cause thinning of cartilage, making it susceptible to injury.
