- Tendons attach muscles to bones. Tendons generally have a more limited blood supply than muscles. 
- Healing can take up to 12 weeks. The injured tendon may need to be supported with a splint or cast to take tension off of the repaired tendon.
- Tendons tend to respond well to a particular type of tension. Eccentric activity, which means that a tendon is stressed while it is being lengthened, is particularly helpful for tendon remodeling after injury.
