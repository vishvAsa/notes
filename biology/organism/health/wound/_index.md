## Initial care
### Cleaning
- Irrigate with (running) water (+ gentle soap) - even for several minutes.
- Antibiotic or antiseptic application not needed for small wounds with low infection risk. 
  - Natural choices
    - Honey: Osmotic, acidic - Dehydrates bacteria.
    - Anti septics: turmeric, crushed garlic cloves.
  - Bacitracin is popular.
- Stop mild bleeding - apply pressure with sterile gauze or cloth. Turmeric works.

### Fibrin film
- a microscopic protein (fibrin) film (aka scab) forms rapidly over a wound as part of the natural clotting process.  has tiny pores that let air reach the wound but are too small to allow bacteria and some viruses to pass through. ([BBC](https://www.bbc.com/news/health-44600618)).
- this film could be a barrier against microbial infection for at least 12 hours. gives the immune system time to get white blood cells to the wound to counteract any infection
- Takes about 1/2 hour to form/ clot. "After that, it might not be so bad to add petroleum jelly, but before then, from our findings, it appears to damage this film."

### Wound closing
- Leave unclean wounds, bites, and punctures open. Lest infection arise.
- Antiseptic pads best (store in advance) .

## Healing stages
- White blood cells help to ward off infection and begin to repair the damaged tissue and any broken blood vessels.
- Red blood cells create collagen to form a base for new tissue to grow in the wound.
- New skin forms over this tissue, and as the edges pull inward, the wound gets smaller.
- A scar forms, strengthening the area over the wound.

## Later care
- check wound every day
  - remove any bandages
  - check for infection signs - pain and soreness, swelling, redness, draining, or you develop a fever
  - clean with soap and water
- Coconut oil or petroleum jelly to minimize scarring.
