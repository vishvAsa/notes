## Beauty
> When you gaze at beauty you are viewing the face of God. When you turn your back on beauty you are turning your back on all that is good in life. Beauty is the key to life, it can be found amidst the most terrible destruction and hurt. If your life is shit you need to create something beautiful even if it's only one thing. Having something beautiful in your life protects you from all the shit around you. It's the world's most powerful shield. - GA
