## GuruAnerobic advice
- LCHP IF - the way forward diet: LC (Low Carbohydrate) HP (High Protein) IF (Intermittent Fasting)
- PARTIT LA FT - the way forward (exercise) - PA (Physical Activity) RT (Resistance Training) IT (Interval Training) LA (Lactic Acid Acidosis) FT (Fast Twitch Muscle)
  - As well as helping you lose fat, this is your code for dynamic strength, fitness and robust health. It will enable you to achieve the physical targets in Gang Fit 2. Most of this they don't teach at school (another example of why school doesn't prepare you for real life, even though they say it does)

At first glance this may seem like a lot; it isn't - it's the normal life of a wild carnivore. That's what you should be. It's only a lot of work for people who are used to wall-to-wall comfort.
