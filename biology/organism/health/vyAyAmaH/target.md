- Stay at the lighter end of your body's frame
  - Over-muscled, fueled by constantly eating, is not healthy

## Physical Standards 
Via Guru Anaerobic:  

- 1 Deadlift: One-rep max of 2 x body weight (general strength) 
- 2 Chin-ups: 20 (usable upper body strength) 
- 3 100m sprint: Under 13 seconds (speed) 
- 4 One mile: Under 6 minutes (endurance) 
- 5 Body-fat: 10-12% - a six-pack is just visible (health) 

These are not elite standards, but achieving all five would likely take you into the top 1% of the population. You'd be in tremendous physical shape.

The most challenging for an older person (60yrs+) to achieve is a sub-13sec sprint; sub-14secs would be more appropriate (the others are not too difficult). Retaining the ability, as you age, to generate dynamic muscular contractions provides solid information about the general physical state of the muscles, tendons, ligaments and nerves. If you can do it without a warm-up, even better. Being able to turn on strength, quickness and agility without any warm-up is the pure expression of youth. 

There are different health tests a person can do: In a clinic/lab – blood tests, biomarker tests, blood pressure, heart rate, scans; in a gym - stress tests, body fat, VO2 max, and so on. That's all well and good, but these five simple performance tests you can do yourself and are easy to measure. Physical performance is an excellent indicator of the general health of the body. There is no point adding in more target categories - vertical high jump, rowing ability, back-flips, and so on, as it's the engine in the car that ultimately determines performance not what the car can be used for. The five categories give us a global view of the state of the 'engine'. That's enough.

## Age and intesity
- "As you get older you should dedicate a greater proportion of your diminishing exercise capacity to hard and robust exercise - yet you're told to take it easy. If all you do is “take it easy", eventually all you'll be able to do is take it easy - your body will have lost its capacity to generate and tolerate force, a high heart rate, acidosis, shocks or running for the bus - until eventually, even the normal task of walking up a flight of stairs is an effort and leaves you breathless. Senescence means decreasing variation."
- "If you argue, "why do I need to train so hard that I induce the burning sensation of acidosis? How does it benefit me?" My response would be that you used to be able to do it, and cope with it - there's the reason. It recreates what you could do when you were younger, and if you can do what you could do when you were younger, you are younger."
- "A study found that lactic acid (as sodium lactate, injected into the blood stream) in mice, keeps them young by assisting in the production of mitochondria, the power generators in every cell. "
- "In aging we want to maintain our physical variability (beta-blockers are designed to clip the heart rate to protect the patient; variation may kill them). Two things happen over time if you don't push your heart rate (HR); max HR decreases and resting HR increases. Endurance training lowers the resting HR but doesn't work the top end; a reason to keep up high intensity work, to 'push' the high HR, which also has the effect of lowering the resting HR."

### Leeway for youth
- 1 Young athletes (teens/20's) can be lean & fit, even with a bad diet
- 2 They can progress even with a bad training program

## Flexibile intensity
The idea is that you train how you feel on the day, and use your program as a guide not as an absolute. This meant that when you were fresh you might do more; when tired you do less. Aka intuitive/ agile training. Intuitive training isn't an excuse to slack, it's an attempt to work with the body.


## Quickness vs power
- 1 Power is the fast application of strength
- 2 Fast movement without strength is quickness - reflexivity; like a cat trying to catch a butterfly with it's paw
- 3 The outcome of fast application of strength (power) on an external object isn't necessarily high speed
- 4 Reflexivity is verrry stubborn to trainingसौवीरे च विशेषः
- 5 Strength can be improved immensely
- 6 Power is improved by increasing strength
- 7 Power is hardly improved by moving lighter weights faster

> There's a saying that, 'You can't fire a cannonball from a canoe" - you need a battleship.... To increase your power you need to increase your "rate of force development" (RFD) - emphasis on the force component. No amount of throwing a golf-ball fast will make me throw a baseball faster, and it degrades further (if it were possible) as the weight of the implement you're throwing increases. To throw a baseball faster I need a 'stronger throwing arm’ and most likely a stronger upper and lower body, making sure not to negatively impact the whip, elasticity and efficient movement pattern of my arm/shoulder.

## Chronic long endurence exercise
"If you insist on doing chronic long endurance exercise when you're older swap from weight-bearing (running) to non-weight bearing exercise (swimming, cycling, rowing, etc). Only excepting is normal walking. ... Chronic running when you're older is a disaster  - injuries, joint probs, etc.." Exception to non-weight bearing clause: "Intense/robust exercise, HIIT, intervals, RT - it is essential to do weight-bearing exercise, but you can add non weight-bearing as well."
