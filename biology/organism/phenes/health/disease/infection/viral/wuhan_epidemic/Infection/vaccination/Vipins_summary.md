- 1-Ten different Covid-19 vaccines have shared their Phase III data; 2 based on mRNA, 4 on viral vector, 3 on inactivated & 1 on protein subunit platform
- 2-After 4 months of their trials, now there is a definite gradient in their performance:
  - Highly efficacious: mRNA, moderate: viral vector, & low to moderate: inactivated vaccines.
- 3- Efficacy (Point estimates as per published/shared data): Pfizer 95%; Moderna 94.1%, Sputnik-V 91.6%, Novavax 89.3%, AstraZeneca (AZ) 62-90%, Sinopharm’s (BBIBP-CorV) 79%, Covaxin 78%, JNJ 72%, CanSino’s 65.7%, & Sinovac’s (CoronaVac) 50.4%.
- 4-Quality of evidence (confidence):
  - • Highest (Real world use, Effectiveness data & Publication of Efficacy trial)-Pfizer, AstraZeneca & Moderna;
  - • Moderate (Real world use, Publication of efficacy trial): JNJ, Sputnik-V, Sinopharm, & Novavax;
  - • Low-moderate (Real world data, no publication of efficacy trial): CanSino, Sinovac & Covaxin
- 5-Israel, Chile, Bahrein, US & UK are the 5 leading countries as far as highest share of fully vaccinated population is concerned
- 10- Breakthrough infections observed with almost all vaccines. Most mild & moderate, deaths are also seen in fully vaccinated (out of 5800 breakthrough cases with mRNA vaccines in the US, 7% hospitalized & 74 died)
- 11-Most vaccines have comparatively lower efficacy in elderly & comorbidities than in younger and healthy people
- 12-Most gene-based vaccines (mRNA & Viral vector) have high reactogenicity profile.
- 13-Adenovirus vector-based vaccines (AZ & JNJ) have rare, serious adverse events called VITT (vaccine induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia). Incidence varies from 1 case in 40 000 to 1 in 100 000, but the benefits far outweigh than the risks
- 14. Efficacy against variants: Most vaccines have only very modest reductions in efficacy against UK’s B117 & Brazil’s P1 variants. Most vaccines have lower efficacy against South Africa’s B1351 variant (containing E484K mutation).
  - 15-AZ vaccine has got only 10% efficacy against B1351 variant, whereas JNJ (57%) & Novavax (49%) had major reductions in efficacy trials. Sputnik-V, Pfizer & Moderna vaccines have reduced neutralization against B1351.
  - 16-Pfizer vaccine has shown intact efficacy against B1351 in Qatar in real world evidence after 2 doses. Nevertheless, most leading vaccines are developing boosters with revised formulation to tackle B1351 variant.
- 17-So far, natural infection induced protection seems to be more lasting than vaccine induced, particularly in context with non-mRNA vaccines.
  - 18-Only 4 vaccine candidates elicited several folds higher titers of neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) than natural infection (NAbs titers measured in human convalescent serum): Pfizer, Moderna, Novavax & Sputnik-V.  However, natural immunity is much more broader.
  - 19- We know now that natural infection provides at least 8 months of protection. Whereas mRNA vaccines are found to provide protection at least for 6 months without any appreciable loss of efficacy. Other vaccines like inactivated & AZ vaccines may provide lesser duration of protection.
  - 20-Natural infection may provide resistance against immune evader variants also since there is immune responses against not only against S protein but against other antigens of the virus. Further, the variants do not have changes in T-cell epitopes.
  - 22. Those had natural infection can wait for THREE MONTHS for their Covid vaccine shot.
  - 23. In previously infected individuals with anti-spike IgG positive individuals, only ONE DOSE of mRNA vaccine is sufficient!
- 21. Most vaccines elicit both humoral and T cell immunity. However, viral vector vaccine, particularly AZ vaccine has got particularly good CD8 cell response which kill virus infected cell and ameliorate severity of disease.
- 28. Several vaccines are now conducting trials for use of Covid vaccines in pediatric population. Pfizer showed 100% efficacy in 12-15 yrs old, Moderna is doing trial in 6mo to 12 yrs (in US) & 5-11 yrs (in Canada), JNJ 12-17 yrs, Sinovac 3-11 yrs & Novavax 12-17 yrs. AZ has paused their trial in 6-17 yrs.


## Vaccine booster efficacy against Omircon
- From UKHSA data.
  
- Booster efficacy against symptomatic Covid drops to ZERO after 20 weeks?
- VE estimates for the booster dose are very similar, irrespective of the primary course received. VE is generally slightly higher in younger compared to older age groups. 
- AZ vaccine: 2 doses
  -VE starts at 45-50%
  -25 weeks later: Zero.
- Pfizer or Moderna: 2 doses
  -VE starts at 65 to 70%
  -25 weeks later: ~15%
- Booster of Pfizer or Moderna: 2-4 weeks later
  -AZ or Pfizer as primary:
  -VE: increases to 60-75%
  -20+ weeks later: No effect (VE: 0) 

- VE ag hospitalisation:
  -Among 18-64 year olds (using all Covid-19 cases admitted via emergency care): VE after a booster peaked at 82.4% & dropped to 53.6% by 15+ weeks after the booster.
- VE against mortality: (aged 50 years; all vaccines combined) 
  - At 25-plus weeks following the 2nd dose, VE was ~60% while at 2 or more weeks following a booster VE was 95% against mortality.
