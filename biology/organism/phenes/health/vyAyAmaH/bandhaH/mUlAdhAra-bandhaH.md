## Target
- perineum, which is the area between your anus and genitals. Your pelvic floor muscles support your bladder, bowels, and womb.

## क्रिया
- Kegels involve contracting the muscles at the center of the perineum and “lifting” the pelvic floor (while inhaling if synchronizing with breath). Hold for 3 seconds. Then exhale if synchronizing with breath.
- One way to get the feel for this exercise is to practice stopping your urine mid-flow.
