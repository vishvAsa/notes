Vegetarian sources of omega 3 fats: flaxseeds and flaxseed oil, walnuts,
hemp seeds, leafy green vegetables. Unfortunately, however, most
naturally occurring vegetarian sources of omega 3 fatty acids are not
very rich in DHA (a very important type of omega 3 fat). How much DHA is
recommended per day? 100-300mg/day \[Ref\]
