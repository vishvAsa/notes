## Freezing

Store all foods at 0 F or lower to retain vitamin content, color, flavor
and texture. Freezing preserves cooked food for long durations.

## Defrosting

Never defrost foods in a garage, basement, car, dishwasher or plastic
garbage bag; out on the kitchen counter, outdoors or on the porch. There
are three safe ways to defrost food: in the refrigerator, in cold water,
or in the microwave. \[Ref\] Refreezing:

It is safe to refreeze, provided you did not introduce or allow the
multiplication of bacteria during thawing. So, during thawing, it
shouldn’t have sat between 40°F–140°F (4°C–60°C) for more than two
hours. \[ Ref\] It is however safer to cook the food and then freeze it.

## Signs of cooking

There is almost always a change in color. Cooked vegetables are easier
to chew and cut. Cooked vegetables sometime change color slightly. White
matter may turn brownish. Cooked onion turns somewhat transparent but
brownish. Peas loose water - their skin becomes wrinkled.

Boiling generally means production of good sized bubbles even in the
middle of the liquid, and not just on the borders.

## Cooking X in pressure cooker with 1:N water with M whistles
Clean lid and gasket of the pressure cooker. In a container pour X and
water in 1:N ratio. Close lid with gasket. Turn on the flame. Wait for
steady steam to appear. Place the weight on the steam egress. Wait for
the cooker to whistle M times. If cooker does not whistle M times in a
period of 10 minutes after placing the weight, something might be wrong
- Turn off the flame at once. Turn off the flame, and let the cooker
cool down for 15 minutes. Remove weight.
