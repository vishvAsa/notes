      <description>T cells  Cytotoxic T cells recognize infected cell (by recognizing some antigen) and spur cell death.  Memory T cells Reignite during secondary exposure.
B cells When activated: Secrete antibodies.
 Neutralizing antibodies bind to a virus and ensure that they can&amp;rsquo;t bind to cell receptors. Non-neutralizing antibodies bind to antigens on surface of infected cells - detected by natural killer cells.  Plasma cells  Some B cells become plasma cells, which secrete antibodies for years.</description>
