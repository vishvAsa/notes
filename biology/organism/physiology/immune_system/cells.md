## Dendridic cells
- Major role in adaptive immunity. 
- Antigen-presenting cells (also known as accessory cells). Take infection to lymph nodes and activate T and B cells.

## T cells
- Cytotoxic T cells recognize infected cell (by recognizing some antigen) and spur cell death.

### Memory T cells
Reignite during secondary exposure.

## B cells
When activated: Secrete antibodies. 

- Neutralizing antibodies bind to a virus and ensure that they can't bind to cell receptors.
- Non-neutralizing antibodies bind to antigens on surface of infected cells - detected by natural killer cells.

### Plasma cells
- Some B cells become plasma cells, which secrete antibodies for years.

### Memory B cells
Can reignite antibodies during second exposure.

## Natural killer (NK) cells
Go where non-neutralizing antibodies from B cells have bound to antigens on surface of infected cells. Trigger apoptosis (cell death).
