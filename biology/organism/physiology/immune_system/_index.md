## Immunity types
### Innate
- Non specific, acts within minutes.
- Infection → pathogen recogintion → activation of cells and inflammation → removal of infectious agent

### Adaptive
- Long term, specific. Takes a week or two to get going. 
- Infection → Stimulation of T and B cells in lymphoid organs → Expansion and training of effector T and B cells → migration to infection site → removal of infectious agent
