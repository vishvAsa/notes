Based on similarity and dissimilarity of genomes, one can organize various species / classes of organisms into a tree.

## Species of cellular life
The top branches (superregna) are: archaea, bacteria and eukaryota (true nucleus). The prior two are called prokaryota (primitive - neucleus).

The top branches of Eukaryota (regna) include plants, animals, fungi and protista (amoeba and some other primitive classes of organisms).

A notable branch of animals include the phylum chordata - subphylum vertebrata. The subphylum vertebrata includes classes named mammals, fish, reptiles, birds, amphibians.
