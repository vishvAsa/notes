## Defining life
Life reproduces. Living organisms consume and transform energy. An organism will regulate its internal environment to maintain a stable and constant condition.

## Phenes
Organisms have traits, or phenes. The way phenes are expressed is influenced by the organism's hereditary information and by the environment. Phenome and phenotype are defined similar to genes and genotypes (described elsewhere).
