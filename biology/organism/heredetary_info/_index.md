## Heridity
Information which is responsible for the phenes of an organism is mostly hereditary. But, environmental factors do significantly influence the expression of this hereditary information.

## Information type
There are protein-coding regions, non protein coding RNA regions, regulatory sequences, introns, and noncoding DNA.


## Chemical encoding, expression
The most basic stage of expression of hereditary information is its chemical encoding. This happens in either the language of the DNA or the RNA.

### Genes
Information-segments encoded in the form of a DNA are sometimes copied into an RNA sequence, which are sometimes inturn copied into amino-acid sequences (proteins).

Protein-coding genes are arguably the most important part of the hereditary information - because changes here can easily lead to markedly varied phenes.

#### Genome, genotype
The set of all genes in an organism, or a species is a genome. A genotype is a form of a particular gene which distinguishes an individual.

#### Gene expression
This is affected by many environmental factors (Epigenetics).

### Variation
#### Types
Types of variations include point mutations, recombinations, insertions, deletions in copy stored using the DNA.

#### Source
These variations could be the result of copying errors during reproduction, intermixing of DNA during reproduction, damage to DNA due to radiation or chemicals, gene insertions/ transfers via viruses.

## Variation
The genes and phenes of organisms vary. These variations arise due to environmental processes such as radiation, chemicals, infection etc..

### Homology
Homologous genes/ phenes are similar genes/ phenes occurring in different species. If the homology arose due to a speciation event, it is called orthology.

## Human genome
There are 23 pairs of chromosomes in a diploid cell, with over $3*10^9$ base pairs and $\approx 23000$ protein coding genes.
