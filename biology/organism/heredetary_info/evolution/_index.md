## Origin and equilibria
New species of living organisms and the inherited traits which distinguish them are usually the product of the process of the arising of variation in traits, followed by selection of what (groups of) traits survive in competition with others for resources necessary for the organism's life. The arising of variation and the selection process may be natural or artificial.

Traits are passed on across generations by the means of programs which are recorded when an offspring is created.

### Natural selection
Natural selection favors the survival of the fittest: a tautology, since 'fittest' is defined in terms of ability to survive and transmit the high-fitness characteristics.
