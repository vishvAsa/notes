      <description>Plant cells have organelles called platelets which enable photosynthesis of food.
Predation Catching food Predators may be mostly static, lying in wait for prey to come to them. Or, they may actively move and entrap or chase down food.
Baiting Predators may attract food organisms to a certain location for entrapment. Eg: brightly colored flowers of the venus fly trap, the attractive tail of the rattle-snake.
Overcoming a single prey A prey is usually overcome using asphyxiation, bleeding, cutting, crushing or poison.</description>

      <description>Here, rather than considering reproduction of cells in the body of a multicellular animal, we are concerned with production of entire new generations of organisms.
Sexual vs asexual Reproduction can be sexual or asexual. Some organisms are capable of both - they are aka hermaphrodites.
Sexual reproduction Combination of genes Sexual reproduction involves combination of genetic material from multiple (usually 2) organisms to produce genetic material for the next generation. Usually these parent organisms are of the same species.</description>
