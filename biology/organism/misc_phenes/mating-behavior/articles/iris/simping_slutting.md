Attention is to women what sex is to men. A woman who receives a lot of attention but doesn't sleep around is akin to a man who sleeps around but barely invests. Both are winners, so to speak. Men who give away attention freely and women who sleep around freely are losers.

This is why men are repulsed by sluts and women are repulsed by simps. Simps and sluts exhibit low-value behaviour. They will happily take advantage of them though, but will never respect them.
