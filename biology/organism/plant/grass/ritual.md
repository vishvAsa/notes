- Visit the ICAR - Horticultural Research Institute. As a special gesture they allow Dvijas with kachcham (only on amAvAsya with mAgha star?), entry reportedly allowed before 2PM. They give a badge. Once you are in you need to get to the back side of the institute where the farms are located. Just drive long enough and you will get places where darbha is found. Ground staff are very helpful.
