## Comparison to computer
It is easy to think of the mind in relation to the body as being analogous to software being in relation to a computer. The state of a computer is ever changing - yes; and we can refer to specific things when necessary. Eg: "program X is running inside the computer, so it is presenting this output".

## Behaviorism
### Academic history
This was a reaction to focus on internal states and feelings rather than environmental stimuli in western study of human psyche and behavior. Major proponents: Skinner, perhaps Pavlov.

### Basic scenario
An agent is placed in an environment. Its actions are called operants, and the environment may respond with a reinforcer/ stimulus.

### Avoidance of mentalist explanations
They fastidiously avoid mentalist explanations for behavior. Unlike cognitive psychologists, they try not to postulate 'software/ circuits in the brain' which may be responsible for a certain behavior.

#### Redefining emotion
The behaviorist redifinition of emotion as the distribution over behavior is considered elsewhere.

They don't say 'X made him angry. He was angry so he hit the door.', but instead say 'X made him angry: hitting the door indicates that he is angry'.

### Control and prediction
Their methodology relied mostly on single animal research. One focus was on 'control'/ training of behavior using environmental feedback. Self-control techniques use the same strategies. They did many experiments in reinforcement learning, they were able to train animals to do complex tasks etc..

### Methodology
Peoples' reporting of emotions was considered unreliable - but this attitude predates technological advances like fMRI.

Skinner's methodological prescriptions -- single animal research, avoidance of the use of statistics, avoidance of inferred entities, to mention a few are tightly followed.
