## Intraspecies
> Concerning our closest living relatives, the great apes, intraspecific killing has frequently been reported across multiple chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes) communities e.g.,5,6,7 and gorilla (Gorilla gorilla)8,9,10 groups. However, it is nearly absent in bonobos (Pan paniscus) (but see11) and orangutans (Pongo ssp.)12. 

### Chimpanzee
> Rates of intraspecific killings vary considerably among chimpanzee communities, with adult males being both the main attackers and the main victims11. The majority of killings involve intercommunity rather than intracommunity attacks, and most often are made by coalitions of males during territorial boundary patrols5,13. During these patrols, chimpanzees travel to the periphery of the territory to search for signs of members of other communities or may even make deep incursions into neighbouring communities involving lethal coalitionary attacks13,14,15,15. The latter has been associated with fission–fusion social systems and has spurred considerable research attention, suggesting functional parallels and evolutionary continuities between chimpanzee violence and lethal intergroup raiding in humans6,16,17.

### Gorilla
> In contrast, intraspecific killings in gorillas have almost exclusively been observed in intergroup encounters10,18 (but see9). Gorillas (genus Gorilla) are as genetically distant from chimpanzees (genus Pan) as they are from humans (genus Homo), and are thought to have separated from a shared ancestor around eight million years ago19. Across their geographic range, gorillas live in cohesive social groups consisting of one or more adult males, adult females, and their offspring8,20,21,22. Unlike chimpanzees, the home ranges of neighbouring gorilla groups overlap greatly, but intergroup encounters also range from non-agonistic affiliative encounters to coalitionary agonistic interactions involving physical violence, infanticide8,9,10 and occasionally even fatal injuries18,23,24,25 to adult males.


## Interspecies
### Bonobos
> Concerning great apes, interspecific violence in the form of predation and hunting has been observed in bonobos34,35 and chimpanzees e.g.,36,37. In bonobos, both sexes engage in pursuing and hunting34,35,37, and hunts are individualistic and opportunistic (i.e. they do not involve previous searching or tracking behaviour35).

### Chimpanzee
#### Hunting
> hunting in chimpanzees is predominantly a male activity38,39,40, and cooperative hunting has been observed at some sites41. Although hunting is often opportunistic37, chimpanzees at Taï, Taï National Park, Cote D’Ivoire41 and Ngogo, Kibale National Park, Uganda38,42 have been observed to search actively for prey and listen for distinct vocalizations. Chimpanzees prey upon a broad variety of taxa including birds, insects, non-primate mammals, monkeys, and reptiles e.g.,13,40,41,42,43, with prey preferences differing between chimpanzee populations based on local availability37,44,45.
> 
> ... the chimpanzees showed conspicuous behaviours prior to hunting such as being extremely attentive to any arboreal movements, scanning, changing directions several times without vocalizing, and performing specific call types—hunting calls. Post-hunting behaviour is characterized by the prevalence of high-ranking males as the primary prey possessors and consumers, high levels of attention, arousal and excitement of party members, as well as begging and food sharing.

#### On Gorillas
>  two lethal coalitionary attacks of chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes troglodytes) on another hominid species, western lowland gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla), that occur sympatrically in the Loango National Park in Gabon. In both events, the chimpanzees significantly outnumbered the gorillas and victims were infant gorillas. 
> 
> ... the behaviours observed during the two events were very different to those reported during hunting: The chimpanzees were noisy, emitted alarm barks and screams and performed displays long before the infants were killed. The excitement levels dropped immediately following the death of the infant gorillas. In addition, the observed feeding behaviours during the two events also differed from patterns expected during conventional hunting for the purpose of gaining nutritional benefits through the consumption of prey.
