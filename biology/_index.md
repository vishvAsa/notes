## Themes
Empirical study of different organisms. How does the machinery of life work? How do animals interact with their environment?

Computational biology is considered elsewhere.

## Research approach
It is mainly an observational discipline. Predictive aspects are gaining prominance: what things (Eg: genes) to observe to learn more about something?

Based on observation, scientists model the mechanism behind the\\ phenomenon. This can involve sophisticated mathematics, chemistry, physics etc..
