The passing away of Mr. Bappi Lahri due to Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) has brought back the limelight to this widely prevalent yet under recognised disease entity. But what exactly is OSA? & How to find out if you have OSA? 

OSA is a disorder caused by the repetitive collapse of the upper airway during sleep due to the relaxation of the muscles supporting the soft tissues in your throat, such as your tongue and soft palate. 

## Diagnosis
In medicine we use a STOP BANG scoring system to screen you for OSA.

- S - Do you SNORE while you sleep? 
- T - Are you TIRED on waking up or for most part of your day? (This happens because patients of OSA have a very unrefreshing sleep)
- O - Has anyone OBSERVED you having choking spells while you were asleep?
- P - Do you have high blood PRESSURE?
- B - Is your BMI (Body Mass Index) >35?
- A - Is your AGE >50 years?
- N - Is your NECK circumference >40 cms?
- G - Is your GENDER a male or are you a post menopausal woman? If your answer to >5 of the above listed 8 questions is a YES, how are on a high risk for having OSA!

How do I get tested for OSA? 

OSA is diagnosed via a Sleep Study where we monitor different parameters of your body while you sleep and find out if there is a collapse of your upper airway while you sleep and what effects is it causing to different organs of your body.

## Cure
Is OSA curable? 

Yes! Lifestyle modifications specially weight reduction go a long way in helping you alleviate from your symptoms of OSA. You may also need assisted ventilation in the form of a BiPaP machine. (Visit your somnologist for a personalized treatment plan).
