> §1. The Buddha and the Vedic Rishis
>
>  1. The Vedas are a collection of Mantras, i.e., hymns or chants.
> The reciters of these hymns are called Rishis.  
>  2. The Mantras are mere invocations to deities such as Indra,
> Varuna, Agni, Soma, Isana, Prajapati, Bramba, Mahiddhi, Yama and
> others.  
>  3. The invocations are mere prayers for help against enemies, for
> gift of wealth, for accepting the offerings of food, flesh and wine
> from the devotee.  
>  4. There is not much philosophy in the Vedas. But there were some
> Vedic sages who had entered into speculations of a philosophical
> nature.  
>  5. These Vedic sages were: (1) Aghamarsana; (2) Prajapati
> Parmesthin; (3) Brahmanaspati, otherwise known as Brihaspati; (4)
> Anila; (5) Dirghatamas; (6) Narayan; (7) Hiranyagarbha; and (8)
> Visvakarman.  
>  6. The main problems of these Vedic philosophers were: How did the
> world originate? In what manner were individual things created? Why
> have they their unity and existence? Who created, and who ordained?
> From what did the world spring up, and to what again will it return
> ?  
>  7. *Aghamarsana* said that the world was created out of Tapas
> (heat). Tapas was the creative principle from which eternal law and
> truth were born. From these were produced the night (tamas). Tamas
> produced water, and from water originated time. Time gave birth to the
> sun and the moon, the heaven and the earth, the firmament and light,
> and ordained the days and nights.  
>  8. *Brahmanaspati* postulated the genesis of being from non-being.
> By the term non-existence, he denoted apparently the infinite. The
> existent originally sprang up from the non-existent. The non-existent
> (asat, nonens) was the permanent foundation of all that is existent
> (sat, ens) and of all that is possible and yet non-existent (asat).  
>  9. *Prajapati Parmesthin* started with the problem: "Did being
> come out of non-being?" His view was that this was an irrelevant
> question. For him water was the original substance of that which
> exists. For him the original matter--water--came neither under the
> definition of being nor under that of non-being.  
>  10. *Paramesthin* did not draw any distinction between matter and
> motive power. According to him, water transformed itself into
> particular things by some inherent principle to which he gave the name
> Kama, Cosmic Desire.  
>  11. *Anila* was another Vedic Philosopher. To him the principal
> element was air (vayu). It possesses the inherent capacity for
> movement. It is endowed with the generating principle.  
>  12. *Dirghtamas* maintained that all living beings rest and depend
> ultimately on the sun. The sun, held up and propelled by its inherent
> force, went backward and forward.  
>  13. The sun is composed of a grey-coloured substance, and so are
> lightning and fire.  
>  14. The sun, lightning, and fire formed the germ of water. Water
> forms the germ of plants. Such were the views of Dirghatamas.  
>  15. According to *Narayana*, Purusha (God) is the first cause of
> the universe. It is from Purusha that the sun, the moon, the earth,
> water, fire, air, mid-air, the sky, the regions, the seasons, the
> creatures of the air, all animals, all classes of men, and all human
> institutions, had originated.  
>  16. *Hiranyagarbha*. From \[a\] doctrinal point of view he stood
> midway between Parmeshthin and Narayan. Hiranyagarbha means the golden
> germ. It was the great power of the universe, from which all other
> powers and existences, divine and earthly, were derived.  
>  17. *Hiranyagarbha* means \[=refers to\] fire. It is fire that
> constituted the solar essence, the generating principle of the
> universe.  
>  18. From the point of view of *Vishvakarman*, it was quite
> inadequate and unsatisfactory to hold that water was the primitive
> substance of all that is, and then to derive from it this world as a
> whole by giving it an inherent power of movement. If water be the
> primitive substance which is endowed with the inherent principle of
> change, we have yet to account for that from which water derived its
> being, and derived the motive power, the generating principle, the
> elemental forces, the laws and all the rest.  
>  19. *Vishvakarman* held the view that it was God which was the
> motive power. God is first and God is last. He is earlier than the
> visible universe; he had existed before all cosmic forces came into
> being. He is the sole God who created and ordained this universe. God
> is one, and the only one. He is the unborn one (aja) in whom all the
> existing things abide. He is the one who is mighty in mind and supreme
> in power. He is the maker--the disposer. As father he generated us,
> and as disposer he knows the fate of all that is.  
>  20. The Buddha did not regard all the Vedic Sages as worthy of
> reverence. He regarded just ten Vedic Rishis as the most ancient, and
> as the real authors of the Mantras.  
>  21. But in the Mantras he saw nothing that was morally
> elevating.  
>  22. In his view the Vedas were as worthless as a desert.  
>  23. The Buddha, therefore, discarded the Mantras as a source from
> which to learn or to borrow.  
>  24. Similarly, the Buddha did not find anything in the philosophy
> of the Vedic Rishis. They were groping to reach the truth. But they
> had not reached it.  
>  25. Their theories were mere speculations, not based on logic nor
> on facts. Their contributions to philosophy created no social
> values.  
>  26. He therefore rejected the philosophy of the Vedic Rishis as
> useless.
>
>   
> §2. Kapila— The Philosopher
>
>  1. Among the ancient philosophers of India, the most pre-eminent
> was Kapila.  
>  2. His philosophical approach was unique, and as philosopher he
> stood in a class by himself. His philosophy was known as the Sankhya
> Philosophy.  
>  3. The tenets of his philosophy were of a startling nature.  
>  4. Truth must be supported by proof. This is the first tenet of
> the Sankhya system. There is no truth without proof.  
>  5. For purposes of proving the truth, Kapila allowed only two
> means of proof--(1) perception, and (2) inference.  
>  6. By perception is meant mental apprehension of a present
> object.  
>  7. Inference is threefold: (1) from cause to effect, as from the
> presence of clouds to rain; (2) from effect to cause, as from the
> swelling of the streams in the valleys to rain in the hills; and (3)
> by analogy, as when we infer from the fact that a man alters his place
> when he moves that the stars must also move, since they appear in
> different places.  
>  8. His next tenet related to causality--creation and its cause.  
>  9. Kapila denied the theory that there was a being who created the
> universe. In his view a created thing really exists beforehand in its
> cause, just as the clay serves to form a pot, or the threads go to
> form a piece of cloth.  
>  10. This is the first ground on which Kapila rejected the theory
> that the universe was created by a being.  
>  11. But there are other grounds which he advanced in support of
> his point of view.  
>  12. The non-existent cannot be the subject of an activity; there
> is no new creation. The product is really nothing else than the
> material of which it is composed: the product exists before its coming
> into being ,in the shape of its material of which it is composed. Only
> a definite product can be produced from such material; and only a
> specific material can yield a specific result.  
>  13. What then is the source of the empirical universe?  
>  14. Kapila said the empirical universe consists of things evolved
> (Vyakta) and things that are not evolved (Avyakta).  
>  15. Individual things (Vyakta Vastu) cannot be the source of
> unevolved things (Avyakta Vastu).  
>  16. Individual things are all limited in magnitude, and this is
> incompatible with the nature of the source of the universe.  
>  17. All individual things are analogous one to another, and
> therefore no one \[of them\] can be regarded as the final source of
> the other. Moreover, as they all come into being from a source, they
> cannot constitute that source.  
>  18. Further, argued Kapila, an effect must differ from its cause,
> though it must consist of the cause. That being so, the universe
> cannot itself be the final cause. It must be the product of some
> ultimate cause.  
>  19. When asked why the unevolved cannot be perceived, why does it
> not show movement which would make it perceivable, Kapila replied:  
>  20. "It may be due to various causes. It may be that its fine
> nature makes, it imperceptible, just as other things of whose
> existence there is no doubt, cannot be perceived; or because of their
> too great a distance or proximity; or through the intervention of a
> third object; or through admixture with similar matter; or through the
> presence of some more powerful sensation; or the blindness or other
> defect of the senses or the mind of the observer."  
>  21. When asked, "What then is the source of the universe? What
> makes the difference between the evolved and unevolved part of the
> universe?  
>  22. Kapila's reply was: "Things that have evolved have a cause,
> and the things that have not evolved have also a cause. But the source
> of both is uncaused and independent.  
>  23. "The things that have evolved are many in number, and limited
> in space and name. The source is one, eternal and all-pervasive. The
> things evolved have activities and parts; the source is imminent in
> all, but has neither activities nor parts."  
>  24. Kapila argued that the process of development of the unevolved
> is through the activities of three constituents of which it is made
> up, Sattva, Rajas, and Tamas. These are called three Gunas.  
>  25. The first of the constituents, or factors, corresponds to what
> we call as light in nature, which reveals, which causes pleasure to
> men; the second is that \[=what\] impels and moves, what produces
> activity; the third is what is heavy and puts under restraint, what
> produces the state of indifference or inactivity.  
>  26. The three constituents act essentially in close relation; they
> overpower and support one another, and intermingle with one another.
> They are like the constituents of a lamp, the flame, the oil, and
> wick.  
>  27. When the three Gunas are in perfect balance, none overpowering
> the other, the universe appears static (Achetan) and ceases to
> evolve.  
>  28. When the three Gunas are not in balance, one overpowers the
> other, the universe becomes dynamic (sachetan), and evolution
> begins.  
>  29. Asked why the Gunas become unbalanced, the answer which Kapila
> gave was \[that\] this disturbance in the balance of the three Gunas
> was due to the presence of Dukha (suffering).  
>  30. Such were the tenets of Kapila's philosophy.  
>  31. Of all the philosophers, the Buddha was greatly impressed by
> the doctrines of Kapila.  
>  32. He was the only philosopher whose teachings appeared to the
> Buddha to be based on logic and facts.  
>  33. But he did not accept everything which Kapila taught. Only
> three things did the Buddha accept from Kapila.  
>  34. He accepted that reality must rest on proof. Thinking must be
> based on rationalism.  
>  35. He accepted that there was no logical or factual basis for the
> presumption that God exists or that he created the universe.  
>  36. He accepted that there was Dukha (suffering) in the world.  
>  37. The rest of Kapila's teachings he just bypassed as being
> irrelevant for his purpose.
>
>   
> § 3. The **Bramhana**s
>
>  1. Next to the Vedas are the religious books known as the
> Bramhanas. Both were held as sacred books. Indeed the Bramhanas are a
> part of the Vedas. The two went together and were called by a common
> name, Sruti.  
>  2. There were four theses on which the Bramhanic Philosophy
> rested.  
>  3. The first thesis was that the Vedas are not only sacred, but
> that they are infallible, and they are not to be questioned.  
>  4. The second thesis of the Bramhanic Philosophy was that
> salvation of the soul--that is escape from transmigration--can be had
> only by the due performance of Vedic sacrifices, and observances of
> religious rites and ceremonies, and the offering of gifts to
> Brahmins.  
>  5. The Brahmins had not only a theory of an ideal religion as
> contained in the **Veda**s, but they also had a theory for an ideal
> society.  
>  6. The pattern of this ideal society they named *Chaturvarna*. It
> is imbedded in the **Veda**s, and as the **Veda**s are infallible, and
> as their authority cannot be questioned, so also Chaturvarna as a
> pattern of society was binding and unquestionable.  
>  7. This pattern of society was based upon certain rules.  
>  8. The first rule was that society should be divided into four
> classes: (1) Brahmins; (2) Kshatriyas; (3) Vaishyas; and (4)
> Shudras.  
>  9. The second rule was that there cannot be social equality among
> these four classes. They must be bound together by the rule of graded
> inequality.  
>  10. The Brahmins to be at the top, the Kshatriyas to be kept below
> the Brahmins but above the Vaishyas, the Vaishyas to be below the
> Kshatriyas but above the Shudras, and the Shudras to be the lowest of
> all.  
>  11. These four classes were not to be equal to one another in the
> matter of rights and privileges. The rule of graded inequality
> governed the question of rights and privileges.  
>  12. The Brahmin had all the rights and privileges which he wished
> to claim. But a Kshatriya could not claim the rights and privileges
> which a Brahmin could. He had more rights and privileges than a
> Vaishya could claim. The Vaishya had more rights and privileges than a
> Shudra. But he could not claim the rights and privileges which a
> Kshatriya could. And the Shudra was not entitled to any right, much
> less any privilege. His privilege was to subsist without offending the
> three superior classes.  
>  13. The third rule of Chaturvarna related to the division of
> occupations. The occupation of the Brahmin was learning and teaching
> and the performance of religious observances. The occupations of the
> Kshatriya was fighting. Trade was assigned to the Vaishyas. The
> occupations of the Shudras was service of the three superior classes.
> These occupations assigned to different classes were exclusive. One
> class could not trespass upon the occupation of the other.  
>  14. The fourth rule of Chaturvarna related to the right to
> education. The pattern of Chaturvarna gave the right to education to
> the first three classes, the Brahmins, Kshatriyas and Vaishyas. The
> Shudras were denied the right to education. This rule of Chaturvarna
> did not deny the right to education to the Shudras only. It denied the
> right to education to all women, including those belonging to the
> class of Brahmins, Kshatriyas and Vaishyas.  
>  15. There was a fifth rule. According to it, man's life was
> divided into four stages. The first stage was called *Bramhacharya*;
> the second stage was called *Grahastashram*; the third stage was
> called *Vanaprasta* and the fourth stage was called *Sannyasa*.  
>  16. The object of the first stage was study and education. The
> object of the second stage was to live a married life. The object of
> the third stage was to familiarise a man with the life of a hermit,
> i.e., severing family ties, but without deserting his home. The object
> of the fourth stage was to enable a man to go in search of God and
> seek union with him.  
>  17. The benefits of these stages were open only to the male
> members of the three superior classes. The first stage was not open to
> the Shudras and women. Equally the last stage was not open to the
> Shudras and women.  
>  18. Such was the divine pattern of an ideal society called
> Chaturvarna. The Brahmins had idealised the rule and had realised the
> ideal without leaving any cracks or loopholes.  
>  19. The fourth thesis of Brahmanic Philosophy was the doctrine of
> Karma. It was part of the thesis of transmigration of the soul. The
> Karma of the Brahmins was an answer to the question, "Where did the
> soul land on transmigration with his new body on new birth?" The
> answer of the Brahmanic Philosophy was that it depended on a man's
> deeds in his past life. In other words, it depended on his Karma.  
>  20. The Buddha was strongly opposed to the first tenet of
> Brahmanism. He repudiated their thesis that the **Veda**s are
> infallible and their authority could never be questioned.  
>  21. In his opinion, nothing was infallible and nothing could be
> final. Everything must be open to re-examination and reconsideration,
> whenever grounds for re-examination and reconsideration arise.  
>  22. Man must know the truth--and real truth. To him freedom of
> thought was the most essential thing. And he was sure that freedom of
> thought was the only way to the discovery of truth.  
>  23. Infallibility of the Vedas meant complete denial of freedom of
> thought.  
>  24. For these reasons this thesis of the Brahmanic Philosophy was
> most obnoxious to him.  
>  25. He was equally an opponent of the second thesis of the
> Brahmanic Philosophy. The Buddha did admit that there was any
> \[=some\] virtue in a sacrifice. But he made a distinction between
> true sacrifice and false sacrifice.  
>  26. Sacrifice in the sense of self-denial for the good of others,
> he called true sacrifice. Sacrifice in the sense of killing an animal
> as an offering to God for personal benefit, he regarded as a false
> sacrifice.  
>  27. The Brahmanic sacrifices were mostly sacrifices of animals to
> please their gods. He condemned them as false sacrifices. He would not
> allow them, even though they be performed with the object of getting
> salvation for the soul.  
>  28. The opponents of sacrifices used to ridicule the Brahmins by
> saying, "If one can go to heaven by sacrificing an animal, why should
> not one sacrifice one's own father? That would be a quicker way of
> going to heaven."  
>  29. The Buddha wholeheartedly agreed with this view.  
>  30. The theory of Chaturvarna was as repugnant to the Buddha as
> the theory of sacrifices was repulsive to him.  
>  31. The organization of society set up by Brahmanism in the name
> of Chaturvarna did not appear to him a natural organization. Its class
> composition was compulsory and arbitrary. It was a society made to
> order. He preferred an open society and a free society.  
>  32. The Chaturvarna of the Brahmins was a fixed order never to be
> changed. Once a Brahmin always a Brahmin. Once a Kshatriya always a
> Kshatriya, once a Vaishya always a Vaishya, and once a Shudra always a
> Shudra. Society was based on status conferred upon an individual by
> the accident of his birth. Vice, however heinous, was no ground for
> degrading a man from his status, and virtue, however great, had no
> value \[=ability\] to raise him above it. There was no room for worth,
> nor for growth.  
>  33. Inequality exists in every society. But it was different with
> Brahmanism. The inequality preached by Brahmins was its official
> doctrine. It was not a mere growth. Brahmanism did not believe in
> equality. In fact, it was opposed to equality.  
>  34. Brahmanism was not content with inequality. The soul of
> Brahmanism lay in graded inequality.  
>  35. Far from producing harmony, graded inequality, the Buddha
> thought, might produce in society an ascending scale of hatred and a
> descending scale of contempt, and might be a source of perpetual
> conflict.  
>  36. The occupations of the four classes were also fixed. There was
> no freedom of choice. Besides, they were fixed not in accordance with
> skill, but in accordance with birth.  
>  37. On a careful review of the rules of Chaturvarna, the Buddha
> had no difficulty in coming to the conclusion that the philosophic
> foundations on which the social order was reared by Brahmanism were
> wrong if not selfish.  
>  38. It was clear to him that it did not serve the interests of
> all, much less did it advance the welfare of all. Indeed, it was
> deliberately designed to make \[the\] many serve the interests of the
> few. In it man was made to serve a class of self-styled supermen.  
>  39. It was calculated to suppress and exploit the weak, and to
> keep them in a state of complete subjugation.  
>  40. The law of Karma as formulated by the Brahmins, thought the
> Buddha, was calculated to sap the spirit of revolt completely. No one
> was responsible for the suffering of man except he himself. Revolt
> could not alter the state of suffering ; for suffering was fixed by
> his past Karma as his lot in this life.  
>  41. The Shudras and women--the two classes whose humanity was most
> mutilated by Brahmanism--had no power to rebel against the system.  
>  42. They were denied the right to knowledge, with the result that
> by reason of their enforced ignorance they could not realize what had
> made their condition so degraded. They could not know that Brahmanism
> had robbed them completely of the significance of their life. Instead
> of rebelling against Brahmanism, they had become the devotees and
> upholders of Brahmanism.  
>  43. The right to bear arms is the ultimate means of achieving
> freedom which a human being has. But the Shudras were denied the right
> to bear arms.  
>  44. Under Brahmanism the Shudras were left as helpless victims of
> a conspiracy of selfish Brahmanism, powerful and deadly Kshatriyas,
> and wealthy Vaishyas.  
>  45. Could it be amended? Knowing that it was a divinely ordained
> social order, he knew that it could not be. It could only be ended.  
>  46. For these reasons the Buddha rejected Brahmanism as being
> opposed to the true way of life.
>
>   
> §4. The Upanishads and Their Teachings
>
>  1. The Upanishads constituted another piece of literature. It is
> not part of the Vedas. It is uncanonical.  
>  2. All the same, they did form a part of religious literature.  
>  3. The number of the Upanishads is quite large. Some important,
> some quite unimportant.  
>  4. Some of them were ranged against the Vedic theologians, the
> Brahmin priests.  
>  5. All of them agreed in viewing Vedic study as a study of
> nescience or ignorance (avidya).  
>  6. They were all agreed in their estimate of the four Vedas and
> the Vedic science as the lower knowledge.  
>  7. They were all agreed in questioning the divine origin of the
> Vedas.  
>  8. They were all agreed in denying the efficacy attributed to
> sacrifices, to the funeral oblations, and the gifts to the priests
> which are the fundamentals of the Brahmanic philosophy.  
>  9. This, however, was not the main topic with which the Upanishads
> were concerned. Their discussions centred round Brahman and Atman.  
>  10. Brahman was the all-pervading principle which binds the
> universe, and \[they maintained\] that salvation lay in the Atman
> realizing that it is Brahman.  
>  11. The main thesis of the Upanishads was that *Brahmana* was a
> reality and that *Atmana* was the same as *Brahmana*. The *Atmana* did
> not realize that it was *Brahmana* because of the *Upadhi*s in which
> it was entangled.  
>  12. The question was, Is Brahmana a reality? The acceptance of the
> Upanishadic thesis depended upon the answer to this question.  
>  13. The Buddha could find no proof in support of the thesis that
> *Brahmana* was a reality. He, therefore, rejected the thesis of the
> Upanishads.  
>  14. It is not that questions on this issue were not put to the
> authors of the Upanishads. They were.  
>  15. Such questions were put to no less a person than Yajnavalkya,
> a great seer who plays so important a part in the Brahadarnyka
> Upanishad.  
>  16. He was asked, "What is Brahmana? What is Atmana " All that
> Yajnavalkya could say, "Neti! Neti! I know not! I know not! "  
>  17. "How can anything be a reality about which no one knows
> anything?" asked the Buddha. He had, therefore, no difficulty in
> rejecting the Upanishadic thesis as being based on pure imagination.
