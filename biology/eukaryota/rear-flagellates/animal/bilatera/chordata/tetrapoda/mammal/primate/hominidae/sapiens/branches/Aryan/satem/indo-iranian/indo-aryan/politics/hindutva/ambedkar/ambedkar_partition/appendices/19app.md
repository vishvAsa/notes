**Supplementary Communal Award[/1/](#n01)**

  

"Then there was the question of the representation of communities in the
Centre, particularly of the Muslim community. There, I think, I can say
definitely÷1 think I have said it indirectly very often before ÷ that
the Government consider that the Muslim community should have a
representation 33 1/3 percent in the Federal Centre. As far as Indian
India is concerned that must be a matter for arrangement between the
communities affected and the princes, but, so far as the British
Government has any part in the question we will, at any time, give our
good offices to making it as easy as possible for the arrangement
between those parties with regard to the future allocation of seats."  


=====================

**[/1/](#m01)** The Communal Award of His Majesty's Government
([Appendix XVIII](18app.html)) did not give any decision regarding the
Muslim claim for 33 1/3 percent representation in the Central
Government. The decision of His Majesty's Government on this claim was
announced by the Secretary of State for India on 24th December 1932 in
the course of his statement to the Third Round Table Conference.
