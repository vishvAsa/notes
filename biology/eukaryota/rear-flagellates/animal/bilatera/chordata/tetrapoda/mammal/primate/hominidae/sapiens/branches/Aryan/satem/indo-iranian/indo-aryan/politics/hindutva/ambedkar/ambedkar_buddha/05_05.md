> § 1. Vinaya for the Wealthy
>
> (1.i)
>
>  1. The Blessed Lord did not elevate poverty by calling it a
> blessed state of life.  
>  2. Nor did he tell the poor that they may remain content, for they
> will inherit the earth.  
>  3. On the contrary: he said riches are welcome. What he insisted
> upon is that the acquisition of riches must be subject to Vinaya.
>
> (1.ii)
>
>  1. Once Anathapindika came to where the Exalted One was. Having
> come, he made obeisance to the Exalted One, and took a seat at one
> side, and asked, "Will the Enlightened One tell what things are
> welcome, pleasant, agreeable, to the householder, but which are hard
> to gain?"  
>  2. The Enlightened One, having heard the question put to him,
> said, "Of such things the first is to acquire wealth lawfully.  
>  3. "The second is to see that your relations also get their wealth
> lawfully.  
>  4. "The third is to live long and reach great age.  
>  5. "'For a true householder for the attainment of these three
> things, which in the world are welcome, pleasant, agreeable, but hard
> to gain, there are also four conditions precedent. They are the
> blessing of faith, the blessing of virtuous conduct, the blessing of
> liberality, and the blessing of wisdom.  
>  6. "The blessing of faith and belief consist in the supreme
> knowledge of the Tathagata which teaches, 'This is He, the Exalted
> One, the Holy One, the Supremely Awakened One, the perfect in
> Knowledge and in Conduct, the Auspicious, the Knower of all the
> worlds, the Incomparable Trainer of men, the Teacher of Devas and
> men.'  
>  7. "The blessing of virtuous conduct which abstains from taking
> life, thieving, unchastity, lying, and partaking of fermented
> liquor.  
>  8. "The blessing of liberality consists in the householder living
> with mind freed from the taint of avarice, generous, open-handed,
> delighting in gifts, a good one to be asked, and devoted to the
> distribution of gifts.  
>  9. "Wherein consists the blessing of wisdom? Ye know that a
> householder who dwells with mind overcome by greed, avarice, ill-will,
> sloth, drowsiness, distraction, and flurry, commits wrongful deeds,
> and neglects that which ought to be done, and by so doing is deprived
> of happiness and honour.  
>  10. "Greed, avarice, ill-will; sloth and drowsiness; distraction,
> and flurry and doubt, are stains of the mind. A householder who gets
> rid of such stains of the mind acquires great wisdom, abundant wisdom,
> clear vision, and perfect wisdom.  
>  11. "Thus to acquire wealth legitimately and justly, earned by
> great industry, amassed by strength of the arm, and gained by sweat
> (of the brow), is a great blessing. The householder makes himself
> happy and cheerful, and preserves himself full of happiness; also make
> parents, wife and children, servants and labourers, friends and
> companions, happy and cheerful, and preserves them full of happiness."
>
>   
> § 2. Vinaya for the Householder
>
>  On this matter the Buddha's thoughts are embodied in his discourse
> with Sigala.  
>  1. At one time the Exalted One was in the Squirrels'
> Feeding-ground in Velu Vana, in Rajagraha.  
>  2. Now at this time young Sigala, a householder's son, rising
> betimes, went forth from Rajagraha, and with wet hair and wet garments
> and clasped hands uplifted, paid worship to the several quarters of
> earth and sky--to the east, south, west, and north, to the nadir and
> the zenith.  
>  3. And the Exalted One early that morning dressed himself, took
> his bowl and robe, and entered Rajagraha seeking alms. He saw young
> Sigala worshipping and asked him, "Why do you worship the several
> quarters of earth and sky?"  
>  4. "My father, when he was dying, said to me, 'Dear son, you
> should worship the quarters of earth and sky. So I, sir, honouring my
> father's word, worship in this wise.'"  
>  5. "But how can this be the true religion of a man of the world? "
> asked the Blessed One. "What else can be the religion of man?" replied
> Sigala. "If there is, it would be an excellent thing if the Exalted
> One would tell me what it is."  
>  6. "Hear then, young householder, give ear to my words, and I will
> tell you what it is." "So be it, Sir," responded young Sigala. And the
> Exalted One said:  
>  7. "A religion, to be a religion of man, must teach him to shun
> bad conduct. The destruction of life, the taking of what is not given,
> licentiousness, and lying speech, are the four vices of conduct which
> he must avoid.  
>  8. "Know ye, Sigala, evil deeds are done from motives of
> partiality, enmity, stupidity, and fear. If he is not led away by
> these motives, he will do no evil deed.  
>  9. "A religion, to be religion of man, must teach him not to
> dissipate his wealth. Dissipation of wealth results from being
> addicted to intoxicating liquors, frequenting the streets at unseemly
> hours, haunting fairs, being infatuated by gambling, associating with
> evil companions, the habit of idleness.  
>  10. "There are, Sigala, six dangers which follow from being
> addicted to intoxicating liquors: actual loss of wealth, increase of
> quarrels, susceptibility to disease, loss of good character, indecent
> exposure, impaired intelligence.  
>  11. "Six are the perils from frequenting the streets at unseemly
> hours: he himself is without guard or protection, and so also are his
> wife and children, so also is his property; he, moreover, becomes
> suspected as the doer of undiscovered crimes, and false rumours fix on
> him, and many are the troubles he goes out to meet.  
>  12. "Six are the perils from the haunting of fairs: he is ever
> thinking, where is there dancing? Where is there singing? Where is
> there music? Where is recitation? Where are the cymbals? Where the
> tam-tams?  
>  13. "Six are the perils for him who is infatuated with gambling:
> as winner he begets hatred, when beaten he mourns his lost wealth; his
> actual substance is wasted; his word has no weight in a court of law;
> he is despised by friends and officials; he is not sought after by
> those who would give or take in marriage, for they would say that a
> man who is a gambler cannot afford to keep a wife.  
>  14. "Six are the perils from associating with evil companions: any
> gambler, any libertine, any tippler, any cheat, any swindler, any man
> of violence is his friend and companion.  
>  15. "Six are the perils of the habit of idleness: he says it is
> too cold and does no work, he says it is too hot and does no work, he
> says it is too early or too late and does no work, he says 'I am too
> hungry' and does no work, he says 'I am too full' and does no work.
> And while all that he should do remains undone, new wealth he does not
> get, and such wealth as he has dwindles away.  
>  16. "A religion, to be a religion of man, must teach him to know
> who is a true friend.  
>  17. "Four are they who should be reckoned as foes in the likeness
> of friends; to wit, a rapacious person, the man of words not deeds,
> the flatterer, and the fellow-waster \[=companion in dissipation\].  
>  18. "Of these, the first is to be reckoned as a foe in the
> likeness of a friend, for he is rapacious, he gives little and asks
> much, he does his duty out of fear, he pursues his own interests.  
>  19. "A man of words who is not a man of deeds is to be reckoned as
> a foe in the likeness of a friend: for he makes a friendly profession
> as regards the past, he makes \[a\] friendly profession as regards the
> future, he tries to gain your favour by empty sayings; when the
> opportunity for service has arisen, he avows his disability.  
>  20. "The flatterer is to be reckoned as a foe in the likeness of a
> friend: for he both consents to do wrong, and dissents from doing
> right; he praises to your face; he speaks ill of you to others.  
>  21. "So also the fellow-waster companion is to be reckoned as a
> foe in the likeness of a friend: for he is your companion when you
> frequent the streets at untimely hours, he is your companion when you
> haunt shows and fairs, he is your companion when you are infatuated
> with gambling.  
>  22. "Four are the friends who should be reckoned as sound at
> heart: the helper; the friend who is the same in happiness and
> adversity; the friend of good counsel; the friend who sympathises.  
>  23. "The friend who is a helper is to be reckoned as sound at
> heart: because he guards you when you are off your guard, he guards
> your property when you are off your guard; he is a refuge to you when
> you are afraid; when you have tasks to perform he provides a double
> supply of what you may need.  
>  24. "The friend who is the same in happiness and adversity is to
> be reckoned as sound of heart: because he tells you his secrets; he
> keeps secret your secrets; in your troubles he does not foresake you;
> he lays down even his life for your sake.  
>  25. "The friend who declares what you need to do is sound of
> heart: because he restrains you from doing wrong, he enjoins you to do
> what is right, he informs you of what you had not heard before, he
> reveals to you the way of heaven.  
>  26. "The friend who sympathises is to be reckoned as sound at
> heart: because he does not rejoice over your misfortunes; he rejoices
> over your prosperity; he restrains anyone who is speaking ill of you;
> he commends anyone who is praising you." Thus speaks the Exalted
> One.  
>  27. "Instead of teaching him to worship the six quarters, a
> religion which is a religion of man must teach him to respect and
> revere his parents, his teachers, his wife and children, his friends
> and companions, his servants and workmen, and his religious teachers."
>
>   
> § 3. Vinaya for Children
>
>  1. "A child should minister to his parents, saying: 'Once
> supported by them, I will now be their support, I will perform duties
> incumbent on them; I will keep up the lineage and tradition of my
> family, I will make myself worthy of my heritage.' For the parents
> show their love for him, they restrain him from vice, they exhort him
> to virtue, they train him to a profession, they contract a suitable
> marriage for him, and in due time they hand over his inheritance."
>
>   
> § 4. Vinaya for Pupils
>
> 1\. "A pupil should minister to his teachers by rising from his seat,
> in salutation by waiting upon them, by eagerness to learn, by personal
> service, and by attention when receiving their teaching. For, teachers
> love their pupil, they train him in that wherein he has been well
> trained, they make him hold fast that which is well held, they
> thoroughly instruct him in the lore of every art, they speak well of
> him among his friends and companions. They provide for his safety in
> every quarter."
>
>   
> § 5. Vinaya for Husband and Wife
>
>  1. "A husband should minister to his wife by showing respect, by
> courtesy, by faithfulness, by handing over authority to her, by
> providing her with adornment. For the wife loves him, her duties are
> well performed: by hospitality to the kin of both, by faithfulness, by
> watching over the goods he brings, and by skill and industry in
> discharging all her business.  
>  2. "A clansman should minister to his friends and companions by
> generosity, courtesy, and benevolence, by treating them as he treats
> himself, and by being as good as his word. For his friends and
> familiars love him, they protect him when he is off his guard, and on
> such occasions guard his property; they become a refuge in danger;
> they do not forsake him in his trouble, and they show consideration
> for his family."
>
>   
> § 6. Vinaya for Master and Servant
>
>  1. "A master should minister to his servants and employees by
> assigning them work according to their strength, by supplying them
> with food and wages, by tending them in sickness, by sharing with them
> unusual delicacies, by granting leave at times. For servants and
> employees love their master: they rise before him, they lie down to
> rest after him; they are content with what is given to them, they do
> their work well, and they carry about his praise and good fame.  
>  2. "A clansman should minister to religious teachers by affection
> in act and speech and mind, by keeping open house to them, by
> supplying their temporal needs. For religious teachers restrain him
> from evil, they exhort him to good, they love him with kindly
> thoughts, they teach him what he had not heard, they correct and
> purify what he has heard."
>
>   
> §7. Conclusions
>
>  1. When the Exalted One had thus spoken, Sigala, the young
> householder, said this: "Beautiful, Lord, beautiful! As if one should
> set up again that which had been overthrown, or reveal that which had
> been hidden; or should disclose the road to one that was astray, or
> should carry a lamp into darkness, saying: 'They that have eyes will
> see!' Even so hath the Truth been manifested by the Exalted One in
> many ways.  
>  2. "And I, even I, do go to him as my refuge, and to the Truth and
> to the Order. May the Exalted One receive me as his lay-disciple, as
> one who has taken his refuge in him from this day forth as long as
> life endures."
>
>   
> § 8. Vinaya for Girls
>
>  1. Once the Exalted One dwelt near Bhaddiya in Jatiya Wood; and
> there Uggaha, Mendaka's grandson, paid him a visit and, after
> saluting, sat down at one side. So seated, he said to the Exalted
> One:  
>  2. "Lord, let the Exalted One accept a meal at my house tomorrow,
> he as fourth (with us three)."  
>  3. The Exalted One accepted by his silence.  
>  4. Then Uggaha, seeing the Exalted One had accepted, rose from his
> seat, saluted, and took his leave, keeping the Exalted One on his
> right.  
>  5. Now when the night was over, the Exalted One, robing himself in
> the morning, took his bowl and cloak and went to Uggaha's house, and
> there sat down on the seat made ready. And Uggaha served with his own
> hand. and satisfied the Exalted One with plenty of food.  
>  6. And when the Exalted One had removed his hand from his bowl, he
> sat down at one side. Thus seated, he said:  
>  7. "Lord, these girls of .mine will be going to their husbands'
> families; Lord, let the Exalted One counsel them, let the Exalted One
> advise them, for their good and happiness for many a day!"  
>  8. Then the Exalted One spoke to them and said: "Wherefore, girls,
> train yourselves in this way: 'To whatsoever husband our parents shall
> give us--wishing our weal, seeking our happiness,
> compassionate--because of compassion for him we will rise up early, be
> the last to retire, be willing workers, order all things sweetly. and
> be gentle-voiced.' Train yourselves thus, girls.  
>  9. "And in this way also, girls: 'We will honour, revere, esteem.
> and respect all who are our husband's relatives, whether mother or
> father, recluse or godly man' and on their arrival will offer them a
> seat and water.' Train yourselves thus, girls.  
>  10. "And in this way also. girls: 'We will be deft and nimble at
> our husband's home-crafts, whether they be of wool or cotton, making
> it our business to understand the work so as to do and get it done.'
> Train yourselves thus, girls.  
>  11. "And in this way also, girls: 'Messengers and workfolk. we
> will know the work of each by what has been done, their remissness by
> what has not been done; we will know the strength and the weakness of
> the sick; we will divide the hard and soft food, each according to his
> share.' Train yourselves thus, girls.  
>  12. "And in this way also, girls: 'The money, corn, silver and
> gold that our husband brings home, we will keep safe, watch and ward
> over it, and act as no robber, thief, carouser, wastrel therein.'
> Train yourselves thus, girls."  
>  13. On hearing this advice, the daughters of Uggaha felt
> exceedingly happy and were grateful to the Lord.
