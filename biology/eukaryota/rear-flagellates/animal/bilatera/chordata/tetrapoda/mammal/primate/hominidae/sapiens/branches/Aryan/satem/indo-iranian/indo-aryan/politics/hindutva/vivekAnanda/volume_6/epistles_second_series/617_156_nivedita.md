## CLVI

SAN FRANCISCO,  
*25th March, 1900*.

DEAR NIVEDITA,

I am much better and am growing very strong. I feel sometimes that
freedom is near at hand, and the tortures of the last two years have
been great lessons in many ways. Disease and misfortune come to do us
good in the long run, although at the time we feel that we are submerged
for ever.

I am the infinite blue sky; the clouds may gather over me, but I am the
same infinite blue.

I am trying to get a taste of that peace which I know is my nature and
everyone's nature. These tin pots of bodies and foolish dreams of
happiness and misery â€” what are they?

My dreams are breaking. Om Tat Sat!

Yours,

VIVEKANANDA.
