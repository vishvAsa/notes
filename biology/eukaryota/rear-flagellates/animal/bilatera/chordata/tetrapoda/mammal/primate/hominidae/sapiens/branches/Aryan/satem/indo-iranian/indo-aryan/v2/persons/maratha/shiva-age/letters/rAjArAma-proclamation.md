Proclamation of Chattrapati Rajaram Maharaja to all Hindus during 27 Years War of Hindu Liberation.

The army of Rajaram like that of Rama should fall upon the Muslims suddenly, from unexpected quarters in bands of 500 or 1,000, even 200 men. They should separate them, drive them, kill them and then run away. To sum up, all the people should have one aim of protecting Rajaram's kingdom at the sacrifice of their own lives. The whole Hindu people should struggle for their independence without caring for their lives.
