The Forgotten Kashmiri Engineer – Suyya

by Shanmukh

It is well recognised that there have been many poets, philosophers, scholars, painters, sculptors, and dramatists in our country. However, fewer people know that there have been great engineers too. In this article, we shall examine the career of the ninth century Kashmiri engineering genius, Suyya.

Suyya’s birth is shrouded in mystery, nor are his biological parents known. According to Kalhana, the young Suyya was found in an earthern jar by a Dalit woman named Pooya. She cared for him and arranged for his education in the art of letters. From this example, we can see that most people were educated in the art of letters in ancient India.

At that time, during the reign of Avantivarman, the founder of the Utpala dynasty, there was a great famine. Kalhana narrates that the price of one khari1 of grain rose to more than one thousand and fifty dinars.

More than ten hundreds and fifty dinars became

The price of grain in this land stricken by drought (5:71)

Suyya went about everywhere during the draught, stating that he had the ability to stop the draught, but unfortunately, no money to do so. Hearing that, the soldiers of the king who was at a loss on how to ward off the famine, produced him before the king. Hearing his words, the king suspected Suyya of being a madman, but nevertheless, to test his words, gave him some of his own money. Suyya took a vessel full of gold and from a boat, tossed it into the waters of the Jhelum near Nandakagrama in Madavarajya. Seeing that, all the courtiers and ministers were convinced that Suyya was a madman, but the king held back, desiring to observe him for some more time. At the same time, Suyya went to the place called Yakshadhara in Kramarajya and threw fistfuls of gold into the waters of the Jhelum. The course of the river was impinged upon by rocks that had rolled down the mountains on the very edge of the rivers and in consequence, the river’s flow was very uneven and rough. Seeing that gold was being thrown into the waters, the people of the villages removed those rocks to get at the gold, and in the process, cleared the course of the river of its obstacles, with the result that the river began to flow more evenly and cleanly.

Kalhana says,

Thus in two or three days, the waters were cleverly drawn by him (Suyya)

The Vitasta (Jhelum) was united in one place and the course streamlined by him (5:90)

With temporary stone supports, Suyya streamlined the course of the Himalayan rivers in a week.

With stone supports, owing to the great work of Suyya

Within a week, all the Himalayan rivers were constrained/streamlined by him. (5:92)

The blocking of the channels of the rivers had choked them for a long time. With the obstacles removed, they now flowed clearly towards the sea. By containing their flow, Suyya was able to control the waters. In time, he replaced the temporary supports with permanent stone structures that would stand the test of time. It becomes clear that using temporary structures, and then replacing them with permanent ones was a technique well known in the days of Suyya. Suyya also controlled the flow of the Jhelum and made the river flow in multiple channels and canals, providing water for the villages. Based on the multiple channels mentioned, I suspect that the canals of Srinagar date to his time.

Near the temple of Vainyaswamin, from the left flowed Sindhu2, and from the right flowed Vitasta and they united there. Suyya created/rejuvenated the cities of Phalapura and Parihasapura on either bank at their confluence. At the confluence (presumably on an island), Suyya had a temple to Vishnuswamin constructed and resurrected the temple of Vainyaswamin on the bank and worshipped in those temples. Kalhana describes the two cities (Phalapura and Parihasapura) thus

Even today, in the cities of Phalapura and Parihasapura stand

The temples of Visnhuswamin at the confluence, and Vainyaswamin on the shore. (5:99)

With great mansions on the banks of the rivers,

Hrishikesha in his Yoganidra was worshipped by Suyya (5:100)

Suyya built a stone embankment of seven yojanas3 on the Vitasta and re-directed a part of the river to the Mahapadma (Wular) lake. Kalhana describes it thus

With the tongues of the waves sprouting in all channels, he controlled the flow of the river

As the snake charmers control a snake according to their will. (5:102)

He regulated the currents of the Vitasta for a distance of 7 yojanas

And redirecting the waters into the Mahapadma lake, he contained the flow of the river. (5:103)

Like Adivaraha lifting the earth from the seas, by regulating the flow of water, Suyya raised several villages that had been submerged and rejuvenated them. By directing the water into village lakes and tanks, he ensured the availability of water throughout the entire year for farmers. He tested the soil for water retention properties and based on these properties and the crops grown, he ensured the supply of water to these regions. He also taught the farmers how to conserve water and how to utilise it carefully for crops and with this knowledge, converted Kashmir into a granary of rice. Kalhana opines that neither Balarama, or Kashyapa had done as much for Kashmir as Suyya did. Some of the newly recovered lands were donated to Brahmins by Suyya. By turning the famine into a time of plenty, with greenery everywhere, Suyya reduced the price of grain from two hundred dinars to an unprecedented thirty six dinars for one khari. Suyya, in his own name, created a divinely beautiful city and gave a village named Suyyakundala to Brahmins. The capital city and the village he donated were connected by the Suyya stone bridge across the Vitasta. Not only were people benefited, but in the lakes he created or resurrected, many water birds found comfortable homes.

Kalhana praises Suyya thus:

Due to the merits of Avantivarman, and to rejuvenate all living beings

The very Annapati descended on earth in the form of Suyya (5:72)

1A measure of weight, approximately one quintal.

2This Sindhu is not the river Indus. It is a river specific to the Kashmir valley, since it mentions that Sindhu and Vitasta united near Parihasapura well within the Kashmir valley.

3Yojana is a measure of distance. It has been variously interpreted as either 1 yojana = ~8kms or 13kms.
