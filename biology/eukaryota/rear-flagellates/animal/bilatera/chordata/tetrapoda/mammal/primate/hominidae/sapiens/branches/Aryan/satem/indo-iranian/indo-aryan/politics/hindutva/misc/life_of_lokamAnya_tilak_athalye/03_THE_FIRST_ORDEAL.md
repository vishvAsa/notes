Ruby wine is drunk by knaves.

IT has been said of Buddha that the sight, in quick 
succession, of disease, old age and death took away 
forever the smile from his lips and joy from his mind 
and thenceforth the Lord of Compassion devoted all his 
energies to the solution of the problem of misery. 
Mr. Tilak's youthful thoughts, too, were clouded by 
three great events, which produced an indelible impression on his sensitive spirit and here we must seek 
for the motive which led him to dedicate his life to 
the service of the Mother-land. The lirst of these 
events was the deposition (1875) of the late H. H. 
Malharrao Gaekwar and his subsequent trial, by a 
special commission, on the charge of having attempted 
to poison his Resident Col. Phayre.+++(5)+++ People in the 
Baroda State and outside, strongly believed in the innocence of the Maharaja who was not restored to his 
throne though the Commission differed in its findings. 
The fate of a hapless Indian Prince, who ought to 
have got at least the benefit of doubt created a deep 
wound in Mr. Tilak's mind ; for its patriotism was 
not outlandish, based merely on the perusal of the 
works of Mill and Bright. It was essentially Indian, 
and was directly derived from a contemplation of 
the great and heroic deeds of Shivaji and his descend- 
ants. The Maratha History of the 17th and 18th Centu- 
ries formed the Bible of his patriotism and his blood 
was aflame when he reflected on the utter impotence 
to which the representatives of the Empire-builders 
of the 1 8th century were reduced. 

If the rumbling of a widespread insurrection attended the birth of Mr. Tilak, the year of his graduation (1876) was marked by an abortive attempt 
to overturn the British Government. This attempt 
was confined only to some parts of Maharashtra. Its 
authors were a few fanatics under the leadership of 
Wasudeo Balvant Phadke, a clerk in Government 
employ. The enthusiasm of these people far exceeded 
their limitations. They had neither birth nor fortune 
to impress the imagination of the public. Wasudeo 
Balvant scarcely took note of the practical disappear- 
ance of the martial instincts of the race, the apathy 
and ignorance of the masses, the denationalisation of 
the classes, the sloth of the degenerate descendants of 
the old aristocracy.+++(4)+++ His attempts were doomed to 
failure ; and they could only bring with them their 
inevitable legacy — repression and suspicion. The 
Brahmins — Poona Brahmins especially — were the 
greatest sufferers. Even a ' model ' Moderate like 
Ranade, whose only ' mistake ' in life was a youthful 
essay on Shivaji, that deprived him temporarily of 
his fellowship in the Elphinstone College, did not 
escape suspicion. The impression of the two upheavels of 1857 and 1876 on the mind of Mr. Tilak 
was in inverse proportion to their magnitude and 
importance. The former was an incident which hap- 
pened when he was quite a baby and so the impres- 
sion which he formed concerning it in his boyhood 
was necessarily hazy. In the case of the latter, our 
hero was a full-fledged gentleman, well-armed and 
equipped with knowledge and reason. He saw how 
immature, thoughtless and foolish the attempt of 
Wasudev Balavant was ; and from this time must be 
dated his horror of bloody revolutions. He clearly 
saw that if Indians had to fight with Anglo-Indian 
despots, it could only be, not with sword and gun, 
but with pen and tongue. He saw that the secret of 
the English power in India lay in their superior edu- 
cation and organisation, and that we could wrest that 
power only by meeting the English on their own 
ground. The collection of a few fire-arms and the 
slaughter of a handful of of&cials would not shake 
the well-established British Government in India and 
such attempts would only recoil upon us by rivetting 
our chains. 

The third event that impressed his youthful heart was 
the terrible famine of 1877-8 with its toll of 50 lakhs 
of lives.+++(4)+++ He passed sleepless nights and began to find 
out the cause of such an abnormal condition. 
Throughout his life Mr. Tilak was a friend of the 
poor. Even Mr. Nevinson, a casual acquaintance of 
his was impressed with Mr. Tilak's concern for the 
poor. It was here, in this terrible famine of 1877-8, 
that his sympathy for the poor was roused. To add 
insult to injury, the advisers of Queen Victoria the 
Good induced her to assume the title of ** Kaiser- 
i-Hind " in this very year of famine and starvation. 

The impressions of these events were strengthened by 
the companionship of a congenial friend and the mes- 
sage of an inspiring leader. Since 1874, the young men 
of Maharashtra were watching with passionate enthusiasm the appearance of a luminary in the literary 
firmament of Poona. This luminary was no other 
than the illustrious Vishnushastri Chiploonkar, son 
of Krishnashastri, the memory of whose ability and 
learning is still green. The house of Krishnashastri 
was the favourite resort of all the leading hghts of 
Maharashtra; and of the interesting and instructive 
discourses of his father, Vishnu, shy and studious, 
silent and thoughtful, was an attentive listener. So 
when, after passing the Matriculation he joined the 
Deccan College, he could carry thither a correctness of 
taste and a depth and variety of knowledge which 
many graduates could not claim. While many of his 
fellow-students were abusing the liberty of college- 
life and the liberality of their parents in a variey of 
ways, the excesses of Vishnu were merely intellectual 
and amounted to nothing more than a passionate 
study of history and literature, to the neglect of 
Logic and Mathematics. After graduation in 1872, 
he was persuaded to accept a school-master's post in 
the Educational Department, but this did not prevent 
from starting, in 1874, the famous magazine, the 
Nibandhamala, which by its magnificent rhetorical 
style and trenchant criticism of the Government and 
of the social and religious movements of the day won 
instant renown. It was clear that the pioneer of a 
new School of National thought had arisen, able and 
eager to fight with the pajty led by Ranade. 

The intellectual plane of Ranade was certainly more 
elevated than that of Chiploonkar. In profundity 
of thought, in depth and variety of learning he was 
unequalled. He had tried his best to organise and discipline a generation of social and religious iconoclasts. 
He had tried to lead the destructive and rebellious spirit 
of his time into the constructive channels of Social 
Reform. He wanted to build a Rationalistic Church 
out of the materalistic and agnostic elements born of 
Western education. On the other hand, Vishnusha:stri, 
instead of trying to " reform " the people, wanted to 
rouse them to a consciousness of the glory of their 
history and religion. Heartily disgusted with the 
shallowness of the public movements of his time, he 
called upon the rising generation to make sacrifices ; 
and he himself led the way by " snapping asunder 
(1879) the chain (of service) once and for ever " and 
resolved " to try what might be done for public good 
with the potent instrumentality of a press establish- 
ment worked by a vigorous hand."* 

The example and message of Vishnushastri had 
undoubtedly a stimulating effect upon Mr. Tilak. They 
also influenced Gopal Ganesh Agarkar, Mr. Tilak's chief 
companion in the Deccan College. The early life of 
this remarkable man was one long fight with " chill 
penury." Neglected by relatives, occasionally insulted 
by those whose help he had to seek, this man had 
faith enough to grapple, undaunted, with every difficulty. 
When taunted with poverty he had the spirit 
to tell his teacher — a distinguished M.A. — that he, too, 
would some day take the degree of Master of Arts. 
Poverty has *' repressed '* many a " noble rage ." It 
sours a man and makes him cynical. But even 
stark povery failed to repress the noble instincts of 
Agarkar. Not a wrong in this world but had him as 
its champion ; not a cause of liberty or reform but 
gained his support. A student of Logic and Moral 
Philosophy, he had lost much of his faith in religion. 
But there was another Faith, to him higher and 
nobler, a Faith which evoked the finest qualities of 
his heart. The pent-up and ungratified desires of long 
poverty generally tempt a man to their enjoyment at 
the first opportunity. But such was the greatness of 
Agarkar that when such an opportunity was within 
his easy reach, he wrote to his mother " You may be 
waiting, mother dear, for your son to become an 
M. A. and lift you up from all the misery that haunts 
you. I, however, have decided to turn my back on 
money and happiness and dedicate my life to the 
service of the country." This utter self-denial, after 
a life of stark poverty would alone establish Agarkar's 
title to the ever-lasting gratitude of his countrymen. 

There was one point on which Tilak and Agarkar 
-did not agree, even in their college days ; it was Social 
Reform. While admitting the existence of evils and 
the necessity of eradicating them, Mr. Tilak held 
that reform, to be lasting, could only be a growth from 
within ; that hasty measures and intemperate talk 
would only retard the cause of reform; that reform 
should not be mere imitation of Western life and 
culture but should be based on a proper understanding 
of the genius of our race and the traditions of our 
society ; that the key-note of Indian life is purity 
more than freedom and that in all programmes of 
social reform we cannot too much lay stress on this 
cardinal principle.+++(5)+++ 

But though the attitude of Tilak towards Social 
Reform differed essentially from that of Agarkar, still 
they were agreed that this difference in view-point 
should not prevent both from co-operating with each 
other with respect to the main part of the 
programme which was education in the widest 
sense of the term.+++(4)+++ To cover the Presidency with a 
network of schools was only a part of their aspira- 
tions. They wanted to do something more ; they 
wanted to educate the masses by imparting to them 
democratic ideas and enlightening them on the 
true state of the country. The birth of the New 
English School on the one hand and of the Kesari and 
the Mahratta on the other, heralded in Maharashtra a 
new era and galvanised its public life and the credit of 
this achievement must be given to Chiploonkar, Tilak 
and Agarkar. 

To this band of enthusiastic workers, Ranade gave 
his blessings and something more ; he recommended to 
their notice Mahadeo Ballal Namjoshi, whose versatile 
powers, keen perception, sound experience and tactful, 
pushing nature more than compensated for his lack of 
academic training. Mr. Namjoshi's indefatigable 
energy and immense resourcefulness helped his colleagues to tide over numerous crises and earned for 
him the title of " our foreign secretary." To Tilak, he pariicularly attached himself; and the almost brotherly friendship that sprang between them remained 
unclouded till 1895, when Namjoshi closed his brilliant 
career without leaving the wherewithal to perform his 
funeral ceremony. 

Another man, not less useful, joined them soon after. 
Vaman Shivram Apte, the celebrated lexicographer had 
earned in his college career high repute as an accomplished scholar and immediately on passing his M. A. 
examination had been engaged temporarily as Head 
Master in a Mission School. He tried his best to get a 
very good post in the Educational Department. But 
such is the rigidity of red-tape, that he was offered the 
modest post of an assistant master in an Anglo-Vernacular school. When the founders of the New English 
School heard this, they at once approached Mr. Apte 
and secured his services for the school as its Superin- 
tendent. The choice was most appropriate. Mr. Apte 
fully justified his selection for the post by the diligent 
and thorough manner in which he discharged his duties. 
He had in him the school-master's instinct, which 
taken at its best means a strict but temperate sense of 
discipline, patience with ignorance, system in exposition, 
attention to minute details and a readiness to plod un- 
wearied through the dull monotony of school-life. 

The Vernacular newspapers in Western India were, 
in those days mostly conducted by political dilettanti 
and self-seeking business-men. They therefore could not 
be expected to properly serve the cause of the public. 
The only important exceptions were The Indu-Prakash, 
the Dnyana-Prakash, the Native Opinion and the Subodh 
Patrika. These, out of the 77 newspapers conducted by 
the " Natives " commanded some influence. At such a 
time, therefore, the appearance of the Kesari (Marathi. 
weekly) and of the Mahratta (English weekly), with self- 
sacrificing and patriotic proprietors evoked the liveliest, 
appreciation in the mind of the public and considerable 
uneasiness in the mind of the Government. The appre- 
ciation of the public was shown by the rapid increase 
in the circulation of the Kesari — reaching nearly 4,350 
within three years and the uneasiness of the Government stands mirrored in a remark in the Report (1882), 
on the Native Press which characterized the "prevailing 
tone " of the Kesari as "unfriendly to the Government." This left-handed compliment conclusively 
proves that even in its infancy, the Kesari had distinguished itself by its fearlessness. We do not however, 
find the rigorous editorial discipline which we have 
learnt to associate with the name of Mr. Tilak. This 
was but natural. The proprietors were, one and all, 
very young and had yet to form sound views on many 
of the social and religious questions of the day. The 
editorial eloquence of Agarkar was still in its dawn ; 
the exuberant rhetorical style of Vishnushastri felt 
the limitations of a newspaper article ; nor do we any- 
where find the "parthian shots" of Mr. Tilak, his inci- 
sive logic and trenchant criticism. With all their- 
faults, the news-papers — especially the Kesari — supplied 
the wants of their readers and were everywhere 
praised with warmth and enthusiasm. 

As editor of the Mahratta, Mr. Tilak always championed the people's cause and in criticising the policy 
of high officials made no distinction between white 
and black Bureaucrats. He watched with the greatest 
solicitude the administration of Indian States, The 
affairs of Kolhapur in particular attracted his attention. 
Since 1870, the condition of Kolhapur was far from 
desirable. In that year died Rajaram Maharaj and in 
the year following his two widows adopted Prince 
Shivajirao. Though under good guardianship, the 
young Prince began to show, ever since 1877, signs of 
insanity and was often subject to delusions and suicidal 
tendencies. It was generally believed that this mental 
derangement was due to compulsory adminstration of 
intoxicating drugs to the Prince. The author of this 
mischief was supposed to be Rao Bahadur Barve, 
State Karbhari, who, spurred by the Queen- 
Dowager Sakawarbai, wanted to remove the Maharaja 
from the Gadi either by death or by proof of his lunacy 
and to have a new youth adopted by the Dowager. 
People, high and low believed in these rumours, and 
on November 24th 1881, a monster meeting was held at 
Poona under the presidency of so distinguished and so 
moderate a gentleman as the late Hon. Rao Bahadur 
Gopalrao Hari Deshmukh. In this meeting, a resolution was passed, suggesting that the Prince should 
be immediately put under the guardianship of some 
trustworthy persons. Soon after this meeting was 
held, it was rumoured that an attempt was actually 
made on the life of the young Maharaja, and while 
the alarm caused by this rumour had not subsided, 
Tilak and Agarkar got three letters purporting to be 
written by the Karbhari. In these letters the plan of 
poisoning the Prince was plainly suggested ; and believing that these letters were genuine, Tilak and Agarkar 
published them in the Mahratta and the Kesari and 
challenged the State Karbhari, if he dared, to prove 
his innocence before a court of law. 

Thus brought to bay, Rao Bahadur Barve had to 
accept the challenge with grim determination. He 
hauled up before the Bombay High Court Tilak and 
Agarkar and some of his enemies at Kolhapur. His 
contention was that his enemies at Kolhapur had 
formed themselves into a caucus and had determined 
to blaspheme him. His arch-opponent was one Nana 
Bhide who having been refused a pleader's Sanad, 
had sought to wreck his vengeance by machinations 
in and outside the State. A willing tool was found by 
Nana Bhide in the natural mother of the Prince who 
had a grievancs of her own against the Diwan. Find- 
ing themselves impotent to do mischief in the State, 
these persons had gone over to Poena, caught the ear 
of a credulous public and having approached the 
inexperienced editors of the Kesari and the Mahratta, 
secured an outlet for their fury. The letters, purporting to be his were mere fabrications made by 
Nana Bhide. He had never plotted against the life or 
the gadi of his master. The accusations made against 
him were wantonly wicked and he called for exemplary 
punishment of the offenders. 

The sympathies of an admiring public centred round 
Tilak and Agarkar. They had championed the cause 
of the representative of the historic dynasty of 
Shivaji the Great. They could gain nothing and had 
risked much for the peace and happiness of an unlucky 
Prince. They were defended by the combined ability 
and eloquence of Bombay's rising leaders — the 
fiery Mehta and the sweet-tempered Telang. 

The three letters, of course, formed the pivot of the 
case. Were they genuine ? The State Karbhari as- 
serted that they were not ; Nana Bhide till the last 
persisted in holding that they were. Who could throw 
light on the question ? Some witnesses from Kolhapur 
were expected to solve the riddle. But, though sum- 
moned they did no elect to appear. The High Court 
could not compel attendance ; for the witnesses were 
beyond its jurisdiction. Neither the Political Agent 
nor the Government of Bombay were willing to interfere as the case was a private one. The decision of 
the High Court went against Nana Bhide. The 
letters were pronounced to be unreliable. Tilak and 
Agarkar tendered a graceful apology. But the wrath 
of Barve was not to be so appeased. He pressed for 
conviction ; and Tilak and Agarkar, though declared 
"free from any suspicion of malvolence " were found 
guilty of having " thoughtlessly published defama- 
tory " articles and were sentenced (i6th july 1882) each 
to four months simple imprisonment. 

The decision of the High Court caused no surprise, 
for it was fully anticipated ; and so when Tilak and 
Agarkar were seated in a closed carriage and taken 
to the Dongri jail, they were rather proud of having 
been thus able to show their devotion to their country. 
Being inmates of the same cell, they could compare 
notes, review their conduct, weigh men and things, 
discuss future schemes and past mistakes. Such 
discussions were often carried far into the night 
and then the bugs and fleas of the dungeon were for- 
gotten ; not so the warders' reprimands for having 
broken the stillness of the night by their loud and at 
times heated conversation. In spite of such " lapses" 
Tilak and Agarkar were on the whole fairly " well 
behaved " and got 21 days' remission for " good 
conduct." The disgusting nature of the gaol-diet 
told heavily on their health, Mr. Tilak losing as much 
as 24 lbs. in weight. But they never complained , 
Only one thing troubled them ; time hung heavily 
upon them and they even envied those of their fellow- 
prisoners who had been sentenced to rigorous imprisonment. Wearied of inaction, they sent in an application to the General Superintendent of gaols for 
some sort of work and were glad to find that he was 
kind enough to place books and writing materials 
at their disposal. 

While Tilak and Agarkar were in gaol, a movement, headed by the late Principal Wordsworth 
and the late Hon. Mr. Mandlik was started to petition 
the Government to intervene and save these youths 
from the rigours of prison-life. The appeal fell on 
deaf ears. The Dinbandhu very properly said " In- 
stead of applying to Government for the cancellation 
of the punishment, let us show our regard for the 
patriotic prisoners by giving them a right royal reception on their return." On October 26th 1882, 
Tilak and Agarkar walked out of the portals of 
Dongri, free men once more. Enthusiastic crowds 
awaited them outside. They were borne off in 
triumph. Addresses were presented; laudatory speeches 
wese made ; and the only reply our heroes could, 
make to all this overwhelming kindness was to declare 
that Prisons would never have any terrors for them 
and would never deter them from discharging 
bravely and sincerely their duties. Soon after, 
Agarkar ceased to be a politician and confined his 
attention only to Education and Social Reform. 
Mr. Tilak, however, was privileged frequently to 
enjoy the hospitality of His Majesty's gaols ; and un- 
broken in his resolution, he pursued till the end his 
self-chosen work of National uplift. 

We must not forget to mention that while the 
Defamation case was proceeding, Gopal Krishna 
Gokhale, then a mere college student acted a female 
part in a drama the proceeds of which were to go 
to the fund started to help Tilak and Agarkar.+++(5)+++ It is 
under these circumstances that Gokhale's name 
has been first introduced to the public. Considering 
the future relations between Gokhale and Tilak, who 
will not love to linger on the fragrant memory of this 
small but significant episode ?
