Sir, - It is heartening to note that the Bharatiya Janata Party, of
late, has realised its folly of isolating Muslims. In Kerala it is
organising meetings in which intellectuals of both the communities
exchange their views so as to remove the misunderstandings and
misconceptions between them. In these conclaves, efforts are made to
cultivate and establish healthy relationship between the two
communities. It has also been reported in newspapers that in a number of
districts in Kerala Muslims have not only joined the BJP but have been
given berth in the party’s executive committees.

It is unfortunate that the party leaders speak in different ways on
certain key issues. Whereas some have soft corner for Muslims, others
ostracize them. For better mutual understanding it is necessary that
both the communities first shed their prejudices. To be a good Hindu or
a Muslim does not necessarily mean that their goodness is weighed in
terms of degree of their religiosity. Perhaps, the time has come when
moderates like Atal Behari Vajpayee\* assert their influence in removing
the mistrust between the two communities. - Yours etc.,

**Footnotes:**

\* Muslims as well as ‘secularists’ of all hues have been hailing
Vajpayee as ‘the right man in the wrong party’. Vajpayee has always
relished the compliment without caring a fig for how the remark reflects
on the party he heads. Once again, it is the old story of Pandit Nehru
being the only ‘progressive’ in a ‘reactionary’ Congress. Let there be
no doubt that Vajpayee is another Nehru in the offing so far as Hindutva
is concerned.
