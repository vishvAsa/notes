> § 1. What is Religion?
>
>  1. The word "religion" is an indefinite word with no fixed
> meaning.  
>  2. It is one word with many meanings.  
>  3. This is because religion has passed through many stages. The
> concept at each stage is called Religion, though the concept at one
> stage has not had the same meaning which it had at the preceding
> stage, or is likely to have at the succeeding stage.  
>  4. The conception of religion was never fixed.  
>  5. It has varied from time to time.  
>  6. Because most of the phenomena such as lightning, rain, and
> floods, the occurrence of which the primitive man could not explain,
> \[were not understood\], any weird performance done to control the
> phenomenon was called magic. Religion therefore came to be identified
> with magic.  
>  7. Then came the second stage in the evolution of religion. In
> this stage religion came to be identified with beliefs, rituals,
> ceremonies, prayers, and sacrifices.  
>  8. But this conception of religion is derivative.  
>  9. The pivotal point in religion starts with the belief that there
> exists some power which causes these phenomena, which primitive man
> did not know and could not understand. Magic lost its place at this
> stage.  
>  10. This power was originally malevolent. But later it was felt
> that it could also be benevolent.  
>  11. Beliefs, rites, ceremonies, and sacrifices were necessary both
> to propitiate a benevolent power, and also to conciliate an angry
> power.  
>  12. Later that power was called God or the Creator.  
>  13. Then came the third stage: that it is this God who created
> this world and also man.  
>  14. This was followed by the belief that man has a soul, and the
> soul is eternal and is answerable to God for man's actions in the
> world.  
>  15. This is, in short, the evolution of the concept of Religion.  
>  16. This is what Religion has come to be and this is what it
> connotes--belief in God, belief in \[a\] soul, worship of God, curing
> of the erring soul, propitiating God by prayers, ceremonies,
> sacrifices, etc.
>
>   
> §2. How Dhamma Differs From Religion
>
>  1. What the Buddha calls Dhamma differs fundamentally from what is
> called Religion.  
>  2. What the Buddha calls Dhamma is analogous to what the European
> theologians call Religion.  
>  3. But there is no greater affinity between the two. On the other
> hand, the differences between the two are very great.  
>  4. On this account, some European theologians refuse to recognise
> the Buddha's Dhamma as Religion.  
>  5. There need be no regrets over this. The loss is theirs. It does
> no harm to the Buddha's Dhamma. Rather, it shows what is wanting in
> Religion.  
>  6. Instead of entering into this controversy, it is better to
> proceed to give an idea of Dhamma, and show how it differs from
> Religion.  
>  7. Religion, it is said, is personal, and one must keep it to
> oneself. One must not let it play its part in public life.  
>  8. Contrary to this, Dhamma is social. It is fundamentally and
> essentially so.  
>  9. Dhamma is righteousness, which means right relations between
> man and man in all spheres of life.  
>  10. From this it is evident that one man, if he is alone, does not
> need Dhamma.  
>  11. But when there are two men living in relation to each other,
> they must find a place for Dhamma whether they like it or not. Neither
> can escape it.  
>  12. In other words. Society cannot do without Dhamma.  
>  13. Society has to choose one of the three alternatives.  
>  14. Society may choose not to have any Dhamma as an instrument of
> Government. For Dhamma is nothing if it is not an instrument of
> Government.  
>  15. This means Society chooses the road to anarchy.  
>  16. Secondly, Society may choose the police--i.e.,
> dictatorship--as an instrument of Government.  
>  17. Thirdly, Society may choose Dhamma, plus the Magistrate
> wherever people fail to observe the Dhamma.  
>  18. In anarchy and dictatorship liberty is lost.  
>  19. Only in the third \[case\] liberty survives.  
>  20. Those who want liberty must therefore have Dhamma.  
>  21. Now what is Dhamma? and why is Dhamma necessary? According to
> the Buddha, Dhamma consists of Prajna and Karuna.  
>  22. What is Prajna? And why Prajna? Prajna is understanding. The
> Buddha made Prajna one of the two corner-stones of His Dhamma because
> he did not wish to leave any room for superstition.  
>  23. What is Karuna? And why Karuna? Karuna is love. Because
> without it, Society can neither live nor grow; that is why the Buddha
> made it the second corner-stone of His Dhamma.  
>  24. Such is the definition of the Buddha's Dhamma.  
>  25. How different is this definition of Dhamma from that of
> Religion.  
>  26. So ancient, yet so modern, is the definition of Dhamma given
> by the Buddha.  
>  27. So aboriginal, yet so original.  
>  28. Not borrowed from anyone, yet so true.  
>  29. A unique amalgam of Pradnya and Karuna is the Dhamma of the
> Buddha.  
>  30. Such is the difference between Religion and Dhamma.
>
>   
> § 3. The Purpose of Religion and the Purpose of Dhamma
>
>  1. What is the purpose of Religion? What is the purpose of Dhamma?
> Are they one and the same? Or are they different  
>  2. The answer to these questions are to be found in two
> dialogues--one between the Buddha and Sunakkhatta, and the other
> between the Buddha and the Brahmin Potthapada.  
>  3. The Exalted One was once staying among the Mallas, at Anupiya,
> one of their towns.  
>  4. Now the Exalted One ,having robed himself in the early morning,
> put on his cloak and took his bowl and entered the town for alms.  
>  5. On the way, he thought it was too early to go for alms.
> Therefore he went to the pleasance where Bhaggava the wanderer dwelt,
> and called on him.  
>  6. On seeing the Blessed One Bhaggava got up, saluted him, and
> said, "May it please you, sire, to be seated; here is a seat made
> ready for you."  
>  7. The Exalted One sat down thereon, and Bhaggava, taking a
> certain low stool sat down beside him. So seated, Bhaggava, the
> wanderer, spake thus to the Exalted One :  
>  8 "Some days ago, Lord, a good many days ago, Sunakkhatta of the
> Licchavis called on me and spake thus: 'I have now given up the
> Exalted One, Bhaggava. I am remaining no longer under him (as my
> teacher).' Is the fact really so, just as he said?"  
>  9. "It is just so, Bhaggava, as Sunakkhatta of the Licchavis
> said," replied the Blessed One.  
>  10. "Some days ago, Bhaggava, a good many days ago, Sunakkhatta,
> the Licchavi, came to call on me, and spake thus: 'Sir, I now give up
> the Exalted One. I will henceforth remain no longer under him (as my
> teacher).' When he told me this, I said to him: 'But now, Sunakkhatta,
> have I ever said to you, Come, Sunakkhatta, live under me (as my
> pupil)?'  
>  11. "'No sir, you have not.'  
>  12. "Or have you ever said to me: 'Sir, I would fain dwell under
> the Exalted One (as my teacher)?'  
>  13. "'No sir, I have not.'  
>  14. "Then I asked him 'If I said not the one, and you said not the
> other, what are you and what am I, that you talk of giving up? See,
> foolish one, in how far the fault here is your own.'  
>  15. "'Well, but, sir, the Exalted One works me no mystic wonders
> surpassing the power of ordinary men.'  
>  16. "Why now, Sunakkhatta, have I ever said to you: 'Come, take me
> as your teacher, Sunakkhatta, and I will work for you mystic wonders
> surpassing the power of ordinary men?'  
>  17. "'You have not, sir.'  
>  18. "Or have you ever said to me: 'Sir, I would fain take the
> Exalted One as my teacher, for he will work for me mystic wonders
> beyond the powers of ordinary men?'  
>  19. "'I have not, sir.'  
>  20. "'But if I said not the one, and you said not the other, what
> are you and what am I, foolish man, that you talk of giving up? What
> think you, Sunakkhatta? Whether mystic wonders beyond the power of
> ordinary man are wrought, or whether they are not, is the object for
> which I teach the Dhamma: that it leads to the thorough, destruction
> of ill for the doer thereof?'  
>  21. '"Whether, sir, they are so wrought or not, that is indeed the
> object for which the Dhamma is taught by the Exalted One.'  
>  22. "'If then, Sunakkhatta, it matters not to that object whether
> mystic wonders are wrought or not, of what use to you would be the
> working of them? See, foolish one, in how far the fault here is your
> own.'  
>  23. "'But, sir, the Exalted One does not reveal to me the
> beginning of things.'  
>  24. "Why now, Sunakkhatta, have I ever said to you: 'Come,
> Sunakkhatta, be my. disciple and I will reveal to you the beginning of
> things?'  
>  25. "'Sir, you have not.'  
>  26. "Or have you ever said to me: 'I will become the Exalted One's
> pupil, for he will reveal to me the beginning of things?'  
>  27. "'Sir, I have not.'  
>  28. "'But if I have not said the one and you have not said the
> other, what are you and what am I, foolish man, that you talk of
> giving up on that account? What think you, Sunakkhatta? Whether the
> beginning of things be revealed, or whether it be not, is the object
> for which I teach the Dhamma, that it leads to the thorough
> destruction of ill for the doer thereof?  
>  29. "'Whether, sir, they are revealed or not, that is indeed the
> object for which the Dhamma is taught by the Exalted One.'  
>  30. "'If then, Sunakkhatta, it matters not to that object whether
> the beginning of things be revealed, or whether it be not, of what use
> to you would it be to have the beginning of things revealed?'"  
>  31. This illustrates that Religion is concerned with revealing the
> beginning of things and Dhamma is not.
>
> § 3 part 2 -- The other differences between Religion and Dhamma are
> brought out in the discussion between the Blessed One and Potthapada.
>
>  1. The Blessed One was once staying at Shravasti in
> Anathapindika's pleasance of the Jeta's wood. Now at that time
> Potthapada, the wandering mendicant, was dwelling in the hall put up
> in Queen Mallika's park for a debate on general systems of
> philosophical opinion.  
>  2. There was with him a great following of mendicants; to wit,
> three hundred. A dialogue took place between the Blessed Lord and
> Potthapada. Potthapada asked:  
>  3. "Then, sir, if that be so, tell me at least, is the world
> eternal? Is this alone the truth, and any other view mere folly?'"  
>  4. "That, Potthapada, is a matter on which I have expressed no
> opinion," replied the Blessed Lord.  
>  5. Then, in the same terms, Potthapada asked each of the following
> questions:
>
> > \(i\) 'Is the world not eternal?'  
> > (ii) 'Is the world finite?'  
> > (iii) 'Is the world infinite?'  
> > (iv) 'Is the soul the same as the body?'  
> > (v) 'Is the soul one thing, and the body another?'  
> > (vi) 'Does one who has gained the truth live again after death?'  
> > (vii) 'Does he not live again after death?'  
> > (viii) 'Does he both live again and not live again, after death?'  
> > (ix) 'Does he neither live again, nor not live again, after death?'
>
>  6. And to each questions the Exalted One made the same reply:--  
>  7. "That too, Potthapada, is a matter on which I have expressed no
> opinion."  
>  8. "But why has the Exalted One expressed no opinion on that?"  
>  9. "Because this question is not calculated to profit, it is not
> concerned with the Dhamma, it does not redound even to the elements of
> right conduct, nor to detachment, nor to purification from lusts, nor
> to quietude, nor to tranquillisation of heart, nor to real knowledge,
> nor to the insight (of the higher stages of the Path), nor to Nirvana.
> Therefore is it that I express no opinion upon it. "  
>  10. "Then what is it that the Exalted One has determined?"  
>  11. "I have expounded, Potthapada, what Dukkha is; I have
> expounded what is the origin of Dukkha; I have expounded what is the
> cessation of Dukkha; I have expounded what is the method by which one
> may reach the cessation of Dukkha."  
>  12. "And why has the Exalted One put forth a statement as to
> that?"  
>  13. "Because that question, Potthapada, is calculated to profit,
> is concerned with the Dhamma, redounds to the beginnings of right
> conduct, to detachment, to purification from lusts, to quietude, to
> tranquillisation of heart, to real knowledge, to the insight of the
> higher stages of the Path, and to Nirvana. Therefore is it,
> Potthapada, that I have put forward a statement as to that."  
>  14. In this dialogue it is clearly put forth what is the subject
> matter of Religion, and what is not the subject matter of Dhamma. The
> two are poles apart  
>  15. The purpose of Religion is to explain the origin of the world.
> The purpose of Dhamma is to reconstruct the world.
>
>   
> § 4. Morality and Religion
>
>  1. What is the place of morality in Religion?  
>  2. As a matter of truth, morality has no place in Religion.  
>  3. The content of religion consists of God, soul, prayers,
> worship, rituals, ceremonies, and sacrifices.  
>  4. Morality comes in only wherein man comes in relation to man.  
>  5. Morality comes into religion as a side wind, to maintain peace
> and order.  
>  6. Religion is a triangular piece.  
>  7. Be good to your neighbour, because you are both children of
> God.  
>  8. That is the argument of religion.  
>  9. Every religion preaches morality, but morality is not the root
> of religion.  
>  10. It is a wagon attached to it. It is attached and detached as
> the occasion requires.  
>  11. The action of morality in the functioning of religion is
> therefore casual and occasional.  
>  12. Morality in religion is therefore not effective.
>
>   
> § 5. Dhamma and Morality
>
>  1. What is the place of morality in Dhamma?  
>  2. The simple answer is, Morality is Dhamma and Dhamma is
> Morality.  
>  3. In other words, in Dhamma morality takes the place of God,
> although there is no God in Dhamma.  
>  4. In Dhamma there is no place for prayers, pilgrimages, rituals,
> ceremonies, or sacrifices.  
>  5. Morality is the essence of Dhamma. Without it there is no
> Dhamma.  
>  6. Morality in Dhamma arises from the direct necessity for man to
> love man.  
>  7. It does not require the sanction of God. It is not to please
> God that man has to be moral. It is for his own good that man has to
> love man.
>
>   
> § 6. Mere Morality is not Enough: it must be Sacred and Universal
>
>  1. When is a thing sacred? Why is a thing sacred?  
>  2. In every human society, primitive or advanced, there are some
> things or beliefs which it regards as sacred, and the rest \[it
> regards\] as profane.  
>  3. When a thing or belief has reached the stage of being sacred
> (pavitra), it means that it cannot be violated. Indeed it cannot be
> touched. It is taboo.  
>  4. Contrary to this, a thing or a belief which is profane
> (apavitra), i.e., outside the field of the sacred, may be violated. It
> means one can act contrary to it, without feeling any fear or qualms
> of conscience.  
>  5. The sacred is something holy. To transgress it is a
> sacrilege.  
>  6. Why is a thing made sacred? To confine the scope of the
> question to the matter in hand, why morality should \[=should
> morality\] have been made sacred?  
>  7. Three factors seem to have played their part in making morality
> sacred.  
>  8. The first factor is the social need for protecting the best.  
>  9. The background of this question lies imbedded in what is called
> the struggle of existence and the survival of the fittest.  
>  10. This arises out of the theory of evolution. It is common
> knowledge that evolution takes place through a struggle for existence,
> because the means of food supply in early times were so limited.  
>  11. The struggle is bitter. Nature is said to be red in claw and
> tooth.  
>  12. In this struggle, which is bitter and bloody, only the fittest
> survive.  
>  13. Such is the original state of society.  
>  14. In the course of \[the\] ancient past someone must have raised
> the question, is the fittest (the strongest) the best? Would not the
> weakest, if protected, be ultimately the best for advancing the ends
> and aims of society?  
>  15. The then prevailing state of society seems to have given an
> answer in the affirmative.  
>  16. Then comes, the question what is the way to protect the
> weak?  
>  17. Nothing less than to impose some restraints upon the
> fittest.  
>  18. In this lies the origin and necessity for morality.  
>  19. This morality had to be sacred, because it was imposed
> originally on the fittest, i.e., the strongest.  
>  20. This has very serious consequences.  
>  21. First, does morality in becoming social become anti-social?  
>  22. It is not that there is no morality among thieves. There is
> morality among businessmen. There is morality among fellow castemen
> and there is also morality among a gang of robbers.  
>  23. But this morality is marked by isolation and exclusiveness. It
> is a morality to protect "group interest." It is therefore
> anti-social.  
>  24. It is the isolation and exclusiveness of this kind of morality
> which throws its anti-social spirit in\[to\] relief.  
>  25. The same is true where a group observes morality because it
> has interests of its own to protect.  
>  26. The results of this group organisation of society are
> far-reaching.  
>  27. If society continues to consist of anti-social groups, society
> will remain a disorganised and a factional society.  
>  28. The danger of a disorganised and factional state of society is
> that it sets up a number of different models and standards.  
>  29. In the absence of common models and common standards, society
> cannot be a harmonious whole,  
>  30. With such different models and standards, it is impossible for
> the individual to attain consistency of mind.  
>  31. A society which rests upon the supremacy of one group over
> another, irrespective of its rational or proportionate claims,
> inevitably leads to conflict.  
>  32. The only way to put a stop to conflict is to have common rules
> of morality which are sacred to all.  
>  33. There is the third factor which requires morality to be made
> sacred and universal. It is to safeguard the growth of the
> individual.  
>  34. Under the struggle for existence or under group rule the
> interests of the individuals are not safe.  
>  35. The group set-up prevents an individual from acquiring
> consistency of mind, which is possible only when society has common
> ideals, common models. His thoughts are led astray, and this creates a
> mind whose seeing unity is forced and distorted.  
>  36. Secondly, the group set-up leads to discrimination and denial
> of justice.  
>  37. The group set-up leads to stratification of classes. Those who
> are masters remain masters, and those who are born in slavery remain
> slaves. Owners remain owners, and workers remain workers. The
> privileged remain privileged, and the serfs remain serfs.  
>  38. This means that there can be liberty for some, but not for
> all. This means that there can be equality for a few, but none for
> the majority.  
>  39. What is the remedy? The only remedy lies in making fraternity
> universally effective.  
>  40. What is fraternity? It is nothing but another name for \[the\]
> brotherhood of men--which is another name for morality.  
>  41. This is why the Buddha preached that Dhamma is morality; and
> as Dhamma is sacred, so is morality.
