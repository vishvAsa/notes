## Indic vs Han influence
### Western presentation
Now we shall take a detour into the history of a neighboring nation,
which shares close cultural links with our own, that in recent times has
been blithely swallowed by Han imperialism. Indeed, as though to mirror
the obliteration of this nation from the maps of the world, a certain
strand of modern white Tibetologists tend to attribute greater than
observed roles for the Han in the emergence of the Tibetan civilization.
These present the Indic role as a later one, coming in the form of the
Tantric state, which caused the Tibetans to lapse into a medieval la-la
land from which they were awakened into modernity by the successive
actions of the English and the Han conquerors under Mao Zedong. The role
of the Tibetan emperor (tsenpo) in aiding the Chinese invasion of the
Indian province of tirAbhukti after harShavardhana’s death is seen as
evidence for subservient alignment, right from the inception of the
Tibetan state, with the Han as opposed to the Hindu. 

### Taizong intrusion
However, in history
the chIna-s were rather unbothered about Tibetan existence, until,
somewhat embarrassingly for the former, they intruded into the
sinosphere during the reign of Taizong, their greatest ruler since Shi
Huang-di of the Chin. The rise of the Tibetans coincided in part with
the revival of the chIna-s under Taizong but the two events were not
causally connected in any direct way. 

#### Taizong bio
Taizong, born of a Han father in
the lineage of Laozi the founder of Taoism and a mother from a
subsidiary clan of Blue Turks, through a series of victories raised the
chIna-s to their greatest glory. Perhaps by virtue of the vigor of his
hybrid genetics he was a tall and powerful man, said to tower
imperiously above his cowering fellow chIna-s. He was also described as
a rather impressive personality with a good knowledge of chIna
scientific texts and artistic skill in calligraphy. The Chin Shi Huang
had built the wall and combined it with the terror of genocidal
slaughters \[a fact much admired by Mao in recent times\]; the rulers of
the Han dynasty thereafter built huge infantry forces and fortified
settlements; but Taizong combined all of this with the martial spirit of
the Turkic side of his ancestry along with their capacity for mobile
cavalry warfare. 

Having reunified the chIna-s as a single empire he
advanced westwards with his Turkic allies to conquer the Tarim city
states, displace their Indic culture and bring them into the Han realm.
Having raised the chIna-s to the peak of their power, he instituted a
system with the Taoism and bauddha dharma as the outer coat for the
inner core of legalism centered on his persona. 

In other matters he
adopted Turkic customs such as as allowing chIna women to ride horses
and letting his sons live in yurts on the palace-grounds and speaking
with them in Turkic. In fact Turkicisms acquired great prestige in China
in this phase of the Tang empire. Finally, despite his ministers’ advice
to the contrary, he clearly outlined his policy of sending the Han to
settle all territory he conquered marking the beginnings of the
expansive territorial claims that persist to this day.
