*To Miss Mary Hale*

DEAR SISTER,

I am afraid you are offended and did not answer any of my letters. Now I
beg a hundred thousand pardons. By very good luck, I have found the
orange cloth and am going to have a coat made as soon as I can. I am
glad to hear you met Mrs. Bull. She is such a noble lady and kind
friend. Now, sister, there are two very thin Sanskrit pamphlets in the
house. Kindly send them over if it does not bother you. The books from
India have arrived safe, and I had not to pay any duty on them. I am
surprised that the rugs do not arrive yet. I have not been to see Mother
Temple any more. I could not find time. Every little bit of time I get I
spend in the library.

With everlasting love and gratitude to you all,

Ever your loving brother, 

VIVEKANANDA.

  
PS. Mr. Howe has been a very constant student except the last few days.
Kindly give my love to Miss Howe.
