## Infectivity
> Available data suggest that patients with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 remain infectious no longer than 10 days after symptom onset.
>
> Most patients with more severe-to-critical illness likely remain infectious no longer than 20 days after symptom onset.
>
> There have been numerous reports of moderately or severely immunocompromised people shedding replication-competent virus beyond 20 days.

## Immuno-compromised folks
Cancer patients and those who have a compromised immune system keep shedding viruses for long. Example: a cancer patient who had chemotherapy kept shedding virus till 105 days( 3 months) despite twice being titrated with Remdesivir and plasma therapy.


## In internal organs
The virus can persist in various internal organs.The gastrointestinal system is a good nidus for this virus. The biopsy of the gut from asymptomatic infected  patients 3 months later showed persistence of the virus in the gut.
