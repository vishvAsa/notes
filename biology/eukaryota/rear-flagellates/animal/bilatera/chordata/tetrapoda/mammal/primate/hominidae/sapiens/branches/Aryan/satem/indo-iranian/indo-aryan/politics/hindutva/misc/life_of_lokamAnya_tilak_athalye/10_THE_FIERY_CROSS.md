That, for nearly eighteen years of his life, Mr. Tilak 
was involved in a private litigation, arising out of 
an unnatural alliance between an inexperienced young 
widow, a number of unscrupulous persons inimical 
to him and the mighty Bureaucracy hopelessly preju- 
diced against him, is known to all. The Tai Maharaj 
Case was really a flank movement on the public career 
of Mr. Tilak and was intended to drive him out 
of public life by judicially proving his dishonesty. 
Fortunately Mr. Tilak did ultimately triumph. 
But before the final victory came, he suffered two 
reverses which were fully exploited by his political 
enemies. The judgment of Mr. Justice Chandavarkar 
(1910) with its unwarranted aspersions on Mr. Tilak's 
character, was of invaluable aid to Sir Valentine 
Chirol in villifying him. Apart from the capital made 
out of it by the allies of the Bureaucracy, the 
Tai Maharaj case, in its winding courses, threatened 
to ruin Mr. Tilak in every possible way. It put him 
to an expenditure of thousands of rupees and pro- 
mised to crush him financially. It took huge slices 
from his leisure ; in fact, during some of the stages of 
this never-ending case, the task of vindicating his cha- 
racter was his principle business and politics or 
literature was the work of leisure. A careful calcula- 
tion of the actual time spent by him in fighting out the 
case from its commencement to the conclusion shows 
that it took away six precious years of his time. Nor 
was the loss of time and money his only misfortune. 
The dread uncertainty of it all threw a shadow on his 
cheerfulness. Mr. Tilak's life during the better part of 
this period can be compared to the course of a ship 
which every minute stands in danger of being blown 
over by a stray mine or a torpedo. In the end, truth 
triumphed over falsehood, justice over m justice, and 
Mr. Tilak's character was completely vindicated, first 
by the judgment of the Bombay High Court (1904) and 
then by that of the Privy Council in 1915. 

Mr. Tilak was never a fatalist ; but his experiences in 
the Tai Maharaj case must have shown him what a 
great part, seeming accidents play in men's lives ! When 
on August 5th, 1897, Mr. Tilak was released on bail by 
Mr. Justice Badruddin Tyabji, he must have felt extre- 
mely thankful. But, had the High Court not released 
him on bail on August 5th, Mr. Tilak would not have 
been able to attend (Aug. 7th) the death-bed of his 
friend Baba Maharaj ; and had Mr. Tilak not met Baba 
Maharaj on that mournful day, he would not have been, 
in all probability, required to undertake the thankless 
duties of a Trustee. When Mr. Tilak saw that his friend 
was on the point of death ,he asked him to make a will ; 



THa FIERY CROSS 121 

for he knew that his friend was to leave behind him a 
widow of fifteen and an estate, burdened with debts. 
Baba Maharaj readily agreed and requested Mr. Tilak 
to draft a will. Mr. Tilak did so, in consultation with 
the dying man, and unwilling to take upon himself the 
onerous duties of a trustee, he put in the names of two 
of the neighbours of Baba Maharaj as Trustees. But 
Baba Maharaj knew that his estate would be better 
taken care of by Mr. Tilak than by anyone else 
so he struck off the names suggested by Mr. Tilak 
and put in those of Mr. Tilak, Rao Saheb Kirtikar, 
(Hon.) Mr. Khaparde and of Messrs. Kumbhojkar, and 
Nagpurkar— two clerks in his employ. Mr. Kirtikar 
having refused to do the work the main responsibility na- 
turally fell upon Messrs. Tilak and Khaparde. During 
the period of Mr. Tilak's incarceration Mr. Khaparde 
arranged for the Probate, made inventories and did 
the rest of the initial work. 

The will of Baba Maharaj contained the following 
important paragraph regarding succession and adop- 
tion : 

** My wife is now pregnant. If she does not give 
birth to a son, or if the son after birth is short-lived, 
then, for the purpose of continuing the name of my 
family, with the Vichara of the trustees a boy should be 
given, as often as may be necessary, in adoption, on the 
lap of my wife, in accordance with the Shastras, and the 
Punch should, on behalf of that son, carry on the 
management of the immoveable and moveable estates 
till he attains majority." 

On January iSth, 1S98, the widow gave birth to a 
son but he died within two months. 



122 LOKAMANYA TILAK 

When Mr. Tilak came out of jail (Sep. 1898),) he 
commenced looking after the affairs of Tai Maharaj, 
widow of his deceased friend. The estate was heavily 
burdened with debt and Mr. Tilak found that retrench- 
ment was the only way of saving it. But this 
" could not be agreeable to the young vvridow, who 
fancied herself to be the equitable owner of the estate 
and regarded her possible divestment by an adopted 
boy as a legitimate grievance. There were also harpies 
who fed on her, had made themselves more or less dear 
to her as the objects of idle amusement in her widowed 
leisure and who gradually and slyly nestled into her con- 
fidence as counsellors that whispered agreeable words 
and made pleasant suggestions." What these evil 
counsellors did, will be seen later. 

For nearly three years, Mr. Tilak in consultation with 
Tai Maharaj and other trustees made frequent enquiries 
and numerous efforts towards the securing of a suitable 
boy for adoption. The circle of relations was conside- 
rable, but a suitable adoptee could not be found in the 
Kolhapur or Pcona branches of the family of the de- 
ceased. As we now know some secret efforts were, about 
this time, being made to induce Tai Maharaj to adopt 
Bala Maharaj, brother of Pandit Maharaj of Kolhapur. 

A meeting of the trustees was held on June i8th 
190 1. The records of this meeting show that there were 
no boys available (for adoption) in the Kolhapur branch 
of the family. There were some in the Poona brancho 
but of them none was approved of. The trustees, there- 
fore, decided in consultation with Tai Maharaj, to se© 
if one was availabe in the Babre* branc h of the family. 

• A Village in the District of Aurangabad. 



THE FIERY CROSS 123: 

" (Thereupon)* Messrs. Tilak and Khaparde, accom* 
panied by the widow, went to Aurangabad and select- 
ed five boys within the circle of relationship. The boys 
stayed with the widow for several days, being enter- 
tained and kept under observations. Certain astrolo- 
gers cast the horoscopes of the children. These proved 
favourable to (the appellant) Jagannath ; and her per- 
sonal likings appeared to point in the same direction. 
All this course of conduct pointed to the entire acquies- 
cence on the part of the widow in the Testators' wishes 
and directions, and so far there is no substantial sugges- 
tion to the contrary. On June 27th (therefore) a meet- 
ing of the Sbastris and of other persons in Aurangabad 
was summoned. The father of the boy being present, 
it was announced by the trustees that the boy was 
selected. The father was taken to the widow ; she 
asked him to give her his boy in adoption and he agreed. 
The fact was announced to the assembled guests and 
there and then, the duplicate deeds of adoption were 
drawn up, both intended to be signed and attested by 
the widow. (Another) document was a letter from the 
widow, addressed to the father and agreeing to take the 
boy in adoption. So far as giving and receiving of the 
child, these documents were prepared for and pointed to 
actual adoption in fact. 

" The preparation of the documents, however, occu- 
pied time and the hour being late, the proceedings were 
stopped but were resumed early next morning. A 
gathering was accordingly again held early on the 
28th. The deeds of adoption and the letter were 
duly executed, the boy was given in fact by his

natural father to his adoptive mother, he was re- 
ceived in fact by her on her lap in performance 
of the requisite essential of adoption, and — all being 
done — the formal ceremonies and festivals were post- 
poned to take place afterwards at Poona." 

Under ordinary circumstances, nothing further would 
have been heard of the adoption. But this simple 
transaction was destined to create a v/orld of worry 
and involve Mr. Tilak into troubles from which God's 
Grace and his resourcefulness alone saved him. Re- 
ferring to the origin of the Tai Maharaj case, Mr. Tilak 
wrote in the following strain (Kesari March 8th 1904): — 

** Every flock has its black sheep "says the proverb ; 
the City of Poona too, far famed as a centre of culture, 
has its set of scheming persons, who in the language of 
the poetj'hate for the sake of hatred.' These 'philan- 
thropic ' persons are not necessarily confined to one 
party or to one set of professions ; orthodox or hetero- 
dox, moderates or extremists, lawyers and bankers, 
cultured and uncultured — they join together for their 
own selfish ends and revel in pulling down any good 
person or thing. As long as Mr. Nagpurkar (one of the 
Trustees) had not lost his head, he tried his best to keep 
Tai Maharaj safe from the machinations of these un- 
scrupulous persons. But a time came v/hen he himself 
went over to these persons and set himself to betray the 
interests of his deceased master. 

"It is these people whom Mr. Lucas, the Sessions 
Judge, in his judgment, refers to as Mr. Tilak's deadly 
enemies. These people however knew that they were 
not sufficiently strong to ruin Mr. Tilak. They, there- 
fore, plotted to bring to their aid a powerful ally, viz. 



THE FIERY CROSS 125- 

the Government. They knew that Mr. Tilak's person 
was most distasteful to the Government. They, there- 
fore, induced Tai Maharaj to see Mr. Aston (Agent to 
the Sardars of the Deccan and District Judge) at his 
bungalow and seek his protection against the ' tyranny ' 
of Mr. Tilak. They would surely have failed in this 
diabolical intrigue had Mr. Aston been less impulsive 
or more fair-minded. But Mr. Tilak was to Mr. Aston 
what a red rag is to the bull. It was impossible in the 
very nature of things that Mr. Aston, who once had 
sentenced a poor editor to tranportation for life 
for simply writing against the Government, to -lose this 
golden opportunity of distinguishing himself and 
earning the gratitude of Government. When more- 
over he saw that some respectable (?) persons 
in the town supported Tai Maharaj, his fury knew no 
bounds. His fury incapacitated him from making 
inquiries regarding the truth or otherwise of the 
allegations. The earnest appeal of a young widow for 
protection, the strong support she had of a number of 
respectable-looking men, and the golden opportunity 
of crushing an individual odious to the Government — 
all this was too much for Mr. Aston, who promised 
protection to Tai Maharaj in his double capacity 
as District Judge and Agent to the Deccan Sardars. 
As regards the Bombay Government, their relations 
with Mr. Tilak are well-known, and their implicit faith 
in the conduct of and procedure followed by Mr. Aston 
was apparently perfectly natural." 

On July 29th, 190 1, Tai Maharaj applied for revoca- 
tion of the Probate granted to Mr. Tilak and other 
trustees. Mr. Aston, before whom the proceedings 



126 LOKAMANYA TILAK 

went on, should have really confined himself to the ques- 
tion viz. whether the grant of Probate to Mr. Tilak and 
others had become inoperative owing to the birth (and 
death) of a son to Tai Maharaj. He had no business to 
decide the question of the Aurangabad adoption. But 
in spite of Mr. Tilak 's protests, Mr. Aston allowed the 
Plaintiff to put in evidence regarding the adoption. Mr. 
Tilak was cross-examined for full 14 days. The Judge's 
opinion of Mr. Tilak as a witness is worth recording 
''Fencing, prevaricating, quibbling witness ; demeanour 
distinctly untruthful. A great deal of time was wasted 
by ambiguous replies to plain questions, which were 
repeated over and over again. Witness was repeatedly 
cautioned about fencing." Mr. Aston revoked the 
Probate, held the Aurangabad adoption disproved and 
committed Mr. Tilak under Sec. 476 (C. P. Code) to the 
City Magistrate " to be dealt with according to law." 
Seven charges were formulated against him. They 
were : — 

(i) Mr. Tilak had made false complaint for breach 
of trust against Mr. Nagpurkar, one of the 
trustees. 

(2) Mr. Tilak had fabricated false evidence for use 

by making alterations and interpolations in 
the accounts of the Aurangabad trip. 

(3) Forgery in connection with (2) . . 

(4) Mr. Tilak had corruptly used or attempted to 

use as genuine evidence known to be 
false. 

(5) Mr. Tilak had corruptly used as genuine the 

adoption deed. 



THE FIERY CROSS 12/ 

(6) Mr. Tilak had fraudulently used as genuine the 

adoption deed containing his interpolation 
over Tai Maharaj 's signature. 

(7) Mr. Tilak had given false evidence intentionally. 
Regarding none of these irrelevant charges had 

Mr. Tilak put in even a scrap of paper as evidence. 
Still the learned Judge committed Mr. Tilak to the 
City Magistrate. 

*' The Commitment was made on the 4th of April 
1902 which may be taken, as perhaps, the darkest day, 
that ever dawned upon Mr. Tilak. Just conceive a man 
of Mr. Tilak's position standing before the world which 
already contained a large number of prejudiced 
critics, a fair number of active and bitter opponents, — 
conceive a man in this condition, judicially denounced, 
as an obstinate, high-handed unchivalrous and un- 
scrupulous character, whose hand did not stop even at 
perjuries against a young, weak, and defenceless girl in 
a high family ! Here was a man who had been already 
convicted for sedition, an offence of a purely public 
character. But now was his turn come, for the bottom 
becoming knocked out of him and for his being exposed 
to the world as a character as unworthy in private as it 
had been proved to be in public life. The world won- 
dered and stared and then blinked and stood aghast. 
To a man of Mr. Tilak's education and position, the hour 
must have indeed proved the darkest ! But the lamp 
of faith was burning bright within him and those alone, 
who knew the kind of faith he had in him, could discern 
the distant silver lining with which even the heavy and 
the black clouds ranging over his head were relieved "*

128 LOKAMANYA TILAK 

While the proceedings in connection with the Pro- 
bate apphcation were going on, Mr. Tilak had approach- 
ed the High Court for a transfer of the case from Mr. 
Aston, who having granted several interviews to Tai 
Maharaj and having advised Tai Maharaj — according 
to her own admission — on certain points, had refused 
even to see the Trustees and had thus betrayed his pre- 
judice against Mr. Tilak. But the High Court did not 
grant Mr. Tilak's request for a transfer of the case, 
though when a regular appeal was made against Mr. 
Aston's judgment, the High Court reversed the Probate 
Decision. So Mr. Tilak and his colleagues were once 
more restored to their powers as trustees and executors. 

A special Magistrate was appointed to go into the 
seven big charges against Mr. Tilak. The proceedings 
commenced on September 15th, 1902. The alleged 
false complaint made against Mr. Nagpurkar by Mr. 
Tilak was first taken up for hearing. Mr. Justice 
Beaman, while finally disposing of this question declared, 
that there was nothing wrong or illegal about Mr. Tilak's 
complaint against Mr. Nagpurkar, a " salaried servant 
and agent for the estate and as such a responsible cus- 
todian of the valuable jewllery entrusted to him." It 
was his clear duty, said the learned Judge, " to allow 
inspection of the ornaments when demanded by a ma- 
jority of the trustees, on pain of dismissal for suspected 
dishonesty and criminal misappropriation." Indeed, 
the Prosecution counsel himself, had to admit, that 
there was not a single untrue statement in the com- 
plaint ! Mr. Justice Beaman further said : " Mr. Tilak 
said to the Magistrate exactly what he had said to Nag- 
purkar himself. He said ' Nagpurkar has been in posses- 



THE FIERY CROSS 1 29 

sion of a great deal of valuable jewellery belonging to 
the estate ; we have now dismissed him ; we have called 
upon him to surrender the property and account for it ; 
he declines ; from his conduct and these circumstances 
I have strong reason to suspect that he had criminally 
misappropriated some of it and I invoke your assist- 
ance as Magistrate to make him answer, to make him 
give an account of himself and his property '. I believe 
99 out of 100 persons would have done exactly what 
Tilak did." And yet Mr. Tilak had to fight full 8 
months before he could extract this clear judicial 
statement on such a simple question. 

But this was only the first charge. Mr. Tilak, no 
doubt was successful here; but six remained. The 
next in order related to forgery and fabrication of false 
evidence. But these were triable by a Sessions Court 
with the aid of a jury while the last and the mildest of 
all charges did not require the aid of a jury. Apparently 
the Prosecution had not the courage to take the case to 
a jury. Mr. Tilak formally applied to the Magistrate 
requesting him to take up the more serious charges first. 
But the challenge — for so it was — was not accepted. 
Mr. Tilak was tried for perjury by Mr. Clements, the 
Special Magistrate and on 24th August 1903 was con- 
victed and sentenced to 18 month's rigorous imprison- 
ment to which a fine of Rs. 1,000 was added. 

" Mr. Clements had kept ready a warrant for the Police 
and he refused to interfere in their discretion which 
was evidently to result in Mr. Tilak 's removal to jail 
without being allowed a sufficient time to give instruc- 
tions for lodging the appeal by his pleaders on the spot. 
All this, however, was anticipated, so that the appeal* 
9 



130 LOKAMANYA TILAK 

memo was drawn almost completely at home, by Mr.^ 
Tilak himself and his pleaders who knew what to expect 
in that day's judgment. Mr. Tilak was removed to jail 
immediately after the pronouncement of sentence on 
him, even to the surprise of the Sessions Judge himself 
who, while admitting the appeal and ordering bis re- 
lease on bail, almost without any arguments from Mr. 
Khare (Mr. Tilak's counsel), openly expressed his sur- 
prise at and disapproval of the indecent haste shown in 
the execution of the Jail Warrant."* 

Mr. Lucas, the Sessions Judge, reduced the sentence 
but confirmed the conviction. Mr. Tilak was hand- 
cuffed and taken to the Yeravda jail (Jan. 4th 1904) 
whence he was released on January 8th by an order of 
the High Court. The handcuffing of Mr. Tilak aroused 
Intense public indignation. Said a Calcutta Daily : — 

" We were not by any means prepared for the start- 
ling and shameful tidings which reached us yesterday ; 
the news of a distinguished gentleman of Bombay 
having been, in the Court and in the presence of the 
District Judge of Poona, manacled as a common 
felon. We say at once, and we say with the 
strongest feelings, shame upon the perpetratojrs of this 
foul and disgraceful act ! ! Whence the necessity for 
handcuffing Mr. Tilak ? Was it through fear of his 
escaping ? Nothing of the kind. It was, as some 
might say, to gratify the spite of a few Government 
Jiinderlings, who experienced the delight which the 
cowards always feel by treading on the fallen man. 
* * * * Our only wonder is and we wonder much in- 
deed, why the Governor of Bombay stands by, with hi s

hands in his pockets, when in his Presidency such a 
shameful act takes place ** 

Proceedings in the re visional appeal in the High 
Court commenced on February 24th, 1904. On the 
third of March, judgment was delivered. It was worthy 
of the judicial independence of that legal luminary, Sir 
Lawrence Jenkins. Mr. Tilak's conviction was quash- 
ed and the fine was ordered to be refunded. The Advo- 
cate-General wisely withdrew the remaining five 
charges. 

After the criminal case was thus disposed of, the 
civil case for the declaration of adoption, filed on Sep- 
tember 23rd 1 90 1 and adjourned, pending the criminal 
trial, was again taken up by the ist Class Subordinate 
Judge in June 1904. In this case, also, evidence had 
to be taken on commission at Aurangabad, Amraoti and 
Kolhapur. This work occupied several months. The 
First Class Subordinate Judge decided (July 31st 1906) 
the case in Mr. Tilak's favour. The opposite party 
(that of Bala Maharaj)* appealed to the High Court 
(Octo. 3rd 1906). About two years were taken in trans- 
lating the records. The Bombay High Court eventual- 
ly decided (1910) against Mr. Tilak. Leave was ob- 
tained (1911) to appeal to the Privy Council and the 
translated exhibits were printed and sent to England 
in April 1914. On March 26, 1915, the Privy Council 
quashed the decree of the High Court and restored that 
of the Sub- Judge. In spite of this clear decision, the 

* Tai Maharaj died in September 1903 ; and then her work 
was continued by Bala Maharaj who claimed to have been 
adopted son by her. Thus, it was a fight between Bala Maha- 
raj and Jagannath Maharaj. 



132 LOKAMANYA TILAK 

Bombay Government delayed the execution of the de- 
cree on executive grounds and the estate was received 
by Jagannath Maharaj from the Court of Wards as late 
as Feb. 1917. 

We have already seen, how Mr. Aston, by his obsti- 
nate persistence in importing irrelevant matter in the 
hearing of Tai Maharaj 's application for revocation of the 
Probate, had succeeded in inflicting an amount of men- 
tal torture upon Mr. Tilak and in prolonging unneces- 
sarily the proceedings by a few years. Had Mr. Aston 
resisted the temptation of going into the question of 
adoption and trying to find matter for which Mr. Tilak 
could be criminally taken to task, the case would not 
have assumed these disproportionate dimensions. It 
would seem that the lesson of Mr. Aston was lost upon 
Mr. Justice Chandavarkar, who imported into his 
judgment the criminal proceedings against Mr. Tilak. 
The rebuke of the Privy Council on this point is severe: — 

" Their Lordships have viewed with surprise the 
charge which is made not only against the trustees but 
against the whole body of the Plaintiff's witnesses. Mr. 
Justice Chandavarkar in his judgment states * we are 
driven to believe that a considerable number of men of 
good position have conspired together to give false 
evidence.' The conclusion thus is of the most serious 
character amounting to a plain judicial finding of con- 
spiracy and perjury. Thei? Lordships {however) do not 
think that one ivord of it is justified by the evidence in the 
case". Referring to Messrs. Tilak and Khaparde, Mr, 
Justice Chandavarkar observes that : ' They were men 
of mature years, of exceptional education and mental 

* The italics are ours. 



THE FIERY CROSS t^S 

equalities, lawyers and men of affairs of great repute 
-and good standing and both men of dominating perso- 
;iiality/ Some of the witnesses who gave evidence for 
the Plaintiff are also persons of considerable standing. 
It is difficult to understand how these men, with no 
object to gain and no interest to serve, could be sup- 
posed to have entered into the conspiracy and com- 
mitted the perjury which the High Court judgment 
"found. The conclusion come to by the learned Jtidges {is) 
■entirely unwarranted on the facts". 

*' Large masses of irrelevant matter (have been intro- 
duced in the Judgment of the High Court Judges). In 
July 1903 proceedings were begun to revoke the pro- 
bate granted to the trustees and subsequently criminal 
proceedings were instituted in respect of perjury. Their 
Lordships regret to observe that not only are the cir- 
cumstances with regard to the criminal proceedings 
referred to in the present litigation by the parties but 
that the depositions therein-, become matter apparently 
of materiality in the judgment of the learned judges of 
the High Court. 

" This was an irregularity of a somewhat serious charac- 
ter*. Particularly the depositions in the Criminal Case 
•seem to have been imported in bulk into the present. 
There is a risk, by such procedure, of justice being prevent- 
ed*. A civil cause must be conducted in the ordinary 
way and judged of by the evidence led therein. The 
depositions could not have been used to support the 
evidence of the Plaintiff. There (is) no warrant for 
using them for the purpose of either contradicting or 
•^discounting the evidence. It was stated to their Lord-

134 LOKAMANYA TILAK 

ships that the prosecution for perjury had in the encP 
completely failed. Successful or unsuccessful, the in- 
troduction of the criminal proceedings in this civiP 
action (was) illegitimate. 

** A further mischance in point of procedure must 
now be mentioned. As already stated, the testimony of 
the Plaintiff's witnesses is not contradicted orally, and 
is internally a consistent body of evidence. But vari- 
ous minutes and documents are the subject of minute 
analysis, observation and comment by the learned 
Judges with a view to rebutting it. Their Lordships 
think it right to observe that, in view of the serious 
nature of the verdict of the High Court, they have con- 
sidered it within their province themselves to peruse 
the documents. Having done so, they are of the opi- 
nion that, taken together, they comipletely confirm the 
case made in the witness box and that there is no ground' 
for the conclusion that they either contradict the testi* 
mony or cast reasonable doubt upon it." 

The part, the Government played during the course 
of this case, decidedly lowered the people's respect for 
them. It is certainly an unconscious tribute they paid 
to Mr. Tilak. During the last hundred years, India has 
produced a number of patriots whose distinguished abi- 
lities and remarkable services to the cause of India's 
freedom will forever lie recorded in our History. If, 
out of these many persons. Government singled out Mr. 
Tilak for their kind attentions, what does the fact show? 
It was not by mere accident that Mr. Tilak was thus 
persecuted for well nigh two decades. It was because 
the Government dreaded the personality and the prestige 
of this Poona Brahmin that they went out of their way 



THE FIERY CROSS 135 

in using the Tai Maharaj case for their political ven- 
detta. There were, and there are leaders whose record 
of political service might be longer than that of Mr. 
Tilak. But they have not disdained to bask in the Sun- 
shine of Government favour. In spite of their brave 
fights, they have more delighted in co-operating with 
Government. Their efforts in the cause of the Nation 
were made in the leisure of business or profession. 
They devoted their attention only to the intelligent few 
and never cared to approach the masses. In these and 
several other respects Mr. Tilak's career bears a striking 
contrast to theirs and it was this new ideal of leadership 
which Mr. Tilak placed before himself and the country 
that frightened the Bureaucracy. It was Mr. Tilak's 
virile methods of political agitation that were responsi- 
ble for the implicable hostility with which he was pur- 
sued. Mr. Tilak never made complaints, he never 
sought reUef. He knew that such persecutions were 
the necessary price he had to pay. But we may now 
ask " What did the Government gain by all this ?'* 
They could neither bend nor crush Mr. Tilak. They 
only succeeded in getting deserved odium for having 
unduly harassed a righteous man. 

The apathy with which Mr. Tilak's political oppon- 
ents in the Presidency could behold the conspiracy 
that well-nigh threatened to engulf him, is no less re- 
prehensible. They had undoubted influence with the 
Government; they had very frequent occasions of meet- 
ing very high officers of the Government. Did they 
ever utter a word of protest regarding the Government's 
attitude in respect of this case ? Did they do their duty 
by Mr. Tilak ? Nobody ever thinks of holding the 



136 LOKAMANYA TILAK 

Moderate leaders responsible for Mr. Tilak's troubles in 
the Tai Maharaj case. But their indifference to Mr. 
Tilak's fate is certainly culpable. We have yet to learn 
how to shield or protect our brethren even though they 
belonged to the opposite school. The Moderates might 
freely quarrel with the Extremists but while 
facing the Government, we all must present a united 
front. 

This long struggle was not without its benefits to Mr. 
Tilak. No doubt, it left him very little leisure, espe- 
cially in the earlier stages of the case. It did not enable 
him to take part in public activities with his character- 
istic ardour. Once he had to absent himself from the 
Congress ; on another occasion he was too busy with 
the case to find time to give evidence before the Police 
Commission. He had to cancel so many public enga- 
gements ; he had to restrict his activities to the narrow- 
est possible limits. We do not deplore all this undoubt- 
ed loss for the reason that this period (1901-1904) 
synchronised with that of the political reaction of which 
Lord Curzon was the most distinguished author. Until 
the reaction had reached its height, the movement of 
Regeneration could not start. 

When, with the Partition of Bengal, the movement 
of Regeneration started, Mr. Tilak had come unscathed 
out of this fiery ordeal. The glory of martyrdom with 
which he started work was not the most important 
benefit he had derived from the Tai Maharaj case. Mr. 
Tilak himself was changed. The Tai Maharaj case 
aimed at knocking the bottom off his character; the 
course of its first stage (i 901- 1904) tested and strength- 
ened his character. The vast conspiracy aimed at

proving him to be nothing better than a perjurer utterly 
collapsed and Mr. Tilak could not, out of the gratitude 
of his heart, but recognize the Divine Hand that saved 
him from the machinations of the tremendous odds 
against him. The realisation, of this Divine favour creat- 
ed a revolution in his mentality. With all his great 
and heroic qualities of the heart — his sterling self-sacri- 
fice, his magnificent courage, his genuine humanity and 
his inborn purity, it must be admitted that Mr. Tilak 
was more of a Dnyanin than of a Bhakta. The immense 
intellectual and other powers lavishly bestowed upon 
him by an all-wise Providence were somewhat inconsis- 
tent with that tenderness, pathos and humility which 
are the essential characteristics of a Bhakta.. But the 
the excruciating mental tortures of the Tai Maharaj 
case — we are talking of the earlier stages — convinced 
him, how weak, how little man after all is, in spite of 
his intellectual and moral powers, and how in the last 
resort we have to depend upon dispensations from 
Above. When his enemies had gathered thick about 
him and had well nigh caught him in their toils, Mr. 
Tilak's spirit conferred with the Divine and strong in. 
the consciousness of Divine support, hurled defiance at 
those mortal enemies. From this period Mr. Tilak's 
speeches and writings shine with the fire of a prophet. 
To him the national struggle ceased to be merely intel- 
lectual. It was now no longer a fight of arguments. 
His politics was now spiritualised. It was this spiri- 
tual fire that enabled him to tide over reverses yet in 
store for him and bring his country within the sight of 
the Promised Land.
