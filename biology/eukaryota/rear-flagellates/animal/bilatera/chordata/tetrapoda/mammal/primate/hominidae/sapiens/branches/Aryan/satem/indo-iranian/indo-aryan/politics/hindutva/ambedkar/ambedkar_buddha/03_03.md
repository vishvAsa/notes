>  1. "There are these three forms of purity... And of what sort is
> purity of body?  
>  2. "Herein a certain one abstains from taking life, from stealing,

>  3. "And of what sort is purity of speech?  
>  4. "Herein a certain one abstains from falsehood...  
>  5. "And of what sort is purity of mind?  
>  6. "Herein a monk, if he have some personal sensual desire, is
> aware: ' There is in me sensual desire.' If there be none he is
> likewise aware of it. Also he is aware of how the arising of sensual
> desire not yet arisen comes about, and how it is abandoned when it has
> arisen, and how in the future there is no such arising.  
>  7. "If he have some personal malevolence, he is aware: ' There is
> within me malevolence.' Also he is aware of the arising . . . and the
> abandoning thereof, and of how in future there is no recurrence
> thereof.  
>  8. "If he have some personal sloth-and-torpor...excitement and
> flurry...if he have some personal doubt-and-wavering, he is aware of
> the fact. Also of how (each of these) arises, is abandoned and recurs
> not again in future. This is called 'purity of mind.'  
>  9. "He who is pure in body, speech, and mind,  
>  "Sinless and clean and blessed with purity--  
>  "'Sin-washer' is the name men give to him."
>
> (1.ii)
>
>  1. "There are three forms of purity...Purity of body, purity of
> speech, purity of mind."  
>  2. "And of what sort is purity of body?"  
>  3. "Herein a certain one abstains from taking life, from stealing,
> from wrong practice in sensual lusts. This is called 'purity of
> body.'"  
>  4. "And of what sort is purity of speech?"  
>  5. "Herein a certain one abstains from falsehood...from idle
> babble. This is called 'purity of speech.'"  
>  6. "And of what sort is purity of mind?"  
>  7. "Herein a certain one is not covetous or malevolent of heart,
> and has \[a\] right view. This is called 'purity of mind.' These are
> the three forms of purity."
>
> (1.iii)
>
>  1. There are these five weaknesses, which are a source of weakness
> to training. What five?  
>  2. Taking life; taking what is not given; lustful, evil practices;
> lying; and indulging in spirituous liquors, which cause idleness.  
>  3. These are the five causes which lead to failure.  
>  4. When these five sources of weakness to training are put away,
> four arisings of mindfulness should be made to become.  
>  5. Herein a monk abides contemplating the body as body, strenuous,
> mindful and self-possessed, having overcome both the hankering and
> discontent common in the world.  
>  6. He abides contemplating the feelings as feelings...  
>  7. He abides contemplating the mind as mind...  
>  8. He abides contemplating ideas as ideas, strenuous, mindful and
> self-possessed, having overcome both the hankering and discontent
> common in the world.  
>  9. When these five sources of weakness to training are put away,
> these four arisings of mindfulness should be made to become.
>
> (1.iv)
>
>  1. There are these three failures. Failure in morals, failure in
> mind, failure in view.  
>  2. And of what sort is failure in morals? A certain one takes
> life, steals, is a wrong-doer in sensual desires, a liar, a slanderer,
> of bitter speech, an idle babbler. This is called "failure in
> morals."  
>  3. And of what sort is failure in mind?  
>  4. A certain one is covetous and malevolent of heart. This is
> called "failure in mind."  
>  5. And of what sort is failure in view?  
>  6. Herein a certain one holds the depraved, the perverse view that
> there is no (virtue in) alms giving, in sacrifice, in offerings; that
> there is no fruit, no result of good and evil deeds; that this world
> is not, that there is no world beyond; that there is no mother, no
> father, no beings of spontaneous birth; that in the world are no
> recluses and Brahmins who have won the summit, who have won
> perfection, who of themselves by their own in tuitional powers have
> realised the world beyond and can proclaim it. This, monks, is called
> "failure in view."  
>  7. Monks, it is due to failure in morals, failure in mind and in
> view, that beings, when \[the\] body breaks up after death, are reborn
> in the Waste, the Way of Woe, in the Downfall, in Purgatory. Such are
> the three failures.  
>  8. Monks, there are these three successes. What three? Success in
> morals, success in mind, success in view.  
>  9. Now of what sort is success in morals?  
>  10. A certain one abstains from taking life and the rest...from
> bitter speech and idle babbling. This is called "success in morals."  
>  11. And of what sort is success in mind?  
>  12. Herein a certain one is not covetous or malevolent of heart.
> This is called "success in mind."  
>  13. And of what sort is success in view?  
>  14. Herein a certain one has \[a\] right view: he holds with
> certainty that there is (virtue in) almsgiving, in sacrifice, in
> offerings; that there is fruit and result of good and evil deeds; that
> this world is, that there is a world beyond; that mother, father and
> beings of spontaneous birth do exist; that in the world there are
> recluses and Brahmins who have realised the world beyond and can
> proclaim it. This, monks, is called "success in view."  
>  15. It is owing to success in these three things that beings, when
> \[the\] body breaks up after death, are reborn in the Happy Lot, in
> the Heaven World. Such, monks, are the three successes.
>
>   
> § 2. To Reach Perfection in Life is Dhamma
>
>  1. There are these three perfections.  
>  2. Perfection in body, speech and mind.  
>  3. And of what sort is perfection in mind?  
>  4. By the destruction of the asavas, realising in this very life
> himself, knowing it thoroughly--the heart's release, the release by
> insight which is free from the asavas, having attained it abides
> therein. This is called "perfection in mind." These are the three
> bodily perfections.  
>  5. There are other perfections. The Buddha explained them to
> Subhuti.  
>  6. Subhuti: "What is a Bodhisattva's perfection of giving?"  
>  7. The Lord: "Here a Bodhisattva, his thoughts associated with the
> knowledge of all modes, gives gifts, i.e., inward or outward things,
> and, having made them common to all beings, he dedicates them to
> supreme enlightenment; and also others he instigates thereto. But
> there is nowhere an apprehension of anything."  
>  8. Subhuti: "What is a Bodhisattva's perfection of morality?"  
>  9. The Lord: "He himself lives under the obligation of the ten
> ways of wholesome acting, and also others he instigates thereto."  
>  10. Subhuti: "What is a Bodhisattva's perfection of patience?"  
>  11. The Lord: "He himself becomes one who has achieved patience,
> and others also he instigates to patience."  
>  12. Subhuti: "What is a Bodhisattva's perfection of vigour?"  
>  13. The Lord: "He dwells persistently in the five perfections, and
> also others he instigates to do likewise."  
>  14. Subhuti: "What is the Bodhisattva's perfection of
> concentration (or meditation)?"  
>  15. The Lord: "He himself, through skill in means, enters into the
> trances, yet he is not reborn in the corresponding heavens of form as
> he could \[be\]; and others also he instigates to do likewise."  
>  16. Subhuti: "What is a Bodhisattva's perfection of wisdom?"  
>  17. The Lord: "He does not settle down in any dharma, he
> contemplates the essential original nature of all dharmas; and others
> also he instigates to the contemplation of all dharmas."  
>  18. It is Dhamma to cultivate these perfections.
>
>   
> § 3. To Live in Nibbana is Dhamma
>
>  1. "Nothing can give real happiness as \[can\] Nibbana." So said
> the Buddha.  
>  2. Of all the doctrines taught by the Buddha, the doctrine of
> Nibbana is the most central one.  
>  3. What is Nibbana? Nibbana as taught by the Buddha has a totally
> different meaning and content than what has been given to it by his
> predecessors.  
>  4. By Nibbana they meant the salvation of the soul.  
>  5. Thus there were four ways in which Nibbana was conceived of:
> (1) Laukik (material, eat, drink and be merry type); (2) Yogic; (3)
> Brahmanic, and (4) Upanishadic.  
>  6. There was one common feature of the Brahmanic and Upanishadic
> conceptions of Nibbana. They involved the recognition of a soul as an
> independent entity--a theory which the Buddha had denied. The Buddha
> had therefore no difficulty in rejecting the Brahmanic and Upanishadic
> teaching of Nibbana.  
>  7. The Laukik conception of Nibbana was too materialistic to
> appeal to the Buddha. It meant nothing but the satisfaction of man's
> animal appetites. There was nothing spiritual in it.  
>  8. To accept such a conception of Nibbana the Buddha felt was a
> gross wrong that can be done to a human being.  
>  9. For the satisfaction of appetites can result only in creating
> more appetites. Such a way of life could bring no happiness, he
> thought. On the contrary, such happiness was sure to bring more
> unhappiness.  
>  10. The Yogic conception of Nibbana was a purely temporary state.
> The happiness it brought was negative. It involved disassociation from
> the world. It avoided pain but gave no happiness. Whatever happiness
> it may be said to bring lasted as long as the yoga lasted. It was not
> permanent. It was temporary.  
>  11. The Buddha's conception of Nibbana is quite different from
> that of his predecessors.  
>  12. There are three ideas which underlie his conception of
> Nibbana.  
>  13. Of these, the happiness of a sentient being as distinct from
> the salvation of the soul is one.  
>  14. The second idea is the happiness of the sentient being in
> *Samsara* while he is alive. But the idea of a soul and the salvation
> of the soul after death are absolutely foreign to the Buddha's
> conception of Nibbana.  
>  15. The third idea which underlies his conception of Nibbana is
> the exercise of control over the flames of the passions which are
> always on fire.  
>  16. That the passions are like burning fire was the text of a
> sermon which the Buddha delivered to the Bhikkus when he was staying
> in Gaya. This is what he said:  
>  17. "All things, O Bhikkus, are on fire. And what, O Priests, are
> all these things which are on fire?  
>  18. "The eye, O Bhikkus, is on fire; forms are on fire;
> eye-consciousness is on fire; impressions received by the eye are on
> fire; and whatever sensation, pleasant, unpleasant, or indifferent,
> originates in dependence on impression received by he type, that also
> is on fire."  
>  19. "And with what are these on fire?"  
>  20. "With the. fire of passion, say I, with the fire of hatred,
> with the fire of infatuation; with birth, old age, death, sorrow,
> lamentation, misery, grief and despair are they on fire."  
>  21. "The ear is on fire; sounds are on fire; the nose is on
> fire; odours are on fire; the tongue is on fire; tastes are on fire;
> the body is on fire; ideas are on fire; and whatever sensation,
> pleasant, unpleasant, or indifferent, originates in dependence on
> impression received by the mind, that also is on fire.  
>  22. "And with what are these on fire?"  
>  23. "With the fire of passion, say I; with the fire of hatred;
> with the fire of infatuation; with birth, old age, death, sorrow,
> lamentation, misery, grief, and despair are they on fire."  
>  24. "Perceiving this, O Bhikkus, the learned and noble \[person\]
> conceives an aversion. And in conceiving this aversion, he becomes
> divested of passion, and by the absence of passion he becomes free,
> and when he is free he becomes aware that he is free."  
>  25. How can Nibbana give happiness? That is the next question
> which calls for explanation.  
>  26. The common notion is that man is unhappy because he is in
> want. But this is not always true. Man is unhappy even though he is in
> the midst of plenty.  
>  27. Unhappiness is the result of greed, and greed is the bane of
> life of those who have, as well as of those who have not.  
>  28. This the Buddha has made clear in a sermon delivered to the
> Bhikkus in which he said:  
>  29. "Excited by greed (lobha), brothers, furious with anger
> (dosa), blinded by delusion (moha), with mind overwhelmed, with mind
> enslaved, men reflect upon their own misfortune, men reflect upon the
> misfortune of others, men experience mental suffering and anguish.  
>  30. "If, however, greed, anger and delusion are done away
> \[with\], men reflect neither upon their own misfortune nor on mental
> suffering and anguish.  
>  31. "Thus, brothers, is Nibbana visible in this life and not
> merely in the future--inviting, attractive, accessible to the wise
> disciple."  
>  32. Herein lies the explanation of what consumes man and makes him
> unhappy. By using this analogy of burning fire to the working of human
> passions, the Buddha has given the most forceful explanation for the
> unhappiness of man.  
>  33. What makes man unhappy is his falling a prey to his passions.
> These passions are called fetters which prevent a man from reaching
> the state of Nibbana. The moment he is free from the sway of his
> passions--i.e., he learns to achieve Nibbana--man's way to happiness
> is open to him.  
>  34. These passions, according to the Buddha's analysis, fall under
> three groups.  
>  35. First: that which refers to all degrees of craving or
> attachment--such as lust, infatuation, and greed (lobha).  
>  36. Second: that which refers to all degrees of antipathy--hatred,
> anger, vexation, or repugnance (dosa).  
>  37. Third: that which refers to all degrees of
> ignorance--delusion, dullness, and stupidity (moha or avidya).  
>  38. The first and second fires relate to the emotions and
> \[range\] over the whole scale of one's attitudes and feelings towards
> other beings, while the third fire relates to all ideas that are in
> any way removed from the truth.  
>  39. There are certain misunderstandings about the Buddha's
> doctrine of Nibbana.  
>  40. The word Nibbana etymologically means outblowing,
> extinguishing.  
>  41. Taking hold of this root meaning of the word, critics have
> tried to make nonsense of the doctrine of Nibbana.  
>  42. They hold that Nibbana means extinction of all human passions,
> which is equivalent to death.  
>  43. They have by this means tried to throw ridicule over the
> doctrine of Nibbana.  
>  44. That such is not the meaning of Nibbana is quite clear if one
> examines the language of the fire sermon.  
>  45. The fire sermon does not say that life is burning and death is
> extinction. It says passions are on fire.  
>  46. The fire sermon does not say that the passions must be
> extinguished completely. It says, do not add fuel to the flame.  
>  47. Secondly, critics have failed to make a distinction between
> Nibbana and Parinibbana.  
>  48. As the Udana says: "Parinibbana occurs when the body becomes
> disintegrated, all perceptions become stopped, all sensations die
> away, the activities cease and consciousness goes away. Thus
> Parinibbana means complete extinction."  
>  49. Nibbana can never have this meaning. Nibbana means enough
> control over passion so as to enable one to walk on the path of
> righteousness. It was not intended to mean. anything more.  
>  50. That Nibbana is another name for righteous life is made clear
> by the Buddha himself to Radha.  
>  51. Once the venerable Radha came to the Exalted One. Having done
> so, he saluted the Exalted One and sat down at one side. So seated,
> the venerable Radha thus addressed the Exalted One: "Pray, Lord, what
> for \[=for what\] is Nibbana?"  
>  52. "Nibbana means release from passion," replied the Lord.  
>  53. "But Nibbana, Lord,--what is the aim of it?"  
>  54. "Rooted in Nibbana, Radha, the righteous life is lived.
> Nibbana is its goal. Nibbana is its end."  
>  55. That Nibbana does not mean extinction is also made clear by
> Sariputta in the following sermon:  
>  56. "Once the Blessed Lord was staying at Shravasti in
> Anathpindika's Ashrama where Sariputta was also staying.  
>  57. "The Lord, addressing the brethren, said, 'Almsmen, be ye
> partakers not of the world's goods but of my doctrine; in my
> compassion for you all I am anxious to ensure this.'  
>  58. "Thus spoke the Lord, who thereupon rose and passed to his own
> cell.  
>  59. "Sariputta remained behind, and the brethren asked him to
> explain what is Nibbana.  
>  60. "Then Sariputta in reply to the brethren said, ' Brethren,
> know ye that greed is vile, and vile is resentment.  
>  61. "'To shed this greed and this resentment, there is the Middle
> Way which gives us eyes to see and makes us know, leading us on to
> peace, insight, enlightenment, and Nibbana.  
>  62. "'What is this Middle Way? It is naught but the Noble
> Eightfold Path of right outlook, right aims, right speech, right
> action, right means of livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness,
> and right concentration; this, almsmen, is the Middle Way.  
>  63. "'Yes, sirs: anger is vile and malevolence is vile, envy and
> jealousy are vile, niggardliness and avarice are vile, hypocrisy and
> deceit and arrogance are vile, inflation \[=boastfulness\] is vile,
> and indolence is vile.  
>  64. "'For the shedding of inflation and indolence there is the
> Middle Way--giving us eyes to see, making us know, and leading us on
> to peace, insight, enlightenment.  
>  65. "'Nibbana--which is naught but that Noble Eightfold Path.'"  
>  66. Thus spoke the revered Sariputta. Glad at heart, the almsmen
> rejoiced at what he had said:  
>  67. That the idea underlying Nibbana is that it is the path of
> righteousness. No one will mistake Nibbana for anything else.  
>  68. Complete annihilation is one extreme, and Parinibbana is
> another extreme. Nibbana is the Middle Way.  
>  69. So understood, all confusion about Nibbana will disappear.
>
>   
> § 4. To Give up Craving is Dhamma
>
>  1. In the Dhammapada the Buddha says: "There is no greater benefit
> than. health, and there is nothing more valuable than the spirit of
> contentment."  
>  2. This spirit of contentment is not to be understood to mean
> meekness or surrender to circumstances.  
>  3. Because that would be quite contrary to the other teachings of
> the Buddha.  
>  4. The Buddha has not said, "Blessed are they who are poor."  
>  5. The Buddha has not said that the sufferer should not try to
> change his condition.  
>  6. On the other hand, he has said that riches are welcome; and
> instead of listless suffering he taught Virya, which is energetic
> action.  
>  7. What the Buddha meant when he said that contentment is the
> highest form of wealth is that man should not allow himself to be
> overpowered by greed which has no limits.  
>  8. As the Bhikku Rathapala has said, "Rich men I see who,
> folly-led, never give, but still amass, athirst for pleasures new; the
> king whose conquests to the sea extend, for sway over empires overseas
> will pine; still craving, kings and subjects pass away; lacking, still
> lacking, they their bodies quit; never on earth can pleasure's measure
> be filled."  
>  9. In the Maha-Nidan-Suttanta the Buddha has explained to Ananda
> the necessity of controlling greed. This is what he said:  
>  10. "Thus it is, Ananda, that craving comes into being because of
> desire for gain, when desire for gain becomes a passion for
> possession; when the spirit of possession gives rise to tenacity of
> possession, it becomes avarice.  
>  11. "Avarice or possession due to \[the\] uncontrolled acquisitive
> instinct calls for watch and ward.  
>  12. "Why is this craving or greed to be condemned? Because of
> this," said the Buddha to Ananda, "many a bad and wicked state of
> things arises--blows and wounds, strife, contradiction and retorts;
> quarrelling, slander, and lies."  
>  13. That this is the correct analysis of class struggle, there can
> be no doubt.  
>  14. That is why the Buddha insisted upon the control of greed and
> craving.
>
>   
> § 5. To believe that all compound things are impermanent is Dhamma
>
>  1. This doctrine of impermanence has three aspects.  
>  2. There is the impermanence of composite things.  
>  3. There is the impermanence of the individual being.  
>  4. There is the impermanence of the self-nature of conditioned
> things.  
>  5. The impermanence of composite things has been well explained by
> the great Buddhist philosopher Asanga.  
>  6. "All things," says Asanga, "are produced by the combination of
> causes and conditions, and have no independent noumenon of their own.
> When the combination is dissolved, their destruction ensures.  
>  7. "The body of a living being consists of the combination of four
> great elements--viz., earth, water, fire and air--and when this
> combination is resolved into the four component elements, dissolution
> ensues.  
>  8. "This is what is called the impermanence of a composite
> entity."  
>  9. Impermanence of the living individual is best described by the
> formula: being is becoming.  
>  10. In this sense a being of a past moment has lived, but does not
> live, nor will he live. The being of a future moment will live, but
> has not lived, nor does he live; the being of the present moment does
> live, but has not lived, and will not live.  
>  11. In short, a human being is always changing, always growing. He
> is not the same at two different moments of his life.  
>  12. The third phase of the doctrine of impermanence is somewhat
> difficult for a common man to follow.  
>  13. To realise that every living being will die sometime or other
> is a very easy matter to understand.  
>  14. But it is not quite so easy to understand how a human being
> can go on changing--becoming--while he is alive.  
>  15. "How is this possible?" The Buddha's answer was, "This is
> possible because all is impermanent."  
>  16. This later on gave rise to what is called Sunnya Vad.  
>  17. The Buddhist Sunnyata does not mean nihilism out and out. It
> only means the perpetual changes occurring at every moment in the
> phenomenal world.  
>  18. Very few realise that it is on account of Sunnyata that
> everything becomes possible; without it nothing in the world would be
> possible. It is on the impermanence of the nature of all things that
> the possibility of all other things depends.  
>  19. If things were not subject to continual change, but were
> permanent and unchangeable, the evolution of all of life from one kind
> to the other, and the development of living things, would come to a
> dead stop.  
>  20. If human beings \[had not\] died or changed, but had continued
> always in the same state, what would the result have been? The
> progress of the human race would have come to a dead halt.  
>  21. Immense difficulty would have arisen if Sunnya is \[=had
> been\] regarded as being void or empty.  
>  22. But this is not so. Sunnya is like a point which has substance
> but neither breadth nor length.  
>  23. All things are impermanent, was the doctrine preached by the
> Buddha.  
>  24. What is the moral of this doctrine of the Buddha? This is a
> much more important question.  
>  25. The moral of this doctrine of impermanence is simple. Do not
> be attached to anything.  
>  26. It is to cultivate detachment--detachment from property, from
> friends, etc.--that he said "All these are impermanent."
>
>   
> § 6. To believe that Karma is the instrument of Moral Order is Dhamma
>
>  1. There is an order in the physical world. This is proved by the
> following phenomenon.  
>  2. There is a certain order in the movements and actions of the
> starry bodies.  
>  3. There is a certain order by which seasons come and go in
> regular sequence.  
>  4. There is a certain order by which seeds grow into trees, and
> trees yield fruits ,and fruits give seeds.  
>  5. In Buddhist terminology these are called Niyamas, laws which
> produce an orderly sequence such as Rutu Niyam, Bija Niyam.  
>  6. Similarly is there a moral order in Human Society. How is it
> produced? How is it maintained?  
>  7. Those who believe in the existence of God have no difficulty in
> answering the question. And their answer is easy.  
>  8. Moral order, they say, is maintained by Divine Dispensation.
> God created the world, and God is the Supreme Governor of the world.
> He is also the author of moral as well as of physical law.  
>  9. Moral law, according to them, is for man's good, because it
> ensues from Divine will. Man is bound to obey God, who is his maker,
> and it is obedience to God which maintains the moral order.  
>  10. Such is the argument in support of the view that the moral
> order is maintained by Divine Dispensation.  
>  11. The explanation is by no means satisfactory. For if the moral
> law has originated from God, and if God is the beginning and end of
> the moral order, and if man cannot escape from obeying God, why is
> there so much moral disorder in the world?  
>  12. What is the authority of the Divine Law? What is the hold of
> the Divine Law over the individual? These are pertinent questions. But
> to none of them is there any satisfactory answer from those who rely
> on Divine Dispensation as the basis for the moral order.  
>  13. To overcome these difficulties the thesis has been somewhat
> modified.  
>  14. It is said: No doubt creation took effect at the command of
> God. It is also true that the cosmos entered upon its life by his will

>  18. The answer which the Buddha gave to the question, " How is
> moral order maintained?", is totally different.  
>  19. His answer was simple. "It is the Kamma Niyam and not God
> which maintains the moral order in the universe." That was the
> Buddha's answer to the question.  
>  20. The moral order of the universe may be good or it may be bad.
> But according to the Buddha, the moral order rests on man and on
> nobody else.  
>  21. Kamma means man's action, and Vipaka is its effect. If the
> moral order is bad, it is because man does Akusala (Bad) Kamma. If the
> moral order is good, it is because man does Kusala (Good) Kamma.  
>  22. The Buddha was not content with merely speaking of Kamma. He
> spoke of the law of Kamma, which is another name for Kamma Niyam.  
>  23. By speaking of the law of Kamma, what the Buddha wanted to
> convey was that the effect of the deed was bound to follow the deed,
> as surely as night follows day. It was like a Niyam or rule.  
>  24. No one could fail to benefit by the good effects of a Kusala
> Kamma, and no one could escape the evil effects of Akusala Kamma.  
>  25. Therefore, the Buddha's admonition was: do Kusala Kamma so
> that humanity may benefit by a good moral order which a Kusala Kamma
> helps to sustain; do not do Akusala Kamma, for humanity will suffer
> from the bad moral order which an Akusala Kamma will bring about.  
>  26. It may be that there is a time interval between the moment
> when the Kamma is done, and the moment when the effect is felt. It is
> so, often enough.  
>  27. From this point of view, Kamma is either (1) Ditthadamma
> Vedaniya Kamma (Immediately Effective Kamma); (2) Upapajjavedaniya
> Kamma (Remotely Effective Kamma); and \[=or\] (3) Aporapariya Vedaniya
> Kamma (Indefinitely Effective Kamma).  
>  28. Kamma may also fall into the category of Ahosi Kamma, i.e.,
> Kamma which is non-effective. This Ahosi Kamma comprises all such
> Kammas which are too weak to operate, or which are counteracted by a
> more \[powerful?\] Kamma, at the time when it \[=they\] should have
> worked.  
>  29. But making allowance for all these considerations, it does not
> in any sense derogate from the claim made by the Buddha that the law
> of Kamma is inexorable.  
>  30. The theory of the law of Kamma does not necessarily involve
> the conception that the effect of the Kamma recoils on the doer of it,
> and there is nothing more to be thought about it. This is an error.
> Sometimes the action of one affects another instead of the doer. All
> the same, it is the working of the law of Kamma, because it either
> upholds or upsets the moral order.  
>  31. Individuals come and individuals go. But the moral order of
> the universe remains, and so also the law of Kamma which sustains
> it.  
>  32. It is for this reason that in the religion of the Buddha,
> Morality has been given the place of God.  
>  33. Thus the Buddha's answer to the question of how the moral
> order in the universe is sustained, is so simple and so irrefutable.  
>  34. And yet its true meaning is scarcely grasped. Often, almost
> always, it is either misunderstood or misstated or misinterpreted. Not
> many seem to be conscious that the law of Kamma was propounded by the
> Buddha as an answer to the question \[of \] how the moral order is
> maintained.  
>  35. That, however, is the purpose of Buddha's Law of Kamma.  
>  36. The Law of Kamma has to do only with the question of general
> moral order. It has nothing to do with the fortunes or misfortunes of
> an individual.  
>  37. It is concerned with the maintenance of the moral order in the
> universe.  
>  38. It is because of this that the law of Kamma is a part of
> Dhamma.
