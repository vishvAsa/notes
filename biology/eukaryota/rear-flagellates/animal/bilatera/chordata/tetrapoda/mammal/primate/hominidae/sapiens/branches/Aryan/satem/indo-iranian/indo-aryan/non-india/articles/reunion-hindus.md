Hinduism in RÃ©union island, France ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡·

First Indian labourer arrived in the French overseas island on 25th July 1860, when slavery was abolished in 1848. First Indians were numbered around 6000. This significantly increased to 38,000. 

Overwhelming majority of these Indians were Tamils from French territory in India. They were brought to Grenade Chaloupe lazaret. They were quarantined here. These Indian were prosecuted and striped off their basic rights and forcefully made to convert to christianity. They were forced to assimilate to Frence identity. (Some of the early souvenir, the documents related to the agreements between the French and British for providing labourers to the island.)


Malabar was the official term given to all Indians. For Tamils the name denoted to them was "Tamouls". Indians constitute 25% of overall population. Conservative estimates of overall Hindu population ranges from 6.70% to 10%. 

Many of these Indians who were converted to christianity were largely crypto Hindus, who were " Socially catholic and privately Hindu". Most of the catholics have small mAriaman (Tamil deity) behind their home. There has been revival of Hinduism and Tamil culture among Indians especially Higher and Middle class people. The main organisation which represents Hindus are "Tamil Sangam", who largely built Temples and school that teach Tamil literature and culture. They have built many Temples scattered throughout the RÃ©union island They largely speak creole, a corrupt version of French mixed with local language. Similar to their Mauritian counterparts - except majority of Mauritian Indians are North Indians (Bihar and UP) and minority South Indians. Really hope @RSSorg @VHPDigital @IskconInc really revive Hinduism there and look at their demands below. 

Since French government largely made religious census illegal, its really impossible to estimate how many Hindu percent is really like!! But there are multiple sources say 10% of the entire population of the island are practising Hinduism and that percentage can be increased. Since majority of Hindus in RÃ©union are Tamils, Thai poosam (Traditional Tamil festival dedicated to Lord Murugan) is largely celebrated there. Thai poosam in RÃ©union and Mauritius is called "Cadvee". 

Unfortunately Since RÃ©union is part of France, most Indians migrate to Metropolitan France causing their share to decline, just like their Mauritian counterparts to Anglophone countries.
