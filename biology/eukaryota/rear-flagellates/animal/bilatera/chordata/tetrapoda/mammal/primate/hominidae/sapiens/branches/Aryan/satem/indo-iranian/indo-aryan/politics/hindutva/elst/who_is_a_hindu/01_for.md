**Foreword**

This book contains a part of my Ph.D. thesis, updated and adapted for
general publication.  It can best be read in conjunction with the main
part of the thesis, now in print under the title \*Decolonizing the
Hindu Mind\*.

My thanks are due to Mrs. Yamini Liu, Mr. Gopi Maliwal, Mr. Krishan
Bhatnagar, Mr. Pradeep Goel, Mr. Satinder Trehan, Dr. Tushar Ravuri and
Mr. Vishal Agarwal, as well as to the late Prof. Kedar Nath Mishra.  But
any mistakes are of course due only to my own oversight.  Corrections
and other feedback are welcomed.
