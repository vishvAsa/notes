IVTR. TILAK'S transportation to Mandalay was 
followed by a long period of political re-action. 
Boycott, political or economic, ceased to count as a 
iactor in practical politics. Only lord Minto's 
" Honest Swadeshi " lived. National schools and 
colleges were deserted. The Samitts were sup- 
pressed. Arbitration courts collapsed. Whole- 
sale repression drove the movement underground, 
bringing Terrorism in its train. The Terrorist was 
vigorously hunted. Popular leaders found their way 
either to goal or to self-imposed exile. The National 
Congress with its ever-dwindling enthusiasm and 
attendance, met only to register the grosving depres- 
sion of the Moderate leaders. The " Reformed " 
Councils had disillusioned the people. Even Mr. 
Gokhale's optimism was shattered. The Octopeaa 



214 LOKAMANYA TILAK 

Press Act strangled all freedom of writing. National- 
literature was mostly proscribed, especially all that 
described Mr. Tilak's personality or preached his 
principles. Evidently this was an attempt to make 
the people to forget him. *" A hush had fallen over 
the country. No man seemed to know which way 
to move and from all sides came the question * What 
shall we do next ? What is there that we can do ?* " 

On his return to Poona, Mr. Tilak could read this 
question on every face. The great Nationalist Party 
so laboriously organised by him was thoroughly 
routed. People asked themselves the question, 
** Would Mr. Tilak take his rightful place as the 
leader of the Nationalists or would he, like so many 
others, bow to the inevitable and spend the evening 
of his life in philosophy and meditation *'? The 
future of India de})ended on what answer Mr. Tilak- 
would give to this question. At a welcome meeting, 
held at Poona on Sunday 21st June 1914, he said :— 

' When after six year? absence, I return home and 
begin to renew my acquaintance with the world, I 
find myself in the position of Rip Van Winkle. 1 
was kept by the authorities in such a rigorous seclu- 
sion that it seemed that they desired that I should' 
forget the world and be forgotten by it. However I 
have not forgotten the people, and I am glad to 
notice that the people have not forgotten me. I can 
only assure the public that separation for six 
long years could not diminish my love for them and 
that I am willing and ready to serve in the satn^' 
manner and in the same relation and in the same capa-

$ity which belonged to me six years before, though 
it may be, I shall have to modify the course a little."" 
This declaration gave a quietus to the rumour that 
Mr. Tilak " intended to devote the evening of his 
life to meditation " and scholarshp. There were 
some well-meaning advisers who even urged Mr. Tilak 
to retire from Politics and achieve " immortal re- 
nown " by writing books like the Gita Rahasya. But 
Mr. Tilak knew the mission of his life better. " Lite- 
rature and philosophy " he pointed out " are merely 
my recreation ; my life-work lies quite in a different 
direction." 

In the leaden sky of Indian politics, Mr. Tilak saw 
a few gleams of hope. The total failure of the Morley- 
Minto Reforms^ the consequent disappointment of 
the Moderate party, the awakening of the great 
Moslem community and the entry of Mrs. Besant in 
Indian Politics, inspired him with great confidence. 
His immediate political programme was threefold : 
(i) The Congress-Compromise, (2) The reorganisation 
of the Nationalist party (3) The setting on foot of a 
strong agitation for Home Rule. His leisure was 
devoted to the completion and publication (1915) of 
the Gita-Rahasya and the consideration of the steps 
to be taken against Sir Valentine Chirol for defama- 
tion. 

Seeing that he had no inclination for a life of learn- 
ed retirement, the Bureaucracy tried their hands at 
an ' ofQcial boycott ' of Mr. Tilak, and a couple of 
police-stations were created in the neighbourhood of 
his residence to keep ' a close and rigorous surveil- 
lance ' on him. Visitors to his house were * boldly 



2l6 LOKAMANYA TILAK 

and openly accosted ' and were required to give their 
names. If Government servants or persons in any 
way connected with the Government called upon 
him, they received warnings subsequently. It was 
a bare-faced piece of ' political Vendetta ' which had 
to be abandoned owing to the outbreak of the great 
European war in August 19 14. 

A man who had been in goal for over seven years 
of his life and who had been persecuted in a variety 
of other ways, has every reason to be embittered. 
But Mr. Tilak — who combined in himself the qualities 
of the soldier and the philosopher — took these troubles 
quite lightly, almost as a matter of course. He was 
nothing if not chivalrous and high-minded ; so when 
the British Government commenced its mortal fight 
with Germany he made (27th August 19 14) his " de- 
claration of loyalty " — a declaration which extorted 
admiration even from hostile quarters. He repudia- 
ted the nasty and totally unfounded charges against 
him, declared that he had never either directly or 
indirectly incited people to deeds of violence, denied 
that he had ever worked " with the object of sub- 
verting the British rule in India " and concluded by 
saying that " at such a crisis it is the duty of every 
Indian, be he great or small, rich or poor, to support 
and assist his Majesty's Government to the best of 
his ability." 

One effect of this declaration was to clear up many 
of the cruel misunderstandings that hung like an omi- 
nous cloud upon his personality and career. Even the 
(nominal) Advocate of India recognized in Mr. Tilak 
*' one of our loyalest and truest friends " and called 



^IF VAN WINKLE ! 21/ 

upon his detractors to " admit their mistake and make 
at the eariiest possible moment ' the amende honorable.^ " 
No wonder that Mrs. Beasant thought this to be a 
most opportune moment for bringing together the 
much-abused Moderates and the much-persecuted Ex- 
tremists. If Sir Edward Carson could suspend his op' 
position to the Liberal Ministry and shake hands with 
Mr. Asquith, could not Mr. Gokhale and Mr. Tilak 
" forget, forgive and unite " in the larger interests of 
of the country ? 

The negotiations for the Congress Compromise re- 
sulted in a temporary failure and form one of the sad- 
dest chapters in the history of Maharashtra. x\s fates 
would have it, the two great Servants of India — Tilak 
and Gokhale — were pitted against each other in a bitter 
controversy, the younger had denounced the elder 
patriot, and, before the curtain fell on the controversy, 
was himself no more (19th February 1915) ; Gokhale, 
who began life as a reverent follower of Tilak '' stabbed 
him in the dark " and then vanished into eternity ! 
Oh, the irony of human life ! 

There was a humorous side, too, to this great tragedy ! 
Gokhale, on the point of death and Sir Pherozeshah not 
far removed from it, afraid to take Mr. Tilak in the 
Congress, because, once in, he would capture it !! 
" Boycott of the Government " considered to be the 
unpardonable sin of Mr. Tilak ! ! The introduction of a 
Home Rule Bill in ParUament, through Mr. Tilak's 
influence with the Labour leaders and the concentra- 
tion of all the agitation on that one point regarded as 
the approach of deluge ! ! And all this, only six years 
before the Congress of 1920 ! ! 1

In the circumstances of the case, Mr. Tilak's party 
was naturally anxious to re-enter the Congress-fold, 
not only on grounds of national unity but also for the 
more narrow reasons of party interests. The great 
Nationalist Party, organised by him in the eventful 
years of the Swadeshi agitation was, by Government 
repression weakened, silenced, disorganised, discredited 
and practically routed. As the Congress would be a 
great rallying point, Mr. Tilak's sincerity in conducting 
the negotiations was transparent. Not so, that of the 
Moderates, to whom the association with their Extre- 
mist brethren was a matter which caused uneasiness 
and occasional inconvenience. Sir Pherozeshah Mehta 
was dead against the admission of Mr. Tilak with his 
* firebrands ' into the Congress camp and others like 
Gokhale had not the courage to go against their chief. 
That is why the negotiations fell through. 

The Constitution and rules of the Congress were 
passed (1908) by a Committee appointed by the Conven- 
tion (Dec. 1907) from which many Nationalists, willing: 
to join it in spite of the evident humiliations, 
were deliberately and brusquely excluded. For the 
sake of unity, Mr. Tilak was willing to join a Congress- 
whose creed (Article No. I) was not quite inspiring, whose 
constitution was faulty and whose rules were unreason- 
able and arbitrary. But there must be some honour- 
able way of returning to the Congress. If Mr. Tilak 
wanted to go back to the Congress it must be only as 
a delegate elected by some political body recognised by 
or affiliated to the Congress. 

" The old practice of electing delegates at any public 
meeting was set aside and the election of Congress dele- 



RIP VAN WINKLE ! 21^ 

gates was completely and exclusively in the hands " of 
the Moderate Associations. ** It was unreasonable to 
expect that one party should seek admission to the 
Congress through the associations entirely controlled 
and managed by the other/' The only course, therefore, 
that could bring the Nationahsts in the National Con- 
gress was so to amend Article XX of the Congress 
Constitution as to enable them to elect their delegates 
at public meetings or meetings of Nationalist Associa- 
tions. Everything depended on the Moderate leaders* 
willingness to alter Article XX of the Congress Con- 
stitution in the desired manner. 

The rest of the story is soon told.* " Mrs. Besant 
accompanied by Mr. Subba Rao, the General Secretary 
of the Madras Congress (1914) went to Poona in the 
first week of December (1914) and conferred with Messrs. 
Tilak, Gokhale and other leading publicists of Poona. 
The suggested amendment of Article XX of the Con- 
gress Constitution was agreed upon. Then Mr. Subba 
Rao went over to Bombay to consult Sir Pherozeshah; 
he returned disappointed. Then he met Mr. Tilak, had 
a long talk with him, which frightened him as well as- 
Mr. Gokhale to whom it was subsequently reported. 
Mr. Gokhale was convinced, that Mr. Tilak's re-entry 
into the Congress Camp would only be a signal for a 
renewal of the old struggle. He, therefore, withdrew 
his support from the proposed amendment, sent an 
oral message to Mrs. Besant accordingly and in reply 
to a letter from the President-elect, wrote to him a 
confidential letter explaining the reasons of his change 
of view. That letter or its re\'ised copy 'became publia 

* From the Amrit Bazat Pairika (12th January 191 5).

property in no time.' It was stated in this communi- 
cation that Mr. Tilak had openly avowed his intention 
of adopting the ' boycott of Government * and ob- 
structionist methods of the Irish, if he entered the 
Congress. The matter was prominently brought to 
the notice of the Subjects' Committee and naturally, 
the ears of many of its members were poisoned against 
the Mahratta patriot behind his back. In the mean- 
time, Mrs. Besant wired to Mr. Tilak to ascertain the 
truth or otherwise of the allegation, and not only did 
he give a direct lie to it, but said that many of his col- 
leagues and followers were actually serving either in 
the Legislative Council or in Municipalities and Dis- 
trict Boards ! Mr. Tilak's telegram, however, came too 
late to mend matters. An apology was, no doubt, 
offered to him and charges against him withdrawn but 
his enemies triumphed in the end by getting the ques- 
tion of reconcilation postponed and a Committee 
appointed to consider it." 

It is clear that Mr. Gokhale's conhdential* letters to 
the President-elect of the Congress spoiled the prospect 
of rapproachment between the two parties. Mr. Gokhale 
justified his conduct by asserting that his change of 
opinion with regard to the Compromise question was 
necessitated by Mr. Tilak's conversation reported to 
him by Mr. Subba Rao. It was in part as follows : — 

" In Mr. Tilak's opinion the present programme of 

* Mr. H. P. Mody, in his recently published Life of Sir Phero- 
zeshah Mehta has tried to lift the veil from this episode just a 
Mttle by giving two extracts from Mr. Gokhale's letters. Evidently 
these extracts do not exhaust the whole of Mr. Gokhale's case 
against Mr. Tilak. The venomous parts of the indictment are 
apparently still held back. 



RIP VAN WINKLE ! 22r 

the Congress was of no value. They were asking for 
small reforms while Mr. Tilak asked his countrymen to 
have nothing to do with these. He would make only 
one demand, viz, that for self-Go vernment within the 
Empire. The Irish, by resorting to methods of ob- 
struction, have in the course of 30 years, got Home 
Rule. They must also similarly adopt methods of 
obstruction within the limits of the law, and then only 
would they be able to compel the Government to con- 
cede their demands." 

All this came upon Mr. Gokhale as bolt from the blue. 
Equally startling to him was the statement of Mr. 
Tilak's conversation with Mr. Subba Rao. The state- 
ment commences thus : — 

" The attitude of the Nationalists is generally one of 
Constitutional Opposition to the Government ; while 
that of the Moderates is that of Co-operation with the 
Government. Though the ideal of both is the samej 
the difference between them lies in the methods adopted 
by them for reaching the goal." 

We leave it to the readers of to-day, to judge whether 
Mr. Gokhale's change of front could be justified by Mr. 
Tilak's remarks quoted above. It is interesting to 
note that this conversation, which so much disappoint- 
ed Mr. Gokhale occurred on December 8th 1914^ 
after Mr. Subba Rao to whom was assigned the difficult 
task of winning over the Bombay City Moderates, had 
returned quite disappointed from Bombay. Mr. Subba 
Rao has published in the New India (8th Feb. 1915) 
a statement in which he said that the Bombay Conven- 
tionist leaders were dead opposed to the amendment 
proposed by Mrs. Besant and that " great apprehension 



222 LOKAMANYA TILAK 

was felt that the Congress would be running a great risk 
if Mr. Tilak and his followers came in/' This then was 
the real cause of the failure of the compromise 
negotiations. For it was not to be expected that Mr. 
Gokhale would now continue to support the proposed 
amendment of the Constitution, though it was origin- 
ally drafted by him. 

The Report of the Committee appointed at Madras 
to consider the question of the Congress-Compromise 
was discussed at the next session of the Congress at 
Bombay and a partially satisfactory solution was arrived 
at. " Public meetings convened under the auspices 
of any association, which is not of less than two yeeirs 
standing on 31st December 19 15 and which has for one 
of its objects, the attainment of Self-Government by 
India on Colonial lines within the British Empire by 
Constitutional means " were allowed and as Mr. Tilak's 
party could now send delegates to the Congress without 
looking up to the Moderates for patronage and support 
he decided to accept whole-heartedly the grudging and 
halting concession. It was high time. A new genera- 
tion of Nationalists, willing and eager to sink all differ- 
ences, had arisen. The great European War had alter- 
ed the whole outlook of the Nation. A demand for a 
substantial instalment of Self-government was to be 
formulated. It had to be backed up by the strength 
of United India. Under these circumstances Mr. Tilak 
was not the man to emphasize his differences with his 
erring and timid fellow-countrymen. As early as 
January 1916, he publicly announced the willingness of 
his party to forget the past and re-enter the Congress 
through the partially opened door.
