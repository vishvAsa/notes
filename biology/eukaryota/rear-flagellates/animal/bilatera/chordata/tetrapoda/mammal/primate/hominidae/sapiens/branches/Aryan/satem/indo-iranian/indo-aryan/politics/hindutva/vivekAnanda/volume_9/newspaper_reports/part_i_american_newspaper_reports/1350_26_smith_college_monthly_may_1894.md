 — We say much of the brotherhood of man and the fatherhood
of God, but few understand the meaning of these words. True brotherhood
is possible only when the soul draws so near to the All-Father that
jealousies and petty claims of superiority must vanish because we are so
much above them. We must take care lest we become like the frog of the
well in the old Hindoo story, who, having lived for a long time in a
small place, at last denied the existence of a larger space.
