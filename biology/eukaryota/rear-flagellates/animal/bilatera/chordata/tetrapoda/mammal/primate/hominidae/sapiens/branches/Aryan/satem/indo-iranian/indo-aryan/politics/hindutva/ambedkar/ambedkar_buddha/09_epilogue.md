> ยง 1 Tributes to the Buddha's Greatness
>
>  1. The Buddha was born 2500 years ago.  
>  2. What do modern thinkers and scientists say of him and his
> Dhamma? An anthology of their thoughts on the subject will be
> useful.  
>  3. Prof. S. S. Raghavachar says:  
>  4. "The period immediately antecedent to the life of the Buddha
> was one of the darkest ages in the history of India.  
>  5. It was intellectually a backward age. The thought of the time
> was characterised by an implicit veneration for the authority of the
> scriptures.  
>  6. "Morally it was a dark age.  
>  7. "Morality meant for the believing Hindus the correct
> performance of rites and ceremonies enjoined in the holy texts.  
>  8. "The really ethical ideas like self-sacrifice or purity of will
> did not find appropriate positions in the moral consciousness of the
> time."  
>  9. Mr. R. J. Jackson says:  
>  10. "The unique character of the Buddha's teaching is shown forth
> in the study of Indian Religious thought.  
>  11. "In the hymns of the Rig-Veda we see man's thoughts turned
> outwards, away from himself, to the world of the gods.  
>  12 "Buddhism directed man's search inwards to the potentiality
> hidden within himself.  
>  13. "In the Vedas we find prayer, praise, and worship.  
>  14. "In Buddhism for the first time we find training of the mind
> to make it act righteously."  
>  15. Winwood Reade says:  
>  16. "It is when we open the book of nature, it is when we read the
> story of evolution through millions of years, written in blood and
> tears, it is when we study the laws regulating life, the laws
> productive of development, that we see plainly how illusive is the
> theory that God is love.  
>  17. "In everything there is wicked, profligate, and abandoned
> waste. Of all animals that are born, only a very small percentage
> survives.  
>  18. "Eat and be eaten is the rule in the ocean, the air, the
> forest. Murder is the law of growth."  
>  19. This is what Reade says in his "Martyrdom of Man." How
> different is the Dhamma of the Buddha.  
>  20. This is what Dr. Ranjan Roy says:  
>  21. "Throughout the second half of the nineteenth century the
> three laws of conservation held sway. Nobody challenged them.  
>  22. "They were the laws of matter, mass and energy.  
>  23. "They were the trump cards of those idealists who cherished
> the thought of their being indestructible.  
>  24. "Nineteenth century scientists professed them as the governing
> factors of creation.  
>  25. "Nineteenth century scientists professed them as constituting
> the fundamental nature of the Universe.  
>  26. "They conceived that the Universe was filled with
> indestructible atoms.  
>  27. "Just as the nineteenth century was drawing to a close, Sir J.
> J. Thompson and his followers began to hammer the atoms.  
>  28. "Surprisingly enough the atoms began to break up into
> fragments.  
>  29. "These fragments came to be called electrons, all similar and
> charged with negative electricity.  
>  30. "Atoms hailed by Maxwell as imperishable foundation-stones of
> the Universe or Reality broke down.  
>  31. "They got broken into tiny particles, protons and electrons,
> charged with positive and negative electricity respectively.  
>  32. "The concept of a fixed unalterable mass abandoned Science for
> good. In this century the universal belief is that matter is being
> annihilated at every instant.  
>  33. "The Buddha's doctrine of Anicca (transitoriness) is
> confirmed.  
>  34. "Science has proved that the course of the Universe is a
> grouping and dissolution and regrouping.  
>  35. "The trend of Modern Science is the trend of an ultimate
> reality, unity, and diversity of ego.  
>  36. "Modern Science is the echoing of the Buddhists doctrines of
> transitoriness (annica) and of egolessness (anatta)."  
>  37. Mr. E. G. Taylor, in his "Buddhism and Modern Thought,"
> says:  
>  38. "Man has been ruled by external authority long enough. If he
> is to be truly civilised, he must learn to be ruled by his own
> principles. Buddhism is the earliest ethical system where man is
> called upon to have himself governed by himself.  
>  39. "Therefore a progressive world needs Buddhism to teach it this
> supreme lesson."  
>  40. The Reverend Leslie Bolton, unitarian minister, says:  
>  41. "I see in the spiritual psychology of Buddhism its most
> powerful contribution.  
>  42. "Unitarian Christians, like Buddhists, reject the external
> authority of church, books, or creeds, and find in man himself the
> guiding lamp.  
>  43. "Unitarians see in Jesus and Gautama noble exponents of the
> way of life."  
>  44. Prof. Dwight Goddard says:  
>  45. "Among the world's religious teachers, Buddha alone has the
> glory of having rightly judged the intrinsic greatness of man's
> capacity to work out his salvation without extraneous aid."  
>  46. "If the worth of a truly great man consists in his raising the
> worth of all mankind, who is better entitled to be called truly great
> than the Blessed One?  
>  47. "Who, instead of degrading him by placing another being over
> him, has exalted him to the highest pinnacle of wisdom and love."  
>  48. Mr. E. J. Mills, author of "Buddhism," says: "In no other
> religion are the values of knowledge and evil of ignorance so much
> insisted upon as they are in Buddhism."  
>  50. "No other religion lays so much stress upon keeping one's eyes
> open.  
>  51. "No other religion has formulated such deep laid plans for
> mental culture."  
>  52. Prof. W. T. Stace says in his "Buddhist Ethics":  
>  53. "The Buddhist moral ideal, the Arhat, had to be both morally
> and intellectually great.  
>  54. "He had to be a philosopher, as well as a man of good
> conduct.  
>  55. "Knowledge was always stressed by Buddhism as essential to
> Salvation, and ignorance as one of the two main causes of failure, to
> attain it (craving or attachment being the other).  
>  56. "On the contrary, knowledge has never been any part of the
> Christian ideal man."  
>  57. "Owing to the unphilosophical character of its founder, in the
> Christian Scheme of thought the moral side of man has been divorced
> from the intellectual side.  
>  58. "Far more of the world's misery is caused by stupidity and
> blind faith than by wickedness.  
>  59. "The Buddha did not allow this."  
>  60. Enough unto this, to show how great and how unique is the
> Buddha and his Dhamma.  
>  61. Who would not say, "Let such a one be our Master"?
>
>   
> ยง 2. A Vow to Spread His Dhamma
>
>  1." There are beings without limit,  
> Let us take the vow to convey them all across.  
>  2. There are depravities in us without number,  
> Let us take the vow to extinguish them all.  
>  3. There are truths without end,  
> Let us take the vow to comprehend them all.  
>  4. There is the Way of Buddha without comparison,  
> Let us take the vow to accomplish it perfectly."
>
> --Encyclopadia of Religion & Ethics, Vol. X, p. 168.
>
>   
> ยง 3. A Prayer for His Return to His Native Land
>
>  1. "O Exalted One! I trust myself whole-heartedly  
> To the Tathagata whose light pervades,  
> Without any impediment, the regions in the ten quarters,  
> And express my earnest desire to be born in Thy Land.  
>  2. In realising in vision the appearance of Thy Land,  
> I know that it surpasses all realms in the threefold existence.  
>  3. That it is like sky, embracing all,  
> Vast and spacious without boundaries.  
>  4. Thy mercy and compassion in accordance with the righteous
> way,  
> Is an outgrowth of the stock of merits (accumulated by Thee), which
> are beyond all worldly good;  
>  5. And Thy light permeates everywhere,  
> Like the mirrors of the Sun and the Moon.  
>  6. Let me pray that all beings, having been born there,  
> Shall proclaim the Truth, like Buddha Thyself.  
>  7. Herewith I write down this essay and utter these verses,  
> And pray that I could see Thee, O Buddha, face to face,  
>  8. And that I could, together with all my fellow-beings,  
> Attain the birth in the Land of Bliss."
