U. S. A.,  
*21st September, 1894*.

DEAR KIDI,

I am very sorry to hear your determination of giving up the world so
soon. The fruit falls from the tree when it gets ripe. So wait for the
time to come. Do not hurry. Moreover, no one has the right to make
others miserable by his foolish acts. Wait, have patience, everything
will come right in time. 

Yours with blessings,

VIVEKANANDA.
