6\) Legislature and Legislation

 a.) Legislature in its present sense is unknown to the Islamic
system. The religio-political system which is called *din-i-Islam* is a
complete system which contains in itself the mechanism for discovering
and applying law to any situation that may arise. During the Islamic
Republic there was no legislature in its modern sense; and for every
situation or emergency that arose, law could be discovered and applied
by the *ulama*. The law had been made and was not to be made, the only
function of those entrusted with the administration of law being to
discover the law for the purposes of the particular case, though.when
enunciated and applied it formed a precedent for others to follow.

It is wholly incorrect, as has been suggested from certain quarters,
that in a country like Pakistan, which consists of different
communities, Muslim and non-Muslim, and where representation is allowed
to non-Muslims with a right to vote on every subject that comes up, the
legislature is a form of *ijma'* or *ijtimad*, the reason being that
*ijtimad* is not collective but only individual, and though *ijma'* is
collective, there is no place in it for those who are not experts in the
knowledge of the law. This principle at once rules out the infidels
(*kuffar*) whether they be people of Scriptures (*ahl-i-kitab*) or
idolators (*mushrikeen*).

 b.) Since Islam is a perfect religion containing laws, express
or derivable by *ijma'* or *ijtihad*, governing the whole field of human
activity, there is in it no sanction for what. may, in the modern sense,
be called legislation. Questioned on this point, Maulana Abul Hasanat,
President, Jami'at-ul-Ulama-i-Pakistan, says: -Â­

> "Q.-- Is the institution of legislature as distinguished from the
> institution of a person or body of persons entrusted with the
> interpretation of law, an integral part of an Islamic State?  
> A.-- No. Our law is complete and merely requires interpretation by
> those who are experts in it. According to my belief no question can
> arise, the law relating to which cannot be discovered from the Qur'an
> or the *hadith*.  
> Q.-- Who were Sahib-ul-hall-i-wal-aqd?  
> A.-- They were the distinguished *ulama* of the time. These persons
> attained their status by reason of the knowledge of the law. They were
> not in any way analogous or similar to the legislature in modern
> democracy."

  
The same view was expressed by Amir-i-Shari'at Sayyid Ata Ullah Shah
Bukhari in one of his speeches reported in the "Azad" of 22nd April,
1947, in the course of which he said that our *din* is complete and
perfect, and that it amounts to *kufr* to make more laws.

Maulana Abul Ala Maudoodi, however, is of the opinion that legislation
in the true sense is possible in an Islamic State on matters which are
not covered by the Qur'an, the *sunna*, or previous *ijma'*, and he has
attempted to explain his point by reference to the institution of a body
of persons whom the Holy Prophet, and after him the *khulafa*, consulted
on all matters relating to affairs of State.

The question is one of some difficulty and great importance, because any
institution of legislature will have to be reconciled with the claim put
forward by Maulana Abu! Hasanat and some other religious divines that
Islam is a perfect and exhaustive code wide enough to furnish an answer
to any question that may arise relating to any human activity, and that
it does not know of any "unoccupied field" to be filled by fresh
legislation.

There is no doubt that Islam enjoins consultation, and that not only the
Holy Prophet but also the first four caliphs and even their successors
resorted to consultation with the leading men of the time who for their
knowledge of the law and piety could well be relied upon. In the inquiry
not much has been disclosed about the Majlis-i-Shura except what is
contained in Maulana Abul Ala Maudoodi's written statement which he
supplied to the Court at its request. That there was a body of men who
were consulted is true, but whether this was a standing body, and
whether its advice had any legal or binding force, seems somewhat
doubtful.

These men were certainly not elected in the modern way, though their
representative character cannot be disputed. Their advice was certainly
asked *ad hoc*, but that they were competent to make law as the modern
legislatures make laws is certainly not correct. The decisions taken by
them undoubtedly served as precedents and were in the nature of *ijma'*,
which is not legislation but the application of an existing law to a
particular case. When consulted in affairs of State, their functions
were truly in the nature of an advice given by a modern cabinet, but
such advice is not law but only a decision.

 c.) Nor can the legislature in a modern State correspond to
*ijma'* because, as we have already pointed out, the legislature
legislates while the *ulama* of Majlls-i-Shura who were called upon to
determine what should be the decision on a particular point which was
not covered by the Qur'an and the *sunna*, merely sought to discover and
apply the law, and not to promulgate the law, though the decision when
taken had to be taken not only for the purposes of the particular case
but for subsequent occasions as a binding precedent.

An intriguing situation might arise if the Constitution Act provided
that any provision of it, if it was inconsistent with the Qur'an or the
*sunna*, would be void, and the *intra vires* of a law made by the
legislature were questioned before the Supreme Court on the ground that
the institution of \[the\] legislature itself was contrary to the Qur'an
and the *sunna*.
