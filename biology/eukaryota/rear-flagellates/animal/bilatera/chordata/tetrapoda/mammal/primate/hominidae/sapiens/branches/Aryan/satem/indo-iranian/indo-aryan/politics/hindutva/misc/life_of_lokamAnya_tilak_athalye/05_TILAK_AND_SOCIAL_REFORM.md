weakness of reformers and dissidents of all kinds — he took 
infinite trouble to reduce those elements to the lowest possible 
points. Hence he was careful not to take up too many subjects 
at once, because, the antagonism generated by each, would have 
been made worse, by the antagonism to each other ; and he 
would have called up a host of enemies together, instead of 
leaving himself free to deal with one at a time.

The stagnant condition of the Indian civilisation 
during several centuries has given rise to a number 
of social evils which by their very accumulation impres- 
sed the imagination of the first generation of English- 
educated Indians. But these evils are neither more pres- 
sing nor more hideous than those which during the last 
three centuries have accompanied the rapid growth of 
European power and culture. The first duty of every 
country is to strengthen its position and consolidate its 
influence amidst neighbouring groups of nations with 
a view to safe-guard its political liberty which is the 
mother of all social well-being. Where this hberty is 
wanting, the duty of the people lies in recovering it

from those into whose hands it has fallen. But the 
Indian leaders in the first half of the 19th century 
failed to take note of this cardinal principle and the 
country, instead of pining for its lost independence 
was applauding the English as deliverers. Howsoever 
natural such an attitude might have been owing to 
the chaotic condition of things just before the 
British Conquest it cannot be too much deplored. 
For, relieved of the cares and responsibilities of 
political and international questions, the new leaders 
of the country attended to the next best thing, 
the condition of their society. In this attitude 
they were encouraged by their English and Anglo- 
Indian masters as well as by the zealous Mission- 
aries, who, too had an axe of their own to grind. Add 
to this the tendency of a fallen nation to be-little its 
own worth and admire the customs, manners, thoughts 
and institutions of the rulers. Knowing that they were 
a mere handful in the midst of crores of Indians, the 
English believed that unless they maintained very high 
prestige among Indians the Political domination of 
India was an impossibility and hence they appeared to 
us at their best, — strong, masterful, gifted with all the 
qualities of greatness. They were demigods amidst a 
race of mortals, giants ruling over pigmies and the very 
limited intercourse Indians could have with them com- 
pletely concealed from us their shortcomings. It is not 
surprising that in the psychological situation detailed 
above, Indian leaders, cut off from the moorings of 
National traditions mistook the unreal for the real, the 
accidental accompaniment for the substance. Cons- 
cious of their own impotence and anxious to lift up the 



TILAK AND SOCIAL REFORM 47 

country to a high level they could think of only one 
way, the complete Westernisation of India. English 
dress, English habits, even English diet and English 
life must, they thought, be imported into this country 
before we could think of replacing the English Bureau- 
crats. Ladies must learn, widows must remarry, castes 
must go, — all because we must be equal to our rulers in 
efficiency and strength. These early English-educated 
leaders advocated Social Reform with the same 
object with which Japan, nearly seventy years back 
threw away her crude military weapons in favour 
of the modern instruments of destruction. In short, 
love of imitation, loss of individuality, the glamour 
of the English civilisation and a fierce desire to get 
rid of India's inferiority, joined with the liberalising 
tendencies of the Western thought, ushered the era 
of Social Reform in India. 

As years passed by, the wildness of these reformers 
somewhat abated. But the central idea that possessed 
them was faithfully transmitted to the next genration. 
Even Ranade was obessed with the idea of getting, so 
to speak a certificate from the rulers about the equal 
social status of the Indians. In all the social programme 
he has left us, we do not come accross a single item 
wherein he has departed from the English model. The 
idea that the English were Heaven-sent trustees of this 
country dominated Indian thought in his days also and 
it was believed that once the English had to concede 
that Indians had socially advanced up to their level 
political rights could not, with decency, be refused. It 
was Vishnushastri Chiploonkar, who gave a rude shock 
to this blind optimism and declared that if Indian 



48 LOKAMANYA TILAK 

Society was to grow, it could only develop on its own 
lines. His scathing criticism of the degenerate Social 
Reformers of the day created a new epoch of social and 
political thought and during all his eventful career, 
Mr. Tilak did not much depart from the lines laid down 
by his master. Mr. Tilak was essentially a Puritan of 
Puritans and so was in a sense more fitted to lead Social 
Reform than many of the so-called Reformers ; but 
being more a man of action than of thought he prefer- 
red to concentrate on the political issue. 

** Was Mr. Tilak a Social Reformer "? The question 
can be correctly answered only by knowing which re- 
forms he approved of and which ' reforms ' he con- 
demned. He favoured foreign travel but insisted on 
teetotalism and vegetarian diet. He applauded re- 
marriages of child-widows ; but laid stress on the proper 
performance of the Vedic rites. He was for female edu- 
cation but wanted it to be both useful and ornamental. 
He tolerated inter-dining but only on occasions of neces- 
sity. He wanted sub-castes to intermarry before he 
could favour the larger question of intercaste marriages. 
He advocated adult marriages but disliked the predo- 
minantly materialistic nature of Western marriages. 
He wanted the badge of untouchability to be removed 
but would be no party to hasty and fanatical measures 
that would only retard the improvement of the social 
life of the ' depressed ' classes. He was for a policy oi 
open door to all classes and creeds. Drink he abhored, 
also sexual vice. He wished our reformers to actively 
combat these evils by strenuous propaganda. Reform 
he wanted, but genuine reform and not apish imita- 
tion of Western life and manners. 



TILAK AND SOCIAL REtCRM 49 

His ideal of a Social Reformer was a Buddha, a Kabir 
or a Tukaram. The leader of the Social Reform move- 
ment must essentially be a man of peace. He must be 
a lover of Indian civilisation and culture and must pro- 
ceed to reform society with due respect for the tradi- 
tions of the society itself. He must not only be of our 
society but must live in it. He must be bold enough 
to break those bonds that have outlived their utility ; 
but at the same time he must be calm enough 
not to harm his cause by abusive language. He 
must be a " stalwart Puritan man, battling for the 
right, trustful but not elated, serious but not de- 
jected." He should make his way through mis- 
understandings, opposition and persecution by sheer 
force of truth, love and courage. 

But the Social Reform movement of Mr. Tilak's 
youthful days did not conform to this ideal. It was 
essentially a child of the Western civilisation ; it had 
its origin in callous disregard of the past. It ignored 
the study of the fundamental basis of Indian Society. 
It was not discriminating. It was largely imitative. 
It sought to copy Western life and institutions. The 
leaders were weak, halting and inconsistent ; the fol- 
lowers had nothing in them but sound and fury. Sus- 
tained enthusiasm and sterling sacrifice were woefully 
at a discount. It was a movement which claimed, 
first priority to and later on equal status with the poli- 
tical movement and sought radically to reconstruct our 
society without taking note of the traditions of the 
past or the insufficient materials available in the pre- 
sent. Such an artificial and indiscriminating move- 
ment, launched by a handful of fanatics simultaneously 
4 



50 LOKAMANYA TILAK 

with the National Congress excited Mr. Tilak's liveliest 
opposition ; and for a few years he was engaged in rele- 
gating the movement to its normal plane and not allow- 
ing it to usurp the chief attention of the country. 

Ever since 1S34, the ' irrepressible and audacious * 
Mr. Malbari had been trying to raise the age of marriage 
of Hindu girls. The field of his activity covered not 
only the length and breadth of India but the United 
Kingdom of Great Britain also, whence he brought con- 
siderable pressure to bear on the then Viceroy and his 
Council to consider his proposals some of which were as 
follows : — 

(i) Cohabitation by a husband with his wife, under 
twelve years of age, should be made penal. 

(2) In cases of infant-marriages, the wife should be 

entitled to cancel the marriage, if she liked, on 
attaining majority. 

(3) Suits by husbands for the restitution of conju- 

gal rights should not be allowed. , 

(4) A widow should continue to hold her first hus- 

band's property even after her remarriage. 
These and other proposals struck at the very root of 
Hindu Society and nullified at one stroke the sanctity 
and indissoiubiUty of the marriage-tie. They, there- 
fore caused intense alarm ; and when it was known 
that a Bill to raise the " Age of Consent " from 
10 (Vide Sec. 375 of the Indian Penal Code) to 12 
was in contemplation not only the orthodox people 
but some of those who were pronounced Social 
Reformers resented this legislative interference. It 
was generally believed, though without reason and 
in spite of the Government's assurance to the 



TILAK AND SOCIAL REFORM $1 

contrary, that the introduction of this Bill was 
only the thin end of the wedge and that the 
whole of Mr. Malabari's programme was likely to re- 
ceive legislative sanction. Mr. Tilak's opposition to 
this Bill has been severely criticised. We should re- 
member, however, that amongst those who diaspproved 
of this Bill, can be seen the names of the late Sir Romesh 
Chander Mitter, the late Mr. W. C. Banerjea, the late 
Sir T. Madhavarao, Babu (now Hoa. Sir) Surendranath 
Banerjea, Mr. (Hon. Dr. Sir) Chimanlal H. Setalwad 
and Mr. (now Hon. Mr.) G. S. Khaparde. Mr. Tilak's 
attitude was guided by strong common sense. He 
challenged the right of a foreign Bureaucracy to sit in 
legislative judgment on the Indian society. He denied 
the necessity of the measure and the extent of the evil 
which he was sure would be eradicated by increasing 
education. He led a vigorous agitation, which there 
is reason to believe convinced the Government of the 
day of the unwisdom of its step ; the fetish of prestige, 
however steeled the Governments' determination to 
get the BiU passed (19th March 189 1). The Govern- 
ment even preferred* "to be wrong with Prof. Bhan- 
darkar, Mr. Justice Telang and Dewan Bahdur Raghu- 
nath Rao, than to be right with Pandit Sasadhar and 
Prof. Tilak." The impression which Mr. Tilak made, in 
those eventful months marked him out as the ** coming 
man". The merciless logic and the vast knowledge 
with which he exposed the fallacies and sophistries of 
the Reformers in his " long and scholarly " letters 
to the Times of India were universally admired and 
the extent to which he succeeded in organising 

* From the speech of Sir A. R. Scoble (Law Member), 



52 LOKAMANYA TILAK 

public opinion enabled him to pass a resolution 
in the Bombay Provincial Conference (May 1891) 
regretting that the Government did not properly 
respect the public opinion on the "Age of Consent 
Bill." It is worth noting that the leaders of the 
Keform Party who were present at the Conference 
dared not oppose the resolution moved by Mr. Tilak. 
Mr. Tilak was not merely a destructive critic. He 
showed the way in which the Bill could be made accept- 
able to the Orthodox party. He suggested that the 
attainment of puberty should be made the legal age for 
the consummation of marriage. Had this compromise 
been accepted there would have been no trouble. But 
neither the Governm.ent nor the leading Reformers 
were in a conciliatory mood. Mr. Tilak about this 
time (26th October 1890) put forth one suggestion which 
shows the sincerity of his faith in genuine social reform. 
He disapproved of general legislation as the masses 
were not prepared for the same. But he welcomed 
resort to legislation as a binding force to those who be- 
lieved in reforms. His proposals were as follows : — 
(i) & (2) Girls and boys should not be married until 

they have reached the age of 16 and 2a 

respectively. 
(3) & (4) Unless they are prepared to marry 

v/idows, men should not marry after they 

are 40 years old. 

(5) There should be absolute prohibition of liquor. 

(6) Acceptance of dowry in marriages should be 

prohibited. 

(7) Disfigurement of widows should be forthwith 

stopped. 



TILAK AND SOCIAL REFORM 53 

(8) One-tenth of the monthly income of every re- 
former should be devoted to public purposes. 
Neither Ranade nor Agarkar were willing to bind 
themselves with this pledge. However, on Nov. ist 
1890, a meeting was held under the presidency of the 
late Hon. Rao Bahadur Nulkar to consider Mr. Tilak s 
proposals. At this meeting where both Mr. Ranade and 
Prof. (Dr. Sir) Bhandarkar were present, Mr. Tilak de- 
livered a speech which deserves to be recorded. He 
said — " There has been much tall talk but little action 
regarding social reform, with the result that even those 
reforms, the vital need of which has been generally ad- 
mitted have not been carried out into practice. We 
must not only see what reforms are required, but also 
whether and how far they are practicable and how 
they can be made popular ; for in reforming society, 
care ought to be taken to avoid the creation of any 
gulf between the people on the one hand and the refor- 
mers on the other. We must always carry public opi- 
nion with us ; and this can be done, inter alia, by secur- 
ing for our reforms the sanction of religion. I am in 
favour of Social Reform." He then discussed his 8 
points and wound up by saying that modifications 
might here and there be made in his scheme and then 
the whole be made binding on its supporters by calling 
in legislative sanction. Legislation, he urged should 
bind the reformers only and not the masses. Mr. 
Ranade welcomed Mr. Tilak's speech but expressed his 
doubt as to how many people would come forward to 
bind themselves legally to carry out the reforms 
proposed in the 8 points. He said that there 
were 4 classes of social reformers (i) Those who look to 



54 LOKAMANYA TILAK 

religious leaders for support, (2) Those who wanted ta 
avail themselves of caste-unions, (3) Those who were 
willing to accept legislation for themselves and (4) 
Those w*ho wanted legislation applicable to all. He 
concluded by saying that as Mr. Tilak had fairly ad- 
vanced up to the third stage, there was very little- 
difference between himself and Mr. Tilak. 

What, then, was the difference between the school of 
thought represented by Mr. Ranade and that represent- 
ed by Mr. Tilak ? For difference — vital difference — 
there was, in spite of Mr. Ranade's attempt to 
emphasise the points of agreement. The difference 
was this that while Ranade was prepared, if con- 
venient, to coquette with religious sanction to 
social reform, Mr. Tilak insisted that there should 
be no divorce between the two. The former wanted 
to utilise, for the propagation of his ideas, the 
disintegrating forces that had come in the 
wake of the English conquest ; the latter while 
emphatically not unfriendly to social reform, believed 
in the imperative necessity of checking, from the larger 
national standpoint, the disintegrating forces by fos^ 
tering a due sense of pride in and respect for the social 
and religious institutions of the people. The former 
depended solely on Western influence and thought; 
Mr. Tilak was for the blending of the old culture and the 
new. The former welcomed State-interference in mat- 
ters social, the latter strongly resented it for the simple 
reason that reform to be durable must be a growth from 
within. Differing thus in their outlook, it is not sur- 
prising that while Ranade was prepared to associate 
and work with wild and reckless people, people who^ 



TILAK AMD SOCIAL REFORM 55 

were the very negation of qualities required for the Social 
Reformer— gentleness, patience, tact, forbearance, and 
sweetness, Mr. Tilak was gradually convinced of the 
futility of sccial reform as it was then propagated 
and was for the above reason compelled to adopt 
first an attitude of constructive opposition and then 
of neutrality. No ' petti-fogging motives of policy/ 
no consideration of winning cheap popularity by 
' pandering to public prejudices ' determined his atti- 
tude. 

Looking back at the controversy from a distance of 
30 years, what, after all has been the net result of this 
much-debated measure ? Under the combined influ- 
ence of increasing education and economic conditions 
and not certainly as a result of the passing of the Bill, 
the age of marriage has gone up, making the law practi- 
cally a dead letter. Only bitter feelings have been 
created, feelings which have widened the gulf be- 
tween the Orthodox and the Reformers and frus- 
trated Mr. Tilak's attempts to bring about a 
social Reform that would not run counter to the reli- 
gious and patriotic susceptibilities of the people. It 
is with pain that one recalls the rowdy scenes that 
unfortunately marred a meeting convened by the 
Reformers at the Kreeda Bhuwan (25th Feb. 1891). 
These scenes, it is still more regrettable to observe, so 
enraged a venerable and learned Reformer that he 
telegraphed to the Times of India insinuating that 
Messrs. Tilak and Namjoshi were at the bottom of the 
mischief. Subsequently a notice was served upon the 
Times of India (2nd Mar. 189 1) and the Reformers 
ceased to persist in the insinuation. They, however 



56 LOKAMANYA TILAK 

prosecuted five persons for rioting, all of whom were 
acquitted by the Magistrate. (23rd Mar. 1891). 

While the ashes of the * Age of Consent ' controversy 
were still hot, another episode, still less important 
widened the breach between Mr. Tilak and the Refor- 
mers. Mrs. Ramabai — that enterprising Indian Chris- 
tian lady — had, by her untiring efforts in America, col- 
lected funds for the establishment of a Resident School 
for Indian girls, especially widows. Mr. Tilak, did not 
at all approve of the idea of a school for Indian girls 
managed by a Christian lady ; but knowing full well 
that the Reformers could not command the necessary 
sacrifice and organising capacity, he reluctantly enrolled 
his name among the sympathisers of the institution, 
after satisfying himself that only secular education 
would be imparted in the school. When, however, he 
read in the Illustrated Christian Weekly of New York 
(21st Dec. 1889) ^^^^ there were about four students 
in the school studying Christianity or attending Chris- 
tian prayers in a Church, he indignantly asked what 
became of Mrs. Ramabai's pledge that the school 
would strictly remain secular in its character. 
Mrs. Ramabai protested and explained the circum- 
stances under which her four students were receiving 
Christian training. The Advisory Committee consist- 
ing of men like Mr. Ranade and Dr. Bhandarkar 
took Mrs. Ramabai to task and asked her to 
confine herself to secular education. Mrs. Ramabai 
had to yield for a time. But she soon 
threw overboard the Advisory Committee by 
managing to secure for herself plenary powers from the 
Head Office in America. This was the moment when 



TILAK AND SOCIAL REFORM 57 

the advisory Committee ought to have spoken out its 
mind in unmistakable terms and withdrawn, by means 
of resignation its moral support from the institution. 
But the members wanted to outwit Mrs. Ramabai and 
get a reversal of their decision from the American Head 
Office ; this was an impossibility, as the Head Office had 
implicit trust in Mrs. Ramabai and it was supplying 
funds to her mainly for the propagation of Christianity. 
Mr. Ranade and his followers had therefore to play a 
game of dissimulation ; for they knew that once the 
public faith in Mrs. Ramabai was shattered, nothing 
could rehabilitate it. It was here that they had a 
tussle with Mr. Tilak. From the middle of 1891 to the 
close of 1893, this was one of the burning topics of the 
day. The taunting and violent way in which papers 
like the Subodh Patrika and Agarkar's Sudharak fell foul 
of Mr. Tilak is the more remarkable when we remember 
how they must have realised their double game. Why 
should they all have clung up to Mrs. Ramabai, so un- 
reasonably, so fanatically ? Could they not have 
started an institution of their own, under some trust- 
worthy management ? Did they think that female 
education, even attended with grave risks of conver- 
sion to Christianity was so necessary ? Apparently 
they did not, for on Aug. 13th, 1893, they publicly dis- 
owned all connection with the institution because it was 
^'conducted as an avowedly proselytizing institution"*. 
They admitted that " during the past year or so, Pandita 
Ramabai departed from the lines of strict neutrality "; 
In trying, therefore to screen Pandita Ramabai from the

tion, located at Kedgaon near Poona. 



58 LOKAMANYA TILAK 

righteous indignation of the public, they succeeded in 
making (he cause of reform more unpopular and the 
breach between the Orthodox and the Reform parties 
still wider. 

The same fateful year (1890) which witnessed the 
origin of the Age of Consent controversy and the 
SJiarada-Sadana episode was marked by the com- 
mencement of a dispute still more ridiculous — a 
veritable storm in a tea cup. The responsibihty of 
this dispute rests not with the Reformers but with 
the Orthodox party at Foona, the fanatical and 
foolish self-stj'led leaders of which charged 42 
persons including Ranade, Tilak and Gokhale with 
having taken tea (Oct. 4th 1S90), at the residence of a 
Missionary with the deliberate object of breaking caste 
and in the following two years (1891-92) this suit of 
the Orthodox party against these 42 gentlemen in the 
Court of Shree Shankaracharya was the principle sub- 
ject of heated public controversy. The Reformers con- 
gratulated themselves on having an ally in Mr. Trlak 
whose resourceful Sanskrit scholarship stood them in 
good stead and helped them in getting very light punish- 
ment from the religious tribunal. It is noteworthy that 
Ranade thought it in no way humiliating to submit to 
the decision of the Court and for this conduct he was 
severely criticised by both the Orthodox and the Re- 
form parties (the latter included some of his own ardent 
followers). Mr. Tilak justified the taking of Pray ash- 
chitia, and said that in such matters it is the duty of us 
all to be actuated by a spirit of compromise. He said 
** There is considerable resemblance between our diffi- 
culties in the Political field and those in the Social one J 



TILAK AND SOCIAL REFORM 59 

neither the political asdministration nor the structure 
of our society completely satisfies us. We want to 
reform both. The English administration as well as 
the Indian society have solid foundations; we are, there- 
fore, bound to proceed with caution. Now, if people 
are willing to accept Political Reforms in a spirit of 
conciliation and compromise we fail to understand why 
we should like to proceed with Social Reform in an 
arrogant and defiant manner. If we are prepared to 
make compromise when the Parliament passes the 
Council's Act, 1892, why should we not do so with res- 
pect to questions likes widow-remarriage ? Fanatical 
opposition might occassionally be successful, but as a 
rule, in political as well as social matters, fanaticism is 
suicidal " {Kesari 7th June 1892). 

It will be news to this generation, accustomed to take 
for granted Mr. Tilak's hostility or indifference to Social 
Reform, that not only did he attend Social Confer- 
ences but also took active part in the proceedings. In 
the 4th Social Conference, held at Calcutta, (Dec. 1890), 
Mr. Tilak moved an amendment to a Resolution pro- 
posed by the late Mr. R. N, Mudholkar. The resolu- 
tion condemned child-marriages and advocated adult- 
marriages. Mr. Tilak, who whole-heartedly supported 
the proposition wanted to delete an incorrect reference 
to the Shastras. In the Social Conference of 1891, held 
at Nagpur, Mr. Tilak suggested a bold amendment to 
the Resolution which advocated widow remarriages and 
called upon people to help the movement by doing their 
utmost. "How are the people to help "? asked Mr. 
Tilak. He said that mere lip-sympathy for widow 
remarriages would not do. These who sympathised 



-60 LOKAMANYA TILAK 

with the cause ought to show their sympathy by attend- 
ing not only the marriage-ceremony but the marriage 
feasts also. But the diplomatic leaders of the Confer- 
ence, the professions of some of whom considerably 
differed from practice, wriggled themselves out of the 
difficulty, by adding the words " so far as possible " to 
" help the movement ." To the resolution advocating 
sea- voyage, Mr. Tilak moved an amendment which laid 
stress upon vegetarian diet and Prayaschitta. He was 
supported by Pandit Mad an Mohan Malaviya. 

In 1889, the Social Reform leaders issued a circular 
together with printed copies of pledges which persons 
who believed in Social Reform had to sign. The cir- 
cular expressly declared that the idea of resort to legis- 
lation, in matters social, was definitely given up. So 
Mr. Tilak gladly associated himself with this movement 
led by Ranade and other leading Reformers of the 
Bombay Presidency. But when the Government, 
showed their willingness to introduce the " Age of 
Consent Bill ", the leaders of Social Reform did not 
hesitate to go back on their pledged word. The Social 
Conference of 1889 decided — altogether without con- 
sulting the signatories to the pledge — that the pledge 
bound not themselves alone but their children and exe- 
cutors as well ! ! ! Mr. Tilak was utterly disgusted 
with such ridiculous resolutions. He admitted that the 
disfigurement of widow was unjustifiable but he had 
nothing but contempt and ridicule for those who seri- 
ously brought forward a resolution in the Conference 
requesting Government to make penal the disfigure- 
ment of widows. Such childish, perverse and un- 
reasonable conduct was in his opinion extremely 



TILAK AND SOCIAL REFORM. 6r 

prejudical fo the cause itself. The greatest defect 
in the movement was, Mr. Tilak declared, want of 
courage and wand of sincerity. There was much 
empty noise. Nothing could be gained, he thought, 
by holding National Social Conferences. There 
was no country in the world, which resorted 
to such general condemnation of its customs and 
manners. Moreover, there are so many different 
castes and creeds in India that, excepting a very 
few common points, each section of the community 
must proceed in its own way along the path of 
reform. x\ll reform is a growth from within and 
unless the people are sufficiently prepared by due 
assimilation of liberal ideas if is useless to march 
ahead. It was no use running the Social Conference 
on the lines of the National Congress. The latter 
was a deliberative assembly and could not be 
otherwise in the present circumstances. But it devolved 
upon the Reformers to appeal more to the people than 
to the Government. Action and not mere speech was 
the need of the day. A vigorous educative propaganda 
must be carried on. We must proceed step by step 
along the lines of least resistance ; and above aU the 
Reformers must in no way hurt the general pride of the 
people in their Social life and institutions. In the 
atmosphere of political serfdom, there are countless 
things that make us conscious of our weakness. What 
we want is self-confidence ; and all reform that tends 
to make the nation more conscious of its shortcomings 
than of its strength, is not only undesirable but is posi- 
tively mischievous. 

It will thus be seen there was something more than 



62 LOKAMANYA TILAK 

mere Opportunism behind Mr. Tilak's attitude towards 
Social Reform nearly 30 years ago. It has been said 
that since his return from Mandalay he showed a broad- 
er outlook and he did not hesitate to assimilate " the 
more Catholic tendencies " of the time. But a careful 
perusal of the preceding pages will show that, even in 
his younger days, Mr. Tiiak was a Social Reformer. 
His declaration of sympathy with the depressed classes, 
made on the eve of his departure to England was much 
appreciated. Here again Mr. Tilak's ideas about the 
best v/ay of effecting reform prevented him from sign- 
ing the manifesto which pledged the signatories to take 
every opportunity of breaking the bonds of untoucha- 
bility. Mr. Tilak was no believer in violent Social 
Reform. Regarding the Patel-marriage-Bill, though 
he was in favour of some such legislation, he 
believed the Bill to be untimely and against the basic 
principles of the Hindu religion and society. Had he 
lived for a decade more, the country would have seen 
him playing the role of an active Social Legislator in 
the new Councils. In his youth, parasitical Social 
Reform was blended with lukewarm political spirit. 
Mr. Tilak gave a rub to both and became, in spite of an 
unpleasant episode the leader of the Orthodox Party 
in social as well as political matters. He lived, how- 
ever to claim amongst his followers, persons of all castes
