### (*Iowa State Register* December 3, 1893)

Swami Vivekananda, the Hindu monk, spoke three times in Des Moines.
During his stay in the city, which was happily prolonged by the
cancellation of engagements farther west, Vivekananda met many of the
best people in the city, who found their time well spent discussing
religious and metaphysical questions with him. But it was woe to the man
who undertook to combat the monk on his own ground, and that was where
they all tried it who tried it at all. His replies came like flashes of
lightning, and the venturesome questioner was sure to be impaled on the
Indian’s shining intellectual lance. The workings of his mind, so subtle
and so brilliant, so well stored and so well trained, sometimes dazzled
his hearers, but it was always a most interesting study. He said nothing
unkind, for his nature would not permit that. Those who came to know him
best found him the most gentle and loveable of men, so honest, frank,
and unpretending, always grateful for the many kindnesses that were
shown him. Vivekananda and his cause found a place in the hearts of all
true Christians.
