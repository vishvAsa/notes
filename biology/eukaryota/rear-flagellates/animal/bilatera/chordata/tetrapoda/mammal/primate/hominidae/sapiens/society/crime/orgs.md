## Intro
Sometimes criminals form organizations with internal rules and hierarchies. Organization may vary from loose to tight. Big criminal organizations, based on their geographic origin and organization, can be classified into Mafia (Sicily), 'Ndranghetta (Calabria), Yakuza (Japan), Triad (China), Mexican cartels, Columbian cartels and others. Sometimes, as in the case of Yakuza, they are semi-open.

Some avoid particular endeavours - like drugs.

## Administration
In order to guard against prosecution by maintaining plausible deniability, orders are often passed down through a strict hierarchy. Usually, core/ initiated members are required to belong to a particular ethnic group.

In case of American Mafia, the organization is: Godfather/ boss, underboss, consigliore, varios capos, soldiers under them, and finally uninitiated 'associates'.

### Recruitment
#### (De)Motivations
Young adult males are often attracted to organized crime/ ganglife due to the easy money, respect of peers, feared status in the local community and a sense of belonging.

## Code
Secrecy and discreetion is often important.
