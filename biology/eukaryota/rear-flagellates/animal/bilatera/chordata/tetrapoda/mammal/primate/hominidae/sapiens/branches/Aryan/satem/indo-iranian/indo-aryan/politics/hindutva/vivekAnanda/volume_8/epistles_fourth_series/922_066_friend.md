*To Mr. E. T. Sturdy*

RIDGELY MANOR,  
*29th December, 1895*.

DEAR FRIEND,

By this time the copies of the lectures must have reached you. Hope they
may be of some use.

I think, in the first place, there are so many difficulties to overcome;
in the second place, they think that they are fit for nothing — that is
the national disease; thirdly, they are afraid to face the winter at
once; the Tibet man they don't think is a very strong man to work in
England. Some one will come sooner or later.

Yours in the *Sat*,

VIVEKANANDA.

PS. My Christmas greetings to all our friends — to Mrs. and Mr. Johnson,
to Lady Margesson, Mrs. Clark, Miss Hawes, Miss Müller, Miss Steel, and
all the rest. — V.

Kiss baby for me and bless him. My greetings to Mrs. Sturdy. We will
*work*. "Wah guru ki fateh." — V.
