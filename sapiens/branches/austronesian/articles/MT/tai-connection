After IE, the Austronesian language family is another for which a fairly good linguistic history that aligns with other material sources exists. The genetic evidence supports an origin of the expansion that reached NZ & Hawaii on one end & Madagascar and Taiwan on the other.

But how did they reach Taiwan? The evidence here adds to the growing body of linguistic & other genetic studies that they emerged in South East Asia in the vicinity of the Tai-Kadai language family. Thus a deep Tai-Kadai-Austronesian connection appears to be well supported. 

We don't have such a family for IE, though some have proposed a deep link to Uralic. But the situation there might be more complicated due to the multiple admixtures leading to the earlier IE peoples (Indo-Hittite to be precise) unless we accept the southern arc hypothesis. 

Thus, this might be one case where the genetics leads us to strengthen and inter-family relationship.
