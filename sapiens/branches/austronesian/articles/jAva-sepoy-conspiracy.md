The East India Company's army faced a Sepoy Conspiracy in Java (then Dutch East Indies), after the invasion of the island in 1811 by EIC. The Hindu sepoys of The Bengal Army stationed in Yogyakarta in 1815, inspired by the Hindu-Buddhist rituals of the Surakarta court and the glory of the Javanese temples of Prambanan and Borobodur planned a revolt against the British. This plot was conjured with the help of Pakubuwono IV, ruler of Sukarta in Java. The sepoys planned to kill all the British officers, overthrow European power, and install a Bengali administration over the whole island. The ruler of Surakarta took an avid interest in the Hindu sepoys and would attend puja with them, who prayed to Javanese idols, which likely had not seen worship in centuries. The plan never came to fruition as Napoleonic Wars ended and Java returned to the Dutch in 1816. 

British East Indian administrator and founder of the port city of Singapore, Sir Stamford Raffles stated that this revolt would ultimately have led to the re-establishment of Hinduism in Java and the expulsion of European power.
