A New Perspective on Our African Homeland

The recognition that Africa is central to the human story has, paradoxically, distracted attention from the last fifty thousand years of its prehistory. The intensive study of what happened in Africa before fifty thousand years ago is motivated by a universal recognition of the importance of the Middle to Later Stone Age transition in Africa and the Middle to Upper Paleolithic transition at the doorstep of Africa, those great leaps forward in recognizably modern human behavior attested to in the archaeological record. However, scholars have shown limited interest in Africa after this period. When I go to talks, a common slip of the tongue is that “we left Africa,” as if the protagonists of the modern human story must be followed to Eurasia. The mistaken impression is that once Africa gave birth to the ancestral population of non-Africans, the African story ended, and the people who remained on the continent were static relics of the past, jettisoned from the main plot, unchanging over the last fifty thousand years.

The contrast between the richness of the information we currently have about the human story in Eurasia over the last fifty thousand years and the dearth of information about Africa over the same period is extraordinary. In Europe, where most of the research has been done, archaeologists have documented a detailed series of cultural transformations: from Neanderthals to pre-Aurignacian modern humans, to Aurignacians, to Gravettians, to the people who practiced Mesolithic culture, and then to Stone Age farmers and their successors in the Copper, Bronze, and Iron ages. The ancient DNA revolution—which has disproportionately sampled bones from Eurasia and especially from Europe—has further widened the gap in our understanding of the prehistory of Africa compared to that of Eurasia.

But of course, what all investigations that scratch below the surface show is that the people “left behind” in Africa changed just as much as the descendants of the people who emigrated. The main reason we don’t know as much about the modern human story in Africa is lack of research. Human history over the last tens of thousands of years in Africa is an integral part of the story of our species. Focusing on Africa as the place where our species originated, while it might seem to highlight the importance of Africa, paradoxically does Africa a disservice by drawing attention away from the question of how populations that remained in Africa got to be the way they are today. With ancient and modern DNA, we can rectify this.



The Deep Mixture That Formed Modern Humans

In 2012, Sarah Tishkoff and her colleagues studied the biological impact of archaic admixture on the genomes of present-day Africans without access to ancient genomes like those of Neanderthals and Denisovans that had been used to document interbreeding between archaic and modern humans in Eurasia.1

Tishkoff and her colleagues sequenced genomes from some of the most diverse populations of Africa and analyzed their data to search for a pattern that is predicted when there has been interbreeding with archaic humans: very long stretches of DNA that have a high density of differences compared to the great majority of other genomes, consistent with an origin in a highly divergent population that was isolated until recently from modern humans.2 When they applied this approach to present-day non-Africans, they pulled out stretches of DNA that they found were nearly exact matches to the Neanderthal sequence. Tishkoff and her colleagues also found long stretches of deeply divergent sequences in present-day Africans whose ancestors did not mix with Neanderthals. Since Neanderthals have contributed little if any ancestry to Africans, this was likely to have been the result of mixture with mystery African archaic humans—ghost populations whose genomes have not yet been sequenced.

Jeffrey Wall and Michael Hammer, using the same types of genetic signatures, attempted to learn something about the relationship of the archaic populations to present-day Africans.3 They estimated that the archaic population separated from the ancestors of present-day humans in Africa about seven hundred thousand years ago and remixed around thirty-five thousand years ago, contributing about 2 percent of the ancestry of some present-day African populations. However, it is important to view these dates and estimated proportions of mixture with caution because of uncertainties about the rate at which mutations occur in humans and because of the limited amount of data Wall and Hammer analyzed.

The possibility of admixture between modern and archaic humans in sub-Saharan Africa is exciting, and there are even human remains from West Africa dating to as late as eleven thousand years ago with archaic features, providing skeletal evidence in support of the idea that archaic and modern human populations coexisted in Africa until relatively recently.4 Thus, there were ample opportunities for interbreeding with archaic humans as modern humans expanded in Africa, just as in Eurasia.

If the proportion of admixture with archaic African humans was only around 2 percent as Wall and Hammer estimated, it is likely to have had only a modest biological effect, similar to the effect of the contribution of Neanderthals and Denisovans to the genetic makeup of present-day people outside Africa. However, this does not rule out the possibility of major mixture events in deep African history. The best evidence for deep mixture of modern human populations in sub-Saharan Africa comes from the frequencies of mutations. One generation after a mutation occurs, it is extremely rare as it is present in only a single person. In subsequent generations, the mutation’s frequency fluctuates upward or downward at random, depending on the number of offspring to which it happens to be transmitted. Most mutations never achieve a substantial frequency, as at some point the few individuals carrying them happen not to transmit them to their children, causing them to fluctuate down to 0 percent frequency and disappear forever.

The effect of this constant pumping into the population of rare new mutations is that there are expected to be fewer common than rare mutations in a population. The frequencies of mutations that are variable in a population are in fact expected to follow an inverse law, with twice as many mutations that occur at 10 percent frequency as those that occur at 20 percent frequency, and twice as many of these in turn as those that occur at 40 percent frequency.

My colleague Nick Patterson tested this expectation, focusing on mutations present in a large sample of individuals from the Yoruba group of Nigeria that were also present in the Neanderthal genome.5 Patterson’s focus on mutations present in Neanderthals was clever; he knew that mutations discovered in this way were almost certainly frequent in the common ancestral population of humans and Neanderthals, and by implication in their descendants too. Mathematically, the expectation that such mutations would be common is exactly counterbalanced by the inverse law, with the result that mutations meeting these criteria are expected to be equally distributed across all frequencies.

But the real data showed a different pattern. When Patterson examined sequences from present-day Yoruba, he observed a greatly elevated rate of mutations both at very high and low frequencies, instead of an equal distribution across all frequencies. This “U-shaped” distribution of mutation frequencies is what would be expected in the case of ancient mixture. After two populations separate, random frequency fluctuation occurs in each population, so that the mutations that fluctuate by chance to 0 percent or 100 percent frequency in one population are by and large not expected to be the same as those that do so in the other population. When the populations then remix, the mutations that rose to extreme frequencies in one population but not in the other would be reintroduced as variable genetic types. This would produce peaks of extra mutation density in the mixed population. The first peak corresponding to mutations that rose to extreme frequencies in the first population is expected to start at the proportion of mixture, while the second peak corresponding to mutations that rose to extreme frequencies in the second population is expected to start at 100 percent minus the proportion of mixture. This is exactly the pattern that Patterson found, and he showed that it could be explained if Yoruba descended from a mixture of two highly differentiated human populations in close to equal proportions.

Patterson tested whether the patterns he observed were consistent with a model in which only Yoruba descend from this mixture but non-Africans do not. But this was contradicted by the data. Instead, all non-Africans—and even divergent African lineages such as San hunter-gatherers—also seem to be descended from a similar mixture. Thus, although Patterson had begun by looking at West Africans, the mixture event he detected was not specific to that population. Rather, it seemed to be a shared event in the ancestry of present-day humans, suggesting that the mixture may have occurred close to the time when anatomically modern human features first appear in the skeletal record after around three hundred thousand years ago.6

Patterson’s findings resonated with a discovery from the 2011 study by Heng Li and Richard Durbin \(discussed in part I\) that reconstructed human population size history from a single person’s genome.7 That study compared the genome sequence a person gets from his or her mother to the sequence he or she gets from his or her father. It found fewer locations in the genome where the reconstructed age of the shared ancestor falls between 400,000 and 150,000 years ago than would be expected if the population had been constant in size.8 One possible explanation for this result is that the ancestral population of all modern humans was very large over this period, which would mean that the probability that any two genomes today share a particular ancestor at this time is small \(there being many possible ancestors in each generation\). But the other possibility was that the ancestral human population consisted of multiple highly divergent groups instead of a single, freely mixing group, and hence the lineages ancestral to present-day people were isolated in separate populations at this time. This pattern could be reflecting the same mixture event that Patterson had highlighted through his study of mutation frequencies. The reconstructed time corresponds to a period when there is skeletal evidence of archaic human forms overlapping with modern human forms in Africa. For example, the *Homo naledi* skeletons recently discovered in a cave in South Africa had relatively modern human bodies but brains much smaller than those of modern humans, and date to between 340,000 and 230,000 years ago.9

There was also a third line of evidence for archaic mixture. A commonly held view is that the San hunter-gatherers of southern Africa largely derive from a lineage that branched off the one leading to all other present-day modern human lineages before they separated from one another.10 If so, the San would be expected to share mutations at exactly the same rate with all non–southern Africans. But Pontus Skoglund in my laboratory showed that the San share more mutations with eastern and central African hunter-gatherers than they do with West African populations like the Yoruba of Nigeria.11 This could be explained if the West African populations harbor more ancestry from one of the early-splitting populations than is the case for non-African populations. Perhaps all present-day humans are a mixture of two highly divergent ancestral groups, with the largest proportion in West Africans, but all populations inheriting DNA from both.

These results suggest the possibility that major mixture in Africa occurred in the time well before around fifty thousand years ago when modern human behavior burst into full flower in the archaeological record. This mixture wasn’t a minor event, such as the approximately 2 percent Neanderthal admixture in non-Africans or the ghost archaic ancestry in Africans found by Wall and Hammer. Because this mixture was closer to 50/50, it is not even clear which one of the source populations should properly be considered archaic and which modern. Perhaps neither was modern, or neither was archaic. Perhaps the mixture itself was essential to forging modern humans, bringing together biological traits from the two mixing populations and combining them in new ways that were advantageous to the newly formed populations.

Figure 25. The deep relationships among present-day modern human lineages are far from simple. One model that genomic findings suggest is that the oldest modern human split in Africa led to a lineage represented in highest proportion in West Africa, a split that must have occurred before three hundred thousand to two hundred thousand years ago, the date of the separation of ancient East and South African foragers. An expansion of modern humans associated with the Later Stone Age and Upper Paleolithic transitions after around fifty thousand years ago could then have connected all populations in Africa.





How Agriculture Threw a Veil over Africa’s Past

How can we begin to learn what happened in Africa after the ancestral population of modern humans was forged, and also after the ancestors of present-day non-Africans spread out of Africa and the Near East beginning around fifty thousand years ago? There is a lot of information to work with, as African genome sequences are typically about a third more diverse than non-African ones. Human diversity in Africa is extraordinary not only within but also across populations, as some pairs of African populations have been isolated for up to four times longer than any pairs of populations outside the continent, as reflected by the fact that for some pairs of populations—like San hunter-gatherers from southern Africa and Yoruba from West Africa—the minimum density of mutations separating their genomes is that much greater than that for any pair of genomes outside Africa.12

But learning about Africans’ deep past from today’s populations is extremely challenging because while much of the ancient variation still exists in people living today, it is all mixed up. The most recent mixing of populations occurred in the last few thousand years due to at least four great expansions, all of which are associated with the spread of language groups, and most of which have been driven by the spread of agriculturalists.13 These expansions have thrown a veil over the African past, moving populations thousands of kilometers from their places of origin, where they displaced or mixed with populations that were widespread before. In this respect, the study of African populations is no different from the study of Eurasian ones, which have also turned over in the last several thousand years.

The agriculturalist expansion that had the greatest impact on Africa is the one associated with people who speak languages of the Bantu family.14 Archaeological studies have documented how beginning around four thousand years ago, a new culture spread out of the region at the border of Nigeria and Cameroon in west-central Africa. People from this culture lived at the boundary of the forest and expanding savanna and developed a highly productive set of crops that was capable of supporting dense populations.15 By about twenty-five hundred years ago they had spread as far as Lake Victoria in eastern Africa and mastered iron toolmaking technology,16 and by around seventeen hundred years ago they had reached southern Africa.17 The consequence of this expansion is that the great majority of people in eastern, central, and southern Africa speak Bantu languages, which are most diverse today in present-day Cameroon, consistent with the theory that proto-Bantu languages originated there and were spread by the culture that also expanded from there around four thousand years ago.18 Bantu languages are a subset of the larger Niger-Kordofanian family spanning most of the languages of West Africa,19 which likely explains why today the frequencies of mutations in groups in Nigeria and in Zambia are more similar than the frequencies of mutations in Germany and Italy despite the former two countries being separated by a far greater geographic distance.

Ultra-sensitive genetic methods, which can detect shared relatives of pairs of individuals in the past few thousand years, have now made it possible to learn something about the geographic path of the Bantu expansion. The genetic variation in Bantu speakers in East Africa is more closely related to the genetic variation in Malawi to the south of the Central African rainforests than it is to genetic variation in Cameroon.20 This suggests that the initial Bantu expansion was largely to the south and that the movement to East Africa was a later expansion from a southern staging ground. This contrasts with the theory of a direct eastward movement from Cameroon, a theory that had been plausible prior to the genetic data.


![Figure 26](images/000040.jpg)



Figure 26. Today, West African–related ancestry is predominant in eastern and southern Africa due to the Bantu expansion of the last four thousand years.




Another agricultural expansion that had a profound impact is the one that spread Nilo-Saharan languages, spoken by groups from Mali to Tanzania. Many Nilo-Saharan speakers are cattle herders, and a common view is that the Nilo-Saharan expansion was driven by the spread of farming and herding in Africa’s dry Sahel region during the expansion of the Sahara Desert over the last five thousand years. One important branch of Nilo-Saharan is the Nilotic languages, which are mostly spoken by cattle herders along the Nile River and in East Africa, including the Maasai and Dinka. The genetic data make it clear that Nilotic-speaking herders were not always socially disadvantaged relative to farmers in the frontier regions where they encountered each other. For example, the Luo group of western Kenya \(to which former U.S. president Barack Obama’s father belonged\) are a primarily farming people who speak a Nilotic language. But George Ayodo, a Luo scientist from Kenya who spent time in my laboratory, found that the mutation frequencies in the Luo are much more similar to those of the majority of Bantu speakers, likely reflecting a history in which a Bantu-speaking group in East Africa adopted a Nilo-Saharan language from its high status neighbors.21

The African language expansion whose origin is most unclear is the one associated with Afroasiatic languages. They are most diverse in present-day Ethiopia, which throws weight behind the theory that northeastern Africa was the homeland of the original speakers of these languages.22 But the Afroasiatic language family also contains a branch localized to the Near East that includes Arabic, Hebrew, and ancient Akkadian. It has been hypothesized on this basis that the spread of Afroasiatic languages, or at least some branches of them, could have been related to the spread of Near Eastern agriculture,23 which introduced barley and wheat and other Near Eastern crops into northeast Africa up to seven thousand years ago.24 New insights are already emerging from ancient DNA, which makes it possible to document ancient migrations between the Near East and North Africa that could have spread languages, culture, and crops. In 2016 and 2017, my laboratory published two papers showing that a shared feature of many East African groups, including ones that do not speak Afroasiatic languages, is that they harbor substantial ancestry from people related to farmers who lived in the Near East around ten thousand years ago.25 Our work also found strong evidence for a second wave of West Eurasian–related admixture—this time with a contribution from Iranian-related farmers as might be expected from a spread from the Near East in the Bronze Age—and showed that this ancestry is widespread in present-day people from Somalia and Ethiopia who speak Afroasiatic languages in the Cushitic sub-family. So the genetic data provide evidence for at least two major waves of north-to-south population movement in the period when Afroasiatic languages were spreading and diversifying, and no evidence of south-to-north migration \(there is little if any sub-Saharan African related ancestry in ancient Near Easterners or Egyptians prior to medieval times\).26 Genes do not determine what language a person speaks and so genetic data cannot by themselves determine how languages spread, and thus cannot provide definitive evidence in favor of one theory or another about whether the ultimate homeland of Afroasiatic languages was sub-Saharan Africa, North Africa, Arabia, or the Near East. But there is no question that the genetic data increase the plausibility of a Near Eastern agriculturalist source for at least some Afroasiatic languages, and the genetic findings raise the question of what languages were spoken by these north-to-south migrants.

The fourth great agriculturalist expansion in Africa is the one associated with the Khoe-Kwadi languages of southern Africa. Like the two language groups spoken by hunter-gatherer groups in the south of Africa—Kx’a and Tuu—Khoe-Kwadi languages are characterized by click sounds. Based on shared words for herding, it has been hypothesized that Khoe-Kwadi languages were brought from East Africa by cattle herders who came to southern Africa after eighteen hundred years ago and who may also have picked up click sounds from local populations.27 The genetic data support the hypothesis of a major genetic contribution by East Africans to Khoe-Kwadi-speaking populations today. In 2012, Joseph Pickrell in my laboratory showed that Khoe-Kwadi speakers share a disproportionate amount of their ancestry with Ethiopians compared to the Kx’a and the Tuu, as might be expected from a migration from the north.28 The size of East African–derived DNA segments in some of the Khoe-Kwadi–speaking populations is what would be expected from mixture eighteen to nine hundred years ago with a ghost herder population, consistent with the arrival of herders around this time and a delay before the mixture with local populations was complete. Within the segments matching East Africans, Pickrell found even smaller segments that matched Near Easterners more than they did any other populations, and that had lengths expected for an average mixture date of around three thousand years ago. That is the average date of mixture between people of West Eurasian–related ancestry and sub-Saharan ancestry in many groups in Ethiopia,29 so this finding provides further support for the hypothesis of an East African source.

Ancient DNA has now verified this hypothesis. In 2017, Pontus Skoglund analyzed ancient DNA from the approximately thirty-one-hundred-year-old remains of an infant girl from Tanzania in equatorial East Africa, and an approximately twelve-hundred-year-old sample from the western Cape region of South Africa, both buried among artifacts and animal bones that identified them as being from herder populations.30 The Tanzanian girl was a member of the ghost herding population that Pickrell and I had predicted: a group that derived most of its ancestry from ancient East African hunter-gatherers, and the remaining part from an ancient West Eurasian–related population. This population almost certainly played a major role in spreading cattle herding from the Near East and North Africa across sub-Saharan Africa. Our ancient DNA evidence from the southern African herder also strongly supported this idea, showing that this individual derived about one-third of her ancestry from the pastoralist population of which the Tanzanian girl was a part, and her remaining ancestry from local groups related to present-day San hunter-gatherers. The mixture of ancestries in the twelve-hundred-year-old southern African herder was very similar to that in present-day Khoe-Kwadi speakers, many of whom are herders, supporting the theory that early Khoe-Kwadi languages, herding, and this type of East African ancestry all spread to southern Africa through a movement of people.

The landscape of human biological and cultural diversity in Africa today, dominated as it is by the effects of the agricultural expansions of the last few thousand years, is extraordinary, but it is also distracting if one’s interest is in understanding the big picture of what happened. A trap that researchers of African genetics, archaeology, and linguistics repeatedly fall into is celebrating Africa’s present-day diversity, epitomized by a slide showing the faces of people from across the continent who look very different from each other that many of us use when presenting on Africa. It is tempting to think that in order to comprehend deep time in Africa we need to be able to hold all of that diversity in our heads and explain all of it at once. But most of the present-day population structure of Africa is shaped by the agricultural expansions of the past few thousand years, and so focusing on describing Africa’s mesmerizing diversity paradoxically does the project of understanding the big picture of humans in Africa a disservice just as much as focusing on the common origins of all modern humans in Africa does Africa a disservice. We need to stop focusing on describing the veil and instead rip it away, and for this we need ancient DNA.



Reconstructing Africa’s Forager Past

Who lived in Africa before the expansion of food producers, the people who so profoundly transformed the human landscape of the continent? Answering this question is extraordinarily difficult based on patterns of present-day variation. In the introduction to this book, I described how Luca Cavalli-Sforza made a bet in 1960 that it would be possible to reconstruct the deep history of human populations based entirely on patterns of genetic variation in present-day groups.31 However, he lost his bet, as ancient DNA has revealed that there has been so much migration and population extinction that in most instances it is very difficult even with sophisticated statistical methods to recover the details of ancient demographic events from the traces left behind in the DNA of present-day people.

The breakthrough that is making it possible to get beyond this impasse will not be surprising to the reader. It is genome-wide ancient DNA, which can be coanalyzed with data from groups that have been genetically and culturally isolated compared to their neighbors, among them the Pygmies of Central Africa, the San hunter-gatherers of the southern tip of Africa, and the Hadza of Tanzania, whose languages with clicks are very different from the languages of the Bantu who surround them and whose genetic ancestry is highly distinctive as well. Some of these populations harbor genetic lineages that are highly divergent from their neighbors. We can compare data from these ancient samples to probe events that occurred deeper in time than those that can be accessed only by analyzing the DNA of present-day populations.

Well-preserved ancient DNA has until recently been hard to find in most parts of Africa because of the hot climate, which accelerates chemical reactions that degrade DNA. But in 2015, the ancient DNA revolution finally arrived in Africa because of improvements in the efficiency of DNA extraction techniques and a better understanding of which bones yielded the most DNA.

The first genome-wide ancient DNA data from Africa came from a forty-five-hundred-year-old skeleton found in a highland cave in Ethiopia.32 This ancient individual was much more closely related to one group living in Ethiopia today, the Ari, than to many others. Today there is an intricate caste system that shapes the lives of many people within Ethiopia, with elaborate rules preventing marriage between groups with different traditional roles.33 The Ari include three subgroups—the Cultivators, Blacksmiths, and Potters—who are socially and genetically differentiated from one another and from non-Ari groups.34 Since the Ari have a distinctive genetic affinity to the forty-five-hundred-year-old ancient highland individual compared to other Ethiopian groups, it is clear that there were strong local barriers to gene exchange and homogenization within the region of present-day Ethiopia that persisted for at least forty-five hundred years. This is the best example of strong endogamy that I know of—even more ancient than the evidence of endogamy in India that so far is only documented as going back a couple of thousand years.35

Ancient DNA keeps surprising us. In 2017, Pontus Skoglund in my laboratory analyzed sixteen individuals from Africa: foragers and herders from South Africa who lived between about twenty-one hundred and twelve hundred years ago, foragers from Malawi in southern Africa who lived between about eighty-one hundred and twenty-five hundred years ago, and foragers, farmers, and herders from Tanzania and Kenya who lived between about thirty-one hundred and four hundred years ago.36 While these individuals are very recent compared to some of the oldest Eurasian ancient DNA, they nevertheless provide insights into African population structure before the arrival of the food producers who transformed much of Africa’s human geography.

A great surprise that emerged from our ancient DNA analysis was that there was evidence of a ghost population dominating the eastern seaboard of sub-Saharan Africa that appears to have been largely displaced by the expansion of agriculturalists.37 This population, which we called the “East African Foragers,” contributed all of the ancestry of two ancient hunter-gatherer genomes in our dataset from Ethiopia and Kenya, as well as essentially all of the ancestry of the present-day Hadza of Tanzania, who today number fewer than one thousand. We also found that the East African Foragers were more closely related to non-Africans today than they were to any other groups in sub-Saharan Africa. The close relationship to non-Africans suggests that the ancestors of the East African Foragers may have been the population in which the Middle to Later Stone Age transition occurred, propelling expansions outside of Africa and possibly within Africa too after around fifty thousand years ago. So the population that became the East African Foragers had a pivotal role in our history.

The East African Foragers were not a homogeneous population. This is evident from the fact that our data include at least three distinct East African Forager groups within Africa—one spanning the ancient Ethiopian and ancient Kenyan, a second contributing large fractions of the ancestry of the ancient foragers from the Zanzibar Archipelago and Malawi, and a third represented in the present-day Hadza.38 Based on the sparse data we had, we were not able to determine the date when these groups separated from one another. But given the extended geographic span and the antiquity of human occupation in this region, it would not be surprising if some of the differences among these groups dated back tens of thousands of years. There is precedent for such separations within forager populations in Africa. In 2012, my laboratory and another showed that a group that I think of as the “South African Foragers”—a lineage that is as divergent from the East African Foragers as any present-day human population—contained within it two highly divergent lineages that separated from each other at least twenty thousand years ago.39 East Africa is at least as rich a human habitat as southern Africa, and it would not be surprising if separations among foragers in East Africa were at least as old.

The second surprise was our discovery that some of our ancient African forager population samples shared ancestry from both South African Forager lineages and East African Forager lineages. Today, South African Forager lineages are essentially entirely restricted to southernmost Africa, where they form an important part of the ancestry of nearly all of the populations that use languages with clicks in them, and where they contribute almost all the ancestry of present-day San foragers as well as the ancient forager genomes we generated from southern Africa. But our ancient samples show that the term “South African Forager” may be misleading about where the ancestral population of this group arose. Two approximately fourteen-hundred-year-old individuals from Zanzibar and Pemba islands off the coast of Tanzania—an island chain that separated from the mainland approximately ten thousand years ago as sea levels rose and thus plausibly harbors isolated descendants of a forager population that lived in East Africa around that time40—were a mixture of approximately one-third South African Forager–related ancestry and the remainder East African Forager ancestry.41 A series of seven samples from three different archaeological sites in Malawi in south-central Africa, which we dated to between about eighty-one hundred and twenty-five hundred years ago, were part of a homogeneous population that harbored about two-thirds South African Forager–related ancestry and the remainder East African Forager ancestry. So South African Forager ancestry was in the past distributed over a much broader swath of the continent, making it hard to know where this ancient population originated.

Ancient DNA is teaching us that the history of modern Africa has its roots in ancient population separations and mixtures even before the arrival of agriculture. Thus the human story in Africa is complex at all levels and at all time depths, as might be expected from the continent’s huge size, its varied landscape, and the antiquity of the presence of our species there. The ancient DNA revolution is only just getting a toehold in Africa. In the coming years, Africa will be fully included in the ancient DNA revolution, and data will arrive from remains from more locations and from deeper times. These data will surely transform and clarify our view of what happened in the deep African past.



What’s Next for Understanding the African Story

Some of the most striking examples of the complexity of human population structure in Africa are the patterns of natural selection on the continent. People of West African ancestry today have a high rate of sickle cell disease, conferred by a mutation that changes the blood protein hemoglobin, the molecule that more than any other is responsible for ferrying oxygen around the body. This mutation has risen to substantial frequency under the pressure of natural selection in several places in Africa: in far West Africa \(e.g., Senegal\), in west-central Africa \(e.g., Nigeria\), and in central Africa \(whence the mutation spread to eastern Africa and southern Africa via the migrations associated with the Bantu expansion\). The reason this mutation has risen to such a high frequency in each of these populations is that if a person carries one copy of the mutation from either of his or her parents, it protects against the infectious disease malaria. Malaria is so dangerous that the protection provided to the approximately 20 percent of the population who carry one copy of the sickle cell mutation is balanced in evolutionary terms with the cost that the approximately 1 percent of the population has to pay in carrying two copies of the mutation and suffering from sickle cell disease, which kills in childhood without treatment. Strikingly, the mutation has arisen independently in each of three locations in Africa, which we know from the fact that the sequences on which it resides are all different. From a naive perspective this seems surprising, as one would think that a mutation like this would be so advantageous to the people who carry it that once it arose it would spread around the vast malaria zone of Africa propelled by a tailwind of natural selection if there was even a small rate of interbreeding among neighbors.42 A similar pattern is seen for the mutations in the lactase gene that confer an ability to digest cow’s milk into adulthood. The genetic basis for lactase persistence is completely different in North Africans and in the Fulani of West Africa than it is in the Masai of Sudan and Kenya, who carry different mutations, albeit in the same gene.43

As Peter Ralph and Graham Coop have shown, the multiple origins in Africa of sickle cell mutations and of mutations that allow people to digest cow’s milk imply that the rate of migration among these populations—even in parts of sub-Saharan Africa less than a couple of thousand kilometers from each other—has been extraordinarily low since the need for these mutations arose. As a result, the most efficient way for evolutionary forces to spread beneficial mutations has often been to invent mutations anew rather than to import them from other populations.44 The limited migration rates between some regions of Africa over the last few thousand years has resulted in what Ralph and Coop have described as a “tessellated” pattern of population structure in Africa. Tessellation is a mathematical term for a landscape of tiles—regions of genetic homogeneity demarcated by sharp boundaries—that is expected to form when the process of homogenization due to gene exchanges among neighbors competes with the process of generating new advantageous variations in each region. The size of the regions where the same sickle cell mutation or same lactase-persistence mutation prevails reflects the rate of gene exchange among neighboring populations in Africa over the last thousands of years.

Our understanding of African population history is still in its early stages, but it is already clear that the story is complicated, with separations within major lineages such as East African Foragers and South African Foragers dating back deep in time, and layers of mixture beyond the most recent ones that have arisen due to the spread of agriculture. Eventually, by obtaining many more samples of ancient DNA from Africa, we will be able to comprehend the range of human variation in Africa in the last tens of thousands of years and make meaningful reconstructions of population structure.

What we can already be sure of is that in Africa, as in every region that has yielded ancient DNA, the model of an evolutionary tree in which today’s populations have remained unchanged and separate since branching from a central trunk is dead, and that instead the truth has involved great cycles of population separation and mixture. What we can be sure of, too, is that in Africa, as in every world region that has yielded ancient DNA, the data will disprove many commonly held assumptions. The implications of this complexity for society, and for the way we need to rethink who we are, is the theme of part III of this book.
