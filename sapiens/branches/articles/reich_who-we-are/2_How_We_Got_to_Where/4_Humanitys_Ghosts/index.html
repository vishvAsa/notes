  <meta property="og:description" content="The Discovery of the Ancient North Eurasians When confronted with the diversity of life, evolutionary biologists are drawn to the metaphor of a tree. Charles Darwin, at the inception of the field, wrote: “The affinities of all the beings of the same class have sometimes been represented by a great tree….The green and budding twigs may represent existing species….The limbs divided into great branches, and these into lesser and lesser branches, were themselves once, when the tree was small, budding twigs.”1 Present populations budded from past ones, which branched from a common root in Africa. If the tree metaphor is right, then any population today will have a single ancestral population at each point in the past. The significance of the tree is that once a population separates, it does not remix, as fusions of branches cannot occur.">

  <h2 id="the-discovery-of-the-ancient-north-eurasians">The Discovery of the Ancient North Eurasians</h2>
<p>When confronted with the diversity of life, evolutionary biologists are drawn to the metaphor of a tree. Charles Darwin, at the inception of the field, wrote: “The affinities of all the beings of the same class have sometimes been represented by a great tree….The green and budding twigs may represent existing species….The limbs divided into great branches, and these into lesser and lesser branches, were themselves once, when the tree was small, budding twigs.”<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> Present populations budded from past ones, which branched from a common root in Africa. If the tree metaphor is right, then any population today will have a single ancestral population at each point in the past. The significance of the tree is that once a population separates, it does not remix, as fusions of branches cannot occur.</p>
<p>The avalanche of new data that has become available in the wake of the genome revolution has shown just how wrong the tree metaphor is for summarizing the relationship among modern human populations. My closest collaborator, the applied mathematician Nick Patterson, developed a series of formal tests to evaluate whether a tree model is an accurate summary of real population relationships. Foremost among these was the Four Population Test, which, as described in part I, examines hundreds of thousands of positions on the genome where individuals vary—for example, where some people have an adenine (one of the four nucleic acids or “letters” of DNA) and others have a guanine—reflecting a mutation that occurred deep in the past. If a set of four populations is described by a tree, then the frequencies of their mutations are expected to have a simple relationship.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></p>
<p>The most natural way to test the tree model is to measure the frequencies of mutations in the genomes of two populations that we hypothesize have split from the same branch. If a tree model is correct, the frequencies of mutations in the two populations will have changed randomly since their separation from the other two more distantly related populations, and so the frequency differences between these two pairs of populations will be statistically independent. If a tree model is wrong, there will be a correlation between the frequency differences, pointing to the likelihood of mixture between the branches. The Four Population Test was central to our demonstration that Neanderthals are more closely related to non-Africans than to Africans, and thus that there was interbreeding between Neanderthals and non-Africans.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> But findings about interbreeding between archaic and modern humans are only a small part of what has been discovered with Four Population Tests.</p>
<p>My laboratory’s first major discovery using the Four Population Test came when we tested the widely held view that Native Americans and East Asians are “sister populations” that descend from a common ancestral branch that separated earlier from the ancestors of Europeans and sub-Saharan Africans. To our surprise, we found that at mutations not shared with sub-Saharan Africans, Europeans are more closely related to Native Americans than they are to East Asians. It would be tempting to argue that this observation has a trivial explanation, such as Native Americans having some ancestry from European migrants over the last five hundred years. But we found the same pattern in every Native American population we studied, including those we could prove had no European admixture. The scenario of Native Americans and Europeans descending from a common population that split earlier from East Asians was also contradicted by the data. Something was deeply wrong with the standard tree model of population relationships.</p>
<p>We wrote a paper describing these results, suggesting that the patterns reflect an episode of mixture deep in the ancestry of Native Americans: a coming together of people related to Europeans and people related to East Asians prior to crossing the Bering land bridge between Asia and the Americas. We submitted this paper, “Ancient Mixture in the Ancestry of Native Americans,” in 2009. It was accepted pending minor revisions, but as it turns out, we never published it.</p>
<p>Even as we were making our final revisions to that paper, Patterson discovered something even stranger, which made us realize we had understood only part of the story.<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup> To explain his discovery, I need to describe another statistical test we devised, the Three Population Test, which evaluates a “test” population for evidence of mixture. If the test population is a mixture of lineages related to the comparison populations in two different ways—as African Americans are a mixture of Europeans and West Africans—then the frequencies of the test population’s mutations are expected to be intermediate between those of the two comparison populations. In contrast, if mixture did not occur, there is no reason to expect the frequencies of mutations in the population to be intermediate. Thus the scenarios of mixture and no mixture yield two qualitatively very different patterns.</p>
<p>When we applied the Three Population Test to diverse human populations, we detected negative statistics when the test population was northern European, proving that population mixture occurred in the ancestors of northern Europeans. We tried all possible pairs of comparison populations from more than fifty worldwide populations and found that the mixture evidence was strongest when one comparison population was southern European, especially Sardinians, and the other was Native Americans. It was clearly Native American populations that produced the most negative values, as we found that the statistic was more negative when we used Native Americans for the second comparison population than when we used East Asians, Siberians, or New Guineans. What we had found was evidence that people in northern Europe, such as the French, are descended from a mixture of populations, one of which shared more ancestry with present-day Native Americans than with any other population living today.</p>
<p>How could we understand the results of both the Three Population Test and the Four Population Test? We proposed that more than fifteen thousand years ago, there was a population living in northern Eurasia that was not the primary ancestral population of the present-day inhabitants of the region. Some people from this population migrated east across Siberia and contributed to the population that crossed the Bering land bridge and gave rise to Native Americans. Others migrated west and contributed to Europeans. This would explain why today, the evidence of mixture in Europeans is strong when using Native Americans as a surrogate for the ancestral population and not as strong in indigenous Siberians, who plausibly descend from more recent, post–ice age migrations into Siberia from more southern parts of East Asia.</p>

<p>We called this proposed new population the “Ancient North Eurasians.” At the time we proposed them, they were a “ghost”—a population that we can infer existed in the past based on statistical reconstruction but that no longer exists in unmixed form. The Ancient North Eurasians would without a doubt have been called a “race” had they lived today, as we could show that they must have been genetically about as differentiated from all other Eurasian populations who lived at the time as today’s “West Eurasians,” “Native Americans,” and “East Asians” are from one another. Although they have not left unmixed descendants, the Ancient North Eurasians have in fact been extraordinarily successful. If we put together all the genetic material that they have contributed to present-day populations, they account for literally hundreds of millions of genomes’ worth of people. All told, more than half the world’s population derives between <sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup> percent and 40 percent of their genomes from the Ancient North Eurasians.</p>
<p>The case of the Ancient North Eurasians showed that while a tree is a good analogy for the relationships among species—because species rarely interbreed and so like real tree limbs are not expected to grow back together after they branch5—it is a dangerous analogy for human populations. The genome revolution has taught us that great mixtures of highly divergent populations have occurred repeatedly.<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup> Instead of a tree, a better metaphor may be a trellis, branching and remixing far back into the past.<sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup></p>
<h2 id="the-ghost-is-found">The Ghost Is Found</h2>
<p>At the end of 2013, Eske Willerslev and his colleagues published genome-wide data from the bones of a boy who had lived at the Mal’ta site in south-central Siberia around twenty-four thousand years ago.<sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup> The Mal’ta genome had its strongest genetic affinity to Europeans and Native Americans, and far less affinity to the Siberians who live in the region today—just as we had predicted for the ghost population of the Ancient North Eurasians. The Mal’ta genome has now become the prototype sample for the Ancient North Eurasians. Paleontologists would call it a “type specimen,” the individual used in the scientific literature to define a newly discovered group.</p>
<p>With the Mal’ta genome in hand, the other pieces of the puzzle snapped into place. It was no longer necessary to reconstruct from present-day populations what had happened long ago. Instead, with a genome sampled directly from the ghost population, it was possible to understand migrations and population admixtures from tens of thousands of years ago as if we were analyzing recent history. What became possible with the Mal’ta genome is the best example I know of the power of ancient DNA to uncover history that until then could only be dimly perceived from present-day data.</p>
<p>The analysis of the Mal’ta genome made it clear that Native Americans derive about a third of their ancestry from the Ancient North Eurasians, and the remainder from East Asians. It is this major mixture that explains why Europeans are genetically closer to Native Americans than they are to East Asians. Our unpublished manuscript claiming that Native Americans descend from a mixture of East Asian and West Eurasian related lineages had been correct, but it was just not the whole story; the paper was overtaken by events in the fast-moving field of ancient DNA. What Willerslev and colleagues found went far beyond what we had been able to do by relying on only modern populations. The Willerslev team not only proved that Native Americans issued from population mixture—which we had not succeeded in doing as we could not rule out an alternative scenario—but they also showed that the mixture was part of a larger story.</p>
<p>The finding that several of the great populations outside of Africa today are profoundly mixed was at odds with what most scientists expected. Prior to the genome revolution, I, like most others, had assumed that the big genetic clusters of populations we see today reflect the deep splits of the past. But in fact the big clusters today are themselves the result of mixtures of very different populations that existed earlier. We have since detected similar patterns in every population we have analyzed: East Asians, South Asians, West Africans, southern Africans. There was never a single trunk population in the human past. It has been mixtures all the way down.</p>
<h2 id="the-ghost-of-the-near-east">The Ghost of the Near East</h2>
<p>Throughout 2013, Iosif Lazaridis in my laboratory was troubled by a result that could not be understood without ancient DNA.</p>
<p>Lazaridis was trying to understand a peculiar Four Population Test result showing that East Asians, present-day Europeans, and pre-farming European hunter-gatherers from around eight thousand years ago are not related to one another according to the tree model. Instead, his analysis showed that East Asians today are genetically more closely related on average to the ancestors of ancient European hunter-gatherers than they are to the ancestors of present Europeans. Ancient DNA studies prior to his work had already shown that present-day Europeans derive some of their ancestry from migrations of farmers from the Near East, who I had assumed were derived from the same ancestral population as European hunter-gatherers. Lazaridis now realized that the ancestry of the first European farmers was distinct from European hunter-gatherers in some way. Something more complicated was going on.</p>
<p>Lazaridis weighed two alternative explanations. One explanation was that there was mixture between the ancestors of ancient European hunter-gatherers and ancient East Asians, bringing these two populations together genetically. There are no insurmountable geographic barriers between Europe and East Asia, so this was a distinct possibility. The alternative explanation was that early European farmers who contributed much of the DNA to present-day Europeans derived some of their ancestry from a population that split early from the main group that peopled Eurasia. This would render East Asians less similar to present-day Europeans than they are to pre-farming European hunter-gatherers.</p>
<p>Once the genome sequence from Mal’ta became available, Lazaridis instantly solved the problem.<sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup> With Mal’ta in hand, he carried out Four Population Tests among various sets of four populations. Mal’ta and the pre-farming European hunter-gatherers appeared to descend from a common ancestral population that arose after the separation from East Asians and sub-Saharan Africans. The data were consistent with a simple tree. But when Lazaridis replaced ancient European hunter-gatherers in this statistic with either present-day Europeans or with early European farmers, the tree metaphor could no longer describe the data. Present-day Europeans and Near Easterners are mixed: they carry within them ancestry from a divergent Eurasian lineage that branched from Mal’ta, European hunter-gatherers, and East Asians before those three lineages separated from one another.</p>
<p>Lazaridis called this lineage “Basal Eurasian” to denote its position as the deepest split in the radiation of lineages contributing to non-Africans. The Basal Eurasians were a new ghost population, one as important as the Ancient North Eurasians, measured by the sheer number of descendant genomes they have left behind. The extent of the deviations of the Four Population Test away from the value of zero that would be expected if the populations were related by a simple tree indicates that this ghost population contributed about a quarter of the ancestry of present-day Europeans and Near Easterners. It also contributed comparable proportions of ancestry to Iranians and Indians.</p>
<p>No one has yet collected ancient DNA from the Basal Eurasians. Finding such a sample is at present one of the holy grails in the field of ancient DNA, just as finding the Ancient North Eurasians had been before the Mal’ta discovery. But we know that Basal Eurasians existed. And even without having their ancient DNA, we know important facts about them based on the genomic fragments they have left behind in samples for which we do have data.</p>
<p>An extraordinary feature of the Basal Eurasians compared to all other lineages that have contributed to present-day people outside of Africa is that they harbored little or no Neanderthal ancestry. In 2016, we analyzed ancient DNA from the Near East to show that people who lived in the region fourteen thousand to ten thousand years ago had approximately 50 percent Basal Eurasian ancestry, about twice the proportion in Europeans today. Plotting the proportion of Basal Eurasian ancestry against the proportion of Neanderthal ancestry, we realized that the less Basal Eurasian ancestry a non-African person has, the more Neanderthal ancestry he or she has. Thus non-Africans who have zero percent Basal Eurasian ancestry have twice as much Neanderthal DNA as ones with 50 percent Basal Eurasian ancestry. By extrapolation, we might expect 100 percent Basal Eurasians to have no Neanderthal ancestry at all.<sup id="fnref:10"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">10</a></sup> So wherever the Neanderthal admixture occurred, it seems to have largely happened after the other branches of the non-African family tree separated from Basal Eurasians.</p>
<p>A tempting idea is that the Basal Eurasians represent the descendants of a second wave of migration of modern humans north of the Sahara Desert, well after the dispersal of the population that interbred with Neanderthals. However, this is not correct, as the Basal Eurasian lineage shares much of the history of other non-Africans, including descent from the same relatively small population that founded all non-African lineages more than fifty thousand years ago. The ancient presence of the Basal Eurasians in Eurasia becomes even clearer when one considers that peoples who lived ten thousand years ago or more in what are now Iran and Israel each had around 50 percent Basal Eurasian ancestry,<sup id="fnref:11"><a href="#fn:11" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">11</a></sup> despite the clear genetic evidence that these two populations had been isolated from one another for tens of thousands of years.<sup id="fnref:12"><a href="#fn:12" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">12</a></sup> This suggests the possibility that there were multiple highly divergent Basal Eurasian lineages coexisting in the ancient Near East, not exchanging many migrants until farming expanded. The Basal Eurasians were a major and distinctive source of human genetic variation, with multiple subpopulations persisting for a long period of time.</p>
<p>Where could the Basal Eurasians have lived, isolated as they seem to have been for tens of thousands of years from other non-African lineages? In the absence of ancient DNA, we can only speculate. It is possible that they may have sojourned in North Africa, which is difficult to reach from southern parts of the African continent because of the barrier of the Sahara Desert, and which is more ecologically linked to West Eurasia. Today, the peoples of North Africa owe most of their ancestry to West Eurasian migrants, making the deep genetic past in that region difficult to discern.<sup id="fnref:13"><a href="#fn:13" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">13</a></sup> However, archaeological studies have revealed ancient cultures there that could potentially have corresponded to the Basal Eurasians. The Nile Valley, for example, has been occupied by humans for the entire period since present-day Eurasians diverged from their closest relatives in sub-Saharan Africa.</p>
<p>A hint about the possible homeland of the Basal Eurasians comes from the Natufians, hunter-gatherers who lived after around fourteen thousand years ago in the southwestern parts of the Near East.<sup id="fnref:14"><a href="#fn:14" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">14</a></sup> They were the first people known to have lived in permanent dwellings—they did not migrate from place to place searching for food despite being hunter-gatherers. They built large stone structures and actively managed local wild plants before their successors became full-fledged farmers. Their skulls as well as the stone tools they made are similar in shape to those of North Africans who lived around the same time, and it has been suggested on this basis that the Natufians migrated to the Near East from North Africa.<sup id="fnref:15"><a href="#fn:15" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">15</a></sup> In 2016, my laboratory published ancient DNA from six Natufians from Israel, and we found that they share with early Iranian hunter-gatherers the highest proportions of Basal Eurasian ancestry in the Near East.<sup id="fnref:16"><a href="#fn:16" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">16</a></sup> However, our ancient DNA data cannot determine where the ancestors of the Natufians lived, as we do not yet have comparable ancient DNA data from any other populations that lived at this time or earlier in North Africa, Arabia, or the southwestern Near East. And even if a genetic connection between Natufians and North Africa is established, it will not be the whole story, as it cannot explain the equally high proportions of Basal Eurasian ancestry in the ancient hunter-gatherers and farmers of Iran and the Caucasus.</p>
<h2 id="the-ghosts-of-early-europeans">The Ghosts of Early Europeans</h2>
<p>The discovery of one major ghost population after another—Ancient North Eurasians and Basal Eurasians—might make it seem as if ancient DNA is unnecessary, since the existence of ghosts can be predicted from modern populations. But statistical reconstruction can only go so far. With data from present-day people, it is difficult to probe further back in time than the most recent mixture event. Moreover, because humans are so mobile, it is impossible to determine with any confidence where ancestral populations lived based on analyses of the genomes of their descendants. With ancient DNA directly extracted from the ghosts, however, it is possible to project further back in time, revealing even more ancient ghosts than can be recovered from modern data alone. So it was when the Mal’ta genome was sequenced. We discovered the Mal’ta genome statistically, but once we had access to the sequence, we were able to discover the even more distant Basal Eurasians.<sup id="fnref:17"><a href="#fn:17" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">17</a></sup></p>
<p>In 2016, the lid of Pandora’s box opened wide, and a whole mob of ancient ghosts whirled out. My laboratory assembled genome-wide data from fifty-one ancient modern humans in Eurasia, most of them from Europe, who lived between forty-five thousand and seven thousand years ago.<sup id="fnref:18"><a href="#fn:18" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">18</a></sup> These samples spanned the entire period of the Last Glacial Maximum—which occurred between twenty-five thousand and nineteen thousand years ago—when glaciers covered the northern and middle latitudes of Europe so that all humans there lived in refuges in its southern peninsulas. Prior to our work, just a few remains provided genetic data from this period, and the picture that emerged from their analysis was static and monochromatic. But with all our new data, we could show that repeated population transformations, replacements, migrations, and mixtures had taken place over this vast stretch of time.</p>
<p>When analyzing ancient DNA data, the usual approach is to compare ancient individuals to present-day ones, trying to get bearings on the past from the perspective of the present. But when this was done by Qiaomei Fu in my laboratory, her results shed little light on these ancient hunter-gatherers. The differences among humans today are hardly relevant to those that existed in Europe at the time depths she was studying. Fu needed to confront the data on their own terms. To do this, she began by comparing the ancient individuals to one another. She grouped them in four clusters that contained many samples that were similar both genetically and with respect to their archaeologically determined dates. Now she only needed to understand the relationships among the clusters. There were also some individuals who did not cluster with any others, especially among the oldest individuals.</p>
<p>With her samples organized in this way, Fu was able to break down the story of the first thirty-five thousand years of modern humans in West Eurasia into at least five key events.</p>

<p>Figure 13. Having migrated out of Africa and the Near East, modern human pioneer populations spread throughout Eurasia (1). By at least thirty-nine thousand years ago, one group founded a lineage of European hunter-gatherers that persisted largely uninterrupted for more than twenty thousand years (2). Eventually, groups derived from an eastern branch of this founding population of European hunter-gatherers spread west (3), displaced previous groups, and were eventually themselves pushed out of northern Europe by the spread of glacial ice, shown at its maximum extent (top right). As the glaciers receded, western Europe was repeopled from the southwest (4) by a population that had managed to persist for tens of thousands of years and was related to an approximately thirty-five-thousand-year-old individual from far western Europe. A later human migration, following the first strong warming period, had an even larger impact, with a spread from the southeast (5) that not only transformed the population of western Europe but also homogenized the populations of Europe and the Near East. At a single site—Goyet Caves in Belgium—ancient DNA from individuals spread over twenty thousand years reflects these transformations, with representatives from the Aurignacian, Gravettian, and Magdalenian periods.</p>
<p>Event One was the spread of modern humans into western Eurasia and is evident in the two most ancient samples, an approximately forty-five-thousand-year-old individual whose leg bone had been found eroding out of a riverbank in western Siberia,<sup id="fnref:19"><a href="#fn:19" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">19</a></sup> and an approximately forty-thousand-year-old individual whose lower jaw was found in a cave in Romania.<sup id="fnref:20"><a href="#fn:20" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">20</a></sup> Both individuals were no more closely related to later European hunter-gatherers than they were to present-day East Asians. This finding showed that they were members of pioneer modern human populations that initially flourished but whose descendants largely disappeared. The existence of these pioneer populations makes it clear that the past is not an inevitable march toward the present. Human history is full of dead ends, and we should not expect the people who lived in any one place in the past to be the direct ancestors of those who live there today. Around thirty-nine thousand years ago, a supervolcano near present-day Naples in Italy dropped an estimated three hundred cubic kilometers of ash across Europe, separating archaeological layers preceding it from those that succeeded it.<sup id="fnref:21"><a href="#fn:21" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">21</a></sup> Almost no Neanderthal remains or tools are found above this layer, suggesting that the climate disruption produced by the volcano, which could have produced multiyear winters, may have compounded competition with modern humans to create a crisis that drove Neanderthals to extinction. But the Neanderthals were not the only ones in crisis. Most modern human archaeological cultures that left remains below the ash layer left none above it. Many modern humans disappeared as dramatically as their Neanderthal contemporaries.<sup id="fnref:22"><a href="#fn:22" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">22</a></sup></p>
<p>Event Two was the spread of the lineage that gave rise to all later hunter-gatherers in Europe. Fu’s Four Population Tests showed that both an approximately thirty-seven-thousand-year-old individual from eastern Europe (present-day European Russia)<sup id="fnref:23"><a href="#fn:23" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">23</a></sup> and an approximately thirty-five-thousand-year-old individual from western Europe (present-day Belgium) were part of a population that contributed to all later Europeans, including today’s.<sup id="fnref:24"><a href="#fn:24" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">24</a></sup> Fu also used Four Population Tests to show that during the entire period from around thirty-seven thousand to around fourteen thousand years ago, almost all the individuals she analyzed from Europe could be rather well described as descending from a single common ancestral population that had not experienced mixture with non-European populations. Archaeologists have shown that after the volcanic eruption around thirty-nine thousand years ago, a modern human culture spread across Europe making stone tools of a type known as Aurignacian, and that this replaced the diverse stone toolmaking styles that existed before. Thus genetic and archaeological evidence both point to multiple independent migrations of early modern human pioneers into Europe, some of which went extinct and were replaced by a more homogeneous population and culture.</p>
<p>Event Three was the coming of the people who made Gravettian tools, who dominated most of Europe between around thirty-three thousand and twenty-two thousand years ago. The material remains they left behind include voluptuous female statuettes, as well as musical instruments and dazzling cave art. Compared to the people who made Aurignacian tools who came before them, the people who made Gravettian tools were much more deliberate about burying their dead, and as a result we have many more skeletons from this period than we do from the Aurignacian period. We extracted DNA from Gravettian-era individuals buried in present-day Belgium, Italy, France, Germany, and the Czech Republic. They were all genetically very similar despite their extraordinary geographic dispersal. Fu’s analysis indicated that most of their ancestry derived from the same sublineage of European hunter-gatherers as the thirty-seven-thousand-year-old individual from far eastern Europe, and that they then spread west, displacing the sublineage associated with Aurignacian tools and represented in the thirty-five-thousand-year-old Belgian individual. The changes in artifact styles associated with the rise of the Gravettian culture were thus driven by the spread of new people.</p>
<p>Event Four was heralded by a skeleton from present-day Spain dating to around nineteen thousand years ago—one of the first individuals known to be associated with the Magdalenian culture, whose members over the next five thousand years migrated to the northeast out of their warm-weather refuge, chasing the retreating ice sheets into present-day France and Germany. The data once again showed a correspondence between the archaeological culture and genetic discoveries, documenting the spread of people into central Europe who were not directly descended from the Gravettians who had preceded them. There was also a surprise: most of the ancestry of individuals associated with the Magdalenian culture came from the sublineage represented by the thirty-five-thousand-year-old individual from Belgium who was associated with Aurignacian tools but who was later succeeded at the same site by people who used Gravettian tools and carried DNA similar to others in Europe associated with that culture of eastern European origin. Here was yet another ghost population that contributed to later groups in mixed form. The Aurignacian lineage had not died out, but instead had persisted in some geographic pocket, possibly in western Europe, before its resurgence at the end of the ice age.</p>
<p>Event Five happened around fourteen thousand years ago, during the first strong warming period after the last ice age, a major climatic change known as the Bølling-Allerød. Geological reconstructions reveal that at this time, the Alpine glacial wall that extended down to the Mediterranean Sea near present-day Nice finally melted after about ten thousand years of dividing the west and east of Europe. Plants and animals from southeastern Europe (the Italian and Balkan peninsulas) migrated in abundance into southwestern Europe.<sup id="fnref:25"><a href="#fn:25" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">25</a></sup> Our Four Population Tests on our ancient DNA data showed that something similar happened with humans. After around fourteen thousand years ago, a group of hunter-gatherers spread across Europe with ancestry quite different from that of the people associated with the preceding Magdalenian culture, whom they largely displaced. Individuals living in Europe between thirty-seven thousand and fourteen thousand years ago were all plausibly descended from a common ancestral population that separated earlier from the ancestors of lineages represented in the Near East today. But after around fourteen thousand years ago, western European hunter-gatherers became much more closely related to present-day Near Easterners. This proved that new migration occurred between the Near East and Europe around this time.</p>
<p>We do not yet have ancient DNA from the period before fourteen thousand years ago from southeastern Europe and the Near East. We can therefore only surmise population movements around this time. The people who had waited out the ice age in southern Europe became dominant across the entire European continent following the melting of the Alpine glacial wall.<sup id="fnref:26"><a href="#fn:26" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">26</a></sup> Perhaps these same people also expanded east into Anatolia, and their descendants spread farther to the Near East, bringing together the genetic heritages of Europe and the Near East more than five thousand years before farmers spread Near Eastern ancestry back into Europe by migrating in the opposite direction.</p>
<h2 id="the-genetic-formation-of-present-day-west-eurasians">The Genetic Formation of Present-Day West Eurasians</h2>
<p>Today, the peoples of West Eurasia—the vast region spanning Europe, the Near East, and much of central Asia—are genetically highly similar. The physical similarity of West Eurasian populations was recognized in the eighteenth century by scholars who classified the people of West Eurasia as “Caucasoids” to differentiate them from East Asian “Mongoloids,” sub-Saharan African “Negroids,” and “Australoids” of Australia and New Guinea. In the 2000s, whole-genome data emerged as a more powerful way to cluster present-day human populations than physical features.</p>
<p>The whole-genome data at first seem to validate some of the old categories. The most common way to measure the genetic similarity between two populations is by taking the square of the difference in mutation frequencies between them, and then averaging across thousands of independent mutations across the genome to get a precisely determined number. Measured in this way, populations within West Eurasia are typically around seven times more similar to one another than West Eurasians are to East Asians. When frequencies of mutations are plotted on a map, West Eurasia appears homogeneous, from the Atlantic façade of Europe to the steppes of central Asia. There is a sharp gradient of change in central Asia before another region of homogeneity is reached in East Asia.<sup id="fnref:27"><a href="#fn:27" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">27</a></sup></p>
<p>How did the present-day population structure emerge from the one that existed in the deep past? We and other ancient DNA laboratories found in 2016 that the formation of the present-day West Eurasian population was propelled by the spread of food producers. Farming began between twelve and eleven thousand years ago in southeastern Turkey and northern Syria, where local hunter-gatherers began domesticating most of the plants and animals many West Eurasians still depend upon today, including wheat, barley, rye, peas, cows, pigs, and sheep. After around nine thousand years ago, farming began spreading west to present-day Greece and roughly at the same time began spreading east, reaching the Indus Valley in present-day Pakistan. Within Europe, farming spread west along the Mediterranean coast to Spain, and northwest to Germany through the Danube River valley, until it reached Scandinavia in the north and the British Isles in the west—the most extreme places where this type of economy was practical.</p>
<p>Until 2016, getting genome-wide ancient DNA from the Near East to assess the extent to which these changes in the archaeological record were propelled by movements of people had failed, as the warm climate of the Near East quickens chemical reactions, accelerating the rate of breakdown of DNA. However, two technical breakthroughs changed this. One came from a method developed by Matthias Meyer, which involved enriching DNA extracted from ancient bones for human sequences of interest.<sup id="fnref:28"><a href="#fn:28" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">28</a></sup> This approach makes ancient DNA analysis up to one thousand times more cost-effective and gives access to samples that would otherwise provide too little DNA to study. Working together with Meyer, we adapted this method to make possible genome-wide analysis of large numbers of samples.<sup id="fnref:29"><a href="#fn:29" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">29</a></sup> The second breakthrough was the recognition that the inner-ear part of the skull—known as the petrous bone—preserves a far higher density of DNA than most other skeletal parts, up to one hundred times more for each milligram of bone powder. Within the petrous bone, the anthropologist Ron Pinhasi, working in Dublin, showed that the mother lode of DNA is found in the cochlea, the snail-shaped organ of hearing.<sup id="fnref:30"><a href="#fn:30" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">30</a></sup> Ancient DNA analysis of petrous bones in 2015 and 2016 broke through one barrier after another and made it possible for the first time to get ancient DNA from the warm Near East.</p>
<p>Working with Pinhasi, we obtained ancient DNA from forty-four ancient Near Easterners across much of the geographic cradle of farming.<sup id="fnref:31"><a href="#fn:31" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">31</a></sup> The results revealed that around ten thousand years ago, at the time that farming was beginning to spread, the population structure of West Eurasia was far from the genetic monoculture we observe today. The farmers of the western mountains of Iran, who may have been the first to domesticate goats, were genetically directly derived from the hunter-gatherers who preceded them. Similarly, the first farmers of present-day Israel and Jordan were descended largely from the Natufian hunter-gatherers who preceded them. But these two populations were also very genetically different from each other. We and another research group<sup id="fnref:32"><a href="#fn:32" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">32</a></sup> found that the degree of genetic differentiation between the first farmers of the western part of the Near East (the Fertile Crescent, including Anatolia and the Levant) and the first farmers of the eastern part (Iran) was about as great as the differentiation between Europeans and East Asians today. In the Near East, the expansion of farming was accomplished not just by the movement of people, as happened in Europe, but also by the spread of common ideas across genetically very different groups.</p>
<p>The high differentiation of human populations in the Near East ten thousand years ago was a specific instance of a broader pattern across the vast region of West Eurasia, documented by Iosif Lazaridis, who led the analysis. Analyzing our data, he found that about ten thousand years ago there were at least four major populations in West Eurasia—the farmers of the Fertile Crescent, the farmers of Iran, the hunter-gatherers of central and western Europe, and the hunter-gatherers of eastern Europe. All these populations differed from one another as much as Europeans differ from East Asians today. Scholars interested in trying to create ancestry-based racial classifications, had they lived ten thousand years ago, would have categorized these groups as “races,” even though none of these groups survives in unmixed form today.</p>
<p>Spurred by the revolutionary technology of plant and animal domestication, which could support much higher population densities than hunting and gathering, the farmers of the Near East began migrating and mixing with their neighbors. But instead of one group displacing all the others and pushing them to extinction, as had occurred in some of the previous spreads of hunter-gatherers in Europe, in the Near East all the expanding groups contributed to later populations. The farmers in present-day Turkey expanded into Europe. The farmers in present-day Israel and Jordan expanded into East Africa, and their genetic legacy is greatest in present-day Ethiopia. Farmers related to those in present-day Iran expanded into India as well as the steppe north of the Black and Caspian seas. They mixed with local populations there and established new economies based on herding that allowed the agricultural revolution to spread into parts of the world inhospitable to domesticated crops. The different food-producing populations also mixed with one another, a process that was accelerated by technological developments in the Bronze Age after around five thousand years ago. This meant that the high genetic substructure that had previously characterized West Eurasia collapsed into the present-day very low level of genetic differentiation by the Bronze Age. It is an extraordinary example of how technology—in this case, domestication—contributed to homogenization, not just culturally but genetically. It shows that what is happening with the Industrial Revolution and the information revolution in our own time is not unique in the history of our species.</p>
<p>The fusion of these highly different populations into today’s West Eurasians is vividly evident in what might be considered the classic northern European look: blue eyes, light skin, and blond hair. Analysis of ancient DNA data shows that western European hunter-gatherers around eight thousand years ago had blue eyes but dark skin and dark hair, a combination that is rare today.<sup id="fnref:33"><a href="#fn:33" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">33</a></sup> The first farmers of Europe mostly had light skin but dark hair and brown eyes—thus light skin in Europe largely owes its origins to migrating farmers.<sup id="fnref:34"><a href="#fn:34" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">34</a></sup> The earliest known example of the classic European blond hair mutation is in an Ancient North Eurasian from the Lake Baikal region of eastern Siberia from seventeen thousand years ago.<sup id="fnref:35"><a href="#fn:35" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">35</a></sup> The hundreds of millions of copies of this mutation in central and western Europe today likely derive from a massive migration into the region of people bearing Ancient North Eurasian ancestry, an event that is related in the next chapter.<sup id="fnref:36"><a href="#fn:36" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">36</a></sup></p>
<p>Surprisingly, the ancient DNA revolution, through its discovery of the pervasiveness of ghost populations and their mixture, is fueling a critique of race that has been raised by scholars in the past, but was never prominent because of a lack of support from hard scientific facts.<sup id="fnref:37"><a href="#fn:37" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">37</a></sup> By demonstrating that the genetic fault lines in West Eurasia between ten thousand and four thousand years ago were entirely different from today’s, the ancient DNA revolution has shown that today’s classifications do not reflect fundamental “pure” units of biology. Instead, today’s divisions are recent phenomena, with their origin in repeating mixtures and migrations. The findings of the ancient DNA revolution suggest that the mixtures will continue. Mixture is fundamental to who we are, and we need to embrace it, not deny that it occurred.</p>
