      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-discovery-of-the-ancient-north-eurasians&#34;&gt;The Discovery of the Ancient North Eurasians&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When confronted with the diversity of life, evolutionary biologists are drawn to the metaphor of a tree. Charles Darwin, at the inception of the field, wrote: “The affinities of all the beings of the same class have sometimes been represented by a great tree….The green and budding twigs may represent existing species….The limbs divided into great branches, and these into lesser and lesser branches, were themselves once, when the tree was small, budding twigs.”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Present populations budded from past ones, which branched from a common root in Africa. If the tree metaphor is right, then any population today will have a single ancestral population at each point in the past. The significance of the tree is that once a population separates, it does not remix, as fusions of branches cannot occur.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Nearly all ancient hunter-gatherers carried one set of mitochondrial DNA types. But the farmers who succeeded them carried no more than a few percent of those types, and their DNA was more similar to that seen today in southern Europe and the Near East.+++(4)+++ It was clear that the farmers came from a population that did not descend from European hunter-gatherers.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

But what did the stories of the &lt;em&gt;Rig Veda&lt;/em&gt; have to do with real events? Who were the &lt;em&gt;dasa,&lt;/em&gt; who were the &lt;em&gt;arya,&lt;/em&gt; and where were the fortresses located? Did anything like this really happen?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Palop gave the Native American tribes hammocks and ornaments and told them to tattoo their bodies and pierce their lips, but he did not give any of these things to the whites. Palop created languages, one for each group, and scattered the groups across the earth.1&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Failure of the Southern Route&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;East Asia—the vast region encompassing China, Japan, and Southeast Asia—is one of the great theaters of human evolution. It harbors more than one third of the world’s population and a similar fraction of its language diversity. Pottery was first invented there at least nineteen thousand years ago.1 It was the jumping-off point for the peopling of the Americas before fifteen thousand years ago. East Asia witnessed an independent and early invention of agriculture around nine thousand years ago.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>9 Rejoining Africa to the Human Story</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A New Perspective on Our African Homeland&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The recognition that Africa is central to the human story has, paradoxically, distracted attention from the last fifty thousand years of its prehistory. The intensive study of what happened in Africa before fifty thousand years ago is motivated by a universal recognition of the importance of the Middle to Later Stone Age transition in Africa and the Middle to Upper Paleolithic transition at the doorstep of Africa, those great leaps forward in recognizably modern human behavior attested to in the archaeological record. However, scholars have shown limited interest in Africa after this period. When I go to talks, a common slip of the tongue is that “we left Africa,” as if the protagonists of the modern human story must be followed to Eurasia. The mistaken impression is that once Africa gave birth to the ancestral population of non-Africans, the African story ended, and the people who remained on the continent were static relics of the past, jettisoned from the main plot, unchanging over the last fifty thousand years.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
