[^26]: To compute the expected difference in number of years of education between the highest 5 percent and lowest 5 percent of genetically predicted educational attainment based on the numbers in the 2016 study by Benjamin and colleagues, I performed the following computation: \(1\) The number of years of education in the cohort analyzed by Benjamin and colleagues is quoted as 14.3 ± 3.7. I estimated the standard deviation of 3.7 years from the fact that the study estimates the effect size in weeks to be “0.014 to 0.048 standard deviations per allele \(2.7 to 9.0 weeks of schooling\).” These numbers translate to 188 \( = 9.0 / 0.048\) to 193 \( = 2.7 / 0.014\) weeks. Dividing by 52 weeks per year gives 3.7. \(2\) Benjamin and colleagues also report a genetic predictor of number of years of education that explains 3.2 percent of the variance of the trait. Therefore, the correlation between the predicted value and the actual value is √0.032 = 0.18. We can model this mathematically using a two-dimensional normal distribution. \(3\) The probability that a person who is in the bottom 5% of the predicted distribution \(more than 1.64 standard deviations below the average\) has more than 12 years of education is then given by the proportion of people who are in the bottom 5 percent of the predicted distribution and also have more than 12 years of education \(which can be calculated by measuring the area of the two-dimensional normal distribution that matches these criteria\), divided by 0.05. This gives a probability of 60 percent. A similar calculation for the proportion of people in the top 5 percent of the predicted distribution gives a probability of 84 percent. \(4\) The Benjamin study also suggests that with enough samples it would be possible to build a reliable genetic predictor that accounts for 20 percent of the variance. Redoing the calculation using 20 percent instead of 3.2 percent leads to a prediction that 37 percent of people in the bottom 5 percent of the predicted distribution would complete twelve years of education compared to 96 percent of the top 5 percent.

[^48]: I performed this computation as follows. \(1\) The 99.9999999th percentile of a trait corresponds to 6.0 standard deviations from the mean, whereas the 99.99999th percentile corresponds to 5.2 standard deviations. Thus a 0.8-standard-deviation shift corresponds to a hundredfold enrichment of individuals. \(2\) I assumed that the 1.33-fold higher genetic variation in sub-Saharan Africans applies not just to random mutations in the genome, but also to mutations modulating biological traits. The standard deviation is thus expected to be 1.15 = √1.33-fold higher in sub-Saharan Africans based on a formula in J. J. Berg and G. Coop, “A Population Genetic Signal of Polygenic Adaptation,” *PLoS Genetics* 10 \(2014\): e1004412, so the 6.0-standard-deviation cutoff in non-Africans corresponds to 5.2 = 6.0 / 1.15 of that in sub-Saharan Africans, leading to the same predicted hundredfold enrichment above the 99.9999999th percentile.
