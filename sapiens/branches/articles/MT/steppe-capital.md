There is an interesting parallel across steppe-derived civilizations that persisted across time & even post-settlement. Did the steppe-derived empires have a capital? The Chingizid great Khans invested in building a grand capital, Qaraqorum whose etymology is uncertain. Today it is a fairly remote township near Erdene Zuu. A relative who visited it said he found it to be a great place for meditation in solitude. 

Chingiz Khan rallied his people in an assembly of yurts at Qaraqorum before campaigns but the more permanent structures were built by his son Ogodei. He is said to have installed several robots there which have striking parallels to those constructed by the great bhojadeva paramAra. It suggests that such technology had survived & reached Mongolia in the 200 years after him. 1st person accounts survive of how the robots would respond to the Khan's (tactile?) commands& play music& serve kumis. While the Khan held annual festivals @ Qaraqorum& entertained guests/embassies there on special occasions, his court did not live there most of the time. Instead they moved around the empire with their herds.

(I'm yet to find information regarding the actual origin of the engineers who built the robots in Qaraqorum. It is possible they were from Turkomans like you mention though we cannot rule out other sources. As for the Turkoman robots themselves, I have long suspected H influence for example the peacock fountain or moving peacock. But then there was also the possibility of survival of more proximal greek Archimedean knowledge via Neo-Platonic theurgical devices. The capture of Hindu artisans during the Islamic raids of the Ghaznavids/Ghurids& their sale in Mohammedan markets could be a mode of transmission that has been largely neglected by Western Islamic boosterists. It is notable that down to the Timurid times there was an interest in capturing and shipping off H artisans during the jihads on al Hind.)


Favereau points out that this tendency was not restricted to the empire in the days of the great Khans but also in the successor states the Jochid horde. The Jochids built a similar capital at Saray on the lower Volga but moved around through their ulus with their herds rather staying in the Qaraqorum look-alike. 

Probably even greater mobility was seen in Khans of the Chagadaid horde & its fragment Mogholistan. They similarly had a center set up at Almaliq, close to an urban center of the old Uighur Khaghanate but extensively roved the steppes throughout their ulus. 

The same trend was retained by their Islamized successors arising from non-Chingizid lines of the Dughlats & Barlas-es (i.e., Timurids). This was continued down to the massive moving courts of the monstrous "son-in-laws" in India till the resurgent H under the marahaTTa-s restricted them to dilli. 

But looking back in time one is reminded of shruti-vAkya that the v1s & v2s are unstable (=mobile) but the v3 bring the stability reminding us of our own comparable steppe heritage. This spirit animates both the itihAsa-s where the Arya lords essentially, for most of the text, move around like their ancestors on the steppe rather than staying put in their rAjadhAni-s. This continued down to the times of the puShyabhUti harShavardhana, who rather than staying put at sthaneshvara or kAnykubja roved around his empire as in a large moving camp (also noticed by the chIna visitor/Tang spy Xuanzang). 

In passing we may note the fortifications in Sintashta sites were probably the equivalents of such rAjadhAni-s when our ancestors still roved the steppe.
