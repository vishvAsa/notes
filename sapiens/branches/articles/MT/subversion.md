In a discussion with a friend, we wondered if: the Anglo-Abrahamistic (the Brits and CIA) intelligence agencies are best at sowing discord in the targeted nation  
by inciting malcontents into rebellion and then arming them.  
The pretamata is often used as a wedge in the process. 


In contrast, the rUs were more effective in the art of raising agent provocateurs and effective assassinations. 

The mUlavAtUla-s appear to have inherited their tradition primarily from rUs side, where some of their cousins were active.
