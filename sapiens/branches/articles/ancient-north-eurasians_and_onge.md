Lot of talk is made of the Indo-Europeans on here but not enough of the grandfathers of the Indo-Europeans: the Ancient North Eurasians (ANE). This is tragic, especially for us Indians who are quite closely descended from the ANE on all sides of our ancestry. Two of our most common haplogroups (R1a and R2) are from the ANE. The former indirectly from Steppe Pastoralists and the latter from Indus Zagrosian Farmers.

Haplogroup R2 is like the cool version of R1. It’s unique to South Asia & some parts of Central Asia. In general, we Indians have about 20-35% ANE ancestry, which is one of the highest in the world. Only Native Americans & North Siberian/Uralics have higher ANE affinity. What’s cool as hell about the ANE is that they are the fathers of all Native Americans as well! (Y-DNA Q).

All this gets even wilder, because ANE are about 75% West Eurasian: 25% SEast Eurasian. But their SE Eurasian comes from Tianyuan man, a closely related cousin population of Onge & Andamanese Jarwas. However, their paternal lineage comes from Tianyuan, not from West Eurasians. What this means is that haplogroup R (R1, R2), Q (Q1a/b, Q2) ultimately are descendant lineages of Onge/Andaman-like Tianyuan people who were living in Siberia and fathered a mixed population called the Ancient North Eurasians. This is confirmed by fact that haplogroup P, the father lineage of R1a, R1b, R2, R* is found in the Jarwa tribals of modern India.
