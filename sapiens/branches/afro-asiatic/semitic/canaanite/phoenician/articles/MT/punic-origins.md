title = "Punic origins"

One of the more stunning aDNA results from recent times - [TW](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-08913-3). The Punics, despite linguistic and cultural evidence, hardly have any Levantine Phoenician ancestry! Instead, they seem to be an Aegean and Sicilian derived population in a cline with North Africans (their Carthaginian branch).

That opens the big question of how they became cultural Phoenicians?
