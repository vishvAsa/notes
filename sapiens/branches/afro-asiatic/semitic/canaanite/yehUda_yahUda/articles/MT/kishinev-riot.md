A riot in rUs empire in the obscure town of Kishinev breaking out over a rumor of u1s using a u2's blood in a ritual resulted in several of the former being killed by the latter. This event had a direct role in origin of the modern state of ISR. A u1 poet laments their weakness

> Come, now, and I will bring thee to their lairs  
The privies, jakes and pigpens where the heirs  
Of Hasmoneans lay, with trembling knees,  
Concealed and cowering, the sons of the Maccabees!  
The seed of saints, the scions of the lions!  
Who, crammed by scores in all the sanctuaries of their shame,  
So sanctified My name!  
It was the flight of mice they fled,  
The scurrying of roaches was their flight;  
They died like dogs, and they were dead!  
And on the next morn, after the terrible night  
The son who was not murdered found  
The spurned cadaver of his father on the ground.  
Now wherefore cost thou weep, O son of man?

This poet whose verses are appended above is HN Bialik, a key religio-intellectual figure for modern ISR.

He felt that his folks had fallen without putting a fight befitting their zealot religious warrior ancestors, whom he mentions in the verses. There may be a parallel to the post-Gandhian feeling among many H of their impotence under attack -- e.g., the god-fearing moplahs. It was the sentiment among u1s in the aftermath of this communal riot that led to the formation of the core of the ISR army and a more radical change in attitude that allowed them to wrest ISR later in the 1900s. 

Even in their midst there was considerable debate between those who believed in the coexistence with "brother Ishmail" like the H-M bhai-bhai sentiment widely endorsed by the H leadership. But reality hit them. This book (Pogrom: Kishinev and the Tilt of History) has a good account of the riot and its aftermath with deep ramifications for u1 thought to this date
