It is unclear if the marUnmatta-s had any strategy in their current ghazwat. It was heavy on tactical effervescence -- something also previously seen with their coreligionist from the occupied pA~nchanada & sindhu -- but not clear if it aimed to achieve anything strategically. It that sense it was just like the 9/11 attack -- mass civilian deaths for shock value that will draw the attention of the world. 

While such a shock value is deeply engrained in the principle of the jihad since its founder, these attacks seem slightly different from say the Kenyan mall ghazwat or 26/11. In the former, there seems to have been a strategic objective directed at Kenya. I also see 26/11 as a deliberate attempt by the marUnmatta-s to paralyze a H economic center and take the sheen of "Indian growth". 

Along with the shock value the current ghazwat also has shades of historical raids to take women+children+booty, going back to the founding of marUnmAda, rather than engage in pitched military confrontations. Perhaps some booty was taken in the form of Israeli armaments. It reminds one of Ahmed Niyaltegin's assault on kAshI. 

But it will probably be a strategic failure for the proximal marUnmatta players just as it was for bin Laden et al in 9/11. The US & its vassals while suffering some Islamic attacks overall managed to stamp out that threat on their own territory. The mistake the US made was the attempt to bring their neo-religious ideologies through conquest to the marUnmatta lands -- "democracy" & navyonmAda under piNDaka. This blew on their face. 

Given Israel's military superiority, it is likely to decisively destroy it attackers but (at least to me) it remains an open question if they would succeed in successfully conquering some of the marUnmatta lands and making them their own. 

Things could also be complicated if the trans-national neo-con faction tries to expand the conflict in directions they like. You can already see them wanting to blame it on the rUs (!) & open a front with the Islamic state in Iran. There hastin frontend, paTTinI made a ridiculous statement. 

None of this might be useful for the Israelis but they could be sucked into it in the heat of the moment. Their situation is different from that of the H. H have enemies on multiple fronts & the mlechCha-s could tacitly help the marUnmatta-s. So at this point from the H perspective a lot is hanging on the Indian intelligence to read any comparable designs the maru-s may have for a ghazwa al-hind

## US entry
Israel is central to the identity of the American leadership & a significant part of its voting population -- perhaps, as an idea, it is even more important than the idea of America for many. Hence, it is not surprising that many want the US to directly enter the war. Suddenly that has taken precedence over the war with the rUs. It was not for nothing that the crusades were launched. The alliances have changed (in the crusades there were some fierce u2 on u1 attacks & u1 collaboration with u3) but the animating spirit has not. However, we feel the end-result of a such a US involvement would not be good for the US, which in the past 20+ years has engaged primarily in wars with no clear strategic objectives or even understanding of the targets. This is where they differ from the former leaders of the anglosphere.
