The Mar1 conjunction of Jupiter (above) and Venus (below) over a palm tree seen from a beach in Jaffa, Isr. 


Our theological rather adventurous guide (but probably closer to the original religious situation) remarked that it is like the 2 Semitic deities El from the North (with a prAjApatya character -- my comment) & Yahoo from the south with an aindravAyava character) being conflated into a mono-deity with the rise of monolatrous religion among the tribes of the region. He remarks that the Southern predecessors of the modern paleo-Abrahamists were Yahoo focal whereas the northern ones were more El focal. 

The celestial connection of Yahoo is said to be in the form his armies being planets & stars. 

The celestial connection of El is the form meteoritic -- baetyls -- which persisted in its Arabic reflex through the marUnmAdan purge of their old religion. Also the perverted Roman emperor Elagabalus.
