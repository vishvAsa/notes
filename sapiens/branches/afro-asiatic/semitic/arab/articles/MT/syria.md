One of the questions is who are going to make territorial gains from the dismemberment of Syria. 

The Jews and the Turks seem to have already seized territory: this was probably pre-arranged with the mahAmlechCha. 

A Kurdistan seems to be in the making -- the question is whether the Turks would move on that. What an how much the mahAmlechCha-allied Al Qaeda will keep is a question. Also we'll have to see how the manage the spill over to Iraq.
