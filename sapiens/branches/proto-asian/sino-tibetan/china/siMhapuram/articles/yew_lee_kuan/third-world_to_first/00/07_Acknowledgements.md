Andrew Tan Kok Kiong started research for these memoirs in 1995. He was an officer in the Singapore administrative service, seconded to Singapore Press Holdings \(SPH\) to help me. The prime minister, Goh Chok Tong, allowed me access to all records and documents in the government ministries and in the archives. The registry officer in the prime minister’s office, Florence Ler Chay Keng, and her assistants, Wendy Teo Kwee Geok and Vaijayanthimala, were tireless and thorough in tracing files and documents. With the help of Pang Gek Choo, who worked for the *Straits Times*, and Alan Chong, a young political science graduate, Andrew searched through government records, minutes of important meetings, correspondence and other relevant documents. Most useful were the notes I dictated immediately after meetings and conversations.

Andrew Tan was able and resourceful. He coordinated the work of the researchers, organised the material, and made my task easier. Pang Gek Choo was quick and efficient in tracing reports of events and speeches in the Straits Times library and archives. In 1997, when the work expanded, Walter Fernandez and Yvonne Lim from SPH and Dr Goh Ai Ting from the National University of Singapore \(NUS\) joined my researchers.

Panneer Selvan from the ministry of foreign affairs helped retrieve records of my dealings with foreign leaders. Lily Tan, director of the National Archives, produced many useful documents and oral history transcripts of those who had allowed me to read them. The staff at the NUS library, the National Library and the Straits Times editorial library were always helpful.

John Dickie, former diplomatic correspondent of the *Daily Mail*, gave much valuable advice, especially on what would interest a British reader. My good friend Gerald Hensley, New Zealand’s former high commissioner in Singapore and later secretary for defence, gave good suggestions.

*Straits Times* writers, Cheong Yip Seng \(editor-in-chief\), Han Fook Kwang, Warren Fernandez, Zuraidah Ibrahim, Irene Ng and Chua Mui Hoong proposed many changes, making the book easier to read, especially for those without background knowledge of the events I described.

Lim Jim Koon, editor of *Lianhe Zaobao*, read through the whole draft before its translation into Chinese. Seng Han Thong, formerly of *Lianhe Zaobao*, now in the National Trades Union Congress \(NTUC\), went through many versions of the drafts before finally settling the Chinese translation.

Guntor Sadali, editor of *Berita Harian*, minister for community development, Abdullah Tarmugi, senior parliamentary secretary, Zainul Abidin Rasheed, and parliamentary secretaries Mohamad Maidin and Yaacob Ibrahim gave their views on all the chapters relating to Malays. I wanted to avoid unintentionally hurting Malay sensitivities and have tried hard not to do so.

Old friends and colleagues, Goh Keng Swee, Lim Kim San, Ong Pang Boon, Othman Wok, Lee Khoon Choy, Rahim Ishak, Maurice Baker, Sim Kee Boon, S.R. Nathan \(now our President\) and Ngiam Tong Dow, read various parts of my drafts and corrected or confirmed my recollection of events.

My drafts were also read by Kishore Mahbubani \(permanent representative to the United Nations\), Chan Heng Chee \(ambassador to Washington\), Bilahari Kausikan \(deputy secretary, ministry of foreign affairs\), Tommy Koh \(ambassador at large\) and Lee Tsao Yuan \(director of the Institute of Policy Studies\). Their valuable advice as diplomats, writers and academics helped me give the book a better focus.

Shova Loh, line editor in Times Media, meticulously cleaned up the final draft.

My three personal assistants, Wong Lin Hoe, Loh Hock Teck and Koh Kiang Chay, worked tirelessly, often late into the evenings, to take in every amendment and check for accuracy. They went well beyond the call of duty. To all of them and others too numerous to name, I express my grateful thanks. The errors and shortcomings that remain are mine.

As with the first volume, my wife Choo went through every page many times until she was satisfied that what I had written was clear and easy to read.
