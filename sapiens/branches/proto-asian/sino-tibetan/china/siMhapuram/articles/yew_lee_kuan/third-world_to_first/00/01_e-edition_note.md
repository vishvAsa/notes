**Authorâ€™s Note to the eBook Edition**

I wrote my Memoirs for a younger generation of Singaporeans to know the story of the Singapore I grew up in. \(*The Singapore Story* was published in 1999 and *From Third World to First* in 2000.\) It was to give them an understanding of the difficulties Singapore faced then in its struggle to survive in the midst of larger, newly independent nations pursuing nationalistic policies.

It is a different world and a different Singapore today, a world vastly changed by globalization and technology but the threats remain and the challenge to national survival is grave.

It is my hope that the experiences of my generation find relevance with a generation that grew up with digital literacy and technology. I look forward to this digital version reaching out to that generation of online readers.
