Their isolation made the Taiwanese keen to develop ties with Singapore in the early years. On our part, we were anxious not to be completely dependent on the Israelis for military training. Initial discussions began in 1967. They sent a top-level representative who saw Keng Swee, then defence minister, and me. By December they had submitted a proposal for building up an air force. We were keen to train our pilots and naval officers in Taiwan; the Israelis could not offer such facilities. The Taiwanese defence ministry was helpful, but every now and again would hint that when their foreign ministry got wind of their defence assistance, they would require some form of diplomatic recognition in return. We made it clear that we could not give way on this.

When the Taiwanese did set up the “Office of the Trade Representative of the Republic of China” in Singapore in 1969, it was clearly agreed that this exchange of trade missions was not recognition of either state or government by the other. We did not want to get entangled with the mainland’s claim as the sole government of China, including Taiwan.

When the UN resolution for the admission of the People’s Republic of China \(PRC\) came up, we voted for the resolution to admit China but abstained on the resolution to expel Taiwan. Our policy was to remain consistent: there was “one China”, and the reunification of the PRC and Taiwan was an internal matter to be resolved between the two.

The links between Taiwan’s National Security Bureau and our ministry of defence had resulted in their lending us some Taiwanese flying instructors and several technicians and mechanics to get our aircraft maintenance section started. When the director of their National Security Bureau proposed that I visit Taiwan to meet their premier, Chiang Ching-kuo, son of President Chiang Kai-shek, in Taipei in May 1973, I agreed. Premier Chiang and his Russian wife met Choo and me at the airport, drove with us to the Grand Hotel and showed us to our suite. The following day, we flew with him in his VIP Boeing 707 to an air base, where he put on a half hour scramble-and-take-off demonstration by an airforce unit. Then we drove together to Sun Moon Lake, a holiday resort, where we spent two days getting to know each other.

At a dinner in Taipei I met his foreign minister, finance minister, economic affairs minister, chief of general staff and director of National Security Bureau, and so made the acquaintance of his top trusted aides. Apart from my good personal chemistry with Chiang Ching-kuo, the foundation of our relationship was that we were both against communism. The Chinese Communist Party was his mortal enemy and the Malayan Communist Party, which was linked to the Chinese Communist Party, was mine. We had a common cause.

He spoke English haltingly and his Mandarin was difficult to understand because of his heavy Zhejiang accent. He understood my English, and together with my Mandarin we were able to do without an interpreter. This was crucial in establishing empathy which later developed into rapport. I explained the geopolitical situation in Southeast Asia, how Singapore was viewed as a third China, after China and Taiwan. We could not deny our racial, cultural and language links, but the fact that we were against the Malayan communists reassured our neighbours that we would not be a Trojan horse for a communist China.

Our trade representative in Taipei reported later that the premier had a good opinion of Singapore and of me, and was pleased to have met me. One factor definitely helped: my daughter, then a young medical student, had accompanied us. She is Chinese-educated and speaks Mandarin fluently. Her demeanour identified her immediately as Chinese. It made a crucial difference to how Chiang Ching-kuo perceived my wife, my daughter and me, and helped determine relations between Singapore and Taiwan. A close friendship developed between Chiang and me in an exchange of correspondence.

There was a total news blackout on my visit, both in Taiwan and Singapore. It was at my request, to avoid international attention and controversy.

When I visited Taiwan again in December 1974 Premier Chiang took a personal interest in my programme. He lined up navy and marine corps units for a ceremonial drive-past, as for a visiting head of state, all without publicity. He also accompanied me to view his country’s progress, including major construction works like the East-West Highway built through difficult mountain terrain.

During this second visit I broached the subject of training our armed forces in Taiwan, because of Singapore’s limited space. We had discussed it with his military staff several months earlier. He was sympathetic. By April 1975 we had reached agreement for Singapore Armed Forces training in Taiwan under the code name “Exercise Starlight”. Valid initially for one year, it allowed us to train infantry, artillery, armour and commando units, dispersed all over Taiwan in areas used by their equivalent forces. They charged us only for what we consumed and no more.

Chiang had a fair, round face, wore thick horn-rimmed glasses, and had a fairly rotund figure. He was calm and quiet, with a soft voice. He did not pretend to be an intellectual but had a practical mind and keen social intelligence. He was a good judge of character and surrounded himself with trustworthy men who would give him honest advice even when unwelcome. When he spoke, it was after careful reflection because he was not given to casual commitments. He could not travel freely abroad and found me an additional source of information on developments in America and the wider world. He would ask keen, searching questions on changes in the geopolitical scene. Until he became infirm in the mid-1980s, Chiang would accompany me around Taiwan on each of my visits of three to four days. In a free-ranging exchange, he would test on me his assessments and views of political events formed from reading reports. He felt his international isolation keenly.

From 1973 to 1990, I visited Taiwan once or twice a year, nearly always stopping over in Hong Kong. It was instructive and inspiring to see the economic and social progress of the Chinese in Taiwan, with 8–10 per cent annual growth. From a low-wage, labour-intensive economy based on agriculture and manufacture of textiles, garments and sports shoes, they moved steadily upmarket. At first they pirated expensive medical, legal and other textbooks which they sold at ridiculously low prices. By the 1980s they were printing them under licence on quality paper and in hard covers. By the 1990s they were making computer chips, motherboards, PCs, laptops and other high-tech products. I had observed a similar upgrading of the economy and living standards in Hong Kong. The rapid progress of these two maritime Chinese communities gave me great encouragement. I picked up useful pointers. If they could make it, so could Singapore.

The Chinese in Taiwan, without the straitjacket of communism and a centrally planned economy, were racing ahead. Taiwan, like Hong Kong, had minimal welfare. This was to change with the introduction of popular elections in the early 1990s. The opposition pressed for and got the government to implement medical, pension and other social security benefits, so the budget ran into deficit. With a rambunctious opposition in the legislature, the government in the 1990s had difficulty increasing taxes to balance the budget. Fortunately, so far Taiwanese workers remain better motivated than their Western counterparts.

Chiang and his ministers were proudest of their advances in education. Every student was educated at least to junior middle school, nine years, and by the 1990s some 30 per cent were university graduates. Their finance minister, K.T. Li, lamented the brain drain. From the 1960s, out of some 4,500 graduate students who went to America for PhDs every year, only 500 would return. As Taiwan rose in the economic league tables, Li set out to attract some of their best to return, those who had worked in top research laboratories and in the big electronic multinationals. He built a science park near Taipei and provided them with cheap loans to start their businesses in semi-conductors. Their computer industry took off. These men had built up networks with Americans in the computer industry and acquired the knowledge and expertise that enabled them to keep abreast of the latest developments and to market their products. They were supported by locally educated Taiwanese engineers and technicians.



The 2–3 million mainlanders who came over with General Chiang Kai-shek’s forces had included a thick layer of intellectuals, administrators, scholars and entrepreneurs. They were the catalyst that transformed Taiwan into an economic powerhouse.

However, the mainlander elite in Taiwan knew they were in a difficult position in the long term. They were a minority of about 15 per cent. Gradually but inexorably, both the bureaucracy and the officer corps of the armed forces, originally manned by mainlanders or their children, came to have increasing numbers of Taiwanese. It was only a matter of time before the Taiwanese, 90 per cent of the population, swung their political weight. Chiang and his senior aides recognised this. They were selecting from among the Taiwanese those they considered the most reliable and dependable – people who would continue their policy to stand firm against the communists on the mainland, yet never go for an independent, separate Taiwan, which was anathema to the mainlanders.

By the mid-1980s a younger generation of educated Taiwanese had risen through the ranks of officialdom. We changed our trade representative, who was from Chiang’s own province of Zhejiang, to one who could speak the local Min-nan dialect, a sub-dialect of Fujian province. We could see a different Taiwan emerging. We had to know the Taiwanese in the bureaucracy associated with the Kuomintang \(KMT\), but steered clear of Taiwanese dissidents who wanted independence. Their organisations were illegal, and several were imprisoned for sedition.

In the mid-1980s I noticed Chiang’s health had declined markedly. He could no longer accompany me around Taiwan. From our conversations I gathered he was being pressed by the US media and Congress to democratise the political system. Chiang lifted martial law and began this process. His son Hsiao-wu, their trade representative in Singapore, had filled me in on his father’s thinking. I told Chiang that to ensure Taiwan’s security he had to retain the support not only of President Reagan, but also of the US media and Congress because Reagan needed the backing of both. Later, Chiang allowed the unofficial opposition, which had been illegal, to participate in elections for the Legislative Yuan.

Chiang died in January 1988. He had enjoyed enormous domestic prestige which helped to manage the forces unleashed by his recent lifting of martial law. I attended his funeral. Also present to pay their respects were many Japanese and American leaders, former prime ministers and high office holders, but no current incumbents. It was a traditional Chinese-style funeral. His body was taken to a temporary resting place outside Taipei, to be kept, like his father Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek’s, for eventual interment in their county in Zhejiang province, south of Shanghai.



Vice-President Lee Teng-hui then took over. I had met him first as mayor of Taipei, then as the governor of Taiwan province. Occasionally we played golf. He was competent, industrious and deferential to his superiors, especially the president and the mainlander ministers. He was then a friendly self-effacing official, tall, with greying hair, thick glasses and a wide smile. Before Chiang Ching-kuo chose him as vice-president in 1984 several other native Taiwanese KMT leaders had been considered but thought less suitable. I assumed Chiang must have been absolutely satisfied that he was reliable and could be trusted to continue Chiang’s policies never to allow an independent Taiwan.

For a few years President Lee Teng-hui continued the KMT’s settled policy of one China and no independent Taiwan. He set out to win over enough of the old guard and a few of the young guard mainlanders in the KMT to take complete control of the party. All those in key positions who gave contrary views or unwelcome advice were soon removed, including Hau Pei-tsun, the premier, and Fredrick Chien Fu, his foreign minister who had advised against his visit to America in 1995. Lee rapidly democratised the system to place more Taiwanese in key appointments and strengthen his hold on the KMT and the country. The KMT old guard had earlier told me they expected and accepted the inevitability of this. But they did not know how swiftly President Lee would shift political power to the 90 per cent majority through popular elections to the national assembly and Legislative Yuan. He transformed the KMT itself until eventually many left it to form the New Party, a move which seriously weakened the KMT’s grip on power.

Once he had consolidated his position, President Lee began to express his feelings in words which caused the leaders in Beijing to conclude that he wanted to keep Taiwan separate from China for as long as possible. In 1992 President Lee announced his terms for reunification. He defined “one China” as the Republic of China, not the People’s Republic of China. National reunification would only be achieved under a “free, prosperous and democratic China” – in other words, communist China must first become as democratic as Taiwan. I did not know then that this was intended as a fixed, unbridgeable position, not a starting point for negotiations.

In April 1994 President Lee gave an interview to Ryotaro Shiba, a well-known Japanese journalist. It was published in a Japanese magazine and never denied. In it, he said the KMT was a party of outsiders, that the Taiwanese people had suffered greatly under the occupation of outsiders, which included the KMT government, and that “Difficulties will lie ahead of Moses and his people … ‘Exodus’ may be a kind of fit conclusion.” For a president of Taiwan to talk of Moses leading his people to the Promised Land was a statement China could not ignore.



Native Taiwanese harboured a deep grievance against the mainlanders for the “2-28” incident. Around 28 February 1947 thousands of native Taiwanese were killed by Nationalist troops for expressing their resentment against the mainlanders who behaved not as liberators but as overlords. All public reference to this tragedy was suppressed, but it lived on in the memory of the local population and broke into the open when a Taiwanese became president. To his credit, President Lee kept in check any attempt to settle past scores.

Popular elections tend to reopen these old wounds and accentuate the divide between native Taiwanese and mainlanders. To appeal to the 90 per cent majority, politicians emphasise their indigenous identity. They campaign in the local Min-nan dialect and ridicule mainlander opponents for their inability to speak the language. Some even question the allegiance of mainlanders to Taiwan.

Older mainlander leaders felt hurt by these divisive attacks. Mainlander scholars had helped build universities and nurtured many able native Taiwanese. Outstanding mainlander leaders like Premiers Y.S. Sun and Yu Kuo-hwa and Finance Minister K.T. Li had crafted the policies that transformed Taiwan from an agricultural into an industrial economy. They laid the foundation for Taiwan’s considerable success.

A more grievous result of electioneering has been the growing involvement of triads \(Chinese mafia or secret societies\). The KMT’s triad links date from pre-war Shanghai days, when General Chiang Kai-shek used them to fight the communists. They accompanied him to Taiwan. A Taiwanese mafia has flourished and taken root. As long as elections did not lead to real power, the government was able to control them.

When the political system opened up in the late 1980s and elections became contests for real power, the triads soon discovered that they could get themselves elected into positions of power. By 1996, when 10 per cent of the national and 30 per cent of the local legislatures were secret society members, they were a political force. Corruption and vote-buying have become entrenched. Once in office, they have to recoup their expenditure.

A free press has not been able to check corruption \(“black gold”\) or suppress the triads which it has compared to the Sicilian mafia. They have become so powerful that when a notorious triad leader was killed by a rival gang in 1996, the secretary-general of the office of President Lee Teng-hui paid public homage by sending a traditional funeral scroll to win over his followers. The deputy legislative speaker and other prominent legislators were present at the funeral, as were several opposition leaders. The mafia has penetrated the construction industry, agricultural cooperatives and even the baseball league. It has muscled its way into annual general meetings of listed companies and cash-rich temple committees, and even started recruiting members in schools.

In June 2000, two weeks after his appointment, the first non-KMT justice minister, Chen Ding-nan, said:

“In the East Asia region, Taiwan has the most serious cases of corruption and has failed to do anything about it for the past 50 years. Lee Teng-hui is the source of Taiwan’s black-gold politics. He knew where it was and did little more than talk about the need to combat it. That was the reason why former justice ministers were forced to step down because they took Mr Lee’s words to heart and tried to clean up. The atmosphere, the culture, the people – it can easily influence judges and police and even the legislative officials. We need them to take responsibility.”



I received President Lee in Singapore in 1989, the first visit by a Taiwanese president to Southeast Asia. I extended him all the personal courtesies due to a visiting head of state. But although we had not then established diplomatic relations with the PRC, I decided the protocol level would not be that for a head of state. There were no flags, no guard of honour, no ceremonial trappings of a state visit. In all public statements, we referred to him as President Lee “from Taiwan”, not “of Taiwan”. Nevertheless that visit raised his political profile in the region.

Because I had acted as a channel for messages between the two sides, the PRC and Taiwan chose Singapore as the venue for their first-ever talks, in April 1993. The Chinese named it “Wang-Koo Talks” after the surnames of the leaders who officially represented “unofficial” organisations on both sides. I met both delegation leaders separately and knew that they were entrusted by their respective presidents with different agendas. Koo Chen-fu, representing Taiwan, wanted to settle only technical matters like authentication of documents and verification of lost registered mail; his president did not want any discussions on liberalisation of trade, let alone reunification. Wang Daohan wanted these preliminaries to lead to substantive discussions on reunification. As expected, the talks did not improve relations.


President Lee is a voracious reader with an enormous capacity for absorbing information. He had been educated in Japanese schools in Taiwan when it was Formosa, a Japanese colony. During the war, he was among the few Taiwanese chosen to be educated in Japanese universities, in his case Kyoto Imperial University, second in prestige only to Tokyo Imperial University. He returned to Taiwan after the war to complete his university education in Taipei. Later, he went on to America for two stints, the second of which was in Cornell where he did a PhD in agricultural economics.

By preference, he proudly told me, he read four top Japanese papers every day and watched NHK TV by satellite from Tokyo. Even for books, he preferred to read Japanese translations rather than the English originals because he found them easier reading. Steeped as he was in Japanese history and culture, he did not think much of the mainland, either its history and culture or its present communist leaders, viewing them with the eyes of a Japanese-trained elite. He had a disdain for the communist leaders, and publicly called them “blockheads”, “stupid” and “damaged brains”. The Chinese leaders never returned these compliments, but I felt sure some desk officer in Beijing dutifully recorded them.

I found him self-confident, well-read and well-briefed on every subject that interested him. But because of Taiwan’s isolation, he could not understand why world leaders did not sympathise with Taiwan as the Japanese did. He considered Japan’s sympathy and support for Taiwan of great importance. He also believed that if he followed the prescriptions of American liberals and the US Congress for democracy and human rights, the United States would defend him against communist China.

I could not understand President Lee’s position. An old friend of his explained that his Japanese training had imbued him with the bushido spirit of the Japanese warrior, and he considered it his mission to lead the people of Taiwan to the “promised land”. Lee, this friend added, was also a devout Christian who would do God’s will at all costs, fired by the bushido spirit.

In June 1995, after powerful lobbying, President Lee got the US Congress to pass a unanimous resolution to give him a visa to visit Cornell, his alma mater. That visit and the speech he made at Cornell had a far graver impact than the US Congress expected. I had feared some reaction, but did not realise the depth of China’s distrust for President Lee and the implications they read into the US president’s decision to allow the visit. Later that year, in October, I asked Premier Li Peng why he was so convinced that Lee Teng-hui wanted independence. Li Peng said they had watched the whole video recording of Lee Teng-hui’s speech in Cornell. Lee did not refer at all to one China, but emphasised Taiwan, and called it the Republic of China on Taiwan. This conviction led in March 1996 to the most serious confrontation between the two sides since the 1958 crisis in Quemoy. The Chinese deployed troops and conducted military exercises in Fujian province opposite Taiwan, and fired missiles that landed in waters near important seaports on Taiwan’s west coast.

To moderate the situation, on 3 March 1996 I made this plea: “China’s leaders have referred to me as an old friend. I am an older friend of Taiwan. If either one is damaged, Singapore will suffer a loss. If both are damaged, Singapore’s loss will be doubled. Singapore benefits when both prosper, when both cooperate and help each other prosper.” Vice-Premier Qian Qichen, China’s foreign minister, at a press conference said this was an internal matter, that although I knew more about Taiwan than most outsiders, this was not a matter that involved outsiders. This gentle rebuff did not surprise me as it was in keeping with their basic stand that this was an internal “Chinese” problem to be resolved directly between the leaders on both sides.

Meanwhile, President Lee began to de-emphasise Taiwan’s Chinese-ness. From the end of the war in 1945 until the death of Chiang Ching-kuo in 1988, their schools and universities taught in the national language \(Mandarin\). Students learnt the history and geography of mainland China of which Taiwan was a province. Now, schools teach more of the history and geography of Taiwan, and less of China. As early as 1989, soon after Chiang died, I could sense the embarrassment of Premier Yu Kuo-hwa, a mainlander, who accompanied me on a visit to Taitung, an old Japanese hot spring resort. After dinner, in a karaoke session, the local Taiwanese ministers sang Min-nan songs, which Yu did not understand.

During his 12 years as president, Lee voiced separatist sentiments that had lain dormant in Taiwan. He underestimated the will of the leaders and people of the Chinese mainland to keep Taiwan firmly within China’s fold. Lee’s policies could only prevail with the support of the United States. By acting as though such support would be forthcoming for all time, he led the people of Taiwan to believe that they did not need to negotiate seriously on Taiwan’s future with China’s leaders. His contribution to Taiwan’s future has been to turn the reunification issue into the most important item on Beijing’s national agenda.

China’s leaders closely watched the election campaign for the next president in March 2000. They were concerned with the rising support for Chen Shui-bian, candidate of the Democratic Progressive Party. Native Taiwanese nationalists who formed this party had long fought for Taiwan’s independence and been imprisoned and punished by the KMT government under President Chiang Kai-shek and his son, President Chiang Ching-kuo. On 22 February 2000 Beijing media published a State Council White Paper to warn that if Taiwan refused to discuss reunification indefinitely China would have to use force. It was directed at Chen. On March 15, three days before the vote, Premier Zhu Rongji in a live television press conference warned the Taiwanese that China would shed blood to protect its territory.

Chen Shui-bian won with less than 40 per cent of the vote against independent candidate James Soong with 36 per cent. The KMT candidate, Lien Chan, the incumbent vice-president, lost badly. President Lee Teng-hui was seen to have abandoned Lien Chan by a perfunctory campaign in Lien’s support. Several of Lee’s closest friends endorsed Chen. This added to the distrust of China’s leaders for Chen. Beijing said it would wait and see, listen to what Chen would say and watch what he would do. Chen made conciliatory statements after he was declared the winner but none of the statements committed him to eventual reunification. President Jiang Zemin said talks could only resume under the principle of one China. Chen said one China could be an item for discussion. At his inauguration on 20 May, Chen said “both sides possess enough wisdom and creativity to jointly deal with the question of a future ‘one China’.” He gave no cause for any precipitate action against Taiwan, but did not say enough to shake the mainland leaders’ belief that he would continue the “Lee Teng-hui era, without Lee Teng-hui”. Two hours after the speech, the mainland said he lacked sincerity. Beijing will probably wait until after they know in November 2000 who will be the next US president, before deciding on their course of action.

The stage may be set for a dramatic face-off. If the new president equivocates and does not agree to accept that Taiwan and the mainland are parts of one China, however defined, the situation will become volatile. No Chinese leader can survive if he is seen to “lose Taiwan”. The new president has two choices: carry on where Lee Teng-hui left off, which means conflict, or close that chapter and start a new one on a realistic basis. Taiwan has been separated from the mainland for over a hundred years since 1895. No Chinese in Taiwan relishes being reabsorbed into this huge mass of 1.2 billion. They prefer their different way of government, lifestyle and higher standard of living, which they have worked hard to achieve. Even the mainlanders who have been in Taiwan since 1949 and support reunification do not want it in the near future.

The United States may be able to stop China from using force for another 20 to 30 years. Within that time, China is likely to develop the military capability to control the straits. It may be wiser, before the military balance shifts to the mainland, to negotiate the terms for an eventual, not an immediate, reunification.

Assume that the worst has happened, that the mainland has used force and caused the United States to react and decisively defeat the PLA by superior technology. “Is that the end of the story?” I asked three American think-tankers soon after the elections in Taiwan. One replied, “That is the beginning of the story.” He had thought through the problem. If superior US technology frustrates them, it is not difficult to imagine 1,200 million Chinese being fired by one powerful urge to show Americans they are not cowards and inferior.

For President Chen Shui-bian to continue Lee Teng-hui’s policy of creating a separate and distinct Taiwanese national identity will confirm Beijing’s suspicions that he has set Taiwan’s course on independence. This will increase the danger of a precipitate solution to the issue of reunification. If Taiwan becomes an independent nation, Lee Teng-hui will go down in Taiwan’s history as a hero. If Taiwan is reunited with the mainland by force, history will not be so kind to a man who brought unnecessary pain and suffering on the Chinese people in Taiwan.

The Chinese people on both sides of the straits can lessen their problems by establishing easier relations over the years. If there is to be a peaceful reunification there has to be a gradual blurring, not an accentuation of the differences that at present divide and distinguish the two societies. Both need time to work and narrow the social, economic and political gap. The sense of belonging to the Chinese nation is weaker in Taiwan than Hong Kong. The mainland has the weight and girth to accept this and adopt an open and magnanimous approach to help this process of reconciliation. Reunification achieved by force will leave indelible scars. On the other hand, Taiwan’s leaders have the responsibility not to move towards independence or deliberately widen the differences between the two societies.
