+++

“The title of this book, *From Third World to First*, expresses an aspiration of all developing countries but so far, alas, an achievement of very few. Singapore is one of those few. This account of its first years of independence written by its founding father, Lee Kuan Yew, will therefore be of great interest to people of other developing countries and to all those who are interested in their fate. It is also told with great clarity, in a refreshingly direct style.”

***— Kofi A. Annan***, *UN Secretary-General*

“More than forty years ago, Lee Kuan Yew transformed what was a poor, decrepit colony into a shining, rich and modern metropolis – all the time surrounded by hostile powers. With his brilliant, incisive intellect, he is one of the world’s most outspoken and respected statesmen. This book is a ‘must read’ for any student of modern Asia.”

***— Rupert Murdoch***, *Chairman and Chief Executive, News Corporation*

“Lee Kuan Yew is one of the brightest, ablest men I have ever met. *The Singapore Story* is a must read for people interested in a true Asian success story. From this book we also learn a lot about the thinking of one of this century’s truly visionary statesmen.”

***— George Bush***, *US President, 1989–93*

“In office, I read and analysed every speech of Harry’s. He had a way of penetrating the fog of propaganda and expressing with unique clarity the issues of our times and the way to tackle them. He was never wrong …”

***— Margaret Thatcher***, *British Prime Minister, 1979–90*

“For a country to rise from the threshold of subsistence to one of the highest living standards in the world in 30 years is no common achievement. … Mr Lee has gathered around himself the most brilliant minds, transforming the most exacting standards into a system of government.”

***— Jacques Chirac***, *French President since 1995*

“Candid, informed, forceful, brilliant: these attributes explain why leaders throughout the world have sought out Lee Kuan Yew – and the words apply to his great memoir. You can learn how to think about power and politics in the world, how to analyse intricate problems, how to lead a people.”

***— George P. Shultz***, *US Secretary of State, 1982–89*

He has much of moment to say to us as we steer our course into the future.”

***— Helmut Kohl***, *German Chancellor since 1992*

***— Helmut Schmidt***, *German Chancellor, 1974–82*

“This is a personal history of a man who, almost single-handedly, built a great nation from a small island. Mr Lee has also been a great friend and often an astute observer of Japan.

***— Kiichi Miyazawa***, *Japanese Prime Minister, 1991–93  
and Finance Minister since July 1998*

***— Siddhi Savetsila***, *Thai Foreign Minister, 1980–90*

***— Bob Hawke***, *Australian Prime Minister, 1983–91*

“This is a work every bit as insightful, astringent, opinionated and intelligent as we would have hoped for from its distinguished author.”

***— Paul Keating***, *Australian Prime Minister, 1991–96*

“This is the story of a man and his country. He returned to it when it was the rump of empire. He and it are now critical geopolitical pivots. These writings are as economic, modest and understated as he is.”

***— David Lange***, *New Zealand Prime Minister, 1984–89*

“He rightly makes the point that there is no book on ‘how to build a nation state’ but his own story sets out how he fashioned a new nation on the tiny island of Singapore.

***— Philip Moore***, *Deputy British High Commissioner to Singapore, 1963–65*

***— Scott McNealy***, *CEO, Sun Microsystems, Inc*.

“There are two equalisers in life: the Internet and education. Senior Minister Lee Kuan Yew is a world leader who understands this and is using the power of the Internet to position Singapore for survival and success in the Internet economy.”
