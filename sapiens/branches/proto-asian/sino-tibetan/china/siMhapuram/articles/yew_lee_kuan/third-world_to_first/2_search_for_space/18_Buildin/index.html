The Thai foreign ministry recruited their brightest and best, educated in British, European and Latin American universities. It was their glamour service, highly paid and much respected because of their foreign travels at a time when travel was rare. Their domestic administrators did not match the quality of their foreign service officers. They needed their best to fend off encroachments by the British from Burma and by the French from Indochina.

  <p>My early impressions of the Thais were gathered from stopovers in Bangkok on the way to and from London in the 1950s. Later, on visits accompanying the Tunku in 1962–63, I was impressed by the quality of the men in charge of their foreign policy. The Thai foreign ministry recruited their brightest and best, educated in British, European and Latin American universities. It was their glamour service, highly paid and much respected because of their foreign travels at a time when travel was rare. Their domestic administrators did not match the quality of their foreign service officers. They needed their best to fend off encroachments by the British from Burma and by the French from Indochina. Thailand is the only Southeast Asian country that has never been colonised.</p>
<p>I met Prime Minister Field Marshal Thanom Kittikachorn in Bangkok in 1966. He was a staunch supporter of US intervention in Vietnam, but by January 1973 he told me that he believed a total US withdrawal from Indochina was inevitable in the long run. He wanted to see the region united by having the Indochinese countries – North and South Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia, and also Burma, brought into Asean, but only after a genuine ceasefire by North Vietnam.</p>
<p>Thanom was not a complex man. He was loyal to his friends and allies. He treated me as his friend and we exchanged views frankly and freely. He was worried because of the support Thailand had given the Americans, including the use of huge air bases from which the US Air Force had bombed North Vietnam – Vietnamese enmity and retribution were not to be lightly dismissed. He lamented the fact that the Americans were fighting with one hand tied behind their backs; they attacked North Vietnam only by air and fought a defensive war in South Vietnam, a no-win strategy. All they could hope for was not to lose. The Thais were adjusting to new realities.</p>
<p>In October that year large demonstrations in Bangkok demanding a more democratic constitution led to Thanom’s departure for the United States. He and his wife were thoroughly unhappy living in an apartment in Boston. They missed the warm tropics, their friends and relatives, and most of all their spicy Thai food.</p>
<p>In December 1974 Thanom flew back to Bangkok without notice. The Thai government wanted to send him back to the United States, but he refused to leave unless his ailing father accompanied him to a destination closer than America. I agreed at the Thai government’s request to let Thanom take up residence in Singapore, but made it a condition that he refrain from political activities during his stay. I thought it a plus if Singapore could become a neutral sanctuary like Switzerland in Europe.</p>
<p>When I had him, his wife, daughter and son-in-law, who had been with him in Boston, to dinner, he recounted the woes of being an exile in the unaccustomed cold of New England, the sense of isolation and neighbours who complained of the pungent smells of Thai curries. In Singapore he received an endless stream of relatives and friends and our lifestyle was not too alien. But the Thai government kept a watchful eye for possible politicking by his Thai visitors and him.</p>
<p>Thanom returned to Bangkok two years later in a monk’s robe, publicly declaring that he wanted to enter a monastery, and was welcomed by some members of the Thai royal family. Time had moved on, and Thanom never regained power, but he did persuade the Thai government to return a good part of his assets which had been frozen or confiscated. This was the Thai way, never a brutal, total confrontation if a compromise was possible. Forgiving is an essential part of Buddhism.</p>
<p>A general election had been held earlier, in 1975, when Kukrit Pramoj, a traditional monarchist, became prime minister. He headed a coalition in which his Social Action Party had only 18 of the 140 seats. Thailand needed him to deal with the impending North Vietnamese victory over the South. I found him shrewd and philosophical, with a keen if mischievous and malicious sense of humour. He could be frivolous. Articulate, with expressive hands and face, he did not strike me as a man with a serious political purpose. He had acted as the prime minister in the Hollywood production “The Quiet American”. A divorcé, he lived well in a large, attractive, old-style Thai teakwood house in central Bangkok, where he entertained me to dinner alfresco.</p>
<p>As a formulator of policy, Kukrit worried me. I visited him in Bangkok on 17 April 1975, a week after the Khmer Rouge captured Phnom Penh and two weeks before Saigon fell. He did not have much to say about Thailand’s position. Our ambassador, who had been brought up in Thailand and knew their leaders and their culture, thought they were still groping for a new foreign policy. I could not have visited them at a more tense moment. Kukrit said the US bases should go within a year. He was no longer sure of the United States, and their presence, being more of a “target” than a “deterrent”, compromised and embarrassed Thailand. I said we should not write off the United States. The US Congress would change its attitude as developments overtook them. Singapore’s view was that the presence of the US Seventh Fleet made our relations with China and the Soviet Union easier. Without it, the Russian influence would be overpowering. When the Soviets wanted Singapore to allow them to store oil for their fishing fleet on one of our outer islands, we had told them to buy from the American oil companies in Singapore. If there were no Seventh Fleet, we would not be able to give them such a reply.</p>
<p>Two weeks after Kukrit visited Beijing in early July, he came to Singapore. He had received a North Vietnamese delegation in Bangkok. He said that the “domino theory” had been realised in French Indochina, and that the North Vietnamese wanted to be the ruler of all Indochina. I asked why Radio Hanoi was so hostile towards Thailand when their government was extending the hand of friendship. Their tactics, Kukrit said, were to coerce and frighten the Thais into establishing diplomatic relations, and they wanted the world to see that Thailand was frightened. He described his meeting with the leader of the North Vietnamese delegation to Bangkok: he did not appear to be arrogant, said they should let “bygones be bygones” and embraced him warmly when they met. Kukrit said he “shivered in the embrace”. They were cold in their smiles and there was a distinct drop in temperature when the five of them sat in a room. The leader was relaxed but the rest merely sat stiffly. They pressed their claim for the return of South Vietnamese aircraft that had been flown from Vietnam to Thailand in the days before the fall of Saigon.</p>
<p>Kukrit’s view was that we (Asean) had to be strong and firm and play “big brother to the Indochinese countries”. We could help them, every now and then, in ways that would be sufficient to keep them just beyond the point of starvation. We had to show our affluence, strength and solidarity, and occasionally ask them to join in song and dance festivals. His view on the North Vietnamese had become more robust after meeting them in Bangkok, but, more important, after his visit to China. The Thais were quick and nimble when it came to protecting their sovereignty.</p>
<p>He related to me what Zhou Enlai told him about me: “I am surprised at him (referring to me). He is of my own blood. Why is he afraid of China taking over Singapore? His greater problem is to prevent the Chinese from returning to Singapore.” I asked Kukrit to tell Zhou that I had no worry about the Chinese returning to Singapore, or about the Chinese in Singapore wanting to return to China, or about China taking over Singapore. Singapore was too small for China and the problems it would create would not make it worthwhile. My concern was over the messages of congratulations China sent to the Malayan Communist Party and the Indonesian Communist Party on their anniversaries. These aroused great antipathy and animosity in Kuala Lumpur and Jakarta, and I did not want that animosity reflected towards me just because I had the same blood as Zhou Enlai. I asked rhetorically whether China could help Singapore if it clashed with Indonesia. Kukrit, in a mischievous moment, disclosed this to the Bangkok press.</p>
<p>Our relations with the Thais became closer after the Vietnamese attacked Cambodia in December 1978. General Kriangsak, the Thai prime minister then, had no experience in foreign affairs. His foreign minister, Dr Upadit Pachariyangkun, was an able man, highly intelligent and German-educated, but his experience did not extend to dealing with invading Vietnamese. It was a critical moment for them when the Vietnamese offered not to come within 20 kilometres of the Thai border if Thailand would stay neutral and not condemn Vietnam’s attack against Cambodia. I sent Kriangsak a letter through Rajaratnam, my foreign minister, urging him not to agree. If he did, and the Vietnamese subsequently breached their undertaking, he would have no standing internationally to attack Vietnam. It was better to warn the international community of the threat the Vietnamese posed to the rest of Southeast Asia now. I believe the Chinese must have assured him that they would stand by him if Thailand was attacked because Kriangsak took a stand, protested against the invasion, and gave sanctuary to the retreating Cambodian forces and tens of thousands of refugees.</p>
<p>Kriangsak was not as sharp-witted as Kukrit. He got into power because he was commander-in-chief of the Thai army. He was prone to worrying, especially over the fallout from the conflict in Cambodia. He had placed all his bets on the Chinese. When Deng Xiaoping visited Bangkok, Kuala Lumpur and Singapore in November 1978, before the Vietnamese attacked Cambodia, Kriangsak’s welcome was the warmest. As I told Deng in the car going to the airport after our talks in Singapore, Kriangsak had taken a stand and put himself way out in front, banking on China. If China allowed the Vietnamese a free hand in Cambodia, Kriangsak and Thailand would be in peril. Deng looked grim when I described the consequences that would follow if Thailand switched sides believing that the Soviet Union was going to prevail in Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>Kriangsak’s successor was General Prem Tinsulanonda. A bachelor, he was exceptionally honest and led a government largely free from corruption. During the eight years he was prime minister (1980–88), Thailand prospered and economic development took off, in spite of the war in Cambodia. He was a steady and reliable leader who held to a consistent policy, a man of few words, no scholar, but practical. He enjoyed the king’s trust. His command of English was not as good as Kukrit’s, but he had the better strategic sense. His neat dress and manners reflected his self-discipline and an abstemious, almost austere lifestyle. The personal chemistry between us was good. From time to time he would look closely and seriously at me to say, “I agree with you. You are a good friend of Thailand.”</p>
<p>His foreign minister, Siddhi Savetsila, was an air marshal with a master’s degree from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. (Their air force leaders were usually very well educated.) But Siddhi had more than brains. Able and firm, he had a strong character and constancy of purpose. He was of mixed Thai and European descent, fair-complexioned, with Eurasian features, but was accepted by the Thais as a loyal Thai. He knew the Vietnamese were wily, and he saw through every manoeuvre they made. Without Prem as prime minister and Siddhi as foreign minister, we would not have been able to cooperate so closely and successfully to tie the Vietnamese down in Cambodia. The two were a good team that secured Thailand’s long-term security and economic development. Without them, the Vietnamese could have succeeded in manipulating the Thai government.</p>
<p>When General Chatichai Choonhavan became prime minister in August 1988, he talked of turning Indochina from a battlefield into a marketplace. Siddhi remained as Chatichai’s foreign minister, but his position soon became untenable. Chatichai kept contradicting him publicly until Siddhi resigned. Because of Chatichai’s eagerness to get Thai businessmen into Vietnam’s reconstruction, the Vietnamese hung on in Cambodia and dragged out the Paris peace talks for another three years, to 1991.</p>
<p>Chatichai, when he was foreign minister in Kukrit’s government, once told me that when he visited his constituency in the rural northeast, he would drive up in a powerful, expensive Porsche. Asked why, he replied that if he went in an ordinary car, the farmers would not believe that he could help them. In a Porsche, they knew that he was a wealthy man with the means to help them. He did not explain what I had learnt from newspaper reports, that often the headman was paid to ensure that he delivered the votes of his villagers.</p>
<p>Chatichai was an engaging character. After some involvement in a coup in the 1960s, he had been sent to Argentina and later Switzerland, where he owned a villa. He spent years in Europe travelling in fast cars and enjoying life. When he was prime minister, his government was reputed to be the most corrupt in Thai history. Bribery was accepted in Thailand as the natural order of things. Only in the mid-1990s, with a growing educated middle class, was there disquiet at the rampant corruption. Vast sums of money were needed to get elected. Party leaders had to finance their supporting candidates, but after elections the leaders and MPs had to recover their expenses. This was money politics the Thai way. In Japan, construction contracts paid for election expenses. In Thailand, every contract must have its payoff otherwise there would be no funds for the next election.</p>
<p>On my next visit, in January 1998, in discussions Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai, his deputy prime minister and finance minister showed their understanding of the need to work with the IMF to restore confidence in Thailand. By 1999 they had improved Thailand’s standing with the IMF and international investors.</p>
<p>The Philippines was a world apart from us, running a different style of politics and government under an American military umbrella. It was not until January 1974 that I visited President Marcos in Manila. When my Singapore Airlines plane flew into Philippine airspace, a small squadron of Philippine Air Force jet fighters escorted it to Manila Airport. There Marcos received me in great style – the Filipino way. I was put up at the guest wing of Malacañang Palace in lavishly furnished rooms, valuable objects of art bought in Europe strewn all over. Our hosts were gracious, extravagant in hospitality, flamboyant. Over a thousand miles of water separated us. There was no friction and little trade. We played golf, talked about the future of Asean and promised to keep in touch.</p>
<p>His foreign minister, Carlos Romulo, was a small man of about five feet some 20 years my senior, with a ready wit and a self-deprecating manner about his size and other limitations. Romulo had a good sense of humour, an eloquent tongue and a sharp pen, and was an excellent dinner companion because he was a wonderful raconteur, with a vast repertoire of anecdotes and witticisms. He did not hide his great admiration for the Americans. One of his favourite stories was about his return to the Philippines with General MacArthur. As MacArthur waded ashore at Leyte the water reached his knees but came up to Romulo’s chest and he had to swim ashore. His good standing with Asean leaders and with Americans increased the prestige of the Marcos administration. Marcos had in Romulo a man of honour and integrity who helped give a gloss of respectability to his regime as it fell into disrepute in the 1980s.</p>
<p>In Bali in 1976, at the first Asean summit held after the fall of Saigon, I found Marcos keen to push for greater economic cooperation in Asean. But we could not go faster than the others. To set the pace, Marcos and I agreed to implement a bilateral Philippine-Singapore across-the-board 10 per cent reduction of existing tariffs on all products and to promote intra-Asean trade. We also agreed to lay a Philippines-Singapore submarine cable. I was to discover that for him, the communiqué was the accomplishment itself; its implementation was secondary, an extra to be discussed at another conference.</p>
<p>We met every two to three years. He once took me on a tour of his library at Malacañang, its shelves filled with bound volumes of newspapers reporting his activities over the years since he first stood for election. There were encyclopaedia-size volumes on the history and culture of the Philippines with his name as the author. His campaign medals as an anti-Japanese guerrilla leader were displayed in glass cupboards. He was the undisputed boss of all Filipinos. Imelda, his wife, had a penchant for luxury and opulence. When they visited Singapore before the Bali summit they came in style in two DC8s, his and hers.</p>
<p>Marcos did not consider China a threat for the immediate future, unlike Japan. He did not rule out the possibility of an aggressive Japan, if circumstances changed. He had memories of the horrors the Imperial Army had inflicted on Manila. We had strongly divergent views on the Vietnamese invasion and occupation of Cambodia. While he, pro forma, condemned the Vietnamese occupation, he did not consider it a danger to the Philippines. There was the South China Sea separating them and the American navy guaranteed their security. As a result, Marcos was not active on the Cambodian question. Moreover, he was to become preoccupied with the deteriorating security in his country.</p>
<p>Marcos, ruling under martial law, had detained opposition leader Benigno (Ninoy) Aquino, reputed to be as charismatic and powerful a campaigner as he was. He freed Aquino and allowed him to go to the United States. As the economic situation in the Philippines deteriorated, Aquino announced his decision to return. Mrs Marcos issued several veiled warnings. When the plane arrived at Manila Airport from Taipei in August 1983, he was shot as he descended from the aircraft. A whole posse of foreign correspondents with television camera crews accompanying him on the aircraft was not enough protection. International outrage over the killing resulted in foreign banks stopping all loans to the Philippines, which owed over US$25 billion and could not pay the interest due. This brought Marcos to the crunch. He sent his minister for trade and industry, Bobby Ongpin, to ask me for a loan of US$300–500 million to meet the interest payments. I looked him straight in the eye and said, “We will never see that money back.” Moreover, I added, everyone knew that Marcos was seriously ill and under constant medication for a wasting disease. What was needed was a strong, healthy leader, not more loans.</p>
<p>Shortly afterwards, in February 1984, Marcos met me in Brunei at the sultanate’s independence celebrations. He had undergone a dramatic physical change. Although less puffy than he had appeared on television, his complexion was dark as if he had been out in the sun. He was breathing hard as he spoke, his voice was soft, eyes bleary, and hair thinning. He looked most unhealthy. An ambulance with all the necessary equipment and a team of Filipino doctors were on standby outside his guest bungalow. Marcos spent much of the time giving me a most improbable story of how Aquino had been shot.</p>
<p>As soon as all our aides left, I went straight to the point, that no bank was going to lend him any money. They wanted to know who was going to succeed him if anything were to happen to him; all the bankers could see that he no longer looked healthy. Singapore banks had lent US$8 billion of the US$25 billion owing. The hard fact was they were not likely to get repayment for some 20 years. He countered that it would be only eight years. I said the bankers wanted to see a strong leader in the Philippines who could restore stability, and the Americans hoped the election in May would throw up someone who could be such a leader. I asked whom he would nominate for the election. He said Prime Minister Cesar Virata. I was blunt. Virata was a non-starter, a first-class administrator but no political leader; further, his most politically astute colleague, defence minister Juan Enrile, was out of favour. Marcos was silent, then he admitted that succession was the nub of the problem. If he could find a successor, there would be a solution. As I left, he said, “You are a true friend.” I did not understand him. It was a strange meeting.</p>
<p>With medical care, Marcos dragged on. Cesar Virata met me in Singapore in January the following year. He was completely guileless, a political innocent. He said that Mrs Imelda Marcos was likely to be nominated as the presidential candidate. I asked how that could be when there were other weighty candidates, including Juan Enrile and Blas Ople, the labour minister. Virata replied it had to do with “flow of money”; she would have more money than other candidates to pay for the votes needed for nomination by the party and to win the election. He added that if she were the candidate the opposition would put up Mrs Cory Aquino and work up the people’s feelings. He said the economy was going down with no political stability.</p>
<p>The denouement came in February 1986 when Marcos held presidential elections which he claimed he won. Cory Aquino, the opposition candidate, disputed this and launched a civil disobedience campaign. Defence Minister Juan Enrile defected and admitted election fraud had taken place, and the head of the Philippine constabulary, Lieutenant-General Fidel Ramos, joined him. A massive show of “people power” in the streets of Manila led to a spectacular overthrow of a dictatorship. The final indignity was on 25 February 1986 when Marcos and his wife fled in US Air Force helicopters from Malacañang Palace to Clark Air Base and were flown to Hawaii. This Hollywood-style melodrama could only have happened in the Philippines.</p>
<p>Mrs Aquino was sworn in as president amid jubilation. I had hopes that this honest, god-fearing woman would help regain confidence for the Philippines and get the country back on track. I visited her that June, three months after the event. She was a sincere, devout Catholic who wanted to do her best for her country by carrying out what she believed her husband would have done had he been alive, namely, restore democracy to the Philippines. Democracy would then solve their economic and social problems. At dinner, Mrs Aquino seated the chairman of the constitutional commission, Chief Justice Cecilia Munoz-Palma, next to me. I asked the learned lady what lessons her commission had learnt from the experience of the last 40 years since independence in 1946 would guide her in drafting the constitution. She answered without hesitation, “We will not have any reservations or limitations on our democracy. We must make sure that no dictator can ever emerge to subvert the constitution.” Was there no incompatibility of the American-type separation of powers with the culture and habits of the Filipino people that had caused problems for the presidents before Marcos? Apparently none.</p>
<p>Endless attempted coups added to Mrs Aquino’s problems. The army and the constabulary had been politicised. Before the Asean summit in December 1987, a coup was threatened. Without President Suharto’s firm support, the summit would have been postponed and confidence in Aquino’s government undermined. The Philippine government agreed that the responsibility for security should be shared between them and the other Asean governments, in particular the Indonesian government. General Benny Moerdani, President Suharto’s trusted aide, took charge. He positioned an Indonesian warship in the middle of Manila Bay with helicopters and a commando team ready to rescue the Asean heads of government if there should be a coup attempt during the summit. I was included in their rescue plans. I wondered if such a rescue could work but decided to go along with the arrangements, hoping that the show of force would scare off the coup leaders. We were all confined to the Philippine Plaza Hotel by the sea front facing Manila Bay where we could see the Indonesian warship at anchor. The hotel was completely sealed off and guarded. The summit went off without any mishap. We all hoped that this show of united support for Mrs Aquino’s government at a time when there were many attempts to destabilise it would calm the situation.</p>
<p>It made no difference. There were more coup attempts, discouraging investments badly needed to create jobs. This was a pity because they had so many able people, educated in the Philippines and the United States. Their workers were English-speaking, at least in Manila. There was no reason why the Philippines should not have been one of the more successful of the Asean countries. In the 1950s and ’60s it was the most developed, because America had been generous in rehabilitating the country after the war. Something was missing, a gel to hold society together. The people at the top, the elite mestizos, had the same detached attitude to the native peasants as the mestizos in their haciendas in Latin America had towards their peons. They were two different societies: those at the top lived a life of extreme luxury and comfort while the peasants scraped a living, and in the Philippines it was a hard living. They had no land but worked on sugar and coconut plantations. They had many children because the church discouraged birth control. The result was increasing poverty.</p>
<p>It was obvious that the Philippines would never take off unless there was substantial aid from the United States. George Shultz, the secretary of state, was sympathetic and wanted to help but made clear to me that the United States would be better able to do something if Asean showed support by making its contribution. The United States was reluctant to go it alone and adopt the Philippines as its special problem. Shultz wanted Asean to play a more prominent role to make it easier for the president to get the necessary votes in Congress. I persuaded Shultz to get the aid project off the ground in 1988, before President Reagan’s second term of office ended. He did; there were two meetings for a Multilateral Assistance Initiative (Philippines Assistance Programme): the first in Tokyo in 1989 brought US$3.5 billion in pledges, and the second in Hong Kong in 1991, under the Bush administration, yielded US$14 billion in pledges. But instability in the Philippines did not abate. This made donors hesitant and delayed the implementation of projects.</p>
<p>Mrs Aquino’s successor, Fidel Ramos, whom she had backed, was more practical and established greater stability. In November 1992 I visited him. In a speech to the 18th Philippine Business Conference, I said, “I do not believe democracy necessarily leads to development. I believe what a country needs to develop is discipline more than democracy.” In private, President Ramos said he agreed with me that British parliamentary-type constitutions worked better because the majority party in the legislature was also the government. Publicly Ramos had to differ.</p>
<p>He knew well the difficulties of trying to govern with strict American-style separation of powers. The senate had already defeated Mrs Aquino’s proposal to retain the American bases. The Philippines had a rambunctious press but it did not check corruption. Individual pressmen could be bought, as could many judges. Something had gone seriously wrong. Millions of Filipino men and women had to leave their country for jobs abroad beneath their level of education. Filipino professionals whom we recruited to work in Singapore are as good as our own. Indeed, their architects, artists and musicians are more artistic and creative than ours. Hundreds of thousands of them have left for Hawaii and for the American mainland. It is a problem the solution to which has not been made easier by the workings of a Philippine version of the American constitution.</p>
<p>The difference lies in the culture of the Filipino people. It is a soft, forgiving culture. Only in the Philippines could a leader like Ferdinand Marcos, who pillaged his country for over 20 years, still be considered for a national burial. Insignificant amounts of the loot have been recovered, yet his wife and children were allowed to return and engage in politics. They supported the winning presidential and congressional candidates with their considerable resources and reappeared in the political and social limelight after the 1998 election that returned President Joseph Estrada. General Fabian Ver, Marcos’s commander-in-chief who had been in charge of security when Aquino was assassinated, had fled the Philippines together with Marcos in 1986. When he died in Bangkok, the Estrada government gave the general military honours at his burial. One Filipino newspaper, <em>Today</em>, wrote on 22 November 1998, “Ver, Marcos and the rest of the official family plunged the country into two decades of lies, torture and plunder. Over the next decade, Marcos’s cronies and immediate family would tiptoe back into the country, one by one – always to the public’s revulsion and disgust, though they showed that there was nothing that hidden money and thick hides could not withstand.” Some Filipinos write and speak with passion. If they could get their elite to share their sentiments and act, what could they not have achieved?</p>
<p>Brunei was a placid, peaceful sultanate, wealthy with oil in the mid-1950s when I was practising law and appeared in their courts.</p>
<p>The sultan, Sir Omar Ali Saifuddien, invited me as prime minister, together with our head of state, Yusof Ishak, to his birthday celebrations in August 1960. He was a quiet man, soft-spoken, with a friendly, attractive smile. He had few friends, for nearly all invariably wanted to touch him for money. I met him several times in London when I was negotiating terms for Malaysia in 1962 and 1963. He was never comfortable at the prospect of becoming a member state of Malaysia. Most of his oil revenue would go to the federal government, and he was not confident that the special attention the Tunku was lavishing on him would last once he was in Malaysia: he would become just one of Malaysia’s many sultans. I gave him my reasons why Singapore wanted to join, but left him to make his own decision. He had legal advisers, but he made the political decision to stay out. In retrospect, it was a sound decision. The British stayed on from 1963 until February 1984 when they gave Brunei independence.</p>
<p>On one of his visits to Singapore after we separated from Malaysia, Sir Omar smiled broadly at me with his moustache twitching and his eyes twinkling, to say, “You are now like Brunei. It is better for you.” Indeed, we shared certain common interests: small countries surrounded by bigger neighbours. I did not covet his wealth, never borrowed money from him. I gave advice only when he asked for it. He trusted me.</p>
<p>In 1967, after Malaysia wound up the common currency board, its members, Malaysia, Brunei and Singapore, agreed that our new currencies would be interchangeable at par. When this arrangement was discontinued in 1973, the old sultan decided to retain the arrangements with the Singapore currency, interchangeability at par. He was a most frugal sultan, completely different from other sultans in the region. He gave Brunei a sense of financial discipline and began the accumulation of huge assets that were managed by crown agents in London.</p>
<p>When the British government pressed him to institute constitutional reforms for democracy, to delay and buy time he abdicated in 1967 in favour of his eldest son, Hassanal Bolkiah, then a young man training at Sandhurst. He spent a lot of time thinking of ways to keep the British in Brunei as his protector. He refused to have anything to do with Indonesia or Malaysia. He distrusted the Indonesians for supporting Azahari, the leader of the Brunei People’s Party who led a revolt in December 1962. He was wary of Malaysians because Malaysian officers seconded to work in Brunei in the late 1950s and early ’60s had patronised his Bruneian officers, treating them like country cousins. I was careful not to have any Singapore officer seconded for any length of time to Brunei, and when any was sent, made sure he was properly briefed to treat the Bruneians properly and courteously.</p>
<p>At a private meeting in March 1979 I urged Sir Omar, the former sultan, or Seri Begawan as he was called after he abdicated, to get half a foot into Asean before Brunei’s independence in 1984. I said President Suharto of Indonesia and Prime Minister Hussein Onn of Malaysia were both friendly and well disposed towards Brunei. He agreed to consider seeking observer status for Brunei in Asean, but nothing came of it. I explained to him how the world had changed. Sir Omar held on to his implicit faith in the British, that they would always be there to back him. He did not want to recognise Britain’s changed circumstances, that there were no British naval or air task forces to come to Brunei’s rescue.</p>
<p>Visiting British ministers frequently raised Brunei with me after Mrs Thatcher became prime minister. Her government wanted to end the protectorate by persuading the sultan to hold elections, become a more contemporary monarchy and be independent. I did my best to urge the Seri Begawan, Sir Omar, and the sultan to move forward but they were not persuaded. The British government finally concluded that regardless of whether or not Brunei had representative government, it would have to take responsibility for its own future. Britain would continue to give support against external threat by maintaining a Gurkha battalion for which Brunei would pay. I urged Peter Carrington in 1979, soon after he became foreign secretary, to be firm with British officers who wanted to extend their stay in Brunei. They were preventing Bruneian officials, almost all of whom had been educated in Britain, from getting the experience they needed to run their own country. There was a significant change of policy after that conversation. By 1984, when Brunei became independent, nearly all senior positions were held by indigenous Bruneians.</p>
<p>In 1980 I had raised with President Suharto the question of Brunei’s possible membership of Asean when it became independent. Suharto said he would welcome Brunei if it wanted to join. I then persuaded the sultan to look beyond his father’s view that Asean was unimportant; he should visit President Suharto and the other leaders of Asean. He finally did so in April 1981. Suharto received him warmly in Jakarta. The sultan then visited Malaysia and Thailand. When Brunei joined in 1984, Asean membership gave it an umbrella of sorts for its security and made it easier for the sultan to get along with his neighbours.</p>
<p>Brunei has enjoyed peace and stability since independence. The sultan has grown in self-confidence. Prince Mohamed has become a knowledgeable foreign minister and senior Bruneian officers have gained wide exposure at international conferences and grown in their jobs. The Seri Begawan, who died in 1986, would have been pleased with the results.</p>
<p>The friendship between the sultan’s father and me has continued between the present sultan, his brothers and ministers and Prime Minister Goh and his colleagues. It is a relationship of trust and utmost good faith.</p>
