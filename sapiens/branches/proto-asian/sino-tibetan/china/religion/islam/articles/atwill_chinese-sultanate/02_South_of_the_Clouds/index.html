Chinese imperial sources dating back more than two thousand years have consistently labeled this region Yunnan-literally, the land “south of the clouds.” According to traditional lore, the name “Yunnan” denoted the region’s position just south of the misty, humid, and often overcast Sichuan Basin. “South of the clouds” suited the image of the region held by outsiders; figuratively speaking, Yunnan was obscured by drifting clouds that allowed only enigmatic glimpses of a distant horizon.

  <p>CHAPTER 2 South of the Clouds: The World of Nineteenth-Century Yunnan Framed by the remote upper reaches of the Yangtze River to the north, by the lofty Himalayan peaks of Tibet to the west, and by the steamy highlands of Southeast Asia to the south, Yunnan Province marked the southwestern limit of Qing control in the mid-nineteenth century. Chinese imperial sources dating back more than two thousand years have consistently labeled this region Yunnan-literally, the land &ldquo;south of the clouds.&rdquo; According to traditional lore, the name &ldquo;Yunnan&rdquo; denoted the region&rsquo;s position just south of the misty, humid, and often overcast Sichuan Basin. &ldquo;South of the clouds&rdquo; suited the image of the region held by outsiders; figuratively speaking, Yunnan was obscured by drifting clouds that allowed only enigmatic glimpses of a distant horizon. Indeed, this region &ldquo;south of the clouds&rdquo; was dramatically different, both in its external realities and in people&rsquo;s minds.</p>
<p>The view of nineteenth-century Yunnan from the north-that of the Manchu imperial court in Beijing and of most of China&rsquo;s Qing subjects—was strongly influenced by the cultural, ethnic, and climatic differences between Yunnan and the rest of the empire. For Chinese outside the province, simply uttering the two characters-yun nan&ndash;immediately conjured up a multitude of fantastic images. Illustrated albums depicting menacing tribesmen wielding clubs and titillating &ldquo;courtship meetings&rdquo; between ethnically non-Chinese couples circulated widely among the Chinese. Epic stories such as the Three Kingdoms-repeated for centuries and familiar to most Chinese-reinforced the notion that Yunnan was a distant place inhabited by &ldquo;savages.&ldquo;1 Yunnan was notorious for other reasons. Widely circulated travelers&rsquo; tales reported mysterious blue, green, and red zhangqi (poisonous clouds), which caused bleeding from one&rsquo;s ears, nose, eyes, and mouth. And then there were stories of seasonal shuyi (rat epidemics), which were always preceded by the appearance of dead rats. An infected person could wake up healthy and be dead before nightfall.2 These two diseases are now known as malaria and bubonic plague; both continue to afflict Yunnanese.

This last detail sealed the province&rsquo;s sinister reputation throughout the Chinese heartlands.</p>
<p>The view from the south-from the lowland kingdoms of Ava (Burma), Siam (Thailand), and Vietnam—although less vivid than the one from China, was equally otherworldly. Malarial valleys and the fierce reputation of the multiethnic peoples of the mountainous Shan States acted as a potent barrier between lowland Southeast Asians and Yunnanese. The lowland kingdoms gleaned most of their knowledge of Yunnan from the thriving caravan trade-a trade that provided highly desirable goods such as silk, tea, and medicines. The overland route also offered a means for Southeast Asia to market its cotton and salt as well as (by the nineteenth century) a growing array of British manufactured goods.3 Dealings between Yunnan and Southeast Asia were conducted mainly through the ethnic groups inhabiting the borderlands between the two. Several of these groups established semiautonomous states (such as Lanna and the larger Shan States); others (such as the Kachin, Dai, and Miao) were more loosely associated. These groups controlled the region&rsquo;s commercial and mineral resources. Intimate, and often illicit, political alliances and trade networks bound Yunnan to Southeast Asia. Though quite conspicuous at the local level, the interregional links were often beyond the administraThe World of Nineteenth-Century Yunnan 13 tive reach of both the lowland Southeast Asian political centers and the Qing court in faraway Beijing.4 Relations between Yunnan and Tibet to the northwest were heavily dependent upon the strong ethnic affinities that facilitated the commercial dealings with the eastern Tibetan state of Kham. Every year, attracted by Yunnan&rsquo;s salt wells and famous tea and by its many commercial fairs, Tibetan traders plied the long-distance trade routes that stretched deep into Yunnan-even as far as Xishuangbanna, to which &ldquo;several thousand Tibetan traders annually&rdquo; traveled to purchase tea.5 Official Chinese sources often overlooked or simply ignored the fact that Yunnan played a prominent role in Tibetan Buddhist traditions because of its many pilgrimage sites. Every year, sacred Buddhist mountains in western Yunnan attracted countless Tibetan Buddhists.6 In the late nineteenth century, one European observer remarked that the Tibetans&rsquo; &ldquo;first visit is to Jizu Mountain situated a day&rsquo;s march northeast of Dali, where some celebrated Buddhist temples are situated. From thence they visit Weibaoshan, near Menghua, where the Taoist temples are, and they pass through Dali again on their return. There are seen here often amongst them many Fakirs-called Llamas by the Yunnanese as well as Tibetans-with their pointed caps, praying machine and double-faced drum.&ldquo;7 Yunnan&rsquo;s relations with eastern Tibet were similar to those it had with Southeast Asia. The distant political centers were only dimly aware how the religious and commercial networks seamlessly linked the two regions to each other.</p>
<p>At the intersection of China, Tibet, and Southeast Asia, Yunnanese society reflected overlapping ethnicities, polities, and cultures. Yunnan&rsquo;s multiple and often illicit commercial, ethnic, and political connections evaded official Qing channels and called into question traditional representations that placed the imperial court at the center of all of China&rsquo;s interactions with neighboring political centers. This court-centered perspective—which by the nineteenth century was also an outmoded one-disregarded the multilateral and transnational nature of the Yunnan world, a world that heeded the Qing presence but often circumvented its centralized bureaucracy.</p>
<p>A closer approximation of this local reality might be Stanley Tambiah&rsquo;s conception of a &ldquo;galactic polity.&rdquo; As he conceived it, this model emphasizes distant centers that exert a &ldquo;gravitational pull&rdquo; on a variety of regional peoples, communities, and polities. Tambiah&rsquo;s model offers a more nuanced alternative to the traditional center/periphery perspective of the sort the Qing court employed to support its notion of hierarchical tributary relations. By emphasizing the multiple ties of border communities, Tambiah&rsquo;s notion of &ldquo;galactic polities&rdquo; substitutes the Qing court&rsquo;s static notion of a steady and perpetual imperial presence with a concept that reflects more 14 THE WORLD OF NINETEENTH-CENTURY YUNNAN closely the fluctuating attractions between nominal tributary states and the various political centers. His model inserts the prevailing autonomy of peoples and territories into our schema of frontier societies; however, it does little to acknowledge the perspective from the periphery and from those who live there.</p>
<p>Tambiah is not alone in failing to acknowledge this perspective. Most conceptual approaches that attempt to factor in the roles played by the &ldquo;borderlands&rdquo; in early modern China and lowland Southeast Asia have adopted externalist frameworks (such as galactic polity, concentric circles, or zones of authority) that consider these borderlands only in relation to their centers. In doing so, they adopt a bipolar perspective that disregards the pervasive notions of centrality exhibited by the peoples of Yunnan. At the same time, they minimize both the multiplicity and the significance of the commercial, political, and cultural projects present in the Yunnan world. These projects, although they interacted with multiple polities, did not &ldquo;orbit&rdquo; any single state exclusively; more often, the Yunnanese juggled their relations with multiple dominant albeit distant powers.9 Only after we adopt a regionally informed perspective can we begin to discern that the primary concerns of Yunnan were not inextricably linked to the interests of the distant imperial center; rather, they were balanced with matters of regional and local significance. Once we take this paththat is, once we step outside the dualistic framework—we can begin to understand the actions of the Yunnanese. These people were not simply for or against the Chinese state; they were not simply functioning inside or outside state-proscribed channels of interaction. Rather, their actions were often motivated and shaped by local contingencies. Having decentered our perspective in this way, we can begin to enter the hazy world south of the clouds, the world of nineteenth-century Yunnan.</p>
<p>Yunnanese Landscapes Chinese tourist brochures today promote Yunnan&rsquo;s southern location and reputation for mild weather by quoting the first line of a poem that describes the province as a paradise where siji ruchun (&ldquo;the four seasons are all like spring&rdquo;). In many ways, this reputation is justified. With its average elevation of six thousand feet, Yunnan suffers neither the punishing winters of northern China nor the sweltering summers of the southeast. Yunnan&rsquo;s mile-high elevation alters the climate in other, unanticipated ways, as is apparent in the (rarely mentioned) remaining three lines of the poem: When the sun shines, it is like summer; With the slightest shadow, it is like autumn; As soon as it rains, it is like winter. 10 The World of Nineteenth-Century Yunnan 15 When read in its entirety, the poem offers a hazy, rather ambiguous portrayal of Yunnan and hints at the complexities of its physical landscape.</p>
<p>REGIONAL LANDSCAPES Topographically, Yunnan resembles a swath of rippled silk pinned to the eastern end of the Tibetan Plateau; it cascades precipitously down to the tropical lowlands of the south and less dramatically to the Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau in the east. The land is rugged, serrated, and unforgiving. Its towering mountain ranges are divided by temperate valleys and scored by deep gorges.11 Yunnan&rsquo;s topography profoundly influenced its people&rsquo;s conceptions of their land. Indeed, the major topographical variations resulted in the province being rendered by most Yunnanese as being composed of three regions: western, southern, and eastern.</p>
<p>Western Yunnan, bordered by Tibet to the north and Burma to the south, is characterized by deep river gorges and lofty mountain ridges. In this region four of Asia&rsquo;s greatest rivers-the Dulong jiang (Irrawaddy), Nu jiang (Salween), Lancang jiang (Mekong), and Jinsha jiang (Yangtze)-flow within sixty miles of one another. Yet they never converge, nor are they navigable until well beyond Yunnan&rsquo;s borders. In addition to this ruggedness, western Yunnan has abundant forests and many fertile valleys with rich soil and plentiful rainfall. Western Yunnan was not as isolated as many borderlands in central China. In its northern and southern corners, two of the province&rsquo;s most prosperous cities, Lijiang and Baoshan, benefited enormously from their proximity to Tibet and Burma, respectively. The main trade routes from these two cities to the center of Yunnan converged in Dali, the administrative capital and trading emporium for the region.</p>
<p>Eastern Yunnan is dominated by the massive Yunnan Plateau; however, it can hardly be called flat. One nineteenth-century traveler described the plateau as &ldquo;everywhere broken by hills and cut through by rivers, and in some parts even traversed by mountain ranges.&ldquo;12 The provincial capital, Kunming, is in the middle of this region, on a fertile plain beside Dianchi, Yunnan&rsquo;s largest lake. In the nineteenth century, Dongchuan northeast of the capital was the hub of the copper-mining industry; Zhaotong served as the gateway to Sichuan and the Yangtze River. Today, roads and rail lines in eastern Yunnan snake back and forth over the defiant topography; journeys of one hundred miles as the crow flies are epic day-long journeys.</p>
<p>In great contrast, southern Yunnan is mostly tropical and subtropical lowlands. This region lies entirely south of the Tropic of Cancer. It resembles eastern Yunnan except that the pine forests give way to palm trees and rain forests. Because it drops steadily in elevation, southern Yunnan serves as a natural causeway linking the province commercially to the highlands 16 THE WORLD OF NINETEENTH-CENTURY YUNNAN of Southeast Asia. In the nineteenth century, Lin&rsquo;an, the region&rsquo;s prosperous administrative center, gained prominence as Yunnan&rsquo;s intellectual center. Far to the south, in the tea-growing districts, the market town of Pu&rsquo;er profited from the demand for tea and from its proximity to the trade routes to Burma and Thailand.</p>
<p>By the nineteenth century the three regions were highly distinct entities, to the point that the people viewed their province largely as the sum of its three parts. When the Qing gained control of Yunnan in the late seventeenth century, the triadic administrative structure they implemented mirrored the local realities of the area. In addition, the Qing grouped together the prefectures and counties in each of the three regions and appointed a military commander for each. The new administrative divisions reinforced the physical, ethnic, and cultural realities that affected all aspects of Yunnanese life. By the eighteenth century, the term sanyi (three regions) was used as a shorthand term for the province as a whole among Qing officials and local residents alike.</p>
<p>COMMERCIAL LANDSCAPES Yunnan&rsquo;s imposing terrain decisively shaped its commercial networks. These networks connected the province&rsquo;s three regions with one another and with neighboring polities. That Yunnan&rsquo;s topography had a strong impact is seen in the fact that distances were measured not by standard units of length but rather by the number of stages (or days) it took to travel from one point to the next. And even this system was contingent on the direction and gradient of the road the traveler was taking.</p>
<p>Outsiders such as Edward Baber, a nineteenth-century British civil servant sent to Yunnan from Burma to explore trading opportunities, often declared themselves bewildered by the local system for measuring distances between towns. Inevitably, residents of the town where Baber began his day&rsquo;s journey offered estimates of the distance to his destination that differed from those given by the inhabitants of his destination at day&rsquo;s end. Only after he realized that the distances he was being told were calculated according to the difficulty of grade-thus making the journey from a mountaintop village to the valley bottom shorter than the reverse-did he finally arrive at the following scale of conversion: &ldquo;The scale of distance is something like this: On level ground I statute mile is called 2 li [Chinese mile] On ordinary hill-roads, not very steep, I mile is called 5 li On very steep roads, 1 mile is called 15 li.&ldquo;13 But the impact of Yunnan&rsquo;s ridges and valleys on travel went far beyond making one mile seem like five. What one observer bemoaned as Yunnan&rsquo;sThe World of Nineteenth-Century Yunnan 17 &ldquo;everlasting hills&rdquo; indelibly colored the patterns of Yunnan society, culture, and commerce.14 At the best of times, to traverse the province from southwest to northeast, from the Burmese border town of Bhamô through Kunming to the Yangtze town of Suifu, required at least sixty-six days. A journey from Pu&rsquo;er in southern Yunnan to Deqin on the Tibetan borderlands required at least sixty-three days. 15 Historical records for Yunnan make very clear the impact the topography had on the movement of goods and people. To begin with, Yunnan&rsquo;s steep roads precluded wheeled traffic outside the large towns and valley bottoms. At every steep ascent the roads gave way to carved stone steps. In some places these steps were too steep even for mules, which meant that human porters were required to transport goods. 16 Yunnan&rsquo;s many rivers offered no relief from all this since they flowed swiftly through deep gorges and rarely linked population centers of any size.</p>
<p>Another deterrent to trade was the dilapidated condition of the roads. Their state of disrepair validated emphatically the Chinese proverb that “a road is good for ten years and bad for ten thousand.&rdquo; Alexander Hosie, who traveled throughout Yunnan in the 1880s, offered a humorous account of this: To say that the road was best where there was no road may seem paradoxical. It is nevertheless true, for where the paving had disappeared, fine battened sand or clay gave an excellent foothold except when it rained. In many places paved mounds rose in the middle of the roadway and these were carefully avoided by man and beast. Not infrequently, too, so distorted was the paving that it had every appearance of having been convulsed by an earthquake.17 Away from the main trunk roads, traffic snailed along routes that were little more than footpaths. These often skirted plunging cliffs where a single misstep would mean certain death. Well into the twentieth century, bridges consisting of nothing more than two frayed ropes strung hundreds of feet in the air were often the only means of crossing Yunnan&rsquo;s deep river gorges.</p>
<p>18 However poor their quality, these routes were crucial economic conduits, and they carried considerable traffic between the commercial centers and the smaller towns and markets. Unfortunately, few accounts survive from Yunnanese caravaneers and porters. We do have the account of Augustus Margary, who traveled by sedan chair along Yunnan&rsquo;s main road from Kunming to Dali in 1875, and who captured the daily hazards of Yunnan&rsquo;s heavily trafficked roads: It is far from being an easy task to describe the incredible obstacles which are suffered to remain unheeded on this track. . . . It is full of steep passes, the chief of which rises 3,500 feet, and the track by which it is surmounted is simply a chaos of deep ruts and broken stones, offering the acme of dangerous footing to animals 18 THE WORLD OF NINETEENTH-CENTURY YUNNAN as well as carriers. Chair-bearers have to be supplemented by six or eight coolies dragging a rope passed round the chair, and even with this aid it is difficult to conceive how they retain their footing at the rate they press up the incline. . . . In many places the steep path has a horizontal slope as well, and to complicate the danger, pack animals passing both ways have to be avoided. 19 Several months after writing these words, Margary encountered another common hazard of travel in Yunnan: his caravan was attacked by bandits. The young envoy was murdered, which led to one of the most infamous diplomatic incidents of the late nineteenth century, the Margary Affair.20 With the roads too steep and badly maintained for wheeled traffic and the rivers unnavigable for any distance, commodities had to be transported by mule caravans.21 A typical Yunnanese long-distance caravan had between twenty and one hundred animals; some of the larger ones had more than five hundred. The province&rsquo;s muleteers were organized into formal and informal guilds (as was typical for most professions in nineteenth-century China). These guilds, like most organizations in Yunnan society, were divided internally along lines of ethnicity and place of origin.22 The Yunnan caravans were colorful affairs. Foreign travelers almost always noted the elaborate decorations of the Tibetan and Muslim Yunnanese caravans. As Edward Colborne Baber observed in the 1870s: &ldquo;The head of the leading mule was completely hidden in an elaborate ornament of coloured wool and silver buttons, and plumed with a panace of the tail feathers of the Amherst pheasant. All the succeeding animals some twenty in number, bore aigrettes of the same description. &ldquo;23 These decorations reflected the wealth to be gained from being a muleteer. Clearly, caravans played a crucial economic role in Yunnan. In a province where a livelihood was difficult to earn, caravaning provided one of the best ways available for Yunnanese to scratch out a living.</p>
<p>Shared commercial objectives, widespread reliance on caravans, and the exigencies of Yunnan&rsquo;s rugged topography promoted a sense of &ldquo;Yunnaneseness&rdquo; among the province&rsquo;s long-time residents. When a European inquired about their identity, a resident of Kunming told him: &ldquo;We are not Chinese, we are Yunnanese.&ldquo;24 The transnational orientation of most long-time Yunnanese did much to forge this identity: the province looked toward Tibet and Southeast Asia. This was evident as early as the seventeenth century, when a Yunnan gazetteer highlighted: Yuanjiang, Lin&rsquo;an, are the gateways for the non-Chinese peoples of Thailand, Laos, Viet Nam.</p>
<p>Tengyue, Yongchang, and Shunning are the key avenues for the non-Chinese peoples of Burma.</p>
<p>Lijiang, Yongning, and Beisheng are the strategic outposts for Tibet.25 Tibet Bhamo The World of Nineteenth-Century Yunnan Burma N Lijiang Dali Baoshan Tengyue Kilometers Primary Trade Route Secondary Route 200 MAP 2.2. Yunnan Trade Routes Sichuan Zhaotong 19 Guizhou Kunming Qujing Chuxiong Lin&rsquo;an Pu&rsquo;er Vietnam Yunnan&rsquo;s transnational orientation was more than a matter of geography. There were diverse other factors, from trade to ethnic familiarity. A map of Yunnan&rsquo;s primary trade routes might suggest that Kunming, the capital, was the province&rsquo;s economic hub and principal entrepôt (see Figure 2.2). In fact, quite the opposite was true. Because it was so expensive to transport goods across Yunnan, most commodities were imported from neighboring polities. In this sense, Kunming was the &ldquo;end of the line&rdquo; for most products.</p>
<p>The shipping of goods by caravan across Yunnan was governed by the high-profit/low-bulk principle. In other words, the less bulky the item, the higher the profit obtained. In the equally mountainous neighboring province of Guizhou typically &ldquo;two days transport was all most agricultural goods could pay.&ldquo;26 This was likely true for Yunnan as well. In the nineteenth century only Yunnan tea and opium could consistently overcome the substantial markup in price and thereby pay well enough to make shipment outside the region worthwhile. In the nineteenth century the Qing court still looked to Yunnan&rsquo;s mines as its principal source of copper (and to a lesser extent silver and tin), but this was only possible because the price of copper had been pegged artificially low and because the overland transportation of that metal to Beijing was heavily subsidized.27 20 THE WORLD OF NINETEENTH-CENTURY YUNNAN The commercial barriers Yunnan faced because of its topography compelled each of the three regions to import needed goods from the closest adjacent lowland regions, be they Chinese or not. One nineteenth-century observer outlined Yunnan&rsquo;s transnational trade in cotton and tobacco, showing how each region in the province reached outward for the cheapest and closest sources: &ldquo;Thus, to take two examples, cotton and tobacco, both absolute necessities to Chinese existence, which the [Yunnan] plateau does not produce: cotton is supplied to North Yunnan from Sichuan, to West Yunnan as far east as Kunming from Burma, to Southwest Yunnan as far east as Mengzi from the Shan States and Siam, to Southeast Yunnan from Canton, and to Guizhou from Hankou by the Yuan River.&ldquo;28 Only by yielding to topographical realities (and often ethnic ones as well) could Yunnan function. By the nineteenth century, Yunnan had developed extensive commercial ties with its non-Chinese neighbors and was trading with them for goods that would have been far too expensive for most Yunnanese if they had come from China.</p>
<p>In the first years of the nineteenth century, Yunnan&rsquo;s trade routes were dominated by imported cotton and exported tea. The top-grade tea was Pu&rsquo;er, which was grown in the Xishuangbanna region in southernmost Yunnan. It was in demand throughout China and in many parts of Southeast Asia. Also grown in this region was the lower-grade guzong tea, which was exported to Tibet. This tea was &ldquo;fermented and transported by backpack and packhorse to Tibet or markets bordering Tibet&rdquo;; after that it was repacked and transferred to pack animals for sale throughout Tibet.29 Finally, an enduring demand in Southeast Asia and Tibet for porcelain, tobacco, silk, and a variety of Chinese medicines ensured that these goods made up a fair portion of Yunnan&rsquo;s cross-border trade.30 Often overshadowed by the cotton and tea trade was the flourishing &ldquo;short haul&rdquo; trade in salt, gems, and other sundries, which was carried out with non-Chinese peoples and polities clustered along the trade routes. This often illicit trade heavily influenced the profitability of the caravans as well as the routes they took.31 Salt was an alternative currency and was &ldquo;exchanged everywhere for grain [and] horses &hellip; in western [Yunnan] for musk and medicine, and in the east for tea.&ldquo;32 In theory, salt was taxed within Yunnan at one of the fifty-six authorized salt wells where it was produced, &ldquo;after which salt became a free-trade commodity within the region.&ldquo;33 In reality, the salt trade was a far more fluid venture.</p>
<p>Along Yunnan&rsquo;s porous borders, and even in the interior, there were many unmonitored salt wells.34 The strong demand for salt and the state&rsquo;s control of Yunnanese salt production generated a highly profitable &ldquo;illicit&rdquo; trade that revolved around sources the state did not control. This problem was exacerbated by the fact that in western and southern Yunnan the caraThe World of Nineteenth-Century Yunnan 21 van trade often imported sea salt from Burma and rock salt from the Tibetan borderlands.35 Because salt was taxed at the site of production and not at the time of sale, the state faced a heavy burden of enforcement.36 As with cotton and tobacco, each of Yunnan&rsquo;s regions gravitated toward the cheapest sources of salt. This created strong ties between regions that derived their salt from a common source. Consider as an example those areas of Yunnan that imported their salt from Sichuan. Sichuan produced salt by pumping brine from deep wells and then evaporating it; the resulting product was dingy black in color. Yunnanese salt was produced the same way but contained fewer mineral impurities, so it was whiter in color.37 In between these two spheres was the urban center of Dongchuan. Markets north of Dongchuan sold the black salt of Sichuan; south of Dongchuan only the white salt of Yunnan was consumed. 38 Similarly, there were occasional reports that the sea salt being sold in Burmese border towns was also for sale in western Yunnan.</p>
<p>Because these salt wells were widely scattered and because many of them were in &ldquo;peripheral&rdquo; and ethnically non-Han Chinese regions, many caravaneers supplemented their profits by trading salt along their routes. It is perhaps not surprising, then, that one Qing official declared that &ldquo;of all the sources of mischief in Yunnan, there is none that surpasses salt.&ldquo;39 Throughout the nineteenth century, officials posted to Yunnan complained that wells &ldquo;which were located in indigenous areas along the border [yijiang] were difficult for soldiers and officials to patrol.&ldquo;40 It is clear that the salt trade, with its state-imposed proscriptions, oriented many parts of Yunnan away from China and further entwined them both economically and socially with neighboring polities.41 Not all transnational trade was conducted outside provincial borders. Yunnan was the site of many trade fairs. The largest and most famous of these was Dali&rsquo;s Third Month Fair (sanyue jie), which attracted traders from as far away as Tibet, Burma, Thailand, and a number of distant Chinese provinces. The British traveler Arthur Davenport remarked on the cosmopolitan flair of the fair when he passed through Dali a few years after the end of the Panthay Rebellion: &ldquo;We were fortunate to arrive while the famous yearly fair was going on which years ago was attended by Lamas from Tibet, aborigines from Weixi, Burmese, Cochin-Chinese, and, in short, people from all the adjacent countries, and from eleven out of eighteen of the Chinese provinces.&ldquo;42 Lesser fairs-such as the Horse Bazaar (luoma hui), held in Lijiang on the Yunnan-Tibet border-and other smaller annual markets in the south were largely commercial in nature. However, they were timed to coincide with local indigenous festivals.43 The Qing tried to regulate the commercial dimensions of these fairs; however, the deeply embedded multiethnic and 22 THE WORLD OF NINETEENTH-CENTURY YUNNAN transnational orientation of the province made such gatherings rich junctures of ideas, cultures, and religions. For this reason, they largely escaped the court&rsquo;s understanding and control.</p>
<p>From the perspective of the imperial court, Yunnan&rsquo;s greatest asset was its mineral reserves-principally copper. In the early eighteenth century, after Japan sharply reduced copper exports to China, Yunnan quickly became the central government&rsquo;s single most important source of copper for the metropolitan mints in Beijing.44 Yunnan&rsquo;s annual quota of 4,106,880 catties of copper (almost 10,000 tons), which was set by the Board of Revenue, remained constant throughout the latter eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, although yields from the thirty-nine officially sanctioned mines were falling steadily throughout those decades.45 By the early nineteenth century, Yunnan was beginning to exhaust its richest and most accessible veins. Officials frequently reported that the &ldquo;mines are old and the deposits depleted&rdquo; (donglao shanhuang) and that the quality of the copper was declining. Moreover, because the imperial court had pegged the price of copper artificially low, there was little motivation to seek out new sources. Significantly, the largest of Yunnan&rsquo;s imperially designated mines lay in eastern Yunnan. This strengthened that region&rsquo;s already close ties with Sichuan and imperial China. So did the fact that the mines drew considerable numbers of Han miners from other parts of the empire. Yunnan&rsquo;s mines were a microcosm of broader Yunnan society, in that the miners tended to be divided into groups based on either ethnicity or (if Han) province of origin.47 Among the miners of Yunnan there were three principal groups: Muslim Yunnanese (Hui), Han Chinese from Lin&rsquo;an, and Han Chinese from Hunan.48 The approach to administering these mines was a hybrid of the baojia registration system, which had three primary elements: registering the resident miners, ensuring that the requisite taxes were collected, and establishing a hierarchy to facilitate production while maintaining order.49 Each work team had a boss who reported directly to the mine supervisor (kuangguan).50 Perhaps these teams fostered cohesion among their own miners, but they did little to promote an understanding among the migrant Han Chinese of the highly charged ethnic environment of Yunnan. The teams competed constantly for the richest veins, the highest ore prices, and better working conditions, and their bosses often played on ethnic rivalries to spur their miners to work harder and longer.51 The above description highlights the fact that ethnicity was an inescapable dimension of Yunnanese society. It could be argued that for any venture to succeed in Yunnan-be it commercial, political, or even religious-it had to accommodate Yunnan&rsquo;s complex ethnic mosaic.</p>
<p>The World of Nineteenth-Century Yunnan 23 ETHNIC MOSAIC In the nineteenth century, Yunnan was the most ethnically diverse area in all of China. 52 This is still the case today. &ldquo;We ordinarily count Yunnan among the provinces of the Chinese empire,&rdquo; noted a French missionary living in Yunnan, “but if one leaves the main lines of communication, entering the interior, traveling through the deserts and mountains, you are always in the territory of Yunnan, but you are no longer in China; you are in an uncivilized country [pays sauvage] without roads, without inns, surrounded by thieves who want your purse or your life, and sometimes both.&ldquo;53 The contrasting worlds within Yunnan were not perceived as a simple, bipolar division of Han and non-Han (as was typical in Tibet and Xinjiang and in China&rsquo;s other border regions), for Yunnan was home to an astonishing mix of ethnic groups, especially from the perspective of the in-migrating Han Chinese.</p>
<p>The province today is home to twenty-six of China&rsquo;s fifty-six officially recognized nationalities; but a late-Qing gazetteer listed more than 140 different ethnic groups. These ranged from the &ldquo;Kawa&rdquo; (Wa) headhunters of southwestern Yunnan to the highly assimilated Bai around Erhai Lake to the powerful Lolo (Yi) tribes of northern Yunnan, who often swooped down on isolated Han settlements to capture slaves. Nineteenth-century Yunnan was a mosaic of ethnic groups. The non-Chinese population of southwestern China had been a topic of interest for the Chinese for several millennia, at least since the Warring States Period (403-221 BCE). Figure 2.3 suggests that the Chinese of central China were becoming more familiar with these groups. Over time and ever more selectively, the original and broadly applied ethnonyms were beginning to delineate the ethnic divisions of southwest China. This figure accurately reflects the genealogy of the ethnic labels employed by the Chinese but does not indicate how the ethnic groups perceived themselves.</p>
<p>In the nineteenth century, Qing officials and recent Han immigrants did not always grasp the finer distinctions between the different ethnic groups, but they were probably aware of the general divisions between diverse peoples such as the Miao, the Yi, and the Dai, who populated large areas of Yunnan. Despite this awareness, Chinese documents routinely reduced the population to three categories: Yi, Hui, and Han. In doing so, the Qing was following its tendency to impose an &ldquo;us-them&rdquo; framework on the region, just as they did elsewhere in the empire.</p>
<p>One consequence of this reductionistic approach was that all of Yunnan&rsquo;s diverse ethnic populations were lumped into a single category. From the perspective of the Qing, the non-Han category made it easier to maintain a Chinese Dynasty Warring States Period Di Qiang (氐羌 ) Baiyue (百越 ) Baipu (百濮 ) Qin/Han Dynasties Bo (僰 ) Kunming Sou Mosha Bailang Pu Liao Jiuliao Minpu Baoman * (昆明) (叟) (摩沙) (白狼) (僕) (獠) (鳩獠) (閩濮) (苞滿) Wei/Sui Dynasties Cuanbo (爨僰) Wuman (烏蠻) Mosuo Xibo Liaojiuliao Minpu (磨些) (西番) (獠鳩獠) (閩濮) Tang/Song Dynasties Baiman (白蠻) Wuman Heman Shiman Xunfuman Luoxingman Guocuoman Mosuo (烏蠻)(和蠻)(施蠻)(尋傅蠻) (裸形蠻) (鍋錯蠻) (磨些) Dongman (東蠻) Liao Jinchi(金齒) (獠) Mangman(茫蠻) Baiyi(白衣) Miao Wangman Puziman (苗) (望蠻) (朴子蠻) Yuan Dynasty Bai Wuman Woman Luman Achang Yeren Qiao Mosuo Xifan (白) (烏蠻)(斡蠻) (廬蠻) (阿昌) (野人) (橇) (磨些) (西) (吐蕃) Tufan Nongren Jinchi|| Huihui (儂人)(金齒) (回回) Miao Mongol Puman (苗) (蒙古) (蒲蠻) Sharen (沙人) Tuliao (土獠) Bai Luoluo Woni Lisuo Echang Yeren Qiu Mosuo Nu Xifan Guzong Nongren Baiyi Hui Ming Dynasty (白) (玀玀) (窩泥) (些) (娥昌)(野人) (俅) (磨些)(怒)(西)(古宗) (佰夷) (回) (儂人) Miao (苗) Hawa Mongol (哈瓦)(蒙古) Puren (蒲人) Sharen (沙人) Tuliao (土獠) Qing Dynasty Bai (白) Luoluo Woni Lisu Achang Yeren (玀玀) (窩泥)(粟粟)(阿昌) (野人) Luohei Zhesuol (遮些) Qiu Mosuo Nu Xifan Guzong Zhongjia Nongren Baiyi Hui Miao Kawa Mongol (倮黑) (俅) (磨些) (怒)(西蕃)(古宗)(仲家)(農人)(擺夷)(回) Sharen (沙人) Puren (苗) (卡瓦) (蒙古) (蒲人) Yao (瑤) Bai P.R.

<p>The World of Nineteenth-Century Yunnan 25 system largely based on a blinkered dualism, one that placed the imperial court at the center. But that category also perpetuated a model of statecraft predicated on dealing with only one ethnic group at a time in isolation from its multiethnic context. This, in an province that was profoundly fluid and multifaceted.</p>
<p>Yunnan&rsquo;s ethnic diversity defied this simplistic &ldquo;us-them” binary. To begin with, there were large numbers of Hui, who fit in neither the Yi nor the Han category; for another, the other non-Han groups were often completely unrelated ethnically, linguistically, and culturally. The Qing would pay heavily for the stance it took. This misrepresentation of Yunnan society&rsquo;s complex interethnic realities encouraged the Qing court to overlook a multitude of significant commercial, cultural, and even political contacts between ethnic groups. These contacts not only circumvented the Qing administrative framework but also, often, entirely excluded contact with Han Chinese.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the imposition of this triadic division strengthened the assumption that Chinese culture was superior to non-Chinese culture. The term yi, often translated as &ldquo;barbarian&rdquo; in English, is the same character the Qing court employed when referring to the increasing numbers of Westerners who were arriving in China in the nineteenth century. The term&rsquo;s use in southwestern China predated its application to Westerners by many centuries, but the same ethnocultural and sinocentric undertones applied in both cases.54 In the context of Yunnan, the term yi (to be distinguished from the more modern ethnonym Yi referred to any indigenous group that was not Han.55 The strongly negative connotations of this definition have prompted me to translate the term as &ldquo;non-Han,&rdquo; although it could be understood generally as &ldquo;indigenous peoples&rdquo; as well.56 Groups as dissimilar as Tibetans, Hani, and Dai were all thrown into a single classification by the Han, even though in many parts of Yunnan one of the indigenous groups could easily be double or triple the size of the resident Han population.</p>
<p>As will be discussed in more depth in chapter 3, the Hui, or &ldquo;Muslim Chinese,&rdquo; were considered neither Yi nor Han Chinese of the Islamic faith; rather, they were perceived by all parties in this Yunnan context as distinct from both Han and Yi. The term &ldquo;Hui&rdquo; for the Muslim Yunnanese57 was not explicitly derogatory; however, the implication was that they were distinct from the Han and thus likely inferior.</p>
<p>The broader ethnonyms of yi and Hui were not openly derogatory. However, the Chinese characters employed to designate specific ethnic groups explicitly articulated Chinese cultural chauvinism and perpetuated the engrained belief that non-Han and Hui were both less than civilized and less than human. The most obvious manifestation of this was the practice of ap26 THE WORLD OF NINETEENTH-CENTURY YUNNAN pending a &ldquo;dog radical&rdquo; (quanzi pang) or &ldquo;insect radical&rdquo; to the group&rsquo;s Chinese ethnonym (examples: luoluo, dulong, zhongren, manzi). These non-Han groups were routinely described in one of two ways. Either the terminology was highly condescending &ldquo;easily duped,&rdquo; &ldquo;slow-witted,&rdquo; &ldquo;uncivilized,&rdquo; and so on-or it made them sound threatening, as in &ldquo;strong,&rdquo; &ldquo;fierce,&rdquo; &ldquo;bold.&ldquo;58 As if these labels were not explicit enough, one nineteenth-century provincial gazetteer interspersed them with descriptions of grotesque and unmistakably nonhuman &ldquo;ethnic groups.&rdquo; For example, the &ldquo;Flying Head tribe&rdquo; was said to come &ldquo;at night and throw their heads into people&rsquo;s homes and feast on small children.&ldquo;59 The reliance of Han Chinese and Qing officials on a tripartite division of ethnicities in nineteenth-century Yunnan had yet another consequence: it perpetuated a variety of ethnic fallacies. In particular, this framework insinuated that there was a parity in numbers among the three groupings when in fact there was not. Han Chinese began arriving in Yunnan in large numbers as early as the thirteenth century, during Yuan dynasty. With government encouragement this immigration continued throughout the Ming dynasty and on into the Qing. No precise figures for this immigration wave are available; however, by the late sixteenth century Yunnan&rsquo;s registered population had reached almost 1.5 million (note here that most indigenous groups were excluded from the registration process).60 These immigrants were still a minority relative to the indigenous population of Yunnan. Moreover, these first immigrants were striking in their diversity. This early influx included Han Chinese from almost every province of China as well as large groups of Mongols, Central Asians, and Manchus. This belies the myth of early Han demographic dominance; it also suggests that the newcomers&rsquo; impact on the indigenous people of Yunnan was less than has long been assumed.</p>
<p>Still another consequence of the tripartite ethnic framework employed by the Qing as well as by many Han Chinese was that it encouraged a highly reified and sinocentric perspective-one which suggested that there were sharp divisions among the three ethnic groupings. This vision was often contradicted by the reality, especially with regard to those settlers who arrived before the late eighteenth century and who became acculturated to Yunnan. These people seem to have embraced many of the same ideals and perspectives as the Yunnanese, and to have intermarried with them: &ldquo;There are quite a few Han villages, they migrated from the interior provinces of China [neidi] the majority coming more than a hundred years ago&hellip; who are now the same as many of the mountain people&hellip; practicing swidden agriculture and similarly abiding by the rule of the local tusi.&ldquo;61 Apparently, these local Han had few conflicts with their multiethnic neighbors. The instances of Han adopting Yi cultural practices, marryingThe World of Nineteenth-Century Yunnan 27 non-Han, and even taking up arms against the Qing contradicted the accepted cultural belief that sinicization was unidirectional.62 The assimilation that was taking place can be attributed in part to the fact that the number of Han immigrants was still relatively small and that they were settling in a limited number of areas. It seems that most Han gravitated to the urban centers. One gazetteer put it this way: &ldquo;In the county seat Han are many and yi few, in the rural areas yi are many and Han few.&ldquo;63 Most accounts date the second wave of Han settlement between 1700 and 1850. Unlike the first, this one fundamentally changed Yunnan society. In the latter half of this period, between 1775 and 1850, Yunnan&rsquo;s population surged from an estimated four million to nearly ten million. As Lee notes in his demographic study of the province, this growth was remarkable: &ldquo;Whereas the population took 300 years to double in the period between the sixteenth and eighteenth centuries, it required less than 100 years to double between the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.&ldquo;64 Most of the Han settlers in this period were from the overpopulated interior provinces of Sichuan, Hunan, Hubei, Guangdong, and Jiangxi. Although not as diverse as the first wave of settlers, they were hardly homogenous. They practiced a wide variety of religions and cultural rituals and often spoke very different dialects. However, these divisions often melted away when they were confronted with the multiethnic and transnational assumptions of Yunnan society. As Dru Gladney has contended with regard to ethnic groups in modern China: &ldquo;Identities are often seen to coalesce and crystallize in the face of higher-order oppositions.&ldquo;65 This was the case with Han Chinese in the multiethnic context of Yunnan when they were confronted with nonHan configurations of ethnicity, power, and territorial control.</p>
<p>The impact of this new wave of settlement on the predominantly nonHan areas of Yunnan seems to have been slow to make itself felt. Imperial records suggest that Han immigrants in the mid to late eighteenth century moved first to the core and urban centers of Yunnan, in response to a need for nonagricultural labor. Only around 1800, after these areas became saturated, did other parts of Yunnan begin to feel direct pressure from the newcomers; only then did they begin to notice the consequences of this population movement.66 Increased contact meant more stringent enforcement of Qing legal codes and a waxing of Chinese cultural influence. For example, wearing of the queue was enforced, and greater fluency in Chinese was now required. Few argue that the Han set out to turn the non-Han into &ldquo;ethnic&rdquo; Han; that said, there is little doubt that Chinese officials were trying to turn them into law-abiding subjects of China by instilling basic Confucian values. In nineteenth-century Yunnan this process involved a variety of measures. In 1818, Governor-General Bolin advocated promoting Confucian teach28 THE WORLD OF NINETEENTH-CENTURY YUNNAN ings in order to modify the customs of the Yi. The Jiaqing emperor supported this program, adding that if the &ldquo;program can be carried out over an extended period of time, then you will successfully change their habits and customs.&ldquo;67 In his study of the prominent eighteenth-century administrator Chen Hongmou, Rowe states that a universalist policy-that is, &ldquo;the marshaling of Confucian arguments in defense of the views that the empire and its people were unitary&rdquo;&ndash;was launched as early as the Yongzheng reign in the 1730s.68 However, the effect of the migration went far beyond encouraging outward expressions of &ldquo;Chinese-ness.&rdquo; More and more settler Han in Yunnan—and this was typical of migrations into imperial borderlands throughout Chinese history-sought nothing less than to transform the transnational and multiethnic Yunnan frontier into a closer approximation of the &ldquo;China&rdquo; from which they had come.</p>
<p>Did these campaigns succeed? And what impact did the settler Han have on the multiethnic culture of Yunnan? A key obstacle to answering these questions is that reports on the relative sizes of the various ethnic groups involved are confusing and contradictory. The conventional wisdom among many recent Chinese and Western scholars has been that by the time of the Ming dynasty at the latest, the Han Chinese had become the single largest ethnic group in Yunnan, and that by the nineteenth century the Han were a majority in the province.69 However, there are several good reasons to doubt the accuracy of these estimates.</p>
<p>Foremost among these is that the figures are based largely on registered population figures-figures that omitted large numbers of non-Han who fell outside the purview of Qing registration efforts.70 Also, the registered population was not broken down along ethnic lines, which suggests that later observers assumed that many urban-dwelling non-Han were Han.71 Many eighteenthand early-nineteenth-century editors of Yunnan gazetteers themselves expressed doubts about the accuracy of the population figures as a whole.72 Nineteenth-century methods for registering the non-Han rarely took ethnicity into account; even so, Chinese sources offer considerable evidence that non-Han continued to form the majority of Yunnan&rsquo;s population into the nineteenth century. Governor-General Zhang Liangji, who served for more than a decade in various offices throughout Yunnan, wrote in 1860 that &ldquo;the yi are a majority constituting seventy percent of the population, the Han constitute only twenty percent, with the Hui barely at ten percent.&ldquo;73 Several years later, another provincial official familiar with Yunnan altered Zhang&rsquo;s figures only slightly, suggesting that the Yi were roughly 50 to 60 percent, with the Han making up 30 to 40 percent and the Hui only 10 to 20 percent.&rdquo; European travelers in the latter half of the nineteenth century agree that The World of Nineteenth-Century Yunnan 29 the non-Han were in the majority. Many commented on the province&rsquo;s ethnic diversity. The French adventurer Jean Dupuis in 1868 commented: &ldquo;In the center of Yunnan, the black and white Lolos [Yi] dominate; in the south and southeast it is the Bai-yi [Dai] and the Dulous [Zhuang] but in all of [Yunnan] there is tremendous variety of tribes and they all have their own unique style, character, [with] customs so different from each other that I cannot speak of each one of them in particular.&ldquo;75 At the turn of the nineteenth century, Henri d&rsquo;Ollone put the Muslim Yunnanese at &ldquo;about a tenth of the population&rdquo; and stated confidently that &ldquo;it would not be an exaggeration to estimate [the non-Han population] at around six million of the approximately ten million inhabitants in Yunnan.&ldquo;76 George Clarke, a Protestant missionary in Dali, estimated Yunnan&rsquo;s total population in the late 1870s as &ldquo;quite six-tenths are aborigines.&ldquo;77 Although these are at best estimates, both Chinese and European observers of the time agree that non-Han groups predominated in Yunnan. This raises doubts about the official registration figures with regard to the proportion of Yunnanese who were Han. The above observations also suggest that non-Han groups must have played a vital role in that society because they were the majority. However, any discussion of when the Han Chinese achieved a numerical majority over non-Han groups-if they ever did-diverts attention from a more significant question: Exactly where did the Han dominate? A century after the period in question, a 1953 census indicated that more than half the prefectures in Yunnan (mainly in the south and west) had nonHan populations of at least around 50 percent.78 In the mid-nineteenth century, then, the issue very likely was not whether Han were the outright majority, but where they dominated (and, one would assume, their culture, customs, and attitudes). On this point there is little controversy: nearly all extant sources tell us that the Han were the overwhelming majority in cities and in the more urbanized prefectures but quite sparse in Yunnan&rsquo;s more mountainous and peripheral areas. Clearly, Yunnan&rsquo;s physical landscape strongly affected the ethnic landscape in ways that divided Yunnan along deep ethnic faultlines.</p>
<p>Ethnic Landscape Nowhere in nineteenth-century Yunnan could one find an ethnic community that did not interact with another group on an almost daily basis. Even in Kunming, the provincial capital, which had the highest concentration of Han Chinese of all the cities in the province, few visitors failed to note the presence of many non-Han in the markets and streets.79 Specific ethnic groups did predominate in several regions—for example, the Dai in trop30 THE WORLD OF NINETEENTH-CENTURY YUNNAN ical Xishuangbanna in the south, and the Naxi in and around Lijiang in the north-but nowhere in Yunnan did a single group exist in isolation. Specific ethnic groups tended to congregate in distinct climatic regions and ecological niches, which ranged from tropical lowlands to mountain highlands. There were so many ethnic groups in the province mainly because Yunnan had been attracting migrants continuously right up through the nineteenth century. It is important to note that the many non-Han ethnic groups were not static entities that passively retreated from the incoming Han (a notion forcefully presented by Wien in China&rsquo;s March Toward the Tropics).80 It is more accurate to say that although many non-Han groups had over the centuries been pushed out of Yunnan&rsquo;s fertile valleys up to the less desirable ridgetops by newly arriving Han Chinese, they continued to practice their cultural beliefs. Furthermore, they were not isolated; rather, they coexisted with the Han who had ousted them.81 In addition, Han and nonHan regularly intermarried throughout this period and in doing so transformed solely &ldquo;Chinese&rdquo; cultural and social forms into ones that were uniquely Yunnanese.</p>
<p>Two-dimensional representations of Yunnan&rsquo;s ethnic distribution can only mask crucial altitudinal divisions among the region&rsquo;s indigenous peoples. Attempts to reduce Yunnan&rsquo;s ethnic diversity to a simplistic dichotomy block understanding of the patterns of Yunnanese regionalism. One way to grasp the complexities of Yunnan&rsquo;s ethnic groups is by utilizing the three regional divisions the Yunnanese themselves employed-eastern, western, and southern Yunnan. In general, although the Han were ubiquitous everywhere, each region contained several non-Han ethnic groups that dominated its culture, politics, and commerce through sheer weight of numbers. In addition to this, smaller groups straddling important mountain passes or dominating specific commercial centers tended to have a greater impact than their numbers might suggest. By structuring a study of Yunnan&rsquo;s ethnic landscape along these regional lines, we can more easily elucidate the ethnic faultlines that crisscrossed Yunnan society.</p>
<p>EASTERN YUNNAN Three main groups inhabited eastern Yunnan during the Qing-the Yi, the Zhuang, and the Miao. The largest ethnic group in all of Yunnan during this period was the Yi (Luoluo or Lolo). They dominated northeastern Yunnan in and around the first slow bend of the Yangtze River; there were also Yi settlements as far west as Dali and as far south as Kaihua and Mengzi.82 Culturally and linguistically, the Yi were a diverse group; however, imperial documents consistently portrayed them as a single, ethnically homogenous entity.83 The World of Nineteenth-Century Yunnan 31 Chinese and European sources often represented the Yi as a fierce mountain people wreaking destruction on Han settlements. Districts near the Yi were presented as scenes of &ldquo;frequent Luoluo raids, whole caravansgoods, animals, and men-being swept off and carried into the inaccessible mountains to the east.&ldquo;84 Despite this reputation for banditry-which was ascribed mainly to the Yi along the border of the Liangshan Mountains in northern Yunnan-many branches of the Yi practiced sedentary agriculture and were active traders.85 In particular, the lowland Yi in eastern Yunnan near Qujing were less combative. They wore their hair in a queue as a mark of submission to the Qing, and they generally accepted their position as Qing subjects.86 The Yi were one of the few ethnic groups in Yunnan besides the nonindigenous Han and Hui to have settlements in all three regions of Yunnan.</p>
<p>The largest group in southeastern Yunnan during the Qing was the Zhuang, often referred to by Qing officials as the Sharen or Nongren. They inhabited the subtropical districts of the eastern region around Wenshan, Honghe, and Qujing. The Zhuang were skilled lowland agriculturists who often grew two and three crops a year, including paddy rice. The Zhuang who occupied these coveted lowlands were heavily influenced by Han culture. However, they preferred to live apart from the Han Chinese in their own villages; in these, they practiced their distinctive festivals and retained the customs and rituals that marked them apart from the ethnic Chinese settlers.</p>
<p>Finally, all along the border with neighboring Guizhou were many Miao communities. For the most part, the Miao were culturally, socially, and ethnically oriented toward Guizhou, where the largest concentrations of Miao were to be found. They lived mainly in small mountain villages and tended to depend on agriculture for their livelihood.87 Much like the Yi and the Zhuang, the Miao were cast as less civilized by the Han, who portrayed them as culturally inferior and often dangerous.</p>
<p>WESTERN YUNNAN Because western Yunnan stretches from the mountainous Tibetan Plateau south to the tropical highlands of Burma, it is especially difficult to generalize about the people living there. Along the northern and southern borders of western Yunnan lived two ethnic groups, respectively the Lisu and the Yeren88 (Jingpo)-literally &ldquo;savage people.&rdquo; In the nineteenth century, these two dominated the key trade routes in and out of Yunnan, although both were small relative to other Yunnan groups. The Lisu lived in mountain villages above the Salween River in alpine forests between five thousand and nine thousand feet. 89 With other Tibetan groups, the Lisu had 32 THE WORLD OF NINETEENTH-CENTURY YUNNAN established an autonomous zone that was largely impervious to Qing jurisdiction and in fact often threatened it.90 Like the Lisu, the Yeren dominated trade routes, but they did so in the southwest, in the semitropical Yeren Mountains. In upland Burma, the Yeren lived in small villages and generally practiced a form of swidden agriculture. During the nineteenth century many Yeren launched frequent raids on sedentary agricultural settlements; other Yeren used their control of key valleys between Burma and Yunnan to collect tolls from passing caravans.91 Besides the Lisu and Yeren there were many &ldquo;lowland groups&rdquo; (a relative term in western Yunnan, applied to those who occupied valleys, which were not necessarily at low elevations). By the nineteenth century these groups were extremely active in trade. The Bai (Minjia) lived in and around Dali at the foot of the Cangshan Mountains and practiced sedentary agriculture and husbandry.22 They were probably descendants of Yunnan&rsquo;s earliest inhabitants and were the most acculturated of its indigenous peoples. A mideighteenth-century Chinese gazetteer described them as &ldquo;hardworking, sedentary agriculturists, rather studious, Confucianists, good mannered.&ldquo;93 He then paid the Bai the highest compliment possible for a Han Chinese chronicler: &ldquo;[The Bai] are no different from Han [yu Hanren wuyi].&ldquo;94 Another lowland group, the Naxi, were concentrated in the northwest in and around the urban center of Lijiang. There, they served as commercial (and probably cultural) mediators in the trade between the Tibetan borderlands and central Yunnan.95 Although long familar with Chinese practices, the Naxi had their own resilient ethnic identity, which was based largely on their own Dongba script, which they used in their religious and cultural practices.</p>
<p>Both the Bai and the Naxi played critical roles in cross-border trade. The Bai hosted Yunnan&rsquo;s largest annual commercial gathering, the Third-Month Fair in Dali; the Naxi hosted the Horse Fair in Lijiang. Both groups were active in the caravan trade. The Naxi caravans dominated the trade routes into Tibet.</p>
<p>SOUTHERN YUNNAN The dominant ethnic group in southern Yunnan in the nineteenth century was the Tai (or Dai), also referred to in Chinese writings as Baiyi.96 It is generally believed that the Tai emigrated during the first millennium BC from south-central China (today&rsquo;s Guizhou and Guangxi). Their slow migration &ldquo;along the south China coast to the Red River Delta and into what is now northern Vietnam&rdquo; and Yunnan was an effort to elude the expanding Chinese Empire.97 Tai political power was concentrated to the south of The World of Nineteenth-Century Yunnan 33 Yunnan Province; however, many Tai communities existed throughout southern Yunnan. 98 The northernmost of these Tai polities, Xishuangbanna (Sipsongpanna in Thai), began a formal relationship with the Ming court in the fourteenth century and was governed as a pacified administrative region named Cheli.99 This political relationship was never stable, for the region was only nominally under Chinese authority. The Tai were a potent political force and acted with considerable autonomy from the imperial court throughout the nineteenth century.</p>
<p>The second dominant ethnic group in southern Yunnan, the Woni (Hani), were for the most part dispersed along the northern portions of Xishuangbanna up to Jingdong, Linʼan, and Yuanjiang. 100 They were skilled farmers and had transformed their steep hillsides into highly productive terraces of such beauty that one Chinese gazetteer characterized them as follows: &ldquo;From a distance [the Woni] terraces look like they could be from a painting.&ldquo;101 Their territory attracted considerable numbers of Han immigrants, and as a consequence, many Woni became increasingly involved in commercial activities, including the selling of bamboo utensils and other handicrafts in town markets. 102 As we shall see in chapter 4, this led to increasing friction between Han immigrants and the Woni and to extended periods of violence. The influence of these non-Han groups on Qing efforts to integrate Yunnan Province during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries is not fully understood. This is partly because records from this period reflect the Qing&rsquo;s efforts to reduce Yunnan&rsquo;s ethnic diversity to a simple &ldquo;we/they&rdquo; dichotomy. It is clear, though, that the non-Han remained an important element in the Qing&rsquo;s approach to governing Yunnan.</p>
