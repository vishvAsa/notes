Five columns of troops spread out from north to south and attacked along an eastward trajectory with devastating effectiveness, capturing all towns they encountered. For nearly ten years, Dali had been the political, cultural, and commercial center of the Hui-led insurgency against the Qing dynasty. Over that time the rebels had slowly strengthened their control over much of eastern and southern Yunnan. Just over six months after opening their initial campaign in the east, Du’s generals surrounded Kunming, trapping the bulk of the imperial army and leaving only a few of the province’s easternmost prefectures under imperial control. For the next two years Du and his multiethnic allies were the undisputed masters of Yunnan.">

  <p>CHAPTER 9 Ethereal Deeds: The Struggle to Reclaim Yunnan, 1867-1873 The Pinnacle of Success: The Pingnan State, 1867-1869 In the spring of 1867, Du Wenxiu, the leader and commander-in-chief of the multiethnic Dali Kingdom, launched his troops from the city of Dali in a massive assault on Kunming, the last major imperial stronghold in Yunnan Province. Five columns of troops spread out from north to south and attacked along an eastward trajectory with devastating effectiveness, capturing all towns they encountered. For nearly ten years, Dali had been the political, cultural, and commercial center of the Hui-led insurgency against the Qing dynasty. Over that time the rebels had slowly strengthened their control over much of eastern and southern Yunnan. Just over six months after opening their initial campaign in the east, Du&rsquo;s generals surrounded Kunming, trapping the bulk of the imperial army and leaving only a few of the province&rsquo;s easternmost prefectures under imperial control. For the next two years Du and his multiethnic allies were the undisputed masters of Yunnan.</p>
<p>In the spring and summer of 1867, with the Dali regime at the height of its power, Du Wenxiu issued three public decrees. The first was his Proclamation from the Headquarters of the Generalissimo (shuaifu bugao), which appealed for popular support for the sultanate&rsquo;s eastward campaign; the second was his Declaration of War (shishi wen); and the third and last was his Summons to Arms (xingshi xiwen). These three documents expressed clearly and emphatically the regime&rsquo;s ideological, military, and political objectives as well as its vision for an independent Yunnan.</p>
<p>All three decrees were crafted to raise broad support for the kingdom&rsquo;s final push to control the entire province and offered a forceful critique of Manchu rule in Yunnan. Instead of casting the rebellion as the expression of a specific ideology or religious creed, Du Wenxiu highlighted the erosion of moral righteousness under the Qing. Adopting the tone of a reluctant rebel, 162 THE STRUGGLE TO RECLAIM YUNNAN he justified the rebellion by detailing the Qing&rsquo;s many deviations from the proper role of Chinese emperors: There is a saying that it takes a civil administration to keep the peace, and the military to stabilize the country. When the Five Emperors depended upon rituals and music to rule, the Three Kings had to fight to pacify all the land under Heaven. All men act in accordance with their conscience. The reason for this expedition is to chastise the Manchus who took our land for more than 200 years treating the people [renmin] as horses and ox, regarded life as expendable like the trees and grasses, injured my brothers, and tormented the Hui.1 Du&rsquo;s statement denotes a marked shift from the regime&rsquo;s earlier hope to free all of China from Qing rule. His declarations of 1867 reveal a hope to &ldquo;achieve a smaller more remote success like that of the Nanzhao&rdquo; and control only Yunnan.2 Du&rsquo;s change in goals likely stemmed from the Qing&rsquo;s recent victories over Hong Xiuquan and the Taiping rebels. He now felt compelled to frame his proclamations in specifically Yunnanese terms. More consistent with his statements early in the rebellion, he also underscored the province&rsquo;s panethnic nature. Thus in his Summon to Arms he portrayed the Qing as fomenting strife between ethnic groups: Generalissimo Du of the foot-soldiers and cavalry is leading an expedition in five routes to recover of the whole realm of Dian [Yunnan] to expel cruelty and to alleviate the good and lawful. . . . In the province of Dian-nan [Yunnan], the Hui, the Han, and the non-Han have been living among one another for over a thousand years. Friendly towards each other, helping one another in times of need, how could there be divisions between [us]? But since the Manchus usurped the throne for more than two hundred years, our people have been maltreated.3 French explorer Louis de Carné intuited Dali&rsquo;s revised territorial aspirations when he noted that peace could be secured if the Qing &ldquo;would accept Yunnan, as the boundaries to the independent kingdom which [Du] aspires to establish.&ldquo;4 The proclamations emanating from Dali reflected more than simply proYunnan and anti-Qing sentiments. They underscore just how deft Du Wenxiu was at promoting his vision of an independent and multiethnic Yunnan. In his Declaration of War, he noted: &ldquo;The army has three purposes: first we must root out the Manchus, then conciliate the Han and, thirdly, weed out the wicked [collaborators].&ldquo;5 In his decrees, Du consistently emphasized the central fact of Yunnan&rsquo;s multiethnic population and that ethnic tolerance would be a cornerstone of his regime.</p>
<p>Du was aware of the danger that the rebellion might be perceived as simply a Han-versus-Hui conflict, so in his proclamations he carefully articulated a message that would attract all Yunnanese. The clearest example of The Struggle to Reclaim Yunnan 163 this was his Summons to Arms, in which he reminded the Yunnanese of the events that had provoked the rebellion and were making it drag on: When the Shiyang Mine Incident erupted &ldquo;all of the fish in the pond were affected.&ldquo;6 Those who were strong turned violent and oppressive, those who were weak could find nary a mouse hole in which to hide&hellip;. Incompetent officials, exhausting all of their ruses, concocted policy on the fly. [They] acted in opposition to the correct principles; perversely, the murderer of a vice general [xiezhen] was promoted as vice general, and the murderer of a military commissioner was promoted as military commissioner. Learned men withdrew and incompetents conspired. At first they helped Han massacre Hui, now they helped Hui massacre Han; then they helped Han kill Han, now they help Hui kill Hui.7 In other words, the conflict affected all Yunnanese, pitting good against evil and preying on the divisions between and within ethnic groups. To not fight would to be to succumb willingly to that evil; to fight would be to secure peace in the name of all that Yunnan represented.</p>
<p>This was the message of a reluctant warrior. In his Declaration of War, Du Wenxiu as generalissimo portrayed the final campaign as one against the imperialist forces, not against the Yunnanese themselves: &ldquo;We are facing the other side with spear and lance only because of their opposition&hellip;. When we achieve victory in our attack there must be no looting, no coveting others&rsquo; wealth and property, and no mistreatment of women.&ldquo;8 Together the three proclamations present a confident and determined government that was clear in its political and ideological stance. Under Du Wenxiu, it had survived militarily, it had founded a government with broad and strong popular support, and it was determined to build an independent Yunnan.</p>
<p>The Dali Sultanate&rsquo;s Final Offensive: 1867-1868 Dali&rsquo;s military offensive of May 1867 was an all-out attack on eastern and southern Yunnan. It is unclear why Du and his council chose this moment to launch the campaign. Earlier in the year, Ma Rulong and his fellow Hui officer Yang Zhenpeng had led Qing forces west toward Dali. Perhaps Du had waited for the imperial forces to be drawn out of their defensive positions in and around Kunming. Perhaps the imperial offensive coincided with plans already laid by Dali&rsquo;s generals. Or perhaps it was-as some suggest that news of Governor-General Lao Chongguang&rsquo;s sudden death in late February had reached Dali.? What is clear is that by early July 1867, Du&rsquo;s armies, &ldquo;several tens of thousands of soldiers,&rdquo; were crushing all the imperial forces in their path.10 The westward offensive met little sustained resistance at first. Each of Du&rsquo;s sixteen top generals had been assigned objectives in a coordinated 164 THE STRUGGLE TO RECLAIM YUNNAN Tibet Bhamo N 200 Kilometers Prefectural Capital Provincial Capital Sichuan Zhaotong Lijiang For Yongbei Heging Dongchuan Jianchuan Langqiong F H Baijing Dayao Guizhou Yuanmou Xundian Dali Ter Yaozhou Heijing Luquan Sungming Vuding Dingyuan Baoshan Qujing Guangtong Luoci Tengyue Zhennan Fumin Chuxiong Shunning Jingdong Lafeng OKunming Anning Nan&rsquo;an Kunvang Chengjiang Yimen Jinning Chenggong Mianning Zhenyuan Guangxi Xinxing Guangnan For Weiyuan Yuanjiang Guanyi Kaihua Lin&rsquo;an Burma Pu&rsquo;er ⚫ County-level or lower Cities under Dali Rule Simao MAP 9.1. Cities under Dali or Hui Control, 1867-1868 Vietnam main thrust toward central Yunnan. Together, they overwhelmed the Qing outposts. Seeking not to repeat the mistakes of Qing attacks on Dali, the sultanate went to great lengths to avoid overextending its supply lines. Instead of relying entirely on caravans from Dali, its armies employed artisans at designated cities along the route to make gunpowder and other items essential to the offensive.11 Dali&rsquo;s strategy also hoped to coax those Hui officers under Ma Rulong to shift their allegiance to Dali. According to Émile Rocher: &ldquo;Emissaries from the sultan of Dali took letters to officials in districts [under imperial control] where Hui were in command, exhorting them to join the ranks under his banner, which would in the near future be floating over all the province. Seduced by this vision which assured them power, as well as by the fact they were of the same religion, many among them joined the rebels. &ldquo;12 This strategy bore fruit almost immediately. Only days after the campaign began, two key Hui commanders, He Guoan and Yang Xianzhi, surrendered the western Yunnan city of Dayao to the rebels and joined its eastward campaign.13 A steady string of defections followed as the armies advanced eastward.</p>
<p>The Struggle to Reclaim Yunnan 165 As the main column of the Dali forces approached Kunming, the rate of defections escalated dramatically. The first to go over to Du&rsquo;s side were Ma Rulong&rsquo;s close associates, Yang Zhenpeng and Tian Qingyu. By covertly signaling their intentions in advance, the Pingnan army easily captured Jinning and Chenggong without a battle. 14 Only six months after leaving Dali, rebel forces began to pour onto the plain surrounding Kunming (see Map 9.1). As they took up their positions, three more Hui officials took advantage of Ma Rulong&rsquo;s absence from Kunming to join Du Wenxiu&rsquo;s forces. Du bestowed on each the title of general (dasi) and pressed the assault on Kunming.</p>
<p>CHERISHING AN AUDIENCE FROM AFAR By the spring of 1868 the Dali regime and its non-Han allies controlled cities from the Tibetan border to Tengyue on the Burmese border and from Pu&rsquo;er in the south to Xundian in the northeast-more than thirty county or prefectural seats in all. His troops now surrounded the provincial capital and had defeated every major imperial force in the province.</p>
<p>Around this time, two groups of Europeans, one French and the other British, were traveling through rebel-controlled Yunnan. The French Mekong Expedition, led by Francis Garnier15 and Louis de Carné, entered Yunnan from the south in the autumn of 1867 and eventually reached Dali by way of southern Sichuan. The British group under Colonel Edward Sladen entered Yunnan from Burma in May 1868 and spent several weeks in the southwestern town of Tengyue, which the Panthays controlled. Neither group knew about the other&rsquo;s presence and objectives. Both met and talked to top officials from the Dali regime and were later able to offer extraordinary insights into the goals and achievements of the twelve-year sultanate.</p>
<p>The two expeditions were organized under distinctly different auspices but had similar goals. The leaders of both sought most of all to learn more about a regime that had carved out an independent kingdom and fended off Qing attacks for more than a decade. Throughout their travels in Yunnan in 1867 and 1868, they observed a mature state at the height of its powers. Yet both expeditions were driven by more than innocent curiosity. They also wanted to evaluate the commercial potential of Yunnan and to ascertain Dali&rsquo;s position vis-à-vis the growing European presence on Yunnan&rsquo;s southern border. Finally, each group hoped to travel to Dali and meet Du Wenxiu, who remained a mystery in the West.</p>
<p>In contrast, the Europeans posed little mystery to Du Wenxiu and his officials, who seem to have been well informed about the growing European presence in Southeast Asia. Du had been sending trading missions to Burma, so his regime would surely have been aware that France and Britain were a growing presence in the region. There is also evidence that the Dali regime 166 THE STRUGGLE TO RECLAIM YUNNAN was in contact with a number of Southeast Asians, attracting individuals with technical, religious, and linguistic expertise.16 Even more intriguing is that the sultanate may have employed European military advisors. Many members of the two expeditions reported rumors that five, fourteen, or sixteen &ldquo;Europeans&rdquo; were employed by the Dali court.17 These rumors are difficult to assess; the foreigners may not have been Europeans at all but, as French explorer Garnier suggests, &ldquo;probably Burmans or Hindoos, for their skin was nearly black,&rdquo; or even Malays. 18 That said, it is not inconceivable that Europeans, Indians, and Southeast Asians traveled to the Dali Kingdom since Italians, French, Irish, British, Filipinos, and Indians had at various points aided the Taipings. 19 If Europeans did ever serve the sultanate, their secret remained well kept.</p>
<p>Whether or not the Dali court knew why the European missions were on its territory, Du Wenxiu realized they might be powerful allies against the Qing. Du&rsquo;s attentiveness to the regime&rsquo;s international position is rarely acknowledged, yet it was evident in the different receptions the two expeditions enjoyed. Even before arriving in Yunnan, the British expedition had requested and received permission from the sultanate to travel to Dali. The French expedition had stumbled into the province in search of the source of the Mekong and was completely unaware of the rebellion; as a consequence, Du treated its members with far more suspicion.</p>
<p>The French Mekong Expedition was the first of the two European missions to enter Yunnan in 1867. On arriving in Kunming in late December 1867, its leaders met Ma Rulong and Ma Dexin and received assistance from French missionaries residing in the capital.20 After resting for several weeks they asked permission to travel to Dali. Because of Du&rsquo;s military offensive, this was denied them (and derided as extremely foolhardy). They did, however, procure a letter of introduction, in Arabic and Chinese, from Ma Dexin. With this, they decided to attempt the journey without authorization. To evade Dali&rsquo;s offensive in central Yunnan, they were compelled to travel north through Dongchuan, then west along the upper Yangtze before dropping south toward Dali.</p>
<p>On the basis of Ma Dexin&rsquo;s letter, the French were graciously welcomed by all local Panthay officials along their route. In perhaps the most bizarre twist of their journey, they met another French Catholic missionary in a remote village a day&rsquo;s journey from Dali. Father Leguilcher had been living clandestinely in Dali-controlled territory since the beginning of the rebellion. After listening to their plan (and fearing for their safety), he agreed to escort them to the city and act as their translator.21 On February 29, 1868, the French explorers, led by Leguilcher, arrived at the fortifications of Shangguan, which sealed the upper pass leading to the Dali plain. After deliberating for a full forty-eight hours over how to receive the rather suddenThe Struggle to Reclaim Yunnan 167 visitors, Du Wenxiu and his council gave the French permission to proceed down the valley to Dali.22 Early in the morning of March 2, 1868, they passed through Dali&rsquo;s massive city gate and were escorted to Du Wenxiu&rsquo;s residence. As word spread, a growing throng of people began to press around the Europeans, intent on getting a look at them. In the confusion, a guard snatched the hat from the head of one of the French soldiers so that Du, who was watching from above, could better see his face. The Frenchman, unsure and angered, &ldquo;punished this insolence with a blow that bloodied the face of the aggressor.&ldquo;23 To prevent further incidents, Du ordered the Frenchmen to be quickly escorted to lodgings just outside the city walls.</p>
<p>Soon after they settled in, a member of Du&rsquo;s council visited the French to ask them why they were in Dali. On being told they wanted an audience with the sultan, he informed them that audiences with Du Wenxiu followed specific ceremonial rules. Above all, every individual coming before Du was required to &ldquo;genuflect three times before the Sultan&rdquo;; also, no one would be allowed to carry a firearm.24 The French officers refused to perform the koutou before any foreign sovereign. The official agreed that in lieu of performing the koutou they would only have to show Du the same respect they would offer their own sovereign; however, they still had to pledge not to bring firearms with them.</p>
<p>The following morning, the officials returned and told them that Du Wenxiu wished to see only Father Leguilcher. Leaving his companions behind, the Catholic priest was escorted to an audience hall, where two imposing cannons were permanently trained on the main doorways, primed and loaded to prevent any attempt on Du&rsquo;s life. As he entered, he found the sultan waiting for him. Throughout the three-hour audience, the priest remained standing. Du peppered him with questions: How long had the priest lived on territory controlled by Dali? What was the mission of the French explorers? What authority did they have from their own government to travel to Dali? When Leguilcher told him he had lived in Yunnan for more than fourteen years, Du displayed his characteristic aplomb by informing the priest: &ldquo;Then you are my subject.&rdquo; Clearly, he took this declaration quite seriously, since he followed it with an offer for Leguilcher to remain in western Yunnan and assume a post in the Pingnan government.</p>
<p>Du also displayed a startling awareness of and tolerance toward Leguilcher&rsquo;s Christian beliefs. At one point he informed Leguilcher: &ldquo;I have read your religious works and I have found nothing inappropriate.&rdquo; Du then informed him that &ldquo;Muslims and Christians are brothers.&ldquo;25 The sultan was less pleased with the missionary&rsquo;s role in helping the French expedition reach Dali. Displaying a nuanced understanding of Yunnan&rsquo;s geopolitical importance, Du berated the missionary for &ldquo;introducing 168 THE STRUGGLE TO RECLAIM YUNNAN into Dali people of their sort. . . who come to map the roads, measure the distances and sketch the countryside with the intention of occupying it.”26 Obviously concerned about the French expedition&rsquo;s territorial interests in Yunnan, he ordered Leguilcher to &ldquo;tell them that they can help themselves to all the territory along the Lancangjiang [Mekong] River but that they are obliged to stop at the borders of my kingdom.&ldquo;27 As the audience concluded, he ordered the priest to &ldquo;take the French to the edge of my state, and tell them to never come back. &ldquo;28 The following day the French were escorted to the upper pass. From there, under cover of night, they began their journey back to Qing-controlled Yunnan.</p>
<p>Based largely on this one incident, Du Wenxiu has been portrayed as having had minimal understanding of or desire for relations with France and Britain. He has been represented as starkly antiforeign. In perhaps the bestknown analysis of Du&rsquo;s foreign policy, Chinese scholar Tian Rukang concluded that &ldquo;Du resisted foreign intervention in the Muslim rebellion and expelled foreign expeditions from rebel-held territory.&ldquo;29 Yet this seems not to have been the case.</p>
<p>Thomas Cooper, who was in Yunnan in 1868 at the same time as the French, offered perhaps the most commonly given reason why Du Wenxiu gave the French an unfriendly reception. He posits that a monetary loan arranged by Garnier and de Carné while they were in Kunming had disastrous consequences for them when they arrived in Dali. In return for the funds, which they desperately needed, Ma Rulong asked them to send him a shipment of arms when they returned to Shanghai. It seems that this deal was not made in secret. When Cooper was in Weixi, a Hui merchant told him that &ldquo;news of this proposal had at once been sent to the Emperor Du Wenxiu and Lieutenant Garnier was doomed but for the timely help of the missionaries. &ldquo;30 Du was far better informed of their actions than the French realized at the time.</p>
<p>By the French explorers&rsquo; own accounts, Du Wenxiu seems to have probed their intentions quite carefully. Once they arrived in Dali, one of the first questions Du&rsquo;s officials asked them was whether they had been &ldquo;expressly sent by their sovereign to Dali.&ldquo;31 To this they replied—perhaps too candidly— that when they left Indochina neither they nor their government had any knowledge of the rebellion, so how could they have been sent to meet with Du? The French assumed this was an innocent question; in fact, Du had already been in contact with Sladen&rsquo;s mission from Bhamô and was likely asking himself what opportunities the French might offer his regime-and what threats they might pose.32 The above scenario would be entirely speculative except that Father Leguilcher&rsquo;s superior in Kunming, when writing to the mission&rsquo;s directors in Paris several months later, mentioned that Du encouraged him to &ldquo;return The Struggle to Reclaim Yunnan 169 [to Dali] since we have also learned of an English commission which is making its way to Dali from Ava, Bhamo, etc.&ldquo;33 If this is true, Du was acutely aware of events far beyond Yunnan and was carefully considering possible contacts with Western governments.</p>
<p>Sladen&rsquo;s mission experienced a far different reception. Having arranged their visit the previous year, on May 23, 1868, they were greeted at the DaliBurma border by a multiethnic escort of &ldquo;Panthay and Kakheyn [Karen] guards.&ldquo;34 The following day they were guided to Tengyue, an important entrepôt, where the governor extended them an official welcome. During their visit the &ldquo;governor stated that the Sultan had been pleased to hear of our intended visit to Tengyue&rdquo;; however, because he could not guarantee their safety on the roads, they would not be allowed to continue to Dali.35 For the next six weeks, however, the British were free &ldquo;to come and go as we liked.&ldquo;36 In stark contrast to the cool reception the French had received in Dali, the local hosts treated the British-and their Indian soldiers, many of whom were Muslims-as honored guests. Despite the open friendliness displayed by both sides, very little actually came of Sladen&rsquo;s mission. The British never did obtain a commercial treaty, but they did come to an understanding with the governor over &ldquo;the duties which should be levied on future caravans, and received letters expressive of the desire of the Panthay sultan&rsquo;s government to enter into friendly relations with our government and foster mutual trade.&ldquo;37 In turn, the British supplied the governor with &ldquo;two seals, wherewith to authenticate his future letters.&ldquo;38 Although its specific accomplishments were minimal, the mission laid the groundwork for future relations and left both sides content and hopeful. On their return, the mission&rsquo;s ranking officers, Sladen and Anderson, submitted reports which proposed that British authorities begin promoting trade with Dali. Just over a year after their return, on November 30, 1869, an assistant political agent was assigned the task of protecting those British merchants who were interested in trade with Dali.39 The Sladen mission could not have known that even as its members walked through Tengyue&rsquo;s city gates to begin their return journey to Burma, Dali&rsquo;s military fortunes in eastern Yunnan were beginning to turn for the worse.</p>
<p>THE TURNING TIDE In the spring of 1867, Ma Rulong&rsquo;s situation in Kunming remained bleak. Ma had staked his future on a Qing intervention in Yunnan that had yet to materialize. Two years earlier, in December 1865, an imperial censor had warned the court that &ldquo;the only official in Yunnan&rsquo;s provincial capital was Ma Rulong. Cen Yuying was far away in Qujing. The GovernorGeneral and Governor have not been in Yunnan for a long time.&ldquo;40 170 THE STRUGGLE TO RECLAIM YUNNAN This of course was an understatement. In 1860, after Zhang Liangji was ordered to Beijing to be investigated, the only governor or governor-general who dared enter the province and take up his post in Kunming had been Governor-General Pan Duo. As if to confirm the fears of those who had refused to enter the province before him, Pan was assassinated only four months after arriving there. His death capped an amazing run of ineptitude, bad luck, and corruption among the province&rsquo;s top imperial representatives. Mary Wright&rsquo;s laconic summary of the pathetic performance of Yunnan&rsquo;s officials during the rebellion: &ldquo;Among the governors-general and governors of the period, one was murdered, one was a suicide, one lost his mind, one refused to enter the province to take up his duties, and several had to be recalled for gross incompetence.&ldquo;41 Except for Pan Duo&rsquo;s brief residence, between 1860 and 1866 no one occupied the governor-general&rsquo;s yamen in Kunming. The same was true for the office of governor: between 1863 and 1868, all appointees either refused to enter the province or were ordered to fight the Miao rebels in neighboring Guizhou (see Tables 9.1 and 9.2).</p>
<p>Ma Rulong&rsquo;s position improved slightly on March 21, 1866, when Governor-General Lao Chongguang finally entered Kunming. He had been appointed immediately after Pan Duo&rsquo;s death four years earlier but had refused to enter the province for nearly three years, only doing so when the court threatened him with dismisal. Lao and Ma quickly developed a constructive working relationship and began organizing a campaign against western Yunnan. Then, less than a year later, just as the campaign was set to begin its march westward, Lao suddenly fell ill. He died four days later, on February 21, 1867.4 42 With the loss of his key imperial patron, Ma Rulong and those Hui who had accepted Qing offices several years earlier once again came under suspicion from both the court and those anti-Hui elements still prevalent in Yunnan and neighboring provinces. Rumors spread that Lao had been murdered as part of a plot to keep the province under Hui control. Other reports suggested that the Hui &ldquo;who could not pardon him for their humiliation at his hands&hellip; poisoned him. &ldquo;43 These accounts were almost certainly the product of lingering bias and fertile imaginations.</p>
<p>There is little evidence that Lao was murdered. In response to rumors about poisoning, one commentator pointed out: &ldquo;We should remember the important positions that many Muslims occupied [under Qing governance] and the good relations their leaders had with the viceroy [Lao] making it difficult to conceive of any interests that would [have made them] want him dead.&ldquo;44 Such logic, however, was no impediment those who continued to suspect the motives of Ma Rulong and other Hui.</p>
<p>In all likelihood, Lao&rsquo;s death was no mystery; it was only bad timing.

When queried about his illness, he had &ldquo;placed his hand underneath his heart indicating that was the area of his pain.&ldquo;45 This led the missionary to suspect a stroke or heart attack as the cause of death. Even so, the campaign to remove Ma Rulong from his position began almost at once.</p>
<p>On March 10, word of Lao&rsquo;s death reached Governor Liu Yuezhao, who was more than twenty days distant in Guizhou. Although he lacked any firsthand knowledge of the circumstances of Lao&rsquo;s death and had never even entered Yunnan, he immediately dispatched a memorial maligning Ma Rulong.46 In his memorial he criticized Ma and the other pacified Hui. Reverting to hackneyed stereotypes, he told the court that &ldquo;the Hui disposition is outwardly loyal but inwardly plotting evil intentions.&ldquo;47 Yet he also asked to remain in Guizhou, arguing that situation there was more urgent than the one in Yunnan.48 The emperor&rsquo;s rescript suggests he was predisposed to Liu&rsquo;s anti-Hui stance. In it he expressed concern that the provincial capital had no ranking official now that Lao was dead. Thus it was vital &ldquo;that the [newly appointed] Yun-Gui Governor-General enter the capital.&ldquo;49 On this front, however, the court made little headway. The replacement for Lao, an official named Zhang Kaisong, made excuses for more than half a year not to enter the province before finally being dismissed.50 In the interval, Ma Rulong was not aiding his own cause. In late July the court received reports that Ma&rsquo;s army was in full retreat. In his first foray westward, he had encountered the full force of Du Wenxiu&rsquo;s offensive; not only that, but his troops were dying from the plague in large numbers.51 By early October all imperial forces in western Yunnan were either under attack or in retreat from Du&rsquo;s offensive. By December 1867 Kunming itself was within striking distance of the Dali armies. 52 Within months it had become extremely unlikely that Ma could lead the projected western campaign. He had lost Lao Chongguang, his primary imperial supporter, and the Hui officers on whom his military future depended were deserting in ever increasing numbers.</p>
<p>Individually, Ma Rulong remained resolutely loyal to the Qing. There are no indications whatsoever that he contemplated joining Du Wenxiu&rsquo;s government. In his communications from the period, he praised recent Qing admissions of past wrongs and chastised those Hui who had turned their backs on the court&rsquo;s generous offer of clemency. By now he also realized that because he continued to resist, most Hui leaders would forever consider him a betrayer of his people.</p>
<p>Ma Rulong&rsquo;s growing isolation from the Hui did not go unnoticed by the Qing. In memorials dating back to 1864, imperial officials noted that his own troops were growing increasing hostile toward him and suggested that The Struggle to Reclaim Yunnan 173 even Ma Dexin had opposed Ma Rulong&rsquo;s acceptance of the policy of &ldquo;using Hui to fight other Hui.&ldquo;53 Ma Rulong replied to these charges by describing Du Wenxiu&rsquo;s crimes as far worse, &ldquo;adhering neither to state laws [guofa] nor the teachings of the Qur&rsquo;an [jingdian].&ldquo;54 By ardently promoting the Qing and bolstering his position vis-à-vis the court, he was undermining whatever leverage he had among his fellow Hui.</p>
<p>As Ma Rulong lost support among the Hui, his usefulness to the empire declined. The Qing now saw him as an increasingly isolated leader of troops whose loyalty was questionable, so they began looking for other ways to counter the grave threat posed by Du Wenxiu.55 By the winter of 1867, Ma Rulong had no chance left of leading the Qing to victory. He would continue to play a vital role, but never again would the court be tempted by his strategy of &ldquo;using Hui to defeat the Hui.&rdquo; Instead, the court would turn to another man, who had been rising rapidly through the military and civil ranks. His name: Cen Yuying.</p>
<p>THE RISE OF CEN YUYING Cen Yuying was a native of neighboring Guangxi Province. In the wake of Taiping uprisings in 1850, he had formed a militia and quelled several minor insurrections around his hometown, Xilin. His victories were sufficiently worthy that the governor-general recommended he be assigned to the post of assistant magistrate.56 Soon after the Panthay Rebellion broke out in 1856, Cen led his militia into Yunnan to help the Qing put down the unrest there. He participated in the first imperial campaign on Dali in 1857-for which he received a commendation from the throne&ndash;but it was not until 1859 that his military prowess began to have an impact on the imperial army&rsquo;s operations in Yunnan.57 Having returned to his home county in 1858 to recruit more men, he reentered Yunnan in 1859 reinvigorated and heading a formidable militia of several thousand men. In their first engagement, his troops overpowered a group of Hui insurgents occupying the county seat of Yiliang, twenty miles east of Kunming.58 After capturing the city and executing the rebel leader, Cen was rewarded with the office of acting magistrate of Yiliang. The following year he joined forces with the acting provincial military commander, Lin Ziqing, in a successful attack on the departmental seat of Lunan, a day&rsquo;s march south of Yiliang.</p>
<p>These two quick victories at a time of imperial defeats earned Cen the praise of Governor Xu Zhiming, who in 1861 promoted him to acting prefect of Chengjiang, a wealthy prefecture southwest of Kunming. Cen&rsquo;s rapid rise continued when at Xu&rsquo;s behest he helped orchestrate Ma Rulong&rsquo;s final surrender to the Qing in 1862. Soon after that he was appointed acting provincial judge. Thus in less than three years he had made himself a key 174 THE STRUGGLE TO RECLAIM YUNNAN figure in the imperial&rsquo;s government&rsquo;s desperate efforts to retain control of the province.</p>
<p>The following year Cen sealed his high reputation both in the province and in the court by reacting quickly to Pan Duo&rsquo;s assassination. Joining forces with Ma Rulong, he took Kunming back from the rebels and crushed what had been the most serious threat to Qing authority up to that point in the rebellion.59 Although they had retaken Kunming together, Cen Yuying and Ma Rulong would have a strained relationship for the rest of the rebellion. Neither man ever openly expressed his sentiments, but it is telling that they only rarely based their operations in the same city. Ma Rulong remained in Kunming; Cen based himself in the eastern Yunnan city of Qujing. It is probable that like many other Han residents of Yunnan, Cen questioned the imperial court&rsquo;s strategy of allowing a Hui to dominate the province&rsquo;s political and military affairs.60 The situation had not changed three years later, in 1866, when Lao Chongguang entered the province as governor-general. This is not to suggest that Cen suffered in the eyes of the court or fellow officials because of his frosty demeanor toward Ma Rulong. In his memorials to the throne, Lao spoke highly of Cen&rsquo;s military accomplishments and strategies for the future. Yet Lao&rsquo;s evaluation of the situation made it clear that he believed Ma Rulong, not Cen, would be key to ending the rebellion in Yunnan.61 Lao was basing his strategy on the belief that sending an imperial force led by a Han Chinese would only exacerbate ethnic tensions and that Ma, as a Hui, would be in a stronger position to persuade Du Wenxiu and his generals to surrender.</p>
<p>A few months after arriving in Kunming, Lao Chongguang wrote to the throne announcing a new military strategy for Yunnan and Guizhou: Ma Rulong would lead the campaign against western Yunnan, and Cen Yuying would be sent to suppress the Miao rebels in neighboring Guizhou.62 These two campaigns would set the course for the remaining career of each man, although neither could have known it at the time.</p>
<p>In April 1866, Cen led five thousand of his best troops out of his base at Qujing, northward toward Zhenxiong, in the notoriously unstable area where the borders of Sichuan, Guizhou, and Yunnan all touch. Over the next several months, Cen crushed the new uprising. He then crossed into Guizhou Province,63 For more than a decade, Miao rebel activity in northwestern Guizhou had been centered around two towns, Zhugongjing and Haimugu. Repeated efforts to take these towns from the rebels had failed.64 Cen perceived the main problem of the past pacification efforts in Guizhou as suffering from there being &ldquo;more than one authority, so that the armies [in the past] did not know whose orders to follow.&ldquo;65 Cen confidently added that &ldquo;by leadThe Struggle to Reclaim Yunnan 175 ing a Yunnan Army [dianjun], I will need less than 120 days wipe out the [rebel] camp.</p>
<p>&ldquo;66 Cen launched his campaign against the Miao strongholds in March 1867, employing a broad array of tactics, including night attacks and ruses, and sometimes motivating his men by joining the fighting.67 One after another, the rebel strongholds fell to his army. In early June, only four days after his self-imposed time limit, he captured the last rebel garrison. Yet he had little time to savor his victories: he received word of Du Wenxiu&rsquo;s victories in western Yunnan and immediately returned to that province.68 THE FINAL SIEGE OF KUNMING While Cen was returning from the wilds of northwestern Guizhou, the situation in Kunming became desperate. By the time the French Mekong expedition arrived in the capital in December 1867, the city was already destitute. &ldquo;The misery is substantial in Kunming,&rdquo; Carné reported. &ldquo;There is a considerable number of beggars dirty and gaunt, dressed, even with the cold, in only a few tatters of felt who wander the streets.&ldquo;69 Du&rsquo;s troops still had not reached Kunming when the French left two weeks later; even so, they had been told that &ldquo;at any moment Kunming could be taken.&ldquo;70 Perhaps Cen Yuying was still nursing his resentment of Ma Rulong, for he made slow progress toward Kunming even though an attack was imminent.71 By July 1867 he was back at his base in Qujing. Six months later he still had not arrived in Kunming, citing the need to protect eastern Yunnan from further violence. Then in early 1868 the Dali armies began to close in on Kunming from all sides. In the north, Dali General Yang Rong took Fumin; in the west, General Liu Cheng drove the Qing defenders onto the plains of Kunming; in the south, a multipronged attack captured Yimen, Kunyang, and Chengjiang.72 In early March 1868 the Dali armies began to close in on Kunming itself, systematically looting and burning every village and small town within a threeto five-mile radius of the capital. By mid-March, Du&rsquo;s commanders had completely surrounded the city. Only one minor road leading east from Kunming allowed intermittent contact between Cen and officials inside the capital. Conditions in the city deteriorated from bad to worse: food was in short supply, diseases were spreading, and Hui were deserting to the Dali army.</p>
<p>In a memorial to the emperor (written from a safe distance-he was presently at the Yunnan-Guizhou border), Governor Liu Yuezhao described the plight of Kunming&rsquo;s defenders: &ldquo;As of right now, the rebels threaten every prefecture and district near and around the capital. The capital itself is already completely besieged, and because we have run out of food and 176 THE STRUGGLE TO RECLAIM YUNNAN pay rations [for the troops].&ldquo;73 The French missionary Fenouil, who was actually residing in the city, wrote to a friend that &ldquo;the war continues to ravage the capital and the area all around it; the plague holds sway, and the famine begins&hellip; [and] the Red Banner [Imperial army] is in retreat while the Muslims make new progress every day.&ldquo;74 At its peak, the Hui controlled more than thirty county and prefectural capitals, including Xundian and Songming to the east of Kunming (see Map 9.1).75 It is estimated that Du Wenxiu had mobilized all eighteen of his generals and was leading between 200,000 to 250,000 soldiers, almost all of whom were involved in the siege of Kunming.76 To make matters worse for Ma Rulong and his imperial allies, Du was succeeding well at convincing Hui officials, so vital to the city&rsquo;s defense, to defect to him. According to Ma&rsquo;s close associate, Ma Futu, Ma had 15,000 troops who were personally loyal to him.77 Yet numerous other sources indicate that many of Ma&rsquo;s Hui leaders were beginning to defect as well as plotting his fall. In mid-March, hoping to inspire mass defections, four of Ma&rsquo;s closest associates devised a plan to assassinate Ma. The plot was foiled at the last moment. Had it succeeded, the city would have been handed over to the rebels.78 Émile Rocher suggests that when this plot came to light more than forty Hui were killed by Ma in a purge of Hui officials whose loyalties were suspect. Ma had the four leaders taken into custody and summarily beheaded. Their heads were displayed along the city walls as a warning to others.79 Reports from these days suggest that the executions did much to soothe the general public&rsquo;s growing angst regarding Ma Rulong&rsquo;s loyalty. Father Fenouil wrote to a colleague that Ma seemed truly loyal to the Qing and was executing those Hui who tried to revolt against him.80 If Fenouil and other residents of Kunming felt more confident about Ma Rulong, the court and other provincial officials did not. They were sure the time had come to try new tactics. Sensing this shift, Cen Yuying made his move to break the siege of Kunming.</p>
<p>FIGHTING AGAINST THE TIDE Strongly motivating the court&rsquo;s search for a new solution at this juncture was the fact that by the end of 1867 neither Yun-Gui governor-general Zhang Kaisong nor Yunnan governor Liu Yuezhao had shown any intention of entering Yunnan. To remedy this, the emperor cashiered Zhang and promoted Liu to governor-general. Cen Yuying was appointed governor.</p>
<p>Cen was already in Yunnan when he received his promotion, which made him the first Yunnan governor to actually be in the province since Xu Zhiming&rsquo;s recall to Beijing five years earlier. The promotion and renewed pres-The Struggle to Reclaim Yunnan 177 sure from the emperor prompted Liu to move into the northeastern corner of Yunnan, but he would not enter Kunming for nearly another eighteen months. Chongshi, an imperial official in Sichuan, wrote a scathing report on Liu&rsquo;s behavior suggesting that &ldquo;after [his] promotion he became arrogant and conceited, making no plans. His memorials exaggerated the situation making it appear far better than it was and saying he had achieved military victories, [when in fact] the provincial capital was under siege and the rebels had the upper hand.&ldquo;81 Cen&rsquo;s promotion and the court&rsquo;s reluctance to push Liu any further indicated a decisive shift in the court&rsquo;s handling of the rebellion. By appointing an individual whose experience was based almost entirely on his military prowess in the far corner of the empire, the imperial court was acknowledging the ineffectiveness of court-appointed officials. If the court was hoping to finally see some results, instead of the inaction that had typified Cen&rsquo;s predecessors, they did not have to wait long.</p>
<p>In March 1868, less than a month after the Dali army encircled Kunming, Cen Yuying launched an ambitious plan to free the provincial capital and central Yunnan. He divided his army-now well over ten thousand stronginto three smaller forces. The first of these marched due east toward Kunming by way of Yanglin and Dabanqiao in order to strengthen the tenuous supply lines to the capital. The second, led by the brightest and most ruthless of Cen&rsquo;s young military officials, Yang Yuke, made a carefully executed sweep to the north, by way of Dongchuan, to the Sichuan border town of Huili. From there, Yang&rsquo;s force would be able to circle back on the Dali troops occupying the strategically important towns of Yuanmou and Dingyuan, to the north of Kunming.82 Cen Yuying led the third prong of the attack along a more southern trajectory toward the capital by way of Chenggong.</p>
<p>83 All three prongs of the attack achieved their objectives with surprising speed. Yang dashed north, winning successive victories at Yuanmou, Wuding, and Luquan.84 On May 18, 1868, his group took the last Huicontrolled town along the vital northern supply route, allowing vital supplies to flow freely to Kunming.85 Cen followed these victories with a strong thrust to the southeast that broke through the Dali lines and opened communication and supply routes to Yiliang and Chenggong to the east.86 On November 19, 1868, Cen took up residence in the governor&rsquo;s yamen in Kunming (his superior, Governor-General Liu Yuezhao, would not enter the capital for another eleven months).87 Not all of these victories were permanent. In the twelve months following the successful campaigns of Yang and Cen, the two sides traded control over half a dozen towns. In January 1869 a French missionary wrote that the two armies &ldquo;take and retake the towns [and] in the meanwhile every178 THE STRUGGLE TO RECLAIM YUNNAN one suffers.&ldquo;88 But by forcing Du Wenxiu&rsquo;s generals to respond to attacks in areas away from Kunming, Cen was weakening Du&rsquo;s massive offensive and permanently breaking the siege of Kunming, which had been the main objective of the rebel forces. As provincial judge Song Tingchun suggested in a memorial to the emperor that spring: &ldquo;At present the main body of the Western rebel&rsquo;s forces are all committed to the attack on the capital. Because their supplies are in short supply and their soldier&rsquo;s pay due, maintaining such a high level of pressure on the capital will be difficult, and for the long term impossible.&ldquo;89 The Dali forces faced other woes besides military ones. With the coming of spring, plague and other diseases began to thin out the ranks and dramatically reduce the rebels&rsquo; fighting readiness. Among the victims was Du Wenxiu&rsquo;s best general, Ma Guochun.90 Simply stated, the Dali forces were beginning to lose a war of attrition against the Qing, who were now bringing their considerable reserves to the field.</p>
<p>THE LAST BATTLES, 1869-1874 The failure of Dali&rsquo;s eastern offensive did not lead to a collapse in popular support or political stature. Over much of the next three years, Du&rsquo;s military commanders retained control of profitable trade routes and mines. Several important cities, such as Chuxiong, Lijiang, and Chengjiang, changed hands no fewer than three times after 1868. That said, in the final years of the rebellion, the Dali forces won few victories and were in almost constant retreat.</p>
<p>By 1869 most of central Yunnan had been cleared of Dali forces. Cen Yuying, Yang Yuke, Ma Rulong, and other imperial generals now slowly began to push west. Yang attacked along a northern course toward Dali, retaking the lucrative salt wells at Baiyanjing and Heiyanjing as well as the district seats of Yuanmou and Dayao. He bypassed Dali, which was heavily defended, and continued north to Langqiong and Dengchuan.91 Cen pushed west along the trunk road between Kunming and Dali, taking Guangtong, Chuxiong, Nan&rsquo;an, Midu, Dingyuan, Lufeng, Xinxing, and Binchuan in the last six months of 1869.92 Ma Rulong drove south into his former sphere of influence, battling not only the rebels but also recalcitrant Han Chinese.</p>
<p>In many respects, these victories were less a reflection of improved military tactics and more a result of the Qing court finally being able to support its officials in Yunnan. Up until 1869, the rebellion had been fought mainly with resources available in the province. There had been minimal outside leadership or, for that matter, interference. Now, however, the court in Beijing was beginning to regain its political and economic equilibrium. More The Struggle to Reclaim Yunnan 179 to the point, the Taiping Rebellion was finally over, so the court could turn its attention to the Panthay Rebellion and begin applying its financial, military, and political resources to ending that conflict.</p>
<p>A telling indication of this shift was the dramatic rise in funds available to the provincial leadership. Between 1862 and 1866, Yunnan had received a total of 134,000 liang in additional court-ordered funds from other provinces.93 In contrast, in 1868 alone the province received 220,000 liang. This rate remained steady until 1872, when it increased to an average of almost 800,000 liang.94 In addition, Cen Yuying implemented a system whereby the payments—mainly from other provinces-were made monthly through those provinces&rsquo; respective trading firms (shanghao) in Chongqing. This system simplified the payment procedure in a single stroke, ensured higher rates of payment, and normalized the schedule for depositing revenues in the provincial coffers.95 Cen&rsquo;s successful campaign against Dali was based on several other critical factors. In particular, he developed a more dependable fighting force. In March 1869 he wrote to the emperor that to attack Dali with the largest possible number of soldiers was not always the most efficient use of the province&rsquo;s fiscal and military resources: &ldquo;The total number of professional soldiers and militia number over 80,000, but they are not competent. I intend to cull out the top 60,000 to use in my attack against the rebels. To do this I must select the 60,000 who are the strongest, not those who are old or weak.&ldquo;96 Cen grouped these soldiers into three armies and sent them on a threepronged attack through southern Yunnan, central Yunnan, and northern Yunnan. He assigned the bulk of his soldiers to the central army and appointed his most trusted and successful officer, Yang Yuke, to lead this force.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the provincial leaders were clearly aware of the dramatic advantages to be gained from applying the latest military tactics and technologies.97 Both sides of the rebellion understood the benefits of European rifles and cannons.98 Governor Lin Hongnian, as early as 1865, memorialized the emperor requesting foreign rifles and for &ldquo;thirty or forty soldiers to come to Yunnan and train the forces here [to fight Dali].&rdquo; &ldquo;99 Du Wenxiu is said to have looked toward Burma for arms. According to Émile Rocher: &ldquo;The Muslims, more experimental than the Chinese in the art of war, have gotten from Burma through caravans a large quantity of firearms&hellip; of all kinds and origins. These arms have for some time been surpassed in Europe, and were sold by the English to the Burmese who in turn sold them to the rebels.&ldquo;100 It seems that Ma Rulong was better supplied than either the imperial forces or the rebels. Louis de Carné recorded that &ldquo;the courts of his palace were full of piles of lances; the corridors, of sacks of balls, buck-shot and 180 THE STRUGGLE TO RECLAIM YUNNAN long-barreled muskets. His armory, which he made us visit afterwards, still more astonished us; for it was well stocked with European arms-doublebarreled guns, breech-loaders, rifled carbines, revolvers, and pistols of all kinds. . . . He maintains, at Shanghai and Canton, agents who supply him with what he wants.&ldquo;101 The last years of the rebellion tended to be fought less along fast-moving fronts, where firearms might have played a major part, than in extended sieges of walled cities. During these sieges, &ldquo;five or six pieces of artillery with several gunners who knew how to use them&rdquo; were employed with some success.</p>
<p>102 Several accounts indicate that Cen borrowed the expertise of several Europeans—including Rocher, who traveled to Yunnan to cast three or four cannons. 103 Yet there is little evidence that this increased firepower gave the imperial forces much of an upper hand. Indeed, most European accounts suggest that cannons were given too little to do too late in the affair. 104 They were sometimes useful when a siege had dragged on for many months, but they were unwieldy and difficult to transport over Yunnan&rsquo;s mountainous terrain; thus they were employed only sparingly.105 At least as important as additional funds and improved firepower was Cen Yuying&rsquo;s effort to win back the hearts of the Yunnanese. As governor, he understood the importance of reestablishing a semblance of security and peace over the retaken areas. He reviewed all previous local appointments, restored those officials he considered reliable, removed those found to be incompetent, and appointed promising young ones. He arranged exemptions from land taxes in districts impoverished by war, disease, and natural disasters. Revenue-producing mines and salt wells were quickly repaired and reopened.</p>
<p>Most revealing of Cen&rsquo;s commitment to reestablish normalcy was that he personally oversaw the provincial civil examinations in Kunming in 1870the first to take place since 1856.106 Military examinations resumed the following year. This tells us he was astute in his assessment of the situation in Yunnan. He understood that if he was going to end the rebellion, he would have to offer the Yunnanese a peaceful alternative to fighting. After sixteen years of rebellion, Cen&rsquo;s strategy of normalization was an attractive one to the Yunnanese, who were tired of the fighting and the suffering.</p>
<p>For Cen the turning point came in 1871, when the imperial troops passed through Yaozhou. In a memorial to the emperor, he wrote: &ldquo;To the east of Yaozhou lies Dingyuan, to its north Dayao, to its south it borders Zhennan. Since 1856, the rebels have occupied [Yaozhou], and imperial soldiers have been unable to defeat them.&rdquo; After the city fell in the spring of 1870, the imperial forces enjoyed a string of rapid victories, capturing cities throughout the province.</p>
<p>The Struggle to Reclaim Yunnan 181 By June 1871, Cen&rsquo;s forces had reoccupied thirty-two cities that had been under Pingnan control. 107 Qing forces now converged on Dali, attacking in quick succession the district seats of Yongping and Yunnan (forty and thirtyfive miles from Dali respectively). The last administrative seat before Dali, Zhaozhou, fell to the Qing in the spring of 1872.108 Now all that lay between them and Du&rsquo;s capital were the upper and lower passes into the Dali Valley.</p>
<p>The Sultan&rsquo;s Last Stand Du Wenxiu had heavily fortified the two narrow defiles at the northern and southern ends of the Dali Valley. 109 Yang Yuke realized that a frontal assault on the passes would be suicide and that a siege would take too much time. So instead, he disguised several of his soldiers as salt merchants and had them enter the city to link up with Han sympathizers as a fifth column.110 He ordered another battalion to approach the southern fort from the rear. This required them to climb down the face of the Cangshan Mountains, which rose sharply from behind the fort.</p>
<p>On June 12, 1872, Yang gave the signal for his forces to advance. At their approach, Han partisans raised a red flag over the inner fort and took it without firing a shot. Two days later, after Yang had reinforced his position, the residents of Dali could see the red flag of the imperial forces flying over the position. The Dali Sultanate, after more than fifteen years of independence, was approaching its end.111 The rebel troops did not give up without a fight. It would take the imperial forces almost six more months of fierce combat to work their way up the plain and assault the heavily defended city of Dali.112 By late December, Qing troops released from other campaigns were streaming into the valley and Du&rsquo;s council was frantically debating how to end the rebellion. Their greatest concern was to prevent Yang Yuke&rsquo;s troops from inflicting retribution on the surrendering populace-something they commonly did.113 On December 25, 1872, Du, surrounded by his top advisers and generals, held his final council. With Dali surrounded by more than ten thousand imperial soldiers, Du&rsquo;s top general, Yang Rong, advised him to surrender. Yang told him that fighting to the bitter end would only bring further hardships on the common people, with little honor to Du Wenxiu. After long deliberation with his council, Du stood up and ended the debate: &ldquo;What you have said is true. If this generalissimo [Du] decides to fight to the death, then truly not even a chicken or dog will be left alive. If this generalissimo leaves the city, then I can save the old and the young. When his council agreed, Du told them: &ldquo;Very well then, tomorrow morning I will leave the city.&ldquo;115 &ldquo;114 182</p>
<hr>
<p>THE STRUGGLE TO RECLAIM YUNNAN FIGURE 9.1. Woodcut of Du Wenxiu&rsquo;s Execution The following morning, as the sun rose over the Cangshan Mountains, Du Wenxiu donned his ceremonial robes, bid farewell to his family and advisers, and entered his yellow sedan chair. His subjects crowded the lanes to pay their last respects to the man who had ruled them for the past eighteen years. As he reached the Southern Gate he stopped and expressed his gratitude for their emotional display of grief.116 Then he swallowed a fatal dose of opium and ordered his sedan chair to take him to the Qing encampment outside the city. When he arrived at Yang Yuke&rsquo;s camp, semiconscious, his last request was to &ldquo;spare the people [shao sharen].&ldquo;117 He was dead by the time he was delivered to the Qing commander. 118 The Struggle to Reclaim Yunnan 183 Not to be deprived the satisfaction of killing him, Yang &ldquo;rushed him out in front of the army and decapitated him. He gathered [Du&rsquo;s] head, his seal, clothing and ceremonial headdress as evidence for [later] corroboration.&ldquo;119 Du&rsquo;s sacrifice was in vain; it did not satisfy the Qing forces&rsquo; desire to destroy the last vestiges of the Pingnan regime (see Figure 9.1).120 Cen Yuying was still thirty miles from Dali when Du surrendered. Now he rushed to the scene of his decapitation. 121 There, instead of launching an all-out attack on Dali, he acted as though Du&rsquo;s sacrifice had quenched the imperial army&rsquo;s desire for revenge. He accepted the surrender of the generals who had escorted Du to Yang Yuke&rsquo;s camp and even offered them Qing offices. He posted notices prohibiting his soldiers from killing or looting for three days. In a seemingly conciliatory gesture, he also &ldquo;ordered all who submitted to shave their heads and deliver their weapons of war.&rdquo; 122 These measures lulled the populace into a false sense of security and allowed the Qing to position their troops for a final attack on Dali. Three days after Du&rsquo;s surrender, Cen invited Du&rsquo;s top generals to a banquet. After they were seated, Cen gave a signal and &ldquo;seventeen heads rolled on the ground.&ldquo;123 The following day the massacre began. It would last three days. 124 The people of Dali fought ferociously until the end. The line between fighting to the death and a final Qing massacre was a thin one. One imperial official would recall that &ldquo;the road&hellip; was ankle deep in blood. . . . Neither man, woman nor child who was Muslim was spared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;125 Cen&rsquo;s own estimate of the numbers slaughtered-a conservative one-was ten thousand.126 Four thousand of the dead were said to have been women, children, and the elderly. Hundreds drowned trying to escape by swimming across Erhai Lake. Others attempted to flee through the narrow passes at either end of the valley. All were chased down and slain by Qing troops. 127 The soldiers were ordered to cut the ears from the dead and deposit them at Yang Yuke&rsquo;s headquarters. In the end there would be more than ten thousand pairs of these grisly trophies, filling twenty-four huge baskets. These, and Du Wenxiu&rsquo;s head, were sent to Beijing as mute proof that the Pingnan regime had been drowned in its own blood. 128 With Du&rsquo;s death and the massacre of thousands of Hui in Dali, the rebellion, for all intents and purposes, was over. The remaining centers of rebel resistance the walled towns of Shunning, Yunzhou, and Tengyue-were all retaken between March and June 1873. The last rebel stronghold— Wusuo, an insignificant outpost southwest of Tengyue-fell to the Qing on May 4, 1874.</p>
<p>Yet for the Hui, the terror did not end even then. After the slaughter, those women and children who had been spared or found still alive were sold off to imperial soldiers and officials to serve as servants or concubines. 129 Other survivors had their land, homes, and other property confi184 THE STRUGGLE TO RECLAIM YUNNAN scated. Those who had lived in Dali were no longer allowed to even enter the city. A European resident of postrebellion Dali suggests that this prohibition did not last: &ldquo;Very soon after this date, the people began to return to the city, and re-established themselves.&ldquo;130 But for the next three decades, a sign forbidding traitorous Hui to enter Dali hung over the city&rsquo;s main gate. In the face of the last Qing suppression campaigns and renewed intolerance for Hui, many Muslim Yunnanese moved into the highland regions of Burma and Thailand. There they established communities that survive to this day as a living legacy of the Panthay Rebellion.131</p>
