CHAPTER I 
1. Many documents describe Hengchun standing on the city wall overseeing the defense of the city. The most important of these are QPHF; Luo Qirui, Yunnan zhanggu, 610; Pourais, La Chine, 78. 
2. QPHF, 5:7a; Pourais, La Chine, 79, 81. 
3. QPHF, 5:7a. 
4. Ibid., 5:8b-9a. 
5. Ibid., 5:7a. 
6. Ibid., 5:8b-9a. 
7. Pourais, La Chine, 78; Luo, Yunnan zhanggu, 610. 
8. QPHF, 3:12a-b. An imperial censor informed the court-incorrectly, it would turn out—that Ma Mingkui, a Hui jinshi degree holder, had been named king; see 3:16a. 
9. Ibid., 3:16b. 
10. Ibid., 3:17a; Wang Jianping, Concord and Conflict, 259. Shuxing'a had more than a decade of experience in a variety of posts in the northwest. 
II. QPHF, 1:11b. Shuxing'a actually suggested that the Hui "make up less than ten or twenty percent of the Han." 
12. Ibid., 6:18b-19a; Rocher, La Province chinoise de Yün-nan, II:36. 13. QPHF, 6:13b. 
14. Zhang Tao, “Dianluan jilue,” 266. This tragic change in meaning is achieved relatively easily since the two phrases differ only with the omission of a tree radical from ge, making it ge-the first character in the gesha wulun order. A leap that could also have been made easily when the commands were transmitted verbally. 
15. QPHF, 5:21b.

36. See Armijo, "Narratives Engendering Survival," 298-99, who compares the attitudes of these new Han immigrants to "white settlers throughout much of the world... [who] felt entitled to the resources of 'their' state, regardless of whether or not 'others' were already in possession of them."

52. As is so often the case, the strongest proponents of this perspective are en- countered in textbooks on Chinese history. See for example Hsü, The Rise of Mod- ern China, 254-55; Fairbank, Reischauer, and Craig, East Asia, 474-75; and espe- cially Wright, The Last Stand of Chinese Conservatism, 113-15. Almost inevitably these accounts invoke Han-Hui competition over dwindling mineral resources as the primary catalyst. 
53. Dillion, China's Muslim Hui Community, 58-59; Israeli, "Islam in the Chi- nese Context," 79-94; Wang Jianping, Concord and Conflict, 249. 
54. For examples of this see Wang Shuhuai, Xiantong Yunnan Huimin shibian, as well as HMQY for Bai Shouyi's collection of documents relating to the rebellion. This fixation is equally apparent in QPHF, an imperially sponsored collection of im- perial documents relating to the rebellion. 
Notes to Chapter 2 
55. The best-known work is Du Wenxiu qiyi by Jing Dexin. 
201 
56. In fact, many works, such as Bai Shouyi's HMQY and the official Qing work, QPHF, lumped them together as Muslim rebellions; this reflected an assump- tion of Muslim unity that transcended ethnic and geographic boundaries. For a ground-breaking look at the Muslim rebellion in Kashgar led by Ya'qub Beg see Kim Hodong, Holy War in China. 
57. One of the key disseminators of the term was Major E.B. Sladen, who trav- eled to Yunnan in 1868. An extract from his writings was presented to the Royal Ge- ographic Society and then printed in Proceedings of the Royal Geographical Society, 357-62.

35. Zhang Yunsui Memorials, in Wu Xingnan, "Qingdai qianqi de Yunnan," 75. 36. XYTG, 52:4b-5a. One sign of the state's increasing efforts to maintain its monopoly was the modification to the certificate system used to verify the taxes paid on salt at customs houses across the province. Originally one certificate could cover the loads on several animals; this proved so difficult to monitor that the policy had to be changed to one certificate per animal.

38. Gervais-Courtellemont, Voyage, 234. Hosie also mentions the difference in the color between the darker Sichuan salt and the lighter Yunnan salt; see "Report," I:66. 
39. Li 1831:4b, in Mueggler, The Age of Wild Ghosts, 173. 
40. XYTG, 50:11b-12a. It is interesting to note that the emperor's rescript or- dered the salt well "to be closed and bandits who privately open the well to be pun- ished so as not to re-establish old practices [of selling salt]." This plan seemed un- likely to succeed since the officials could not even control the salt production and trade when it was open and ostensibly under their control. 
41. XYTG, 50:11b-12a; Wang Song, Daoguang Yunnan zhichao, 115-16; for other instances see XYTG, 50:1a-b. This was likely a perennial problem; British cus- toms inspectors in the early years of the twentieth century also report that "much of the salt was carried out of Yunnan to Laos and the British Shan States." See China, Maritime Customs Decennial Reports (1906), 494, cited in Hill, Merchants and Mi- grants, 44.

43. Li Gui, Yunnan jindai jingjishi, 139; Cui Jingming and Lu Ren, "Yuan, Ming, Qing," 42. A variety of systems existed that dictated the number of days between markets; thus the Tonghai County "7-Jie" markets were held on the seventh, sev- enteenth, and twenty-seventh days of the lunar month, and the yi markets rotated according to the twelve-animal cycle. See Li Gui, Yunnan jindai jinjishi, 137. 
44. Many scholars have asserted that Japan stopped exporting copper to China in the early eighteenth century. In fact, Japan in 1715 did not end its exports, but only reduced them sharply by 40 to 50 percent. See Hall, "Notes on Early Ch'ing Copper Trade with Japan," 427-61. For a more in-depth discussion of the Yunnan's role in the Qing's copper supply see Yan Zhongping, Qingdai Yunnan tongzheng kao, 3-9.

47. XYTG, 44:6b; YHSLD, I:50. It seems that the primary administrative dif- ference between the Yunnan mines and mines in other parts of the empire was that the Hui were a prominent presence in the former, but not the latter. 
48. The Hui were never--at least in Yunnan-broken down by province into smaller work teams. This is likely because few non-Yunnanese Hui came to work as miners. 
49. Hua Li, "Qingdai baojia zhidu jianlun," 96-97. 
50. Yan Zhongping, Qingdai Yunnan tongzheng kao, 27. In theory, the team bosses were under the "mine overseer" (kezhang); in practice, the team bosses re- ported directly to the mine supervisor, although it is possible that at some mines the mine supervisor and the mine overseer were one and the same person.

53. MEP, 539:220. 
54. For a brief overview of the yi (and Yi) see Harrell, Ways of Being Ethnic in Southwest China, 174-75. 
55. The term yi was also employed to categorize non-Chinese peoples as less civ- ilized barbarians. In Yunnan it seems to have been used more to indicate an ethnic Other; however, it retained sinocentric undertones of Han superiority, in the sense that this Other shared a certain degree of barbarian-ness. That the Hui were not part of this oppositional paradigm reflects in part the marginal position the Muslim Yun- nanese held. 
56. My use of the term "non-Han” is not intended to perpetuate this disparag- ing connotation. Rather, because the term was often used indiscriminently to refer to any Yunnan ethnic group, and in order to not overstep my interpretive bound- aries in relation to the historical texts in question, I use the term "non-Han" as the most accurate English translation for ethnic groups identified as yi. 
57. When referring to the Hui, "Muslim Yunnanese" is preferable to "Yunnanese Muslims." The latter overemphasizes the religious element of their identity. As will be discussed later, they are more than simply Muslims who live in Yunnan.

71. Sun, "The Board of Revenue in Nineteenth-Century China," 202; Tacuber and Wang, "Population Reports in the Ch'ing Dynasty," 406; Ho Ping-ti, Studies on the Population of China, 51-52. All three point out the omission, underreported na- ture, and unsatisfactory process of population registration in the nineteenth century. One concrete illustration that the court realized that underreporting was taking place is that in 1819 the emperor called on the Yun-Gui governor-general, Bai Ling, to erect a system by which to clarify the population counts in areas under tusi con- trol; QSXMS, 177. 
72. Yang Xifu, Sizhitang wenji, 6:5a; Anshun fuzhi, 2:1a, cited in Lee, "Food Supply and Population Growth," 727. As Philip Kuhn notes in Soulstealers: "We have no reliable way of gauging the numbers of proportion of displaced persons in the Prosperous Age”—a fact far more true in Yunnan than in the lower Yangtze val- ley, which Kahn was studying.

See Wijeye- wardene, "Thailand and the Tai," in Wijeyewardene, ed., Ethnic Groups across Na- tional Boundaries, 48. Hsieh Shichung suggests that Dai was the suggestion of Tai members from Xishuangbanna, who wanted "to adopt a word with the sound dai."

3. Both Joseph Fletcher and Dru Gladney have described the successive move- ments of Islamic ideas and Muslim peoples into China as "tides.” For an overview of these see Gladney, Muslim Chinese, 36-63.

5. Armijo-Hussein, "Sayyid "Ajall Shams Al-Din," 194. 
6. Rossabi, "The Muslims in the Early Yuan Dynasty," 290. Rossabi's com- ment is not meant to imply that Sayyid 'Ajall's Islamic influence was contrary to the wishes of the central court. In fact, Sayyid 'Ajall remained in near constant contact with the imperial court and Qubilai approved of his policies in Yunnan and, in Ross- abi's words, "did not urge the creation of a Muslim state that might seek indepen- dence from Yuan China." 
7. For a compelling introduction to Sayyid 'Ajall's administration in Yunnan see Armijo-Hussein, "Sayyid 'Ajall Shams Al-Din," chs. IV-V. 
8. It is difficult to arrive at an exact number. The popular belief is that he con- structed twelve mosques; however, Ming-era sources suggest that only two were ac- tually built under his auspices. See Bai Shouyi, "Diannan Conghua," 635. 
9. Sayyid 'Ajall's exalted status continues. Today, every year at the end of Ra- madan, Muslim Yunnanese commemorate his accomplishments by holding special prayers at his tomb several miles outside Kunming. Armijo, "Narratives Engender- ing Survival," 311–12.

In a 1984 essay, Bai Shouyi further clarified this issue by stating that those "who believe that Hui [Huizu] are Muslims, and Muslims are Hui [Huizu] are simply incorrect. . . . We must not say that all those who believe in the Islamic faith are all Hui, this is absolutely un- true." See Bai Shouyi, “Guanyu Huizushi gongzuo de jige yijian," 226.

Within Chinese studies, many scholars have discussed the origins of ethnicity in the Chinese context, but most begin their examination at the turn of the century when Dr. Sun Yat-sen promoted the idea of "five peoples of China" (wuzu gonghe)-- referring to Han, Manchu, Mongolian, Tibetan, and "Muslim" peoples-in order to forward his discussion of Chinese nationalism. Sun's usage of wuzu was almost cer- tainly based on the Japanese term minzoku. The ideograph of zu in the People's Re- public today is inextricably intertwined with the term minzu or "nationality." Here it likely has a less reified meaning, yet it does seem to offer a distinct impression of an awareness that "Hui" are an ethnic category. Only rarely employed in the nine- teenth century, its appearance in Yunnan can perhaps be traced to links between the Pingnan regime and that of the Taipings, who are also recorded as using the term as applied to other ethnicities.

The river boundary was primarily the Yuan River (although in western Yunnan the same term referred to the Lancang River), with jiangwai referring to the areas to the southwest of the rivers. It was also often a shorthand term implying beyond the pale, or non-Han lands.

However, Qingbao noted that aside from many tusi selling their official estates (guanzhuang) to Han settlers, there were also illicit sales by tumu and bashi (native leaders under the tusi), as well as sales by non-Han tenants. From Qingbao's comments (quoted below) it seems that primary land- holding rights in non-Han areas could be sold to Han; what remains unclear is whether Qingbao was fully attentive to land transaction issues pertaining to rents.

2. Ibid., 11. Twelve Hui were killed in the first melee; then, later on, six who were hiding were "ordered executed" by the kezhang, for a total of eighteen. Jing Dexin points out correctly that the actual document distorts the facts slightly by stat- ing in summary that the Hunanese and the Hui "indiscriminately killed each other." From Hunanese admissions, it is obvious that most of the violence was carried out by the Hunanese.

II. The Hunanese team boss, Xia Xiushan, led the attack and was found re- sponsible for the deaths of at least one family. He was ordered put to death by slic- ing and beheading (lingchi). Lu Zhengfa was not found to be directly linked to any deaths; he received one hundred strokes, which would kill any but the strongest man, as well as banishment.

34. Numerous sources refer to this incident but disagree as to where it took place. Li Yuanbing suggests it occurred in Banqiao village while rice was being planted; see Li Yuanbing, "Yongchangfu baoshanxian Han-Hui," in HMQY, I:5. Another account suggests it transpired during the annual temple fair, which was held on stage at the Beiyue Temple. That would link it with the later fighting that occurred during the Five Sacred Mountain God festivities and suggests the territorialism typ- ical of communal feuding.

38. Two years earlier, in 1843, on the occasion of a Buddhist pilgrimage, an at- tack by one Hui on a Buddhist pilgrim was so harmful that the Hui was executed. See Li Yuanbing, "Yongchangfu baoshanxian," in HMQY, I:4. 
39. Ibid., in HMQY, I:3. Although it is not stated, the procession described was likely a symbolic demarcation of religious territory and thus even more contentious to the Hui as it passed in front of their mosque. 
40. Ibid., in HMQY, I:3-4. The symbolic importance of these temples as sym- bols of the Han might be further reinforced by the fact that each of the five temples was burned to the ground by Hui soldiers during the Panthay Rebellion. See Yong- chang fuzhi, 1886, 26:4b.

From the descriptions in extant documents these groups reflect David Own- by's assertion that these hui secret societies "often existed alongside or in between traditional institutions allowing their members to achieve various ends, ranging from mutual aid to criminal entrepreneurship to, on occasion, rebellion."

The petition eventually carried to Beijing by Hui seeking official resolution of the affair, also judged the number of deaths to be eight thousand. Finally, Zhang Mingle in his ac- count of the massacre in Xiantong bianluan jingli ji states that the number of dead "was no few than eight to nine thousand"; in Jing, Du Wenxiu qiyi, 35.

105. A rather ironic punishment, given that Lin himself had served time in the same area; YGZ, 5:9a-11b, 6:23a-b. In his final tally, Lin notes that he executed a total of twenty-six; this indicates that in the following months other leaders must have been caught and brought before him; YGZ, 7:12a-13b. 
106. He Changling, Naian zouyi, 12:5a-b. Such postings were a response to the fact that magistrates from neighboring areas reported several hundred Hui fleeing into their districts. 
107. He Changling, Naian zouyi, 12:6a-7b. 
108. YGZ, 4:8b-9a. Lin specifically bemoaned the fact that suddenly all Hui were claiming to belong to families aggrieved during the massacre; He Changling, Naian zouyi, 30b-31a. Many of the Hui arrested stated they revolted in part to get Hui lands out of Han control.

112. YGZ, 10:22a-b. Although never forced to move, the Hui were not offered other compensation. Whether as a result of Lin's program or local coercion, a local official noted in 1855 that "most of rich land in Baoshan had been Hui, but the Hui had been driven out and the rich lands given over to the Han”; QPHF, 1:2a. 
113. YGZ, 10:22a-b.

78. QPHF, 5:9a-b; XYTG, 81:14b-15a. Rocher mistakenly places Hengchun's death immediately after the Kunming Massacre, and more erroneously, as a reaction to it. Another version has it that Hengchun's wife, humiliated by her husband's in- ability to govern effectively, hanged herself first; then Hengchun, distraught and also humiliated, hanged himself. This same description notes that he died in a room called the "Hengchun Room"-a word play on the Chinese word for "room," ting, and the resting place for a coffin prior to burial, also ting. There is a long history of an- ecdotes about persons dying in conditions linked to their names. For this informal account of Hengchun's death see Luo Qirui, Yunnan zhanggu, 610. 
79. DXG, 9:17a; XYTG, 81:3a, 11a; QPHF, 1:7a; 1:13b. It is interesting that ac- cording to early reports, non-Han were also active in western Yunnan. This memo- rial (dated August 31, 1856) was the first to express concern over the possibility of Hui and non-Han linking together to create even greater disturbances. 
80. DXZ, 9:16b; QPHF, 1:7a; XYTG, 81:11a; Jing Dexin, Du Wenxiu qiyi, 79. As we will see, the Heqing forces never arrived; they were occupied with their own anti-Hui campaigns in northwestern Yunnan. Censor Li Peifu states that only three hundred soldiers were under Wen's personal command in Dali.

83. XYTG, 81:13a; QPHF, 2:8a-9b; 3:6b. There is considerable disagreement over the timing of the siege and surrender. Official Qing sources all agree on the Oc- tober date, but Li Yuzhen suggests it occurred in August; see DSSW, 192. 
84. QPHF, 2:11a. The first memorial containing this information is dated Octo- ber 17, 1856-almost two months after Dali was taken by the Hui forces.

French explorer Louis Carné, who traveled to Kunming in late 1867, suggests that Zheng was involved in killing Muslims and alludes to the widespread organization of the killing: "He [Zheng] resolved, in concert with the Lijiang mandarin and another Chinese leader to organize a mass massacre of the Muslims throughout Yunnan all on the same day." See Carné, "Expedition du Mekong," VIII:658. 
97. For examples of this bias see Li Yuzhen, "Dianshi shuwen," 192-94; DXG, 9:16b-18a; Wang Shulin, "Dianxi Huiluan jilue," 233-34. 
98. QPHF, 2:13b-14a. Obviously, officials spoke of "Hui rebels," but this was usually in the abstract. When the talk was of a specific event or trend, the terminol- ogy employed typically used the regional designation. The divisions also appear in privately funded works on the rebellion.

“in Yunnan, the Han, Hui and yi have been living peacefully together for more than a thousand years." See "Xingshi xiwen" in HMQY, II:131. 
118. One anonymous account asserts that the nominal head of the Menghua Hui, Lan Jinxi—a Hui from Shaanxi-refused after the victory to share with others the goods seized by his group. Du and his close friend Ma Jinbao approached and asked him to share his spoils with the group. An argument ensued that seemingly ended with Lan agreeing. However, the next day, a crowd of people, angry over Lan's behavior, killed Lan and presented his head to Du. If this did indeed happen, it removed a key rival of Du. Yet in the Dali Gazetteer, Lan's name is still listed as a top official. See "Dianxi bianluan xiaoshi," in HMQY, II:89-90. 
119. There are many accounts of this. Besides the sources listed below see "Du Wenxiu Becomes Commander," in Luckert and Li Shujiang, Mythology and Folk- lore of the Hui, 265-68. 
120. The earliest memorial that mentions Du as the head of the rebellion appears on July 21, 1861; see QPHF, 10:26a. Peculiarly, though, the term "Du rebels" is em- ployed much earlier, in late 1857; see ibid., 6:17a. 
121. See "Dianxi bianluan xiaoshi," in HMQY, II:90. Some suggest that Du passed the exam in 1848-highly unlikely, since he had not yet returned from Bei- jing following the Baoshan Massacre (see Tsai Yuanlin, "Confucian Orthodoxy vs. Muslim Resistance," 322). One source even suggests that he was born in 1827 and passed the exam when he was twelve, in 1839. For other sources indicating that Du was a xiucai, see YHSLD, I:121; Alice Wei, "The Moslem Rebellion in Yunnan," 100.

123. Alice Wei, "The Moslem Rebellion of Yunnan," 62; “Dianxi bianluan xiao- shi," in HMQY, II:84. Numerous sources indicate that Du was the son of a Burmese caravan trader. This is repeated by the French explorer Louis de Carné, "Explora- tion du Mékong," 86:658. 
124. Jing Dexin's Du Wenxiu qiyi is typical of this approach.

126. "Jianshui Huimin xiwen," in HMQY, II:55-56. The appeal includes an affirmation of the Hui's historical presence in Yunnan since the Yuan Dynasty, di- rectly refers to Huang Cong's plot, and beseeches the upright Han to quell those Han intent on killing the Hui.

129. There is some confusion over Ma's year of birth. Rocher states that he was born in 1793 while Wang Xuhuai suggests 1794; see YHQS, 115fn4. Zhang Liangji in 1863 mentions Ma was seventy; thus, depending on his birthday, he was born in 1793 or 1794; see QPHF, 12:11b. 
130. Rocher, La Province chinoise, II:46-47. Even if schooled in Chinese until seventeen as Rocher suggests, it seems that Ma Dexin was more comfortable writ- ing in Arabic; almost all his writings were first written in Arabic and then translated by his disciple, Ma Anli. Not until he was forty did he formally began to study Con- fucianism; see Lin Changkuan, "Three Eminent 'Ulama' of Yunnan," 105. 
131. A translation of Ma's Record of a Pilgrimage can be found in Deveria,

132. Ma's Islamic erudition benefited considerably from the eight years he spent in the Middle East, where he collected valuable Islamic texts and had numerous in- tellectual encounters.

CHAPTER 7 
1. DWG, 9:21a; "Dianluan jilue," in YHQS, 199; QPHF, 4:20b. For a de- tailed village-by-village account, see Heng's memorial dated April 28, 1857, in QPHF, 4:22a-25a. Alternatively, some sources suggest that the Dali forces tricked Wen Xiang into believing that his most able commander, He Ziqing, was dealing with the Hui so as to double-cross Wen; this led to He's dismissal. See He Huiqing, "Yunnan Du Wenxiu jianguo shibian shimo," no. 14, 36.

Within the province of Yunnan, the Kunming was known as Yunnanfu, the prefecture surrounding the capital of Kunming was referred to as Yunnan pre- fecture, and, finally, there existed a district near Dali with the name of Yunnan.

13. Some accounts suggest that Ma's original intent was to attack Kunming; de- spite this, it seems quite unlikely. For examples of this confusion see Bai Shouyi, Huizu Renwu (Qingdai), 67-68; He Huiqing, "Yunnan Du Wenxiu jianguo," no. 14, 38. He Huiqing dates the event in 1858-a mistake Wei replicates, having Ma Rulong's first siege of Kunming end in June 1858-and then claims that Zhu Kechang's campaign westward occurred the following year. See Alice Wei, "The Moslem Rebellion in Yunnan," 109-11; QPHF, 9:10a.

18. Rocher goes so far as to say that when Ma Rulong saw the white banner of Du's army, he retired from the city and removed his troops, thus handing the city over to Du. See La Province chinoise, 64. 
19. "Diannan zaji," 265. This is purportedly a firsthand narrative account of the rebellion, so it is unclear whether the author (unknown) inserted the standard anti- Manchu slogan at the end himself or whether this was an actual goal of the agree- ment. A similar account, "Dianhui jiluan," does not include this last sentence. See "Dianhui jiluan," 277. With regard to the division of Yunnan, this quotation- although somewhat ambiguous in English-stipulates clearly that in a local context the spheres of influence of both leaders were to be the halves of the province where their powerbases already existed. For a clear delineation of Du Wenxiu controlling western Yunnan (yixi yidai) and Ma Rulong the eastern and southern regions (yi- dongnan yidai), see "Dianhui jiluan," in YHQS, 275. 
20. As Wellington Chan points out, perhaps one of the clearest indications of Ma's dramatic ascent is the number of Hui leaders who followed him when he sur- rendered to the Qing; see Chan, "Ma Ju-long," 99. Though the assumed goal of such a surrender and their ties with Ma Rulong are later brought under doubt when many of them later defect to Du Wenxiu. 
21. Louis De Carné suggested several years later that Ma Rulong was in fact jeal- ous of Du's stature in 1860. See "Exploration of the Mekong," VIII:652 (April 1, 1870).

42. Pourais, La Chine, 39. The presence of Catholic missionaries did not seem to bother Ma Rulong or Ma Dexin. An amazing test of this tolerance is reported by Pourais, who recounts that when a dozen Hui soldiers asked him what he thought about Muhammad, he replied that "Mohammad is in Hell and all who follow his religion will come to the same end." Although enraged, the Muslims did not harm the missionary. See ibid. The Hui in other areas of China had a long and cordial rela- tionship with Christian missionaries, even assisting some of the early ones, acknowl- edging their mutual belief in God. But as Armijo-Hussein pointed out to me (per- sonal correspondence, February 2004), this did not stop missionaries from later con- centrating their efforts on proselytizing among the Hui. 
43. QPHF, 15:2a; Zhang Tao, "Dianluan jilue," in HMQY, I:269. In an inter- esting aside, Carné suggested that the dominant position of the Hui extended be- yond Kunming into any area where Hui predominated: "the villages are for the most part inhabited by Mussulmans, who although still in subjection to the emperor, spread around them such terror that the frightened Chinese dared not rear their pigs except in secret, and even refused to sell us any."

61. Ibid., 20:2a, 18:16a; Zhang Tao, "Dianluan jilue," in HMQY, I:270. Many sources acknowledged Ma's long hatred of Liang. See Cordier, "Les musulmans, 205; Carné, "Exploration du Mékong," 901. For an account suggesting that Pan had secretly supported Liang in his battles against Ma Rulong, hoping that Liang could defeat Ma, see Zhang Tao, "Dianluan jilue," in HMQY, I:270. By this point Ma had also been granted the title of Lin[an]-Yuan[jiang] Regional Commander, in addition to He[qing]-Li[jiang] Regional Commander; see QPHF, 16:10a-b, 19:9a.

69. QPHF, 20:3b; Rocher, La Province chinoise, II:78-79; QPHF, 20:4a-b. An- other curious side note: in a list of Dali officials Cen Yuying is listed as a counselor, or aide de camp (canmo), but the long annotation next to his name indicates that "during the occupation of the provincial capital by Ma Rong selected Ma Dexin as governor-general. Yunnan Governor Xu Zhiming and Cen listed their names and

affixed their fingerprints alongside as proof of the election." "Du Wenxiu tongshu," in HMQY, II:183. 
70. In an interesting twist, one account claims that Cen Yuying advised Ma Dexin not to take the title of king or emperor because Du Wenxiu would contest; rather he should simply adopt the title of governor-general. Zhang Tao, “Dianluan jilue," HMQY, I:271-72.

82. Wellington Chan suggests a similar explanation: that Ma Rulong's behavior "stemmed from a desire to eliminate all possible rivals, not to ingratiate himself to the court in Peking." However, Ma Rulong's behavior to Ma Dexin was much more one of strong protection, not rapid eradication. Chan, "Ma Ju-long," 103.

86. The terminology of "old" and "new" teachings was a highly referential ter- minology that often depended on the community involved and the latest "new" teachings. However, it was the dominant terminology of the period, and for our purposes reflects the basic divisions. 
87. As Ma Tong suggests, it is important to remember that Islam in China had at least three different communities of thought (Gedimu, Yihewani, and the Han- xue), which should be considered separately from the study of the menhuan orders (such as Jahriyya and Khufiyya). See Ma Tong, Zhongguo.

105. Zhao Qing in "Bianyuan jieyuan lu" notes suggestively that Du was aided by “outsider Hui" (waihui).

Like many of the officials with grandiose ideas on how to end the rebellion, Fu Sheng never entered the province but chose instead to remain in Sichuan near the Yunnan-Sichuan border to file his reports an offense for which he was dismissed on January 24, 1864.

13. I want to thank Zvi Ben-dor for his efforts to help me understand the com- plex dimension of Du's Arabic title. Also for his suggestion that the title appears to be a clever variation of the "Amir al Mu'minin" title used by the first caliph, Abu Bakr, and later Islamic rulers. 
14. Cooper, Travels, 350. 
15. MEP, 541:870 (June 12, 1866). It is unclear what title this might be, as Fe- nouil romanizes this term as "kin tche," which might possibly be the Nanzhao term "ji jia wang."

Few dispute that he was actually in Dali at the time. See Rocher, La Province chinoise, II:81-82; Cen Yuying, Cen xiangqing gong nianpu, 2:5a.

101. DSSW, 217. It may have been known that Yang was a prisoner, as Rocher suggests. Quite suggestive of this line of argument is that the Yaozhou Gazetteer records that Ma Dexin passed through Yaozhou on his way to Dali in January 1864, a month before the putative attack on Du; see Yaozhou Zhi, 1885, 4:24b.

103. Rocher, La Province chinoise du Yün-nan, II:83. 
104. Ibid.; DSSW, 217; DXZ, 9:27a. The one discrepancy is in the Dali Gazet- teer, which states that Ma Dexin and Du did agree to divide Yunnan into spheres of influence; however, it states that Cen Yuying and Ma Rulong "were not informed of this agreement." Such an agreement, if one ever existed, more likely stemmed from the original Chuxiong agreement between Cai Fachun and Ma Rulong.

109. The word mumin here clearly modifies the word "soldiers" in a manner reminiscent of the famous line "Onward, Christian soldiers." Note how this strength- ens the Muslim dimension of Hui identity but also indicates clearly their discrete na- ture with respect to each other.

114. Ibid., 140. 
115. Of course, none of the above negates the fact that most Hui were Muslims. What I am suggesting is that by the nineteenth century, Islam was not the sole defining factor among the Hui. Although Islam never ceased to be a meaningful part of their identity, Yunnan Hui identity was rooted in a broader ethnoreligious spec- trum of identities. 
116. The modern Chinese compound for religion, "zongjiao" is a twentieth- century neologism that was most likely borrowed from Japan and that was prom- ulgated most fervently in the years after the 1911 revolution (see Bodde, Chinese 
236 
NOTES TO CHAPTER 9 
Thought, Society, and Science, 149). Debates between Zhang Binlin, Kang Youwei, and other revolutionaries at the turn of the nineteenth century demonstrate that there was far from a consensus on whether Confucianism was a learning (xue), a way (dao), a religion (jiao), or simply a doctrine (Shimada 1990, 102). This suggests that up to that point there was little tangible idea of religion in the organized and institutionalized form as it exists in the West. In the nineteenth century, jiao was most likely better understood as “teachings” than as “religion." The context in Yun- nan seems quite different-although perhaps not as unique as one might first as- sume, since the term Hanjiao was in common use throughout China, and I have found references in neighboring Guizhou to Miaojiao.

16. Garnier, Voyage d'exploration, 585; Cooper, Travels, 324. The terminology employed by the two French explorers is vague. Garnier is the more precise of the two and distinguishes between Europeans and Malays; Carné speaks of Burmans, Hindoos, and Europeans. Such conjecture might well be dismissed out of hand ex- cept that Cooper describes rumors suggesting these Europeans served "as teachers of the Koran"--hardly a likely activity for most nineteenth-century Europeans.

32. Anderson indicates that by February 19 they had sent letters by messenger describing their purpose and that they had the full support of Panthay leaders in Yunnan. The messengers (those whose clothes were described earlier) returned from Tengyue on March 9 while the mission was still at Ponsee, several days' march north from Bhamô. Thus it is plausible that the messengers had reached Tengyue and that word had reached Du of the British and their intentions. Indeed, Anderson reports that on arrival in Tengyue, the Panthay governor there stated that "the Sultan had been pleased to hear of our intended visit to [Tengyue]."

97. Dali did have its own more traditional armory. Zhao Qing listed six crafts- men (all Han), each of whom specialized in firearms, explosives (gunpowder), rock- ets, fortifications, or seal carving. See Zhao Qing, "Bianyuan jieyuan lu" in HMQY, I:63. 
98. Zhao Qing, "Bianyuan jieyuan lu," in HMQY, 1:63; QPHF, 26:23b; and Carné, Travels, 273 all substantiate this fact. 
99. QPHF, 26:23b. The emperor's rescript was favorable, but several years passed with no action. 
100. Rocher, La Province chinoise, II:110-11. Rocher notes that the guns had diverse origins, including Germany and England, with many of the guns engraved "Fabrique de Châtellerault, 1830." Rocher's comments are substantiated in an in- terview with Yang Fanxiu conducted in 1958; see YHSD, I:111. 
IOI. Carné, Travels, 273. It is curious that Ma Rulong's stockpile was so large. The arrival of the French coincided with his return from the failed westward cam- paign of 1867; one would have expected him to put the guns to use against the surg- ing Pingnan forces.

118. Accounts differ regarding precisely when Du took the poison and what type of poison he used. For an excellent overview see Jing Dexin, Du Wenxiu qiyi, 315-29. Dupuis suggests that he poisoned himself with "sheets of gold"; Dupuis, L'Ouverture du fleuve Rouge, 76. Another popular version is that he swallowed the gall bladder of a peacock; for the complete account see Luckert and Li, Mythology and Folklore, 274-78.

Two of the sons died, one from smallpox and the other from being given the wrong prescription. His two daughters were imprisoned in Kun- ming.

131. These Muslim Yunnanese communities were well documented by Western travelers in the early part of this century, as well as by several anthropological stud- ies in more recent years. These people still perceive themselves as descendents of Yunnan; many residents of Thai and Burmese hilltowns claim descent from "Dali Guo" or the Dali regime.
