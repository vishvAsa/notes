The Moslem rebellion in northwest China, 1862 - 1878: a study of government minority policy by Wen Djang Chu


The great Moslem rebellion in Northwest China in the sixties and seventies of the 19th century has undoubtedly been greatly under- estimated in most history books. Some writers have devoted a short paragraph to this subject; others have dismissed it with one sentence. This is hardly justifiable, because the aforesaid rebellion lasted more than 15 years, spread from Shensi to Sinkiang, covering almost one fourth of China's territory, and directly disturbed the life of more than 10,000,000 people. According to one source:

> The population of Kansu was reduced from 15,000,000 to 1,000, 000,...nine out of every ten Chinese were supposed to have been killed, and two out of every three Mohammedans.... All the villages and farmsteads for miles and miles in all directions were in ruins, and the huge culturable hills were for the most part deserted.'

Other contemporary writers confirmed this tragic story. For instance, Tso Tsung-tang reported in one of his memorials: 

> "With the exception of the 2,000 or more Moslems who fled together with Pai Yen-hu, there are no more than 60,000 of the original 700,000 to 800,000 Shensi Moslems who have survived to be rehabilitated in Kansu." 

Yet strange though it may seem, very few people know much about this great uprising which uprooted the entire social life of Northwest China.
