Mencius said, 

'The trees of the Niu mountain were once beautiful.  
Being situated, however, in the borders of a large State,  
they were hewn down with axes and bills -  
and could they retain their beauty?  
Still through the activity of the vegetative life day and night,  
and the nourishing influence of the rain and dew,  
they were not without buds and sprouts springing forth,  
but then came the cattle and goats and browsed upon them.  
To these things is owing the bare and stripped appearance of the mountain,  
and when people now see it,  
they think it was never finely wooded.  
But is this the nature of the mountain?  

And so also of what properly belongs to man;  
shall it be said that the mind of any man  
was without benevolence and righteousness?  
The way in which a man loses his proper goodness of mind  
is like the way in which the trees are denuded by axes and bills.  
Hewn down day after day,  
can it - the mind - retain its beauty? 

But there is a development of its life day and night,  
and in the calm air of the morning,  
just between night and day, the mind feels in a degree those desires and aversions which are proper to humanity,  
but the feeling is not strong,  
and it is fettered and destroyed by what takes place during the day.  
This fettering taking place again and again,  
the restorative influence of the night is not sufficient to preserve the proper goodness of the mind;  
and when this proves insufficient for that purpose,  
the nature becomes not much different from that of the irrational animals,  
and when people now see it,  
they think that it never had those powers which I assert.  

But does this condition represent the feelings proper to humanity?  
Therefore, if it receive its proper nourishment,  
there is nothing which will not grow.  
If it lose its proper nourishment,  
there is nothing which will not decay away. 

Confucius said, 

> "Hold it fast, and it remains with you.  
> Let it go, and you lose it.  
> Its outgoing and incoming cannot be defined  
> as to time or place." 

It is the mind of which this is said!'
