## Demographic window
The more one looks, it seems the demographic window for chIna adventurism is rather limited -- whether they want to conquer Taiwan or invade India or even, for that matter, Mongolia in a lamaistic frenzy. The emperor has to move in his current term. So one can interpret his pact with the rUs as giving the space for just that. 

## India as pawn
The intention of the mahAmlechCha-led pa~nchanetraka-s is to force H as cannon fodder against the chIna-s. Yet we can see how, as predicted, the gardabhin-s are trying their best to foment trouble in bhArata with 1st responders. How does this square with the hope of using H as cannon fodder against the Han? The conspiracy theory goes thus: if H are left to themselves, they would dictate their own foreign policy -- "I chose when & how to react to the chIna incursions". However, if they are weakened by the pa~nchanetraka-backed 1st responders, it would both embolden the chIna-s to move against H & at the same time, make the H paradoxically more dependent on mahAmlechCha-s for assistance as the old rUs ally seems to have been drawn away by the new alliance with the Han. Thus, rather than fight the chIna-s directly, the mahAmlechCha & their allies would like to engineer a chIna-H clash that would weaken both -- a desired objective in their highly predictive geopolitical framework -- realism. 

These may be things on the agenda of the new praNidhi they have sent masquerading as a dUta. Everything else, widespread anti-H action in the occident, paTTadroha etc entirely as predicted. Now the issue is whether the piNDaka-prabhUta-ShaNDachakra would remain in power among the mahAmlechCha. IMO they have figured out the nAri~Nga, hence he would probably not be able to come back. Moreover, the nAri~Nga-anugAmin+++(=Flordia man)+++ antaryuddha might weaken the hastin allowing the duShTa-gardabhin-s to retain & tighten their control aided by sorAdi- & guggulu-bhejAdi- mahAduShTAH & their new mithyAbuddhi weapons.
