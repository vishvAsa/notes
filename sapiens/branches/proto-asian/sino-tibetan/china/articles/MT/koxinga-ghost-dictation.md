Heard from a Taiwanese gentleman that he took a ghost dictation from Sino-Japanese hero Koxinga (國姓爺 -- what complicated set of characters for the non-chIna!). It had a profound religious effect on him, and he gave up alcohol and straightened his life (private). He mentioned that Koxinga's ghost sometimes possesses people in Taiwan and speaks through them like kabandha AtharvaNa. For others, he appears in dreams. He rolled the dictation into a locket and keeps it as an amulet.

Translation of part of Koxinga's ghost dictation:

> "Do you take your ease while your ancestors bled for this land?  
The blood that watered the fields has not yet dried,  
> and yet your spirit has grown soft like untempered metal.  
I, Zheng Chenggong, stand not in incense alone but in righteous vigilance.  
> The heart that falters in service to family, to nation, and to honor is a heart already half lost to ruin.
>
> Each day wasted in idleness is a theft from your forebears.  
Each task left undone dishonors your name.
>
> Wake from your torpor. Straighten your back.  
> Let your breath be steady like a drawn bow,  
> and your mind unshaken like the southern mountains.  
I do not descend to speak lightly. My words are flame — meant to burn the weeds of neglect.
>
> If you forget your vows, the heavens will forget you.  
> If you walk the path of effort, though narrow, I will stand behind you.
>
> This is not a warning. It is a command."
>
> — Dictated by the Spirit of Guóxìngyé on an Auspicious Day
