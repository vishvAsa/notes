The return of Wuhan to the motherland has animated little Galtons galore to carry a bit of water for the emperor. But their strategy does raise a number of possibilities. 

First, it does seem like they were either on the brink of a serious rebellion or an economic blizzard to let go of their earlier restrictions all of a sudden. This makes sense in light of their attempt at a landgrab in India -- a classic move to direct attention outwards. Then the legalist inner circle of the emperor perhaps thought that it is best to let disease run through for that would be the best way to distract from the possibility of a rebellion and automatically cause the people to panic about other things & increase their dependency on the rulers.
