## Settlement
- historical records suggest that the present-day Naga people settled before the arrival of the Ahoms in 1228 CE.
- British established their control in late 1800s.  Missionaries came and converted most to Christianity.
- After 1947, a secessionist movement began. In 1955, Indian army was called in. In 1957, the Naga Hills region of Assam and the Tuensang frontier division were made a union territory; in 1963 a state. NSCN factions continued their fight long after; with much factional in-fighting.
- Mainland Indians are allowed in Dimapur - the commercial capital without restriction. Nagaland's 8% Hindus are concentrated there.
