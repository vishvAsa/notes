After the creation of elementary contents of the earth one by one, Tengbangba Mapu ordered Atingkok to spread his uncontrollable power. Atingkok, thus, uttered the word 'HungShet', exploded himself and immersed into every layer of both heaven and earth. In this way, Atingkok, the eldest son of Tengbangba Mapu, spread everywhere and therefore, came to be known as Sanamahi (Sanna means spread or exist everywhere and boundless; Mahi- his hi meaning his boundless supernatural power). As his power is the greatest and the ultimate, Atingkok came to be known as Mahirel (greatest power).

Tengbanba Mapu then, arranged a test to examine the ability of his sons, ordered them to circulate the universe seven times and declared that the one who would reach first would be crowned as the king. Sanamahi and Atiya Sidabaset off for their journey while Konjil Tingthokpa, the youngest son, circumambulated the throne seven times as his mother advised him that it was similar to the journey set off by his other brothers. Here, the seat of the Supreme Lord or Tengbangba Mapuis compared to the whole universe. The youngest son, thus, became the King and gained the title Pakhangba (pa means father, khangba means he who knows the father). 

The two sons who went had also come back. Sanamahi became furious on seeing Pakhangba on the throne and thought of destroying the earth that he had himself created. Tengbangba Mapu and Leimarel Sidabi consoled Sanamahi. Tengbangba Mapu declared that Sanamahi would be the King of Gods, the Lord of heaven and earth, king of every household when human inhabitation would begin; he made him realized that Sanamahi was the Supreme Lord himself: 

> "I myself is you, and you are me, there is no greater God than you. Unfold the human beings early in the morning and embrace them early at night. You arrange all the life cycle events. May the one who worship you, achieve me happily. My eldest son, you are my soul". 

The Supreme mother or Leimarel Sidabi also promised to stay with him and to take care of him. The Supreme Lord or Tengbangba Mapu asked his youngest son, Pakhangba to be the ruling King in every human epoch and asked his second son, AtiyaSidaba to be with him in heaven.

All I need to know about Meiteis/Sanamahists and their Hinduness is in this fascinating story of how Sanamahi circumbulated the world as the elder son while his younger brother bested him by circumbulating his parents.

Also read elsewhere that Sanamahi comes from Sanna (to spread/diffuse) and Mahi (liquid)—Reminds one of ‘Skanda’ whose etymology comes from a very similar context.
