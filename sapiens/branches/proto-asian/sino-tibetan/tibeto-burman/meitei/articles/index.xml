      <description>&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&#34;https://x.com/shardula23/status/1946892896675696861&#34;&gt;TW&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Their king had imposed Ramanandism on some of the officials due to his own political reasons and buried some deities of rival clans in one grove and established a Hanuman there, all the while promoting his own clan local deities. The Meiteis don&amp;rsquo;t even follow Ramanandism now. They follow Caitanya Vaishnavism promoted by the earlier king&amp;rsquo;s descendent(Bhagyachandra) and largely peacefully accepted by the local people.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Rather it was a Meitei v/s Meitei clan issue that is now blamed on Hindu Brahmins and tales of the Ramanandi mahant Shantidas etc. which have no evidence other than internally contradictory folklore.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;After the creation of elementary contents of the earth one by one, Tengbangba Mapu ordered Atingkok to spread his uncontrollable power. Atingkok, thus, uttered the word &amp;lsquo;HungShet&amp;rsquo;, exploded himself and immersed into every layer of both heaven and earth. In this way, Atingkok, the eldest son of Tengbangba Mapu, spread everywhere and therefore, came to be known as Sanamahi (Sanna means spread or exist everywhere and boundless; Mahi- his hi meaning his boundless supernatural power). As his power is the greatest and the ultimate, Atingkok came to be known as Mahirel (greatest power).&lt;/p&gt;</description>
