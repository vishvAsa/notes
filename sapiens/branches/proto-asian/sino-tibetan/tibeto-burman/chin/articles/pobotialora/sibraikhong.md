Sibraikhong is the highest mountain peak of Tripura. Sibrai is the highest deity in the Reang pantheon and is equated with Shiva.

In 1997, fanatic Mizos destroyed the Shiva temple and put crosses on the hill. Then they renamed the peak to Thaidawr Tlang. Vishwa Hindu Parishad has attempted to aid the local Hindus in rebuilding the Shiva temple but fanatical Mizos oppose it.

Jampui Hills has become Christian majority because of illegal immigration of Chins from Myanmar after ethnic cleansing of native Reang Hindus from the area.Furthermore, the Mizos from Mizoram insist that the area is part of Mizoram after doing a demographic change.

Bethling Shiv has been renamed to Betlingchhip in an attempt to rewrite the history of the area. British records clearly show the previous name of the place. "The Imperial Gazetteer of India Volume 4" - William Winson Hunter
