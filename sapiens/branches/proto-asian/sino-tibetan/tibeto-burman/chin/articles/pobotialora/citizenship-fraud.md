The states that border Myanmar may see their populations drop by as much as 50% if an NRC is done. 

The numbers of Nagaland are so exaggerated, it's laughable.You have tribals overreporting their numbers or illegal immigration from Myanmar in the last 4 decades or so. Tribes growing by 25X in 2 decades lol. This is higher than even wartorn nations like Somalia and Afghanistan.
