      <description>&lt;p&gt;Author: TI on twitter&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;ethnogenesis&#34;&gt;Ethnogenesis&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, there was no common &amp;ldquo;Mizo identity&amp;rdquo; among these tribes and they were warring with each other. Abducting each other and head hunting was the norm. Infact, the earliest known picture of any Mizo was that of a Lushai woman captured by a Southern tribe called Mara. When the Mizo tribes first encountered the Hindus of Assam,their feeling was of admiration. An early Mizo Christian Newspaper warned &amp;ldquo;Hindu customs,especially Assamese customs, are something the Mizo really appreciate. Mizos even say &amp;ldquo;If only we were born as Vai(plain Hindus)&amp;rdquo;. The missionaries sensed the danger of Mizos adopting Hindu culture and immediately sprung into action.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
