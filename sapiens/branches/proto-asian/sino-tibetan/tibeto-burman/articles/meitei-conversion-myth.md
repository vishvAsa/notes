> They had their own tradition.  
They had their own gods.  
> Then their king became Hindu.  
And forced others to convert.  
And burned books.  
And changed script.  
And banned beef.  
Thatâ€™s how Meitei became Hindu.  
He was Pamheiba.  
Later Gharib Nawaz.

No, you donkey. That's just an urban myth propagated by missionaries.

His father, Meidingu Charairongba was follower of the Nimbarka school while Meidingu Pamheiba converted to Ramanandi school. Meities follow Gaudiya Vaishnavism because of Meidingu Chingtnagkhomba.

Ramanandi school is centred around Rama, not Krishna who is prevalent in Manipur today. The traditional gods are still worshipped even by the Brahmins today, so that claim of traditional pantheon being attacked is mute. But you know who doesn't worship them? Christians.

The claim about the script is also another missionary myth. The ban was introduced by the British backed by Christian missionaries in colonial era. 

Puya mei thaba is also exaggerated. Wahengbam Ibohal Singh's analysis shows that only parts containing Shakta rituals were removed.
