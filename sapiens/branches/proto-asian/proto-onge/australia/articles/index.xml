Reasons for infanticide varied:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The children were twins - &amp;ldquo;two heads&amp;rdquo; being thought unnatural (Bates, 1944)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The birth caused the mother significant pain or trouble (Roth, 1907)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The mother was unmarried (Leichhardt, 1842-1844)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The child was believed to not be the husband&amp;rsquo;s child (Morgan &amp;amp; Buckley, 1852)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The mother had children too close together - within 12 months of previous birth (Morgan &amp;amp; Buckley, 1852)&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&#34;https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1821717979094249745.html&#34;&gt;TW&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;biological-knowledge&#34;&gt;Biological knowledge&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Many Australian tribes thought babies resulted from reincarnation rather than sex. One tribe described how a tiny spirit would meet a woman, throw a small club at a her big toe and enter her body through the wound. (Mathews, 1900)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Merlan (1986) says some tribes understood physical paternity but that others apparently didn&amp;rsquo;t. Rather than pregnancy, sex was associated with pleasure, rituals and punishment. It was also seen as the cause of female puberty and menstrual periods.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Interpersonal and intertribal conflict was common in Australia. In a study of crania from southeast Australia, 58% of the females and 37% of the males had fractures, the majority of which were severely traumatic. Arm fractures were also common (from parrying blows)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Women in southeast Australia were often victims of warfare and domestic violence. They also sometimes engaged in ritualized conflict to settle disagreements. (Excerpt from Edward Eyre, 1847) More accounts of domestic violence. But Australian women were not always passive victims. They also participated in group fights and duels with other women&lt;/p&gt;</description>
