Interpersonal and intertribal conflict was common in Australia. In a study of crania from southeast Australia, 58% of the females and 37% of the males had fractures, the majority of which were severely traumatic. Arm fractures were also common (from parrying blows) 

Women in southeast Australia were often victims of warfare and domestic violence. They also sometimes engaged in ritualized conflict to settle disagreements. (Excerpt from Edward Eyre, 1847) More accounts of domestic violence. But Australian women were not always passive victims. They also participated in group fights and duels with other women
