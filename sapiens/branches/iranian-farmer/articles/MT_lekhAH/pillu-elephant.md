Little evidence a Pr-Dr word for elephant even existed, leave alone the claim made therein. It is even less valid than Sethna's karpasa in Harappan making it Skt.

Among other things no Pr-Dr reconstruction would accommodate a pillu or related form for pal+V. It likely comes from a "Nostratic"-like earlier layer with cognates in Uralic, Afroasiatic, Chuchi-Kamchatkan for bite.
