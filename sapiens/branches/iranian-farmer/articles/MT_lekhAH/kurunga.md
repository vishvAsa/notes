> On a separate note, one “Kuruṅga” occurs as the name of a Turvāsava prince in the Rgveda. In light of Paurāņika memory of Turvāsu-s/Turvāsava settling to southeast of Madhyadeśa i.e. Near Rewa, MP & given the historic tribal presence in MP & JH, one may be tempted to infer that Ārya clans like the Turvāsu had perhaps mixed with the local non-Ārya population as they expanded from Madhyadeśa. 

The origin of kuru~Nga is not as trivial as modern linguists think it to be. Different hypotheses connect it to words like kora~Ngu (monkey) from Dr or an Austrasiatic word for antelope/deer or a tribal ethnonym name (kuruMga community -- an "AASI" enriched caste in Odisha). 

yAska etymologizes it as kurun+ga = a king who went against the kuru-s. It appears in the maitrAyaNIya as kula~Nga and taittirIya as kulu~Nga. Hence, my own suspicion is that it is an old loan word that entered IA before contact with Dr or AA.
