Literature is the soul of a civilization, if we don't have it, we have nothing to relate to. No stories and no heroes to feel connected to. This is the case with Harappans/Indus Valley for me.

Genetically we are like Harappans with one Arya grandparent. However, our entire culture & religion draws inspiration from the latter's for a firm foundation. Hence, much more important than ancestry is the sense of self-identity.

There really is more for a Hindu to connect to in Ancient Greece than there is in Harappa! Isn't this crazy! But it's totally true.
