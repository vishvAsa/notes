      <description>&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&#34;https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2008/08/03/a-kambhoja-khmer-pashupata-inscription-from-the-reign-of-king-bhava-varman/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A Sanskrit inscription from the Phnom Prah Vihar hillock in Cambodia, copied by the French researcher Coedes (IC. 3), provides a further illustration of the point discussed our earlier note on the link between nyAya-vaisheShika and the pAshupata-s. It also underscores the point of how the pAshupata-s appear to have dispersed these philosophical systems widely over Asia. The inscription is associated with king bhava-varman of Kambhoja.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A large number of inscriptions appear to be of the king bhava-varman-I who founded a new Kambhoja kingdom by annexing Funan and Vietnam to his Cambodian base. This would place it around 590 CE when he was at his peak. There was a second bhava-varman, his successor 3rd in line (in the earlier half of 600s of CE). But the lack of mention of bhava-varman-II’s father ishAna-varman makes it likely that the king of this inscription was bhava-varman-I the founder of the dynasty. The inscription is in the AryA Chandas and refers to a pAshupata AchArya vidyApuShpa. The extant of the surviving portion of the inscription is 9 verses and is broken towards the end. I just provide a few excerpts.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
