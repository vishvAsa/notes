## hiraNyaruchi
A Khmer inscription of a shaiva scholar hiraNyaruchi's deeds:

hiraṇyarucinā tena pure rudramahā[laye] |  
sthāpitaṃ vidhinā liṅgaṃ śrī-bhadreśvara-saṃjñakam ||  
sa pinākipade śreṣṭhapure rudramahālaye |  
rudrāśrama-tribhuvanasthāna+iśānapurādiṣu ||  
liṅgāny arccāś śivādīnāṃ nyadhāl liṅgapurādiṣu |  
śrāṇāśraya ca śraminām āśramaṃ pustakāśramam ||

"By that Hiraṇyaruci, in the city Rudramahālaya, a liṅga was established according to ritual, known as Śrī-Bhadreśvara. He [established liṅgas] in Piṇākipada, at Śreṣṭhapura, at Rudramahālaya, at Rudrāśrama, Tribhuvanasthāna, Īśānapura and other places liṅgas and images of Śiva and others. He established iat Liṅgapura and other places, a center to distribute cooked food, a rest house for the weary and a library (pustakāśrama)"

pustakāśrama: is an interesting word for library.

At Prasat Khna we have another fragmentary inscription of hirNayaruchi:

hiraṇyarucinā te[na] (...) kṛto .ayaṃ pustakāśramaḥ ||
adhyāpakādhyetṛ-hitaiḥ

It clarifies the library was established for the benefit of teachers and students alike.

Such H libraries from Khmer have been entirely lost.

...This believed by some to be a shrANAshraya (place for distributing cooked food and/or a śraminām āśramaṃ (rest house) similar to that mentioned by hiraNyaruchi in his inscription. This one is however from the Preah Khan temple complex of the Khmers.



## Ban That
Ban That inscription from Laos giving a vivid account of a mantra-shAstra school with its students studying and debating Agamika texts:

vidyāpavarga-vihitāpaciti-prabandhe  
yasyāśrame .anavaratāhuti-dhūma-gandhe |  
durgāgameṣu mati-bheda-kṛtārthanītyā  
vidyārthināṃ vivadatāṃ dhvanir utsasarpa ||

Above his āśrama, where acts of honor were constantly performed at the conclusion of studies, which was fragrant from the smoke of uninterrupted oblations, the sound of students debating over difficult āgama-s as per the interpretations from differences in opinion of the various schools rose up.

## shaiva initiation
The image of a procession of shaiva (=pAshupata?) ascetics carrying their guru from Angkor Wat. It is believed by some to be a portrait of none other than the rAjaguru divAkara-paNDita, also called the hotR^i of kingdom. He performed the rAjyAbhiSheka of three Khmer monarchs, none of whom were shaiva-s. Two were bauddha-s following their yoginI-tantra-s, and the builder of Angkor was a vaiShNava. It illustrates the general sarvAdhikArin principle in H tradition.
