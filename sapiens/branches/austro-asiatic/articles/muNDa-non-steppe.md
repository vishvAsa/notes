there is R1a penetration among tribals. the great exception here are todas. 

look at munda. almost no steppe or r1a. dravidian tribals have both to some extent. 

The munda are a counter-culture to the aryan-steppe patrlineage conquest system. They either resisted successfully or were exterminated. read their myths. They're alien to India. the irony of calling them indigenous is they are profoundly other. 100% austroasiatic men, probably from the kra isthmus. Evidence they used to occupy lowlands, driven up.

Genetics tells us that they mixed with conventional ASI, but they also clearly absorbed totally unmixed AASI in large dollops (moorjani told me she thinks unmixed AASI probably persisted in northeastern India until 2,000 years ago).
