      <description>&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&#34;https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1592124116748103681.html&#34;&gt;TW&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Basque language has always been surrounded by mystery with regards to its origin. Today, there has been a massive breakthrough on its history and origin ðŸ§µ.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One of the many reasons for the origins of Basque being so uncertain is that throughout its existence it has traditionally always been a language that has been passed on through generations by tongue rather than through text. This means that there are very few if any written records of old Basque, which makes it a very difficult language to trace back in time. &lt;del&gt;Until now the first written account of Basque was published in 1545 (!) as a book titled &amp;ldquo;Linguae Vasconum Primitiae&amp;rdquo; by Bernard Etxepare.&lt;/del&gt; There&amp;rsquo;s Basque writing found in Glosas Emilianenses (9-10th CE. AD) so 1545 is not the earliest, but still nowhere near 1st Century BC. There are many accounts of the existence of Basque prior to 1545, of course; mainly found in the etymology of names of towns and cities within the influence area that Basque once occupied, which stretched from Santander to Bordeaux and from the Bay of Biscay to Andorra.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
