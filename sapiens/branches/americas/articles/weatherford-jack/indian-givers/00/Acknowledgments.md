The writing of this book involved the assistance of manY colleagues and friends to whom I am grateful. My family contributed to my work on this project by helping me in the field when possible and by covering for me while I was gone. I thank my wife, Walker Pearce, for her help in Asia and Europe, and I must credit her as being the person who insisted steadily for twelve years that I should write this book. I thank Roy Pearce Maybank for his work with me in South America and Minnesota, and I appreciate the help of Walker Pearce Maybank in central America.

Much of the travel and many of the contacts for this project came through the assistance of the W. K. Kellogg Foundation, where I particularly thank Larraine Matusak, Patrick McDonough, Anna Sheppard, and the members of class V of the Kellogg National Fellowship Program.

I thank the administration of Macalester College for giving me the opportunity to work on this book, and funding from the Bush FoundatiQn and the Joyce Foundation.
