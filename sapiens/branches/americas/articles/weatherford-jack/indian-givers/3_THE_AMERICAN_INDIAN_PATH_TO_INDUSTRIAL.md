title = "3 THE AMERICAN INDIAN PATH TO INDUSTRIALIZATION"

+++





The German village of Kahl lies where the small Kahl River flows into the Main River at the northern border of Bavaria with Hesse. If you stroll along the smaller river, you pass through a bucolic setting reminiscent of the era of the Grimm brothers, who collected their fairy tales in this area nearly two hundred years ago. The little river meanders across a meadow, past the garden plots of the villagers, around the old mill, and past a few half-timbered farmhouses and barns from which cows and goats amble down to the water's edge for an occasional drink.

Children going to and from school cross the river on a small footbridge, often stopping to play or throw stones into the shallow water below them.

If you choose to stroll along the Main River, however, you will see the other face of Kahl. Large barges chug up and down the river; trucks noisily enter and leave a fenced compound on the edge of the river; workers clear some tracts along the river to build monotonous rows of worker housing. And just on the edge of town by the river looms Germany's first atomic-powered electric plant, which opened in June 1961. By the standards of modern atomic power plants with their giant cooling towers and large containment domes, the Kahl plant seems almost a miniature; yet by the standards of the village church and thatch barns, it is monstrous in size and form.

People have lived in Kahl since about 1000 B.C., and for thousands of years before that nomadic groups of hunters made occasional encampments in the area, apparently having found the two rivers a good place to find game. The length of the encampments grew longer, and in due time the hunters established a permanent village and gradually changed from hunting to farming as the main source of their subsistence.

Different Germanic tribes such as the Chatten, Franks, Alemannii, and Burgundians invaded and took over the site, sometimes through peaceful intermarriage and sometimes by violent conquest and eradication of the former inhabitants. The Romans came and went, and ownership of the village passed through a long succession of emperors, kings, counts, archbishops, and princes. In more modern times the village fell prey to the French, the Swedish, the English, the Austrians, the Hessians, and finally the Bavarians, who still control it today.

Despite all this coming and going, the way of life of the villagers changed very little for thousands of years. Once the neolithic hunters settled down to farm crops, life took on a fairly consistent form. The daily routine for the villagers during the Roman times differed little from life under the Holy Roman emperors or the archbishop of Mainz. The peasants grew their crops, paid their taxes to their lords clerical and secular, and sent their sons to fight in the wars of both lords. The names of the rulers changed from century to century, but little else did. Great intellectual movements passed them by, and even the great religious changes of the world had minimal impact on their lives. The ancient peasant worshiping the pantheon of Germanic gods such as Thor and Donner differed very little in life-style from the later peasant worshiping the Roman pantheon of gods such as Jupiter and Mercury or the calendar of Christian saints such as the Virgin Mary and St. Peter.

Farm life in Kahl remained much the same regardless of whether the village was inhabited by the Celts, the Chatten, the Romans, or the Franks. A peasant would probably have felt equally at home farming in the Kahl of 700 B.C. or A.D .1700. In this time the basic subsistence pattern of agriculture-the crops grown, the animals used, and the tools for growing and processing them remained basically unaltered. The houses of the peasants from the two eras differed little, the peasants moved around by the same modes of transportation, and they ate roughly the same meals.

Suddenly in the last few centuries, life changed radically after millennia of great technological stability. The peasants stopped working in the fields and started to work in factories. They illuminated their houses and other buildings with electricity, and they replaced their horses with bicycles, tractors, and trucks.

They altered their diet, and the way they built their homes and educated their children. Within a few generations, virtually every aspect of life changed.

After thousands of years of agricultural life, this sudden leap into the industrialized world seems difficult to explain. Why had the Greeks, with so much mathematical and philosophical learning and such outstanding architectural techniques, not been able to make and use machines? Why were the Romans, with all of their technical and practical knowledge of engineering and their vast array of engines of war, not industrialized? Why could the people of the Renaissance, who demonstrated their mechanical wizardry by making elaborate toys, not make the leap into machine production? What happened to the world in the 1700s and 1800s to make it industrialize after thousands of static years of technological stability?

If we look back over the last few thousand years of the history of Kahl and some of the surrounding communities, we see a clear historic pattern. The rapid sequence of changes which culminated in the building of an atomic power plant began at the end of the eighteenth century with the widespread introduction of New World crops. The American Indian potato provoked the first radical change in the diet of the people and of some of their animals. But the potato precipitated disastrous changes to the economy of Kahl.

Because Kahl was surrounded by so much water, the village had been a major milling site in the area for many centuries.

Peasants from surrounding villages brought their various grains to be milled into flour and to be pressed for making oil. With the introduction of the potato, however, the demand for the mill services of KahI declined precipitously. People ate more potatoes and milled less flour. Kahl entered a period of economic decline and physical deterioration as the mills decayed from neglect.

Early in the nineteenth century, after Kahl recovered from the disasters of the Napoleonic conquests, imaginative entrepreneurs discovered new uses for the mills of Kahl. The mills offered a great source of energy, and this energy could be applied to other purposes than the mere grinding of grains or pressing of oils; the energy could be harnessed to power looms to make cloth.

Gradually the mills throughout the area were converted into small factories producing textiles, matches, electrical fuses, and felt, and eventually they were renovated to produce electricity, felt-making machines, and more complex electrical equipment.

Finally there was a nuclear power plant, financed by the Versuchsatomkraftwerk Kahl GmbH. In a little more than a century the wooden waterwheel had been replaced by the nuclear reactor.

All of this began with the adoption of the potato, but obviously the process involved many more factors than the mere potato, since the Peruvians have had potatoes for thousands of years but still do not have atomic energy.

Around the time the potato arrived in Europe, a cornucopia of other New World crops and products also poured in. The potato freed the mills but gave them nothing new to process. Into this vacuum poured one of the inedible American products-cotton.

Some Old World types of cotton had been grown in India and the Near East for centuries, but only very small quantities of it ever reached Europe. This cotton was not only expensive, but weak and difficult to weave because of its short strands. Asiatic cottons, Gossypium herbaceum and G. orboreum, had a strand length of only about half an inch, but American upland cotton, G. hirsutum, usually grew to a full inch or more.

Meanwhile, G. barbodense, the tropical American cotton that became best known as Sea Island cotton \(from the plantations that grew it on the coast of South Carolina and Georgia\), could grow to two and a half inches. In Europe the short strands of the Old World cotton served primarily for padding jerkins under the coats of mail worn in battle. In time the uses of cotton expanded to the making of fustian, which was a coarse material built on a warp of stronger flax and a woof of Old World cotton. Not until American cotton arrived in England, however, did the phrase "cotton cloth" appear in English; the Oxford English Dictionary's earliest date for it is 1552.

The long-strand cotton of the American Indians so surpassed in quality the puny cotton of the Old World that the Spaniards mistook American Indian cloth for silk and interpreted its abundance as yet further proof that these new lands lay close to China.

For thousands of years before the European conquest of America the Indians had been using this carefully developed cotton to weave some of the finest textiles in the world. Many remnants of these early cloths survive to the present day, their colors and designs intact, after several thousand years in the desert burials of Peru, Bolivia, and Chile.

Traditionally, Europeans wore wools supplemented by leather. They wove everything, from their underwear to their hats, from wool. Only the very rich could afford luxury fabrics such as silk or linen. But the quantity of wool was determined by the number of sheep, and this was determined by the amount of grazing space.

Using only sheep to produce cloth ensures a slow and inefficient system that consumes a large parcel of land to clothe each person and limits the amount of clothing available.

As long as Europe depended primarily on wool for clothing, peasants could spin it and weave it with simple home technology.

The bottleneck in cloth manufacture was the amount of wool that the land was capable of producing, not the ability of the weavers to make cloth. Since the number of sheep determined the amount of wool for weaving, peasants lacked incentives to develop machines or more efficient ways to make clothing.

This situation changed with the massive influx of cotton from America. Suddenly, the peasants and the weavers had more fiber than they could weave. They lacked the labor to process so much fiber. Europe desperately needed more energy than it had in human and animal power, and the most readily available source for creating new energy lay in the waterwheels already in place throughout the continent. Thus were born the first textile factories.

Cotton production far surpassed the production of wool and other fibers, but several steps in the manufacture of cloth slowed the process. After the cotton bolls were picked from the plant, the seeds had to be removed to free the cotton. This work proceeded at a slow and laborious pace, requiring more time than the actual picking of the cotton. Thus the slaves picking cotton spent more time picking cotton seed out of the bolls than picking the cotton from the plant. This problem was solved, however, when Eli Whitney \(1765-1825\) of Westborough, Massachusetts, invented a mechanical gin to do this task in 1793. The invention of this twenty-eight-year-old teacher allowed one worker to separate up to fifty pounds of cotton per day.

This one contraption did not produce the whole revolution in production. The change depended on nearly simultaneous developments that increased the rate at which thread could be spun from the cotton and the rate at which the thread could be woven into cloth. Together, the mechanization of ginning, spinning, and weaving the cotton launched the industrial revolution.

American cotton output increased from only three thousand bales in 1790, just before the invention of the cotton gin and the mechanization of the spinning and weaving process, to 4.5 million bales in 1860, on the eve of the American Civil War. In the decades just before that war, cotton alone accounted for the major part of exports from the United States, and it went primarily to the textile mills of England \(Wolf, pp .279-80\]. This demand for so much cotton greatly increased the demand for appropriate land and thus pushed the southern planters out of the Carolinas and Georgia and all the way across to Texas within a few short years.

In the process the United States annihilated or scattered the Choctaw, Chickasaw, Creek, and Cherokee nations as well as most of the Seminole and some smaller nations.

After the invention of the cotton gin, manufactured cotton cloth became an item that even common people could afford. Until that time it had been a luxury fabric for the rich; the common people continued to wear homespun wool. Soon cotton textiles spread so widely and the technology for making them became so refined that the Europeans were selling them around the world in another escalation of the capitalist enterprise. By 1800, cotton accounted for one-fourth of Britain's annual exports. By 1850 this had risen to over half of all her annual exports, and British factories produced cotton cloth in such abundance that the price fell to only a quarter of what it had been in 1800 \[Braudel, Vol. III, pp .572-73\].

Cotton is still the most important and widely used vegetable fiber in the world, and the overwhelming majority of the cottons grown are of American origin.

In addition to the cotton fiber, manufacturing requires a large variety of other raw materials. Just within the textile industry, for example, dyes posed a problem for the Europeans. For centuries they traded dyestuffs, according them the same importance as rare spices. Without a consistent source of cheap yet high-quality dyes, the textile industry would scarcely have developed.

The American Indians, however, had also developed a complex technology for producing superior dyes, and the Europeans immediately adopted it. At the time of European contact, the Peruvian artisans used 109 distinct hues that they produced in seven color categories. These craftsmen used only dyes made from natural substances, and they produced dyes of such strength and brilliance that museums still exhibit brightly colored. Peruvian textiles over two thousand years old.

One of the first dyes found was the red and purple dye called brazilin, a crystalline compound taken from the brazilwood tree, Coesalpinia, of South America.

Europeans prized brazil wood both for making furniture and for the dye derived from it. This tree is sometimes confused with Bertholletia excelsa, which produces the so-called Brazil nut, but they are completely distinct types of trees. The Spanish called the land where the valued tree was found tierra de brasil, a phrase the Portuguese later shortened to Brasil.

Cochineal quickly emerged as the most important of Indian dyes in North America. The Indians of Mexico produced cochineal on special farms and in highly specialized workshops. The dye came from the bodies of the females of the scale insect Dactylopius coccus, which grows exclusively on a particular type of nopal cactus, Nopolea coccinellifera, a close relative of the prickly pear cactus. One pound of dye requires the processing of up to seventy thousand insects. After the conquest of Mexico, the Spaniards immediately seized control of the cochineal plantations and built new ones in Oaxaca. The European merchants then began marketing the dyes all over Europe. After silver, cochineal led American exports to Europe in the second half of the sixteenth century \[Wolf, p.140\].

Cochineal became a staple of the British textile industry, and it provided the scarlet dye for the brilliant British army uniforms, which earned the English soldiers the nickname "redcoats." In time, manufacturers used the dye in food products and cosmetics, in which it still plays a major role as a completely natural dye, but in the textile factories synthetic dyes replaced cochineal at the start of the twentieth century.

The Aztecs also cultivated the small annatto tree, Bixa orellana, for its red-and-pink blossom, used to flavor foods. From this plant's seeds, called achiote, the Mexican Indians refined a bright yellow or a reddish-yellow dye that made an excellent cloth dye.

Like so many of the natural dyes of America, achiote has also found extended applications in the processed foods of the modern era.

Achiote today colors oleomargarine and other artificial dairy products, giving them the brilliant yellow coloring that makes them brighter than butter.

Based on the Indian technology, other dye woods found in America allowed for new levels of quality in making purple, brown, and even black dye. These found widespread application not only in textile and food use but also in making glass, staining wood, processing leather, making ink, and printing. These remained the world's most important sources of dyes until nineteenth-century German chemists using coal deposits \(such as those around Kahl\) managed to synthesize new dyes from coal tar.

At each step in the process of industrialization, starting with the supply of early cottons and dyes, the Americas played an active and significant role. In the nineteenth century, industry made great leaps forward with the simple addition of two new products from America sisal and rubber. Indians used sisal, the tough cord extracted from the agave plant, Agave sisalana, to make cords, ropes, and rough bags or rugs. The industrial revolution generated needs for more types of cord and rope binders to hold together large quantities of raw materials or finished products, and sisal proved to be the ideal product. It offered a smoother and finer product than Asian hemp, only the long fibers of jute surpassed it in quality. Sisal became especially important in the development of harvesting machines to mechanize agriculture in the United States. These machines required a superior and very consistent cord with which to bind the grain and hay harvested, and sisal best met the need.

The American marvel rubber, or caoutchouc, as the Quechua Indians called it, provoked a series of technological innovations.

The Indians of America used rubber for untold millennia in a variety of ways. The Indians first extracted the sap or latex growing in the rubber tree, Hevea brasiliensis, and cured it over fire before using it. They made raincoats or rubber-coated ponchos to protect themselves from the rain, rubber-soled shoes for walking, rubber balls for playing games, rubber bottles for transporting liquids, and rubber ropes for carrying and fastening.

Even though the Indians used it for centuries and the Spaniards knew of it, Europe had no practical use for this curious substance, for the first few centuries after discovery. Columbus himself was reputedly the first European to see rubber, but he did not mention it in his writings. Early chroniclers described rubber as a sap made into balls which bounced and looked "as if they had been alive"

\[Poatgierter, p.87\]. For them rubber was no more than a curiosity, and Europe quickly forgot about it in the quest for gold, silver, tobacco, and other more profitable products.

The French scientist Charles de La Condamine rediscovered rubber in 1735, on a research expedition to Peru and the Amazon sponsored by the French National Academy of Science to measure the equator and establish a universal unit of measurement.

Suddenly in the nineteenth century at the start of the industrial age, the Europeans found myriad uses for the mysterious substance.

The Indians who first used rubber heated it and mixed it with sulfur to make it strong and resilient while at the same time removing its stickiness and its foul odor. In other words, the Indians vulcanized their rubber. When the American inventor Charles Goodyear accidentally discovered the same process in his laboratory in 1839, the way was clear for the multiplication of uses for rubber. In 1827, before the perfection of the vulcanization process, Brazil produced only twenty-seven tons of rubber, but by the end of the century it was putting out twenty thousand tons annually \[Wolf, p.325\].

Applications of rubber followed one another in quick succession as rubber ushered in a new wave of inventions. The Englishman Thomas Macintosh used rubber to make water-resistant clothes and thus invented the raincoat which still bears his name.

Shoe manufacturers applied rubber to make waterproof footwear that soon developed into rubber-coated tennis shoes and an array of other sports shoes that have steadily increased in popularity for daily wear. Articles of this material found their way into the making of boots, gloves, hats, canteens, knapsacks, supply bags, blankets, tents, life preservers, air mattresses, and wagon covers \(Burke, p.202\]. Such articles had a special appeal to the military, to explorers, and to pioneer settlers in new areas. With this new equipment, expeditions penetrated into the Arctic and other cold regions. European armies launched expeditions into the fiercest jungles of the Congo and the deserts of Mongolia and the Sahara, as well as up the highest mountain peaks of the Himalayas. The rubberized goods loaded onto a wagon enabled pioneers to cross the Great Plains of the United States, push deeper into southern Africa, and open up the new continent of Australia.

Rubber also found use in making tires to cushion the wheels of the bicycle. Without rubber tires, the bicycle was only a novelty, too bumpy and unstable for any practical use. Once it acquired rubber tires it quickly spread around the world as one of the most popular and inexpensive forms of transportation. The same tire then freed transportation from iron wheels on iron tracks and allowed the development of the automobile and all other modern wheeled vehicles.

Rubber went into machine parts that needed flexibility and elasticity. Some of the earliest uses included hoses for machines and rollers for printing. Rubber was also found to be the best available means of insulating electrical wire. Electricity had been known for a century, since the experiments of Benjamin Franklin and others, but until scientists insulated metal wires with rubber, they lacked a practical way to harness it and make it useful.

Rubber insulation then inaugurated the era of electrification which began late in the nineteenth century and was responsible for the opening of the first electrical fuse mill in Kahl in 1888.

Tar and asphalt had nearly as great a role in making the modern world as did rubber. From modern Pennsylvania to California, the Indians of North America applied asphalt to baskets or cloth to make them waterproof in much the same way that South American Indians had applied rubber. The California natives carried water in these containers, which were lighter than pottery and were unbreakable. The tar-coated cloths made excellent tarpaulins for protecting people and goods from rain, and the Indians of southern California even used asphalt to caulk their boats and to waterproof their roofs.

Pennsylvania Indians used a number of open pits as early oil wells, and based on these applications the white settlers of the Quaker State opened the first oil wells there in the nineteenth century, thus launching the oil industry.

America furnished more than the raw goods that served as the impetus for a technological revolution. America also supplied much of the new technology itself. The industrial revolution did not begin in villages such as Kahl, in the workshops of skilled urban craftsmen, or even in the factories of Manchester and Liverpool it began in the mines and on the plantations of America.

The Americas in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries promised vast resources gold, silver, and furs, as well as the seemingly inexhaustible agricultural potential for crops, of tobacco, sugar cane, rice, coffee, indigo, and hundreds of other plants. But a major obstacle constantly slowed the extraction of both the metals and agricultural treasures from the ground: the persistent shortage of labor. The Spanish quickly impressed the Indians into slave labor, but in some areas, such as the Caribbean islands and Central America, the Indians died very quickly from diseases, malnutrition, overwork, or simple culture shock and grief. In other cases the natives lacked sufficient experience in agriculture or mining to be acculturated into the new Spanish system as workers.

No matter how many slaves the British and Dutch shipped to America, the plantation and mine owners demanded more laborers.

Because of the lack of sufficient manpower, the Americans improvised whole new mechanical technologies to help tap the natural resources and potential wealth.

These technological innovations first arose in the mining industry.

The Spanish brought with them the most advanced mining technology that Europe had, but it proved unsuited to the unusual conditions of this highland desert.

Spanish smelting technology did not work, because the thin air lacked sufficient oxygen at such altitude to make fire hot enough to melt the ore. The Spanish turned to Inca craftsmen, who introduced a device known as a guayra or wind oven that had been used traditionally. in the Andes. The Incas produced fifteen thousand guayras for the Spaniards, who understood the technology so little that for the first two years they left the working and management of the mines entirely in Indian hands. The Spanish seemed content to reap the profits and allow the Indians to use whatever technology and organization worked best \(Cole, p.3\]. However, the scale of mining at Potosi, the unusual environment, and the type of ore required a whole new approach and organization to mining.

The next major innovation came in the silver mines of Mexico in 1556, when a miner discovered an amalgamation process using mercury to extract the silver. The application of mercury to crushed rock promoted easier extraction of a larger amount of silver. In 1572, Spain implemented this Mexican technology in Potosi after Francisco de Toledo opened mercury mines at Huancavelica in southern Peru. By 1575 the new mills had been established under Spanish rather than Indian management, and the mercury amalgamation process not only permitted the more efficient extraction of silver from the newly mined veins, but allowed the Spanish to begin reprocessing all of the tailings, or residual rock, from earlier mines. In order to crush the massive amounts of rock extracted from the giant mountain, the workers used Eurasian technology to build hydraulic wheels and install them at the base of the mountain. Within the first century of mining in Potosi, the workers built 132 such ore-crushing wheels.

To supply energy to turn these wheels in the virtual desert conditions of the high plateau, the Spanish forced thousands of Indians to excavate a series of thirty artificial lakes in the surrounding mountains to capture the small amount of rain in the area as well as the snow that melted and ran off from the higher elevations in the summer \[Crow, p.271\]. Canals carried the water, which then cascaded down a series of sluices to turn the wheels.

The churning wheels crushed the rock into a fine gravel, and the energy from the waterwheels also powered a series of giant hammers that pounded the gravel into a fine sand the consistency of flour. The "flour" became pasta when the Indians walked on it and mixed it with mercury.

The workers made thousands of bars from the silver in an assembly-line process; they sent these bars into the center of town, to the Casa de Moneda or imperial mint, to be made into coins. In Europe, craftsmen struck coins using hammers and manual dies that they impressed on blank slugs of metal. Such technology sufficed there, where the supply of precious metals for making money had been decisively limited. But in Potosi, the silver poured forth in such large quantities and there was such a dearth of skilled craftsmen that the old ways proved inadequate.

In 1773 the Spanish opened the modern Royal House of Money, a series of buildings and workshops devoted exclusively to the manufacture of money. The innovators of Potosi adapted an indoor version of the waterwheel to supply extra power.

Because of the lack of water, men and animals propelled the wheel by trudging in an eternal circle. This closely resembled the threshing mills used in many Old World areas that lacked running water. The wheels in the mint, however, turned a series of wooden gears up to eight feet in diameter as well as much smaller wheels.

When all of the wheels moved in concert, they produced a whopping blow of a hammer much like the hammer used at the base of the mountain to pulverize the ore.

Because of the scarcity of wood, craftsmen substituted the more abundant metals for machine parts wherever and whenever practical.

Using these comparatively primitive machines, the mint at Potosi struck three million silver pesos. Even more coins were struck at the Casa de Moneda established in Mexico in 1732 by the Spanish king Philip V. These coins were shipped out in great convoys that crossed over land and sea. This created the persistent problem of guarding the coins from the very men who transported and stored them. The Spanish crown needed foolproof shipping containers and secure locks that only the right authorities might open.

To meet this need, locksmiths and cabinetmakers invented various mechanical trunks that required multiple keys to open and which had a whole series of locks. In some cases as many as twenty-four locks on one chest could be opened by a single key. The large number of very minute gears and levers required for such contraptions pushed the locksmith's traditional craft beyond what had been sufficient in the past.

From extracting the ore and pulverizing it on to minting coins and transporting them, the traditional Old World technology that had sufficed since the days of the ancient Phoenician mines or the mines of Solomon failed to meet the new situation. The Spanish learned little about metallurgy from the Indians, although in many regards Indian technology was equal to and in some cases superior to European techniques. But the great magnitude of the mining enterprise in America demanded new techniques in order to produce silver at a rate that the Indians had never before attained. So much new information about mining developed in these years that in 1640 Barba published his Art of Metals, summarizing this new knowledge and thereby building the foundation for a modern metallurgy that became increasingly important with the development of industrialization \[Picon-Salas, p.107\].

Potosi grew into something far greater than just the world's largest mining town. It became a massive and integrated operation for the manufacturing of silver coins; it was a money factory. As such it may well qualify as the first modern factory. In other mines at Guanajuato, Taxco, Pachuca, Sombrerete, Durango, and Fresnillo in Mexico as well as Porco in Bolivia, similar factories developed for the production of silver or gold. Later these gave way to mines for the baser metals of tin, copper, zinc, bauxite, and uranium, each of which had its own role to play in later stages of the industrial revolution.

At the same time that the Spaniards were making Potosi into a large money factory, other Spaniards developed similar models of production on the plantations throughout the Caribbean and along the northeastern shore of Brazil. These plantations produced native crops such as cotton and tobacco as well as imported crops such as sugar cane, coffee, and rice from other tropical and semitropical zones of the world. Of these, sugar cane was one of the first, having been introduced to the island of Hispaniola by Christopher Columbus himself. It quickly became the most widely cultivated and most lucrative of the plantation crops.

Sugar cane, Saccharum oficinarum, has the peculiarly problematic characteristic that its sucrose starts to decay immediately after the cane is harvested. This required the farmers to press the sweet juice from the cane as soon as possible after cutting the cane.

Shipping the cane for processing to a nearby urban area, let alone all the way to Europe, as was done with cotton, would destroy the product. Each plantation needed its own sugar mill to grind the cane and to boil the residue down to a crystalline brown sugar. The plantation functioned more like what we today think of as a factory than like the traditional European farm or manor. In the organization and timing of crops, the plantation workers developed novel procedures. Since the sugar cane took one and a half years to mature, the plantation operators had to break the traditional cycle of seasons characteristic of European agriculture. Because of the need to process the cane immediately after harvesting, the harvesting had to be staggered so that not too much cane came ripe at the same moment. This made sugarcane culture even for the field workers a continuous rather than a seasonal or sporadic activity.

Stanley Mintz describes the sugar plantations as a "synthesis of field and factory" in a form that was "quite unlike anything known in mainland Europe at the time" \[Mintz, p.47\]. The cane had to be crushed, and then go through the stages of reduction, clarification, molding, and crystallization in a carefully synchronized and very exact procedure involving mills, giant furnaces, and boiling caldrons. This highly skilled part of the work required about 10 percent of the total workers of a plantation. Mintz describes this as "the closest thing to industry that was typical of the seventeenth century" \[Mintz, p.48\].

Even though the final refining of the sugar into a white substance was completed in England, the plantations of the Caribbean were essentially early sugar factories.

Sugar plantations often had attached to them not only the sugar mill but also a distillery for fermenting rum from the cane syrup. Thus the plantations functioned as factories of alcohol as well as of sugar, syrup, and molasses.

The close connection of sugar-cane plantations to factories is seen even in the nomenclature. In Portuguese, sugar mills are called eghenos de assucar, which means "engines of sugar." Even in English the term sugar mill emphasizes the industrial rather than the agricultural aspect of the enterprise.

The process for making sugar closely resembled that for extracting silver from ore and for making coins from ingots. The shortage of labor and the high cost of slaves impelled the plantation owners to mechanize as many of the steps as practical.

The rough terrain of the fields in the era before tractors limited the use of machines in the fields, but the craftsmen on the plantations adapted machines to take over the manufacturing part of the process, thus freeing more hands to work in the fields in cane cultivation. Whereas in the case of the mechanized mines there were only a few dozen major ones operating, there were thousands of plantations, each one an individual factory.

Plantation society pushed the complexity of economic organization to a new level because of the scale of human organization.

By comparison, the early factones of Kahl usually employed only ten to twenty workers, and those of England rarely had more than a hundred prior to the nineteenth century. But well before this the sugar-cane, tobacco, and rice plantations employed workers by the thousands. Aside from the army, the mines and the plantations used the largest organizations of human beings of any enterprise known. This type of economic activity represented such a marked departure from past modes of production that it has been called "military" agriculture \[Wolf, p.315\].

European companies and their governments insisted that as much of the manufacturing as possible be removed from the plantation and performed in Europe, because America lacked the labor that Europe had in excess and also because the colony-owning governments of Europe favored moving the manufacturing to the home country as a source of local employment and revenues.

The tobacco and cotton went to Europe to be made into finished products snuff, cigars, cigarettes, textiles.

Just as the plantations consisted of a small nucleus of slave barracks clustered around central warehouses and the production area, the European factory clustered workers' houses around a centralized manufacturing site. This new spatial arrangement replaced the traditional organization of manufacturing in Europe, in which individual craftsmen worked in individual workshops or homes. The new European factory modeled itself on the American plantation. The centralization of workers obviated the need for costly transportation to distribute raw materials to scattered households and workshops and to pick up finished goods.

Centralization also helped the owners impose uniformity of work and production on industrial laborers much as the plantation owners had already done with the African and Indian slaves.

Some people erroneously assume that the European factory grew naturally out of the traditional European craft system as some sort of inevitable cultural evolution. As Peter Kropotkin pointed out quite decisively, the factory system competed with the crafts system and did not derive from it. He showed how the Swiss watchmakers doggedly resisted the sale of machine-made watches and how the Lyon silk workers fought adamantly against manufactured silks \(Kropotkin, p.132\]. The technology of mass production of goods completely contradicted the principles of the craft tradition, which relied on the apprentice working first toward journeyman and then craftsman status.

Kropotkin pointed out that in contrast to that tradition, the factory system depended on unskilled labor that even a child could and often did perform \[Kropotkin, p.136\]. In the end he realized that the crafts would continue only as a source of goods for the aristocracy while factory goods would be for the working-class people. Kropotkin decried the unnecessary centralization and urbanization of industrialization and strongly advocated a highly industrialized but decentralized mode of production instead. This he felt would be much more in keeping with both the agricultural and the craft heritage of European manufacturing history \[Kropotkin, p.177\].

Kropotkin did not explain the origins of this alien mode of production the alien factory which bore so little resemblance to anything else then existent in European society.

Kropotkin recognized in the emerging factories a condition closer to slavery than to the craft heritage. Slavery per se, however, proved to be an inefficient and expensive way to maintain a factory, as was shown in the few attempts made to use slaves as industrial workers. One of these attempts took place in South Carolina.

Along the west bank of the Saluda River just outside Columbia, South Carolina, stand a series of abandoned canals and decrepit locks and a labyrinth of ruined brick walls. Suburban housing has grown up on every side, and young children swim and play among the ruins during the day, while young lovers swim and play there during the night.

Partway up the steep embankment from the river is a small cave, partly protected by a large rock across the entrance. A small opening inside the cave makes a tunnel leading down to an underground stream that surfaces sixty feet away from the cave. Local residents call the place Sherman's Cave, because of a dubious story that General William Sherman stayed in it while his artillery shelled Columbia on the far side of the river. A thick semitropical growth has reclaimed most of the area immediately around the ruins, and long vines hang from the trees. Teenage boys climb up the walls and swing on the vines, dropping deftly into the water while avoiding the large rocks that long ago crumbled from the building foundation into the water.

These imposing ruins that now offer such an idyllic playground on the edge of the city once served as a factory staffed by slave workers. Using waterpower from the Saluda River, the factory operated with much the same technology as factories being built at the same time in New England, Great Britain, and even Kahl.

The major difference was that African slave labor rather than paid workers was used to operate the factory.

This unusual factory tried to take advantage of the simple contradiction first made explicit by John C. Calhoun. He recognized an inherent conflict between labor and capital that is, between those who worked and those who owned the tools, machines, and other means of production. For Calhoun, the solution to this tension came in the simple remedy of unifying capital and labor: the person who owned the factory should own the workers as well \[Parrington, p.76\].

The slave factory system failed, in part because the owners could not compete with the much cheaper goods manufactured in New England and Europe. The capitalist system relied on paid laborers to run the factories, and these proved much cheaper than slave laborers. Factory owners had to pay only the one person, often a child, in the family who worked, and had to pay for only as many years as the worker actually produced.

Slavery proved too expensive a system to operate in a factory.

In contrast to the failed slave factory in the United States, Kahl's local enterprising merchants began to gather young women together to work in the mills by the middle of the nineteenth century. One of the earliest of such enterprises manufactured cigars from tobacco leaf, a form of production that required little skill and for which there was little available machinery. The cigar factory was soon supplemented by the other manufacturing factories that gradually took over all the mills of the village, making them into factories for cloth, barrels, and eventually even electrical goods. One form of mechanization pushed other forms.

Soon the new manufacturing in Kahl surpassed the capacity of the waterwheels to supply power, and the villagers began excavating local deposits of low-quality brown coal to produce electricity and thus increase the power available to them. After they exhausted the coal veins, the village switched to nuclear power to generate electricity.

Throughout this process the emergent industries stimulated development of collateral businesses such as construction and thus heightened demand for lumber, stone, brick, sand, gravel, cement, and other raw materials.

The industrialization of Kahl illustrates in miniature the process that occurred throughout England, Germany, and the other European nations. America supplied the raw materials for the revolution, and the sugar-cane plantations of the Caribbean and the mines and mints of Mexico and the Andes supplied the prototypes for the first factories. This initiated the industrial revolution in Europe; later in the nineteenth century a new stage based on coal and its derivatives replaced the first stage. This in time was superseded by the oil revolution when petroleum products became not only major sources of fuel but the source of many new raw materials, such as dyes, plastics, synthetic fibers, and a side array of chemicals.

Had Europe and America not come together through Columbus or some other connection, the industrial revolution would never have happened in the way that we know it. The peasants of Europe, Asia, and Africa would have continued tilling their fields while the craftsmen produced small quantities of needed goods in their workshops. Life would probably have continued as it had for thousands of years. But once the two great civilizations of the Old World and the Americas collided, technological progress exploded, making a true revolution in the mode of production. Soon cities such as Manchester and Paris and villages such as Kahl in Germany and Fort William in Canada plunged into the flurry of development that radically altered the traditional way of life of the whole world.

Without European technology and organization, the industrial revolution would never have started in America; without American precious metals and methods of processing, the industrial revolution would never have spread to Europe.
