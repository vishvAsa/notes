I owe the most to my family. My wife, Walker Pearce, traveled extensively for this project and served as a usually friendly critic. I also appreciate the encouragement and assistance of our children, Walker Pearce Maybank Buxton and Roy Pearce Maybank.

The publication of this book marks a decade of collaboration with my editor, James Oâ€™Shea Wade, and agent, Lois Wallace. With each year and each book, their guidance becomes more important and better appreciated.

I borrowed from many realms of academic thought, but I particularly appreciate the help of James Bodine, Rogert Buffalohead, Ray Fogelson, Bruce Johansen, William Leap, James Lenfesty, Nancy O. Lurie, John Mohawk, Allyn Stearman, Terrence Heath, and Catherine Warrick.

At Macalester College I appreciate the assistance of Robert Gavin, Diane Glancy, David Itzkowitz, Betty Ivey, Charlotte Johnson, David McCurdy, Anna Meigs, Paul Solon, Anne Sutherland, and the staff of the DeWitt Wallace Library.

For special help at the right moments, I acknowledge the contributions of Emigdio Ballon, Ada Deer, Kennon Dial, Tina Edwards, Ray Fadden, Evelyn Holt, Ramona Jones, Rochelle Jones, Chief Orin Lion, Phil Lucas, Freya Manfred, Ed Eagle Man McGaa, Tom Pope, and Jaune Quick-to-See Smith.

During the writing of this book, I received much appreciated financial assistance from the Dewitt Wallace Fund and a fellowship from the National Endowment for the Humanities.
