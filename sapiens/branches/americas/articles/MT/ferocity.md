None of the other major First American groups produced the same quantity and quality of ferocious tribes as the Uto-Aztecans. Nevertheless, we are tabulating the other big groups for reference. 

Tecumseh and his brother, of the Shawnee, were perhaps the first First Americans to conceive of some kind of a unified Amerindian alliance against the Europoids. However, that kind of unity did not catch on among the various tribes.

| Athabaskan | Apache, Navajo | Stealth, Ambush, Endurance | The last major group to surrender to the U.S. (1886). |
| Siouan | Lakota, Osage, Crow | Massed Cavalry, Expansionism | Decisively defeated the U.S. 7th Cavalry at Little Bighorn. |
| Algonquian | Blackfoot, Shawnee, Cheyenne | Territorial Defense, Heavy Raiding | Halted the northern fur trade and formed major resistance alliances. |
| Iroquoian (Iroquois) | Mohawk, Seneca | Siege Warfare, Logistics | Created the most sophisticated political/military league in the North. |
