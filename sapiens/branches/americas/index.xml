      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There were at least four waves of bow and arrow use in northern North America. These occurred at 12000, 4500, 2400, and after about 1300 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Earliest bows in Americas were used 10200 to 6800 BC by the Denali Tradition people - an ephemeral group related to but distinct from the Amerindians who crossed from Siberia to Americas after them. They were replaced by Northern Archaic Tradition People.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;They were buffalo hunters. They were essentially a stone-age tribe.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;war&#34;&gt;War&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Their war strategy was mostly guerrilla warfare. Their battles were essentially well planned raids - initially for stealing horses, cattle and captives. In raids, all adult males were automatically killed. Young children were sometimes adapted. Women were enslaved.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;captives&#34;&gt;Captives&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;They also traded in captives. THey acquired horses from the Spanish territories. They raided to capture horses and captives from others.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
