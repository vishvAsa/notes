Although Pirahã has one of the smallest set of speech sounds \(phonemes\) known, it can still be very difficult to pronounce without a little help. Here is a rudimentary guide to pronunciation, using the writing system that my missionary predecessors to the Pirahãs, Arlo Heinrichs and Steve Sheldon, and I developed for the language.



*b* Pronounced at the beginning of a word like the *m* in *mama*. Between the vowels *i* and *o* it is pronounced as a trill, with the lips vibrating \(as in some American children’s imitation of a car motor running\). Elsewhere it is pronounced like the *b* of *baby.*

*g* Pronounced at the beginning of a word like the *n* of *no*. Between the vowels *o* and *i,* as in the word *xibogi* \(milk\), it can be pronounced as either *g* or an *l*-like sound found in no other language of the world, where one makes an *l* but then lets the tongue continue out between the lips to touch the bottom of the tongue on the lower lip. Elsewhere, it is pronounced like the *g* in *god.*

*p* Pronounced like the *p* sound in English words like *pot*.

*t* Pronounced like the *English* sound in *tar.*

*t* Pronounced like the *English* sound in *skirt.*

*x* This is a glottal stop. It is pronounced like the medial sound in the English negative interjection *uh-uh:* “Do you have any sugar?” “Uh-uh” \(the sound where the “-” is\). This is not a full consonant in English and is not represented in the English alphabet. In the International Phonetic Alphabet its symbol is /.

*s* Pronounced like the English *s* sound in *sound,* except before the letter *i,* where it is pronounced like the English *sh* sound in *sugar.*

*h* Pronounced like the American English sound at the beginning of the word *here*.

*i* Usually pronounced like the English *i* vowel in *hit,* though occasionally like the English *e* vowel in *bed*. On some occasions it is pronounced like the *ea* sequence in *bead.*

*a* Pronounced like the British English *a* vowel in *father.*

*o* Usually pronounced like the English *o* vowel in *who*, though occasionally the vowel *o* in *abode*.



The acute accent ´ indicates a high tone and is written over a vowel when a high pitch is needed. When there is no symbol above a vowel it has a low pitch. Think of the English words *PERmit* \(a license or form of permission\) versus *perMIT* \(to allow\). The capitalized syllables normally have high pitch in English. In Pirahã, every vowel always has a pitch associated with it, depending on the function or location in the sentence of the word it occurs in.

I have tried in most places to translate Pirahã into idiomatic English. This has the consequence of presenting the language differently from the way the people actually speak. For example, many of the translations, unlike the original Pirahã sentences, include recursion. Anyone with a keener interest in the grammar can examine the Pirahã stories that are included in the book or my many linguistic writings about the Pirahãs, such as my chapter in the *Handbook of Amazonian Languages,* volume 1 \(edited by Desmond Derbyshire and Geoffrey Pullum, published by Mouton\). The stories in the book will be sufficient for most readers, since they provide literal translations \(though these translations are likely to be more difficult for non-Pirahã speakers to follow\).
