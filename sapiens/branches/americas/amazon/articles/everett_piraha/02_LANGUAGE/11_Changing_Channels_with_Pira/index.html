  <p><strong>C</strong>aboclos, travel, and other experiences of the Amazon were ultimately just means to an end. My experiences in the region were ordered around my struggle to figure out the grammar of Pirahã. As I made progress, excruciatingly slowly, I realized that this language was unusual—profoundly so. Initially I recognized this as I analyzed the way it organized its sounds into words. I based my conclusions about its uniqueness on field research with Tzeltales in southern Mexico, training with Comanche and Cherokee speakers in Oklahoma, helping missionaries analyze other Amazonian languages, and wide reading.</p>
<p>I usually did my serious work on the language in the loft of our tribal house. It was built parallel to the river’s edge to catch breezes. Our house had a storeroom and a ceiling made of ax-hewn boards over our sleeping areas (to prevent crawling, hopping, and slithering life from falling on us while we slept and also to make those rooms a bit cooler).</p>
<p>The triangular space created between my thatched roof and board ceiling was open on both sides, and there was enough room for me to put a table and a couple of chairs up there for my linguistics work. I referred to this space as my study. It was extremely hot in this relatively closed space, and there were snakes, frogs, tarantulas, and other critters in the thatch, but it gave a small bit of privacy from the village, so that my language teachers and I would have fewer distractions. Access to this space was by a homemade ladder nailed onto the living room wall just below my desk.</p>
<p>When I worked in my study, I was so hot that my T-shirt clung to me and my hair stuck to the sides of my head. But I learned to ignore that. It was the animal life that continued to keep me alert and wary.</p>
<p>From time to time I would have to stop working while small frogs jumped out of the thatch in panic with snakes slithering behind them. None of the snakes were very large, but some were venomous. They lived in the thatch, which was apparently a great hunting ground. I learned to keep a hardwood club at my feet or on the chair next to me. When I heard the thatch above my head rustle, I would scoot back my chair, pick up my club, and wait. First a frightened frog would jump out. I tried to kill them too. (I wanted all life out of the thatch.) But they were too fast and small. Then I knew that whatever had frightened the frog would not be long behind, so I would wait. Several times a snake would poke its head out. Since I was waiting, the slithery pest was almost always a goner. <em>Wham!</em> The club would bang the snake’s head against the thatch and support poles. I would toss the snake out into the jungle and go back to work.</p>
<p>I lived and breathed the Pirahã language while I was in the village. But my initial optimism about analyzing their language faded as I began to grasp just how difficult it was.</p>
<p>We have all seen Hollywood movies in which some explorer or scientist learns a tribal language fluently in just a short period of time. These seemed silly to me now as I struggled to learn more about this language and express myself in it. There were no textbooks. There was no one who could translate Pirahã sentences into Portuguese, except in the simplest paraphrases. Even after six months, I wasn’t sure that I understood anything my teachers were saying to me. It got very discouraging at times. But I saw that three-and four-year-old Pirahã children learned the language and I dared to believe that I might eventually speak as well as a three-year-old.</p>
<p>Although linguistics was my intellectual pursuit among the Pirahãs, I never lost sight of the fact that I was being paid by churches and individual Christians to translate the Bible into the Pirahã language. However, in order to do this I needed a thorough understanding of the structure of the language. The two goals were at least compatible at this stage.</p>
<p>Pirahã has one of the smallest sets of speech sounds or phonemes in the world, with only three vowels (<em>i, a, o</em>) and just eight consonants (<em>p, t, k, s, h, b, g,</em> and the glottal stop <em>x</em>) for men and three vowels (<em>i, a, o</em>) and seven consonants (<em>p, t, k, h, b, g,</em> and <em>x</em>) for women (they use <em>h</em> both where men use <em>h</em> and also where men use <em>s</em>). Women have fewer consonants than men. This is not unheard of, but it is unusual.</p>
<p>The term <em>glottal stop</em> will not mean much to many readers since it is a sound that is lacking from the phonemes of most European languages, including English. But it is important in Pirahã. In English we occasionally make the glottal stop in interjections, such as <em>uh-uh</em> (no). Whereas a consonant like <em>t</em> stops the flow of air coming out of the mouth just behind the teeth and a <em>k</em> cuts off the air with the back of the tongue raised against the palate, a glottal stop is produced by closing the vocal folds tightly and cutting off the flow of air before it gets into the upper portion of the throat (the pharynx).</p>
<p>To appreciate how small Pirahã’s list of sounds is, consider that En glish has approximately forty phonemes, depending on the dialect. And English’s inventory is by no means unusually large. Hmong of Vietnam has over eighty. At the other extreme, only Rotokas (New Guinea) and Hawaiian vie with Pirahã for smallness of phonemic inventory—both have eleven phonemes, the same number as Pirahã men.</p>
<p>Some have asked whether a language can communicate complicated information with only eleven phonemes. A computer scientist knows, however, that computers can communicate anything we program them to do, and that they do this with only two “letters”—1 and 0, which can be thought of as phonemes. Morse code also has only two “letters,” long and short.</p>
<p>And that is all any language needs. In fact, a language could get by with a single phoneme. In such a language words might look like <em>a, aa, aaa, aaaa,</em> and so on. It’s not surprising that there is no language known with only one or two sounds, since the smaller the phonemic inventory, the longer words have to be to provide enough information for speakers to distinguish one word from another (otherwise they would sound too much alike) and the harder it becomes for our brains to tell words apart (words that are too long would require too much memory to distinguish, among other problems). So if there were a human language like the binary language of computers, humans would need computerlike brains to use and recognize the very long words that would be necessary. Imagine trying to tell a word of fifty consecutive <em>a</em>’s apart from a word of fifty-one <em>a</em>’s.</p>
<p>There is therefore a tension between learning a large number of phonemes to keep words a more manageable size, versus learning fewer phonemes while letting words “grow” a bit. Some languages can be complicated in both ways. German has both long words and a large set of phonemes, for example.</p>
<p>A couple of English examples can help us see how we use phonemes to distinguish words. In the words <em>pin</em> versus <em>bin,</em> for most speakers the only way to distinguish which word means a small pointed fastener and which is a container is that one has the phoneme <em>p</em> and the other has <em>b;</em> otherwise the words are identical. This means that <em>p</em> and <em>b</em> are meaningfully separate sounds in English, unlike the two types of <em>p</em> in <em>pin</em> and <em>spin.</em></p>
<p>In the latter words, the <em>p</em> of <em>pin</em> is aspirated, meaning that a puff of air is emitted with its pronunciation, whereas the <em>p</em> of <em>spin</em> is not aspirated. (You can see this by holding a piece of notebook paper about three inches from your mouth when pronouncing these words in a normal voice. The paper will bend forward with the “wind” of aspiration from the first word, but not the second.) For this reason, in our alphabet we distinguish between <em>p</em> and <em>b,</em> a meaningful distinction, but not between the two <em>p</em> sounds of <em>pin</em> and <em>spin,</em> since we can recognize such words with or without aspiration. (Audrey Hepburn, influenced by her native Dutch, tended not to aspirate consonants and most people hardly noticed.)</p>
<p>This distinction between some sounds according to their position in the syllable is important for linguists but is not meaningful in English—any English speaker will understand <em>pin</em> and <em>spin</em> whether or not the <em>p</em>’s in the words are aspirated.</p>
<p>In <em>sheet</em> versus <em>shit,</em> the difference in sound for a native speaker of English is found in the tenseness of the tongue in producing the vowels. However, since the second word uses a vowel not found in Romance languages, like Spanish or Portuguese, speakers from these languages can have embarrassing moments trying to distinguish such words, since the two sounds are separate phonemes in English but not in Spanish or Portuguese.</p>
<p>For an inventory the size of Pirahã’s, words need not be quite so long as we might expect, however, because of two additional tools: context and the tones I mentioned earlier.</p>
<p>Context helps to distinguish meanings in all languages. Consider the English homonyms <em>to</em> versus <em>two.</em> If I ask you, “How many did you say?” and you respond <em>tu</em> (spelled phonetically), we know that only <em>two</em> and not <em>to</em> could be meant in this context. In fact most potential ambiguities are avoided by context.</p>
<p>I sat one day with Kóxoí at the table under my thatched roof in order to learn more about the sound structure of Pirahã words. Keren appeared with a cup of coffee. She gestured at Kóxoí to see if he would also like a cup. Kóxoí smiled and said, “<em>Tí píai,</em>” which I immediately guessed to mean “Me too.”</p>
<p>To check this out, I organized a few elicitation sentences to confirm my hunch, acting out and saying, “Kóxoí drinks coffee, Dan <em>píai,</em>” “Kóxoí drinks coffee, me <em>píai,</em>” and so on.</p>
<p>I recorded examples and isolated the phrases for <em>me too, you too, her too,</em> and so on. Then I asked Kóxoí to repeat them to me so that I could verify their pronunciation.</p>
<p>What he gave me was surprising and confusing.</p>
<p>He repeated, “<em>Tí píai.</em>”</p>
<p>I repeated.</p>
<p>He said, “Right, <em>kí píai.</em>”</p>
<p>“What did you say?” I asked with frustration and surprise. Why was he changing the pronunciation? Was there a more simple expression than I had thought?</p>
<p>“<em>Kí kíai,</em>” he repeated.</p>
<p>Now I was beginning to question my own sanity. Three different pronunciations in three repetitions. I was sure that the <em>k</em> sound, the <em>t</em> sound, and the <em>p</em> sound were meaningful units of speech—phonemes—of Pirahã. Phonemes are not supposed to be interchangeable! Change Tim to Kim to Pim in English, for example, and you don’t just get alternative pronunciations, you get separate words.</p>
<p>“<em>Kí kíai?</em>” I asked.</p>
<p>“That’s right, <em>pí píai</em>” came the exasperating answer.</p>
<p>In other repetitions, Kóxoí then gave additional pronuciations (again, the <em>x</em> represents the glottal stop of Pirahã): “<em>xí píai,</em>” “<em>xí xíai.</em>”</p>
<p>I wondered whether Kóxoí’s pronunciation was just “sloppy” compared to other Pirahãs or whether some deeper principle of the language was being illustrated by this variation. It might be that this word was changing meaning in ways that I wasn’t perceiving. Or it could just have been an example of “free variation”—a nonmeaningful difference in pronunciation, as inmy Southern Californian alternative pronunciations of <em>economics</em> as “<em>ee</em>conomics” and “<em>eh</em>conomics,” with no intended differences in meaning. I eventually concluded that it was indeed free variation.</p>
<p>I observed several other examples of this variation from many speakers. Some people gave me many pronunciations for a single word, like <em>xapapaí, kapapaí, papapaí, xaxaxaí,</em> and <em>kakakaí</em> for the English word <em>head.</em> Or <em>xísiihoái, kísiihoái, písiihoái, píhiihoái,</em> and <em>kíhiihoái</em> for <em>liquid fuel</em> (kerosene, gasoline, butane, etc.).</p>
<p>I saw that Pirahã allows an astonishing range of variation among consonants. This surprised me, especially in a language with so few phonemes. But at the same time I discovered that Pirahã makes such extensive use of tone, accent, and the weight of its syllables that the language can be whistled, hummed, yelled, or sung.</p>
<p>For example, the sentence <em>Káixihí xaoxaagá, gáihí</em> (There is a paca there) has a musical form. It is this musical form that is whistled or hummed or sung.</p>
<p>The vertical lines in the example indicate word boundaries. The notes between the lines are the musical representation of one word. The caret (^) under a note indicates that the syllable is louder than other syllables in the same word. A whole note (hollow oval) represents the longest syllable type in the language (consonant + vowel + vowel) and a quarter note (black oval) represents the shortest syllable in the language (consonant + vowel). The other notes and length dots represent syllables of other lengths—Pirahã has five syllable lengths. The relative height of the notes, that is, the syllables, indicates the tone. A higher note is a syllable with high tone. A lower note is a syllable with low tone. A connecting line between two notes, a musical “tie,” indicates that there is a movement from a low tone to a high tone or a high tone to a low tone, with no pause between the two end points. In the musical representation of <em>káixihí,</em> the first group of notes has a falling tone, followed by a short low tone, with a preceding break in the whistle (where the glottal stop would have been in <em>káixihí</em>), followed by another short break (where the <em>h</em> would be) and a short high tone, and so on. The word, without consonants or vowels, is stressed (volume-adjusted) according to syllable weight. Thus, the syllable boundaries are clearly present in whistle, humming, and yelling channels, all of which figure in this musical representation even though the phonemes themselves are missing.</p>
<p>There is no staff in my music analogy because Pirahã tones do not have precise pitches like musical notes (middle C on a piano keyboard produces sound waves of 256 hertz), but are relative. A high tone in Pirahã or any other tone language is not a specific number of hertz, but is simply made with greater frequency of vibrations in the vocal cords than a low tone.</p>
<p>I began to feel that there was a connection between the small number of phonemes and the presence of these “channels of discourse.” I hypothesized that these channels were the key to understanding both the small number of consonants and vowels in Pirahã and the astonishing variation among the consonants. Since all these channels rely crucially on the fact that Pirahã words can be represented musically, we should try to understand a bit of what that musicality derives from.</p>
<p>First there are the tones. Each vowel in every word has either a high tone or a low tone, in a way similar to Chinese and other tone languages.</p>
<p>Linguistic tones evolve from a ubiquitous property of the world’s languages, <em>pitch,</em> the relative frequency of vibration of the vocal cords. All languages use pitch to distinguish meanings. In English, for example, a rising pitch at the end of a sentence generally indicates a question, whereas falling pitch indicates a statement.</p>
<p>In English punctuation, a period is used to mark falling pitch, while the question mark indicates rising pitch. When pitch is used to distinguish the meanings of sentences in this way, it is called <em>intonation.</em> There are many variations of intonation possible. To see just a glimpse of complexity in English’s use of pitch and stress, consider one of my favorite examples, known among linguists as “stress clash override.” When uttered alone, the word <em>thirteen</em> has higher pitch on the last syllable—“thirTEEN.” And the word <em>women</em> has higher pitch on the first syllable, “Women.” But put the two words together and what do you get? You don’t get “thirTEEN Women,” you get “THIRteen Women.” Why?Because English, like several other languages, doesn’t like two high-pitched, or accented, syllables next to each other. It prefers to have an alternating pattern—ACCENTED nonaccented ACCENTED nonaccented, and so on. So speakers of English change the accent on words like <em>thirteen</em> when they precede and modify other words, in order to get the result of alternating accents while at the same time maintaining the accent on the main word of the phrase, in this case the noun <em>women</em> in the noun phrase <em>THIRteen Women.</em> And no English-speaking child ever had to be taught this pattern of accents! They just do it. Figuring out how this is possible is one of the puzzles that make linguistics fun.</p>
<p>All languages, whether spoken in the deserts of Australia, the streets of Los Angeles, or the jungles of Brazil, use intonation. But many languages use pitch in another way as well. Although English uses pitch to change meaning in sentences, it does not use pitch to change the meanings of words, with some exceptions that can help us to understand what goes on in a tonal language like Pirahã or Chinese.</p>
<p>Consider what differentiates pairs of nouns and verbs like <em>CONtract</em> (noun) versus <em>conTRACT</em> (verb), <em>PERmit</em> (noun) versus <em>perMIT</em> (verb), and <em>CONstruct</em> (noun) versus <em>conSTRUCT</em> (verb). In these pairs, the noun has higher pitch on the first syllable, while the verb has higher pitch on the second syllable.</p>
<p>But while English uses pitch to distinguish meanings of only a few pairs of words, in tone languages, every syllable or vowel or word bears a distinctive pitch, called a <em>tone.</em></p>
<p>I first learned this distinction, as I learned many things about the language, by committing an egregious error. Kóhoi and I were working on some terms that I thought might be needed for Bible translation, among other things.</p>
<p>I asked him, “When you like someone very much, what do you call him?”</p>
<p>“<em>Bagiái,</em>” Kóhoi responded.</p>
<p>I tried putting the word to use right away. “You are my <em>bágiái,</em>” I said, smiling.</p>
<p>“No!” he responded, laughing.</p>
<p>“What,” I asked, “you don’t like me?”</p>
<p>“I do like you,” he said, giggling a bit. “I like you. You are my <em>bagiái.</em>” But there are <em>bágiái</em> and we don’t like them,” he clarified.</p>
<p>To help me get what he was saying, Kóhoi whistled the words for me, slowly. Then for the first time I heard the difference! The word for <em>friend</em> is <em>bagiái,</em> with a single high tone on the last <em>a:</em> “ba-gi-Ai.” But the word for <em>enemy</em> has two high tones, one on each <em>a:</em> “bA-gi-Ai.” That little difference is what separates friend from enemy in the Pirahã language. The words are related to the Pirahãs because <em>bagiái</em> (friend) means literally “to be touching”—someone you touch affectionately—and <em>bágiái</em> (enemy) means “to cause to come together.” Culturally, though, <em>bágiái</em> has an idiomatic meaning—an enemy is someone who causes things that are not his own to come together. Idioms like this rely on more than the literal meaning of the words, which can in fact be irrelevant, like the English expression <em>kick the bucket,</em> which means “to die,” completely disconnected from the literal meaning of the individual words of the phrase.</p>
<p>Clearly, I had to write the tones as part of the language. So I adopted a fairly common linguistic convention and used the acute accent to mark the high tone. When there is no mark above a vowel, the vowel has a low tone.</p>
<p>Here is another set of Pirahã words, each one distinguished from the others by the relative pitch of the vowels:</p>
<p><em>xaoóí</em> (aoOI) “skin”<br>
<em>xaoói</em> (aoOi) “foreigner”<br>
<em>xáoói</em> (AoOi) “ear”<br>
<em>xaóoí</em> (aOoI) “Brazil nut shell”</p>
<p>Because Pirahã uses pitch so widely, it has communication channel options that most European languages lack. I call these channels of discourse, following the pioneering work of sociolinguist Dell Hymes.There are five such channels in Pirahã, each having a unique cultural function. These are whistle speech, hum speech, musical speech, yell speech, and normal speech—that is, speech using consonants and vowels.</p>
<p>To know the Pirahãs, one has to know about these channels and their functions. I had heard of these before going to the Pirahãs. And I knew that other languages had similar modes of expression (such as the drum languages found in Africa or the whistle speech of the Canary Islands). But when I heard an example in Pirahã for the first time, it was quite a novel experience for me.</p>
<p>This happened one afternoon after I had set out some old <em>National Geographic</em> magazines for the Pirahãs to thumb through. They love pictures of animals and peoples, whether from the Amazon or other parts of the world. Xiooitaóhoagí (i-owi-taO-hoa-gI) sat on the floor, looking through the magazine, with her baby suckling at her breast. Her legs straight out in front of her, dress pulled down to her knees, in the normal Pirahã manner, she was humming rhythmically to the child on her lap as he nursed energetically. I watched for a bit before I realized that what she was humming was a description of the whale and Eskimos whose pictures she was examining. The boy would look away from her breast to the picture from time to time, and she would point and hum louder.</p>
<p>Like all true communication channels, hum speech can “say” anything that can be said with consonants and vowels. But also like the other channels, it has a specific set of functions. Hum speech is used to disguise either what one is saying or one’s identity. It does this because even for a native Pirahã who is not paying close attention, it is hard to follow. And hum speech is conducted at very low volume. So it is also used for privacy, like our whispering. (The Pirahãs don’t whisper, they hum instead. I wondered about this for a while until German linguist Manfred Krifka reminded me of the obvious reason for it. In whispering, the vocal cords are unable to produce different tones, so Pirahã speech would be rendered unintelligible.) Hum speech is also used to talk when one’s mouth is full. Finally, it is frequently used by mothers when talking to their children.</p>
<p>Yell speech is the use of the vowel <em>a</em> or, occasionally, the original vowels of the words being spoken and one of the two consonants <em>k</em> or <em>x</em> (glottal stop), to yell the musical form of the speech, that is, its tone, syllables, and stress. Yell speech is commonly used on rainy days when the rain and thunder are loud. It is used to communicate with Pirahã at long distances. It is as loud as a yell, but without consonants. It can occasionally be in falsetto.</p>
<p>Koobio lives at Xagiopai, a seven-day canoe trip upriver from Posto Novo. One rainy day when I was there visiting, Koobio was across the river at his father Toitoi’s house. His wife, Xiáisoxái, was back at Koobio’s, about to cross to Toitoi’s side of the river. Koobio began yelling in this fashion.</p>
<p><em>“Ká, Kaáakakáa, kaákaá.”</em></p>
<p>In normal Pirahã speech this would be “<em>Kó Xiáisoxái. Baósaí</em>” (Hey Xiáisoxái. Cloth).</p>
<p>Surprisingly, though the rain muffled most sounds, this speech carried impressively. Shortly thereafter we heard Xiáisoxái yell back, “OK, I’ll bring your shirt when I come.”</p>
<p>And then there is musical speech, one of the two communication channels that the Pirahãs have special names for. They refer to musical speech as “jaw going” or “jaw leaving.” It is produced by exaggerating the relative pitch differences between high tone and low tone and changing the rhythm of words and phrases to produce something like a melody. This channel has perhaps the most interesting array of functions in the language. It is used to communicate important new information. It is used to communicate with spirits (and often it is used by the <em>kaoáíbógí,</em> or spirits, themselves). But it is mainly used when the people are dancing. Interestingly, though I have no explanation for this fact, when I ask Pirahã to repeat something in musical speech, women produce it less self-consciously than do the men.</p>
<p>Whistle speech, which the Pirahãs refer to as talking with a “sour mouth” or a “puckered mouth”—the same description they use of the mouth when sucking a lemon—is used only by men. For some reason, this restriction to men is true of most other languages with whistle speech. It is used to communicate while hunting and in aggressive play between boys.</p>
<p>My first intense contact with whistle speech came one day when the Pirahãs had given me permission to go hunting with them. After we’d been walking for about an hour, they decided that they weren’t seeing any game because I, with my clunking canteens and machete and congenital clumsiness, was making too much noise.</p>
<p>“You stay here and we will be back for you later,” Xaikáibaí said gently but firmly.</p>
<p>I watched the men leave me. I was standing by a large tree. I had no idea where I was or when they would come back. The jungle was dark from the shade of the climax forest trees. There were mosquitoes buzzing around me. I took out my machete in case an animal came prowling around. I wondered if the Pirahãs would ever be back to get me. (If they hadn’t returned, my skeleton would likely be there now.)</p>
<p>As I tried to make the best of my solitary confinement, I heard the men whistling to one another. They were saying, “I’ll go over there; you go that way,” and other such hunting talk. But clearly they were communicating. It was fascinating because it sounded so different from anything I had heard before. The whistles carried long and clear in the jungle. I could immediately see the importance and usefulness of this channel, which I guessed would also be much less likely to scare away game than the lower frequencies of the men’s normal voices.</p>
<p>These channels show how culture can influence language. If I didn’t know about the channels of discourse, I would not know the culturally appropriate way to communicate the different types of information that each of these channels is used for. A complete description of Pirahã culture has to include a discussion of how one communicates spiritual information, intimate information, and so on. The function of the channels is cultural. That is, the linguistic facts, the small number of phonemes and the amount of free variation between consonants that almost drove me crazy at the beginning of my work can’t be explained without the cultural information.</p>
<p>Simply put, Pirahã may have so few sounds because it doesn’t need any more. The importance it places on these different channels makes consonants and vowels less important for the Pirahãs than they are for English, French, Navajo, Hausa, Vietnamese, and other languages. This challenges modern theories of language because these don’t expect culture to enter into the sound structure.</p>
<p>Some have suggested an alternative to my account above, namely, that the small number of consonants and vowels is what facilitates the channels just discussed. This would turn my explanation on its head and would mean that it is the language that affects the culture, rather than the culture that affects language in this case. But there are many languages with different channels, such as whistle speech, but which have very large numbers of consonants and vowels. Two such languages are Lalana Chinantec of southern Mexico, and Yoruba of West Africa. One reason that these two languages can have both large numbers of consonants and vowels and whistle speech is that consonants and vowels seem to be more frequently used (but much more research is needed on this type of comparison from a variety of languages before we can make such assertions with much confidence) and thus have a higher communicative burden placed upon them than the consonants and vowels of Pirahã. Also, they seem to use fewer prosodic channels (so they do not have channels such as hum speech and yell speech alongside whistle speech) than Pirahã and use them less frequently. There is a lot of research to be done in understanding the relationship between culture and sound systems, so I doubt if my explanations are remotely complete at this point. But the explanations I am proposing are not only promising; they address a set of phenomena that Chomskyan linguistics, for example, ignores altogether.</p>
<p>In 1984 I published my first journal article on Pirahã sound structure, a “squib” in the journal <em>Linguistic Inquiry.</em> It made, I thought, a small point and corrected a theoretical error common in the literature about the nature of stress systems and the theory of syllable structure. When the article appeared, I was a visiting scholar at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, with an office across the hall from Chomsky’s, and I was supported by grants from the National Science Foundation and the American Council of Learned Societies. I thought I had “arrived” as a scholar.</p>
<p>After the article appeared, I received unexpectedly emotional letters (this was before e-mail). Ellen Kaisse, a professor at the University of Washington, sent a postcard to say that the article hit her like a “bomb” and that she had postponed the planned content of her lectures to discuss Pirahã’s sound structure with her students.</p>
<p>Several other linguists wrote letters. A couple told me I clearly didn’t know what I was talking about—no sound system could work that way. A couple were encouraging. Since this was my first article in an international forum, I was unprepared for the reactions. I guess I figured that no one would read this little piece and that it would simply adorn my curriculum vitae.</p>
<p>By 1995, after I had published extensively on Pirahã phonology, Pirahã had become well known and figured in a number of theoretical controversies about the nature of sound structure. At the heart of these controversies about sounds is the conflict between deduction and induction. Linguistic theorists believed that they had successfully established parameters within which the sound systems of human languages could vary—no variation would occur outside of these parameters. These parameters, in turn, had been <em>deduced</em> from more general theoretical axioms and were considered elegant and almost necessarily true. Yet inductive work on Pirahã revealed a system beyond these boundaries, if my work was correct.</p>
<p>The controversy attracted the attention of the person who was to become the most important visitor I ever hosted in Brazil, Professor Peter Ladefoged of the University of California at Los Angeles. Peter had a large grant from the National Science Foundation to document the sounds of small, endangered languages around the world. He had asked if he could come to the Pirahãs with me to hear for himself the stress system that I had described in my publications.</p>
<p>I was already in Brazil and drove to the airport at Pôrto Velho to meet Peter’s plane. On the drive I felt as if I was about to be audited by the Internal Revenue Service. I had made controversial claims about the sound structure of Pirahã, and now the world’s leading phonetician was coming to check these claims. I had done my best, I had been honest, and I was confident that I was right. But I was still nervous.</p>
<p>Peter, who died in 2006, was a tall, patrician-looking man. He had a deep voice, shaped by the dialect of upper-class English known as Received Pronunciation, or RP, English—the Queen’s English. He had been a consultant for <em>My Fair Lady,</em> the film that helped determine my choice to become a linguist after I watched it at the Egyptian Theater in Hollywood the year it was released, 1962. It is Peter’s voice that emerges from the gramophones in Henry Higgins’s (Rex Harrison’s) office and Peter’s handwriting in the little notebooks that Higgins keeps and shows in an early scene in front of London’s Covent Gardens to Eliza Doolittle (Audrey Hepburn).</p>
<p>After collecting his luggage, Peter emerged from the baggage claim area and waved. I went over to him and told him how pleased I was that he had come, trying to hide the tension in my voice.</p>
<p>“I’m skeptical of the claims you have made about Pirahã’s sound system” were the first words out of his mouth. “Bruce and Donca are also skeptical and have asked me to check this out carefully,” Peter added, referring to two well-known colleagues of his at UCLA. Over the days we spent in the village, Peter made high-quality recordings of Pirahã that ultimately supported my published analyses and contributed to the impact that the Pirahã language has had in theories and research on sound structure.</p>
<p>But the experiments occasionally required a lot of patience from the Pirahãs. To measure things well, we had to set up a solar-powered phonetics lab. The Pirahãs had to wear headsets with microphones two inches from their mouths, and, occasionally, to tolerate tubes up their noses to measure supraglottalic pressure (airflow above the vocal cords). They took it good-naturedly and sat still for all of these experiments, surprisingly enough. Once again, science was indebted to them.</p>
<p>The recordings that we made were archived at the phonetics laboratory at UCLA and have been used by other researchers, such as Matthew Gordon of the University of California at Santa Barbara, to further develop theories of human speech sound structure. Because of such work, any researcher can access Pirahã sound data and not only check my analysis, but use Pirahã data, as did Gordon, to deepen our understanding of similar phenomena from a variety of other languages.</p>
