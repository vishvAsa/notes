One of the best books I've read. Very glad that the author failed as a missionary, and succeeded as an anthropologist linguist. It turned me into a partial admirer of the pirahAs.

You said towards the end that only a few hundred speakers are left. Then I saw on YT that they got TVs and a school later! Please tell me what's their current status and numbers. Are they as happy as they were when you left them; and holding strong?
