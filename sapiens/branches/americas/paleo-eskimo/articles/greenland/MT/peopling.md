The interesting thing about the brutal landscape of Greenland is the number of times it was re-colonized by genetically distinct people starting from as early 2500 BCE! The war-like Scandis +++(=scandinavians)+++ had a tough time dealing with the whale-killing Inuits. We would posit that genetic factors allowed to Inuit coming from Alaska to ultimately triumph.

| People/Culture | Origin | Period | Legacy |
|--|--|--|--|
| Independence I | Northern Canada (Arctic Archipelago) | c. 2500-1800 BCE | Part of the Paleo-Inuit tradition. Genetically distinct from modern Inuit; descendants of a separate migration from Siberia. |
| Saqqaq | Northern Canada / Alaska | c. 2400-800 BCE | Also Paleo-Inuit. DNA shows they are related to Siberian Chukchi and Koryak peoples, but not to modern Inuit. |
| Independence II | Northern Canada | c. 800-1 BCE | Paleo-Inuit. Often grouped with the early Dorset culture; specialized in hunting muskox and seal in the extreme north. |
| Early Dorset | Northern Canada | c. 700 BCE-200 CE | Paleo-Inuit. Famous for the "Arctic Small Tool Tradition." Lived primarily along the west and east coasts. |
| Late Dorset | Northern Canada (Ellesmere Island) | c. 700-1300 CE | The last of the Paleo-Inuit. Known to modern Inuit legends as the Tuniit—a shy but powerful people eventually replaced. |
| Norse (Vikings) | Iceland / Norway | c. 985-1450 CE | Scandinavian (European). Founded by Erik the Red. Established farming communities but disappeared during the "Little Ice Age." |
| Thule (Inuit) | Northern Alaska | c. 1200 CE-Present | Inuit. Direct ancestors of modern Greenlanders. Brought advanced technologies like the Umiak and dog sleds. |
