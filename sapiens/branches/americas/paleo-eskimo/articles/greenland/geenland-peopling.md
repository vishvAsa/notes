Greenland was not colonized by the Amerindians or their predecessors. It was only discovered in the mid-to-late 3rd millennium BC

## Belkachi
The Belkachi people migrated across the Bering Strait in the early 3rd millennium BC. They expanded across Alaska and the American Arctic. Their descendants reached Greenland towards the end of the millennium, forming the Independence I and Saqqaq cultures.

## Saqqaq
The climate shift which led to the Bronze Age Collapse in Eurasia also afflicted the Arctic, reducing the Saqqaq to a refuge in southwestern Greenland by beginning of the first millennium BC. They were overrun by their Dorset relatives from continent in mid-1st millennium BC.

## Dorset repopulation
The global cooling episode at the beginning of the 1st millennium AD fully depopulated Greenland. It was only settled for a third time later in the millennium by additional Dorset from America in the north and by Norsemen in the southwest.

## Inuit
Inuit, derived from a later Asian migration to Americas, were better adapted technologically to Arctic life. They annihilated Dorset everywhere by 15th century AD & came into conflict with the Greenlandic Norse. Greenland Norse likely died of starvation.

## Denmark
While English, Flemish, and Portuguese sailors sailed near Greenland from the 15th to 18th centuries; there was no sustained contact with the Inuit. Hans Egede convinced Denmark to establish a missionary & trading post on the island in 1721, beginning Danish colonization.

Denmark shifted its administration of Greenland away from missionary activities towards trade within a few decades. Greenland benefitted greatly from the 19th century whaling boom, leading to population recovery and the creation of the first Greenland Inuit press in 1861.

The United States made a number of attempts to purchase Greenland from the 1860s to the 1910s.

Denmark reformed Greenland's government in early 20th century by taking it out of the hands of the Royal Greenland Trading Company & placing it into the hands of civil servants. Greenlandic influence on government was limited to advisory role in the regional councils.

## Freedom
Following Germany's conquest of Denmark in 1940, Greenland declared itself sovereign and invited the United States in to occupy the island. We obliged in May 1940. The US occupation drove the administrators to consult with Greenlandic people more than previously.

## Denmark
Denmark reasserted its authority over Greenland following WWII. Greenland was made an integral part of Denmark in 1953, & granted 2 parliament seats. The Danes invested in Greenland, resettling the population in towns & introducing modern sanitation, leading to population boom.

## Sterilization
Greenland's population boom was costly to Denmark, which launched a decades-long sterilization program of Inuit in response. Revelations from that sterilization program reshaped Greenland demography & are currently a thorn in Greenland-Denmark relations.

## EU
Greenland was unhappy with Denmark's entry into the European Community as it threatened the livelihoods of its fishermen. Greenland voted overwhelmingly for Home Rule in 1979 in response. The sovereigntist social democrats, unionist liberals, & nativist greens were main parties.

## Politics
Greenland was dominated by the social democrats, Siumut, for decades. The 2008 financial crisis and successful self-government referendum weakened their appeal, leading to the nativist greens, Inuit Ataqatigiit, taking power 2009-2013.

Greenland sought foreign investment in its mines to financially enable greater independence from Denmark. Chinese investment drew the attention of the United States after Trump's election, leading to his first offer for the island.

The collapse of the establishment social democrats leaves Greenland's political future wide open. There is little support for US annexation, but some in Greenland favor independence in free association with the United States. Ultimately Greenland will decide its own future.
