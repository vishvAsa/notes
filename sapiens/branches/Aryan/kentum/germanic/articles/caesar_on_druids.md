"They are involved in divine matters, oversee public and private sacrifices, and interpret religious practices.  
A large number of young men gather around them for the sake of learning,  
and they are held in great honor among them.  
They are said to memorize a vast number of verses,  
and some remain in training for as many as twenty years.

Above all, they wish to convince [people] of this:  
that souls do not perish  
but pass after death from one body to another,  
and by this belief, they think that people are especially motivated to virtue,  
since the fear of death is disregarded.  

Furthermore, they discuss many things about the stars and their movements,  
the size of the world and the lands,  
the nature of things, and the power and might of the immortal gods,  
and they pass these teachings on to the youth."
