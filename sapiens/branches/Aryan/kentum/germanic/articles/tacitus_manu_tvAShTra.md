(The Roman Tacitus writing about the Germanic peoples)

They celebrate with ancient songs, which is their only form of record and annals, that the god Tuisto, born from the earth, and his son Mannus, are the origin and founders of their race. To Mannus, they attribute three sons, from whose names the nearest tribes to the Ocean are called the Ingaevones, the central ones the Herminones, and the rest the Istaevones. Some, as is common with the liberty of antiquity, assert that more gods arose and that there are more names of peoples, including the Marsi, Gambrivii, Suebi, and Vandilii, and they claim these are the true and ancient names.
