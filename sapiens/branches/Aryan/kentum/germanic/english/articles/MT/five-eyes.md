## Entities
Source: [TW](https://x.com/blog_supplement/status/1847160950735921502)

There is an entente of entities that are distinct but aligned on some issues in the pa~nchanetra sphere: 

1. the deep-state proper centered on the mahAmlechCha DoS and praNidhi-saMsthA-s;  
2. Then there are sora, navyA~Nka & tAla-vR^ikShaka-s with their shaNDa-sainya.  
3. then there are the tech bros like duShTa mukhagiri, pachchaisundari and the like who merge into the previous class.  
4. Finally, there is the most dangerous X who cannot be mentioned in public. 

nAri~nga will likely run into them -- the signals have already been sent.

## Mutual usage
One of the operational features of the pa~nchanetraka alliance is to use the intelligence apparatus of one of the members of the confederation to do what you can't do in your own country with your own apparatus. That is exactly what mahAhAsA's backers want to do to muShkvan via their English allies. They seem rather desperate with the American election day around the corner

## Higher than others
No nation other than the pa~nchanetraka-s, not even Israel, forms a true alliance with USA. As the sole world power by a stretch it is too dangerous -- any nation will be used as a pawn and discarded unless it carefully safeguards its own interests. This takes a lot of effort because of the extremely vengeful nature of the Anglo-abrahamo-sphere, which doesn't let even a small act of defiance pass.
