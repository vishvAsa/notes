A sentence in 3 Germanic languages:

Frisian: De sinne skynt moai oer it griene lân.
English: The sun shines beautifully over the green land.
German: Die Sonne scheint schön über das grüne Land.

It is notable that the ortholog of the Frisian word for beautiful, 'moai', is entirely lost in English. It has been completely replaced by 'beautiful' of Norman (French) origin. It has likely been lost in modern standard German too.

Angles, Saxons, Jutes and Frisians were the main Germanic groups that contributed to the origin of Old English, with the core coming from the first. There were probably some other minor Germanic groups other than these 4, whose footprint was small. 

It is very likely that the Aryan-s who invaded India spoke distinct dialects of old Indo-Aryan that coalesced into standard Sanskrit, with some of their speech lineages never getting incorporated into Sanskrit despite pANini spanning a vast geographic realm in his quest.
