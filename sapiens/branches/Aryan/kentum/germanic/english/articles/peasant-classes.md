Medieval peasantries are often seen as amorphous blobs but in former ages hierarchy touched all levels of society, not just the elite. In Anglo-Saxon England there were (very broadly) three main classes of peasants, from highest to low: Geneatas, Cotsetlan and Geburas.

Geneatas, "companions", were the aristocrats of the peasantry. They were free from week-work, instead acting as their lord's direct servants by escorting his guests, running for him errands, guarding his stables and so on. It was this class which most often owed militia service.

Cotsetlan, "cottagers", held small plots of land, around 5 acres, and worked primarily as labourers. Depending on where they were they might labour between 3-5 days a week, usually in the reaping and sewing of their lord's crops - a sheaf of which he was paid for 1.5 acres' work.

Geburas were typically emancipated slaves and men who had fallen into destitution. They were given land and livestock by their lord, which reverted back to their lord's ownership on their death, and in return they shouldered heavy burdens of land-work and other physical services.
