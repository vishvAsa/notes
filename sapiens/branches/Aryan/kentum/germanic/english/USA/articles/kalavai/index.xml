      <description>&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.facebook.com/KalavaiVenkat/posts/3161986467415041&#34;&gt;FB&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We met with an Iraqi family, who have been out friends for the last 15 years. Their daughter was a K-12 classmate of ours. The Iraqi lady narrated her experience of the genocidal war America waged against Iraq. Her brother and sister-in-law were killed in US strikes. Both were civilians. Their only child is battling cancer which he got as a result of the US using depleted uranium shells. Her aging parents are caring for the child. Iraq today is a pale shadow of the wealthy nation it was before the US invaded. This woman and her family are Kurds by the way. They are emphatic that Saddam was an angel compared to the US.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
