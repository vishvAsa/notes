      <description>&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&#34;https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2024/11/10/a-geopolitical-round-up-vijayavijaya-and-related-issues/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A geopolitical round-up: Vijayavijaya and related issues&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In earlier accounts, we have detailed how the Mahāmleccha Deep State had engineered the uccāṭana of Vijaya-nāma-vyāpārin. In a dramatic reversal of fate, the Picchilaka made a comeback against all odds to retake the śvetālaya of the Mahāmleccha-s and, barring some extreme event will be re-crowned Mahāmleccheśvara. Thus, the story of the Nāriṅgapuruṣa has come to fit the classical and timeless tale of the triumph of the hero – something which prompted the mythologist Campbell to coin the phrase a hero with a thousand faces.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&#34;https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2023/06/02/looking-back-at-the-goroga-attacks-and-forward-at-geopolitical-developments/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Looking back at the goroga attacks and forward at geopolitical developments&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;An acquaintance recently asked us if we remembered the famous goroga+++(=anthrax)+++ attacks in the mahāmleccha lands. We had to confess that they were hardly the top thing on our mind, though we had repeatedly thought of those attacks at the beginning of the pandemic. He said that he had seen a recent presentation on it by the journalist Harivana+++(=Greenwald)+++, who had helped the momentous revelations of Himaguha see the light of day. He wondered if we might rethink our position on the Wuhan disease after seeing it. We told him that while the Wuhan corruption had become a matter of personal faith for many, we did think there was something of a “conspiracy” with regard to the goroga incident. Harivana is not a good guy from the H perspective but has exposed mleccha evildoing on several occasions. Hence, we went and watched Harivana’s presentation on the goroga scare and felt the urge to put down a few words regarding that sordid episode which we experienced from close quarters.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

He was the hero of the age for them, a veritable yuganātha, who had reified all they had stood for. The left-liberal biologists (the majority of them are such) celebrated his manifold vibhava-s by naming no less than 14 newly discovered organisms, from a fungus to a dinosaur-age lizard, after him. His pakṣa rested in the content surety that he would be succeeded by yet another of their chosen ones, the old Ṣiḍgapatnī, who had caused their hated antagonist, al-Qadhdhāfī of barbara-prathamonmatta extraction, to be meet his end by being skewered through his arse by their ghāzī allies on the North African sands. His reign had also seen the execution of at least 10 varṇa-kopa-s, following up on the Neocon-backed efforts of his predecessors, the mahāduṣṭa-s Guccaka and Vakrās, and the Ṣiḍga before him. It was hoped that the Ṣiḍgapatnī who had overseen many of those operations would continue the tradition without any break with financial backing from duṣṭa Sora and others. After all, they had propped up Vijaya-nāma-vyāparin as a strawman to demolish and overthrow the hastipakṣa.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&#34;https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2006/01/21/iran-and-the-terrorist-state-of-pakistan/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The ascendency of USA came as a result of it literally being the “New World”. The natives of the land stretching from the cold reaches of Canada to the Southern tip of Patagonia, had only used up all the megafauna of the land leaving behind much of the mineral, forest and aqueous wealth for their White successors to plunder. Unlike Eurasia which had been denuded by thousands of years of high intensity metal and horse age human colonization, the Americas still had much to be used. The intense conflict between the two Germanic sibs Germany and England ensured the decline of England and Europe allowing the white colonists of USA to take leadership of the Leukosphere. Spain had overdone its colonial enterprise resulting in its decline. The distance of the Americas from Eurasia allowed it to be insulated from the tumultous convulsions that periodically rack Eurasia. While outwardly a strong democracy, at its heart lay dictators like the famous Edgar Hoover who ensured that the dissenting elements, both ideological and racial, which might weaken the country were eliminated.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&#34;https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2005/08/31/law-and-order-in-mlechcha-desha/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The land of the mlechChas is in krau~ncha dvIpa is renowned for its orderliness arising from the maintenance of law and order. However, when the chakra of indra and vAyu+++(=Hurricane)+++ struck the land it was striking to note that the law and order collapsed rapidly. The state largely lost control and the dire circumstances resulted in an intense human competition and lawlessness.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This did not seem to be case in bhArata despite the similar strike by the manyu of indra. The lawlessness appears to be of a different kind in bhArata from mlechCha desha. One wonders if this is because of svabhAva of the concerned people or the social inequalities between the kR^iShNavarNas and shvitinchyas.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Her performance was pretty patchy esp in the 2nd one. Yet she was somehow the &amp;ldquo;winner&amp;rdquo;. The GOP establishment &amp;amp; media badly want her to emerge as the prime alternative to Trump.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It is v.clear that the neocons, a limb of the deep state with tangled connections that underlie &amp;ldquo;neo-Occidental civilization&amp;rdquo;, have decided to prop her up. The MSM has been a domain of the neocons since the rise of guchchaka &amp;amp; mahAduShTa-vakrAs. That&amp;rsquo;s what we are seeing here.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;preta-nationalist-takeover&#34;&gt;preta nationalist takeover&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Just as the ShaNDa-s realized that they could take control of piNDaka and run the state on his behalf, a xenophobic preta nationalist cabal realized that they could do the same with nAri~Nga with anUpa as their frontman. Thus, we are squarely in the age of rule by puppet mlechCharAT-s in mahAmlechCha politics.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;viveka&#34;&gt;viveka&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;While many here like to condemn viveka, we don&amp;rsquo;t see him as part of the problem, but rather a symptom of the brewing trouble among the mahAmlechCha.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Cognitive bias can deeply eclipse IQ and common sense. This is amply visible in the navyonmatta as well as the classical pretonmatta &amp;ldquo;army/law enforcement worshiper&amp;rdquo; elite among the mahAmlechCha. In contrast, a significant fraction of the common folks among them get this point with regards to the rUs. Putin&amp;rsquo;s speech today vs piNDaka&amp;rsquo;s navyonmatta backers&amp;rsquo; priorities exemplifies this.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

What they don&amp;rsquo;t get is some of the most important scientific discoveries made in the US in the past &lt;del&gt;30 years were due non-pa&lt;/del&gt;nchantraka foreigners Those discoveries in turn have gone on to provide employment for legions of mlechCha-s researchers who would take much longer to reach where they are on their own.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&amp;hellip; However, if one looks at world surveys, the opinion among the people towards India tends to be delta positive in the Anglosphere (apart from places like rUs or Israel). Thus, despite the old enmities and new support for anti-H activities there will be some level of affinity between the India and the Anglosphere.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now it is true that in the past the &amp;ldquo;right&amp;rdquo; or the Rs had a more negative opinion of H than the left or the Ds. But what people should realize is that there has been a shake up in the ground in US politics.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

First, to clarify, we believe it was born as a hegemon because at birth itself, it defeated the British empire. Hence, we can see it as an empire from its inception.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The British empire can be mapped from the conquest of Jamaica from the Spanish in 1655 to 1947, when it lost India and the circum-India states shortly thereafter = 292 years&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;We can place the Spanish empire between 1521 (the conquest of the Aztecs) and its 1898 rout by USA=  377 years.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The start and end of the Portuguese empire are a little murkier, but we could say it lasted between the conquest of Goa in India and the loss of its many African possessions: 1975 - 1510 = 465 years.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;French empire ~1605 gain of Canadian possessions to the 1962 fall of Algeria: 1962 - 1605 = 357 years&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Russian empire: 1547 Ivan the Terrible becomes Tsar to tsar Putin (present)= 478 years&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For a comparison, the Hindu empires within the subcontinent are generally short lived:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

We all know who was the man who put a stop to the last of these projects.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The great divergence between the deepstate &amp;amp; the American masses is that the former want to keep playing Great Game 2. This urge comes from superpower realism which holds that no overtly heathen power should arise that might even marginally rival the Occidental Xtian leukosphere. The only place where such a possibility exists in the modern world in the Indian subcontinent (Some might barge in saying: what about chIna? We say that even if chIna-s might have some heathen remnants, their power is not visibly or consciously heathen. More over the incident of the chInese younger bro of Jesus has made the occident wary of shift in center of gravity; then there is Galtonism; then there is dysfertility). Hence, the biggest issue for the deep state is to degrade &amp;amp; for a subset ultimately dismantling H power in the subcontinent.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
