## Hidden hand
The Benveniste files provide a unique window into the mAhAmlechCha elite and their satellites that many had suspected. What it still does not answer clearly is how he got all his wealth and connections in the first place. There are some others today like that (apart from field-specific phenomena like Robert Trivers), and once one sees the thread, the hidden hand becomes visible. Idiots on the H pakSha don't know how dangerous it is to say too much of it in public.

The Benveniste's files reveal something discerning observers catch: a deep hate among the liberal American prathamonmatta and core mahAmlechCha elite for the H.

## Boosterism
While all kinds of stuff regarding Apastiya the Benveniste is coming up from the new files, I wonder if anyone has dug up stuff regarding his part-coethnic, the well-known biologist Robert Trivers, who is one of Apastiya's staunch defenders. Apart from being a part coethnic, there are some things about Trivers that mirror Apastiya. While Trivers is a good scientist with some excellent contributions, he has a particularly exaggerated aura and reputation about him. I've heard people call him "one of the greatest biologists" (!), "most important biologist since Darwin(!) etc." This mirrors the mysterious reputation around Apastiya. Why did the mighty and the rich gravitate towards him who had no true, visible profession? At least Trivers was a decent biologist. It almost seems the reputation-building that happened for Trivers catapulted him into Apastiya's circle, and the two became entwined. One really wonders what Trivers was up to to call Apastiya a "person of integrity" -- it seems more than just a $40k gift.


An example from the files of the consistent boosterism  regarding the biologist Trivers. I believe he means "greatest thinkers": How and why did this reputation building happen for Trivers? He was a decent scientist but there were and are many like him and better. It is again notable it parallels the Beveniste's reputation among the rich and mighty...
