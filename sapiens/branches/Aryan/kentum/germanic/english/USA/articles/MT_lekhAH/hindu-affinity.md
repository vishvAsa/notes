... However, if one looks at world surveys, the opinion among the people towards India tends to be delta positive in the Anglosphere (apart from places like rUs or Israel). Thus, despite the old enmities and new support for anti-H activities there will be some level of affinity between the India and the Anglosphere. 

Now it is true that in the past the "right" or the Rs had a more negative opinion of H than the left or the Ds. But what people should realize is that there has been a shake up in the ground in US politics.  

First the Rs have become a marginal coalition which is will to accommodate people like Tulsi or for that matter Vivek, whereas the Ds have become the crusaders who evangelize navyonmAda. See article I'd RTed recently. 

Thus, though the nAri~Nga coalition has people like duShTa-jarilaputra who would see viveka and tulasi as devil worshipers, there is still a counter-balance. On the other hand, H like Ro Khanna are not doing anything good for H only undermining their power in the desh itself. What to say of the navyonmatta-s and neocons...

The left-liberals and the ekarAkShasavAdin-s converge in their svabhAva-vairam towards H. On many points even their expression is the same because (to borrow from Al Beerooni) at their pith both are essentially the same: the former is merely a 0-grade ekarAkShasatvam. 

What many people don't get is that of the hastin-s pichChilu~Nga is best option because he is not too religious. This is good for H but doesn't please his pakSha entirely. However, his supporters are clear on their position, e.g., someone just pointed out how duShTa jarilaputra calls the H goddess a demon: (Source: [TW](https://x.com/TuckerCarlson/status/1847700712894902499) ) duShTa-jarilaputra then goes on to say that the H goddess inspired aTTahAsakI to kill kids.
