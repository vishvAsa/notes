> The eagerness with which mainstream media declared Nikki Haley as a winner in both debates is striking. Her performance was pretty patchy esp in the 2nd one. Yet she was somehow the "winner". The GOP establishment & media badly want her to emerge as the prime alternative to Trump.


It is v.clear that the neocons, a limb of the deep state with tangled connections that underlie "neo-Occidental civilization", have decided to prop her up. The MSM has been a domain of the neocons since the rise of guchchaka & mahAduShTa-vakrAs. That's what we are seeing here.

They (at least a subset) originally put their lot with anugAmin. However, anugAmin has a bit of a mind of his own & also the instinct to gauge what his base might want. Hence, he did not go their way. Also the base he is trying to tap into knows that nAri~Nga is a better choice, so why go for some1 secondhand. So anugAmin started declining. 

OTH viveka is clearly best of the also-rans by a large margin. However, he has several disadvantages: 

1. He looks alien to the modal mahAmlechCa. 
2. Despite his many genuflections & assimilation of Judaeo-Christianity he is still a heathen. 
3. He opposes the primary neo-con + para-neocon (i.e., other deepstate operatives, e.g., soranAma mahAduShTa -- he started with the hastin-s under rAjaka the sailUSha from kapilAraNya) project of never-ending wars like that in dAnu-apara. 
4. He is anti-Galtonism in a fundamental rather than superficial sense. 
5. He is a threat to the bureaucracy. 
   

Hence, every attempt will be made to suppress him. It seems the primary reason for the neocons propping up the utterly useless paTTini is to try to balance him out. 

## navyonmatta-gUDha-chakra
Source: [TW](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1744569283152117887.html)

The structure of the mahAmlechChAnAm navyonmatta-gUDha-chakra has a complex structure that cannot be easily probed by the lay beholder. There is madhyama-prAkAra which is manned by ardha-kRShna. Hence, those who probe a bit realize that it is not sana-piNDaka but end up thinking that it is ardhrakRShNa who calls the shots. But one should not forget that before the Chala-prabandha to place piNDaka on the Asandi, they brought a relative unknown ardrakR^iShNa & put him on the mancha. So he is not the real power -- it is those who put him there. 

Of course he is a useful frontend, for he is a veritable bodhisattva for the lay masses of left-liberals -- he is the rAma-rAja for them. But the power & handling behind the scenes is handled by the true gUDhachara-s. They have allies with grandiose ambitions like the sora-kula but they are not as visible as him. 

The answers can be found by asking why paTTinI, if made to run for the ma~ncha would win with a bigger margin than nAri~Nga, but in his own pakSha paTTinI cannot challenge nAri~Nga. The answer lies in connection of yuddhonmAda & the particular interest in dAnu-apara. That leads us to a confederation that in the broad sense includes: kR^iShNAdri-phuka, the pR^iShTaka-kula (ardhakR^iShNa-s biggest backers), agrabhaTa, TamTama steya, svAdupuruSha, madhubhR^i~Nga, dAvaka, bejha, guggulu, mukhagiri, dvAra: a truly formidable array 


## Internal struggle

Source: [TW](https://x.com/blog_supplement/status/1827378132430524716)

The internal struggle among the mahAmlechCha has come down to one between loyalty to a popular personality and the oligarchic face of the deep state.  
We believe that the natural human tendency is to gravitate towards the popular personality,  
but if we were to believe the surveys so far, it is almost exactly half and half.  
So, is the assumption that people gravitate towards the popular personality incorrect  
or is there something else at play?  
We believe it is not flawed  
but a result of the deep state deploying something it has mastered over almost a century  
with roots in the machinery deployed by the earlier leader of the Anglosphere.  

While the German and Japanese challenges during WW2 caused a leadership change in the Anglosphere,+++(5)+++  
it did not mean the death of the old methods.  
We believe that they were intensified with the transition of power within the Anglosphere,  
as the model of dominance moved away from direct "colonial" operation to manipulation "at a distance".+++(5)+++  
The Anglosphere had also picked up several effective propaganda tools from the defeated Third Reich.

When the deep state found a popular challenge to its ways (outside spending),  
it turned these tools inward to place a puppet leadership.  
The old propaganda tools have been successfully updated  
in terms of delivery for the younger generation with a low attention span:  

1. It is unlikely to invest in reading long articles/books;  
2. It prefers the visual and auditory medium. 
3. It prefers, information delivered in short bursts that produce visceral reactions. 

For the older and middle-aged folks MSM still remains a potent source of propaganda transmission.  
Thus, through the capture of MSM and big-tech the deep state is able to deliver a strong dose of propaganda  
that has worked effectively in keeping enthusiasm for the oligarchic rule high,  
while concealing its disastrous performance in the last 4 years.+++(4)+++

Thus, as of today the deep state could pull off an internal victory among the mahAmlechCha  
with almost 0.5 probability.  
If coin flipped the other way,  
given its vindictive nature,  
the oligarchy would cause mayhem via its bha~njaka-s, kAlAmukha-s, marUnmattapriya-s and ShaNDasainya  
to paralyze the ruler elected on popular personality.  
At least some in both the elite and the working class are afraid of voting according to their real preference due to the fear of the bha~njaka-s disrupting life.

The above is all commonplace stuff  
but there is a hidden, more tangled aspect of the oligarchy that is too dangerous to mention in public.

## anUpa
If anUpa+++(=vance)+++ had been gardabha, the mahAmlechCha MSM would singing his paens as though he was a second coming of ShiDga.  
Now they ignore his bold engagements with them while spreading a childish slander.  
But perhaps by putting himself out there anUpa is delivering a message on behalf of vijaya-nAma-vyApArin to the propagandized.

### Protection
anUpa is on a roll regarding the rotten soybean confederation across the pond: the warning to punish them if they harm muShkavAn now starts to explain several things.

## Pulled rug
Get the feeling that the nAri~NgapuruSha has come to the realization that deepstate-neocon machine will not let him become rAjan irrespective of the election outcome.  
A certain resignation is seen in him despite continuing the fight.  
It is interesting that  
he never properly articulates how they pulled the rug under him the last time --  
he simply says it was a fraud.  
He could be more convincing if articulated that case --  
it can be made quite strongly -- as how the rug was pulled.

I personally think pichChilaka is the only tolerable candidate now  
precisely because he is not too conservative in the American sense of the word.  
A hyperconservative type is essentially a mahApretAnuchArin likely combined with neoconism.  
Such types are bad for H as they will support pretabhAnaka-s in the desh.  
They will also foment wars that are detrimental to the H.  
Conversely, liberals are bad as they are naturally inimical to H and will support marUnmatta-s and socialist terrorists in addition also being neocons. 
pichChilaka is actually the middle ground and that is the problem he faces from both sides. But when one weighs things the left-liberal is the worst.

## Debate
The way the gUDharAshTra/gUDha-chArin-s are plying their puttalikA sphuNTakI is quite sophisticated -- drawing the pichChilalu~Nga into an ambush in a tilted playing field & prepping her up to make her appear like something she is not. Still, the pichChilala is still holding on to a draw. These operations are not limited to the mahAmlechCha domestic system but are used the world over.

## Assination attempts

Source: [TW](https://x.com/blog_supplement/status/1837013011984449659)

The first would-be nAri~NgapuruSha killer was puzzling but inscrutable.  

The second one, however, is puzzling in a very different way.  
Just a short excavation down the rabbit hole throws up so many knots that one cannot  
but compare his situation with that of the former mlechCharAT karNATi.  

mahAmlechChadesha is not at all a cheap place to live,  
and it is very difficult to get by without money.  
So how did this chap get by is the first question that comes up.  
The dAnu-apara connection is just too obvious.  
If he had been an ordinary kR^iShNa,  
someone like aTTahAsakI in her former avatara might have tossed him into jail.  
Yet he seems to have mostly roamed around scot free -- how?  
Was he an agent of the gardabhin-s or the praNidhi-s?

## FoE assault
The global, simultaneous assault on FoE by the liberals (euphemism is their hallmark) is remarkable even if unexpected. They just have one wall to breach, and are expertly preparing aTTahAsakI and vartaka as the battering ram for that. They are employing the same trick used to place piNDaka on the Asandi. 

It is unclear if vijaya-nAma-vyApArin backed by muShkavAn can survive the global force -- key phrase: the pa~nchanetra-s look inward.

Hopefully that disgusting trifecta of neologisms: mis-, dis- and mal-information meets an end with the reign of vR^iddha-piNDaka. But the left-liberals will likely keeping it going as it becomes a central element of their victimhood theology.

## gardabhin-backup
One gets the feeling that the gardabhin-s have multiple backup plans. As muShkavAn states, if aTTahAsakI wins a decisive victory, then he will be immediately targeted with the objective of punar-vi-grahaNa and bleeding his other immense assets. To give it a cover of neutrality, the Brits, continental Euros, and even Brazilians would be deployed. 

I saw that one otherwise sane and v.knowledgeable Brazilian has a muShkavAn derangement syndrome. 

Even in the unlikely event that nAri~Nga wins decisively, the gardabhin-s will move rapidly in the remaining time they have left to attack muShkavAn's assets aided by their own dhUrta-dhanin-s, i.e., the sora-navyA~NkAdi. A more likely outcome is a narrow or indecisive win for one of the two pakSha-s followed by prolonged haggling, which will give time for the gardabhin-s to deploy their multilayered forces to take the day. In all this,  mahAhAsA will be carried along like a puttalikA by the powerful forces fronting her.

## Rus escalation
It seems the controllers of piNDaka and the Deep State are resorting to their ultimate ploy to end the nAri~Nga's honeymoon. They have crossed the line of what the rUs consider a direct attack against them. The worst-case scenario (they may actually be rooting for it) is to draw the Western Europeans & their satellites to directly enter the war. We don't think the daNDa-s, shUlapuruSha-s, and probably even the phira~Nga-s are really prepared for this. A corollary to that is that the mahAmlechCha & kR^ishadeshaka-s would be drawn into it. Their hope is that it would sabotage the nAri~Nga's promises of ending the war soon and thus ruin his second reign. People like nimeShaka and his backers are more than happy to play with fire.

Many think that piNDaka himself has ordered the strikes on the rUs. However, anyone with some buddhi knows that piNDaka has undergone buddhichyuti and is not in a state to meaningfully pull it off. 

The reality is that piNDaka is controlled ultimately by the likes of sora, nayva~Nka, pR^iShTaka etc, with their neocon allies in the policy circles and their agents like sullaka+++(=??)+++ and nimeShaka in the government. So, the plans hatched by the higher level are put into action by these duShTa-s and that's exactly what has happened. 

They fear that the nAri~NgapuruSha would pour water on their entire venture going back to ShiDga's regime of pulling down the rUs. Hence, as a desperate parting move nimeShaka and sullaka have decided to exercise the option made famous by the hero of their tradition shamshonaka.

## Pardon
Wonder why people are so excited about piNDaka letting vyAdha-piNDaka go. That's in every way the most unsurprising thing and also keeping with what every other mahAmlechCharAT has done

## Corporate truce
It is amply clear that the mahAduShTa-s mukhagiri and khalvATa bejha are now intending to reach a truce with the pichChilaka so that they get some favors in return. Hopefully the nAri~Nga does not make big concessions for them

## Syria and Georgia
vijaya-vyApArin has made a largely correct statement regarding Syria but the neocons and their proxies will have other plans. Big win for the mahAmlechCha-bha~njaka-s and their marUnmatta allies before pichChilu~nga takes the throne.

After Syria, the mAhAmlechCha Deep State's latest move is to light a new fire in Georgia. To repeat ourselves, the rUs will be severely tested. The open question is how far their plants to scuttle pichChilaka will bear fruit. As you can see Georgia is very strategic: the Caucasian underbelly of Russia, fossil fuels, the two seas, communication with Islamic state in Iran,

## Kash Patel
nari~Nga unleashing the turtle has undoubtedly sent shockwaves. There will be a frenetic reaction: the question is whether the public would ever see it. pichChilaka's turtle is one of the few who has openly spoken truth about duShTa-mukhagiri: like a zairimyangura daeva for the ahurian. Thus, the old allies Big tech and the daNDaka-s would do all they can to prevent the turtle from reaching shore.

##  MAGA infighting
We had a sneaking feeling right from the beginning that at some point MAGA's "broad tent" will be rent by infighting. It seems that is already underway even before pichChilaka takes the Asandi. Essentially what that branch of MAGA wants is quotas for their perceived racial identity group -- in a sense like the gardabhin-s snagging it pervasively for their chosen identity groups.

While nAri~nga's supporters are saying the quite part out aloud, it should seen that the green card queue for H has been clogged since the reign of the gardabhAnAM bodhisattva, obarAja into that of piNDaka. One will see that this actually negatively affects even the complaining identity group if one works its consequences through.

### Preferential hiring
While the bitching members of the shvetatvak identity group claim that the H are engaging in preferential hiring of co-ethnics, they would not ask the question of what they would do. Who would they offer to work for given the choice between a H and shvetatvak supervisor? There is no point acting as though they are ethnicity blind. Whom are they more comfortable with given their own attitudes... So, essentially, this is just a simple case of allomisia: nothing surprising in that -- anyone who has been observant will know it exists at some level.

> Everyone prefers American bosses and Hindu subordinates... This preference is only in the entry level. Higher level clustering tends to be more visible.

## Undermining

Source: [TW](https://x.com/blog_supplement/status/1875411048041156882)

It is unlikely piNDaka's puppet masters quietly step back when nAri~NgarAja seizes the Asandi from their puttalika. In particular, the wicked ones like nimeShaka, sullaka and khalvATa have probably already laid the foundations to undermine the pichChilaka. 

We posit that this would mean poisoning foreign relations like those with bhArata. Their agents will also continue to keep causing trouble even as they place roadblocks to nari~Nga's people like the H surasA. 

Even when outside the govt, they would have the backing from sora and soraputra at the like. Their agents will act to break the nAri~Nga-lATeshvara synergy from last time.

The Parthian shot that duShTa-piNDaka just fired sounds ominous. It should be taken seriously by the H. The ati-duShTa-s like nimeShaka and sullaka have probably laid the ground work for these "flowers to bloom" even after nAri~Nga deposes them in 4 days.

## Israel vs Hamas
Now that it has become clear that it was pichChilaka's agents rather than duShTa nimeShaka who was involved in the Israel-Pal ceasefire, one of the more outre theories that can be trotted out is a possible card of the ghost of the deceased Apastiya.


## Parting message
mlechCharAT vR^iddha-piNDaka's parting message copying his predecessor Eisenhower +++("military industrial complex")+++ is either a strange true flashback about his own regime or projection. But in America, they only do prAtaHsaMdhyA and a subset of his backers like duShTa mukhagiri and to a degree, even duShTa sundarbhikShu and khalvATa have moved on to do arghya to the sunrise.

## CA fire
It seems the kapilAraNya-dahana has consumed the elegant art of vyAdha-piNDaka as poignant closure to the regimes of the atiduShTasora-backed vR^iddha. With that piNDakAyanI's mithyA-dhana has also probably become shUNya.

## viveka fired
Wonder what happened to viveka: There seem to be 3 broad explanations: 

1. He was fired by nAri~Nga/his court. 
2. He clashed with muShkavAn and his men like the varShapuruSha. 
3. He organically left to pursue lower political ambitions. 

We have a suspicion that nAri~Nga/muShkavAn's inner circle has advised the mlechCharAT to cut him loose. They probably sense him as a self-promoter with too high ambitions for their taste. 

One possible trajectory is that he tries his hand with lower political offices, crashes and burns out and eventually fades away.

## Comical
The nAri~NgapuruSha has svAbhAvika comedic element. Perhaps he means to be serious but still comes across as funny
