> The eagerness with which mainstream media declared Nikki Haley as a winner in both debates is striking. Her performance was pretty patchy esp in the 2nd one. Yet she was somehow the "winner". The GOP establishment & media badly want her to emerge as the prime alternative to Trump.


It is v.clear that the neocons, a limb of the deep state with tangled connections that underlie "neo-Occidental civilization", have decided to prop her up. The MSM has been a domain of the neocons since the rise of guchchaka & mahAduShTa-vakrAs. That's what we are seeing here.

They (at least a subset) originally put their lot with anugAmin. However, anugAmin has a bit of a mind of his own & also the instinct to gauge what his base might want. Hence, he did not go their way. Also the base he is trying to tap into knows that nAri~Nga is a better choice, so why go for some1 secondhand. So anugAmin started declining. 

OTH viveka is clearly best of the also-rans by a large margin. However, he has several disadvantages: 

1. He looks alien to the modal mahAmlechCa. 
2. Despite his many genuflections & assimilation of Judaeo-Christianity he is still a heathen. 
3. He opposes the primary neo-con + para-neocon (i.e., other deepstate operatives, e.g., soranAma mahAduShTa -- he started with the hastin-s under rAjaka the sailUSha from kapilAraNya) project of never-ending wars like that in dAnu-apara. 
4. He is anti-Galtonism in a fundamental rather than superficial sense. 
5. He is a threat to the bureaucracy. 
   

Hence, every attempt will be made to suppress him. It seems the primary reason for the neocons propping up the utterly useless paTTini is to try to balance him out.

The structure of the mahAmlechChAnAm navyonmatta-gUDha-chakra has a complex structure that cannot be easily probed by the lay beholder. There is madhyama-prAkAra which is manned by ardha-kRShna. Hence, those who probe a bit realize that it is not sana-piNDaka but end up thinking that it is ardhrakRShNa who calls the shots. But one should not forget that before the Chala-prabandha to place piNDaka on the Asandi, they brought a relative unknown ardrakR^iShNa & put him on the mancha. So he is not the real power -- it is those who put him there. 

Of course he is a useful frontend, for he is a veritable bodhisattva for the lay masses of left-liberals -- he is the rAma-rAja for them. But the power & handling behind the scenes is handled by the true gUDhachara-s. They have allies with grandiose ambitions like the sora-kula but they are not as visible as him. 

The answers can be found by asking why paTTinI, if made to run for the ma~ncha would win with a bigger margin than nAri~Nga, but in his own pakSha paTTinI cannot challenge nAri~Nga. The answer lies in connection of yuddhonmAda & the particular interest in dAnu-apara. That leads us to a confederation that in the broad sense includes: kR^iShNAdri-phuka, the pR^iShTaka-kula (ardhakR^iShNa-s biggest backers), agrabhaTa, TamTama steya, svAdupuruSha, madhubhR^i~Nga, dAvaka, bejha, guggulu, mukhagiri, dvAra: a truly formidable array
