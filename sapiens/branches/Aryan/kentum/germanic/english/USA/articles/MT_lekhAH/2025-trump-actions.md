## Help to Israel
It is very clear that the mUlavAtUla-s are suppressing reports of their losses. Apparently, at least some of their military installations have suffered heavy damage, with many more deaths than they are admitting. This is part of the reason they are desperate for the mahAmlechCha to fight on their behalf. mahAmlechCha are already shoring up their astra-s and intelligence but still seem reluctant to join despite all the gorilla-thumping by the mlechCharAT.

## Iran
Having looked at the West Asian conflict over the past few days, it is becoming increasingly clear that the prathamonmatta objective is to do a Libya/Qaddafi on the Islamic state in Iran/Ayatollah. If they, by themselves or more likely with mahAmlechCha assistance, succeed in breaking the Ayatollah like Qaddafi then their objectives will be more or less met. 

But we suspect that will just be the beginning. The Turks, the Arabs of different hues, Russians, chIna-s will all prop up their proxies with arms and there could be chaotic civil war situation. Unlike Syria, there is no Al Qaeda ally of the 1&2 in the waiting. However, with the vestiges of an older civilization and foundations for national identity, Iran might not go the way a Libya or an Eye-Rack. Rather, it would survive as a nation and pull together under a new regime. This will be a much weaker state but it is unlikely to be favorable to the unmatta-s. The best case scenario down such a track is the revival of the asura cult. 

On the other hand if Iran proves a harder nut to crack than the mUshAnuyAyin-s then it is more likely to draw the mahAmlechCha into a full blown conflict and another prolonged mess in the making: could Shi terrorists step in like in Eye-Rack?

> If the yudhha ends here, what do you think will be the impact on ahura's country?

This can be only answered if one can predict whether a credible counter alliance can form against the mahAmlechCha and their vassals and controller. Right now the only nation on earth that can nucleate such a confederation is the rUs. It has not shown that it can be a credible counterbalance to the mahAmlechCha alliance. To become such it needs chIna to whole heartedly join forces with it. Right now that is not the case. 

If in a few years that really comes about then the Islamic state in Iran will join that alliance for revenge. I think the objective of the mlechCha-s & their boss will be turn it into a Qaddafistan or Assadistan but I still suspect this state will survive in some form despite intense damage it might suffer in the near future.


> (Other nations) just want US not to be too harsh on them but mlecch being pirates cant control their sadism and blood lust and find alternative ways of greasing the mil ind complex

when the biggest bully on the block is many fold larger than you, you settle for the most favorable extortion regime. But the bully knowing he bash the hell out of you will do so when he pleases.

## War in guise of Peace 
The use of the cover of peace talks to launch a preemptive strike is a strategy that goes back to the mists of early human history. In light of the recent events in West Asia, one could interpret the rotten-soy backed dAnu-apara attack on rUs as another such. The corollary is nAri~Nga's delusions of being a peacemaker have likely been torpedoed with it.

The primary lesson from the ongoing conflict in West Asia is how much it points to the complicity of the Occident in making TSP a nuclear power. Then one must ask why they let it happen. The answer to that illuminates the situation of H.

In light of the conflict in West Asia, one can better understand the mysterious death of the Iranian Indian Homi Bhabha.


## Trump support on Iran
Will nAri~Nga's sheep-like base go with him or with jarilasUnu, who did a lot to get him the gaddi in the first place: America's Judaeo-Christian identity

As the implications of America's Judaeo-Christian identity play out, the nAri~NgapuruSha's base is clearly divided. If the conflict drags on without a clear endpoint, it will likely fracture, and the nAri~NgapuruSha's coalition will come apart. Wonder if someone like surasA will resign. His pakSha will face a midterm defeat and his rAj will be mostly a failure. Yet why is he pursuing what he is doing? While people will point to his big money neocon donors and the like, we believe this relates fundamentally to American identity, which is inextricably tied to the West Asian Mediterranean coast.


... jarilonmatta (not jarilasUnu) is a good example of a windvane-like MAGA man who spins around in tandem with his unmatta master, justifying every one of his acts. At least in the latter's case, it could be Apastiya. But jarilonmatta doesn't even have that excuse.

Tulsi has completely torched her reputation: Is it because she is eying future power, or the mUlavAtUla told her that they could place more than her reputation under a bunker-buster.

Wonder what the future of MAGA is? Will it get more energized in confluence with the neocons or will it fracture and the hastin-s will face a great setback in the midterms? Since the unmatta-pichChilaka's followers are more attached to him than to guys like jarilasUnu they will probably go with his mound of lies and u-turns. 

This will depend on the West Asian conflict and how it plays out. If that conflict that nAri~Nga has initiated on behalf of the mUlavAtUla-s fizzles out, it will probably survive and morph into a pernicious movement combining neo-neocon ideas and anti-immigrant sentiments.  If it drags even a bit, it will likely fracture and a jarilasUnu-like camp will strengthen.

duShTa-paTTinI is probably feeling rather left out and sore today that the unmatta pichChilaka lied his way to being the mlechCharAT only to do what she was promising to her controllers all along.

## USAID
The attack on USAID by the nAri~NgapuruSha is revealing stuff to the general public that the attentive students of mlechCha subversionist tactics knew long back. It was a purveyor of the shaNDamata in the desh and elsewhere under duShTa-piNDaka as many are just learning. Under mANikya+++(=Rubio)+++ it will swing in the direction of becoming a front for pretacharya.

Whereas duShTa-jarilaputra is more interested in internal affairs, this interesting discussion reveals many external evils of USAID that the discerning have long pointed out. There is a detailed account of the mahAmlechCha involvement in the destablization of pUrvava~Nga. Not said here but apparent to those interested is kejarin-nAma mahAdhUrta, whose defeat yesterday has temporarily neutralized this important threat right in the rAjadhAni.

## Deep state takeover

muShkavAn kastUrI, with his agents like mAhAmuShka, khorvaTIya and others, is trying to become the new mahAmlechCha deep state. Backed by obarAja and piNDaka's judicial appointees the gardabha-s will try to prevent their takeover.
