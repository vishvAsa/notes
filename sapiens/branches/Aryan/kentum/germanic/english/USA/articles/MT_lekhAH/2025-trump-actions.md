## War in guise of Peace 
The use of the cover of peace talks to launch a preemptive strike is a strategy that goes back to the mists of early human history. In light of the recent events in West Asia, one could interpret the rotten-soy backed dAnu-apara attack on rUs as another such. The corollary is nAri~Nga's delusions of being a peacemaker have likely been torpedoed with it.

The primary lesson from the ongoing conflict in West Asia is how much it points to the complicity of the Occident in making TSP a nuclear power. Then one must ask why they let it happen. The answer to that illuminates the situation of H.

## USAID
The attack on USAID by the nAri~NgapuruSha is revealing stuff to the general public that the attentive students of mlechCha subversionist tactics knew long back. It was a purveyor of the shaNDamata in the desh and elsewhere under duShTa-piNDaka as many are just learning. Under mANikya+++(=Rubio)+++ it will swing in the direction of becoming a front for pretacharya.

Whereas duShTa-jarilaputra is more interested in internal affairs, this interesting discussion reveals many external evils of USAID that the discerning have long pointed out. There is a detailed account of the mahAmlechCha involvement in the destablization of pUrvava~Nga. Not said here but apparent to those interested is kejarin-nAma mahAdhUrta, whose defeat yesterday has temporarily neutralized this important threat right in the rAjadhAni.

muShkavAn kastUrI, with his agents like mAhAmuShka, khorvaTIya and others, is trying to become the new mahAmlechCha deep state. Backed by obarAja and piNDaka's judicial appointees the gardabha-s will try to prevent their takeover.
