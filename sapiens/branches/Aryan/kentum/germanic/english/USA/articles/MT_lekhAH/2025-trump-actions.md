### hindu-misia
The Benveniste's files reveal something discerning observers catch: a deep hate among the liberal American prathamonmatta and core mahAmlechCha elite for the H.

### Boosterism
While all kinds of stuff regarding Apastiya the Benveniste is coming up from the new files, I wonder if anyone has dug up stuff regarding his part-coethnic, the well-known biologist Robert Trivers, who is one of Apastiya's staunch defenders. Apart from being a part coethnic, there are some things about Trivers that mirror Apastiya. While Trivers is a good scientist with some excellent contributions, he has a particularly exaggerated aura and reputation about him. I've heard people call him "one of the greatest biologists" (!), "most important biologist since Darwin(!) etc." This mirrors the mysterious reputation around Apastiya. Why did the mighty and the rich gravitate towards him who had no true, visible profession? At least Trivers was a decent biologist. It almost seems the reputation-building that happened for Trivers catapulted him into Apastiya's circle, and the two became entwined. One really wonders what Trivers was up to to call Apastiya a "person of integrity" -- it seems more than just a $40k gift.


An example from the files of the consistent boosterism  regarding the biologist Trivers. I believe he means "greatest thinkers": How and why did this reputation building happen for Trivers? He was a decent scientist but there were and are many like him and better. It is again notable it parallels the Beveniste's reputation among the rich and mighty...

## City vs Empire
The clash between the imperial court running the nAri~NgapuruSha and gardabha-run oligarchic city states -- megalopolises is beginning to shape up among the mahAmlechCha. This also fits the Spenglerian pattern well of the clash between the Caesar (nAri~Nga run by his controls) and the megalopolitan oligarchs backing the gardabha-s.

## Distraction

The mahAmlechCha situation is heating up: nAri~Nga and anUpa's actions are driving up unrest at home while building armies for war outside. Possibly, the idea is to trigger some wars so that the internal ferment is distracted and they can proceed with their internal agenda. But the internal ferment could end their electoral hopes before they achieve success in the wars.

For the pichChilaka's court, war will increasingly become the best option to come out of the mess that they are creating within and without. In a sense pichChilaka has become like his predecessor piNDaka -- a puttalikA run by maga-duShTa-s like gharaTTaka and  anUpa who plays to their jarilonmattAnuyAyin base.

The pichChilu~Nga is like an accelerant speeding many a geopolitical fire.

## Venezuela Maduro
While the mahAmlechCha have no real challengers and are like the big boy bullying little kids, their actions repeatedly solidify Natanyahoo's truism: "the arc of history bends towards power."

The H twtr seems split on the mahAmlechCha extraction of the strongman of upavenesiya. Some feel they should throw their lot with the mahAdaNDavant mahAmlechCha, others are with the underdog strongman, and yet others want to neutrally watch the fun. 

Whatever your position, it doesn't matter at all because, as stated in the last twt, all that matters is who wields the mahAdaNDa. If you don't have one, you have to sit quiet. 

However, the anxiety is understandable. Every such exploit of the a~NglamlechCha confederation is a reminder that they continue to dominate the world and will continue to undermine anyone who is wielding a smaller daNDa, or is trying to get one.

For H a lot of the anxiety comes from understanding that they lack a daNDa of any great size. This is illustrated daily by the inability to protect H in the neighborhood or even within. But sometimes it is good to come to terms with life in the margins.

## Discontent

As the civil year draws to a close, the regime of the pichChilaka and anUpa is increasingly looking like that of piNDaka in magnitude, even if the direction might be different. 

Barring the roaring "heritage" types, it does seem there is a broadly growing discontent among the mahAmlechCha, which suggests that the hastin-s will be overthrown by the gardabhin-s in elections in the coming year. This will weaken the capacity of the nAri~Nga to do anything substantial beyond harassing the weak with his Tonton Macoutes. 

<details><summary>विस्तारः (द्रष्टुं नोद्यम्)</summary>

Tonton Macoutes were a paramilitary and secret police force in Haiti, created in 1959 by dictator François "Papa Doc" Duvalier. Known as "Bogeymen," they enforced his regime through terror, assassinations, disappearances, and violence to suppress opposition. The group was disbanded in 1986 after his son's rule ended.

We suspect what is likely to happen is a pendulum swing that will bring much ferment to the mahAmlechCha. For one, the pichChilu~Nga or his duShTAnuyAyin-s would receive no further support from the minuscule H community.


## Forecast - tearing apart?
Source: [TW](https://x.com/blog_supplement/status/1986632412739100758)

It is quite possible that the xenophobic MAGA core will tear apart their coalition and bring down the hastin-s in the process. The question is how much of the navyonmAda, kR^iShNArAdhana, ShaNDamati and the like return with the gardabha-s. It is also possible that eventually the tech bros turn against the core MAGA and dump the hastin-s. That would be a good thing. Some people see everything by working out the theory and its predictions through observations. Some people need a "lived experience" of the theory before they can learn it. Perhaps, viveka will be in that category of learning it the hard way. Some here from our own pakSha want to dump on him for that. It may seem foolish, but they should stand by him for either way it will be a good thing.

## preta nationalist takeover
Just as the ShaNDa-s realized that they could take control of piNDaka and run the state on his behalf, a xenophobic preta nationalist cabal realized that they could do the same with nAri~Nga with anUpa as their frontman. Thus, we are squarely in the age of rule by puppet mlechCharAT-s in mahAmlechCha politics.


## viveka
While many here like to condemn viveka, we don't see him as part of the problem, but rather a symptom of the brewing trouble among the mahAmlechCha. 

Those who have studied the mUlavAtUla-s knew that they always adopted the strategy of hedging bets with both sides. That was a potentially viable strategy for the H. But they lacked the deep sense of self-nonself recognition and ingroup cohesion of the mUla-rakShasAdhaka-s.  Hence, when trouble comes, H were not able to cohesively respond in a way that helps their interests. 

Given the pichChilu~Nga's first term, it was a reasonable hedge to go with him as opposed to mahAhAsA, who definitely had a big anti-H agenda on her pakSha. More those who read the ground more closely realized that the lu~Nga was likely to win. 

However, this had to be tempered by the knowledge that a large constituency of nAri~Nga's pakSha hates H (svabhAva-vairam via pretonmAda), feels threatened by them (elite competition) or has a melanophobia. There was always a danger that faction would come to guide the nAri~Nga's actions. 

Initial signals like the Turtle, basil and anUpapatnI,  suggested that supporting nAri~nga might have paid off. But when viveka was fired and mahAmuShka was protected, it became clear that that faction would likely dominate this term. That's where we are now.


## Chaos
This is not informed political analysis but just a gut feeling: the pichChilaka might trigger much hardship and chaos in the near future. 

It might devolve in two directions,  
either by triggering a period of prolonged unrest/retrograde movement in his own land  
or an attempt to return it to some type of status quo via the loss of his pakSha. 

Certain players who are in plain sight to the discerning but too dangerous to be named will benefit either way.

## Epstein factor
I'm not deep into the Apastiya issue, but it does seem that, like war with Iran, it could fracture the younger base of the nAri~Nga. That said, it raises a few issues even to the casual observer: 

It was said that Apastiya was part of the intelligence (one can infer that the Judaeo-Christian apparatus was implied by that). Nobody to date has denied that. He had obvious connections to a shady uparimarakata intelligence agent who was involved in the very reconquest of that land. That guy was a conduit to the deepest connections among the mUlavAtula network.

Nobody has denied that he was very rich for a single-person investor with a small or absent staff, with little evidence for an expected career progression in that field. Where did he get all that money from? His close associates went to jail for clearly shady activities, and at least one died mysteriously in jail.

Many powerful Judaeo-Christian elites were his friends, and nobody questions that they hung out with him socially.

Let's give it to the turtle et al that he killed himself: he could have gotten a message from the uparimarkata-s that they were "burning" him and realized he had reached the end of his rope. 

Still, it is clear that the nAri~Nga is sweeping something under the rug is the biggest question what were his intelligence activities? They clearly don't want to reveal that thus make it go away. 

We see a certain kind of parallel to the Jonathan Pollard case. Why did they keep in jail for so long -- it was not as if his transmissions seriously crippled the mahAmlechCha based on what is publicly stated regarding this case. It is clear that something deeper that what is let out was leaked by him to his people. One possibility item among the hidden things could the US complicity in nuclear-arming TSP. But clearly there was more stuff more consequential to them that lost relevance only in the past decade, when they let him flee.

All that said, we believe that the Apastiya and Iran-bombing incidents indicate that nAri~Nga has been finally coopted by the Deep State. Probably, in return they will let him do deportations and satisfy the more MAWA faction of his base.

I do think it is not looking good for the nAri~Nga, but there is still time before the decisive elections and other things could happen which cause a change of course.

## Help to Israel
It is very clear that the mUlavAtUla-s are suppressing reports of their losses. Apparently, at least some of their military installations have suffered heavy damage, with many more deaths than they are admitting. This is part of the reason they are desperate for the mahAmlechCha to fight on their behalf. mahAmlechCha are already shoring up their astra-s and intelligence but still seem reluctant to join despite all the gorilla-thumping by the mlechCharAT.

## Iran
Having looked at the West Asian conflict over the past few days, it is becoming increasingly clear that the prathamonmatta objective is to do a Libya/Qaddafi on the Islamic state in Iran/Ayatollah. If they, by themselves or more likely with mahAmlechCha assistance, succeed in breaking the Ayatollah like Qaddafi then their objectives will be more or less met. 

But we suspect that will just be the beginning. The Turks, the Arabs of different hues, Russians, chIna-s will all prop up their proxies with arms and there could be chaotic civil war situation. Unlike Syria, there is no Al Qaeda ally of the 1&2 in the waiting. However, with the vestiges of an older civilization and foundations for national identity, Iran might not go the way a Libya or an Eye-Rack. Rather, it would survive as a nation and pull together under a new regime. This will be a much weaker state but it is unlikely to be favorable to the unmatta-s. The best case scenario down such a track is the revival of the asura cult. 

On the other hand if Iran proves a harder nut to crack than the mUshAnuyAyin-s then it is more likely to draw the mahAmlechCha into a full blown conflict and another prolonged mess in the making: could Shi terrorists step in like in Eye-Rack?

> If the yudhha ends here, what do you think will be the impact on ahura's country?

This can be only answered if one can predict whether a credible counter alliance can form against the mahAmlechCha and their vassals and controller. Right now the only nation on earth that can nucleate such a confederation is the rUs. It has not shown that it can be a credible counterbalance to the mahAmlechCha alliance. To become such it needs chIna to whole heartedly join forces with it. Right now that is not the case. 

If in a few years that really comes about then the Islamic state in Iran will join that alliance for revenge. I think the objective of the mlechCha-s & their boss will be turn it into a Qaddafistan or Assadistan but I still suspect this state will survive in some form despite intense damage it might suffer in the near future.


> (Other nations) just want US not to be too harsh on them but mlecch being pirates cant control their sadism and blood lust and find alternative ways of greasing the mil ind complex

when the biggest bully on the block is many fold larger than you, you settle for the most favorable extortion regime. But the bully knowing he bash the hell out of you will do so when he pleases.

Once predatory states have tasted blood and see world dominance within reach, they will exercise their power with much violence against the rest of the world. Not many understand a true picture of world history because they uncritically or emotionally follow the A~NglamlechCha narrative of it starting from their vishvavijaya down through the two world wars.

## War in guise of Peace 
The use of the cover of peace talks to launch a preemptive strike is a strategy that goes back to the mists of early human history. In light of the recent events in West Asia, one could interpret the rotten-soy backed dAnu-apara attack on rUs as another such. The corollary is nAri~Nga's delusions of being a peacemaker have likely been torpedoed with it.

The primary lesson from the ongoing conflict in West Asia is how much it points to the complicity of the Occident in making TSP a nuclear power. Then one must ask why they let it happen. The answer to that illuminates the situation of H.

In light of the conflict in West Asia, one can better understand the mysterious death of the Iranian Indian Homi Bhabha.


## Trump support on Iran
Will nAri~Nga's sheep-like base go with him or with jarilasUnu, who did a lot to get him the gaddi in the first place: America's Judaeo-Christian identity

As the implications of America's Judaeo-Christian identity play out, the nAri~NgapuruSha's base is clearly divided. If the conflict drags on without a clear endpoint, it will likely fracture, and the nAri~NgapuruSha's coalition will come apart. Wonder if someone like surasA will resign. His pakSha will face a midterm defeat and his rAj will be mostly a failure. Yet why is he pursuing what he is doing? While people will point to his big money neocon donors and the like, we believe this relates fundamentally to American identity, which is inextricably tied to the West Asian Mediterranean coast.


... jarilonmatta (not jarilasUnu) is a good example of a windvane-like MAGA man who spins around in tandem with his unmatta master, justifying every one of his acts. At least in the latter's case, it could be Apastiya. But jarilonmatta doesn't even have that excuse.

Tulsi has completely torched her reputation: Is it because she is eying future power, or the mUlavAtUla told her that they could place more than her reputation under a bunker-buster.

Wonder what the future of MAGA is? Will it get more energized in confluence with the neocons or will it fracture and the hastin-s will face a great setback in the midterms? Since the unmatta-pichChilaka's followers are more attached to him than to guys like jarilasUnu they will probably go with his mound of lies and u-turns. 

This will depend on the West Asian conflict and how it plays out. If that conflict that nAri~Nga has initiated on behalf of the mUlavAtUla-s fizzles out, it will probably survive and morph into a pernicious movement combining neo-neocon ideas and anti-immigrant sentiments.  If it drags even a bit, it will likely fracture and a jarilasUnu-like camp will strengthen.

duShTa-paTTinI is probably feeling rather left out and sore today that the unmatta pichChilaka lied his way to being the mlechCharAT only to do what she was promising to her controllers all along.

nAri~Nga caught in the grasp of the jarilaputra camp and the navyadhUrta-s decided either to please or anger both and also show some rearguard spine vis-a-vis the uparimarkata-s. The hard question to answer is whether this is the end or there is more to come, and when. We believe the ball is in the mUlamohita court and given their record they will be thinking up some new mischief.

## USAID
The attack on USAID by the nAri~NgapuruSha is revealing stuff to the general public that the attentive students of mlechCha subversionist tactics knew long back. It was a purveyor of the shaNDamata in the desh and elsewhere under duShTa-piNDaka as many are just learning. Under mANikya+++(=Rubio)+++ it will swing in the direction of becoming a front for pretacharya.

Whereas duShTa-jarilaputra is more interested in internal affairs, this interesting discussion reveals many external evils of USAID that the discerning have long pointed out. There is a detailed account of the mahAmlechCha involvement in the destablization of pUrvava~Nga. Not said here but apparent to those interested is kejarin-nAma mahAdhUrta, whose defeat yesterday has temporarily neutralized this important threat right in the rAjadhAni.

## Deep state takeover
Source: [TW](https://x.com/blog_supplement/status/1888466064876392518)

muShkavAn kastUrI, with his agents like mAhAmuShka, khorvaTIya and others, is trying to become the new mahAmlechCha deep state. Backed by obarAja and piNDaka's judicial appointees the gardabha-s will try to prevent their takeover.
