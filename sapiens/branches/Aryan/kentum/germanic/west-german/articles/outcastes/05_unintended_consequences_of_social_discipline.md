title = "05 The infamous fur coat, or the unintended consequences of social discipline"

+++

In the preceding two chapters our focus has been the dishonorable milieu itself. We have detailed the legal, economic, and social effects of dishonor in order to reconstruct the experience and self-identity of dishonorable people. We now turn to the logic of pollution in the minds of honorable artisans who labeled these groups as dishonorable. Artisans identified two main sources of dishonor pollution: contact with animal carcasses and involvement in the performance of criminal punishment. 

Artisans’ pollution anxieties surrounding carrion will be discussed in chapter . 

Here we are concerned with the transmission of pollution in the context of criminal justice. Guildsmen labeled bailiffs as dishonorable by associating them with the executioner. Augsburg’s bailiffs tried to ward off the attribution of dishonor by emphasizing that they did not assist the executioner. But this defense was futile, for in the minds of artisans dishonor permeated the entire sphere of criminal justice. 

Punishment meted out in the name of sovereign authorities \( *Obrigkeit*\) was central to artisans’ ideas about dishonor. The day-to-day administration of criminal justice produced a diffuse dishonor that spread far beyond the criminal who was being punished. Dishonor produced in the course of criminal punishments resulted not only in the clear-cut and spectacular infamy of the executioner and the condemned criminal on the scaffold. Dishonor also spread in directions unforeseen and *unintended * by the authorities, as they orchestrated ever more elaborate rituals of punishment in the early modern period. Governments often found that they could not contain the pollution their punishments unleashed. Dishonor came to affect anyone and anything involved in the process of punishment, polluting both persons and objects connected with criminal punishment, no matter how tenuous such a connection might be. 

This chapter examines how dishonor was produced, whom or what it affected, and how the spread of this dishonor impacted the administration of criminal justice and the authorities’ agenda of social discipline. We shall see that dishonor was

*The infamous fur coat*

both an instrument of and an obstacle to the social disciplining ambitions of early modern German governments. In some cases, governments could tap into and exploit the polluting power of dishonor in order to exercise social control over their subjects. In many other cases, however, dishonor pollution hampered the authorities’ ability to enforce the laws and police ordinances that were being promulgated in ever-increasing density in the early modern period. More often than not, dishonor pollution functioned to undermine governmental authority. 

INSTRUMENTS OF PUNISHMENT

The sight of gallows and scaffold were likely to evoke mixed feelings among early modern Augsburgers. On the one hand, the gallows was a source of collective honor to the citizenry. Travelers who passed the gallows on their way into the city knew they were entering a polity endowed with the privilege of ‘‘high justice.’’ In this sense, the physical structure of the gallows was a symbol of sovereignty and source of civic pride. Possession of a gallows even became a criterion of artisanal honor. In

*Punishment and healing*

 some rural linen-weavers from the environs of Augsburg tried to get the big-city weavers to recognize them as honorable guildsmen by demonstrating that their territory had its own ‘‘stocks and gallows.’’ On the other hand, while the possession of the gallows might instill pride, the structure itself could also inspire dread, because of the magical forces present there, and because of the danger of pollution that emanated from the entire site. Magical beliefs surrounding the gallows will be discussed in the next chapter. Here we are concerned with the gallows as a ‘‘conductor’’ of dishonor, polluting individuals who came into physical contact with it. Next to animal carcasses, the gallows was the physical object most permeated by dishonor. Hanging was the most dishonorable form of execution. When there were extenuating circumstances surrounding a crime, the city government ordered the delinquent to be beheaded ‘‘out of mercy with the wet hand’’ \( *aus Gnade mit nasser Hand*\). Criminals who were beheaded typically received an honorable burial in consecrated earth. The bodies of delinquents who were hanged ‘‘by the dry hand’’ \( *aus trockener Hand*\) were left exposed to the elements until they fell off the gibbet and then were buried beneath the gallows by the executioner’s men. The gallows was a site of special horror that honorable artisans took care to avoid.

To willfully come into contact with the gallows was a form of deviance that the artisans sanctioned severely. It was no trifling matter when the journeyman weaver Leonhard Nadler secretly went to the gallows outside the city walls in the summer of . Here he cut a toe off the corpse of a criminal who had been broken on the wheel and whose body now lay exposed at the site of execution. Nadler had been losing money gambling; he believed that carrying the toe of an executed criminal in his pocket when playing would bring him better luck. The guild reacted quickly. In July Nadler was called in for questioning before a committee of masters and journeymen. The parallels between Nadler’s deed and the work of the executioner were obvious. The objects Nadler had touched – the corpse, the wheel, the entire site of execution – were infamous. When Nadler admitted cutting off the toe, the weavers pronounced him dishonorable and forbade him to work. The city government, incidentally, arrested Nadler for witchcraft. The issue of dishonor played no role in the magistrates’ investigation, an illustration of the completely different priorities of guild and government in these matters. The guild was less concerned with preserving religious orthodoxy than with the purity of honor.

*The infamous fur coat*

Nadler’s offense was certainly an extreme deviation from the artisanal code of conduct, for he had gone far beyond merely touching the tools of punishment. Like the executioner, Nadler had mutilated a human body.

But simple touch already constituted a transgression. In  masters and journeymen of several Augsburg trades were punished by their guilds and journeymen’s associations because they had climbed on the scaffold while a beheading was taking place in order to get a better view. Even though these artisans did not touch the executioner, the malefactor, the sword or blood, and in no way became involved in the execution process, their physical contact with the scaffold in itself constituted a serious violation of the artisanal code of honor. This type of ritual pollution occurred at regular intervals throughout the early modern period. The consequences of such transgressions became more severe over time.

Gallows and scaffolds retained their polluting power long after an execution had taken place. Their contamination did not fade or evaporate with time and they could transmit dishonor even outside of any punitive context. Sometimes, however, artisans had no choice but to come into contact with the gallows. Stonemasons and carpenters were periodically called upon either to erect a new gallows or to renovate an existing one. On such occasions the risk of pollution was high. We saw in chapter  that honorable artisans explained the dishonor of linen-weavers and millers by claiming that these trades were required to provide the ladder to the gallows. The stonemasons and carpenters who actually built the gallows had to take care that they did not share the fate of dishonorable millers or linen-weavers. 

Elaborate precautions were necessary to contain the dishonor that permeated the gallows. In  Augsburg’s gallows needed to be restored, so the council ordered the entire guilds of stonemasons and carpenters, masters and journeymen, to do the repairs collectively. ‘‘All carpenters and stonemasons were ordered to do the work together, so that no one \[master\] would be able to insult the next.’’ Such collective work was the common procedure for building or renovating the gallows in many

regions, and as we shall see below, guildsmen developed mechanisms of control over fellow craftsmen that tended to promote a common artisanal culture throughout the empire. The collective gallows-building ritual dated back at least to . In that year the carpenters of Nuremberg, masters and journeymen, about  men altogether, repaired the gallows. When the work was done they formed a procession back into town accompanied by pipers. When they reached the market place, minstrels played while the artisans were regaled with bread and wine at the expense of the city council.

The ceremonial aspects of such processions became more elaborate in the course of the early modern period. The processions were designed to achieve maximum publicity. In  the carpenters and stonemasons of Nuremberg marched from their guild halls past the town hall, the largest churches, and through the market place, to the music of pipes and drums, while each artisan proudly displayed the tools that were the trademark of his craft. Sometimes representatives of the city government participated in the procession. When the city of Frankfurt repaired its gallows in  a city council member accompanied the blacksmiths’ guild to the gallows. The councilman climbed onto the scaffold and nailed one of the chains to the gallows himself. In the late seventeenth and especially in the eighteenth century, the role of representatives of government became more pronounced. In

 Augustus Giese, a city councilor in Husum in north Germany, and a hostile observer of artisanal customs, described the procedure with sarcasm: When a new gallows must be . . . erected, what a commotion, before the work can begin. So that no one must bear the alleged mark of infamy alone, the entire carpenters’ guild must be together. The mayor or councilor, or whoever has authority there must strike the first blow to the wood. Beer must be served to give the workers courage for such a dangerous job. I am surprised that smelling salts are not applied to their nostrils.

When the gallows needed repairs in the small territorial town of Weickersheim on the river Tauber in , the mayor, the city syndic, and other municipal officials led the procession on horseback as the guildsmen marched out to the construction site. At the gallows, the mayor addressed the crowd. The mayor declared the gallows to be honorable in the name and by force of the sovereignty of

his territorial lord. After repeating this formula three times, the mayor guaranteed that no one would impugn the honor of the artisans who worked at the site. Then the mayor and other municipal officials touched the gallows, whereupon the artisans began their work.

Sometimes these festivals developed into lavish extravaganzas involving hundreds of participants. Perhaps the most elaborate gallows-building festival ever held took place in Frankfurt in . Twelve hundred artisans worked on the gallows for five days and concluded their work with a celebration at which they allegedly consumed , sausages and drank , *Ohm * of beer and wine.

How are these rituals to be interpreted? The artisans’ strategy to contain dishonor operated in three ways. One idea was stated explicitly by contemporaries. 

The artisans strongly emphasized the collective nature of the enterprise. Safety lay in numbers. If all guild members participated in the repairs, no individual master would be vulnerable to accusations of dishonor by his fellow artisans. But such collective work only protected against insults from within the guild. The guildsmen were still vulnerable to challenges from outside their guilds, as were the linen-weavers and millers. The guildsmen countered this danger by orchestrating pompous public displays. When their processions passed in front of the town hall, the artisans emphasized that they were fulfilling their civic obligations. The processions were very similar to other artisanal parades, such as guild processions on Corpus Christi day, or the processions of striking journeymen through the city they were boycotting. The artisans deliberately cultivated maximum publicity to force a positive interpretation of what might otherwise have been construed as a defaming action. But such pomp and public display were not enough to contain infamy, especially as the artisans’ fear of pollution by dishonor grew stronger in the course of the early modern period. By the late seventeenth and especially by the eighteenth century the participation of the authorities had become indispensable. By declaring the site to be honorable and laying hands on the dangerous object, governmental officials made it safe for artisans to touch. The officials were, of course, of higher estate and thus more honorable than the artisans whom they were shielding. In free imperial cities the officials were for the most part patricians, in territorial cities the judges might have been aristocratic representatives of the territorial lord. By

orchestrating and participating in these gallows-building rituals, the authorities managed to exploit dishonor symbolically to enhance their own status and honor. 

The message communicated in such gallows-building rituals was that persons of high honor were somehow immune to the contaminating effects of dishonor. More than immune, persons of high estate actually could cleanse an object of the dishonor that permeated it. This is an idea that we will encounter in other contexts. 

In spite of such elaborate measures aimed at containing and neutralizing dishonor, handling the tools of punishment remained a precarious and risky affair that always bore the possibility of pollution. The pillory, like the gallows, was an important symbol of lordship. Only sovereign territories endowed with ‘‘high justice’’ had their own pillory. Unlike the gallows beyond the city walls, the pillory was usually located at the heart of the city. In Augsburg the pillory consisted of a balcony on the corner of the city hall overlooking the central square. The offender was exhibited standing on the balcony with an iron chain around the neck. The

*The infamous fur coat*

polluting potential of the pillory is illustrated by a dishonor conflict that erupted in the small south German town of Mindelheim in  during the renovation of the town’s pillory. The iron railing surrounding Mindelheim’s pillory needed to be replaced, and so the city council commissioned the local metal-workers’ guild to make the necessary repairs. This work was fraught with danger, for the pillory, like gallows and scaffold, was a contaminated site that was infused with the dishonor of the criminals who were punished there, and with the dishonor of the executioner who typically performed these punishments. Like the gallows, then, the pillory was at one and the same time a source of collective civic honor and an intensely polluting object, a source of individual dishonor for the persons who were punished there. To be exposed at the pillory was not a minor punishment. It was a defamatory honor punishment reserved for only the most serious criminals who had been convicted of a felony or capital offense. Criminals who were spared execution were often exposed at the pillory instead. This honor punishment frequently occurred in combination with a physical punishment, such as whipping, branding, or mutilation. Even without an additional physical punishment, however, the exhibition at the pillory alone conferred a formal legal infamy \( *infamia* *iuris*\), which, in the words of the historian Richard van Du¨lmen, resulted in a kind of ‘‘social death’’ for the offender. Invariably, after the criminal had spent the specified amount of time at the pillory, he or she was banished from the territory.

The Mindelheim authorities orchestrated the renovation of their pillory along the same lines as the typical gallows-building ritual. It was a public and festive occasion in which the metal-workers guild performed their repairs collectively with pomp and circumstance before an audience of several hundred spectators. Everything seemed to be going smoothly, when one artisan fatefully misjudged the situation. The work was almost completed, when one of the guildsmen, Tobias Haüserer, jokingly took the iron chain and neck ring with which offenders were attached to the pillory and tossed it at a fellow artisan. This artisan, however, was not amused, so Tobias tried to appease him by placing the metal ring around his own neck. Wearing the metal ring, Tobias presented himself to the audience watching the on-going repairs and exclaimed that ‘‘on this day, everything is permitted.’’

He was mistaken. The public and collective nature of the ritual did allow the guildsmen to enter a space which was normally off limits to them; however, it did not give permission to *play * with dishonor. Guildsmen were expected to perform this dangerous work with the appropriate decorum, for dishonor was never a joking

matter. Tobias’s fellow guildsmen described his behavior in the following terms: he

‘‘had the nerve, to take a ring of shame \[ *Schandring*, e.g. the neck ring\], which did not need to be repaired, which has been hanging on this pillory for many years, and which has been used by the executioner to attach many malefactors and to disgrace them . . .’’ and to throw it at another artisan and attach himself to it in front of a large audience. Tobias’s fateful misinterpretation had disastrous consequences for him. As a guild master Tobias was a member of the town council. His ‘‘shameful license’’ demonstrated that he was ‘‘forgetful of honor.’’ He was excluded from the council, his guild expelled him, and he was forbidden to work. His mistake cost him his livelihood and social identity as a guildsman and a citizen. 

THE INFAMOUS FUR COAT

Gallows, scaffold, and pillory were spectacular, public symbols of sovereignty and the authority to punish. Dishonor also permeated more modest, mundane tools of punishment hidden from public view within the Augsburg dungeon. In their management of equipment and space within the dungeon, Augsburg’s governors attempted a delicate balancing act of exploiting the potential of dishonor as an instrument of coercion and yet preventing its uncontrolled spread. An inventory taken in  of all the equipment in the dungeon revealed that among the possessions of the dungeon was a fur coat which was associated with a peculiar tradition in Augsburg’s penal culture: ‘‘Even honorable prisoners and residents, who have been imprisoned for a small infraction, and not for a maleficent or serious crime, are forced without distinction of person or of the nature of their crime, to appear \[to be interrogated\] wearing the fur coat.’’ The result of this practice was that these persons now had a stigma attached to them. Upon their release they were defamed as someone who had been forced to wear the ‘‘thief ’s fur coat’’ \( *diebs pelz*\). 

To prevent this stigmatizing effect, the city government decreed that in the future when honorable citizens were arrested for minor offenses they should be allowed to bring their own furs from home. Thus they could protect themselves from the

‘‘cold and frost’’ of the dungeon without suffering the dishonoring effects of having worn the ‘‘thief ’s fur coat.’’ Only prisoners accused of capital offenses would still undergo the humiliation and disgrace of facing their patrician interrogators wearing the infamous coat.

When the city councilors decreed that serious criminals would still be required to wear the *diebs pelz * during their interrogations, they were undoubtedly aware of the leverage and psychological pressure such humiliating practices allowed them to exert, and it is likely they did not want to relinquish such a powerful instrument of coercion entirely. The policy they developed for the use of the thief ’s coat is typical

of their general strategy for the management of dishonor in the judicial process. 

They made distinctions between those offenders whose honor needed to be protected and those prisoners whose honor was expendable or who, from the councilors’ perspective, had no honor to begin with. This distinction between prisoners of different ‘‘quality’’ was mirrored by a complex division of labor among the bailiffs, beadles, and dungeon guards assigned to guard and punish them. In this way, the authorities tried to mark off and insulate an explicitly dishonorable group of offenders and their guards, and within this infamous sector of the penal economy, the authorities set out to exploit dishonor as an instrument of social control to its fullest potential. 

THE COERCIVE POTENTIAL OF DISHONOR POLLUTION

In those punishments which the authorities *intended * to be permanently dishonoring, they deliberately cast the executioner, the most dishonorable servant in their employ, in the main role. In  the Augsburg city council orchestrated an elaborate degradation ritual to punish a city official who had embezzled funds. 

‘‘Although he deserved the rope,’’ a chronicler commented, the official was forced to sit on a chair beneath a bay window of the town hall from which governmental decrees were typically proclaimed, and then ‘‘the hangman placed the skinner’s knife under his chin, so that he had to look up, and so with great shame and ridicule he was made infamous.’’ In this ritual, the government tapped into two sources of dishonor, reinforcing the polluting effect of the executioner’s touch by likening the offender to skinner’s carrion. 

Authorities could tap into dishonor in viciously creative ways. In sixteenth-century Ofen, women who had committed sexual offenses were forced to do a public dance with the executioner on the town square; men were forced to dance with prostitutes.+++(5)+++ It was not necessary to introduce such grotesque refinements, however, in order to defame the offender. Exhibition at the pillory was the standard honor punishment that explicitly conferred legal infamy. Typically, the executioner escorted delinquents to the pillory and performed any additional bodily punishments there. Such punishments were extraordinarily effective. 

In  some journeymen engaged in a drunken brawl with the city guards in Munich, for which they received the very stiff penalty of banishment. They were escorted to the city limits by the executioner. In a petition to the Holy Roman Emperor in which they

I deliberately do not use the term ‘‘carnivalesque.’’ According to Mikhail Bakhtin, ‘‘carnivalesque laughter’’ is ambivalent; destruction is counterbalanced by regeneration. See Bakhtin, *Rabelais and his World *\(Bloomington, \), pp. – But there was nothing regenerative about this type of punishment. The vicious humor of honor punishments was purely destructive. For further examples of the use of humor and the grotesque in honor punishments, see C.

. Marginal drawing in city council protocol from . The rope and switches are a symbolic representation of an honor punishment intended to make the offender legally infamous. Instead of hanging a thief, the council pardoned him ‘‘to be exposed at the pillory and publicly denounced. The executioner then threw a rope around his neck.’’

He was whipped while wearing the rope and then banished. 

begged him to remove the infamy they had thus contracted, we get a sense of what happened to people after being subjected to an honor punishment: they were

‘‘avoided by everyone,’’ and could no longer practice their trade. In a similar petition from , a journeyman imprisoned in Frankfurt in the aftermath of the Fettmilch Uprising, described how he was bound in iron bands and chains \(in many cases *iron * as opposed to *wooden * restraints seem to be a significant symbol of infamy\), and then was publicly whipped out of town. As a result of this punishment, the journeyman reported, he was now living as a vagrant, ‘‘wandering around in great sorrow and spending my life in misery.’’ In addition to causing the loss of livelihood, citizenship, and residency, such punishments also had a devastating emotional impact. In a petition from , a retailer from Augsburg described how he felt after he was exposed on the pillory: ‘‘. . . after having endured public ridicule, I was banished from the city . . . I am taking this great ridicule, which I, as an honorable man, had to suffer innocently, more and more to heart as time passes.

*The infamous fur coat*

It is becoming utterly unbearable.’’ The subjective effect of these punishments seems to have been a kind of shattering of identity. 

The extreme vulnerability of their subjects’ honor provided governments with a powerful handle of coercion. The authorities exploited their subjects’ pollution anxieties to ensure compliance of the condemned criminal on the scaffold. Even in the face of death, offenders remained acutely sensitive to dishonor. To encourage the criminal’s cooperation in what always remained a precarious ritual, the authorities could reduce the infamy of execution by variations in procedure. The most important distinction was between dishonorable hanging and the somewhat less dishonorable beheading. Violent crimes committed out in the open, such as manslaughter, were typically punished by beheading, whereas hidden and therefore more treacherous and ignominious crimes, such as theft or treason, were punished by hanging. But the magistrates were not bound by this rule of thumb. They could consider family background and intercessions on behalf of the condemned, or reward voluntary confession or expressions of repentance by ‘‘pardoning’’ the delinquent whose offense theoretically merited hanging to be beheaded instead. On the other hand, if the criminal did not cooperate or had committed a particularly heinous crime, the authorities could intensify dishonor by hanging him or her higher than usual or by using a chain instead of a rope – most likely because a chain, more enduring than rope, ensured that the body would be exposed longer to public view. 

The authorities calculatedly parceled out dishonor \(and pain\) according to the

‘‘social capital’’ of the felon. Gerd Schwerhoff coined the phrase ‘‘social capital,’’

expanding on Pierre Bourdieu’s definition of honor as ‘‘symbolic capital,’’ to describe an individual’s rootedness in the community. Social capital is not equivalent to social status; a very humble member of the urban community could have more social capital than a wealthy foreign merchant. Social capital refers to offenders’ level of social integration. Did they have family in town? Were neighbors and fellow guild members willing to intercede on their behalf, or were they strangers with no stake in the community? Would anyone else be affected if the authorities meted out punishment with the full harshness of the law?

A few examples will illustrate how authorities took such factors into account when reaching a judgment. In  Joachim Elsesser, member of a reputable merchant family, attempted to poison his wife and embezzled public funds. For this crime, a chronicler observed, ‘‘he deserved to be torn with red hot tongs and to be dragged to the scaffold . . . to be broken on the wheel and then, while still living, to be quartered.’’

Elsesser did not suffer this punishment, however. ‘‘An honorable council considered the numerous intercessions on his behalf by persons of high and low estate. Out of mercy, the council condemned him be led . . . to the scaffold and to be executed by the

sword and bloody hand.’’ In , the patrician connection of one city official condemned to death for fraud mitigated the infamy of his execution. He was hanged, the customary punishment for theft, but ‘‘because his wife was of patrician background, he was not stripped of the cloak he was wearing on the gallows as other thieves were. And the next day he was taken down from the gallows and buried in the cemetery by the grave-diggers.’’ Given the role of clothing in conferring social identity in early modern society, this was a significant gesture on the part of the authorities. Executioners claimed the clothing of executed criminals as part of their customary emoluments, so that corpses were typically left exposed on the gallows in various states of undress. Nudity was part of the degradation process. The preceding two cases seem to be clear examples of class justice. Both men were members of the social elite of the city. But the magistrates exercised similar ‘‘mercy’’

for more modest offenders. In  the council pardoned an impoverished weaver and notorious thief. Instead of being hanged, he was beheaded. A chronicler commented: ‘‘He was supposed to be hanged, but because of his many children, out of mercy he was executed by the sword.’’

The authorities, then, had a varied palette at their disposal in orchestrating the execution ritual. Hanging or beheading, rope or chain, additional refinements \(red hot tongs, etc.\), length of time the body remained exposed, and method of disposal were all variables which the authorities could manipulate to communicate the nuances of dishonor. The reactions of condemned criminals demonstrate to what extent government could exploit the coercive potential of such symbolism. In the early seventeenth century, a Nuremberg cleric who ministered to the condemned recorded how he and another clergyman visited two thieves in the dungeon to inform them that they would be beheaded instead of hanged: ‘‘when they heard the happy news that they had received a merciful sentence, they both fell on their knees and thanked God . . . They also thanked us, kissing our hands . . . beside themselves with joy . . . they thanked the authorities for a merciful judgment . . .’’ Uwe Danker interprets such emotional scenes as an expression of the ‘‘total’’ control the early modern state could exercise within a very limited sphere over an individual in its grip. ‘‘The early modern state was not totalitarian, because it could not realize its all-encompassing will to regulate . . . but when an individual prisoner was completely at the mercy of this will to discipline, the state could achieve total domination.’’ Danker is referring to the way the authorities obtained condemned crimi-

nals’ obedience by manipulating their religious fears \(which we will discuss in the next chapter\), but the same can be said about how the authorities instrumentalized the ideology of honor. 

Even when a suspect had escaped the authorities’ physical grasp, the authorities made use of dishonor symbolism to defame a delinquent at a distance. To induce military deserters to turn themselves in, the government orchestrated a public degradation ritual. The name of the deserter was proclaimed three times to the beat of the drum. The soldier was ordered to return to the flag he had deserted, or else his name would be publicly attached to the gallows. If he failed to appear, the executioner pinned a placard with the name of the deserter to the gallows in a public ceremony. This placard remained attached to the gallows until the deserter surrendered or was apprehended. This ceremony was extraordinarily effective. 

Deserters frequently turned themselves in and submitted to severe corporal punishment if the government agreed to conduct a ceremony in which their name was removed from the gallows and their honor restored. In  the parents of the deserter Caspar Wu¨stle negotiated such an exchange on behalf of their son. When the young man turned himself in to the Augsburg authorities the city government ordered his name removed from the gallows by the executioner in a formal military ritual. Wu¨stle was to be whipped for three days in a row to the beat of the drum. 

Thereupon he would receive an honorable discharge.

PUNISHMENT AND THE DIVISION OF LABOR

Dishonor could obviously be instrumentalized as a powerful weapon against those persons the authorities *chose * to defame. But the aim of this weapon was not precise, so that dishonor pollution threatened to spread in an uncontrolled manner. We have already alluded to government’s attempt to insulate dishonor by instituting a division of labor in criminal punishment between those officers who performed explicitly dishonoring tasks and those whose duties theoretically left them unde-filed. But how effective was this policy of containment? 

In , Anthoni Hefelin, a bailiff in the small duchy of Hohen Embs, petitioned the emperor to cleanse him of infamy. Hefelin could pinpoint the exact moment when he had become dishonorable. When a local church robber was condemned to death, Hefelin was called upon to ‘‘lay my hands on him, putting him in chains, and unchaining him.’’ This particular act of touching and chaining a felon or ‘‘malefactor’’ dishonored him in the eyes of local artisans who, from that moment on, no longer associated with him and refused to apprentice his children in their honorable guilds. In this case, the bailiff’s dishonor was undisputed. Authorities and artisans agreed that those bailiffs who touched a ‘‘malefactor,’’ e.g. a criminal who had

*Punishment and healing*

committed a capital offense, thereby took part in the execution process and participated in the dishonor of the executioner. 

Constant vigilance was necessary to shore up the symbolic boundary which separated infamous officers from other public servants. When an over-eager bailiff tied the hands of a malefactor on the way to his beheading in , making himself dishonorable by this act, he was fired immediately. Judicial torture posed considerable practical problems for authorities trying to contain dishonor. Torturing a suspect fell within the duties of the executioner and was therefore a clearly dishonorable task. In , the bailiffs attempted to distance themselves from the executioner by requesting to be excused from escorting prisoners to be tortured. 

The government decreed that they should deliver the prisoner to the interrogation chamber, but if the executioner, who was waiting in a separate room, was actually called in to show the delinquent the instruments of torture – this act of psycho-terror, literally called the *Territion*, was defined as the first level of torture – then the bailiffs would be free to go. The newly ‘‘maleficent’’ \( *malfizisch*, i.e. infamous\) prisoner would be returned to his cell by the explicitly dishonorable dungeon guards.

As governments subdivided the tasks associated with criminal punishment, this was reflected in a proliferation of terms used to designate different types of police officers. These designations spanned the gamut from the euphemistic, to the neutral, to the intentionally defaming. Police officers might be called ‘‘servant of the council’’ \( *Ratsdiener*\), ‘‘servant of the court’’ \( *Gerichtsdiener*\), both relatively honorific. *Amtsmann, Amtsknecht, * *Stadtknecht, * or *Stadtdiener*, which I translate as ‘‘bailiff’’, were somewhat more neutral. The terms *Almosenknecht *\(welfare servant\), and *Bettelknecht *\(beggars’ warden\) designated those officers who rounded up foreign beggars. The *Scherge *\(sergeant\), *Blutscherge *\(blood-sergeant\), and *Malefiz-Scherge * or *Malefiz-knecht *\(sergeant or servant for malefactors\) were explicitly dishonorable. *Diebs-faher *\(thief-catcher\) was intentionally insulting.

*The infamous fur coat*

signations overlapped in meaning. Since the duties of law officers differed from city to city, even contemporaries were confused about what each term implied. Local authorities frequently inquired with one another as to the exact tasks of bailiffs or constables in a particular locality. Contemporaries obviously felt a certain discomfort in *naming * law officers and the duties they performed. 

Despite such delicacy in naming officers of the law and the tasks they performed, the containment of dishonor ultimately failed. According to an officer who styled himself as a ‘‘bailiff in civil affairs’’ \( *Amtmann in civilibus*\), ‘‘the common folk and especially the artisans do not make any distinctions, but generically take the word ‘bailiff’ to mean ‘criminal bailiff’.’’ Contagious dishonor was produced not only in cases of capital punishment and torture, but in lesser cases as well. We will examine a few cases of ritual pollution and insult prosecutions, to illustrate the proliferating criteria of infamy and the logic according to which artisans attributed dishonor. In  Hans Ho¨zl, a master glazier from the small Bavarian town of Aichach, married a woman whose ‘‘relative’’ had served as a bailiff. The exact family relationship between the glazier’s wife and the bailiff does not become clear in the records; however, the bailiff was not a member of her immediate family. 

Ho¨zl could prove that this bailiff had never laid hands on a ‘‘malefactor.’’ The bailiff was dishonorable nonetheless, the guildsmen claimed, because even if he had never personally touched a malefactor, ‘‘if the case arose’’ he would have to do so, reason enough to consider him dishonorable. By extension, Ho¨zl’s wife who was related to the bailiff was dishonorable; by marrying her the glazier himself had become tainted with the bailiff’s dishonor, and so he should be excluded. In a similar vein, the Augsburg rope-makers in  impugned the honor of a city guard – an office which had never before been categorized as dishonorable –

claiming ‘‘in case \( *casu quo*\) one or the other malefactor should escape the hands of the executioner, these officers must catch, grasp, and lead such fugitives.’’ These situations had never actually arisen, but in the artisans’ minds, the ‘‘potentiality’’

was dishonor enough. 

In dishonor conflicts, insults, and street brawls, artisans identified a set of markers that indicated whether a candidate was dishonorable. When the Augsburg weaver Johann Vogel married the daughter of a bailiff from neighboring Landsberg in , his fellow guildsmen, predictably, declared him dishonorable. Though Landsberg authorities attested that their bailiffs were honorable \(‘‘they never laid hands on a malefactor’’\), Augsburg’s weavers set out to prove otherwise. They sent a delegation of masters to Landsberg with a questionnaire to put to regular citizens \(as opposed to an official government spokesman\) about the status of bailiffs in their city. Their questionnaire yielded the desired result: Landsberg bailiffs were dishonorable, because they lived in a city-owned apartment which contained stocks

and chains. Vogel countered that honorable bailiffs and dishonorable sergeants lived in separate quarters. Bailiffs did keep shackles in their dwelling, but they were made of wood, not iron – the significance of this distinction being that wood was used on civil offenders, iron on malefactors. Unconvinced, the weavers maintained a boycott of Vogel’s shop at least until , when his case disappears from the records.

In  the bookbinders produced the same type of evidence to demonstrate the dishonorable origins of one of their apprentices. A group of bookbinders traveled to Andechs, the hometown of the questionable apprentice, to investigate his background. Peering into his father’s dwelling, they found – so they claimed – a regular chamber of horror, replete ‘‘with all sorts of instruments, as you would see with a beadle, such as chains, handcuffs, and *salvo honore * an ox-tail whip.’’ The fact that the bailiff handled such tools was proof enough of his dishonor.

Artisans identified bailiffs’ uniforms as a visible sign of their dishonor. German bailiffs wore multi-colored liveries, usually in the official colors of the city or territory they served. In Augsburg, bailiffs wore liveries with white, red, and green stripes, in the colors of Augsburg’s coat of arms. Badges and banners in white, red, and green expressed political identity and civic pride. The bailiff’s uniforms were meant to symbolize the sovereign authority of the magistrate whom they served, but artisans read a different meaning in bailiffs’ heraldic colors. 

Bailiffs, they claimed, ‘‘are everywhere kept separate from other honorable people. 

So that they may immediately be recognizable to all, especially to strangers, such beadles and bailiffs must always wear special liveries . . . This shows that they are not equal to other honorable people, and do not participate in civic affairs.’’ This interpretation of the meaning of the uniform had direct impact on face-to-face interactions in the street. In , as an Augsburg bailiff returned home after an evening in the tavern, a soldier taunted him: ‘‘Where are you going, striped coat?’’

Drawing his dagger, the bailiff told the soldier to ‘‘stop mocking the striped cloak, for it is my Lord’s livery.’’ A knife fight ensued. An intriguing aspect of this encounter is that the bailiff was ridiculed by a soldier, who was himself wearing a uniform \(although not striped\). Obviously not any uniform, but only the multi-colored uniform of officers of the law signified dishonor. Striped uniforms as a sign of defiled status gained wide cultural currency. Ruth Mellinkoff has documented how late medieval and early modern painters employed parti-colored and striped clothing as a symbol of infamy. Infidels, minstrels, court jesters, and most typically the tormentors and executioners of Christ were depicted wearing such attire.

*The infamous fur coat*

In contrast to sumptuary legislation which imposed special identifying costume upon prostitutes, Jews, and executioners to signify their defiled status, the authorities certainly did not intend to defame the officers who wore their city colors. Much to the contrary, the uniform was meant to communicate authority and status. But the meaning of such signs was not fixed and could not simply be imposed from above. Meaning remained fluid and emerged in everyday interactions. What the authorities intended as a prestige symbol was transvalued into a stigma symbol in social practice. As in the case of gallows and pillory, the city’s heraldic colors were a source of honor and pride to the collectivity, but they became a source of dishonor and ridicule when they were attached to an individual. 

DISOBEDIENCE AND THE OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE

According to Gerhard Oestreich’s model of social disciplining, territorial lords succeeded in ‘‘disciplining’’ their officer corps and civil service during the seventeenth century. This ‘‘disciplining of the staff’’ was a precondition for the much more far-reaching ‘‘fundamental disciplining’’ of society in the eighteenth century. Oestreich was writing about army officers and upper-level civil servants, not about the low-level policemen on whom the actual implementation of the state’s morals offensive depended. To what extent discipline was imposed upon and internalized by the upper echelons of the new standing armies and bureaucracies is a question we cannot address here. At the lower end of the scale, however, dishonor pollution presented a major obstacle to a ‘‘disciplining of the staff.’’ As we have seen, artisans were master casuists when it came to explaining why a police officer should be considered dishonorable. As artisans continually identified new criteria of infamy, dishonor spread beyond the explicitly dishonorable sector of the penal economy to affect all public servants involved in criminal justice. The bailiffs, who as we have seen were recruited from the artisanal milieu, shared the guildsmen’s pollution anxieties. Attempting to insulate themselves from dishonor, law officers frequently balked at carrying out the commands of the state authorities who employed them. 

Such an embarrassing episode occurred when Private Wu¨stle, the hapless deserter, turned himself in to the Augsburg authorities so that his name would be removed from the gallows. The stage was set for his whipping to occur, drums were set up in front of the town hall, but the punishment could not proceed because the two corporals who were ordered to administer the actual whipping refused.

*Punishment and healing*

Wu¨stle’s name had been attached to the gallows, the corporals explained. Regardless of the fact that by this time his name had already been removed, he could not be considered honorable until flags were swung over him in a formal military ritual to remove the infamy he had contracted. To whip Wu¨stle in his present state would dishonor them, the corporals declared, and result in their expulsion from their honorable regiment. In exasperation, the Augsburg government postponed the whipping of Private Wu¨stle. The council ordered flags to be swung over Private Wu¨stle, and finally the whipping was administered and Wu¨stle was released. 

Meanwhile the two recalcitrant corporals were to be punished for their disobedience.

Such disobedience occurred not only among military personnel, but also among Augsburg’s bailiffs who resisted administering punishments they feared would taint their honor. In  the city government had to threaten to fire their bailiffs to force them to administer a private beating within the confines of the prison to a delinquent whom the authorities had categorized as a ‘‘civil’’ offender – in other words, he was not a dishonorable ‘‘malefactor.’’ The fear of contracting dishonor made the bailiffs less than willing instruments of governmental authorities, so that the magistrates’ social disciplining agenda was sometimes thwarted by the disobedience of their own staff. Reports like this cast new light on the image of the

‘‘well-ordered police state’’ that emerges from the edicts and mandates of the time. 

TORTURE AND THE EXECUTIONER’S TOUCH

In addition to the potential disobedience of their staff, the authorities were often confronted with the fact that contact with the criminal justice system defamed prisoners, regardless of the authorities’ intentions. Dishonor pollution resulting from judicial torture is a particular case in point. Beginning in the early seventeenth century, artisans began to expel fellow guildsmen who had been subjected to torture in the course of a criminal investigation, even when they were pronounced innocent by the authorities. By the sixteenth century judicial torture at the hands of the executioner had become an integral part of the criminal justice system. In the

‘‘inquisitorial’’ procedure, a confession by the suspect was the ‘‘queen of proofs.’’

Indeed, a confession was indispensable for a conviction and torture was considered

a legitimate means of securing it. According to contemporary legal interpretation, torture was not a punishment, it was a means of finding the truth. If the suspect endured torture without confessing, he had cleared himself of suspicion. Prosecution ended; the prisoner was released. He had vindicated himself in the eyes of the law.

He had also in some sense been absolved of sin. Judicial torture and the confession it elicited were understood as a kind of secular parallel to the sacrament of confession and penance. The language used to describe the effect of torture is evocative of religious purification. Suspects who withstood torture were typically described as having ‘‘purged’’ themselves. A legal report concerning a journeyman who had been tortured but found innocent concluded: *post torturam absolutus* *est*. In  a journeyman carpenter who suffered torture without confessing claimed ‘‘I have cleansed myself by means of the hardest torture, and saved my innocence and my life.’’ Such language reflects a positive attitude towards pain common to late medieval and early modern culture. From the Christian point of view, pain had a purifying, indeed salvific effect. Lyndal Roper has argued that the mystical identification with the sufferings of Christ typical of Catholic Counter-Reformation piety influenced attitudes towards pain in the context of criminal justice. She suggests that city councilors who interrogated prisoners saw torture as

‘‘a kind of medicine of salvation’’ that helped the suspect achieve grace. Artisans, however, did not share this belief in the cleansing effect of torture – or rather, the religious implications of torture were simply not relevant in the context of artisanal honor. With increasing frequency in the seventeenth century, torture victims’

torments did not end with their release. According to the artisans, torture at the hands of the executioner left an indelible mark of infamy on the victim. This infamy was not the result of a criminal act or the resulting punishment. Torture itself made infamous, regardless of the guilt or innocence of the prisoner. Here we find that Christian notions of purity and sin clash with artisanal ideas about honor and dishonor. 

Honorable artisans insisted on the permanent expulsion of torture victims from their guild. Governments viewed this development with alarm, for it posed a threat to the criminal justice system itself. Authorities could hardly conduct a criminal investigation with a free hand if torture, one of their principal means of investigation, had the unintended consequence of destroying the victim’s social identity,

regardless of the outcome of the case. By the late seventeenth century artisans’

attempts to expel torture victims had become so widespread that the practice was listed in the catalogue of artisanal abuses compiled in the ‘‘Proposal’’ produced by the imperial diet in .

A particularly tragic case of this kind involved a young journeyman embroiderer, Augustin Gerstecker, who was arrested under suspicion of witchcraft in . The twenty-one-year-old journeyman was imprisoned and tortured for seven weeks. 

However, steadfast denial and a physical peculiarity saved him from conviction. 

While shaving Augustin’s body to search for the devil’s mark, the executioner Marx Philipp Hartmann discovered a physical feature which proved the young man’s innocence: ‘‘his virile member is in such a condition that he must still be a virgin, because the foreskin cannot be pulled backwards.’’ In other words, the young man could not have engaged in sexual intercourse with Satan, the necessary consumma-tion of the devil’s pact. The authorities pronounced him innocent, but seven weeks of torture had left Augustin a cripple. The records do not show what permanent injuries he sustained; among other things his hands were damaged. He could no longer keep up with his fellow journeymen, so that no master would have employed him. But this never became an issue. Though innocent of witchcraft in the eyes of the magistrates, he was infamous in the eyes of his fellow guildsmen and they expelled him from their guild. Pressed to explain his expulsion, the embroiderers simply stated that Augustin had been under the hands of the executioner and therefore the matter was beyond their control: ‘‘If this happened to another person, he would have the same fate.’’ Dishonor conflicts resulting from the executioner’s touch during torture continued through the eighteenth century. 

Jurists made futile proclamations that torture did not leave a mark of infamy on the suspect, while artisans continued to expel the victims of torture.

THE IMPACT OF NON-CAPITAL PUNISHMENTS

Even in cases involving petty crime, when torture was not applied, the authorities often found that the impact of their punishments was more severe than intended.

*The infamous fur coat*

The punishment of ‘‘strong beggars,’’ the undeserving poor, was a primary arena of the state’s social disciplining project. In the eyes of the authorities, the beggary of the able-bodied poor was the result of a dissolute lifestyle, of willful and sinful idleness. Governments resorted to forced labor, imprisonment, and corporal punishments to instill moral habits and to impose labor discipline on the undeserving poor. But dishonor pollution hampered governments’ disciplining agenda. In Augsburg, the government tried to instill a new work ethic by putting beggars to work in chain gangs cleaning out latrines and doing construction work on city fortifications. When the welfare administrators suggested subjecting them to disciplinary whippings, the city council inquired with the free imperial city of Nuremberg about how they handled such vagrants. Nuremberg advised against the whippings: ‘‘if these fellows were whipped, they would be even more likely to turn into thieves and highway robbers, since their honor would be impugned and they would no longer be tolerated among artisans.’’

Authorities attempted to punish petty offenders with discretion, so as not to defame them permanently. This is illustrated in their punishment of sexual offenses. In  the Augsburg council issued a secret decree ordering that adulterers be prosecuted and punished with ‘‘due caution’’ \( *mit beho¨riger Behutsam-keit*\). This internal directive contrasted with the draconian public language of police ordinances that threatened corporal punishment or even death for fornicators and adulterers so ‘‘divine wrath . . . does not engulf the entire city.’’ In 

the Bavarian government grappled with dishonor pollution, when they found that punishing fornicators or adulterers ‘‘publicly or in other ways according to our edicts,’’ resulted in offenders’ expulsion from their guild. Guildsmen had internalized strict sexual mores too well. Their unwillingness to forgive such transgressions hindered the authorities’ attempts to impose a stricter sexual morality on the public at large. 

The prison workhouse or house of correction, the paradigmatic penal institution of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, was also bedeviled by the problem of dishonor pollution. Within the walls of the *Zuchthaus*, literally the ‘‘discipline house,’’ the authorities exercised almost total control over the inmates, imposing

detailed regimens upon the prisoners to inculcate moral habits and labor discipline. 

Prison workhouses exemplify the pedagogical impulse of social disciplining. They provided an alternative to bloody punishments to the body; the stated goal of punishment was resocialization rather than retribution. But dishonor pollution threatened to derail efforts to rehabilitate the offenders. 

In  Augsburg established two prison workhouses – one for Catholics and another for Protestants, according to the principle of confessional parity. These institutions were supposed to discipline a motley assortment of miscreants: ‘‘sassy and incorrigible local or foreign beggars . . . insolent and disorderly journeymen, lazy apprentices and misbehaving schoolboys . . . disobedient children, impudent and flighty girls who hanker after the luxurious life . . . in sum everyone who misbehaves and leads a sinful and idle life . . .’’ These workhouses were obviously not intended to punish serious criminals. Only minor offenders in need of a ‘‘civil correction’’ would be admitted. Criminals who had been ‘‘under the executioner’s or blood-sergeants’ hands’’ were excluded. They were sent to the prison workhouse of the Swabian circle in Buchloe, which had a separate wing for infamous inmates. But despite such efforts to separate and exclude infamous offenders, the authorities’ policy of containment failed once again. 

Soon the city government was confronted with the problem of what to do with inmates who had served their time. In  a number of boys who had been imprisoned in the workhouses for minor thefts were due to be released. The boys had been sent to the workhouse in the first place because the authorities judged them to be ‘‘correctable.’’ Timely discipline would lead to their ‘‘improvement,’’

saving them from a life of crime. But when the boys had completed their term, the authorities did not know where to place them. The boys were clearly not dishonorable, the magistrates affirmed, since they had not been subjected to dishonoring punishments. But they could not be foisted on the guildsmen, for the councilors feared this would foment conflict and unrest. The patrician administrators finally recommended that the boys be handed over to military recruiters or employed in the construction of city walls. The prison workhouse, an institution specifically intended to rehabilitate offenders, failed at this task, because dishonor pollution made it impossible for inmates to be reintegrated into honorable society. 

Dishonor affected not only the offender who was being punished, but his or her family members as well. A case from  offers a stark illustration of this effect. 

Four artisans from Neuß in Silesia petitioned the emperor for legitimation and restitution of honor. The wives of these artisans had been arrested during a

witch-hunt in the previous year. ‘‘They were tortured and examined, but after enduring multiple torments, they were found innocent.’’ Their innocence notwithstanding, the stigma conferred by torture caused ‘‘ *both the men and their aforemen-tioned wives * to suffer contempt of their fellow citizens, in particular their fellow guildsmen. They were regarded as dishonorable.’’ Dishonor spread from the women to their spouses. Their guilds shut down their shops. The tragic story of these women and their husbands, as well as that of the Augsburg journeyman Augustin Gerstecker, draw attention to an aspect of the European witch-hunt which has received scant attention in the burgeoning literature on the subject. If witchcraft suspects survived the judicial process, their troubles were not over upon their release from prison. Petitions by family members of offenders give an idea of the impact of honor punishments on the delinquent’s kin. In  the relatives of a woman who was condemned to a public whipping at the pillory for committing fornication with a Jew, begged the authorities to take into account the fate of ‘‘her poor fatherless orphans’’ and to ‘‘spare us, the honorable kin, this public whipping.’’ In  the relatives of a deserter begged the authorities not to attach his name to the gallows, because ‘‘the shame and disgrace will mostly fall on us innocent siblings, and we will hear about it on every occasion . . .’’

An objection might be made that in these cases infamy resulted less from the executioner’s polluting touch than from the nature of the crimes. This is especially plausible in cases of witchcraft, where lingering suspicion and fear might contribute to the dishonor of the accused even after her or his release. The family members of the purported witch might be vulnerable to dishonor, because witchcraft was believed to run in families. Historians have suggested that the efficacy of honor punishments at defaming a delinquent was dependent upon a consensus between the authorities and the common people who made up the audience at such shaming rituals. If the plebeian public did not agree that an offender’s conduct was worthy of condemnation, the honor punishment would remain ineffective.

However, these arguments are usually based on studies of rural society. The analysis of honor conflicts in Augsburg and other urban societies leads to a different conclusion. In towns the impact of dishonor pollution was devastating and permanent for offenders and their families, even in cases where no stigma attached to a particular offense in popular culture. In , when some journeymen escorted to the Munich city limits by the executioner for engaging in a drunken melee with the city guards, it is hardly likely that their fellow journeymen found their crime particularly objectionable. Drinking and brawling went hand in hand with male sociability. Ritualized drinking bouts and the violence that followed were, as

Lyndal Roper has argued, ‘‘a means of advancing the honor of guild or journeyman band.’’ These unruly young men were conforming to the demands of the male honor code and the group norms of their journeymen’s association, but they became dishonorable nonetheless. Such cases demonstrate that it was the punishment that conferred infamy, not the nature of the offense. The defaming effect of punishment took place *ex opere operato*, regardless of moral condition or intentions. 

CONCLUSION

Dishonor cannot simply be understood as a form of death pollution, since it was produced not only in the context of capital punishment, but resulted from almost any imaginable punitive procedure. Dishonor did not originate only with the executioner, though it was most strongly concentrated in him. By the eighteenth century the most mundane application of criminal justice dishonored the officer who carried it out. Dishonor did not flow in any particular direction, but instead seemed to expand in all directions simultaneously. The touch of the executioner or a particular punishment dishonored the criminal, and conversely, contact with the criminal dishonored the bailiff who laid hands on him or her. Particular actions, such as laying on iron chains, dishonored the bailiff and prisoner simultaneously. 

The chain itself or other tools of punishment also became infused with dishonor, so that physical contact with such an object could dishonor a third party who was not implicated in the punitive process at all. 

In spite of its potential as an instrument of social control, dishonor caused as many problems for the authorities as it solved. The ideology of dishonor did serve to support government on a symbolic level – we saw this very clearly in the gallows-building ceremonies where the logic of the ritual expressed the high honor of the authorities. But on a practical level, dishonor pollution severely hampered the day-to-day administration of criminal justice and actually tended to undermine governmental authority. 

Sovereignty and lordship seems to have been a key factor in the production of dishonor. In , the leaders of the association of journeymen shoemakers were arrested for disciplining some of their members by whipping them with a strap. 

The authorities objected to such intra-guild discipline because administering such a whipping fell within the prerogatives of government. By meting out such a punishment, the journeymen’s association was infringing upon the sovereignty of the magistrates. What is intriguing about this case for our purposes, is that this whipping did not produce dishonor. Neither the journeymen who administered the

whipping, nor the journeymen who were disciplined were tainted by this punishment. Punishment or violence *per se * did not dishonor, only punishment meted out in the name of sovereign authorities. 

What does the exponential expansion of dishonor reveal about popular attitudes towards governmental authority and criminal justice? It does *not * mean that artisans rejected the social disciplining agenda of the authorities. Much to the contrary, artisans were among the early champions of social discipline. Augsburg was governed by a guild regime when it published a comprehensive new ‘‘discipline ordinance’’ in , the first major act of civic legislation after the introduction of the Protestant reformation. Lyndal Roper describes this ordinance as ‘‘the corner-stone of Reformation guild-influenced moralism.’’ In its effort to impose moral reform and create a godly city, the ordinance was all-encompassing in scope. It sought to enforce church attendance; it prohibited blasphemy, perjury, libel and insult, drunkenness, and gambling, along with adultery, rape and seduction, concubinage and fornication, ‘‘damned and forbidden mixing’’ \(e.g. sodomy and bestiality\), procuring, and violence and fighting. It shored up the authority of husband over wife, parents over children, masters over servants – and of the city council over the city’s inhabitants, who were now addressed as subjects rather than citizens. The ordinance is typical of what R. Po-chia Hsia has called the

‘‘intersection between the history of sin and the history of criminalization’’ in the public policy of social disciplining governments. Augsburg’s evangelical regime enhanced the power of the city council at the expense of the guilds, a process in which the artisans were complicit because they were heavily involved in the institutionalization of discipline. The new disciplinary agencies set up to implement the morals campaign, such as the ‘‘Discipline Lords,’’ were mostly staffed by guildsmen. The guildsmen’s wholehearted endorsement of discipline casts doubt on a social disciplining paradigm that typically sees discipline as a top-down process.

Of course guildsmen’s enthusiasm for discipline might have waned after the abolition of the guild regime and the imposition of an authoritarian patrician government by emperor Charles V in . Seeing themselves as patriarchs rather than brothers, the new patrician rulers abandoned communitarian government, and imitated the governing style of the dynastic rulers of neighboring absolutist states. New government agencies such as the ‘‘Discipline Lords’’

survived this change of regime and continued to mete out punishment even after the evangelical fervor of the Reformation had died down. Perhaps dishonor

*Punishment and healing*

pollution spread because artisans came to reject discipline once they were no longer in control of its administration? 

It would be a misreading of artisans’ pollution anxieties, however, to interpret them as a clear-cut rejection of criminal justice. Recent research on the history of crime suggests that criminal justice cannot be understood as a unilateral imposition of social discipline from above. Authoritarian rhetoric notwithstanding, the actual practice of criminal justice was characterized by a high level of consensus between the city government and their subjects. Judges gave much weight to intercessions by their subjects on behalf of the accused, so that the sentences they ultimately handed down were essentially negotiated settlements between rulers and subjects. 

Authorities punished with moderation, according to the principle of ‘‘mercy before justice’’ \( *Gnade vor Recht*\). The common people who witnessed scaffold justice typically did not perceive criminal punishments to be tyrannical or unjust. This consensus between rulers and subjects is also reflected in the fact that there were few rescue attempts at the scaffold. When execution riots did occur, this happened after the condemned criminal was already dead. When an executioner botched a beheading, the crowd waited until his unfortunate victim had finally expired, and then stoned the executioner. The rioters were not protesting the death penalty, but rather the improper performance of the execution ritual. The dishonorable status of the executioner and other police officers should not be read as popular hostility towards capital punishment. 

Artisans’ pollution anxieties reveal a profoundly ambivalent attitude towards criminal justice. Early modern Germans seemed to attribute a kind of personal guilt to officers involved in law enforcement, as if the blame for the sufferings of the punished criminal lay with them. In  an innkeeper’s wife insulted a bailiff, saying that if the delinquent he had just arrested ended up on the gallows, the bailiff would bear the guilt of his death. In  two offenders who had been exposed to the pillory went about town blaming the bailiff who escorted them there for their dishonor. Such sentiments notwithstanding, the common people supported criminal justice as it was meted out by the authorities. But they were unwilling to associate with people who were personally involved in the performance of criminal punishments, no matter how tangential their connection might be.
