title = "08 Honor and dishonor in the eighteenth century"

+++

In  the enlightened Prussian physician and journalist Christian Gottfried Gru¨ner published a pamphlet in which he lauded the humanitarian advances of his century, while lamenting the fact that executioners and skinners had not benefited from such social reforms:

The history of modern times provides inspiring examples of humanitarianism towards the oppressed . . . Here in Germany, Jews have been given greater freedoms . . . In England . . . 

criminals are being transported to Botany Bay as useful colonists, instead of being hanged. In Hungary, attempts are being made to accustom vagrant, thieving, and lazy gypsies to a settled life and to turn them into useful citizens. Do not skinners have a claim to more humane treatment by their fellow citizens as well?

Social commentators in eighteenth-century Germany lamented that the ‘‘prejudice’’ of the dishonor of executioner and other defiled trades persisted ‘‘in our enlightened century.’’ But appeals to reason and humanity notwithstanding, the position of dishonorable people deteriorated in the course of the century. The development is paradoxical. The legal status of executioners and skinners gradually improved. The imperial police ordinance of  legitimated all defiled trades

‘‘except the skinner alone.’’ The imperial decree of  rehabilitated the children of skinners, and reaffirmed that executioners were already honorable. A number of territorial states also issued general mandates rehabilitating dishonorable trades. 

Austria and Prussia were the most forceful in this regard. But dishonor sparked more social conflict in the eighteenth century than ever before. Executioners and skinners lost many of the perquisites that had made their dishonorable status tolerable in the late sixteenth and seventeenth centuries and increasingly challenged the social boundary that excluded them from honorable society. Guildsmen raised their honor requirements to new heights and applied the stigma of dishonor

*Honor and dishonor in the eighteenth century* more widely. Stubbornly resisting all attempts to ‘‘enlighten’’ them, artisans had, in the words of one exasperated bureaucrat, ‘‘nothing else in mind but their imaginary *point d’honneur*.’’ While enlightened public opinion was hostile towards artisanal exclusiveness and absolutist territorial states adopted a hard line towards guild ‘‘abuses,’’ in Augsburg and other free imperial cities, magistrates became more sympathetic to the social concerns of the artisans. The Augburg city government adopted a policy of appeasement towards the artisans and tended to give the guildsmen greater leeway in dishonor conflicts. Indeed, for the first time the magistrates themselves actively enforced the social discrimination of dishonorable people. 

EXECUTIONER MEDICINE AND THE LIMITS OF SOCIAL MOBILITY

We turn first to the changing status of executioners and skinners. What opportunities existed for them to move out of the dishonorable milieu? Medicine provided the most promising avenue of upward social mobility, as is exemplified by the remarkable career of Marx Philipp Hartmann. A chronicle recorded the execution of a thief on June ,  with the comment, ‘‘This was the last whom Master Marx Philipp Hartmann beheaded. He then received an imperial privilege allowing him to practice as other doctors, without objection.’’ That summer, after serving as executioner for twenty-eight years, Master Marx managed to obtain an imperial legitimation that placed him and his daughter ‘‘in the estate of honor.’’ Marx had also received an imperial privilege to practice medicine. He now planned to settle in Augsburg and continue his practice. He applied for citizenship for himself and his daughter, since he was confident that he could ‘‘make his living with honor.’’ In official documents Hartmann was now described as *medicinae practicus *\(imperially privileged medical practitioner\). The label of executioner disappeared, and no mention was made in official records of Marx’s past profession. Marx now moved in different circles. Abandoning the traditional endogamy among executioner clans, Marx managed to marry his daughter Maria to a medical doctor in . Marx himself made a less prestigious but still honorable match, marrying a stonemason’s widow in . When Marx died in , his name was recorded in the parish records preceded by the honorific *Herr*.

Marx Philipp Hartmann’s spectacular social ascent was not unprecedented. 

 This was a bureaucrat from the Prussian province of Neumark. Quoted in Hans-Ulrich Thamer, ‘‘On the use and abuse of handicraft: journeyman culture and enlightened public opinion in th and th century Germany,’’ in Steven L. Kaplan, ed., *Understanding Popular Culture: Europe from the Middle* *Ages to the Nineteenth Century *\(Berlin, \), pp. –, p. .

*Artisanal honor and urban politics* There are a number of examples of executioners who were legitimated by the emperor, their territorial lord, or a palatine count \( *comes palatinus*\), an imperial officer who was empowered by the emperor to grant such legitimations. These legitimations declared the executioners to be honorable and often granted them the privilege of practicing medicine in spite of the barber-surgeons’ and medical doctors’ monopoly. One such case occurred in the Swabian town of Donauwo¨rth in

. Master Marx Daübler, who had served as executioner in Donauwo¨rth for eighteen years, successfully passed an examination at the medical faculty of the university of Ingolstadt, whereupon he was legitimated by the Bavarian elector and granted permission to practice as a doctor and surgeon. This case is exceptional, not only because of the erudition that was required to pass such an examination, but also because the right of a person of dishonorable background to study at a university was contested. Most executioners who received medical privileges did so without professional accreditation.

In , after twenty years of service as executioner, Marx Philipp Hartmann’s nephew, Johann Adam Hartmann, received an imperial legitimation that declared him honorable and allowed him to set up a medical practice. Like his uncle he was granted citizenship and now appeared in official documents as ‘‘citizen and imperially privileged medical practitioner and surgeon.’’ In  the tax records even entered him as ‘‘Doctor.’’ He was addressed with such honorific titles as *Herr* *Doktor, Ihro Excellenz*, and *Ihro Gestreng*. These were titles to which normally only university graduates were entitled. Johann Adam remarried in . Though the background of his new wife Anna Maria Straub is unclear, neither she nor the two witnesses were members of any known executioner clan.

However, Johann Adam was not able to shake off his dishonorable past as easily as his uncle Marx Philipp apparently had. In spite of the honors he was accorded \( *Herr Doktor*, *Ihro Gestreng*\), his imperial legitimation was repeatedly challenged. 

In  the lackey of a local count accosted Hartmann in an apothecary shop, deriding him as ‘‘an unemployed executioner.’’ Hartmann sued for insult, and the lackey was ordered to recant in a ‘‘public act’’ in the shop where the insult had taken place. In , Hartmann faced a more serious challenge. Hartmann complained

*Honor and dishonor in the eighteenth century* to the council that Dr. Schißler, a medical doctor and member of the *Collegium* *Medicum*, had ‘‘touched my honor insultingly in order to damage my honorable name and good reputation.’’ Dr. Schißler had publicly announced that he would no longer treat patients who consulted the hangman. When a patient died, Schißler claimed that he would still be alive, had he not consulted the hangman. Hartmann sued Schißler for such ‘‘atrocious insults’’, but the outcome of the conflict has not been preserved.

Johann Adam Hartmann was the last Augsburg executioner to receive an imperial legitimation or official license for his medical practice. This might have been due to a variety of factors. The stigma of dishonor gained greater force in the eighteenth century. At the same time, university-trained physicians began to encroach on the executioner’s traditional practice. By the eighteenth century, Augsburg’s medical doctors were performing autopsies, a task they had scorned in the seventeenth century. The authorities had halfheartedly sought to suppress or at least limit executioners’ medical practice from the sixteenth century on; in the eighteenth century they implemented their decrees with new determination.

Their efforts seemed to show at least some effect. Executioners and skinners were increasingly marginalized in the medical market. In  the city government decided to increase executioner Johann Scheller’s allotment of firewood, since unlike his predecessor he did not have an income from medical practice.

The authorities were never able to suppress the executioner’s and skinner’s medical practice entirely, however. As late as  executioner Johann Georg Trenkler was able to write in a petition in  that weakness and old age no longer allowed him to practice the ‘‘various cures on human and \( *salvo honore*\) animals’’

that he had performed for decades. And executioners and skinners continued to use medicine as an avenue of upward social mobility. A small number of legitimated executioners’ sons managed to enter universities and become doctors of medicine themselves. At the Bavarian university of Ingolstadt at least nine sons of executioners were immatriculated in the medical faculty between  and . In

 the granddaughter of Augsburg’s skinner Johann Georg Widemann, who had served from –, chose to emphasize her grandfather’s medical practice in her attempt to rise above her dishonorable status. Widemann’s descendants occu-

 In  the decree of  forbidding the practice of ‘‘executioners, skinners, grave-diggers and other such unqualified people’’ was reconfirmed. In  the council issued a decree at the request of the *Collegium Medicum * that forbade the distribution of medicine by unqualified people, particularly by the skinner. The council, this latest decree declares, would now set out to enforce earlier decrees to this effect from ,  and . StadtAA, Ratserla¨sse –, March , . StadtAA, CM, Fremde A

*Artisanal honor and urban politics* pied the skinner’s post in the small Swabian town of Reutlingen, and his granddaughter wanted to marry a master tanner. When the tanners’ guild objected, the Augsburg city government wrote a report on the young couple’s behalf. Augsburg attested that Widemann had ‘‘occupied himself mostly with cures, in which he was very skilled. He had his servants do the skinner’s work.’’ By proving that the woman’s ancestors had been mostly concerned with medical practice rather than with dishonoring skinner’s work, the young couple hoped to overcome the resistance of the tanners’ guild.

Such attempts were less likely to succeed as the century progressed. Even though executioners and skinners continued to practice, executioner’s medicine was criminalized in the course of the century. In the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries the authorities had recognized executioners’ medical competence in some areas at least, but in the eighteenth century criminologists and enlightened critics condemned medical treatments by executioners and skinners as pure fraud. In Bavaria executioners and skinners convicted of quackery were imprisoned in workhouses.

Eighteenth-century lists of wanted criminals frequently named vagrant executioners and skinners who were hawking their medicines in the countryside. One such list named ‘‘Schinder-Hannes’’ \(Skinner-John\), a ‘‘medicine carrier,’’ and

‘‘Fuchs, a doctor, who claims that he is a skinner’s servant.’’ Criminologists warned the public of the deceptions executioners and skinners used to trick gullible peasants out of their money. In spite of such warnings, executioners’ and skinners’

medical services were still in great demand through the first half of the nineteenth century – in  a criminologist bemoaned the fact that the ‘‘reputation and practice of such executioners is very great, not only for their medicine, but also for their knowledge of secret sympathetic magic. Not only the raw uneducated mob, but also a great number of the so-called educated estates still turn to them for help.’’ Executioner’s medicine most likely was still quite profitable through the eighteenth century. But since the authorities no longer regarded executioner medicine as legitimate, their medical practice was less likely to provide executioners

*Honor and dishonor in the eighteenth century* with a route of upward social mobility. Indeed, by the late eighteenth century, executioner medicine was often a symptom of an executioner’s or skinner’s social descent into the criminal vagrant underworld. 

UNEMPLOYED EXECUTIONERS

Augsburg’s executioners and skinners continued to intermarry in the eighteenth century as they had in the seventeenth. They formed extensive marriage networks throughout south Germany and continued to transfer positions and property by marriage. Executioners’ and skinners’ clans in Augsburg were perhaps even more intertwined than they had been in the previous century. When the Hartmann clan finally vacated the executioner’s post in , after they had filled it for three generations, Johann Scheller, the son of the local skinner, was hired as executioner. 

For the first time the executioner’s and skinner’s post were filled by the same family. A few months later, Scheller married Maria Elisabeth Deibler from Straubing in Bavaria, an executioner’s daughter from the Deibler clan that had filled the executioner’s position in Augsburg from  to . Like their seventeenth-century predecessors, executioners and skinners in the eighteenth century served the city for many years, sometimes decades. The average tenure of executioners was just over twenty-four years; skinners served an average of twenty-eight years. But in spite of such continuity and job security, executioners and skinners experienced a steady decline in status in the eighteenth century. Executioners in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries were often quite rich. Skinners, while less wealthy, were certainly not poor. Their low legal and social status was offset by their high economic status. In the eighteenth century a number of factors made these positions less profitable. There was a slight decline in the number of executions. 

Between  and , the executioner and his assistant, the skinner, performed an average of . executions per year. Between  and  the average number of executions dropped to . per year. This decrease corresponds to a European-

v, August , . Augsburg’s executioners and their years of employment in the eighteenth century were Johann Scheller, –; Johann Georg Trenkler, –; Johann Adam Pfliegler, 

–; Anton Ho¨rmann,  until at least . The skinners were Johann Jacob Scheller,

 A total of  executions took place in the  years between  and . See Helmut Schuhmann, *Der Scharfrichter. Seine Gestalt – seine Funktion *\(Kempten, \), p. . Schuhmann compiled these figures on the basis of twelve volumes of punishment books covering the period

–, with one interuption of three years from  to . These books were kept with varying thoroughness in different periods: in – six years are covered in one volume, from 

to  forty-five years are covered in one volume. These lists are clearly incomplete. Nonetheless, the punishment books are the most accurate source available for the period before . The eighteenth-century numbers are drawn from Samuel Valentin, *End-Urtheil und Verruf . . . derjenigen*

*Artisanal honor and urban politics* wide trend. Execution rates went down as imprisonment became established as an alternative form of punishment. There are few sources available on the use of torture in Augsburg in the eighteenth century. However, Enlightenment ideology and legal reforms resulted in a reduction in the use of judicial torture in Europe generally, so it is probable that the use of torture in Augsburg declined as well. 

Criminal justice reforms clearly cut into executioners’ earnings, as we can see from executioner Johann Georg Trenkler’s efforts to offset this loss. In  he petitioned for the exclusive right to perform executions of those inmates in the prison of the Swabian circle located in Buchloe who were native Augsburgers. Criminal justice reforms most likely did not seriously threaten the economic status of master executioners who had secure employment, however. Even in the period preceding

 executioners did not derive a large proportion of their income from criminal punishments, since on average fewer than two executions took place per year. 

Executioners obtained much of their earnings from ‘‘night-work’’ \(emptying latrines\) and medical practice. 

In the course of the century, executioners and skinners also lost their traditional exemption from the excise tax on meat and alcohol. In an effort to rationalize the tax system, administrators defined this custom as an ‘‘abuse,’’ and argued that ‘‘no one, no matter who he is, should be exempt . . .’’ The traditional exemption apparently was of considerable economic significance. In  the executioner Johann Scheller expressed his outrage at the tax reform: ‘‘Executioners and their families are excluded from artisanal guilds and the company of honorable people through no fault of their own, by fateful observance and custom \( *ex fatali observantia et* *consuetudine*\). To compensate us for this, we have been given special freedoms,’’ in particular the tax exemption. The executioner Johann Georg Trenkler protested that if such an innovation was introduced during his tenure his fellow executioners in the region would kill him; indeed, he had already received murder threats.

Executioners also lost customary fees for the disposal of suicides, as authorities

*. . . Persohnen so von einem . . . Rath . . . vom Leben zum Tod condemnieret *\(Augsburg, n.d.\), StadtAA, Strafamt. Valentin records eighty-one executions between  and , or . executions per year. 

We are forced to rely on such unofficial compilations for the eighteenth century, because the series of punishment books ends in . For the eighteenth century there is only one official source on capital punishments, the ‘‘Book of Criminals’’ \( *Verbrecherbuch*\) covering the period –, but it is very fragmentary. For that entire period it lists only fifty-two executions.

*Honor and dishonor in the eighteenth century* implemented their new liberal policy of granting an honorable burial to almost all suicides. This policy change along with the declining number of executions, new restrictions on medical practice, and the loss of traditional privileges undoubtedly resulted in a painful cut in executioners’ and skinners’ earnings in the course of the eighteenth century. In contrast to the earlier period, executioners do not appear wealthy in eighteenth-century sources. Much to the contrary, petitions by executioners and skinners indicate that they were in serious financial straits.  Nonetheless, Augsburg’s executioners and skinners could consider themselves fortunate compared with their younger brothers and sons who were unable to find employment. In the course of the century, Augsburg’s executioners and skinners found it harder to place their sons in suitable positions. Executioners’ sons reacted to the tightening job market by demonstrating greater technical skill and professional qualifications. In  executioner Johann Georg Trenkler petitioned the council to allow his younger brother, whom he had trained for the past three years, to perform his master piece with the sword ‘‘since it is difficult to find a position in this occupation . . .’’ A year later Trenkler petitioned to let his brother, still unemployed, do a second master piece, ‘‘for nowadays at least two such master pieces are required from someone who aspires to the executioner’s post.’’ In 

the skinner Johann Georg Widemann’s son Johann Michael had not found a position, even though he had already performed four masterpieces. With the

‘‘present supply’’ of young executioners, executioner Trenkler petitioned the council, young Widemann, ‘‘a local son,’’ should be allowed to do a fifth masterpiece, so that he might have an edge over other applicants. In  Johann Georg Leimer, an Augburg beadle and executioner’s son, who had already done three master pieces petitioned to do a fourth: the upcoming execution would present a special demonstration of his skill, since the delinquent had an unusually thick neck\!

Unemployed executioners and skinners turned to crime. Executioners and skinners had been a remarkably law-abiding group since the mid-sixteenth century, as we saw in chapter . This changed in the eighteenth century. Demographic pressures and economic dislocation increased the problems of poverty and vagrancy in society at large, and many younger executioners’ or skinners’ sons plummeted socially into the growing ranks of the vagrant poor. Transient executioners and skinners were stock figures in the profusion of published lists of wanted

*Artisanal honor and urban politics* criminals and execution chronicles that appeared in the eighteenth century. Many of these unemployed skinners, both men and women, were known in the vagrant underworld by nicknames such as ‘‘Schinder-Lisl’’ \(skinner-Lizzy\), ‘‘Schinder-Anderl,’’ or ‘‘Schinder-Michel.’’ Police and begging ordinances warned of gangs of skinners terrorizing the countryside with large wild dogs. One list from 

described an extended family of vagrant skinners who were making the roads around Augsburg unsafe. A highwayman had denounced them on the scaffold as his accomplices. This vagrant skinners’ clan consisted of eight individuals. Their leader was ‘‘skinner Hans Go¨rgl,’’ who tramped through the Swabian countryside under the pretext of selling cloth at local markets. His defining physical feature was that he was missing several fingers that he had accidentally hacked off while he was still working as a skinner. He was accompanied by his wife, Anna Maria, and their two children, a nine-year-old boy and a two-year-old girl. Also part of the group were Anna Maria’s older sister Appollonia and her husband, ‘‘skinner Michael,’’

and Anna Maria’s younger sister and her lover ‘‘skinner Mathias’’ who was Hans Go¨rgl’s younger brother. The entire group, with the exception of the children, was wanted for capital crimes. The topos of the ‘‘hanged hangman’’ does reflect the experience of vagrant executioners and skinners in the eighteenth century. Sometimes entire skinner families were wiped out in criminal executions. Schinder-Lisl, her twenty-four-year-old daughter, and seventeen-year-old son were beheaded in

 in Buchloe in the workhouse of the Swabian circle. Her seventeen-year-old daughter was whipped and banished from the territory, while her eleven-year-old daughter remained in the workhouse.

Other executioners’ and skinners’ sons who could not find employment in their fathers’ profession tried to enter artisanal guilds. Of the eighty dishonor conflicts documented in Augsburg sources in the eighteenth century, twenty were set off by executioners’ and skinners’ sons or grandsons trying to join honorable guilds, or by their daughters or granddaughters marrying honorable artisans.

*Honor and dishonor in the eighteenth century* periphery of dishonor, most notably bailiffs’ sons and daughters. All other dishonor conflicts involving executioners or skinners before  were ritual pollution conflicts resulting from sociability or some other form of contact between executioners or skinners and honorable artisans. The boundary of honor that segregated dishonorable people from guildsmen was established in the course of the sixteenth century. By the late sixteenth century honorable guildsmen and the dishonorable core groups had developed certain conventions that minimized conflicts. The children of executioners and skinners did not *try * to enter the artisanate between  and . They occupied a privileged niche in the urban social structure that compensated them for their low legal and social status. This tacit acceptance of the boundary of honor by the dishonorable core groups as well as by artisans allowed this social system to operate smoothly from the late sixteenth through the seventeenth century. It was only in the eighteenth century when executioners and skinners lost many of the advantages of their position, that they challenged the social boundary separating them from honorable society. Dishonor conflicts involving the dishonorable core group multiplied, when executioners and skinners were no longer willing to abide by the artisanal honor code. 

THE LIMITED EFFECTIVENESS OF LEGITIMATIONS

When executioners’ and skinners’ children and grandchildren attempted to join honorable guilds, they tried to neutralize artisanal opposition by obtaining a legitimation. The executioners Marx Philipp and Johann Adam Hartmann received legitimations declaring them honorable. 

Johann Adam Hartmann resigned his post in the summer of . A year later he petitioned the magistrate for a letter of recommendation from the city government attesting to his good conduct during his twenty-year tenure as executioner. He was applying for a *legitimatio ad honores * from his imperial majesty. His petition for imperial legitimation was granted, as Hartmann described years later: ‘‘it is well known to the entire citizenry . . . that by means of a gracious imperial privilege I have been placed in the estate of honors . . ., and because of my good experience in medicine and surgery, and my upright and decent lifestyle, I have been granted the free practice of medicine.’’ In the legitimation, the emperor decreed that the

‘‘infamy’’ that had previously attached to Hartmann and his wife should no longer

‘‘bring them any shame.’’ They should be eligible for ‘‘all privileges and freedoms and admission in honorable arts, crafts, guilds, and collectivities and whatever

 Before , only two cases involved members of the dishonorable core trying to gain admission to a guild. In  the skinner’s son, most likely Hans Gaisser the Younger, tried to begin an apprenticeship in the weavers’ guild. See above, chapter , p. . The second case involved the tragic love affair between the skinner’s daughter Barbara Leichnam and the fisherboy Andreas Anhauser. See above, introduction, pp. –.

*Artisanal honor and urban politics* other associations of this kind may exist . . .’’ The imperial privilege threatened anyone who dared to insult Hartmann because of his previous function or to hinder his medical practice with a fine of  marks in gold. Upon receiving this legitimation, Hartmann and his wife were granted Augsburg citizenship.

The legitimations of Marx Philipp and Johann Adam Hartmann were successful, but most others were not. Marx Philipp and Johann Adam needed the legitimations to receive citizenship and the right to practice medicine. They did not try the strength of their legitimations any further by trying to gain admission to any guild or corporate group within the city. They did not test that part of the legitimations that declared their eligibility for ‘‘admission in honorable arts, crafts, guilds, and collectivities . . .’’ The fisherman Andreas Anhauser, however, hoped that such an imperial legitimation would help him be readmitted to his guild and allow him to fish again. In  Andreas went to Regensburg and successfully appealed to the emperor for a legitimation. It is not clear through what bureaucratic channels such a petition was processed. After paying a certain fee – we do not know how much, but he borrowed money for this purpose – Andreas was issued an imperial decree that placed him and his relatives in a ‘‘pristine estate of honor.’’ Andreas’s petition had not been altogether accurate, however. He had claimed that his fellow guildsmen attended his wedding and objected to the marriage only after the fact, which was manifestly untrue. When the fishermen challenged the validity of his legitimation on these grounds, Andreas explained it as an error of the Regensburg scribe whom he had hired to write the petition. This error did not affect the validity of the legitimation, because ‘‘his imperial majesty has the power in and of himself, to restore me and my relatives to integrity, even if no reason were given at all.’’

Andreas argued that just as the emperor had legitimated executioners on numerous occasions \(‘‘examples from the neighborhood might be produced’’\), so the emperor had the power to legitimate someone who married a skinner’s daughter. ‘‘To dispute his power is sacrilege.’’ In Andreas’s interpretation the imperial legitimation had a quasi-magical efficacy which derived from the sovereignty of the emperor, regardless of the circumstances under which the legitimation had been obtained. The fishermen’s guild and the city government did not see it that way. 

The city council informed the emperor that Andreas had received the ‘‘diploma of restitution of reputation and honor’’ under false pretenses, and thus the legitimation should be rescinded. The legitimation was not honored in Augsburg, and Andreas ended his days as a day-laborer.

*Honor and dishonor in the eighteenth century* legitimations proceeded from the sovereignty of the emperor or territorial lord. 

Once again, we encounter the notion that persons of high honor had the power to counteract, to cleanse dishonor, an idea that illustrates the ideological foundation of the society of orders. This same conception of the high honor of persons of high estate and their resulting immunity to dishonor underlay the gallows-building ritual in which representatives of government neutralized the infamy of the gallows by their purifying touch. Legitimation was a legal procedure that came into use in German territories with the reception of Roman law. Originally the procedure applied to children of illegitimate birth, as the name would indicate. Various types of legitimation existed. We are not concerned here with the *legitimatio per subsequens* *matrimonium*, which stipulated that if the parents of a bastard married at a later date the force of the sacrament was so great that it produced the legitimacy of the child retroactively. Instead, we are concerned with the secular procedure of *legitimatio per rescriptum principis*, in which legitimation was granted by the state at the order of the prince. To issue such a legitimation was one of the sovereign rights of the prince. It fell within the rights of the emperor to raise the status of an individual by grants of nobility, academic degrees or titles, rights and privileges, or by legitimation. Territorial lords might pronounce legitimations as an exercise of their sovereign rights within their territories. Legitimations could be pronounced by certain officials appointed by the emperor, the palatine counts, or according to their German title, the *Hofpfalzgrafen*. Palatine counts pronounced legitimations by the authority vested in them by the emperor. The legitimation was intended to remove the taint of the bastard’s illegitimate birth and free the child of all the adverse social and legal consequences that resulted from it – the exclusion from honorable artisanal guilds, for example.

A similar procedure, *legitimatio ad honores* or *restitutio famae*, was used to cleanse dishonorable people of their mark of infamy. This was not only used to free dishonorable people of the dishonor with which they were born, but also to restore the honor of persons who had lost it, by suffering an honor punishment, for example, or by sexual misconduct. The emperor, the territorial lord, or the palatine count could by pronouncement restore the honor of that individual in its entirety \( *in integrum restitutio*\). A case that occurred in Regensburg in  presents a rather peculiar example of this restitution of honor: a journeyman farrier wanted to marry a young woman who had been ‘‘brought to fall and impregnated’’ a few years

*Artisanal honor and urban politics* before. When her child died shortly after birth, the young woman was ‘‘freed of the taint \( *macula*\) which attached to her’’ by a palatine count. When the farriers’ guild refused to recognize this restitution of honor and threatened to exclude the journeyman if he went through with this dishonorable marriage, the journeyman brought the case before the imperial aulic council \( *Reichshofrat*\), which decided in his favor and upheld the restitution by the palatine count. When Augsburg artisans were questioned how they would react to this case they declared that, as devoted subjects, they would honor the imperial order.

By far the majority of legitimations, of both bastards and infamous persons, were pronounced by the palatine counts, who were more readily accessible to the general public than the imperial bureaucracy. These palatine counts were persons to whom the emperor had delegated the right to name notaries, to bestow academic titles and dignities, or to grant legitimations. Usually they were members of the nobility or highly placed commoners, such as doctors of law. These officials first appeared in German territories in significant numbers in the fifteenth century. The first source on a palatine count legitimating an infamous person dates from . The number of palatine counts rose with the reception of Roman law, since these officials were necessary to the smooth functioning of the new law.

Many legitimations of dishonorable people have been preserved in Augsburg’s guild records. These were usually not legitimations of infamous persons from Augsburg, but involved requests from magistrates in other cities for legal opinions on the validity of the legitimations. Legitimations were usually challenged when a legitimated person attempted to join an honorable guild. Augsburg’s old, large, and prestigious guilds were asked to arbitrate the resulting dishonor conflicts in the lesser guilds of smaller towns. One of these disputes involved the legitimation of Hans Geißler from the neighboring town of Gu¨ntzburg, the son of a beadle who participated in criminal executions. His father was thus a *Blutscherge *\(‘‘blood-beadle’’\) in contrast to a simple *Stadtknecht *\(bailiff\). His legitimation was issued by a palatine count in Ulm in . It is worth quoting part of this legitimation, which presents a standard formula, in order to examine the language of such documents. 

The document first explained the privileges the palatine count had received from the emperor, allowing him to pronounce legitimations: I, Jacob Otto Ho¨gt, doctor of Roman and Canon law, imperial palatine count, do publicly declare that Leopold I . . . my most merciful Emperor and Lord, has conferred upon me . . . 

the mercy that I may free every and all disreputable and infamous persons of the taint, shame, and infamy that they bear by deed or by law. I may lift and remove the taint from them, and place them in their previous estate . . . 

Since the palatine counts were theoretically only supposed to pronounce legit-

*Honor and dishonor in the eighteenth century* imations if the circumstances of the case warranted it, the documents always explained the particulars of the case and emphasized that the candidate was worthy: Hans Geißler, beadle in Gu¨ntzburg, and his wife have mournfully informed me that they accepted this post \[of beadle\] to earn their piece of bread in these hard times. During their service they conceived a son, who from his early childhood until the present always behaved piously, obediently, and industriously. But they fear that in spite of his innocence, the boy might have to suffer on account of his parents, now that he is twelve and wants to make his fortune by learning an honorable trade. 

The count palatine then pronounced the legitimation and described its legal consequences:

I therefore free Hans Geißler . . . of the alleged taint and infamy, in which, though innocent by deed, he may have fallen according to the law. I place . . . him in the complete estate of honor of other honorable and respectable people . . . This alleged taint may not . . . bring any shame or dishonor to him or his descendants, in or out of court, but he must be admitted to all honors, crafts, guilds, associations, business deals, and inheritances . . . He is eligible for all privileges, freedoms, advantages, and rights . . . He may acquire citizenship in cities, towns, and villages . . . 

While the document never explicitly conceded that the beadle was in fact dishonorable and instead used the term ‘‘alleged taint’’ and the conditional tense, it implicitly admitted the dishonor by presenting the beadle’s need to ‘‘earn his piece of bread in these hard times’’ as justification for having accepted such a post in the first place. The document finally declared that in obedience to the emperor all local authorities were bound to ensure that the legitimation was honored in their territories. Any person who did not respect the legitimation was to be fined  gold marks.

The ideas behind such legitimations can perhaps be further illustrated by a popular legend from Frankfurt, first recorded in written form by nineteenth-century folklorists, and most likely told orally in the late eighteenth century, if not earlier. The legend is set in the twelfth century and tells of a costume ball emperor Frederick I Barbarossa held in honor of the empress, while he held court in the free imperial city of Frankfurt. At this ball, the empress danced repeatedly with a graceful young man whom she believed to be a local knight. Late in the evening the emperor demanded to know the identity of the stranger. He and his noble guests were horrified to learn that it was none other than Schelm von Bergen, the skinner from a nearby town, who had somehow intruded into this aristocratic gathering and had dared to taint the empress with his dishonoring touch. Aghast, knights and patricians waited for the emperor’s reaction. Would he kill the skinner on the spot to avenge this outrage and the potential dishonoring of his wife? But the quick-thinking skinner pointed out that if the empress had been tainted by his touch, his



*Artisanal honor and urban politics* blood could not wash away the stain. In fact, her majesty was so exalted that his dishonor could not possibly affect her. Indeed, the empress’s touch had cleansed him of *his * dishonor. Now the emperor should acknowledge the truth of this, by declaring him honorable and knighting him. Trying to make the best of the situation, the emperor did just that. And this was the origin of the Schelme von Bergen, a noble family from the environs of Frankfurt.

Certainly the events described in this legend never took place, not least because dishonor did not exist in this form in the twelfth century. But this tale illustrates the ideology of honor at the time the story was told, the idea of a dynamic flow of honor between orders in late medieval and early modern society. What took place in this legend was really nothing other than a legitimation, although it took a much more direct form than if it had been pronounced in a legal document or mediated through the person of a palatine count. Here the cleansing of dishonor was effected by the personal touch of the empress and then reinforced by the ennoblement that followed at the hands of the emperor. 

In the legend, the act of legitimation and the act of ennoblement are seen as similar procedures. The difference lay only in the degree to which an individual was elevated above his previous status in the society of estates. William Sewell has described the seventeenth-century legal theory that explained what happened in the act of ennoblement by the sovereign:

The Prince ‘‘whom God \(from whom all honor proceeds\) has established as distributor in this world of this divine gift’’ could ennoble a roturier . . . ‘‘These ennoblements purge the blood and the posterity of the ennobled of all stain of roture, and give it the same quality and dignity, as if from all time his race had been noble.’’ The prince, using the powers given him by God, apparently transformed the new noble’s blood, making it by his action essentially equal in quality to that of the *noblesse de race*. This quasi-miraculous change was permanent . . .

What happened here was quite similar to what occurred in a legitimation, when the

\(Beneke, p. \). Frederick Barbarossa reigned –. The legend is based on word association: The historic Schelme von Bergen were an aristocratic family who appear in local records from the twelfth century on. But the German word *Schelm * means skinner. The legend helped explain how the noble family came by such an abject name. 

 Sewell is describing French legal theory, but his description also applies to the German situation where the sovereign was likewise ‘‘the fount of honor.’’ William H. Sewell, ‘‘Etat, corps, and order: some notes on the social vocabulary of the French old regime,’’ in Hans Ulrich Wehler, ed., *Sozialgeschichte Heute. Festschrift fu¨r Hans Rosenberg zum . Geburtstag *\(Go¨ttingen, \), p. .

Both Sewell and Mousnier base their studies on the writings of the seventeenth-century jurist Charles Loyseau whose legal theory they see as a ‘‘blueprint’’ of the society of orders. 



*Honor and dishonor in the eighteenth century* emperor, territorial lord, or palatine count lifted all ‘‘taint and infamy’’ from dishonorable persons and ‘‘placed them in the complete estate of honor.’’

In theory, then, when the sovereign elevated the status of individual subjects, whether by a grant of nobility or by legitimation, this action fitted perfectlyin the logic of the society of orders. In practice legitimations did not always work so smoothly. 

Territorial and city governments were legally bound to honor such legitimations. To refuse to recognize them would have constituted *lèse majeste´ * towards the emperor, a denial of his imperial privileges. Accordingly, authorities generally granted legitimated individuals those rights that resulted from a legitimation. We saw, for example, that Marx Philipp and Johann Adam were granted citizenship. Problems arose, however, when legitimated persons tried to enter honorable guilds. 

As the number of palatine counts multiplied in the early modern period and the prestige of their office declined, so did the value of the legitimations they issued. 

Since the palatine counts charged for their services, the office could be profitable, opening the door to corruption. Complaints of abuse of office by palatine counts were first voiced in the sixteenth century, when they were accused of naming unqualified notaries. The palatine counts were generally not charged with corruption for issuing legitimations. Nonetheless, the legitimations of infamous persons were usually contested, especially by honorable artisans. This placed the political authorities in a quandary. On the one hand, they did not want to insult the palatine count, and by extension the emperor, or become involved in a costly court case. In

 the magistrates of the town of Wangen, for example, did not force their barber-surgeons to honor the legitimation of an executioner’s son who wanted to enter their guild. In response, the palatine count who had granted the legitimation demanded that the city government ‘‘maintain and protect the rights and privileges

. . . of his Imperial Majesty, our highest Lord,’’ i.e. that they enforce the legitimation, or he would bring suit at the imperial aulic council. On the other hand, if the authorities forced their guild to honor such legitimations, they risked precipitating a dishonor conflict within the guild. 

The fates of the son and grandson of the Gu¨ntzburg beadle Geißler give an idea of the effectiveness of such legitimations. The legitimation of Geißler’s son Johann Georg by a palatine count in  was quoted at length above. Johann Georg was twelve at that time. Apparently this legitimation was not effective, for in , at the age of twenty-three, Johann Georg petitioned his territorial lord for a second legitimation. The document of legitimation recounted the circumstances: ‘‘Johann Georg Geißler . . . has informed us that he is being harassed and held contemptible and prevented from making his fortune because his father is a beadle in Gu¨ntzburg.’’ His lord found him worthy of legitimation ‘‘in the light of his honorable good behavior, and because he has learned to read, write, and do arithmetic and can play various musical instruments.’’ So the taint of infamy was lifted from Johann

*Artisanal honor and urban politics* Georg for a second time. After his second legitimation, Johann Georg married and had several children. It is not clear how he earned his living. In  one of his sons, Franz Anthoni, wanted to begin an apprenticeship with the tailors’ guild in Gu¨ntzburg. This resulted in a dishonor conflict. The guild refused to accept him because he was the grandson of a beadle, who was still alive and ‘‘whose duties include chaining malefactors and handing them over to the hangman.’’ Two legitimations and the distance of one generation were not enough to erase the infamy attached to the office of a ‘‘blood-beadle.’’

The descendants of Johannes Volmayr, the executioner in the free imperial city of Isny, had a similar experience. Sometime before , Volmayr had slept with Anna Bach, a young unmarried woman and citizen of Isny, which resulted in the birth of a son, Johannes Bach. Anna did not marry Volmayr, but instead obtained a legitimation for herself and her son in , because, as her legitimation explained, 

‘‘such a child, in light of his dishonorable birth, and his mother, in light of her crime, would be excluded from all respectable crafts, guilds, societies, and citizenship . . . They would be prevented from seeking their temporal welfare.’’ The legitimation lifted all taint of infamy from mother and son, according to the standard formula. At first the legitimation was recognized. She married a master weaver, Gordian Schmidt, who soon began to instruct his stepson Johannes Bach in his trade. All went well for seven years. Schmidt and the young Johannes passed unchallenged in the weavers’ guild. But in  the journeymen instigated a dishonor conflict and went on strike, forcing the exclusion of Gordian Schmidt, who had made himself dishonorable by marrying an infamous woman, and of Johannes Bach, twice dishonorable as a bastard and executioner’s son. In spite of the efforts of the Isny magistrate on behalf of Schmidt and Bach, the guild and journeymen now refused to honor the legitimation. Schmidt and Bach were forced to earn a tenuous living as independent weavers outside of the guild. Nonetheless, young Bach married and had two sons. When he died a few years later, his widow was married a second time to another master weaver in . This master weaver trained Bach’s two sons as weavers. Again, all went well for a time. But in , when the Bach boys had completed their apprenticeship and wanted to become journeymen, the conflict flared up again. Guild and journeymen challenged the boys as dishonorable and demanded that they obtain a legitimation by a palatine count and then repeat their apprenticeship. In spite of their father’s legitimation, even though more than forty years had passed since their father’s dishonorable birth, the taint of infamy had not faded.

*Honor and dishonor in the eighteenth century* honorable people invested in legitimations. They really had no other choice. If dishonorable people, or their descendants, or individuals who had become infamous through contact with dishonorable people wanted to rise above their dishonorable status, their only option was to obtain a legitimation and hope that for once it would pass unchallenged. A case from  is particularly moving. A young Bavarian serving woman had slept with a farm laborer, unaware that he was a skinner’s son. She gave birth to a son, whom she placed under the care of her brother, a weaver, who began to train the boy in his craft. Inevitably a dishonor conflict erupted when the boy – twice dishonorable as a bastard and skinner’s son –

was to be officially inscribed as an apprentice in the weavers’ guild in Moßburg. In order to gain admission for her son, the mother first obtained a letter of recommendation from a local administrator certifying that the skinner’s son had always worked as a farm laborer and had never done skinner’s work. With this letter she traveled to Munich where she obtained a legitimation for her son from a palatine count. Predictably, the Moßburg guild refused to recognize the legitimation. The mother then traveled to the ‘‘main guild’’ \( *Hauptlade*\) in Landshut to petition for her son’s admission. The main guild turned her down as well. Finally she petitioned the elector of Bavaria who decreed that the weavers should accept the boy, though he allowed the guild to appeal the ruling. The Moßburg guildsmen wrote to their fellow tradesmen in Augsburg to gain their support for their resistance to the elector’s commands. We can assume that the conflict festered for years. Embark-ing on this bureaucratic odyssey, hiking through Bavaria from government agency to guild office, was the only available recourse for this peasant woman, though it offered little hope. 

THE PROLIFERATING CRITERIA OF INFAMY

Guild artisans raised their honor requirements to new heights in the eighteenth century. There was an explosion in the number of dishonor conflicts which Augsburg’s guildsmen were called upon to arbitrate. Of the  dishonor conflicts documented in Augsburg’s guild records between  and , the majority, 

cases, occurred between  and . Of course, these numbers might just be a reflection of improved source preservation in the eighteenth century. Taken alone,

, January , . It appears that dishonorable people obtained legitimations in the eighteenth century more than ever before. I have found one legitimation \(of a bastard\) from the sixteenth century, and only a handful from the seventeenth. This might be due to better preservation of eighteenth-century sources. However, the judicial archive of the counts of Fu¨rstenberg, palatine counts and lords of the small principality of Fu¨rstenberg, presents a similar pattern. Almost all legitimations of dishonorable people preserved in this archive date from the eighteenth century. 

Between  and  this one office pronounced nineteen legitimations of infamous persons. See Bader and von Platen, *Das große Palatinat, * pp. –.

*Artisanal honor and urban politics* they do not prove that the incidence of dishonor conflicts really increased. But there are additional indications that the guildsmen were applying the label of dishonor more widely. In the eighteenth century the stigma of dishonor seems to have been effective over more generations than in the previous century. In the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, dishonor conflicts erupted when the son or daughter of a dishonorable person sought to be incorporated in a guild. I have not discovered a single case from before  that involved the grandchild of a dishonorable person. But in the early eighteenth century the weavers of Krumbach refused to accept the son of a peasant whose wife’s father had worked as a beadle in a Swabian village in the s. In other words, the applicant was the grandson of a beadle. The peasant’s lord inquired with Augsburg whether the stigma of dishonor was effective over two generations, especially considering that the applicant’s mother was already eight years old when her father accepted the dishonoring job.

In  the tailors of Gu¨ntzburg, as we saw above, rejected the grandson of a

the city of Neuburg on the Danube conferred with Augsburg whether guildsmen could be forced to accept the great-grandson of a skinner. Neither his father nor grandfather had ever worked as skinners, and his father had received a legitimation. 

Augsburg pointed out that according to the imperial police ordinance of  the descendants of skinners were only excluded up to the second generation. But Augsburg’s magistrates recommended that Neuburg proceed with caution, because

‘‘we have had to learn from many a complaint’’ that imperial law was not uniformly enforced.

Dishonor not only extended over more generations in the eighteenth century, artisans also labeled additional trades as dishonorable. No case involving the dishonor of millers is documented in Augsburg’s guild records before . Millers were dishonorable in north and northeastern Germany, but in the eighteenth century their dishonor spread to the south. In  the town of Lindau informed Augsburg that a dishonor conflict had erupted in their coppersmiths’ guild when a miller wanted to have his son learn the trade. Augsburg’s millers responded that

*Honor and dishonor in the eighteenth century* their sons could learn any trade they chose without difficulties. In  a dishonor conflict broke out in the coppersmiths’ guild of Rothenburg ob der Tauber, when a master who had married a miller’s daughter wanted to have his son learn the trade. Grave-diggers were challenged as dishonorable only once before , during the linen-weavers’ strike of –. But in the early eighteenth century Augsburg’s grave-diggers complained bitterly that ‘‘artisans have touched our honorable name several times, as if we belonged among the contemptible persons, such as executioners and skinners . . . Every day we hear insulting words. Great conflict, fighting, and bloodflow might result, because we are artisans, and have journeymen and apprentices, and cannot suffer such insult . . .’’ In  the city of Regensburg inquired whether a grave-digger’s son would be acceptable to the coppersmiths. Augsburg’s coppersmiths answered equivocatingly: ‘‘Such a case never happened here . . .’’

In the eighteenth century, artisans also began to label more lower-level municipal or governmental employees as dishonorable, in addition to beadles and bailiffs. 

In  Augsburg’s calligraphers refused to accept the son of a customs officer. The bureaucrats who administered Augsburg’s customs office protested vigorously, because the sons of customs officers had never before been excluded from honorable guilds. In  the coopers of Memmingen rejected the son of the municipal employee responsible for controlling beggars. In  the Swabian circle attempted to coordinate measures against the pavers’, carpenters’, and stonemasons’ guilds of the town of Dillingen, because they refused to accept the son of a forester. Presumably, the artisans considered the forester dishonorable because he was involved in law enforcement when he hunted down poachers. The discrimination against dishonorable people, which had been mostly an urban phenomenon, extended into the countryside in the eighteenth century. In  the Bavarian government condemned the development that ‘‘skinners and beadles or their children are no longer tolerated, not only among artisans, but even among peasants, day-laborers, and servants in the countryside, so that they are completely excluded from all human company . . .’’

New attributions of dishonor could crystallize around almost any criteria, as Augsburg’s magistrates were well aware. In the months preceding the passage of the imperial police ordinance against artisanal abuses in , the imperial diet

*Artisanal honor and urban politics* requested counsel from city and territorial governments. In its report, Augsburg took exception to the wording of paragraph  that rehabilitated dishonorable trades. 

In addition to beadles and bailiffs, the paragraph declared linen-weavers, barbers, shepherds, millers, customs officers, pipers, trumpet players, and bathmasters to be honorable. Augsburg suggested that the law should instead refer only to ‘‘certain persons’’ \( *gewisser Personen*\). By listing the trades to be rehabilitated individually, the law might have the opposite effect. If these various crafts were named in the same paragraph as beadles and bailiffs, artisans would interpret the law to mean that they were of the same status. ‘‘Naming these persons would give the artisans cause to ridicule and defame them.’’ Reform legislation could become a cause of dishonor for such trades in areas where they were not dishonorable already. The imperial diet disregarded Augsburg’s suggestion and passed the legislation in its original wording. It is unclear whether the legislation contributed to the stigmatization of additional trades. 

The stigma of dishonor gained greater social force in the course of the eighteenth century, as the magistrates’ concerns illustrate. But when we take a closer look at the frequency of dishonor conflicts we are confronted with a startling development: while the total number of dishonor conflicts documented in the Augsburg guild records more than doubled in the eighteenth century, the incidence of conflicts occurring in Augsburg itself slowed to a trickle. Of the  dishonor conflicts that Augsburg’s guildsmen debated between  and , only fourteen took place at home, compared to nineteen dishonor conflicts that took place in Augsburg in the seventeenth century. Were Augsburg’s guildsmen more ‘‘enlightened’’ than their fellow tradesmen in the empire? Were Augsburg’s craftsmen becoming less sensitive to potential pollution by dishonor? The virulence of the conflicts that did occur in Augsburg in the eighteenth century demonstrates that Augsburg’s artisans did not develop any greater tolerance towards dishonorable people than their fellow tradesmen in neighboring cities and territories. The decrease in the number of cases in Augsburg did not result from any indifference to dishonor on the part of the artisans. 

Two of the conflicts in Augsburg were sparked by the dishonorable conduct of fellow tradesmen in other towns. In  some journeymen weavers in the neighboring free imperial city of Kaufbeuren participated in the funeral of the executioner’s twelve-year-old daughter. In response, Augsburg’s weavers organized a regional boycott to force the expulsion of these delinquent journeymen. This conflict dragged on until . The Augsburg weavers set off a similar conflict in

, when they organized a boycott against the weavers of the Swabian village Mu¨nsterhausen, because some members of that guild had been seen drinking with



*Honor and dishonor in the eighteenth century* the executioner. In both of these cases, Augsburg weavers acted as the enforcers of the artisanal honor code in the region. Both conflicts were set off by the Augsburgers’ external intervention in the affairs of neighboring guilds. 

A conflict *within * Augsburg’s weavers’ guild in  thwarted the city government’s plans to discipline the vagrant poor who were arrested begging in the city. 

The city set up a workhouse, literally a ‘‘discipline house’’ \( *Zuchthaus*\), where such vagrants were imprisoned and forced to earn their keep by weaving. The master weaver Johann Friedrich was employed as ‘‘discipline house father.’’ He was supposed to teach the inmates to weave and supervise their labor. He also enforced discipline by corporal punishment. Predictably, the weavers’ guild objected. They did not want inmates, some of whom were ‘‘infamous’’ because they had been subjected to an honor punishment, practicing their trade. Friedrich himself had become dishonorable, the weavers claimed, because of his involvement in criminal punishment, particularly because he personally whipped the inmates: ‘‘Many local citizens, from trades other than our own, refuse to drink with him at the same table, because they no longer consider him honorable.’’

Augsburg’s guildsmen went so far as to make murder threats to force the exclusion of candidates they considered dishonorable. In  the bookbinders wanted to expel an apprentice who they claimed was the son of a ‘‘blood beadle’’

\( *Blutscherge*\). Since the boy’s father was actually a bailiff who did not participate in criminal executions, the city government ordered the guild to accept him. This precipitated a dishonor conflict that lasted until . In an attempt to intimidate the apprentice’s father, the bookbinders sent him an anonymous letter in which they insinuated that his son might not survive the conflict: ‘‘if the journeymen get hold of him, he has to fear not only for his limbs, but for his life . . . It would be a pity if something should happen to him, since he is such a fine young man . . .’’

The artisans’ sensitivity to dishonor is demonstrated not only by the virulence of these conflicts, but also by the care Augsburgers took to avoid pollution. For example, Augsburg’s city government had considerable difficulty implementing their new policy of granting all ‘‘melancholy’’ suicides an honorable Christian burial. In order to prevent dishonor conflicts resulting from contact with the corpses of suicides, the magistrates decreed that the honorable persons who removed and buried the body should wear masks so that their identity would remain concealed. In spite of such precautions, the authorities at times were hard pressed to find honorable persons who were willing to participate in such an act of Christian charity. By the time the mayor succeeded in finding two honorable men who were willing to bury a suicide victim in , ‘‘the body smelled foul and was practically flowing apart.’’ The two men only agreed under the condition that the

The same fear of pollution impeded the city government’s efforts to introduce new ‘‘first aid’’ practices to the public. Starting in the s the city government regularly issued decrees ordering citizens to give first aid to victims of accident or suicide. In  the magistrates instructed the public that people who were pulled unconscious from the water might still be revived if they were given the proper treatment. The authorities encouraged bystanders to get the body out of the water and get help from barber-surgeons. The government also ordered people who came across someone who had hanged himself to cut down the body and attempt to revive the person. But the public resisted the government’s humanitarian decrees. An edict from Munich from  used by Augsburg as a model for some of its decrees declared: ‘‘In our enlightened century many such unlucky persons who were thought lost can be brought back to life . . .’’ But many accident and suicide victims were left to die, because of ‘‘the prejudice, which brings great shame to the enlightened humanity of our enlightened century, that declares that the merciful rescuer of a hanged person is dishonorable, if he just touches him . . .’’ An edict from Wu¨rttemberg from  proclaimed that ‘‘every human being and Christian, but especially every member of civil society’’ had the duty to try and save a fellow human being. Augsburg published a decree in the same year that exhorted the public not to let ‘‘false prejudice’’ or fear of being challenged as dishonorable \( *aus* *Besorgnis eines ehrenru¨hrigen Vorwurfs*\) prevent anyone from doing his ‘‘Christian and social duty,’’ his ‘‘duty to humanity.’’ A Brandenburg edict from 

attempted to combat such ‘‘prejudice’’ by threatening anyone who insulted a rescuer with imprisonment. Despite all efforts to educate the public concerning this issue, the Augsburg city government was unsuccessful in eradicating the ‘‘false prejudice’’ that such rescue attempts were dishonoring.

*Honor and dishonor in the eighteenth century*

SOFT-TREADING MAGISTRATES: APPEASING THE ARTISANS

If Augsburg’s artisans were as sensitive to dishonor as ever, how is the decrease in the number of conflicts in Augsburg to be explained? A possible answer lies in changing policies of the city government in dishonor conflicts. In seventeenth-century dishonor conflicts the authorities frequently had to admit defeat in the face of super-regional journeymen’s strikes. Dishonor conflicts were also a source of potential political unrest *within * the city. The city council had already learned this lesson in  when a crowd of journeyman weavers threatened to riot to force the exclusion of the skinner’s son from their guild. In the eighteenth century, outraged artisans questioned the legitimacy of the government when the magistrates intervened too aggressively in dishonor conflicts. In  the stonemasons’

guild expelled an apprentice for sexual misconduct. The council ordered the guild to readmit the apprentice and a conflict ensued that lasted until . The city government set out systematically to break the resistance of the guildsmen. When the stonemasons refused to accept the apprentice, the city government imprisoned the masters and journeymen for forty-eight hours. They forbade disobedient masters and journeymen to work or to write to their fellow tradesmen abroad concerning this conflict. Any master who wrote in defiance of this order would lose his citizenship. The city government also confiscated the stonemasons’ guild chest, the *Handwerkslade*, an object of great symbolic significance to the artisans. Mack Walker has described it as ‘‘a kind of ark of the guild covenant symbolizing the guild’s corporate authority and autonomy, repository of its official documents and secrets, ceremonially opened on the occasion of meetings of the membership.’’

The city government could afford to adopt such repressive measures in this conflict, because the stonemasons, in contrast to more highly skilled trades such as the goldsmiths or locksmiths, did not require their journeymen to travel as part of their craft training. The majority of the journeymen were local and many were married. Journeyman stonemasons could not escape the jurisdiction of the city government as easily as the more transient journeymen of other trades. 

In spite of the government’s strong-arm methods, the stonemasons refused to submit. If they could not write to fellow stonemasons in other cities, then they would write to the emperor, thus circumventing the city government and appealing directly to the ultimate authority in the empire. The artisans complained that their magistrates were governing ‘‘tyrannically’’: they were using violence to uphold an injustice. This petition reveals the political ideals of the guildsmen. One hundred and sixty-nine years after the guild government had been abolished and an authoritarian patrician regime had been set up, the guildsmen still clung to the notion that



*Artisanal honor and urban politics* the government could not simply rule by decree, but had to reach some sort of consensus with their citizens. The stonemasons addressed their petition to the emperor in , at a time when the city government was very vulnerable. The patrician city government was being investigated by an imperial commission for financial mismanagement, corruption, and nepotism. This investigation resulted from factional conflict among the patrician elite, and did not concern the artisans. 

Nonetheless it must have been quite embarrassing for the magistrates that the quality of their government was being questioned just as the imperial commission began its inquiry. The stonemasons took full advantage of this situation and asked the imperial commission to investigate their conflict as well.

In another dishonor conflict some forty years later, in , the artisans again accused the government of tyranny. This was the conflict in the bookbinders’ guild concerning the expulsion of a blood beadle’s son that was discussed above. In addition to making murder threats, the bookbinders also wrote various anonymous pamphlets attacking the city government and posted them in public places. One such sheet was attached to the city gate by night:

*Ho¨r Welt die dumme That, *

*was hier ein weiser Rat*

*umbs Gelt hat ausgesprochen. *

*Ein Scherg soll ehrlich sein, *

*doch dies nur auf den Schein. *

*Glaub nur, es wird gerochen, *

which a wise council here

has proclaimed for the sake of money. 

A beadle is supposed to be honorable, 

but this is only appearance.

in the entire land, 

that you are worse, 

you oppressors of artisans, 

you poor suckers, 

than skinners and beadles.



*Honor and dishonor in the eighteenth century* The logic of the pamphlet is as bumpy as the rhyme. Its author insinuated that the council had been bribed to proclaim that the beadle’s son was honorable. The council’s infamous deed was known all over the land. As ‘‘oppressors of artisans,’’

the council members were no better than skinners and beadles. 

In the course of the eighteenth century the city government seemed to become more hesitant to take on the artisans and set off such acrimonious conflicts. The magistrates increasingly opted for appeasement rather than confrontation. In 

the city government did nothing to prevent the weavers from organizing a boycott against their fellow tradesmen in Kaufbeuren, because their journeymen had helped carry the executioner’s daughter to her grave. The passive behavior of the city government in this case contrasts markedly with their active intervention when the stonemasons tried to expel the Mozart brothers for participating in the funeral of an executioner’s servant in . In that conflict, the government affirmed that the Mozarts had acted out of Christian charity and forced the guild to accept them. Also in  the town of Rainau conferred with Augsburg about two bailiff’s sons attempting to join the stonemasons’ guild. The patrician supervisors of Augsburg’s stonemasons reported that the guildsmen would refuse to accept the boys. Legitimations would not help, since experience showed that they could not be enforced. Augsburg gave increasingly equivocating and non-committal answers to foreign inquiries in order to avoid being entangled in dishonor conflicts abroad. 

When Zu¨rich inquired with Augsburg whether the linen-weavers could be forced to accept the legitimated daughter of an executioner, Augsburg responded that

‘‘similar cases have caused considerable conflict, confusion, and expense among the traveling journeymen. Therefore we hesitate to give a categorical answer, since this might cause evil consequences, which we have to be careful to avoid.’’ In , the Augsburg city government disregarded imperial law when they allowed the carpenters to expel a journeyman who had been subjected to judicial torture but found innocent. In the dishonor conflict in the bookbinders’ guild concerning the expulsion of the beadle’s son, the city government eventually gave in to the guildsmen’s demands. The council discreetly \( *unter der Hand*\) instructed the master of the dishonorable apprentice to tell the boy to get out of town.

The city government’s new policy of appeasing the artisans seems to have resulted not only from a desire to avoid conflict with the guildsmen, but also from a change in attitudes among the patrician magistrates that contrast with their more liberal policies of the seventeenth century. This is illustrated dramatically in a dishonor conflict that erupted in the millers’ guild in  when Joseph Klugheimer, a master’s son, eloped with and married the skinner’s daughter

*Artisanal honor and urban politics* Josepha Trenkler. The circumstances of the case were very similar to the conflict sparked by fisherman Andreas Anhauser’s marriage to the skinner’s daughter Barbara Leichnam almost a century earlier. Of course, the millers’ guild expelled the master’s son immediately, just as the fishermen had excluded Andreas Anhauser. What was different in this case was the reaction of the government. In the Anhauser case the magistrates had taken no action at all, beyond allowing the fishermen to expel Andreas. After their marriage in , Andreas and Barbara remained in Augsburg and earned their living as day-laborers. In , however, the government responded with great severity, far exceeding the guildsmen’s demands. After the millers expelled Klugheimer, both he and Josepha were arrested and fined for fornication. The magistrates conferred with church officials about whether a marriage between two persons of such ‘‘disparate status’’ could be considered valid. Unfortunately, the clerics’ response has not been preserved. The city government denied Klugheimer his paternal inheritance, took away his citizenship, and banished him and his bride from the city. The magistrates threatened to fire skinner Trenkler if he did not prevent his daughters from being all ‘‘too familiar’’ with local citizens’ sons. In past conflicts the authorities had merely reacted to the artisans. In this case they actively enforced the social exclusion of dishonorable people. 

Augsburg adopted a similar conservative stance in negotiations concerning the imperial decree of  that rehabilitated the children of skinners. By ordering guilds to accept the children of skinners, this edict went beyond the previous ordinance of  that still excluded skinners’ descendants through the second generation. The decree of  might have been even more radical had it not been for the resistance of Augsburg and other cities. The territorial states, and in particular Austria, pushed for more comprehensive legislation that would rehabilitate actual working skinners, not just their children. The territorial states made a mercantilist argument: the present dishonorable status of skinners damaged the public interest. There was an oversupply of skinners. Dishonor prevented them from earning their living in any other way. The growing population of unemployed vagrant skinners was an economic burden to the state. Bavaria, Swabia, and Franconia were completely overrun with vagrant skinners and this population threatened to spread to other territories as well. Indeed, ‘‘humanity \( *Menschlich-keit*\) demands that such persons without subsistence be given the possibility to earn their keep, especially since the state is enriched by the industriousness of its subjects.’’ The representatives of cities argued for the status quo. Rehabilitating skinners and their offspring would provoke unrest. Each local authority should determine for itself how to handle the problem. Most significantly, the proposed legislation threatened ‘‘the reputation and honor of all and every magisterial



*Honor and dishonor in the eighteenth century* authority of a free imperial city.’’ If the guilds were forced to incorporate skinners’ children, then the cities would have to grant them citizenship. As guildsmen and citizens, the skinners’ children would be eligible to sit on the large council. Under the patrician regime, the large council had served a merely symbolic and representative function. Nonetheless, by sitting on the council, skinners’

children would be incorporated in the city government itself. Augsburg instructed its representative at the imperial diet to argue against the rehabilitation of the skinners and their offspring. At the very least, the free imperial cities should be excused from implementing the new law until it was uniformly enforced in the large territorial states. In the end, the imperial diet ignored the objections of the free imperial cities and passed the legislation. In a slight concession, the decree did not mention the skinner himself. The children of skinners who had never done

‘‘this reprehensible work’’ were declared honorable. Those who had ‘‘actually practiced the contemptible work of their parents and ancestors’’ were to be admitted to guilds after receiving a legitimation. There is no indication that this legislation had any greater impact in social practice than the ordinance of . 

The magistrates’ new restrictive policy towards dishonorable people and their conciliatory stance towards guildsmen during dishonor conflicts presents a plausible explanation for the decrease in the number of dishonor conflicts in Augsburg itself, while the total number of cases increased. A dishonorable applicant’s attempt to enter an honorable guild would leave no trace in the records, if he was turned down at the onset and did not receive support from the city government. Most sources on dishonor were generated by the clash between guild and government, when a dishonorable person sought admission to a guild. 

But why did the city government take such a hard line towards dishonorable people, just at a time when such social discrimination was coming under increasing criticism? From the late seventeenth century on, legal scholars and social thinkers began to question the theoretical foundations of dishonor. Enlightened commentators and their bourgeois audience developed an internalized, individualized conception of honor that clashed with traditional corporate honor. Since dishonorable people became outcasts at birth, *Unehrlichkeit * could not be reconciled with the principles of natural law. Their dishonorable status in the society of orders did

*Artisanal honor and urban politics* not affect their natural honor. Natural law theorists like Christian Thomasius insisted that ‘‘true,’’ ‘‘reasonable’’ honor was an expression of the inner essence of the individual and could only be revealed in moral conduct. Natural honor should take precedence over traditional legal dishonor, which was merely an external attribute and had no moral meaning. In other words, in their view, dishonorable people had been denied full membership in the human community on the basis of a bogus distinction. Mercantalist writers condemned artisanal notions of dishonor as an obstacle to economic growth. Veit Ludwig von Seckendorff saw the ex-clusionary policies of artisan guilds as a limitation on state efforts to promote population growth. Johann Heinrich Gottlob von Justi argued that attributions of dishonor inhibited economic growth. Augsburg’s new conservative stance towards dishonorable people in the eighteenth century clashed with both enlightened and mercantilist theory. 

The policies of the city government reflected the influence of the Enlightenment in other areas, for example, in the decrease in the number of executions, in the administrative streamlining of the tax policy, the secularized policy towards suicide, and in the active and interventionist approach towards death evident in the new first aid edicts. Why did Enlightenment ideas have no impact on the government’s social policy towards dishonorable people? Augsburg’s patricians, not suprisingly, were less receptive to those aspects of Enlightenment culture that tended to undermine the traditional distinctions and privileges of corporate society. 

In other areas of Germany, learned societies and reading groups provided a forum for the popularization of enlightened ideas where members of different social estates interacted as equals. But such societies were not established in Augsburg,

where egalitarian sociability apparently held less appeal. In Augsburg and other free imperial cities social intercourse was characterized by a rigid formality, as the enlightened publicist Friedrich Nicolai observed in his travel journal. ‘‘. . . the estates are distinguished by a stiff etiquette and are more or less cut off from one another. The nobility, that is imperial officials, members of the cathedral chapter

. . . do not socialize with the patricians . . . The patricians keep their distance from the merchants, and the merchants try to distinguish themselves from the common citizens . . . A man of talent can make little claim here.’’ Even though the patricians exercised sovereign authority in Augsburg, they were snubbed by members of the rural nobility who did not regard the urban nobility as social equals. 

Nicolai was not the only bourgeois commentator to critique patrician exclusiveness. While passing through Augsburg in , Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart was

*Honor and dishonor in the eighteenth century* invited to perform in the home of the patrician magistrate von Langenmantel. The Langenmantel were an ancient family who had been members of the patriciate since the fourteenth century. Mozart described his visit to the magistrate in a letter to his father Leopold Mozart. ‘‘My uncle , . . . an honorable townsman, accompanied me and had the honor of waiting upstairs on the landing like a lackey until I should come out of the Arch-magistrate’s room. . . . \[Langenmantel\] addressed me in the second person, while I continued to address him as ‘Your Highness’ . . .’’ Leopold Mozart answered that his son should not to be surprised at the haughty conduct of Augsburg’s patricians. ‘‘Everyone knows about the beggarliness of the patricians and every honest man laughs about it. That is why they are in the pay of the rich merchants, who can get anything for money from their hungry superiors.’’

Nonetheless, patricians did not hesitate ‘‘to jeer at others, whenever an opportunity presents itself. Therein consists their great nobility.’’ Leopold Mozart was commenting on the notorious impoverishment of the patriciate. According to a satirical polemic published in , Augsburg patricians, having abandoned the commerce of their ancestors, ‘‘creep around in melancholy poverty, which exposes them to the contempt of the mob.’’ By the early seventeenth century most patricians had withdrawn from active trade. By the eighteenth century they were far less wealthy than the socially inferior merchants. They became completely dependent on well-remunerated lifetime appointments in city government which they treated as the sinecures of their estate. Paul von Stetten the younger, whose family dominated city politics in the eighteenth century, made this point quite explicitly, when he argued against the strict enforcement of rules against nepotism in city government. If blood relatives were prohibited from sitting on the council simultaneously, ‘‘most patrician families, which are often quite large, would be forced to leave the city and find their fortune elsewhere, or face utter ruin’’ at home. 

When von Stetten made this argument in , it had become unthinkable for a patrician to earn his living in any other way than by government service.

The political competency of the patrician government came under fire a number of times during the eighteenth century. Infighting among patricians in the early eighteenth century provoked an investigation by an imperial commission, which took up residence in Augsburg from  to . As an outcome of this expensive inquiry, older rules against nepotism were reconfirmed, though with little effect. 

Laws against nepotism were so difficult to enforce because there were simply not enough patricians available to fill all the council seats and government offices that the Caroline constitution had reserved for them. A number of patrician families had died out. An expansion of the patriciate, as had occurred in , might have

*Artisanal honor and urban politics* remedied the situation but was never discussed. Nepotism remained a chronic problem throughout the century. An opposition party made up of the politically disenfranchised merchant class emerged in the late eighteenth century, after patrician financial mismanagement had produced a catastrophic public debt. The merchants criticized patrician magistrates for arrogance, laziness, inefficiency, and excessive secrecy. City government in general was paralyzed by the ‘‘force of inertia.’’ Though this opposition never developed revolutionary demands or called into question patrician rule in principle, it occurred at the same time as the Enlightenment sparked a larger societal debate about aristocratic privilege. Enlightened critics championed equality before the law and extolled the ‘‘nobility of virtue’’ \( *Tugendadel*\) over nobility of birth, while cameralists questioned the social utility of the aristocratic estate. The same Johann Heinrich Gottlob von Justi who condemned artisans’ exclusion of dishonorable trades, recommended that aristocrats abandon the traditional principle of *deŕogeance * according to which

‘‘nobles are dishonored by engaging in commerce, manufacturing, or other activ-ities that are useful to the state.’’

In this context it is not surprising the patrician magistrates abandoned earlier attempts to rehabilitate dishonorable people and even reinforced their social exclusion. Urban society was structured according to a hierarchy of corporate groups, each of which had its own degree of honor. The patricians, the estate with the highest honor, formed the ruling caste. The patrician government could allow the rehabilitation of dishonorable people to go only so far. To break the resistance of honorable guilds and to force them to accept the skinner’s children would mean annihilating their corporate privileges. But a frontal attack on the corporate exclusiveness of the guilds would have made the corporate exclusiveness of Augsburg’s patricians, on which their claim to political power was based, untenable. A full and consistent rehabilitation of dishonorable people would have undermined the ideology of honor that legitimated the society of orders.
