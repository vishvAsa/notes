  <p>We have now considered in some detail what dishonor meant to executioners and skinners and how it shaped the particular social niche they occupied in Augsburg.</p>
<p>But beyond this core group of defiled trades, various other groups at times were challenged as dishonorable. Shepherds, bailiffs, grave-diggers, and latrine-cleaners were sometimes involved in dishonor conflicts in Augsburg. This chapter compares and contrasts the position of these groups on the periphery of dishonor with that of executioners and skinners in order to assess how the label of dishonor changed meanings as it was applied to different groups in different contexts. How did *Unehrlichkeit * affect the life chances of these trades on the periphery of dishonor?</p>
<p>Barbers and bathmasters were not considered dishonorable in Augsburg in the early modern period, though they were dishonorable in other areas of the empire.</p>
<p>Occasionally, however, their honor was challenged by guilds outside Augsburg. In contrast to bathmasters, linen-weavers, who were also labeled as dishonorable in other regions, were never challenged as dishonorable in Augsburg. A brief comparison of the dishonor of bathmasters, barbers, and linen-weavers in other areas demonstrates that it is necessary to study dishonor in its local context first, but also shows how super-regional influences and external pressures for conformity affected local conditions. We shall see how publicity, rumor, and insult contributed to the peculiar marginalization process these defiled trades underwent.</p>
<p>SHEPHERDS</p>
<p>Among these disparate groups, shepherds were the most dishonorable. The oldest source on shepherds’ dishonor is a privilege of the shoemakers’ guild in the north German town of Beeskow granted by the city council in  allowing the shoemakers to reject shepherds’ sons. North German guild roles required that applicants supply proof of their legitimate and honorable birth, and – in contrast to south German ordinances – usually listed the trades that were considered dishonorable. Along with linen-weavers, bathmasters, beadles, and many others,</p>
<p> Werner Jacobeit, <em>Schafhaltung und Scha¨fer in Zentraleuropa bis zum Beginn des </em>. *Jahrhunderts *(Berlin,</p>
<p>), p. . See also Theodor Hornberger, <em>Der Scha¨fer. Landes- und volkskundliche Bedeutung eines</em> *Berufsstandes in Su¨ddeutschland *(Stuttgart, ), pp. –; Otto Beneke, *Von unehrlichen Leuten. *</p>
<p>*Cultur-Historische Studien *(Hamburg, ), pp. –.</p>
<p> See above, introduction, pp. –.</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>On the periphery of dishonor</em></p>
<p>shepherds figured prominently in these lists. The butchers of Hildesheim barred shepherds, millers, and linen-weavers from their guild in . The smiths’ and tailors’ guilds of Hildesheim excluded shepherds and linen-weavers in .</p>
<p>Unlike the linen-weavers, however, who seem to have been labeled as dishonorable only in northern and northeastern Germany, shepherds were dishonorable almost everywhere. Most south German guilds were generally much less specific in their requirements of honorable background and did not include lists of tainted trades in their guild ordinances. However, the ordinance of the Frankfurt butchers’</p>
<p>guild from  is an exception. The guild roll did not list several dishonorable trades; it named only shepherds. A foreign journeyman who wanted to marry into the Frankfurt guild was required to present a birth certificate that attested that ‘‘he was born legitimately of a pious honorable father and mother and is not a shepherd’s son.’’ When south German ordinances named any trade that was to be excluded, this was always the shepherd. This was the case in Augsburg. Almost all of Augsburg’s guild ordinances required legimate and honorable birth only in general terms. The only exceptions are ordinances of the tanners’ guild. The tanners’ ordinance of  required that an apprentice be ‘‘born a child of marriage, and not a bastard . . ., and also not the son of a shepherd or others of this kind.’’ The ordinance of  repeated this requirement verbatim.</p>
<p>From  on imperial legislation opposed this ‘‘abuse’’ and attempted to rehabilitate shepherds. The imperial police ordinances of  to  and the proposal of  declared shepherds to be honorable, though to little effect.</p>
<p>Shepherds were considered extremely dishonorable because some aspects of their trade resembled skinner’s work. Many shepherds killed diseased sheep and skinned the carcasses themselves, thus likening themselves to the skinner. This association of shepherd and skinner was expressed in popular rhyme:</p>
<p><em>‘‘Scha¨fer und Schinder sind Geschwisterkinder.’’</em></p>
<p>Shepherds and skinners are siblings’ offspring.</p>
<p>Because shepherds often did the same ‘‘repulsive,’’ ‘‘horrific,’’ and ‘‘disgusting’’</p>
<p>work as skinners, they were, after executioners and skinners, the most defiled among dishonorable trades.</p>
<p>The extent of their dishonor is illustrated in a conflict that occurred in the Augsburg tanners’ guild in . When the shepherd’s son Elias Tregelin tried to work in Augsburg as a journeyman tanner, the tanners’ guild rejected him. The</p>

<p><em>The dishonorable milieu</em></p>
<p>imperial police ordinance of  was not being enforced in the empire, the tanners argued, and they were obliged to uphold their privileges and traditions as laid down in their ordinances. The journeyman’s father, the shepherd Adam Tregelin, however, denied that he was dishonorable. It was necessary to make distinctions among shepherds, he argued. Honorable shepherds did not do the ‘‘repulsive’’</p>
<p>( <em>abscheulich</em>) work of killing diseased sheep and skinning the carcasses themselves.</p>
<p>They employed special laborers for such tasks. Children of honorable shepherds should be admitted to guilds, in accordance with the imperial police ordinance of</p>
<p>. The guildsmen responded that even if Tregelin and his son did not skin sheep personally, they lodged the dishonorable servants who did in their home and ate with them at the same table. By such intimate association, the Tregelins participated in their servants’ dishonor. When Tregelin denied eating with these laborers and claimed they were housed separately, the tanners argued that just because Tregelin was wealthy enough to pay special laborers to do the skinning, he should not be considered honorable. Ultimately he was no better than the servants he employed and their dishonor fell back on him. Wishing to avoid a strike among the journeyman tanners, the Augsburg city government decided in favor of the tanners’ guild, and justified its decision by agreeing with the tanners that the imperial police ordinance of  was not being uniformly enforced.</p>
<p>Fifty years later, the city of Augsburg was asked to arbitrate a similar case that had occurred in the neighboring free imperial city of No¨rdlingen. In  Martin Eisenbarth, a wealthy peasant from the small Swabian village of Wertingen, had sent his son to the nearby No¨rdlingen to learn the weavers’ trade. But the guild refused to apprentice the boy: the peasant had large landholdings on which he grazed cattle and sheep. He owned sheepdogs and employed ‘‘special laborers and shepherds’’ to take care of the sheep. A special shack was located on his property where meat and skins of sheep that had died were stored. Neither the peasant nor his son ever tended the sheep personally, but because he employed shepherds who skinned diseased sheep and stored the meat on his property, the No¨rdlingen weavers’ guild rejected the peasant’s son.</p>
<p>The No¨rdlingen city government inquired with Augsburg how the case should be handled. Augsburg’s magistrates in turn questioned their weavers about how they would react to such a case. First, Augsburg’s weavers carefully stated that a shepherd’s son or others ‘‘of this kind’’ had never trained or wanted to train in their guild. But then they conceded that they would be willing to accept the peasant’s son, because the imperial police ordinance of  declared shepherds to be honorable, and because this peasant’s son had never personally tended sheep.</p>
<p>Though the No¨rdlingen city council followed Augsburg’s recommendation and decided the conflict in favor of the peasant and his son, this decree was never enforced. The young Eisenbarth was forced to do his apprenticeship in the town of</p>

<p>Lauingen instead of in No¨rdlingen, and when he returned to No¨rdlingen four years later the weavers organized a boycott against him a second time.</p>
<p>These cases show the extent to which shepherds were considered polluting.</p>
<p>Neither the young Tregelin nor Eisenbarth had ever done the dishonorable work of skinning personally or even tended sheep, nor had their fathers. But even the most tenuous connection with this type of work – the artisans even attached significance to the fact that the Tregelins and Eisenbarths owned sheepdogs – was enough to leave a taint of dishonor. But in spite of shepherds’ strong dishonor, very few dishonor conflicts documented in the Augsburg guild records involved shepherds.</p>
<p>The Tregelin conflict is the only Augsburg case of its kind before the eighteenth century. Since Augsburg, unlike the free imperial cities of Nuremberg or Ulm, did not own much territory outside the city walls, it stands to reason that relatively few shepherds lived within the city. Perhaps this explains why so few of the dishonor conflicts that occurred in Augsburg’s guilds involved shepherds and why no sources are available from which to construct any kind of social profile of shepherds.</p>
<p>We can only note the social and economic status of two individuals, the shepherd Tregelin and the peasant Eisenbarth. Tregelin was described as a wealthy and well-respected member of his rural community. The same was true of Eisenbarth.</p>
<p>To support his son’s case, the peasant presented a birth certificate in which local authorities attested that the peasant was of legitimate and free birth (i.e. he was not a serf ), that he was of honorable stock, and had a good reputation. The birth certificate also pointed out that the peasant’s father had been a juror in the village court, a sign of the family’s good reputation in the village community. The peasants who lived in close proximity with Tregelin and Eisenbarth apparently did not consider them dishonorable. Their dishonor became relevant only when they came in contact with urban artisans, to whom their wealth and standing in their rural communities were irrelevant and who considered shepherds every bit as contaminating as skinners.</p>
<p>BAILIFFS</p>
<p>The group most often embroiled in dishonor conflicts in Augsburg were the <em>Stadtknechte</em>, the mayors’ bailiffs. Augsburg employed six bailiffs, who had a variety of duties. They accompanied the mayors on official business, ran errands for them, and delivered messages and subpoenas. They also patrolled the streets and arrested and imprisoned offenders. Sometimes they whipped delinquents or escorted them</p>

<p>to the pillory or to the border of Augsburg’s territory in case of banishment. It had long been Augsburg’s policy, however, to isolate bailiffs from serious criminals as much as possible. Bailiffs did not participate in the torture and interrogation of</p>
<p>‘‘malefactors’’ ( <em>Malefikanten</em>, i.e. serious felons) and they were not involved in the execution process. All this was done by the executioner, his servants, and the dungeon guards. In contrast to these groups the mayors’ bailiffs were always citizens. By division of labor and legal distinctions, the authorities hoped to shield the bailiffs from the executioner’s dishonor. Thus it was always the official policy of the authorities that bailiffs were not dishonorable. This official stance was reinforced by the imperial proposal of , which made the same distinction between beadles who dealt with ‘‘malefactors’’ and bailiffs who did not.</p>
<p>Augsburg’s efforts to contain dishonor had little effect, however. When bailiffs tried to apprentice their sons to craftsmen or when artisans married bailiffs’</p>
<p>daughters, conflicts erupted in the guilds, though few such conflicts occurred before the late sixteenth century. Bailiffs’ dishonorable status was established in the course of the seventeenth century.</p>
<p>The experience of one bailiff’s family will illustrate the growing social impact of dishonor on bailiffs’ children. Tobias Frank had been employed as a bailiff in Augsburg at least since . In  the bailiff tried to apprentice his young son Hans Jerg to the goldsmiths’ guild. The goldsmiths refused – without giving a reason. Frank and his colleagues protested to the council: the goldsmiths were insinuating that bailiffs were dishonorable. The council stuck to its policy that bailiffs were not dishonorable and ordered the goldsmiths to accept the bailiff’s son.</p>
<p>This decree was made palatable to the goldsmiths by emphasizing that Hans Jerg had been ‘‘conceived’’ before Frank had been hired as a bailiff, so he was not</p>
<p>‘‘really’’ a bailiff’s son. Hans Jerg Frank was inscribed as an apprentice goldsmith in</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>In  Frank apprenticed his second son Tobias to a tailor, apparently without encountering any resistance. However, when Frank tried to inscribe his third son Anthoni with the goldsmiths’ guild in , this resulted in another more vicious dishonor conflict. Anthoni had been ‘‘conceived’’ during Frank’s employment as bailiff. The goldsmiths no longer beat around the bush. They now argued explicitly that bailiffs were dishonorable. Their dishonor derived from the similarity of their duties to the work of the executioner. The journeymen would go on strike if the bailiff’s son were inscribed. The goldsmiths warned that even if Anthoni managed</p>

<p>to complete his apprenticeship, he was in danger of losing life or limb on the road where Augsburg authorities could not protect him from the assaults of his fellow journeymen. In spite of these protests, the council ordered the goldsmiths to accept the bailiff’s son. Anthoni was inscribed as an apprentice in .</p>
<p>All the decrees defending the bailiff’s honor represented partial victories at best, however, as the subsequent fate of the Frank brothers demonstrates. In </p>
<p>Anthoni was no longer working as a goldsmith. He was employed as a musician at the court of the count of the Palatinate. When he wanted to learn to play the trumpet, the trumpeters rejected him because he was a bailiff’s son. His brother Tobias was not working as a tailor in . Asked about his means of livelihood when he was arrested for a minor offense in that year, he testified that he had learned the tailor’s craft but did not become a master. He had also learned beer brewing, but did not practice that trade either. He had worked a while as a city guard. Now he made his living in a horse rental business. In  he enlisted in a military regiment. The records do not show what became of Frank’s eldest son, Hans Jerg, who was not ‘‘really’’ a bailiff’s son.</p>
<p>The goldsmiths appear to have been correct in pointing out that Augsburg’s magistrates could force local masters to inscribe a dishonorable candidate in their guild, but on the road governmental decrees would not protect a bailiff’s son from the violence of his fellow journeymen. Presumably, such harassment by honorable journeymen forced Frank’s sons to abandon their careers as artisans. Faced with his sons’ failures, the bailiff did not even try to apprentice his youngest son Elias with an honorable guild in . Instead he placed Elias with a musician to learn the</p>
<p>‘‘free’’ (i.e. non-guild) art of trumpet playing.</p>
<p>When Tobias Frank accepted a position as bailiff sometime before , he had no idea that his position would compromise his sons’ honor and livelihood. He said as much during his conflict with the goldsmiths: ‘‘What honorable father would act so shamelessly towards his own children and accept such a position if he knew that this job would make him and his children dishonorable for all time?’’ Frank came from a local family and like all mayors’ bailiffs he was a citizen. Frank’s father was a small retailer. Presumably Frank himself was working as a retailer or artisan before being hired as bailiff. At that time little stigma seems to have been attached to the position. Bailiffs were well integrated in the artisanal milieu.

<p><em>The dishonorable milieu</em></p>
<p>occurred frequently and bailiffs served regularly as guarantors at guildsmen’s weddings. In a legal brief on the Frank case, Augsburg’s syndics pointed out that most bailiffs and other city guards were artisans, particularly weavers, who returned to their workshops when they retired from their municipal posts. Artisans, especially if they were as impoverished as many weavers, did not hesitate to accept such a position, which offered a regular salary and benefits. In  bailiffs were paid  gulden per quarter and a yearly payment of  gulden as a new year’s bonus.</p>
<p>In addition they received a clothing allowance of  gulden per year, presumably to pay for their uniforms. They lived in rent-free apartments beneath the town hall and received free allotments of firewood. Bailiffs were paid all sorts of incidental fees, tips, and emoluments. They received an ‘‘unlocking fee’’ of  kreuzer (.</p>
<p>gulden) every time they locked a delinquent in a cell or released him. Presumably they were paid a separate fee for each errand they performed, but the fee rates have not been preserved. When the position of mayor changed hands, which happened four times a year, each bailiff was paid  gulden  kreuzer. Collectively they were granted  gulden yearly to spend on wine. They were entitled to soup and bread every morning and every Sunday and holiday they received two measures of wine, six rolls, and cheese. It is impossible to estimate what all this added up to, but bailiffs do seem to have fared better than the majority of their fellow citizens. The *habnit *(‘‘have nothing’’) tax was the basic head tax required of all citizens regardless of economic status. Citizens who paid the *habnit * tax did not own enough assets to be required to pay property taxes. In ,  percent of Augsburg’s citizens paid this *habnit * tax. An additional  percent of the citizenry paid between  and </p>
<p>kreuzer property taxes. All of Augsburg’s bailiffs paid more than this. These bailiffs, then, were in a better economic position than  percent of their fellow citizens, and the citizens were themselves a privileged minority. Five of Augsburg’s bailiffs paid taxes with the next  percent of the citizenry who paid between  and</p>
<p> kreuzer. All five bailiffs paid  kreuzer. The sixth bailiff was Tobias Frank, who paid  gulden  kreuzer property tax on real estate worth , gulden, which placed him in the top  percent of the citizenry. But even without this information, it is clear that Frank was relatively well off.

<p>hefty fees required to inscribe apprentices with the goldsmiths’ guild, his dishonor conflicts with the goldsmiths would never have occurred.</p>
<p>But Frank’s money did not enable him to buy his way back out of dishonor. The dishonor of the bailiffs became more pronounced in the course of the century. In</p>
<p> the bailiff Hans Bauer, a member of the weavers’ guild, was fired for being involved in a brawl. He apparently encountered some difficulties in returning to weaving, because the city government issued a decree on his behalf, declaring once again that Augsburg’s bailiffs did not deal with malefactors and that they were therefore honorable. But when Bauer still had not found a means of livelihood in</p>
<p>, the city government gave him another municipal position – as grave-digger.</p>
<p>The city government had issued a decree in  that declared that bailiffs’ sons were accepted without protest in the guilds of the weavers, furriers, stonemasons, shoemakers, tailors, carpenters, and embroiderers, but as the century progressed such declarations were increasingly out of touch with social reality.</p>
<p>In  the weaver Johann Georg Vogel married the daughter of a bailiff from the neighboring Bavarian city Landsberg am Lech. This marriage precipitated a virulent dishonor conflict within the weavers’ guild. Landsberg authorities attested that their bailiffs did not deal with malefactors and never participated in executions, since capital punishment fell under the jurisdiction of the Bavarian state, not of the city government. Augsburg ruled in Vogel’s favor and ordered the weavers’ guild to accept him. In spite of favorable governmental decrees, however, the conflict dragged on for years. In the Frank case the goldsmiths had only threatened that the journeymen would go on strike. In this case the journeyman weavers actually did strike, organizing a regional boycott. Three years later, in , Vogel was on the brink of bankruptcy, and there was still no sign that the conflict was nearing resolution. At this point, his case disappears from the records.</p>
<p>Faced with the unremitting resistance of artisans, the Augsburg magistrates were beginning to waver in their policy of forcing guilds to accept bailiffs’ sons.</p>
<p>The bailiff Christoph Hu¨ttling’s attempt to apprentice his son Georg to the shoemakers’ guild in  is a case in point. In a desperate petition, Hu¨ttling wrote to the council that he was burdened with many children. They were all old enough to begin their craft training but he was unable to place them. The tailors had just refused to accept his son Georg. Whereas in earlier conflicts the city government had quickly decided the case in favor of the bailiff, Augsburg now conferred with Regensburg, Ulm, and Nuremberg before issuing a decree. All these cities answered that their artisans considered bailiffs dishonorable and re-</p>

<p><em>The dishonorable milieu</em></p>
<p>fused to accept their sons. Faced with these responses, the Augsburg city government equivocated and refused to issue a decree one way or the other. In , two years after he had made his initial petition, the bailiff Hu¨ttling was quietly advised to drop the case. The records do not show what became of the bailiff and his many children.</p>
<p>In  a dishonor conflict broke out among Augsburg’s linen-weavers which did not subside until . During this time the journeymen went on strike intermittently. The main focus of the strikes was the bailiffs’ sons who were working as linen-weavers, though the journeymen challenged various other city guards, grave-diggers, and latrine-cleaners as dishonorable as well. The linen-weavers’ demands illustrate the severe decline in social status that bailiffs had experienced in the course of the seventeenth century. In the beginning of the century the sons of Augsburg’s bailiffs could be found working in almost any guild.</p>
<p>The allergic reaction of the goldsmiths to the apprenticeships of the sons of bailiff Frank was the exception rather than the rule. But in  the linen-weavers complained that they were the only craft that was still required to accept bailiffs.</p>
<p>When other guilds rejected bailiffs’ sons, the city government quietly acquiesced.</p>
<p>Now the linen-weavers would no longer accept this indignity. In the beginning of the century honorable artisans had moved in and out of the bailiffs’ positions without difficulty, but by the s artisans only took these positions out of dire necessity. In  the government of Trier described bailifs as ‘‘honorable citizens and guildsmen who end up in these positions because of poverty.’’ In </p>
<p>Augsburg’s administrators reported that only people ‘‘pressed by extreme poverty’’</p>
<p>( <em>extrema paupertate pressus</em>) were willing to become bailiffs.</p>
<p>The Augsburg city government reacted to the linen-weavers’ strike with traditional measures of insulating and containing dishonor by division of labor. The magistrates sought to appease the striking linen-weavers by hiring two additional *Malefizschergen *(‘‘sergeants for malefactors’’), beadles who would deal with serious felons, shielding bailiffs from contact with serious criminals. The city government had always been careful not to involve bailiffs in executions; after the *Malefizschergen * were hired the bailiffs did not even arrest and imprison serious criminals before the interrogations began. After these reforms, bailiffs could no longer be considered dishonorable, the government argued. The linen-weavers agreed to let those bailiffs and bailiffs’ sons who were incorporated in their guild work alone without apprentices and journeymen. The problem would be solved gradually by letting these bailiffs ‘‘die off’’ ( <em>absterben lassen</em>), rather than by expelling them all at once, which would only create additional disruption and hardship.</p>

<p><em>On the periphery of dishonor</em></p>
<p>GRAVE-DIGGERS AND ‘‘NIGHT-WORKERS’’</p>
<p>The journeyman linen-weavers also challenged two other groups, grave-diggers and latrine-cleaners as dishonorable. Grave-diggers were apparently considered dishonorable in some areas of the empire in the early sixteenth century, since the imperial police ordinance of  sought to rehabilitate them. The chief latrine-cleaner was called ‘‘night-king’’ ( <em>Nachtko¨nig</em>) and his team of laborers were called</p>
<p>‘‘night-workers’’ ( <em>Nachtarbeiter</em>) because they did their work at night when the streets were empty and the stench was least likely to disturb the citizens. Grave-diggers and latrine-cleaners regularly appear on all the lists of dishonorable trades that modern historians and folklorists have compiled. However, the linen-weavers’ strike of – presents the only occasion these groups were labeled dishonorable in Augsburg before the eighteenth century. Like the bailiffs, many of Augsburg’s grave-diggers were recruited from the artisanate. In  the fisherman Martin Widemann applied for the position of grave-digger and was hired. In </p>
<p>the grave-digger Hans Leser was at the same time a weaver. In  the grave-digger Hans Freitag was also listed as a weaver. In  the grave-digger Thomas Feinler described himself as a weaver. In  Hans Luz was working as a stonemason and grave-digger. In  Martin Kromer was listed as both grave-digger and weaver. Grave-diggers and their sons seemed to move in and out of weaving without encountering any resistance. As weavers, all these men were members of an honorable, albeit impoverished guild. As guildsmen, they were also citizens. Even grave-diggers who did not give an alternate profession all signed their petitions or contracts as ‘‘citizens.’’ Those serving as guarantors or guardians for grave-diggers were mostly weavers, but they also included a furrier, a dyer, a gardener, and a cabinet-maker. Grave-diggers do not appear as a group separate from the artisanal milieu. Hard times presumably compelled many of these artisans to supplement their income as craftsmen with the salary of a grave-digger, an assumption which is all the more likely since most grave-diggers came from the weavers’ guild, which incorporated many impoverished masters.</p>

<p><em>The dishonorable milieu</em></p>
<p>After the bailiffs and the grave-diggers, the striking journeyman linen-weavers also wanted to exclude the latrine-cleaners from their guild. In considering the social background of the latrine-cleaners, it is necessary to distinguish between the chief latrine-cleaner, the ‘‘night-king,’’ and his team of laborers, the ‘‘night-workers.’’ Since the night-king shared the same house as the executioner and worked under his supervision, one would expect the night-king to be clearly dishonorable. But as we saw in chapter , the boundary of honor was not always predictable and artisans did not conform to modern expectations of consistency in their labeling of dishonorable groups. In spite of his close association with the executioner, the ‘‘night-king’’ was not dishonorable. Night-kings presented a similar social profile as the grave-diggers. All were guildsmen and citizens. Balthasar Geiger served as night-king from  to  and was also a member of the weavers’ guild. Hans Scheibenhart, who was employed as night-king from  to</p>
<p>, was a weaver as well. Samuel Schu¨tz, who was employed from  to , was also a weaver. He signed his correspondence as ‘‘Citzen and weaver and my Lords’ night-worker.’’ Not only were night-kings recruited from the artisanate, they were also not segregated from honorable artisans once they held the position.</p>
<p>Michael Fru¨holz was the night-king from  to . Fru¨holz was a stonemason.</p>
<p>Fru¨holz’s two sons were working as journeyman stonemasons while they shared the executioner’s house. Tobias Schaumann, yet another weaver, filled the night-king’s post from  at least until . The night-king’s team of night-workers were of lesser status, however. In contrast to their master, they were not citizens or guildsmen. They seem to have been unskilled rural immigrants who were granted permission to reside in Augsburg for as long as they were employed. But this lower status did not make them dishonorable. Like the grave-diggers, the night-kings or night-workers were not challenged as dishonorable in Augsburg before the eighteenth century, except on the occasion of the journeyman linen-weavers’ strike in .</p>
<p>On what grounds did the linen-weavers label night-workers and grave-diggers as dishonorable? In the summer of  four journeyman linen-weavers discussed the goals of their strike in an alley by night, as a spy listened in. The spy reported the content of their conversation to the authorities: the children of the night-workers were dishonorable, because the night-workers used the horses and wagon of the executioner to transport the feces. In the reasoning of the linen-weavers, the source</p>

<p><em>On the periphery of dishonor</em></p>
<p>of the night-workers’ dishonor lay not in their contact with feces, but in their contact with the executioner’s horses and wagons. In this same conversation, the linen-weavers announced their intention to exclude grave-diggers from their guild. Hauled in for questioning, the journeymen explained why. They did not want to exclude all grave-diggers, they claimed, only those who had buried the corpses of executed delinquents. It was not the contact with dead bodies in itself that made grave-diggers dishonorable, but by handling the bodies of executed delinquents they participated in the execution process and were affected by the executioner’s dishonor. The filthy and stinking work of night-workers and grave-diggers, their constant exposure to feces and rotting corpses was not relevant in the linen-weavers’ explanation of dishonor. In other words, the labeling of grave-diggers and latrine-cleaners was not the result of a rising threshold of disgust as part of a ‘‘civilizing process.’’ Instead, once again, in the reasoning of the journeymen the dishonor of these groups derived from association with the executioner.</p>
<p>BATHMASTERS AND BARBER-SURGEONS</p>
<p>We should now consider the social status of Augsburg’s bathmasters and barbers.</p>
<p>These trades were considered honorable in Augsburg, though they were labeled as dishonorable in other parts of the empire. The bathmasters and barbers first appeared among the tainted trades listed in north German guild documents in the late fourteenth century. A birth certificate of a journeyman goldsmith issued in Cologne in  specified that he was ‘‘not the child of a barber, a minstrel, or a vagrant, but he is the child of an honorable and pious man.’’ In Cologne such exclusion from honorable guilds was compounded by political discrimination. Even though barbers were citizens and formed a guild of their own at least since , they were denied representation on the city council from  on. How did the barbers respond to such discrimination? A document from  gives an idea. This was a list of those master barbers who could prove their legitimate birth. Apparently the barbers were trying to establish legitimacy as a prerequisite for admission to their guild. Thus the barbers were attempting to gain honor by living up to higher moral standards and by imitating the social exclusiveness of other guilds. In the fifteenth century this strategy only met with limited success. Their exclusion</p>

<p>from the city council was reconfirmed in . In that year they petitioned to send a representative to the council, but were turned down: barbers had been barred from the council for fifty-four years, they were told, and there was no reason to change this custom now. It is not clear how long such political discrimination continued in Cologne and to what extent barbers’ dishonorable status changed in the early modern period.</p>
<p>There is no firm evidence for discrimination against bathmasters and barbers in Augsburg. While they regularly appear in late medieval records, little is known on the legal status of these trades before the Caroline constitutional reform of . As guildsmen they were, of course, citizens, but it appears that they were not represented on the city council before . According to a chronicle entry, barbers and bathmasters were exempt from the duty of sending a representative to the council, because in their capacity as surgeons they were on call at all times. The chronicler thus cast their non-representation as an exemption or privilege rather than as an exclusion. The bathmasters did not see it that way. In the early sixteenth century, according to another chronicler, the bathmasters were incorporated into one political guild with the coopers, the coach-builders, and the turners. A dispute allegedly occurred in the guild sometime before  on who should be their representative in the council. At this point the bathmasters, ‘‘who were the most well off among [these trades]’’ and whose craft owned substantial assets, decided to split off from the collective guild and to form their own guild. The bathmasters then asked to be allowed to send a representative to the council. But, the chronicler reported, they were turned down ‘‘because in other cities of the empire no bathmaster can be found on the council.’’</p>
<p>The bathmasters gained political representation with the Caroline reform, when they joined with the barbers to form one guild. The crafts of the bathmasters and barbers were almost identical, with the one defining difference that bathmasters operated public baths and the barbers did not. Both shaved and cut hair, though the barbers were limited to ‘‘dry-cutting’’ ( <em>truckhen scheeren</em>), which simply meant that the haircuts and shaves did not include a bath. Both cured syphilis and did surgery, let blood, set broken bones, and amputated limbs. Both were highly skilled trades.</p>
<p>In  bathmasters and barbers were required to complete a two-year apprenticeship and work as journeymen for five years. Only then were they eligible to take an examination required of aspiring masters. By , the period of professional</p>

<p>training had been lengthened to a total of ten years, and journeymen were required to ‘‘wander’’ for three years. While these requirements might have been motivated more by the desire to limit the number of masters and thus limit competition than by genuine concern for the professional training of young masters, another document gives a clearer picture of the level of skill necessary in this trade. A description of the traditional customs of barbers compiled in  stated that a new apprentice had to be able to read and write, ‘‘and if he knows Latin, that is even better, so that he can understand the authors and the terminology.’’</p>
<p>In  the bathmasters’ and barbers’ guild included sixteen bathmasters and eighteen barbers. Economic competition and incessant conflict over what constituted the correct division of labor between the two trades led bathmasters and barbers to split up and form separate guilds in . In , five years after the break-up, fourteen bathmasters and nineteen barbers were operating in Augsburg. The early sixteenth-century chronicler, as we saw, described the bathmasters as well off. This impression is confirmed by Bernd Roeck’s analysis of their tax payments. Only . percent of bathmasters, barbers, and other medical practitioners paid the *habnit * tax, compared to  percent of the general citizenry. The bathmasters seem to have been the wealthiest of the medical practitioners. .</p>
<p>percent of bathmasters paid over one gulden in property taxes, and . percent of bathmasters paid taxes over ten gulden, compared to . percent and . percent of the citizenry respectively.</p>
<p>Bathmasters and barbers were never involved in a dishonor conflict in Augsburg.</p>
<p>However, when dishonor conflicts involving bathmasters erupted in other areas, local guilds and governments sometimes directed inquiries to Augsburg on the status of bathmasters there. In  the city government of Eger in Bohemia wrote to Augsburg about a dispute which had occurred in their coopers’ guild. The coopers were refusing to apprentice the sons of bathmasters and excluding guild members who married bathmasters’ daughters. When the Eger magistrate ordered their coopers to obey the imperial police ordinance of , the coopers argued that the ordinance was not being enforced in the empire. In Augsburg, they claimed, honorable guilds did not admit bathmasters. Eger’s magistrates then wrote to Augsburg to find out what really was the practice there. This case illustrates to what extent the boundaries of honor in one community could be influenced by practices or even hearsay about practices in other cities, especially if these cities were as famous and prestigious as Augsburg. In this case the Eger coopers were misinformed. In Augsburg, bathmasters’ sons were admitted to honorable guilds.</p>

<p>Augsburg’s bathmasters at home. In the same letter, Eger also requested information on the status of bastards in the cabinet-makers’ and weavers’ guilds, so that the representatives of these guilds saw the inquiry and thus this foreign challenge to the bathmasters’ honor became public knowledge. The bathmasters reacted to the Eger inquiry with indignation. They vigorously asserted their honorable status. To back up their claim to honor, the bathmasters pointed out that their city government had granted them a guild ordinance as it had to other honorable trades, and that they, like other honorable guildsmen, did not accept bastards in their guild. Thus the bathmasters’ defense strategy against such aspersions was to emphasize their status as guildsmen and the exclusiveness of their guild. But as we saw in the case of the barbers of Cologne, who were also citizens and guildsmen, and were attempting to improve the status of their guild by excluding bastards, honorable status did not necessarily follow from these characteristics. In Augsburg, however, bathmasters were recognized as honorable guildsmen and the Augsburg city government answered Eger’s inquiry to this effect.</p>
<p>This was not the last external challenge Augsburg’s bathmasters had to endure.</p>
<p>In  the bathmasters and barber-surgeons of Basel launched a desperate appeal to their Augsburg colleagues. The Basel masters were embroiled in a dishonor conflict with the tapsters’ guild, which was trying to exclude bathmasters’ sons.</p>
<p>The Basel masters asked the Augsburg guild to report on their situation and to include a certificate by the Augsburg city government which attested to the honorable status of bathmasters and barber-surgeons. Augsburg’s masters and magistrates willingly complied. Another such inquiry arrived in , when the town of Leutschau in Hungary asked whether bathmasters were accepted into honorable guilds in Augsburg. Once again Augsburg’s government attested that in Augsburg the bathmasters and barber-surgeons were honorable guildsmen. In</p>
<p> when the Augsburg tailors’ guild was involved in their dishonor conflict with the bailiff Hu¨ttling, the magistrate of Nuremberg reported that, along with bailiffs and members of several other trades, bathmasters were not admitted to honorable guilds in their city.</p>
<p>Such foreign challenges and the knowledge of the dishonor of their fellow tradesmen abroad contributed to the low status of bathmasters in Augsburg. A case of  illustrates how this cultural knowledge could be used. In the night of August  a <em>pasquill</em>, an insulting placard, was attached to the gallows at the fish market. The fish market was located in the center of town just beneath the town hall, so that the next morning, a Sunday, numerous passersby could read the <em>pasquill</em>. Partly in prose, partly in verse, the placard denounced the bathmasters: they were drunkards and medical incompetents who regularly killed off patients.</p>

<p>ters, the *pasquill * broadcast what was most likely already public knowledge or rumor: ‘‘in Saxony bathmasters are not tolerated, in Mainz the bathmasters are held in greater contempt than skinners, and in Nuremberg they are excluded from all guilds.’’ Why, the author asked, were the bathmasters still being accepted in Augsburg? Finally, the placard made the following associations: *Schinder, Bader, Henkersknecht, *</p>
<p>*seiendt einer Zunft und ein Geschlecht, *</p>
<p><em>weil dise alle insgemein</em></p>
<p>*von einem Stamm herru¨hrend sein, *</p>
<p>*nemblich von einem Schinder. *</p>
<p>Skinners, bathmasters, and executioners’ servants</p>
<p>are all of the same guild and the same lineage,</p>
<p>because they all spring from the same stem,</p>
<p>namely from a skinner.</p>
<p>Such an insulting *pasquill * was a powerful medium, made all the more effective in this case because it was attached to the gallows, the tool of the hangman, itself an infamous object with the power to pollute those who came in contact with it. By such symbolism the author reinforced the association between bathmasters and hangmen, insinuating that instead of the placard the bathmasters themselves should be hanging there. Efforts to identify the anonymous author soon met with success because the bathmasters had a pretty good idea who their adversaries were.</p>
<p>They turned out to be Hans Stapf, a master stonemason involved in a long-standing feud with the bathmasters, because he claimed they had reduced him to a cripple, and Franz Scha¨ffer, a chemist in economic competition with the bathmasters because of the medicines he mixed. It is clear this was a conflict of a different kind than those discussed so far. This was not a dishonor conflict <em>per se</em>. It did not involve a dishonorable applicant for admission to an honorable guild or an honorable person who had become contaminated by contact with a dishonorable person.</p>
<p>Rather this was a personal conflict that had nothing to do with dishonor. But the cultural knowledge of the bathmasters’ dishonor in other regions of the empire was at the authors’ disposal as they formulated their attack and they used it to good effect. To drive home their point still further, they established an association between their victims and dishonorable persons and objects, a common method of insult in early modern society. *Schinder *(‘‘skinner’’) and *Henskersknecht *(‘‘executioner’s servant’’) were frequently used insults of this period. Other common insults in this vein were *Hundschlager *(‘‘dog-killer,’’ which refers to the skinner’s</p>

<p>duties in this domain), *Racker *(another word for ‘‘skinner’’), and <em>Galgenvogel</em> (gallows bird). The libelers dipped into this reservoir of cultural stereotypes in order to construct their insult. It is interesting, however, that Stapf and Scha¨ffer did not refer to the bathmasters’ medical competition with the executioner and skinner in their <em>pasquill</em>. As we shall see in chapter , Augsburg’s licensed medical practitioners experienced executioners’ intrusion into their craft as a ‘‘great ridicule, contempt, and humiliation.’’ They even inserted an article in their ordinance to protect their medical monopoly against ‘‘the executioner, or women, or other such unqualified persons.’’ Perhaps Stapf and Scha¨ffer chose not to make an issue of this competition because the executioner’s dishonor lay dormant in his medical contacts and no dishonor conflicts seem ever to have resulted from the executioner’s medical practice. But even though the libelers did not establish any connection between the work of bathmasters and the executioner or skinner, they did attempt to express and reinforce the notion of the bathmasters’ dishonor by associating them with the person of the skinner in insult.</p>
<p>Mocking rhymes were a matter of serious concern to both bathmasters and city council. The *pasquill * constituted a massive attack on the honor of the bathmasters.</p>
<p>Just how threatened they felt becomes evident in the humorlessness of their response. The detrimental effects of the insult could only be undone in a formal recantation ceremony. Accordingly, the council ordered Stapf and Scha¨ffer to be taken to a special ceremonial room in the town hall, where they would recant in the presence of a deputation of city councilors and bathmasters, though this recantation should not make them infamous. They should then be imprisoned for fourteen days on bread and water. When the ceremony had been arranged, however, the bathmasters protested that this punishment was far too light. This was no mere misdemeanor, they argued, for the libelers had insulted their fellow bathmasters, living and dead, in Saxony, Nuremberg, and other places. Dissension and unrest among the journeymen was sure to follow. The imperial police ordinance, the bathmasters argued, prescribed that a person should receive the same punishment that his victim would receive if the libel were true. The libelers had accused them of</p>
<p>‘‘capital’’ crimes – perhaps they were referring to the accusation that the bathmasters had killed many of their patients – therefore they should be punished as</p>
<p>‘‘malefactors’’ rather than as civil offenders. It is hardly likely that the bathmasters were actually calling for the death penalty for Stapf and Scha¨ffer. This was probably a rhetorical device. They were not satisfied with the semi-private recantation, however. At the very least, they argued, Stapf and Scha¨ffer should recant in a</p>

<p>public square, just as they had insulted the bathmasters in a public place. Undoubtedly, the bathmasters would have preferred the ceremony to take place at the gallows, the site of the original insult. Then the recantation would have taken the form of an honor punishment that would have left a mark of infamy on the libelers.</p>
<p>Perhaps the bathmasters took such a hard line because at this time the label of dishonor was being applied ever more widely – just ten years earlier grave-diggers and latrine-cleaners had been challenged as dishonorable in Augsburg for the first time – so that the bathmasters perceived their own situation as increasingly precarious. Fortunately for our authors, the city council did not act on these petitions. They managed to placate the bathmasters and proceeded with the original ceremony as planned.</p>
<p>In spite of the bathmasters’ fears, honorable artisans in Augsburg did not begin to label them as dishonorable or exclude them from their guilds. Their craft did occupy a somewhat ambivalent position, however. Bathmasters formed a highly skilled trade whose members were relatively well off. Nonetheless, in Bernd Roeck’s assessment, the bathmasters formed a relatively low status trade in Augsburg, though they were never explicitly dishonorable. Roeck examined the marriage partners and guarantors of bathmasters in the late sixteenth and early seventeenth century, and came to the conclusion that bathmasters formed dispro-portionately many social networks with groups that were economically weaker than they, with weavers for example. Roeck interprets this economically ‘‘downward’’</p>
<p>orientation as a symptom of bathmasters’ low social status.</p>
<p>LINEN-WEAVERS</p>
<p>Linen-weavers were never challenged as dishonorable in Augsburg, either in a dishonor conflict or in insult, even though they were considered dishonorable in wide areas of northeastern Germany. Linen-weavers were among the first trades to be listed as dishonorable in north German guild ordinances. The shoemakers of Bremen banned linen-weavers in , the goldsmiths of Braunschweig barred them in  and the goldsmiths of Lu¨beck listed them among the tainted trades in</p>
<p>. They were labeled as dishonorable in many towns in Electoral Saxony, for instance in Dresden in , in Chemnitz in , and Pirna in . In birth certificates from Cologne linen-weavers were listed as dishonorable by the mid-fifteenth century. Like the barbers, the linen-weavers of Cologne were denied political representation on the city council. This exclusion was introduced in </p>

<p><em>The dishonorable milieu</em></p>
<p>and lasted at least until  when the decision was reconfirmed. Again, it is not clear how long into the early modern period this political discrimination was continued. In Hildesheim they were first excluded by the butchers in  and regularly appeared on lists of dishonorable trades in that city through the seventeenth century.</p>
<p>Some historians have explained the dishonor of linen-weavers by pointing to the rural origins of the craft. In his study of the dishonor of linen-weavers in Saxony, especially in the cities of Dresden, Pirna, and Chemnitz, Alfred Mating-Sammler argues that the rights of dishonorable people were curtailed in the middle ages because they were personally unfree or had been in the recent past. When towns gained independence from their lords and urban craftsmen formed guilds in the course of the late middle ages, personal freedom became the outstanding characteristic of city folk that distinguished them from the inhabitants of the surrounding villages. Urban weavers formed guilds like other crafts but were unable to establish an urban monopoly for their trade. With massive rural immigration to the towns in the fifteenth century, many rural weavers sought citizenship and admission to the weavers’ guild. The magistrates were willing to accept the rural immigrants as citizens and forced the weavers’ guild to admit them, even though the village weavers had been unfree and were therefore considered unacceptable by urban guilds. Other trades that had established an urban monopoly more effectively were less affected by rural immigration, so that the weavers’ guild alone lost prestige and honor by incorporating members who were personally unfree. Mating-Sammler’s theory also accounts for the fact that only linen-weavers and not weavers of woolen cloth were considered dishonorable, since most rural weavers were linen-weavers.</p>
<p>The institution of journeymanship caused the dishonor of linen-weavers to spread beyond those towns where an actual immigration of rural linen-weavers had taken place. Interregional networking of guilds and journeymen’s organizations caused a certain conformity to develop in the practices of artisanal guilds in the empire.</p>
<p>Mating-Sammler also suggests that the dishonor of linen-weavers might have been compounded in the early modern period by the high proportion of female labor in the craft. This explanation seems plausible in the light of recent work in women’s history which analyzes the dynamic between social status and the sexual division of labor with a craft. Jean Quataert emphasizes distance from household production as an important criterion of craft honor. Studying linen-weavers of the Bohemian Saxon province of Oberlausitz, she shows that linen-weaving, in contrast to the more highly specialized wool weaving, remained tied to household production and women’s work which, she argues, contributed to the linen-weavers’</p>

<p>dishonor. This would fit into a trend which Merry Wiesner and others have documented: the sexual division of labor in artisanal workshops seems to have become more rigid in general in the early modern period.</p>
<p>What reason, if any, did early modern artisans give for the dishonor of linen-weavers? This is a difficult question. Guild ordinances and birth certificates are not the kind of sources in which such explanations would appear. If sexual division of labor did indeed contribute to the stigmatization of linen-weavers, this does not become explicit in the records. We saw above that when Augsburg artisans labeled shepherds, bailiffs, latrine-cleaners, or grave-diggers as dishonorable, they explained the dishonor of these groups by some connection or similarity with the work of the executioner or skinner. But it is hard to imagine how even the most inventive artisanal mind could establish any connection between the work of executioners and skinners and the work of linen-weavers. And yet artisans did associate these linen-weavers with executioners, though the connection was not based on similarities in their work.</p>
<p>Linen-weavers and millers were allegedly subjected to a peculiar degradation ritual in which they were publicly associated with the executioner. When a gallows was built or renovated or when a hanging was to take place, the linen-weavers or millers were required to provide the ladder. Both the primary and secondary sources on this practice are vague. The primary sources rarely mention specifics of time or place. A Prussian edict of , for example, stated that the ‘‘master linen-weavers have complained to us that of late they have been insulted by various persons, both publicly and privately, who claim that they are obliged to carry the ladder to the gallows when a person is to be hanged, and that they like doing this . . .’’ The edict declared once again that linen-weavers were honorable and threatened anyone who insulted them with a fine of  reichs-taler. Even if linen-weavers were required to perform such a task in some ‘‘foreign lands,’’ this was not to be held against them, since it was not the practice in Prussia. The linen-weavers had to endure this insult outside Prussia as well. In  a vagrant was imprisoned in the small town of Teterow in Mecklenburg for claiming that in Nuremberg the linen-weavers had to help build the gallows. After a public</p>

<p>recantation ceremony the vagrant was banished. In  the linen-weavers of Zerbst in the principality of Anhalt sued a master horse-smith for saying that there were still ‘‘places where the linen-weavers have to carry the ladder to the gallows.’’ Such cases give the impression that rumors about this ritual were far more widespread than the practice. Only further local studies can answer when and where such rituals actually took place.</p>
<p>Given the lack of such studies the following thoughts must remain speculative. If and when such degradation rituals were performed, they were a symbolic expression of the low status of linen-weavers, who had, for whatever reasons, *already * been labeled as dishonorable. When such rituals were enacted and the rumors about them spread, the *idiom * in which their dishonor was *expressed * itself became the <em>cause</em> for further discrimination. This was a circular, self-confirming process. Even if most tales about this degradation ritual were fictitious, they reinforced notions of the linen-weavers’ dishonor, to the extent that the original reasons for their dishonor were forgotten. Artisans described linen-weavers as dishonorable <em>because</em> they were required to deliver the ladder.</p>
<p>If such rumors were spread in Augsburg, they left no trace in the records.</p>
<p>Though linen-weavers appear to have been dishonorable in more areas than bathmasters and barber-surgeons, this never became an issue in Augsburg. But then, the bathmasters’ and barbers’ guilds together never numbered more than forty, while the weavers’ guild incorporated , masters around . Given such numbers, it would have been wholly impractical, socially disruptive and politically very dangerous to impugn the honor of the linen-weavers. The journeyman weavers took to the streets in  when the skinner’s son attempted to join their guild, and the council, ‘‘in great earnestness,’’ immediately took steps to placate them and barred the skinner’s son. The reaction of the linen-weavers might have been even more extreme if they themselves had been attacked, either in a dishonor conflict or in rumor and insult. Furthermore, an attack on the honor of the linen-weavers would have constituted an attack on the city itself. Augsburg was a ‘‘weavers’ city,’’ whose economy, society, and culture were in many ways shaped by its largest guild.</p>
<p>CONCLUSION</p>
<p>This chapter has surveyed the various groups on the periphery of dishonor in Augsburg and compared them with dishonorable groups in other areas of the empire. Shepherds were considered extremely dishonorable in Augsburg. They felt the stigma of dishonor in its full force as early as . Dishonor conflicts involving shepherds rarely occurred in Augsburg, however, probably because</p>

<p></p>
<p><em>On the periphery of dishonor</em></p>
<p>Augsburg did not have a rural hinterland so that few shepherds lived in the city. It is impossible to make any generalizations on the basis of two cases, but when one compares the dishonor conflict of  with that of  the status of shepherds seems unchanged. In contrast, the status of bailiffs declined steadily in the course of the seventeenth century. Bailiffs formed the group that was most often involved in dishonor conflicts in Augsburg. While the goldsmiths’ guild was the first to exclude them in , virtually all guilds followed suit by the late seventeenth century.</p>
<p>Grave-diggers and latrine-cleaners were not challenged as dishonorable in Augsburg before the late seventeenth century. So it appears that the label of dishonor was applied more widely in the late seventeenth century than around . As dishonor conflicts became more intense, Augsburg’s authoritarian regime came to realize that government had only limited power to force guilds to admit candidates they considered unacceptable. Under these circumstances it is understandable that barbers and bathmasters felt especially vulnerable to any challenges to their status, whether they were inquiries from abroad or insults at home. Although they were never explicitly dishonorable in Augsburg, they occupied a precarious position.</p>
<p>The status of these groups on the periphery of dishonor was much more indeterminate than that of the dishonorable core group. Executioners and skinners were clearly defined as dishonorable people, though there was little consensus on what this meant in practice. Before the eighteenth century no one – not the authorities, not the general public, not even executioners and skinners themselves –</p>
<p>ever seriously questioned that they were indeed dishonorable. In the seventeenth century executioners and skinners occupied a stable social niche relatively insulated from honorable society and apparently they rarely tried to leave this position, so that dishonor conflicts involving the dishonorable core did not occur very often.</p>
<p>We saw that in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries the sons and daughters of executioners and skinners almost never sought to join or marry into an honorable guild. In contrast, other groups challenged as dishonorable – shepherds, bailiffs, grave-diggers, latrine-cleaners, bathmasters, and barbers – fiercely denied that they were dishonorable. They went to extremes to demonstrate their honorable status and sought and for the most part received the support of the authorities in doing so.</p>
<p>These were the trades that legislation on the imperial and local level sought to rehabilitate. They were not separate from, indeed they were part of, the artisanal milieu. Since they were in closer contact with honorable artisans, conflicts occurred more frequently. Dishonor conflicts erupted when the children of potentially dishonorable persons tried to enter honorable guilds.</p>
<p>Different dishonorable groups had very different social profiles. Executioners, skinners, and their servants were denied citizenship. Bailiffs, grave-diggers, latrine-cleaners, bathmasters and barbers were all citizens. The dishonorable core group was categorically excluded from guilds. Concerning the trades on the periphery of dishonor, this question was not so clear. Bathmasters and barbers were, of course, guildsmen themselves. Even in cities where they were explicitily</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>The dishonorable milieu</em></p>
<p>dishonorable, as in Cologne, they formed guilds and practiced a measure of social exclusiveness. Linen-weavers were considered dishonorable in wide areas of northern and northeastern Germany, and yet they formed guilds in all these areas. In Augsburg, individual bailiffs, grave-diggers, and latrine-cleaners were also guildsmen. As we saw, they were often recruited from the artisanate. If their fellow masters did not exclude them after they accepted these positions, they retained their status as guildsmen. Different guilds developed different standards of honor at different times, so that a potentially dishonorable individual might be tolerated in one guild and rejected in another. Such a person could occupy very different positions, depending on whether he lived in the city or the country.</p>
<p>The dishonor of shepherds raises the question to what extent artisanal notions of dishonor infiltrated the countryside. The shepherd Tregelin and the peasant Eisenbarth were, as we saw, well respected by their rural neighbors. They were only confronted with their potential dishonor when they sent their sons to town.</p>
<p>Even within the city different dishonorable groups were polluting to different degrees. Executioners and skinners were the most polluting, closely followed by shepherds. Casual contact or sociability with these groups could sometimes lead to a dishonor conflict. In contrast, no dishonor conflict seems to have ever resulted from sociability with a bailiff, grave-digger, or night-worker.</p>
<p>The economic status of different dishonorable groups varied widely. Executioners were often quite wealthy. Skinners were less wealthy, but do not appear to have been poor. The shepherd Tregelin and the peasant Eisenbarth were described as wealthy, though we cannot make any generalizations on the economic status of shepherds based on these two individuals. Bailiffs did not do badly in comparison with their fellow citizens. In  they were better off than  percent of the citizenry. Grave-diggers, it is probably safe to assume, were poor, though little hard evidence is available. One city administrator wrote of the ‘‘low wages of a grave-digger.’’ No information is available on the economic status of the night-king. It is hardly likely that the team of immigrant laborers whom he employed as ‘‘night-workers’’ received very high wages. Bathmasters and barbers were relatively well off, compared to most of their fellow citizens.</p>
<p>In considering the relationship between honor and wealth, it is certainly not possible to set up any simple equations. Wealth did not necessarily equal honor, nor poverty dishonor. The relationship was more complex. Poverty could certainly precipitate a social decline into dishonor, as when an impoverished artisan was compelled to take a position as bailiff, or – and this was a different kind of dishonor</p>
<p>– when a poor craftsman turned to begging or stealing and was subjected to a dishonor punishment at the hands of the beadle or executioner. Conversely, dishonor could cause poverty, as when the weaver Johann Georg Vogel, who had married a bailiff’s daughter, was driven into bankruptcy during his three-year-long dishonor conflict with his guild, or when the bailiff Hu¨ttling, burdened with many children, tried unsuccessfully to apprentice them to trades. Paradoxically, the social</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>On the periphery of dishonor</em></p>
<p>consequences of dishonor hit such individuals much harder than executioner, and skinner, at the symbolic center of dishonor. While executioners and skinners could and did use their dishonor to protect their economic monopolies, for the trades on the periphery dishonor could mean economic exclusion, loss of livelihood, and financial ruin. Wealth in turn did not guarantee a way out of dishonor, as the cases of the shepherd Tregelin, the peasant Eisenbarth, and the bailiff Frank illustrate.</p>
<p>Artisans explained the dishonor of shepherds, bailiffs, grave-diggers, and night-workers by pointing to analogies or connections between their work and that of executioners and skinners. This connection was easy to establish between skinners and shepherds, some of whom actually did skin the diseased animals in their herds. The labeling of grave-diggers and latrine-cleaners as dishonorable in the late seventeenth century was not the result of changing sensibilities towards stench and filth. As we saw, the striking journeymen did not mention any feelings of repugnance or revulsion regarding the work of grave-diggers and night-workers as such. The journeymen did not object to the burial of corpses in general, only to the burial of executed delinquents. The removal of feces was not dishonoring, but using the executioner’s horses was. According to the journeymen, such incidental connections with the executioner explained the dishonor of these groups. In the case of bathmasters in Augsburg and linen-weavers in northeastern Germany, these groups were associated with the executioner in insults.</p>
<p>The dishonor of bailiffs derived from that of the executioner, even though the authorities went to great lengths to insulate the mayors’ bailiffs from the execution process. But in the minds of honorable artisans, the fact that they were involved in the administration of criminal justice at all was reason enough to consider them dishonorable.</p>
<p>We conclude by asking again how many dishonorable people lived in Augsburg at any one time. Augsburg employed six mayors’ bailiffs. They all had families. In</p>
<p> bailiff Hans Bausch had eight children; his wife was pregnant with the ninth.</p>
<p>Bailiff Tobias Frank had at least four sons; if he had any daughters they left no trace in the records. We have no way of knowing whether the Bausch or Frank family were representative. Bernd Roeck estimates the average size of middle-income households at just over four persons. So by multiplying the number of bailiffs by four, we arrive at a number of twenty-four persons who might potentially be involved in dishonor conflicts. In  Augsburg employed five master grave-diggers. Since grave-diggers were of lower economic status than bailiffs, we will multiply this number by three, the average household size for low-income families, to arrive at a number of fifteen persons somehow associated with grave-digging.</p>
<p>Then there was the night-king and his family, which we might estimate at four</p>

<p>individuals. The night-king employed fourteen laborers on a regular basis. We have no information on how many shepherds lived in Augsburg. To these trades on the periphery of dishonor we must add the dishonorable core group, executioners and skinners, and their dependents. We estimated their number at anywhere between forty and sixty people. Taking all these groups together, it is probably safe to assume that there were just over one hundred dishonorable or potentially dishonorable people in Augsburg at any time during the early modern period, though there might well have been quite a few less. It is clear that dishonorable people occupied a place in the social imagination of honorable guildsmen that was out of all proportion with their numbers.</p>
