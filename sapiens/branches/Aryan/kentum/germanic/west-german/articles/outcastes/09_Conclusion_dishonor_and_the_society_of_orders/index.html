  <meta property="og:description" content="Executioners and skinners and their families, the core group of dishonorable people, occupied a symbolic position as outsiders in early modern German society.
Jurists classified them as infamous and listed a multitude of legal, social, and religious disabilities that derived from their dishonor: the executioner or skinner lived ‘‘like a wild animal, . . . excluded from the community of honorable people.’’
These legal scholars vastly exaggerated the discrimination executioners and skinners suffered in social practice, however. Executioners and skinners were not absolute pariahs. In Augsburg the city government did deny executioners and skinners citizenship, but the patrician magistrates did not discriminate against them in any other way. Honorable guildsmen, the lowest honorable estate in the corporate hierarchy within the city, were the social group that most adamantly enforced the social exclusion of dishonorable people. From the early sixteenth century on, no honorable guild incorporated a member of the dishonorable core group. Artisans were also most concerned about the danger of ritual pollution by social or physical contact with the executioner or skinner.">

  <p>Executioners and skinners and their families, the core group of dishonorable people, occupied a symbolic position as outsiders in early modern German society.</p>
<p>Jurists classified them as infamous and listed a multitude of legal, social, and religious disabilities that derived from their dishonor: the executioner or skinner lived ‘‘like a wild animal, . . . excluded from the community of honorable people.’’</p>
<p>These legal scholars vastly exaggerated the discrimination executioners and skinners suffered in social practice, however. Executioners and skinners were not absolute pariahs. In Augsburg the city government did deny executioners and skinners citizenship, but the patrician magistrates did not discriminate against them in any other way. Honorable guildsmen, the lowest honorable estate in the corporate hierarchy within the city, were the social group that most adamantly enforced the social exclusion of dishonorable people. From the early sixteenth century on, no honorable guild incorporated a member of the dishonorable core group. Artisans were also most concerned about the danger of ritual pollution by social or physical contact with the executioner or skinner.</p>
<p>The exclusion from honorable guilds most likely had little practical impact on executioners and skinners in the later sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, since they had little reason to want to join an artisan guild. Executioners and skinners were strongly stigmatized, but a social abyss separated them from criminals and the disreputable vagrant poor who were executed or made infamous at their hands. The early modern state persecuted other marginal groups – witches, vagrants, bandits, gypsies – sometimes to the point of extermination. But executioners and skinners enjoyed various privileges that compensated them for the social discrimination they faced, and made their social position tolerable, indeed advantageous. Executioners and skinners were of higher economic status than most guildsmen who discriminated against them. They had a reputation as skilled healers and they probably drew much of their income from their medical practice. In some cases medicine provided them with an avenue of upward social mobility. They were excluded from citizenship, but as a *result * of this exclusion they were exempt from a variety of taxes</p>
<p> Tommaso Garzoni, ‘‘Discurs. ’’ in <em>Piazza Universali</em>, quoted in Paul Do¨pler, <em>Theatrum Poenarum,</em> *Supplicorum, et Executionum Criminalium, der Schauplatz der Leib und Lebensstrafen *(Sonderhausen,</p>
<p>), p. .</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>Artisanal honor and urban politics</em> that citizens were required to pay. After the mid-sixteenth century they practiced social endogamy and formed a professional caste. This social endogamy is usually explained as a result of social discrimination. External coercion undoubtedly did contribute to the formation of this professional caste. The conflict concerning the marriage of the fisherman Andreas Anhauser and the skinner’s daughter Barbara Leichnam is an illustration of the social disaster that befell artisans who married across the boundary of honor. But executioners’ and skinners’ clans also *chose * to practice social endogamy in order to transfer executioners’ and skinners’ positions, to preserve family patrimonies, and to provide professional training for the young.</p>
<p>In the later sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, executioners and skinners occupied a privileged niche in the urban social structure. The social boundary that separated the dishonorable core group from honorable society seems to have been maintained with the tacit consent of the executioners and skinners. Paradoxically, groups on the periphery of dishonor, though they were less polluting than executioners and skinners, suffered more from the effects of dishonor pollution in daily life. Since their dishonorable status was less clearly established than that of executioners and skinners, they attempted to join artisan guilds and were conse-quently embroiled in dishonor conflicts more frequently.</p>
<p>Dishonor was a form of secular pollution. Sin was the defining characteristic of illicit trades in the middle ages; they were defined as spiritually defiled in canon law. In contrast, Catholic and Protestant churches in the early modern period did not discriminate against executioners, skinners, or other defiled tradesmen. The sons of bailiffs, excluded from artisan guilds, readily found employment as sextons and priests. Late medieval executioners sometimes were denied access to Holy Communion, but in the early modern period this type of discrimination ended. In Augsburg they attended church and suffered no lack of pastoral care. No one questioned the spiritual equality of executioners or other defiled tradesmen, but that did not mitigate the social and political discrimination they suffered in the material world.</p>
<p>Ritual pollution is usually studied in the context of primitive religion, so it might seem counterintuitive to say that German dishonor was secular. However, the secularization of dishonor in the early modern period was part of a larger social development. R. Po-Chia Hsia has argued that ‘‘the desacralization of society’’ constituted ‘‘the most fundamental transformation in early modern central Europe.’’ This is not to say that early modern people developed a</p>
<p>‘‘disenchanted’’ worldview. But the formation of confessional identity in the second half of the sixteenth century undermined the ideology of sacral communalism that was the dominant ‘‘theologico-political discourse’’ of the early Reformation. Members of different confessions, Catholics, Lutherans, and Calvinists, were forced to cohabit the same urban space. ‘‘By creating different competing confessional groups and a fragmented Christian society,’’ Hsia suggests,</p>
<p>‘‘the process of confessionalization destroyed sacralization as a force of social</p>

<p><em>Conclusion</em></p>
<p>integration.’’ In multi-confessional cities and the confessionally splintered empire of the early modern period it was necessary to define honor and the boundaries of the political community in secular terms. Where religious homogeneity could no longer be the basis of community, honor defined in secular terms could serve as a new integrating principle.</p>
<p>The boundary of honor was not clearly drawn; at times it was almost invisible.</p>
<p>Artisans were absolutely intransigent and uncompromising once a dishonor conflict had erupted, but they could also be pragmatic and flexible in their dealings with executioners, skinners, and other defiled tradesmen in daily life. Artisans had business dealings with the skinner, and they went to the executioner for medical treatment with no adverse effect on their honor. Sociability with executioners and skinners caused severe dishonor conflicts in some cases, but was harmless and unobjectionable in others. Andreas Anhauser’s fellow fishermen did not hesitate to frequent the skinner’s house ‘‘like a tavern.’’ Pollution rules were not explicit or clearly defined. Dishonor was contextual. The fact that pollution beliefs could be suspended under certain circumstances should not be interpreted as a sign that artisans were opportunistic or cynical about dishonor. For a society to continue to function, pollution rules must be put into practice in such a way that social life does not grind to a halt.</p>
<p>Artisans never allowed the boundary of honor to disappear completely, however.</p>
<p>The fishermen did not object to drinking with the skinner, but they drew the line at marrying the skinner’s daughter. The guildsmen used dishonor conflicts periodically to reaffirm their pollution rules and the symbolic outsider status of executioners and skinners. Similarly, the city government never allowed the outsider status of executioners and skinners to be forgotten. The magistrates at times acted to soften the discrimination executioners and skinners faced from artisans – they guaranteed the executioner’s right to frequent public baths, for example – but they never allowed a working executioner or skinner to acquire citizenship. This exclusion from citizenship had no adverse effect on executioners and skinners in daily life, indeed it was to their economic advantage, but it was a symbolic expression of their marginal status within the city. In the later sixteenth and seventeenth centuries legal dishonor had little practical impact on executioners and skinners, but their marginal status did hold great symbolic significance.</p>
<p>The existence of dishonorable people stabilized the corporate hierarchy within the city. First, there was the issue of money. A person’s social and economic status was generally more or less congruent in the society of orders. A goldsmith typically had more honor and more wealth than a weaver. But there were significant exceptions to this rule. Among elites, patricians were less wealthy than merchants who were their social inferiors. And at lower social levels, the glaring status inconsistency of the executioner, dishonorable and yet wealthy, confirmed a</p>

<p></p>
<p><em>Artisanal honor and urban politics</em> legitimizing myth of the society of orders that honor, not money, determined status. And secondly, dishonor played a significant role in the self-presentation of corporate groups. Guilds were engaged in constant competition for precedence and honor. Attempting to improve their position in the corporate hierarchy, guilds demonstrated their honor and their sensitivity to pollution in dishonor conflicts.</p>
<p>The course of dishonor conflicts was similar, whether they were sparked by ritual pollution through contact with an executioner or skinner, or by the attempt of a potentially dishonorable person to enter an artisan guild. Dishonor pollution precipitated acrimonious clashes between fellow citizens and between guildsmen and their patrician rulers in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, but these conflicts had a limited focus and ultimately had the effect of preserving the social hierarchy. Artisans were exclusively concerned with their honor and their corporate privileges. The guildsmen did not challenge the social and political hierarchy itself, they were only concerned with their position in the established hierarchy.</p>
<p>The social ascendancy of the patricians and their right to rule were never questioned. The criteria according to which honor was claimed or denied in such conflicts worked in favor of the patricians. When the goldsmiths were involved in a dishonor conflict with bailiff Frank in  and , for example, the goldsmiths argued that their trade was particularly honorable because they worked with a noble substance and their craft was artful. Their honor was demonstrated by patricians’</p>
<p>willingness to associate with them. The goldsmiths emphasized this point by providing a list of all patricians who had learned their trade since . Bailiff Frank also used the argument of association with patricians to prove that he was not dishonorable. Bailiffs were in close daily contact with patrician mayors, and persons of such high honor would not surround themselves with infamous persons. The logic of such arguments remained very much the same over the next two centuries.</p>
<p>When the bookbinders expelled the beadle’s son Antoni Halmberger in , they supported their claim to honor by arguing that bookbinders were closely associated with academics and universities. Academics and university graduates had a high social status, second only to that of patricians. The clothing ordinance of </p>
<p>classed academics together with merchants incorporated in the exclusive merchants’ society, with non-patrician members of the city council, and with highly placed city officials. Just as the emperor or sovereign was the fount of honor, so persons of high estate were a source of honor for those beneath them in the corporate hierarchy. Artisans and governmental officials acted upon this ideology of honor in gallows-building rituals. This underlying logic of the ritual is perhaps one reason why authorities agreed to participate in these elaborate and costly ceremonies. Of course, there was a practical reason: if the authorities wanted the gallows to be built, they would have to humor the artisans. But on a symbolic level, the idea of the cleansing power of persons of high honor would certainly appeal to</p>

<p>the authorities, and could be instrumentalized to cement governmental authority.</p>
<p>Dishonor was often associated with filthy and stinking work. This raises the question to what extent a ‘‘civilizing process’’ as it has been described by Norbert Elias contributed to the stigmatization of defiled trades. But the model of the civlizing process cannot explain attributions of dishonor. According to Elias, the process of civilization began among social elites and only gradually affected lower social classes. However, it was the artisans who were most concerned with dishonor pollution, while elites were more or less indifferent. For artisans, dishonor was a matter of social symbolism rather than sensibility. Working with dirty and base materials alone did not suffice to make a person dishonorable. In artisans’</p>
<p>analogical thinking, the dishonor of all defiled trades ultimately derived from association with the executioner or skinner. While the ‘‘night-workers’’ and grave-diggers who worked with feces and corpses were of low status compared with the goldsmiths who worked with a noble substance, such low status did not equal dishonor. As striking journeyman linen-weavers explained in , night-workers and grave-diggers only became dishonorable by association with the executioner.</p>
<p>The night-workers used the executioner’s horses to transport feces, and grave-diggers became dishonorable when they buried an executed criminal, thus becoming involved in the execution process. Beyond explaining the infamy of different dishonorable groups by association with the executioner – in northern Germany linen-weavers were dishonorable because they allegedly supplied the ladder for the gallows – artisans offered no explanation of dishonor. Once they had traced dishonor back to the executioner, the rationale of dishonor was not articulated beyond this point. An early modern artisan most likely would have been perplexed by the question *why * the executioner was dishonorable. The executioner simply <em>was</em> dishonorable. To speak with Pierre Bourdieu, ‘‘in practice’’ German dishonor prohibitions were ‘‘lived rather than clearly conceived.’’ The half-articulated criteria that determined *who * was dishonorable were secondary to the fact that such a dishonorable caste existed which the artisans could use to support their own claim to honor.</p>
<p>Artisans saw their honor and the honor of their patrician governors as interconnected. Augsburg’s goldsmiths made this argument explicitly in their conflict with bailiff Frank in  and . When they excluded a dishonorable candidate from their guild, the goldsmiths argued, they were following the same social logic as patricians did when they excluded common citizens from their exclusive drinking society. If it was ‘‘absurd’’ for patricians to incorporate commoners in their society, then it was equally absurd for the goldsmiths to incorporate a bailiff’s son. In </p>
<p>and  the magistrates brushed off the goldsmiths’ argument. But perhaps they found such reasoning more compelling in the eighteenth century, when their own</p>

<p></p>
<p><em>Artisanal honor and urban politics</em> social position seemed more precarious. From  to  Augsburg’s patrician government was under investigation by an imperial commission for nepotism and corruption. The government’s financial mismanagement precipitated a second constitutional crisis in the s. The legitimacy of patrician rule *per se * was not challenged in either of these crises. However, Augsburg’s magistrates could not have been unaware that public debt and governmental corruption set off numerous urban revolts and constitutional crises in other free imperial cities in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries in which commoners demanded increased participation in government. Augsburg’s patricians also could not have been unaware of enlightened criticism of the corporate privileges of the aristocracy, criticism that was applied to urban patriciates as well. The argument of Christian Thomasius and other natural law theorists that true honor was revealed in moral conduct tended to undermine not only the legal discrimination against dishonorable people, but also the corporate honor and privileges of the aristocracy. Perhaps such developments encouraged Augsburg’s magistrates to try to preserve the traditional corporate hierarchy within the city.</p>
<p>In her discussion of the relationship between ritual pollution and social structure, Mary Douglas suggests that ‘‘wherever the lines are precarious, we find pollution ideas come to their support.’’ This observation holds true for the history of dishonor in the eighteenth century. The legal status of executioners and skinners improved, but dishonor had greater impact in their daily lives. As their economic status declined and they lost the perquisites of their traditional position, they tried to rise above the dishonorable milieu by entering the artisanate. At the same time, artisans applied the label of dishonor more widely. Additional trades were stigmatized and the label of dishonor extended over more generations. As guildsmen’s pollution anxieties became more extreme, Augburg’s patrician government developed a new policy of appeasement towards their artisanal subjects. The magistrates became more tolerant of the social exclusiveness of the guildsmen and shrank away from taking on the artisans in dishonor conflicts. And for the first time the city</p>

<p><em>Conclusion</em></p>
<p>government actively enforced the social exclusion of dishonorable people, as is illustrated in the government’s extreme reaction to the marriage of the miller Joseph Klugheimer and the skinner’s daughter Josepha Trenkler in , and in the magistrates’ protests against the imperial police ordinance of  which admitted skinners’ sons to artisan guilds.</p>
<p>This change in governmental policy towards artisan guilds and dishonorable people was in part the result of a learning process. When the locksmiths of Ulm expelled a fellow master for slaughtering three sickly piglets in , one of the guildsmen said ‘‘even if the emperor himself ordered them [to accept the offending master], there is no way they would obey him.’’ Such ‘‘insolence’’ was typical of guildsmen’s behavior in dishonor conflicts. Artisans instrumentalized honor to maintain autonomous spheres of corporate jurisdiction against the encroaching demands of the state. The expansion of dishonor pollution hampered governments’</p>
<p>social disciplining agenda and the administration of criminal justice throughout the empire, and several times during the late seventeenth and the eighteenth centuries, Augsburg’s magistrates had to concede that artisans simply could not be coerced into accepting a dishonorable candidate. Super-regional journeymen’s associations enforced the artisanal honor code and the social exclusion of dishonorable people.</p>
<p>The politically fragmented structure of the empire gave journeymen greater leverage than they would have had in a unified nation state. Even in the seventeenth century, when the Augsburg city government aggressively sought to rehabilitate the groups on the periphery of dishonor and to break the artisans’ resistance, the magistrates could not control the journeymen. The magistrates’ authority did not extend beyond the city government; disobedient journeymen could easily escape Augsburg’s jurisdiction by walking a few miles. All attempts at coordination between the governments of different cities and territories failed. Jacob Gottlieb Sieber, legal counsel to the government of the free imperial city of Goslar, described the difficulties free imperial cities faced in controlling their artisans in a treatise published in . Free imperial cities ‘‘indulged’’ their artisans, he argued, because they simply did not have the power to compel artisans to obey.</p>
<p>Even in territorial states ‘‘where the necessary force is not lacking, there are great obstacles.’’ But insufficient state power was not the only reason the rehabilitation of dishonorable trades remained ineffective. Collusion was also a factor. In free imperial cities where guildsmen had a voice in government, the ‘‘authorities are not so strict and look the other way ( <em>durch die Finger sehen</em>),’’ so that guildsmen did not vote for lowly candidates, since the ‘‘quality’’ of councilmen determined the respect the city government would receive by neighboring territories. Augsburg was a patrician regime, so the prospect of guildsmen voting undesirable candidates into</p>

<p><em>Artisanal honor and urban politics</em> office was not an issue. But in Augsburg, too, the authorities ‘‘looked the other way.’’ This new tolerance of guilds’ exclusiveness gives the impression that in the course of the eighteenth century Augsburg’s patrician magistrates came to perceive their own honor and the honor of the artisans as interconnected. When the city government acted to preserve the social boundary that excluded dishonorable people from the artisanate, the patricians seemed to be acting on the assumption that by protecting the corporate privileges of the artisans they were protecting their own.</p>
<p>After the collapse of the Holy Roman empire during the Napoleonic invasions, the system of discrimination against dishonorable people slowly dissolved. When the political framework of the empire collapsed and many cities and principalities were incorporated into the larger territorial states, journeymen lost the leverage their super-regional network had provided under the old regime. Between  and</p>
<p> many governments abolished the journeymen’s organizations under their jurisdiction and the super-regional journeymen’s organizations dissolved. Augsburg was incorporated into the large and centralized territorial state of Bavaria in</p>
<p>. Augsburg’s patricians, the traditional ruling caste, became subjects of the Bavarian king.</p>
<p>Executioners and skinners continued to face discrimination in the early nineteenth century. A veterinarian writing on the disposal of carrion observed in </p>
<p>that guilds still refused to apprentice skinners’ sons. In  Karl Huss, executioner in Eger, complained that executioners were still ‘‘excluded from convivial society.’’ In  King Friedrich Wilhelm of Prussia issued a cabinet order that allowed executioners’ servants to perform military service. When a group of city councilmen in Berlin tried to prevent an executioner’s servant from buying property within the city in , the king condemned the traditional exclusion of executioners’ servant as a prejudice, and granted them full civil rights. By this time, the king claimed, the defiled status of other traditionally dishonorable tradesmen had been forgotten. In the modern world of centralized territorial states the artisanal honor code and the social exclusion of dishonorable people could not be maintained. When the structural conditions for the enforcement of honor rules were dismantled, pollution anxieties faded and the system of discrimination against dishonorable people came to a gradual end in the first half of the nineteenth century.</p>
