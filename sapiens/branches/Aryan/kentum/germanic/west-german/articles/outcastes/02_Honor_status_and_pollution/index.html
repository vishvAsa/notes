  <p>Augsburg was one of the empire’s major cities with a population of around ,</p>
<p>in . Augsburg’s status as a free imperial city had been firmly established since the early fourteenth century. As a sovereign state within the empire, Augsburg had developed an elaborate network of government bureaucracies that regulated life in the city. A brief consideration of Augsburg’s constitutional and social structure will help place *Unehrlichkeit * in context. Augsburg’s <em>Stadtrecht</em>, the civic code of ,</p>
<p>mandated that the city council should include only the ‘‘best and wisest,’’ in other words councilors were to be of patrician estate. An exclusive caste of old families which had grown wealthy in long-distance trade, the patricians formed an urban nobility that jealously guarded its social and political privileges against rising artisanal classes and merchants who had grown rich more recently. The strict code of conduct that Augsburg patricians developed for themselves did not forbid them to engage in long-distance trade, as was the case in some other cities. But by the late middle ages they were for the most part living off income from country estates and were surpassed in economic vigor by new merchants. From the beginning, the patrician city council tried to block attempts by non-patricians to gain political representation by forbidding artisans to form sworn corporations. The civic code explicitly forbade the bakers to form guilds.</p>
<p>Merchants and wealthy artisans gained political power commensurate with their new economic standing in the guild revolt of . Armed artisans stormed the town hall, demanding that the patrician councilors hand over the civic code and the</p>

<p>keys to the city gates, the symbols of sovereignty and independence of the city. The patricians offered no resistance, so the change of regime was unbloody. Non-patrician merchants and artisans developed a ‘‘guild constitution’’ which determined the structure of the new government. Guilds were now seen as the basic model of social organization that ideally was to incorporate all citizens. The artisanal crafts formed seventeen political guilds which were each entitled to a representative on the ‘‘small council,’’ the highest authority in the city. Ten of these, the largest and most honorable guilds, each sent two members to the council.</p>
<p>These were the guilds of the merchants, weavers, retailers, salt-traders, bakers, butchers, shoemakers, tailors, brewers, and leather-workers. The economic elites of these politically privileged guilds were more involved in the trading than in the production of their commodity. Several smaller trades were unified into one political guild. The guilds were at once political corporations and economic associations that regulated the production and distribution of a commodity.</p>
<p>The guild revolt did not, however, lead to a total exclusion of the patricians from political power. To the contrary, even under the guild constitution patricians were still over-represented in government. The twenty-nine representatives of the artisanal guilds selected fifteen patricians to sit with them on the small council. The guildsmen then selected one of their own and one patrician to serve as <em>Bu¨rgermeister</em> and filled all other important posts in this manner as well, effectively establishing a parity in government between patricians and guildsmen. Although the merchants and artisans who mounted the guild revolt in  certainly held all the power in their hands at that moment, they did not wish to suppress patrician influence entirely. They seem to have shared the belief that the patricians were indeed the</p>
<p>‘‘best and wisest’’ and were entitled to a predominant role in government. In spite of their political defeat, the patricians still enjoyed the highest honor. At the peak of the social hierarchy, it was they who determined the criteria of honor in the competition of the various corporate groups for prestige and precedence within the commune.</p>
<p>In  the patricians founded a socially exclusive private society, the <em>Herren und</em> *Bu¨rgerstube *(Lords’ and Citizens’ Hall), in part in order to compensate for their partial loss of political power. By founding this society, the patricians intended to determine once and for all which families belonged to the patriciate.

<p>dances and tournaments of this exclusive society. However, the Augsburg patricians did not become an entirely closed caste. They continued to intermarry with the non-patrician mercantile elite. By the early sixteenth century they founded a second private society, the *Mehrer der Gesellschaft *(Improvers of Society), which incorporated those members of Augsburg’s economic elite who had married into patrician families. *Mehrer * were allowed to join in the patrician sociability of the <em>Herrenstube</em>, they were *socii patriciorum *(companions of the patricians). The purpose of this society was to let the relatives of patricians partake of the social prestige of the patrician estate without fully accepting them into the patriciate. At this point, this society only conferred social prestige, and the *Mehrer * did not yet play any institutional role in government.</p>
<p>In these years Augsburg entered on its golden age, so to speak. In the late fifteenth and early sixteenth centuries the city reached the peak of its economic and political power in the empire. The city’s favorable geographic location along the trade routes from Italy to northern Europe made it possible for Augsburg to surpass Nuremberg as the economic and financial capital in south Germany by the s.</p>
<p>In this age of economic expansion Augsburg’s merchants, above all the famous Fugger and Welser families, accumulated vast fortunes. The Welser were an old patrician family, but the Fugger represent one of the most spectacular examples of social mobility of the age. Descended from a rural weaver who immigrated to the city in , the Fugger family diversified from weaving to organizing a putting-out system for textile production, to international trade of almost any commodity, to banking and mining. By  the Fugger were the bankers of the Habsburg and had financed the election of Emperor Charles V.</p>
<p>The patricians tried to tap into the new fortunes of the non-patrician mercantile elite through sociability and intermarriage. But in spite of such connections with Augsburg’s economic elite, the social exclusiveness of the patriciate caused it to shrink down to eight families in , too few to fill the governmental offices they were entitled to according to the guild constitution. In  thirty-eight of the leading merchant families were accepted into the patriciate, a measure which brought the prestige and economic hierarchies at the top end of the social scale back into balance. It was at this date that the Fuggers joined the patriciate. Those merchant families that were not elevated into the patriciate at this point then formed their own private society, the *Kaufleutestube *(Society of Merchants) and</p>

<p>The reception of the Reformation in Augsburg followed class lines. The overwhelming majority of the artisans sympathized with the evangelical movement by the mid-s. The expulsion of a popular preacher in  sparked a riot, and Augsburg experienced iconoclastic unrest. Fearing for Augsburg’s trade relations and political connections with the Habsburgs, the majority of patricians, most notably the Fuggers, remained loyal to the Catholic church. Finally, the government bowed to popular pressure and introduced the Reformation in a series of steps between  and . Seven years later, in , Emperor Charles V abolished the guild constitution. Charles was punishing the guild regime for introducing the Reformation in Augsburg and for joining the Protestant Schmalkaldic League that fought against imperial forces. Because the patricians had resisted the introduction of the Reformation as long as possible, Charles held the guildsmen responsible for what he considered insurrection and bad government. This ‘‘disorderly government,’’ he argued, was due to the fact that many members of the city council in Augsburg were ‘‘from the community, elected by and taken from the handicrafts and guildsmen, who for the most part are simple uneducated people, not qualified to govern, and are of that condition, that they better understand their handicraft and earning their daily bread, than governing for the common good.’’ So Charles returned the patricians to the position of political authority which he considered their birthright. The Caroline reform set up a new constitution which gave the patricians an absolute majority on the council. The patricians received thirty-one seats, their associates, the <em>Mehrer</em>, received three, and ‘‘the community’’ ( <em>Gemeinde</em>) which included all commoners, both merchants and artisans, received seven. In a slight alteration in , the merchants were defined as a political estate distinct from the rest of the ‘‘commoners.’’ They received four seats on the council.</p>
<p>Councilmen were appointed for life. All important government posts were reserved for patricians, who were at the same time members of the city council.</p>
<p>The seventeen political guilds that had sent representatives to the council were abolished. The guildhouses were confiscated and sold, their documents burned.</p>
<p>When we speak of artisanal guilds in the period after , this refers to the economic and social organizations of individual trades. Crafts did form corporate groups, but they were no longer political guilds. The authoritarian patrician regime encroached on the autonomy of the crafts, restricting their rights to manage their own affairs. The heads of the new guilds were no longer elected by their fellow</p>

<p>Patricians remained the ruling caste in the city until Augsburg’s status as a free imperial city ended in . But while the guilds were politically powerless after</p>
<p>, they still had tremendous social power, which caused their patrician lords considerable discomfort, as we shall see in the next chapters.</p>
<p>As a result of the Caroline constitutional reform, a small minority of Catholic patrician families governed over a predominantly Protestant population. In the second half of the sixteenth century three-fourths of the population adhered to the Protestant confession. The patrician council did not attempt to recatholicize the city, but instead governed with discretion and did everything in its power to minimize confessional tensions. With the exception of religious unrest associated with the introduction of the Gregorian calendar in , Catholics and Protestants managed to coexist peacefully until the early years of the Thirty Years’ War.</p>
<p>Confessional allegiance did not yet play a significant role in social life, as is evidenced by the fact the official documents did not mention citizens’ confession until .</p>
<p>The Thirty Years’ War had a devastating effect on the city. Sieges and occupations, first by the Bavarians, then by the Swedes, then again by the Bavarians, and the famines and pestilence which accompanied them reduced Augsburg’s population from , at the onset of the war to around , in . During the rest of its history as a free imperial city, Augsburg never regained its pre-war population.</p>
<p>During the war, political power was in the hands of ultra-Catholics or militant Protestants, depending on the larger political constellation beyond the city walls.</p>
<p>The patriciate was enlarged once more during the Thirty Years’ War. Emperor Ferdinand II forced thirteen Catholic families on the patriciate in , in order to tip the confessional balance in the city government in favor of the Catholics. After this date there were no major additions to the patriciate. Despite these upheavals, Augsburg’s constitutional structure was not changed.</p>
<p>The introduction of confessional ‘‘parity’’ in the Augsburg city government after the Peace of Westphalia in  caused an increase in government posts to accommodate both Catholic and Protestant office-holders, but brought no change in the power relations between patricians and commoners. Since the confessional division went through all estates, no estate was identified with a particular confession, so that confessional tensions did not have political impact. Augburg experienced a ‘‘confessionalization’’ of social life and culture, however. Catholics and Protestants dressed differently, established separate schools, and developed distinctive demographic patterns. Cross-confessional marriages had been perfectly</p>

<p>acceptable in the late sixteenth and the early seventeenth centuries, but they were all but unheard of after . This hardening of confessional boundaries had very little impact upon dishonorable people, however, as we shall see below. After the Thirty Years’ War the city did regain a solid prosperity. Augsburg’s population had grown to around , by  and increased to around , in . Artistic crafts, such as the gold-and silversmiths, flourished in this period, as did a new breed of entrepreneurs who set up textile manufactures in the city. Augsburg, after Frankfurt, was the second center of banking and finance in southern Germany. But in spite of these favorable economic circumstances, Augsburg was now a provincial city that never again acquired the political and economic significance it had during its golden age in the late fifteenth and sixteenth century.</p>
<p>In the eighteenth century the socially exclusive patriciate grew smaller, just as it had before . Around  there were only twenty-seven or twenty-eight patrician families left, which shared the thirty-one council seats reserved for patricians. By the late eighteenth century only twenty-two families can be identified. The constitution of  had tried to forestall nepotism by forbidding two members of the same family to hold a seat in the council at once, but with such a small patriciate this rule could not be enforced. Considering that council members held their seat for life and that they filled at least one other government post at the same time, it is clear that this situation would result in a considerable accumulation of offices within a few families. A renewal of the patriciate as had occurred in </p>
<p>would seem to have been the obvious solution, but this was not even suggested. The more rigidly stratified society of the eighteenth century did not allow for the social mobility of the more open society of the early sixteenth century. The patricians saw themselves as the estate that was born to govern. They were also financially dependent on the highly remunerated government posts since few of them were still active in commerce. When government offices were filled, patrician status counted more than competence, so that the last decades of patrician rule were characterized by corruption and mismanagement, which precipitated a financial crisis so severe that it would have brought down the government, had not the Napoleonic war resolved the crisis another way. In  Augsburg lost its independence. The government was dissolved and the city was incorporated into the Bavarian territorial state.</p>
<p>So far in our discussion of Augsburg’s constitution and politics, and of the relationship between patricians and commoners, we have considered only a privileged minority of Augsburg’s population: patricians, merchants, and master guildsmen were citizens. Citizens only made up about one-fifth of Augsburg’s total</p>

<p>population in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. Citizenship ( <em>Bu¨rgerrecht</em>) was not easy to obtain. It could be acquired by inheritance or marriage, or it could be bought. Citizenship entailed being a head of household, paying city taxes, and doing military service. Citizens swore a yearly oath of obedience to the city government. Only citizens were entitled to political representation and could sit on the city council. Female citizens were eligible for welfare, and they could confer citizenship on their husbands if they married a non-citizen. However, they did not participate in the public political manifestations of citizenship. When the storm bell rang to summon male citizens to assemble at the city hall, women were required to stay indoors. After  the council introduced a property requirement for prospective citizens, in order to ensure that the new citizens would not become a burden on the urban welfare system. In  the council decreed that foreigners who wanted to marry and settle in Augsburg had to prove that they were personally free and of legitimate birth. Non-citizens were required to apply for residency ( <em>Beisitz</em>), which they received for the payment of a yearly fee. It was up to the council’s discretion whether to renew the residence permit, to which residents had no legal claim. Residents had no political rights and were not entitled to guild membership.</p>
<p>The right to acquire guild membership gave citizens a significant economic advantage over residents, but it did not necessarily protect them from poverty.</p>
<p>Economic equality was a guild ideal. Guild regulations limiting the size of the shops and the amount that might be produced were supposed to ensure a basic economic parity between guild members. In reality, however, guilds were far from socially homogeneous. While wealthy masters could not expand production in their own shops, they could trade their commodity and hire poorer masters in a put-out system. The weavers, who formed the largest and one of the oldest of Augsburg’s guilds, provide an extreme example of the economic disparities that could exist within a trade. Around  the guild had about , members, of whom ,</p>
<p>were classified as ‘‘have-nots’’ ( <em>habnits</em>), as owning no taxable property, in the tax records of that year. More than half of the guild membership was living in poverty. While the number of weavers varied greatly in the late middle ages and the early modern era, throughout the entire period a large proportion of the guild membership consisted of chronically underemployed impoverished weaver masters, who posed a constant threat of social unrest and conflict within the city. These poor weavers were totally dependent on the put-out work they received from a minority of wealthy weavers-turned-merchants who formed the economic elite</p>

<p>within the guild. On the other hand, the legendary rise of the Fugger family also took place within this guild. Extreme social polarization within the guilds and within the city as a whole went hand in hand with the accumulation of vast fortunes by the merchant elite during the golden age.</p>
<p>There were plenty of poor citizens, then, but residents were even more likely to be poor. Rural immigrants, unskilled workers, servants, and maids provided cheap labor and were given residence permits for as long as they held a position, but then were ordered to move on. These ‘‘foreigners’’ were not entitled to urban welfare. If they could not subsist on their low wages, they turned to begging. As non-citizens they would not receive official permission to beg and unlicensed begging was punished with expulsion. Repeat offenders were whipped or even branded before they were expelled again. They were then in danger of sinking permanently into the growing population of the vagrant poor. According to one estimate, , vagrant beggars lived in and just outside Augsburg in , subsisting on alms and constantly threatened by starvation or the heavy-handed system of criminal justice.</p>
<p>Citizens who became impoverished were less likely to be criminalized than foreign beggars. They could apply for urban welfare and the permission to beg. However, they too were visibly stigmatized. Welfare recipients and licensed beggars were required to wear the <em>Stadtpir</em>, Augsburg’s red, white, and green civic emblem, visibly on their clothing. Ostensibly this symbol served to distinguish the ‘‘honorable’’ deserving poor who had fallen into poverty through no fault of their own from the foreign able-bodied beggar who was unwilling to work. But in a society obsessed with outward symbols of social status, wearing the *Stadtpir * could only be a badge of dishonor.</p>
<p>The sumptuary legislation enacted in the city illustrates the importance attached to external symbols of social status in this society. The patrician government enacted clothing ordinances designed to codify and fix the political hierarchy as it was laid down in the Caroline reform and the social hierarchy on which it was based. This legislation was supposed to ensure that a person’s outward appearance matched his social estate as it was legally defined in the society of orders. The clothing ordinance of  condemned extravagant clothing, ‘‘especially among artisans and common people, and their journeymen and servants’’ which was so excessive ‘‘that one can no longer distinguish one estate from another.’’ Such a</p>

<p><em>The meaning of dishonor</em></p>
<p>state of confusion could not be tolerated since ‘‘God himself instituted a difference among the estates which is upheld in all well-governed republics,’’ as the magistrate explained in the renewed clothing ordinance of . In the ordinance of  the city council distinguished between three estates and legislated the amount of money each estate might spend on clothing. Patricians, members of the <em>Herrenstube</em>, formed the first estate. The *Mehrer * were listed together with the patricians, though their clothing was to be slightly less luxurious. Respected merchants who were incorporated in the society of merchants made up the second estate. The third estate finally included everyone else, members of the community, both merchants and artisans, who were not incorporated in the two elite societies, the *Herrenstube * or the society of merchants. This third estate was then broken down into three groups.</p>
<p>Lesser merchants and the respected and artistic trades made up the first group, followed by the middling trades. Common and lowly trades, journeymen and servants formed the last group.</p>
<p>The clothing ordinance of  was more elaborate than the preceding one. It distinguished between five estates or ‘‘classes’’ instead of three. The three groups listed under the heading of ‘‘the community’’ in  were now defined as separate estates. The ordinance also spelled out more clearly who belonged in these last three estates. Lesser merchants, notaries, and artistic trades such as goldsmiths, printers, and clock-makers made up the first order of commoners. Beer-brewers, bakers, butchers, dyers, and ‘‘others of their estate’’ were defined as middling trades which comprised the fourth class. The third order among commoners, finally, included the common and lowly trades – which the ordinance does not list specifically – along with common journeymen, servants and maids, carriers, and day-laborers. The renewed clothing ordinance of  followed the same model.</p>
<p>The dynamic between the social hierarchy as it was reflected in sumptuary legislation and the political and economic hierarchies within the city was complex and changing. The guild revolt of  and the establishment of a guild constitution corrected a disparity between the political and economic hierarchies in the city by giving political power to rich new merchants and successful artisans who often surpassed the old patriciate in wealth, though not in social prestige. A growing imbalance between social rank and economic potency was corrected in  when the most successful merchant families were elevated to patrician status to rejuven-ate a patriciate that was just about bled dry. The next centuries saw no further realignments of this kind, which resulted in a growing divergence between the social and political elite on the one hand and the economic elite on the other. The new gold and silver merchants, textile manufacturers and bankers who formed the economic elite after the Thirty Years’ War were much more wealthy than the shrinking patriciate, which was considered impoverished in the eighteenth century.</p>

<p><em>Honor, status, and pollution</em></p>
<p>Surprisingly, this discrepancy did not lead to conflicts between patricians and rich commoners. Wealthy merchants did not question the social hierarchy and the criteria of honor as they were set by the patriciate; rather they tried to gain greater social prestige through sociability, or better yet, intermarriage with the patriciate.</p>
<p>This mercantile elite remained politically quiescent, content to leave government in the hands of the patricians, who for the most part governed in the merchants’</p>
<p>interests. Only in the late eighteenth century, when the patrician mismanagement of city finances threatened business, did the government come under fire by the economic elite. Before this crisis was resolved, the problem was solved from the outside when Augsburg was integrated into Bavaria.</p>
<p>This was the social, political and economic context within which <em>Unehrliche</em> *Leute * lived in early modern Augsburg. We now turn to the place of dishonorable people within this corporate society, and their interaction with honorable estates.</p>
<p>How did the boundary that separated the dishonorable from honorable society function in practice?</p>
<p>DISHONOR IN LEGAL THEORY</p>
<p>‘‘Just as certain parts of the human body, which modesty forbids to mention, dispose of feces, so the hangmen are the lowest members of the body politic and are most effective in cleansing and maintaining the state . . .’’ This remarkable organic metaphor was offered by a legal scholar in , in his contribution to a long-standing debate among early modern jurists on the legal status of executioners and skinners. Jurists had different viewpoints on the executioner’s dishonor. Some pointed to the infamy of the Roman <em>carnifex</em>, who was denied citizenship and lived in an isolated place outside the city: ‘‘He is considered infamous in both secular and religious law, and . . . like a wild animal, he is excluded from the community of honorable people.’’ The German executioner, these jurists argued, was affected by the same legal disabilities. The majority opinion, however, was that the executioner’s office was not infamous in and of itself, but was useful, indeed indispensable. According to Roman law, legal infamy ( <em>infamia juris</em>) resulted from the commission of a serious crime and the criminal punishment that followed. This type of infamy did not apply to the executioner. He did not commit a crime when</p>

<p>he killed, but carried out the just judgments of God and legitimate government.</p>
<p>But however justified and necessary, the work of executioners and skinners consisted of ‘‘sordid’’ and ‘‘cruel’’ tasks, cleaning latrines, skinning dead animals and disposing of carrion, torturing prisoners and performing criminal executions, so that a certain moral turpitude attached to these ‘‘contemptible and gross’’ offices.</p>
<p>Seventeenth-and eighteenth-</p>
<p>century jurists did not hesitate to express their</p>
<p>contempt: the executioner’s job was a ‘‘vile and sordid office, which honorable people greatly abhor.’’ Executioners themselves were ‘‘hated and cursed.’’</p>
<p>Such disdain was institutionalized in the legal concept of *levis notae macula * or</p>
<p>‘‘disreputability.’’ This concept was derived from Roman law and entailed a lesser degree of dishonor than *infamia * proper. This ‘‘light taint’’ resulted in certain legal disabilities, though there was little consensus on what these were. Various jurists summarized the effects of <em>levis notae macula</em>: executioners and skinners were required to wear special identifying clothes. They had to live outside the city walls away from honorable people. They had to stand separately in church and were excluded from weddings and public meetings. If an honorable person named an executioner in his will, the testament could be contested. They could not give valid testimony in court. They were barred from all honorific offices, dignities and fiefs and they could not be legal guardians. They were not eligible for citizenship and, of course, they were excluded from honorable guilds.</p>
<p>Jurists rationalized the legal dishonor of the executioner by distinguishing between the office of the executioner and the individual person who exercised the office. While the office of executioner was not dishonorable, the dishonor of executioners as a social fact was justified in practice by their dissolute lifestyle and bad morals. According to the jurists, executioners were often robbers and murderers who had escaped their own execution by accepting this post. Executioners were described as bloodthirsty tyrants who treated the condemned with deliberate cruelty and exercised their office ‘‘more out of . . . hatred and enmity, than out of eagerness and love for justice.’’ A similar argument was used to explain why the legal dishonor of executioners, skinners, and beadles extended to their children.</p>
<p>The jurist Do¨pler conceded that theoretically a child should not be penalized for the faults of his parents, in other words the child of a dishonorable person should not be considered dishonorable.

<p>dishonor conflicts. How did different social estates interact with dishonorable people? How great was the threat of dishonor pollution in daily life? The following cases all involve executioners and skinners, because casual contact with other defiled trades that were dishonorable to a lesser degree – bailiffs, barber-surgeons, grave-diggers, etc. – posed less of a threat of pollution.</p>
<p>THE LINGUISTIC BOUNDARY OF HONOR</p>
<p>Pollution anxieties were reflected in a peculiar linguistic practice, a stylistic convention of writing. Simply writing the words ‘‘skinner’’ or ‘‘executioner’’ could pose a threat to the writer’s honor. From the sixteenth through the eighteenth century, scribes felt it necessary to insert certain formulaic expressions in the text as a precaution, a kind of verbal ‘‘countermagic,’’ against pollution before writing an</p>
<p>‘‘unclean’’ word. A variety of expressions were used for this purpose. When three rope-makers entered the skinner’s house in , artisans who reported this incident used the phrase <em>mit Zu¨chten zu melden</em>: ‘‘these three, <em>to report with</em> <em>discipline</em>, were in the skinner’s house.’’ When some journeyman bakers engaged in fisticuffs with the executioner in , the bakers’ guild informed the council in these words: ‘‘. . . *to report with honor *[ <em>mit Eeren zumelden</em>] the executioner approached together with the skinner.’’ Other expressions were <em>mit Gebu¨r zu melden</em> (‘‘to report with delicacy’’), *mit Reverentz zu melden * or *reverendo *(‘‘to report with reverence’’), *salvo honore *(‘‘saving honor’’) or *salva venia *(‘‘saving your permission).’’ These last three formulas were used most frequently and were often abbreviated as *rdo. *, *s.h. *, or *s.v. * These expressions were used in official documents issued by the city government as well as in petitions by artisans through the eighteenth century. In  the weavers discussed the case of a peasant woman who had unwittingly slept with a ‘‘ *redo. * skinner’s son.’’ In  the bookbinders petitioned the council to exclude an ‘‘ *s.v. * beadle’’ from their guild and in  the stonemasons declared that ‘‘ *s.v. * whores’ children’’ could not be accepted into the guild. Such formulas were also used when writing about unclean things, such as latrines, feces, carrion, open wounds, infection, or bad smells. In  the tanners corresponded with the council about the ‘‘severe epidemic <em>salvo honore</em>’’ that had broken out among the cattle. In  the grave-diggers complained to the council about the ‘‘ *reverendo * very great stench’’ they were exposed to in their work. A skinner’s employment contract from  stipulated that he had to empty the ‘‘ *s.v. *</p>
<p>secret chambers,’’ while a contract from  ordered him to bury ‘‘ *s.v. * dead</p>

<p>animals’’ during epidemics. Interestingly, skinners and executioners themselves used these expressions. In  the skinner Johann Jacob Scheller wrote about the</p>
<p>‘‘ *s.h. * infected sheep’’ he personally had skinned. In this case, the formula seems to have been pure stylistic convention – or could the skinner have feared to name the things he touched daily?</p>
<p>The tanners took such verbal protection to the greatest extreme. They refused to use questionable words at all. According to the seventeenth-century jurist Adrian Beier, the tanners were ‘‘so honorable and touchy’’ that they refused even to speak the word ‘‘skinner.’’ Instead they called him ‘‘the unnamed man’’ ( <em>der ungenannte</em> <em>Mann</em>). Other artisans felt similar inhibitions to name the skinner. ‘‘The good people do not want to pollute their mouth with such an unclean word,’’ so they preferred the more neutral words *Entdecker *(someone who uncovers) or <em>Feldmeister</em> (field-master) to the specific word *Schinder *(skinner). Beier implies that artisans used apotropaic verbal formulae in speech as well as writing, though it is unclear if this was the general practice. It is also unclear if the use of such formulae was merely conventional, or whether these expressions reveal genuine emotion and fear of contamination.</p>
<p>ARTISANAL AMBIVALENCE</p>
<p>How did pollution anxieties structure personal interactions – on the street, in the tavern, or in the home? In  three master rope-makers visited the skinner’s house outside the city walls to question the skinner’s wife about a dispute she had witnessed. They were careful, as they later claimed, not to eat or drink with the woman or any member of the skinner’s household. They stated their business and left. And yet, this brief encounter was enough to leave a taint on the masters’ honor.</p>
<p>It was not customary for honorable masters to go to such places, the journeymen rope-makers claimed. They demanded that the masters be fined for their transgression of the artisanal code of honor, a demand they backed up with a strike against the entire rope-makers’ guild. In  journeyman bakers pelted the executioner and skinner with stones as they were passing by. When the executioner grabbed one of the journeymen to force him to divulge the names of the stone-throwers, this incident became a matter of serious concern for both the bakers’</p>
<p>guild and city government. The executioner’s polluting touch might have left a</p>

<p>mark on the journeyman’s honor. This potential dishonor had to be contained. The executioner was arrested and fired and the city government made an official proclamation to restore the journeyman’s honor in its integrity. In , Thomas Biberer, a master stonemason, had his shop closed down by his fellow guildsmen for socializing with the skinner. At the guild’s request, the stonemason was arrested and questioned by the authorities: why was ‘‘he hanging around with the skinner,</p>
<p>. . . even eating and drinking with him, which is improper behavior for a stonemason and guildsman and brings great shame to the entire craft?’’</p>
<p>During the Thirty Years’ War a dishonor conflict almost provoked a diplomatic incident. In , during the Swedish occupation of Augsburg, a military chaplain was quartered in the home of a retail merchant, Georg Schmidt. One evening, Barbara Metz, wife of executioner Dietrich Metz, visited Schmidt’s home, where she joined Schmidt’s wife and several other women in a sewing circle. Soon Schmidt himself joined the women, and when the chaplain came home, they invited him to join them too. Unaware of Barbara Metz’s identity, the preacher drank ‘‘three or four glasses of wine’’ in this company. Afterwards, he was dismayed to learn whom he had been drinking with. When news of this incident reached his regiment ‘‘the chaplain was held in ridicule, and his commanding officer refused to tolerate him in the regiment.’’ Georg Schmidt was arrested and imprisoned. Not only the preacher himself, but his entire regiment had been insulted in this affair. Schmidt was sharply admonished: if he wanted to drink with the executioner’s wife, he should have done so alone. ‘‘He should not have burdened others, particularly a clergyman, with such company and conversation.’’</p>
<p>Why had he not invited a Catholic priest? Here heightened confessional tension during this period of military occupation come to the fore. Georg Schmidt was Catholic, and the Protestant city government interpreted this incident as a deliberate slur against a Protestant clergyman. Georg Schmidt was punished severely. He was exposed at the pillory – a serious honor punishment which left a mark of infamy on the delinquent – and banished from the city.</p>
<p>Another illustrative case involved the burial of the executioner’s servant Hans Georg Reiser in . When Reiser died after serving the executioner Marx Philipp Hartmann for twenty-three years, two journeyman stonemasons, the brothers Hans Georg and Franz Mozart helped to carry the body to the grave. The Mozarts’</p>
<p>fellow journeymen saw this as a serious transgression: it was not appropriate for honorable journeymen to bury ‘‘such a disreputable person.’’ For the sake of ‘‘filthy money’’ – the journeymen claimed the Mozarts had taken payment for carrying the body – the brothers had deviated widely from the ‘‘path of honor’’ ( <em>via honestatis</em>).</p>

<p>At first sight, then, social practice seems to conform to the picture of dishonor presented in early modern legal theory: executioners and skinners appear as pariahs. But in fact the situation was more complex. A closer look at individual cases reveals that the social exclusion of executioners and skinners was not complete or consistent. The line that separated dishonorable people from honorable society was often blurred. The case involving the military preacher’s unwitting sociability with the executioner’s wife in  makes this clear. In the course of the investigation, Barbara Metz, the executioner’s wife, was asked what she was doing in the Schmidt household. She answered ‘‘she has been known in the Schmidt household since her youth . . . She has often eaten there, and since she is so well known, Schmidt’s wife invites her often.’’ Schmidt’s wife and Barbara Metz employed the same sewing woman. When asked whether Schmidt had brought her together with the preacher as a deliberate insult to him, she answered that no insult had been intended: ‘‘Many elegant gentlemen drink with her husband. There are honorable artisans here who sometimes do it. She is surprised that this affair has caused such conflict, especially since she is only a woman . . .’’ When Schmidt was asked why he allowed the preacher and the executioner’s wife to drink together, he answered ‘‘if he had foreseen that it would mean anything, he would have prevented it.’’ When the serving maid was asked why she did not tell the preacher who Barbara Metz was, she answered she had not thought of it. All parties – with the exception of the preacher – seemed bewildered that this incident caused such dissension. Obviously none of the members of the Schmidt household considered this sociability with the executioner’s wife, which occurred in the private space of their own home, particularly polluting. As a retail merchant, Schmidt was not a member of an artisanal guild and was not bound by the strict artisanal code of honor. In normal times this incident would most likely have passed unnoticed. In the tense political atmosphere engendered by military occupation and confessional strife, however, this incident was misinterpreted by the government as a deliberate confessional slur and punished as such.</p>
<p>The marriage of the young fisherman Andreas Anhauser and the skinner’s daughter Barbara Leichnam in , discussed in the introduction, raises the question of how he met her in the first place. It turns out that the fishermen regularly took refuge in the skinner’s residence near the water when a storm came up and drank beer with him. As Anhauser put it, the fishermen frequented the skinner’s house ‘‘like a tavern and did not hesitate to eat and drink there.’’ They had not realized that this association was so problematic, the fishermen responded, and ‘‘even if one or the other among us ate or drank with the skinner, this taint can</p>

<p><em>Honor, status, and pollution</em></p>
<p>be removed . . . [by not doing it anymore] and will be forgotten with the passage of time.’’ By contrast, the skinner’s dishonor would live on in the offspring of Anhauser and Barbara Leichnam for generations. Casual sociability had been acceptable to the fishermen, but they drew the line at marriage. But this line only became visible because it had been transgressed. To what extent had the fishermen been conscious of the skinner’s dishonor as they ate and drank with him? Now they no longer frequented the skinner’s house and fined those who had done so. They petitioned the city council to insert a new article in their ordinance that stated explicitly that only persons of honorable background could enter their guild. In the course of this conflict, the boundary that separated the fishermen from dishonorable people had been redrawn with greater clarity and greater exclusiveness.</p>
<p>The Mozart brothers’ conflict with the stonemasons’ guild in  illustrates once again that the boundary of honor was not clearly drawn. The Mozarts pointed out some inconsistencies in the position of their guild. How could the guild exclude them for carrying the executioner’s assistant to his grave – an act of Christian charity, after all – and at the same time accept two journeymen in their guild who lived in the same house as the executioner? The ‘‘night-king,’’ the chief latrine-cleaner who shared the executioner’s residence, had two sons living with him who worked as journeyman stonemasons. These two journeymen had even signed a petition directed against the Mozarts. The stonemasons never explained why they classified the Mozarts’ behavior as dishonorable, but did not reject the two journeymen who came in daily contact with the executioner within their home. Instead, they accused the Mozarts of stalling by presenting irrelevant examples.</p>
<p>Interaction between executioners and skinners and honorable artisans seems to have been characterized more by ambivalence than outright hostility. There were plenty of cases where honorable artisans came into personal contact and even socialized with the executioner or skinner without any adverse social consequences.</p>
<p>Generally, negative social sanctions seem to have been invoked when the association of an artisan with executioner or skinner was particularly public. The stonemason Thomas Biberer rode on the public street on the same skinner’s cart that was used to transport both carrion and condemned criminals in public procession to the gallows. Andreas Anhauser’s marriage with the skinner’s daughter was notorious. The Mozart brothers had carried the body of the executioner’s servant in a public ceremony. Conversely, the stonemasons might have been willing to accept the journeymen who shared the executioner’s residence because their contact with the executioner took place in the private space of their home, shielded from the public eye. Moreover, it appears that cases of personal association that might have passed unchallenged in normal times resulted in dishonor conflicts in time of high political tension. This was certainly the case with the unfortunate retailer Georg Schmidt who was banished from the city during the Thirty Years’</p>

<p>War. But in the end it is impossible to know what personal factors or unknown variables made one case of personal association between an artisan and the executioner or skinner perfectly harmless and acceptable, while another case which appears very similar had disastrous social consequences for the individual artisan and his guild. There was no hard-and-fast rule concerning the social exclusion of the executioner and skinner in practice. Individuals and guilds developed different sensibilities and different levels of tolerance towards dishonorable people. Honorable artisans behaved inconsistently (from our perspective) and there appears to have been little consensus on how polluting the dishonor of executioner and skinner actually was.</p>
<p>How did different estates and social classes feel and act towards dishonorable people? Sources from which one might glean the feelings and opinions of members of the social class beneath the guildsmen, the unskilled day-laborers, rural immigrants, and servants who were granted residency in Augsburg for as long as their employment lasted, are difficult to come by. According to the guildsmen, these groups were less sensitive to pollution by dishonor. Casual laborers were not incorporated in guilds. They acted as individuals and were not bound by the collective strictures of a corporate code of honor – and thus, in the eyes of the guildsmen, they had little honor to lose. In their dispute with the Mozart brothers, the stonemasons asked why the journeymen had stooped to the dishonoring task of carrying an executioner’s servant to his grave, when there was an abundance of day-laborers and ‘‘other persons who are not admissible to guilds’’ who could have carried the body, without doing damage to their honor.</p>
<p>But were the urban poor that indifferent to questions of honor? When the journeyman weavers went on strike in  to expel from their guild various groups they defined as dishonorable, among them grave-diggers, city officials urged the council not to let the journeymen get away with this. If the weavers were successful in labeling grave-diggers as dishonorable, the city government would be unable to hire enough grave-diggers in times of epidemic. Even Augsburg’s day-laborers dreamed of social advancement into the artisanate and they would not, the city officials argued, risk disqualifying their children for entry into an honorable guild for the low wages of a grave-digger.</p>
<p>DISHONOR AND SECULAR ELITES</p>
<p>An Augsburg chronicle tells of a misadventure that befell a group of patricians from the free imperial city of No¨rdlingen, among them a doctor of law, as they returned home from a journey by night. The event allegedly occurred in . Overtaken by</p>

<p>a terrible storm and frightened by the appearance of a fiery figure, they lost control of their carriage, which rolled down a slope. Stranded, the travelers cried out for help. A stranger appeared who guided them to a nearby inn. When the innkeeper’s wife served dinner, the travelers invited their unknown rescuer to join them. But the innkeeper’s wife insisted on serving him at a separate table. When the doctor of law protested, the woman informed him that the stranger was the local skinner.</p>
<p>‘‘Whoever he may be, he helped us greatly,’’ the doctor of law exclaimed, and gave the skinner a generous tip. The travelers did not go so far as to invite the skinner to join them, but they did not seem shocked at his identity and revealed a higher level of tolerance towards the skinner than we might have expected from honorable artisans. Is the relatively humane behavior towards a skinner an indication that elites regarded the marginalization of dishonorable people with skepticism? Another case gives the opposite impression. In  a notary was imprisoned for making subversive comments against the government because an executioner from one of the military regiments occupying the city had been quartered in his home.</p>
<p>During the notary’s interrogation his questioners, patrician city council members, expressed sympathy with his reaction. One said he would not set foot in the notary’s house, because of the executioner’s presence. Another said that executioners should be lodged with their equals, or at least in empty, abandoned buildings.</p>
<p>These fragmentary stories are our only evidence on personal reactions of elites towards dishonorable people. Statements of public policy are, not surprisingly, more frequent. Legislation about dishonor on the imperial and local level is abundant. The imperial police ordinance of  prescribed special identifying clothing for the executioner, as for prostitutes and Jews. The subsequent police ordinance of  made no mention of the executioner at all, but decreed that various other defiled trades were to be considered honorable. This was the first time groups on the periphery of dishonor were mentioned in imperial legislation.</p>
<p>The next imperial ordinance to address the issue of dishonor was the police ordinance of . The article on ‘‘Town-dwellers, peasants, and other subjects’’</p>
<p>criticized excessively luxurious clothing of commoners as detrimental to the common good. In this context, the ordinance made the same association as had the ordinance of : it laid down that ‘‘prostitutes, executioners, and Jews dress in such a way that honor is obscured and a person’s condition and estate cannot be recognized.’’ To counter such disorder, territorial and city governments were ordered to produce an effective local clothing ordinance within the year. This same ordinance, however, set out to rehabilitate other dishonorable groups.

<p><em>The meaning of dishonor</em></p>
<p>weavers, barber-surgeons, shepherds, millers, customs officers, musicians, and bathmasters and their children were pronounced honorable and artisanal guilds were forbidden to exclude them. These were the same trades that had been declared honorable in the previous ordinance of , apparently without much effect.</p>
<p>In  the imperial diet produced a proposal for an imperial police ordinance.</p>
<p>The proposal complained that previous police ordinances of , , and </p>
<p>against artisanal ‘‘abuses’’ had not been enforced. It set out to limit the autonomy of guilds and journeymen’s organizations and called for greater cooperation between territorial governments. It reconfirmed earlier ordinances, in particular the article which decreed that ‘‘the children of certain persons may not be excluded from the guilds . . .’’ It condemned such exclusion as ‘‘unreasonable’’ and added several groups to this list of trades to be rehabilitated. In addition to the trades which were declared honorable in the ordinances of  and , the proposal declared that</p>
<p>‘‘bailiffs . . . who do not lay hands on the malefactors or carry out criminal executions . . ., city guards, foresters . . ., grave diggers and others of this kind’’ were not to be barred from honorable guilds. No mention was made of any special clothing requirements for executioners or skinners. This proposal was not enacted at this time due to disputes over jurisdiction and competencies between imperial, territorial, and city governments.</p>
<p>The proposal was taken off the shelf some sixty years later, when the Augsburg journeyman shoemakers’ strike of  made the ineffectiveness of previous ordinances and the persistence of artisanal ‘‘abuses’’ glaringly obvious. This strike was not the result of a dishonor conflict, but was triggered by the attempt of the Augsburg city government to limit the autonomy of the journeymen’s association.</p>
<p>The Augsburg conflict was part of a super-regional journeymen’s boycott which spread from Wu¨rzburg, Augsburg, Stuttgart, and Munich through southern Germany and Austria and lasted for more than two years. This wave of strikes clearly demonstrated the impotence of local governments in conflicts with super-regional journeymen’s organizations. The imperial and local governments responded to the strike with the imperial police ordinance of  which set out to break the power of journeymen’s organizations once and for all by coordinating governmental measures of different territorial states and cities. The ordinance presented an up-dated version of the proposal of . It described artisans’ fear of pollution by dishonor as ‘‘madness’’ ( <em>ein falscher Wahn</em>). It reconfirmed that those groups listed in the ordinances of  and  were honorable, and extended the list to include beadles, bailiffs, city guards, foresters, grave-diggers, nightwatchmen, beggar-</p>

<p>wardens, street-cleaners, shepherds, ‘‘and the like . . .’’ The law of  went further than the proposal of . The proposal had pronounced only those bailiffs honorable who did not deal with ‘‘malefactors’’ and who were not involved in the execution process, but the police ordinance of  did not make this distinction. In fact, implicitly, the executioner himself was declared honorable in this ordinance. It decreed that ‘‘no profession and craft’’ could be considered dishonorable, ‘‘except the skinners alone, until their second generation, under the condition that the first generation chooses a different honorable condition and remains in that condition for at least thirty years . . .’’ In other words, the grandson of a skinner should be considered honorable, if his father had not worked as a skinner for at least thirty years. This clearly illustrates the difference in the status of executioners and skinners. While the rehabilitation of the executioner was implied in the ordinance, even the imperial government did not tackle the skinner’s dishonor at this time.</p>
<p>That it attempted to cleanse the grandchildren of skinners of their dishonor was already very daring.</p>
<p>Finally, in  an imperial decree addressed the dishonor of the skinner. While the decree described the work of the skinner as ‘‘reprehensible’’ ( <em>verwerflich</em>) and did not rehabilitate the skinner himself, it declared that ‘‘the children of such people, who have not yet done this reprehensible work themselves, and do not want to’’ were honorable. The sons could be apprenticed to honorable guilds and the daughters could marry artisans. The decree specifically stated that it was not concerned with executioners, since their sons were already admitted to guilds.</p>
<p>Whether or not this decree was in touch with reality on this point will be discussed in chapter .</p>
<p>This was the framework of imperial law within which territorial and city governments were – theoretically – supposed to legislate. Various local authorities did order executioners to wear special clothing. Following the imperial examples of</p>
<p> and , the city of Trier prescribed special dress for the executioner in its clothing ordinance of . After legislating what clothing the three estates –</p>
<p>nobles, members of the city council, and commoners – were entitled to wear, the ordinance discussed the clothing of ‘‘segregated people.’’ Once again we find the association of Jews and executioners. ‘‘So that the difference among segregated people is maintained and they are recognized,’’ Jews were required to wear yellow rings on their clothing and the executioner and his family were ordered ‘‘to dress entirely in yellow, yellow coats and trousers and not use any other color . . .’’</p>
<p>As late as , four years before the imperial police ordinance of , the Prussian government ordered executioners and skinners to wear dark gray clothes and forbade them to wear a sword. The king had been displeased to hear that</p>

<p><em>The meaning of dishonor</em></p>
<p>executioners and skinners were wearing discarded blue uniforms of the Prussian army. In  this order was renewed but now only applied to skinners, since executioners were considered honorable in imperial law after . Skinners were ordered to wear gray cloaks with gray buttons and red pointed hats and forbidden to wear a dagger. Such special clothing was required because, as the ordinance claimed, ‘‘when innocent honorable people unwittingly and accidentally came in contact with them, several skinners failed to identify themselves out of malice and evil intent, so that these people had great difficulties within their guilds.’’ The gray cloak and red hat would ensure that such skinners would be recognized straight away. Such ordinances are, of course, prescriptive sources, and we cannot know to what extent they were enforced.</p>
<p>A similar intention to make a person’s appearance reflect social ‘‘reality,’’ to make a person immediately recognizable for what he was, is evident in Augsburg’s sumptuary legislation – we saw that Augsburg’s clothing ordinances deplored ‘‘that one can no longer distinguish one estate from the other.’’ But this impulse to distinguish and classify did not result in the prescription of special dress for executioners in Augsburg. In fact, no such ordinance has been preserved anywhere in Swabia. Augsburg’s Swabian neighbors did, however, pass various measures to prevent contact and sociability with the executioner, reminiscent of the restrictive Strasbourg executioner’s ordinance of . In  the city of Memmingen forbade citizens to eat and drink with the executioner. In  the government of the small ecclesiastical territory of Kempten decreed that only the executioner’s family, relatives, and servants were allowed to eat with him. The Kempten government justified this measure by pointing out that when artisans socialized with the executioner, this resulted in disturbances within the guilds. In </p>
<p>Memmingen fined its executioner for holding a public dance at his residence and also fined those citizens who had attended. In  the executioner in the small Fugger territory of Babenhausen had to swear ‘‘not to touch anyone, man or woman, in the taverns or on the street, and not to bother them by drinking with them or other presumption. If I want to drink for my money I must do this alone and separately and not intrude or mix with others.’’ In  the skinner of Babenhausen was ordered not ‘‘to molest anyone in taverns or anywhere else.’’ In</p>
<p> the town of Kaufbeuren went even further and forbade the executioner to</p>

<p>frequent taverns at all. In  Kaufbeuren also forbade citizens to invite the executioner or his wife to local weddings.</p>
<p>Augsburg never enacted such restrictive legislation. Much to the contrary, Augsburg magistrates passed measures designed to protect the executioner against discrimination. In  Augsburg’s bathmasters apparently refused to serve him, for in that year the city council decreed that the executioner should be allowed to frequent public baths. In  the council issued a somewhat ambivalent decree, on the occasion of the executioner Hans Deibler’s wedding. ‘‘Hans Deibler should be informed that an honorable council will leave it to each individual’s discretion, whether he wants to attend Deibler’s wedding or not.’’ This was hardly an enthusiastic endorsement, but the council did not forbid the executioner to invite honorable citizens to his wedding.</p>
<p>The case of the stonemason Thomas Biberer who was arrested in  for socializing with the skinner at first sight seems to run counter to these examples.</p>
<p>The magistrates seemed to share the same view as honorable artisans towards dishonorable people. Biberer’s patrician interrogators admonished him that such an association ‘‘was improper behavior . . . brought great shame to the entire craft.’’ But perhaps their irritation was due to the dissension that resulted when individual craftsmen disregarded artisanal honor rules, and the inconvenience government faced in arbitrating the resulting dishonor conflicts, rather than any deeply felt disdain for the skinner on the part of the patricians. The entry in the punishment book on this case supports this interpretation: ‘‘Thomas Biberer, a stonemason, acted disrespectfully towards the foremen . . . of his trade . . . That is why he was imprisoned, but he was released today . . .’’ No mention was made of his inappropriate sociability with the skinner, since there was no law against such socializing. Biberer was fined for disrespect towards senior guild members.</p>
<p>In comparison with other Swabian municipal and territorial governments, the Augsburg magistrate developed relatively liberal policies towards executioners and skinners. Many of the effects of dishonor described by early modern jurists did not apply in Augsburg. Here executioners and skinners were not required to wear special clothing. In Augsburg, executioners and skinners faced no disabilities in court; they testified in criminal investigations and civil disputes and served as legal guardians. The legal prescription that executioners and skinners should be</p>

<p><em>The meaning of dishonor</em></p>
<p>excluded from honorific offices, dignities, and fiefs was of little practical consequence.</p>
<p>Two legal disabilities which, according to the lawyers, resulted from dishonor did affect executioners and skinners in Augsburg, however. Unquestionably, they were excluded from honorable guilds, and they were denied citizenship and thus full membership in the commune. As we saw above, applicants for citizenship had to fulfill certain legal and financial requirements. A decree of  ordered prospective citizens to supply proof of their legitimate ( <em>ehelich</em>) and free birth. These requirements were reconfirmed at regular intervals through the eighteenth century. Sometimes the decrees used the term ‘‘honorable’’ ( <em>ehrlich</em>) instead of</p>
<p>‘‘legitimate’’ when specifying who was eligible for citizenship. Even applicants for temporary residence permits were supposed to be ‘‘ <em>ehrlich</em>’’: a decree of </p>
<p>required residents to show certificates proving that they were ‘‘of honorable background and respectable behavior.’’ A decree of  specified that ‘‘only those of honorable background and conduct and who own sufficient property’’ would be granted citizenship or residency. It is not always clear how the use of the term *ehrlich * in governmental decrees should be interpreted. Was *ehrlich * simply used as a synonym for *ehelich * or did it have a broader meaning? The decree of </p>
<p>contrasted ‘‘honorable’’ candidates with ‘‘the poor, the unemployed, those burdened with many children, those who lead a dishonorable life, those who do not have a trade or profession by which to earn their bread.’’ In contradistinction to</p>
<p>‘‘honorable’’ citizens, all these groups were by implication somehow dishonorable, which makes the label *unehrlich * a broad fluid term in which moral, legal, and financial characteristics merged and can hardly be disentangled. Did the authors of these decrees also have the specific meaning of legal infamy in mind when they used the term *unehrlich * in this context?</p>
<p>The exclusion from citizenship and the exclusion from honorable guilds went hand in hand. Political and social identity in the city was conferred by a double membership, first in the civic corporation as a whole and then in one of the various corporate groups within the city which collectively constituted the commune.</p>
<p>Since  new citizens were required to join either an artisanal guild or a patrician or merchant corporation. This requirement was reconfirmed in a decree of .</p>
<p>Urban society was structured along corporate lines and executioners and skinners were not incorporated either in artisanal guilds or in the civic commune.</p>

<p><em>Honor, status, and pollution</em></p>
<p>After the mid-sixteenth century the names of executioners and skinners listed in tax records were consistently marked with a circle or a cross to indicate that they were ‘‘foreigners,’’ i.e., non-citizens. This was the same symbol which usually marked the names of foreign ‘‘residents.’’ But executioners and skinners were not residents in a legal sense. A legal brief of  described the traditional practice:</p>
<p>‘‘the executioner, skinner, and dungeon guards are neither citizens nor residents . . .</p>
<p>they are exempt from taxes, contributions, and guard duty . . .’’ Executioners, skinners, and dungeon guards occupied this indeterminate legal position through the eighteenth century. When the parish register recorded the marriages of an executioner and of a dungeon guard in , the scribe noted ‘‘neither executioner nor dungeon guard are treated as citizens.’’ In contrast to these eighteenth-century sources, earlier records do not make the legal status of executioners and skinners explicit. However, negative evidence – the fact that executioners and skinners do not appear in any lists of citizens or residents – makes it likely that they inhabited this same legal limbo in the second half of the sixteenth and the seventeenth centuries. Officially, they had no legal status in the commune at all.</p>
<p>How is this legal ‘‘non-status’’ of executioners and skinners to be interpreted? The policy of excluding executioners and skinners from citizenship and residency expressed symbolically the commune’s unwillingness to incorporate dishonorable elements. However, the reasoning behind this legal principle was never explained and it is not clear what practical implications this policy held for the authorities or for the executioners and skinners themselves.</p>
<p>There was little uniformity, then, in the policies of the different city and territorial governments towards the executioner and skinner. While executioners and skinners were generally excluded from citizenship in Swabia, many of Augsburg’s smaller neighbors went much further and sought actively to reinforce the social exclusion of executioners and skinners as a precaution against dishonor conflicts in the guilds. In contrast, the Augsburg city government was less sympathetic to the concerns of honorable guildsmen and did not enforce or even allow the complete social exclusion of executioner or skinner. In all cases, however, the policies of local governments were reactive. They did not initiate dishonor conflicts. Instead, they responded when such conflicts occurred among honorable artisans. Perhaps Augsburg’s comparatively liberal policies towards the executioner and skinner indicate that a greater mental distance separated Augsburg’s patrician magistrates from the honorable artisans they governed than was the case in the smaller towns like Memmingen or Kaufbeuren. Certainly, various expressions of exasperation by Augsburg’s political elite about artisans’ behavior in dishonor</p>

<p>conflicts give this impression. The magistrates complained that artisans did not adopt ‘‘a reasonable position, but judge everything according to their fantasy,’’ and deplored their ‘‘capriciousness and prejudice.’’ Apparently Augsburg’s magistrates, governors of a large and cosmopolitan city, treated the polluting power of dishonor with greater skepticism than neighboring city governments, magistrates of the small and provincial free imperial cities, and territorial towns which dotted the Swabian countryside.</p>
<p>DISHONOR AND THE CHURCH</p>
<p>After examining the legal position of dishonorable people, we now turn to the executioner’s spiritual state. What position did Catholic and Protestant churches take towards capital punishment and towards the executioner? The provision of the Strasbourg executioner’s ordinance ordering executioners to stand in a separate space in church, and the statement in the Bamberg criminal code that executioners might be excluded from Holy Communion indicate that executioners suffered severe religious disabilities. However, both the Strasbourg ordinance and the *Bambergensis * were secular codes that did not have authority to legislate in spiritual affairs, and in this instance the Bamberg code reads more like a description of actual practice than a decree.</p>
<p>What was religious practice? Secular ordinances and urban chronicles of the fifteenth century described the office of executioner as intrinsically sinful. A Frankfurt chronicle told of an executioner who resigned his position in </p>
<p>because of ‘‘the great sins he had committed due to his office . . .’’ He ‘‘prayed that God might mercifully forgive him.’’ When executioners resigned in order to escape their sinful state, they often turned to high religious authorities to receive absolution, as did the Ulm executioner Hans Maurer in the mid-fifteenth century.</p>
<p>He was given a penance by the bishop of Wu¨rzburg and then set out on a pilgrimage to see the pope in Rome. Urban authorities often supported their executioners who resigned for reasons of conscience, giving them references and documents which allowed them to beg to support themselves on their way to a pilgrimage shrine, as did the magistrate of Eger in , encouraging believers to give charitably. In fact, executioners on pilgrimage became such familiar figures by the late fifteenth century that this became a common disguise for fraudulent beggars. Executioners pretended to repent in order to receive permission to beg, and common beggars claimed to be executioners who had given up their post. A Basel ordinance of the</p>

<p>early fifteenth century cataloguing deceptions and disguises used by beggars to elicit alms, described this practice: ‘‘Many were hangmen and then leave it for a year or two and say they want to turn away from sin, and want to do penance . . ., and they fraudulently receive many goods. When they have done this for a while and cheated the people, they become hangmen again.’’ The *Liber Vagatorum * or <em>Book of Vagabonds</em>, a famous piece of rogue literature first published around , used the Basel ordinance as a model and described the deception in similar terms.</p>
<p>Such practices indicate that executioners who stayed in office were seen as hard-hearted and bloodstained sinners. Indeed, discrimination against executioners in church, denying executioners communion altogether, or requiring them to take it last, and to sit or stand separately during services, were relatively frequent in the late middle ages and continued to a lesser degree in the early modern period. As late as  the executioner of Worms required papal dispensation before he was allowed to take communion once a year. In northern Germany it was common in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries for executioners to celebrate marriages and baptisms in their own homes rather than in church.</p>
<p>To what extent did these practices reflect official doctrine? The medieval church had some difficulty developing a consistent policy. The early church opposed capital punishment explicitly and forbade Christians to hold offices that might involve them in the execution of a death sentence, but by the time Christianity became a state religion the church endorsed capital punishment. St. Augustine argued that representatives of public authority were justified in punishing criminals with death. He compared soldiers, judges, and executioners. They killed enemies or criminals, and therefore they did not sin when they killed, nor could they be called murderers. But in spite of this theoretical support for capital punishment, the medieval church did not want its clergy involved personally. Synods of the sixth and seventh centuries forbade clerics from participating in any judicial proceedings that might lead to a death sentence, and they could not attend executions.</p>
<p>By the high middle ages the church developed a clearer position on capital punishment. In  Pope Innocent III decreed that the executioner could carry</p>

<p>out death sentences without committing mortal sin, if he was not motivated by private hatred, but wanted to execute a judgment in the interest of justice. This was not a statement of new doctrine. Innocent III was defending what by then was the traditional position of the church against the Waldensians’ rejection of capital punishment. In the <em>Summa Theologiae</em>, St. Thomas Aquinas justified capital punishment as necessary to preserve the common good. He reiterated St. Augustine’s position that judges who condemned to death, and by implication those who carried out the sentence, were not in a state of sin. The motivations and intentions of the executioner in carrying out the sentence, rather than the act itself, determined his spiritual state. In the Bamberg code it was also the motives of the executioner that determined whether or not he was to be admitted to Holy Communion. The executioner was excluded only if the system of individual payments induced in him an ‘‘evil turbulent lust for spilling human blood.’’ At the same time, rules against clerics being involved in any judicial proceedings that might result in a death sentence were relaxed. Indeed, church investigations led to death penalties against heretics, though clerics were forbidden to administer torture personally during the interrogation. The church continued to delegate the actual sentencing and the execution of the sentence to secular authorities in accordance with the principle *Ecclesia non sitit sanguinem *(the church does not thirst for blood).</p>
<p>According to canon law, the executioner was ‘‘irregular,’’ that is he lacked the qualities considered necessary in a clergyman and was thus unable to receive the sacrament of ordination. He was considered irregular <em>ex defectu perfectae lenitatis</em> (lacking mildness of heart), a defect that affected everyone involved in the trial or sentencing, judge, jurors, prosecutors, and even witnesses of the prosecution. This defect also attached to those who had spilled blood in war, regardless of whether it was a just war or not. However, irregularity remained a construct of church law, and had little impact on social life and status in secular society. Judges were highly placed honorable persons, and military valor conferred the highest honor in medieval and early modern society. Conversely, executioners’ dishonor did not derive from irregularity, though it might have been compounded by it. Irregularity was of little practical consequence to professional executioners, since it is unlikely that many sought to be ordained as priests. This was the only religious disability that derived from the office of executioner according to late medieval and early modern Catholic doctrine.</p>

<p>By the late middle ages, then, there was no official doctrinal justification for the indignities executioners faced in practice. It appears that secular authorities interfered in the affairs of local churches to impose these discriminatory practices. This was certainly the case with the Strasbourg executioner’s ordinance. And yet when the bishop of Wu¨rzburg imposed a penance on the executioner from Ulm, and when the pope granted dispensation allowing the executioner from Worms to take communion, this indicates that in their eyes the executioners had been in a state of sin. Thus, even high church officials did not always follow doctrine. In the late middle ages and at the beginning of the early modern period, the church seemed unsure of its attitude towards the executioner.</p>
<p>The churches of the early modern period developed a more consistent policy.</p>
<p>Mainstream Protestant churches wholeheartedly endorsed capital punishment.</p>
<p>Martin Luther’s full-blooded support for the death penalty is well known. Distinguishing sharply between the godly and worldly realm, Luther argued that true Christians living under the spiritual authority of Christ had no need of temporal authority or the law. The majority of unregenerate mankind, however, would only keep peace under the external constraint of the sword. Luther did not really consider capital punishment as a problem separate from temporal punishment in general. It was only its most extreme example. Following St. Augustine, Luther compared soldiers and executioners and claimed that the ‘‘the sword’’ was a</p>
<p>‘‘Godly estate,’’ a profession which Christians might exercise without sin. Constables, hangmen, jurists, and lawyers could also be ‘‘Christians and in a state of salvation’’ since they provided a ‘‘divine service.’’ If they performed their duties with the intention of upholding the law, they might ‘‘use their office like anybody else would use his trade, as a means of livelihood.’’ Luther went even further, exhorting Christians to take up the temporal sword personally if need be: ‘‘. . . if you see that there is a lack of hangmen, constables, judges, lords, or princes, and you find that you are qualified, you should offer your services and seek the position, that the essential governmental authority may not be despised or become enfeeb-led . . . The world cannot and dare not dispense with it.’’ Calvin took a very similar position, though he more specifically considered the question of how execution of death sentences by secular authorities could be reconciled with the commandment ‘‘Thou shalt not kill.’’ In executing a death sentence the secular authorities were not acting on their own accord, he argued, but merely as God’s</p>

<p>XLV, ed. Walther I. Brandt (Philadelphia, ), pp. , . Although it was a rhetorical device, Luther’s demand that if necessary Christians exercise the office of executioner was quite provocative, considering the dishonorable status of executioners in his society, of which Luther was well aware. In his ‘‘Lectures on Deuteronomy,’’ :, ‘‘You shall appoint judges and officers in all your towns,’’</p>
<p>Luther wrote about executioners, ‘‘At one time the most upright and the worthiest men were chosen for this, but now even the most despised and lowest hold this office.’’ *Luther’s Works, * vol. IX, ed.</p>

<p>representatives on earth. Just as the executioner was absolved of personal responsibility for the death he caused, because he was carrying out the judgment of just authorities, so government itself was acting on God’s commandments. This remained the official position of the Lutheran and Reformed churches for the next centuries. Protestant funeral sermons for executioners, of which several examples from the late seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries have been preserved, make the same argument.</p>
<p>By the early modern period the Catholic and Protestant churches had abandoned any squeamishness about clergymen attending executions. Indeed, clergymen of all confessions played highly visible roles in the theater of public execution, accom-panying the condemned in the procession to the gallows, giving spiritual solace or exhorting the ‘‘poor sinner’’ to repent, climbing the scaffold with the delinquent, holding an execution sermon after the sentence had been carried out. Their spiritual office seems to have insulated them from the dishonor that polluted any other honorable person who became so intimately involved in the execution process or came into actual contact with the condemned and the tools of punishment.</p>
<p>The doctrinal support of Catholic and Protestant churches for capital punishment was unequivocal in the early modern period. Catholic and Protestant authorities agreed that the executioner did not sin when he carried out a death sentence.</p>
<p>He was not in a damned state. Since Protestants abandoned the concept of irregularity, the executioner suffered no religious disability at all in Protestant theology. Even in secular sources, expressions of the intrinsic sinfulness of the executioner, which we saw in urban ordinances and chronicles of the fifteenth and early sixteenth century, are extremely rare in the early modern period. This change was reflected in social practice. Executioners on pilgrimage, such familiar figures in the fifteenth century, disappeared from the early modern landscape. This de-emphasis of the executioner’s sin did not translate into an improvement in his social status, however. In fact the contrary is true. As Ernst Schubert has pointed out, the spiritual stain of sin could be removed by acts of religious penance. But religious exercises had no effect on the social stain of early modern dishonor.</p>
<p>How were executioners and skinners treated in Augsburg’s churches? In the early sixteenth century executioner Caspar Behem was encouraged by ‘‘several honorable gentlemen . . . who no doubt had the good of my soul at heart . . . to abstain from the office of executioner for ever.’’ They convinced him to resign his</p>

<p>post and henceforth earn his living ‘‘piously and honorably’’ as a medical practitioner. Obviously these ‘‘gentlemen’’ and probably Behem himself were of the conviction that the executioner’s office was sinful. However, this is the only statement on the sinfulness of the executioner that I have found in Augsburg sources, and it dates from the first years of the sixteenth century. But even in the sixteenth century such beliefs did not result in discriminatory practices against the executioner and skinner in Augsburg’s churches. They were not excluded from church services; in fact, they were positively required to attend. In  the skinner’s son, Hans Gaisser the Younger, was fined for going for walks during Sunday church services. Marriages, births, and deaths of executioners and skinners were routinely noted in the parish records. There is no indication that they suffered any discrimination. Executioners regularly married and had their children baptized in the cathedral, while skinners attended the chapel of St. Sebastian outside the city walls which was close to their residence. Executioners and skinners did not lack pastoral care. When the skinner’s wife Susanna Hartmann lay on her deathbed in , the midwife summoned a Protestant preacher. The preacher and his sexton drove out to the skinner’s residence and ministered to the dying woman. The preacher treated the skinner himself with the utmost politeness,</p>
<p>‘‘taking off his hat and speaking to him in a friendly manner.’’ In a society that placed much emphasis on external gestures of respect and deference, it was a significant act for a preacher to doff his hat to a skinner.</p>
<p>The problems the Mozart brothers encountered in  when they carried the executioner’s servant Hans Georg Reiser to his grave are indicative of the difficulties that sometimes accompanied the burial of executioners, skinners, and their families. But these were secular concerns involving the practical problem of how to transport the body in a dignified manner and who would risk dishonor by publicly bearing it. There was never any question of denying executioners a Christian burial in consecrated earth – once the body was in the graveyard. The only mention that was ever made of such problems in Augsburg’s parish records involved the Mozart brothers’ conflict. The parish record emphasized that the executioner’s servant had received an honorable burial: ‘‘sepultis fuit honestis vir Joannes Georgius Reiser,</p>
<p>. . . carnifex in servitiis Marci Hartmann, carnificis Augustani.’’ Sometimes the parish records noted special circumstances surrounding a death, as with the</p>

<p>and noted that the boy was buried in the cemetery. When the skinner Stephan Trenkler died in , the parish records noted that last rites were provided on the day of his death, so that ‘‘he died piously.’’</p>
<p>There is some indication that the offspring of dishonorable people, whom artisans attempted to bar from their guilds, were not excluded from spiritual office.</p>
<p>When the master weaver Johann Georg Vogel was expelled from the weavers’ guild for marrying the daughter of a bailiff in , he pointed out that both her brothers held positions in the Catholic church. One was a priest, the other was a deacon.</p>
<p>What was acceptable to the church should be acceptable to the weavers’ guild, and to say otherwise was to show disrespect to the clerical estate. The weavers’ guild was unimpressed with this argument, however, for they knew that the churches did not discriminate against many of the groups whom artisans defined as dishonorable.</p>
<p>Artisans involved in dishonor conflicts did not couch the dispute in religious terms. Protestant artisans could certainly not draw on the teachings of their church to justify their exclusion of dishonorable people, since Luther had repeatedly emphasized that all trades were honorable in the eyes of the Lord, as long as they did not violate religious morality. Indeed, artisans readily acknowledged that dishonor did not result in any impurity of the soul, but then, spiritual equality had no effect on inequality in this world. In their conflict with the fisherman Andreas Anhauser who had married the skinner’s daughter in , his guild argued that nothing could cleanse her of infamy in the material world: ‘‘his bride brought infamy into the world with her birth and . . . no act can elevate her to honors, but she must stay with her own kind until the end, until [she enters] spiritual life.’’</p>
<p>Infamy was seen as a material quality that permeated the physical being of a person</p>
<p>– much like nobility ran in the blood – and determined a person’s condition in this world, but would have no effect in the spiritual world. In  the bookbinders’</p>
<p>guild was involved in a dishonor conflict concerning the apprenticeship of a beadle’s son. The bookbinders quoted the beadle as saying ‘‘In this world I am not an honorable man, . . . but in heaven we are all equal.’’ Clearly, even the artisans did not deny dishonorable people spiritual equality. But conversely, their spiritual equality had no impact on their dishonor in the material world.</p>

<p>CONCLUSION: THE AMBIGUITY OF DISHONOR</p>
<p>This chapter has set out to survey the opinions, feelings, and actions of different social groups – artisans, the urban poor, social and political elites, and religious authorities – towards executioners and skinners. Generally we can conclude that executioners and skinners were not absolute social pariahs. There was little consensus among different estates and classes on the implications of dishonor. Even honorable guildsmen, the social group to whom dishonor seems to have posed the greatest threat and who initiated most dishonor conflicts, did not agree on where the boundary of honor should be drawn. Indeed, this line was at times blurred or invisible, while at other times it was rigidly clear.</p>
<p>Would a patrician have felt tainted or dishonored by social or accidental contact with the executioner or skinner? The evidence is inconclusive. Too few sources reveal the personal emotions of Augsburg’s elites. Governmental proclamations by authorities do indicate, however, that a considerable mental gap separated Augsburg’s patrician governors from their artisanal subjects, and that they regarded the concept of dishonor pollution and the social exclusion of dishonorable people with some skepticism. The relatively liberal policies of Augsburg’s city government towards executioners and skinners, and the fact that they suffered no discrimination in Augsburg’s churches, meant that the legal construct of dishonor was of little practical consequence for executioners and skinners in Augsburg. Of the bundle of legal disabilities that resulted from dishonor according to legal theory, Augsburg’s executioners and skinners suffered only two in practice, exclusion from honorable guilds and citizenship.</p>
<p>The examination of the position of churches towards dishonorable people has shown that by the early modern period dishonor constituted a thoroughly secular phenomenon that operated without sanction in theology or religious practice.</p>
<p>Dishonor was not the creation of either political or religious authorities. Instead, we must look to social structure, to the social characteristics of dishonorable people and of the groups who excluded them, and to the social dynamic between them, in order to explain the phenomenon of dishonor.</p>
