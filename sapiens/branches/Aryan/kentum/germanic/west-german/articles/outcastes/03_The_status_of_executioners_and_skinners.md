–

Who were Augsburg’s dishonorable people? In the previous chapter we have considered under what circumstances contact between executioners and skinners and honorable citizens resulted in dishonor conflicts and under what circumstances they remained unproblematic. This entailed looking at the boundary of honor through the eyes of honorable society. We now change perspective to get an inside view. How did executioners and skinners experience dishonor? How did dishonor affect their legal, social, and economic status in Augsburg? We shall piece together the lives of individual executioners and skinners in the greatest possible detail, in order to reconstruct their social milieu. 

By the early seventeenth century executioners and skinners had established a hereditary professional caste. One defining feature of this caste was a high degree of social endogamy. This endogamous marriage pattern has been well documented by the folklorists and historians who have studied dishonor. In contrast to artisans and other commoners who tended to marry locally, executioners and skinners often looked beyond their own locality to find marriage partners. Since there were usually only a small number of executioners’ and skinners’ children living in one city, they formed geographically extensive marriage networks. This peculiar marriage pattern has led one historian to compare the genealogical structure of executioners’

dynasties with that of the aristocracy.

It is commonplace in the literature on dishonor to interpret this marriage pattern as a result of the social exclusion which executioners and skinners suffered at the hands of honorable society. The social fact of dishonor made it all but impossible for an executioner’s daughter to choose a marriage partner from outside the dishonorable milieu or for a son to leave his father’s profession. This is certainly

*The dishonorable milieu*

correct. The marriage of the young fisherman Andreas Anhauser with the skinner’s daughter clearly illustrates the social disaster that would befall an artisan who married across the boundary of honor. It is misleading, however, to attribute executioners’ and skinners’ endogamous marriage pattern and the transfer of executioners’ and skinners’ positions by inheritance *only * to external coercion. In addition to the constraints placed on executioners and skinners by honorable society there were strong pressures from within executioners’ castes that encouraged endogamy. Moreover, honorable society provided executioners and skinners with various perquisites that partly compensated for their low social status and made their position bearable, indeed advantageous. Coercive measures were accompanied by social incentives that could induce executioners’ and skinners’

children to *choose * to remain within the profession. The boundary of honor was not maintained for over two centuries by force alone.

When did Augsburg’s executioners and skinners form a professional caste? How far back in time can their distinctive marriage pattern be traced? The boundary of honor was not fixed and unchanging in  and dishonorable people did not form a static social entity. The importance of external constraints, internal pressures, and social incentives in the formation and maintenance of the dishonorable milieu varied over the centuries. In this chapter, we will follow Augsburg’s executioners, skinners, and their families and servants over two centuries to show when dishonor became significant as a social distinction and when the dishonorable social milieu became consolidated. 

Before the s only fragmentary evidence is available on Augsburg’s executioners and skinners. In isolated sources from the fourteenth and the early sixteenth centuries executioners appear violent and disorderly. In  ‘‘Master Hans from No¨rdlingen who was executioner here and his wife Ruehin’’ were banished from the city because they had violently attacked ‘‘Hans from Kolmar who is now executioner here’’ and robbed him of two gulden. Executioners were also victims of violence. In  a man was banished for wounding the executioner within the city, and in  two men pursued the executioner with the intention of beating him to death, until the executioner fled to safety on the property of a city council member. 

In  Augsburg’s executioner lodged a mercenary soldier, a sick beggar, and a foreign executioner in his home. When the foreign executioner began a brawl with the soldier, Augsburg’s executioner intervened and slit the throat of the foreign executioner. The city council decided that he had acted in self-defense and ordered him to bury the body of the foreign executioner beneath the gallows.

Tax records and other scattered sources reveal a high turnover of skinners and

 For a similar argument, see Giesela Wilbertz, *Scharfrichter*, pp. –. Wilbertz argues that the formation of executioners’ clans in north Germany was the result of self-recruitment and choice.

*Executioners and skinners*

executioners in the late fifteenth and early sixteenth century. In  a skinner was fired for disobedience. He was replaced by Simprecht Scheifelhut, who is listed in the tax records between  and . The skinner’s residence lay in the tax district *Undern Vischern *\(‘‘among the fishermen’’\) immediately outside the city walls. In  Scheifelhut’s immediate neighbor was a Margaretha Scheifelhut who moved into the skinner’s household the following year, and in , Wolf Scheifelhut, a fisherman, lived three houses away. It is possible that Simprecht and Wolf were related; indeed this appears likely because the skinner, like the fisherman, was listed as a citizen, an indication that he was from a local family. Several members of the Scheifelhut family were represented among Augsburg’s fishermen for the next centuries. If the skinner Scheifelhut was recruited from this local fishermen’s clan, this would suggest that the boundary separating skinners from lowly commoners was still permeable. Perhaps it was still possible at this time to move in and out of a skinner’s post and not be permanently stigmatized. 

In the tax records of , Hans Bair appeared as skinner along with his servant Hans Kopp. A year later Bair was succeeded by another member of the Scheifelhut family. The tax records list Hans Scheifelhut and the servant Hans Kopp until

, when Kopp took over the position. Hans Kopp was employed until , when he was replaced by Christoph Mair, who held the position for two years. In

 Mair employed a Marx Scheifelhut as a servant. Clas Preining who succeeded Mair in  was employed for only one year. In  the tax records list a Christoph Gassner as skinner together with his servant Hans Gaisser. Hans Gaisser took over the position in .

The turnover among executioners was equally rapid. In  the city council protocols record that ‘‘Symon, executioner’’ from Jungersheim, a Swabian village, was hired ‘‘on a trial basis.’’ Valentin Scholz served as executioner sometime before

. In an undated petition Scholz pleaded with the magistrate not to fire him for attempting to sell his post to a foreign applicant for ten gulden. In  the city council ordered an executioner Franz Wagner to be careful when he emptied the latrines and not spill the contents in the streets. It is not clear how long Wagner had been employed before this date since the tax records of the early sixteenth century only list ‘‘the house of the executioner.’’ In  the tax records listed the executioner by name for the first time. ‘‘Master Franz’’ was listed from  until

. In  Master Franz was replaced by Peter Ramer. Master Peter was employed for only three years. He was hired from the neighboring free imperial city

*The dishonorable milieu*

of No¨rdlingen in  and was fired in . In that year Caspar Behem, an executioner who had been employed by Augsburg before , reapplied for the position. In  the council turned him down and hired Veit Stolz as master executioner instead.

Most of these executioners were ‘‘foreigners,’’ that is they were not citizens of Augsburg. Symon was from the Swabian village of Jungersheim. Valentin Scholz was apparently a stranger in Augsburg, since he excused misbehavior by saying that he was not familiar with local customs. Caspar Behem was from Aichstet, a small Swabian town, and had served previously in the neighboring free imperial city of Kaufbeuren. Meister Peter Ramer was hired from Kaufbeuren as well. Two of the skinners, Simprecht Scheifelhut and Hans Scheifelhut, were probably members of the local Scheifelhut fishermen’s family. 

The evidence points to a rapid turnover rate in these two dishonorable profes-sions. From  to , Augsburg employed at least seven skinners. On average the skinner’s position changed hands almost every five years. Since the tax records do not name the skinner between  and , it is unclear how many others were employed in these years. These skinners were casual labor who filled the post for a while and then were fired or quit to do some other job. In the case of the three Scheifelhuts, two skinners and one servant, it appears that local fishermen were hired to fill the post. Similarly, from  to  at least six executioners were employed in Augsburg. The sources do not show how many more were employed before  when the tax records listed only ‘‘the house of the executioner.’’ In this period the executioner’s post changed hands at least every six years. At least two of the incumbents were fired and one resigned. Such ‘‘unprofessional’’ behavior and the rapid turnover in the early sixteenth century is an indication that a skinners’ and executioners’ caste had not yet established itself. The executioners of these years were not committed ‘‘professionals,’’ as their successors in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries would become. The instability of these early years contrasts with the long tenures of executioners and skinners in the late sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, when individual skinners and executioners often held the position for twenty or thirty years, as we shall see below. 

Hans Gaisser was the first skinner who was employed for a significant period of time. He served as skinner for thirteen years, from  until . His tenure was not free of disturbances, however. He was arrested frequently for drunkenness, barroom brawls, and debt. He died in  and his son, Hans Gaisser the Younger,

*Executioners and skinners*

succeeded him as skinner. It appears that the younger Gaisser accepted the skinner’s position only as a last resort, after efforts to choose another profession had failed. In  one of the skinner’s sons, probably Hans Gaisser the Younger, became involved in a dishonor conflict so serious that it almost provoked a riot. A chronicle entry from that year recorded that a master weaver had accepted the skinner’s son as an apprentice:

But when the journeymen heard of this they did not want to tolerate it and banded together in gangs in the upper and lower city. My lords the mayors and an honorable council spoke of this in great earnestness, and they unanimously decided that the honorable weavers’ guild should not be burdened with the skinner’s son, but he should be excluded once and for all.

This outcome is not surprising. What is surprising is that he tried to join a guild at all. No further such attempt by a skinner’s or executioner’s son was made to enter an honorable guild before the eighteenth century. In the later sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, all dishonor conflicts caused by dishonorable people trying to enter honorable guilds involved shepherds, beadles, and others who were dishonorable to a lesser degree, but not skinners and executioners at the center of dishonor. In these centuries, skinners’ and executioners’ sons usually succeeded their fathers in office or, failing that, joined the growing ranks of the vagrant poor. 

They did not join honorable guilds.

The boundary of honor that separated dishonorable people from honorable society was not yet clearly established in , but it fast was becoming so. The attempt of the skinner’s son to change his status and his profession shows that the Gaisser family did not yet see itself as part of a professional caste, nor did the younger Gaisser or the master who employed him understand the social force the stigma of dishonor had acquired by this time. In , after he had been employed for ten years, Gaisser was again confronted with the contagious power of his dishonor, when three master rope-makers were boycotted by their guild because they had entered the skinner’s home.

Hans Gaisser the Younger was employed as skinner for thirteen years, until

. His conduct was just as disorderly as his father’s. He was arrested on numerous occasions for drunkenness and violence. Finally, in , after being arrested for beating his wife and threatening to set the house on fire, Hans Gaisser escaped from prison and fled Augsburg, whereupon the city hired Hans’s brother,

*The dishonorable milieu*

Barthlme Gaisser, as skinner. Barthlme was employed until . In  Barthlme was involved in an affair with his serving maid. The city council was unwilling to tolerate this adulterous affair and ordered that ‘‘he should no longer live in dishonor, as he had been, but he should live honorably.’’ In other words, the council expected ‘‘honorable,’’ i.e., morally respectable behavior from their legally dishonorable servant. In the council’s view, Barthlme’s legal infamy did not release him from normal moral precepts. In that same year Barthlme was fired for pulling a knife on city guards. Although by this time the Gaissers had filled the skinner’s post for thirty-seven years, after this incident the council was fed up with the unruly clan. Barthlme and his wife were banished from the city.

In  Veit Stolz was hired as executioner. With Master Veit a measure of stability set in. Stolz was morally respectable and professionally responsible, serving as executioner for twenty-eight years. He represented a new kind of executioner typical of the later period. In the later sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, Augsburg’s executioners and skinners were a remarkably orderly and law-abiding group. The stereotype of the ‘‘hanged hangman’’ one finds in the secondary literature on dishonorable people does not reflect social reality in late sixteenth-and seventeenth-century Augsburg. From the late sixteenth century on executioners and skinners rarely appear in Augsburg’s criminal records. Accordingly, Master Veit is mentioned only in less colorful sources, the city council protocols and guardianship records. However, these guardianship records are the first sources that make it possible to reconstruct the familial relationships of an executioner. Stolz died in . The guardianship records of that year detail the property settlements following his death. When Stolz died, his wife Margaretha made up a will of her own. The will shows that Margaretha had a sister, Barbara Kimicher, who had been married to a weaver, Endres Kel. Stolz had apparently married a woman from a local artisanal family, rather than marrying an executioner’s daughter from another city, as seventeenth-century executioners invariably did. That Stolz was enmeshed in a social network with local artisans is further illustrated by his wife’s testament. Margaretha left her property to her and Veit’s adopted daughter, Elizabeth Truckenmu

¨ ller. Casper Bez, a barber-surgeon, Hans

Ludwig, a goldsmith, and Conrad Ettlin, a glazier, were appointed as executors of the testament. The goldsmith and the glazier were members of prestigious guilds. These artisans were perhaps acquaintances and friends of the Kimichers, Margaretha’s family of origin. Though Margaretha married an executioner she was not cut off from the normal familial and artisanal support

*Executioners and skinners*

networks. So Veit Stolz’s familial and social relationships do not yet exhibit the characteristics typical of professional executioners’ castes in the late sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. 

When the council hired the executioner Hans Deibler in  and the skinner Martin Leichnam in , a new pattern emerged. Deibler and Leichnam were members of established executioners’ and skinners’ clans. Hans Deibler served as executioner for  to , when he was succeeded by his son Michael who filled the executioner’s post until . The Deiblers were members of a large south German executioners’ clan. While Hans Deibler was employed as executioner in Augsburg, another Hans Deibler served as executioner in Memmingen in  and was succeeded by Jacob Deibler in . During the tenure of Michael Deibler, Hans’s son, other members of the Deibler clan were employed as executioners in Memmingen, Donauwo¨rth, Landshut and Rothenburg ob der Tauber. At this time, however, the Deiblers did not yet practice an absolute social endogamy. 

Michael Deibler was twenty years old when he succeeded his father Hans in . 

He married that same year. The property settlements made after Michael Deibler’s death in  shed light on his familial and social relationships. His widow was Sabina Scheibenhart and her guardians were Hans Scheibenhart, a stonemason, and Melchior Mayr, a weaver. In  one of Sabina Scheibenhart’s relatives, the widow of a Jacob Scheibenhart, shared the executioner’s house. Like Veit Stolz, Michael Deibler was enmeshed in a social network with local artisans. 

By the time Michael Deibler resigned in  after thirty years of service, the endogamous marriage pattern was more clearly established. Deibler’s successor acquired the executioner’s post by marriage, just as a journeyman might acquire a master’s workshop by marrying a master’s daughter in the artisanal milieu. In 

Deibler petitioned the council to hire an assistant for him, since he was too old to do the job alone. Deibler requested that the council hire his ‘‘cousin’’ Dietrich Metz from Weißenhorn, a small town near Ulm. Deibler described Metz as ‘‘my sister’s son,’’ so Metz was in fact Deibler’s nephew, but by the seventeenth century executioners generally referred to each other as ‘‘cousins’’ regardless of the degree to which they were actually related, or even if they happened to be unrelated. In

 Bartholomaüs Deubler served as executioner in Memmingen from  to . Marx Deubler was executioner in Donauwo¨rth in . Another Marx Deubler, presumably his son, was executioner there from  to , when he resigned his post. See Glenzdorf and Treichel, *Henker*, vol. II, p. .

*The dishonorable milieu*

 Metz married Deibler’s daughter Barbara. So Dietrich Metz really did marry his cousin, an illustration of how intertwined executioners’ clans had become by the early seventeenth century. In  Metz officially succeeded his father-in-law.

The social network of executioners is revealed not only in their choice of marriage partners, but also in who served as ‘‘guarantors’’ for these marriages. 

Since  the city government required couples who intended to marry to have guarantors who vouched for the financial viability of the marriage and guaranteed that the couple would not apply for welfare for several years following the marriage. 

If the couple did go on welfare, the guarantors were liable for the payments. To examine who served as guarantor for whom helps make social support networks visible which would otherwise remain undetectable to the historian. At the marriage of Dietrich Metz and Barbara Deibler the guarantors were Michael Deibler, her father, and a Balthasar Geiger. The marriage protocols list Balthasar Geiger as a weaver, but by this date Geiger served as ‘‘night-king,’’ i.e. the chief latrine-cleaner, and shared the executioner’s residence for three years, as had Georg Geiger \(his father?\) before him. It is not clear whether Balthasar Geiger was still working as a weaver during his tenure as ‘‘night-king.’’ In any case, Geiger was not a typical artisan. The relationship between Geiger and the executioner’s family was based on professional cooperation and neighborly relations. 

When the retired executioner Michael Deibler died in , his widow Sabina Scheibenhart remarried. One year after her husband’s death, she married Georg Leichnam, one of the sons of the late skinner Martin Leichnam. Georg Leichnam was now a widower and executioner in the neighboring free imperial city of No¨rdlingen. A decree concerning this marriage raises the question of the relationship between dishonor and illegitimacy. In order to receive permission to marry, Georg Leichnam had to present witnesses who could confirm that he was of legitimate birth. These witnesses would be questioned under oath and then the authorities would provide Leichnam with an official document that certified his legitimacy. This was regular bureaucratic procedure that all couples who planned to marry had to undergo. Those born locally usually presented witnesses who had been present at their parents’ wedding. These witnesses had attended the parents’

wedding procession and could confirm that they had gone publicly ‘‘to church and street’’ before the birth of their child. If the bride wore a traditional wreath in the wedding procession, this was an affirmation of her virginity at the time of marriage.

*Executioners and skinners*

Out-of-towners presented official birth certificates issued by their local authorities. In Georg Leichnam’s case the certificate of his legitimate birth was preserved. We can assume that most other members of Augsburg’s executioner and skinner families underwent the same procedure. There is no indication that the authorities varied the bureaucratic procedure in any way when they were dealing with dishonorable people. This would not have been necessary because all of the children born in Augsburg’s executioners and skinners families appear to have been legitimate. I have not found a single case of illegitimacy among Augsburg’s executioners and skinners in three centuries. There was little correlation between dishonor \( *Unehrlichkeit*\) and illegitimacy \( *Unehelichkeit*\). Dishonorable people and bastards were socially distinct groups. Though artisans tended to associate legal dishonor and illegitimacy, and indeed often used the term *unehrlich * as a synonym for *unehelich*, the artisans’ perception bore little relation to social reality. Augsburg’s executioners and skinners were subject to and practiced the same precepts of sexual morality as honorable citizens.

After Georg Leichnam received his decree of legitimacy his wedding with Sabina Scheibenhart could proceed. Their guarantors were her relative Hans Scheibenhart, a weaver, and Michael Leichnam, Georg’s brother, who was the current skinner in Augsburg. Sabina Scheibenhart, though she was of artisanal background herself, married into another executioners’ clan instead of remarrying within the artisanal milieu. When Michael Deibler and Sabina Scheibenhart married in  it was still possible for an executioner to marry a woman from an artisanal family. By  it would have been unthinkable for an artisan to marry an executioner’s widow. Sabina Scheibenhart had become fully absorbed into the dishonorable milieu. Likewise, other members of the Scheibenhart family remained associated with Augsburg’s executioners. In  a Hans Scheibenhart was hired as ‘‘night-king’’ and moved into the executioner’s residence. Hans Scheibenhart was listed as ‘‘night-king’’ in the executioner’s house until .

The Leichnam clan occupied the Augsburg skinner’s post for two generations. 

Martin Leichnam served as skinner for almost fifty years from  until his death

*The dishonorable milieu*

in , when he was replaced by his son Michael Leichnam. The Leichnams were clearly part of the professional caste of executioners and skinners. Here *nomen* *est omen*: as we saw earlier the German word *Leichnam * translates as ‘‘corpse.’’ The name derived from the materials with which this family worked, an indication that by the late sixteenth century skinners formed a hereditary professional group. In

 one of the Leichnam sons married the daughter of Hans Stadler, who became executioner in Munich in . In  a Christoph Leichnam was employed as skinner in Munich, in  a Hans Leichnam was executioner in the neighboring imperial city of Kaufbeuren, and in  a Dietrich Leichnam was employed as executioner in the Bavarian city of Landshut. Michael Leichnam was eighteen when he succeeded his father in . That same year he married Maria Bab, an executioner’s daughter from Munich. Michael Deibler, the retired executioner, served as their guarantor. And, as we saw above, Michael’s brother Georg married the executioner Michael Deibler’s widow, Sabina Scheibenhart, in .

The disastrous marriage of Michael Leichnam’s daughter Barbara to the young fisherman Andreas Anhauser in  illustrates to what extent the social endogamy of skinners was enforced by negative social sanctions by the mid-seventeenth century – from within and without. The fishermen expelled Andreas from their guild, and the skinner Michael Leichnam turned his daughter out of the house and had her imprisoned. He was not present at the wedding. If the fishermen were unwilling to accept Barbara Leichnam into their guild after the marriage, Augsburg’s skinner Michael Leichnam and executioner Dietrich Metz were no less unwilling to accept Andreas Anhauser within their craft. Andreas, so the fishermen claimed, approached Master Dietrich and asked for a certificate, ‘‘so that he would be accepted among executioners, and could do an apprenticeship of three years in another place,’’ but Master Dietrich refused because ‘‘the executioners and skinners do not want to take him in.’’ Regardless of whether the fishermen’s claim was true or whether it was libel intended to discredit Anhauser even further, the slur reflected the reality that executioners formed a skilled trade which required professional training. Upon completing their training, apprentice executioners did a ‘‘master piece,’’ a beheading with the sword. If the execution went well, the young executioner was addressed as ‘‘Master.’’ No unskilled individual who became dishonorable by chance or choice could easily be integrated into this professional

*Executioners and skinners*

group. Paradoxical as it may seem, by the mid-seventeenth century this core group among the dishonorable formed a socially exclusive caste. 

Marx Philipp Hartmann, a skinner’s son from Ulm, became executioner in Augsburg in . Like his predecessor Dietrich Metz, Hartmann acquired the position by marriage. Hartmann married Master Dietrich’s daughter Maria in

. Master Dietrich and the skinner Michael Leichnam served as guarantors. 

Johannes Scheibenhart, the ‘‘night-king,’’ was one of the witnesses at the wedding ceremony in the cathedral. When Metz retired after serving as executioner for thirty-one years, Hartmann succeeded him as master executioner. During Hartmann’s tenure as executioner in Augsburg, other members of the Hartmann clan were employed as skinners in the Swabian villages of Langenau and Geislingen and as executioner in Weißenhorn.

When the skinner Michael Leichnam died in , Michael’s oldest son Martin expected to succeed his father in the skinner’s post. Ten weeks before his father’s death, Martin had successfully completed his master piece with the sword, so that he would be better qualified to assist Master Marx in criminal executions. But at this juncture the city government decided to apply the principle of confessional parity to the positions of executioner and skinner as to all other public positions. 

The principle of parity between Catholics and Protestants in all public offices had been introduced with the Peace of Westphalia in , when Augsburg’s constitution had been reformed to guarantee confessional balance in government and administration. In  the council decreed that the skinner’s post should alternate between Catholics and Protestants. Since the Leichnam family was Catholic, they were ordered to vacate the skinner’s post. The Leichnam sons protested and were supported by Catholic administrators who pointed out that when parity had been introduced the offices of executioner and skinner as ‘‘dishonorable trades’’ had been left unchanged. But the council was determined to apply the principle of parity systematically. According to the agreement worked out between Catholic and Protestant administrators, the executioner would always be Catholic, the ‘‘night-king’’ who shared his residence would always be Protestant, and the skinner’s post would alternate between Catholics and Protestants. In , the Catholic Leichnam family had to go and the Protestant skinner Johann Scheppelin from Memmingen was hired. The Leichnam brothers managed to find employment as skinners in the neighboring Habsburg territory of the margravate of Burgau.

*The dishonorable milieu*

This rigorous application of parity meant that a single family could no longer fill the skinner’s post for more than a generation, contrary to the pattern which had emerged with the Gaisser family and was clearly established during the tenure of the Leichnams. By  the Leichnam family had served as Augsburg skinners for sixty-nine years and they considered the post a possession of their family. They were sorely disappointed when they lost the position and were ordered to vacate the premises within fourteen days. By contrast, the executioner’s post still could be handed down within the same family, since executioners remained consistently Catholic. 

The Protestant skinner, Johann Scheppelin, whom the council hired to replace the Leichnams, was the son of Master Georg Scheppelin who had served as executioner in Memmingen for the past seventeen years. Scheppelin emphasized in his job application that he had done his ‘‘master piece with the sword’’ and so could assist at executions if need be. He was trained by his father in Memmingen and also wandered ‘‘in the empire.’’ So it appears that executioners, like artisans, completed a period of ‘‘journeymanship.’’ Shortly after Scheppelin was hired, he married Master Marx’s sister, Susanna Hartmann. This is remarkable, because Hartmann had been hostile towards Scheppelin from the beginning. Hartmann had a long-standing relationship with the Leichnam family. When the Leichnam brothers were being ousted from the skinner’s position, Hartmann petitioned the council on their behalf and opposed Scheppelin’s hiring. But regardless of any personal animosities between Hartmann and Scheppelin, the wedding between Scheppelin and Hartmann’s sister took place. For the unmarried skinner to marry the executioner’s unmarried sister was an obvious match. Perhaps such a marriage had long been planned between Susanna and the young Martin Leichnam for the time when he succeeded his father Michael in the skinner’s post. If this was so, Scheppelin took Martin Leichnam’s place when the Leichnams were ousted – as skinner and as bridegroom. 

There was an obstacle to this wedding, however. The Hartmann family was Catholic, and Scheppelin, as we have seen, was Protestant. In the second half of the sixteenth century and until the early years of the Thirty Years’ War mixed marriages between Catholics and Protestants were not unusual, but this had changed by the s. Confessional boundaries hardened under the influence of political events like the Catholic ‘‘Restitution’’ of  or the Swedish occupation in –, when Catholics and Protestants respectively subjected the opposing group to severe discrimination. Though confessional conflicts on the political level

*Executioners and skinners*

ended with the introduction of the constitutional system of parity, the ‘‘confessionalization’’ of society and culture continued through the seventeenth century, so that Catholics and Protestants formed two separate camps within the city. In this environment ‘‘mixed marriages’’ between Catholics and Protestants, while officially permitted, were frowned upon. Confessional intermarriage in the later seventeenth and the eighteenth century was extremely rare. According to Etienne Franc¸ois, who has studied Augsburg’s system of parity and the process of ‘‘confessionalization’’ in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, ‘‘the complete rejection of mixed marriages was internalized and formed a taboo which could not be transgressed,’’ in Augsburg even more so than in the rest of Germany.

In the case of a marriage between a skinner and an executioner’s sister, however, social pressures to marry within their own milieu were more compelling than cultural prohibitions to transgress the confessional boundary. The couple did

‘‘normalize’’ their ‘‘unequal marriage,’’ as contemporaries called interconfessional marriages, by religious conversion. Since the skinner was required to be Protestant, Susanna Hartmann converted and joined her husband in the *Confessio August-ana*. That social pressure to marry within one’s own confession was secondary to the pressure for executioners’ and skinners’ clans to intermarry is further illustrated in Susanna Hartmann’s own tragic fate. Susanna’s marriage with Johann Scheppelin lasted for twelve years, until his death in . During their marriage, they had at least five children, whom they raised as Protestants. After Scheppelin’s death, the city council set out to hire a new skinner, strictly applying the rule of parity. After the Protestant Scheppelin the position had to be filled by a Catholic. 

The magistrate hired Johann Jacob Scheller, a twenty-three-year-old skinner from the neighboring village of Ziemetshausen and a Catholic. Later that same year Susanna married the new skinner. Again, the skinner’s post seems to have been transferred through marriage, much as a young journeyman could acquire an artisanal workshop by marrying the widow of an artisan. In this way the older widow and her children would be cared for; at least this was the intention. In order to ‘‘normalize’’ this mixed marriage, Susanna converted a second time and returned to her original Catholic faith.

Susanna had grown accustomed to the Protestant confession during her twelve-year marriage with Scheppelin, however. When she became pregnant within a year of her marriage with Scheller, complications developed and it became clear that she was dying. On her deathbed, Susanna preferred the solace of Lutheranism and

*The dishonorable milieu*

asked the attending midwife to fetch a Lutheran minister. But the skinner forbade it, fearing for his post should Susanna leave the Catholic faith. As his wife lay dying, Scheller went to town to request instructions from the Catholic mayor, who ordered him to bring a Franciscan friar to console his wife and to convince her to remain Catholic. In the meantime, the midwife informed the Protestant mayor of the situation, who ordered a bailiff to escort a Lutheran minister, his sexton, and the midwife back out to the skinner’s residence. Scheller returned home alone – no Franciscans were available – only to find the Protestant clergyman ministering to his wife. After the clerics, the midwife, and the bailiff left, Scheller vented his rage on his wife, saying ‘‘if he did not want to spare the child in her belly, he would stab her to death.’’ Shortly thereafter Susanna died.

Close kinship relations among both skinners and executioners continued in the following generation. Marx Philipp Hartmann was employed as executioner until

. In that year, after twenty-nine years of service, he resigned his position and was succeeded by his brother, Mathes Hartmann. Mathes had served as executioner in the neighboring city of Donauwo¨rth at least since . Mathes was employed in Augsburg for only six years, from  to , when he contracted a hernia while swinging the sword during the beheading of three witches and was no longer capable of carrying out the executioner’s duties. Mathes’s son Johann Adam Hartmann, who had also been serving as executioner in Donauwo¨rth, replaced his father in the executioner’s post in .

When Johann Adam resigned in , the skinner Johann Jacob Scheller petitioned the council on behalf of his twenty-one-year-old son, Johann Scheller the Younger, asking that the magistrate consider the skinner’s thirty years of service and hire his son as executioner. Johann was well qualified, as his ‘‘master letter’’

attested. He had trained with his ‘‘cousin’’ Johann Michel Fahner, executioner in Pfaffenhoven in Bavaria. As his masterpiece, he had ‘‘beheaded a malefactor before a large audience with one manly and masterly stroke of the sword.’’ The authorities were satisfied and hired young Scheller. While the rule of parity precluded that a skinner’s son would inherit the skinner’s post from his father, a Catholic skinner’s son could fill the executioner’s post, as happened in this case. For the first time the same family filled both the skinner’s and the executioner’s post.

These biographical sketches have illustrated the formation of a professional executioners’ and skinners’ caste. Executioners and skinners continued to intermarry through the eighteenth century. In Augsburg this endogamous marriage

*Executioners and skinners*

pattern emerged in the late sixteenth and early seventeenth century. The consolidation of the dishonorable milieu and the hardening of the boundary of honor were two sides of the same coin. Social restraints and pressures that resulted from dishonor seem to have first been imposed on executioners and skinners by honorable society in the mid-sixteenth century and to have become more pronounced as the century progressed. After mid-century all of Augsburg’s executioners and skinners had to face their dishonor at one point or another. The skinner Hans Gaisser the Younger, as we saw, had run-ins with the weavers’ guild in  and with the rope-makers in . In  Augsburg’s bathhouse-keepers appear to have attempted to bar the executioner Veit Stolz from using the public baths. The firing of skinner Barthlme Gaisser in  was provoked by a dishonor conflict. In a drunken spree he had demanded that city guards catch a stray dog for him. Since such a task fell within the skinner’s duties, anyone else who did it would have risked dishonor. When the guards refused, saying that they did not want to intrude in his craft, Barthlme attacked them with a knife. In  the skinner Hans Merklin precipitated a dishonor conflict by insisting that the master weaver Hans Seidler share a drink with him. When Seidler’s guild learned of this, they closed down his shop. In  the city government penalized executioner Lemler for defending himself against rock-throwing journeymen. In  the stonemason Thomas Biberer was punished by his guild for riding on the skinner’s cart together with the skinner Michael Leichnam. In , Barbara Metz, the wife of the executioner Dietrich Metz, had to face her dishonor when sociability with the military preacher had disastrous consequences for both the preacher and her host Georg Schmidt. In

 Michael Leichnam was embroiled in the tragic conflict involving the marriage of his daughter Barbara to the young fisherman Andreas Anhauser. In  the executioner Marx Philipp Hartmann was confronted with his dishonor when the Mozart brothers were declared dishonorable for carrying Hartmann’s servant to his grave.

Executioners and skinners even chose to emphasize their own dishonor when it was to their advantage to do so. In  the skinner Johann Jacob Scheller emphasized his own dishonor to further his economic interests. It fell within the rights of the skinner to confiscate diseased livestock. This brought skinners into frequent conflict with the butchers. Skinners inspected the cattle herds owned by the butchers and tried to confiscate animals which the butchers claimed were perfectly healthy. In one such conflict, Scheller used his dishonor in order to force the butchers to concede. He emphasized that slaughtering and skinning diseased animals was completely inappropriate for honorable artisans. He drove home this point by threatening to stick his skinner’s knife into the doorpost of any butcher

who continued to infringe upon his economic monopoly. This was a powerful threat since the skinner’s knife was an infamous object permeated by the skinner’s dishonor. Sticking the skinner’s knife into a doorpost was a conditional ritual insult, a form of honor blackmail, which skinners traditionally used to enforce their demands. If the skinner’s opponent touched the skinner’s knife and removed it from his doorpost himself, the infamy of the skinner’s knife would leave a taint on his honor. The victim of such blackmail really had no choice but to accede to the skinners’ demands. Then the skinner would remove his knife from the doorpost himself, leaving his victim’s honor intact. In this way dishonorable people could manipulate their dishonor to their economic advantage. 

Most dishonor conflicts involving executioners and skinners were concentrated in the second half of the sixteenth century, which indicates that the social distinction of dishonor was gaining greater force at this time and the boundary of honor was being established. In the seventeenth century there were noticeably fewer cases of this kind, which suggests that certain conventions and routines had been worked out which regulated the interaction of executioners and skinners with honorable citizens. A *modus vivendi * had been established which minimized conflicts. Indeed, the most costly dishonor conflicts in the seventeenth century involved other groups who were dishonorable to a lesser degree, for instance the bailiffs, with whom such social conventions had not been established.

The marginalization of executioners and skinners after the mid-sixteenth century is reflected in the social topography of the city. From at least  on, the executioner’s residence lay in the alley *In des Bartshof * near the *Go¨gginger Tor*, one of the major city gates, and in the immediate vicinity of the municipal brothel, which was closed down in  as the Reformation took hold. We can only speculate whether this proximity of the executioner’s residence and the brothel means that the executioner in the early sixteenth century was still observing his old duties as municipal supervisor of Augsburg’s public prostitutes, as the civic code of  had described. The proximity of the brothel to the executioner’s residence seems to indicate the low social status of the executioner. However, the fact that both of these houses were located in a heavily populated part of the city, next to a major city gate and the imperial highway, suggests that neither executioner nor prostitutes were as marginalized in the late middle ages and the first years of the sixteenth century as they would become in the course of the early modern period. 

The executioner continued to live at this location until , when the city purchased a house *in der Ko¨chin Gessle * in the St. Jacob’s suburb. The

*Executioners and skinners*

suburbof St. Jacob’s was the poorest quarter of the city but still lay within the city walls. In  the executioner’s residence was moved to a new location for the last time. The executioner now lived in *Undern Weschen*, also in the St. Jacob’s suburb. 

The building was city property and had previously served as a hospice, for it is listed in the tax records as *Brechhaus*. This building was then converted to a new use as executioner’s residence. In this new residence executioner and ‘‘night-king,’’

the chief latrine-cleaner with whom he shared the building, had few immediate neighbors. Surrounded by grounds where wood and tallow were stored, in the immediate vicinity of the hospice for syphilitics, the house lay just within the city walls. In this semi-rural neighborhood the alleyways remained unpaved. This was the most impoverished section of the generally poor St. Jacob’s suburb. The residence of the executioner and ‘‘night-king’’ remained at this location until at least . The skinner, by contrast, lived outside the city walls. His residence lay in *Undern Vischern *\(‘‘among the fishermen’’\) immediately beyond the walls, where it remained until the early seventeenth century. In  the skinner’s residence was moved to the tax district *Ausserhalb St. Gallen, iezo Stephinger Tor. * The skinner now lived about a mile from the city wall, isolated from any neighbors. Here the skinner’s residence remained through the eighteenth century. 

The consolidation of *Unehrlichkeit * was also mirrored in the legal status of executioners and skinners in the commune. In the late fifteenth and the early years of the sixteenth century executioners and skinners sometimes were listed as citizens and sometimes paid the basic citizen’s head tax. Thus the skinner Simprecht Scheifelhut who was employed in the last years of the fifteenth century was a citizen, as was the executioner Meister Franz who was named in the tax records from  through . The administrative practice of placing executioners and skinners in a kind of legal limbo in which they were classified neither as citizens nor residents developed in the s and had become the customary practice by the mid-sixteenth century. To be denied citizenship was clearly a significant and symbolic form of discrimination. While citizens had to bear certain civic burdens –

most importantly taxes – the relationship between citizenry and the city government was reciprocal. Fully incorporated in the commune, each citizen benefited from the political and legal protection of the city. Citizenship was not only a legal category; it also conferred higher social status in the commune. Conversely, that executioners and skinners were denied citizenship meant that the city government

*The dishonorable milieu*

and the commune had no obligations towards them. As outsiders they could be discarded at any time. They had no right to remain in the city after their employment ended. It lay in the discretion of the city government whether to grant retired executioners or skinners a residency permit or not. This is illustrated by an entry in the marriage protocols which recorded the marriage of the skinner Michael Leichnam in : ‘‘They will move away \[from Augsburg\] after the end of their service. They have sworn an oath to this effect . . .’’ In practice the city government always did allow retired executioners and skinners to remain within the city, so that the denial of citizenship had no actual negative consequences for executioners and skinners. But as this entry in the marriage protocols makes clear, the permission to stay in the city was a mercy the magistrate was free to grant, not a right that could be demanded. Of little practical consequence to executioners and skinners, the denial of citizenship was a symbolic reminder of their outsider status. 

It is clear, then, that negative social sanctions and pressures exerted on executioners and skinners by honorable society contributed significantly to the consolidation of the dishonorable milieu. But the formation of a professional executioners’ and skinners’ caste did not result *only * from coercion. Certainly it was not exceptional in early modern society for a son to follow in his father’s trade or to marry within his craft. Indeed, some of the same factors which contributed to the formation of executioners’ and skinners’ dynasties encouraged endogamy in the artisanate. The advantages of early socialization within a craft and the privileges accorded to masters’

sons and to journeymen who married masters’ daughters and widows resulted in the development of artisanal dynasties whose members practiced the same craft over several generations. Of course, artisans were not subject to those external social pressures that compelled executioners and skinners to intermarry, so artisanal endogamy was never as exclusive as that of executioners, and artisanal dynasties were never as long-lasting and stable as executioners’ clans. Nonetheless, Lyndal Roper suggests that ‘‘the exclusiveness of the later sixteenth-century smaller craft associations meant that they increasingly tended to coincide with kinship networks.’’ The social endogamy of executioners and skinners was also promoted by family strategies intended to ensure the professional training of the young, the transfer of executioners’ and skinners’ posts, and the inheritance of property. 

The question of property brings us to the economic status of executioners and skinners. Here the sources are quite sketchy. As non-citizens, executioners and skinners did not pay the regular property tax. Cash reserves on which citizens would have been taxed were tax exempt for executioners and skinners. They only paid taxes on land and buildings they purchased on city lands. Thus, in the intermittent years when the tax records did record a payment by executioners, this

*Executioners and skinners*

only reflects the real estate executioners owned. Other assets remain invisible. An executioner who paid one gulden in tax, for example, was possibly much wealthier than a citizen who paid the same amount. Here it becomes clear that the denial of citizenship, which on the symbolic plane was clearly a denial of social status, also offered significant economic advantage. Executioners were exempt from the basic head tax, most property taxes, the fee charged to finance city guards, military contributions, and indirect taxes on alcohol and meat. Judging by the vigorous protests with which executioners reacted to reforming administrators of the eighteenth century who wanted to cancel this exemption in an effort to make the tax system more uniform, the exemption from indirect taxes on alcohol and meat was a significant economic factor.

The special tax status of executioners and skinners makes it impossible to consider their economic status in relationship to the citizenry in general on the basis of their tax payments. However, scattered sources indicate that Augsburg’s executioners tended to be well off in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries and would have had little incentive to marry into economically weaker artisanal families. The executioner Veit Stolz died a wealthy man in . It is possible to follow the gradual accumulation of his wealth in the tax and guardianship records. In 

Stolz purchased a house, on which he paid  gulden,  kreuzer property tax. At a tax rate of . percent for real estate, Stolz’s house was worth over  gulden. In

 he purchased a second house worth  gulden. In  Stolz must have purchased additional property for he was now required to pay  gulden,  kreuzer, 

 heller for his houses, which means that he owned property worth more than ,

gulden. In  he purchased a fourth house and his tax payment now rose to 

gulden,  kreuzer,  heller, so that his collected properties were worth at least

, gulden. When Stolz died in  he left his adoptive daughter the impressive sum of , gulden. To give an idea of what these numbers might mean, in the sixteenth century Augsburg’s civic dowry fund provided poor but deserving couples with a dowry of  gulden as starting capital for their marriage. This was

‘‘enough to buy a good bed with a little to spare.’’ The urban authorities required that applicants for citizenship prove that they owned capital worth  gulden, to guarantee that the new citizens would not become a burden on the urban welfare system.

Executioner Hans Deibler was not as wealthy as Veit Stolz, but he was still

comfortably well off. In  Deibler purchased a house worth  gulden. By 

he was paying  gulden in taxes, which indicates that he had acquired property worth  gulden. The historian Claus-Peter Clasen places citizens who paid over 

gulden in property taxes in the ‘‘middling’’ social stratum. Again, this payment only reflected the real estate Deibler owned; Deibler’s collected assets might have added up to a good deal more. In  Deibler arranged for the division of the property of his late wife Barbara Hartna¨glin among his three children. This property consisted of  gulden. Each child received  gulden. This was not the inheritance the children would receive at Deibler’s own death, but was taken from his wife’s assets alone. Unfortunately there are no records on the property Deibler himself left his heirs, but the son who succeeded him was also obviously well off. In

 Hans’s son, Michael Deibler, purchased a house for which he paid  gulden property tax; in other words the house was worth  gulden. By  he had purchased two additional houses and paid a total of  gulden,  kreuzer, which shows that his combined properties were worth more than  gulden. When Michael Deibler died in  his widow Sabina Scheibenhart sold her share of her husband’s houses to her son-in-law, the new executioner Dietrich Metz, for ,

gulden. Metz had to buy out the other heirs for  gulden, so that the total value of Michael Deibler’s houses lay at , gulden.

The testament of executioner Marx Philipp Hartmann enables us to flesh out these numbers. When his wife Barbara died in , Hartmann made a testament to settle the inheritance of his small daughter Maria Barbara Hartmann. He put up the respectable sum of  gulden as dowry. Maria’s inheritance was also to include three golden rings, several silver belts, two gold and silver inlaid cups and various other silver and gold items, together with ‘‘three of the best executioner’s swords,’’

twenty-one medical texts, and various household furnishings. This testament was made only five years after Hartmann had officially succeeded his father-in-law Dietrich Metz as executioner, so Hartmann had not had much time to accumulate property. During his long career Hartmann apparently continued to prosper. 

When he was arranging the marriage of his daughter Maria Barbara in , Hartmann boasted in public that he would provide her with a dowry of ,

gulden. When a property dispute arose over this issue the following year, Hartmann’s son-in-law brought in several witnesses, including a tavern owner and the skinner, who testified that they had heard Hartmann make this claim. Hartmann

*Executioners and skinners*

was unwilling to follow through, so this appears to have been an empty boast, but his son-in-law and his listeners seem to have believed him. Master Marx must have been very wealthy indeed for such a boast to be at all plausible.

Skinners were less wealthy than executioners. In the early sixteenth century, when skinners were still listed as citizens in the tax record they paid the basic citizen tax, the ‘‘ *habnit*’’ tax, which indicated that they owned no additional taxable income. Skinners, in contrast to executioners, seem never to have acquired any real estate within the city. From ca.  to  when the series of tax records ends, skinners never paid any property tax on houses or lands they had purchased. Only one source on the property a skinner left his heirs has been preserved, the entry in the guardianship records which settled the affairs of the skinner Johann Scheppelin, who had been employed in Augsburg from  until his death in . The skinner left  gulden which were divided equally among his five children. In addition the four sons received their father’s clothes and medical books, and the daughter received a bed. This inheritance was much smaller than what Marx Philipp Hartmann had bequeathed to his daughter in . Unlike Hartmann, Scheppelin left no gold and silver dishes and jewelry or other valuables. While this skinner was not poor, he was clearly less well off than the executioners discussed above. 

Since no wealthy skinners appear in the sources, it is safe to conclude that Augsburg’s skinners were generally in a weaker economic position than executioners. This confronts us with another question. What was the relationship between Augsburg’s executioners and skinners? To what extent did their status differ? We should recall that the skinner not only disposed of carrion, but also served as the executioner’s assistant in performing criminal punishments. The master executioner often delegated the execution of the dishonorable death penalty of hanging or the task of removing the corpses of suicides to the skinner. In northern Germany a social abyss separated executioners and skinners. According to Giesela Wilbertz, who has studied the social history of executioners and skinners in the principality of Osnabru

¨ ck in detail, executioners in northern Germany were not much affected by dishonor, but skinners felt the stigma in full force. The higher social status of executioners in northern Germany can be explained, according to Wilbertz, by the fact that executioners and skinners maintained a careful division of labor. Executioners in northern Germany were never personally involved with skinning. They merely controlled the economic rights to skinning in a certain area and leased out these rights to skinners as a concession. In their role as subordinates of the executioner, skinners were required to perform certain menial tasks.

*The dishonorable milieu*

Often executioners did not perform torture themselves but delegated this responsibility to their servants, the skinners. Skinners generally carried out the dishonorable death penalty of hanging, while executioners reserved the technically more demanding and more honorable penalty of beheading for themselves. Executioners and skinners formed two interdependent but distinct castes. Executioners were careful to distance themselves from skinners. Any executioner who personally dirtied his hands with skinning would have disqualified himself from being an executioner. In northern Germany executioners and skinners did not intermarry. If a member of an executioners’ clan married a skinner’s child, this was considered a meśalliance which sealed the executioner’s social decline into the subordinate skinners’ caste.

Executioners were clearly of higher status than skinners in south Germany as well. The skinner was held in greater contempt by the public than the executioner. 

The skinner did filthy work with base materials, which lacked the drama of a spectacular execution. Feelings of ‘‘revulsion’’ \( *Abscheu*\), ‘‘horror’’ \( *Entsetzen*\), and

‘‘disgust’’ \( *Ekel*\) were often expressed in descriptions of the skinner’s work. In contrast, descriptions of the executioner’s various tasks in criminal executions were matter of fact, usually without any qualifying adjectives. As in northern Germany, the skinner served as the executioner’s assistant in Augsburg, but he got the dirty work. In , for example, executioner Marx Philipp Hartmann ordered the skinner Johann Scheppelin to dispose of the corpses of two suicides. The city paid Master Marx  gulden for this task. Master Marx in turn paid the skinner 

kreuzer.

But while skinners were clearly subordinate to executioners, their relationship was usually more cooperative than hierarchical. The Augsburg skinner did not lease the skinning rights in the area from the executioner. Rather he was granted this monopoly in his own right by the city. In southern Germany executioners and skinners did not establish as careful a division of labor as their colleagues in the north. In a large city such as Augsburg the offices of skinner and executioner were distinct, but many smaller Swabian towns and villages employed an ‘‘executioner’’

who fulfilled both functions, but was often no more than a glorified skinner. That

*Executioners and skinners*

executioners and skinners did intermarry in the south has been demonstrated in the biographical sketches above. South German executioners and skinners cannot be separated into a superior and inferior caste. There were only more or less highly placed members within the same caste. 

The servants and laborers who worked and often lived with the executioner and skinner were also part of the core group of dishonorable people. Neither citizens nor residents, these dependent workers occupied the same legal limbo as the executioners and skinners and participated fully in the dishonor of their masters. 

Beadles and dungeon guards were recruited from south German executioners’ and skinners’ clans. It is likely that these were younger sons and daughters who could not acquire full positions and earned their living as servants of their more successful relatives. Hans Georg Reiser, the *Henkersknecht *\(executioner’s servant\) whom the Mozart brothers carried to his grave in , had come to Augsburg from the nearby Swabian village of Hochstett and had been in the employ of the executioner Marx Philipp Hartmann since . Hartmann referred to Reiser as his ‘‘cousin,’’

which indicates that Reiser was a member of an executioners’ clan. A Michael Reiser was executioner in the small Swabian town of Ingstetten in , and numerous other members of the Reiser clan filled south German executioners’

posts in the later seventeenth and the eighteenth century. Hans Crafft was one of Augsburg’s beadles \( *Malefizscherge*\). He had been hired in  from Nuremberg and in  he resigned the post because he hoped to find a better position ‘‘for himself and his family’’ – possibly an advancement to an executioner’s post. Hans Crafft was perhaps related to the executioner of Regensburg of the same name who was murdered in . By their intimate association with executioners and skinners – and by their family background – these laborers were clearly dishonorable. But in spite of the potential for pollution, executioners’ and skinners’ servants, like their masters, were rarely involved in dishonor conflicts with honorable guildsmen. In fact, the only such conflict I have found before the eighteenth century involved the burial of the executioner’s servant Hans Georg Reiser. 

Executioners’ and skinners’ servants apparently did not attempt to enter guilds and they seem to have conducted themselves in such a way that conflicts rarely arose. 

Finally, we must turn to the question of numbers. How many members of the dishonorable core group lived in Augsburg at any one time? It is difficult to estimate the size of the group of executioners, skinners, their families and their servants, and their servants’ families. Augsburg never employed more than one executioner and one skinner. Information on the number of children in executioners’ and skinners’

households is available in only a few cases. Skinner Johann Scheppelin left five who had removed a cow which had been struck by lightning from Kempten territory. StaatsAA, Reichsstadt Kempten , September , .

*The dishonorable milieu*

children when he died in . Skinner Johann Jakob Scheller had four children during his second marriage between  and . Scheller married a third time in . In his third marriage he had eleven children, six of whom survived until adulthood. In the eighteenth century, and presumably in the earlier as well, Augsburg employed two dungeon guards \( *Eisenknechte*\), one Catholic, one Protestant. It appears that the skinner employed a large team of laborers. In 

skinner Johann Jacob Scheller employed eleven servants \( *Schindersknechte*\).

Since the responsibilities of skinners did not change much over time, we can safely assume that they employed a similar number of laborers in the earlier period as well. The executioner seems to have employed fewer assistants than the skinner. In

 the city council ordered that the executioner should employ no more than two

‘‘married persons’’ as his servants \( *Henkersknechte*\) and that his other laborers – the decree did not state how many – should be expelled. Obviously it is impossible to offer more than a rough estimate. The dishonorable core could have numbered anywhere between thirty and sixty people. In a city of , in , or even in a city of around , in the late seventeenth century, this was not a large number of people. It is clear that the significance of dishonorable people did not lie in their numbers. 

CONCLUSION

The core of dishonorable people did not form a homogeneous social group. 

Executioners, skinners, and their servants were all members of the same professional caste, but there were significant variations of wealth and status within this caste. Executioners were at the top of the spectrum, while the skinner’s laborers made up the bottom. The formation of this professional caste and the consolidation of the dishonorable milieu took place in the second half of the sixteenth century. 

The long tenures of executioners and skinners in the second half of the sixteenth and the seventeenth centuries, which contrast with the instability and rapid turnovers of the early sixteenth century, reflect this consolidation. Between 

and  the average term of employment of Augsburg’s executioners and skinners was just over twenty years. In the early sixteenth century executioners and skinners were on average employed six years at the most. Before they developed a professional caste, executioners and skinners were often unruly and disorderly. In

*Executioners and skinners*

contrast, in the late sixteenth and seventeenth centuries they generally behaved

‘‘honorably,’’ i.e. they acted in a morally respectable and law-abiding manner. By the early seventeenth century executioners and skinners had developed a stable endogamous marriage pattern. Within their caste social and professional relationships were articulated through the model of kinship – actual or metaphorical. We have seen that executioners and skinners referred to their colleagues and subordinates as ‘‘cousins,’’ regardless of the degree to which they were actually related. 

Executioners and skinners were subject to the same legitimacy requirements as honorable citizens. 

The dishonorable milieu consolidated and the boundary of honor hardened as part of the same social process. By the early seventeenth century the boundary separating dishonorable people from honorable society was firmly established. The role of external coercion in this process must be considered along with social pressures from within the professional groups of executioners and skinners, and incentives offered by honorable society to induce executioners and skinners to abide by the rules of their social exclusion. When one considers their polluting potential, surprisingly few dishonor conflicts involving executioners and skinners actually occurred. This is an indication that as the boundary of honor was established certain social conventions and routines were worked out to prevent incessant conflict. As will become clear in chapter , the most virulent and lengthy dishonor conflicts involved the less polluting groups on the periphery of dishonor rather than the dishonorable core itself. 

Social discrimination was certainly a significant factor in the development of executioners’ and skinners’ endogamous marriage pattern, but such intermarriage was also the result of family strategies to ensure the professional training of the young, the transfer of executioners’ and skinners’ positions, and the inheritance of wealth. We have seen that executioners were often wealthy. The high economic status of executioners will have made their low social status more palatable to them. 

Skinners, however, appear to have been less well off, and executioners’ and skinners’ servants who bore the stigma of dishonor along with their masters most likely did not benefit from such financial compensation. 

The ambiguous social position executioners and skinners occupied in this society is evident in their non-citizen status. While the denial of citizenship cast them as strangers passing through, their long terms of employment indicate that they were actually very rooted in Augsburg. The denial of citizenship was the most symbolic form of discrimination to which executioners and skinners were subjected in Augsburg. At the same time, their tax-exempt status that resulted from this denial presented a major financial benefit. Partly as a result of this paradox, the hierarchies of honor and wealth that structured the society of orders clashed in the person of the executioner.
