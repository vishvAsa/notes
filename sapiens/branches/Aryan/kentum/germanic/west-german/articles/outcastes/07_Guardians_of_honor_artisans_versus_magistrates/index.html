  <p>Uncompromising guardians of the boundary of honor, artisans pushed the social exclusion of dishonorable people to new extremes in the course of the early modern period. What was at stake for Augsburg’s honorable artisans in dishonor conflicts?</p>
<p>What did they stand to gain by excluding dishonorable candidates from their guild?</p>
<p>What did the authorities stand to lose if the stigma of dishonor spread? We have examined the symbolic logic of pollution and the ambivalent and paradoxical effects of dishonor in the contexts of punishment and healing. Now we turn to the role of dishonor in urban politics and economics, and in the social practices of daily life.</p>
<p>The analysis of the politics of dishonor will proceed on several levels. First we will consider the feasibility of an economic explanation of the phenomenon of dishonor. Were artisans using their stringent honor requirements as a pretext to exclude as many people as possible from their guilds and thus limit economic competition, as many historians have argued? We then survey different types of dishonor conflicts to determine what sets of circumstances tended to trigger dishonor pollution. This typology of conflicts will illustrate that dishonor pollution did not depend on religious sanctions, and that confessional boundaries were not relevant in dishonor conflicts. It will also be shown that dishonor was male-centered. The wives and daughters of defiled tradesmen were less polluting than dishonorable men, and women from the artisan classes were less easily polluted than honorable men.</p>
<p>The pollution anxieties of guildsmen must be analyzed in their larger social context. The key to understanding the significance of honor and dishonor for the artisans, and the meaning of dishonor in the society of orders as a whole, lies in examining social interactions *within * honorable society, between the different honorable estates. In the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, patricians and guildsmen repeatedly locked horns over how the boundary of honor would run – and over who would determine its course. What was the constellation of forces in such conflicts?</p>
<p>The participants were honorable masters, journeymen, patrician magistrates, dishonorable people, and an artisan public that formed a crucial backdrop to these</p>
<p> See for instance Fritz Blaich, <em>Die Wirtschaftspolitik des Reichstages im Heiligen Ro¨mischen Reich. Ein</em> *Beitrag zur Problemgeschichte wirtschaftlichen Gestaltens *(Stuttgart, ), pp. –; Roland Bettger, <em>Das Handwerk in Augsburg beim U</em></p>
<p><em>¨ bergang der Stadt an das Ko¨nigreich Bayern. Sta¨dtisches Gewerbe unter</em> *dem Einfluss politischer Vera¨nderungen *(Augsburg, ), p. .</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>Artisanal honor and urban politics</em> disputes. What were the motivations and goals of these different social groups?</p>
<p>Dishonor conflicts reveal much about the political and social relationships that structured the urban commune. How much power did Augsburg’s magistrates have over their artisanal subjects? Since the repeal of the guild constitution in </p>
<p>Augsburg was governed by an authoritarian regime. Augsburg’s aristocratic constitution effectively denied artisans political representation. But did artisans develop non-constitutional means to influence policy making? What was the role of journeymen? What pressure could they bring to bear on their masters – and on government? And finally, what role did dishonor conflicts play in relations between different honorable guilds?</p>
<p>The discussion is based on the analysis of  cases documented in Augsburg’s guild records between  and . If  were the actual number of cases that occurred in these two and a half centuries, then Augsburg’s artisans would have been confronted with a new dishonor conflict just about every two years. The actual number of conflicts was probably much higher, however. I did not consult even half of Augsburg’s enormous collection of guild records, and even among those crafts whose papers I viewed in their entirety, it is not likely that documentation on all dishonor conflicts in these trades has survived. Only  of these  conflicts occurred in Augsburg, which means that on average a new dishonor conflict erupted in Augsburg every five and a half years. The other  cases occurred in cities and territories in the vicinity of Augsburg or as far away as Basel or Strasbourg. The guilds or governments of these cities or territories conferred with Augsburg about how to resolve dishonor conflicts that had erupted in their guilds.</p>
<p>These frequent foreign inquiries confronted Augsburg’s magistrates and guildsmen with the issue of dishonor even when no dishonor conflict was currently in progress at home. Augsburg’s reports reveal the attitudes of patricians and guildsmen as they debated how they would handle the conflict in question if such a case were to occur in Augsburg. The inquiries also reminded Augsburg’s guildsmen that they were under constant scrutiny from abroad. Every dishonor conflict that occurred in Augsburg was played out before two artisanal publics. The first audience was made up of artisans in different guilds, i.e. the general artisanal public in Augsburg. The second audience consisted of guildsmen within the same craft in</p>

<p>other cities. Augsburg’s guildsmen and magistrates were distinctly aware of this second public and they usually consulted governments and guilds of other free imperial cities before they made any decision concerning local dishonor conflicts.</p>
<p>Such advice was politically delicate. It was not given or taken lightly. Local authorities might be able to head off a dishonor conflict before it started, if they could convince their guildsmen that their fellow tradesmen in other cities had no objection to a potentially dishonorable candidate for guild membership. However, it was a risky affair for governments or guildsmen to let themselves be dragged into dishonor conflicts abroad. If the guildsmen judged an applicant to be dishonorable, then they might be attacked by the government in the neighboring city and by their own authorities for failing to respect imperial law. On the other hand, if the guildsmen stated that they supported the decision of their fellow tradesmen in another city to accept a questionable candidate, then they themselves were liable to be challenged by the artisans in yet another city, who considered the applicant unacceptable. Any dishonor conflict usually had ramifications beyond the local level.</p>
<p>Most dishonor conflicts were initiated by dishonorable people. Conflicts resulted when a dishonorable person, or more often a son or daughter of a dishonorable person, sought to be incorporated in a guild. The experiences of the sons of the bailiff Tobias Frank who tried to learn the goldsmiths’ trade in  and  are typical. The masters rejected the boy in each case and used the specter of a journeymen’s strike to pressure the authorities to accept their decision. Conflicts involving the daughter or widow of a dishonorable man followed the same pattern.</p>
<p>HONOR AND ECONOMIC SELF-INTEREST?</p>
<p>Historians have interpreted conflicts of this kind as cynical attempts by guild artisans to further their economic self-interest by rejecting as many applicants as possible in order to limit competition. But is economic self-interest a satisfactory explanation for the behavior of the artisans? There are several reasons to argue against this theory. Artisans first began to exclude groups they defined as dishonorable in the early fourteenth century. By the fifteenth century such exclusions had</p>
<p> For example, during a dishonor conflict in the embroiderers’ guild in , the Augsburg city government consulted with Memmingen, Nuremberg, Munich, Cologne, Regensburg, Strasbourg, Frankfurt, and Ulm. Some of these cities gave only non-committal answers. Strasbourg complained that when their guildsmen had stated their position openly in past conflicts, they had been dragged into the conflict and suffered great inconvenience and expense.

<p><em>Artisanal honor and urban politics</em> become the general practice. However, in the hundred years after  guild masters were more interested in attracting apprentices and journeymen than in excluding them. The catastrophic demographic losses after the Black Death resulted in a crisis for agriculture, but the urban economy flourished. As the population shrank, food prices fell. This left country folk and city dwellers with more disposable income to spend on artisanal products. The second half of the fourteenth and the fifteenth centuries were times of economic growth and prosperity for urban artisans, limited only by a severe labor shortage. It would hardly have been in the guild masters’ interest to use dishonor as a pretext to bar apprentices from their guild.</p>
<p>Was it the economic self-interest of the journeymen, then, that led to these exclusions? Journeymen’s organizations developed in Germany at about the same time that guilds first began to exclude dishonorable people. The first journeymen’s organizations in the empire developed in the early fourteenth century, and the first sources on journeymen’s organizations in Augsburg date from the mid-fourteenth century. While it is perhaps no coincidence that the exclusion of dishonorable people and the emergence of journeymen’s organizations happened at the same time – since journeymen played a dominant role in dishonor conflicts in the early modern period – it is very unlikely that journeymen tried to keep dishonorable people out of the guilds in order to limit economic competition. Journeymen were doing very well in the hundred years between  and . Due to the labor shortage real wages were rising during this period, which has led one historian to describe these years as a ‘‘golden age’’ for wage earners.</p>
<p>If economic self-interest does not fully explain the exclusion of dishonorable people in the late middle ages, perhaps this theory will work better for the early modern period. At first sight this seems plausible. The artisans’ economic fortunes declined during the early modern period. The demographic growth of the sixteenth century adversely affected the artisanal economy. Agricultural prices rose dispro-portionately, and the common folk were forced to spend more on food, leaving them with little money to spend on artisanal products. Journeymen were especially hard pressed by this development. In contrast to the late middle ages, they were now plagued by unemployment. As the demand for artisanal products fell, masters laid off journeymen and real wages fell. By the eighteenth century, journeymen of</p>

<p>many crafts no longer earned a living wage and no police ordinance was complete without forbidding traveling journeymen to beg.</p>
<p>Faced with economic decline, artisanal guilds tried to limit competition in a variety of ways. They limited the number of apprentices and journeymen a master might employ. Such restrictions were a common feature of guild ordinances during the early modern period. They were designed to ensure relative equality among guildsmen by preventing one master from expanding his production at the expense of the next. The guilds also raised apprenticeship fees and lengthened the training periods of apprentices and journeymen. In  an apprenticeship in the goldsmiths’ guild lasted four years, while journeymen trained for an additional ten years.</p>
<p>By  apprentices and journeymen had to complete six and twelve years of training respectively. In  an aspiring barber-surgeon had to complete seven years of training; by  he had to complete ten years. Guildsmen limited the number of journeymen who could apply to become masters in a given year. In </p>
<p>the goldsmiths allowed eight journeymen to apply per year; in  this number was reduced to six. Those journeymen who were allowed to apply had to produce expensive master pieces. If they successfully completed the master piece they had to host elaborate meals for the masters before they were inducted into the guild. Guilds often accepted only masters’ sons or journeymen who married a guildsman’s daughter or widow as masters. Sometimes guilds limited the number of masters, so that no journeyman could apply until one of the present masters had died. As a result of such measures it became increasingly difficult in the course of the early modern period for a journeyman to become a master. For many artisans being a journeyman was no longer just a stage in the life-cycle; it had become a permanent condition. The authorities condemned some of these measures as ‘‘abuses,’’ in particular the expensive master pieces and the extravagant masters’ meals. But the magistrates did not believe in an unregulated economy or a free labor market any more than the guildsmen did. The prosperity of the guild masters and citizens was a</p>

<p><em>Artisanal honor and urban politics</em> higher priority for the city government than the fate of journeymen who had not yet established themselves in the city. The government guaranteed the economic monopolies of individual guilds, and for the most part, when the guildsmen wanted to pass measures to limit competition, the council supported them.</p>
<p>Was the exclusion of dishonorable people just one among many such measures intended to limit competition? If so, it was not a very effective means to reach this goal. The number of people who might be excluded by such measures was really quite small. As we have seen, there were just about one hundred dishonorable or potentially dishonorable people in Augsburg at any one time. It is hardly likely that artisans set up their stringent honor requirements with the intention of limiting the number of applicants, for dishonorable people were simply too few in number for it to be worth all the fuss. Furthermore, artisans did not need a <em>pretext</em> to limit competition. Guildsmen were quite open about the need to limit guild membership, and they employed a variety of measures to exclude applicants with the support of the city government. Artisans were not cynical about questions of honor. The real reasons for the exclusion of dishonorable people were symbolic, not economic.</p>
<p>A TYPOLOGY OF DISHONOR CONFLICTS</p>
<p>What sets of circumstances tended to provoke dishonor conflicts? The majority of the dishonor conflicts,  of  cases, were initiated by dishonorable people trying to gain access to an honorable guild. However,  cases, just over a third of the conflicts between  and , followed a quite different pattern, one that would be quite baffling to historians looking for an economic explanation of the phenomenon of dishonor. These conflicts were not initiated by a dishonorable person trying to get into a guild. They occurred within the guild, between honorable guildsmen, when a member transgressed certain group rules. Conflicts of this kind resulted when an honorable artisan came into contact with an executioner or skinner –</p>
<p>whether voluntarily, through sociability, or involuntarily, when an artisan was subjected to torture or punishment at the hands of the executioner.</p>
<p>Artisans saw inappropriate social interaction with executioners or skinners as reprehensible violations of their honor code. Voluntary sociability did not cause the most serious dishonor conflicts, however. The guildsmen punished such offenders, but did not expel them permanently. In  three master rope-makers were boycotted, merely for setting foot in the skinner’s house. But after the dust had settled, the rope-makers continued to practice their trade. Guild correspondence over the next years refers to them as working masters. In  Hans Seidler, a master weaver, sealed a business deal with the skinner with a glass of wine.</p>
<p> On the cooperation between guilds and city government in the effort to limit competition, see Bettger, <em>Handwerk</em>, pp. –.</p>

<p></p>
<p><em>Artisans versus magistrates</em></p>
<p>Appalled, the weavers demanded his exemplary punishment. Such a case had not occurred in their trade ‘‘in human memory,’’ they claimed. But Seidler was not banished permanently from his guild. Indeed, he served as a government-appointed spokesman for the weavers in . When the journeyman stonemasons Hans Georg and Franz Mozart carried an executioner’s servant to his grave in</p>
<p>, their fellow journeymen insisted on punishing such public association with the executioner. But this deviation from the ‘‘path of honor’’ did not prevent the Mozart brothers from, in time, becoming master stonemasons. Had the primary purpose of pollution rules been to limit competition, the guilds would never have permitted such reconciliation. But, in fact, the purpose of boycotts and fines in sociability conflicts was to correct an imbalance the transgressor had caused by his infraction of group rules. Fines were usually spent in common drinking bouts in which the offender was reintegrated into his corporate group, the journeymen’s association or masters’ guild.</p>
<p>Paradoxically, involuntary contact with executioners or skinners had far more tragic consequences for honorable artisans. The plight of torture victims illustrates the extreme fragility of artisanal honor to the executioner’s <em>touch</em>. Artisans seemed to interpret honor in physical, somatic terms. A guildsman’s honor had to be unsoiled, pristine, immaculate. After being subjected to torture, a person’s honor had been damaged, his or her innocence notwithstanding, as the journeymen explained in their remarkable argument concerning Augustin Gerstecker: ‘‘If you get a stain on your clothing, you can wash it out. Nonetheless, you cannot say that the stain was never there.’’ The physical act of torture not only violated the body, it permanently altered the essential nature of the victim. A torture victim’s honor was no longer intact, and no governmental proclamation would ever be able to restore it in its integrity. Artisans expressed this materialistic sense of honor in their language. To insult someone was described as ‘‘touching’’ or ‘‘grabbing’’ his honor ( <em>an Ehren antatschen</em>). By committing a dishonorable act, an artisan ‘‘besmirched’’</p>
<p>( <em>besudelt</em>) his honor; ‘‘a stain was sticking to him’’ ( <em>eine Makul klebete ihm an</em>).</p>
<p>Artisans saw the loss of male honor as analogous to the loss of a woman’s virginity.</p>
<p>One dishonored artisan made this comparison explicitly; in language that strikingly evoked the loss of maidenhead, he told how he had been ‘‘seduced’’ and robbed of his ‘‘jewel of honor’’ ( <em>Ehrenkleinod</em>).</p>

<p><em>Artisanal honor and urban politics</em> there had been no actual contact with an executioner or skinner. An artisan could transgress the boundary of honor by committing certain polluting acts by which he symbolically associated himself with the executioner or skinner. In such cases dishonor was transmitted through the materials with which the executioner or skinner worked. We saw that physical contact with the tools of punishment conferred dishonor. The wood and stone of the gallows initially were neutral materials that became permeated with dishonor by the executioner’s touch when they were used in the context of criminal punishments. Other materials were intrinsically polluting in themselves, regardless of whether the executioner or skinner had laid hands on them. Animal carcasses were intensely polluting. The skinner alone had the right to touch such matter. Any artisan who violated this prohibition likened himself to the skinner. In  the butchers’ guild expelled Jacob Glanz, a fellow master, because he had skinned three sheep that had drowned in a brook. When he removed the skins, he threw the carcasses back into the creek.</p>
<p>This caused severe reactions by both government and guild. The magistrates ordered his arrest and banished him from the city. Their reasons were quite</p>
<p>‘‘rational.’’ They were concerned with hygiene and public health. By throwing the carcasses into the creek, Glanz might have contaminated the water and caused an epidemic. The city government soon pardoned him, however, and readmitted him to the city. His fellow guildsmen were less forgiving; Glanz’s ‘‘unrighteous act’’ fell within the responsibilities of the skinner. The patrician supervisors of the butchers’</p>
<p>guild tried to appease the artisans: the sheep in question had not died of some disease. They drowned during a violent storm. The meat was fresh and undiseased.</p>
<p>But the supervisors’ argument made no impression on the butchers. In the past, the guildsmen argued, they had never been forced to accept a member unless he was of honorable ‘‘conduct, condition, and origin.’’ Glanz’s ‘‘skinner’s act’’ ( <em>schynders</em> <em>handel</em>) disqualified him from membership. An interesting feature of this case is that the priorities of guild and government were so different. Motivated by utilitarian concerns, the city government feared physical contamination and disease. The guildsmen were concerned with the symbolic danger of ritual pollution.</p>
<p>A conflict that occurred in Kaufbeuren in  illustrates the criteria according to which artisans distinguished between ‘‘butcher’s work’’ and ‘‘skinner’s work.’’</p>
<p>When a cow crushed her newborn calf, the owner beat the severely injured calf to death with a shovel and gave it to an impoverished weaver’s widow. The widow cut up the carcass and ate it together with her journeymen, one of whom informed the guild. The weavers decided to expel her from the guild for life, because she had done ‘‘work that only the skinner is allowed to do.’’ Kaufbeuren magistrates argued on the widow’s behalf: the calf did not die of a disease but had been beaten to death, so it was not really ‘‘skinner’s carrion’’ ( <em>schindermeßiges Aas</em>). Its flesh was still white and blood still flowed ‘‘in its natural color.’’ The widow and her journeymen had</p>

<p><em>Artisans versus magistrates</em></p>
<p>eaten the meat ‘‘without disgust’’ and without damage to their health. These arguments convinced the Augsburg weavers, who had been asked to arbitrate the case, to rule in the widow’s favor. Her ‘‘offense and inappropriate act’’ was mitigated by her extreme poverty. The Augsburg guildsmen recommended that the widow be fined and temporarily suspended, but not expelled permanently.</p>
<p>Another factor working in the widow’s favor was her gender. This is the only documented case of an honorable woman being punished for this type of ritual transgression. As we shall see, women in general played a peripheral role in dishonor conflicts. Guildsmen judged male transgressions more harshly and condemned this type of offense as especially reprehensible. Conflicts of this kind were perhaps the most threatening to artisanal honor. When an artisan committed such a polluting action ‘‘without thinking about his honor and without regard for his trade,’’ he demonstrated a willful disregard of group rules. The elaborate artisanal code of conduct could only be upheld if such delinquent guild members who were</p>
<p>‘‘hameless’’ and ‘‘forgetful of honor’’ were expelled.</p>
<p>DISPOSAL OF SUICIDES: SECULAR DISHONOR VS. ‘‘TABOO’’</p>
<p>The disposal of suicides provoked ritual pollution conflicts in both urban and rural society. It was a traditional task of executioners and skinners to dispose of the bodies of suicide victims. Suicide was a mortal sin; both Catholic and Protestant churches refused to bury suicides in consecrated ground. In addition, secular law mandated certain ‘‘rites of desecration’’ in disposing of the body. In </p>
<p>Augsburg’s magistrates decreed that ‘‘the corpse should be nailed into a barrel and sent away, as is customary . . .’’ The skinner cast the barrel into the river Lech.</p>
<p>Alternatively, the bodies of suicides were buried beneath the gallows. In Nuremberg the body was sometimes burned at a crossroad, in north Germany it was dumped into a swamp. Such defamatory rituals sometimes were accompanied by additional apotropaic measures. In the second half of the seventeenth century it was still customary in Nuremberg to lower the body from a window by night instead of carrying it over the threshold. The body was carried away face down, so its malevolent spirit could not find its way home. Such treatment was, of course, extremely dishonoring for suicide victims and their families.</p>

<p><em>Artisanal honor and urban politics</em> humane policy towards suicide in the late seventeenth century. Elites developed a</p>
<p>‘‘secularized’’ and ‘‘medicalized’’ view of suicide, and by the eighteenth century, authorities began to accept an ‘‘insanity defense’’ for suicides, and suppressed traditional rites of desecration. Augsburg’s magistrates distinguished between</p>
<p>‘‘malicious’’ suicides who committed suicide ‘‘on purpose’’ because they had lost faith in God, or in order to avoid punishment for a crime, and ‘‘melancholy’’</p>
<p>suicides who had killed themselves because of some mental disorder. ‘‘Melancholy’’ suicides could receive a Christian burial. By the eighteenth century, the government tended to give suicide victims the benefit of the doubt. Unless they were notorious sinners, all suicides were classified as ‘‘melancholics.’’ This new policy was fully implemented in , when the government decreed that all suicides be given an honorable burial in consecrated earth, unless they were criminals who killed themselves awaiting punishment. The government’s new approach resulted in endless petitions by executioners protesting the loss of income this policy change entailed.</p>
<p>In addition to arousing the ire of executioners and skinners, this new humane policy towards suicides caused a particular type of dishonor conflict to occur more frequently. Honorable artisans who came in contact with the corpse of a suicide were excluded from their guilds, because they had committed an action that made them akin to the skinner. Such a case occurred in the Austrian town of Veldkirch in</p>
<p> when a citizen hanged himself. Upon questioning the man’s confessor and the barber-surgeons who examined the body – from afar, while it was still hanging –</p>
<p>the authorities decided that he was ‘‘quite crazy.’’ In other words, he was not a</p>
<p>‘‘malicious’’ suicide and should not be denied an honorable Christian burial. The magistrates informed the family of the suicide victim of this decision, whereupon family members detached the body from the rope. In the case of a negative decision, this task would have fallen to the executioner or skinner. Various artisans participated in the wake and helped carry the body to its grave. After the burial, all the artisans who took part in the funeral procession – shoemakers, weavers, and cabinet-makers among others – were expelled from their guilds for this dishonorable action.</p>

<p>sions during the seventeenth century. When the Bavarian high council classified individual suicides as melancholics, and ordered that their bodies be buried in consecrated ground within the churchyard, this ‘‘medicalized’’ attitude of the authorities clashed with popular culture, though in a different way than in cities.</p>
<p>Peasants organized graveyard riots to prevent the burial of suicides in their village cemeteries. Villages constituted ‘‘sacral communities.’’ To desecrate the churchyard by burying a suicide in its hallowed ground, threatened to destroy the</p>
<p>‘‘metaphysical link between the sacral community and the hereafter,’’ and might incite divine retribution upon the collectivity. God’s wrath would wreak devasta-tion in the form of hailstorms, famine, or other calamities.</p>
<p>The peasants’ fear represents a ‘‘taboo’’ in the anthropological sense. Anthropologists define ‘‘taboo’’ as ‘‘supernaturally sanctioned law.’’ Transgression of such religious prohibitions would result in cosmological pollution, provoking direct divine sanction. Infringement of the ‘‘taboo’’ was made manifest in tangible physical consequences in the material world (e.g. hail). In contrast, urban dishonor was not hedged in by supernatural sanctions. Among honorable guildsmen, desecration of the cemetery was not the issue of contention. The problem lay in finding individuals willing to *transport * the corpse. Dishonor pollution did not threaten the urban community as a whole. Artisans who touched the dishonorable corpse suffered an individual loss of honor, and the social, economic, and political consequences that entailed. Dishonor had no religious impact on the individual or the community. Dishonor pollution did not provoke the wrath of God.</p>

<p>the secular anxieties of urban artisans. But the differences might also be part of a larger cultural pattern that distinguished urban and rural societies. Bernd Roeck has found that the European witch-hunt was less bloody in free imperial cities than in territorial cities where cases originating in the countryside were tried. Witch-hunts that did occur in free imperial cities were most often sparked by accusations by very recent rural immigrants. Residents prosecuted for white magic were almost</p>

<p><em>Artisanal honor and urban politics</em> invariably rural immigrants as well. Following Max Weber, Roeck interprets the rural nature of witchcraft accusations and white magic as evidence that a process of secularization, a ‘‘disenchantment of the world,’’ was already taking place in the cities at the height of the European witch-hunt. Peasants were more prone to magical beliefs than city folk, he suggests, because they were immanently confronted by the by the vagaries of nature (weather patterns, crop failures, etc.). City folk experienced such threats only indirectly, when their food prices rose. Of course, this argument cannot be taken too far. In , the Augsburg chronicler Georg Ko¨lderer speculated that there were , witches living in Augsburg alone. The fact that apotropaic measures to prevent the return of suicides were practiced in cities is a good indication that city folk were not immune to supernatural dread surrounding suicides. But such magical fears occupied a different sphere of relevance than the complex of dishonor. To the extent that an urban environment did promote a more ‘‘rational’’ belief system, this would help explain why a secular discourse on honor and dishonor flourished in cities.</p>
<p>BASTARDY AND SEXUAL MISCONDUCT</p>
<p>We have surveyed a variety of circumstances that could precipitate a dishonor conflict. Honorable guildsmen excluded people who were born dishonorable and people who became dishonorable, whether by direct contact with the executioner or skinner, or by contact with executioners’ and skinners’ working materials, the tools of punishment, ‘‘skinner’s carrion,’’ or the corpse of a suicide. Very similar conflicts resulted when bastards tried to enter a guild. Guilds began to reject people of illegitimate birth at about the same time that they excluded dishonorable people.</p>
<p>Guild ordinances first barred bastards in northern Germany in the early fourteenth century. By the sixteenth century this was the general rule in the Empire. It is likely that most Augsburg guilds required legitimate birth by , but we cannot know for sure, since few guild records from before  have been preserved. The guilds must have militated for the exclusion of bastards, because in  the city council decreed that the guilds could not be compelled to admit illegitimate applicants. A conflict in the goldsmiths’ guild from  gives the impression that guilds had been excluding bastards for some time. In that year, the goldsmiths expelled the journeyman Johann Schebel, whose illegitimate birth had recently come to light. When Schebel protested, the goldsmiths argued that their policy to reject bastards ‘‘is an honorable tradition, not just with the goldsmiths, but with all other artisans.’’ This had been the constant practice ‘‘in human memory, yes, for a</p>

<p>Illegitimacy did not only result in the exclusion of the child. Artisans who fathered bastards could be expelled as well, since honorable guildsmen punished members for sexual misconduct. In  the goldsmiths’ guild forbade a journeyman to complete his master piece because he was guilty of fornication. The goldsmiths could cite an article in their ordinance of : ‘‘The journeymen and apprentices must behave honorably and uprightly, as is appropriate. No master shall employ those who are scoundrels, wastrels, gamblers, or who associate with disreputable women.’’ In  Augsburg’s blacksmiths boycotted their fellow tradesmen in Kaufbeuren because they had not expelled a journeyman who had slept with his master’s daughter and married her when she got pregnant. In </p>
<p>the stonemasons tried to exclude an apprentice for fathering an illegitimate child.</p>
<p>They cited their ordinance, which threatened expulsion for fornication. The apprentice married the girl and petitioned the city council to allow him to continue practicing his trade so that he could feed his family. The city government supported the apprentice and ordered the stonemasons’ guild to accept him. This precipitated a conflict that dragged on for at least nine years. The stonemasons adamantly refused to obey and even petitioned the emperor to uphold their decision. The journeymen were just as opposed to accepting the sexual offender as the masters and tried to force his exclusion in a series of strikes.</p>
<p>The plight of ‘‘fallen women’’ and unwed mothers has attracted considerable attention from historians. Infanticide has been explained as a tragic consequence of the stigma attached to bearing a bastard. The negative social consequences of unwed fatherhood are less well known. A male guild member could be expelled from his guild and thus deprived of his livelihood for sexual misconduct. The disastrous consequences the unwed father might face could cause some desperate reactions. A particularly tragic case occurred in  when Samuel Keck, a twenty-one-year-old apprentice, stabbed to death a young woman who was preg-</p>

<p><em>Artisanal honor and urban politics</em> nant with his child because she threatened to name him as the father. The following day, he turned himself in. Samuel Keck was beheaded and his body was exposed on the wheel for four weeks. Such emphasis on the sexual conduct of male guild members is an indication that a double standard of sexual morality might have been less pronounced in Germany than in other European countries. According to Mediterranean honor code, for example, a woman’s honor depended almost exclusively on her sexual conduct, as it did in Germany. But in Mediterranean regions sexual immorality did not diminish a man’s honor. To the contrary, a man’s honor was enhanced through the spoliation of another man’s daughter or wife.</p>
<p>How was the strict German sexual morality connected with the exclusion of dishonorable people? We saw in chapter  that there was little overlap between illegitimacy and legal dishonor in fact. They were associated, however, in the minds of honorable artisans. In  the printers’ society took their insistence on legitimate birth to new extremes, when they refused to accept a master’s son as an apprentice because he had been prenuptially conceived. When their patrician supervisors ordered the printers to accept the boy, an irate journeyman pasted an insulting broadsheet on the mayor’s door. The *pasquill * made some remarkable analogies between legal dishonor and illegitimacy. It insulted the patrician committee that had made this unpopular decision as a council of ‘‘skinners’ laborers’’ and condemned them for forcing the printers’ society to accept ‘‘beadles, bailiffs, and blackguards’’ ( <em>Schergen, Amtsdiener oder Stieglitzen</em>). Even though this case did not involve a legally dishonorable person, the author used the references to the dishonorable occupations of beadle and bailiff to stand for illegitimacy or prenuptial conception, which he did not mention in the *pasquill * at all.</p>
<p>The association of sexual immorality and legal dishonor also worked the other way around. When honorable artisans tried to exclude a dishonorable person they often bolstered their case by impugning the sexual morality of their opponent.</p>
<p>When the fishermen excluded Andreas Anhauser for marrying the skinner’s daughter in , they emphasized that the couple had been caught fornicating in fishermen’s huts outside the city walls. They pointed out that Anhauser’s sister had slept with her husband before they were married and had been fined for fornication.</p>
<p>For good measure, they added that his mother was evil-tongued and had not been in church in eighteen years. The fishermen sought to force Anhauser’s exclusion in this comprehensive assault on his moral integrity and that of his family.</p>

<p>offset a dishonorable background. When the glaziers in the small neighboring town of Aichach expelled the master Hans Ho¨zl in  because he had married a bailiff’s daughter, Ho¨zl argued that his wife and her family were known for their virtue and piety. The guildsmen responded that his wife came from ‘‘bailiffs’</p>
<p>stock’’ ( <em>Amtmanns Stamm</em>). Therefore, it was irrelevant if she and her father had led a pious life. Ho¨zl answered in desperation: ‘‘Why in God’s name should the pious and virtuous life that a person leads over years not help [to establish honor], even though the condition of honor itself springs from good morals and honorable conduct?’’ But Ho¨zl had missed the point. Virtue alone did not bring honor, though honor could not exist without virtue. Honorable guildsmen and their wives had to satisfy all three requirements: honorable family background, legitimate birth, and moral conduct. One did not spring from the other – together they formed an inextricable whole, which constituted the honorable estate ( <em>ehrlicher</em> <em>Stand</em>).</p>
<p>GUILD MEMBERSHIP AND SELF-IDENTITY</p>
<p>Why was it so essential for honorable guilds to exclude anyone who did not live up to these requirements? Conflicts followed much the same pattern, whether they involved the exclusion of a bailiff’s son, a bastard, a fornicator, or an artisan who had been subjected to torture or had touched ‘‘skinner’s carrion.’’ The answer lies in the nature of the guild as a social organization. A guild was much more than a purely economic association. Guilds formed corporate groups within the commune, sub-communities that shaped the guildsmen’s lives – in politics, culture, and religion as well as economics. While guilds no longer had an official voice in government – under the patrician regime they no longer sent a set number of representatives to the city council as they had before  – guilds still conferred political identity on their members. Citizenship implied guild membership and vice versa. Only citizens could enter a guild, and all new citizens had to join one of the corporate groups within the city, either an artisanal guild or a patrician or merchant society. A citizen who was not integrated in such a corporate group really had no place in the commune. He fell between the cracks of the urban social structure. The political significance of guild membership is dramatically illustrated in a dishonor conflict that took place in Ulm in . In that year, the Ulm blacksmiths expelled Martin Eberwein, a fellow master, for cutting up three piglets that had died of a disease, thus likening himself to the skinner. Shortly thereafter Ulm’s annual oath day took place. This was the day when all citizens were required to swear an oath of obedience to the urban constitution. Citizens took this oath in guild formation.</p>

<p>Stripped of his guild membership, he lost his political identity as well.</p>
<p>Guilds also structured the social and religious lives of their members. Integrated into the urban welfare system, guilds functioned as a kind of ‘‘safety net’’ for their members. When a guildsman died, fellow masters carried his body to the grave.</p>
<p>Guilds cared for members’ families. Masters’ sons could enter the guild for reduced fees. Guilds accorded privileges to journeymen who married a master’s daughter or widow. Sociability was institutionalized in regular guild meetings at which members discussed guild affairs while they shared a common meal, and in seasonal guild festivities such as guild parades during carnival or participation in Corpus Christi day processions. Guild membership touched all aspects of an individual’s life, not just his economic interests. An honorable artisan could have isolated business dealings with a person whose honor was in question. But guild membership created such a close personal bond between guild members that a dishonorable person could never be incorporated without affecting the honor of all members.</p>
<p>Birth certificates issued by the city government often used the expression</p>
<p>‘‘related to us through citizenship’’ ( <em>uns mit den bu¨rgerrechten verwant</em>), thus making an analogy between the bonds of citizenship and the bonds of kinship. The fishermen made a similar analogy between kinship and guild membership, when they explained why they could not possibly allow Andreas Anhauser to remain in their guild after he had married the skinner’s daughter. The skinner’s daughter would herself be incorporated into the guild by marriage: ‘‘If we accept the skinner’s daughter, not only she but also the children they conceive together, and all their descendants will be constantly among us, to the everlasting ridicule [of the guild]. People will say ‘This fisherman or that fishwife is the daughter of the skinner . . . or the grandchild of the skinner, and so on.’’’ To accept the skinner’s daughter would be to incorporate bad blood into the guild that would taint all guild members. This conception of the bonds of guild membership explains why the printers’ guild chose to disband rather than incorporate an applicant who was prenuptially conceived. In  the city government ordered the printers’ guild to accept such an apprentice who was prenuptially conceived. After the dispute had</p>

<p>DISHONOR IN CORPORATE SOCIETY</p>
<p>The characteristics of the guild as a social group and the close association between guild members was one factor that contributed to the social exclusiveness of the guildsmen. Equally important were the external relations of a guild with other honorable trades in the commune. Contemporaries were well aware of the significance of relations between different guilds in the city in the course of a dishonor conflict. In the dispute that resulted when the bailiff Frank tried to apprentice his sons to the goldsmiths’ guild in  and , the conflicting parties discussed the social dynamic that operated between guilds with exceptional clarity. When Frank tried to inscribe his son Hans-Jerg with the goldsmiths in , the goldsmiths refused. No bailiff’s son had learned their trade ‘‘in human memory.’’ The goldsmiths presented letters from fellow tradesmen in Nuremberg and Strasbourg: here too the goldsmiths had never incorporated a bailiff’s son. Frank retorted that other trades did not hesitate to apprentice bailiffs’ sons. If the goldsmiths got their way and excluded his son, other crafts would follow suit, for like the goldsmiths, other guilds had their ordinances, historical privileges, and customs. Other artisans did not think that they were worth any less than the goldsmiths.</p>
<p>Frank also emphasized the rights of citizenship. He requested that the authorities protect him against the insults of the goldsmiths. By insinuating that bailiffs were dishonorable, the goldsmiths had ‘‘touched his honor.’’ Frank, like all bailiffs, was a citizen, and as a citizen the authorities were obligated to protect him against insult. To preserve peace within the city was the first function of government.</p>
<p>Magistrates legitimized their authority by appealing to this cherished ideal. Insults constituted a breach of civic peace almost as serious as actual violence. Frank requested that the city government force the goldsmiths to make a formal apology.</p>
<p>If the goldsmiths’ insult went unanswered, bailiffs’ sons would soon be barred from all crafts and would be unable to earn their livelihood.</p>
<p>Not surprisingly, the goldsmiths rejected Frank’s arguments. It did not follow, they argued, that just because other artisans accepted bailiffs’ sons, the goldsmiths should do so too. Frank was obscuring distinctions within the artisanate by implying that all guilds were equal. In fact, there were great differences in status between crafts; other trades had lower standards. The goldsmiths occupied the highest rank among the artisans because they worked with gold, a very noble substance. Their trade was highly skilled and artful, and it was one of the oldest in</p>

<p></p>
<p><em>Artisanal honor and urban politics</em> Augsburg. Their high rank and honor was clearly demonstrated by their close association with Augsburg patricians. To drive home this point, the goldsmiths presented a list of all patricians who had learned their trade since .</p>
<p>Frank’s claim that the goldsmiths had insulted him was also false, the guildsmen argued. Frank had every right to demand protection against insult, but the goldsmiths had not called him dishonorable. If it constituted an insult to deny a citizen membership in a corporation, this would lead to an <em>absurdum</em>: ‘‘all artisans and subjects would be capable of joining the patrician society, because they are all citizens, and so fall under the protection of the authorities, and no one would be allowed to insult them.’’ This was a remarkable argument. The notion that common artisans should be granted access to the exclusive patrician society just because they were citizens would indeed have seemed absurd to Augsburg’s patrician magistrates. It was just as absurd, the goldsmiths implied, that a bailiff’s son be admitted to the goldsmiths’ guild. By drawing a comparison between the social exclusiveness of the patricians and of the guildsmen, they were implying that when patricians excluded non-patricians from their society and when artisans excluded applicants they defined as dishonorable, they were really doing the same thing. While this argument was sociologically astute, it might have backfired. Just as the goldsmiths objected when Frank compared them with other artisans, the patricians were perhaps not keen on hearing that their social exclusiveness was the equivalent to what they perceived as ‘‘abuses’’ on the artisanal level.</p>
<p>Aside from such sociological questions, the magistrates also had to consider the potential economic impact of the dishonor conflict, whether it was resolved one way or the other. The goldsmiths warned that if the council forced them to accept the bailiff’s son, the journeymen would strike. If the magistrates made such an ‘‘unreasonable’’ decision, they would bring economic hardship to the entire guild for the sake of one man. On the other hand, the council had to bear in mind the advice of their own legal counsel, who echoed Frank’s argument: ‘‘the other trades do not think any less of themselves. They are all in one class ( <em>Klasse</em>) and counted as artisans. None have any privileges above the rest.’’ This was an accurate assessment of constitutional reality in the city. In the Caroline reform of  the goldsmiths and all other artisans were classed as ‘‘commoners,’’ in contradistinction to the patrician ruling class. But while the constitution categorized the craftsmen as one political ‘‘class,’’ the artisanate was in fact strongly variegated socially and economically, a fact the authorities recognized in their sumptuary legislation. Augsburg’s clothing ordinances distinguished respected and artistic trades, middling trades, and common and lowly trades. The magistrates’ legal counsel recognized the basic dynamic that shaped relations among these different crafts. Artisanal corporations competed with each other for honor and precedence within the commune by means of social exclusiveness. If the goldsmiths were permitted to exclude bailiffs’ sons,</p>
<p> See, for example, the *Ernewerte Zierd- und Kleyder-Ordnung * of . StadtAA, Ratserla¨sse, –.</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>Artisans versus magistrates</em></p>
<p>lesser guilds really had no choice but to exclude them as well. This was an inexorable dynamic. If lesser guilds continued to tolerate groups excluded by high status guilds, they demonstrated that they were less sensitive to potential pollution by dishonor, laying themselves open to the charge of being indifferent to honor.</p>
<p>Guilds that continued to incorporate groups labeled as dishonorable by high status guilds, were themselves at risk of losing honor in the eyes of their fellow citizens. If the goldsmiths began to exclude bailiffs’ sons, there would soon be no guild in Augsburg willing to accept them.</p>
<p>This was a compelling argument. Bailiffs were not immigrant day-laborers who could be expelled when they were no longer needed. Bailiffs were citizens. As citizens, they and their families were entitled to social support, should they become impoverished. The magistrates’ legal advisor made another alarming prediction. If the goldsmiths succeeded in labeling the bailiffs as dishonorable, they would not stop there. Soon other municipal employees would be stigmatized. Guildsmen would begin to exclude guards at the city gates, customs officers, and nightwatchmen. Large numbers of Augsburg’s citizens might become ineligible for guild membership. Unable to earn a living, they and their families would become a burden on the urban welfare system. Dishonor threatened to spread like a social cancer. The magistrates could only contain it if they nipped artisanal pretensions in the bud.</p>
<p>These were the arguments that persuaded the council to rule in favor of the bailiff Frank. Shortly thereafter his son Hans-Jerg was inscribed as an apprentice goldsmith. His father won his case, but Hans-Jerg’s trials were only beginning. The goldsmiths pointed out that the council could force their guild to apprentice a bailiff’s son, but the council’s authority did not extend beyond the borders of the city. When the boy became a journeyman and wandered in the empire, he might well lose ‘‘life and limb.’’</p>
<p>JOURNEYMEN AS ENFORCERS OF THE HONOR CODE</p>
<p>The goldsmiths’ warning calls attention to the role of journeymen in such conflicts.</p>
<p>The goldsmiths threatened that the journeymen would strike if the bailiff’s son were inscribed. In this case, the strike did not materialize, but journeymen’s strikes were a recurring feature of dishonor conflicts over the next two centuries. Local dishonor conflicts cannot be understood apart from their regional and imperial context. The goldsmiths presented letters from the goldsmiths’ guilds in Nuremberg and Strasbourg to support their case. In each dishonor conflict, guildsmen were aware that their every action was being observed and judged by fellow tradesmen in the empire. Guildsmen were well informed about traditions and customs of fellow craftsmen in the empire, and, as a general principle, they tried to</p>

<p></p>
<p><em>Artisanal honor and urban politics</em> establish conformity between artisanal practices in different cities. Wandering journeymen played a crucial role in the development of such a common artisanal culture. They transferred information from city to city, but most importantly, journeymen were the enforcers of the artisanal honor code.</p>
<p>Journeymen’s organizations first developed in Germany in the late middle ages.</p>
<p>They emerged in Augsburg in the mid-fourteenth century. Journeymen of particular crafts formed sworn corporations that claimed legal jurisdiction over their members. Journeymen claimed the right to regulate disputes among themselves without the interference of the masters. They went beyond that, though. An early bone of contention developed between journeymen’s organizations and masters’ guilds, and between journeymen and city government, when journeymen claimed the right to discipline and fine not only their own members, but their masters as well, encroaching upon the jurisdictions of masters’ guilds and magistrates. In the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, masters’ guilds and city government made repeated attempts to suppress journeymen’s organizations, which met with little success. By the sixteenth century, guilds and magistrates accepted the existence of journeymen’s organizations, but they tried to domesticate them by integrating them into the urban hierarchy as an appendage of the masters’ guilds.</p>
<p>The masters sent representatives to journeymen’s meetings and tried to limit the jurisdiction of journeymen’s organizations over their members to minor offenses.</p>
<p>But the journeymen’s associations could never be completely integrated in the urban hierarchy, because journeymen’s mobility was the defining structural feature of their organizations. Whereas the masters’ guilds were organized locally, the journeymen’s associations were organized regionally, with local chapters in every city. The splintered political structure of the empire gave the journeymen considerable leverage. While the authority of Augsburg’s magistrates did not extend beyond the city wall, local journeymen were supported by a network of journeymen’s organizations that spread throughout the empire.</p>
<p>Journeymen’s associations provided support for journeymen on the road. When a traveling journeyman arrived in a city, he reported to the tavern of his organization, the <em>Herberge</em>. There he received a ritualized welcome during which he would have to prove that he was a member of the journeymen’s association by demonstrating his knowledge of the customs and secrets of the organization. When the newcomer had successfully completed this rite of passage, he was integrated into the group by eating and drinking with his fellow journeymen. Then the journeymen would escort the newcomer to the shop of a master who needed labor or, if no jobs were available, they provided him with some financial assistance so that he could travel on. The journeymen’s organization functioned as mediator between</p>

<p>the new arrival and masters who needed workers. This monopoly on employment enabled the organization to exercise comprehensive control over the conduct of their members. There were exact prescriptions concerning what a journeyman might wear on the street, where he should eat, and how he should deport himself in public. The journeyman tanners’ ordinance of  required journeymen to wear a cloak and dagger when they accompanied a new arrival to a master’s shop. No journeyman was allowed to step outside his master’s workshop without wearing a hat, or if his face and hands were dirty. The journeymen’s ordinance of </p>
<p>forbade journeymen to eat on the street, nor were they permitted to enter a tavern unless they were ‘‘honorably clothed.’’ Journeymen observed a ceremonial procedure at their regular meetings. Those who arrived late or who did not maintain the proper decorum were fined. Journeyman tanners were to attend the meeting wearing a cloak and dagger. The organization fined members who cursed or fought with a fellow journeyman. If a journeyman insulted another as a ‘‘mousehead’’ or</p>
<p>‘‘dog’’ he had to hand over half a week’s wages to the association. On a more serious level, the journeymen’s association punished or permanently excluded those members who had committed a dishonorable act or who had become dishonorable in some other way.</p>
<p>Journeymen had little choice but to submit to punishment by their organization, for they could not escape the jurisdiction of the journeymen’s association by leaving town. The organization blacklisted those members who left Augsburg without resolving their conflict. Their names were inscribed in a ‘‘black book’’ and the organization sent letters of denunciation to journeymen’s associations in other cities. The recalcitrant journeyman would be denied employment by associations in other cities until he returned to Augsburg to settle his affairs. Such blacklisting proved effective. The journeymen’s networks were able to keep track of the movements of individual journeyman and to maintain boycotts on a regional level.</p>
<p>Thus, for example, in  a letter of denunciation from Munich informed Augsburg’s bookbinders that one of their masters employed a bailiff’s son named Franz Antoni Halmberger. The journeyman bookbinders mounted a boycott against this master’s shop until Franz Antoni finally left town. A letter from a traveling journeyman to the journeymen’s organization in Augsburg informed the Augsburgers what had become of the dishonorable journeyman. He had traveled to St. Gallen in Switzerland with false papers and under an assumed name in an attempt to shed his dishonorable identity. But when another journeyman who had worked in Augsburg arrived in St. Gallen, Franz Antoni’s cover was blown and his</p>

<p><em>Artisanal honor and urban politics</em> dishonorable background revealed. The St. Gallen journeymen ‘‘beat him half to death and chased him away as an infamous person.’’</p>
<p>What were the dynamics between masters’ guild, journeymen’s association, and city government in dishonor conflicts? Through the control of the labor supply, the journeymen’s organization was able to exert significant pressure on the masters’</p>
<p>guild. The journeymen saw themselves as the guardians of ‘‘artisanal law and custom’’ *(Handwerksrecht und Gewohnheit)* and claimed jurisdiction over the masters to enforce it. Thus when the three master rope-makers visited the skinner’s house in , it was the journeymen’s organization that insisted on fining them.</p>
<p>One of the masters ‘‘begged the journeymen for mercy.’’ When the city government ordered the embroiderers to allow the torture victim Augustin Gerstecker to work in , the masters claimed that ‘‘as obedient citizens’’ they were willing to accept him; it was the journeymen who were disobedient. Several journeymen had already left town and spread the news of the conflict throughout the region. If the city government proceeded to force the guild to accept Augustin, the remaining journeymen would immediately go on strike and leave town. The masters had pleaded with the journeymen, the guildsmen claimed, but to no avail. A strike would bring financial ruin to the masters. Their own sons working abroad would be sent home. In an attempt to intimidate the journeymen, a committee of patricians called in the remaining journeymen and questioned each one individually and exhorted him to obey the council, but to no avail. The journeymen adamantly refused to accept Augustin. The magistrates’ guarantees that Augustin was honorable carried no weight beyond the city walls, the journeymen claimed. They were willing to be fined or imprisoned by the city government in order to avoid the sanctions of their fellow journeymen abroad. The boycott against Augustin continued until , when the authorities finally gave up. We do not know what became of Augustin after the authorities abandoned him. The city government had to admit defeat on several other occasions as well. When the governments of other cities conferred with Augsburg on the status of bailiffs’ children in artisan guilds, Augsburg’s magistrates recommended discretion, since decrees in favor of bailiffs’</p>
<p>children and other dishonorable people could not always be enforced.</p>
<p>The city government was well aware that any attempt to control the journeymen could only succeed if Augsburg coordinated its efforts with other cities and territories. In  and , the council of cities in the imperial diet passed measures to develop a common policy towards journeymen. The decision of </p>
<p>stated that when journeymen went on strike and left town, the city government should send a list of their names to governments of other cities. These governments would then blacklist the journeymen, so they would be unable to find employment.</p>

<p><em>Artisans versus magistrates</em></p>
<p>Such blacklisting would force the journeymen to return to the city they had fled and settle their conflict. In  the council of cities strengthened the original measure by adding that the names of striking journeymen would be publicly displayed in the city they were boycotting until they returned to face punishment.</p>
<p>It is clear that these governmental measures were a direct imitation of the methods the journeymen’s organizations employed to discipline their members. It will come as no surprise that governmental blacklisting proved much less effective than the journeymen’s ‘‘black book.’’ When Augsburg’s journeymen weavers went on strike to force the exclusion of Master Johann Georg Vogel, when he married a bailiff’s daughter in , Augsburg put these new measures to the test. The magistrates wrote to authorities in twenty cities throughout the empire listing the names of the fugitive journeymen. Even though most of these cities agreed to cooperate, nothing ever came of these efforts. None of the journeymen ever returned, and in Augsburg the boycott against Master Vogel continued. In spite of such failures, the imperial government continued to exhort local authorities to coordinate their efforts against journeymen. The proposal of  suggested that local governments maintain close contacts with authorities in neighboring territories to develop a uniform policy against journeymen. The police ordinance of  repeated this recommendation.</p>
<p>But until the end of the old empire such attempts at cooperation by city and territorial governments could not match the coordination, efficiency, and determination of the super-regional journeymen’s organizations.</p>
<p>The geographic mobility of journeymen and the far-flung networks of their associations meant that journeymen wandered and worked in cities and territories where the dominant religious confession differed from their own. Journeymen’s organizations achieved their greatest power in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, just when the process of confessionalization created greater cultural boundaries between the opposing religious camps. And yet journeymen did not allow confessional differences to undermine solidarity within their organizations.</p>
<p>Confessional differences did create social boundaries within the artisanal milieu.</p>
<p>After the Thirty Years’ War, for example, it was customary in Augsburg for wandering journeymen to take jobs only with masters of their own confession. But this rule was not etched in stone. Individual masters continued to employ journeymen of the opposing confession. Protestant master tanners especially, for reasons that remain unclear, frequently employed Catholic journeymen. Journeymen’s organizations incorporated both Catholics and Protestants, but the confessions formed subgroups within the larger association. The constitutional principle of confessional parity was applied to journeymen’s organizations, requiring the two confessional groups to each elect two representatives. These four journeymen, two Catholics, two Protestants, formed the institutional leadership of the journeymen’s</p>

<p><em>Artisanal honor and urban politics</em> organization. Some trades set up separate craft hostels for Protestant and Catholic journeymen. But other guilds maintained a single hostel. In ‘‘bi-confessional’’</p>
<p>hostels confessional parity was maintained by ‘‘alternating’’ the position of tavern-keeper, the ‘‘hostel-father,’’ between Catholics and Protestants. When the ‘‘hostel-father’’ was a Catholic, he was obligated to feed Protestants meat on Catholic fast days.</p>
<p>Confessional differences clearly had an impact in journeymen’s daily life. When conflicts arose that threatened journeymen’s collective interests, however, confession fell by the wayside. Confessional allegiance had no discernible impact on journeymen’s reaction to dishonor pollution. In guild correspondence on dishonor conflicts, the confession of litigants is never noted, in itself an indication that confession was not a factor. However, it is sometimes possible to deduce the likely confession of journeymen by their place of origin, which was usually noted in their interrogations. During the conflict over the expulsion of the embroiderer Augustin Gerstecker, for example, thirty-seven of his fellow journeymen were questioned.</p>
<p>Twelve were local. Two came from neighboring free imperial cities such Dinkelsbu¨hl and Kaufbeuren, like Augsburg bi-confessional cities. Two came from Lu</p>
<p>¨ beck, one from Tu¨bingen, one from Hamburg (all Lutheran), two from Krakau (Catholic), three from Austria (Catholic), seven from Saxony (Lutheran), three from Bavaria (Catholic), three from Silesia (Lutheran), and one from Moravia (Catholic). Of course it is only possible to guess the confession of individual journeymen, but the varied geographic origins of the journeymen make it all but certain that this was a confessionally heterogeneous group. And yet the journeymen remained unified. Despite massive intimidation tactics by their patrician lords, no cracks appeared in journeymen solidarity.</p>
<p>During dishonor conflicts, masters presented themselves as helpless victims of their journeymen, but these petitions were less than sincere. Certainly masters could not control the journeymen’s organizations any more than the city government could, but the interests of masters and journeymen overlapped in dishonor conflicts. The masters were just as opposed to incorporating a dishonorable member as the journeymen were. But their young unmarried transient journeymen were in a far better position to disobey the city government than the married masters and citizens with permanent residence. In a sense, the role of the journeymen in dishonor conflicts is comparable to the role of male youth groups in charivaris in rural society. Natalie Davis has pointed out that male youth groups used charivaris to enforce behavioral norms that the entire village held in common.</p>
<p>As young men enforced community norms, they internalized them. The village</p>
<p>‘‘socialized [the young males] to the conscience of the community by making them</p>

<p><em>Artisans versus magistrates</em></p>
<p>the raucous voice of that conscience.’’ In the city the situation was somewhat more complicated; the young artisans were not enforcing norms shared by the entire community, only by the guildsmen. But like young men in rural society, the journeymen learned the artisanal code of conduct as they enforced it. When glazier master Hans Ho¨zl married a bailiff’s daughter in , his fellow masters taunted him: perhaps he had heard as a wandering journeyman that it was a uniform custom throughout the empire to exclude bailiffs and their children from honorable guilds? The years of journeymanship were a period of socialization in which young artisans learned the group rules of the guild.</p>
<p>That masters and journeymen shared the same ideas on honor and dishonor is apparent in a number of dishonor conflicts. When the locksmiths of Ulm sought to exclude a master who had allegedly served his journeymen ‘‘skinner’s carrion’’ for dinner in , the masters actually paid the journeymen’s debts at their tavern, so that they could leave town before the city government arrested them. When the Augsburg bookbinders forbade the bailiff’s son Franz Antoni Halmberger to work as a journeyman in , the collusion between masters and journeymen was especially apparent. Under the guise of going on a pilgrimage, a group of masters and journeymen set off together to the Bavarian monastery town of Andechs, Franz Antoni’s home town, in order to expose his dishonorable background. After the journeyman bookbinders went on strike and left town, the masters petitioned the city government to exclude the bailiff’s son quickly since the labor shortage could drive them into bankruptcy. But the masters met with little sympathy from the council. The masters had paid their journeymen their back wages all too readily, the magistrates declared. They had allowed the journeymen to leave town without notifying the authorities. These examples make clear that in dishonor conflicts the journeymen generally were not striking against their masters. They were striking against the city government’s intervention in what they considered internal guild affairs, and often enough the masters had put them up to it.</p>
<p>DISHONOR POLLUTION AND GENDER</p>
<p>Protecting guild honor also involved the exclusion of female interlopers in the workshop. In the course of the early modern period, guilds imposed a rigid sexual division of labor in craft production. Fourteenth-and fifteenth-century guild ordinances mentioned female masters who trained both male and female apprentices. By the mid-fifteenth century, however, all mention of female masters or female apprentices had disappeared. Instead, guild ordinances introduced new restrictions on the right of masters’ widows to continue running the shop. Guildsmen limited the number of apprentices or journeymen widows might employ, or</p>

<p><em>Artisanal honor and urban politics</em> mandated that they work alone or only for a brief period after their husbands’</p>
<p>death. The exclusion of female labor was a sign of high status. In , Augsburg’s goldsmiths expressed their claim to honor by emphasizing the inability of women to comprehend the mysteries of their craft. Conversely, a high proportion of female labor among linen-weavers might have contributed to their dishonorable status in some areas of the empire.</p>
<p>As guild masters tried to close down widows’ shops, journeymen militated for the exclusion of masters’ wives, daughters, and maidservants from the production process. To work next to a woman would taint a journeyman’s honor. In their efforts to expel women, journeymen resorted to the same boycotts they used to exclude dishonorable people. In , for example, Frankfurt’s hat-makers refused to employ journeymen from Fulda, because the guild there still used female labor.</p>
<p>Journeymen avoided regions where women were not expelled from the workshop.</p>
<p>German journeymen hat-makers, for example, did not wander to the Netherlands, because masters there still employed female servants in production.</p>
<p>Journeymen distanced themselves from women socially as well as sexually.</p>
<p>Contact with prostitutes is a case in point. Despite the fact that prostitutes were</p>
<p>‘‘dishonorable women’’ ( <em>unerbare Frauen</em>), it was perfectly acceptable, indeed expected, for journeymen to frequent the city brothel in the pre-Reformation period. The civic brothel provided the only legitimate sexual outlet for unmarried journeymen. But the brothel offered more than sex. Like a tavern, it provided space where journeymen could eat, drink, gamble, and socialize with workmates. Just how important the brothel was to journeymen’s culture is illustrated in a petition by Basel guildsmen from . When Basel wanted to shut down its brothel as part of an evangelical morals campaign, the masters opposed the closure, for ‘‘otherwise we would not be able to practice our trade for want of journeymen, who would shun our city for this reason.’’ But the close relationship between journeymen and prostitutes was already changing several decades before the Reformation. As prostitutes became increasingly stigmatized in the last years of the fifteenth century, guilds demonstrated their claim to honor by limiting journeymen’s sociability with prostitutes. Late fifteenth-century guild ordinances forbade journeymen to dance or drink with prostitutes. The ordinance of the Schlettstadt tailors stigmatized the brothel as dishonorable space. Masters (though not journeymen) were forbidden to set foot in it, or in the house of a Jew or a skinner. These restrictions</p>

<p><em>Artisans versus magistrates</em></p>
<p>did not yet prohibit sexual contacts for journeymen, but to have a prostitute</p>
<p>‘‘hanging about him’’ posed a threat to an artisan’s honor. In the second half of the sixteenth century, sexual contact was forbidden as well, which further illustrates the role male sexual conduct came to play in guild honor in the course of the early modern period. When brothels were closed down during the Reformation and Counter-Reformation, journeymen no longer socialized in mixed company, but spent their free time in the all-male milieu of the craft hostel.</p>
<p>This ‘‘masculinization’’ of work and sociability, as Merry Wiesner has argued, made ‘‘male bonding’’ a defining feature of journeymen’s organizations. Guild honor became ‘‘honor among <em>men</em>, an honor which linked men together and excluded women.’’ This homosocial nature of German guild culture may explain why so few of the dishonor conflicts documented in Augsburg’s guild records involved women. No case is preserved in which an artisan was labeled as dishonorable for working next to a woman, or for frequenting a prostitute. This is most likely due to the fact that the bulk of Augsburg’s guild records date from after .</p>
<p>By this time the exclusion of female labor had already been accomplished in many trades, and legalized prostitution was a thing of the past. Lyndal Roper has shown that after the municipal brothel was shut down in , the city government no longer recognized prostitution as a trade, or saw prostitutes as a distinct class of women. Instead, prostitution was just an extreme form of sexual sin that all women were liable to commit. As government policies towards sex crime changed, prostitutes were no longer a clearly identifiable group. Guilds penalized masters and journeymen for fornication and adultery, but the women they were accused of sleeping with were not prostitutes; they were typically serving women, often themselves from the artisanal milieu.</p>
<p>The women most frequently involved in dishonor conflicts in Augsburg and neighboring cities were women of dishonorable stock, i.e. the daughters, granddaughters, or widows of defiled tradesmen. Official correspondence did not refer to them as ‘‘dishonorable women’’ ( <em>unerbare Frauen</em>), a term that specifically implied prostitution or sexual dishonor. Instead, they were simply called ‘‘the daughter of a bailiff,’’ or ‘‘the daughter of a skinner.’’ Occasionally, a guildsmen who married a woman of dishonorable stock argued that he, as a man, could not be defiled by a woman. After his marriage to a bailiff’s daughter in , weaver master Vogel contended that such a marriage did not dishonor the man, since the trade was not passed on in the female line, and women did ‘‘not desire to train apprentices, much less to wander in the trade.’’ In other words, Vogel claimed that the sexual</p>

<p><em>Artisanal honor and urban politics</em> division of labor insulated male artisans from pollution by women of dishonorable stock. In , glazier master Ho¨zl offered a similar, if more eloquent argument, after he had been expelled from his guild for marrying a bailiff’s daughter: ‘‘The woman does not dishonor the man. Instead, the man dishonors the woman, since he is the head . . . the woman receives honors and dignities from the man, just as the moon receives its light from the sun.’’ Predictably, this argument fell on deaf ears. The glaziers responded that according to Ho¨zl’s lunar logic, artisans could marry skinners’ daughters – an <em>absurdum absurdissimum</em>. Honorable guildsmen insisted that dishonor was transmitted by marriage and by blood in both the male and the female line.</p>
<p>In all other contexts, however, women seemed to play only a peripheral role in dishonor pollution. Sociability with dishonorable men frequently sparked dishonor conflicts within guilds, but sociability with women of dishonorable stock seemed to pose little threat to artisanal honor. Of all dishonor conflicts documented in Augsburg guild records, only one was precipitated by inappropriate sociability with a woman of dishonorable stock. This case occurred in  when the retailer Georg Schmidt was banished for allowing a military preacher quartered in his home to drink in the company of the executioner’s wife Barbara Metz, without alerting him to her presence. Sharing wine with the executioner’s wife dishonored the preacher and his regiment. In this instance, sociability with a woman from an executioner’s clan did defile an honorable man. But Barbara Metz’s astonished reaction reveals that this case was the exception that proved the rule. ‘‘She is surprised that this affair has caused such conflict, especially since she is only a woman . . .’’ She was present at the invitation of Schmidt’s wife to join a group of women in a sewing circle. Another case illustrates how unproblematic even prolonged personal contact with a woman of dishonorable blood could be. In  a master glazier from Dinkelsbu</p>
<p>¨ hl was embroiled in a dishonor conflict because he wanted to marry his maidservant, the granddaughter of a beadle. The woman had served in his home for years before this case erupted. To employ the granddaughter of a beadle as a maidservant within his home did not defile the glazier’s honor. Only when he wanted to marry her did her dishonor became relevant. Clearly, the boundary of honor ran differently depending on the gender of the dishonorable person. It would have been unthinkable for the glazier to employ the grandson of a beadle as a journeyman.</p>

However, their transgression was entering the dishonorable *space * of the skinner’s house. Contact with the skinner’s wife was mentioned only as an aside.

<p><em>Artisans versus magistrates</em></p>
<p>little import? Part of the answer is that female sociability in general had less public significance than male sociability. Men in groups demonstrated corporate and political identity and honor by means of sociability. They formed what Ann Tlusty has called a ‘‘drinking society of orders.’’ Membership in the ‘‘Lords’ Drinking Room’’ ( <em>Herrentrinkstube</em>), for example, signified patrician status. Guilds that could afford to rent a private room in a tavern for their guild meetings had a greater claim to honor than those who held their meetings in the general public room of the tavern.  There was no female equivalent of the institutionalized sociability by which male corporate groups expressed their social identity. Women might form sewing circles, such as the one the executioner’s wife attended in . That such female gatherings had no public or political significance is revealed by the fact that the other women present, presumably also from the artisanal milieu, were not charged with inappropriate sociability. They were not dishonored by their association with the executioner’s wife. Dishonor pollutions sparked by ritual transgression – killing a dog, skinning carrion, etc. – almost never involved women. Either women did not commit these acts, or their transgressions were more likely to go unnoticed and unpunished.</p>
<p>Dishonor conflicts were thus overwhelmingly played out among men. Dishonor pollution was produced by male transgressions in the male realms of sociability and work. Dishonor pollution had nothing to do with specifically female impurities, such as pollution associated with menstruation or birth. The ‘‘maleness’’ of German dishonor pollution presents yet another contrast to pollution beliefs in non-Western cultures. For example, caste pollution in India results, in Louis Dumont’s words, from ‘‘the irruption of the biological into social life.’’ Organic events such as death, excretion, menstruation, or birth confer temporary impurity on persons who experience them, and permanent impurity on professionals who specialize in handling these events, e.g. undertakers, latrine-cleaners, and midwives. Birth and menstrual pollution accounts for the untouchable status of washermen who clean the soiled linens. In early modern Germany, however, where women did the washing, impurities associated with birth and menstruation were not relevant to the pollution of defiled trades. Menstruation, pregnancy, and birth did put women in a polluted state, but these impurities seem to have been religious in nature. Drawing on Leviticus, church law forbade sexual intercourse with menstruating women. The medieval church forbade women to enter a church</p>
<p> Such high status guilds were known as <em>Geschenkte Handwerke</em>, i.e. crafts with a <em>Schenke</em>, a drinking room. Lesser guilds were called <em>ungeschenkte Handwerke</em>. B.

<p><em>Artisanal honor and urban politics</em> or to receive Holy Communion during their period. Such official prohibitions were no longer in effect during the early modern era, but menstruation continued to inspire anxiety. According to popular belief, sex with a menstruating woman would result in a monstrous birth. The gaze of a menstruating woman might dim a mirror, and, according to Paracelsus, milk would sour in her presence. Such fears amounted to a ‘‘taboo;’’ contact with menstrual blood was believed to have tangible effects in the material world. It is unclear, however, to what extent such a</p>
<p>‘‘menstrual taboo’’ was observed in practice. The fact that brothel-keepers tried to force prostitutes to have sex during their periods, indicates that clients were not repulsed at the idea of sleeping with a menstruating woman. Giving birth also placed women in a state of impurity. New mothers were cleansed in the liturgical ceremony of ‘‘churching’’ in which the priest sprinkled them with holy water.</p>
<p>Midwives participated in this purification ritual, another indication that in Germany, unlike India, midwifery was not considered a defiled trade. Female-specific pollution had nothing to do with early modern German dishonor, which was male-centered and secular. No amount of holy water could cleanse a defiled tradesman of his dishonor.</p>
<p>Women were thus peripheral to German dishonor, in ideology and symbolism, and in social practice. To say, however, that dishonor pollution was rarely <em>about</em> women, and that women were rarely the principal actors in dishonor conflicts, does not mean that women remained passive in such disputes. When a number of master tailors climbed onto the scaffold during an execution in , one of their wives managed to head off the dishonor conflict before it began. She stopped the guild foremen in the street and pleaded with them to punish her husband, ‘‘because her children were already hearing about it.’’ The foremen fined the offenders, who willingly submitted to the guild’s judgment. The guildsmen spent the fine in a common drinking bout; the offending masters were reconciled. The only reason any record of this incident exists, is that the magistrates saw the hefty fine the guild imposed as an infringement of governmental sovereignty. This case gives an idea of artisans’ discretion in handling such cases; dishonor pollution could be neutralized before it ever provoked a formal response. Such low-level conflicts left no trace in the archives, but most likely occurred far more frequently than the full-blown dishonor conflicts documented in the records. The fact that children of dishonored masters suffered harassment was typically not discussed in more formal</p>

<p>proceedings. The case is also suggestive of a sexual division of labor in containing dishonor pollution in daily life. David Sabean has identified gendered networks of gossip and social control in rural society. A witchcraft accusation could circulate</p>
<p>‘‘in the village as ‘Weibergeschwa¨tz’ (female gossip), a form of public gossip that neither men nor the pastor would have to pay formal attention to.’’ But when a man made the accusation, ‘‘it went from mere *Geschwa¨tz *(gossip) to *Sage *(knowledge) . . .’’ When the denunciation had reached this level, it could only be resolved in court. The intervention of the tailor’s wife seems to reveal a similar pattern in the artisanal milieu. As long as dishonor conflicts remained at an informal level, it appears they could be discussed and resolved through the mediation of women.</p>
<p>CONCLUSION</p>
<p>In this chapter we have surveyed the motivations and tactics of guild masters, journeymen, and their patrician governors. The goal of limiting economic competition does not provide a satisfactory explanation of guild artisans’ pursuit of</p>
<p>‘‘dove-like-purity.’’ Dishonor conflicts could be triggered by a variety of circumstances. A person could be disqualified from guild membership by birth, as the child of a dishonorable person or as a bastard, by voluntary association or involuntary contact with an executioner or skinner or their working materials, or by sexual misconduct. Artisans did not distinguish between conduct and condition. Honor formed a complex, an inextricable whole. Honorable family background, legitimate birth, and honorable conduct were indispensable requirements. Honorable conduct implied more than sexual morality and virtuous behaviour; honorable artisans had to be careful not to violate ritual pollution rules. Artisans seemed to interpret honor in materialistic, bodily terms. Honor was fragile and could be ‘‘broken’’ by a polluting <em>touch</em>, by physical contact with the executioner, the skinner, or their working materials. Once honorable artisans decided that a person had become dishonorable – whether by marrying a bailiff’s daughter or coming under the executioner’s hands during torture – that person’s motivation, guilt, or innocence were irrelevant. The polluting action was effective in and of itself, <em>ex opere operato</em>, regardless of moral intention. Dishonor was a form of secular pollution, not a</p>
<p>‘‘taboo’’ reinforced by supernatural sanction. The guildsmen who strove to preserve the ‘‘dove-like-purity’’ of their trade were confessionally mixed. Their religious differences were not a factor in dishonor conflicts. It seems likely that honor and the exclusion of dishonorable people were so central to artisanal culture, precisely *because * guildsmen were religiously divided. Guilds no longer formed sacral communities as they had before the Reformation, but artisanal honor offered</p>

<p><em>Artisanal honor and urban politics</em> a new unifying ethos, a point of connection between opposing confessional camps.</p>
<p>The nature of the guild as a social organization, the close bonds between guild members analogous to the bonds of kinship, contributed to the social exclusiveness of guildsmen. Equally important were interactions of guildsmen with other corporate groups within the city, and with their fellow tradesmen in the empire. Guilds were engaged in constant competition for honor and precedence within the commune. Honor and prestige were not static or fixed characteristics. Artisans tried to move up or avoid moving down the prestige hierarchy within the artisanate by practicing social exclusiveness. The same competitive mechanism that governed relations between corporate groups within the city also shaped the relations between guilds in different cities. Conflicts between Augsburg’s guildsmen and their fellow tradesmen in different cities did not only affect the particular guild involved in the conflict, it affected the city as a whole. In their petition to exclude Anhauser for marrying the skinner’s daughter, the fishermen emphasized that this case did not concern them alone. The conflict put at risk ‘‘the reputation and good name of the entire city and all artisans who work within it.’’ If the fishermen were forced to accept Anhauser, artisans in other cities would say ‘‘in Augsburg skinners’</p>
<p>children are accepted into honorable trades.’’ The outcome of local dishonor conflicts was determined, in part, by their regional and imperial context.</p>
<p>The city government was in an unenviable position when a dishonor conflict erupted within the city. The councilors had to balance competing interests in order to restore harmony and civic peace to the commune. They had to consider the economic interests of the guildsmen. If they forced the guild to accept a dishonorable candidate, the journeymen would almost certainly strike. A long-term strike had disastrous economic consequences for the guild. Honorable guildsmen appealed to the common weal: would the magistrates sacrifice the guildsmen, all of them citizens and heads of households, for the sake of one dishonorable individual?</p>
<p>On the other hand, the magistrates were well aware of the dynamic of competition that operated between corporate groups and between cities, and the resulting tendency of dishonor conflicts to escalate. If the government did not succeed in containing dishonor to the core group of executioners and skinners, then artisans would apply the label of dishonor ever more widely. A growing number of people would become ineligible for guild membership. Unintegrated into the political and economic structure of the city, unable to earn their livelihood, these groups would present a growing social problem.</p>
<p>However the councilors resolved such dilemmas, dishonor conflicts confronted Augsburg’s patrician governors with the limits of their own power. Their jurisdiction ended at the city walls. The high geographic mobility of journeymen and their network of associations throughout the empire made it impossible for the magistrates to control them, and masters and journeymen took full advantage of this</p>

<p>situation. They knew that Augsburg’s patrician regime could not rule by decree; the magistrates had to establish some sort of consensus with their guildsmen. The fragmented political structure of the empire allowed Augsburg’s guildsmen to assert their claims to honor aggressively. In Mack Walker’s memorable phrase, the empire was an ‘‘incubator’’ that allowed Germany’s distinctive artisanal culture to flourish more or less unchecked.</p>
