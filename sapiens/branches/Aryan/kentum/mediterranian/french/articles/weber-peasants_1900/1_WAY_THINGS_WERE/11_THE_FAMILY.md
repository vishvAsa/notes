## Marriage
> Marie-toi, ne te marie pas,  
> Pour sur, tu t'en repentiras. 

> Will you marry, yea or nay?  
> You'll regret it either way. 

### Family primacy
MARRIAGE WAS ONE of the great social occasions of traditional French society, a vast feast, with as many as 500 guests, for all of them one of the rare breaks in a routine of hard and weary work and frequent privation. But marriage was not just an occasion for socializing, for reaffirming bonds of friendship, kinship, and social obligation. It was an alliance that concerned far more than two individuals-two clans and the whole of the society they lived in were affected by their arrangements.+++(4)+++ 

Witness the traditional donnages practiced in Lorraine and elsewhere, at which the village youth group proclaimed who was to couple off with whom. Couplings were no private matter.1 

"There are no friends in the countryside," writes Henri Mendras (that is, no strong relationships based on private choice), “only relatives or neighbors.”+++(5)+++ Be it distant or vague, it was kinship that counted, the bond, in the absence of many others that we are trained to recognize today, that commanded association, visits, intercessions, favors: 

> "We must sell to him, buy from him, deal with him,... he is of the family."+++(5)+++ 

Hence the attention weddings received, and the variety of ritual with which they were surrounded. The wedding was above all a business arrangement, both between families, which assessed the compatibility and worth of their proposed allies very carefully, and between two individuals who entered a partnership.+++(4)+++ Hence the preliminaries that, while using a variety of devices to avoid giving offense and making enemies in a narrow world where every gesture counted with people one would frequent all of one's life, made courting couples sound exceedingly businesslike. +++(4)+++

### Wealth
Pierre Dupont's Peasant's Serenade has the courting hero marry Denise, beautiful as the day, but above all, "worth five dowries put together."+++(4)+++ Dupont was a petit bourgeois from Lyon, schooled and hence presumably romantic enough to pay mind to very secondary considerations. But beauty counted little when a wife was weighed. As peasant wisdom had it, 

> land marries turds and money marries the ugly  
> ("terre marie merde et l'argent marie peute gens").+++(5)+++

[[168]]


More characteristic than Dupont's suitor would be the Vendean who woos his intended with food, and exchanges confidences with her about their respective worth: his oxen and his plow, her frantically reproductive chickens.\* 

> I li parlis de ma charrue et de mes boeufs, 
A m'disait que tot' ses poules pougnant doux oeufs. O faut donc bé, ma megnoune, nous marier tos deux. Faisons donc vite tielle besogne, si tu o voeux. 

If the material claims proved true and there was no higher bid, the deal should have raised no problems. The families, of course, had the last word, and the first too, most often.+++(4)+++ One married a family, not a woman or a man.+++(4)+++ As the phrase goes, one married "into a family"-and when or before one did it, the families did the marrying. 

### Sobriquets
A family might be almost the total population of a commune. Between 1876 and 1936 the number of communes with a population between 100 and 200 almost doubled, from 3,295 to 6,158; the number of those with populations below 100 increased fourfold, from 653 to 2,512. This helps explain the prevalence of sobriquets, essential to discriminate between so many households bearing the same name. "There is not a family in our villages," noted Father Gorse in 1895, "without its sobriquet." 

Many were nicknames, of course, but many referred to houses. The Great House of earlier times had its humbler reflection, and Pierre Dupont might have been dubbed Pierre of the Mill or of the Gulch or of the Four-Acre-Farm, the better to tell him from his many cousins. 

The choice of a spouse was thus quite seriously limited, and the traditional and natural prejudice against marrying outside the community made the choice narrower still. The three-score years after 1876 are only relatively characteristic of earlier days, because they were the heyday of rural emigration. But the period does give a hint of what must have been, and what continued to be, though (as we shall see) increasingly mitigated by mobility and collapsing taboos. 

### Inbreeding
Yet, in such circumstances, intercourse among close relatives must have been rampant, leading to some number of mental and physical deficiencies, which may well have grown as the ablest and most enterprising left the village community for cities. 

Placide Rambaud has found that in Maurienne, because of the shrinking mountain population and the new opportunities to emigrate, inbreeding increased in the 30 years before the First World War, rising from 47.7 percent of marriages in 1884-1903 to 55.2 percent in 1913. The rate of intermarriage then fell again after the area opened up in 1914-18.6 

Despite timid warnings ("When cousins marry the race goes to pot," they said in Hérault and the southwest), both family interests and deep-rooted prejudices encouraged the selection of a spouse as close to home as possible."+++(4)+++

anyone who

There was the pressure of laws and taxes that threatened family property and suggested the need for arrangements to maintain it or patch together again what had been put asunder. But there was also the intense cohesion that made families reluctant to admit into the protected and protective circle was not thoroughly known, and that made young people pleased to marry kin or neighbor whose comings and goings they had always seen. 

### Stress and alienation
Marrying out was horrid. Entry into a strange household was a harrowing experience in itself.+++(5)+++ An in-law was accepted only in part, as well as with ill-grace: 

> El o écri su lou cu di chi  
Qe jémâ janr n'o évu bï El o écri su lou tro di cu  
Qe jémâ bel mer n'éma bru. 

Proverbs attest to it. Sons-in-law and daughters-in-law were marked strangers:  
“Janr è bru son jan d'ôtru," or  
"Tout genre et toute bru sont des gens d'autru." 

Hence:  
"A son-in-law's friendship is like the winter's sun"; or  
"My daughter's dead, farewell my son-in-law."\* 

If marrying into a family one knew was such an ordeal, then marrying among strangers was decidedly worse.+++(4)+++  
Where each community was a law to itself, in-laws unfamiliar with its customs, ways, and turns of speech felt and were made to feel even more like strangers. 

### Off with strangers
Self-interest and traditional prejudice interpenetrated. Villagers resented all strangers who moved in, because their presence would weigh on the use of commons and encroach on the communal right to cut wood.+++(4)+++ And just as at Broye-les-Pesmes (Haute-Saône) potential buyers of land who came from the outside were intimidated and discouraged, so in most places spouses from outside the community were put off by every means, including violence.+++(4)+++ Some of the numerous fights between the youth of neighboring villages were sparked by attempts to poach on local preserves; village girls seem to have joined in, and no doubt for similar motives: in a restricted marriage market, loss of one potential spouse threatened the prospects of either sex. 

[[8]]

Of course, male activities were more visible (and audible). At Saint-Bueil (Isère) a locally composed song of the 1870's shed scorn on local girls who frequented lads of other villages, or even worse, the despised "Savoyaux." The song was adapted for use in other villages of the region, and girls who dared transgress the explicit prohibition had their faces blackened with shoe polish or, more often, soot. Obviously, at this stage other girls must have played a part in the proceedings. 

On a more solemn note, we find the village women of Sourribes, near Sisteron, greeting any strange bride at the entrance to the village with a monitory speech, after which they made her swear on the fattest book they had been able to lay their hands on-which was supposed to represent the Bible-that she would not try to be worth more than her fellows.+++(4)+++ 

\* Charles Perron, Proverbes de la Franche-Comté, p. 53; Barbizier, 1950, p. 358. To cut bread into tiny pieces was to cut it the way a mother-in-law would: "Vou fat da briq de bél-mer." More revealing, in the cemetery of Minot (Côte-d'Or) couples from families that owned separate tombs in the end rejoined their blood kin: husband and wife were separated in death (Françoise Zonabend, "Les Morts et les vivants," pp. 13-14). 

[[170]]

THE WAY THINGS WERE 

Rather less, one would assume. In such circumstances, it was reasonable that (to use Martine Ségalen's term) socioprofessional endogamy should so long remain the predominant matrimonial model." 

Family interest and collective ideals remained crucial in determining what made a good husband or a good wife, suggestive and highly restrictive while their hold endured. "If you marry take a rake [used to gather hay], not a pitchfork [used to spread it]."  
"Beauty can't be eaten with a spoon."  
"There is no shoe so fine that it doesn't get down at the heel."  
"An ugly cat has pretty kittens."  
And an admonition rather seldom heeded:  
"To beat one's wife is to beat one's purse." 

## Feuds
But collective notions of the necessity of family solidarity did not prevent family feuds. Since every marriage was first and foremost a business arrangement turning on the bride's dowry-seen as a compensation for the woman's loss of rights to her family's land but also as an endowment that gave her claims on her new family's wealth-there could be endless conflicts; and there were indeed, arising out of this and out of inheritances. Proximity, which made for confidence (meaning no more than familiarity), also made for conflict.+++(4)+++ 

As an ex-country boy remembered of the Mantois, with some notable exceptions families did not see much of each other, divided as they often were "by interminable lawsuits concerning party rights, joint property, apportionment of land, and boundary disputes, which gave rise to secret grudges and tenacious hates."+++(4)+++ Intermittent violence and brutality, mutual exploitation or indifference, must have been as much a part of life inside the home as outside it. 

## Meals
Meals were brief and silent, little occasion for communion: "few words are exchanged." Mutual interest seldom went beyond interest plain. Spouse, offspring, kin were not company or companions, but aids. When not of use, children and the elderly sick were simply a burden for the family, wrote Charles Perron about Broye-les-Pesmes: "One made for them the least sacrifices that one could." And "people and things were evaluated only in terms of their material worth."10 

## Children
Children there were aplenty, at least for a good while, and so the loss of one was no particular blow, noted the Board of Hygiene of Haute-Vienne in its report for the decade ending in 1866. We are still in the age when from Forli's walls Caterina Sforza shouted to the besiegers who threatened to put to death six of her children they held hostage: "Fools! You've only to look to see that I can make others!" Infants and tots were expendable commodities. 

\* Perron, Proverbes, p. 53. A wedding song, very popular in the central Pyrenees, stipulated that the notary drawing up the marriage contract should write on his blue (official) paper that the husband must not beat his wife: "Bouto, noutari, sul papiè blu / Que non la bate pas, sigur. / Bouto, noutari, sul papié / Que non la bate pas jamès." (Robert Jalby, Le Folklore du Languedoc, p. 84.) 

+ Archives Départementales, Haute-Vienne M 1047, Rapport du conseil départemental d'hygiène, 1865-1866, p. 26. Nicole Castan has found no evidence in eighteenth-century Languedoc of any particular interest in or affection for children, at least among those lower classes "that would be last to show signs of [such feelings]." Children, the newborn in particular, were treated "with as much indifference as in the past": they were referred to as "créatures," so that in the records their sex is not evident; their ages and birthdays were only vaguely noted, even by the mother ("6 or 8 months, II years old or 14"); the death of illegitimate children was welcomed. (See the discussion in André Abbiateci, ed., Crimes et criminalité en France sous l'Ancien Régime, Paris, 1971, pp. 96-97.) Much of this was still valid a century later, except that by then "créatures" were more obviously female. See Marguerite Audoux on her childhood as pupille de l'assistance publique in the care of Sologne farmers, for whom she guarded cattle: "non pas malheureuse: pire." "You're cold?-Work hard, you'll get warm. You're hungry?- There's a potato left in the dresser.... And then a slap here, a slap there, not out of crueltymais il faut bien dresser les enfants." (Interview quoted in Henry Poulaille, Nouvel age littéraire, Paris, 1930, p. 256.)

The Family 

[[171]]

Their upbringing, sporadically indulgent, left them great freedom to run around unsupervised once out of swaddling clothes, and thus to maim themselves. But there would be little pity: "To grow, one has to cry. Cry, you'll piss less!"+++(5)+++ 

### Labor
As soon as their growth permitted, between five or six and eight, children would be put to work-guarding chickens or geese, lending a hand with cattle, fetching and carrying-before a regular task or hiring out, at ten or so, integrated them fully into the adult world.11 

[[11]]

## Female labor
Women worked harder and they were less free. "It is for women to work for men. My wife, I've only taken her so that she can work." Worn out after having toiled right through the second or third birth, which was often managed largely unassisted, wives were beasts of burden seldom set to rest.+++(4)+++ 

Father Gorse has a searing chapter devoted to the slavery of women after marriage, never ending besounhas (a word that means both labor and trouble), never sitting down; and to the hostile suspicions that men entertained toward them. The Church's old-established view of women as potential vessels of sin and of temptation was steadfastly maintained. Women were forbidden to sing in church, and their periodic "uncleanness" was consecrated by a variety of rites.12 

## Misogyny
Simple menfolk could find here confirmation of their engrained prejudice. And prejudice was rife and vocal.\* Of a pretty girl one might well say she would make a good cow. But a good goat, a good mule, and a good woman made three spiteful sorry beasts. No saws or proverbs did women honor. All slighted or criticized them: "Gambling, wine, and women are three great destroyers." Or insisted on male supremacy: "Where the cock sings the hens are silent”; “The purse holds the crest" (only men hold the purse!). Or stressed the disillusions of marriage: "After courting, famine"; "If you want to break in the wolf, marry it."18 

## Marital Inequality in practice
Women ate standing up, serving the men and completing their meal later on what was left. This may have been purely practical, though the serving process could not have been a big job; but other evidence suggests that it was one more symbol of the stubborn division of the sexes, after marriage. In Corrèze couples never walked side by side.  



\*Could the prejudice have been heightened by resentment born of enforced celibacy? On the whole, the poorer the region the lower the proportion of people that ever got married-under 50 percent in Hautesand Basses-Alpes, Aveyron, Cantal, Côtes-du-Nord, Doubs, Finistère, Ille-et- Vilaine, Haute-Loire, Loire-Inférieure, Lozère, Manche, Morbihan, Hautesand Basses-Pyrénées, and Haute-Saône right through the century. 

[[172]]

THE WAY THINGS WERE 

If the man walked ahead, the woman followed behind at a distance of at least 30 or 35 steps; or it could have been vice versa. But even for Sunday mass, one left before the other: “Tirats, davoun, ou ieu?" (Will you go first, or me?)+++(5)+++ It was a division downward: in Marche, Berry, and the Maine the man tutoyered his wife, as he did his children, while she said vous to him.14 +++(5)+++ As possessions went, women were not important; and one finds many prayers in which chestnuts, turnips, and cattle are to be saved by God or the saints ahead of womenfolk.\* 

## Division of labor
True, the domestic economy of peasant households called for the services of both the sexes. The woman cooked and kept the house (badly, quite often), mended and patched the clothes as hastily as she could, and brought up the children. But she also spun yarn, and she cared for the cattle. 

"No woman, no cow, hence no milk, no cheese"; nor chicken or eggs and, given her spinning tasks, almost no linen. Inventories of bachelors and old widowers reflect the almost total absence of shirts and sheets. On the other hand, the man was irreplaceable, not only for the heavy work, but for his cash earning power; women were less easily hired and then at much lower rates.15 So, men and women complemented each other in a working partnership. 

## Male child preference
But they were not equals and, hence, seldom friends. The woman, reported a pastor from Ariège in 1861, was of course considered much less than a man. The birth of a male baby was greeted by gunshots and rejoicing. If a girl was born, "the father feels cruel disappointment.... He is almost humiliated." "Ce n'est qu'une créature," they said deprecatingly in Mayenne or Sarthe. Mothers rejoiced in boys for fear of their husband's anger at a girl. Too many daughters were "a calamity." This same attitude was noted in the Limousin and in many other places half a century later:16 


> One daughter, no daughter;  
Two daughters, enough daughters;  
Three daughters, too many daughters;  
Four daughters and the mother-  
Five devils against the father!+++(5)+++ 

[[173]]

Finistère as Olivier Perrin mentioned (but that was under the July Monarchy), in places where the old ways were preserved best, men wore no mourning when their wives died.\* 

The war of the sexes did not await the nineteenth-or the twentiethcentury, and the oppression of the weaker by the stronger is easy to understand: it is the contrary that would have been artificial. There were good reasons for wanting male offspring: greater strength, hence more employable and more use in the farm's work.+++(5)+++ And, of course, when a son married, the family's property was likely to be increased rather than drained off in dowries. Thus the popular proverb: "Marry your son when you will, your daughter when you can."+++(5)+++ 

Yet, despite the man's superior strength, one somehow suspects that things did not go one way only, that women did not content themselves with picking on other women. There are many Breton stories, for example, about Yann and Chann (John and Jane), the husband conspicuously stupid, forever bungling things, the wife the bright one in the family, forever outwitting him.+++(4)+++ But women's intelligence did not have a good press in the countryside. For that matter, intelligence in general was not popular, and of clever children one said that they would not live long.1 +++(4)+++

[[18]]

## Bullied husbands 
Bullied husbands certainly existed, but though village farces maintained alive the odious image of husband-beating wives, I have come across no actual case of such an incident. If women did their menfolk violence, it was more likely to have been by stealth, as in the case of one Marie-Anne Nicolas, fortytwo years old, who was sentenced to six months in jail by the district court of Châteaulin for having grabbed her husband by his verge while he was asleep, and thus dragged him around despite his screams, causing grave lesions in the urethral canal.19

## Household management
In certain instances where the men were ordinarily away, fishing or hired out for months on end, women in fact managed the household or its funds. But this does not appear to have contributed much to their emancipation, because the men seem to have kept tight hold on home affairs, as circumstances permitted, giving detailed instructions on how their wages should be and even on the sale of cattle.20 

## Female jobs
Real opportunity for women came with independent earnings in such jobs as domestic service or wet-nursing, though even then emancipation, once back on the home ground, must have been very relative. It also came with or just contemporary to education, despite a school program designed to reinforce women's traditional roles. 

\* Olivier Perrin and Alex Bouet, Breiz Izel, p. 279. The implicit lower value of the woman is suggested also in the disparate length of mourning in bourgeois circles: one year and six weeks for a widow, but only one year for a widower (Arnold Van Gennep, Manuel de folklore, 1.2: 805). Further, in many Ardèche villages a "more important" death knell was sounded for menlasting longer than the peal for a woman and rung on the bigger bells (Pierre Charrié, Folklore du Bas-Vivarais, p. 64).174 

THE WAY THINGS WERE 

There is no question that education was a progressive force, offering girls opportunities they had not had before, especially the possibility of escape and also of sharing the sort of knowledge that had invested men with ancient superiorities. But the school, as always, was consciously more conservative than subversive of traditional patterns, teaching girls not skills that would emancipate them (nobody wanted that), but skills that would make them better wives, mothers, housekeeperscleaner, more productive, able to sew, patch, mend, perhaps knit or embroider, cook a nourishing meal, and make a good moral home for present and future citizens. The different expectations of the sexes appear in schoolbooks, like this aside in a text for petites classes: 

> "If one leaves one's village, one's native city, to travel a little afar, as you will certainly do, at least you, little boys." 

"21 

## Subservience acceptance
Unfortunately, the old routines in domestic life, diet, and upbringing prevailed much longer than was hoped. Between 1914 and 1918 country women may well have gained a new sense of autonomy and confidence, thanks to the initiatives and the responsibilities that they were forced to take, the jobs that they learned to do, the family allowances that they had to spend. And yet as late as 1937 the director of agricultural services in Lot could answer the agricultural survey in terms that fit the previous century: "The woman maintains her traditions, and her domestic virtues manifest themselves as a condition of slavery freely accepted."22 

Life on the farm had to be slavery. The only change now was that it was "freely accepted" because there was more of a choice. The pressure of parental authority and the once inescapable socioeconomic necessity that left no alternatives, or only bad ones, had relaxed or vanished. Now a woman accepted her slavery by choice or by failure to attain emancipation. But emancipation was available and, equally important, women had become aware that it was available. 

## Plains preference
The dawning of such awareness had been gradual. Within certain limits, mountain girls had always sought the plain. Goats go up and girls go down, said the Pyrenean proverb.+++(5)+++ But to begin with, they sought the plain for much the same reason as their brothers did, because it held out the prospect of a less lean life, though with fewer chances of success than any male could expect.+++(4)+++ 

Girls went to fill the silk and textile mills of smaller industrial towns, walking ten miles or so from their village and living in miserable conditions in town through the week; others turned to part-time prostitution, especially in garrison towns; still others worked as seamstresses, milliners, nurses, and house servants. One and all for a long time worked to a single end: to gather a dowry, a dot.+++(4)+++ But school and print and growing opportunities in the last years of the nineteenth century made girls begin to have greater aspirations, and to feel that they now had a chance of realizing them. When girls got together, complained the village teacher of Clerjus in the Vosges in 1899, their talk was about how they loathed country life and farmwork, "their sole ideal" was "to marry a functionary, do nothing, and live in town." "Country girls await prince charming," agreed a country doctor in 1911, that is to say, a worker or artisan from town, better still a postman, a petty civil servant, or a noncommissioned officer.+++(5)+++ 


[[175]]

By now there were more such prince charmings; chance and choice were both greater. And we shall see that village womenfolk, working through swains or husbands, led and spurred the second wave of rural emigration to the towns.2 

## Business like family
Meanwhile, it is well not to overestimate the degree of progress. Men were for work. Women were for breeding, and to be used as beasts of burden. Children were meant to pull their own weight in the strained economy of poor, penny-pinching households. In households living on short rations, wives and children, sometimes husbands too, would steal their own family's grain or wine to sell in the market or to coquetiers passing through." Their feelings for each other must have been matter of fact at best, and hardly generous. I am inclined, perhaps unjustly, to see the emphasis that schoolbooks placed on filial affection as part of a campaign to teach the rural folk urban sentiments that they had had little time or chance to acquire, to inculcate notions that were strange to them by insisting that they were natural and right.+++(4)+++ 

There is no way of telling. Only the (perhaps misleading) evidence of bourgeois witnesses-doctors, landowners, and such-shocked by the fate of ailing peasants whisked into their graves because one must get back to work ("He is not good for anything anymore; he is costing us money; when will he be finished?");+++(4)+++ and of aged peasants resented for taking precious time as they went to their tardy rest: 

> "[The family members are] harsh on the dying as they are hard on themselves. [They] are not embarrassed to say in his hearing that he is dying and will kick the bucket anytime. His wife and his children mutter bitter words about wasted time. He is a burden and he feels it."25 +++(4)+++

A sick man or an ailing woman was bad enough. An oldster dragging out his or her life was worse, a creature, or a nothing, like a female child, with not even the promise of some productivity to come-except perhaps when dead, crevé.t 

The peasant, wrote a sympathetic witness in 1913, could not hide the relief he felt to see the end of those whom he called stragglers (trainiaux) or encumbrances (embeurgnas): "We inherit from the old man, but our old man is a sheer loss!" "Oh! it's nothing, it's an old man." 

"26 The old knew this, of course, and did their best to guard against being left at their children's dubious mercy.+++(4)+++ 

\* As evidence of how long it took for children to be granted any significant place in family or society, Pierre and M. C. Bourdieu cite the almost complete absence of pictures of children in peasant photograph albums and collections before 1939. By contrast, children have been a favorite. subject since the Second World War, featured in half the pictures taken after 1945. ("Le Paysan et la photographie," p. 165.) 

+ Under the Second Empire, a school inspector in Aube deplored the fact that the countryside knew "practically no filial love or respect for [old] age." Every day furnished "thousands of examples" of offspring who, having secured their fortune, wished only for their father's death (quoted in Pierre Zind, L'Enseignement religieux, p. 176). Attitudes to death were matter-offact, when they were not lighthearted. Raymond Doussinet quotes a flippant formula, "Better him than us: if you blow into his arse, you'll keep him from croaking"; and a children's song, "Pied bot! ma grand-mère é morte, / Et mon grand-père otout. / Jh' hérit'rons d'sa thiulotte / Et d'son jhupon de d'sous." (Le Paysan santongeais, pp. 190-91.) 

[[176]]

THE WAY THINGS WERE 

A host of proverbs warned, in almost identical terms, against the folly of divesting oneself of what one owns. "One should strip only to go to bed" (not even then, as we have seen!).+++(4)+++ "When father gives his son money, both laugh; when son gives father money, both cry." "A father can feed 12 children, yet 12 children won't feed their father."27 

It is not clear whether such constant reference to fathers reflects their symbolic supremacy over the consort as representative of both parents, their dominant role in the forging of proverbs, a deeper resentment between father and children, or the mother's more modest expectations. Old women, of course, could still render services where decrepit males could not.+++(4)+++ At any rate, there is ample evidence of indifference to surviving parents; of resentment rising to hatred and even leading at times to parricide; of old people shuffled about from one child to another, taken in à charge because they had to be housed, yet "worse off than in the alms house" because of the constant changes and because there was no one to take care of them2- awkward parasites on short rations and less space, cursed as useless mouths by grudging son and perhaps vengeful daughter-in-law who wished them dead and sometimes drove them to it, maltreated, abandoned to hunger and disease.\* 

So, it was need and greed that bound the family. First how to make ends meet, then how to achieve a degree of security by acquiring capital and bits of land. Children, their numbers, whether great or small, and their inheritance rights, were a crucial factor in that equation. 

## Birth control motivations
We hear a great deal about birth control, and certainly the 30 years before 1914 saw it spreading throughout the countryside. But for the poor and for those who clung to the old style of cultivation, children were still hands, hence wealth.+++(4)+++ The land-mincing machine, as Tocqueville called it—the equal division of inheritance between all offspring, established by the law of 1794-has been roundly blamed for inhibiting family size. But this applied only to property owners. It was not only the lack of skill or know-how that kept most peasants from contraceptive practices; it was the lack of need. The proof lies in the fact that in regions like the Moyenne Garonne, as Pierre Deffontaines has found, access to property in significant numbers coincided with a fall in birthrates (as well as with migration)—precisely when concern for the continuity of the family holding made family limitation relevant to need. Until this happened, Jules Renard's Philippe must have the last word: "I came into the world with my two arms", says Philippe. He marries and has four, and each child adds two more arms. "If no one in the family is crippled, it will never lack for arms and only risk having too many mouths."29 The question, it seems, is what counts more, the child as mouth or the child as hand. 

[[99]]

\* Balzac's Abbé Brossette notes: "The old people tremble to stay at home, for then they get no more food. Hence they go to the fields as long as their legs will carry them. If they lie down, they know very well that it is to die for lack of food" (Les Paysans, Paris, 1964 ed., p. 199). 

The Family 

[[177]]

For those who had little or no land to work or to leave behind them and whose chief commodity for sale was work, children represented additional earning power, hence were properly produced in droves. +++(4)+++

The size of the farms rented by tenants or sharecropped in the Lower Marche or the highlands of the Limousin was such, Alain Corbin tells us, that they required the labor of eight to twelve persons, possibly two or three households of people actually at work. There and in many other parts of France where the same situation existed, great importance was naturally attached to large families and to their need to stick together to survive.\* +++(4)+++

In a Limousin peasant poem, the titmouse criticizes the dove, because the dove is big, beautiful, and rich, yet produces only one or two offspring, whereas she herself, though small and weak, produces 15 or 16. "The head of family who works hard and who has many children," wrote Edouard Decoux-Lagoutte in 1888, "is almost sure in our countryside to acquire if not wealth at least honest comfort." 

And in 1894 Charles Dumont, walking through the Causses, amazed an innkeeper at Dargilau (Lozère) with tales of childless people. "How do they manage to earn any money then?" asked the host. Children, especially males of course, saved paying hired help; they were the richesse du laboureur, the farmer's wealth. So, in Corrèze at least, births continued as regularly as fecundity permitted. "How many great feasts a year?" asks a priest at catechism. "Four," answers a child. "Name them!" 

> "Well, they are the day of the vote, the day of Carnival, the day we stick the pig, and the day my mother delivers."30 

## Premarital pregnancy
Where numerous progeny were seen as a source of comfort, premarital pregnancy was no dishonor, but proof of future fruitfulness. The sharecroppers of Lauragais welcomed more boys, illegitimate or not: "In ten years we shall be rich!" And in the Loire lowlands, official disapproval was mild and tolerant: "The case is very frequent." Boys and girls often married before the infant's birth.+++(5)+++ In any case the girl was not dishonored: "The little accident proves she is not a mule [i.e., sterile], which is a serious blemish."+++(5)+++ 

Married or not, women who had babies could contribute to household income by wet-nursing when, as in the case of Nièvre, the city baby market was easily accessible. And at the very least, a wife's fertility ensured a family's hold on a dowry that might have been reclaimed if she died childless.31 Since sterility was always attributed to the woman, one need hardly wonder at the frenzied search for divine aid to conceive that fills the annals of popular superstitions. 



\* "Limousins migrants," pp. 352-53. According to Lucien Gachon, the Ambert region saw a rising use of birth control in 1880-1914, with the numbers of children falling in inverse proportion to the accumulation of wealth (see his paper in Jacques Fauvet and Henri Mendras, eds., Les Paysans, p. 397). It has been argued that a high-fertility strategy reflects a high child-mortality rate and will change as a fall in that rate makes the survival of an heir more likely. Certainly the rural France of the nineteenth century could show child-mortality rates comparable to those of the seventeenth century. But strategies differed according to regional and family labor needs, and this before any significant decline in the mortality rates.

THE WAY THINGS WERE 

As for contraception, a term I use not to indicate the use of any technical devices, but simply to describe the deliberate limitation of progeny, it is hard to trace the spread of the idea, let alone the practice, among the lower orders of society. But the evidence-or rather reference without much specific evidence-suggests that this development took place side by side with the greater propensity toward savings, greater geographical and professional mobility, the abandonment of religious practice, the generalization of military service and of the experience of city ways, and the example of the lower middle classes, for whom, in the late nineteenth century, the single child became the family ideal.3 

[[32]]

The demographic patterns of nineteenth-century France have been well studied by Etienne Van de Walle. Unfortunately, even his rich offerings leave a good deal obscure, notably, the differences in behavior between country and town, bourg and outlying areas. We can, of course, draw certain inferences from his work based on what we know about departments and their population; and when we do, we see that rural departments show a declining birthrate from the beginning of the century at least and perhaps before. Unhappily, we have no way of telling how the most rural districts performed in relation to the rest of their department, how isolation or poverty affected fertility. Nor, when we compare the rate at which births declined in departments that were obviously poorer, more isolated, more thoroughly rural, can we draw unequivocal conclusions. (See Maps 11-15, pp. 180-82.) 

It is clear enough that the birthrate declines, the proportion of people getting married rises, and the age of first marriage drops in direct relation to economic activity, prosperity, and easier communications. The Breton peninsula, the south-central departments around Lozère, the mountainous regions-Alps and Pyrenees-and the western interior south of the Manche all clung longer to high birthrates, high rates of celibacy, and a preference for late marriages. On the other hand (and here the trouble starts), the wealthier departments of Nord and Pas-de-Calais shared these tendencies, whereas much of Languedoc, though more backward, began to marry more and to procreate less at dates that match or better the evolution of wealthier, more modern regions. To take another example, in 1831 girls born in Haute-Vienne were getting married six years earlier on the average than those born in Ille-et-Vilaine (at 21.7 and 27.6 years, respectively). Sixty-five years later, the difference was still close to five years (22.3 and 27.5).33 Yet the Upper Limousin was poorer than Upper Brittany, and Rennes is a little closer to Paris than Limoges is. To note that the average age at first marriage was steadfastly and markedly higher in the west than in the Limousin does not make us any wiser, but does suggest the existence of regional orientations that outlasted changes in the economy or communications. 

Once again, generalizations can by definition only hope to be generally correct, and correlations between one trend or local feature and another can be pushed only so far and no farther. 

The Family 

[[179]]

Thus, in a seminal paper delivered in 1972, Van de Walle made the suggestion that the departments with the highest per-capita income from the land were also those where birthrates declined first. In support of this he noted that in 1836 the per-capita land taxes paid in Seine and Calvados (where birthrates declined before 1800) were 10 francs and 11.90 francs, respectively, and the door-and-window tax figures were 2.40 francs and 1.10 francs. Meanwhile, the inhabitants of Finistère (where the birthrate declined only after 1890) paid only 4 francs in land tax and 50 francs in door-and-window tax. And it is true that poverty and high birthrates do seem to go together, and that the departments in which birthrates declined late in the century were generally (though, we have seen, not always) the poorest. 

Yet an attempt to correlate economic conditions and birthrates during 1831-76 in those departments paying the lowest rates of door-and-window tax contributes little to our understanding. In Brittany, the western Pyrenees, and Lozère, low taxes (few windows) and high birthrates coincide. In more cases, though, we find a decline in birthrates with little or no improvement in housing; and some of these departments (Tarn-et-Garonne and Gers) had very low birthrates to begin with. 

So one could procreate like the bourgeoisie without even aspiring to live like them. And if fertility figures sometimes confirm what we know already--- drive yet another nail into the fortifications of enduring backwardness-they do not necessarily invalidate the impression that other areas, where the steady decline in fertility is supported by reliable statistics (Ariège, for instance), were perforce less backward. Discrepancies of this sort do nevertheless raise questions about the extent and meaning of what we generally describe as backwardness: the effective hold of isolation and poverty, which were always relative, and the way the peasants' indifference to the outside world actually worked, always highly selective, seldom ignoring what was perceived as being relevant to local need and possibility.\* It seems that men-and sometimes women, too, perhaps-however poor and isolated they may have been, were not beyond devising or adopting means of their own for manipulating life. There were, of course, well-established ways of limiting the population. Illegitimate children, like other socially marginal beings, had vastly higher death rates than children who were born in wedlock.

Van de Walle's suggestion in an earlier paper ("Demographic Transition in France?," Population Association of America, Cincinnati, 1967) that linguistic differences seem to have played a major part in delaying the spread of birth control speaks to this point. It is true that his maps show fertility tending on the whole to decline more slowly in areas where local languages survived longest. But if the persistence of local speech proved an obstacle to the diffusion of ideas that found a freer course elsewhere, it was because the cultural structure of the region was different. And the mentalities this culture forged lived on, even while slowly assimilating new attitudes. 

Interestingly enough, discrepancies in the two maps compared occur in the center and the south, as if there the impact of the national culture nibbling at local ways was harder to withstand. At the periphery, greater isolation (Lower Brittany) or contact with areas of similar culture across the borders (Basque and Catalan, Italian, Flemish, German) maintained what, from a French point of view, would look like cultural heterogeneity.

Rural communities, less emancipated than others from traditional controls and always anxious to identify their members socially, had a lower rate of illegitimacy than the cities. But still, an infant-mortality rate double the normal rate, which was high enough, must have taken care of a good proportion of those most likely to be a burden on the resources of the community.\* 


\*In Nord, in 1853, the infant-mortality rate in towns was 149 per 1,000 for legitimate children, 288 per 1,000 for illegitimate ones; in the countryside the rates were 139 per 1,000 for legitimate children and 324 per 1,000 for the illegitimate (A. Lesaëge, L'Homme, la vie et la mort dans le Nord au XIXe siècle, Lille, 1972, p. 99). Thus, the difference between the death

## Fertility control
Infanticide was a deliberate way of getting rid of unwanted children, legitimate as well as illegitimate. Indeed, the imperial prosecutor at Agen in 1863 referred to it as an aid to birth control or to redeeming failures in birth control, and noted that the number of married women killing unwanted children was increasing because so many wives were determined to limit the number of their offspring.35 +++(5)+++ But abandoning children was almost as effective, and more general. Malthus had pointed out that a government wishing to limit population had only to increase the number of homes for "lost" children; and foundlings (three or four a month in some small country towns) counted heavily in the statistics of infant mortality.36  +++(5)+++

[[37]]

Other additions to the statistics came from the spreading practice of putting babies out to nurse, a practice that took its victims not only among the infants entrusted to wet nurses, but among the children of the nurses as well.\* During the 1860's the mortality of infants given out to country nurses varied between one and two in three. But between 27 percent and 33 percent of the babies abandoned by mothers who went to the city to sell their milk-especially Paris-also died. Once a wet nurse had found a place, she sent her own baby back home with a professional baby driver, who through drunkenness, incompetence, or downright dishonesty could lose it, exchange it, or abandon it somewhere, to let it die of inanition.+++(5)+++ The child who escaped these hazards stood a good chance of dying on arrival as a result of the trip (in 1857 in one Nièvre commune alone eight infants died in the space of ten days because of this), or of succumbing to a higher rate of accidents and illness than that of its more fortunate fellows.38 Fortunate, however, is a relative term, for the natural children in such circumstances, since they were not the valuable properties that the boarding children were, took second place on a scale whose chief indicator was potential profits. As a grieving woman explained to the priest who sought to console her at an infant's burial: "Unfortunately, it's not 

rates of legitimate and illegitimate infants, a sufficiently impressive 93 percent at the urban level, soared to 133 percent in the country where unwed mothers and their offspring were more readily abandoned. True, illegitimacy seems to diminish in proportion to the agrarian character of communities (Placide Rambaud and Monique Vincienne, Les Transformations d'une société rurale, p. 66), but note that as late as 1950-51 the mortality rate among illegitimate children was still double the rate for others: 8.2 percent versus 4.3 percent. +++(5)+++ In the country, since no church bells were rung for the christening of bastards, they were sometimes known as sansonnets (H. Labourasse, Anciens us, p. 25). Yet in some villages fruit trees were planted at their birth, especially along roads, as for other children. +++(5)+++

\* Many of the wet-nursed babies were children of the affluent, but it is important to remember that numerous urban workers hired wet nurses too. Louis Borsendorff, the son of a workingclass couple, barely survived the ordeal. His mother returned to work the day after his birth, handing him over to a nurse from Arpajon; nine months later, when the woman brought him back, he was more dead than alive (De l'instruction du pauvre, p. 4). Borsendorff's mother had ten children; seven died before age seven, and an eighth died in an accident at twenty. That must have been fairly typical. "The Franco-Prussian War reduced infant mortality in France during the war from 33 percent to 17 percent because actual or feared disruption...caused bourgeois mothers to suckle their own children" (Sanford Kanter, "Defeat 1871," p. 57, citing the official report of a medical commission to the Minister of the Interior).184 

THE WAY THINGS WERE 

one of mine, but my petit Paris who brought me 20 francs a month, and so regularly paid! How am I going to replace him?"\* 

A less destructive means of population limitation and one employed for a long time was continence or, at least, celibacy. Even celibacy without continence was still reasonably effective, because it implied real efforts to prevent conception and because, when such efforts failed, the offspring was more likely to die, as we have seen. But celibacy as a major means of population control underwent a marked decline after the end of the eighteenth century and particularly (claims Paul Gemaehling) after 1861. At that date in only 21 French departments did the marriage rate among women fifteen to fortynine years of age exceed 600 per 1,000, and these were grouped in two blocs: the one around Paris, the other in the southwest, between Deux-Sèvres and Tarn-et-Garonne. On the other hand, in 24 departments-in the west, east, south, and center and in the Pyrenees-less than half the women in this age group were married. Gemaehling gives no comparable figures for bachelors in 1861, though his map of their incidence in 1931 suggests a correspondence. But we do know that in the Ancien Régime celibacy was widely practiced, and we occasionally hear of families in which one brother or more abstained from marriage, often to live with the married one, who carried on "the house."+++(5)+++ But marriage became increasingly more common, and with more marriages the birthrate fell. Between 1861 and 1931 the proportion of married women increased by 12 percent, their fecundity fell by 43 percent. The highest birthrates were in areas where the marriage rates were lowest: the more one married, the less one reproduced.39 In other words, where celibacy no longer held the line, some other method had to be used instead.t 

One fairly widespread method of family limitation was for a young man to marry an older woman and thus deliberately shorten the child-bearing period. +++(5)+++ At Chaponost (Rhône) during the first half of the nineteenth century 27 percent of brides were over thirty at their first marriage, a fact that led one scholar to comment on "the surprising choice so many well-off peasants make of an aged wife." Writing in 1883, Armand Desprès claimed that young men between twenty-five and thirty-five married widows and older women more 

\* C. Monot, De la mortalité, p. 85. A law of December 1874 for the protection of infants required all parishes to keep a register of infants placed out with a wet nurse or withdrawn from one. But an 1879 survey carried out by justices of the peace shows a general lack of compliance (Archives Départementales, Vosges 42 M 2). Laws proved more effective in their negative aspects. Article 55 of the Civil Code required that the infant's birth be verified by the local registrar within three days. In certain places this was taken to mean that the baby had to be carried several miles to the mairie regardless of the weather, a belief that did its part to raise the infant-mortality figures. 

Similarly, in Brittany the marriage rate had climbed between 1890 and the early 1920's, but the birthrate had fallen nearly 20 percent. The greatest decline had taken place in the most prolific department-Finistère. In 1929 the young women of Léon had made plain their determination "de ne plus faire comme leurs mères." (Gilbert Le Guen, "D'une révolution manquée," p. 491.) 

The Family 

[[185]]

often in France than in any other country. In country towns, he said, it was "common" for men in their early twenties to marry middle-aged widows. By his account, in Normandy and from Hérault to the Dauphiné some 10 percent of marriages were between people unable to have children.+++(5)+++ Desprès gives no references that would bear him out. But a 1969 study tells us that in 1890-92 in Côtes-du-Nord, where the women's marriage rate was 14 percent below the national average, more than 50 percent of the married women were twentyfive or over, whereas in France as a whole 61 percent were under twenty-five. Popular proverbs vaunting the virtues of older women and crying down the young also lend credence to this contention: "Better a ripe head than one that needs maturing." "It's in old pots that one makes the best soup." "Young woman and warm bread are a household's ruin." "Young woman, green wood, and new bread soon make a house for sale." So does the Breton saying that a girl is marriageable at thirty, a man at twenty. +++(5)+++ Paul Sébillot, who quoted this saying in the 1880's, added that young men often married girls 15 years older because this meant less chance of having many children, and claimed that the wife was several years older than the husband in at least one-third of Breton marriages.\*0  +++(5)+++

In the end, though, positive action, if one may use the term, had to take precedence over the negatives. As early as 1791 a priest in faraway Dordogne was reporting that both peasants and upper classes limited their offspring, whether by poverty or by will. While bestiality was "almost extinct," he added, and sodomy more rare than it used to be, masturbation and deliberate chastity were current and so, one supposes, was what the church manuals described as onanism-coitus interruptus.\*1  +++(5)+++

Lacking other evidence of a privileged nature, we are left to draw what inferences we can from incidental data. In 1866 the Agricultural Survey found scarcely a four-child family left in Haute-Garonne; even families with three children were considered large. In 1869 Théron de Montaugé felt that "voluntary continence" was the poor man's only way of improving his position. Statistics, says André Armengaud, show this trend toward smaller families after 1870. In 1875 a chronicler of Blagnac (Haute-Garonne) found the peasants there lamenting any pregnancy beyond the first child and apparently trying to terminate such "accidents" by all and every means. As the local mayor put it, when one has had one child one should thereafter leave one's tools in the toolshed ("il faut déposer les outils au galetas").\* +++(5)+++ It would not be long before medical men related continence and coitus interruptus to the marked growth in nervous and mental troubles. As birthrates went down, the rate of mental disturbances went up. 43 

It is hard to tell, though, whether in the end such practices frayed nerves worse than unwanted children did. A Vendean song certainly suggests that too many children were more of a desolation than continence:44

## Extended family gone
Rural teachers throughout the 1880'S and 1890's constantly inveighed against the selfishness of those who refused to breed for France and deplored the shrinking size of families, the lower rate of births, the insistence on a single heir.+++(4)+++ They also noted a related phenomenon, namely that in a dwindling population, the number of households had increased.+++(4)+++ In Domptail (V osges ), lying in the rich plain between Meurthe and Moselle, the population had fallen from 1,056 in the year 1865 to 849 in 1880, but the number of family households had risen from 315 to 325. The extended family was dying. In Puy-de-Dome, too, at Y ran de and at Buron, in the Limagne, the average household by 1899 consisted of father, mother, and two children. If any grandparents survived, reported a schoolteacher, they usually lived apart, "in the old house."45 The peasants were discovering will and choice. In 191 I Emmanuel Labat described how they had learned birth control from the bourgeoisie and were now limiting their families to save money and avoid dividing property. And as he also noted, more and more were passing from sharecropping to owning their own land. This meant harder work, to pay for land or get more of it, and all the harder for having to get by without the hands that the more numerous family furnished. But mentality was changing once again: people sought less to rise in the world than to enjoy themselves. Now, said Labat, men and women sought "to live their life for their own sake," to enjoy what resources and what time they could, to expend less effort and take less risk.46 The peasant's workload was beginning to be eased as manufactured goods, chemicals, and modern tools became available; and where once there had hardly been any thought of relief or alternatives, other options now suggested themselves. As peasants began to understand and avail themselves of the opportunities for an easier life, recreation, or even escape, ad hoc moralists stepped forward to deplore what they felt showed a weakening of character or will. In fact, the changing ways of the countryside merely showed a greater possibility of choice and a growing will, when this was possible, to choose.·

\* Thus the traditional distribution of weddings throughout the year had been affected by oldestablished taboos and necessities, and reflected the agricultural and religious calendars that made marriage extremely rare during harvest time, Advent, and Lent. By the 1890's the compensating peaks of marriages in January-February and October had been much reduced. Thereafter, at least in the Rhône countryside, Gilbert Garrier tells us, more young couples married when they pleased; and, he adds, bred when they pleased (Paysans du Beaujolais, 1: 472-73).

The Family 

[[187]]

And one of the things inevitably affected was the traditional pattern of the family. 

## Exagamy shift
Exogamy increased, though at a painfully slow rate. At Albiez in Maurienne the rate of increase in exogamous unions through the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, when approximately 84 marriages in every 100 were made at home, was almost imperceptible. From 16.1 percent in the eighteenth century, the figure climbed to only 16.8 percent in the nineteenth century, and was still only 2I.1 percent in the first half of the twentieth century. But over the same 250-year period the proportion of spouses in such unions who came from places outside the canton changed significantly, rising from 6.7 percent in the eighteenth century and 9.9 percent in the nineteenth century to 35.8 percent by the mid-twentieth century. Meanwhile, in the less isolated community of Vraiville (Eure) the number of marriages that seem to have been concluded outside the village group more than doubled in the second half of the nineteenth century.47 

## Solidarity loss
Family solidarity, scarcely founded on affection, or on equality, was fostered by necessity, labor, coexistence in a self-sufficient economy, and isolation from society. +++(5)+++ The farm, the croft, the holding made their occupiers bond-slaves of the past, and of subsistence. In such circumstances, the home became the focus of all the family's tensions, but of tensions largely repressed. 



\* In Languedoc, too, at the turn of the century, marriage contracts were often dispensed with. And according to Robert Jalby, those entering into them did so less to secure the bride's dowry against her new family than to ensure the future security of the young household (Folklore du Languedoc, p. 83). 

[[188]]

THE WAY THINGS WERE 

Cohesion lasted as long as questions remained unasked and alternatives unperceived, hence more apparent to outside observers than real to those concerned. The strains of life expressed themselves in boredom and in aggressiveness, both accepted as inevitable.+++(4)+++ But the conflicts between the desires of the individual and the demands of the group that undermined the family's concord were offset by an interdependence that made it stand as a unit against all others, preserved its balance, and permitted it to survive. Only new possibilities, new means, radically new conditions, could upset this secular order and bring freedom from the subjection to tradition, to nature, to the needs of common labor, the lack of money, and the paucity of choice. These new conditions appeared only in the late nineteenth century. 

Gradually, the family could be seen to have lost its protective role-—in matters of public security, in health, in clothing, education, and social training. Its educational functions were preempted by the schools. Medical care, remedies, and cures, all once locally provided or homemade like clothing, came ever more from the outside. Above all, means of escaping the clan's constricting grip became more numerous, to the point where it took only a little initiative to get away from home-and, having done so, to survive. 

As soon as opportunity and mobility beckoned, the old authorities began to disintegrate. The Second Empire echoed with complaints, not only that peasants no longer showed the proper obedience and deference to their betters, but that children likewise had ceased to give their parents their due. However exaggerated such reports, they are evidence of a novelty of historical proportions: the yoke of necessity was just beginning to break down, and parents and employers felt this keenly. The shrill complaints about the waning of parental authority were sometimes accompanied by explanations: sharecroppers' children, said an agronomic review, left their parents "as soon as they could" to better themselves.+++(4)+++ "Their old respect for paternal authority"—which no doubt bent itself to make them stay at home-had fallen victim to their desire to earn their way to independence. But the desire would not have existed without the opportunity that suggested it! 

[[49]]

"Children no longer respect their parents, peasants no longer respect their word," lamented Labat.50 The cause in both instances was the same: alternatives, mobility, choice, the possibility of getting away. One had supported ailing elders because they symbolized continuity. When the belief in continuity began to fade, one was reduced to acting out of duty or affection, or even more unlikely, out of pure humanity. It is surely more than simple coincidence that at this very moment paternal authority was simultaneously sapped by a number of legislative measures that trespassed on what had once been considered the father's natural domain: protecting working children, requiring them to attend school, in one way or another ignoring the will or interest of the paterfamilias.+++(4)+++ In 1889 a law defined the conditions under which unworthy fathers could be stripped of their paternal rights. 

The Family 

[[189]]

Other measures regulated or prohibited child labor (1874, 1892), punished parents who ill-treated their children (1898), introduced the possibility of judicial administration of a child's property (1910), limited the father's right of consent to his children's marriages (1896 and after), and protected illegitimate children (1896 and after). Above all, the schools provided a potent source of rival authority and values, as close to home as you could possibly get.+++(4)+++ And in those parts of France where, as in Brittany, a determined drive against local speech separated the French-speaking young from their Breton-speaking elders, the local tradition was left to seep away, and the young came to despise their elders as ignorant, when all they ignored was French.+++(4)+++ No wonder that the crisis of authority became an important subject of public debate, to the point where in 1914 the Catholic Semaines Sociales, so representative of bien-pensant opinion, selected it as the topic of their annual meeting.51 

Naturally, trends growing out of socioeconomic changes would be hastened by these outside influences. Family dissensions became more apparent, and possibly more divisive. The young were readier to question, dissent, rebel, or even adopt different political positions from those of the family or the clan. One result of this, widely noted, was fewer family reunions: "Chacun chez soi, chacun pour soi," wrote a teacher of Mogeville (Meuse) in 1889.+++(4)+++ 

The young, especially young couples smarting under the subjection, restrictions, and frictions of large households where their elders dominated and sometimes bullied them, seized the first opportunity to gain some degree of independence. In the 1880's sons began to expect and to demand wages, and wages similar to those paid a hired hand. In the Limousin marriage under joint property rules triumphed over the older régime dotal. Fewer young couples continued to live with the parents, a condition that marriage contracts had sometimes specified. Fewer unmarried sons and daughters remained at home.52 

In Lauragais and the Montagne Noire, a good observer connected this development with the schools. Once young people knew how to count, said Pariset, they claimed their share of family holdings and, if the claim was rejected, they left. In Tarn-et-Garonne, driven by the "spirit of independence and insubordination,” children escaped from the family as soon as they were old enough to hire themselves out, "leaving their parents in a difficult position to work their farm." This chiefly after 1900, when the fall-off in the rural population offered opportunities for such employment.53 

In the center of France, where large families were needed to work relatively large holdings, isolation had long helped preserve family communities in which several couples lived and worked as one production unit. These closed or semi-closed domestic economies, based on strong family bonds, managed to hold out for a long time, but by 1897 we hear that even there "the father lacks authority to retain his children." Especially in Creuse, where the possibilities of emigration were well known, the young now went out at sixteen or seventeen to make their own way.

THE WAY THINGS WERE 

Those who did not go to town in search of higher wages or simply of adventure hired themselves out as farmhands to earn cash. The "family republics" of Auvergne, some of them said to go back as far as the eighth century, slowly disintegrated. The last, near Thiers, was broken up in 1925.\*\* +++(4)+++

References now begin to appear to the influence of the young over the old, and to the old following the lead of the young. In the 1830's simply abandoning the belt for suspenders seems to have been taken as the most audacious act of independence and innovation on a young peasant's part.55 By 1889 at Broye a man's wife no longer called him "our master," his children no longer addressed him in the third person.\* In Allier, remarked a local scholar in 1911, the father's supremacy, which was the rule 20 years before, was now the exception. Children no longer accepted subordination, especially when they returned from military service, and absolutely insisted on equal rights. About the same time Labat referred to "the precocious, intense, rather ferocious individualism of the young. 

"56 One wonders whether this did not play some part in the trend to smaller families. The poor had lagged behind in limiting families, partly because they had no property and hence no worries about dividing it among too many heirs, but above all because (as we have seen) children meant income. In the Vendée bocage, as in many other places, children could be expected to begin work at ten years old or so, and to remit all their earnings to their father. “The poor peasant has every interest in having a big family. But if the offspring could be expected to bolt rather than contribute to the family budget, what interest would the poor peasant have in bringing up a large brood? What, for that matter, was the interest of family continuity in the long run?

The new developments created a paradoxical situation. The combined trends toward small landownership and birth control changed the look of the rural population, making for the predominance of older people who owned house, land, and money, and were used to giving orders to their children, who were fewer than they had been, economically dependent, and as far as possible, indoctrinated to honor and obey the old.58 The heads of households also now tended to live longer, and the gradual aging of this group (as well as its limited means) made for economic backwardness and reluctance to modernize. This in turn encouraged the departure of the most enterprising among the young, impatient for responsibility or independence-an emigration related not to technological improvements on the land but, on the contrary, to the resistance to such improvements by the masters of the land and to the obstacle their presence presented to vertical mobility. 

\* Charles Perron, Broye-les-Pesmes. In Languedoc, too, a turn-of-the-century observer noted that a young bride no longer entered the household as a stranger and "almost a servant." Now the young husband appeared to prefer his bride to his parents. Nor was the husband any longer the uncontested head of the family: wives and husbands were beginning to share authority and even, horribile dictu, "the influence of the wife is dominant." (Quoted in Jalby, Folklore, p. 81.) 

The Family 

[[191]]

So on the one hand the entrenchment of the old drove off the young. On the other hand, the same situation (of course, in its wider context) also permitted the emancipation of the young whether they stayed or left. The shrunken population and the shortage of young hands were crucial to the higher wages and job opportunities that allowed, indeed suggested, escape from what may in some ways have been a worsening situation. 

All these trends reinforced each other. Continuity had been a factor of survival, hence a reinforcement of the family. In times when other social structures were weak the family mattered more, and its authority was more easily preserved or enforced. Furthermore, the more difficult the land and the less advanced the methods of cultivation, the more important it was that it should be cleared and worked with continuity. Raising the question of continuity anew at each generation could seriously threaten the family enterprise and, ultimately, the society in which it operated. The Napoleonic Code, reflecting abstract urban ideas and interests, showed a readiness to dispense with needs such as these, or to ignore them, in a manner quite alien to realities in much of the countryside. The Code was therefore ignored for a while in certain places, and ways were found to adjust its notions to local needs. On the other hand, when conditions of work and life had changed enough, the mincing machine of the Napoleonic Code became less dangerous, and in some ways convenient. Continuity now counted less and mobility counted more. A mechanism to make changes seemed much more suitable now that change had become a part of life. And the less continuity men now perceived around them, the less value they put on continuity. 

If fewer grandparents or older relations lived in now-smaller households, this meant that fewer children would be brought up under their influence, hence that they would be more open to emancipation and freer to adapt to the culture of the schools. If endogamy crumbled, however slowly, this meant that the environment of home and neighborhood was more varied and less constrictive in the cultural suggestions that it made. Children, Ferdinand de Saussure once said, are the freer compared with preceding generations "to the extent that norms are less precisely established and unity less total in the communities where they learn to speak.' 59 The turn of the century was, par excellence, a time when the status of local speech had become uncertain, and this development would be intensified with exogamous marriages that brought people of different speech, ways, and values under one roof, and that left the child freer to choose from the very first. 

Societies that had been stable and homogeneous for centuries were coming under several stresses at once. In stable societies, changes--and there is never a time when changes do not take place-affect only details, not the general structure. But the late-nineteenth-century rural society of France was no longer stable; and it was gradually becoming less homogeneous. Every blow against the details of its organization placed its total system more and more at the mercy of modernity.
