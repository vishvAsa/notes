Ring out the old, ring in the new, Ring happy bells, across the snow!

Ring out the false, ring in the true.

"And your hair has become very white; 

And yet you incessantly stand on your head- Do you think, at your age, it is right?"

"CONTINUITY HAS broken down," wrote Jules Méline about the changing world around him. "No longer an evolution, it is a true revolution that is taking place and that pursues its way." Looking back at those years, the folklorist André Varagnac claimed that France in the last quarter of the nineteenth century underwent a veritable crise de civilisation.1 Traditional attitudes and traditional practices crumbled, but they had done so before. What mattered after 1880 was that they were not replaced by new ones spun out of the experience of local community. The decay and abandonment of words, ceremonies, and patterns of behavior were scarcely new. What was new and startling, said Varagnac, was the absence of homemade replacements: the death of tradition itself. 

Varagnac was right. Some French peasants even today sow at the new moon and 

prune trees at the waning moon; but a general statement need be right only in a general way. The end of the century saw the wholesale destruction of traditional ways. It is no coincidence, surely, that this period saw a great spurt of interest in folklore studies. Serious folklore research began only in 1870, and one of France's great folklorists, Paul Delarue, has called 1879-1914 its golden age. Most of the great journals devoted to such research were founded in that period: the Revue celtique and the Revue des langues romanes in 1870, Romania in 1872, Mélusine in 1877. Others of importance lived only within its span: La Tradition (1887-1907), the Revue du traditionnisme français et étranger (1898-1914), and Paul Sébillot's Revue des tradi tions populaires (1888-1919), which lived and died with him. 

The 1880's also saw the founding of the special folklore collections that in due course led to the Musée d'Ethnographie and the Musée des Arts et Traditions Populaires.2 The research carried out by Sébillot revealed the possibilities of a whole new field. In 1895 the Society for National Ethnography and Popular Arts began to study not just the literary folklore that had been

the sole interest of the romantics, but popular art, objects and techniques as well. Peasants were studied as a vanishing breed; their culture was dissected and their sentimental value grew. From George Sand to Maurice Barrès, writers took up the noble peasant as an earlier century had taken up the noble savage. Sets of picture postcards featured scenes that had scarcely been worth notice shortly before: thatched cottages, farmers pitching, hay, harvest feasts, peasants in regional costumes.

But for all who rued the loss of olden ways and sought to record and preserve their memory, many others rejoiced at their passing and did all they could to speed it. Speaking at Cahors in 1894, Senator Jean Macé, moving spirit of the prestigious Ligue de l'Enseignement, expressed the prevailing view with vigor: "Let every dying day carry away with it the remains, the debris, of the dead beliefs." And every day did; certainly every year. No longer did the sower beginning on his field first throw a handful of seed in the air, "Voilà pour Le Bon Dieu," another into the hedge, “Voilà pour les rats, rates, et ravons," and only then one on the ground, "Voici pour moi!" No longer at Pierrecourt and at Blangy-sur-Bresle, between Dieppe and Abbeville, did the man whose grapes ripened first give a bunch to the church to be placed in the Virgin's hand; nor did this custom survive for the first bunch of hemp and flax in the countryside around Quiberon. The proximate causes were different-Phylloxera at Pierrecourt, political conflict at Quiberon--but the underlying causes were the same. The customs had outlived their time. At Audierne, in Brittany, where certain brutal but colorful initiation ceremonies for cabin boys were abandoned at the turn of the century, “a wave of strangers and tourists" was blamed, but the same sentence conceded that the locality had "lost its former cohesion."5 

In Loire a whole host of courting and marriage customs died out. Courting in the fields (bergerer, or aller à la bergère) ceased as fewer and fewer girls went out to tend sheep or cattle, and especially when fields began to be enclosed. The ritual of hiding the bride-to-be, to be searched out by the groom and his friends, abducted, and forced prettily off to church, was abandoned at Noailly when a girl stifled to death in a cupboard in 1885; but the custom had long since ended at Saint-Germain-l'Espinasse, a larger and less isolated village nearby, where it seems to have been dropped as early as 1870. Exactly the same was true of pétarades (the firing off of guns); they were discontinued at Saint- Germain weddings in 1870, but lasted another 15 years at Noailly. In both Noailly and Saint-Germain a simpler, less socially objectionable wedding custom lasted longer: the bride was presented with a broom, a distaff, or some seed to sow as a reminder of her duty to work. This practice survived into the early twentieth century, when brides began to find it debasing. In Beauce, where brides were presented with a distaff right in church, a southern girl who married into a family of Auneau (Eure-et-Loir) in 1896 was the first to refuse to accept it. Some fairly crude customs lasted surprisingly long-in-

stances of couvade, for example, in which fathers take to their beds on the morrow of childbirth, being reported in Morvan as late as 1905-but they were increasingly seen as grotesque."

Changing crops, tools, and conditions also affected customs. Veillées, as we know, died out in part because people could afford to light and heat their own homes. Cash and machines put an end to customary payments in kind-like the eleventh bale of every harvest worker. After about 1900 we hear that employers actually preferred to pay to have work done. In Alsace, Aube, and other parts of France, where a newly married couple had been yoked to a plow in a ritual of fertility and of labor, the custom disappeared as new-style, heavier plows were introduced. In Mâconnais, where before the Phylloxera every possible bit of land had been planted to grapes, dead leaves and heather were gathered by groups of peasants in the winter to be used for stable litter and bedding; this custom, la feuillée, was given up at the turn of the century as more balanced farming and better transportation made more suitable materials available. Patent medicines and chemists' wares replaced traditional herbs and remedies. Old people in Vaucluse told Laurence Wylie in 1957 that they had known the old remedies but now "when we are ill we go to the doctor."9 

As flax and hemp ceased to be cultivated on any scale, the songs connected with them ceased to be sung, and other worksongs followed them into oblivion. The singing, drinking, and dancing that had accompanied the threshing of grain survived the advent of mechanical threshing machines (manèges) turned by oxen or horses (around the 1880's in Upper Brittany), but died out when power-driven threshing machines (batteries à la mécanique) spread in the late 1890's.10 Harvest feasts, once universal, disappeared. "When everything was done, it was a relief and people celebrated. Today it is all done fast and with less fatigue." Hence no more feasts accompanying the return of the last loaded cart, no more rejoicings around the last sheaf of wheat, no celebratory bouquet presented to the farmer's wife, no more pare-scéye, parsoie, gerbaude, raboule.11 

The skills involved with such practices were lost with them: how to tie a wheatsheaf, how to plait the straw dolls that were presented to the farmwife or the straw torches used in some ceremonies ("plaiting them was a whole art, neither too pliant nor too tight"), how to build in drystone or adobe, how to thatch a roof. Men had learned immemorial, customary, repetitive gestures: digging, sowing, cutting with sickle or scythe, sharpening, carrying, stacking, threshing, work as instinctive and skilled in its way as the artisans' tours de main. They had to learn new gestures appropriate to new ways and new instruments, and to unlearn old ones now deemed uncouth, like spitting and chewing tobacco. 

New gestures, new conventions, took their place: riding a bicycle, rolling cigarettes, winding a watch or consulting it. Dressing and undressing with474

any frequency are very recent habits.12 Looking into a mirror is another one. So is washing, especially washing one's hair. The art of skiing was learned by mountain folk in the 1890's and early 1900's. In 1899 an officer of the alpine corps presented the priest of Val d'Isère with a pair of skis. Soon the people of the surrounding hamlets learned to make their own in local wood: larch, birch, ash. By 1913 every family attending Sunday mass had a particular part of the church wall where it stacked its skis.13 

Practices changed, traditions changed with them. National ceremonies appeared whose recurrence made them traditional. Some, like the Emperor's feast, did not have time to become established; others, like the Fourteenth of July, are vigorous still. Within less than a century after 1870 all civic ceremonies in France had a national, not a local, character. At a more private level, festive practices evolved in the same way; white dresses at marriage, gifts at Easter time, Christmas trees, became very quickly immemorial ways, though dating in most places less than a century back. The "traditions" of the twentieth century are newer than most people think. 

[[14]]

The best-known instance of the birth of a new tradition is found in conscription ceremonies. Beginning probably with the draft lotteries for militia service in the eighteenth century, conscription grew in importance during the revolutionary and imperial wars and settled into custom along with longterm service during the nineteenth century. The term conscript was used from infancy to indicate men born in the same year, hence bound together in a special fellowship ("He is my conscript" was equivalent to but stronger than the bourgeoisie's "We went to school together"). Ceremonies developed, first, as we have seen, efforts to secure "good numbers" by divination, talismans, and village sorcery; then processions, parades, and battles against gangs from other villages.15 When the draft lottery ended, the ceremonies went on. Conscripts continued to make their rounds for gifts and toasts, continued to hold their dances and their banquets. Their parades now took them to the medical examination at the induction center or to the railway station. Induction became less of a burden, a "good number" less of a blessing, but the rites of conscription were well established. Indeed, instead of dying with universal military service, they put out new shoots: they incorporated conscrites, girlfriends of the same age group. 

"In the past, military service lasted so long that no one thought of marriage," remarked a Loire villager toward the end of the century. "Now the conscripts go to see their conscrites." In the old days, explained another, "the day of the draft lottery, the conscripts chose a tavern and made good cheer with their fathers, the mayor, and the rural constable. No one paid attention to conscrites. Since 1893, they've been inviting their conscrites to dances." In the old days conscripts presented brioches to municipal councilmen (Cherrier, 1880), or to the priest or the mayor (Ambierle, Saint-Haon); by 1895, 1897, 1898, depending on the locality, they were presenting their brioches to their

conscrites. It took a few years for people's minds to change or for ideas to travel; but a shorter period of military service, by allowing young men to make marriage plans, made the new custom seem more natural than the old. A changed attitude to symbols led to still other changes. Traditionally conscripts' last days of freedom included a visit to the town brothel. They arrived there as a group, with the village flag in the van, and no one saw any harm. in a ceremony appropriate to induction into the ranks of adult men. In 1891, however, the conscripts of Bray-sur-Seine were stopped at the brothel door by the village constable, who threatened to confiscate the flag rather than allow it to be carried into such a place. The constable won the ensuing argument. Despite the conscripts' strong resentment at having, as it were, to strike their colors, the flag and its bearer had to wait outside." National symbolism by now was stronger 

than any 

other. 

Should the persistence of conscription ceremonies, and especially the invention of conscrites, lead us to qualify Varagnac's assertion that traditions were dying? Scarcely, for these ceremonies dated back no further than the early part of the century, and had been perpetuated largely as convenient occasions for conviviality. Their persistence should remind us, rather, that rites are functional. They serve particular interests. When such interests disappear or fade, or when men see a better way of serving them, the rites may persist as long as they are no bother-especially if they provide some fun. But they are no longer taken seriously as ritual, and thus give way easily before even modest opposition or disappear forever when a crisis leads to their seemingly temporary suspension. 

Leaving personal experience aside, the role of wars in dealing the coup de grâce to lingering customs is quite remarkable. Contemporary observers noted this development without comment or simply attributed it directly to the catastrophe. But war was less a cause of change than a precipitant of changes already under way.18 Edgar Morin makes precisely this point when he writes that in the parish of Plodémet "the war of 1914 accelerated and amplified most of the processes set off in 1880-1900." Like the Great Revolution in peasant parlance, the Great War became a symbolic dividing line between what once was and what is, so that informants in a survey used terms like jadis and avant la guerre interchangeably. Yet wars are not watersheds for customs, but difficult times in which people are forced to focus on essential matters and come to see things differently. Many festive customs were necessarily suspended by the Great War. In the countryside, mourning was almost as universal as hardship: two years for parents, one for siblings. There were few pigs to slaughter, no festive family meals, no public festivities. And after the war there was the great influenza epidemic. By 1919 the old customs were no longer part of people's lives. Some were restored to their prewar prominence, but many were quietly forgotten.19

CHANGE AND ASSIMILATION 

Even the war of 1870-71, we have already seen, made significant inroads into the old way of life. Campaigns were relatively short by twentieth-century standards, and casualties much lighter, but an important area of the northcast-from Belfort to the Doubs and the Jura, and west from Haute-Saône to Aube and all parts north of the Ardennes-remained under German occupation until at least the end of 1872 and in some cases until August 1873. This scarcely made for a festive mood. At any rate, many folklorists see here the "1789 of our popular traditions," and there is some evidence to bear them out.20 In the wine country of Marne the fête du cochelet, in which the grapepickers brought the last bunch of grapes to the vineyard owner, ended with the war. At Delle, near Belfort, Midsummer fires did not survive three years of German occupation.21 In Orne, occupied till the spring of 1871, certain villages never resumed their traditional bonfires. At Saint-Germain-l'Espinasse (Loire), as we have seen, some of the more boisterous marriage customs were given up in 1870. Along the Oise valley, in Aisne, hemp and flax production fell disastrously under the occupation and never recovered; neither did the festive activities connected with it, which died out in 1890. We have heard how the Prussian war brought an end to an ancient fertility rite at Le Mesnil, in Marne. Most of these instances occurred where the war made its impact felt; in any case they are not particularly numerous. The war of 1914-18 was different. As Father Garneret described it for Franche-Comté, it was "the bloody break that struck our villages such a blow: 20 dead for 300 inhabitants and all the customs shattered."22 

Precisely those isolated regions where customs had resisted longest bear out Garneret's words. In Vivarais the Great War was "a true break in the warp of history." In Loire a long list of customs ended with 1914: charivaris in a number of places, veillées, the fir trees that were raised to flank the threshold of the newly married. Even dowries allegedly lost some of their importance. In Aveyron after 1918 only children lit "small" Midsummer fires; the same or none at all in Gard, Périgord, Sarladais, Diois, Quercy, and, rather expectably, Argonne. In Aisne and the Pas-de-Calais harvest customs ended with the war; more surprisingly, the same thing happened in Puy-de-Dôme. In Marne many practices lapsed: feux de brandons, the November hiring of servants for the year (louée de Saint-Martin), various marketing and dietary customs, many Midsummer fires. But much the same practices lapsed in the Puy area and in Bourbonnais. The bands of harvesters were now in uniform. The seasonal hirings-out were suspended, and with them the festivities, the songs, the dances. In Forez there were no able-bodied men to carry the saints' statues in processions; they were never carried again. The disguises worn at Mardi Gras disappeared. The custom of ringing the bells all through Allhallows Eve was abandoned.23 

The map of extinct fires runs from the Ardennes to the Landes and Cantal. Carnival died where it had survived in Forez, Auvergne, the Limousin. Old

rites like the election of an Abbot of Youth or a King of Clerks, which had lingered in Provence, disappeared. So did the chambrettes, bled of their membership. We need not continue. The quake was terrifying, and the old onehorse shay collapsed in all its parts. "Now fêtes are finished," declared the people of Lantenne, "we shall see no more fêtes." They would. Fêtes were in fact held again there after some years, but they were different-they were all for fun.24 The ritual had been dying and now it was gone. 

For national integration, the war was an immense step forward. Destructive to lingering anachronisms, it at the same time hastened the advent of all the transmutations we have seen taking shape. Ways of speaking, eating, and thinking, which had been changing rapidly in any event, were thrown into a blender and made to change faster still. Time had something to do with this: the effects would have been more superficial if the war had been as short as the war of 1870-71. The refugees from German-invaded regions, parked in villages inland, began by living apart but ultimately were obliged by circumstances to interact with the villagers. Language difficulties alone must have been severe. A northern miner, in his recent memoirs, tells how he had to "relearn French" when he was sent for a lung operation to an Aveyron clinic where no one could understand the chtimi he spoke.25 Evacuees of urban or industrial background were particularly alien, but even farming families were foreigners outside their pays. Still, farmers were shorthanded; the displaced were in need of means and services; the war went on and on. Whatever people felt about each other, cultural integration forged ahead. 

All this was even truer of the soldiers. The hazards of war carried them all over a country they had recently learned about from books, forced them to "relearn French" in order to communicate with comrades and civilians, opened a door on unknown worlds, milieus, ways of life. Along with the hard life of the front there was an unfamiliar abundance; wine, coffee, and meat at every meal taught the survivors habits they would not easily unlearn. "Il est resté un pauvre homme," wrote Michel Augé-Laribé about the average peasant, until the 1914 war "lui a fait voir du pays. "26 Basic economic conditions kept him in their grip even when the war was over, and only another war really put paid to stubborn survivals.\* But the French peasant was never 

Some students place the watershed between old and new attitudes in 1939-42. Gustave Thibon so dates the transition in Vivarais, as Placide Rambaud does for Maurienne (see Thibon, "Un Exemple d'émiettement humain," pp. 50-51; and Rambaud, Economie et sociologie de la montagne, p. 172). Arnold Van Gennep makes a similar remark (Manuel de Folklore, 1.4: 1579). Much of this turned on the serious food shortages of 1940-45, which put an end, among other things, to long and gargantuan marriage feasts. In Mâconnais, Emile Violet tells us, the public marriage dance disappeared in 1939. The village community that mandated that all celebrations be open to every member had disintegrated earlier, when "the rich" no longer conformed to its customs. But such failures to conform had been punished by charivaris. The war excused the inexcusable. (Les Veillées en commun, p. 2.)

again the "pauvre homme" that he had been before. For him, as Joseph Pasquet has said of Morvan, today began in 1914.27 

Many grieved over the death of yesterday, but few who grieved were peasants. Thatched cottages and log cabins are picturesque from the outside; living in them is another matter. Old folk in the Breton commune investigated by Morin had no fond remembrance of the old days. For them as for the Republican reformers of the Third Republic, the past was a time of misery and barbarism, the present a time of unexampled comfort and security, of machines and schooling and services, of all the wonders that are translated as civilization. Morin quotes a seventy-year-old man: "A hundred years ago, this place, ah, yes, it was really wild, full of savages. People were not civilized. They fought and a lot were thieves. People tried to sleep with their neighbors' wives. We weren't educated people, we didn't know how to read, we didn't know how to write, there was no school. Now we are civilized; people know at least how to read and write, all of them. Before there was misery; now we are well off." Roger Thabault says much the same thing about the people of Mazières in 1914: "All, even the poorest, had a lively sense........ of immense material progress. They had an equally lively sense of great social progress, of limitless evolution toward more liberty and more equality, thanks to the vote. 1928 

This helps explain the extraordinary difference between the intellectual despair and decadence of the fin-de-siècle elite and the optimism, hope, and sense of progress so evident among the masses. To be sure, elite intellectuals and reformers had seen that the new panaceas-democracy, education-did not bring the betterment they had once seemed to promise. But the elite classes were also affected by breakdowns in the old system that they saw or sensed, and that they sought desperately to avert against the will of those directly involved. "The world we have lost" was no loss to those who had lived in it, or so at least the evidence suggests. 

Indeed, was what had gone truly lost, or had it been discarded? Storebought goods, city styles, baker's bread, were considered superior and probably were. The music, songs, and dances of the city were preferred. To be sure, there was a good deal of coming and going about the process, so that idealized medieval pastourelles could turn into more or less popular shepherd songs that would be taken up in a later period by aristocrats playing at what they took to be vulgar ways; and folktales done over by Charles Perrault or the Comtesse d'Aulnoy could be borrowed back, as we have seen, for use in some veillée.\* Nurses and maids from the countryside brought rural ballads 

\* For a splendid illustration of the borrowing process at work, consider the story Jean-Michel Guilcher tells of a religious pastoral that was still performed in Lower Brittany in the first third of the twentieth century. Moving back through time, he traced its derivation to a late-eighteenthor early-nineteenth-century work in trégorrois dialect, inspired by a slightly older publication in vannetais dialect; this in turn was based on a "pastoral play" published in French in the early

into town kitchens and nurseries, where the young of the upper classes learned them.29 But most of the current flowed outward from the city. The codes and ways of the upper classes were seen as better and deliberately imitated by the rest. Servants and artisans imitated the bourgeois; peasants imitated servants and artisans. The crux was not contact but opportunity. 

Why had contact alone not carried things further? Even secluded communities, after all, had contacts with the world around them, including the urban world, throughout our period and long before. Apparently isolated bastions-the Pyrenees, the Limousin, Auvergne, even Brittany-were crossed by travelers (sometimes in large groups) and touched by all sorts of influences. Peasants in those regions knew about events, techniques, languages, social changes, but viewed them naturally in terms of their own interests--- that is, in terms of a particular economic base and social form. It was not that the world passed them by, but rather that they accepted only what they could recognize as suitable until such time as economic and social development made a wholesale acceptance seem sensible. 

Since for a long time they recognized few changes indeed as suitable, the peasant masses were widely regarded as passive, stubborn, and stupid.\* Yet we can see now that their narrow vision was the vision of frightened men in desperate circumstances; that the village was a lifeboat striving to keep afloat in heavy seas, its culture a combination of discipline and reassurance designed to keep its occupants alive. Insecurity was the rule, existence consistently marginal. Tradition, routine, vigorous adherence to the family and the community—and to their rules--alone made existence possible. The village was an association for mutual aid.30 Lands, pastures, and ovens were generally ruled in common; dates for sowing and harvesting were set for one and all. Since all had to pull together, no deviance could be tolerated.† 

eighteenth century at Caen, then at Rennes and Nantes, which was based on still older forms going back to the New Testament mystery plays still alive in sixteenth-century France. ("Conservation et renouvellement dans la culture paysanne ancienne de Basse-Bretagne," Arts et traditions populaires, 1967, pp. 1-18.) 

\* More apt is the suggestive observation of Philip G. Hamerton that the peasants he saw were at once full of intelligence and unbelievably ignorant, their intelligence operating in one sphere and shutting out everything outside it (Round My House, pp. 228, 229). 

+ We have seen that this included both public and private behavior. Conformity was a major virtue: "O faut venter du vent qui vente," they said in Saintonge, where orighinau was the supreme insult thrown at a nonconformist neighbor (Raymond Doussinet, Le Paysan santongeais, pp. 305, 382). The slightest difference could provoke resentment; relations between neighbors or kin were dominated by envy and the fear of arousing it. Even marriage songs recognized this: "Lous nous espous qu'au espousat, /Au despieyt dous qui an mau parlat. / S'abèu crebat tous lous yelous, / Qu'auren crebat tous sounque nous. / S'abèu crebat aques matin, / Qu'en auré crebat binte cinq." (C. Daugé, Le Mariage et la famille en Gascogne, pp. 88-89.) Presumably one more reason why so many country men, and women even more, seized the opportunity to leave their village for the town. What sociologists regard as the alienations of urban living must have appeared as emancipation to them. 

[[480]]

CHANGE AND ASSIMILATION 

In such circumstances, innovation was almost inconceivable. Routine ruled: the structural balance attained by a long process of trial and error, reinforced by isolation and physical circumstances. At Tarascon (Ariège) in 1852, “the agricultural population thinks present agricultural methods have reached their peak of development and must not be set aside, being the fruit of long experience." Wisdom was doing things the way they always had been done, the way they were supposed to be done. "If you do as your neighbor does, you do neither ill nor well," advises a proverb of Franche-Comté. To the peasant, routine connoted not mindless labor but precious experience, what had worked and hence would work again, the accumulated wisdom without which life could not be maintained. For the Landais farmer, wrote Jean Ricard in 1911, the past was "a guarantee of the present; in freeing himself from it he would fear to compromise the future.' 

[[931]]

Ricard and other modernizers found this incomprehensible. "Bent under a yoke of habit," read an 1831 report, the peasant "wants to live as his father lived, less out of respect for the ancients than from a blind suspicion of anything new."32 Yet the suspicion was not necessarily blind. Practices and techniques that peasants fought to preserve may have hampered general progress, but were of vital importance to themselves. The conflict was not between changing techniques and backward minds, let alone between progress and obstinate reaction; it was between two kinds of interests, the peasant's being no more inherently blind than the capitalist's. In the short run, which was all most peasants could afford, there is no reason why they should have welcomed innovations that harmed their interests. Self-sacrifice would have been the greater blindness. 

This short-run rationale was often explicit. "Our alimentary needs," read a report from Cabannes (Ariège) in 1852 about a proposed improvement in cattle-raising methods, "prevent us from attempting anything of this sort, let alone turning the fields to pasture." Economic interest suggested one thing; want and reality opposed it. The narrower the margin, the less the chance of experiment. Only the rich took chances or the irresponsible. Few understood this. Thus a prefect of the Second Empire could write of "the poor peasant without instruction, without reserves, without the necessary forethought to apply the great improving ideas and to await their results."33 Peasants knew better. Their forethought told them that without reserves they would not live to see the results of the most wonderful innovations. If they wanted to stay alive, they had to work with what they had.\* 

A book published in 1865 by a woman landowner in central France caviled against petite culture, the smallish farms (up to 20 acres, hence not so very 

\* In the long run, this caution became a habit that reinforced a natural wariness and negativism. Even when traditional crops or methods could safely, perhaps profitably, be abandoned to give new ones a trial, "the experiment is a risk, and few dare to risk loss in some bold enterprise whose failure is awaited by their scoffing neighbors" (Cornte de Neufbourg, Paysans, p. 18).

small!) that "encourage the peasants' love of routine and repugnance to pro- 

gress. 

"34 But what options did they have? Within a few lines it becomes clear that they lacked the capital to make improvements or take risks. Parcelization had its drawbacks, but for the peasants it was parcels or nothing. And of course they had no access to credit, bar usury. They were not mindless, let alone idle; they were realistic, and their reality was the lack of money. 

Where capital was lacking, innovations made little progress. To the French peasant a new technique could prove itself only by experience; and experiments were necessarily left to outsiders with the time, the means, and "modern" views of the virtues of novelty. There might have been more agricultural improvements if more land had been in the hands of owners with adequate capital, but then France would have been quite a different country. In any case, would the peasants have fared better? Christiane Marcilhacy quotes a teacher in Zola's Earth (1887) apostrophizing the peasants of Beauce: "You hope to fight with your two-cent tools,... you who know nothing, who want nothing, who stew in your routine."35 But as Marcilhacy shows, many a big tenant farmer came to grief when his improvements failed to pay off, and peasant routine often survived where modern initiative went under. 

Many peasants, says the Comte de Neufbourg in a book full of good sense and quite ignored, "live from day to day, and routine foresees things for them. We should not mock or destroy this routine: it would be missed, it is their wisdom." Subsistence farming-raising a bit of everything and making one's own bread and clothing-was a matter not of blind routine but of calculated necessity: "When one buys one's bread there is never any money 

left." Routine, concludes Daniel Faucher, is "the precious fruit of experience, a treasury of wisdom"; the peasant abandons it "only when assured that he can do so without damage." And that, as we have seen, is what happened.\* 

Traditional communities continued to operate in the traditional manner as long as conditions retained their traditional shape: low productivity, market fluctuations beyond the producer's control, a low rate of savings, little surplus. What surplus the peasant could accumulate was taken from him in taxes or usurious interest, spent on church buildings and feasts, or invested in land. But land did not increase total production until capital investment in improvements became both possible and thinkable. And this did not happen until

Mendras tells how the agriculture of the canton of Sauve (Gard) passed from polyculture to specialization. There the peasants had practiced a mixed farming that was well adapted to autarky and little cash until late in the eighteenth century, when rising taxes and manorial dues forced them to find a way of raising cash. They added mulberry trees to their store of crops and began to raise and sell silkworms, a course they had previously resisted but now saw as the most economical and convenient way out of their current pass. This change gradually introduced them to the market economy. A nineteenth-century crisis in the silk market led to a new adaptation, this time to the vine. With that, they had to give up their traditional polyculture altogether, but the mulberry had smoothed the way for the changeover, especially as far as mentalities were concerned. (Esprit, June 1955, p. 919.)

CHANGE AND ASSIMILATION 

the market became an accessible reality, that is, until the expanding communications network brought it within reach. Economic growth could then proceed at a faster pace, and producers could literally change their minds about what they were doing and to what end. Road and rail were the decisive factors in this change. Schools shaped and accelerated it. 

The very rhythm of life and work changed. People's bodies had operated at a pace set by the heart and lungs. Working songs, walking songs, afterworking songs had imitated the rhythm of the work. Plowmen had worked to the rhythm of horses or oxen. Hoers would take a bite out of a hunk of bread, throw it ahead of them, hoe their way up to it, and bite and throw again. Threshers' songs reproduced the rhythm of the flails:37 

Pas 

par pas, haut, bas, 

Lous flagels s'arrest oun pas. 

Machines, by divorcing labor and rhythm, cut popular songs off from lived experience, opening the way to urban tunes unrelated to the rhythms of labor. Along with the rhythm of work the whole rhythm of life changed. Labor became steadier, casual interruptions for rest fewer. Even the land got less rest. The French word for fallow, jachère, derives from the Latin iacere, "to rest"; and peasant logic accorded this right to the land as to themselves.38 Old practice bore out the sense of such reasoning; new practice made it out-of-date. The very use of terms like out-of-date reflects a viewpoint alien to the traditional order. In a world highly dependent on natural conditions, seasonal and liturgical rhythms governed people's sense of time. Every situation had its earlier precedent, equivalent, or analogy. It was in the past that people sought lessons for the present: not new lessons but old ones that were never out-ofdate. Past and present were not two but one: a continuum of time lived, not a series of units measured by the clock. A feast or a fire, a harvest good or bad, a family event, lived on in memory and served as a more natural point of reference than the calendar. Songs and tales about events a century old evoked powerful emotions.39 Proximity in time was relative, almost unimportant. 

Traditional time had no fixed units of measure; there was not even a break between work and leisure. Even the loss of time (comings and goings, pauses, waiting) passed largely unnoticed because integrated in routine and unquestioned. We have seen, for example, that land was often counted in the units of man or animal time it took to work it: not a fixed measure but one relative to conditions. Conditions also determined the value of time: it was cheap, very cheap, when everything else was scarce. A woman would walk from her village to the market, 35 km each way, to sell her dozen 

to sell her dozen eggs at 14 sous rather than 12; would wait the day out in any kind of weather to sell her butter at 20 sous rather than 19.40 A late-nineteenth-century postcard showing a peasant "Off to the Market" in a two-wheeled donkey cart sums things up:

year 

A few peasants had watches and displayed them with pride. But even to them a watch was "a horse in the stable," useless when one could refer to cockcrows, to the stars, to the sun's touching this or that rock or tree, or to one's own shadow. As with watches, so with the calendar. The calendar meant nothing, the rhythm of seasons everything. In Auvergne the basic division was between winter, from All Souls to Saint George's day (November 1-April 23), and summer, when beasts could sleep out of doors. In Franche- Comté, summer was divided not into months but into "times": the time for going outdoors (patchi fou, going out), essentially spring; the times for haying and for harvesting. In the late autumn and winter, there were "times" for sewing and for vieillin (veillées).\*2

In the French language, temps refers to both weather and duration: two concepts to us but not to the peasant whose longer hours of work came in the fair weather of the summer. To the farmer, time is work; life is work; work brings subsistence and independence. In the city, time and work have another meaning: productivity, surplus, profit, comfort, leisure. In late-nineteenthcentury France these two notions of time clashed, and one disappeared.\* No other outcome was possible. The new world of markets and of schools worked only on its kind of time; and the difference was fundamental. Old skills based on watching and imitating what one's elders did, old forms of intuition learned from the wise or simply discovered in oneself, gave way before the new techniques and practices of rationality. Success was achieved not by harder work, greater strength, or inspired guessing, but by superior reasoning. The new process was rational ("we do this because"), quantitative ("this way we turn out that much more"), abstract ("these are the rules"). Internalized rhythms of labor were replaced by learned skills and norms. A man who thinks his work is no worse, certainly, than one who does not; but he is certainly different. Just as the schools and the skills they taught created a new breed of children, so the machines when they came introduced a different relationship between 

\* Compare Pierre Bourdieu and Abdelmalek Sayad, Le Déracinement, p. 157. As time became a measurable quantity, it could then be "lost": a notion unknown to an economy that gave little thought to "fully employed" or "wasted" time. Labor, no longer diffuse, turned into a commodity that could be-indeed, should be quantified in terms of time. One could mouth saws like "time is money" until the cows came home: they made no sense as long as the one seemed endless and the other hardly real. Time only made sense when money made sense; and money was a part of modern technology that, we have seen, was only adopted late. By the time Bachelin wrote Le Serviteur (published in 1918, but composed on the eve of war), he had figured out that his father worked 12 minutes to earn five centimes, thus he had to work 24 minutes for a glass of red wine and two hours for a 50-centime packet of tobacco. "C'est une grande force dans la vie que d'avoir, comme étalon de ses besoins et de ses désirs, le prix d'une heure de son propre travail" (pp. 151-52). I think such standards and awareness were new.484

man and nature. The earth lost its sacredness, the gods their divinity, magic its power. Machines were not a bad thing: they replaced animals or men doing the work of animals. But they destroyed men's harmony with their world by rendering their hard-won skills and movements useless. The peasant's skilled hand was as little needed in the new world as his patois. Marx relates workers' alienation fundamentally to the question of who actually owned the means of production; but the alienation of the rural worker, where it occurred, lay less in being deprived of property than in the discontinuity between his body and his work. The results of work done by machine could be observed, but the sense of control and the pleasures of craftsmanship were gone. Traditionally work was a way of life, not just a way of earning a living. Man at work was almost the whole of man. The man with a machine was only half a working unit, and in productivity terms the less important half.\* 

Peasants did not keep accounts. What they did with their time was determined not by the market but by family needs, and working any harder than most people did was probably impossible anyway. The universal view was that of an old winegrower in Mâconnais: "When a man works as hard as he can, he must earn enough to feed himself and keep his family alive. That is justice."\* 

pay.

Only around 1900-1905, wrote an Aveyron observer, did peasants there begin to grasp 

"the notions of productivity and the use of time."\*\* Only about then did many see at last that subsistence farming, far from the road to a glorious autonomy, was the essence of futility and self-exploitation. Like the nineteenth-century factory worker before him, the twentieth-century peasant came to see work in a new light: no longer for subsistence but for 

The logic of a money economy took over. One result was that since all work was expected to produce cash revenue in proportion to the effort involved, a lot of work was seen as no longer worth doing. Where work had once encompassed a multitude of undertakings-weeding, mending enclosures or buildings or tools, pruning or cutting trees, protecting young shoots against cattle, splitting firewood, making rope or baskets-it was now judged by the norms of salaried labor. Tasks that did not yield ready returns in cash were considered not work but pottering, like going around the fields to look them over. Modern people paid others to do them or let them go undone.

Most of all this is neither good nor bad. It is. It happened. It is the essence of what happened in France between 1870 and 1914. 

\* V. Dupont, Quand Eve filait, p. 9. This confirms what we know already, that official values shaded imperceptibly into local ones. The work ethic had been part of official morality and religion since the seventeenth century, of common sense as far back as the mind can go. It did not take Guizot or the teaching of the schools to spread it. Thrift, forethought, self-help, were no strangers to the peasant. Only their possibilities were severely limited. Peasants knew all about deferred gratification. Only there was so little gratification to defer that it left scarcely a mark on statistics. What changed in the nineteenth century, and the more so as the century moved on, were the limits of possibility, hence the applicability of values known but relatively irrelevant before that time, a matter of degree.
