Markets and fairs were major cogs in the wheels of the old economy, turntables of essential exchanges, mostly within a limited local context. Markets were frequent, at least weekly, and there one sold and bought items of everyday necessity for the most part food. Fairs were periodic and offered a wider choice of goods-apparel, cattle, tools, and household utensils—as well as entertainment. All rural societies included fairly large numbers of landless peasants and varying numbers of artisans or forest folk, or both, who had to buy some or all of their food, albeit from their neighbors.">

  <p>Grace is given of God, but knowledge is bought in the market.</p>
<p>ARTHUR HUGH CLOUGH</p>
<p>THE EVOLUTION OF Sociability in the countryside can be studied—and it should be studied, for here we can afford only passing attention-in two other domains: that of the public marketplace, and that of the semiprivate but highly communal veillée.</p>
<p>Markets and fairs were major cogs in the wheels of the old economy, turntables of essential exchanges, mostly within a limited local context. Markets were frequent, at least weekly, and there one sold and bought items of everyday necessity for the most part food. Fairs were periodic and offered a wider choice of goods-apparel, cattle, tools, and household utensils—as well as entertainment. All rural societies included fairly large numbers of landless peasants and varying numbers of artisans or forest folk, or both, who had to buy some or all of their food, albeit from their neighbors.</p>
<p>Like the traditional seasonal migrations, the markets played their part in maintaining archaic institutions by permitting their clientele to make ends meet. Poor people bought and sold small quantities, and so had to market frequently. In a society of the ancient model the marketplace replaces nonexistent shops and provides what people in towns have learned to take for granted: the opportunity to procure what one needs or wants.</p>
<p>The frequency of markets grew, however, when burghers, their numbers growing and their standards rising after the 1830&rsquo;s, began to buy their butter, cheese, milk, and eggs fresh to improve their daily diet. Peasant women began to sell poultry or dairy products in the market weekly instead of five or six times a year, and the novel cash income gradually turned them also into purchasers in the marketplace for luxuries once homemade or done without: shoes, kerchiefs, umbrellas, smocks, salt fish and butcher&rsquo;s meat. Industrial products penetrated the rural world and rural industry declined, as we have seen. But the cash to buy garments or metal plowshares, scythe blades or baker&rsquo;s bread at the fair, was earned in the market. And the fair itself grew as cattle-raising</p>

<p>developed, providing a new focus of interest and resources that made fairs busier, more numerous, and more significant in both economic and social</p>
<p>terms.</p>
<p>The fair had had its own importance before this happened or began to happen. While industry was localized and communications rare and mediocre, the fairs held in little towns were indispensable centers of exchange. They could be very small indeed, like the one held at Songy in Marne, which nevertheless raised the town out of the class of surrounding villages, made it seem an important bourg, and brought local business to life.1 After all, the nearest sizable town, the sub-prefecture at Vitry, was six leagues away, a considerable enterprise over the bad roads of the mid-nineteenth century. But where fairs were few or lacking because of isolation, as in the Morvan, inhabitants did not hesitate to go a long way to a famous fair and feast like the annual fair on the first Wednesday in May that covered the otherwise barren Mount Beuvray (at the extreme limit of Saône-et-Loire and Nièvre) with tents, stands, beasts, and improvised dramshops, and attracted thousands. Also popular were the lowland fairs, where Morvandiaux could exchange their cattle for apparel, leather, tools, candles, whatever they might need, or highland Ariégeois their wool for grain.2 Better roads after mid-century would bring an orgy of trade-comparatively speaking at least, when one remembers previous conditions. The trade went with civilization and was explicitly so perceived; witness the Tarn-et-Garonne saying about a poor southwestern village, Monbéqui, not far from the Garonne: &ldquo;A Mountbéqui, soun mau civilisats. N&rsquo;au pas ni fièro ni mercat&rdquo; (At Monbéqui they are not civilized. They have neither fair nor market).3</p>
<p>Every small town, aware of the activity and gain a fair could bring, wanted one of its own; and imperial decrees in 1852 and 1864 simplified the process of obtaining permission to establish one or add to those already in existence. Yet there seems to have been no great explosion of new fairs in more backward areas under the Second Empire, but on the contrary a very moderate increase compared with the growth that had taken place since the 1820&rsquo;s and the boom that followed the mid-1870&rsquo;s. Of Puy-de-Dôme&rsquo;s 172 annual fairs in 1903, 44 were said to have existed from time immemorial, 21 had been set up before 1850, and 14 dated from between 1851 and 1870. Then came a flood: 39 new fairs in 1871-80, 21 more in 1881-90, and another 33 in 1891-1903. The coincidence with the building of secondary roads seems quite apparent.</p>
<p>Yet though more roads meant more trade, and more trade more fairs, more fairs also meant less trade for each.* Not quite, of course, because the cattle</p>
<p>* See Frédéric Le Guyader in Olivier Perrin and Alex Bouet, Breiz Izel, p. 184, noting, in 1914, that the vast multiplication of fairs since the 1830&rsquo;s had made for smaller attendance at each and the decline of even the most glorious. Other factors probably contributed to the general decline, notably the tendency of dealers to buy directly from the farm and the accessibility of retail shops.</p>
<p>Markets and Fairs</p>
<p>[[409]]</p>
<p>trade was rising in importance. Still, by the 1870&rsquo;s observers who saw that the popularity of fairs was inverse to the facility of communications noted that in the lowlands railways made the fairs decline. In the late 1870&rsquo;s and the 1880&rsquo;s fairs continued to be regional events in the mountain regions of Ardèche. But by 1889 Port-Dieu (Corrèze), an important entrepôt since the bridging of the Dordogne in 1845 to connect Corrèze and Puy-de-Dôme, was feeling the impact. The trade of its 14 annual fairs (twice as many as in the eighteenth century) was described as &ldquo;slight.&rdquo; And at Céret (Pyrénées-Orientales) both the fair and the fête of 1896 showed disappointing results.</p>
<p>As long as roads were bad, a few miles could make a difference. Once they were improved, a bigger center nearby could kill a small one. In Cantal the bourg of Jussac, whose fairs had been well known for wool and cattle, could not survive the pull of Aurillac, only some six miles south. Other centers declined because they were ill-placed in relation to new roads, like Rochegoude and Besse, or to railroads, like Maillargues dethroned by Allanche and Condat by Riom-es-Montagne, and even, finally, Moissac when the new bourg of Neussargues became a railway junction. In western Ardèche old-established fairs like Saint-Etienne-de-Lugdarès, in a closed valley, and Loubaresse, once a crossroads of mule-trains, declined, while Langogne benefited from its position on a new railway line. In Ariège, too, with trains passing the Pyrenees to both the east and the west, the lively mule trade of mid-century wasted away and the region&rsquo;s fairs with it. Even those fairs that had prospered found retail trade beginning to destroy their purpose. By 1916 Edouard Herriot described their economic function as antiquated and out of date. By the 1920&rsquo;s the automobile would make this even truer. Small market towns had become shopping centers, and things that used to be bought once a year in bulk could be picked up as the need arose, on the occasion of the weekly visit to the market.7</p>
<p>But none of this really mattered, because one of the major functions of the market and fair was social. In Béarn, indeed, one said of an uncouth person who could not be trusted in company that &ldquo;he&rsquo;s not for the fair.&rdquo; And, while the economic functions of the marketplace fluctuated, its social role continued to increase. Neither self-sufficiency nor other shopping facilities deterred people from attending a market that gathered in the neighborhood to exchange news even more than goods. The inland Bretons, who hardly ever traveled otherwise, did not hesitate to spend part of the year on the road because of a desperate need-&ldquo;their malady&rdquo;-that drove them to attend fairs even when they had nothing to buy or sell. In Finistère during the July Monarchy farm servants contracted not only for wages, but also for so many days off a year to attend markets or fairs. And Elie Reynier says the same about Vivarais: &ldquo;The market is the social and sociable life of rural people dispersed throughout the countryside.&rdquo; Fairs were feasts (feriae). Most of them coincided with religious occasions: Whitsun and Trinity Sunday in June, Assumption in</p>
<p>[[410]]</p>
<p>CHANGE AND ASSIMILATION</p>
<p>August, but especially the feasts of Saint John (June 24), Saint James (July 24), Saint Bartholomew (August 24), Saint Matthew (September 21), Saints Simon and June (October 28), Saints Martin and Andrew in November.</p>
<p>One of the elements of every feast was that it attracted merchants. Aiguesmortes actually called its festival la foire, the fair; and many festivals were known as apport or rapport, that is to say, the place where one brought something, hence a market. By modern times the two were inextricably intertwined. &ldquo;One never saw a fair without a feast,&rdquo; a peasant from Brie was quoted as saying in 1939.10 The motives for attendance were equally mixed. Still, the stands of itinerant peddlers were above all a show, and beside them were the stands, tents, cabins, or open-air pitches of showmen and strolling players: &ldquo;charlatans, magicians, musicians and singers, bohemians and gamblers,&rdquo; wrote the police superintendent of Mirande (Gers) in 1876. Patent remedies were sold by the heirs of the great Cabotin to a patter accompanied by cymbals, clarinets, or trumpets; teeth were pulled, unbreakable chains were broken, swords swallowed, and flames breathed out. There were sellers of images, almanacs, and broadsheets. There were specialists who spelled out and explained ballads before they sold them. There was much drink, and there was dancing. In Auvergne and Rouergue today &ldquo;the old fairs&rdquo; are the ones where a person dances; and the old-fashioned fair like the old pilgrimage combined religious ceremony and marketing with a marriage mart.11</p>
<p>Some fairs were devoted to this latter purpose, notably the marriage fairs at Périzé (Finistère), Challans (Vendée), and Saint-Didier-sous-Rochefort (Loire). But there were many foires des jeunes or des jeunesses where young people came to meet, mix, and court, to break out of the narrow endogamy of village society. Indeed, several sayings warned against letting girls frequent too many markets or fairs, for, as in Gascony:</p>
<p>Hilhe qui galope lous marcats,</p>
<p>Nou damoure goayre chens pecats.</p>
<p>In this case, as in others, the fair provided the chief or only opportunity for contact with the external world.&quot;</p>
<p>[[12]]</p>
<p>This is what peasants appreciated, this and the opportunity to find out things, pick up information, meet acquaintances from beyond the village, look at new doings, relax, get drunk.* In 1874 the artists of Epinal were turning out colored pictures that showed that fairs were fun. By 1882 in the Montagne Noire of the southwest “fairs are no longer&hellip; meeting-places for those who have commodities to buy or sell. They are as much gatherings for entertainment as for business or trade.&quot; Most of those who went were attracted not by the prospect of making a deal but by curiosity, &ldquo;the desire to spend the day sauntering about.&rdquo; For Auvergnats fairs were a holiday.13 By the eve of</p>
<p>• They still do, even though the economic role of fairs has largely waned.</p>
<p>Markets and Fairs</p>
<p>4II</p>
<p>the war, just when economists were telling us that the economic function of fairs was waning or had waned, they seem to have been at the height of their vogue in hitherto isolated regions. In Gascony the peasants, &ldquo;bored with monotonous and solitary tasks,&rdquo; had taken up buying and selling cattle because it gave</p>
<p>them a chance to get away from routine labor and an excuse to attend fairs, meet people, enjoy the fun of trading, which was like gambling for them. In some villages about one-third of the population was involved in the new pastime, though it brought little or no economic profit. In the Limousin, too, peasants developed a passion for fairs; any pretext to get to one served, even driving a few sheep that one meant to drive back home come evening time. &ldquo;There is even a sort of shame about not going.&rdquo;</p>
<p>[[14]]</p>
<p>This was quite true, though there was more to it. Southwestern peasants had raised no cattle until the bourgeois landowners for whom they sharecropped sold off their properties. As the estates began to be broken up</p>
<p>in the last third of the century and their lands fell into peasants&rsquo; hands, small landowners, enjoying a new sense of dignity, shifted from corn bread to the wheaten bread that had been a privilege of the upper classes. For the same reasons, they began to breed and trade in cattle. It is true that with the owners gone more farmers needed their own draft animals. But above all, dealing in cattle had been a favorite speculation of the former owners.15 Buoyed by his new dignity as his own master, the peasant would take over the old privilege, which brought with it a certain sense of leisure, though not revenues, since accounts suggest that Gascon breeding methods were mediocre. The profit that he sought was a social one.</p>
<p>How far was this perceived? Moralistic observers of the 1880&rsquo;s like Henri Baudrillart and Alexandre Layet have commented on and deplored the new delight in socializing.* A Limousin priest, however, reviewed the development in a more sensible light. The fairs, wrote Père Gorse in 1895, were a new factor in the peasant&rsquo;s life. They were the subject that interested him most—what theaters or horse races were for city folk. The peasant honored all fair days within a radius of about 30 miles and discriminated among their specialties. He looked for any pretext to go: selling a rabbit or a dozen eggs, or buying shoes when the village shoemaker lived next door. The truth was that he simply wanted to talk to people and to know how things were going. Economists criticized this: the peasants should waste less time, work more, drink and gallivant less. But Gorse saw the fair as a well-earned respite and, also, as a source of emulation.18</p>
<p>It may well be that fairs did inspire the imitation of urban ways and roles just at the time when peasants were ready to follow them. Contact with city</p>
<p>The attitude should be familiar to the reader. In 1859 the General Council of Rhône refused all applications for new fairs with the argument that for country people fairs were simply occasions for idleness and dissipation, drawing them away from their work and nearly always ending in disorder and debauchery (Gilbert Garrier, Paysans du Beaujolais, 1: 340).</p>
<p>[[412]]</p>
<p>CHANGE AND ASSIMILATION</p>
<p>folk had resulted chiefly in distrust. Exchange had been restricted to the commercial plane, and the city man was inevitably a slicker, greedy and hard. Now there are indications that there was more to it. There is the comment of an agronomist in 1884, who felt that Limousin peasants learned to handle French much better at fairs than in school. There is the thought that the peasant had the material means and the physical opportunity to take it a bit more easy. Drink itself, for which so many reproached the peasants, was an urban luxury. So was consciously or unconsciously wasting time, or having time to waste, or chatting on any day but Sunday. And so was having novelties to talk about: &ldquo;One can talk about [the fair] for a week, and then talk about the next,&rdquo; remarked G.-M. Coissac in 1913. But even critics admitted that the peasants were learning about commodity and cattle prices, and that they had learned to meet glib traders on pretty equal terms. The market was not only a place to trade but also an attitude, a frame of mind, and this was a novel acquisition for most rural folk.17</p>
