“YOU DON’T NEED to go to America to see savages,” mused a Parisian as he strolled through the Burgundian countryside of the 1840’s. “Here are the Redskins of Fenimore Cooper.” Thus Balzac, in his Paysans (1844). Indeed, there is a great deal of evidence to suggest that vast parts of nineteenthcentury France were inhabited by savages. Louis Chevalier has told us how this label was pinned on the urban poor-classe laborieuse, classe dangereuse -around mid-century. But it can as readily be applied, and for a longer period of time, to sections of the rural population-equally strange and little known, equally hard-working though perhaps less dangerous for being less concentrated.">

<p>Il y aurait de bons courriers à faire de France et de pays que nous croyons connus; l&rsquo;étrange n&rsquo;est pas toujours au pays étranger; on ferait d&rsquo;immenses découvertes chez soi; on obtiendrait de singuliers résultats si l&rsquo;on savait regarder le pays habituel d&rsquo;un regard inhabitué; regarder la France comme si on n&rsquo;en était pas.</p>
<p>CHARLES PÉGUY</p>
<p>&ldquo;YOU DON&rsquo;T NEED to go to America to see savages,&rdquo; mused a Parisian as he strolled through the Burgundian countryside of the 1840&rsquo;s. &ldquo;Here are the Redskins of Fenimore Cooper.&rdquo; Thus Balzac, in his Paysans (1844). Indeed, there is a great deal of evidence to suggest that vast parts of nineteenthcentury France were inhabited by savages. Louis Chevalier has told us how this label was pinned on the urban poor-classe laborieuse, classe dangereuse -around mid-century. But it can as readily be applied, and for a longer period of time, to sections of the rural population-equally strange and little known, equally hard-working though perhaps less dangerous for being less concentrated.</p>
<p>In 1831, to reach no further back, the prefect of Ariège described the population of his Pyrenean valleys as savage “and as brutal as the bears it breeds.&quot; In 1840, an army staff officer found the Morvandiaux of Fours &ldquo;uttering cries as savage as the beasts themselves.&rdquo; Officials, soldiers-who else would venture into the wild countryside, especially the lost regions south of the Loire? In 1843, an infantry battalion marching through the marshy Landes northeast of Dax discovered still more savages: poor, backward, wild.1 The whole region was savage: wastelands, marshes, moors, heath. In 1832, when Georges (later Baron) Haussmann visited the district of Houeillès in the southwest corner of Lot-et-Garonne, he found no road or landmark, and the highway inspector who guided him had to use a compass.2 These were only the petites landes; in the Landes proper, as the proverb had it, birds crossing the moors had to carry their own food. Before 1857, when the planting of stands of pine ushered in the dawn of a new era (but only a dim dawn as yet), references to savagery abound, applied equally to the landscape, the conditions, and the population. Pilgrims en route to Santiago de Compostela feared to cross the Landes because they found there &ldquo;neither bread nor wine nor fish nor fountain.”3 Indeed, Taine declared that he preferred the desert. When Edouard4</p>
<p>Feret published his massive Statistique générale du département de la Gironde in 1874, the draining of marshy Médoc was still within living memory, and many Bordelais remembered the fevers and stagnant waters that justified its original name—in medio aquae. As for the great moors to the south of Bordeaux, they still stood unimproved-savage, waterless, the home of pellagra and fever among a population as wild as its environment.* +++(5)+++</p>
<p>From Bordeaux to Bayonne all was wilderness. Savagery also from the Iled&rsquo;Yeu, off the Atlantic coast, to the Drôme in the east, where in 1857 a colonel expressed the hope that railways might improve the lot of &ldquo;populations two or three centuries behind their fellows&rdquo; and eliminate &ldquo;the savage instincts born of isolation and of misery.&rdquo; The burghers of Tulle called peasants peccata (sins), and a Corrèze priest, offspring of a humble family of that prefecture but banished to a rural parish, noted with contempt: &ldquo;the</p>
<p>peasant is just that, sin, original sin, still persistent and visible in all its naïve brutality.&rsquo; This observation, recorded by Joseph Roux, was probably jotted down at the beginning of the Third Republic, but it reflects a consensus that runs through the first three-quarters of the century. “The countryman shows, in his every feature, the face of misery and woe: his eyes are uncertain, timid, his face expressionless, his gait slow and clumsy; his long hair falling over his shoulders gives him a somber air&rdquo; (Haute-Vienne, 1822). Terrible ignorance, superstition, dirt (Morbihan, 1822). Lazy, greedy, avaricious, and suspicious (Landes, 1843). Foulness, rags, miserable savagery (Loire-Inférieure, 1850). &ldquo;Vulgar, hardly civilized, their nature meek but wild” (Loire, 1862). No wonder that in 1865 a Limousin landowner had recourse to terms not unlike those La Bruyère had used 200 years before: &ldquo;animals with two feet, hardly resembling a man. [The peasant&rsquo;s] clothes are filthy; under his thick skin one cannot see the blood flow. The wild, dull gaze betrays no flicker of thought in the brain of this being, morally and physically atrophied.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The popular risings of December 1851 produced their own crop of references: savage horde, a land of savages, barbarians. One does well to remember that to hurl the abusive expression sauvage at someone was considered slanderous and could lead to a fine or even a prison sentence if a case came to court.1o Yet the litany goes on: in the early 1860&rsquo;s the savagery is waning in Nièvre, but it persists into the 1870&rsquo;s in Sarthe, where the &ldquo;savage&rdquo; moorland people live like &ldquo;troglodytes&rdquo; and sleep near the fire in their huts &ldquo;on stalks of briar like cats on wood shavings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It persists in Brittany, too, where the children entering school &ldquo;are like those of countries where civilization has not penetrated: savage, dirty, and don&rsquo;t understand a word of the language” (1880).12</p>
<p>And a musical folklorist ranging the west from Vendée to the Pyrenees compared the local folk to children and savages who, happily, like all primitive peoples, showed a pronounced taste for rhythm.13</p>
<p>As late as 1903, the theme of rural savagery was still being sounded by a professional travel writer, who on a visit to the Limousin, just north of Brive, was struck by the</p>
<p>[[5]]</p>
<p>wild character of the region and the &ldquo;huttes de sauvages&rdquo; in which the people lived.1 What a relief after the wildness of the interminable chestnut groves to reach a township, however small. Civilization is urban (civic, civil, civilian, civilized), and so of course is urbanity; just as polity, politeness, politics, and police spring from polis-the city again.</p>
<p>Civilization is what the peasants lacked. In 1850 the Gramont Law making the ill-treatment of domestic animals a misdemeanor was inspired by the wish to &ldquo;civilize people&rdquo; and children.15 The 1850&rsquo;s, in fact, never hesitated to make that point. A Beauce priest felt that his parishioners&rsquo; greatest need was to become civilized.16 In Haute-Loire, the boatmen of the Allier River showed a strikingly higher &ldquo;degree of civilization,&rdquo; thanks to the &ldquo;more civilized nations&rdquo; they met on the way to Paris. So did the men of Saint-Didier, where commercial relations with Saint-Etienne had made for &ldquo;a more advanced civilization.&ldquo;1 In Morvan, by contrast, an 1857 guidebook noted that the villages were &ldquo;hardly touched by civilization&rdquo;; military surveys exposed the same state of affairs in Lot and Aveyron.18</p>
<p>Between the 1860&rsquo;s and the 1880&rsquo;s we find repeated references in the reports of primary school inspectors to the progress of civilization and the role of the schools in civilizing the populations in whose midst they operated. What did such reports mean to contemporaries? We shall examine the question in detail in due course. Right now let us suggest that they reflected the prevailing belief that areas and groups of some importance were uncivilized, that is, unintegrated into, unassimilated to French civilization: poor, backward, ignorant, savage, barbarous, wild, living like beasts with their beasts. They had to be taught manners, morals, literacy, a knowledge of French, and of France, a sense of the legal and institutional structure beyond their immediate community. Léon Gambetta put all this in a nutshell in 1871: the peasants were &ldquo;intellectually several centuries behind the enlightened part of the country&rdquo;; there was &ldquo;an enormous distance between them and us&hellip; between those who speak our language and those many of our compatriots [who], cruel as it is to say so, can no more than stammer in it&rdquo;; material property had to &ldquo;become the means of their moral progress,&rdquo; that is, of their civilization.19 The peasant had to be integrated into the national society, economy, and culture: the culture of the city and of the City par excellence, Paris.</p>
<p>Progress reports mark the campaign to do so: in the Morbihan of 1880 civilization had yet to penetrate the savage interior and make it similar to the rest of France; but in Ardèche, &ldquo;softer and politer habits are replacing rude, coarse, and savage ways,&rdquo; and in the Atlantic West the old customs were being &ldquo;swept out by civilization.&ldquo;2° Until the final success of the campaign, the countryman would continue to be, in the words of two southwestern observers, a rough and incomplete draft of the truly civilized man.'</p>
<p>[[21]]</p>
<p>Incomplete, of course, in terms of a model to which he did not conform, and for good reason: he knew nothing of it. A cultural and political aboriginal,</p>
<p>[[6]]</p>
<p>like to beasts and children, and one whom even sympathetic observers found decidedly odd. In 1830 Stendhal spoke of that deadly triangle between Bordeaux, Bayonne, and Valence, where &ldquo;people believe in witches, don&rsquo;t know how to read, and don&rsquo;t speak French.&rdquo; And Flaubert, walking around Rosporden fair in 1846 like a tourist through some exotic bazaar, noted of the peasants around him: &ldquo;suspicious, anxious, bewildered by everything he sees and doesn&rsquo;t understand, he makes great haste to leave the town.&ldquo;22 However keen his vision, Flaubert made the great mistake of judging the peasant by the way he behaved in town, a place that he came to only when he had to. &ldquo;Because he finds only people who assume a superior and mocking air with him,&rdquo; explained an observer in Bourbonnais, the peasant was always ill at ease and constrained in town, and superficial observers took this as evidence of &ldquo;savagery and dissimulation.&rdquo; In effect the savagery was dissimulation, enhanced by surliness. This would be worse in an area like Brittany, where the peasant could not be sure who among the townsmen (apart from small tradesmen and artisans) spoke his language.23 As we shall see, French-speakers there and elsewhere needed interpreters, which did not make for easier communication or mutual understanding.</p>
<p>Ill at ease in urban settings, the peasant made his urban observers ill at ease; their opinion of him was the mirror image of his mistrust of them. Writing in the 1860&rsquo;s, one observer of the southwestern peasants-who, he was sure, hated and feared him-could not hide his own fear of them, or his contempt. And a squire near Nantes could not help noticing the way the peasants looked at him, “full of hatred and suspicion.&rdquo; &ldquo;Ignorant, full of prejudices,&rdquo; wrote an officer, speaking of the population near Le Mans, &ldquo;they have no scruples in craft or in deceit.&rdquo; Ignorance, apathy, slackness, sloth, inertia, a brutal, grasping, dissembling, and hypocritical nature, are variously attributed to malice, poverty, and undernourishment.25 We shall hear more of this later. At any rate, what could one expect? The peasant did not reason; he was selfish and superstitious. He was insensitive to beauty, indifferent to his surroundings. He was envious and detested anyone who tried to better himself.28 City dwellers, who often (as in the colonial cities of Brittany) did not understand the rural language, despised the peasants, exaggerated their savagery, insisted on the more picturesque-hence backward-aspects of their activities, and sometimes compared them unfavorably with other colonized peoples in North Africa and the New World.&rdquo; In nineteenth-century Brest it was not unusual to hear the surrounding countryside described as &ldquo;the bush&rdquo;: brousse or cambrousse. But colonial parallels were little needed when the armory of prejudice was so well stocked: &ldquo;Les pommes de terre pour les cochons, les épluchures pour les Bretons.&ldquo;28</p>
<p>In the mid-eighteenth century, the famous Encyclopédie had expressed the established view: &ldquo;Many people see little difference between this class of men and the animals they use to farm our lands; this manner of thinking is very</p>
<p>[[7]]</p>
<p>old and it is likely that it will endure a very long time.&rdquo; It did. During the Revolution, writes Jules Bois, the urban national guard in the Maine had the most profound contempt for the rural barbarians of their region and even carried back necklaces of ears and noses from their incursions into the rebellious countryside. Nineteenth-century historians of the Vendée, in their turn, denied that country people could have any purpose or ideas apart from those suggested by outside sources.29 This theme, which recurred time and again in discussions of popular culture, perpetuated the notion of the mindless dolt whose thinking was inconsequential, if indeed he thought at all.</p>
<p>Early-nineteenth-century folklorists were criticized for showing interest in the &ldquo;low class of the population&rdquo; or for recording patois unworthy of attention, let alone respect. The Republicans of 1871, with the obvious intent of demeaning the majority of the national assembly, had called them &ldquo;rurals.”30 The rurals themselves agreed: it was demeaning to be a rural. To walk like a peasant or eat like a peasant was a sin that the little manuals of etiquette the peddlers sold condemned out of hand. Others used the notion of race in this same context. In Languedoc the unprivileged classes were regarded and regarded themselves as an inferior species: country girls, small, black, and wizened, were &ldquo;of another race&rdquo; than town girls. One result of this belief in a difference in kind was that well into the nineteenth century village midwives kneaded babies&rsquo; skulls in an effort &ldquo;more symbolic than real&rdquo; to give the little round heads of peasant babies the elongated skull that was associated with the more intelligent city folk.81 And just as the superiority assumed by strangers became a superiority attributed to strangers, so the pejorative judgments of strangers were incorporated into language, and hence inevitably into thought.</p>
<p>In Lower Brittany the word pémôr (originally used to describe a clodhopper) came to apply first to all peasants of that area, then to the Breton language itself. Terms like pem and beda followed the same route, originally signifying a clod, then a recruit, and finally any peasant of Lower Brittany. Similarly, in Franche-Comté the term for cow dung, bouz, gave rise to bouzon for peasant. Croquants, bumpkins, clodhoppers, culs-terreux-the list we began some pages back is far from complete. But as if all this was not enough, the word peasant itself became a term of contempt, to be rejected as an insult or accepted as an expression of humility, but in either case to be shed for a more honorable label at the first opportunity. And indeed an English traveler of the 1890&rsquo;s found the word falling into disuse: &ldquo;just as soon as he can, the peasant becomes a cultivateur!”82</p>
<p>The peasant was ashamed to be a peasant; he was ashamed to be uncivilized; he agreed with his judges that there was something valuable and vastly superior that he lacked, that French civilization and notably anything from Paris were clearly superior and clearly desirable: hence the vogue of the articles de Paris. Bretons twitted those who sought to ape a refined tone for</p>
<p>[[8]]</p>
<p>[[9933]]</p>
<p>speaking with &ldquo;a little Paris voice.&rdquo; But they also spoke admiringly of someone of a noble, easy, relaxed, smart bearing as being &ldquo;on a French footing.&rdquo; The ambiguity is clear and is a recurring phenomenon. We shall meet it again. But for the peasant to know himself uncouth, he had first to become aware of a model for couthness. And we shall see that in many places this took some time. Meanwhile, Paris and indeed France remained vague, faraway places for all too many-like the peasants of Ariège in the 1850&rsquo;s who imagined the Louvre to be a fantastic, fairytale palace, and the members of the imperial family to be some sort of storybook characters. No different, after all, from the city people for whom peasants remained &ldquo;almost as unknown as the red Indian to the tourist on a stagecoach between New York and Boston.&ldquo;34</p>
<p>We often read that farmers and peasants together constituted about 50 percent of France&rsquo;s working population in 1870, 45 percent in 1900, and 35 percent in 1930. What, we may well ask, is comprehended in the terms peasants and farmers? Were peasants a homogeneous professional group in any of those periods? Did the terms farmers and peasants describe similar realities at the various dates? In other words, when we talk of rural France and the rural populations in 1850, 1880, 1900, and after, are we talking of similar kinds of people, of similar frames of mind and similar shares in national life (differing only in statistical weight)? Or are we talking of a two-way evolution on the theory-as we were told long ago that no one can ever step in the same river twice, not only because the river will have changed, but because the person will have changed too?</p>
<p>This sort of question begs its answer, but a precise answer is difficult to formulate. Just how difficult, the rest of this book will show. One reason for the difficulty, among many, is that French ethnographers and anthropologists (not uniquely to be sure, but perhaps more than their counterparts elsewhere) have until recently eagerly studied exotic peoples while much neglecting their own; and the sociologists seem to have progressed straight from their early studies of primitive societies to the study of urban and industrial ones, dismissing the peasant realities around or just behind them.</p>
<p>Typically, the distinguished sociologist Maurice Halbwachs made a survey of life-styles in 1907 that covered 87 households, 33 of peasants, 54 of urban workers, but referred specifically only to the urban group (and even then concentrated mostly on five families of Paris workers) when he presented his data in 1939.35 In this he was no different from the rest of his contemporaries, for whom Parisian life and national life were leagues apart, and only the former counted. Thus, Ferdinand Buisson&rsquo;s great pedagogical dictionary of the 1880&rsquo;s, bible of a generation of schoolteachers, includes neither patois, nor idiome, nor dialecte. Similarly, at the turn of the century the great debate in and around the university turned on whether the teaching of Latin and Greek should take precedence over French, completely ignoring the problems posed</p>
<p>[[9]]</p>
<p>by and the lessons to be drawn from the still-current conflict between French and local speech. Among the spate of surveys that marked the fin-de-siècle and the early twentieth century, none looked beyond Paris and what went on there. And this without reservations, confident that the views and aspirations of a tiny minority taking itself for all did indeed represent all.</p>
<p>Perhaps that is why Haussmann, writing his memoirs in retirement, could refer to &ldquo;our country, the most &lsquo;one&rsquo; in the whole world,&rdquo; when France was still very far from one, and when he himself had been in a good position to see this with his own eyes in the administrative posts he had held through the July Monarchy and the Second Empire, before his fateful appointment to Paris. The myth was stronger than the reality.</p>
<h2 id="diversity">Diversity</h2>
<p>Yet the reality was inescapable. And the reality was diversity. One reason believers in the essential unity of France ignored this most obvious fact may have been that they took that unity for granted. But as the century advanced the division between country and town began to attract comment. The economist Adolphe Blanqui, who traveled a great deal through darkest France, partly on official missions of exploration, partly to prepare a survey of rural populations that unfortunately never saw the light of day, was one of the first to insist on it. In his preliminary findings, published in 1851, Blanqui noted: &ldquo;Two different peoples living on the same land a life so different that they seem foreign to each other, though united by the bonds of the most imperious centralization that ever existed.&rdquo; In the countryside, barbarism and misery were still the norm &ldquo;despite the civilizing movement taking over neighboring towns.&rdquo; In the high Alps and parts of Var and Isère, a simple wheelbarrow would be as extraordinary a sight as a locomotive. &ldquo;Village and city represent&hellip; two completely opposite ways of life.&rdquo; Comfort and well-being were found only in a few &ldquo;oases.&rdquo; And while towns were becoming more alike, country people continued to show a remarkable diversity from one region to another and even from one province to the next.</p>
<p>Diversity had not bothered earlier centuries very much. It seemed part of the nature of things, whether from place to place or between one social group and another. But the Revolution had brought with it the concept of national unity as an integral and integrating ideal at all levels, and the ideal of oneness stirred concern about its shortcomings. Diversity became imperfection, injustice, failure, something to be noted and to be remedied. The contrast Blanqui drew between administrative unity and deep differences in conditions and attitudes became a source of malaise.</p>
<p>In 1845 Benjamin Disraeli had published Sybil with its perceptive reference to the two nations &ldquo;between whom there is no intercourse and no sympathy; who are as ignorant of each other&rsquo;s habits, thoughts and feelings as if they were dwellers in different zones, or inhabitants of different planets; who are formed by a different breeding, are fed by a different food, are ordered by different manners, are not governed by the same laws.&rdquo; Disraeli was referring</p>
<p>IO</p>
<p>to the rich and the poor (&ldquo;the Privileged and the People&rdquo;), and to the reforms needed to knit a people together. His ideas, or very similar ones, were discussed and sometimes applied at the urban level. But they applied as aptly to France&rsquo;s rural situation&ndash;a situation noticed only rarely and by those few whose interest drew them to subjects that the dominant center deemed unimportant.</p>
<p>[[39]]</p>
<p>Blanqui had found occasion to remark that urban and rural civilization had always moved at a different pace, &ldquo;but nowhere is the distance separating them greater than in France.&rdquo; In the first history of peasants as such, published in 1856, the journalist Eugène Bonnemère predicted the hardening of social lines, culminating in two distinct races, city dwellers and countryfolk, living in mutual ignorance, and in two distinct Frances, different and hostile, that of the country and that of the towns. And if Gambetta, speaking at Belleville in 1875, felt the need to deny the antagonism between country and town (&ldquo;two Frances opposed one to the other&rdquo;), it must have been there when he spoke.1o As late as 1893 Henri Baudrillart still spoke of the deep division between cities, &ldquo;which have their life apart,&rdquo; and the countryside. At the same time, it is worth noting that he had reference here to the relatively backward Haute- Garonne, not to the French countryside as a whole, suggesting that changes had taken place elsewhere in the meantime, and that different regions evolved at a different pace.</p>
<p>[[41]]</p>
<p>Such time lags and the disparities that ensued from different rates of change are crucial aspects of our story. Most of it deals with regional diversities that have attracted little notice in generalizations made from an urban point of view. If Disraeli concerned himself with rich and poor, it may have been in part because regional differences were of less account in England than in France. Comparing France and England in the 1860&rsquo;s, Léonce de Lavergne found little difference between rural and urban salaries in England, between the Londoner&rsquo;s way of life and that of the Cumberland man.*2 His statistical approach may be disputed, and his impressions too. But it is certain, as he claimed, that nowhere in England could one find anything approaching the distance that separated the departments of Nord and Seine-Inférieure, say, from Lozère and Landes. Nor, indeed, could one have found the kind of tribute that the country paid to the capital, and the countryside grudgingly to cities in general. &ldquo;You have voted millions to embellish the cities,&rdquo; complained a deputy of Nord in 1861; &ldquo;you have voted fine monuments and we, we are still in the mud up to our knees.&ldquo;43</p>
<p>In July 1789, after news of the fall of the Bastille, mountain peasants of the Saint-Romain region in Mâconnais revolted and carried their spontaneous jacquerie into the plains, which remembered this always as the time of the brigands. The rebels caused great damage-pillaging and burning—until finally put down by the urban militias of Mâcon, Cluny, and Tournus. Many were hanged at the gates of Cluny or in the town square of Tournus. Tradi-</p>
<p>II</p>
<p>tion says</p>
<p>that those who escaped this summary justice were crucified by mobs on Cluny common. True or false, tradition is revealing: it gives us the venting of popular wrath on men whom some might regard as popular heroes. And the countryside between Igé and Cluny preserves the equivocal memory in Brigands&rsquo; Roads, Brigands&rsquo; Crosses, and other tributes to the well-established hostility between mountain and plain, country and town. Writing about the same period, Richard Cobb talks of the soldiers who marched out of Paris and other urban centers to enforce the economic policies of 1793 and 1794 (that is, to gather provisions), behaving just as if they were in enemy territory: &ldquo;Indeed, many of these urban soldiers said that they were in enemy territory.&rdquo; The feeling was mutual, and it persisted.**</p>
<p>Country and town, bourg and hamlet, were complementary, but still incompletely so, and hostile. For the peasant, the bourgeois, however humble, was the inhabitant of the bourg, envied and distrusted. The girls who lived on isolated farms or in tiny hamlets traditionally preferred to marry artisans; witness the many Gascon tales warning the peasant maid against marrying a &ldquo;bourgeois&rdquo; like the village baker or hairdresser, or the equally numerous songs in which a farmer or a shepherd is spurned in favor of a miller or a baker.+++(5)+++ When the song is of peasant origin it may predict the grief that awaits the girl, the beatings and the moldy bread (no different really from what could be expected on a farm), but the tone is one of rivalry and resentment. This becomes more acute when the rival belongs to a real urban community. A</p>
<p>song of Lower Dauphiné tells of a peasant lad who tangles with a Lyon silk weaver and thrashes him, then meets a maiden he likes and wants to impress with his feat:46</p>
<p>[[45]]</p>
<p>Had I but known how to tell her my tale!</p>
<p>Peasants are every bit as good as gents!</p>
<p>Of course they were not. And the advantages all urban dwellers seemed to have over them prompted thoughts of revenge. All city people were gentsbourgeois, messieurs-and their hateful superiority contributed to the ambiguity of the peasants&rsquo; reactions to them and to their influence. Emile Souvestre, who was persuaded of the hatred peasants felt for the bourgeoisie, tells of how, in the peasant siege of Pontivy in Vendée during the Hundred Days, the women who accompanied the chouans carried sacks for the loot they hoped to gain. One had two: the smaller for the money she could find, the bigger to carry off gents&rsquo; heads. Several stories of this ilk have circulated, but none has been authenticated so far. They reflect not only the fears of city people, but their accurate perception of how their country neighbors felt about them. Messieurs were many, but the feelings they provoked were the same. In Savoy in 1870, after news of the fall of the Second Empire reached the villages, peasants were reported to have cried, &ldquo;A bas les messieurs! Vive la République!&ldquo;48</p>
<p>[[47]]</p>
<p>[[12]]</p>
<p>Nor, as we have seen, did the hostility reflect a clear-cut sense of class divisions. On the contrary, the evidence suggests that peasants distrusted anything with the taint of the town. Around Limoges in the 1840&rsquo;s, young Republicans of the middle classes preached the doctrines of Pierre Leroux, Saint- Simon, Cabet, and Fourier to the local workers, and converted some of them. But neither the burghers nor the workers of the town could get through to the rural masses. Socialist militants trying to indoctrinate the peasantry in patois got a few leagues from town, as far as their legs could carry them in one day, but seem to have had little or no impact.*9</p>
<p>The troubles that shook France between 1848 and 1851 showed that neither class nor political interests could override traditional hostilities and fears. When the peasants of Ajain marched on their county town, Guéret, in 1848, the local workers&rsquo; club was torn between sympathy for the insurgents and fear of seeing them enter the town. Finally, workingmen, firemen, national guard, all &ldquo;betrayed&rdquo; the peasants and stood with their fellow townsmen. Again, after December 2, 1851, when the peasants marched on towns throughout the south of the Limousin, the townsmen stood against them. In the Drôme, at Crest, whose burghers had sucked the surrounding country dry with their usury, the peasants came down out of the mountains as poor, wild mountaineers have done through history, to pillage the bourgeois of the plains. But &ldquo;the barbarian army&rdquo; (as a leader of the municipal resistance called them) found neither help nor sympathy among the workers of Crest, by all accounts a pretty unruly lot themselves in other circumstances.50</p>
<p>We shall encounter these events again when we examine the political evolution of the countryside in detail. My point right now is that age-old hostilities had changed little, that social tensions remained in their archaic pattern, and that what has sometimes been taken as evidence of class war in the countryside was often the extension of an understandable feud between country and town. From Balzac to Zola, via Maeterlinck, the Abbé Roux, and many others, the peasant appears as a dark, mysterious, hostile, and menacing figure, and is described as such. When he is not a noble savage, as he was for George Sand, he is simply a savage.</p>
<p>Those who express regret at the passing of the level-headed, vigorous, hardworking countryman of yore have no idea what he was really like-no more, in many cases, than his contemporaries had. As Philip Gaskell observes, of the Scottish Highlander in roughly the same period: &ldquo;He lived not in picturesque, rural felicity, but in conditions of penury and squalor that can only be fairly compared with those of a famine area in contemporary India, and that were tolerable only because they were traditional and familiar.&ldquo;51</p>
<h2 id="poverty">Poverty</h2>
<p>In August 1840, when the Conseil Général of Loiret considered a series of questions submitted by the Minister of the Interior, their answer to one question was terse: &ldquo;Is poverty hereditary in a great many families? Yes.&rdquo; So rare</p>
<p>songs</p>
<p>13 was the incidence of peasant wealth that when a villager managed to grow rich his success was likely to be attributed to trafficking with the devil or to criminal activity. In 1856 one Catherine Raoux of Ally (Cantal) was caught stealing from the mill where she worked, her employers having been alerted by her &ldquo;acquisition of a pair of shoes, an umbrella, and two handkerchiefs in quick succession, and the purchase of these items in cash.&ldquo;52 Proverbs and reflect the situation: &ldquo;When one has nothing, one has nothing to lose,&rdquo; says the Limousin; and &ldquo;A patched coat lasts longer than a new one.&rdquo; The tale of Hansel and Gretel, abandoned in the woods by parents too poor to feed them, is told in Auvergne about little Jean and Jeannette. The best known bourrée of Auvergne and one of the gayest has a swain wondering how to get married on practically nothing. He has five sous, his love has four, they will buy one spoon, they will buy one bowl, and eat their soup together.+++(5)+++</p>
<p>Further west, omnipresent misery struts through peasant shanties as it does through the peasants&rsquo; lives, robbing them of everything, in due course of their lives.&rdquo;</p>
<p>One evidence of poverty, often cited by contemporaries, was the sale of women&rsquo;s hair. This was particularly widespread in the center and the west, where the hair of countrywomen was periodically harvested to be exchanged in the market for a length of cloth, a couple of kerchiefs, or simply a few centimes. +++(5)+++ The midsummer fair at Limoges was especially dedicated to this trade, attracting buyers from as far as Paris; so did another important center, Treignac, in Corrèze. The practice waned as prosperity spread after the 1880&rsquo;s, and as Chinese competition drove the market down, a development that saw the value of a kilogram of hair drop from 100 francs in the early 1880&rsquo;s to only 50 in 1902.54 By 1888 a Corrézien could rejoice that more and more peasant women refused to sell their hair, and that only &ldquo;shepherdesses and poor servants&rdquo; still traded it for a few yards of calico. But the practice declined slowly, and it persisted in most of the Limousin and Brittany, the poorest and most backward of French regions, until at least 1914.&rdquo;</p>
<p>[[55]]</p>

<p>Extreme poverty could and did persist, of course, even in areas that were not poor: the Allier valley, Lauragais, Beauce, Berry. As an army officer remarked in 1850, after traveling from Clermont to Billom along the Allier valley: &ldquo;The country itself is rich, the farmers are miserable.&rdquo; The situation was entirely normal, as the passing reflection of an Ariège tax collector on the life of a poor farmer attests: &ldquo;His occupation allows him to live miserably, like all the working class.&ldquo;56 What did this mean? Many lacked a table, a cupboard, even a chair, bedded down on straw or fern, had practically no clothes. From Yonne this police report on a search of a shoemaker&rsquo;s household: &ldquo;No bed, no linen, no shirts, just nothing, absolutely nothing!&rdquo; +++(5)+++ From the stony mountains of Puy, an equally dismal report by a local squire describing the huts, or rather the lairs, where men and beasts huddled together around a feeble fire built of peat and smoking heavily. Only the grandsire had a chair; the father squatted on a stone, the children on the peat blocks that would14</p>
<p>provide the next day&rsquo;s fuel. All slept on dried leaves.57</p>
<h3 id="shepherds">Shepherds</h3>
<p>Shepherds and other landless peasants lived even harder. The gendarmes of Lahorre described the cabin of a Pyrenean shepherd (1888): about one meter high, dry stones, earth roof, a little straw to lie on; a small heap of potatoes; a sack containing half a loaf, fat, and salt. The man carried his wealth on him: a box with three or four matches and nothing else. As a bourrée of the Foix country had it:</p>
<p>Shepherds&rsquo; life,</p>
<p>Life of rich fare:</p>
<p>Skimmed milk in the morning, Curdled milk at night.</p>
<p>Most shepherds were able to keep body and soul together, but how they managed to exist, they and the many other landless denizens of the countryside, remains an enigma.</p>
<p>[[58]]</p>
<h3 id="labor">Labor</h3>
<p>Of course they worked-when they could-and those who worked, worked very hard indeed. It has been suggested that new methods of farming, notably the shift from the biannual to the triannual rotation of crops, created a peasant without leisure. Again, we shall see that new methods of cultivation progressed at rates that varied greatly; and so did access to leisure. But I should think that peasants had enough to do even under the old system. What observers in fact noted was the result of the peasant&rsquo;s new opportunities to improve his lot at the cost of immense effort and with no certainty of success-more simply, the novelty of hope. Peasants in Upper Quercy began work at dawn, ended late at night, often went to work their own plot by moonlight after having worked another&rsquo;s land by day. &ldquo;No more rest and no more ease!&rdquo; lamented a landowner near Nantes in 1856. &ldquo;Everyone scrimps,&hellip; works without care for rest or food,&hellip;to buy a plot of land from some neighbor ruined by usury.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The more ambitious you were, the harder you worked. Benoît Malon&rsquo;s father, employed on a Forez farm, was free to work his potato patch and his kitchen garden on Sunday after church. He died at thirty-three of pleurisy, which he contracted as he hurried to get to his freshly planted potatoes. As late as 1908 in the marshlands of the Vendée a man farming four hectares with only a spade (thus able to work no more than four ares a day) left home at five in the morning, returned at seven in the evening, and never saw his children.* Hard labor without chains-to which one remained bound by necessity and from which only death could bring release.</p>
<p>[[60]]</p>
<p>[[1959]]</p>
<p>That the release was often yearned for is attested by the Alpine adage: &ldquo;heyrouss com&rsquo;un crébat&rdquo;-happy as a carcass.+++(5)+++ Malon&rsquo;s grandmother entreated the little boy to accompany her in death; his mother envied him because she believed he would die young. There is a Berry song in which a woman dreams of escape, but every hope proves false: perhaps when she is married she will</p>
<p>* René Dumont, Voyages en France d&rsquo;un agronome, p. 305. One hectare 10,000 square meters = 2.47 acres. One are 100 square meters = 119.60 square yards.</p>
<p>[[15]]</p>
<p>work in the fields no more; but marriage comes and still she works; pregnancy is no better, children are no help, so she yearns for death, and death at last sets her free. No wonder the Bourbonnais peasant holds life as nothing: &ldquo;La vie, oné rien de tout.&rdquo; A life of labor is easily dispensed with.&ldquo;1</p>
<p>So much misery. So much fear. Of menaces known and unknown; and of the known, above all wolves, mad dogs, and fires. Forests were still vast and fearsome around mid-century.</p>
<h2 id="wolves">Wolves</h2>
<p>In Mâconnais the wolves disappeared in the 1840&rsquo;s, and in Orléanais one could cross the forest without risk of attack by 1850. But elsewhere wolves ran freely in packs through forests and mountain regions until close to the end of the century. The last wolf in Châteauroux forest was killed in 1877. In Brittany they were attacking animals into the early 1880&rsquo;s, and in 1882 Maupassant recorded that in Lower Brittany sheep were put out to graze with cows to provide &ldquo;la part du loup.&rdquo; Wolves were hunted in the Morvan into the 1890&rsquo;s (as were boars, which devastated the fields) and in the Vosges, Brittany, the Charentes and Périgord. In 1883, 1,316 wolves were killed in France or, rather, official bounties were paid for that many heads; in 1890, 461 were killed, in 1900 only 115. Bounty, gun, and poison were gaining the upper hand. Forests were shrinking, roads made wolves&rsquo; lairs more accessible, and the noisy new railroads and highways frightened off the beasts.62 But the tales told over winter evenings and the persistence of the increasingly vague but still menacing image of the wolf show better than mere statistics the grip the animal had on the popular imagination. Evil-omened spots were linked with wolves, like the notorious Carroi de Marlou or Mareloup in Sancerrois, where witches&rsquo; sabbats were rumored into the twentieth century; and so were the activities of the terrifying meneurs de loups, who could set the beasts on one. For city dwellers the wolf was a storybook character, seldom closer than a tale from Jules Verne or the Comtesse de Ségur. But for people over great portions of France he was a howling in the night, a disquieting presence not far off, a hazard or even an interdiction of certain winter paths, and worst of all, a source of the dreaded rabies.</p>
<h2 id="rabid-dogs">Rabid dogs</h2>
<p>I have found little information about the incidence of rabies, but rabid dogs were not unusual and with news of one in the neighborhood fear spread very fast. An incantation to the moon used in Charente and Poitou asked first of all for protection against mad dogs-more dangerous seemingly than snakes.* Since the farm dogs were typically half-wild themselves (they would</p>
<p>But the peasant of Bourbonnais feared both, judging by his traditional prayer for protection &ldquo;against evil beasts&rdquo;: &ldquo;Saint-Hubert glorieux, de trois choses me défende: / Des chiens fous, des loups fous, / Des verpis [vipers] et des serpents.&rdquo; A medical report estimated that in Lozère 25 persons died of bites by rabid animals, mostly dogs, between 1849 and 1866. Not so many, it would seem, until we remember that some of those bitten survived after cauterization of the wound or amputation, and that others were smothered to death by their terrified families, then buried with no further inquiries on the part of local authorities. (Frantz Brunet, Dictionnaire du parler bourbonnais, p. 247; L&rsquo;Aubrac, 4: 157-58.)</p>
<p>[[16]]</p>
<p>not have been much use had they not been aggressive), mad dogs were not always easy to spot and could easily bite several persons before being identified. It is not surprising that Pasteur became such a national hero.</p>
<h2 id="fires">Fires</h2>
<p>Fires, by contrast, are well documented.* Police and judicial files offer an endless recital of fires, accidental and deliberate, attributed to envy, resentment, spite, greed, or, sometimes, lightning. Anyone and everyone might have been the culprit: an eight-year-old child working on a farm; an unbalanced or jealous spouse; a neighbor, rival, or servant; a tramp (though the matches of passing vagabonds were taken into custody when they dossed down in the barn); an owner hoping to cash in on insurance. Some contraband matches tended to burst into flames at the slightest friction. More often, no matches were to be had, and the constant fetching and carrying of embers between neighbors led easily to accidents.**</p>
<p>Fires were sometimes catastrophic. Two such conflagrations occurred in 1857 alone, one destroying 114 dwellings in the little village of Fresne-sur- Apance (Haute-Marne), and the other consuming all 17 houses in the hamlet of Fretterans in Bresse, leaving 100 persons destitute. Considering that the means of fighting fires were primitive at best and most of the time were practically useless, it is small wonder that people were easily aroused to panic. In October 1861, as the result of a series of fires around Nérac (Lot-et-Garonne), a wave of fear spread through the department and neighboring cantons of Gers, a fear so deep, thought the imperial prosecutor, as to invite comparison with the Great Fear of 1789: armed patrols, shots fired in the night, people barricading themselves in their homes, beggars and tramps arrested or run out of villages, even a &ldquo;mass levy&rdquo; on the rumor that clerical and legitimist bands were setting the fires in retaliation for the Emperor&rsquo;s papal policies. Such notions proved contagious, and one poor man set fire to a mill &ldquo;because he heard it said that it was the thing to do, and that he would be richly rewarded.” Finally, the alarm abated just as it had swelled, like other waves of panic in anxious times.</p>
<p>[[1966]]</p>
<p>The greatest fire hazard lay in the thatched roofs that covered so many structures. &ldquo;If covered with straw,&rdquo; went the Gascon saying, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t let fire come near it.&rsquo; Authorities and insurance companies waged bitter campaigns against thatch. But many factors worked against change, above all the cost of a suitable substitute until improved transportation made slate or tile more readily available. Furthermore, in the mountains and other areas the thatch nicely insulated the huts so that food could be stocked in quantity. More important, perhaps, the walls and timberwork of the peasants&rsquo; huts were too weak for heavier covering and had to be strengthened, if not totally rebuilt. This helps explain</p>
<p>*Emile Duché calls this the favorite crime of the lower orders (Le Crime d&rsquo;incendie, Paris, 1913, p. 33). And Gabriel Tarde notes: &ldquo;A la campagne, incendier la grange de son ennemi, quand on sait qu&rsquo;elle n&rsquo;est pas assurée, est le moyen de vengeance le plus souvent et le plus impunément employé&rdquo; (Essais et mélanges sociologiques, Lyon, 1895, p. 121).</p>
<p>[[17]]</p>
<p>the obstinate resistance to outside pressure where building and roofing materials were not easily come by.* And it almost certainly explains the strange thatched roof rebellion that shook the Angevin countryside in 1854, when the prefect of Maine-et-Loire, eager to eliminate the source of too many fires, decreed that all thatch had to be replaced by slate or tile. Many peasants too poor to bear the cost of a new roof, let alone the cost of rebuilding their houses in stone rather than clay and wood, resisted the order and were evicted. They marched on Angers, several thousand strong, and the army had to intervene and disperse them. The prefect was replaced, the decree rescinded, and thatched roofs allowed to disappear more gradually. The relatively prosperous farmers who carried insurance were finally forced into compliance under a concerted attack by insurance companies in the 1860&rsquo;s and after. But the final slide to oblivion came when the threshing machine began to replace the ancient flail. The straw used for roofs had to be flailed; mechanical threshers broke the straw and made it useless. Insurance rates had made thatch impractical for the prosperous; machines made it almost impossible for the poor.</p>
<p>[[67]]</p>
<p>Hunger and the fear of it were a more constant dread even than fire, the ubiquitous presence at many a hearth, the principal problem of many a province. The anxiety of providing daily bread or mush or bran for oneself and one&rsquo;s family was greater in some places, like Maurienne, than in others. But everywhere it shaped behavior, attitudes, and decisions.</p>
<p>In 1773 a royal official at Foix remarked that the poor &ldquo;keep more fasts than the Church orders.&rdquo; The nineteenth century had its share of disettes: 1812, 1817, 1837, 1853, and especially the great hunger of 1846-47. In Ariège families ate grass, hungry peasants were &ldquo;eager to get into prison,&rdquo; mendicancy was chronic, armies of beggars descended into the plains, and to the end of the century, travelers were beset by legions of children seeking alms.68</p>
<p>Songs and sayings record the wisdom of dearth: &ldquo;Year of beechnut, year of famine; year of acorns, year of naught.&rdquo; &ldquo;Bare arse goes along, empty belly goes no more.&rdquo; &ldquo;Never mind about rags so long as there is food.&rdquo; &ldquo;Full of cabbage, full of turnips, as long as one is full.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the importance of conserving precious bread: &ldquo;Hard bread makes a safe house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Warm bread could mean ruin; one ate too much of it. Stale bread encouraged frugality. As Cobb emphasizes, the problems of subsistence-that is, of a minimum substantially below subsistence-level-persisted well into the nineteenth century. Hungry peasants facing a grain shortage behaved as their forefathers had: blockading or plundering convoys of grain.</p>
<p>[[09]]</p>
<p>* Yet in Yonne thatch seems to have been abandoned quite early. See Justice of the Peace, Saint- Florentin, to Prefect, March 31, 1857, in Archives Départementales, Yonne III M1 228, inveighing against the continued use of waterholes: &ldquo;Ces mares ont eu, je le sais, leur raison d&rsquo;être; elles étaient un mal nécessaire quand toutes les maisons étaient construites en bois, couvertes en chaume et présentaient ainsi des alimens faciles aux ravages du feu. Mais, grâce au bien-être qui se répand dans les campagnes, grâce aux incendies eux-mêmes&hellip; le chaume a disparu presque partout.&rdquo; But, then, Saint-Florentin is in the plains of northeastern Yonne and not subject to the harsh conditions of the areas further south.</p>
<p>[[18]]</p>
<p>From the 1830&rsquo;s on, to the end of the Second Empire, ministers, prefects, and sub-prefects kept an anxious eye on crops; and police chiefs reported monthly and sometimes weekly on the state of crops in their area and of grain supplies in general. As the prefect of Loiret recognized in October 1856, distress and want were inevitable &ldquo;in this season.&rdquo; One could only congratulate oneself if an extreme calamity was avoided. A year when want did not stir up trouble was cause for official comment. In 1854 government measures, public works and aid in Maine-et-Loire kept the countryside calm through a hungry winter and a hungrier spring. &ldquo;For the first time&hellip;a calamitous year will have passed without sedition and almost without muttering,&rdquo; boasted the local prefect.7°</p>
<h2 id="railways-and-famine">Railways and famine</h2>
<p>Even at this late date, a rigorous winter, a barren spring, a crop failure, could still cause misery and grain riots that called for public works, subsidies, charitable initiatives, and police action. Slowly-but only very slowly- roads and railroads were getting the better of the situation. In 1847 the Orléans Company was ready to proclaim its &ldquo;glorious satisfaction that the lands along its railway have been spared [not hunger, but] the scenes of disorder that food shortages have caused elsewhere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The directors of the company rejoiced too soon, but the point would be made by others with better reason: Lavergne in 1855, glad that new rail links could stave off a disette even when the price of wheat was high; J. A. Barral in 1884, relieved that with the railway the Limousin was no longer exposed to frequent famines.&ldquo;1</p>
<p>Though provisioning the populace was a continuing problem to the very end of the Empire, there were fewer and fewer food riots, evidence of a growing success in solving subsistence problems.</p>
<p>In 1868, a bad year, turbulence marked the hungry months of spring and summer, when the grain from the previous harvest ran out before the new harvest had been brought in. Soaring prices, along with rumors of hoarding and speculation, set off food riots from Manche to Ardèche and Tarn. Serious disturbances broke out at Gaillac and Albi, and magistrates in Toulouse reported the tensest situation in 15 years.72 But this seems to have been the last old-fashioned food crisis.</p>
<p>Increased productivity and improved communications together banished the fear of hunger from the public to the private sphere, from the general to the particular level. Dearth, which had ruled social life for thousands of years, became an exceptional event.</p>
<p>For clear evidence of how dearth left its impress on society we can look at the most intimate of indexes: between 1836 and 1860 we see a statistically significant correlation between the price of grain and the marriage rate (-0.61); between 1876 and 1900 the correlation disappears (-0.04).73</p>
<p>Something else, though hard to define, began to disappear about that time: the habitual peasant resignation. The militant Louise Michel remembered what an old woman in her native village had said, recalling a year when profiteers threw the region into famine: &ldquo;Of course the poor people have to resign themselves to the things they can&rsquo;t prevent!&ldquo;74 Endure what you can-</p>
<p>[[19]]</p>
<p>not help, submit to what is inevitable. &ldquo;Quequ’vous voulez, faut ben durer,&rdquo; says the peasant of Bourbonnais; and durer means both to endure and to keep going. The peasant knows that he who bears, lasts. There is nothing to be done about a dry summer or a hard winter, about a sudden storm, about injustice or fate except wait, bend, and perhaps pray. The poor will always be poor, and always oppressed and exploited, teaches the wisdom of ages. All they can do is remember and act accordingly. &ldquo;The scraggier the beast, the more the flies will sting it.&rdquo; &ldquo;Poor people&rsquo;s bread always burns in the oven.” “A swineherd in this world, a swineherd in the next.&rdquo; &ldquo;Hard times for the poor are as inevitable as ease for the rich.&rdquo; &ldquo;The poor man&rsquo;s cock sings winter is long; the miller&rsquo;s cock answers it will soon be over.&rdquo; Accept your condition and endure: &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t try to fart higher than your arse.&rdquo; &ldquo;Dragged arse creeps along, high arse perishes.&rdquo; Do not expect help: &ldquo;There is more pity shown to a clod than to an orphan.&rdquo; And watch out, for pride, no matter how little, goes before a fall: &ldquo;Who has no trouble must expect it.&rdquo; &ldquo;Swim well, drown well.&rdquo; &ldquo;One never knows what death one will die.&rdquo; &ldquo;You think the eggs are on the fire when only shells are left.&rdquo; &ldquo;When you&rsquo;ve got a good soup made, the devil comes and shits in it.&rdquo; Never say &ldquo;fountain I&rsquo;ll not drink your water.&rdquo; You may have to do so, even if you have pissed in it.75 A stoic pessimism.</p>
<p>One accepted what had always been, tried to learn from experience, adjusted to circumstances instead of trying to change them. The assumption of an eternal order with limited alternatives-the ordre éternel des champs? Or just narrow horizons, ignorance, inertia? Something of both, I think, and rooted in perceptions that altered only as the century grew old.</p>
<p>The Limousin farmer worked all year but, however hard he tried, he could not feed his tribe.<br>
That is the way it had always been. Yet, in his hovel, the crofter +++(=farm renter)+++ thought himself well enough off &ldquo;because he has known nothing better.&rdquo; That was in 1817.</p>
<p>1907 an old farmhand recalled for Jules Renard his life in earlier days: he had never slept in a bed before he married, had tasted no wine, and had first eaten meat only because a horse had died (which the employees feasted on for 15 straight days, eating it to the last hoof). &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you dare ask for better?&rdquo; &ldquo;We never thought of it.&quot;+++(5)+++</p>
<p>By 1907 the peasants had learned better. They had learned to ask. And as the century turned, some found reason to rue the passing of resignation: &ldquo;No one is resigned these days; the utopia of the right to happiness has replaced the utopia of the right to work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In</p>
<p>The right to work was utopia indeed. The need to work was not. In the northern hemisphere, at any rate, man seemed as naturally born to work as the bird was to fly. The word travail seems to have shed its original sense of torture and pain in the sixteenth century, taking on the meaning of two older words that referred to work, labourer and oeuvrer, though it retained shreds of its origins to the eighteenth century (suggesting fatigue, anxiety, or pain, as in the old-fashioned English travail). For the privileged few, the word also embodied the idea that manual labor was demeaning; the ascetics of Port</p>
<p>[[20]]</p>
<p>Royal, for example, could find no better way to mortify themselves than to work in the fields or carve clogs. But in the countryside, where work appeared to be a necessary part of life and where most knew no other way to keep body and soul together, work became a virtue, perhaps the greatest virtue to be found in man or wife.</p>
<p>Good and bad work could be described by a broad vocabulary with many nuances. The good worker was noble, hardy, brave, courageous, valiant. Comparisons for bad work were significantly drawn from nonrural professions or from despised strangers. One who bungled his work was a cobbler; one who puttered around was a horse-dealer; one who promised to do something and then did not do it was an apothecary. All this varied with local fancy and experience: the apothecary was more often an extortioner than a liar; the horse trader was more often a chiseler than a pottering bricoleur. But in Franche- Comté, for instance, the chiseler was an argonnier, a peddler from the Argonne, a bit of a crook like most peddlers. My purpose here is not to discuss nicknames, but to point to the scorn that was attached to bad work. Perhaps the most striking example of the association of the two can be found in the evolution of the word fainéant, which from its original sense of idle or lazy grew increasingly pejorative and insulting, to the point where, in 1906, we find a trade union leader ludicrously calling on striking workers to go after the scabs with the cry &ldquo;Go beat up the idlers who are working!&rdquo;&rdquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Of course, men worked because they had to. &ldquo;Man works and scrimps,&rdquo; reasoned the prefect of Haute-Vienne in 1858, &ldquo;produces and saves, only under the pressure of present need or the fear of need to come. Were the inferior classes to be delivered by charity from this vigorous stimulant and cushioned from this salutary threat,&hellip; it would simply end the great motivation for work.&rdquo; There was virtue in &ldquo;mediocrity,&rdquo; in poverty, in need, because they forced men to work, to obey &ldquo;the divine law of labor,&rdquo; to keep busy and, hence, to keep out of trouble.78</p>
<p>Clearly the prefect of Haute-Vienne could envisage no means of relief from present need or need to come other than drudgery or charity. In 1858 necessity still ruled life, and its hold would relax very slowly. As it relaxed, we hear more references to work as an obligation, a duty to society and to God. Mandatory labor requires increasing justification and defense as it becomes less truly mandatory. Or, rather, as need becomes less ponderous and the obligation to work less stringent. Once it was clear which way the wind was blowing, there was a veritable chorus of comment from outside observers (prefects and other officials, authors of statistics and reports, teachers, priests, and travelers), all in praise of sobriety and the simple life, and deprecating what was most often described as luxury, which is to say, the tendency to live above one&rsquo;s station, trying to eat, dress, act, and even relax as the upper classes did. The earliest references to this regrettable trend were aimed not at the peasants but at the urban workers, too quick to &ldquo;adopt the ways of the idle class.&rdquo;</p>
<p>[[21]]</p>
<p>Though untypically early, 1848 may serve as a symbolic landmark of the rot spreading in the countryside. We find a Limousin priest chiding his flock for frittering their time away at pubs and fairs and wearing clothes &ldquo;not of your condition.&rdquo; Four years later, a landowner of Bourbonnais echoed the criticism: &ldquo;Too much leisure, too many holidays despite the opposition of the Church, too much going to fairs to satisfy idle curiosity, above all perhaps too little abstemiousness-the more the peasant grows, the more he consumes.'</p>
<p>1979 What good was greater productivity if its results served mainly to bring the peasant up from the low-water mark of traditional shortage to a subsistence level? A middle class growing rich on the expansion of the market exalted virtues external to the market and to an industrial economy. Like dogs in an anachronistic manger, they wanted to see the poor as producers for the market (low prices), not as consumers (higher prices). Thus consumption (extravagance) was deprecated, and the traditional values of sobriety, economy, and industry were extolled.</p>
<p>Few critics were as clear or as explicit as this about the reasons for the disapproval. But the trickle of criticism became a regular flow after the late 1860&rsquo;s, when conditions perceptibly improved. Most of it reflected simple outrage at the lower classes&rsquo; unheard-of behavior. Too many women dressed like their betters, too many working men indulged in luxury and intemperance-turned to pipes, cards, kerchiefs or cravats, often even books (preferably something ribald or the Petit Albert), expected to wear hats, boots, and broadcloth suits, grew accustomed to high living, dressed their wives and children in finery, and drank more than was good for them.80 As the earliest and most visible evidence of improvement, dress drew the most criticism. The numerous teachers&rsquo; monographs on village life in 1889 refer to the growing extravagance and suggestiveness of girls&rsquo; attire and sometimes hint at some deeper motivation. Clothes, suggested a teacher in the Meurthe, were used as a status symbol, designed to demonstrate an equality of rank that did not in fact exist. But the often-noted &ldquo;unbridled longing&rdquo; for material possessions was really no more than the simple perception of new possibilities, the satisfaction of newly discovered wants. &ldquo;What used to be superfluous has become indispensable; we suffer deprivations of things our ancestors never heard of.&rdquo; Was this development entirely bad? Even some teachers who condemned it in one breath could see the</p>
<p>progress that it reflected. A teacher in the Vosges, after expressing the ritual regrets over the growing luxury, expenditure of money, and drinking, admitted these were coupled with comforts that none could have imagined a few short years before: &ldquo;Our grandfathers would find it difficult to recognize their village, and wouldn&rsquo;t believe our natty youth to be of the same race as themselves.&ldquo;81</p>
<p>By the 1890&rsquo;s Baudrillart had to marvel at the luxury and rising standard of living of the lower classes of rural Provence, who were fed, lodged, and dressed pretty much as bourgeois and property owners used to be.82 This last gives</p>
<p>[[22]]</p>
<p>us a clue, for by this time the standards of mid-century had so changed that what had once constituted a comfortable living was now felt to be a relatively spare and spartan existence. Théron de Montaugé saw the point clearly as early as 1869: the more the general well-being improved, the higher the poverty line.</p>
<p>If poverty is defined in the most basic terms as the inability to satisfy one&rsquo;s needs, there could be little sense of deprivation so long as the perceived needs. were sharply limited and the aspiration for something more abnormal. &ldquo;The absence of an unknown good,&rdquo; Calemard de Lafayette told the agricultural society of Puy in 1854, &ldquo;cannot constitute a need, or, consequently, become a deprivation.&rdquo; Or as Théron de Montaugé put it in 1869: &ldquo;Poverty is measured by comparisons. One cannot feel deprived of possessions and pleasures one is unaware of.&ldquo;83</p>
<p>This is what urbanization—or more precisely, the spread of urban values through the countryside-was going to change. New expectations, and new frustrations when they were not met; desires that became needs; the fading of the ages-old resignation and passivity. How these changes came to pass, and how slowly they passed-that is what this book is all about.</p>
