The colonist only ends his work of breaking in the native when. the latter admits loud and clear the supremacy of the white man's values. 

-FRANTZ FANON 

THE FAMOUS hexagon can itself be seen as a colonial empire shaped over the centuries: a complex of territories conquered, annexed, and integrated in a political and administrative whole, many of them with strongly developed national or regional personalities, some of them with traditions that were specifically unor anti-French. A partial roll call serves as a reminder: in the thirteenth century, Languedoc and parts of the center; in the fifteenth, Aquitaine and Provence; in the sixteenth, Brittany; in the seventeenth, Navarre, Béarn, Pays Basque, Roussillon and Cerdagne, parts of Alsace and French Flanders, Franche-Comté; in the eighteenth, the Duchy of Lorraine, Corsica, the papal Comtat-Venaissin; in the nineteenth, Savoy and Nice.1 By 1870 this had produced a political entity called France-kingdom or empire or republic—an entity formed by conquest and by political or administrative decisions formulated in (or near) Paris. The modern view of the nation as a body of people united according to their own will and having certain attributes in common (not least history) was at best dubiously applicable to the France of 1870. 

Just after the First World War, Marcel Mauss pondered the difference between peoples or empires and nations. A people or an empire he saw as loosely integrated and governed by an extrinsic central power. A nation, by contrast, was "a materially and morally integrated society" characterized by the "relative moral, mental, and cultural unity of its inhabitants, who consciously support the state and its laws." It is clear that France around 1870 did not conform to Mauss's model of a nation. It was neither morally nor materially integrated; what unity it had was less cultural than administrative. Many of its inhabitants, moreover, were indifferent to the state and its laws, and many others rejected them altogether. "A country," says Karl Deutsch, "is as large as the interdependence it perceives." By that standard the hexagon shrivels away.

The question here is not political: political conflict about the nature of the state and who shall rule it reflects a higher degree of integration than our outlying populations had attained. The question turns rather on "the wide complementarity of social communication" that for Deutsch makes a people one. Outside the urban centers, over much of France there was no "common history to be experienced as common," no "community of complementary habits," little interdependency furthered by the division of labor in the production of goods and services, and only limited "channels of social communication and economic intercourse." If by "society" we mean a group of people who have learned to work together, French society was limited indeed.3 

Despite evidence to the contrary, inhabitants of the hexagon in 1870 generally knew themselves to be French subjects, but to many this status was no more than an abstraction. The people of whole regions felt little identity with the state or with people of other regions. Before this changed, before the inhabitants of France could come to feel a significant community, they had to share significant experiences with each other. Roads, railroads, schools, markets, military service, and the circulation of money, goods, and printed matter provided those experiences, swept away old commitments, instilled a national view of things in regional minds, and confirmed the power of that view by offering advancement to those who adopted it.\* The national ideology was still diffuse and amorphous around the middle of the nineteenth century. French culture became truly national only in the last years of the century. 

We are talking about the process of acculturation: the civilization of the French by urban France, the disintegration of local cultures by modernity and their absorption into the dominant civilization of Paris and the schools. Left largely to their own devices until their promotion to citizenship, the unassimilated rural masses had to be integrated into the dominant culture as they had been integrated into an administrative entity. What happened was akin to colonization, and may be easier to understand if one bears that in mind. 

"Conquest is a necessary stage on the road to nationalism," wrote a student of the subject in 1901. A nation cannot or should not conquer "major peoples," but "to bring into a larger unity groups without a clear cultural identity, to draw in, to enrich, to enlighten the uninstructed tribal mind, this is the civilizing mission we cannot renounce."\* Many of the themes of national integration, and of colonialism too, are to be found in this brief statement: conquered peoples are not peoples, have no culture of their own; they can only benefit from the enrichment and enlightenment the civilizer brings. We must ask now whether this colonial image can be applied to France. 

\* Compare Karl Deutsch, Nationalism and Social Communication, p. 92: "Group assimilation can only be further accelerated by reducing or destroying the competing information recalled from the unassimilated past, and by reducing or repressing the unassimilated responses to which it would give rise in the present.... However, assimilation can be accelerated very greatly by increasing the rate of new experiences from society."

The simplest answer comes from French sources. In Franche-Comté in the twentieth century, it was remembered that people had for many years had themselves buried facedown as a protest against that region's annexation by France. The fact need not be true; the memory and the claim are significant. Current references to French conquest are found mainly in the south and in the west, where they are confused by present-day political issues. Yet, ambiguous as they are, the hearing they find suggests the reality behind them. The strain must have been intense when the forces of order-army, gendarmes, judges (except justices of the peace), and police-came from outside, and when the normal friction between police and natives was rendered more acute by linguistic differences. Order imposed by men of different code and speech, somebody else's order, is not easily distinguished from foreign conquest. In the southwest, wrote M. F. Pariset in 1867, union with France "was suffered, not accepted. The fusion was accomplished slowly and against the will." Forty years later, when Ernest Ferroul, the Socialist mayor of Narbonne, charged that the barons of the north were invading the Midi as in the olden days of the Albigeois, Le Figaro warned its readers: "Make no mistake, this is a country to be reconquered, as in the days of Simon de Montfort." Education --by politics as by schools-was inculcating a new allusiveness. Together with such symbolic literary figures as Tartarin and, later, Bécassine, historical allusions like these reinforced a view of the provincial population as childlike, backward, garrulous, unenterprising natives of underdeveloped lands.

Throughout the century the overseas colonies provided comparisons for certain parts of France. In 1843 Adolphe Blanqui compared the people of France's Alpine provinces to those of Kabylia and the Marquesas, and the comparison was several times repeated in official reports and in print: 1853, 1857, 1865. The natives and the customs of rural France, their superstitions and their oddities, were studied and described only too often with uncomprehending condescension. Their ways seemed shallow and devoid of reason, their reasonings were ignored. Native communities were despoiled of their rights (forest code, pasture, commons, fishing and hunting rights) in the name of progress, of freedom, of productivity, and of a common good that made no sense to those in whose name it was proclaimed. Because the forces of order ignored and scorned the logic of the societies they adininistered, "because this ignorance and contempt were the very essence of their action, the men responsible for this policy could not estimate its disastrous consequences." These words of Pierre Bourdieu and Abdelmalek Sayad, writing about colonial administration, apply quite well to rural France through the nineteenth century.10 

In the forests of the Pyrenees, and notably in Ariège, people took up arms against police and administrators who were "newcomers to the region and ignorant of our rights, our needs, and the local situation," alleging that they 

[[488]]

CHANGE AND ASSIMILATION 

[[399]]

were "crushing the local people" with their corrupt exactions. Native rebellions kept flaring up; as late as 1900 "all the mountain resounded to the din of horns and savage calls."11 In Corsica, an utterly foreign land whose inhabitants did not aspire to independence but prized their autonomy in matters close to home, "the locals would have nothing to do with 'continentals.' By the First World War the island was no better assimilated to France than Gévaudan had been a century before. A despairing report of November 1917 tells us that bandits, deserters, and defaulting recruits were more numerous than gendarmes-"the only people one can count on, more or less."12 

If Corsica provides too easy an argument, take the Landes, which in 1826 was called "our African Sahara: a desert where the Gallic cock could only sharpen his spurs." A Restoration writer described the Landes as "a trackless desert where one needs a compass to find one's way," inhabited by a "people alien to civilization." A writer of the 1830's compared the region to the wastes of Kamchatka and Libya, and even Michelet wrote about the idiots of the Landes. Travelers, army officers, and officials all used the same language: vastes solitudes, immenses solitudes. The natives, if mentioned at all, were a subject of pity. Settlements were colonies, isolated and sparse. The "empty wastes" were waiting to be "claimed for civilization," i.e. developed for economic exploitation.13 

And developed they were by engineers like François-Hilaire Chambrelent, who undertook drainage and planting of pines at his own expense in 1849-55 before the law of 1857 forced communes to follow his example. Since parishes were poor, the law permitted them to raise funds for the improvements they had to make by selling off portions of their commons: a perfect instance of a colonial law that forced the natives either to use their lands productively or to cede them to those who would. The results proved advantageous not just to outside capitalists but to the Landais, who had long suffered grievously from pellagra and debilitating fevers in this poorest corner of France. 

The developers' intentions were good, even if they were also profitable to some of those who formulated them. Profit in any case was part of good intentions, as was the good conscience of men who-in the way of menignored values other than their own. Balzac had deplored the waste of land in unprofitable commons. "Many of these lands could produce immensely, enough to feed whole villages. But they belong to mulish communities that refuse to sell them to speculators, preferring to keep them as pasture for a few score cows. "14 That those few score cows (in the Landes, sheep) were the very essence of a functioning economy and an established way of life made no difference to Balzac or the speculators. History, as usual, was written by the victors. 

Ardouin-Dumazet, visiting the Landes at the turn of the century, claimed that the new generations appreciated the change: better nutrition, better 

Cultures and Civilization 

[[489]]

health, longer life expectancy. But he admitted that the old remained hostile to the developers. Nor did the colonial references cease with the improvement of the region's economy. As late as 1910 or 1911 Jean Ricard could describe the settlements of resin-tappers established by turpentine companies north of Arcachon as resembling "in some African land, a gathering of huts grouped in the shadow of the Republic's flag." And yet, surprisingly, "we are in France."15 

To be in France meant to be ruled by French officials. In Savoy, where friction between the French administration and the natives was intense, it was said that French officials "arrived there as for a tour of duty in the colonies." In 1864 a writer in the Revue des deux mondes compared Savoy to Ireland.1 People in other regions made even more explicit comparisons. "They are sending colonists to faraway lands to cultivate the desert," complained a Breton, "and the desert is here!" "They are building railway lines in Africa," wrote the Revue du Limousin in 1862. "If only they would treat us like Arabs!" An agricultural review took up the cry: "There is in the heart of France a region to be colonized that asks only to be accorded the same working conditions... as the colonies."17 

Equally explicit references were made to the development of Sologne. "Here it is clearly a question of colonization," wrote Ardouin-Dumazet in 1890; Sologne's developers were as enthusiastic about their work as Algeria's. A little later, at Salbris (Loir-et-Cher): "There is an interesting parallel between the present colonization of Tunisia and the development work going on in Sologne. In Tunisia, as in Sologne, the capitalists have played an important part." Still, "everything considered... the colonization of Sologne is the more marvelous.”18 

The greatest colonial opportunities, of course, were offered by Brittany. After its forced union with France in the sixteenth century, Brittany's towns were invaded by Frenchmen who overbore or replaced the native merchants and Frenchified the people they employed or otherwise influenced. Royal ports like Lorient and Brest were garrison towns in foreign territory, and the term colony was frequently employed to describe them.19 

As we have seen, things in Brittany had changed only slightly by the 1880's. In 1891 France's inspector general of education, Carré, published an article in the Revue pédagogique "on teaching the first elements of French to the natives of our colonies and the countries subject to our protectorate." The article advocated the méthode maternelle-no more translation, but direct learning of French as in the Berlitz schools today. More interesting, it was a recasting of an article published three years earlier in the same journal “on teaching the first elements of French in the schools of Lower Brittany." The method was reasonable; the problems were identical. Another educator, in a speech delivered at Algiers in 1891, praised Carré's method for being "as 

[[490]]

CHANGE AND ASSIMILATION 

applicable to little Flemings, little Basques, little Bretons, as to little Arabs and little Berbers." By 1894 Carré's method was being used in primary schools in Lower Brittany, Flanders, Corsica, and the Basque country. Attacked that year as unsuitable for teaching French to natives of Algeria and Tunisia, it was defended by one of Carré's students, Abel Poitrineau, then inspector at Rennes, on the basis of his experience in Brittany.20 The debate was logical, the logic inescapable. 

"21 

But the similarity between Brittany and French colonies overseas went deeper still. Between 1840 and 1938, 600,000 hectares-one-fifth of the peninsula's territory-was converted from waste to plowland. In a 1946 study Jean Chombart de Lauwe described this effort as "a true colonizing enterprise," and a glance at one of its heroes, Jules Rieffel, bears him out. Born in Alsace in 1806, Rieffel went to Lorraine to study agriculture under the great agronomist Mathieu de Dombasle. Graduated in 1828, he decided to seek an agronomist's fortune in Egypt; but before taking off he visited his master's family in Brittany. During his visit there, Rieffel met a Nantes shipowner named Haentjens who had just bought a domain called Grandjouan. Rieffel was persuaded to shift his sights, and under his direction Grandjouan became first a model farm, then a distinguished agricultural school. 

In short, two central performers in the agricultural development of Brittany were an ambitious Alsatian for whom a Breton domain appeared an acceptable alternative to Egypt, and a Flemish shipmaster turned estate owner who provided capital of urban and international origin. What could be more typical of a colonizing enterprise? Chombart de Lauwe put it in a nutshell: "The clearing of the moors was made possible by an abundance of labor, the availability of capital, the initiative of a team of agronomists, and the discovery of new techniques."\* All but the first were foreign. 

In a book of 1914 Camille Le Mercier d'Erm compared Brittany to such other oppressed and vanquished nations as Ireland, Bohemia, Finland, and Poland. Le Mercier d'Erm and his friends represented mostly themselves; far more Bretons would have preferred full membership in the French commonwealth.22 But each aspiration in its own way reflects a sense of incomplete integration, and that is what concerns us here. 

Let us now try another tack and see how well Frantz Fanon's The Wretched 

\* Jean Chombart de Lauwe, Bretagne et pays de la Garonne, pp. 27, 131. Bretons also provided a good deal of the cheap immigrant labor much as the immigrants from less-developed countries do today. See notably Abbé Elie Gautier, Emigration Bretonne, and the advertisement he quotes, p. 99, which was printed in the Progrès de Briey and reprinted in La Paroisse bretonne (Paris, Sept. 1909): "Je préviens MM les cultivateurs que courant janvier j'irais chercher quelques wagons de domestiques en Bretagne.... Ils seront débarqués tous sur la place de la gare à Longuyon, où chacun pourra choisir le sujet qui lui plaira le mieux." This is not to say that Bretons were alone in this regard. Quite the contrary! See André Armengaud, Les Populations de l'est- Aquitain, p. 252. Cheap native labor was traditionally despised. See also Martin Nadaud, Mé- moires de Léonard, especially p. 54, concerning the insults Creuse masons had to endure during their migrations and on the chantiers where they worked.

of the Earth-one of the great denunciations of colonialism-applies to the conditions we have described. The following passages, some of them conflated rather than uninterrupted quotations, are representative: 

Underdeveloped regions, absence of infrastructure, a world without doctors, without engineers, without administrators. 

Cultural alienation, as colonialism tries to force the natives to give up their unenlightened ways, [to believe that] it was colonialism that came to lighten their darkness.\* 

Colonial domination disrupts the cultural life of a conquered people (death of the aboriginal society, cultural lethargy). New legal relations are introduced by the occupying power. Intellectuals seek to acquire the occupying power's culture. The customs of the colonized people, their traditions, their myths—above all, their myths are the very sign of [their] poverty of spirit and of their constitutional depravity. 

Colonialism turns to the past of the oppressed people, and distorts, disfigures, and destroys it, devaluing precolonial history. It is the colonist who makes history: "This land, it is we who made it."t 

The more brutal aspects of the occupying power's presence may perfectly well disappear, [bartered for] a less blatant but more complete enslavement. 

The native bourgeoisie, which has wholeheartedly adopted the ways of thinking characteristic of the occupying country, becomes a spokesman for the colonial culture, as does the intellectual, who soaks it up greedily.28 

The violence so prominent in Fanon's pages was rare in nineteenth-century France, perhaps because risings capable of seriously threatening the state were a thing of the past. Given time and skins of the same color, assimilation worked. But otherwise Fanon's account of the colonial experience is an apt description of what happened in the Landes and Corrèze. In France as in Algeria, the destruction of what Fanon called national culture, and what I would call local or regional culture, was systematically pursued. Insofar as it persisted, it was plagued by inertia and growing isolation. "There is a shriveling around an ever more shrunken core, ever more inert, ever more hollow." After a while, says Fanon, native creativity ebbs and what is left is 

\* Friedrich Engels, for whom the French conquest of Algeria was "fortunate... for the progress of civilization," would agree with this view: "After all, the modern bourgeois, with civilization, industry, order, and at least relative enlightenment following him, is preferable to the feudal lord or to the marauding robber" (quoted in Shlomo Avineri, ed., Karl Marx on Colonialism, New York, 1968, p. 43). 

+ "Hell is being deprived of history," Morvan Lebesque would write (Comment peut-on être Breton?, p. 43). See also Frantz Fanon, Les Damnés, p. 40: monde sur de lui ("a world of statues: the statue of the general who carried out the conquest, the statue of the engineer who built the bridge; a world that is sure of itself"). And note the battles waged around statues under the Third Republic: in 1903 Combes dedicated the statue of Renan opposite Tréguier cathedral; in 1932 the monument at Rennes celebrating Brittany's incorporation into France was bombed on the fourth centennial of that occasion.

"rigid, sedimentary, petrified.""\* Local reality and local culture wane together. So it was in nineteenth-century France. 

And yet... Taken as generalizations such accounts as Fanon's seem to me to underrate the choice and the autonomy of the colonized. Neither Bourdieu and Sayad, nor Fanon, nor our own observations suggest that the traditional societies were inert to start with. It seems to follow that they gave way to force, were vanquished by superior powers and "colonized" against their will. Is this what really happened? Not in France. 

There, as we have seen, traditional culture was itself a mass of assimilations, the traditional way of life a series of adjustments to physical circumstance. Change is always awkward, but the changes modernity brought were often emancipations, and were frequently recognized as such. Old ways died unlamented. New goods created new needs; but even deprivation was measured at a higher level. And the old remembered. New ways that had once seemed objectionable were now deliberately pursued and assimilated-not by a fawning "bourgeoisie" or self-indulgent "intellectuals," as in Fanon's account, but by people of all sorts who had been exposed to such ways and acquired a taste for them. Perhaps this should make us think twice about "colonialism" in underdeveloped countries, which also reflects regional inequalities in development. It certainly qualifies the meaning of colonization as an internal process. 

Development is not an equivocal term. It means only one thing: greater production of material goods and greater accessibility of material advantages to all. And that is what development brings, whatever disillusions may follow in its wake. The notion of underdevelopment has been criticized because it takes as its norm for underdeveloped societies the economy and culture of quite different societies.25 Yet few underdeveloped societies live so isolated from developed societies as to be ignorant of their advantages. By the nine teenth century the broadening scope of social and economic relations could well allow development and underdevelopment to be perceived objectively as rungs on the same ladder. 

Thus, when we describe a given society as underdeveloped, we say not what the society is but what it is not. We describe what it is lacking: means of production, levels of productivity, forms of culture, life-styles, attitudes. In the present study, we have examined what may be called underdevelopment in nineteenth-century France. We have seen that the positive aspects and institutions of the underdeveloped regions were ways of coming to terms with want and insecurity. Custom and inertia made for their survival, opportunity for their abandonment. Perhaps the currently accepted views of colonialism need some qualification in this light; perhaps the unfashionable fin-de-siècle views of "progress" deserve another look. Or is the colonization of underdeveloped regions acceptable internally but unacceptable beyond the colonizer's homeland? What is a homeland? Something that time, accident, and opportunity

have allowed to be hammered into shape and be accepted as a political entity: India, China, Mexico, the United States, the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom. 

Let us now return to France and stay there. Conquest and colonization created it, as they did other realms, and the process was completed in the nineteenth century. What was the critical period? I have argued for the two score years on either side of 1900. Other arguments have been made, sometimes quite forcefully, for other periods. The more or less accepted view of the Great Revolution as a watershed cannot be ignored, bolstered as it has been by recent work on the profound changes affecting French family and sexual behavior long before 1870. Laurence Wylie and other sociologists have dwelt on the 1950's, when tractors, cars, and television sets hastened the cultural homogenization of slow-changing villages. One can make a similar case for the mid-nineteenth century, revolving around 1848 and the coming of the railways. Every such argument, including mine, is plausible; none is overwhelming. 

Nor need one be. History, says Fernand Braudel, is the sum of all possible histories. The question to ask is not whether an argument is right enough to exclude all others, but how right it is, how much it tells us that we did not know. In these pages we have seen profound changes in productivity and diet shift portions of rural France away from the verge of catastrophe, from primitive want to needs that are more familiar.26 We have seen national unity painfully forged at a later date than is generally supposed. We have seen cultural homogenization following economic integration, itself achieved after much effort and pain. We have seen that certain parts of France impressed their values and techniques (sometimes deliberately) on other parts, altering their way of life. We have seen that this process proceeded slowly and unevenly, far more so than most accounts of the nineteenth century suggest. We have seen, in short, the nation not as a given reality but as a work-in-progress, a model of something at once to be built and to be treated for political reasons as already in existence. 

My argument has not been that the early years of the Third Republic were the time of transition from the traditional to the modern world in great portions of rural France, but rather that they were one such time-as important as any other, more important than most. To make this point, I have tried to show not only that many things changed during the period, but that they changed faster or more significantly than they had done before that period or would do after it. 

I submit that this has been shown. Between 1880 and 1910 fundamental changes took place on at least three fronts. Roads and railroads brought hitherto remote and inaccessible regions into easy contact with the markets and lifeways of the modern world. Schooling taught hitherto indifferent mil-494 

CHANGE AND ASSIMILATION 

lions the language of the dominant culture, and its values as well, among them patriotism. And military service drove these lessons home. The forces of modernization affected different areas different ways at different times.\* But after the changes described in this book had taken place, variations in language and behavior were significantly less and the ascendancy of modernity was significantly greater. The regions of France were vastly more alike 1910 than they had been before Jules Ferry, before Charles Freycinet, before Jules Rieffel. 

in 

In 1836 Adolphe d'Angeville concluded the introduction of his pioneer statistical essay with the observation, anticipating Disraeli, that there were two nations in France, divided by the now familiar imaginary line running from Saint-Malo to Geneva. North of that line peasants were fewer but taller, better fed, better schooled, and housed in homes lit by more windows. Their vices tended to be those of the new society (suicide, illegitimacy), their crimes to be against property rather than persons. They were relatively easy to recruit for army service and relatively quick to pay their taxes, as befits citizens of a modern nation. In the south people were shorter, worse fed, and worse housed. They were violent in both crime and politics, hostile to taxes, and slow to accept conscription. Roads in the south were thinner on the ground. Land was less productive, and the tools and methods of working it were less developed.27 

This geographical division was in effect the division between urban and rural France-better still, between the poor, backward countryside and the areas of France, rural or not, that were to some degree permeated by the values of the modern world. As a Tulle newspaper put it in 1849, the peasants of Nord were like bourgeois, the peasants of Corrèze like beggars. That was the distinction that had to end if the real France was to be the France of political rhetoric. And we have seen it ending. In the event, more and more peasants of Corrèze became like bourgeois, too, in exactly the sense that the writer of 1849 had meant.t 

Common sense and the evidence I have seen suggest that the various regions succumbed to civilization roughly in relation to their exposure to urban-and especially Parisian-influence and to the degree of such influence, the facility, hence the scale, of migration, the proximity of railroads, and so on. Yet even here there is no watertight rule: the Limousin, closer to Paris, was opened to its influence later than Provence, which of course not only benefited from the traditional Rhône valley link and earlier railway connections, but was more urbanized. Still, why did the men of faraway Ardèche migrate to Paris in greater numbers than those of Nièvre or Orne? (See L. M. Goreux, "Les Migrations agricoles," p. 365.) Explanations can be found, of course; but they encumber any general rule with numerous exceptions. The point about generalizations is that they are only generally true, at best. 

+ The two Frances d'Angeville evoked still jostled each other as the nineteenth century ended; but their differences had been attenuated. Deficiencies in diet were less remarkable. After 1880 the children of the south grew taller. After 1900 southern conscripts began to close the gap between themselves and the tall men of the north. By then they had already caught up with the north in literacy. And though fertility among married couples (one indication of a change in mentality) tended to decline later in departments south of the line, the proportion of women getting married increased in the south almost as fast as in the north. (See Etienne Van de Walle, The Female Population of France, especially pp. 178, 184.)

[[495]]

But something even more important than that was happening, something that did not happen in 1789 or 1848 or 1950, a change that represents in retrospect the great cultural event of the time: the end of a profound division of the mind. 

From the Middle Ages to the seventeenth century, high and low cultures agreed on the fundamental interpretation of the world and of life. Literacy or illiteracy made little difference to people's understanding of the condition of man, his purpose 

and his means. Knowledge varied in degree but not in kind. In the seventeenth century things changed. Natural science and rationalism with its particular logic created a separate culture of the literate, while the illiterate clung to the old ways. The relative cultural unity of Western society was dissolved, and people henceforth lived in two different worlds of the mind. 

Coherent religious theories of life that had been accepted by most educated members of the community became survivals-superstitions-no longer compatible with the scientific principles of the time. Correspondences and analogies that made sense in one system seemed childish and futile to the other. What had been common sense was forsaken by those who pursued higher wisdom, and became the province of those who regulated their existence by the seasons and the stars. Deprived of the support of elite thought, popular belief broke into a thousand subsystems unintegrated into a comprehensive view of the world. Popular wisdom was bitsy-a collection of recipes, ceremonies, rituals—and popular religion was little more. Yet both were crucial, providing believers with things people badly need: explanations, a sense of control, reassurance, a framework for individual and social activities. From the cultivated point of view, popular culture was a morass of deprivation and ignorance. So was it from the point of view of its own most gifted spirits, those who yearned in vain for truths this culture could not teach them. Much popular magic and religion—and some rejection of both-reflected a persistent quest for just such truths. 

After about 1650, then, the culture of the elite and that of the rural masses went their separate ways. (The urban masses were quicker to assimilate rationalistic ideas, as befitted their place in the capitalist scheme of things.) When, after about 1800, the gap began to narrow, it was thanks in large part to the rural world's increasing intercourse with the urban world. But material circumstances were crucial: increasingly effective control of the environment opened the door to urban views suggested by like experience. The more sophisticated people of the city believed, and in time demonstrated to the satisfaction of more and more peasants, that the world could be explained without evoking magic or supernatural intervention. The rural convert to rationalism could throw away his ragbag of traditional contrivances, dodges in an unequal battle just to stay alive, with the heady conviction that, far from being a helpless witness of natural processes, he was himself an agent of change. 

[[496]]

CHANGE AND ASSIMILATION 

At best, most people approached change hesitantly and experienced its effects with great ambivalence. But once they had drunk of its fountain, there was no turning back. The pattern of nineteenth-century belief continued to be, as Jacob Burckhardt said, "rationalism for the few and magic for the many. "28 Yet, by the end of the century, the nature of the magic, and the authority on which it was accepted, had profoundly changed. People still took their cultural norms and assumptions from others; but popular and elite culture had come together again.
