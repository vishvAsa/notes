title = "26 FLED IS THAT MUSIC"

+++
Adieu! Adieu! thy plaintive anthem fades Past the near meadows, over the still stream, Up the hill-side; and now 'tis buried deep In the next valley-glades: 

Was it a vision, or a waking dream? Fled is that music:-Do I wake or sleep? 

-KEATS 

AT A TIME WHEN light was bad, occasions for entertainment few, public performances outside church or fair strictly limited, music-homemade-and dance played a crucial role in the peasant's life. 

Music was mostly song: the songs of shepherd or of shepherdess, of workers in fields or walkers on the road, of beggars at the door, or weavers at the loom, or women spinning; the melody to which a tale was told, ballad of a memorable event or Breton gwerz or Basque improvisation; the opening challenges in tavern-drinkers' brawls; the warp and woof of dancing. 

Sung dialogues engaged farmers or shepherds miles apart. Wives recognized their men returning home at eventide by their song. Old people remember that "as soon as we were two on the road we began to sing." During the cholera epidemic of 1833 the Breton peasants, on whom official circulars and posters were wasted, heeded a song that advised them of the precautions they should take: eat little fruit and mix vinegar with the drinking water. Beggars carried the ballads from village to hamlet to farm-and possibly the germs of cholera as well. In October 1870, when the prefect of Finistère sent out mobilization orders for the militia reserves, his circular included "a detail of some importance: let those militiamen who play the musette or biniou [bagpipes] be sure to bring their instruments. They will receive extra pay.'

A Romanian student of the doină has found numerous folksongs dealing with misery, exploitation, taxes, gendarmes, conscription, hunger, usury, oppression, and the endless suffering of peasants whose abiding bitterness could scarcely be contained:3 

They lead us like oxen, They shear us like sheep. 

This sort of song, less a patch for grief than a fan to stir and articulate social resentments, seems very rare indeed where I have looked in France. Pierre 

[[430]]

CHANGE AND ASSIMILATION 

Laroche cites an example from Lauragais, where, as in many parts, interference with hunting rights sparked more resentment than any political issue. There, a song about poaching, which was the only way most poorer men could get near other meat than from their own slaughtered pigs, remarks bitterly:\* 

What would the 

gentry do 

If they couldn't lean on the poor? 

They'd have to do some work themselves, 

They wouldn't be so stiff and fat. 

Scriveners, too, come in for their share of comment, as in the Breton song about the gars faraud (the toffed-up bumpkin), which ends wishing him a diet of bedbugs: 

J'voudrai bin qu'tous les procourus N'mangeaient que des punaises, Les pau'p'tits labouroux comm'ma N'en seraient que pus à lous aise. 

Finally, George Sand seems to have heard two fretful songs that Berrichons had apparently forgotten by 1900 or so: 

Je maudis le sergent, 

Qui prend, qui pille le paysan, Qui prend, qui pille Jamais ne rend. 

Dites-moi, donc, ma mère, Où les Français en sont? Ils sont dans la misère, Toujours comme ils étions. 

This is little enough to go on. Above all, though, when this sort of thing shows up, peasants may sing it but, as often as not, they have not created it. Real peasant songs, it seems, are not plaints of deprivation, since what we call deprivation was taken as the norm, but expressions of experience in the everyday context of life, especially the aural landscape of herding, plowing, and reaping and the amorphous noises of man and bird and beast: moans and hollers, sighings, cries and groans and titters find consummation in rhythm and melody. 

"When the plowman sings, the plow goes well." Much singing was functional. One of its common purposes was to urge oxen on under the yoke. Brioler or holer in Berry, bouarer in Vendée, arander in Poitou, kioler in Morvan, was (is?) considered a rare art when done well. Those who had the knack were prized and long remembered, and farmhands who possessed the skill were hired away rather like outstanding cooks in bourgeois households. Songs were also sometimes used to set the pace for mowing and harvesting. The men and women working sang individually, and mostly when

they interrupted work. But in the Pyrenees we hear of women who were hired at harvest time to sing the old segaïres songs. They did not work, but simply followed the line of reapers, singing to give them rhythm and heart." The harvest songs might be about a local legend, like that of Jeanne d'Oymet, seduced and left behind by a king's son; or humorous, or semireligious. They also referred to the work itself. In Lot "the nightingale sings on my spine" referred to the stiffness in the back and limbs of those who made their way bent almost double to cut with the sickle "bas e round," low and regular. But as in this instance, many work songs were actually after-work songs. A respondent to a folklore survey noted that in Corrèze threshers' songs appeared more often in books than in barns, because threshing was hard work and raised enough dust to discourage even the jolliest of workers. So the flagel was more often heard when men were drinking or winnowing grain. Hard work where you need your breath does not encourage singing." Which may be why we hear about women singing at home for fun where they had no field tasks, while not too far away where they were "slaves of the earth" they were silent. It is also why so many songs are attributed to shepherds and artisans. Breton weavers, who often worked in their clients' homes and carried their frame from farm to farm, had a whole repertory; their primitive looms produced "a strangely jerky sound," a staccato of violent clangs and clashes as the blocks drove the shuttle through the warp that was translated into a staccato song, "Tric Trac de Olu!" Blacksmiths, also known as iron-thumpers, had similarly rhythmic songs:10 

Dingdong, the fire's strong, 

Come on hammer, bong bong bong! 

But, again, a smith or farrier needs his breath, and anyway, his work often required his full attention. I am inclined to doubt the authenticity of work songs connected with such things as rowing or pile-driving, however apt their rhythm.\* It is the more routine, repetitive tasks, like hauling cable and counting the salt-cod catch, that lend themselves to singing and to creating songs. Hence the great Breton song factory, "where there's as much singing as in all the rest of Brittany," was the flax country of Trégorrois. It was the girls and women spinning out the yarn who sang as they went about their work and passed on the songs. Similarly in the Ardennes, it was the women spinning who contributed most heavily to the fund of songs, singing "interminable, tearful melodies (bought from the ballad peddler) about the life of men who await death in jail, or how a mother suddenly recognizes the child the gypsies stole." Here, as in many other cases, it is hard to tell how much was incorporated from outside and how much improvised. 

Improvisation, in any case, is an imitation: of existing forms, of models 

\* When Poncy, the Lyon mason, dedicated his book of songs to George Sand, he explained that they had never been sung on the job because workers' songs were made up after work, by the fire or over a drink. 

[[432]]

taken from familiar ballads. And the songs traditionally improvised at wedding feasts, whether by a local person with a reputation for it or by all guests contributing a verse in turn, must have clung fairly close to hackneyed, reassuring rhythms.12 Local songsmiths as such seem to have been quite rare, witness the reputation of those we occasionally hear about and the rarity of their imprint on a song. Peasants, who frequently put their names or initials on a plate or lintel, mantelpiece, cross, or stick of furniture, seem to have left scarcely a trace on a composition. One of the only two cases I have come across is this announcement by a lyricist from Bournezeau (Vendée): 

Who has composed this melody? 

It's me, good fellow Eclaircy, 

Eating fat pumpkins at Badiole's mill, 

Served by goodwife Chalais with a will.\* 

Just because so many improvisations were evanescent, it is a pleasure to revivify and to preserve the scene, and give Eclaircy and goodwife Chalais, not forgetting the pumpkin, a small niche in history. 

Little is left of this sort of thing. What we do have, thanks to nineteenthcentury folklorists, are pastorals and carols. The former should not be confused with such urban patriotic patoisant imitations as the Limoges poet Joseph Foucaud's "Song for a Shepherdess":13 

Long live French youth! 

They do everything well. Whether fighting or dancing, You've never seen their like! 

Unlike this sort of nonsense, which no self-respecting shepherdess would have thought of uttering to her sheep, the real pastourelles that people sang when guarding herds or shucking corn of an evening are miniature eclogues, and usually turned on the encounter of a gent and a shepherdess. Revealingly enough, the encounter often goes badly for the gent, who is fooled or made a fool by the cunning lass: an inversion of roles that provided fantasized revenge for frustrated yearnings, and for the scorn country wenches could plausibly expect from a city swain. Just as revealing, the dialogue form nearly always had the gent speaking French and the lass answering in local dialect, as in this example, "La Bargieira et lou monsur," in which the country girl speaks Limousin and the monsieur French:14 

\* Sylvain Trébucq, La Chanson populaire en Vendée, p. 20. This manner of signature also appears in a song that a master mason of Embrun (Hautes-Alpes) composed in support of his candidate in the elections of 1846: "Qui a composé la chanson? / C'est Derbezon, maître maçon, / Un jour, étant à l'Isère, / Plantant des pommes de terre. / Vive Allier! Vive Allier! /Sera toujours le premier!" (Isère is a quarter or neighborhood of the little town of Embrun.) Curiously, a local lawyer who supported the opposing candidate answered this with a song in patois. (Henry Thivot, Vie Publique dans les Hautes-Alpes, pp. 41-42.) 

Fled Is That Music 

Adieu, la bergère! Adusias, monsur! Que fais-tu solette Dans ce bois obscur? Fiale ma counoulha, 

Garde mous moutons. 

[[433]]

The same mixture of tongues is found in noëls. After all, one spoke French to one's superiors when one could. It was natural to use it in addressing God or saints. One also dressed for the occasion, as a Morvan noël makes clear:15 

Let's don our fancy outfits, 

For it's a festive day, To worship the new baby A-lying in the hay. 

To 

go there all bemucked, Would surely not be good. Us'll adore our master, An' muckiness is rude! 

Fancy clothes, fancy speech. 

In one noël of Lower Quercy the shepherds hastening to Bethlehem stop to pick up Jean Frances, the only man in the village who speaks French, because you cannot speak to God in patois. Otherwise, however, such songs treat the holy characters in a familiar vein. One of the shepherds in a noël from Allier inquires if Saint Joseph was not jealous when he learned about Mary's pregnancy. Another, in a Corrèze song, fears that since Mary is a virgin she must lack milk for Jesus, and so brings some along. In Gascony the angel who wakes the shepherds speaks French, and they cannot understand what he is telling them. He is asked to speak so that he can be understood, and turns to Gascon to tell them that they are fortunate to hear the news he brings. His hearers doubt it-"A happy fate is never our lot; it's not meant for poor shepherds"-but they dutifully go off to Bethlehem. When they finally reach the stable, however, Saint Joseph will not open the door because he is afraid of strangers. They ask him to glance through the dormer window at the passport the angel gave them: "You've come to the wrong address," says Saint Joseph. "I'm just a poor artisan [un praoube mestériaou], who doesn't know how to read."16 

A great many noëls were printed, but these were of urban origin, as can be seen from the tradesmen's carol reproduced by Geneviève Bollème in which doctors, goldsmiths, and printers are among those to offer gifts, and bakers are enjoined to obey police regulations and to give honest measure. Homemade noëls drew on what could be had locally, and were likely to josh neighbors, local notables, and possibly innkeepers, never allowed to forget that they had refused haven to travelers in need. A Vendée noël sends shep-434 

CHANGE AND ASSIMILATION 

herds and farmers to Bethlehem, but also weavers and sergetiers bearing gifts of canvas and worsted. Merchants proffer cabbage, turnips, onions, and chicory for the family stew-more likely fare than the delicacies of urban carols. When the gifts have been presented, the shepherd (endowed with the songsmith's name-Perrin Moréa) prays to the Infant Jesus:17 

O dainty child, for your mother's sake, Save us from misery's ache, 

From poll tax and salt tax. 

Noëls may be the place where we find the common people's claims expressed most openly, and where their hopes and aches are most clearly articulated, as in this noël of 1770, sung in a small country parish of Bourbonnais: 

We'll see the war come to an end; 

Here are the good times coming back. 

See the God born to us 

To disarm the wild beasts. 

We shall be masters in our homes, 

Nor fear anything anymore.\* 

It may simply be that more noëls survived because of their seasonal reemployment and their interest to folklorists. At any rate, though the traditional groups that went round singing them were gradually driven out of cities (as from Moulins in 1866), the noëls went on being sung in original versions at least to the end of the century.18 

Like the noëls, but more deliberately, some popular songs addressed themselves to social, economic, and, finally, political issues. When not the work of seminarians, priests, or middle-class balladeers, these were generally written by urban artisans. It was a priest who wrote the notorious "Que forâ-tu paubro Jonou?"19 

What will you do, poor Jenny? There's not a lad to be found. They're all for the army bound. 

The hunchback, the crocked, and the old 

Are all you can get if you're bold! 

It was a journeyman carpenter on a tour de France in the mid-century who wrote a popular clog song ("Les Esclops") in Cévenol patois. And it was two stocking weavers from Languedô, "de la classe de mil huit cent di," who composed another bound for fame:2

Compare this with the text of a prophecy of 1673, during the Dutch War: "Enfin la Paix succédant à la guerre / Va donner à chacun un grand contentement. / Un prince triomphant, bening [sic] et débonnaire, / De son Pays accablé finira le tourment." (Geneviève Bollème, Les Almanacs populaires, p. 82.)

We also hear about a local songster at Neuzonville (Ardennes), a twentyfour-year-old locksmith named Demoulin, who met with other smiths in a particular tavern where they sang and danced-and also (reported the gendarmerie) sang subversive songs written by Demoulin. This was 1850, and when the little gang marched through Neuzonville wearing red bonnets (the Phrygian caps of the Revolution) and singing Demoulin's songs, they clashed with the police and were brought to court.21 But Neuzonville was a large market town, and compagnons-journeymen members of trade guilds-had a tradition of making up songs, which seldom echoed out into the countryside. There, they were more likely to sing the doubtfully translatable:22 

The National Guard 

Are a lot of petticoats. 

They've marched through the mountains, And they've stolen all the groats. 

La garde nationale Sanesont que des jupons. Ont été par les montagnes. Ont volé les sousissons. 

The years after 1848 would send the tide of subversive songs into rural areas, but even in the most authentic of them, Claude Durand's "Chant des Vignerons" of 1850, the writer was influenced by Victor Hugo's verse.\* Durand, though mayor of his Deux-Sèvres village, was at least a man of the land himself. The best-known and most frequently quoted of the revolutionary covey was written by a drifting urban poetaster, Pierre Dupont:23 

Oh! quand viendra la belle, Voilà des mille et des cent ans, Que Jean Guêtré t'appelle République des paysans? 

Of course political agitation when literacy was minimal had frequent recourse to songs and to recitation. The list of agitators arrested in Gironde after December 2, 1851, included two workers who, like Demoulin in the Ardennes, had produced "bad verse": Pierre Vigier, who had been a cooper but now worked at devising political songs and verses, and Elie Boizac, a baker at Pian-sur-Garonne, who "writes bad verse and believes himself fated to exalted destinies. Hence malcontent."2 Men like these wrote in French, and their products were as true to the popular mind as a gendarme's report. Others, more sophisticated, hoped to reach the patoisant peasantry by writing in local speech. Pierre Laroche cites one song of the sort from Lauragais, "Bibo la Républico!," but its allusions to distant politics and its support 

of

Armand Barbès, relatively unknown in the southwest even after May 1848, may have made it even more impenetrable than propaganda in French.25 

Eugène Pottier, father of "L'Internationale," pretended that the Second Empire had frozen popular songs:26 

Articulated by the cold, 

Words have frozen harder than they were of old. 

No more Assemblies (even patois-bound). 

It's snowing everywhere: words without sound. 

But this referred only to the political products of urban chansonniers, and even their work was still to be found on the roads in 1854, when the police in Yonne reported they had confiscated several subversive broadsheets; and when in the Morvan "La Morvandelle" mocked the two-bit Caesar who had 

put down liberty. One reacts skeptically to the report of "a patriotic song of spontaneous and popular origin" in Yonne that welcomed the increase of the draft for the Crimea. But one can well believe that Isaac Maurin, a shoemaker in Gard who was sentenced to jail for six days, was guilty of writing a patois song "arousing hatred and scorn of citizens against each other" and setting the poor against the rich. "La Morvandelle," with its schooled prosody, could not match the native tang and raciness of ditties made up in the countryside by Republican shoemakers who sang about 

L'gros Napoléon, 

Sur sa gros ch'vaux blancs. 

Or, in 1879, after the death of the Crown Prince: 

Prisonnier à Sedan, 

Revendant à Sedan 

Revendant aux Allemands 

La France et ses enfants. 

Il faut applaudir les zoulous 

Qui viennent de poignarder Loulou. 

Elsewhere, in 1869, when the banker Isaac Pereire lost the hotly disputed election at Limoux, an old Limoux Carnival song was refurbished to run, roughly, very roughly: 

They have bunged up your behind, 

Poor Perera, poor Perera. 

They have bunged up your behind, Poor Perera, it's not kind. 

The song was still being sung in the Aude wine country after the Second World War to taunt losers in local elections.27 

Fled Is That Music 

[[437]]

The Third Republic had its own full share of spontaneous political songs. At Veslud (Aisne) in 1876, when the big landowners decided to enclose their lands with wire and thus deprive fellow villagers of common pasture, the great ensuing trial between piquets and truands evoked satirical songs. At Sauvetat, in Guyenne, the years between 1885 and 1890 were one long battle between the partisans of the priest and the mayor. The secularist clan used patois songs, written or adapted for the circumstances and sung in the village square as political ammunition. In Ariège at Gestiès political songs were made up and sung at the Carnival in 1894, and two years later, at Capoulet, the mayor was accused of putting the youth up to preparing such songs for the local feastday, August 2. In 1904, when vineyard workers struck at Beaufort in Minervois, one owner clashed with the pickets: "They make him a song in which they call him iron head.”28 Making up songs as arguments in a conflict continued to be done until after the First World War. The charivariseurs also knew well that there is no more memorable way of getting at your opponent. 

Like Eugène Pottier, Maurice Agulhon has suggested that the popular tradition in songs and other old forms was hurt by the marriage of politics and folklore, which led the government to move against them.29 What we call folklore had always reflected local politics. When local politics became national, the government began to meddle; the agents of authority turned against village songsters, farandoles, Carnivals, and the like, quite willing to lose the baby with the bathwater. 

But the marriage with politics itself affected folklore. Songs were among the first things to feel the influence of the outside world and, in most cases it seems, to welcome it. Popular music is popular not in terms of its origins, but in terms of who accepts what. We have already seen noëls and pastorals incorporating the more elegant French, if only to ridicule it. And it appears that other traditional dialect songs, like the New Year's guillouné of Gascony ("au gui l'an neuf"), were altered by sixteenthor seventeenth-century francimans-Frenchified Gascons-who had to make themselves understood by French officials in order to get a tip.30 More important than such forfeitures, though, is the fact that songs traveled. Given the relative paucity of local sources in the countryside, there was need for constant replenishment, and contributions from outside were readily accepted. Ballads and songs were eagerly learned and even bought at fairs, or from itinerant peddlers. Most of them were drawn from vaudevilles and older operas. And most of them were urban creations. But there were others, too. George Sand tells of a minstrel from around La Châtre in Berry who told her he went every year to look for new dance themes among the woodcutters of Bourbonnais because they were the greatest composers in the world.31 In 1854, at the time of the Crimean War, a workers' singing society in Nord featured a homemade song about a lad who tries to kiss a girl and receives a good beating for his pains: 

[[438]]

CHANGE AND ASSIMILATION 

Ah! te t'in souviendras, Nicolas, D'avoir bayé Thrinette! 

The refrain fitted the political situation. It became the war song that all conscripts of Nord sang when they went off to battle. Within a few years it could be found in Normandy, with patriotic lyrics:32 

Ah! tu t'en souviendras, Nicolas, Du combat de Sinope! 

Many of the ballads that the weavers and spinners sang were in French or at least came from outside the parish. This too was bound to introduce strange themes and notions. Even within Brittany, the tailors and sabotiers, itinerant beggars and rag-and-bone men who carried the songs out of Trégorrois must have carried them to regions where the speech was different and perhaps the rhythms, too. No wonder French could appear as a lingua franca. 

Finally, though most rural music was song, the best (that is, the most expensive) music was instrumental. Instrumental societies, modeled on the bands that accompanied Army units until the organization of regimental bands in 1860, were founded as early as the eighteenth century to play wind, wood, and brass. By mid-century every small town that could had its own band for special occasions; but such displays remained, in the words of the subprefect of Céret in 1894, "a rare diversion in the rural communes." Instruments were expensive; learning to play was hard; failing a substantial number of inhabitants one couldn't hope to get far beyond fife and drum. Yet the bands (and the cafés) of small towns spread city tastes in music well outside their borders. Local and itinerant players were expected to conform, and found that they were hired and paid accordingly when there was a choice. They tried to follow fashion. And those who played for their own amusement tried to follow them. By the 1880's or 1890's the goatherds around La Garde-Freinet (Var), with their homemade flutes, "imitated perfectly the real musicians they heard at village fêtes. They played polka, mazurka, and quadrille tunes.”33 

Bagpipes and flutes and hurdy-gurdys went with particular melodies. As they were replaced by more fashionable instruments-accordion and brassesthe chants and dances they had accompanied (as in Vendée) also went by the board. Perhaps they would have gone anyway, for country people sought the city's music even before they sought its speech. When a self-taught villager in southern Puy-de-Dôme put together, in a homemade notebook, a selection of songs he had collected before 1848, what he hoarded was not native lore, but the songs and poems most typical of the official culture: "Noble espérance, De notre enfance"; and "Un ange au radieux visage, Penché sur le bord d'un berceau."84 

The more alien the language, the greater its prestige. Everyone spoke patois, grumbled a musical folklorist in the 1890's about the people of Lower Poitou, 

Fled Is That Music 

[[439]]

but when they made verses and songs they set this aside. "It is the townsmen, it is mossieu noutr' mâétre, whose language they try to imitate." The moment the peasant thought he was good enough, he wanted to sing in French. Musichall jingles were his idea of good music. He tried to imitate them or expected his local minstrels to do the job for him. As for patois songs, it was the literate city folk who looked to them for inspiration. What Charles Nisard called la muse foraine was interested only in Paris wares. 

35 The desire for novelty, coupled with the prestige of city life and activities, made songs one of the great avenues by which the national language penetrated the alien countryside.\* 

The most spectacular case in point is "La Marseillaise." Born at Strasbourg as the battle song of the Army of the Rhine on April 25, 1792, the new composition was given its first official airing in the salon of that city's mayor the next evening, then was played by the National Guard band that Sunday, April 29, 

and sung by the Lyon volunteers of the First Rhône-and-Loire Battalion, who paraded on the Strasbourg place d'Armes. It was printed within a few days, and by May 17 we hear of its being sung at Montpellier. Within a few days a delegate of the Constitutional (that is, Girondist) Society of Montpellier had carried it to Marseille, where on May 22 he sang it, arousing great enthusiasm, at the end of a Constitutional banquet. The very next day the song was printed in the local press. More important, it was also printed on a separate broadsheet, several copies of which were given to each of the volunteers of the Marseille Battalion, then being raised with some difficulty. Because they sang the song constantly and distributed copies of it on their march to Paris, which took all of July, the song became known as the hymn or the air of the Marseillais.36 

This raises an intriguing question: who sang "La Marseillaise"? Or more precisely, how was it that these young recruits so readily sang 

the song in French? In 1792, by all accounts, French was as foreign to most Provençaux as it is to Senegalese today-perhaps rather more so. The ordinary people of Marseille understood enough French to get by in affairs of business and other day-to-day transactions, but seldom spoke the language. This suggests that the volunteers who, we know, were led by young men of the upper classeshence bilingual--included a good few whose trade edged toward French: ex-soldiers, journalists, artisans, and dockworkers. A writer of the 1840's claimed that the corps of volunteers consisted of only a few true Marseillais among a rabble of foreign elements; and though he is a hostile witness, one 

On this process, see Terence Ranger, Dance and Society in Eastern Africa (Berkeley, Calif., 1975), especially p. 129. In this book Ranger traces the history of a dance style called beni, which had developed on the coast of East Africa in places like Mombasa and Dar-es-Salaam. As beni penetrated into the back country of the interior, it carried with it the aura of Swahili civilization. It was danced to songs whose words were in Swahili, it came from the great Swahili urban centers, and as a local informant told Ranger, "People who could sing in such a dance were esteemed very highly as Swahili, even though his or her spoken Swahili was very poor."

could reasonably suppose that there would be numbers of outsiders in a great port, that 

many of them would be politically available, that some would be glad to find work, even in the army, and that they understood at least some French. In any case, this mixture of "rude men of the people" and young men of the upper classes, using "foreign speech mingled with swear words," captured the popular imagination along their way. They also sang Rouget de Lisle's hymn, to which they had added a refrain in Provençal: 

Marcheu, trou de Diou. Marcheu, pétard de Diou. Leis émigras, noum de Diou. N'avouran ges de bouen Diou Qué leis curé monar et vieou. 

But obviously what was remembered and learned wherever they passed was the words in French.3 

[[37]]

By autumn the hymn created in the far northeast and disseminated first from the south, and only then from Paris, was sung throughout France— "by all the troops and by the children," specified a report of October 28, thus naming the chief agents of its penetration. Within a very short while we hear about the first counteruse of the exciting tune: a version in Vendean dialect sung by the insurgents of the west. Many would follow. The paradox was that the new hymn was linked to a city whose people did not speak French, or, in the case of many, feel that they were French.38 But even those who did not speak French could sing it, and singing endowed them with the gift of tongues. We hear about a political riot at Tarascon in 1850, where it was said the Reds cried out ferociously while singing "La Marseillaise." The song even helped the singers pick up an elementary knowledge of the national language, perhaps encouraged them to learn more of it. At any rate, though banned by the Second Empire, "La Marseillaise" never disappeared. A workers' song of 1853, which has the journeymen off for a Monday's drinking in the country, has them settling down to sing as they quaff: 

And if one of us should know it, Let him sing "La Marseillaise"! 

In 1858, in the wake of Félix Orsini's attempt against the life of Napoleon III, we hear that the song 

caused an incident when sung in a rural commune of the Pyrenees.39 It was only a little later that the young Arsène Vermenouze learned to play the trumpet for the sake of the tune. In 1879 the Republicans reinstated it as the national anthem-and that, by the 1890's, it had fully become. The warlike patriotic song of a political faction had in the end become the song of all, carrying not only the language of its lyrics but a potent national sentiment. "One sings 'La Marseillaise' for its words, of course," said Maurice Barrès in 1902, "but [especially] for the mass of emotions that it stirs

in our subconscious!"40 Could anything but a song have wrought so much? There were, of course, many other songs in French besides "La Marseillaise," and some were immensely popular, notably those of Pierre-Jean de Béranger in the 1830's. François Mazuy, writing in Marseille in 1854, emphasized the impact these and other French songs had in spreading the national language. So national integration, among other things, involved a war of songs. Before educated men turned to collecting popular songs, like butterflies on pins and just as dead, they pursued them with their ire. Songs went with dances, and their goings-on, like those of the veillées with which both were frequently associated, were steadfastly denounced throughout the century as coarse, improper, bawdy, lewd, spurring immodesty in girls and lust in men. Certainly some of the lyrics that have come down to us must have made respectable ears burn. A rather mild example comes from Châteauneuf, in Saintonge, where they danced a very fast reel called "Le Bal de Suzon" or "Bal de Pête la Veille": 

Suzon est encor'q'une enfant 

Qui fait tout c'que sa mère lui défend. Quand elle se fâche, elle lui répète: 

Pête! Pête! Pête! Pête! 

Quand elle se fâche, elle lui répète: Pête! Pête! Pête! Pête! 

Pête, veille, en attendant.41 

Like many of his well-intentioned ilk, Xavier Thiriat, writing about the Vosges in the late 1860's, stressed the vulgar character of native songs as opposed to "those coming from big cities and written in our time," which he found “well inspired and true expressions of noble sentiments."2 Such feelings were the stronger among professional carriers of civilization and literacy: the teachers.\* Songs, like other forms of popular culture, were best shed, and the sooner the better. "All one hears in our countryside," grumbled one wouldbe reformer in 1860, were "coarse and impure songs... trivial melodies...obscene and demoralizing lyrics." The local youth going to veillées, grumbled a minister in the Pyrenees, made the valleys ring with their powerful discordant voices, "entuning warlike and erotic songs, which happily they do not always understand." These could be replaced by edifying hymns to God and nature; perhaps the schools could wean them from their bad ways. A teacher agreed: the songs that would improve morals, refine feelings, ennoble the spirit, develop intellect, were completely unknown. Schoolteachers (wrote Paul Bordes) had to realize that it was their duty, nay their mission, to propagate such songs. They did.

\* Consider this remark in Charles Robert, Plaintes et voeux présentés par les instituteurs publics en 1861, p. 104: "Que dire de ces chansons obscènes ou à double sens vendues les jours de foire sur la place publique de la ville voisine et importées au village quelquefois par les pères de famille eux-mêmes pour y faire lire leurs enfants. Elles sont chantées le soir à la veillée et commentées sans réserve devant les jeunes filles."

CHANGE AND ASSIMILATION 

In 1864 a school inspector in the department of Aude proudly reported that "the lewd songs that wounded even the least modest ears have been replaced by the religious and patriotic choirs of numerous orphéons [choral societies] due to schools and the initiative of teachers." Under the Republic, such virtuous but isolated efforts turned into nationwide campaigns. Jules Simon, Minister of Public Instruction in 1872, had been struck by the vulgar airs and stupid lyrics of the songs workers or peasants sang when they got together. He sought to remedy this, namely by distributing songbooks for use in schools, and making singing lessons an important part of the elementary school curriculum. In these songbooks, which followed German models, were concentrated songs that were plainly designed to inculcate a sense of the fatherland, of civilization, and of moral ideals. So effective was this program that by the mid-1880's we begin to hear the hills echoing no longer with lewd ditties but with the songs of Paul Déroulède yelled out by enthusiastic schoolboys. Songs learned at school, noted a gratified Félix Pécaut in 1894, were beginning to replace among adult youth "the bad songs that have been too current in France."44 

The schools had an important collaborator-the orphéon, which was often in fact conducted by the teacher. To Amédée Reuchsel, one of the great apostles of the singing creed, there was no more socially useful profession than that of choirmaster. Singing together had great moral and intellectual value, "provided popular singing can be raised from mere musical stuttering to a level of artistic expression that reflects the refinements and the progress of musical taste."45 

Orphéons and more typically working-class singing societies began to appear in Paris and in Nord during the Restoration and spread through the rest of France after the 1850's. About 1,000 such groups were founded during the nineteenth century, but few proved really lasting, and fewer still got close to the rural level. Reuchsel found only 58 orphéons that were founded before 1880 still going in 1906; 15 of these were in the north, 8 in Paris or the Paris suburbs, 5 in Lyon, 3 in Toulouse, 17 in other departmental capitals, and the remaining 10 in fairly important provincial towns. (See Map 20.) A similar impression is left by an examination of the Associations file of Pyrénées-Orientales, which shows that every choir in the department was in either a cantonal or a district town. Most, moreover, dated from the 1890's; the earliest listed was founded in 1886. Such singing groups were instruments of the official culture.\* Even in Nîmes, Marseille, and Montpellier, where 

\*True, Michelle Perrot indicates the role of local singing groups in the program of meetings held by striking workers or in putting on shows to raise strike funds. But I would argue that this was part, at least, of a process of "negative integration" in the cultural life of the wider nation. The more so, since such programs usually began with "La Marseillaise" and ended with the "Chant du Départ." (Ouvriers en Grève, 2: 529.) More typical in my view was the situation at Douai (Nord), where in the 1870's the posh Société Chorale was rivaled by an orpheon whose singers belonged to the "popular classes" and whose performances were found "rather laughable"

workingmen had separate societies and sang works in local dialect of their own devising, they avoided public performances of "songs in the vulgar tongue." When Louis Napoleon visited Aix-en-Provence in 1852, attempts to organize a performance of Provençal songs for his benefit failed. The

The victorious singers reentered their town in a triumphal procession, and flowers were thrown at the open carriages in which they proceeded, behind a band, to the town hall, where they were fêted at a vin d'honneur. (Madame Camescasse, Souvenirs, pp. 83-85.) This sounds like very positive integration indeed in the rituals of the official culture.444

choirs sang fragments from operas and comic operas, and original songs in French by local composers.\* Cultural snobbery, or refusal to play an exotic role? The result was the same. 

In the countryside, however, all this took much longer. Not that resistance was deliberate; it hung on communications, facilities, and restricted means. Traditional songs went with poverty and isolation, and depended heavily on the survival of traditional carriers of song. As the activities of these carriers declined, country songs, like country veillées, gave way. In 1873 we hear that beggars had become few in Forez and Velay, and that they no longer sang while begging. In Brittany in the 1880's minstrels and bards were being pressed back by the "civilization" attendant on roads and railways, and traditional songs were receding before city ones. Fiddlers and bagpipers added more and more music hall pieces to their repertory. At country weddings, remarked a folklorist in 1881, one seldom heard anything but sentimental love songs that had been fashionable in towns a score of years before. Not all who sang them understood what they said. We hear about a Provençal five-year-old who learned by heart a French ballad, which he sang over and over to his father's pride, and in which he was almost letter perfect, though he did not understand a word of it and could not have said what any of it meant." 

48 But the eventual outcome of the new tendency was predictable. 

In the late 1880's peddlers, sabotiers, and rag-and-bone men were thinning out fast, and native poetry and song waned with them. Flax and homemade linen gave way to factory-made goods, fewer songs were spun along with flax, and by 1905 we hear that the last bastions of Breton songs-Tréguier, Lannion, Morlaix, Guingamp-have fallen to French. In Lot local dialect songs were still sung at harvest time and Carnival in the 1880's but were otherwise going out, perhaps as a direct result of greater material comfort.\*9 

The old conscript songs faded out, too. Many had been in local dialect; others, in French, had referred to conditions of military service that changed after 1889. Around 1900 observers noted the disappearance of these traditional tunes and their replacement by songs on more general themes, such as drinking, with no local flavor or particular character of their own. Albert Dauzat considered that patois songs disappeared in Auvergne and were replaced by French ones by the end of the century. Julien Tiersot, who worked in the Alps and in Dauphiné about that time, could not find a single song in onceisolated Bourg-d'Oisans that was truly popular. In roughly the same period, Francis Pérot noted the rapid disappearance of popular and native melodies in Bourbonnais.50 

Everywhere it seems that itinerant singers and musicians who went from fête to fête had forgotten the old songs and verses. In any case, the young, school-taught, despised them. "No one knows old country songs or sees the old local dances.... The eternal trumpet repeats the same musical tunes everywhere, and the city slippers of the peasant girls shuffle in the same slow waltz."

[[445]]

Café-concerts, once the preserve of wealthier places, made their appearance in lesser towns. Peasants started attending them, now that they had the means, and brought the new saws home. Greater exposure to this "high-class" singing, backed up sometimes by a gramophone, began to affect the singing at the feasts. Tillage songs and banquet songs, henceforth in French (at least in basically French-speaking areas), reflected the repertory of the café-concert. Standards of singing rose, but voices did not improve; so fear of ridicule began to hamstring those who had never hesitated to start up a tune. Specialization took another step, and, in due course, the habit of singing itself declined as professionalism and technology took over." 

[[51]]

But though I believe singing did truly decline in the general and evolutionary sense, and especially with the advent of radio between the wars, the process was surely a slow and patchy one. Allegations that people were singing less than of yore go back at least to the beginning of the nineteenth century, and seem simply a way of saying that things were not what they used to be in the speaker's youth. France differed in its many corners, as we know. Where songs and singing were anchored in local ways, they endured a long timeas in Brittany. When President Carnot was murdered in 1894, a ballad appeared-the "Gwerz ar Président Carnot"-to mark the event; another, in 1896, detailed a drunken murder at Locquenolé (Finistère). As late as 1961 an anonymous Breton composed a gwerz called "Emgann Montroulez" (the Battle of Morlaix) to tell the story of the great artichoke war in which the peasants clashed with the sub-prefect.52 

As the report of a song-gathering mission intimated as early as 1883, the Breton bards were getting old and dying out. But Frances Gostling still encountered them in Finistère in 1906: 

At the pardon on Trinity Sunday, the ragged bards assemble at Rumengol from far and near. I recall one of them sitting with his wife behind a stall piled high with leaflet songs. The couple were singing with all their might to a group of young peasants who, having bought the words, were thus learning the tunes traditionally, as they had probably been handed down for many a generation.... The young folks wanted tunes... to sing to those songs with which the pockets of their sky-blue jackets were already bulging. 

Here are the familiar figures peddling their own songs wherever crowds assembled, often by way of printed broadsheets prepared at their dictation; and it is true that they are old. Yet Yann Brekilien quotes a number of younger songmakers who were active at the turn of the century and before the First World War.53 The school that taught the Bretons French also taught them how to read and write. Thereafter, the songmaking tradition could bear fruit on paper, the singing public could actually read the words. What changed was less the bent to singing than the subject of the songs, hence their cultural baggage. There is no evidence that other parts of France still produced songs

spontaneously to mark the exploits of political encounters or the appointment of new Prime Ministers. But the very use of such themes suggests that a onceisolated land had joined the community of other Frenchmen.\* 

A similar development, in which national forms and themes penetrated native ones, seems to have occurred in dancing. Simple to learn, rhythmic sometimes to the point of binding participants in a common spell, traditional dancing was a fundamentally collective enterprise. Every dancer attended on every other one, did what everyone did in a jogging communion where all were part of the same mass and lived the same experience. In traditional dances, every dancer carried by the joint enterprise is freed of personal initiative, responsibility, even self-consciousness, released into the sort of physical and psychic euphoria that makes dancing such a special pleasure. A dancing that heartens and thrills and stimulates, fascinates and inspirits, can serve multiple functions: magic, as at Carnival to ensure a good crop of flax or on May eve to placate the fairies; religious, to honor saints and their feasts; ceremonial, as at marriages; utilitarian, as a way of pounding the loam of a threshing floor; above all, perhaps, recreational.54 

Hard physical work demands relief, not, it appears, in relaxation but in contrasting agitation; and dancing throughout the nineteenth century had the reputation of providing such relief. Dancing broke weariness-cassait la fatigue-and most backbreaking toil tended to strike a balance with a dance. Industrial workers relaxed by dancing tirelessly on Sundays and, sometimes, immediately after their work. This was even more striking in the countryside, partly perhaps because of the sensible tendency (followed in veillées) to combine the useful and the pleasant whenever possible. Harvesting, threshing, and pulling up or trampling crops, all gave rise to dances and to fêtes. These have been studied most thoroughly in Brittany by Jean-Michel Guilcher, and I have drawn most of my instances from his work. But though Brittany is richer in traditional dances than most regions, the examples to be found there seem fairly representative of a world where hard work and hard play went together. 

In those parts of Brittany where several villages got together come September to pull each other's beets, there would be dancing at night two or three times a week. These autumn arrachages, now gone, are still remembered as the season of "night feasts." Perhaps the simple gathering of unwontedly large numbers produced a festive mood comparable to that of a fair or feast. This was most obvious during the grain harvest, which saw the hardest and most 

Raymond Doussinet mentions a violently anti-British ballad in connection with the Boer War that circulated in the Charentes at the turn of the century (Les Travaux et les jeux, p. 497). Likewise in back-country Var song-sellers hawked ballads about the Russo-Japanese and Turko- Italian wars, the sinking of the Titanic, various famous local crimes, and the like. Comments Léon Sénéquier: "Ainsi, par ce moyen, la jeunesse des coins les plus réculés pouvait chanter ce qui se chantait dans les villes quelques semaines auparavant" (Connaissance de La Garde-Freinet, p. 67).

prolonged labor of the year. This enterprise also brought together untoward numbers of workers. Not only did it culminate in harvest feasts, but the gangs of itinerant harvesters seem to have followed each day's toil with boisterous dancing. We even hear of troops of women laborers who came down from Flanders to work around Dunkirk at harvest time toward the end of the Second Empire and who, their labor ended, every evening "give themselves over to almost fantastic and prolonged dances, despite the fatigues of the day; they rigorously exclude any man from their sport." This last was indeed a "peculiar trait," as J. A. Barral has put it, and suggests the therapeutic aspect of such play. 

[[55]]

Most of the time, dancing was an integral part of the courting ritual; witness the many places where engaged or married couples simply did not join in the dance. At most veillées the elders watched while the young danced. Breton yarn-and-spinning parties seem to have been reserved for the single young. In a Languedoc village we hear that the village feast was largely viewed as an opportunity to bring out marriageable lads and lasses, and was the function where most of the older villagers had found their spouse. "Those engaged and the young married couples do not dance. They have already found."58 

Yet dancing was also fun, and Bretons found ingenious ways of linking fun and labor. Threshing the grain was followed by dancing; but the winnowing process was itself a collective dance-the amblendadeg, in which participants, barefoot or wearing unstudded sabots, trampled the sarrasin (buckwheat) to free it of the last bits of rind still clinging to the kernel. So were the fest al leur nevez, in which a new threshing floor was pounded down, and similar dances held to level out an earthen floor for a new house. This sort of thing was hard work, and the expression poania da zansal-to toil at dancing-reflects it. But it had its uses, and it would endure as long as buckwheat was the principal grain and bare earth the only flooring.57 

People with limited means who danced a good deal, and often spontaneously, had to provide their own cadence. One Pyrenean mayor in 1838 complained that he could not hold a dance on the anniversary of the July Revolution because he could not find musicians. Most people seem to have done without musicians for a good while longer. At Ligardes (Gers) the dancing song (cansoun dansadero) was replaced by instruments during the July Monarchy: first fife and tambourine, then hurdy-gurdy or violin. But Ligardes, though hardly urban, was the chief bourg of a canton, and smaller places presumably waited longer.5 

[[58]]

In Vendée the violin was beginning to be heard in the little town of Beauvoir-sur-Mer in 1868, but in the surrounding areas "the peasants remain true to their ancient habit of dancing rondes while singing." In the Basque country village lads learned their dance steps on the threshing floor of evenings, with one youth singing or whistling appropriate songs while the dancing

his students through their paces. This only waned in the twentieth century. In any case one, two, or three itinerant musicians served a fairly large area and were sometimes unavailable because several functions coincided. Some regions-Trégor, Léon-appear to have had no instruments (outside the towns) until the appearance of the accordion. In others the owners of such instruments as there were-bagpipes, fifes, fiddles, or oboe-type woodwinds like the bombarde of Morbihan-performed only for a fee. Feasts with musicians had greater prestige, but a good many weddings relied on invited or hired singers, and people had no less fun. It is hard to tell, but I am inclined to think that vocal accompaniment, ranging upward from a simple tra-la-la, was pretty much the rule for peasant dances other than substantial marriages and important feasts until quite late in the century. Sonneurs and ménétriers continued to be rare until the 1890's, and their passing through a village still an event that gathered crowds.59 

Dancing was simple and simple to learn. Complex traditional forms, like those of some Basque dances, called for special training. But most local repertory was limited, and the same movements recurred over and over. Children saw the local dances endlessly repeated, assimilated them, copied and imitated the steps, and were gradually permitted to join in. Initiation was easy, and novices did not stand out much, since the traditional dances were collective, danced in the round (branle or ronde) or in two facing lines (bourrée). The dancers held hands or clasped their neighbors' shoulder or waist, repeating the same moves and steps, which soon became an almost automatic motion. Guilcher has noted the predominance of the use of the closed circle, facing inward, capable of admitting an unlimited number of dancers and also of excluding the rest of the world. The steps and rhythms used in the circle were generally simple: the common gesture of one local group reinforcing its unity as much as or more than church attendance, and also differentiating it from other groups. Like a circle, a chain was capable of taking any number of dancers, even up to a thousand, as sometimes happened in those Breton marriages in which every guest but the destitute paid for his share, and the dance became practically one with the community.60 

All this persisted through most of the nineteenth century (and into our time in rural parts of Brittany or the Landes). When, in the late 1880's and the early 1890's, Trébucq scoured the Vendée, "mounted on [his] swift bicycle," he still found lads and lasses dancing jigs in the round, "singing and gesticulating with irresistible animation." About the same time, an English wayfarer described the loud, stomping bourrées he watched at a Lozère village inn, danced to the accompaniment of singing and whistling.\* But the tradi-

But Barker noted that the only females who participated were the maidservants. "In these villages and small towns the girls are kept out of harm's way." Furthermore, "the priests wherever they have influence... set their faces strongly against dancing by the two sexes."

[[449]]

tional collective jigs and shuffles encountered growing competition from the modern style of dancing in pairs. At Lille and Nancy under the Second Empire young people were still joining hands in collective song-dances in the streets. But gradually adults were leaving these to adolescents, and they in turn began to leave them to children. In Gers the beaten earth that had been good enough for the old hops had to give way to parquet flooring and to the relative constraints of dancing indoors. Local roundelays were being overborne by "wanton" waltzes, polkas, and schottisches. The dancers had learned the steps from soldiers who returned from military service under the July Monarchy, and "nearly all the young people would have thought to lose face if they had not followed their lessons." In Morvan it was young men returning from Paris in the 1870's who introduced new dances that in due course replaced the square dance and the jig. In Lot by 1880 all that one knew was "ballroom dances," especially quadrilles. In Doubs by 1889 even "pretty quadrilles" were going out, replaced by waltzes, polkas, and mazurkas. In Corrèze in 1893 the bourrée had almost been forgotten, and the montagnarde was far less popular than it used to be. People preferred quadrilles, polkas, waltzes, and schottisches. In Lorraine "the dances of city people" took over in the 1880's. Children were being taught to perform traditional local dances for their quaintness, but if at some wedding or feast a group began to perform a traditional dance, people would crowd around and watch as if it were a curiosity.1 

In Lauragais, too, by 1891 "old dances disappear progressively and most already survive only as memories." In the Upper Limousin bourrées survived as oddities; everyone was said to dance waltzes and polkas. In the villages of the Creuse valley even the waltz declined; at the conscript dances of 1913 couples danced polkas and schottisches to the pumping of accordions. In Basque villages dance companies declined after the turn of the century. The young were losing interest in traditional dances, and there was less prestige in performing them. As a result, the old Basque masquerades decayed. Portions were dropped or abridged, and poor dancers or even non-dancers were enrolled for lack of any choice in a vicious circle that inevitably led to withering.62 

As people began to travel about more, strangers from the outside were more and more likely to be found at what had once been closed communal dances, and this too affected the repertory. In Dauphiné the traditional rigadoon, danced either to a fiddle or to a simple song, began to share the honors at local dances with more citified forms toward the end of the century, partly, we are told, so strangers could also dance and join in local affairs. Old instruments-bagpipes, or fife and drum-gave way to louder brasses, which helped 

At Branches (Yonne) in the old days a stranger who dared attend the village bal was set faceback astride a donkey with the animal's tail between his teeth, to be led for several turns around the dancing area, and then was forced to stand drinks for his tormentors. (M. C. Moiset,. "Usages, croyances, traditions," pp. 21-22.) 

[[450]]

to eliminate old dancing songs as well. In Auvergne and the Limousin in the 1890's "fiddles and brass supplant the bagpipe and the simple song." By the end of the century, the hurdy-gurdy had been displaced by the accordion, "henceforth the obligatory accompaniment at feasts and dances." The musical repertory necessarily changed; the door to urban influences was opened wider still.\* 

Those influences led to the founding of numerous rural musical societies in the 1880's and thereafter, which gave regular concerts and "family dances" where young people met, courted, and danced as they once had at veillées. For a smallish village like Changy in Roannais, without many alternatives, the musical society, which was founded in 1891 and lasted into the 1930's, provided an indispensable service. The more indispensable because as veillées declined so did the convenient custom of lads and lasses courting in fields and pastures, which were increasingly enclosed by 1900. Concurrently, the number of dances rose. The formal, organized bals for marriages or feasts could not alone provide adequate social opportunities once veillées disappeared. Young people began to organize informal dances in some barn or in the backroom of a bistro. They also organized dancing societies, which if one can judge by the case of Pyrénées-Orientales were a major preoccupation of the young people for miles around. There they played such an essential role that even traditional feuds gave way before them. In 1896 the mayor of Baixas expressed his delight that youth groups, reconciled around the dancing society, had given up the brawls that turned public places into battlegrounds. In 1900 the youth groups of Céret signed what amounted to a formal treaty, regulating the operations of the dancing society (founded in 1897) and specifying when different bands would be allowed to play. Céret is a district town; Baixas, Thuir, and Bompas are large market towns and administrative centers of their canton. But the bicycle (and its precursors) made them accessible to country lads, and in the decade before 1914 more and more farm boys came to own bicycles.\*\* 

At the same time, the rise of the new dances helped widen the gulf between generations. On the eve of the First World War a Limousin folklorist noted that the bourrée was danced only by mature persons, the young disdaining it. It also helped widen the gulf between the traditional and urbanized elements in the countryside. Peasants who had danced a great deal at local veillées and feasts found themselves embarrassed and often ill-at-ease before the newfangled (and ever-growing number of) urban dances. They danced them 

\* The disappearance of once-familiar instruments produced strange etymological effects. In Sologne the popular urban ceremony of the procession of the boeuf gras during Carnival had been taken up by a good many rural bourgs. At Yvoy-le-Marron, a village of Loir-et-Cher, the fatted ox had been paraded around to the accompaniment of a hurdy-gurdy and came to be called the boeuf viellé. By the turn of the century, with the vielle abandoned and forgotten, the term had lost its sense, and people now used the incomprehensible boeuf violet. (Bernard Edeine, La Sologne, 2: 799.)

badly, if at all, and they perceived more strongly than ever their inferiority to urban standards, even those adhered to by their more affluent neighbors.85 In any case, much of the original point of dancing had by the turn of the century drained away. Once upon a time dancing had reconciled the public and private, rite and relief, the affirmation of group unity and the expression of individual personality. Now all the public ritual aspects of dancing began to lose their force, the collective character disappeared, and the sport became simply a form of personal gratification taken in company. 

Most important, perhaps, the functional aspects of dancing had been seeping away. People had danced on certain pilgrimages, in certain processions, in or outside the church-as David once danced before the Ark of the Covenant. The tripettes of Provence, a sort of jig designed to drive out the falling sickness (mal caduc), were still being danced around Manosque in the 1890's. One danced around the bread oven, around the hearth, between the vines. Participants and observers understood the homeopathic virtues of leaps and bounds designed to make the crops grow high, of mimicry that simulated work gestures: sowing or reaping or pressing the grapes. At Saint-Marceld'Ardèche, on the patron saint's day, in barren mid-January, the villagers put up a mast topped with a bunch of evergreen and danced around it, singing: 

Plantaren la frigoulo et jamaï blan-bé l'arabara. Faren la farandoula et la mountagne flourira! 

[[66]]

Sympathetic magic or exorcism, dancing had a powerful share in it. 

Then fertilizer came in, and rat poison, agronomy, medicine-and schools, of course—and this sort of dancing lost its practical sense: it became simply a show, for fun. The local dances no longer had a function to perform; and so they could be abandoned more easily, since (their functional purpose abandoned or rejected) they compared badly with their modern competitors. What had been an accessory, mere dancing, took over from the original purpose, which was gradually forgotten. And at that stage city dances were clearly better. They always had been "better" and more desirable, but they had also been relatively inaccessible. When all could find access to the instruments that played their music and to the parquet floors that facilitated their steps, all could agree that this was progress-especially the girls! 

With the suspension of most festivities for four and often five years during the war of 1914, the young ceased to learn such traditional dances as were still to be found. Veterans returned to their village bringing new “American” dances, and these soon became the new crazes of the young. Traditional dances survived fitfully among the aged, but they were old, just as polkas and mazurkas were now "old." No longer a social rite, dancing turned into simple 

amusement.
