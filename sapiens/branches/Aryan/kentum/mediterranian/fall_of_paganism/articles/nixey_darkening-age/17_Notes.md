10.Greenblatt \(2011\), 43–4.

11.For paganism as insanity, sickness, etc., see C. Th., 16.10.1–21 and C. Just., 1.11.10.

## THE INVISIBLE ARMY

1.Chitty \(1977\) calls it a pigsty, though this may not be strictly accurate: the Greek refers to him moving ‘just outside his house’ – presumably to some sort of simple structure there. Nonetheless, the idea of a pigsty confers well the idea of simplicity – even squalor – that would no doubt have been appropriate.

## TO DESPISE THE TEMPLES

1.This is the version from Eusebius’s Life of Constantine that, he says, Constantine told him with his own mouth. It was, Eusebius noted, an account that ‘might have been hard to believe had it been related by any other person’ \(*LC*, 1.26ff\). Historians have later found it hard to believe anyway. The other account in Lactantius \(*On the Deaths of the Persecutors*, 44.3ff\) is slightly different: in this, Constantine was told in a dream to mark the heavenly sign of God on the shields of his army, which he did, in the form of the chi-rho sign: as Lactantius put it, ‘he marked Christ on the shields’.

32.G. R. Evans \(2010\), 270–1.

33.Wilken \(1984\), xv.

34.Although shades of paganism survive even now. When the academic John Pollini was excavating in Turkey in the 1970s at the Greco-Roman site of Aphrodisias, he climbed Baba Dagh \(‘Father Mountain’\), the highest mountain in that part of Turkey. Near the summit, his Turkish guide and he met some shepherds, who, Pollini recalled, ‘were bringing sheep to sacrifice not to Allah but to the local god of the mountain, the genius loci’. In the ancient manner, they also tied filets around sticks planted in a pile of rocks. Shadows survived; the religious system itself had gone.
