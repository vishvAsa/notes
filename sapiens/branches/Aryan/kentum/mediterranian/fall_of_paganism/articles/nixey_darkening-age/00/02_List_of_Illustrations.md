**1. Triumphal Arch, ancient Palmyra, 1st–2nd century AD**

Ancient Palmyra, an oasis by the sands of the Syrian desert, took its name from the feathered palm trees that grew around it. Its wealth and air of glamour came largely from the diaphanous silks that were traded there.





**2. Colossal statue of Athena \(‘Athena-Allat’ as she was known in Palmyra\), 2nd century AD**

In the fourth century this statue was decapitated by Christians because she was idolatrous. Her arms were also chopped off. This photo shows the statue after reconstruction by archaeologists. In 2016 photos were released showing that the statue had been, once again, decapitated and mutilated; this time by ISIS.





**3. *The Triumph of Christianity*, Tommaso Laureti, *c*. 1585**

A god has been knocked from its pedestal by the triumphant cross of Christ and now lies broken on the floor. The bases of destroyed Greco-Roman statues were frequently used, once their statues had been removed, to mount Christian crosses.





**4. *Temptation of St Antony*, from the Isenheim Altarpiece, Matthias Grünewald, *c*. 1512–16**

It was said that demons might appear to humans in any form: as wicked thoughts or wild animals; as corpses or even as officious bureaucrats. According to his biographer, St Antony was attacked by demonic lions, wolves, serpents, leopards and bears.





**5. Belial and the demons, from *Proces de Belial de J. de Therano* by Antonius Ruttel de Parmenchingen, 1450**

According to early Christian texts, mankind was under perpetual attack by Satan and his fearsome footsoldiers, the demons. Their aim was to drag all humans to damnation.





**6. Funerary stele of Licinia Amiãs, Rome, early 3rd century AD**

One of the earliest Christian inscriptions. Above the Christian fish symbols is a dedication to the ‘DM’ – the Dis Manibus, the Roman gods of the underworld.





**7. *Allegory of the Deadly Sins*, Vincent de Beauvais, historical mirror, Paris, 1463**

Evagrius Ponticus, a brilliant monk who fled to the Egyptian desert, categorized all evil thoughts into eight categories – the forefathers of the seven deadly sins. Demons, it was said, used evil thoughts to incite mankind to sin.





**8. Bust of Epicurus, 341–270 BC**

The Greek philosopher Epicurus argued that the world and everything in it was made not by God but by the collision and combination of atoms. Epicureans hoped this idea would free people from irrational fear of divine powers. Augustine disliked the theory for much the same reason and celebrated the fact that, by his time, this philosophy had been successfully suppressed.





**9. Bust of Lucretius, 96?–55 BC**

In his great philosophical poem ‘On the Nature of Things’, the Roman poet Lucretius transformed Epicurus’ ideas into poetry – successfully, according to Virgil. ‘Fortunate was he,’ wrote the poet, ‘who was able to know the causes of things and crushed beneath his feet all fears and inexorable fate and the gaping grave.’





**10. Emperor Constantine and the Council of Nicaea with the burning of Arian books illustrated below, Italian manuscript, 9th century AD**

In the fourth century the Emperor Constantine announced that the works of Porphyry, a formidable critic of Christianity \(or ‘that enemy of piety’, as Constantine called him\), had been destroyed. Not a single book of Porphyry has survived to the modern era.





**11. Fresco of the raising of Lazarus, catacombs of Via Latina, Rome, 4th century AD**

In early images Christ was sometimes portrayed with a sorcerer’s wand in hand. Sceptical pagans said that what Christians saw as miracles were no different to what was offered by hucksters in Egyptian market-places who ‘for a few obols’ would perform similar tricks.





**12. *Triumph of Faith – Christian Martyrs in the Time of Nero, 65 AD*, Eugene Romain Thirion \(1839–1910\)**

Historians now think that the actual numbers of Christians killed in the persecutions should be numbered in hundreds rather than thousands.





**13. Colossal head of Emperor Constantine I ‘the Great’, Rome, 4th century BC**

According to his biographer, Constantine converted after he saw a flaming cross in the sky, though at another period in his life Constantine was said to have seen a vision of the god Apollo.





**14. Emperor Theodosius I at the Council of Constantinople, Latin manuscript, Turkey, 9th century**

Under the fiercely Christian emperor Theodosius I a series of formidable laws was issued against pagans.





**15. Temple of Diana at Ephesus, engraving, English School, 19th century**

The Temple of Artemis \(Diana in Latin\) at Ephesus was one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World. It had several incarnations, but according to the apocryphal Acts of John its final end came when John the Apostle entered the temple and began praying. At that moment, the altar shattered into pieces and ‘half of the temple fell down, so that the priest was slain at one blow’.





**16. Hestia, Dione and Aphrodite**





**17. The left-hand group of surviving figures from the East Pediment of the Parthenon, Athens**

The figures on the great East Pediment were almost certainly mutilated by Christians who believed them to be ‘demonic’. The central figures of the group are missing: they were probably levered off then ground into rubble to build a Christian church.





**1. Green basanite bust of Germanicus Caesar, Roman, Egypt**

Germanicus’ nose has been mutilated and a cross has been carved in his forehead – perhaps an attempt to ‘baptize’ Germanicus and so neutralize any possible demons within.





**2. *Saint Apollonia Destroys a Pagan Idol*, Giovanni d’Alemagna, *c*. 1442–5**

The saint calmly ascends to the idol, hammer in hand. Hagiographies frequently praised the flair with which saints smashed ancient temples and centuries-old statues.





**3. Cult statue of the deified Augustus, Ephesus, Turkey**

Augustus, who was considered divine by polytheist Romans, would have been considered demonic by Christians. He too has been disfigured by a crude carved cross.





**4. Theophilus standing on the Serapeion, Goleniscev Papyrus**

In the illustration of this manuscript, the bishop Theophilus stands, triumphant, over what had been widely considered to be the most beautiful temple in the whole world, the Temple of Serapis. Theophilus razed it in 392 AD.





**5. Byzantine Chapel in Roman amphitheatre, Duresi, Albania**

Laws encouraged Christians to use the remnants of old temples to build and repair roads and bridges – not only was the well-cut stone useful, this was an added insult to the old gods. Everywhere, Christians used the remnants of Roman infrastructure to construct churches.





**6. *Hypatia*, Charles William Mitchell, 1885**

The great mathematician and philosopher, Hypatia, improbably under-dressed. Hypatia was renowned for her chastity and wore an austere philosopher s cloak. When one of her pupils fell in love with her she showed him her sanitary towel to discourage him.





**7. Archimedes palimpsest, *c*. 10th–13th century**

A tenth-century copy of a work by Archimedes called *The Method of Mechanical Theorems*. In it, Archimedes had ingeniously applied mechanical laws, such as the law of the lever, to find the volume and area of geometric shapes. Two thousand years before Newton, he had come tantalizingly close to deriving calculus. However, in the thirteenth century this work was scraped off and overwritten with a prayer book.





**8. Theological debate between Catholic and Nestorian Christians at Acre, 1290 CE**

In AD 388 it was ruled that arguing or even discussing religious matters in public was a ‘damnable audacity’. Nestorius and his teachings were declared heretical.





**9. Satyr and maenad, detail from a wall painting in Pompeii \(fresco\), 1st century BC**

Later observers were shocked by the liberty with which pre-Christian Roman artists had depicted sex. ‘Lascivious frescoes and lewd sculptures,’ wrote one nineteenth-century American, ‘such as would be seized in any modern country by the police, filled the halls of the most virtuous Roman citizens and nobles.’





**10. Priapus, from the House of the Vettii, *c*. 50–79 AD**

The modern world was shocked – or professed itself to be – by the bawdiness of many of the works of art that were uncovered from Pompeii. The city’s eventual burial in ash was widely said to be the just desert of an impious people.





**11. Hell, Portuguese School, 16th century**

Early Christian texts described in precise detail the punishments meted out to sinners in hell. According to the Apocalypse of Peter, blasphemers would be hung up by their tongues, adulterers by their testicles and women ‘who adorned themselves for adultery’ would be strung up by their hair above the boiling mire.





**12. Painting of St John Chrysostom, Panagia Ties Asinou Church, Cyprus**

The charismatic, and fiery-tongued, John Chrysostom.





**13. Roman women playing with a ball in one of the so-called ‘Bikini Mosaics’ at Villa Romana del Casale, 4th century AD**

The habit of bathing continued well into the Christian era, but more hardline Christians looked with suspicion on bathhouses as immoral and the haunts of demons. Statues of Aphrodite and other gods, which often stood in the baths, were frequently mutilated and defaced by believers.





**14. St Simeon Stylites sitting on his column, 5th or 6th century**

Believers endured great trials for the love of God. St Simeon spent over three decades sitting on a column until his feet and belly burst open from the pressure of continued standing.





**15. St Shenoute, secco painting, Red Monastery Church, Egypt, *c*. 7th century**

St Shenoute’s face was said to be gaunt and hollow-eyed from continued fasting. Shenoute beat those in his care, hounded those suspected of paganism and declared that ‘there is no crime for those who have Christ’.





**16. Emperor Justinian I, mosaic, San Vitale, Ravenna, Italy, *c*. 547 AD**

The Emperor Justinian was determined to ‘close all the roads which lead to error’. As part of this, he forbade anyone pagan from teaching, ordered execution for anyone who was caught sacrificing to statues and forced the Academy in Athens to close.
