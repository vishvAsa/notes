      <description>&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&#34;https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2006/07/27/emperor-julian/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Many years ago when we were yapping away on the then latest production&#xA;of the socialist academic Jared Diamond, Guns Germs Steel Blah blah, we&#xA;turned our attention to two historical incidents which were reasonably&#xA;faithfully described by him. One was the destruction of the Native South&#xA;Americans by the Spanish conquistadors and the other was the&#xA;cannibalizing of one Austronesian tribe the Moriori by another the&#xA;Maori. Given his Marxist bent it is not at all surprising that he went&#xA;on to equate the two events, and try to explain them through his&#xA;universalist view of geographic contingency, which he repeats ad nauseum&#xA;in that long-winding tome. The point he missed was that, despite the&#xA;similarity in outcome, the Spanish destruction of the Native South&#xA;Americans and Mexicans was something different – the technological&#xA;difference was merely a sideshow- in reality it was the result of the&#xA;memetic infection of Isaism that had seized the European mind.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
