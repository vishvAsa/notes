The magnification of Caesar Augustus by Virgil in the Aeneid:

...........
> And here, here is the man, the promised one you know of â€”  
Caesar Augustus, son of a god, destined to rule  
Where Saturn ruled of old in Latium, and there  
Bring back the age of gold: his empire shall expand    
Past Garamants and Indians to a land beyond the zodiac  
And the sun's yearly path, where Atlas the sky-bearer pivots  
The wheeling heavens, embossed with fiery stars, on his shoulder.  
............

The Garamants are the people who are today called Berbers.  
Of course, despite the Alexandrian pretensions,  
his empire did not extend past that of the Iranians, leave alone the Indians.
