<p>The Sea People - Alexander the Great tread in the footsteps of forgotten Greeks</p>
<p>[TABLE]</p>
<h2 id="tyre">Tyre</h2>
<p>Following his triumph over the Persians and their subjects at the Battle
of Issus in 333 BC, Alexander the Great advanced south into Lebanon. The
Phoenician city-states knelt to him, with the exception of Tyre. Blessed
with two harbors and the love of far-away Carthage, Tyre was a threat to
Alexander’s supply lines as he prepared to conquer the Persian Empire.
From Tyre, the beleaguered Persians could land behind Alexander’s forces
and isolate them from Greece, or they could sail to Greece and sponsor
an uprising against Alexander with the restless Athenians.</p>
<p>Tyre was well fortified, and the city-state included a walled island off
the coast. Determined to eliminate the threat, Alexander built a
causeway from the coast to bombard the island with artillery. Tyre
responded by converting old boats into fireships that were rammed into
the artillery, destroying it all. Committed to taking the island,
Alexander assembled a navy from Tyre’s Phoenician rivals as well as from
the Cypriots and several Greek cities in Ionia. After six months of
exhaustive siegecraft, Alexander was able to breach the walls of Tyre
and storm the fortress island. 6,000 defenders were killed in the storm,
2,000 locals were crucified afterwards, and what was left of the
population was sold into slavery.</p>
<h2 id="gaza">Gaza</h2>
<p>The threat of the Persian navy eliminated, Alexander marched south to
take Egypt. The fortress at Gaza under the command of the eunuch Batis
remained loyal to the Persians, and blocked Alexander’s path to Egypt.
Batis hoped that he could hold out against Alexander to give Darius
enough time to raise a new army and lift the siege. Batis’ hopes were
misplaced, and Alexander stormed the fortress successfully on his fourth
attempt. The men of Gaza were exterminated, and the women and children
were sold into slavery.</p>
<h2 id="sea-people">Sea people</h2>
<p>Alexander’s destructive path down the Levantine coast was not
unprecedented, even among Greeks. Over 800 years before, other Greeks
had laid waste to the Levant, known only to their adversaries as the
mysterious “Sea Peoples”. Since the rediscovery and decipherment of
Bronze Age texts in the 19th century the identity of the Sea Peoples has
remained undetermined until now. New work in archaeology and genetics
has positively identified at least some of them, and given new insights
into their world.</p>
<h2 id="links-to-mid-east">Links to Mid east</h2>
<p>The peoples of Greece past and present have been linked to the Middle
East more closely than any of the other peoples of Europe. Their
ancestry, their culture, and their history has deep links, far deeper
than is commonly understood.</p>
<h3 id="eefs---7000-bce">EEFs - 7000 BCE</h3>
<p>Greece was the first part of Europe colonized by the Early European
Farmers, migrants from Anatolia (Asiatic Turkey) who introduced farming
to the continent. The Early European Farmers, or EEFs, colonized Crete
by 7000 BC, mainland Greece by 6700 BC, and Macedonia by 6500 BC. From
there, they spread across the Europe. One branch of EEFs migrated by
land into Hungary, Ukraine, Romania, and Germany. The other branch
migrated by the coast into Italy, southern France, Iberia, and finally
North Africa. As they expanded, the EEFs encountered other races, among
them the primitive Western Hunter-Gatherers (WHGs) and the Eastern
Hunter-Gatherers (EHGs) .</p>

<p>By the mid to late 5th millennium, the peoples of Greece had diverged
from their cousins. Europe was convulsed in a parallel set of conflicts
involving tribes of WHGs conquering their EEF neighbors and establishing
themselves as a new ruling class, catalyzing a new synthetic culture
with their new subjects. Greece was one of the few regions of Europe
spared that particular conflict (Croatia was another), and was instead
affected by the changes in Anatolia.</p>
<h3 id="eef--chgs---5800-bce">EEF + CHGs - 5800 BCE</h3>
<p>Even before those 5th millennium convulsions, Greece had followed a
different path. As early as the 58th century BC, there are signs of
further migrants from Anatolia settling in Greece and the southern
Balkans. These migrants bore both the familiar ancestry of the Early
European Farmers as well as genetically distinctive ancestry of the
Caucasian Hunter-Gatherers (CHGs). The migrants were the products of a
complex process of migration and mixing that was taking place over much
of the Middle East at the time.</p>
<p>As the populations of 5th millennium BC Anatolia and Greece were mostly
descended from the EEFs, even small shifts detected in their CHG
ancestry fraction would imply substantial population replacements
because the possible sources of CHG ancestry were already quite diluted.+++(4)+++
There is some evidence for how such shifts may have occurred.</p>
<p>Alepotrypa cave is an archaeological site from around 3800 BC in the
Peloponnesus. More than a tenth of the skeletons show that healed skull
fractures.+++(5)+++ Further north in Thessaly, the site at Sesklo was a walled
settlement destroyed by fire around 4400 BC, after which it was
abandoned.</p>
<p>While those specific sites are unlikely to represent population changing
migrations, they do give a picture for the violence of the era. There is
no reason to believe that invaders from across the Aegean Sea would have
been any kinder.</p>
<h2 id="cycladics-early-helladics-and-minoans---3300-bce">Cycladics, Early Helladics, and Minoans - 3300 BCE</h2>
<p>The 33rd century BC was a time of great upheaval even by the standards
of prehistory. New fortifications were erected all over the Balkans, and
were paralleled with the depopulation of numerous archaeological sites.
The invention of multi-oared longboats allowed for trade routes to
connect the peoples of the Eastern Mediterranean and the Black Sea more
closely than ever. North Caucasian pots, Egyptian glaze, Baltic amber,
Crimean carved stone stelae, and undoubtedly much more crossed the seas.</p>
<p>Improvements in seafaring did not only bring about more trade. The 33rd
century saw a sudden increase in the amount of CHG ancestry found in the
peoples of Greece, three new archaeological cultures, and the
introduction of bronze. Invaders, possibly from the Black Sea coast of
northern Anatolia, replaced a significant part of the population.</p>
<p>These invaders included the famous Minoans of Crete, as well as the less
well known but ancestrally (and probably linguistically) similar
Cycladic and Early Helladic peoples. There are hints that there may have
been multiple waves of invaders from Anatolia, leaving at least Crete a
linguistically fragmented island. Reigning for at least 900 years, the
Cycladics, Early Helladics, and Minoans remained in close contact with
each other. Evidence of trade between the islands, mainland Greece,
western Anatolia, and Crete are abundant for that era.</p>

<h2 id="ie-invasion---3000-bce">IE invasion - 3000 BCE</h2>
<p>While the Minoans and their cousins enjoyed the bounties of Aegean Sea,
titanic events shaped the rest of the Europe. Around 3000 BC, a group of
savage tribes now known as the Indo-Europeans invaded Europe from
eastern Ukraine and southern Russia, destroying the EEF civilizations
east of the Rhine in at most two centuries. Not content with their new
lands, the Indo-Europeans learned how to build boats and launched a new
wave of bloody conquests 350-600 years later.</p>
<p>Two branches of the second Indo-European wave play a role in this story.
The first was was the early Greeks themselves, who arrived in northern
Greece (Macedonia and Thessaly) at the end of the 3rd millennium BC. The
other was the Sicanians, who settled the Balearic Islands and conquered
Sicily between 2400 and 2200 BC. While the language of Sicanians is
unknown, their ruling class was at least initially Indo-European in
origin.</p>
<h2 id="reinvasion-2300-bce">Reinvasion 2300 BCE</h2>
<p>The 23rd and 22nd centuries BC were another era of cataclysm, featuring
the falls of entire civilizations and great wanderings of peoples across
the world. Historical climate data shows a general trend of
aridification, which would have inflicted famines upon agricultural
societies. Tax revenues would have declined and the political order fell
apart. As far north as the Arctic the ancestors of the Saami (Lapps) and
Yukaghirs waged pitiless wars against their neighbors. In Karnataka in
southern India pastoral herders overran the native farmer society,
torching their settlements.+++(5)+++ Egypt fell into a dark age called the First
Intermediate Period that lasted 126 years. The mysterious Gutians
overthrew the mighty men of Akkad in modern-day Iraq. In the Yangtze
River Basin, the Liangzhu Civilization collapsed.</p>
<p>Greece was not spared that merciless period. As far south as the
Peloponnese archaeological sites were destroyed. On their ruins,
structures and artifacts such as tumuli burial mounds and shaft hole
axes characteristic of Indo-European peoples (of whom the Greeks came
from) were found.</p>
<p>Ancient DNA finds from the Elati-Logkas site in western Macedonia
confirm the identity of the invaders. The earliest known Greeks are
found in this site, and despite several centuries of time separating
them from the initial conquest, they were quite distinctive from their
predecessors. About 2/5ths of their ancestry came from the original
Indo-Europeans. Even more of their ancestry came from the subjects of
the Indo-Europeans further north, who by the time of the invasion had
mixed considerably with their conquerors.</p>

<h2 id="piracy-and-slavery">Piracy and slavery</h2>
<p>Thucydides writes that the Greeks of the centuries before the Trojan War
had no conception of national identity. Instead, they identified with
their tribes, some of them named in Homer’s epic poem “The Iliad”. Many
of these tribes worked as pirates, sailing around the seas and pillaging
unguarded villages that they found. Some of the Greeks continued that
lifestyle into Thucydides own time, though piracy was undoubtedly
interrupted by periods in which a regional naval hegemon secured the sea
lanes.</p>
<p>Greek pirates took more than plunder from their pirate voyages. The
Mycenaean city of Pylos has writings referencing women from western
Anatolia, possibly slaves. Sexual slavery in southeastern Europe
continued off and on well into the Middle Ages. The peoples of the
modern Balkans have much of their Slavic ancestry not through Slavic
invaders in the Dark Ages, but rather Slavic women slaves taken in the
Middle Ages.+++(4)+++</p>
<h2 id="minoan-end-1450-bce">Minoan end 1450 BCE</h2>
<p>The Minoans survived the late third millennium period of cataclysms,
with their island of Crete remaining in their hands for another seven
centuries. Minoan civilization was robust enough to survive even the
eruption of a volcano on the island of Thera and a related tsunami in
the 17th century BC. Some Minoan sites have layers over the Thera
eruption related ash layer, confirming that they did indeed survive the
second period of cataclysms.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, Minoan civilization was not to last. Mycenaean Greeks from
the mainland invaded Crete around 1450 BC, and set themselves up as the
new rulers. Contemporary Egyptian records from the tomb of Pharaoh
Thutmose III’s vizier Rekhmire reference visitors who ruled Crete as
well “Islands in the Midst of the Sea”, likely the Cycladic Islands of
Greece. Other Egyptian records reference Cretan ships and their
construction and maintenance.</p>
<h2 id="naval-order">Naval order</h2>
<p>Thucydides, writing in the 5th century BC, also references a powerful
historical ruler in Crete - Minos. He writes that Minos was first ruler
in the Aegean to build a powerful navy, and used his navy to conquer the
Cycladic Islands, end piracy, and allow for the expansion of trade. With
piracy gone, the people on the coasts began to settle cities,
consolidate their polities, and build walls. New settlements were built
on the Aegean coast of Anatolia as well, including Miletus.</p>
<p>Thucydides’ description of an expansion of trade and developed
settlements in the Aegean is supported by archaeology. The 15th and 14th
century Aegean saw the construction of numerous palaces as well as the
erection of Cyclopean walls (thought by the later Greeks to be the
creation of the mythical cyclopes). Greek pottery and artifacts were
found as far east as Mesopotamia (modern day Iraq) in this period.
Linear B, the earliest examples of Greek writing, also date starting
from the period.</p>

<h2 id="sicanians">Sicanians</h2>
<p>To the west, Sicily had been ruled by an Indo-European derived group
originating in Iberia since at least 2200 BC by the time of the
Mycenaean Greek expansion. Thucydides called these Indo-Europeans the
Sicanians, and states that they came from the Jucar River Basin (modern
Cuenca, Albacete and Valencia). The Sicanians still controlled part of
western Sicily as late as the 5th century BC. The practiced agriculture
and bronze working, and preferred trading to the east rather than the
west. They built their settlements in the open, indicated that warfare
was sparing rather than intensive.</p>
<p>This changed in the 17th century BC. The Mycenaean Greeks invaded Sicily
and made it their first overseas conquest. The island’s population
shrank dramatically, and settlements were built in defensible areas.
Mycenaean architecture and pottery replaced the old styles, and
Mycenaean Greeks settled the land. Trade was oriented even more to the
Aegean Sea and the world of the Mycenaean Greeks, though pottery from
the Apennine Mountains in Italy has also been found. The changes to
Sicily were not only architectural and economic, but genetic as well.
The Mycenaean Greeks settled the island with their Minoan and
Minoan-like subjects.</p>
<h2 id="classical-greek-genetics">Classical Greek genetics</h2>
<p>During their conquests abroad, the Mycenaean Greeks back home mixed in
with their subjects. By the time of Bronze Age Collapse of
around 1200 BC, the Greeks had perhaps a twentieth of their ancestry
from the original Indo-Europeans of the steppe, and two-thirds of their
ancestry came from their Minoan and Minoan-like predecessors.+++(4)+++ This
ancestry composition likely remained the norm for Greeks deep into the
Classical Era, if sample I8215 of the the 5th century BC Greek colony of
Empuries in Iberia is any indication. Modern Greeks may have as little
as half their ancestry from the Classical Greeks, although some
estimates put it at over two-thirds.</p>
<h2 id="hittite-embargo-1500-bce">Hittite embargo 1500 BCE</h2>
<p>The Mycenaean Greek conquests and expansion abroad left them with at
least a few enemies, some very powerful. The Hittites, based in central
Anatolia, enforced a trade embargo against the Greeks. Very few Greek
artifacts are found in the Hittite sites of this era, and very few
Hittite sites are found in Greek settlements. This embargo lasted for at
least three centuries, from the fifteenth to thirteenth centuries.</p>
<p>What sparked this embargo will likely remain shrouded in mystery. What
is known is that after the fall of Crete to the Mycenaeans, the Hittites
crushed a rebellion of a group called the Assuwa in western Anatolia
around 1430 BC. The Assuwa included the people of the city now known as
Troy - Wilusiya - remembered by Homer as “Ilios”. The Assuwa had some
contact with the Mycenaeans. Hittite texts reference Mycenaeans in
reference to the Assuwa, and a Mycenaean sword was found in Hittite
territory referencing the rebellion. From the Greek records, a reference
in the Iliad to Hercules sacking Troy may be a dim memory of this old
conflict fought long before the Trojan War.</p>
<p>A treaty signed around 1225 BC between the Hittites and their allies in
coastal Syria banned trade with “Ahhiyawa” - a word related to “Achaea”</p>
<ul>
<li>the land of the Achaeans referenced in the Iliad.</li>

<p>Trade embargos could greatly hurt the economy and revenues of a state.
While finances of the late Bronze Age eastern Mediterranean will never
be determined, the extent of trade was vast. Lapis lazuli from
Afghanistan, amber from the Baltic, and tin from Britain all made their
way to the eastern Mediterranean. One shipwreck from around 1300 BC
carried enough metal to outfit three hundred soldiers with a full set of
bronze armor and weapons.</p>
<h2 id="sea-power">Sea power</h2>
<p>Records from the Classical Era show how important trade was to the
revenues of a state. 1st century BC Rome obtained a third of her state
revenues from the customs of her international trade, mostly done by sea
through the Red Sea and Indian Ocean. This may have been even greater
for realms such as Mycenaean Greece, which would have found tax
collection difficult in the rocky terrain of Greece. While Mycenaean
Greek records are sparse, many Greek records from that period reference
the sea involve the recruitment of oarsmen - sailing was very labor
intensive, and oarsmen would have always been needed.</p>
<p>Even today, sea transport is cheaper than land transport. In the Bronze
and Classical Ages the advantage of sea transport was even more extreme.
There was no need for the construction of roads and tens of tons could
be transported long distances. Travel times by sea were considerably
less than those on land, and armies could be resupplied far away. Bronze
Age states with strong navies would have a tremendous advantage over
their rivals.</p>
<p>Sea power was undoubtedly the decisive factor in the success of the
Greeks in their late Bronze Age expansion. A campaign such as the Trojan
War could never have taken place without Greek naval supremacy, nor
could Greek colonies have been established in Sicily, Crete, and the
Levant without it. Sea power would also enable the greatest Greek
expansion prior to Alexander: the conquests of the Sea Peoples.</p>
<h2 id="philistines-and-co">Philistines and co</h2>
<p>One group of the Sea Peoples is well known - the Philistines. Having
failed to conquer Egypt in two invasions in 1207 and 1177 BC, they
instead returned to what they had previously conquered in what is now
modern day Israel. Identified in the Bible as originating from Crete,
the Philistines proceeded to settle down and intermarry with the locals.
DNA testing of Philistine remains has confirmed their Mycenaean Greek
origins.+++(5)+++ One Philistine woman who was DNA tested appears to be pure
Mycenaean in ancestry.</p>
<p>The Philistines (known to the Egyptians as the Peleset) were among
several groups listed as the Sea Peoples by the Egyptians. The other Sea
Peoples were the Tjekker, the Shekelesh, the Ekwesh, the Shardana, the
Danuna, and the Weshesh. An inscription on the tomb of Ramses III reads:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The foreign countries made a conspiracy in their islands. All at once
the lands were removed and scattered in the fray. No land could stand
before their arms, from Khatte, Qode, Carchemish, Arzawa, and Alashiya
on, being cut off at [one time]. A camp [was set up] in one place in
Amurru. They desolated its people, and its land was like that which has
never come into being. They were coming forward toward Egypt, while the
flame was prepared before them. Their confederation was the Peleset,
Tjekker, Shekelesh, Danuna, and Weshesh, lands united. They laid their
hands upon the lands as far as the circuit of the earth, their hearts
confident and trusting.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Arzawa is in western Anatolia, Khatte is the Hittite realm in central
Anatolia, Qode is Cilicia in modern southeastern Turkey, Carchemish was
a city on the banks of the Euphrates River, Amurru was an Egyptian
vassal in northern Lebanon and coastal Syria, and Alashiya is Cyprus.
The Danuna are the Greek tribe of Danaans referenced by Homer in “The
Iliad”. The ruins of the Hittite capital of Hattusa have been excavated,
and the destruction of the city was between 1190 and 1180 BC. In the
same decade, the city of Troy was destroyed as well, likely in what is
remembered as the Trojan War.+++(4)+++</p>
<p>The identity of the other groups is less certain. The Mycenaean Greeks
are known to have had contact with the EEF peoples of Sardinia - the
Nuragics - from pottery finds. The etymology of Sardinia’s name is
unknown, but the the name predates the arrival of the Phoenicians. The
Shardana referenced by the Egyptians as being among the Sea Peoples may
be Sardinians, Nuragics recruited by Mycenaean Greek sailors for
campaigns of plunder and conquest.+++(4)+++ The Sardinians certainly knew of the
wealth of the east - their copper, valuable in the Bronze Age as one of
the ingredients for bronze, originated from Cyprus.</p>
<p>Similarly, the name of the Shekelesh may refer to the aforementioned
Sicanians in Sicily. Alternatively, it could refer to the
Italic-speaking Sicels (relatives of the Romans) who invaded southern
Italy and Sicily in the late 13th or early 12th century during a massive
drought in their home, the Po River Basin of northern Italy.</p>
<p>The path of destruction the Egyptians describe is far from complete. In
addition to the places in Anatolia referenced in Ramses’ tomb,
archaeologists have uncovered numerous sites in the Levant (modern
Lebanon, Israel, and Syria) which were destroyed. The great port city of
Ugarit, near modern Latakia in Syria, was sacked in the decade preceding
the Sea Peoples 1177 BC invasion of Egypt. It was not the only Levantine
city sacked in that decade.</p>

<h2 id="drought-and-fights">Drought and fights</h2>
<p>The devastation reached Greece itself, as numerous cities were destroyed
or abandoned. Two terrible droughts devastated the eastern Mediterranean
and Ethiopia 1250-1150 BC and 1100-850 BC. Genetic finds from the Greek
colony of Empuries in the 1st millennium BC support a continuity of the
late Mycenaean Greek to Classical Greek ancestry composition, so if
there was an invasion of non-Greeks, it had little lasting effect. More
likely, a collapse in trade and a series of bad harvests drove the
Greeks to expand abroad. After meeting defeat at the hands of the
Egyptians, they turned on themselves, fighting for what little food and
farmland was left.</p>
<p>Thucydides describes a period of revolutions in Greece after the Trojan
War that forced the exile of many men. The Boeotians were driven out of
Thessaly and into Boeotia by the Thessalians, while further south the
Peloponnese was conquered by the Dorians and Heraclids. Homer describes
vicious feuds between returning Trojan War veterans and Greeks back home
as well. Some of the veterans won the feuds - Odysseus slaughters the
suitors of his wife Penelope with their lovers in The Odyssey. Other
times the veterans were defeated. Agamemnon was assassinated by his
unfaithful wife’s lover Aegisthus, who is in turn killed by Agamemnon’s
son Orestes years later.</p>

<h2 id="sicily">Sicily</h2>
<p>The Mycenaean Greek colony in Sicily collapsed after its motherland.
Thucydides, in his history, makes no mention of Greeks in Sicily prior
to the Phoenicians, and after 1000 BC. Invading Italic-speaking Sicels
from Italy may have destroyed them, or the Sicanians overthrew them. By
the time the Greeks colonized the island again, the memory of their
predecessors who had ruled parts of the island for centuries had been
forgotten.</p>
<h2 id="israel">Israel</h2>
<p>The Philistine colonists in modern day Israel lasted longer. They
continued to make their pots the way their Greek ancestors had made
them, although with local clays. They left little ancestry in the blood
of their successors. It is possible that they were always a small group,
and intermarried extensively with the locals, their blood diluted over
the centuries. It is also possible that as a military ruling caste they
bore the brunt of fighting in a dark age of drought and barbarism, only
dimly remembered in the Bible. Alternatively, they may have spent too
much of their time in disease ridden cities, reproducing at a lower rate
than the healthier countryside. The finally disappear from history after
the destruction of their realm by Babylon in the 6th century BC.</p>
<h2 id="greek-drought-ends-850-bce">Greek drought ends 850 BCE</h2>
<p>After the terrible droughts that caused the Bronze Age Collapse finally
ended in 850 BC, the Greeks resumed their seaborne colonization of the
Mediterranean, following the same winds that their Minoan and Mycenaean
ancestors had. Their need to hold their 227 islands required shipping
and sea power, giving them a great advantage over the land based powers
such as Persia, enabling such unlikely victories as Salamis. It gave
Athens the ability to ship armies across the sea to Sicily, as well as
grain from Crimea to feed the city even in famine. The sea power would
enable Alexander and his successors to dominate the eastern
Mediterranean for centuries, until the cousins of the Sicels, the
Romans, finally overcame them in a repetition of history.</p>

<h2 id="byzantium">Byzantium</h2>
<p>When the Romans passed, the Greek-speaking eastern half of the Roman
Empire, Byzantium, became the dominant sea power in the eastern
Mediterranean for centuries more. Defying the Arabs, Turks, Slavs, and
others successfully for centuries in part due to their naval power,
Byzantium was finally crippled by yet another group of Italians - the
Venetians leading the Fourth Crusade.</p>
<p>Since independence in the 19th century and again driven by their
geography, the Greeks have again become a sea people. They lead the
