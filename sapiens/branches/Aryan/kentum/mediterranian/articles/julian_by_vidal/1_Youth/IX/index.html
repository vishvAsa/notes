It was mid-October when I arrived in Milan. The weather was dry and the air so clear that one could see with perfect clarity those blue alps which separate civilization from barbarism, our world of sun from that melancholy green forest where dwells Rome’s nemesis.
Just before the city’s gate we were met by one of Constantius’s eunuchs, a gorgeous fellow with many chins and an effortless sneer. He did not salute me as is proper, a bad omen. He gave the commander of my guard a letter from the Emperor. When I saw this, I began to recite the first of the passwords I should need when I arrived in the kingdom of the dead. But I was not to be dispatched just yet. Instead I was taken to a house in one of the suburbs. Here I was imprisoned.">

  <p><em>Julian Augustus</em></p>
<p>It was mid-October when I arrived in Milan. The weather was dry and the air so clear that one could see with perfect clarity those blue alps which separate civilization from barbarism, our world of sun from that melancholy green forest where dwells Rome&rsquo;s nemesis.</p>
<p>Just before the city&rsquo;s gate we were met by one of Constantius&rsquo;s eunuchs, a gorgeous fellow with many chins and an effortless sneer. He did not salute me as is proper, a bad omen. He gave the commander of my guard a letter from the Emperor. When I saw this, I began to recite the first of the passwords I should need when I arrived in the kingdom of the dead. But I was not to be dispatched just yet. Instead I was taken to a house in one of the suburbs. Here I was imprisoned.</p>
<p>Imprisonment exactly describes my state. I was under heavy guard. During the day, I was allowed to stroll in the atrium. But at night I was locked in my bedroom. No one could visit me, not that there was anyone in Milan I wanted to see or who wanted to see me, excepting the Empress Eusebia. Of my household, I was allowed to keep only two boys and two men. The rest were transferred to the imperial palace. There was no one I could talk to. That was the greatest hardship of all. I should have been pleased to have had even a eunuch for company!</p>
<p>Why was I treated this way? I have since pieced the story together. While I was in Athens, a general named Silvanus was proclaimed Augustus in Gaul. I am convinced that at heart he was innocent of any serious desire to take the purple, but the enmity of the court eunuchs drove him to rebellion.</p>
<p>As soon as this happened, Constantius arrested me because he was afraid that I might take advantage of the defection of Gaul to rise against him in Attica. As it turned out, before I reached Milan, Silvanus was dead at Cologne. Constantius&rsquo; luck in civil war had proved itself again.</p>
<p>But the death of Silvanus did not solve the problem of Julian. While I was locked up in that suburban villa, the old debate was reopened. Eusebius wanted me put to death. Eusebia did not.</p>
<p>Constantius kept his own counsel.</p>
<p>I prepared several letters to Eusebia, begging her to intercede with the Emperor that I might be allowed to return to Athens. But I finally decided not to send her any message, for Constantius&rsquo;s suspicions were easily aroused, to say the least, and any exchange between his wife and his heir presumptive would not only be known to him but would doubtless turn him against both of us. I did the wise thing.</p>
<p>At dawn, on the thirteenth day of my captivity, my life altered forever. I was awakened by a slave banging on the bedroom door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get up, Lord! Get up! A message from the Augustus!&rdquo; Fully clothed, I leapt out of bed. I then reminded the slave that until someone unlocked the door I could hardly receive the imperial messenger.</p>
<p>The door flew open. The commander of my guard was beaming. I knew then that the divine will had begun its work. I was to be spared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A messenger, sir. The Emperor will receive you tonight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I stepped into the atrium and got my first taste of what it is like to be in favour. The house was now full of strangers. Fat eunuchs in gaudy silk; clerks from various government offices; tailors; sandalmakers; barbers; youthful officers drawn to what might be a new sun and source of honour. It was</p>
<p>dizzying.</p>
<p>The messenger from Constantius was no other than Arintheus, who serves with me now in Persia.</p>
<p>He is remarkably beautiful, and the army loves him in that fervent way armies have of loving handsome officers. He is auburn-haired and blue-eyed, with a strong, supple body. He is completely uneducated, but brave and shrewd in warfare. His only vice is an excessive fondness for boys, a practice I usually find unseemly in generals. But the men are amused by his sensuality. Also, he is a cavalry man and among cavalry men pederasty is a tradition. I must say that day when Arintheus approached me, blue eyes flashing and ruddy face grinning, I nearly mistook him for Hermes himself, streaming glory from Olympus as he came to save his unworthy son. Arintheus saluted me briskly; then he read aloud the letter summoning me for audience. When he had finished reading (with some difficulty, for he has never found reading easy), he put the message away, gave me his most winning smile and said, &ldquo;When you are Caesar, don&rsquo;t forget me. Take me with you. I prefer action.&rdquo; He patted his sword hilt. I dithered like a fool. He departed.</p>
<p>Then began a new struggle. My beard would have to go, also my student&rsquo;s clothes. I was now a prince, not a philosopher. So for the first time in my life my beard was shaved. It was like losing an arm.</p>
<p>Two barbers worked on me while I sat in a chair in the centre of the atrium as the mornirig sun shone on a spectacle which, looking back, was perfectly ludicrous. There was [, an awkward twenty-three-year-old philosophy student, late of the University of Athens, being turned into a courtier.</p>
<p>A slave girl trimmed my toenails and scrubbed my feet, to my embarrassment. Another worked on my hands, exclaiming at the inkiness of my fingers. The barber who shaved my beard also tried to shave my chest but I stopped him with an oath. We compromised by letting him trim the hair in my nostrils.</p>
<p>When he was finished, he brought me a mirror. I was quite unable to recognize the youth who stared wide-eyed from the polished metal—and it was a youth, not a man as I had thought, for the beard had been deceptive, giving me an undeserved look of wisdom and age. Without it, I resembled any other youngster at court.</p>
<p>I was then bathed, oiled, perfumed and elaborately dressed. My flesh shrank from the lascivious touch of silk, which makes the body uncomfortably aware of itself. Today I never wear silk, prefenting coarse linen or wool.</p>
<p>I have only a vague memory of the rest of that day. I was carried to the palace through crowded streets. The people stared at me curiously, uncertain whether or not it was right to applaud. I looked straight ahead as I had been instructed to do when on view. I tried not to hear conversations in the street. Desperately I tried to recall the eunuch&rsquo;s instructions.</p>
<p>At the edge of the city&rsquo;s main square the palace, grey and forbidding behind its Corinthian colonnade, rose before me like fate itself. Troops were drawn up in full dress on either side of the main door. When I stepped out of the litter, they saluted.</p>
<p>Several hundreds of the people of Milan drew close to examine me. In every city there is a special class whose only apparent function is to gather in public places and look at famous men. They are neither friendly nor unfriendly, merely interested. An elephant would have pleased them most, but since there was no elephant, the mysterious Prince Julian would have to do. Few of them could identify me.</p>
<p>None was certain just what relation I was to the Emperor. It is amazing how little we are known to our subjects. I know of places on the boundaries of the empire where they believe Augustus himself still reigns, that he is a great magician who may not die. Of course, the fact each of us calls himself Augustus is a deliberate attempt to suggest that the continuity of power emanating from Rome is the one constant in a world of flux. Yet even in the cities where there is widespread literacy, the average citizen is often uncertain about who the ruler is. Several times already I have been addressed as Constantius by nervous delegations, while one old man actually thought I was Constantine and complimented me on how little I</p>
<p>had changed since the battle at the Mulvian bridge!</p>
<p>Inside the palace, curiosity was mingled with excitement and anticipation. I was in favour. I read my good fortune in every face. In the vestibule they paid me homage. Heads bobbed; smiles flashed; my hand was wrung with warmth, kissed with hope. It was disgusting… in retrospect. At the time, it was marvellous proof that I was to live for a while longer.</p>
<p>I was delivered to the Master of the Offices, who gave me a final whispered briefing. Then, to the noise of horns, I entered the throne room.</p>
<p>Constantius wore the purple. The robe fell stiffly to his crimson shoes. In one hand he held an ivory staff, while the other rested on the arm of the throne, palm upward, holding the golden orb. As usual, he stared straight before him, unaware of anything except what was in his direct line of vision. He looked ill. His eyes were dark-circled, and his face was somewhat blotchy, as though from too much wine; yet he was abstemious. On a throne at floor level sat Eusebia, blazing with jewels. Though she too played statue, she managed to suggest sympathetic humanity. When she saw me, the sad mouth parted slightly.</p>
<p>To left and right, in full court dress, were the members of the Sacred Consistory. All stared at me as I slowly crossed to the throne, eyes downcast. October light streamed through high windows. The odour of incense was heavy in the room. I felt a child again, and this was Constantine. For a moment, the room swam before my eyes. Then Constantius spoke the first line of the ritual greeting. I answered, and prostrated myself at his feet. I kissed the purple, and was raised up. Like two actors we played our scene impersonally until it was done; then I was given a stool next to Eusebia.</p>
<p>I sat very still, looking straight ahead, aware of Eusebia next to me. I could smell the flowery scent of her robes. But neither of us looked at the other.</p>
<p>Ambassadors were received, generals appointed, titles bestowed. The audience ended when the Emperor stood up. The rest of us dropped to our knees. Stiff-legged and swaying slightly from the weight of his robes and jewellery, Constantius marched off to the palace living quarters, followed by Eusebia. The moment the green bronze doors shut behind them, as though from a magician&rsquo;s spell, we were all set free.</p>
<p>Courtiers surrounded me and asked a thousand questions: Would I be made Caesar? Where would I live? Did I need any service? I had only to command. I answered as demurely and non-committally as I could. Then my enemy Eusebius approached, his yellow moonface gravely respectful. Silk robes whispered as the heavy body bowed to me. &ldquo;Lord, you are to dine with the sacred family.&rdquo; An excited whisper went through the court. This was the highest recognition. I was exalted in all eyes. Though my own first reaction was: dinner means poison.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall escort you to the sacred quarters.&rdquo; Eusebius led me to the bronze doors through which the imperial couple had just passed. We did not speak until we were alone in the corridor beyond.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You should know, Lord, that I have always, in every way, assured the Augustus of your loyalty to him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know that you have.&rdquo; I lied with equal dignity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are those in the Sacred Consistory who are your enemies.&rdquo; He gestured for a guard to open a small oaken door. We passed through. &ldquo;But I have always opposed them. As you know, I had hoped all along that you would take your rightful place here at court. And though there are some who think that the title Caesar should lapse because your brother…&rdquo; He allowed that sentence to go unfinished. &ldquo;I have urged his Eternity to make you Caesar.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not seek such honour,&rdquo; I murmured, looking about me with some interest. The palace at Milan is a large rambling building. Originally it was a military governor&rsquo;s rather modest headquarters. In the last century when Rome ceased to be a practical centre for the West, the palace was enlarged to become an imperial residence. Because of the German tribes, the emperors had to be close to the Alps. Also, the</p>
<p>farther an emperor is from the city of Rome the longer his reign is apt to be, for the populace of that city is notoriously fickle and arrogant, with a long memory of the emperors it has overthrown. None of us stays for long at Rome if he can help it. Constantine enlarged the palace in Milan, building the state rooms, while Constantius added the second-floor living quarters through which we now walked. These rooms look out on a large inner court. I personally prefer the old-fashioned form of architecture with small private rooms arranged about an atrium, but Constantius was a modernist in architecture as well as in religion. I find such rooms too large, and of course ruinously expensive to heat.</p>
<p>Guards and eunuchs stood at every door, arrogant yet servile. A court is the most depressing place on earth. Wherever there is a throne, one may observe in rich detail every folly and wickedness of which man is capable, enamelled with manners and gilded with hypocrisy. I keep no court in the field. In residence, I keep as little as possible.</p>
<p>At the final door, Eusebius left me with a deep bow. Guards opened the door, and I stepped into the private dining room. Constantius reclined on one of the two couches within whose right angle was the table. Opposite him Eusebia sat in an ivory chair. I bowed low to both of them, intoning the proper formula. Constantius mumbled his response. Then he waved me to the couch beside him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You look better without that damned beard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I blushed as I took my place on the couch. Eusebia smiled encouragingly. &ldquo;I rather liked the beard,&rdquo;</p>
<p>she said.&ldquo;That&rsquo;s because you&rsquo;re an atheist, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>My heart missed a beat. But it was only the Emperor&rsquo;s heavy wit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She likes these high-sounding, low-living Cynics.&rdquo; He indicated his wife with a knotty ringed hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s always reading them. Not good for women to read.&rdquo; I said something agreeable, grateful to find him in a good mood. Constantius had removed his diadem and outer robes, and he looked almost human, quite unlike the statue he had appeared earlier.</p>
<p>Wine was brought me and though I seldom drink it full strength, this day I drank deep, to overcome nervousness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who does he look like?&rdquo; Constantius had been examining me curiously, like a new slave or horse.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Without that beard?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eusebia frowned, pretending to be thoughtful. One gives away nothing in dealing with a tyrant, even if the tyrant is one&rsquo;s husband.</p>
<p>The Emperor answered his own question, &ldquo;Constans. You look just like him. Just like my brother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>My heart sank. Constantius had always been thought to have had a hand in his brother&rsquo;s death. But there was no significance to this remark, either. Constantius, at his ease, tended to be literal and rather simple.</p>
<p>I said that I had been too young to recall what my late cousin had looked like.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Much the best of the three of us. Tall. Like our father.&rdquo; Constantius was much concerned with his own shortness.</p>
<p>An elaborate dinner was served us, and I tasted everything, for to refuse any dish would show that one suspected the Emperor of treachery. It was an ordeal, and my stomach nearly rebelled. Constantius led the conversation, as emperors are supposed to do—unless they are given to philosophic debate like me, in which case I must speak very fast at my own table to be heard.</p>
<p>I was asked about my studies at Athens. I described them, ending &ldquo;I could spend the rest of my life there.&rdquo; As I said this, I noticed that Eusebia frowned imperceptibly: a signal that I was not to speak of student life.</p>
<p>But Constantius had not been listening. He lay now flat on his back, belching softly and kneading his barrel-like stomach with one hand. When he spoke, he did so with eyes shut.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am the first Augustus to reign alone since my father, who was himself the first to reign alone in this century. But he never intended for just one of us to rule. Any more than Diocletian intended for any</p>
<p>one of <em>his</em> successors to govern alone.&rdquo; Constantius raised himself on one elbow and looked at me with those curiously mournful eyes which were his most attractive yet most puzzling feature. They were the eyes of a poet who had seen all the tragedy in this world and knows what is to come in the next. Yet the good effect of those eyes was entirely undone by a peevish mouth.</p>
<p>Who could ever know Constantius? I certainly did not. I hated him, but Eusebia loved him—I think</p>
<p>—and she was a woman who would not have cared for what was evil. Like the rest of us, Constantius was many men in the body of one.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The world is too big for one person to govern it.&rdquo; My heart beat faster for I knew now what was to come. &ldquo;I cannot be everywhere. Yet the imperial power <em>must</em> be everywhere. Things have a habit of going wrong all at once. As soon as the German tribes get loose in the north, the Persians attack in the south.</p>
<p>At times I think they must plan it. If I march to the East, I&rsquo;m immediately threatened in the West. If one general rises up against me, then I must deal with at least two more traitors at the same time. The empire is big. Distances are great. Our enemies many.&rdquo; He tore off a roast duck&rsquo;s leg and chewed it, all the time looking at me with those melting eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I mean to hold the state together. I shall not sacrifice one city to the barbarians, one town, one field!&rdquo; The high-pitched voice almost cracked. &ldquo;I mean to hold the state for our family. We won it. We must maintain it. And that is why we must be loyal to one another.&rdquo; How that phrase from those cruel lips struck me! I dared not look at him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Julian,&rdquo; the voice was lower now. &ldquo;I intend to make you Caesar, and my heir until such time as I have a son.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lord…&rdquo; was all I could say. Tears unexpectedly filled my eyes. I shall never know if I <em>wanted</em> my fate.</p>
<p>Yet when it came to me, a secret line snapped within and the perilous voyage began. Eusebia congratulated me. I don&rsquo;t recall what was said. More wine was brought and Constantius, in a jovial mood, told me how the astrologists preferred 6 November to any other day in the month. He also insisted that I study military strategy, while assembling a household suitable to my new rank. I was to have a salary. It would not be large, he said, understating the matter considerably: if I had not had a small income from my mother&rsquo;s estate, I would have starved to death that first year. My cousin could never be accused of generosity.</p>
<p>Constantius almost smiled at me. &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I have a surprise for you.&rdquo; The surprise was his sister Helena. She entered the room with great dignity. I had never met her, though I had seen her at a distance during my first visit to Milan. Helena was not an attractive woman. She was short, inclined to stoutness, with the short legs and long torso of Constantius. By one of those unlucky chances, her face was the face of her father Constantine the Great. It was most alarming: the same broad cheeks, the thin proud mouth, the large nose, the huge full jaw, an imperial portrait re-created in a middle-aged woman.</p>
<p>Yet despite this unfortunate resemblance, she was otherwise most feminine with an agreeable soft voice.</p>
<p>(I have always hated women with shrill voices.) She moved modestly, even shyly. At the time I knew nothing about her except that she was ten years older than I, and that she was Constantius&rsquo;s favourite sister.</p>
<p>After formally acknowledging our greetings, Helena took her place in the vacant chair. She was obviously under considerable strain. So was I, for I knew exactly what was going to happen next. I had always known that something like this was apt to be my fate, but I had put it as much as possible out of my mind. Now the moment was at hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We do you the honour,&rdquo; said Constantius, &ldquo;of bestowing our own beloved sister upon you as your wife and consort, a human and tangible link between our crowns.&rdquo; He had obviously prepared this sentence in advance. I wondered if he had spoken thus to Gallus when he gave him Constantia in marriage.</p>
<p>Helena looked at the floor. I am afraid I turned scarlet. Eusebia watched me, amused but guarded.</p>
<p>She who had been my friend and ally could now quite easily become my enemy. I was aware of this, even then. Or do I write now with hindsight? In any case, it was perfectly plain that should Helena have a child and Eusebia remain barren, my child would be Constantius&rsquo;s heir. The four of us were now caught like flies in a spider&rsquo;s web.</p>
<p>I had no clear idea what I said to Constantius. I am sure that I stammered. Helena later said that I was most eloquent, though unable to look at her during my speech of acceptance. Doubtless I was thinking of my conjugal duties. Never did a woman attract me less. Yet we would have to have a child.</p>
<p>This sort of burden is the usual fate of princes and I daresay it is a small price to pay for greatness, though at the time it seems larger than it ought.</p>
<p>Helena was a good woman but our moments of intimacy were rare, unsatisfactory, and somewhat pathetic, for I did want to please her. But it was never pleasant, making love to a bust of Constantine.</p>
<p>Though I could not make her happy, I did not make her suffer, and I think we became friends.</p>
<p>The dinner ended when Constantius swung his short bowed legs to the floor, and stretched till his bones cracked. Then without a word to any of us, he left the room. Eusebia gave me a half-smile. She put her hand out to Helena and together the two women withdrew, leaving me staring at the pheasant&rsquo;s eggs which an artistcook had arranged in a beautifully leathered nest as final course. It was an extraordinary moment. I had entered the room a proscribed student. I left it as Caesar and husband. The change was dizzying.</p>
<p>• • •
I believe it is true of most courts that the principal figures seldom see one another. This is partly due to choice. The fewer the meetings, the less chance of something untoward happening. But more to the point, it suits the courtiers to keep the great people apart, thereby increasing the importance of intermediaries who are then able to hurry from one wing of the palace to another, making mischief and policy as they go.</p>
<p>The court of Constantius was in many ways the worst since Domitian. The eunuchs were all-powerful. They kept everyone from the Emperor. If a man displeased a eunuch, he was doomed and Mercurius, &ldquo;the count of dreams&rdquo;, would be called in or Paul &ldquo;the chain&rdquo; (the one so called because he was a genius at finding obscure links to a never-ending chain of treason while the other specialized in the analysis of seemingly harmless dreams which, invariably, upon scrutiny, revealed treasonable intent).</p>
<p>Since Constantius would listen only to the eunuchs, injustice flourished. No one was safe, including the great figures themselves, particularly those like myself who were blood heirs to the principate.</p>
<p>I have often felt when studying history that not enough is made of the importance of those intermediaries who so often do the actual governing. We tend to think of courts as wheels at whose centre is the emperor, from whom, like spokes, all those who serve him extend, drawing their power directly from his central presence. The truth is otherwise. Hardly anyone was allowed to come close to Constantius. Only the eunuch Eusebius saw him daily. As a result, factions within the court could form and re-form, irrelevant to the nominal power.</p>
<p>In reading accounts of those weeks at Milan, one would think that Constantius and I saw each other daily, discussing high policy, military strategy and sharing, as it were, a family life. Actually, I saw the Emperor only four times in one month. The first encounter I have described; the second was at my investiture as Caesar.</p>
<p>I was created Caesar 6 November 355, the year when Arbetio and Lollianus were consuls. I will say one thing for Constantius. He had an artist&rsquo;s gift for ceremony. Though I like to think I surpass him in many ways, I know I shall never be able to create the sense of awful majesty he could whenever he chose.</p>
<p>One knew this was the Augustus when he appeared before a crowd. When I appear, the people are not</p>
<p>in the least impressed. I believe they have a certain affection for me, but I don&rsquo;t in the least alarm them.</p>
<p>They think I look like a professor of rhetoric. They are quite right. I do.</p>
<p>At the far end of the main square, a high wooden platform had been decorated with the eagles of Rome and the dragons of our house. The square itself was filled with soldiers in full military dress.</p>
<p>As I was led by the generals of the army to the platform, I was conscious that every muscle in my body ached, for I had been practising daily with sword and javelin. I was exhausted, and I&rsquo;m afraid that my instructors had nothing but contempt for me. They thought me a bookish fool who knew nothing of weaponry and preferred talk to war. Of course they were courteous to my face, but behind my back I often heard soft mocking laughter. Incidentally, I was surprised to discover how little I can endure mockery. One of the best consolations of philosophy is that it supposedly prepares one for the contempt of others. Some philosophers even revel in the dislike of the vulgar. Not I. Perhaps there is something to the idea of blood and inheritance. After all, I am descended from three emperors. To be thought weak and womanish by hearty young officers was unbearable to me. Grimly, I made up my mind to surpass them in every way. Unfortunately, at this moment my primacy was more wish than fact. I had done too much too fast. As a result, I was even clumsier than usual.</p>
<p>The moment I reached the base of the platform, horns were sounded. Cheering began, A path opened through the legions, and Constantius appeared in his gilded state carriage; he wore a dragonshaped gold helmet and the purple. As he passed me, I caught his eye and got a look as blind as Homer&rsquo;s! In public, the emperor does not see mere men.</p>
<p>Slowly Constantius climbed the steps to the platform, his short bowed legs slightly diminishing the majesty of his presence. From the platform, he received the cheer of the legions. Then he motioned for me to join him. With a sense of one going to his own execution, I climbed the steep wooden steps and took my place at the side of Constantius… I almost wrote at the side of history, for I was now legend.</p>
<p>For better or worse, I had become a part of that long chronicle which began with Julius Caesar and whose end none can foresee.</p>
<p>I looked out over the massed troops. This was my first look at an army, and I confess to revelling in the sight. All thought of philosophy went clear out of my head as the dragon pennants fluttered in the autumn wind, and the eagles below us dipped as the salute was given.</p>
<p>Constantius reached out and took my right hand in his. His grip was firm and callused. I glanced at him out of the corner of my eye, conscious something was not right: he was half a head taller than I. I looked down and saw that he was standing on a footstool. Constantius neglected no detail which might enhance his majesty. Constantius spoke to the legions. His high-pitched voice carried well. The Latin he used was that of the army, but it was easy to understand. He had memorized his speech. &ldquo;We stand before you, valiant defenders of our country, to avenge the common cause.</p>
<p>How this is to be done, I put to you not as soldiers but as impartial judges. After the death of those rebellious tyrants whom mad fury drove to seize the state, the savages to the north, thinking that this great empire was weak and in confusion, crossed into Gaul. They are there now. Only you and we, in perfect accord, can turn them back. The choice is yours. Here stands before you our cousin Julian, honoured for his modesty, as dear to us for that as for the ties of blood; a young man of conspicuous ability whom I desire to make Caesar if you will confirm him…&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this point, though in mid-sentence, Constantius was stopped by various voices declaring that it was clearly the will of God, not of man, that I be raised to the rank of Caesar. I quite agreed, though the God they had in mind and the One who did indeed raise me up were not the same. Nevertheless, I admired the skill with which Constantius had staged the scene. The voices rang out as though spontaneous (actually, everything had been carefully rehearsed). Constantius remained very still while they spoke, as though listening to an oracle. My hand in his grew sweaty; but he never relaxed the firm</p>
<p>grip. When there was silence again, he nodded gravely to the legions. &ldquo;Your response is enough. I see that I have your approval.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He let go my hand. He motioned for two generals to join us on the platform. One carried a wreath; the other a purple robe. They stood behind us.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This young man&rsquo;s quiet strength and temperate behaviour&rdquo; (he emphasized the word &ldquo;temperate&rdquo; to reassure them that I was not Gallus) &ldquo;should be imitated rather than proclaimed; his excellent disposition, trained in all good arts, I concur in by the very fact that I have chosen to elevate him. So now with the immediate fayour of the God of heaven, I invest him with this imperial robe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The cloak was put about my shoulders. Constantius arranged it at the neck. Only once did he look me in the eye as we faced one another, he on his footstool and I with my back to the legions. The look he gave me was curiously furtive and undecided, in sharp contrast to the easy majesty of his movements and the serene power of his voice.</p>
<p>Constantius was a man in terror of his life. I saw it plain in those great eyes. As he put the wreath on my head, he shut his eyes for an instant, like a man who flinches in anticipation of a surgeon&rsquo;s knife.</p>
<p>Then he took my right hand again and turned me around that I might face the legions. But before they could salute me, he raised his arm. He had more to say. Though he spoke as though to me, he looked straight at them. Not certain which way to turn, I looked half at him and half towards the soldiers in the square.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Brother, dearest to me of all men, you have received in your prime the glorious flower of your origin. Yet I must admit you add to my own glory, for I seem to myself more truly great in bestowing almost equal power&rdquo; (the &ldquo;almost&rdquo; was heavily rendered) &ldquo;on a noble prince who is my kinsman than through that power itself. Come, then, to share in pain and perils, undertake the defence of Gaul, relieve its afflicted regions with every bounty. And should it be necessary to engage with the enemy, take your place with the standard-bearers. Go forth yourself, a brave man ready to lead men equally brave. You and I will stand by one another with firm and steadfast affection, and together—if God grants our prayers—we shall rule over a pacified world with moderation and conscientiousness. You will be present with me always in my thoughts, and I will not fail you in anything you undertake. Now go, with haste, with the prayers of all of us, to defend with your honour the post assigned you by Rome herself, and God&rsquo;s appointment! Hail, Caesar!&rdquo;</p>
<p>This last he said in a loud voice which was immediately echoed by the legions. It was like a burst of thunder. I had sufftcient presence of mind to respond: &ldquo;Hail, Augustus!&rdquo; The men repeated this, too. I saluted Constantius. Then I turned and saluted the legions. This was against all protocol. Generals do not salute their men. The standards, yes; the legions, no. But my gesture was sincerely tactless. After the first astonishment, the legions roared their approval of me and struck their shields hard against their arrnoured knees: the highest tribute they may render a man. It is also the loudest. I thought I would be deaf forever as the clatter rang through the square. More terrible, however, is the army&rsquo;s disapproval, when they roll their spears back and forth against their shields, as prelude to mutiny.</p>
<p>I could feel Constanfius stiffen beside me. This was more than he anticipated. I am sure that he was positive that my gesture to the legions had been premeditated. But the deed was done. And I was Caesar.</p>
<p>Abruptly, Constantius left the platform. I followed him. There was a moment of confusion as he got into his carriage. He looked down at me for a long moment. Then he motioned for me to join him. I clambered in beside him and, side by side, we rode through the cheering legions. I felt a sudden affection for them all. We had been united as though in marriage, and like so many arranged marriages, odd though this one was, it proved to be happy. The carriage moved slowly through the square to the palace.</p>
<p>Constantius said nothing to me, and I dared not speak to him, unhappily aware that in this carriage there was no footstool and I was taller than he, a second bad omen. I murmured to myself a line from the</p>
<p>Iliad: &ldquo;By purple death I&rsquo;m seized, and fate supreme.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Inside the palace courtyard Constantius and I parted without a word. I did not see him again for several days.</p>
<p>• • •
My first act as Caesar was to send for Oribasius, who was at Athens. He had arrived there only a week after my recall. I also wrote Maximus and Priscus, inviting them to join me. Meanwhile, I continued military practice. I also learned as much as possible about the administration of Gaul.</p>
<p>During this time I saw none of the imperial family, including my soon-to-be wife. Yet the day of the wedding had been set and the inevitable documents were brought to me to be studied. I was given a meticulous ground plan of the chapel and my position from moment to moment during the ceremony was precisely traced.</p>
<p>I had but one friend at court, Eutherius, the Armenian eunuch who had taught me at Constantinople. Every evening we would study various documents and memoranda. It was his task, he said, to make an administrator of me.</p>
<p>The night before my wedding, Eutherius came to me with the news that I was to leave for Gaul the first week in December.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To what city?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Vienne. You&rsquo;ll be there for the winter. Then in the spring you will take the field.&rdquo; He looked at me closely. &ldquo;Does it seem strange to you to be a general?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Strange!&rdquo; I exploded. &ldquo;Insane!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He raised his hand in some alarm, indicating the shadows where guards stood and informers listened, always hopeful of catching me at treason.</p>
<p>I lowered my voice. &ldquo;Of course it is strange. I&rsquo;ve never seen a battle. I&rsquo;ve never commanded a single soldier, much less an army. But…&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But l&rsquo;m not afraid.&rdquo; I did not say what I really felt: that I looked forward to military adventures.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am relieved.&rdquo; Eutherius smiled. &ldquo;Because I have just been appointed grand chamberlain at the court of the Caesar Julian. I go with you to Gaul.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was marvellous news. I embraced him warmly, babbling happily until he was forced to say,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Roman gravity, Caesar. Please. You are far too Asiatic.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I laughed. &ldquo;It can&rsquo;t be helped, I <em>am</em> Asiatic…&rdquo;</p>
<p>Suddenly, Eutherius was on his feet. With a speed which I would not have thought possible for one of his age, he darted into the shadowed archway just opposite us. A moment later he reappeared with a dark, richly dressed man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Caesar,&rdquo; said Eutherius with grim ceremony, &ldquo;allow me to present Paul, of the. secret service. He has come to pay your greatness homage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I was hardly startled. I had been under surveillance all my life. The presence of the government&rsquo;s chief secret agent merely reminded me that the higher I rose the more important it was for Constantius to have me watched.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are always pleased to receive the Emperor&rsquo;s agents,&rdquo; I said politely.</p>
<p>Paul was imperturbable. His eyes shone in the lamplight; his hook nose made him resemble some great bird of prey. He bowed. He spoke with a slight Spanish accent. &ldquo;I was on my way to the east wing.</p>
<p>To report to Rufinus, the praetorian prefect.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is not the usual way to the east wing,&rdquo; said Eutherius amiably.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What can I say?&rdquo; Paul spread his hands, bird&rsquo;s talons ready to seize.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You <em>can</em> say good night, Paul, and report to the praetorian prefect that you heard nothing useful,&rdquo; I said. Paul bowed. &ldquo;I report only what I hear, Caesar.&rdquo; He was carefully insolent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stay longer,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;and you will hear the beginning of your death.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That shook him, though my boldness was perfect bluff. I had no power. One word from him and I could be brought down. Yet I knew that if I was to be Caesar I would have to assert myself or earn the fatal contempt of eunuchs and spies. Paul withdrew. I turned to Eutherius. &ldquo;Was I too Asiatic?&rdquo; I teased him, though my heart pounded.</p>
<p>He shook his head. &ldquo;Perhaps that is the wisest way to handle him. Anyway, you are safe for the moment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But he is constructing one of his chains.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps he will trap himself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I nodded. Paul had been a prime mover in the plot which had destroyed my brother. That night in the palace at Milan I began my own plot.</p>
<p>• • •
My wedding day… what a strange thing for a celibate to write! It seems impossible now that I could ever have been a husband. Yet I became one on 13 November 355. I shall not describe the atrocious Galilean rites. It is enough to say that I endured them, heavy with purple and glittering with state jewels which I later sold in Gaul to buy soldiers.</p>
<p>After the ceremony, there were the usual celebrations and games in our honour. Helena delighted in all the panoply of rank; in this she resembled her brother. I was merely dutiful and did what was expected of me. A few days after the ceremony I was summoned to an audience with Eusebia.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you think of the world now?&rdquo; Eusebia&rsquo;s eyes gleamed with mischief.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I owe it all to you,&rdquo; I said warmly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And how do you find Helena?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She is my wife,&rdquo; I said formally; again the conspiratorial look.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She is very… handsome,&rdquo; said Eusebia, with an edge of malice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Noble, I should say.&rdquo; I almost burst out laughing. But there is a rule to these games.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will leave soon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad,&rdquo; I said. Then added, &ldquo;Not that I look forward to leaving…&rdquo; I could not say &ldquo;you&rdquo; so I said</p>
<p>&ldquo;Milan&rdquo;.</p>
<p>She shook her head. &ldquo;This is not your sort of place. It&rsquo;s not mine either, but…&rdquo; She left what was serious unsaid. Then:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will go into winter quarters at Vienne. Money…&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will be scarce.&rdquo; The Grand Chamberlain had already told me that I would have to maintain myself and household on my salary as Caesar. Additional funds could not be granted at this time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Luckily, you are frugal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Helena is not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Helena has her own money,&rdquo; said Eusebia sharply. &ldquo;She should use it. She owns half of Rome.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I was relieved to hear this, and said so.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is my hope,&rdquo; said Eusebia, &ldquo;that you will soon have a son, not only for yourself but for us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I admired her boldness. This was the one thing Eusebia did <em>not</em> want me to have, since it would endanger her own position. Rather than accept my son as his heir, Constantius was capable of divorcing Eusebia and taking a new wife who could give him what he most desired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is my hope,&rdquo; I answered evenly, &ldquo;that <em>you</em> will be blessed with many children.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But she did not believe me either. The interview now turned painful. No matter what either of us said, it sounded false. Yet I believe she did indeed wish me well, except in that one matter. Finally, we got off the subiect and she revealed to me the state of Constantius&rsquo;s mind. &ldquo;I speak to you candidly.&rdquo; An admission that neither of us had been speaking candidly before. The sad face looked sadder still, while her long hands nervously fingered the folds of her robe. &ldquo;He is divided. He cannot make up his mind about you. Naturally, there are those who tell him that you wish to overthrow him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not true!&rdquo; I began to protest, but she stopped me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know it is not true.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And it <em>never</em> will be true!&rdquo; I believed myself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be tolerant. Constantius has had to face many enemies. It is only natural that he fear you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then why won&rsquo;t he let me go back to Athens, where I am no danger?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because he needs you more than he fears you.&rdquo; She looked at me, suddenly frightened. &ldquo;Julian, we are in danger of losing all Gaul.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I stared at her dumbly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This morning Constantius had a message from the praetorian prefect at Vienne. I don&rsquo;t know what it said. But I suspect the worst. We have already lost the cities of the Rhine. Should the Germans attack this winter, it is the end of Gaul, unless…&rdquo; She held her hand above the flame of the alabaster lamp. The flesh glowed. &ldquo;Julian, help me!&rdquo; For a stupid moment I thought she had burned her hand. &ldquo;You <em>must</em> be loyal to us. You must help us!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I swear by all the gods, by Helios, by…&rdquo;</p>
<p>She stopped me, unaware that in my sincerity I had sworn by the true gods. &ldquo;Be patient with him. He will always be suspicious of you. That is his nature. But as long as I live, you are safe. If something should happen to me…&rdquo; This was the first inkling I had that Eusebia was ill. &ldquo;Be loyal to him anyway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I forget what I said. Doubtless more protestations of loyalty, all sincere. When I rose to go, she said,</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have a gift for you. You will see it on the day you leave.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I thanked her and left. Despite all that Eusebia did to hurt me in the next two years, I still love her.</p>
<p>After all I owe her not only the principate but my life.</p>
<p>• • •
At dawn on the first of December I left Milan for Gaul. I said farewell to Helena, who was to join me later at Vienne. We both behaved according to the special protocol the eunuchs have devised governing a Caesar&rsquo;s farewell to his new wife as he goes to a beleaguered province. Then, accompanied by the newly arrived Oribasius, I went down to the courtyard of the palace to place myself at the head of my army.</p>
<p>Outside in the frosty air, some three hundred foot soldiers and a score of cavalry were drawn up. I took this to be my personal bodyguard. I was about to ask the whereabouts of the army of Gaul when I was joined by Eutherius. He was frowning. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve just spoken to the Grand Chamberlain. There has been a last-minute change in plans. Your legions have been assigned to the Danube.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I indicated the men in the courtyard. &ldquo;Is <em>this</em> my army?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am afraid so, Caesar.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I have never in my life been so angry. Only the arrival of Constantius prevented me from saying the unsayable. I saluted the Emperor; gravely, he returned the salute. Then he mounted a black horse and I mounted a white one. His personal guard (twice the size of my &ldquo;army&rdquo;) fell into place behind him. My troops and household brought up the rear. Thus the Augustus and his Caesar launched the power of Rome against the barbarians. It was ludicrous.</p>
<p>The few citizens who were up and around at this hour cheered us dutifully. We made a particularly fine impression at the vegetable market which is just inside the city gate. The farm women waved their carrots and turnips at us, and thought us a brave sight.</p>
<p>Neither Constantius nor I spoke until we were out on the main road, the high Alps visible to us across the Lombard Plain. He had agreed to escort me as far as the two columns which stand on either side of the road midway between Lumello and Pavia. He had obviously decided this would give us sufficient time for a good talk. It did.</p>
<p>Constantius began with, &ldquo;We have great confidence in Florentius, our praetorian prefect at Gaul.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was an announcement; there was no invitation for me to comment.</p>
<p>Of course he has confidence in Florentius, I thought savagely, otherwise he would have had him murdered by now. But I said,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Augustus.&rdquo; And waited. We rode a few more yards. Occasionally, our armoured legs touched, metal striking metal, and each would shrink instinctively from the other. The touch of another man has always disturbed me; the touch of my father&rsquo;s murderer alarmed me.</p>
<p>We passed a number of carts containing poultry; they had pulled off the road at our approach. When the peasants saw the Emperor, they fell fiat on their bellies, as though blinded by the sight of that sacred figure. Constantius ignored them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are fond of our sister Helena.&rdquo; This was also launched upon the dry cool air in an oracular tone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She is dear to me, too, Augustus,&rdquo; I replied. I was afraid he was going to lecture me on my marital duties, but he made no further mention of Helena.</p>
<p>Constantius was constructing a case. His occasional fiat sentences, suitable for carving in marble, were all part of an edifice created to contain me. I was to obey the praetorian prefect of Gaul, even though as Caesar I was his superior. I was to remember that Helena&rsquo;s first loyalty was to her brother and ruler, not to her husbafid. So far, I understood him clearly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have heard from your military instructor that you show promise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall not fail you, Augustus. But it was my understanding that I was to go to Gaul with an army, not an escort.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Constantius ignored this. &ldquo;You have come to soldiering late. I hope you are able to learn what you will need to know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was not optimistic, but not unnatural. There was no reason for anyone to suspect that a philosophy student should show any talent for war. Curiously enough, I had every confidence in myself because I knew that the gods would not desert me now they had raised me up. But my cousin had no way of knowing my feelings, or judging my capacity. He merely saw a young untried soldier about to go into battle against the fiercest fighters in the world.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At all times remember that we are divine in the eyes of the people and sacred to heaven.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I took the &ldquo;we&rdquo; to mean Constantius and myself, though he may have been merely reminding me of his own rank. &ldquo;I shall remember, Augustus.&rdquo; I always called him by his proper title, though he much preferred Lord, a title I despise and do not use for it means that one is the master of other men, rather than simply first among them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Control your generals.&rdquo; Though he still sounded as if he were repeating maxims, I could tell that now he was on the verge of actual advice, if not conversation. &ldquo;No officer should be admitted to senatorial rank. All officers must be under strict civilian control. Any governor of any province outranks any general sent to him. No officer must be allowed to take part in civil affairs. Our praetorian prefects are set over all military and civil officials. That is why the administration of the empire runs as smoothly as it</p>
<p>Needless to say, I did not remark that the collapse of Gaul was hardly a sign of smooth</p>
<p>administration. But in principle Constantius&rsquo;s advice was good and I tend still to follow it. There is no denying that he had a gift for administration.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In matters of taxes, take whatever is owing us. Show no mercy to the cities and villages which are delinquent in meeting payments. It is their nature to complain. Assume that your taxgatherers are honest unless proved otherwise. They are never honest, but no one has yet found a way to correct their abuses.</p>
<p>As long as they return to you the larger part of what they collect, be satisfied.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I was later to revise the system of taxation in Gaul, disproving everything he said. But all that in its proper place.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Control the generals.&rdquo; He repeated this suddenly as if he&rsquo;d forgotten he had already said it to me.</p>
<p>Then he turned and looked at me for the first time that day. It was startling. No longer was he the sun god on his charger. This was my cousin, my enemy, my lord, source of my greatness and potential source of my death.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must know what I mean,&rdquo; he said, sounding like a man, not an oracle. &ldquo;You have seen the state disrupted. Our high place threatened. Provinces wrecked. Cities destroyed. Armies wasted. The barbarians seizing our lands, because we were too busy fighting one another to protect ourselves from the true enemy. Well, Caesar, remember this: allow no general sufficient power to raise an army against you. You have seen what I have had to suffer. Usurper after usurper has wasted our power. Be on your guard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will, Augustus.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then he said, very slowly, his eyes on mine, &ldquo;As I am on <em>my</em> guard.&rdquo; He looked away when he saw that his meaning was quite clear. Then he added for good measure, &ldquo;We have never yet lost so much as a foot of earth to any usurper, nor will we ever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As long as I live, Augustus, you shall have at least one arm to fight for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We rode until midday. Then at the two columns we stopped. It was a fine brisk noon and, despite the chill in the air, the sun was hot and we were all sweating under our armour. A halt was ordered.</p>
<p>Constantius and I dismounted and he motioned for me to accompany him into a hard stubbled field.</p>
<p>Except for our troops, no one was in sight. In every country peasants vanish when they see armed men coming: all soldiers are the enemy. I wish one could change that.</p>
<p>Constantius walked ahead of me towards a small ruined shrine to Hermes which stood at the edge of the field (a favourable omen, Hermes has always watched over me). Behind us, our men watered horses, rearranged armour, swore and chattered, pleased by the good weather. Just as Constantius entered the shrine, I broke a dead flower off its stalk. Then I followed him inside the shrine, which smelled of human excrement. Constantius was urinating on the floor. Even in this, he was grave and majestic.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a pity,&rdquo; I heard myself saying, aware as I spoke that I was breaking protocol, &ldquo;what has happened to these old temples.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A pity? They should all be torn down.&rdquo; He rearranged his clothes. &ldquo;I hate the sight of them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; I muttered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall leave you here,&rdquo; he said. We stood facing one another. Though I deliberately stooped, I could not help but look down on him. He edged away from me, instinctively searching for higher ground.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whatever you need, you shall have. Call on me. Also, depend on our praetorian prefect. He represents us. You will find the legions of Vienne alert, ready for a spring campaign. So prepare yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He handed me a thick document. &ldquo;Instructions. To be read at your leisure.&rdquo; He paused. Then he remembered something. &ldquo;The Empress has made you a gift. It is with your baggage. A library, I believe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I was effusive in my gratitude. I said words but Constantius did not listen. He moved to the door. He</p>
<p>paused; he turned; he tried to speak to me. I blushed. I wanted to reach out and take his hand and tell him not to fear me, but I did not dare. Neither of us was ever able to face the other.</p>
<p>When Constantius finally spoke, his voice broke with tension.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If this should come to you…&rdquo; Awkwardly he gestured at himself to indicate the principate of the world. &ldquo;Remember…&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then his voice stopped as if a strangler&rsquo;s thumb had blocked the windpipe. He could not go on.</p>
<p>Words had failed him again, and me.</p>
<p>I have often wondered what it was he meant to say; what it was I should remember. That life is short?</p>
<p>Dominion bitter? No.</p>
<p>Constantius was not a profound man. I doubt if he had been about to offer me any startling insight.</p>
<p>But as I think back on that scene in the ruined shrine (and I think of it often, I even dream of it), I suspect that all he meant to say was, &ldquo;Remember me.&rdquo; If that is what you meant, cousin, then I have, in every sense, remembered you.</p>
<p>Constantius left the shrine. As soon as his back was to me, I placed the withered flower on the profaned floor and whispered a quick prayer to Hermes. Then I followed the Emperor across the field to the road.</p>
<p>Once mounted, we exchanged formal farewells, and Constantius rode back to Milan, the dragon banner streaming in the cool wind before him. We never saw one another again.</p>
