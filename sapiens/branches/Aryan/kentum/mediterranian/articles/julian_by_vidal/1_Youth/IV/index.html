  <p>Five years passed. Little news of the outside world came to us. Sapor, the Great King of Persia, threatened our Eastern border, while the Germans infiltrated Gaul. That was all we knew. Politics was a forbidden subject. I studied Homer and Hesiod; read Plotinus and Porphyry; made love to the Antiochene; fought with Gallus, until one day I out-wrestled him and he never challenged me again. He was a coward except when he was in a rage; then he would do anything.</p>
<p>As long as I could read, I was never entirely wretched. But I did long to see more of the world than Macellum. It is most unnatural for a youth to be brought up entirely by soldiers and slaves, none of whom dares to be fond of him. Gallus and I had each other for company but we were not true brothers in any but the family sense—and only <em>half</em>-brothers at that, for we had different mothers. We were like two potentially hostile animals in the same cage. Yet I was ravished by his beauty, and impressed by his energy. Gallus was always doing something which I wanted to imitate. Sometimes he let me, but more often not, for he enjoyed tormenting me. It gave him particular pleasure to quarrel with me just before we were to go hunting. Then he could exclaim, &ldquo;All right! You stay home. This is a day for men.&rdquo; And the soldiers would laugh at me and I would flee while the exuberant Gallus would ride forth to hunt, as dogs barked and horns sounded through the dark green woods. But when I was allowed to go with him, I was close to ecstasy.</p>
<p>One September afternoon Bishop George arrived unexpectedly at Macellum. We had not seen him for some months, because, according to the deacon, &ldquo;It looks as though—now don&rsquo;t repeat a word of this!&rdquo; (as if we two prisoners had anyone to confide in)-&ldquo;Bishop George will be raised to the see of Alexandria. Bishop Athanasius holds Alexandria only because the Emperor Constans of the West insisted upon it. But now the Emperor Constantius is arranging for Athanasius to be exiled again and if he is, we go to Alexandria!&rdquo; The deacon was exalted at the thought. But Bishop George said nothing to us about church politics when we joined him in the main hall of the hunting lodge. He had other, greater news. His sallow face was dark with excitement while his fingers snapped a sharp continuous accompaniment to his words.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The divine Augustus will visit you in ten days&rsquo; time. He is on his way home from Antioch. He is making this side trip for the express purpose of seeing the two of you.&rdquo; I was too frightened to speak. It was Gallus who asked, &ldquo;What does he want?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Bishop was impatient. &ldquo;He is your cousin. Your guardian. Your emperor. He wants to see you.</p>
<p>What else? To see what sort of men you&rsquo;ve grown into. To see the result of our education. Now he will be particularly interested in your religious training. Therefore, I shall stay here until he arrives. We will review everything I have tried to teach you. This will mean, Gallus, a great deal of work for *you. * I suggest you put your mind to it, since your entire future may depend on the impression you make.&rdquo; And so does *yours, * Bishop, I remember thinking to myself, eager to include anyone I could in what I was certain would prove to be a harsh fate.</p>
<p>We studied hard. For hours on end the Bishop drilled us mercilessly. Fortunately I have an excellent memory and can learnthough not always understand! -a page at a glance. Between lessons, we tried to find out all that we could about Constantius&rsquo;s mood. Was he favourably disposed towards us? Were we to remain at Macellum? But the Bishop gave us no comfort. &ldquo;The divine Augustus will do what is best, as he always does. You have nothing to fear, <em>if</em> you are loyal and obedient.&rdquo; But of course we had</p>
<p>everything to fear. I did not sleep one night through during that time of waiting.</p>
<p>The day before Constantius was due to arrive, the imperial court came to Macellum. Some of the court had been with Constantius at Antioch; but most came directly from the Sacred Palace at Constantinople. All the chief officers of the state were to be lodged in the villa, while in the surrounding fields a hundred tents were pitched to accommodate the thousand clerks and notaries who conduct the business of the government.</p>
<p>At dawn the pageant began. Gallus and I stationed ourselves in the courtyard of the palace and gaped like two bumpkins. Neither of us had ever seen an imperial progress before, and in the general excitement and dazzle of that frosty autumn day we momentarily forgot our terror.</p>
<p>Bishop George stood in the doorway of the villa. He wore a jewelled chasuble, and held a silver crosier in one hand. To his left and right the military garrison of Macellum stood at attention to honour the great magnates of the Roman Empire. Some arrived on horseback, others in litters. Each was accompanied by a retinue of soldiers, clerks, eunuchs, slaves. All wore some variation of military dress, for ever since Diocletian the court has been military in its appearance, symbolic of Rome&rsquo;s beleaguered state.</p>
<p>The courtyard was soon crowded with clerks and slaves, horses and mules; only the area just in front of the door was kept clear. After each official dismounted, he would cross to the doorway, where Bishop George would then greet him with all his titles. The Bishop was a master of protocol. He knew exactly who everyone was and how he should be addressed, an enviable gift, since nowadays there are hundreds of subtle titles and distinctions. Highest in rank are the *clarissimi. * They include the two consuls for the year, all former consuls, the praetorian prefects, much of the senate. Next are the officials who are called *spectabiles. * Then the heads of government departments who are called *illustres. * But it is not easy to keep straight who is what, since an important minister of state like the quaestor (the emperor&rsquo;s legal adviser) is only an *illustris, * while the governor of an insignificant province may be a *clarissimus. * Also, the matter of the counts is confusing. In the old days, &ldquo;count&rdquo; was simply a courtesy title for any official or high-ranking officer who travelled in the emperor&rsquo;s entourage. But Constantine, with his Persian sense of hierarchy, made the title &ldquo;count&rdquo; a reward for important service. So some counts are <em>clarissimi</em> while others are merely *spectabiles. * It is amazing how obsessed otherwise sensible people are by these foolish titles. I have sat for hours in the company of grown men who could discuss nothing but who held what title and why he was unworthy of it. Yet a wise emperor can exert considerable pressure on ambitious men by the giving or withholding of these empty titles. Constantius was a master at this sort of thing.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, since I find it hard to remember who is what, I call nearly everyone &ldquo;my dear fellow&rdquo;, in imitation of Plato. This scandalizes the dignified.</p>
<p>First to arrive was the Count of the Sacred Largesse. It is his task to see that each province pays its taxes promptly on the first of every March. He also administers the government&rsquo;s salt monopoly and the provincial banks, as well as all state-owned factories, mines, and of course the mint. He is never a popular official, but he dies rich. He was followed by the Count of the Privy Purse, who administers the personal property of the imperial family. This official was accompanied by twenty slaves carrying chests of dark wood studded with metal; they contained the large sums of gold and silver the emperor must always travel with. Since Privy Purse is responsible for every coin, he tends to be a nervous, distracted figure, for ever counting boxes. Next, the Count of the East, who governs Syria and Mesopotamia. Then the Master of the Offices, a very great man indeed. He administers the state transportation system and post; he is the head of the bureau of secret agents; he commands the palace .guard; he arranges for audiences with the Emperor. Bishop George bowed particularly low to him.</p>
<p>For six years Gallus and I had seen no one except Bishop George and our guards. Now all at once there passed before us the whole power of the state. Our eyes were dazzled by glittering armour and</p>
<p>elaborate cloaks, by the din of a thousand clerks and notaries who scurried about the courtyard, demanding their baggage, quarrelling with one another, insisting on various prerogatives. These noisy clerks with their inky fingers and proud intelligent faces were the actual government of Rome, and they knew it.</p>
<p>The last official to arrive was the most important of all: the Grand Chamberlain of the Sacred Palace, the eunuch Eusebius. He was so large that it took two slaves to pull him out of his ivory and gold litter.</p>
<p>He was tall, stout and very white. Beneath the peacock blue of his silk tunic one could see the rolls of flesh quiver as he moved. Of all the officers of state, only he wore civilian clothes. In fact, he looked like a winsome lady of fashion with mouth artfully rouged and hair arranged in long oiled ringlets. The gold thread of his cape flashed in the sunlight.</p>
<p>Eusebius looked about him with sharp eyes, and I knew suddenly that he was looking for us. Half hidden by a mound of saddlebags, Gallus and I tried to become invisible, but though the Chamberlain had never seen either of us before, he knew immediately who we were. Gracefully, he motioned for us to join him. Like slaves anticipating a beating, we shuffled forward. Since we were not certain as to how to greet him, I attempted a military salute, which Gallus imitated. Eusebius smiled a tiny smile, exposing small dark teeth; several babyish dimples appeared in his full cheeks. He inclined his head; the neck fat creased; a long curl strayed across his brow.</p>
<p>&quot; *Nobilissimi, *&quot; he said in a soft voice. This was an excellent omen. The title <em>nobilissimus</em> is used only for members of the imperial family. Bishop George never used this title with us nor did our guards. Now, apparently, our rank had been restored. After a long scrutiny, Eusebius took each of us by a hand. I can still recall the soft dampness of his touch. &ldquo;I have so looked forward to seeing you both! And how grown up you are! Especially the noble Gallus.&rdquo; Delicately he felt Gallus&rsquo;s chest. This sort of impertinence would ordinarily have sent my brother into a rage, but that day he was far too frightened.</p>
<p>He also knew instinctively that his only protection was his beauty. Complaisantly he allowed the eunuch to caress him as we entered the villa. Eusebius had the most beguiling voice and manner of anyone I have ever known. I should say something here about the voices of eunuchs. Actors and other people who try to mimic them invariably tend to pitch their voices high, and screech. Eunuchs seldom sound like that. If they did, who would ever find their company tolerable? And at a court one must be particularly pleasing in one&rsquo;s manners. In actual fact, the voice of a eunuch is like that of a particularly gentle child, and this appeals to the parent in both men and women. Thus subtly do they disarm us, for we tend to indulge them as we would a child, forgetting that their minds are as mature and twisted as their bodies are lacking. Eusebius spun his web about Gallus. He did not bother with me. I was too young.</p>
<p>Gallus and Eusebius dined alone together that night. The next day Gallus was Eusebius&rsquo;s devoted admirer. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s also a friend? said Gallus. We were alone together in the baths. &ldquo;He told me how he&rsquo;s been getting reports about me for years. He knows everything I&rsquo;ve ever done. He even knows about *her. *&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gallus named the Antiochene, and giggled. &ldquo;Eusebius says I&rsquo;ll be a great success at court. Not only am I good-looking but I have a welldeveloped intelligence, those are his exact words. He&rsquo;s positive he can talk the Emperor into letting me go free. He says it may take a little time but that he has some small influence with His Eternity, that&rsquo;s exactly how he put it. He&rsquo;s very interesting, though it&rsquo;s hard sometimes to figure out what he&rsquo;s talking about. He expects you to know all sorts of things you wouldn&rsquo;t have any way of knowing, buffed in this damned place. Anyway Constantius does iust as Eusebius tells him. Everyone says so. Which means if you have Eusebius on your side, that&rsquo;s half the battle. And I&rsquo;ve got him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did he say about me?&rdquo; I asked. Gallus seldom strayed very far from his essential interest: himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You? Why should he say anything about you?&rdquo; Gallus ducked me in the cold pool. I pulled him in after me. He was slippery as a fish, but I managed to hold his head under water for a satisfactory length of time. At sixteen I was as strong as he was at twenty-one. He emerged spluttering and blue in the face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s going to make a monk out of you, that&rsquo;s what. Though if I have anything to say about it, you&rsquo;ll be a eunuch.&rdquo; He tried to kick me between the legs but slipped on the marble and fell. He cursed loudly, and I laughed. Then we were joined by slaves who helped us dress. Since Gallus was a man, the Master of the Offices had ruled that although he was not technically an officer, he could on this occasion wear the uniform of the household troops. Unfortunately, the <em>nobilissimus</em> Julian was merely a student and must dress accordingly. As a result, I looked quite insignificant beside my glittering half-brother. But I was perfectly happy to go unnoticed. Let Gallus shine. I preferred obscurity, and survival. Constantius had arrived at noon and gone straight to his apartments. That was all anyone knew. He might be with us in a few minutes, a few hours, or not at all. Meanwhile, we waited nervously in the great hall of the villa.</p>
<p>The rafters were hung with boughs of evergreen, and the ordinarily musty interior smelled of pine and eucalyptus. At one end of the hall, on a dais, a gold throne had been set. To the right of the throne, but at floor level, was the ivory chair of the praetorian prefect of the East (he had arrived with the Emperor). According to rank, the officers of the state were arranged to the left and right of the throne.</p>
<p>Just at the foot of the dais stood Bishop George in all his glory with Gallus on his right and me on his left.</p>
<p>Looking more than ever like a huge peacock, Eusebius stood at the door, surrounded by his staff of ushers. No one spoke or moved. We were like statues. Though the room was not hot, I was sweating nervously. I glanced at Gallus out of the comer of my eye; his mouth was twitching from the strain.</p>
<p>After what seemed days, we heard trumpets. Then the cry &ldquo;Augustus!&rdquo; which always precedes an emperor began, at first far off and faint; then closer, louder: &ldquo;Augustus! Augustus!&rdquo; My legs began to tremble. I was afraid I might be sick. Suddenly with a crash the double doors were flung open and there in the doorway stood Flavius Julius Constantius, Augustus of the East. With a gentle moan, Eusebius embraced Constantius&rsquo;s knees, melodiously murmuring soft words of ceremony not audible to the rest of us who were now prostrate, as the Lord of the World slowly and with extraordinary dignity crossed the room to his throne. I was too busy studying the mosaic floor to get even a glimpse of my imperial cousin. Not until the Master of the Offices gave the signal for everyone to rise was I able at last to observe my father&rsquo;s murderer.</p>
<p>Constantius was a man of overwhelming dignity. That was the most remarkable thing about him; even his most ordinary gestures seemed carefully rehearsed. Like the Emperor Augustus, he wore lifts in his sandals to make himself appear tall. He was cleanshaven, with large melancholy eyes. He had his father Constantine&rsquo;s large nose and thin, somewhat peevish mouth. The upper part of his body was impressively muscular but his legs were dwarfish. He wore the purple, a heavy robe which hung from shoulder to heel; on his head was a fillet of silver set with pearls.</p>
<p>Constantius sat very still on his throne as the Master of the Offices brought him Bishop George, who welcomed him to Macellum. Not once did the Emperor look at Gallus or me. The occasional ritual responses he made were said in such a low voice that none of us could make out the words.</p>
<p>Then the moment came. Bishop George led Gallus and me to the Master of the Offices, who in turn led us up to the dais and presented us formally to the Emperor. I was terrified. Without knowing how I got there, I found myself embracing Constantius&rsquo;s knees, as court etiquette requires.</p>
<p>From far off I heard the Emperor&rsquo;s voice, measured but rather higher-pitched than I had expected, &ldquo;We are pleased to receive our most noble cousin Julian.&rdquo; A large callused hand reached down, gripped me firmly by the left elbow and helped me to rise. For an instant I was so close to Constantius that I could make out every pore in his face, which was sunburned dark as a Persian&rsquo;s. I noticed the silkiness of his straight brown hair, only iust beginning to turn grey. He was thirty-two, but I thought him ancient. I also remember thinking: what must it be like to be Emperor of Rome? to know that one&rsquo;s face on coins, on monuments, painted and sculptured, is known to all the world? And here—so close to me that I could feel the reciprocal warmth of his skin—was the original of that world-famous face, not bronze or marble but soft flesh and bone, like me, like any other man. And I wondered: what is it like to be the centre of the world?</p>
<p>For the first time I experienced ambition. It came as a revelation. Only in communion with the One God have I known anything to equal it. How candid I am! I have never admitted to anyone that in my first encounter with Constantius, all that I could think was how much I should like the dominion of this earth! But my moment of madness was brief. I stammered a speech of loyalty, and took my place beside Gallus on the dais. I can remember nothing else that happened that day.</p>
<p>Constantius remained at Macellum for a week. He attended to the business of the state. He hunted.</p>
<p>Bishop George had a long interview with him on the day he arrived, but then, to the Bishop&rsquo;s chagrin, Constantius ignored him. Though Gallus and I dined at the Emperor&rsquo;s table every evening, he never spoke to us.</p>
<p>I was beginning to fear the worst. But Gallus, who saw Eusebius every day, said that the eunuch was optimistic. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s positive we&rsquo;ll be allowed to come to court this year. At least I will. He also said there was talk in the Sacred Consistory that I be made Caesar for the East.&rdquo; Gallus glowed with excitement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I could live at Antioch. I&rsquo;d have my own court. After all, it&rsquo;s what one was born for!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gallus made a good impression on everyone—somewhat to my surprise, for he was always rather sullen with Bishop George and downright cruel to me and his teachers. But set among the great officers of the state, he was a different person. He laughed; he flattered; he charmed. He was a natural courtier, and one by one he enchanted the members of the Sacred Consistory, as the Emperor&rsquo;s council is known.</p>
<p>Only with Constantius did he make no headway. Our cousin was biding his time.</p>
<p>During the time the court was at Macellum, the junior officers and lesser officials dined in the main hall of the palace, while the Emperor and the magnates dined in the banqueting hall, which was somewhat smaller. In the hour before dinner everyone used to gather in the main hall to gossip. It was our first experience of a court. I found it bewildering, but Gallus took to it like a swan to water.</p>
<p>One evening Gallus allowed me to tag after him as he moved through that splendid company. Gallus was an excellent politician. He made friends not just with the magnates but also with the clerks and notaries who do the actual work of governing. He was shrewd. I of course was perfectly tongue-tied.</p>
<p>In the large hall, Gallus quickly gravitated to the group of officers with whom he had only that day gone hunting. I remember looking at these young men with wonder, for they had actually killed other men in battle in such far-away places as Germany and Mesopotamia. They were unusually self-contained and rather quiet, unlike the clerks and notaries, who were exceedingly talkative, eager to impress one with their knowledge of secret matters.</p>
<p>Gallus seemed particularly to like one tribune, an officer in his thirties named Victor (who is now one of my generals). Victor was—is—an impressive-looking man who speaks good Greek, though he comes from the Black Sea; he is bandy-legged and paleeyed like so many Russians. &ldquo;Is this the most noble Julian?&rdquo; he asked, turning to me.</p>
<p>Gallus introduced me in an offhand way to the company. I blushed and said nothing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you be serving with us in the household troops?&rdquo; Victor asked.</p>
<p>Gallus answered for me. &ldquo;No. He&rsquo;s going to be a priest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before I could deny this, Victor said quite seriously, &ldquo;I can think of no life worthier than one in the service of God.&rdquo; I was struck by the simplicity with which he said this. No irony was intended.</p>
<p>Gallus was somewhat taken aback. &ldquo;Not for me,&rdquo; he said finally.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nor for me, unfortunately.&rdquo; Victor gave me a sympathetic smile. &ldquo;You must pray for us,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Gallus changed the subject. While he talked hunting with Victor, I stood by silently, beginning to feel already like one of those Galilean monks or &ldquo;solitaries&rdquo; as they are called, which is rather a misnomer since no monk is ever solitary. They are the most gregarious set of men in the world, for ever eating, guzzling and gossiping with one another. Most of them retire from the world in order to have a continuous party.+++(4)+++</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you really going to become a priest?&rdquo; The voice was low.</p>
<p>I turned and saw a young man standing behind me. He had obviously been there for some time. I shook my head. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good.&rdquo; He smiled. He had sharp grey eyes beneath brows which met, giving him the look of one continually concentrating on some distant object. He wore civilian clothes, which was odd since at his age anyone of good family wears uniform at court.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oribasius of Pergamon, physician to the divine Augustus, who doesn&rsquo;t need me. Your cousin is the healthiest man I&rsquo;ve ever met.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am happy to hear that!&rdquo; I blazed sincerity. One&rsquo;s neck depended on this sort of response.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a matter of diet,&rdquo; said Oribasius matter-of-factly. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a perfect example of the moderate life.</p>
<p>He drinks almost no wine. He never overeats. He&rsquo;ll live for ever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I pray that he does,&rdquo; I said, my heart sinking. What would <em>my</em> life be like, lived in the shadow of a never &hellip;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why does your brother say you&rsquo;re going to be a priest?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because I read books. He finds that strange.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And he associates strangeness with the priesthood?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I tried not to smile. &ldquo;Something like that. But I should like to be a philosopher or a rhetorician. Apparently I have no gift for soldiering. At least Gallus says I haven&rsquo;t. But then, everything depends on the will of the divine Augustus.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Oribasius. He looked at me curiously. I recognized the look. I had seen it all my life. It meant: Are they going to kill this boy? And if they do, how interesting it all is! From birth I had been treated like a character in a tragic play.&ldquo;Do you like Macellum?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would you, if you were me?&rdquo; I had not meant to say this. But his look had irritated me and I suddenly rebelled at being treated like a mere thing, a victim, the dumb sacrifice in a bloody legend.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Oribasius evenly. &ldquo;I would not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then, you know how it is.&rdquo; But frightened now that I had said too much, I began to babble about the goodness of my cousin, the kindness of Bishop George, the beauty of Cappadocia. For all I knew, Oribasius was a secret agent. Luckily, one of the chamberlains came to announce the approach of the Emperor, and I hurriedly left the main hall and took my place at table.</p>
<p>I have recorded this meeting with Oribasius, since he was to become my closest friend. But I did not see him again at Macellum or, if I did, I don&rsquo;t remember him. He has told me since, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never seen anyone look so frightened as you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When I told him that <em>my</em> memory of myself in those days was one of serene self-control, Oribasius laughed. &ldquo;I was positive you were on the verge of madness. I even diagnosed you—incorrectly—as an epileptic.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what did you think of Gallus?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was the one who appeared serene. I was quite impressed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And of course Gallus went mad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t claim to be infallible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>People never make the impression they think they make. But Oribasius was quite right in one thing: I <em>was</em> terrified.</p>
<p>• • •
My interview with Constantius occurred on the last day of his visit. Bishop George spent the morning coaching us in what to say. He was as nervous as we were; his career was at stake, too. Gallus was admitted first to the sacred presence. During the halfhour he was with the Emperor, I recall praying to every deity I could think of; even then I was eclectic!</p>
<p>At last the Master of the Offices, gorgeous in court robes, came to fetch me. He looked like an executioner. Bishop George rattled out a blessing. The Master gave me instructions in how I was to salute the Emperor and which formula of greeting I was to use. I muttered them over and over to myself as I swam-that was my exact sensation—into the presence of the Augustus.</p>
<p>Constantius was seated on an ordinary chair in the apse of the hall. Eusebius stood beside him, holding a sheaf of documents. On a stool at Constantius&rsquo;s feet sat Gallus, looking well-pleased with himself.</p>
<p>I went through the formula of homage, the words falling without thought from my lips. Constantius gave me a long, shrewd, curious look. Then he did not look at me again during the course of the interview. He was one of those men who could never look another in the eye. Nor should this characteristic be taken, necessarily, as a sign of weakness or bad conscience. I am rather like Constantius in this. I have always had difficulty looking into men&rsquo;s eyes. All rulers must. Why? Because of what we see: self-interest, greed, fear. It is not a pleasant sensation to know that merely by existing one inspires animal terror in others. Constantius was often evil in his actions but he took no pleasure in the pain of others. He was not a Caligula, nor a Gallus.</p>
<p>Constantius spoke to me rapidly and impersonally. &ldquo;We have received heartening reports concerning the education of our most noble cousin Julian. Bishop George tells us that it is your wish to prepare for the priesthood.&rdquo; He paused, not so much to hear what I might say as to give proper weight to what he intended to say next. As it was, I was speechless.</p>
<p>Constantius continued, &ldquo;You must know that your desire to serve God is pleasing to us. It is not usual for princes to remove themselves from the world, but then it is not usual for any man to be called by heaven.&rdquo; I suddenly saw with perfect clarity the prison I was to occupy. Deftly, Constantius spun his web. No priest could threaten him. I would be a priest. &ldquo;Bishop George tells me that you have pondered deeply the disputes which—sadly—divide holy church. And he assures me that in your study of sacred matters you have seen the truth and believe, as all Christians ought, that the son is of like substance to the father, though not of the same substance. Naturally, as one of our family, you may not live as an ordinary holy man; responsibilities will be thrust upon you. For this reason your education must be continued at Constantinople. You are already a reader in the church. In Constantinople you can hope to become ordained, which will give us pleasure, as well as making you most pleasing to God who has summoned you to serve him. And so we salute our cousin and find him a worthy descendant of Claudius Gothicus, the founder of our house.&rdquo; That was all. Constantius gave me his hand to kiss. 1</p>
<p>never said a word beyond those required by court ceremonial. As 1 backed out of the room, I saw Gallus smile at Eusebius.</p>
<p>I wonder now what Constantius was thinking. I suspect that even then I may have puzzled him.</p>
<p>Gallus was easily comprehended. But who was this silent youth who wanted to become a priest? I had planned to say all sorts of things to Constantius, but he had given me no opportunity. Surprisingly enough, he was nervous with everyone. He could hardly speak, except when he was able to speak, as it were, from the throne. Excepting his wife, Eusebia, and the Grand Chamberlain, he had no confidants.</p>
<p>He was a curious man. Now that I am in his place I have more sympathy for him than I did, though no liking. His suspicious nature was obviously made worse by the fact that he was somewhat less intelligent than those he had to deal with. This added to his unease and made him humanly inaccessible. As a student he had failed rhetoric simply through slowness of mind. Later he took to writing poetry, which embarrassed everyone. His only &ldquo;intellectual&rdquo; exercise was Galilean disputes. I am told that he was quite good at this sort of thing, but any village quibbler can make a name for himself at a Galilean synod.</p>
<p>Look at Athanasius!</p>
<p>I was relieved by this interview. Of course I did not want to become a priest, though if that were the price I had to pay for my life I was perfectly willing to pay it.</p>
<p>In a blaze of pageantry, Constantius departed. Gallus, Bishop George and I stood in the courtyard as he rode past. Mounted, he looked splendid and tall in his armour of chased gold. He acknowledged no one as he rode out of Macellum. In his cold way he was most impressive, and I still envy him his majesty.</p>
<p>He could stand for hours in public looking neither to left nor right, motionless as a statue, which is what our ceremonial requires. It was the Emperor Diocletian who decided that we should become, in effect, if not in title, Asiatic kings, to be displayed on rare occasions like the gilded effigies of gods. Diocletian&rsquo;s motive was understandable, perhaps inevitable, for in the last century emperors were made and unmade frivolously, at the whim of the army. Diocletian felt that if we were to be set apart, made sacred in the eyes of the people and hedged round by awe-inspiring ritual, the army would have less occasion to treat us with easy contempt. To a certain extent, this policy has worked. Yet today whenever I ride forth in state and observe the awe in the faces of the people, an awe inspired not by me but by the theatricality of the occasion, I feel a perfect impostor and want to throw off my weight of gold and shout, &ldquo;Do you want a statue or a man?&rdquo; I don&rsquo;t, of course, because they would promptly reply, &ldquo;A statue!&rdquo;</p>
<p>As we watched the long procession make its way from the villa to the main highway, Gallus suddenly exclaimed, &ldquo;What I&rsquo;d give to go with them!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will be gone soon enough, most noble Gallus.&rdquo; Bishop George had now taken to using our titles.&ldquo;When?&rdquo; I asked. Gallus answered. &ldquo;In a few days. The Emperor promised. &lsquo;When all is ready, you will join us.&rsquo; That&rsquo;s what he said. I shall be given a military command, and then…!&rdquo; But Gallus was sufficiently wise not to mention his hopes for the future. Instead he gave me a dazzling smile. &ldquo;And then,&rdquo; he repeated, with his usual malice, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ll become a deacon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The beginning of a most holy career,&rdquo; said Bishop George, removing his silver headdress and handing it to an attendant. There was a red line around his brow where the crown had rested. &ldquo;I wish I could continue with your education myself, but, alas, the divine Augustus has other plans for me.&rdquo; For an instant a look of pure delight illuminated that lean, sombre face.&ldquo;Alexandria?&rdquo; I asked. He put his finger to his lips, and we went inside, each pleased with his fate: Gallus as Caesar in the East, George as bishop of Alexandria, and I… well, at least I would be able to continue my studies; better a live priest than a dead prince.</p>
<p>For the next few weeks we lived in hourly expectation of the imperial summons. But as the weeks became months, hope slowly died in each of us. We had been forgotten.</p>
<p>Bishop George promptly lost all interest in our education. We seldom saw him, and when we did his attitude was obscurely resentful, as if we were in some way responsible for his bad luck. Gallus was grim and prone to sudden outbursts of violence. If a brooch did not fasten properly, he would throw it on the floor and grind it under his heel. On the days when he spoke at all, he roared at everyone. But most of the time he was silent and glowering, his only interest the angry seduction of slave girls. I was not, I confess, in the best of spirits either, but at least I had Plotinus and Plato. I was able to study, and to wait.</p>
<p>• • •
One curious thing happened at this time. At the villa there were a number of Cappadocian youths,</p>
<p>free-born country boys who worked in the stables as grooms and trainers. They were a cheerful lot and when I first came to Macellum I was allowed to play games with them. They were the only companions I ever had of my own age. I liked one in particular, Hilarius, a good-looking youth, two years older than I.</p>
<p>He had a quick mind, and I remember trying to teach him to read when I was ten and already a pedagogue! But as we grew older, each became aware of his place, and intimacy ceased. Even so, I continued to interest myself in his welfare, and when he told me that he wanted to marry a girl in Caesarea whose father disapproved of the match, I was able to bring the father round. I also made Hilarius my personal groom.</p>
<p>One April morning when I sent for my horse, a strange groom brought it. Where was Hilarius? Out riding with the most noble Gallus. I was surprised. Gallus had his own groom, and we never used one another&rsquo;s servants. But then I thought no more about it. Quite happy to be alone, I rode towards the foothills of Mount Argaeus, enioying the cool spring day. New leaves shone yellowgreen against black branches, and the earth steamed with a white mist as I rode towards a favourite spot where juniper and cedar grew around a natural spring.</p>
<p>At the approach to the clearing, I heard a sharp cry, like an animal in pain. Then I saw two horses tethered to a bent cedar tree at whose bole were strewn a man&rsquo;s clothes. Close by, hands and feet bound, the naked Hilarius lay on his belly while Gallus beat him with a riding crop. Every time the whip struck, Hilarius would cry out. Most extraordinary of all was the expression on Gallus&rsquo;s face. He was grinning with absolute pleasure, his face transfigured by the other&rsquo;s pain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop it!&rdquo; I rode straight up to him. Startled, Gallus turned towards me. The boy called out to me to save him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keep out of this.&rdquo; Gallus&rsquo;s voice was curiously hoarse.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s my groom,&rdquo; I said, rather irrelevantly, for if the boy had been disobedient then Gallus had quite as much fight as I to punish him. &ldquo;I said keep out of this! Go back!&rdquo; Gallus aimed the whip at me but struck the flank of my horse instead. The horse reared. Gallus, alarmed, dropped the whip. In a fury myself, I rode straight at my brother, the way cavalrymen are taught to ride down foot-soldiers. He bolted. I reined in my horse just as he mounted his own. We faced one another for an instant, breathing hard. Gallus was still grinning, his teeth bared like a dog ready to snap.</p>
<p>I tried to be calm. With great effort I asked, &ldquo;What did he do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>To which Gallus answered, &quot; *Nothing! *&rdquo; Then with a laugh, he spurred his horse and was gone. To this day I can remember the way he said, &ldquo;Nothing.&rdquo; Just as the Pythoness is filled with the spirit of Apollo, so my brother Gallus was possessed by evil. It was horrible.</p>
<p>I dismounted. I untied the boy, who was now sobbing and babbling how he had done nothing—</p>
<p>again *nothing! *—when without a word of anger or reproach Gallus had ordered him to dismount and strip. Gallus had meant to beat him to death. I am sure of that.</p>
<p>I rode back to Macellum, ready to do murder myself. But when Gallus and I met that night at dinner, my anger had worn off and in its place I experienced something like fear. I could cope with almost any man. Young as I was, I had that much confidence in myself. But a demon was another matter; especially a demon that I did not understand.</p>
<p>All through dinner I stared at Gallus, who chose to be delightful, playful and charming, and nowhere in his smiling face could I find any hint of that sharp-toothed—I nearly wrote &ldquo;fanged&quot;grin I had seen a few hours earlier. I almost began to wonder if perhaps I had dreamed the whole business. But when I visited Hilarius the next day and saw the scars on his back I knew that I had dreamt nothing. *Nothing. *</p>
<p>The word haunts me to this day. For the remainder of our time at Macellum, Gallus and I contrived never to be alone together. When we did speak to one another, it was always politely. We never mentioned what had happened in the clearing.</p>
<p>A month later a letter arrived from the Grand Chamberlain: the most noble Gallus was to proceed to his late mother&rsquo;s estate at Ephesus; here he was to remain at the Emperor&rsquo;s pleasure. Gallus was both elated and crestfallen. He was free of Macellum but he was still a prisoner, and there was no mention of his being made Caesar.</p>
<p>Gallus said good-bye to his officer friends at a dinner to which I was, surprisingly, invited. He made a pleasant speech, promising to remember his friends if he was ever to have a military command. Bishop George then presented him with a Galilean testament bound in massive silver. &ldquo;Study it well, most noble Gallus. Outside the church there can be no salvation.&rdquo; How often have I heard that presumptuous line!</p>
<p>The next day when it was time for Gallus to say good-bye to me, he did so simply. &ldquo;Pray for me, brother, as I pray for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall. Good-bye, Gallus.&rdquo; And we parted, exactly like strangers who, having met for an evening in a post-house, take different roads the next day. After Gallus left, I wept, for the last time as a child. Yet I hated him. They say that to know oneself is to know all there is that is human. But of course no one can ever know himself. Nothing human is finally calculable; even to ourselves we are strange.</p>
<p>On 1 June 348, almost as an afterthought, orders concerning me were sent to Bishop George. I was to proceed to Constantinople. Though my uncle Julian was in Egypt, his household was at my disposal. I was to study philosophy under Ecebolius, a favourite of Constantius. There was no suggestion of the priesthood, which delighted me if not Bishop George. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t think why Augustus has changed his mind. He was quite positive when he was here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps he may have some other use for me,&rdquo; I said tentatively.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What better use is there than the service of God?&rdquo; Bishop George was in a bad temper. Athanasius was still at Alexandria, and it now looked as if George was doomed to spend the rest of his life in Cappadocia. With bad grace, he organized my departure.</p>
<p>It was a warm, misty day when I got into the carriage which was to take me to Constantinople. Just as I was about to depart, Bishop George asked me if I was certain that I had returned all the volumes of Plotinus to his library. His secretary had reported there was one missing. I swore that it had been returned only that morning (which was true: I had been hurriedly copying passages from it in a notebook). The Bishop then gave me his blessing and a Galilean testament, bound not in silver but in cheap leather; apparently I was not destined to be a Caesar! Yet I thanked him profusely and said farewell. The driver cracked his whip. The horses broke into a trot. For the first time in six years I was leaving the confines of Macellum. My childhood was over, and I was still alive.</p>
