A week after I arrived in Athens I met the Hierophant of Greece. Since I did not want the proconsul to know of this meeting, it was arranged to take place in the Library of Hadrian, a not much frequented building midway between the Roman and the Athenian agoras.
At noon I arrived at the library and went straight to the north reading room, enjoying as I always do the musty dry odour of papyrus and ink which comes from the tall niches where the scrolls and codices are kept. The high room with its coffered ceiling (for which we must thank Antinofis’s protector) was empty. Here I waited for the Hierophant. I was extremely nervous, for he is the holiest of all men. I am forbidden by law to write his name but I can say that he belongs to the family of the Eumolpidae, one of the two families from which Hierophants are traditionally drawn.">

  <p><em>Julian Augustus</em></p>
<p>A week after I arrived in Athens I met the Hierophant of Greece. Since I did not want the proconsul to know of this meeting, it was arranged to take place in the Library of Hadrian, a not much frequented building midway between the Roman and the Athenian agoras.</p>
<p>At noon I arrived at the library and went straight to the north reading room, enjoying as I always do the musty dry odour of papyrus and ink which comes from the tall niches where the scrolls and codices are kept. The high room with its coffered ceiling (for which we must thank Antinofis&rsquo;s protector) was empty. Here I waited for the Hierophant. I was extremely nervous, for he is the holiest of all men. I am forbidden by law to write his name but I can say that he belongs to the family of the Eumolpidae, one of the two families from which Hierophants are traditionally drawn.</p>
<p>He is not only High Priest of Greece, he is custodian and interpreter of the mysteries of Eleusis which go back at least two thousand years, if not to the beginning of our race. Those of us who have been admitted to the mysteries may not tell what we have seen or what we know. Even so, as Pindar wrote: &ldquo;Happy is he who, having seen these rites, goes below the hollow earth; for he knows the end of life and he knows its god-sent beginning.&rdquo; Sophocles described initiates as &ldquo;Thrice-happy mortals, who having seen those rites depart for Hades; for them alone is it granted to have true life there; to the rest, evil.&rdquo; I quote from memory. (Note to secretary: Correct quotations, if they are wrong.) Eleusis is a city fourteen miles from Athens. For two thousand years the mysteries have been celebrated in that place, for it was at Eleusis that Persephone returned from the underworld to which she had been stolen by the death-god Hades and made his queen.</p>
<p>When Persephone first vanished, her mother Demeter, the harvest goddess, sought her for nine days, neither eating nor drinking. (As I tell this story initiates will see the mystery unfold. But no one else may know what is meant.) On the tenth day Demeter came to Eleusis. She was received by the king and queen, who gave her a pitcher of barley water flavoured with mint which she drank all at once. When the king&rsquo;s eldest son said, &ldquo;How greedily you drink!&rdquo; Demeter turned him into a lizard. But then, remorseful over what she had done, she conferred great powers upon the king&rsquo;s youngest son, Triptolemus. She gave him seed corn, a wooden plough and a chariot drawn by serpents; he then travelled the earth teaching men agriculture. She did this for him not only to make up for what in her anger she had done to his brother, but also because Triptolemus was able to tell her what had happened to her daughter. He had been in the fields when the earth suddenly opened before him. Then a chariot drawn by black horses appeared, coming from the sea. The driver was Hades; in his arms he held Persephone. As the chariot careered at full speed into the cavern, the earth closed over them. Now Hades is brother to Zeus, king of the gods, and he had stolen the girl with Zeus&rsquo;s connivance. When Demeter learned this, she took her revenge.</p>
<p>She bade the trees not to bear fruit and the earth not to flower. Suddenly, the world was barren. Men starved. Zeus capitulated: if Persephone had not yet eaten the food of the dead, she might return to her mother. As it turned out, Persephone had eaten seven pomegranate seeds and this was enough to keep her for ever in the underworld. But Zeus arranged a compromise. Six months of the year she would remain with Hades, as queen of Tartarus. The remaining six months she would join her mother in the world above. That is why the cold barren time of the year is six months and the warm fruitful time six</p>
<p>months. Demeter also gave the fig tree to Attica, and forbade the cultivation of beans. This holy story is acted out in the course of the mysteries. I cannot say more about it. The origin of the ceremony goes back to Crete and, some say, to Libya. It is possible that those places knew similar mysteries, but it is a fact that Eleusis is the actual place where Persephone returned from the underworld. I have myself seen the cavern from which she emerged.</p>
<p>Now: for those who have been initiated, I have in the lines above given in the form of a narrative a clear view of what happens after death. Through number and symbol, I have in a page revealed everything. But the profane may not unravel the mystery. They will merely note that I have told an old story of the old gods.</p>
<p>The Hierophant entered the reading room. He is a short plump man, not in the least impressive to look at. He saluted me gravely. His voice is powerful and he speaks old Greek exactly the way it was spoken two thousand years ago, for in the long descent of his family the same words have been repeated in exactly the same way from generation to generation. It is awesome to think that Homer heard what we still hear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have been busy. I am sorry. But this is the sacred month. The mysteries begin in a week.&rdquo; So he began, prosaically.</p>
<p>I told him that I wished to be initiated into <em>all</em> the mysteries: the lesser, the greater, and the highest. I realized that this would be difficult to arrange on such short notice, but I had not much time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It can be done, of course. But you will need to study hard. Have you a good memory?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I said that I still retained most of Homer. He reminded me that the mysteries last for nine days and that there are many passwords, hymns and prayers which must be learned before the highest mystery can be revealed. &ldquo;You must not falter.&rdquo; The Hierophant was stern. I said that I thought I could learn what I needed to know in a week, for I do indeed have a good memory; at least it is good when properly inspired.</p>
<p>I was candid. I told him that if I lived, it was my hope to support Hellenism in its war with the Galileans.</p>
<p>He was abrupt. &ldquo;It is too late,&rdquo; he said, echoing Prohaeresius. &ldquo;Nothing you can do will change what is about to happen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I had not expected such a response. &ldquo;Do you <em>know</em> the future?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am Hierophant,&rdquo; he said simply. &ldquo;The <em>last</em> Hierophant of Greece. I know many things, all tragic.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I refused to accept this. &ldquo;But how can you be the last? Why, for centuries…&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Prince, these things are written at the beginning. No one may tamper with fate. When I die, I shall be succeeded not by a member of our family but by a priest from another sect. He will be in name, but not in fact, the final Hierophant. Then the temple at Eleusis will be destroyed—all the temples in all of Greece will be destroyed. The barbarians will come. The Christians will prevail. Darkness will fall.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For ever?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who can say? The goddess has shown me no more than what I have told you. With me, the true line ends. With the next Hierophant, the mysteries themselves will end.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I cannot believe it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That alters nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But if I were to become Emperor…&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would make no difference.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then obviously, I shall <em>not</em> become Emperor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I smiled at this subtlety, for we had got around the law forbidding prophecy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whether you are Emperor or not, Eleusis will be in ruins before the century is done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I looked at him closely. We were sitting on a long bench beneath a high latticed window. Lozenges of light superimposed their own designs upon the tiled floor at our feet. Despite his terrible conviction, this small fat man with his protuberant eyes and fat hands was perfectly composed. I have never known such selfcontainment, even in Constantius.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I refuse to believe,&rdquo; I said at last, &ldquo;that there is nothing we can do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He shrugged. &ldquo;We shall go on as long as we can, as we always have.&rdquo; He looked at me solemnly. &ldquo;You must remember that because the mysteries come to an end makes them no less true. Those who were initiated will at least be fortunate in the underworld. Of course one pities those who come after us. But what is to be must be.&rdquo; He rose with dignity, his small plump body held tightly erect, as though by will he might stiffen the soft flesh. &ldquo;I shall instruct you myself. We shall need several hours a day. Come to my house tonight.&rdquo; With a small bow he withdrew.</p>
<p>During the weeks that followed, we saw each other every day. Yet I came to know the Hierophant no better. On any subject not connected with the mysteries, he refused to speak. I gave up talking to him, accepting him as what he was: a palpable link with the holy past but not a human companion.</p>
<p>I need not describe the celebrations which precede the initiation, since they are known to everyone.</p>
<p>Though I may not describe the mysteries themselves, I can say that in this particular year more people took part in the festivities than usual, to the chagrin of the Galileans.</p>
<p>The whole business takes nine days. The first day was hot and enervating. The proclamation was made and the sacred obiects brought from Eleusis to the Eleusinion, a small temple at the foot of the acropolis where—among other interesting things—there is a complete list of Alcibiades&rsquo; personal property, seized when he profaned the mysteries one drunken night by imitating on a street corner the Hierophant&rsquo;s secret rites. The sacred objects are contained in several jars tied with red ribbons. They are put in the Eleusinion, to be returned to Eleusis during the main procession, which is on the fifth day.</p>
<p>On the second day, we bathed in the sea and washed the pig each of us had bought for sacrifice. I chose the beach at Phaleron, and nearly lost the pig I had bought for six drachmae. It is an amazing sight to watch several thousand people bathing in the sea, each with a squealing pig.</p>
<p>The third day is one of sacrifice, and a long night. The fourth day is sacred to Asklepios; one stays at home. On the fifth day the procession starts from the Dipylon Gate to Eleusis.</p>
<p>It was a lovely sight. An image of the god Iacchos, son of Demeter, is borne in a wooden carriage at the procession&rsquo;s head. This part of the ceremony is sacred to him. Though all are supposed to walk to Eleusis, most of the well-to-do are carried in litters. I walked. My bodyguards complained, but I was exalted. I was crowned with myrtle and I carried not only the sacred branches tied with wool but also, according to tradition, new clothes in a bundle on a stick over my shoulder. Macrina accompanied me.</p>
<p>The day was cloudy, which made the journey pleasmater than it usually is at that time of the year. All told, there were perhaps a thousand of us in the procession, not counting the curious, which included a number of Galileans who shouted atheist curses at us.</p>
<p>On the outskirts of Athens, just off the main road, Macrina pointed to a complex of old buildings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is the most famous brothel in Greece,&rdquo; she said with her usual delight in such things.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The shrine of Aphrodite.&rdquo; Apparently, people come from all over the world to visit the shrine, where for a price they enjoy the &ldquo;priestesses&rdquo;. They pretend it is religion. Actually, it is mass prostitution. I could not disapprove more.</p>
<p>Just beyond the shrine there is an old bridge. Here the ordeal begins. On the bridge&rsquo;s parapet sit men with faces covered by hoods. It is their traditional function to remind important people of their faults and to condemn their pride. I consoled myself by remembering that Hadrian and Marcus Aurelius had preceded me on this bridge. If they had survived humiliation, so could I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It won&rsquo;t be bad.&rdquo; Macrina tried to be reassuring. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re much too frightened of Constantius.&rdquo; But</p>
<p>I recalled how Hadrian had been jeered for his love of Antinoiis, and Hadrian was a reigning emperor, not mere cousin to one. I was sweating as we reached the bridge. All eyes were upon me. The hooded men—at least thirty of them—had just finished tormenting a local magistrate. They turned now to me.</p>
<p>Macrina held my arm tight. Heart beating fast and eyes cast down, I walked slowly over the bridge. The jeering and curses were formidable. At first I tried not to listen, but then I recalled that this humiliation is an essential part of the mysteries: to rid oneself of pride. I listened. I was accused mostly of falseness and pretension. I was not a true scholar. I was a <em>poseur</em>. I looked like a goat. I was a coward and afraid to serve in the army (this was unexpected). I hated the Galileans. This made me nervous indeed but happily, it was said only once. After all, my tormentors were of the true religion and not apt to hold my dislike of the Galileans against me.</p>
<p>Finally, the bridge was crossed. The ordeal ended. Feeling purged and relieved (the worst is never so bad as one fears), I walked the rest of the way to Eleusis, with Macrina grumbling at my side. I&rsquo;m afraid she taunted me quite as much as the men on the bridge. But as I drew closer to the mysteries, I was filled with such a sense of expectancy that nothing could disturb my mood.</p>
<p>It was night when we arrived at Eleusis. The city is a small one on the Saronic Gulf, with a view of the island of Salamis. Like most cities whose principal source of revenue is strangers, Eleusis is full of inns and cookshops and tradesmen eager to sell copies of sacred objects at ridiculously high prices. It is a wonder that any place remains sacred, considering the inevitable presence of those whose livelihood depends on cheating strangers. I am told that Delphi is even worse than Eleusis; while Jerusalem—</p>
<p>which is of course &ldquo;sacred&rdquo; to the Galileans-is now a most distressing place to visit.</p>
<p>Torches blazed in every street of the town. Night was like day. Innkeepers solicited us, and at every street corner, men told of places to eat. Even vice was proposed, which shows how debased the local population is, for they should know better than anyone that during the pilgrims&rsquo; three days in Eleusis, they must fast, remain continent, and touch neither the body of one dead nor that of a woman who has just given birth; eggs and beans are also forbidden us, even after the first day&rsquo;s fast.</p>
<p>Macrina and I followed the crowd to where the mysteries are enacted. Homer has described how the original temple was at the foot of the acropolis, in much the same spot as the present temple, or Telestrion, as it is called. This night everything was illuminated in honour of the Great Mysteries.</p>
<p>The entrance to the sacred enclosure is through a gate, even more noble than the Dipylon at Athens.</p>
<p>We entered, passing through a roped-off section where guards and priests made sure that we were indeed initiates, remarkable by our dress and certain signs. The gate is so cunningly arranged that anyone looking through can see no more than a few yards of the sacred way; any further view of the Telestrion is broken by the large blank wall of the Ploutonion, a temple built over the original passage to Hades from which Persephone appeared.</p>
<p>Eyes smarting from torch smoke, Macrina and I ascended the sacred way, pausing first at the Kallichoros Well. I was overcome with awe, for this is the same well described by Homer. It is old beyond memory. It was here in the time when the gods walked the earth that the women of Eleusis danced in honour of Demeter. The opening of the well is several steps below the main terrace, and faced with magnificent marble. Near it stands a large basin containing sacred water. I bathed my hands and began to know Demeter and her grief. I was so moved that I almost neglected to pay the priestess the one drachma for the experience.</p>
<p>Next we entered the Ploutonion, which is set in a rocky hollow of the acropolis. The elmwood doors were shut to us, but the altar outside, cut in living rock, was illuminated.</p>
<p>Finally we came to the long stoa of Philon, which fronts the Telestrion. Beyond this blue-paved portico the blank fagade of the holiest building on earth is set against the acropolis, which provides its fourth wall. There are greater and more splendid temples in the world, but there is none which quite</p>
<p>inspires one&rsquo;s reverence in the way the Telestrion does, for it has been holy since almost the first day of man, a creation of that beautiful lost world when the gods, not beleaguered, lived among us, and earth was simple and men good.</p>
<p>Since we were not yet initiates, we could not enter the Telestrion. At this point we were joined by two priests who led us to the house where the Eumolpidae have lived for a thousand years. We were to spend the night there. The Hierophant, however, did not join us. On this night of nights, he fasted and meditated. Macrina and I sat up until dawn. &ldquo;You must be admitted to the mysteries.&rdquo; I scolded her, as I had done before.</p>
<p>But she was perverse. &ldquo;How can I? I&rsquo;m not one thing or the other. I don&rsquo;t like the Christians because they are cruel. I don&rsquo;t like the mysteries and all the rest because I don&rsquo;t believe anything can help us when we are dead. Either we continue in some way, or we stop. But no matter what happens, it is beyond our control and there is no way of making a bargain with the gods. Consider the Christians, who believe there is a single god…&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In three parts!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, yours is in a thousand bits. Anyway, if by some chance the Christians <em>are</em> right, then all this&rdquo; -</p>
<p>she gestured towards the Telestrion—&ldquo;is wrong, and you will go to their hell rather than to your Elysium.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the Galileans <em>are</em> wrong.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who can say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Homer. Thousands of years of the true faith. Are we to believe there was no god until the appearance of a rabble-rousing carpenter three hundred years ago? It is beyond sense to think that the greatest age of man was godless.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must argue with the Twins,&rdquo; said Macrina; then we spoke of matters which I shall not record.</p>
<p>The next three days were beyond imagination. I was admitted to all of the mysteries, including the final and most secret. I saw that which is <em>enacted</em>, that which is <em>shown</em> and that which is <em>spoken</em>. I saw the passion of Demeter, the descent of Persephone to the underworld, the giving of grain to man. I saw the world as it is and the world that is to come. I lost my fear of death in the Telestrion when, in a blaze of light, I looked upon the sacred objects. It <em>was true</em>. More than this I cannot write. It is forbidden to reveal anything that one sees and hears during the two nights spent in the Telestrion. But I will make one general comment, a dissent from Aristotle, who wrote: &ldquo;The initiated do not learn anything so much as feel certain emotions and are put into a certain frame of mind.&rdquo; First of all, one must question the proposition that a new emotion is not something learned. I should think that it was. In any case, I have yet to meet anyone who has been initiated at Eleusis who did not learn new things not only about the life we live now but the one to follow. There is such a logic to what is revealed on those two nights that one is astonished not to have understood it before-which proves to me the truth of what is seen, heard and demonstrated. We are part of a never-ending cycle, a luminous spiral of life, lost and regained, of death to life to… but now I begin to tell too much.</p>
<p><em>Priscus</em>: He tells altogether too much. But that was his charm, except when he goes on altogether too long and becomes tedious. I know that you were initiated at Eleusis and doubtless feel much as he did about what is revealed there. I don&rsquo;t. It is possible that if I had gone through all the nonsense of initiation, I <em>might</em> have had a &ldquo;revelation&rdquo;. But I doubt it. There are some natures too coarse to apprehend the mysteries. Mine is one. Nowadays of course we can write with a certain freedom of the mysteries since they are drawing to an end. The Emperor is expected to shut down the Telestrion as soon as he feels the time is politically fight. Naturally, the bishops lust for the destruction of Eleusis,</p>
<p>which to me is the only argument for preserving it.</p>
<p>I am cool to the mysteries because I find them vague and full of unjustified hope. I do not want to be nothing next year or next minute or whenever this long life of mine comes to its end (of course it does not seem at all long to <em>me</em>, not long enough by half! ). Yet I suspect that &ldquo;nothing&rdquo; is my fate. Should it be otherwise, what can I do about it? To believe as poor Julian did that he was among the elect as a result of a nine-day ceremony, costing some fifteen drachmae, not counting extras, is to fall into the same nonsense we accuse the Christians of when we blame their bitter exclusivity and lunatic superstition.</p>
<p>I had no idea Macrina was so sensible until I read Julian&rsquo;s account of their conversation at Eleusis.</p>
<p>She might have made him a good wife. I had always assumed she only told him what he wanted to hear, like any other woman. She was rare, in her way; but not to my taste.</p>
<p>The remainder of Julian&rsquo;s stay in Athens was uneventful. He was personally popular. The Sophists all tried to curry favour with him. It is remarkable how men supposedly dedicated to philosophy and things of the mind are drawn to power; affecting scorn for the mighty, they are inevitably attracted to those who rule. When the powerful man is as amiable and philosophy-loving as Julian, the resulting attempt to capture him is all the more unseemly.</p>
<p><em>Libanius</em>: How typical of Priscus! He can hardly restrain his jealousy of me, and his resentment of my influence over Julian. Yet my interest in Julian was <em>not</em> self-seeking. How could it be? When I turned down the title of praetorian prefect, I said that the title Sophist was good enough for me. My gesture is still much remembered not only here in Antioch but everywhere philosophy is valued. Those of us who wish to lead others to wisdom respond to any questioning soul, prince or beggar. Sometimes, as in the case of Maximus, Julian showed bad judgment, but by and large he cultivated the best minds of our era.</p>
<p>I also find Priscus&rsquo;s remarks about Eleusis distasteful, even atheistic. Cicero, who was hardly superstitious, wrote that if all else Athens had brought the world was swept away, the mysteries alone would be enough to place mankind for ever in Athens&rsquo; debt. Priscus has got worse with age. Envy festers. He was never a true philosopher. I find myself pitying him as I read his bitter commentary.</p>
<p><em>Priscus</em>: In any case, when Julian looked with adoration at that ear of corn which is revealed with such solemnity at the highest moment of the ceremony…</p>
<p><em>Libanius</em>: This is absolute blasphemy! These things must not be revealed. Priscus will suffer for this in the next world, while who ever betrayed to him our high secret will sink for ever in dung. It is appalling!</p>
<p><em>Priscus</em>:… he felt duly elated, believing that as the corn withers, dies and is reborn, so it is with us. But is the analogy correct? [ would say no. For one thing, it is not the <em>same</em> ear of corn that grows from the kernel. It is a new ear of corn, which would suggest that our immortality, such as it is, is between our legs. Our seed does indeed make a new man but he is not us. The son is not the father. The father is put in the ground and that is the end of him. The son is a different man who will one day make yet another man and so on—perhaps for ever-yet the individual consciousness stops.</p>
<p><em>Libanius</em>: I hate Priscus! He is worse than a Christian. Homer believed. Was Homer wrong? Of course not.</p>
<p><em>Priscus</em>: Julian did nothing to offend the Christians in Athens, though it was fairly well known that he tended towards philosophy. But he was discreet. On at least one occasion he attended church.</p>
<p>The Hierophant liked him but thought he was doomed, or so he told me years later. The Hierophant was an interesting man. But of course you knew him for you were admitted to the mysteries during his reign. He realized with extraordinary clarity that our old world was ended. There were times, I think, when he took pleasure in knowing he was the last of a line that extended back two thousand years. Men are odd. If they cannot be first, they don&rsquo;t in the least mind being last.</p>
<p><em>Julian Augustus</em></p>
<p>Those marvellous days in Athens came to an abrupt end when an imperial messenger arrived with orders that I attend Constantius at Milan. No reason was given. I assumed that I was to be executed. Just such a message had been delivered to Gallus. I confess now to a moment of weakness. Walking alone in the agora, I considered flight. Should I disappear in the back streets of Athens? Change my name? Shave my head? Or should I take to the road like a New Cynic and walk to Pergamon or Nicomedia and lose myself among students, hide until I was forgotten, assumed dead, no longer dangerous?</p>
<p>Suddenly I opened my arms to Athena. I looked up to her statue on the acropolis, much to the astonishment of the passers-by (this took place in front of the Library of Pantainos). I prayed that I be allowed to remain in Athena&rsquo;s city, preferring death on the spot to departure. But the goddess did not answer. Sadly I dropped my arms. Just at that moment, Gregory emerged from the library and approached me with his wolf&rsquo;s grin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re leaving us,&rdquo; he said. There are no secrets in Athens. I told him that I was reluctant to go but the Emperor&rsquo;s will must be done.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be back,&rdquo; he said, taking my arm familiarly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you&rsquo;ll be the Caesar then, a man of state, with a diadem and guards and courtiers! It will be interesting to see just how our Julian changes when he is set over us like a god.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall be the same,&rdquo; I promised, sure of death.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Remember old friends in your hour of greatness.&rdquo; A scroll hidden in Gregory&rsquo;s belt dropped to the pavement. Blushing, he picked it up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have a special permit,&rdquo; he stammered. &ldquo;I can withdraw books, certain books, approved books…&rdquo;</p>
<p>I laughed at his embarrassment. He knew that I knew that the Pantainos Library never allows any book to be taken from the reading room. I said I would tell no one.</p>
<p>• • •
The proconsul treated me decently. He was a good man, but frightened. I recognized at once in his face the look of the official who does not know if one is about to be executed or raised to the throne. It must be cruelly perplexing for such men. If they are kind, they are then vulnerable to a later charge of conspiracy; if they are harsh, they may live to find their victim great and vindictive. The proconsul steered a middle course; he was correct; he was conscientious; he arranged for my departure the next morning.</p>
<p>My last evening in Athens is still too painful to describe. I spent it with Macrina. I vowed to return if I could. Next day, at first light, I left the city. I did not trust myself to look back at Athena&rsquo;s temple floating in air, or at the sun-struck violet line of Hymettos. Eyes to the east and the morning sun, I made the sad journey to Piraeus and the sea.</p>
