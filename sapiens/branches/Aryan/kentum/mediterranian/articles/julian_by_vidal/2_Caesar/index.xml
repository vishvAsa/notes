      <description>&lt;p&gt;At Turin, as I received city officials in the law court, a messenger arrived from Florentius, the praetorian prefect of Gaul. The prefect thought that the Caesar should know that some weeks ago Cologne had fallen to the Germans, and the Rhine was theirs. The military situation was, Florentius wrote with what almost seemed satisfaction, grave. The German King Chnodomar had sworn to drive every Roman from Gaul within the year. This was the bad news Constantius had not told me.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;On 22 June I left Vienne at the head of an army of twelve thousand men—cuirassiers, crossbowmen and infantry. The whole town came out to see us off. Florentius radiated irony, while Marcellus could hardly disguise his amusement. I am sure that they thought this was the last they would see of me.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Helena bade me farewell with stoic dignity. She was the essence of a Roman matron, quite prepared for me to return upon my shield. It was a sunny day as we rode out of the city. On my right was Sallust and on my left Oribasius. Directly in front of me a standardbearer carried a hideously lifelike image of Constantius, crowned and wearing the imperial robe. My cousin had recently sent me this effigy, with a long set of instructions on how I was to show it off. He also reminded me that I had not been sent to Gaul as monarch but as a representative of the Emperor whose principal task was to display the imperial robe and image to the people. Despite this small humiliation, I was in high spirits as we took to the road. We arrived at Autun 26 June. On that same day I defeated the Germans and set the city free. &lt;em&gt;Note&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;to secretary:&lt;/em&gt; At this point insert relevant chapter from my book, *The Gallic Wars *. It should be that section which covers the campaign from Autun to Auxerre to Troyes to Rheims, where I passed the month of August.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Julian Augustus&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Of the cities of Gaul, I like Paris the best and I spent three contented winters there. The town is on a small island in the River Seine. Wooden bridges connect it to both banks where the townspeople cultivate the land. It is lovely green country where almost anything will grow, even fig trees. My first winter I set out a dozen (jacketed in straw) and all but one survived. Of course the Paris winters are not as cold as those at Sens or Vienne because the nearness of the ocean warms the air. As a result, the Seine seldom freezes over; and its water—as anyone knows who has ever visited there—is remarkably sweet and good to drink. The town is built of wood and brick, with a fair-sized prefect&amp;rsquo;s palace which I used as headquarters. From my second-floor study, I could see the water as it divided at the island&amp;rsquo;s sharp tip, like the sea breaking on a ship&amp;rsquo;s prow. In fact, if one stares hard enough at that point in the river one has a curious sense of movement, of indeed being on a ship in full sail, the green shore rushing past.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;My third and last winter at Paris was crucial. I had heard nothing from Constantius directly or indirectly since the meeting with Florentius. The prefect preferred to stay at Vienne while I remained at Paris. We did not meet, though documents continually passed between us. Aware that there might soon be a crisis in our affairs, I proposed at one point that Florentius join me for the winter at Paris. But he declined. Obviously he wanted to keep what authority he could. In principle I was the master of Britain, Gaul, Spain and Morocco. In fact Florentius administered that part of Gaul which is south of Vienne, as well as Spain and Morocco. I controlled Britain. For the time being, we had tacitly agreed not to interfere in each other&amp;rsquo;s territories.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Julian Augustus&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I went straight to my wife&amp;rsquo;s room. She had already been told what had happened. She was sitting up in bed, attended by several women. Her hair had been combed and her sallow face was cruelly mocked by rouge. The women withdrew.&amp;ldquo;It is done,&amp;rdquo; I said.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Good.&amp;rdquo; She held my hands and for a moment I felt strength in her fingers. &amp;ldquo;Now there will be war.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I nodded. &amp;ldquo;But not immediately. I shall tell Constantius that this was none of my doing, and it was not. If he is wise, he will accept me as Augustus in the West.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;On 6 November 360, I celebrated my fifth year as Caesar, my &amp;ldquo;quinquennial&amp;rdquo;, as the Romans call it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I thought it wise to make a great event of this occasion. It is well known that I detest what goes on in hippodromes, whether games, fighting or the slaughter of animals. But there are certain things one must do in a high place and the giving of games is one of the most important. If the games are a success, one enjoys popularity with the mob. If not, not. It&amp;rsquo;s as simple as that. Though I have many times cursed those consuls of the old Republic who started this boring and costly business, I always do what is expected of me as well as I can with the means at hand.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
