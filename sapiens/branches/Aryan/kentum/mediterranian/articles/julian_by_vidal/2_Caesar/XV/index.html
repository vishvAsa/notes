I thought it wise to make a great event of this occasion. It is well known that I detest what goes on in hippodromes, whether games, fighting or the slaughter of animals. But there are certain things one must do in a high place and the giving of games is one of the most important. If the games are a success, one enjoys popularity with the mob. If not, not. It’s as simple as that. Though I have many times cursed those consuls of the old Republic who started this boring and costly business, I always do what is expected of me as well as I can with the means at hand.">

  <p>On 6 November 360, I celebrated my fifth year as Caesar, my &ldquo;quinquennial&rdquo;, as the Romans call it.</p>
<p>I thought it wise to make a great event of this occasion. It is well known that I detest what goes on in hippodromes, whether games, fighting or the slaughter of animals. But there are certain things one must do in a high place and the giving of games is one of the most important. If the games are a success, one enjoys popularity with the mob. If not, not. It&rsquo;s as simple as that. Though I have many times cursed those consuls of the old Republic who started this boring and costly business, I always do what is expected of me as well as I can with the means at hand.</p>
<p>I am told that the games at Vienne were a success. I cannot judge. I attended them as little as possible. But when I did appear, it was as Augustus. I wore a heavy gold crown which I am now quite used to, justifying it to myself as a symbol of the sun, which is God. I looked quite imperial that year.</p>
<p>Even Oribasius was satisfied; he could never endure the old purple fillet I usually wore in public. &ldquo;You look like a gymnasium director,&rdquo; he would complain.</p>
<p>Constantius and I exchanged polite letters on the death of Helena. Then in December I received the announcement that Constantius had married a lady of Antioch called Faustina. I sent him congratulations. Meanwhile, each of us prepared for civil war.</p>
<p>A number of significant things happened in December. One afternoon while I was practising with shield and sword (I do this nearly every day, because I came late to soldiering and must work harder than most to toughen muscles and learn the subtleties of combat), my shield broke loose from both the handle and the strap, and fell to the ground with a crash in full view of the Petulantes with whom I took exercise. Before anyone could interpret this as an ill omen, I said loudly, &ldquo;Look!&rdquo; And! held up the handle which I still clutched. &ldquo;I have what I was holding!&rdquo; This was taken to mean that I would hold Gaul, no matter what happened. But I was puzzled until that night when I dreamt that I saw again the guardian deity of Rome. He came to my bedside, and he spoke very plainly, in verse: When Zeus the noble Aquarius shall reach</p>
<p>When Saturn come to Virgo&rsquo;s twenty. fifth degree,</p>
<p>Then shall Constantius, K. of Asia, of this life so sweet,</p>
<p>The end attain with heaviness and grief.</p>
<p>This was as clear a statement as one could hope for from the gods. The next morning I told Oribasius, and he in turn called in Mastara, the best of the Etruscan astrologers. He cast Constantius&rsquo;s horoscope and found that the Emperor would indeed be dead within a few months. He even set the date as some time in June 361. But in spite of this celestial assurance, I took no chances. I continued to prepare for war.</p>
<p>• • •
I liked the praetorian prefect, Nebridius, though he did not like me, for the very reason I liked him: he was faithful to his master and I honoured him for that. Yet despite his loyalty to Constantius, he did not conspire against me. Because of this, I allowed him to carry out the ceremonial functions of praetorian prefect, though nothing more. Yet despite our cordial relations, he was always on the lookout for ways to trap me. He devised an excellent embarrassment.</p>
<p>On 6 January, the Gallleans celebrate something called the feast of the Epiphany. It is the day the</p>
<p>Galilean is supposed to have been baptized. Suspecting my dislike of the Galileans, Nebridius announced to the city that I would attend the feast of the Epiphany at the Vienne charnel house, a brand-new basilica paid for by Helena&rsquo;s numerous gifts to the bishops. I was furious but dared not show it. I am sorry to say Oribasius was amused at my predicament.</p>
<p>Grimly, I did what I had to do. I spent two hours meditating on the thighbone of some villain who had been eaten by lions at Rome, while the bishop delivered a considerable sermon at me, praying that I would throw the weight of my majesty against the enemy Arians. He even turned political by suggesting that as Constantius was Arian and I <em>possibly</em> Athanasian, the line might then be drawn between us in all things, and the side of &ldquo;truth&rdquo; (also the side of the majority, he added pointedly) would prevail, supporting my throne like columns, I believe was his metaphor, or it may have been holy caryatids.</p>
<p>When it came time to pray, my words were addressed to the Galilean but my heart spoke to Zeus.</p>
<p>The winter was a time of waiting. I was now ready to march. All that I needed was a sign from heaven. Though the prefect at Rome would not allow my emissaries to consult the Sibylline books, a friendly priest of the old order was able to look at a part of that book which describes our period.</p>
<p>According to his secret report, I would indeed be the next emperor. My reign would be stormy but long.</p>
<p>That is all I ask for: time. Time to make an old world young again, to make winter spring, to free the One God from the triple monster of the atheists. Give me twenty years, O Helios, and I will fill the earth with praise for your light, and illuminate the dark windings of Hades&rsquo; kingdom! Even as Persephone returned to Demeter, so shall our time&rsquo;s living-dead return to your arms, which are light, which is life, which is all!</p>
<p>In April I learned that the German tribe of King Vadomar had crossed the Rhine and was devastating the area near Raetia. This was particularly puzzling news because two years before we had negotiated a &ldquo;final&rdquo; peace with Vadomar. He had no grievance against us. He was a cultivated man, educated at Milan. He was by nature cautious. To any show of force he always responded with a thousand apologies and a quick withdrawal to his own side of the river. That Vadomar was now actively in the field against me could mean only one thing. He was acting on Constantius&rsquo;s orders. I sent Vadomar one of my counts, a man called Libino. He was a good soldier and negotiator, or so I thought.</p>
<p>I sent him with half a legion and orders to reason with Vadomar. Should reason fail, threats of extinction were in order. Libino got as far as Sechingen on the Rhine. There the Germans surrounded him. Unfortunately, Libino was eager for battle, even though his mission was only to negotiate. Like a fool, he ordered his men to attack. Five minutes later, Libino himself was hacked in two by a German sword, and his men, outnumbered five to one, were massacred.</p>
<p>I then dispatched the Petulantes to the Rhine only to find that the savages had faded into their forests, as mysteriously as they had appeared. For the moment all was peaceful on the Rhine. Now ordinarily I would have taken this for what it seemed to be: a single raid by restless tribesmen, conducted without the knowledge of Vadomar, who all the while was writing me long and eloquent letters, offering to punish his own people, <em>if</em> of course the guilty ones were his. He even sent a gift of money to the family of the dead Libino.</p>
<p>I did not believe Vadomar, but I was willing to forget the matter until one of the border guards intercepted a German messenger bound for the East. The messenger was found to be carrying a letter from Vadomar to Constantius. I quote from it: &ldquo;Your will is being done, Lord, and your Caesar who lacks discipline will be chastened.&rdquo; That was all [ needed. I promptly sent one of my notaries, a clever chap named Philogius, to join the Petulantes who were still at Sechingen, close to the country of Vadomar.</p>
<p><em>Libanius</em>: I feel compelled to note that this same &ldquo;clever chap named Philogius&rdquo; has just been</p>
<p>appointed Count of the East by Theodosius. He is a dedicated Christian and no one knows how we shall fare under his rule. If only Julian had sent <em>him</em> instead of the long-forgotten Libino to that fatal rendezvous on the Rhine! But then, were it not he, fate would no doubt find us a worse Philogius. The Count arrived in Antioch early this month. I saw him for the first time yesterday in the senate. He moved amongst us like a swan who has found himself in a particularly small and distasteful pond. Do I dare mention Julian to him?</p>
<p><em>Julian Augustus</em></p>
<p>I gave Philogius sealed instructions. If he encountered Vadomar on <em>our</em> side of the Rhine, he was to open the letter and do as he was told. Otherwise, the letter was to be destroyed. I was fairly certain that he would see Vadomar, who often travelled in our territory, visiting Roman friends. Like so many German nobles, he was in some ways more Roman than the Romans.</p>
<p>Philogius met Vadomar at a reception given by a local contractor. Philogius invited the king to dinner the next day at the officers&rsquo; mess of the Petulantes. Vadomar said that he would be delighted to dine with such distinguished men. When he arrived for dinner, Philogius excused himself, saying that he had forgotten to give certain instructions to the cook. He then read my letter. In it I commanded him to arrest Vadomar for high treason. Philogius did so, to the astonishment of his guest.</p>
<p>A week later, Vadomar was brought to me at Vienne. I received him alone in my study. He is a handsome, blue-eyed man, with a face red from hard drink and cold winters. But his manners are as polished as any Roman courtier&rsquo;s. He speaks excellent Greek. He was very frightened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have made a bad choice, King,&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>He stammered: he did not know what I meant. I gave him the letter we had intercepted. The red face became blotchy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did as I was told, Augustus…&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the letter you call me Caesar.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no, Augustus. That is, I <em>had</em> to when I wrote to him. He&rsquo;d ordered me to attack you. What could I do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You might have honoured your treaty with me. Or you might have made a better choice, as I suggested originally. You might have chosen me instead of Constantius as your master.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I do, great Lord. I do *now! * I always have. Only…&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t!&rdquo; I stopped him with a gesture. I take no pleasure in seeing another man grovel before me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Actually, you—and your correspondence—have been very useful to me.&rdquo; I took the letter back from him. &ldquo;I now have proof that not only does Constantius mean to destroy me, he incites the barbarians against his own people. Now I know what to do, and how to do it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what will you do, Augustus?&rdquo; Vadomar was momentarily distracted from his own fate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do? I shall exile you to Spain.&rdquo; He fell on his face in gratitude, and it was with difficulty that I extracted myself from his embrace, and turned him over to the guards. I sent for Oribasius. I have never been so elated in my life.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re ready!&rdquo; I shouted when he joined me. &ldquo;Everything is ready!&rdquo; I don&rsquo;t recall now what else I said. I suppose I &ldquo;babbled&rdquo;, as Priscus calls my talk during seizures of enthusiasm. I do remember that Oribasius, always the most conservative of advisers, agreed entirely with me. It was now or never. There remained only one possible obstacle, the mood of the legions. Some were still adamant about leaving Gaul.</p>
<p>Together we studied the military roster. Those units prone to mutiny we sent as permanent garrisons to the farther cities of Gaul. The remainder would assemble at full strength on 25 June, when it would</p>
<p>be my task to rouse them for the war against Constantius. Never was an orator given greater challenge. I rehearsed my speech every day for three weeks. Oribasius coached me until he too knew every word by heart.</p>
<p>At dawn on the 25th, Oribasius and I met with several officers of like mind in a small chapel off the council chamber. There I made special offering to Bellona, goddess of battles. The omens were propitious. Then, nervous at the thought of the speech ahead, I went forth in full regalia to review the legions who were gathered in a field outside the city, just beyond the gate through which I had arrived in Vienne five years before, a green boy with a handful of troops who knew only how to pray. I thought of this as I made my way to the stone tribunal, my neck rigid beneath its burden of gold.</p>
<p>I do not have a copy of this speech with me. In fact, my chief secretary seems to have packed none of my personal files though I <em>especially</em> asked that they be brought with us, knowing that I would be composing this memoir in Persia. Nevertheless, I recall most of what I said, even down to the gestures which I find myself reproducing as I repeat the words I said two years ago. I will not weary the reader with a catalogue of gestures, nor every word of the peroration. I will only say that I was at my best.</p>
<p>First, I addressed the army as &ldquo;Noble soldiers&rdquo;. This is an unusual way to style an army, and it caused much comment. Yet I wanted to emphasize to them their importance to me and my respect for them. I spoke of all that we had done together against the Germans and the Franks. &ldquo;But now that I am Augustus, I shall, with your support and that of the Deity—should fortune honour us—aim at greater things. To forestall those in the East who wish us ill, I propose that while the garrisons of Illyricum are still small, we take possession of all Dacia and then decide what more must be done. In support of this plan, I want, under oath, your promise of a lasting and faithful accord. For my part, I will do all that I can to avoid both weakness and timidity. I also swear that I will undertake nothing that does not contribute to us all. I only beg you: do nothing to hurt private citizens, for we are known to the world not only as the victors of the Rhine but as men whose right conduct in victory has made half a world prosperous and free.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was more in this vein. At the end, by various cries and loud oaths, they swore that they would follow me to the end of the earth, something of an exaggeration since their immediate interest was the spoils to be got as the result of what they knew would be an easy campaign in Dacia.</p>
<p>When I asked them to swear the oath of allegiance to me as Augustus, they did so, swords to their throats. Then I turned to the officers and officials gathered about the stone tribunal:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you, too, swear allegiance to me, in God&rsquo;s name Y&rsquo; I asked according to ritual. All swore, except Nebridius. There was a menacing growl from the troops.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will not swear allegiance to me, Prefect?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Caesar. I have already sworn an oath to uphold the Emperor. Since he still lives, I cannot swear again without jeopardizing my soul.&rdquo; His voice trembled, but not his will. Only I heard his whole speech, for on the word &ldquo;Caesar&rdquo; the men roared their anger. Swords were drawn. A legionnaire grabbed Nebridius by the neck and was about to throw him in the dust when I quickly stepped down from the tribunal and put myself between the soldier and the prefect. Nebridius, pale as death, clung to my knees. I removed my cloak and threw it over him: the ancient gesture which means a man has the protection of the emperor. Then I shouted to the legions, &ldquo;He will suffer quite enough when we are masters of Rome!&rdquo; This bit of demagoguery distracted the men, and I ordered Nebridius taken under guard to the palace.</p>
<p>I then reviewed the troops. It was a fine sight, and all the doubts which had tormented me in the night were dispelled by the bluegreen summer day and the sight of twenty thousand men marching in rhythmic unison to the Pyrrhic measure. It is at such moments that one realizes war is an essential aspect of deity, and that the communion of an army is a mystery in its way quite as beautiful as that of Eleusis.</p>
<p>For a moment all hearts beat to the same music. We were one and there was nothing on earth we could not do! When I returned to the palace, I sent for the stubborn Nebridius. I exiled him to Tuscany. He had expected death. With tears in his eyes he said, &ldquo;Caesar, give me your hand. Let me… in gratitude…&rdquo;</p>
<p>But I pulled back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There would be no honour nor sign of affection for me to give to my friends, if I gave <em>you</em> my hand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That was the end of Nebridius in Gaul.</p>
<p>• • •
On 3 July I took the field against Constantius. The omens were excellent and the weather fair.</p>
<p>We moved east to Augst, where I called a staff meeting. As usual, I had kept my plans to myself; not even Oribasius knew what I intended, though we rode together, ate together and chattered like schoolboys.</p>
<p>With me as commanders were Nevitta—the great Frank whom I come to admire more and more as I know him; Jovinus, a competent officer; Gomoarius, a man I did not trust, for he was the one who betrayed his commander Vetranio when he rebelled against Constantius; Mamertinus, a good secretary; Dagalaif, perhaps the best commander of cavalry in the history of the Roman army. I began with the announcement that Sallust was now on his way to Vienne to act as praetorian prefect; he would govern in my place. This was well received. Sallust is admired not only by me but by all men.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I now have certain appointments to make.&rdquo; I did not have to consult the sheet of paper before me. I got the disagreeable task over with first. &ldquo;Gomoarius, I remove you as commander of cavalry. That post goes to Nevitta.&rdquo; There was silence. Gomoarius said nothing. All knew my motive. We are a small family, the military, despite the size of the empire. We all know one another&rsquo;s faults and virtues.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jovinus, I make you quaestor; Mamertinus, treasurer; Dagalaif, commander of the household troops.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then I went over the map on the folding table. &ldquo;We are outnumbered ten to one by the combined armies of Illyricum and Italy. Fortunately, those armies are not combined. They consist mostly of garrison troops, while ours is an aggressive army, used to swift attack. Now, what is our best course of action?&rdquo; I paused. They took my question for the rhetoric it was. &ldquo;When in doubt, imitate Alexander.</p>
<p>Whenever his army was seriously outnumbered, he would disperse his troops in such a way as to give the impression that he had far more men than anyone knew. Therefore I mean to split the army in three sections. We shall seem to be attacking from every direction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jovinus will take the direct route to Italy.&rdquo; I pointed to the map. &ldquo;You will notice I have marked the main roads for you. Spread out along them. I want everyone to see you. Nevitta, you take the middle course, due west through Raetia. I shall take the remainder of the army and go north through the Black Forest to the Danube. Then west and south along the Danube, straight to Sirmium. Whoever holds Sirmium controls Illyricum and the approach to Constantinople.&rdquo; I turned to Nevitta. &ldquo;You and I will rendezvous at Sirmium, no later than October.&rdquo;</p>
<p>None objected to my plan. Incidentally, for those who may get the impression from history that divine emperors are never contradicted by those who serve them, I should note that such is not the case in the field. Though the emperor&rsquo;s word is final, any commander is free to argue with him as much as he likes until the war plan is actually set in motion. Personally, I have always encouraged debate. Often as not it deteriorates into quibbling, but occasionally one&rsquo;s strategy is improved. This time, however, there was little discussion, only the usual arguments as to who got what legion. The next day the army was divided, and the conquest of the West began.</p>
<p>The Black Forest is a strange and ominous place. Seeing it from within made me understand the Germans better. The place is haunted; perverse demons lurk in every shadow… and what shadows! Even at noon, the forest is so dim that it is like being drowned in a deep green whispering sea. As we rode over quiet trails, the legions, two abreast, wound like some slow sea-serpent on the ocean floor.</p>
<p>Fortunately, we had reliable guides who knew every twist and turn of the forest. I cannot think how, for there were no markers of any kind; yet they knew their way through the green maze. For days on end we never saw the sun, until I despaired of ever seeing my god again.</p>
<p>• • •
By the middle of August we were in the wild but beautiful valley of the Danube. Though the river is not as impressive to look at as the Rhine, it is far less treacherous to navigate. So I decided to make the rest of the iourney by water.</p>
<p>At a village on the south bank, we halted and I ordered boats built. While this was being done, I received the fealty of the local tribes. They were amazed to see a Roman emperor (even a not quite legitimate one!) so far north. When they discovered that I meant them no harm, they were most cooperative and offered to act as river pilots. They are a handsome, fair-skinned people, somewhat shy.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, messengers from Jovinus arrived, with good news. Milan had fallen. He also wrote me the latest news of Constantius. Sapor had advanced to the Tigris. Constantius had then withdrawn to Edessa, where he was now holed up, avoiding battle. I was amused to note that he had appointed Florentius praetorian prefect of Illyricum. I was obviously poor Florentius&rsquo;s nemesis. I had sent him out of Gaul; soon I would drive him from Illyricum. I believe of all those who hate me, he must hate me the most. He certainly has the best reason!</p>
<p>We sailed down the Danube through a golden country, rich with harvest. We paused at none of the towns or fortresses which became more numerous the farther south we went. There was no time to waste. If I took Sirmium, all these towns would be mine by right, but if I paused to lay siege to each I should never be done fighting. Most of the natives were well disposed towards us; but then none was put to the test.</p>
<p>In early October, at night, with the moon waning, we reached Bonmunster, nineteen miles north of Sirmium. It is a small town, with no garrison. Late as it was, I ordered all men ashore. We pitched camp on the bank of the river.</p>
<p>I do not know if it is common to all in my place, but it was my experience as a usurper (and one must call me by that blunt name) that everywhere I went well-wishers and informers flocked to me like bees to honey, until I was forced to devise a screening process to examine each would-be ally and determine if he could be used. Most proved to be sincere; but then I proved to be victorious! Before the moon had set, I had learned that Count Lucillianus was at Sirmium, with a considerable army and orders to destroy me. However, Lucillianus did not expect me in the vicinity for another week, and so he slept now at Sirmium.</p>
<p>As soon as I had heard these reports, I sent for Dagalaif. I ordered him to go straight to Sirmium with a hundred men; he was to seize Lucillianus and bring him back. This was a considerable assignment, but I knew from spies that the city was no more than usually guarded and that the palace where Lucillianus was staying was close to the gate. At night our men would look no different from any other imperial troops; there would be no problem entering the city. For the rest, I counted on Dagaliaf&rsquo;s boldness and ingenuity.</p>
<p>After Dagalaif had left, Oribasius and I strolled together on the river bank. It was a warm night. In the black sky a misshapen moon, like a worn marble head, made all the country silver. Behind us the fires and torches of the camp burned. The men were quiet; they had orders to make no unnecessary noise; only the horses occasionally disobeyed me, with sharp sudden whinnies. At the top of the river bank we stopped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I like this,&rdquo; I said, turning to Oribasius, who was seated now on a rock, staring at the bright diagonal</p>
<p>the moonlight made across the slow deep water.</p>
<p>Oribasius looked up at me. The moon was so bright that I could make out his features. &ldquo;This?&rdquo; He frowned. &ldquo;Do you mean the river? or war? or travel?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Life.&rdquo; I sat on the damp ground beside him and crossed my legs, muddying the purple I wore. &ldquo;Not war. Nor travel. Just this. Right now.&rdquo; I sighed. &ldquo;I can hardly believe we have crossed nearly half the world. I feel like the wind, without a body, invisible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He laughed. &ldquo;You are probably the most visible man on earth, and the most feared.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Feared,&rdquo; I repeated, wondering if I would ever take satisfaction from the knowledge that men&rsquo;s lives and fortunes could be taken from them at a nod of my head. No, I cannot enjoy that sort of power; it is not what I want.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What <em>do</em> you want?&rdquo; Oribasius had divined my mood, as he so often does.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To restore the gods.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But if they are real and do exist…&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are real! There is no &lsquo;if&rsquo;! They do exist!&rdquo; I was fierce. His laughter stopped me. &ldquo;Then they exist.</p>
<p>But if they exist, they are always present, and so there&rsquo;s no need to &lsquo;restore&rsquo; them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But we must worship what God tells us to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So the Christians say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, but theirs is a false god, and I mean to destroy them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Oribasius stiffened at the word &ldquo;destroy&rdquo;. &quot; <em>Kill</em> them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. I shall not allow them the pleasure of martyrdom. Besides, at the rate they kill one another, it would be gratuitous for me to intervene. No, I shall fight them with reason and example. I shall reopen the temples and reorganize the priesthood. We shall put Hellenism on such a footing that people will choose it of their own free will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder.&rdquo; Oribasius was thoughtful. &ldquo;They are rich, wellorganized. Most important, they educate the children.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We shall do the same!&rdquo; I was thinking as I spoke; I had no plan. &ldquo;Even better, we could take the schools away from them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you could…&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Emperor can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It might work. Otherwise…&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Otherwise?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You would have to reign as a bloody tyrant and even then you&rsquo;d lose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not so pessimistic.&rdquo; But Oribasius had put an idea into my head, one which will save us all.</p>
<p>Curiously enough, though we had often spoken of what it would be like when I became emperor, none of us had ever really considered in much detail what form the contest between Hellenism and the Galileans would take. We agreed that when I could I would publicly repudiate the Nazarene, but none of us had thought what the reaction might be, particularly from the common people of whom perhaps half are Galilean. Only the army is truly religious. The men worship Mithras. There are few Galileans in the ranks, though a third of the officers believe in the triple monster.</p>
<p>We talked until it was morning. Just as the sun appeared over the world&rsquo;s edge, like an omen, Dagalaif returned to camp with Count Lucillianus as prisoner.</p>
<p>I hurried to my tent. There on the ground in his nightclothes was Lucillianus, trussed like a chicken.</p>
<p>He was terrified. For a moment I looked down on the shivering body, recalling that the last time I had seen him he had been my brother&rsquo;s jailer. Then I loosened his bonds and raised him to his feet. This friendly gesture somewhat relieved his anxiety. He is a large man, given to peculiar diets. For years he</p>
<p>would eat only udder of sow; at least that is the story one hears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are happy you could attend us on such short notice, Count.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I was formal but agreeable.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If only I had known, Caesar… I mean Augustus… I should have met you myself…&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And put me to death, like Gallus?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Those were my orders, Augustus, but you may depend on my loyalty to you in this dispute. I have always been loyal. I have always preferred you to the Emp– to <em>him</em> at Antioch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We accept your loyalty, your troops, your city of Sirmium, and the prefecture of Illyricum.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He gasped but bowed. &ldquo;Such is the will of Augustus. All these are yours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, Count.&rdquo; I was in an excellent mood. Lucillianus is the sort of man who does not think ahead—witness his failure to anticipate my arrival—and men who do not think ahead tend to accept what is; they never conspire. I said, &ldquo;Now swear your oath to me.&rdquo; He swore; and kissed the purple, getting a bit of Danube mud on his face. &ldquo;You will retain your rank, Count, and serve in my army.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lucillianus&rsquo;s recovery was swift. &ldquo;If I may say so, Lord, it is a very rash thing you have done, coming here with such a small army in the midst of someone else&rsquo;s territory.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Reserve, my dear Count, your wisdom for Constantius. I have given you my hand not to make you my counsellor but less afraid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I turned to Mamertinus. &ldquo;Give the word to the army. We march to Sirmium.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sirmium is a large city, highly suitable for an imperial capital, standing as it does upon the border between the prefecture of Illyricum and the diocese of Thrace—the westernmost country of the prefecture of the East. I was now at the beginning of the territory traditionally assigned to the Augustus of the East. I had warned my officers that there might be incidents. I did not expect the city to surrender without token resistance, even though its commander was now with us, riding at my side. But to my astonishment, we were met outside the gates by a vast crowd of men, women and children, carrying chains of flowers, boughs of trees and numerous sacred objects. I was hailed as Augustus with the most extraordinary enthusiasm. I turned to Lucillianus and shouted to him above the din, &ldquo;Did you arrange this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He shook his head. He was too stupid to lie. &ldquo;No, Augustus. I don&rsquo;t know who arranged it…&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Legend!&rdquo; said Oribasius. &ldquo;They know you&rsquo;ll win. They always do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A large bouquet of flowers hit me in the face. Eyes stinging, I swept it aside; a blood-red poppy caught in my beard. Men and women kissed my robe, my legs, my horse. Thus was I escorted into the capital of Illyricum while the grapes were still green. It was the first great city ever to fall to me, twice the size of Strasbourg or Cologne or even Treyes. The date was 3 October 361. I went straight to the palace, and to business. I received the senate of the city. I allayed their fears. They swore loyalty to me, as did the legions within the city. I ordered a week of chariot races next day to amuse the populace, one of the burdens the conquered invariably put upon the conqueror. With great pleasure I received Nevitta who, true to his promise, arrived at Sirmium after a victorious passage through Raetia. The West was ours.</p>
<p>I called a staff meeting, and we discussed our next move. Some favoured marching straight to Constantinople, two hundred miles distant. Dagalaif argued that with Constantius in Antioch, Constantinople would fall to us without a battle. Nevitta was not so certain. He was afraid that Constantius was probably already on the march from Antioch to the capital. If this were so, we were hardly a match for what was, in fact, the largest army on earth. I agreed with Nevitta. We would remain where we were for the winter.</p>
<p>I entrusted to Nevitta the defence of the Succi Pass, a narrow defile in the high mountains that</p>
<p>separate Thrace from Illyricum. Whoever holds this pass is safe from attack by land. I then sent two of the Sirmium legions to Aquileia, to hold that important seaport for us. With the main part of the army I withdrew some fifty miles north-west to Nish (where Constantine was born); here I went into winter quarters.</p>
<p>The weeks at Nish were busy ones. Every night I dictated until dawn. I was determined to present my case against Constantius as clearly as possible for all to read and comprehend. I sent a lengthy message to the Roman senate. I also composed separate letters for the senates of Sparta, Corinth and Athens, explaining what I had done and what I intended to do. Heavily but justly, I placed the blame for all that had happened on Constantius. Then—though Oribasius warned me not to—I assured the various senates that I intended to restore the worship of the old gods, making the point that I personally imitated them in order that, by having the fewest possible needs, I might do good to the greatest possible number. These letters were read at every public gathering. They made a profound and favourable impression.</p>
<p>During this period I planned an amphibious attack on Constantinople to take place as soon as the winds favoured us. We were in a good position militarily. At Succi we controlled the land approach to the West. At Aquileia we controlled the sea approach to northern Italy. I felt reasonably secure, and was confident that before civil war broke out, Constantius would come to terms with me. But my sense of security was rudely shattered when I learned that the two legions I had sent to Aquileia had promptly gone over to Constantius. The port was now his, and I was vulnerable to an attack by sea. Since I was not able to leave Nish and Nevitta could not leave Succi, my only hope was Jovinus, who was in Austria en route to Nish. I sent him a frantic message: proceed immediately to Aquileia. My situation was now most precarious. Constantius could at any time land an army at Aquileia and cut me off from Italy and Gaul. I was in despair, confident that the gods had deserted me. But they had not. At the last moment, they intervened. On the night of 20 November I was working late. Lamps filled with cheap oil smoked abominably. The three night secretaries sat at a long table, mountains of parchment stacked in front of them.</p>
<p>At a separate table I was writing a letter to my uncle Julian, trying to reassure him—and myself—that victory was certain. I had just finished the letter with one of those postscripts which even old friends say they cannot decipher, when I heard footsteps quickly approaching. Without ceremony the door flew open. The clerks and I leapt to our feet. One never knows if assassins are at hand. But it was Oribasius, out of breath, a letter in his hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s happened!&rdquo; he gasped. Then he did something he had never done before. He dropped on his knees before me, and offered me the letter. &ldquo;This is for you… Augustus.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I read the first line. Then the words blurred together and I could read no more. &ldquo;Constantius is dead.&rdquo; As I said those extraordinary words, the clerks one by one fell to their knees. Then, as in a dream, the room began to fill with people. All knew what had happened. All paid me silent homage for I had, miraculously, with the stopping of one man&rsquo;s breath, become sole Augustus, Emperor of Rome, Lord of the world. To my astonishment, I wept.</p>
