  <meta property="og:description" content="On 22 June I left Vienne at the head of an army of twelve thousand men—cuirassiers, crossbowmen and infantry. The whole town came out to see us off. Florentius radiated irony, while Marcellus could hardly disguise his amusement. I am sure that they thought this was the last they would see of me.
Helena bade me farewell with stoic dignity. She was the essence of a Roman matron, quite prepared for me to return upon my shield. It was a sunny day as we rode out of the city. On my right was Sallust and on my left Oribasius. Directly in front of me a standardbearer carried a hideously lifelike image of Constantius, crowned and wearing the imperial robe. My cousin had recently sent me this effigy, with a long set of instructions on how I was to show it off. He also reminded me that I had not been sent to Gaul as monarch but as a representative of the Emperor whose principal task was to display the imperial robe and image to the people. Despite this small humiliation, I was in high spirits as we took to the road. We arrived at Autun 26 June. On that same day I defeated the Germans and set the city free. Note to secretary: At this point insert relevant chapter from my book, *The Gallic Wars *. It should be that section which covers the campaign from Autun to Auxerre to Troyes to Rheims, where I passed the month of August.">

  <p>On 22 June I left Vienne at the head of an army of twelve thousand men—cuirassiers, crossbowmen and infantry. The whole town came out to see us off. Florentius radiated irony, while Marcellus could hardly disguise his amusement. I am sure that they thought this was the last they would see of me.</p>
<p>Helena bade me farewell with stoic dignity. She was the essence of a Roman matron, quite prepared for me to return upon my shield. It was a sunny day as we rode out of the city. On my right was Sallust and on my left Oribasius. Directly in front of me a standardbearer carried a hideously lifelike image of Constantius, crowned and wearing the imperial robe. My cousin had recently sent me this effigy, with a long set of instructions on how I was to show it off. He also reminded me that I had not been sent to Gaul as monarch but as a representative of the Emperor whose principal task was to display the imperial robe and image to the people. Despite this small humiliation, I was in high spirits as we took to the road. We arrived at Autun 26 June. On that same day I defeated the Germans and set the city free. <em>Note</em> <em>to secretary:</em> At this point insert relevant chapter from my book, *The Gallic Wars *. It should be that section which covers the campaign from Autun to Auxerre to Troyes to Rheims, where I passed the month of August.</p>
<p><em>Priscus</em>: As Julian described, Sallust on his right, Oribasius on his left, and myself just behind. His official account of the campaign is generally accurate. From Julius Caesar on, commanders tend to give themselves the best of it in their memoirs, but Julian was usually honest. Of course he tended not to mention his mistakes. He does not tell how he lost the better part of a legion through carelessness: he sent them through a forest where he had been warned that there were Germans… and there were Germans. But in general, Julian was a cautious commander. He seldom committed a man unless he was certain that the odds were in his favour. Or so the experts assure us. I know practically nothing of military matters, even though I served with Julian both in Gaul and Persia. I was not of course a soldier, though I did fight from time to time, with no pleasure. I experienced none of that blood lust he referred to some pages back, a rather surprising admission because in conversation Julian never once admitted to a liking for war.</p>
<p>Sallust took care of all details. He was most capable and in every way an admirable man. Too admirable, perhaps? One often had the feeling that he was playing a part (usually that of Marcus Aurelius); he was invariably demure and diffident and modest and sensible, all those things the world believes it admires. Which is the point. Less self-conscious men invariably have traits we do not admire.</p>
<p>The good and the bad are all mixed together. Sallust was all good. That must have taken intense selfdiscipline as well as the awareness that he was indeed trying to be something he was not. But no matter what his motives, he was impressive, and a good influence on Julian.</p>
<p>Julian lifted the siege at Autun. He then marched north to Auxerre. He rested there a few days. He always took every possible opportunity to refresh his troops, unlike so many generals who drive them past their strength. From Auxerre we moved to Troyes. This was a difficult journey. We were continually harassed by Germans. They are a frightening-looking people, tall and muscular, with long hair dyed bright red, a tribal custom. They dress pretty much like us, wearing armour pilfered from Roman corpses. In open country, they are easily vanquished, but in forests they are dangerous.</p>
<p>At Troyes we spent several hours outside the walls trying to explain to the frightened garrison that we were not Germans and that this was indeed the Caesar. Finally Julian himself, with that &ldquo;hideously lifelike&rdquo; image of Constantius beside him, ordered the people to open the gates.</p>
<p>We stayed at Troyes a day. Then we moved on to Rheims. Julian had previously agreed with Florentius that the main army of Gaul would be concentrated there in August, preparatory to retaking Cologne. So Marcellus was already at Rheims when we got there. Shortly after we arrived, a military council was called. Weary from the long ride and longing for the baths, I accompanied Julian and Sallust to the meeting.</p>
<p>Marcellus was hardly pleased to find Julian so obviously thriving on military life. When Julian inquired if the troops were ready, he was told that they were not. When would they be ready? Evasion.</p>
<p>Finally: a major offensive was not possible this year.</p>
<p>Then Julian rose and lied with the genius of a Ulysses. I could hardly believe my ears. He spoke first in sorrow. &ldquo;I had hoped to find all of you here eager and ready to fight the tribes. Instead, I find nothing is planned and we are on the defensive, as usual.&rdquo; Marcellus began to mutter dangerously but Julian was in full flow. You know what he was like when the spirit {often identified as Helios) was upon him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was sent here, General, by the divine Emperor to show his image to the barbarians. I was also sent here to recover the cities you have lost. I was sent here to drive the savages back to their forests beyond the Rhine. I have sworn as Caesar to conquer them or to die.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But Caesar, we…&rdquo; That was all Marcellus was allowed to say. As Julian talked through him, he withdrew a document from his tunic. It was the booklet on etiquette that Constantius had given him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you see this, General? All of you?&rdquo; Julian waved it like a standard in the air. No one could tell what it was exactly, but the imperial seal was perfectly visible.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is from the divine Emperor. It is to me. It arrived by special messenger at Autun. It contains orders. We are to regain Cologne. Those are his commands and we are his slaves. We have no choice but to obey.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was consternation on Marcellus&rsquo;s side of the council table. No one had heard of these instructions for the excellent reason that they did not exist. But the bold lie worked largely because Marcellus was a true politician in the sense that he could not admit that there was anything which he ought to know that in fact he did not know. He gave Julian the army.</p>
<p><em>Julian Augustus</em></p>
<p>At Rheims I reviewed the legions as they marched through the city gates, all of us sweating in the hot August sun. It was a lowering day, humid and ill-omened. As I stood on the platform outside the city gate, gnats whirring about my head and sweat trickling down my face, a message from Vienne was handed to me. It was a brief note from Florentius. My wife had been delivered of a boy who had died shortly afterwards. She was in good health. That was all.</p>
<p>It is an odd thing to be the father of a son and the grieving father of a dead son, all in the same instant. I handed the letter to Sallust. Then I turned back to the legions who were marching rhythmically now in Pyrrhic measure to the sound of pipes.</p>
<p><em>Priscus</em>: The midwife cut too short the child&rsquo;s umbilical cord. We later learned that she had been paid to do this by the Empress Eusebia. Yet I never heard Julian refer to Eusebia in any but the most glowing terms. It is sad how tangled the relations among princes become… What a ridiculous statement!</p>
<p>We are all in the habit of censuring the great, as if we were popular playwrights, when in fact ordinary folk are quite as devious and as wilful and as desperate to survive (if not to prevail) as are the great;</p>
<p>particularly philosophers.</p>
<p>Julian skips the rest of that year&rsquo;s campaign with a note that a section from his earlier book will be inserted. That will be your task. Personally, I find his book on the Gallic wars almost as boring as Julius Caesar&rsquo;s. I say &ldquo;almost&rdquo; because a description of something one has lived through can never be entirely dull. But descriptions of battles soon pall. I would suggest—although you have not asked for my literary advice—that you keep the military inserts to a minimum.</p>
<p>Julian&rsquo;s autumn campaign was a success. He fought a set battle at Brumath which strategists regard as a model of brilliant warfare. I wouldn&rsquo;t know. At the time I thought it confusing, but it opened the road to Cologne. That part of the world, by the way, is quite lovely, especially a spot called the Confluence, whereobviously—two rivers join, the Moselle and the Rhine, at a town called Remagen—ours; just past Remagen is an old Roman tower which commands the countryside. Not far from gemagen is Cologne, which to everyone&rsquo;s amazement Julian regained, after a brief battle.</p>
<p>We remained at Cologne all of September. Julian was in excellent form. Several of the Frankish chiefs paid him court and he both charmed and awed them, a rare gift which he apparently shared, if one is to trust Cicero, with Julius Caesar.</p>
<p>A light note of no consequence: Oribasius bet me one gold piece that Constantius would take revenge on Julian for lying to Marcellus. I bet him that he would not. I won the gold piece. We then spent the winter at Sens, a depressing provincial town north of Vienne. It was nearly the last winter for all of us.</p>
<p><em>Julian Augustus</em></p>
<p>After the victories described, I went into winter quarters at a pleasant town called Sens whose particular virtue was that it kept me at a proper distance from Florentius at Vienne and Marcellus at Rheims.</p>
<p>During those months Helena kept much to herself. She had several ladies with her from the court at Milan and I think that she was reasonably content, though she was not in good health: because of her age, the birth had been a difficult one. I was always ill at ease with Helena. I could hardly forget that she was the sister of my enemy. For a long time I was uncertain to which of us she was loyal. I do know that she kept up a considerable correspondence with her brother (since destroyed; by whom? very mysterious); as a result, I was careful to say nothing in her presence which might make Constantius suspicious. This self-restraint was a considerable burden for me.</p>
<p>Only once did Helena reveal that she had some idea of what was in my mind and heart. It was in December. We had dined frugally in my office, which was easier to heat than the state apartments.</p>
<p>Several braziers gave forth sufficient heat—at least for me; Priscus used to complain bitterly of my meanness in this regard. Helena sat with her ladies at the opposite end of the room, listening to one of the women sing Greek songs, while Oribasius, Sallust, Priscus and I reclined on couches at the other end of the room.</p>
<p>We spoke idly at first, as one does after supper. We touched on the military situation. It was not good. Despite my victory at Cologne, Florentius had left me with only two legions. The rest of my army had been recalled to Rheims and Vienne. I was in the same position I had been my first winter at Vienne, a prince with no principality. Only now I carried a larger burden. But as the old saying goes, &ldquo;A pack-saddle is put on an ox; that is surely no burden for me.&rdquo; It was my task not only to hold Sens but to protect the neighbouring villages from the German tribes who were, even in the dead of winter, moving restlessly from town to town, burning and pillaging. In fact, Chnodomar himself had sworn that he would hang me before the spring thaw. To garrison the near-by towns, I was obliged to give up two-thirds of the soldiers under my command. Added to this, we were faced with an unusual number of</p>
<p>desertions, especially among the Italian soldiers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Any man who deserts should be executed,&rdquo; said Sallust, &ldquo;publicly, before the legions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is remarkably difficult, General,&rdquo; said Priscus in his sly way, &ldquo;to execute a deserter. First, you must catch him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The only solution,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;is victory. If we are successful, the men will be loyal. There are few deserters in a winning army.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But we are neither winning nor an army,&rdquo; said Priscus with unpleasant accuracy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which is exactly what the Emperor wants.&rdquo; Oribasius spoke too loudly. I silenced him with a gesture. Helena had heard this but she made no sign.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sure the divine Emperor, my cousin and colleague, is eager for us to succeed in driving the Germans from Gaul.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Actually, I had received no word from Constantius since taking up residence at Sens. I assumed that he was angry with me for not returning to Vienne.</p>
<p>Then Priscus asked me to read from the panegyric I was writing on Eusebia. I sent for a notary, who brought me the manuscript. I read a few pages, not liking it at all. The work was rough. I said so.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Probably,&rdquo; said the wicked Priscus, &ldquo;because it is nearly sincere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The others laughed. At Vienne I had written a lengthy panegyric of Constantius which-if I say so myself-was a masterpiece, carefully ordered and beautifull7 composed. The art of panegyric does not necessarily exclude honesty, though one&rsquo;s true feelings are perfectly irrelevant to the final composition, which is artifice, not truth. Even Constantius realized that I had created something marvellous and wrote me a letter in his own hand, filled with misspellings and errors of syntax. I then tried to write a panegyric on Eusebia, and found it difficult; no doubt, as Priscus suggested, because of my true regard for the subject. Also, I was honour bound not to reveal to what extent she had saved my life. This was limiting.</p>
<p>While we were talking amiably, I heard far off the uneasy neighing of horses, but thought nothing of it. Then Oribasius mentioned those Hebrew books which the Galileans refer to as the old testament.</p>
<p>This was a favourite subject with me. So much so that I forgot Helena was in the room. &ldquo;I admire the Jews because of their devotion to a single god. I also admire them because of their selfdiscipline. But I deplore the way they interpret their god. He is supposed to be universal, but he is interested only in them…&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Christ,&rdquo; said my wife suddenly, &ldquo;was sent by God to all of us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was an embarrassed silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The issue,&rdquo; I said finally, with great gentleness, &ldquo;is just that: would the One God intervene in such a way?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We believe that He did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The room was now completely still save for the far-off sound of horses. My companions were on edge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yet is it not written in the so-called gospel of John, that &lsquo;out of Galilee arises no prophet&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;God is God, not a prophet,&rdquo; said Helena.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the idea of the Nazarene&rsquo;s mission, in his own words, is taken from the old testament, which is Jewish, which says that a prophet—a messiah—will one day come to the Jews, but not God himself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is a difficulty,&rdquo; she admitted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In fact,&rdquo; and I was stupidly blunt, &ldquo;there is almost no connection between what the Galileans believe and what the Nazarene preached. More to the point, I see nothing in the Jewish text that would allow for such a monstrosity as the triple god. The Jews were monotheists. The Galileans are atheists.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I had gone too far. Helena rose, bowed, and withdrew, accompanied by her ladies.</p>
<p>My companions were alarmed. Priscus spoke first. &ldquo;What a gift you have, Caesar, for making the difficult impossible!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The others agreed. I asked their forgiveness. &ldquo;Anyway,&rdquo; I said, not believing my own words, &ldquo;we can trust Helena.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope so.&rdquo; Sallust was gloomy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One must be true to what is true,&rdquo; I said, wishing as I so often do that I had held my tongue.</p>
<p>There was a sudden shouting in the streets. We all sprang to our feet. We had hardly got to the door when an officer arrived to report that Sens was being attacked. Elsewhere I describe what happened and I shall not repeat it here.</p>
<p><em>Priscus</em>: We were besieged for a month. A number of our deserters had gone over to the Germans and reported on our weakness. Encouraged by this, and excited at the thought of capturing a Roman Caesar, King Chnodomar marched on Sens. It was a difficult time and we owed our lives, finally, to Julian&rsquo;s energy and intelligence. Though he could not make us cheerful or even confident, he at least kept us dutiful and modestly hopeful.</p>
<p>That night the call to arms was sounded. Men rushed to their posts on the battlements. The Germans could be seen less than half a mile away, illuminated by burning farmhouses. It had been the neighing of farm horses that had disturbed our after-dinner conversation. Had the Germans been quieter, they might have taken the city. Fortunately for us, every last one of them was drunk.</p>
<p>During the next few days, Julian&rsquo;s mood changed from almost boisterous excitement to grim rage. He was positive that he had been deliberately abandoned. This suspicion was confirmed when a messenger arrived from Rheims to say that Marcellus would not come to our aid; he pleaded weakness. He also insisted that Julian had sufficient men to repulse the Germans.</p>
<p>Our rations were nearly gone when the Germans departed as suddenly as they had arrived. Long sieges bored them. Julian immediately sent to Vienne for supplies. He then recalled all his troops to Sens and the remainder of the winter was passed, if not in comfort, at least without fear of sudden annihilation. Julian also wrote Constantius a full account of Marcellus&rsquo;s refusal to come to his aid. It was a splendid document. I know; Sallust and I helped to write it. So splendid was it, in fact, that unlike most state papers this one had an effect. Marcellus was recalled to Milan and after a short interval Julian finally got what he wanted, the command of the armies of Gaul.</p>
<p>The year 357 was the making of Julian as a world hero. In the spring, when the grain was ripe, he proceeded to Rheims, where he learned that Barbatio, the commander of the Roman infantry, was on his way to Augst with twenty-five thousand troops and seven river boats. He was to assist Julian in a final drive against the Germans. But before a plan could be devised, a tribe called the Laeti passed through our territory and laid siege to Lyon, burning all the countryside around. Julian quickly sent three squadrons of light cavalry to relieve that city. He also set a watch on the three roads radiating from Lyon, in order to ambush the savages when they fled. Unfortunately, Barbatio&rsquo;s troops allowed the Germans to get through because a tribune of targeteers, named Cella, acting under Barbatio&rsquo;s orders, prevented the cavalry commander from attacking. Why? Barbatio was eager for Julian to fail. He was also to some extent in league with the German tribes. Julian ordered Cella and his staff cashiered; only the cavalry commander was let off. He was, incidentally, Valentinian, our future emperor.</p>
<p>By now the Germans were alarmed. They tried to block our progress to the Rhine by felling great trees across the roads. They took refuge on the islands in the Rhine, where they used to bellow all sorts of insults at us, and at night sing the most melancholy songs. When Julian asked Barbatio for his seven</p>
<p>ships, they were promptly and mysteriously burned. So Julian, always inventive, ordered the light-armoured auxiliaries of the Cornuti Legion to swim out to one of the islands, using their wooden shields as rafts. This worked. They killed the German defenders and then, using German boats, attacked the other islands. The savages then abandoned the remaining islands and fled into the eastern forest.</p>
<p>Julian next restored the fortress at Savernes, an important installation because it stands directly in the path of anyone intent on the conquest of central Gaul. He then harvested the crops the Germans had planted. This gave him twenty days&rsquo; rations. He was now ready to face King Chnodomar. His only obstacle was Barbatio. Happily for us, this extraordinary creature was attacked by the Germans just north of Augst. Though Barbatio had a large, well-disciplined army, he fled in a panic back to Augst and promptly announced that he had won a famous victory and, though it was only July, he went into winter quarters. That was the end of him for the year. We were much relieved.</p>
<p>With thirteen thousand men, Julian marched directly on Strasbourg. A few miles from the city, Chnodomar sent Julian an embassy commanding him to quit Gaul since this was now &ldquo;German country, won by German arms and valour&rdquo;. Julian laughed at the king&rsquo;s envoys. But Chnodomar was not a man to be taken lightly. Ever since he defeated the Caesar Decentius, he had been free to come and go in Gaul as though it were indeed his own kingdom. Now, encouraged by the collapse of Barbatio, he was positive he would again be victorious.</p>
<p>The issue was resolved, as we all know, and I am sure you will insert at this point Julian&rsquo;s account of the Battle of Strasbourg. I think it is almost the best of his writings—and you know my prejudice against military commentaries! Only the garrulousness of age makes me go on as I have about these months in Gaul. I do it partly to inform you and partly—to be honest—to see how much memory I have left; more than I thought. One detail which came back to me just as I wrote the word &ldquo;memory&rdquo;: while riding outside the walls of a Gallic town, I saw a cemetery where several of the graves were covered with fishnets. I asked one of the native soldiers what this meant. &ldquo;It is to keep the ghosts of mothers who die in childbirth from stealing back their children.&rdquo; There is a lot of interesting folklore in that part of the world and I hope some latter-day Herodotus will record it before the people become so, completely Romanized that the old customs are forgotten.</p>
<p>Incidentally, it was at this time that Helena was recalled to Rome, where Constantius was celebrating not only his first triumph but his first visit to the capital. She was again pregnant, and again she lost her baby, this time through a miscarriage brought on by a potion Eusebia gave her.</p>
<p>As for the famous Battle of Strasbourg, I can add very little to what Julian himself wrote.</p>
<p><em>Libanius</em>: Then why do you? Priscus keeps protesting he can add little and then adds too much. He has aged. He always used to be brief, to the point of being laconic, but now…!</p>
<p><em>Priscus</em>: My own memories of that day in August are quite vivid and surprisingly full, considering the fact that I have no memory of what happened last year, or even this morning. Julian had submitted his plan of battle to Florentius at Vienne and to our surprise it was approved. No one will know what Florentius&rsquo;s motives were. I suspect the fact that Julian had thirteen thousand troops while the German army numbered some thirty-five thousand might have had something to do with it.</p>
<p>On the morning of 14 August we stopped some twenty miles from the Rhine, on whose banks Chnodomar had assembled his army. I recall that day as one of the hottest I have ever experienced. The heat was even worse than Persia, for it was damp. Also, the air swarmed with insects, and I sneezed continually as I always do at that time of year, the result of humours rising from the rank earth.</p>
<p>I was at Julian&rsquo;s side through most of the battle, more as ornament than as soldier, though I did lay</p>
<p>about me from time to time simply to avoid being killed. Julian made a good speech to the army. His speeches, though never particularly brilliant, did have the gift of striking precisely the right note with the men. I have often wondered how such a bookish young man could have learned to talk with such ease to some of the most formidably ignorant and prejudiced men on earth. Yet he did. His cultured voice would become harsh, his manner royal; the content modest, the effect inspiring.</p>
<p>Julian sat his horse, with his standard-bearer beside him holding a spear on which the imperial dragon fluttered in the hot wind, purple and ominous. The infantry filled the narrow declivity at the foot of the hill where Julian and his staff were posted, all kneedeep in ripened grain, for we were in the midst of a large farm.</p>
<p>Trumpets blared in unison. Squadrons of cavalry, cuirassiers and archers moved in from left and right until Julian was surrounded. When at last they were all assembled and silent, he spoke to them. He was never more subtle though his manner was vigorous and forthright. He wanted to persuade them to fight immediately, but knowing that they were tired and hot from the sun, he realized that he would have to trick them into wanting what he wanted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The thing we most care for is the safety of our men, and though we are eager to engage the enemy, we also realize that rashness can be dangerous and caution a virtue. Though we are all young men and inclined to be impetuous, as Caesar I must be the one to move warily, though—as you know—I am far from being timid. Now here is our situation. It is almost noon. The heat is terrible. It will get worse. We are all of us tired from a long march. We are not certain of sufficient water this side of the Rhine. The enemy is fresh, and waiting. So I suggest that we erect pickets, that we eat and sleep and make ready for battle tomorrow, when, if it be God&rsquo;s will, we shall strike at first light and with our eagles in the advance, drive the Germans from Roman soil…&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the legions interrupted him. They gnashed their teeth, a terrible sound, and struck their spears against their shields.</p>
<p>Then one of the standard-bearers shouted, &ldquo;Forward, Caesar! Follow your star!&rdquo; He turned dramatically to the legions. &ldquo;We have a general who will win! So if it be God&rsquo;s will, we shall free Gaul this day! Hail, Caesar!&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was all that was needed. As the legions cheered, Julian gave the order to prepare for battle. After this, I had him to myself for a moment. We were so close to one another that our stirrups clashed. &ldquo;A fine speech,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;Suitable for history.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He grinned like a schoolboy. &ldquo;How did you like the standardbearer&rsquo;s speech?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Exactly what was required.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I coached him in it last night, with gestures.&rdquo; Then Julian deployed his troops. The Germans were already in battle formation. To left and right as far as the eye could see, their forces lined the river. In their first rank was King Chnodomar, a big man with a great belly who wore a scarlet plume in his helmet.</p>
<p>At noon, Julian ordered the attack. The Germans had dug a number of trenches in our path and there, hidden by green boughs, archers suddenly fired at the legions who halted in consternation. They did not retreat; but they did not advance.</p>
<p>Julian was now in his element. Voice cracking with tension, he darted from squadron to squadron, legion to legion. He drove the men to attack. Those who fell back, he threatened. I cannot remember exactly what he said, but the burden of it was: these are savages, these are the spoilers of Gaul, <em>now</em> is the chance to break them, this is the moment we have waited for! He also used a wily approach for those who seemed bent on retreat. &ldquo;I beg you, don&rsquo;t follow the enemy too closely! Stop at the Rhine! Let them drown. But you be careful!&rdquo;</p>
<p>For me, the day was confusion. In the course of that sweltering afternoon, the battle was several</p>
<p>times in doubt. At one point our cavalry broke; they would have fled had they not come up against a solid wall of infantry reserves behind them. My most vivid memory is of the German faces. I have never seen anything like them, nor hope to again in this world. Should there be a hell, I am sure that I shall spend it entirely in the company of Germans in battle. Their dyed red hair is worn long, and hangs about the face like a lion&rsquo;s mane. They grind their teeth and shout words which are not words but sounds of rage. Their eyes are quite mad and staring, the veins thick in their necks. I suspect many of them were drunk but not drunk enough to lose their ferocity. I killed several, and was myself nearly killed.</p>
<p>After the Germans had split our cavalry, they turned on the infantry, thinking to overwhelm them by sheer numbers. But they did not reckon with the two best legions of Rome: the Cornuti and the Bracchiati. These men in tortoise formation, heads masked by their shields, steadily advanced into the German horde. This was the crisis of the battle, just as Oribasius maintains that there is a crisis in a fever when all at once it is decided whether the sick man lives or dies. We lived. The Germans died. It was a great—a sickening—butchery. Wounded and dying men lay four and five deep on the river bank; some were suffocated by the bodies above them; some literally drowned in blood. I was never again to see a day quite like that one, for which I am thankful.</p>
<p>Suddenly, as though by some signal (but it was merely instinct; other witnesses of war have noticed this same phenomenon), the Germans broke for the river. Our men followed. It was a lurid sight. The savages desperately tried to swim to the other side. At one point, and this is no chronicler&rsquo;s exaggeration, the Rhine was indeed red with blood.</p>
<p>It was now late afternoon. Aching in every muscle and trembling from what I had seen and done, I found Julian and his staff already encamped on a high bluff beside the river. Julian&rsquo;s tent had been pitched in a grove of ash trees, and though his face was black with sweat and dust, he seemed as fresh as when he began the day. He embraced me warmly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now we&rsquo;re all here!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;And still alive.&rdquo; We drank wine as the shadows of the trees around us lengthened, and Sallust reported that we had lost four officers and two hundred and fortythree men. No one could reckon the German losses but the next day they were figured to be somewhere between five and six thousand. It was the greatest victory for Roman arms in Gaul since Julius Caesar. Difficult though it is for me to delight in military affairs, I could not help but be caught up by the general excitement, which increased when shortly before midnight King Chnodomar himself was brought to us, arms pinned behind him, great belly sagging, eyes white with terror. The Germans lack true pride, as others have so often remarked. In victory they are overbearing; in defeat cringing. The king threw himself at Julian&rsquo;s feet, moaning his submission. The next day Julian sent him to Constantius, who had him imprisoned in Rome&rsquo;s Castra Peregrina on the Caelian Hill, where he died of old age. All in all, a better fate than was to befall his conqueror.</p>
<p>Julian records nothing of the rest of the year. He decently buried the Gallic dead. He returned to Savernes. He ordered captives and booty to be taken to Metz. Then he crossed the Rhine into German territory. He seized all livestock and grain; he burned the houses, which are built exactly like ours even though the Germans are supposed to prefer living in forest huts—so much for legend. Then we penetrated those awesome vast woods which fill the centre of Europe. There is nothing like them in the world. The trees are so dense that only a dim green light ever penetrates to the ground. Trees old as time make passage difficult. Here the savage tribes are safe from attack, for what stranger could find his way through that green labyrinth? and who would want to conquer those haunted woods? Except the Emperor Trajan. We stumbled upon one of his abandoned forts, and Julian had it rebuilt and garrisoned. Then we crossed the Rhine once more and went into winter quarters at Paris, a city which the Romans always refer to, with their usual elegance, as Mudtown.</p>
