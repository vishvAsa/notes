In the 180s bce the first marble temple was dedicated. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t until decades later the first citizen built a like mansion. The temple of Jupiter Optimus Maximus was a wooden structure until the 80s bce. To put this on a timeline, Julius Caesar was a young man by then and this was the most important religious site in Rome.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&#34;https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1821332191592214669.html&#34;&gt;TW&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;They wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have considered sex to be degeneracy. Before early modernity or so, there wasn&amp;rsquo;t much sense of privacy. People in medieval towns would walk naked to go bathe&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;17th century palaces like Versailles had courtiers and servants alike shitting out in the open&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;People shared beds with other people, strangers or family depending on the situation.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s little worry about sex except insofar as it impacts those&amp;hellip; They had a notion that sex drains vital energy from men and so men shouldn&amp;rsquo;t overindulge. And their views on marriage were strict enough that it was limited. But sex itself wasn&amp;rsquo;t bad.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
