      <description>&lt;p&gt;Contemplating the Palm Tree Line&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;*Michael Blim *&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Wandering in a Parma piazza, his investigation of three Sicilian mafia murders undone by unnamed higher-ups, Captain Bellodi, Leonardo Sciascia&amp;rsquo;s protagonist in &lt;em&gt;Il Giorno della Civetta&lt;/em&gt;, encounters an old school friend curious about the carabiniere&amp;rsquo;s recently ended southern sojourn. &amp;ldquo;You have to go to Sicily to realize just how incredible Italy is,&amp;rdquo; Bellodi responds. For Bellodi, Sicily was the end of Italy &amp;ndash; the place where finally Italy no longer made any sense.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Two Italies: Rhetorical Figures of Failed Nationhood&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;*Mariella Pandolfi *&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The representation of Italy as a nation divided or even &lt;em&gt;manquée&lt;/em&gt;, a fragile and artificial union of two divided and estranged Italies, raises questions about alterity understood in both collective and individual terms. Generally, we suppose that the consciousness of a group can be integrated through a rhetoric of alterity; insiders reinforce their own identity by constructing an external, deterritorialized &amp;ldquo;other.&amp;rdquo; In the Italian historical context, however, the rhetorical construction of a South opposed, and even inimical, to the North escapes this pattern to produce a more richly complex figuration. On the one hand, southerners continue to invoke the figure of a land invaded, of centuries of foreign oppression, of the abandonment of an artistic heritage — a position which places the South in the realm of alterity to Italian nationhood. On the other hand, a reciprocal figure emerges in which this alterity must be internalized in order to imagine a territorially integral Italy.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
