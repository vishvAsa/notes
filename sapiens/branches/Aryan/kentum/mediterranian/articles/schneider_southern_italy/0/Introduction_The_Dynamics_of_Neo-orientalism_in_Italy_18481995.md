*Jane Schneider *

In Italy, and in Italian studies, the "Southern Question" evokes a powerful image of the provinces south of Rome as different from the rest of the peninsula, above all for their historic poverty and economic underdevelopment, their engagement in a clientelistic style of politics, and their cultural support for patriarchal gender relations and for various manifestations of organized crime. This tenacious catalogue of stereotypes includes, as well, the notion that southerners, by dint of their very essence, or at least their age-old culture and traditions, possess character traits that are opposite to the traits of northerners. Passionate, undisciplined, rebellious, intensely competitive, and incapable of generating group solidarity or engaging in collective action, they were and are, as the cliché, would have it, unable to build the rational, orderly, civic cultures that, in the North, underwrote the emergence of industrial capitalist society. 

This volume is an interdisciplinary effort to understand how and why the forceful rhetoric of North versus South took hold in Italy, becoming an everyday symbolic geography for northerners and southerners alike. In addition, it further addresses the problem of generating alternative representations of the South. The timing is propitious. A regionalist movement rooted in Lombardy and the Veneto, the Lega Nord \(Northern League\), has challenged national unity through a surprising show of electoral strength in the 1994 and 1996 elections. Although many observers have been reluctant to take seriously the movement's flamboyant, theatrical leader, Umberto Bossi, they have nevertheless been shaken by the unexpected resonance which his anti-southern \(as well as anti-immigrant\) stance has evoked in the North. 

Reminiscent of neo-liberalism in other industrialized countries, the Lega has attacked the national government for over-taxing the productive economy of Northern Italy and then over-spending on welfaristic infusions of capital and social services in the South. Given the inherently corrupt practices of southerners, it is argued, such investments have not transformed, but only reproduced, a backward system. Policy-makers were right, therefore, when in 1992, in the context of Italy's first budgetary restrictions preparatory to entering the European Monetary Union, they terminated a range of programs that dated back to 1950, when the national government launched its "extraordinary intervention" to develop the South \(see Clark 1984: 357-60; Ginsborg 1990: 162, 229-30; Levy 1996: 2-3\). Bossi has himself gone much further, imagining and preparing for the creation and secession of a mythical northern state he calls "Padania." 

The would-be revolution of Umberto Bossi and the Northern "Leghisti" is not the only upheaval in contemporary Italy that renders an exploration of the Southern Question timely. There are, as well, powerful social forces at work in the South — antimafia reform movements opposed to organized crime and its ally, political corruption — whose followers are deeply committed to building the political, cultural, and judicial institutions of southern civil society. Evident since the early 1980s, particularly in the cities, these movements, too, have thrown down the gauntlet to Italy, the nation. Like the Leghisti, their critique singles out for special opprobrium the regime of center-left political parties that governed the country from the end of the war until the first post-Cold War election of 1992. In their analyses, however, the problem with this regime is not that it was permeated by clientelistic practices emanating from the South, but rather that it protected some of the South's most vile criminals — bosses who assumed a dominant role in the international traffics of arms and drugs — in order to hang on to power. The magistrates, intellectuals, and political leaders who have spearheaded the southern reform movements would further remind us that they were active before, and an inspiration to, the "clean hands" anti-corruption prosecutions of the North \(prosecutions that developed independently of, even though they have been exploited by, the Lega\). 

There are many obstacles to Italy's splitting in two. Despite their strong regional focus, both the Antimafia or Rete Party that was founded in Palermo in 1990 and the Lega Nord have national ambitions and pursue strategies for mobilizing support beyond their respective homelands. Meanwhile, the decidedly national electorates of the former Communists, Socialists, and Christian Democrats have been rechanneled into two new parties of national scope - the Democratic Party of the Left and the Forza Italia Party of Silvio Berlusconi \(see Levy 1996\). And, as Gabriella Gribaudi reminds us in a recent essay, "Images of the South," there remains to consider "all the intermarriages between northerners and southerners, the assimilation into Northern cities of Southern migrants of the 1950s and 1960s, \[and\] the high number of southerners amongst the Italian ruling class, not only in the ranks of the discredited state bureaucracy" \(1996: 85\). Yet Gribaudi also notes a recent "marked return to the divisive arguments of the nineteenth century, but with even greater malice ... rekindling conflicts and channeling hatreds." Although Italy has not seen bloodshed, she warns, the conflict between North and South is "developing in a similar manner to that in Eastern Europe" \(ibid.\). 

A common ingredient in both situations is surely the European Union, which, in the very process of moving toward a single currency and more integrated political economy, has touched off an intense set of debates about belonging: which nation states will be deemed qualified to join which institutions, and in which order or "round." In the former Yugoslavia, the desire to belong to Europe was a powerful motive underlying the separatist strategies of Croatia and Slovenia, whose leaders redefined Serbia as a burden and an embarrassment, complaining that, in the name of brotherly unity, Belgrade was siphoning resources from the more "progressive, prosperous, hard-working, tolerant, democratic ... in a word, *European*," regions of the country so that the "primitive, lazy, intolerant," *Balkan* regions could "freeload" \(Bakic-Hayden and Hayden 1992: 6—8\). 

It is not altogether beside the point to see in the Northern League an analog to the Croatian and Slovenian moves, or to worry that in Southern Italy the new efforts to build a nationally-resonant civil society may be swamped by other, less democratic and less peaceful, movements. The disparities between North and South in gross domestic product, in receipt of capital transfers as against payment of taxes, and in unemployment, remain dramatically high, and the neo-fascist Alleanza Nazionale Party, having taken up the cause of defending the South from recent moves to dismantle the welfare state, is enjoying a disproportionate expansion in this region \(Levy 1996\). 

Yet another, broader, reason for examining the Southern Question now is that, in today's context of global capitalism, which emphasizes "flexible accumulation" and the unfettered mobility of capital, both large-scale investors and a growing number of social economists and political scientists have focused their attention on regional potentialities, as shaped by regional cultures. In such a climate, there is a kind of urgency to exploring how these cultures become delineated — synthesized in a few images, constructed or defined. Particularly when the definitions are pejorative, one wants to know what might be required for alternative understandings to be articulated and heard. As anthropologist James Carrier has put it, considerable power imbalances affect "the larger uses to which these representations are put and the broader actions that they help motivate, by development agencies, international corporations.... governments, the tourist industry, and the like" \(1992: 197\). 

The volume at hand, written from the varied perspectives of history, literature, anthropology, sociology, and political science, addresses these concerns. Several issues are worthy of our attention in this introduction. First, the Southern Question discourse, although in some respects an age-old phenomenon, took on its radical, oppositional contours — North versus South, advanced industrial versus backward agrarian, well-governed "civic" versus clientelistic — in the 1870s to 1890s, after the Unification of Italy, when the contrasts became not only essentialized, but racialized as well. Second, some important contributors to the discourse were and are southerners; stigmatizing the South is not exclusively an activity of northerners and non-Italians. This said, however, a third consideration presents itself: Italians have reified their internal differences in relation to a much wider context for defining difference: the context set by the dominant colonial and neo-colonial powers of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, the successors of the Spanish and Portuguese empires — England, France, and the United States. Let us begin with this wider context. 



## Orientalism as Wider Context

Within the northern hemisphere, travellers voyaging from north to south in earlier centuries typically commented on differences of climate and sometimes invented elaborate theories relating climate and topography to the "character" of the peoples they encountered. They also often reacted to the visibility of poverty and squalor in southern city streets. Since they were people of means, they had no doubt learned to screen out such disturbing images in the places they came from, assisted, perhaps, by the fact that in cold climates less of domestic life unfolds outdoors. Grand Tour travellers of the eighteenth century had an added reason to be sensitive. Having studied the classics in England, France and Germany, they made the journey to Southern Italy, as to Greece, in search of an unspoiled antiquity; but the recent histories and societies of the living peoples of these places marred the experience \(see Herzfeld 1987: 53—64\). Nelson Moe, who has written extensively on the historical and literary background of the Southern Question, has assembled a series of revealing travellers' accounts from the "age before nationalism." In one of them, "the great cities of Italy" are described as "ignorant and corrupt . . . peopled by nothing but lords, valets, and an extremely crude populace." In another, Southern Italy is singled out as a region where "sensation dominates everything ... Never did a noble thought germinate under this sun ... they let themselves be carried away by inebriating nature" \(quoted in Moe 1994: 7, 23\). 

Such judgments, many of them expressed in literature, were relatively benign. Apart from being traceable to the quite human experience of "culture shock," to borrow an expression from anthropology, they resonated with what James Fernandez suggests is a Europe-wide "popular cosmology" of North-South oppositions, in which both northerners and southerners see the "other" as different and in some respects morally inferior \(Fernandez 1997; see also Campbell and Levine 1968\). In addition they had to be weighed against knowledge of a recent past when Renaissance Italy was an economic and cultural center, and a source of political models, for much of Europe. All of this changed, however, when, in the wake of industrial development and colonial expansion, a system of nation-states was consolidated in North Atlantic Europe whose economic and military prowess transcended the standards of the past. As Moe has observed, developmental advances on this scale bestowed a prerogative to define what would be considered civilizational values, and to elevate or demote various peoples in relation to them \(Moe 1994: 4\). Tellingly, the discourses about who did and did not qualify as civilized gained much of their force from the deployment of simplistic binary categories, for, as Michael Herzfeld notes, by dividing the world into "manichean pairs ... binarism makes distinctions into entities" and constitutes a "key ordering principle of political inequality" \(Herzfeld 1997: 15\). There is the further advantage that binary oppositions connect with "popular cosmologies" of difference, for example between North and South. 

A particularly powerful instance of the new geopolitics of civilization was, of course, the radically dichotomous discourse on Orientalism. As applied to the Muslim societies of the Middle East, this literary, scholarly, and political tradition both derived from, and justified, the colonial projects of the emergent European powers. In his groundbreaking exploration of the phenomenon, Edward Said noted how the accumulated textual and visual elements contrasting a mystical, sensual, and indolent "East" with a rational, progressive, and modern West were not aimed at the "acephalous" or "tribal" societies of some colonial encounters, but at elaborate centralized states, heirs of past civilizations, which might well have been competitors. By rendering the governments of these states as both archaic and "bad," Orientalist discourse trivialized their role in world history and put forth a vision of a future in which they would be eclipsed by more Western-appearing and westward-tilting regimes \(Said 1979\). Said also traced how, after the Second World War, Orientalist discourse was reinvented and substantially reinforced in the academic halls of prestigious universities and government circles in the United States, the baton of preeminent economic and military might having crossed the Atlantic Ocean to locate itself in Washington and New York. To quote Herzfeld again, "models of cultural superiority" get established and imposed, initially, by "force of arms and wealth" \(1997: 16\). 

Italy was certainly affected by Orientalism. For, although the imperial powers of the north did not envision the Italian peninsula as a land they had to colonize — its inhabitants were European Christians, after all — it was nevertheless their goal that Italian resources and products circulate freely in international markets, that Italian markets be open to English and French manufactures, and that Italian élites share in and support the world civilizational system that these powers believed it was their prerogative to create. As such they critically scrutinized the divergent polities of the peninsula on the eve of their unification in 1860, much to the disadvantage of the Neapolitan Kingdom of the Two Sicilies that governed the southern region and Sicily. A telling, because widely publicized, indictment was that of William Gladstone, who took up the cause of political prisoners in Naples after the Kingdom repressed the uprising against it in 1848. This Bourbon monarchy, he scolded, was "the negation of God erected into a system of Government" \(quoted in Moe 1994: 35\). For Gladstone and his contemporaries, Moe proposes, the way this government treated its prisoners was a "synecdoche for a much larger ensemble of political and ideological problems, ranging from ... resistance to international free trade to \[their\] 'abominable' anti-liberal, anti-constitutional doctrines" \(ibid.\). Meanwhile, the Kingdom of Sardinia in Piedmont, which was to spearhead the Unification, emerged from the turmoil of 1848 embracing the ideals of constitutional monarchy and liberalized trade, winning much higher marks. 

Evaluations of Italy emanating from the world centers of military and economic power in the second half of the twentieth century share an uncanny similarity to these pronouncements, replete with the paternalistic rhetoric of the good, or almost good, northern protégé and the bad southern one. An influential example is political scientist Edward C. Banfield's 1958 *The Moral Basis of a Backward Society*, which helped convince policy circles in Cold War America of the urgency of developing and thus transforming the Italian South. In line with the burgeoning research tradition nurtured by sociologist Talcott Parsons at Harvard University, Banfield proposed a direct, causal connection between economic development \(as measured by industrial capacity, workers' productivity, and standard of living\), and a people's propensity to join voluntary associations and engage in collective projects for the common good. Southern Italian society was backward, he argued, because instead of a civic culture that would promote this sort of collaboration, it had a familistic culture favorable to agonistic separation. Southern Italians acted to further the short-term interests of their respective nuclear families - hardly the common good — and assumed that their fellow citizens were doing the same. Banfield labeled them "amoral familists" and, as Simona Piattoni explains in a later chapter in this volume, he held this ethos responsible for their clientelistic conduct of politics as well. 

Thirty-five years later, in 1993, another American political scientist, Robert D. Putnam, produced a second key text in the English language for interpreting Southern Italian "backwardness", *Making Democracy Work; Civic Traditions in Modern Italy*. Based on a twenty-year study of the differences in performance of six regional governments distributed throughout the peninsula, Putnam's book is considerably more systematic and comprehensive than Banfield's. Yet it too constructs an opposition between North and South. Finding that the northern regional governments out-perform the southern ones in their ability to enact and implement policy, Putnam locates their effectiveness in a "civic tradition" of communally oriented city states that stretches "from Rome to the Alps" and can be dated to the Middle Ages. In drastic contrast, the South suffered from medieval times under royal governments at once feudal, bureaucratic, and absolutist \(1993: 123\). 

That Putnam intended the contrast to be not merely a difference of elements, but rather a binary set of forms is suggested by his use of the terms "horizontal collaboration" and "vertical hierarchy" for the governmental institutions of the North and the South, respectively \(1993: 124\). A deep history, moreover, renders these polarized structures essential: "by the beginning of the fourteenth century, Italy had produced" two \(and only two\) different "patterns of governance," two different "ways of life." "In the North, people were citizens; in the South they were subjects ... In the North the crucial social, political, and even religious allegiances and alignments were horizontal, while those in the South were vertical. Collaboration, mutual assistance, civic obligation, and even trust. . . were the distinguishing features in the North. The chief virtue in the South, by contrast, was the imposition of hierarchy and order on latent anarchy" \(1993: 130\). 

Centuries later, after the collapse of the communal republics and their "re-feudalization," the North, too, succumbed to bad government. "However, among the northern heirs to the communal tradition, patrons, no matter how autocratic, still accepted civic responsibilities," whereas their contemporaries in the South, the Spanish Habsburgs and the Bourbons, "systematically promoted mutual distrust and conflict among their subjects, destroying horizontal ties of solidarity in order to maintain the primacy of vertical ties of dependence and exploitation" \(1993: 135—6\). The legacy for the North, Putnam argues, was that its citizens would meet the challenges of Italian Unification and subsequent industrial transformation with a "practical reciprocity," a "pragmatic readiness to cooperate," a well-spring of mutual trust, generating all manner of voluntary associations in reinforcement of their civic culture. Quite the contrary for the South, where patron-client networks persisted "as the primary structure of power," even after the appearance of mass parties. Here "civic habits" paled before "the ancient culture of mistrust" and the absence of the practice of mutual assistance sabotaged economic development projects, regardless of how well they were financed. 

I note the dichotomous language of the Putnam text \(as does Piattoni\) because it marks the continuation of the wider, hegemonic context within which debates over the Italian Southern Question of necessity unfold. Rich in data on regional governmental performance measured over time, *Making Democracy Work* is already influential in the policy-making circles of various governing bodies — Italian, European, American — and probably also among private financial analysts \(see Tarrow 1996: 389, notes 1 and 4\). It certainly works hand in hand with journalistic accounts of Italy's present situation *vis-à-vis* the pending Monetary Union of Europe. Finance ministers of the Northern powers have yet to commit to including this Mediterranean country in the first round of the Union, claiming to doubt the stability of its government and the government's ability to lower its budget deficit. The subtext of the pessimism is suggested by the following *New York Times* headline: "North—South Divide in Italy, a Problem for Europe, Too." In the article so titled, correspondent Celestine Bohlen refers to the division between the rich North and the dependent passive South as the "curse of Italian unity" and warns that the split "augurs ill for Italy as a whole as it tries to put its financial house in order" \(*NYT* 1996, Nov. 15\). 

Given the forcefulness of these images, in which Italy appears dragged down by its southern half, it is tempting to attribute the Southern Question discourse to the expansionist political-economic and cultural projects of North Atlantic Europe and the United States. To do so, however, would be to overlook two critical processes that interacted to produce what might be called a neo-Orientalist discourse *within* Italy itself. Moe has identified these processes as first, the tendency for northern and national élites to displace their anxieties about belonging to Europe onto that part of the country that is geographically and, in their minds, culturally, most distant from the European "core"; and second, the tendency for southern intellectuals and liberal élites to articulate a profound critique of their native society and government, becoming the interlocutors of northerners' negative views \(Moe 1992, 1994\). These processes — displacement and complicity — illuminate how Orientalism can work within a country to reinforce the wider geopolitical and geo-cultural ambitions of the great powers, creating what an East European specialist refers to as "nesting Orientalisms" \(Bakic-Hayden 1995\). It is with them in mind that I tum to the specific contributions of this book. 



## The Genesis of the Southern Question

Within Italy, a discourse about the South emerged simultaneously in many fields, some of which - public policy, statistics, criminology, and literature - are represented in this book. \(Others, for example art, music, theater, poetry, and folklore, should be noted.\) Taken together, the different fields suggest a rhythm of genesis: only after the Unification of Italy did an image of the South as internally homogeneous and qualitatively "other" become consolidated, displacing a picture of open-ended possibilities in which the region's particular or divergent institutions, laws, and customs were noted but not reified. Our account begins with Marta Petrusewicz's chapter "Before the Southern Question," which not only illustrates this open-endedness, but lays the groundwork for considering the process of southerners' complicity in stigmatizing the South. 

Following its independence from Spain in 1734, the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies set out to reform, and then abolish, feudalism. But there were setbacks: first the French Revolution, which made reforms seem dangerous; then the invasion and conquest by Napoleon's armies; and, finally, after the 1815 restoration, the even more terrifying local uprisings of 1848. The period of calm between 1815 and 1848 nurtured widespread activity on the part of Liberal aristocrats and the emergent middle classes, who met in secret, not only in Naples but in the provinces, to plot the end of feudalism. Petrusewicz is interested in how they navigated their political and cultural choices, knowing that their more or less "enlightened" royals had recently been driven out by the French. During this "first" Restoration, and in keeping with Romantic movements throughout Europe, they clung to Enlightenment ideals yet rejected "the blind application of foreign recipes," "the contempt for native customs and institutions," the "remoteness from popular sentiment" of some Enlightenment projects, all the while continuing to measure their country against those that claimed the top places in the new civilizational hierarchy. 

Periods of panic and repression disillusioned these "native" reformers, however, and, after 1848, catapulted many of them into prison or exile. In a 1992 essay, Moe reviews the situation of the Neapolitan exiles to Northern Italy who joined the Piedmontese movement for unifying the nation and who then returned to Naples in 1860. Home again, if only temporarily, they felt more contempt for what they found than did the invading Piedmontese army. This, plus their reciprocal admiration for the invader, led them to envision the new nation, Italy, as formed through the imposition of northern institutions and practices, rather than through regional integration. The equivocation, Moe suggests, opened the door for accentuating the deviation of the South from the whole. Petrusewicz amplifies this point. Highlighting not only the exiles' past efforts to transform the southern kingdom from within, but also their enthusiasms, their hopes, and their great caution, she enables us to appreciate how bitter and disappointing political experiences can shape what happens in history. No wonder, she suggests, that some southerners were fully complicitous with northerners in the construction of the Southern Question discourse. 

Moe's chapter focuses on the period between 1874 and 1884 when the Southern Question was actually born, and includes a careful reading of the important exile. Pasquale Villari, who settled in Florence in 1848, liked Tuscany, and lived there unti\! his death in 1917 \(1994: 219—20\). In 1875, his *Lettere Meridionali* launched the school of "Meridionalisti" — authors of field studies and comprehensive treatises that described southern problems for a northern audience over the next several decades. Villari's *Letters*, Moe tells us, were the work of an "agitator." By detailing the shocking social conditions of his homeland, he hoped to shame the predominantly northern liberal élites into changing what had so far been their largely negative and repressive orientation toward the South: impose new taxes, institute conscription, and suppress banditry. In the light of the Paris Commune of 1871, he believed, this élite would want to redress southern poverty and backwardness, if not from a sense of social justice then at least from fear. 

In making his case, Villari increasingly assigned Southern Italy a special function in what Moe suggests was a "moral geography" of Italy, condensing all the social ills of the nation into this single region, from crime and dereliction, to banditry and bad government, to oppressive landlords, peasant and urban squalor, and an absent middle class. As a consequence, his moral outrage worked in tandem with — it did not contradict — the reporting of Leopoldo Franchetti, a Tuscan Senator investigating Sicily at about the same time. As Moe makes clear, Franchetti assumed a thoroughly European stance *vis-à-vis* the Italian South, whose peasants reminded him of the "savages" of America, manifesting little of the human desire to improve. In the case of Sicily, northerners would have to impose their modern practices and values on this still-medieval \(and gendered\) "little sister;" otherwise it would not qualify for membership in European civilization. Moe explores the many sophisticated rhetorical devices through which Franchetti's writings on Sicily amplified difference, for example his stance as a superior outsider continually surprised by the degradation of this foreign territory. Most telling, perhaps, was his adoption of a medical metaphor that invested the North "with all the authority commonly associated with a doctor, while Sicily is reduced to the figure of sick patient. . . unable to make decisions on its own behalf." 

Following the Florentine decade that gave birth to the Southern Question, its contours became ever more rigid and essentialized. In a striking instance of this shift, Silvana Patriarca compares the earliest statisticians of the new nation, who recognized variations throughout the peninsula, accounted for them historically, and believed that "good administration" could resolve serious problems, with their successors of the 1890s, who put statistics to work in support of a racialized, evolutionary paradigm. In the latter's hands, North versus South became not only a binary geography, but a geography that was non-relational. Fier essay further reveals how the new languages of official surveys, statistics, and positivist social science lent authority to the representation of the South as truly "other" — a representation that became even more pronounced after the Second World War, as the State prepared its "extraordinary intervention" in southern development. 

The new languages grew out of the social theory and social engineering that accompanied nation-state and empire building in France and England. The ideas of English Social Darwinist Herbert Spencer, for example, inspired a group of Northern Italians credited with founding the science of criminology in the 1880s and 1890s - Cesare Lombroso, Enrico Ferri, Giuseppe Sergi and others. Mary Gibson's chapter discusses the turn these theorists took toward a racial analysis of regional difference. In their view, England's accumulation of colonies was owed to the Nordic or Aryan genes of its populace. That Italy had as yet no empire — its troops met defeat in Abyssinia in 1896 — was attributable to its genetically ambiguous situation. Although each criminologist resorted to his own distinctive and muddled classificatory scheme, as a group they propagated the idea that southerners carried inferior mediterranean-type genes that threatened to dilute the progressive northerners' European \(Alpine, or Aryan, or Celtic\) endowment. 

Not surprisingly, this mode of analysis had a gendered dimension. Guglielmo Ferrero, a follower of Lombroso, proposed that Southern Italian men were sexually precocious, wasting their lives in the pursuit and enslavement of women, rather than working for the "advancement of society." An Englishman was worth two such men, being less easily distracted and "twice as energetic" \(quoted in Noether n.d.: 9\). Most pernicious, the new criminologists sought to prove that Calabrian and Sicilian men were predisposed to crime. Remarkably, Gibson points out, the more "congenital Latin decadence" took over as an explanatory framework for southern crime rates, the more analyses grounded in the South's social problems — poverty, illiteracy, a persistent mal-distribution of property — receded into the background, remaining there even as the hard-edged racial determinism of the new discipline of criminology softened into a determinism based on culture. 

The turn toward a racial explanation of regional difference in the Southern Question discourse was accomplished for the most part by North Italians, although Alfredo Niceforo, a Sicilian and among the most outspoken racialists, was a noteworthy exception. Buoyed by their supreme confidence in the positivist paradigm inherited from Northern Europe, Lombroso and the group around him would not easily penetrate the continued hegemony of idealism in Neapolitan philosophical circles. Their "science" was also blatantly offensive. Gibson reviews the response of the Sicilian statistician and sociological criminologist, Napoleone Colajanni, who articulated a forceful critique of their assumptions. Yet many southern intellectuals remained complicitous in essentializing the South, rendering it culturally if not racially homogeneous and unchanging. In the last chapter of Part I, Frank Rosengarten takes up Sicily's modern writers — Giovanni Verga, Leonardo Sciascia, and Tornasi de Lampedusa - all important figures in Italian literature, and all deeply ambivalent about the possibility that their homeland could ever "improve." 

Living as an expatriate in Milan, the center of Italy's publishing industry and reading public in the late nineteenth century \(see Moe 1994: 227—35\), Verga, for example, represented the island of his birth as a radical contrast, in which all human relationships, regardless of social class or degree of intimacy, risked being distorted by greed, misery, envy, treachery or petty scheming for advantage. Victimized by an oppressive history, no less than by a torrid and unrelenting sun, Verga's Sicilians struggle in what Rosengarten suggests is a "hierarchy of emotional pain." Even their efforts at revolt for justice and liberation come across as somewhat fraudulent and ineffective, a judgment that anticipated one of the mantras of twentieth-century Southern Question discourse: southerners' "failure to engage in collective action." 

Verga's novels of the 1880s might be compared with the 1960s novels of Leonardo Sciascia, whose main intellectual reference point was outside Italy, in Paris. Finding the Enlightenment traditions of France intellectually attractive, Sciascia also depicted Sicily in contrasting terms. Where "enlightened" societies would honor such "impersonal" or universalizing principles as the equality of citizens before the law, his mystery novels and essays focused on Sicilians' manipulative, hidden relationships in public as well as private life. More to the point, as Rosengarten shows, both Sciascia and Lampedusa held fast to the concept of an essential way of being Sicilian - a distinctive Sicilian mentality or culture — whose foremost feature was resignation, a deep, unshakable fatalism about the future. Lampedusa's imposing hero *of The Leopard*, Don Fabrizio, could not have said it more clearly: "In Sicily, it doesn't matter whether one does good or evil: the sin that we Sicilians never pardon is simply that of doing." 

All told, these instances of complicity contribute an important dimension to the analysis of the broader phenomenon of Orientalism, whose negative constructions are usually assumed to emanate from outsiders, apprehending the other from a distance. So much is this the case that even the qualifying argument made by recent scholars \(for example Carrier 1992; Coronil 1996\) that Orientalist discourses are a reciprocal, or dialectical creation, basically means that their promoters, in the process of dualizing and hierarchizing others, also define themselves. Whether employing the categories of occidentalism or of orientalism, "Orientalists" seem mainly to hail from the dominant metropole or center. This may have been true of the racialized version of the Southern Question discourse \(with the exception, again, of Alfredo Niceforo\), but was not the case for its other aspects. Internally differentiated and already in turmoil as a consequence of Europe-wide and world-wide transformations, Southern Italy inevitably produced its own, internal critics of illiberal institutions. Believing that national unification would further their cause, these critics, moreover, felt no pressure to censor their judgmental thoughts and words. 



## Southern Intellectuals and Critical Social Theory

By the end of the nineteenth century, Southern Italians were represented in Italy as racial or cultural others whose differences from northerners were intrinsic and for all time. By nature anarchic, undisciplined, and "unsuited to long-term political preparation" \(Gribaudi 1996: 78\), they were considered to be totally incapable of changing their way of being. Change would have to come, as Franchetti argued for Sicily, from the North. Yet this mode of interpreting the South provoked a counter-discourse, which put forward the political and economic history of the South as an alternative to race and culture in accounting for what was wrong. Articulating this critique at the turn of the century, the Sicilian, Colajanni, introduced a long line of what we might call advocates for the South who have focused on political economy as a counterweight to Southern Question essentialisms. The roster includes several North Italian, European, and American social scientists as well as southerners. The 1960s responses of sociologist Alessandro Pizzorno \(see 1971\) and anthropologist Sydel Silverman \(1968\) to the Banfield treatise are exemplary. They looked, respectively, to the South's political-economic marginality and agricultural organization for structural influences on clientelistic, atomized, and distrustful behaviors. 

Within the political economic tradition, there is a compelling argument that the difficulties of the South are rooted in a colonial or near-colonial past. The position is stated with exceptional clarity by political scientist Sidney Tarrow \(1996\) in his review of Robert Putnam's *Making Democracy Work*. Although lauding Putnam for his and his collaborators' research "endurance and creativity," leading to a convincing portrait of the operations of several regional governments over twenty years, Tarrow takes him to task for ignoring state-building processes and with them the "differential structuring of a public culture." As Putnam himself acknowledges, but "passes over quickly," 

every regime that governed southern Italy from the Norman establishment of a centralized monarchy in the twelfth century to the unified government which took over there in 1861 was foreign and governed with a logic of colonial exploitation. Nor did southern Italy's semicolonial status suddenly disappear with unification. The region was joined to the North by a process of royal conquest, its fragile commercial sector brutally merged with the North's more flourishing economy, a uniform tax system and customs union imposed on its vulnerable industries, and brigandage rooted out by a full-scale military campaign. Politically, the South's communes and provinces were governed by northern administrators who regarded the region as a *terra dimissione*, and its economy was penetrated by carpetbaggers in search of new markets and raw materials ... Like the merger of West and East Germany 130 years later, a stronger, richer, more legitimate regime conquered a weaker, poorer, more marginal one, inducting its residents into political life through the tools of patronage, paternalism, and the power of money - and rubbing it in by sending in commissions of experts to shake their heads over their backwardness \(1996: 394\). 

I understand and appreciate this critique, the more so as I recall the path I followed, in the late 1960s, when first beginning to write about Western Sicily, based on fieldwork undertaken there with Peter Schneider. Indeed, my first article, in the *Anthropological Quarterly* of 1969, belaboring social fragmentation through an examination of "non-corporate groups" — cliques, coalitions, patron—client chains — attributed this pattern to an uncertain economy made marginal by Sicily's subordinate position not only within Italy but *vis-à-vis* international capitalism. The argument was developed more fully, and applied to a wider range of issues, in our jointly authored *Culture and Political Economy in Western Sicily* \(1976\). 

Part II of this book explores two Southern Italian intellectuals who were politically engaged with the crisis of the South in the earlier half of this century and whose Marxist formation or exposure, plus their affection for down home, led them to consider these colonial relations in depth. One, Antonio Gramsci, is already widely translated and familiar to English-language readers; the other, Ernesto de Martino, has been less accessible. Gramsci hailed from Sardinia, de Martino from Naples. A linguist by training, Gramsci influenced the younger de Martino, whose background was in humanist philosophy, anthropology, and folklore. For both figures, the South was above all a class-divided society, whose relations with the North, and with other both ancient and modern civilizations, were differently experienced by — and had different meanings for—peasant, landed, and urban social groups. Both asked what might be the historical role of southern peasants in redressing their own poverty and misery, raising the problem of southern agency as well as northern blame. 

Writing about Gramsci, Nadia Urbinati emphasizes his relational understanding of North and South, as mediated by their respective classes. What peripheralized the South was the "historic bloc" or alliance that southern agrarian élites formed with northern industrialists after Unification, especially around tariff policies that presumably advantaged both. Only a corresponding alliance of southern peasants with northern industrial workers could liberate the South — and the nation. It was important, therefore, to evaluate these peasants as historical actors. Did they meet the Marxist criteria for revolutionary class consciousness or were they, as their reputation had it, merely brigands, assassins of landlords, instinctual rebels driven by the "savage passions" of envy, resentment, and distrust? Gramsci broke new ground with his plea that the Italian Left communicate with southern peasants in terms of their common-sense understandings; show respect for their local dialects; look for progressive elements in their folklore; understand their fatalism as situational; find something positive and life-affirming in their passionate sense of justice; and anticipate the emergence of genuine, if untutored, intellectuals from among their ranks. Like the Neapolitan Liberals of a century earlier, who questioned heavy-handed methods of imposing Enlightenment culture on an ill-prepared hinterland, Gramsci understood, as Petrusewicz writes in presenting these Liberals, that "contempt for native customs and institutions" and "remoteness from popular sentiment" risked provoking a counter-revolution. 

Yet ultimately it must be questioned how far Gramsci stood outside the Southern Question discourse. His famous essay on the topic of 1926 described the South as "*una disgregazione sociale*" — a great social disintegration. His *Prison Notebooks,* moreover, depicted peasants as frequent generators of "traditional" intellectuals, above all priests and lawyers, but never of "organic" intellectuals, capable of leading their class in revolt. In the alliance he envisioned between southern peasants and northern industrial workers, the workers would take the lead \(Gramsci 1971 \[1929—1935\]: 6, incl. n. 4\). Peasants, Gramsci reiterated, in the section on "State and Civil Society," possess a "'generic' hatred \(which\) is still 'semi-feudal' rather than modern in character, and cannot be taken as evidence of class consciousness," only as "the first glimmer... the basic negative, polemical attitude" \(ibid.: 272-3\). 

Gramsci's pessimism about the capacity of southern peasants to act in history highlights a problem with political-economic critiques of culturalist or racialist essentializing. Do they really generate an alternative discourse or do they, rather, operate within, and reinforce, what they seek to criticize? On the one hand, political-economic accounts allow for malleability; the conditions observed are not considered fixed for all time, as if outside history, but as consequences of human action and therefore susceptible to change. On the other hand, however, it is characteristic of these accounts, Gramsci's included, to assume that the crisis of the South is pervasive, overlooking intra-regional variation. Understandings that emphasize relations of colonial intrusion and domination, moreover, locate responsibility for the disturbing phenomena in an external arena, leaving the victims in the passive position of having history done to them rather than making it themselves. In this respect, it is quite fascinating to consider the somewhat different approach of de Martino. 

De Martino's anthropological research, begun during the Second World War and lasting into the 1960s, expanded Gramsci's humanizing approach to the peasantry. This conclusion, however, is possible only after considering the author's work in its entirety. Annalisa Di Nola, who provides this volume with such a reading, begins by exposing passages on mourning rituals in Lucania that could easily lead a superficial reviewer to classify de Martino as a "modernization theorist," prepared to separate off peasant cultures from urban cultures — little traditions from great ones — and downgrade the former into backward, pre-literate survivals of an earlier, more primitive time. Di Nola also explores de Martino's reasons for rejecting the usual anthropological inoculation against this way of thinking: namely, cultural relativism. Without hegemonic, Western Enlightenment culture, he held, there would have been no anthropology. At the same time, however, de Martino insisted that anthropologists interrogate the categories they adopted for understanding other peoples. A trenchant critic of both evolutionism and functionalism in anthropology, he challenged concepts like "popular religion" and "survivals" for failing to locate peasants in history. As Di Nola shows, his analyses of ritual celebrations, including most famously, the healing cult of tarantism in Southern Italy, brought out dense entanglements over many centuries between popular practice and world religions, in which historical action went both ways. 

Yet although de Martino dignified Southern Italian peasants, rendering them intrinsically rational, and subjects rather than objects of history \(see Gribaudi 1996: 82\), he believed that a real transformation of their lives would be impossible without the engagement of the hegemonic forces of the nation - the Catholic Church and the industrial bourgeoisie. Whereas Gramsci, the more thorough Marxist, had looked to southern peasants' eventual alliance with northern factory workers as necessary for the liberation of both from precisely these forces, for de Martino the "molding energy" of élite cultures was potentially positive. In accordance with the relational emphasis of his folkloric studies, which insisted on a continuous circulation between élite and popular elements, he envisioned a possible shaping role for northern as well as southern power-holders in resolving southern problems — provided, however, that their approach was humanistically grounded and addressed issues of economic and social justice as well as culture, caveats that had yet to be fulfilled. 

In the final chapter of Part U, George Saunders compares Gramsci and De Martino with regard to the counter-intuitive ways that each understood religious beliefs and practices, above all magic, in the rural Mezzogiorno. For Gramsci, popular religion was implicitly and partially oppositional, thanks to the corruption of the southern clerical hierarchy. Yet its oppositional energy could be tapped for reactionary ends by the dominant classes and was, additionally, always in danger of breaking up and dissipating into fragments. The point for him was to get to know popular religion better, so as effectively to change it. 

De Martino was marginally more positive, addressing magical practices like the evil eye and conjuring in terms of his philosophy of "the presence" — an existential concept laid out by Di Nola, which refers to how persons maintain both their boundaries and their vitality in a precarious world. Almost like a strategy for coping, magic helped people resolve "crises of the presence," particularly in places such as rural Southern Italy where misery and exposure to a wide spectrum of traumas rendered life more uncertain than usual. Consistently with his criticism of the Catholic Church and the national bourgeoisie for failing to deploy a convincing amount of "molding energy" in the Mezzogiorno, de Martino also, however, drew attention to the society-wide distribution of evil eye beliefs in Southern Italy. At the time of the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies, they pervaded even the royal court. In Saunders's reading, de Martino, here, revealed himself to be still inside the Southern Question's "traditional versus modern" binary oppositions. 



## Exploring Alternatives

Today we are increasingly aware of Third World scholars who, like Gramsci and de Martino, have struggled with issues of popular culture and political agency, although from the perspective of Europe's actual colonies. Some - the Indian "subaltern studies" group - have found Gramsci to be the most relevant Marxist. Overall their work points up how little independence the popular traditions and values of agrarian Southern Italy had from wider processes of power, whether in actual practice or in the most generous strands of critical theory. We might contrast, for example, Fernando Ortiz, a Cuban ethnographer and public intellectual whose 1940 classic, *Cuban Counterpoint: Tobacco and Sugar*, has recently been reissued. In a new introduction \(supplementing that of Bronislaw Malinowski\), Fernando Coronil relates the "counterpoint" of the title to Ortiz's understanding that although the world "is forged by the violence of conquests and colonization," there are constant negotiations and conflicts over "defining the West and its Others, white and dark, man and woman, high and low" ... \(Coronil 1995: xiv\). 

Of significance for our story, Ortiz's first book of 1906 was influenced by the "evolutionary positivist theories" of Cesare Lombroso, who wrote the preface. By 1910, however, Ortiz had shifted from a racial to a cultural paradigm for explaining Cuban "backwardness," later to discard this too for another, double-edged understanding. On the one hand, colonialism — specifically the sugar plantation — was the source of Cuba's problems: on the other hand, Cuban popular music could bridge the otherwise threatening gap between the island and the ruling centers of Western civilization. With this conclusion, Ortiz established "the universal value of African and Afro-Cuban music," while relativizing "European music as the standard accomplishment" \(ibid.: xix\). In Coronil's words, "if the self-fashioning of sovereign centers entails the making of dependent peripheries, Ortiz celebrate\[d\] the self-fashioning of these peripheries, the counterpoint through which people turn margins into centers and make fluidly coherent identities out of fragmented histories" \(ibid.: iv\). 

Another relevant contrast with Southern Italy \(and with Gramsci and de Martino\) is Partha Chatterjee's analysis of Bengal under British rule, which argues that colonized peoples kept aside an inner, spiritual domain through which they nurtured their distinctive nationalisms. The colonial power was not allowed to intervene in this domain, whose language and institutions - mainly of religion, kinship, and community — put up a front of resistance to the Orientalist prejudice that herein lay an archaic, even barbaric "culture," characterized by too many passions and the mistreatment of women. By resistance Chatterjee means detecting the limits, the contradictions, the ideological implications, of Liberal projects to build "civil society," rather than welcoming such projects, or cultivating alliances within them, as de Martino and Gramsci were inclined to do. Not only did the values of civil society, or a "modern regime of power," derive from the specific history and culture of North Atlantic Europe; they had been imposed on India by alien rulers who premised their power on remaining above and apart. To insist on cultural differences with them in the "inner domains" of religion, language, and family life \(if not in the "outer domains" of statecraft, economy, and administration\) was the colonized's way of claiming historical agency \(1993: 28\). Again, Gramsci and de Martino envisioned a less disjunctive separation between "colonizers" and "colonized." 

For Chatterjee, the contradictions were especially acute in peasant politics. To the British colonists, Indian peasants were ignorant and exploitable, yet at the same time volatile and superstitious, "easily aroused by agitators and troublemakers," a perception that Indian nationalists invariably shared \(1993: 158—9\). And, indeed, peasant revolts were numerous, targeting such foci of authority as the police station, the landlord's rent-collection office, and the moneylender's house, "wrecking, burning, eating, and looting" what they could \(1993: 162—3\). Chatterjee seems more optimistic than Gramsci regarding this pattern of revolt. For him, the principle of community is a unifying feature of peasant consciousness \(distinct from the individual preferences and interests of middle-class consciousness\). Neither homogeneous nor egalitarian, communities nevertheless fostered alliances that grew out of the mutual bonds and obligations of propinquity and kinship - bonds that bourgeois "rationality" could not abide \(1993: 165-7\). In the South of Italy, by contrast, fragmentation and lack of trust characterized peasant communities, even in the evaluations of the native revolutionaries. 

The writings of Third World scholars like Ortiz and Chatterjee presuppose positions or arguments that, if they were applied to the Italian South, would lead one to seek out unsuspected domains of autonomy, hidden well-springs of opposition to the industrial capitalist civilizational system and its multiple, nested, Orientalist discourses. That these arguments were not produced by Southern Italian intellectuals is consistent with a fundamental feature of regional difference in Italy: until the present moment, and possibly even now, it is remarkably devoid of regional-nationalisms — that is, regional identities mobilized in support of separatist political goals, whether ethnic, religious, or linguistic. Except for a brief and rather easily coopted moment of Sicilian separatism at the end of the Second World War, identity movements have been remarkably absent from the Italian scene \(see Levy 1996; Lyttelton 1996; Herzfeld n.d.\), even though — or perhaps because — Italy, the nation, was only for a while, under fascism, subjected to an energetic nationalist push for uniformity in language and culture — a point I return to below. 

Meanwhile, because the intellectuals who were the strongest advocates for Southern Italian peasants found their uprisings to be anarchic and immature, and their cultural practices archaic, the historical conjuncture in which the South was both more agrarian than urban and the site of ongoing peasant attacks on landlords and tax collectors, did not produce a lasting or deep critique of the Orientalist mode of representing these rural folk. It has taken both a transformation of southern society, in which peasants have given way to other classes, and the emergence of new cohorts of intellectuals for whom the revolutionary potential of the peasantry is no longer a relevant issue, to arrive at challenging alternatives. Part III introduces a small sample of the many contemporary Southern Italian scholars, writers, and political actors who are currently engaged in addressing, breaking down, and seeing beyond the powerful processes of regional stereotyping that have trapped even the best-intentioned advocates for the South up to now. 

The first essay by John Davis summarizes the work of several young historians whose research exposes established interpretations of the economic "failure" of the Mezzogiorno as over-simplistic. They criticize, in particular, the past neglect of genuine growth in the production and export of value-added cash crops and processed foods. Attending to the distribution, and the ups and downs, of orchards, gardens, and vineyards, one discovers that even the latifundia were less feudal and more commercial, less monocultural and more varied, than their image; that the above-noted "historic bloc" of southern landowners and northern industrialists was opposed by— and devastating for — *some* of these landowners; that the 1880s marked a turning-point in the structuring of *international* markets that harmed South Italian producers; and that, given these producers' precarious integration into world markets, their tendency to rely on short-term, multi-sectoral investment strategies should not be criticized but admired. In support of this research direction, we might add that the 1880s was the point at which the Italian South and Sicily became massive exporters of people. Precisely as the Southern Question took its turn toward a racialized essentialism, Italy, the nation, began to encourage the exodus of millions of its southern inhabitants \(see Schneider and Schneider 1996\). 

Citing recent historical research on social and political formations in Northern Italy, the Davis essay also opens up a new perspective on clientelism in the South. Southern élites are shown to have been historically much more vulnerable than their northern counterparts to upheaval in the countryside, and to have sought out state protection to keep their peasants at bay. Conversely, the Italian state, always relatively "weak" in the South, "played on and indeed perpetuated factional rivalries and divisions" among these élites, becoming thereby "an important agent of political fragmentation and disunity." That this reciprocal conditioning has now ended makes sense of Carlo Trigilia's impressive case for the growth, since 1980, of an ever richer associational life, both cultural and political, in Southern Italy \(Trigilia 1995; see also Tarrow 1996: 392\). 

Similar issues are addressed by Simona Piattoni in her chapter on the micro-politics of small, sub-regional zones within the region called "South." Piattoni is especially insistent on the reality of "many souths," so much so that, in her view, one must even look closely at the pervasive southern practice of clientelism in politics, disaggregating this stereotype for its possibly different meanings and manifestations in different times and places. Personalistic or patron-client relations are not the simple sign of backwardness that Banfield and Putnam would have us believe; nor are the centers of industrial capitalism devoid of them — witness the scandals surrounding influence-peddling and political-party financing in Northern Italy \(and the United States\) today. Rejecting constructions of the South as homogeneous, and culturally and socially distinct from an equally homogeneous North, Piattoni ingeniously argues that some patrons, in competing for clients, contribute to the development of a civic culture with salutary consequences for economic growth, and that this has demonstrably happened in some of the micro-regions of the South. We are reminded of Caroline White's 1980 ethnography of two contrastive South Italian towns of the Fucino Basin, which, although neighbors, had strikingly different political cultures \(White 1980\). 

In their chapter, Peter and Jane Schneider discuss how, in the 1960s, Leonardo Sciascia, the grand fatalist, ironically was considered, and considered himself, a leading Sicilian intellectual in social and political movements that would curtail the influence of the mafia. They compare that epoch with the 1980s, a decade during which antimafia activists in Sicily as well as Italy came to see the novelist as very nearly a traitor to their cause. Sciascia, meanwhile, had accused these activists of riding roughshod over "ways of being Sicilian." This dispute, which was far from resolved when Sciascia died at the end of the decade, is a poignant instance not of inertia — of the failure of collective action — but of its risks. Social solidarity is undermined, not by an inherently agonistic *culture*, but rather by the complexities of confronting an institution — the mafia — whose history has been one of aggressively embedding itself both in the regional society and in national politics. There is no one way to be against it. A few contemporary antimafia activists draw parallels between the last twenty years of mafia history and the Nazi regime in Germany \(for example, Siebert 1994\). Sciascia, his antimafia reputation notwithstanding, took an opposite stance: in defending Sicilian culture against the "mafia of the antimafia," he seemed to be saying, "we have so far avoided fascism here but I see it on the horizon." 

The last chapter of Part III is offered by Robert Dombroski, who analyses the de-territorialized characters and situations in the writings of two contemporary Sicilian novelists, Vincenzo Consolo and Gesualdo Bufalino. According to Dombroski, they locate Sicily fully within the orbit of today's "postmodern" spaces, not radically apart from, indeed a beacon for, an increasingly global swirl of cultural elements. Reminiscent of de Martino's discoveries, the elements are shown to derive not from past marginality or barbarism, but from Sicily's historic location at the crossroads of civilizations. The trope of fatalism, so easily assimilated to rurality, tradition, and pagan superstition - to a model of the island as a mystery, a land that missed the Enlightened sweep of progress — gives way to images of a highly cosmopolitan, if fragmentary, series of engagements taking place over hundreds of years. Meanwhile, Western technological and scientific culture is depicted as propagating exploitative, imperialist, and consumerist relations that efface not past "traditions" but past civilizational histories, even cementing over their splendid architectural bequests to future generations. Cutting across and breaking up the unilinear narrative of southern backwardness, this kind of writing constitutes a provocative challenge. 

It is salutary, in deconstructing an Orientalist discourse like the Southern Question, to recognize the extent to which its mirror image — the Occidentalism against which it is dialectically depicted - claims a progressive trajectory, an imagined direction for history, in which humans strive to create free, democratic, economically developed and prosperous "civil societies." What if, as Hermann Rebel heuristically asks of eighteenth-century Austrian history, we imagine a different ending, such as the terrible episodes that unfolded in Europe during and between the two world wars \(see Rebel 1991\). In this respect, it is significant to discover that Putnam's text has only three very brief references to fascism references couched dismissively as the "Fascist interlude" \(1993: 19\) or "parenthesis" \(ibid.: 233, n. 91\). Nor does he acknowledge any redeeming virtue in southerners' tendency to take the National Fascist Party less seriously than did their northern compatriots \(above all in the North's "most civic regions, such as Emilia Romagna . ..": 1993: 97\). As a coda to Michael Blim's concluding essay, in Part IV, this volume presents Mariella Pandolfi's reflections on the problem of failed nationhood in Italy - reflections that take account of the Fascist regime, including its commitment to avenge Abyssinia, and consolidate Italy's tenuous assertions over Libya, Eritrea, and Somalia,
