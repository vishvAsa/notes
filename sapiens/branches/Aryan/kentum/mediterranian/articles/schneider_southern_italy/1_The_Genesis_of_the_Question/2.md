The Emergence of the Southern Question in Villari, Franchetti, and Sonnino

*Nelson Moe *

During the second half of the 1870s, Pasquale Villari, Leopoldo Franchetti, and Sidney Sonnino elaborated a new vision of southern Italy. Their writings articulated for the first time the regional specificity of the social, political, and economic conditions of the South, inaugurating both the Southern Question and the field of *meridionalismo*. While these three men were pioneers in setting the terms of a question and a field "that situates the South at the center of its analysis and, even more importantly, at the center of national political life" \(Barbagallo 1979: 7\), it is important to note that their work formed part of a broader cultural trend. Over the course of the 1870s, the South increasingly attracted the attention of folklorists, visual artists, and writers, most notably Giovanni Verga. What marks this decade is the proliferation of discursive and pictorial representations of the South in a variety of fields. While this essay does not explore the relations between the emergence of *meridionalismo* and the representation of the South in these other domains, this is the broader context in which the Meridionalist writings of Villari, Franchetti, and Sonnino can be framed.1 



## The Southern Question in Villari's *Lettere meridionali*

With *Le lettere meridionali*, Pasquale Villari helped to establish a new conceptual framework within which to think about the South in the context of post-unification Italy. Before turning to these *Letters*, it is worth noting that Villari fostered an interest in the South in other ways both before and after the publication of the *Lettere meridionali* in 1875. Already in his 1872 essay, "La scuola e la questione sociale in Italia," he had called upon writers to visit the popular quarters of Naples and "describe them minutely, depict the life and moral conditions of those people, and denounce them to the civilized world as an Italian crime;"2 and it was just such urgings, along with the impact of the *Letters* themselves, that had some part in prompting the likes of Franchetti, Sonnino, Jessie White Mario, Renato Fucini, Matilde Serao, Giustino Fortunato, Pasquale Turiello, and, later, Gaetano Salvemini to produce, between the mid-1870s and the mid-1880s, an extraordinarily rich and varied body of literature about the social conditions of the South.3 

A Neapolitan exile in Florence \(see Petrusewicz, this volume\), Villari was, then, an "agitator" who stirred a wide range of thinkers into investigating the South \(Salvadori 1976: 38\). But it was certainly the *Letters* themselves that had the greatest impact on élites of the day. As Pasquale Turiello commented in 1877: 

If, a few years from now, our professors of sociology and economy also refer to the conditions of the Neapolitan and Sicilian peasant. . . that will probably be due to a set of letters published in *L'Opinione* in 1875, written by Pasquale Villari, on the social conditions of the Neapolitan and Sicilian peasants. For it was then .. . that a small group of Italians interested in our social problems came into existence; and the question, which even impartial observers had previously ignored, suddenly seemed to take on a capital importance.4 

Villari first published his *Letters* in *L'Opinione*, the influential journal of the Right, which, in Chabod's words, "in part expressed the frame of mind of the governing moderates and in part contributed to its formation" \(Chabod 1996: 329\). However obvious it may seem, the first point to make about Villari's text is that it is written in the form of letters, addressed to the journal's editor Giacomo Dina. A contemporary of Villari's from Turin, Dina played an important role in almost three decades of Italian political history and in a sense personified that restricted group of liberal élites who were the effective addressees of Villari's *Letters*.5 

In a moment we shall examine the particular set of concepts, figures, and rhetorical strategies through which Villari represents the South to the readers of *L'Opinione*. What is crucial to bear in mind at the outset is the critical thrust of these texts; they in fact constitute a polemic against his very readership, the liberal élites who had directed and shaped the process of Italian unification over the previous decade and a half. Villari had already voiced his disillusionment with the contemporary Italian state and society in his groundbreaking essay, "Di chi è la colpa," of 1866. There, after the humiliating defeats of Custoza and Lissa at the hands of the Austrians, he argued that it was time for Italy to wake up to the fact that 

in the very bosom of the nation there is an enemy more powerful than Austria, and it is our colossal ignorance, it is the illiterate multitudes, the unthinking burocrats, the ignorant teachers, the childish politicians, the impossible diplomats, the incompetent generals, the unskilled worker, the patriarchal farmer, and the rhetoric that eats away at our soul. It is not the quadrilateral of Mantua and Verona that stopped our progress: it is the quadrilateral of seventeen million illiterates and five million rhetoricians \(in Villari 1885: 303-4\). 

Villari takes aim here at a wide range of "domestic" problems. But over the course of the next ten years, and particularly after the Paris Commune helped to sensitize élites to the Social Question, Villari's focus became sharper on two fronts. On the one hand, he formulated an increasingly pointed critique of the manner in which Italy's élites had governed the country since unification; on the other hand, he focused on that problem which at some level summed up the most urgent issues facing the nation: the social conditions of Southern Italy. In the first case, the fundamental problem consisted of the liberal élites' isolation from the people, in itself not an original theme in Risorgimento thought.6 Villari's approach to it, however, is unique. On the floor of parliament in 1876, Villari spoke of it in these terms: 

We, my dear colleagues, brought about a revolution, which was largely the work of an intelligent, educated, and disinterested bourgeoisie . . . The people were in such conditions as not to be able to participate in the revolution, and were in a sense therefore dragged along by us. But precisely because we stood alone in this effort, because we alone were intent on completing the creation of a free Italy, even though we wished to do what was best for the nation as a whole, we found ourselves, without knowing it or wanting it, isolated in a closed circle, and we almost came to think that our little world was the whole world, forgetting that outside our narrow circle there is a vastly numerous class, to which Italy has never given a thought, and which it must finally take into consideration \(p. 397\). 

A year later, in the noted essay "Ciò che gli stranieri non osservano in Italia," he described the problem similarly. Again he granted that none of the country's politicians had lost any of their patriotic spirit or "deliberately lost sight of the common good": "but all of society found itself in the hands of an extremely limited group of people which, closed up in an all too narrow sphere, naturally came to believe that its world was the whole world, and that there were no interests which differed from those which it saw and felt" \(pp. 243—4\). Both of these statements vividly express the élites' isolation from the people in terms of an inability to see beyond their "closed circle" and "narrow sphere." What is particularly noteworthy about the first quotation is the tension it expresses between "Italy," understood as "our narrow circle," and "the nation as a whole." His statement that "Italy has never given a thought" to the people highlights the latter's effective exclusion from the former, just as he charges "Italy" with the task of broadening its perspective to include that "vastly numerous class" that up till now it has ignored. 

Now in Villari's *Lettere meridionali*, it is precisely the South that comes to represent those people, problems, and "interests" that have been forgotten or ignored by the country's élites, sequestered in their narrow sphere of command and privilege. But if, on the one hand, the South desperately needs the political attention and material assistance of Italy's ruling class, the ruling class, in Villari's profoundly moral view of the problem \(Salvadori 1976: 34\), also has need of the South. For Villari insists that the restrictive vision of the country's élites, which was a political necessity during the struggle to unite Italy, has, in the context of post-unification Italy, resulted in a state of moral bankruptcy. As in the passage from "Di chi è la colpa" of 1866 cited above, the problem is formulated here in terms of the waning of those "external," heroic struggles of the Risorgimento and the consequent need "to turn all our attention inward."7 But here the emphasis on the void in the "heart of each citizen" is much more pronounced.8 In this new "prosaic" age \(Croce 1963: 2\) in which the statesman's highest aim is to balance the budget and the scholar's to obtain steady employment, it is the liberation of the suffering masses, and the masses of the South in particular, that could "give us back our lost ideal."9 

But just how is it that the South comes to perform this function in Villari's moral geography of the nation? In the following discussion I want to examine the way Villari elaborates what will prove to be a defining feature of Meridionalist discourse from this point forward: the exceptional nature of the South, its peculiarity and radical difference with respect to the rest of Italy and, indeed, modern European civilization as a whole. As we shall see, Villari's discourse vacillates between the desire to affirm the South's common bonds with the rest of Italy, which springs from the unitary imperative that Villari shares with all the early Meridionalists, and an insistence on a peculiarity that ends up transforming the South into a *regio dissimilitudinis*, a place unlike any other, irreconcilable to the modalities of modern society. 

What is striking about the *Southern Letters*, then, is that the South does not initially appear to be their main theme. In the prefatory remarks the author wrote for the various editions of the *Letters* \(the opening of the first letter, and the prefaces to the 1878 and 1885 editions\), Villari describes the *Letters '* main concerns in the following manner: in 1875 he introduces them as an investigation into "the state of the poorest classes, especially in the southern provinces" \(p. 1\); in the preface to the 1878 edition he comments that "the writings that I have collected in this volume regard more or less the same question," which is to say the miserable plight of the multitudes, "and above all those that live from agriculture" \(p. xxvi; in this preface, it is worth noting, no mention of the South is made whatsoever\); and in the preface to the second edition of 1885, Villari writes of "two questions" of principal concern — "the miserable state of our masses in certain cities, above all in Naples; the no less miserable conditions of our peasants in many parts of Italy" \(p. vii\). Finally, we must recall the book's title itself, *Lettere meridionali ed altri scritti sulla questione sociale in Italia*. 

In Villari's presentation, the *Southern Letters*, then, are about the miserable conditions of both the rural and urban masses and more generally -- as the book's title indicates — about the "social question," where the South is singled out as a regional case of special importance. The South's problems are thus situated in a general, national context and, as we will see more clearly below, this is one of the central premisses of Villari's enterprise. Yet if Villari's presentation of the *Letters'* themes serves to orient our reading towards problems of a national scope, the titles of the individual letters suggest the importance of the local context. *"Camorra"* "Mafia," "Brigandage," are all phenomena that are typically and \(except in the case of brigandage\) exclusively southern. And this tension between the general and specific, the national and local, runs throughout the *Letters*. While Villari presents his concerns in a national framework, his actual descriptions, observations, and analyses underscore the southern specificity of these problems. 

This interplay between the national and regional is immediately evident in the first letter, dedicated to the *camorra* and the conditions of the masses in Naples. At the beginning of his discussion, Naples is introduced as that city, "among many, in which the low plebs find themselves, I won't say in the greatest misery, because that is not what is worst, but in the greatest abandon, in the most grievous degradation and dejection" \(pp. 3—4\). Naples is therefore introduced as a special case of the "miserable state of the masses" in various Italian cities. The highly charged rhetoric he employs and the vividness of his descriptions tend however to undermine the proposition that these conditions can also be found elsewhere, albeit to a lesser degree; each detail, name, anecdote, story, communicates the pecularity of this place and its problems. The *camorra*, as he writes, may well be "the logical, natural, necessary consequence of a certain social condition" \(p. 1\) that exists in other parts of the country. But his noted descriptions of the Neapolitan slums and of the string-makers leave us with the impression that these conditions are somehow *uniquely* Neapolitan. Quoting a letter from an architect in Naples,10 he writes 

These slums . . . generally have an entryway, without any opening on to the street, and a little courtyard, both utterly filthy, which open on to an immense quantity of terrible dwellings, much worse than kennels in fact. All of them, but especially those on the ground-floor, lack air and light and are extremely humid. In these slums several thousand people live piled on top of one another, so degraded by misery that they seem more brutes than men. In those dens, into which you can't enter because of the stench of the garbage that's been piled up there for ages, one often sees no more than a pile of straw, destined to be the bed of an entire family, male and female all together. Latrines of course are non-existent, for the streets and courtyards suffice for those needs \(p. 5\). 

This is only the first of a number of scenes of "la miseria" in the *Letters —* "ever varied, brutal, and horrible" — that serve the explicit purpose of shocking his readers out of their state of indifference to the plight of the masses, an attitude that Villari elsewhere calls "incredible."11 What is clear at this point is that before the descriptive power of these "lurid kennels, these terrible grottoes, and degraded inhabitants," these "unhappy, degraded people" that crawl out into the sunlight "like ants" \(p. 7\), the general category of the "social question in Italy" recedes into the background. With each passing description Naples appears more exceptional, if not a case unto itself: "in no other country on the earth do the terrible consequences of Malthus's theory appear more clearly" \(p. 12\). It is therefore the scene of the string-makers' caves that remains imprinted in the reader's imagination \(p. 6\),12 or that of the poor widow who, in her cold, darkened den, bangs a rock against the wall in a desperate attempt to frighten the rats away from her sleeping children.13 

Villari, in fact, seems to recognize this problem at some level for, at the end of the letter, he attempts to reframe his discussion of Naples and the *camorra* at the general level. He writes that he will cite an example from the North "in order to show that the ill is general and in order to dispel the impression that I wish to take all my examples from the South of Italy" \(p. 14\). But this very move serves to underscore the force of the former examples by comparison with the latter. The series of statistics he cites regarding poverty in Venice lacks even a brief description of the specific conditions of the Venetian poor, and thus, while the reader may take him at his word — "the ill is general" — the ill one remembers is that of Naples. 

In his first *Southern Letter* on the *camorra*, Villari thus raises not so much the "question of the cities" as the "question of Naples," unique and incomparable.14 Something similar occurs in the following letter dedicated to the "ills that afflict Sicily," above all the mafia. Here too Villari suggests that the ills of the region constitute examples of a more general social — and, in this case, agrarian — question. Yet, to an even greater extent than in the previous letter, what is salient in Villari's account is the singular aspects of these ills and, more generally, the peculiarity of the Sicilian Question. 

In the first place, Villari addresses the problem of working conditions in the Sicilian sulfur mines, suggesting that they are representative of those in other areas and industries. But the overall effect of his discussion is quite the opposite. To begin with, sulfur is Sicily's major industry, and closely tied up with the island's economic identity; it is, in some way, typically Sicilian. At the same time, he underscores the particularity of the Sicilian sulfur mines, noting that while other countries with mining industries have sought to protect miners and especially child workers, no such thing has happened in Sicily. Finally, as with his account of the Neapolitan slums, he depicts the working conditions in the mines in a sensational fashion, confronting the reader with scenes of unforgettable human degradation and suffering: 

These human beings are subjected to a form of labor which, described day in, day out, seems ever more cruel, if not impossible. Hundreds of boys and girls descend along steep embankments and rickety ladders, stuck into soil which is crumbling or saturated with water. Having reached the bottom of the mine, they are loaded with rocks, which they must then carry upwards on their backs, slipping on that steep and treacherous earth at the risk of falling and dying an instant death. The older approach the top sending out horrendous screams; the children arrive in tears \(pp. 18—19\). 

In the case of the mafia, the particularity of Sicily — and of the mafia as a synechdocal representative of it — emerges with even greater clarity. Here Villari offers comparatively little in the way of graphic descriptions of human misery, entering instead into an extensive, and at times confusing, analysis of the social and economic conditions of Western Sicily that seemed to have produced the mafia. He expresses his surprise at discovering that the highest levels of criminality are to be found, not among the poor, but among the well-to-do farmers, and notes how this fact seems to "overthrow every rule of political economy and social science" \(p. 24\). The mafia, in short, seems to confound his analytical intent, and this difficulty results in what is probably the least persuasive and engaging part of the *Southern Letters*. His conclusion that the two great "calamities" of Western Sicily — the sulfur mines and the mafia — are generated by "the special conditions of its agriculture" \(p. 32\) constitutes a kind of admission that these are not problems that can be easily related to the agricultural conditions in the rest of Italy. For while he claims they are "aspects" of the Agrarian Question, they are nevertheless problems that can only be understood and remedied in terms of their specific, local conditions. 

In the penultimate letter of the series, dedicated to brigandage, Villari continues to emphasize the peculiarity of the South in the manner described above. Brigandage, he writes, "is the gravest ill that we can observe in our countryside. As is well known, it is certainly the consequence of an agrarian and social question which afflicts almost all the provinces of southern Italy" \(p. 38\). Here Villari writes with even more extensive commentary and anecdotal description, and heightened rhetorical power. The ensuing series of descriptions of the plight of the southern Italian peasants produces the distinct impression that the South is profoundly different from the rest of the nation. In the first letter, Villari adheres more closely to his initial proposition, that the framework in which to view these problems is a general, national one. But, after the passing reference made to Venice in the first letter, the North falls by the wayside. Or rather it now appears in an antithetical position with respect to the South. Villari introduces Franchetti into his discussion - from whose study of the Neapolitan provinces he cites liberally in this letter as one who was "grievously scandalized to see things which must have seemed impossible to him, a native of Tuscany where the peasant is not only a free and independent man, but a true associate of his master ..." \(p. 44\). To the scandalized Tuscan Franchetti, the degradation of the southern peasants "calls to mind the age of slavery," in so far as the master "has the unlimited right to demand services from his peasants, and exercises it widely" \(p. 46\). 

Here, in fact, the figure of slavery is repeated numerous times, along with other terms and tropes that emphasize the singularly abject condition of the Southern Italian peasants. For the most part, these are scandalous analogies, references \(like slavery, Ireland, the Middle Ages\) that are blatantly out of place \(and time\) with respect to contemporary Italy. Thus, reflecting on the conditions in the South under the Bourbons and how, since unification, the state of the peasants has remained unchanged, if not worsened \(p. 45\), Villari writes: "America has shown by its example that in many cases the enslavement of the negroes harmed the slave's master most of all, because he was thereby corrupted by the unjust dominion that he exercised. Shouldn't an unlimited dominion not over blacks, but over men of the same race, corrupt as well?" \(p. 43\). And in the final letter, dedicated to "The Remedies," Villari describes the relations between landlord and peasant in a similar vein: 

The landlord finds himself isolated in the middle of an army of peasants. The submission of the latter is immense .. . But all this is not the result of affection or esteem. He could kneel down before his master with the same feeling with which the Indian worships the tempest or lightening. The day that this charm were broken, the peasant would rise up to avenge himself ferociously with long-repressed hatred, with his brutal passions. Some times, in fact, one has seen hordes of slaves transformed into hordes of cannibals \(p. 57\). 

The overall effect of these repeated analogies is of course to emphasize the South's deviation from the norm of social justice and good government, which, while occasionally associated with Prussia, England, and Tuscany, generally functions as an unstated term of comparison in the text. Villari writes of the "marvel" "the foreigner" feels upon finding no middle class in southern Italian cities as an intermediary between landowners and peasants \(p. 42\), and this sense of marvel, accompanied by outrage, characterizes Villari's rhetoric throughout. The South is thus, above all, remarkable, extraordinary, exceptional. Towards the end of the final letter Villari stresses — as he had at the end of the first — that Southern Italy is not the only part of the country "in which the peasants suffer unjustly" \(p. 63\). On this occasion he in fact provides a page and a half of descriptions and details from the Veneto and Lombardy, which create an effective link between conditions in the South and other parts of Italy. But it nevertheless represents only a brief parenthesis in the letter, and at its conclusion Villari reasserts the difference between North and South in quantitative terms: "The ill exists in many provinces, but in the provinces of southern Italy its dimensions are much greater" \(p. 65\). 

As I noted at the beginning of this discussion, Villari represents the South in the *Letters* not only as a problem for the people of the South but as a matter of capital importance to the élites of the nation. Isolated in their "narrow sphere," the élites *need* the South, or - more precisely - need to concern themselves with the South, in order to "reawaken in us that moral life without which a nation has no purpose, no true existence" \(p. 67\). Yet, as we have seen, Villari's attempt to make the Southern Question seem a national problem was undermined at some level by the power of his own representations, which tended to situate the ills of the South in a remote region ofunlikeness with respect to the rest of Italy. In the concluding statement of the *Letters*, Villari addresses this problem head on, formulating it as an imagined objection, which, he writes, "some, out of patriotism, don't make, but which they nevertheless harbor in their hearts": 

Fortunately, they say to themselves, not all of Italy is in the same condition as the Southern Provinces. If the peasants and poor are in such a terrible condition *down there*, if the educated do not fulfill their obligations, ignoring and failing to improve this state of affairs, tough luck for them; they'll just have to remain in their semi-barbarous state a while longer. In central and northern Italy we will be, as we are, civilized \(p. 69\). 

This imaginary objection touches on precisely that problem of regional peculiarity examined earlier. For Villari's imagined dissenter, the South's problems are specifically and exclusively southern; and, perhaps most importantly, they are *down there*, far from the civilized regions of central-northern Italy. The Southern Question is not our national problem, but theirs. 

Not surprisingly, Villari responds to this objection by reiterating the unitary, national perspective he had announced at the beginning. But he does so in a striking fashion that merits quoting in its entirety: 

Let's forget the fact that many problems, as I stated earlier, plague central and northern Italy as well. And let's assume, for the sake of argument, that Italy is in fact divided in the way my uncharitable opponents insist. But if they wished to draw such a conclusion from this state of affairs they should have thought about it before, leaving intact the Great Wall of China which the Bourbons had constructed \[between northern and southern Italy\], After the unification and liberation of Italy, everything has gotten mixed together in the army, the navy, the judicial system, the administration, etc. The guilt of the more civilized provinces is equal to the guilt of the more educated and well-to-do classes that abandon the more ignorant and derelict classes of one and the same society to their own destiny. And the consequences are the same. Today the peasant who goes to die in the countryside around Rome, or who suffers from hunger in his own village, and the poor man who wastes away in the hovels of Naples can say to us and to you: After the unification of Italy, you've got no way out — either turn us into civilized people, or we'll turn you into barbarians. And we men of the Mezzogiorno have the right to say to those of central and northern Italy: Your indifference and our indifference would be equally immoral and guilty \(p. 70\). 

How then does Villari counter the impression that the South's problems are somehow separate from the North, an impression that, we have seen, he himself helped to create? The pre-unification division between northern and southern Italy has been replaced, he argues, by a commingling of people from the two regions in the nation's various public institutions. This point, it would seem, could be readily acknowledged by all sides. But it evidently does not go far enough, for while it has northerners and southerners working together in the same institutions, it still leaves the two parts of the country — and their problems — where they were: in different places, with a fault line running between them. Villari thus offers a more thoroughgoing reconceptualization of the relationship through an analogy that replaces the horizontal and geographical concept of North/South with the vertical concept of a single hierarchical society: the North is to the South as the "more educated and well-to-do classes" are to the "more ignorant and derelict." North and South are, then, highly differentiated, but in such a way that one recognizes the relationship between the two in terms of the supposed obligations the upper classes feel towards the lower classes *of their own society*. The substitution for a geographical conceptualization of social difference of a political one enables him to argue for a northern obligation towards the southerners that otherwise would not be felt. 

Having done this, all that remains for Villari to do is provide a more dramatic expression of this newly conceived relationship. And what more effective way to do this than by letting this underclass, through a form of rhetorical ventriloquism, appeal to the nation's élites? Yet this formulation contains something more than just an appeal for social justice; it is in fact a threat: "either turn us into civilized people, or we'll turn you into barbarians." 

There are two things about this formulation, and about this final passage more generally, that I would like to consider briefly in conclusion. In the first place, it recapitulates the gist of the *Letters* as a whole, which is to say it articulates the differentiation between the two regions *in the spirit of national unity*. The educated, affluent, civilized North must help the ignorant, derelict, barbaric South. In the second place, it is interesting to note where Villari situates himself in this new geopolitical schema of a "more educated and affluent" North and a "more ignorant and derelict" South. On the one hand he places himself among the southern élites \("we men of the Mezzogiorno"\). On the other hand, the text's pronouns graphically represent the fact that he and the southern élites like him occupy an intermediary, and somewhat shifty, position *vis-à-vis* these two worlds. The underclasses of the South can apostrophize "us" \(the élites of the South\) and "you" \(the élites of the North\) as the common object of their threat. But if the southern élites are joined with those of the North as the addressee in the first clause, in the clause that follows they are separated. Here, instead, "we men of the South" charge "those of central and northern Italy" — and themselves as well — with the moral responsibility of helping the southern people. 

In this interplay of pronouns, the role of Villari, the Neapolitan-Florentine, as intermediary between the southern and northern élites and as representative of the southern masses to both is evident. What this means is that the novelty of Villari's *Lettere meridionali* may therefore lie not only in their launching of a new analytical field but in their inauguration of a new intellectual function: that, precisely, of the Meridionalist, the writer, from northern or southern Italy, who endeavors to provide a representation of the South to the nation's élites, especially in the North. In the following section on Franchetti and Sonnino, we shall see the important role this northern point of reference plays in each of these authors' visions of the South and Sicily in particular. 



## Franchetti's Sicily

If, as Leopoldo Franchetti once said, Pasquale Villari was the "revered master of the Southern Question" \(Jannazzo 1986: 23\), Franchetti and his close collaborator Sidney Sonnino were no mere epigoni. Both men were profoundly indebted to Villari's "lesson": the *Southern Letters* were one of the sources of inspiration for their groundbreaking investigation of Sicily in 1876; and *Rassegna settimanale,* the main journal of Meridionalist discussion that Franchetti and Sonnino edited between 1878 and 1882, was Villari's brainchild. They themselves were original thinkers, however, and with respect to Villari's *Lettere meridionali* the investigations of Franchetti and Sonnino in fact "represent a more advanced and in-depth phase of study of the socio-economic reality of the South" \(R. Villari 1979: 72\). 

In this section I focus on Franchetti's 1876 study. *Condizioni politiche e amministrative della Sicilia* \(Franchetti 1985\). I should stress, however, that because their Meridionalist work was of such a profoundly collaborative nature, on many occasions I refer to Franchetti and Sonnino together in this essay: their first studies were published in a single volume in 1875 \(Franchetti's *Condizioni economiche e amministrative delle provincie napoletane* and Sonnino's *La mezzeria in Toscana*\); their second, more famous pair of studies, comprising Franchetti's *Condizioni politiche e amministrative della Sicilia* and Sonnino's *I contadini in Sicilia*, was conceived, researched, and published together as *La Sicilia nel 1876;* and, finally, between 1878 and 1882 they co-edited *Rassegna settimanale*. My focus on Franchetti's 1876 study is partly motivated by the fact that his investigation is of a more sociological nature than the technical, agrarian-economic analysis of Sonnino. At the same time, Franchetti's study was a more influential text than Sonnino's, a "foundational work" through which the Southern Question "began to enter into the consciousness of scholars and politicians, if not of the more general public" \(Gatto 1950: 229\). Most importantly, the geopolitical vision that Franchetti formulates in this text constitutes one of the most powerful conceptualizations of the difference and division between North and South ever written. 

Let us begin with a brief consideration of Franchetti's earlier study of the continental South, which marks out many of the themes and problems that will be articulated with greater rigor and rhetorical force in his 1876 study of Sicily. Started in the autumn of 1873 and published a few months after Villari's *Lettere meridionali* in the summer of 1875, Franchetti's study of the "economic and administrative condition of the Neapolitan provinces" manifests a number of affinities with Villari's text \(at one level, of course, there is a direct link between them, in so far as Villari cites passages from Franchetti's 1875 study, as we saw in our discussion of the *Southern Letters\)*. In the opening lines, Franchetti announces that he has "called things by their real names and used harsh expressions where they seemed justified" \(1985: 3\). Like Villari, Franchetti thus adopts a critical attitude to the southern reality under investigation, seeking to bring to light unseemly realities previously ignored or hidden from the ken of the country's élites. Franchetti then makes a move that, as we saw, was central to the conclusion of Villari's *Letters*: he issues a patriotic appeal to the common destiny of all Italians, claiming that the problems of the South are not those of southerners alone: "We are all Italians, their disgraces are our disgraces, we are weak with their weakness" \(1985: 3\). Like Villari, Franchetti attempts to "nationalize" the problems of the South, dissolving the force of regional difference in an equation of theirs is ours, they are us. 

Certain differences between the two texts, however, are also readily apparent. In the first place, the subtitle of Franchetti's work, "travel notes," reminds us that the writer is a foreign observer. Franchetti in fact raises this point in the passage cited above, where he writes that he would be "profoundly saddened" if his southern readers, acting out of local pride, rejected his harsh assessment of the conditions in the South simply because he was a "foreigner." It is just this expression of local interest that prompts the unitarian statement cited above \("We are all Italians"\), which is an attempt to efface the difference between local and foreigner, southerner and northerner, which threatens to distort the reception of his text. 

Yet, as in Villari, this disclaimer of regional difference functions as a rhetorical frame that is at odds with the emphasis on regional particularity within the text. Here, too, what quickly emerges is the singular negativity of the conditions in these provinces. But whereas Villari, the Neapolitan, tried to render the South through a kind of impassioned identification with it, most clearly reflected in his attempt to give voice to the southern masses at the conclusion of the *Letters*, Franchetti articulates a South that is clearly foreign to him, the representative of a different and superior civilization. With greater analytical rigor, Franchetti articulates a more systematic contrast between his world and that of the southern provinces, whereas the morally outraged Villari managed to acknowledge a certain human truth to the South. Franchetti instead represents the South as a perverse realm of social disorder and moral degradation in which human existence cannot be conceived of according to the standard measure of European civilization.15 We see this, for example, in Franchetti's observations on the nature of the relations between peasants and landlords in Abruzzi and Molise: "Truly, if one thinks about these facts, which appear contradictory to the man accustomed to civilization, they all seem equally typical of the state of primitives; a state of barbarism, ignorant of all the relations and laws that keep society together as a whole, from the laws of the family to that of public safety" \(1985: 18\). In another passage, the use of the foreigner's perspective, and the corresponding sense of incredulity, is even more explicit. 

At the sight of this desolation, the foreigner is tempted to think that in that country some great disaster occurs every year after the harvest, some invasion, some conquest that robs them of the fruits of the whole year's labor and prevents them from putting anything aside so as to improve the fields, so as to eliminate the fever; or that for centuries and centuries the bad harvests have followed upon one another without respite and have left just enough for the landlords and workers to eat and plant again; or that the country is inhabited by a special category of men which, in the midst of cultivated lands, has preserved the improvidence of the savages of the American plains and which, having eaten well or poorly, does not feel that desire which is common to all men to improve their condition \(1985: 50\). 

Thus, while Franchetti's image of the South resembles Villari's in its negativity, the contrast between the South and the "more advanced provinces" \(1985: 33\) of Italy is more marked in Franchetti's text. 

Before concluding this brief consideration of Franchetti's first study, it is also worth noting that the contrastive effect we have been discussing was further accentuated by its publication together with Sonnino's study of share-cropping in Tuscany. Sonnino's *Mezzeria in Toscana* amounted to an encomium of the Tuscan share-cropping system, which, in his view, was one of the most humane, successful forms of agriculture that could be imagined. The contrast between the disastrous conditions in the South and the "privileged position" of Tuscany was striking, and Sonnino himself seized upon this point in a sort of preview of their findings published shortly before the appearance of their joint volume in the spring of 1875.16 Nor was this effect apparently lost on one young southern reader, Giustino Fortunato. Many years later, Fortunato recalled the profound impact these texts had upon him precisely in terms of this contrast, noting that they were "two texts published in a single volume, with the manifest intention of bringing together descriptions of two states of affairs as different from one another as the effects of the same contract in the particular conditions of the two regions are varied" \(1927: 163-4\). 

I now turn to Franchetti and Sonnino's *Sicilia nel 1876*, focusing on the contribution of the former, *Condizioni politiche e amministrative della Sicilia*. Franchetti's earlier study and the study of Sicily are akin to one another in a number of ways, but, as we shall see below, the study of Sicily is composed with considerably more clarity of focus and rhetorical force. Most importantly, it takes the contrastive vision of the earlier study to much greater extremes, constituting, in fact, one of the most powerful conceptualizations of the difference and division between North and South ever written. 

Like the preface to Franchetti's earlier study, the joint preface to *La Sicilia nel 1876* announces the authors' commitment to telling the whole, unvarnished truth about Sicily. Franchetti reaffirms this point at the beginning of his own contribution with an epigraph from Machiavelli's *Prince*, which states: "There is no other way to ward off adulation than to let people know that they won't offend you if they tell you the truth."17 The reference to the *Prince* is not a matter of indifference: Franchetti's study is itself a treatise of statecraft, an analysis of the social and political conditions in Sicily and a diagnosis of how to remedy its ills aimed, as he writes later, at the "educated class of central and northern Italy and those few-people from southern Italy who are aware of the conditions of their country" \(Franchetti and Sonnino 1974: 238\). The polemical edge of their investigation is apparent here as well, for they suggest that the country's élites have ignored if not suppressed the harsh truth about Sicily in the past, subscribing to "that stupid sense of shame which often makes us Italians hide our ills so as to seem greater than or different from what we are" \(p. vi\).18 

The polemical spirit of the exposé therefore animates *La Sicilia nel 1876*, and, as we shall see below, surprise and shock are key elements of the text's rhetorical construction. At the same time, Franchetti articulates his study in another narrative mode that occupies a central place in the history of representations of the South: that of the travel journal. *La Sicilia nel 1876* is, after all, based on the journey Franchetti, Sonnino, and their friend Enea Cavalieri took to Sicily, and for Franchetti the travel narrative is evidently one of the most rhetorically effective ways to represent the experience of discovery that plays such an important role in his study.19 This experience is generally framed in terms of sociological analysis, but, as the following passages show, this is not the purely dispassionate account of the positivist social investigator. A more imaginative and, in some sense, romantic perspective also comes into play, a certain enchantment with the new and foreign; 


The train sets off again, and the traveler is subtly overcome by the feeling experienced by one who finds himself in the middle of mysterious and unknown things; it seems that the valleys that open on the road, winding and then hiding themselves behind a rise, must hide strange things, never seen before \(p. 20\). 

Then the newly arrived traveler feels overcome by a sense of profound isolation. It seems to him that the nightmare of some mysterious and malicious power weighs on the bare and monotonous countryside, a power against which there is no help or defense beyond himself and the companions that have come with him from across the sea, and he suddenly feels overcome by a profound sense of affection for the carbine that he's carrying across his saddle \(pp. 21—2\). 


Later in the text, the narrative device of the journey will be replaced by the more disembodied, scientific perspective of the social investigator.20 But the general sense of being an outside observer from the mainland permeates the study and, as we shall see below, shapes Franchetti's representation of the Sicilian social reality. This is particularly evident in the opening pages of the study. 

Franchetti begins by recounting the traveler's "first impression" upon arrival in Palermo. This, he writes, "is one of the most pleasant that can be imagined" \(p. 3\). He lists the delightful climate and surroundings "celebrated in every language," the splendor of the city and the hospitality of its citizens, the neighboring countryside that manifests signs of an "advanced civilization," all producing in the traveler a state of "enchantment." But - so begins the second paragraph - if the traveler stays a while, "the colors change, the aspect of everything is transformed" \(p. 4\). After hearing a few stories about violent crimes, "all that scent of orange and lemon flowers starts to smell like a corpse" \(p. 4\). The sunny commonplaces and first impressions of the island quickly yield to the grim facts of life in Sicily.21 

For the next two hundred pages the reader is presented with an unremittingly dire portrait of the social and political conditions on the island. The island's ruling class is composed of that people in Europe that is "most passionately ambitious for domination, the quickest to take offense, the most ruthless in its struggles for power, influence and profit, the most implacable in its hates, most ferocious in vendettas" \(p. 8\); the oppressed peasants live in destitute conditions that call to mind "the times in which the Sicilian countryside was tilled by hordes of slaves" \(p. 21\); bands of brigands, bandits, and *mafiosi* maraude across the island, virtually unchecked by the forces of law and order, who, in turn, are like "an army encamped in a hostile country" \(p. 13\). A "nightmare of mysterious and malign power" seems indeed to weigh upon everything, bathing in a sinister light not just the Sicilian landscape, but its human reality as well. 

As Renda notes, a spirit of desolation pervades all Franchetti's observations and analyses in *Condizioni politiche e amministrative della Sicilia* \(see 1984: 73\), as the following statement suggests: "The sight of the conditions on the entire island, irrespective of the particular province, is profoundly disturbing" \(p. 56\). And while Franchetti by no means renounces claims to objectivity, neither does he attempt to suppress the subjective dimension of his encounter with Sicily. On the contrary, the representation of his experience of alienation from it constitutes one of the main ways of representing the difference between the civilization of Sicily and the mainland more generally. This is an important point that we shall return to below. For the moment, let us briefly examine what Franchetti considers to be the two characteristics that typify life on the island: the omnipresence of violence; and the predominance of private interests over the public good. 

Violence, as we saw, was what first caught the attention of Franchetti's traveler at the beginning of the study; and it accompanies him throughout. As much as the sheer frequency of murders, kidnapping, cattle rustling, etc., what strikes Franchetti most is the Sicilians' attitudes towards it. Acts of violence, for them, are not exceptional, but rather part of "the normal state of things" \(p. 5\), "necessary and normal although harmful, like the heavy rains that make the year's harvest rot in their fields" \(p. 221\). 

Such violence reveals, in turn, the governing principle of life on the island: the predominance of private authority over social, or public, authority. It is this single phenomenon, Franchetti writes in the penultimate section, that "sums up" all the others described and analysed in the book \(p. 220\). From it follows the fact that in Sicily "violence can be freely employed by whoever has the means to do so, the *res publica* is exploited by the few, the rights recognized by Italian civil law are ineffectual against private force" \(p. 220\). It is a world, in short, in which might makes right, where "there is no place for whoever doesn't have fangs and claws" \(p. 12\). 

These are the quintessential characteristics of the Sicilian social order according to Franchetti. What we now need to consider is how Franchetti represents these aspects of life in Sicily, and Sicily more generally, as different from what one finds on the mainland. This is a crucial point, for it is precisely the representation of Sicily's difference that constitutes one of the text's most powerful and lasting rhetorical effects. 

Through a variety of rhetorical devices Franchetti makes it clear that the way of life in Sicily differs from that of the mainland author and his implied readership. I should mention at this point that Franchetti establishes a form of identity between himself and his reader as co-"continentals" from the beginning by creating two basic perspectives in the text: that of the traveler-observer and that of the Sicilians. The first perspective is generally articulated as an indefinite third-person \("one"\) that embraces both author and reader as the subject that observes, analyses, and experiences the Sicilian world; the Sicilians are quite simply the "other," the objects of observation and analysis." We will see more clearly below the way Franchetti actually deprives the Sicilians of their political agency; but for the moment let us consider how they are rendered socially and culturally "other" in the text. 

Franchetti's study is strewn with various indications of curiosity, surprise, perplexity, confusion, fear, all of which serve to underscore the cultural distance between the traveler and the Sicilians under observation. Such indications range from the use of qualifiers like "strange," "disturbing," and even "monstrous," to more extended representations of the experience of cultural difference. In the first pages of the study, for example, Franchetti stages the discrepancy between the traveler's expectations about violence and the way things work in Sicily. One would expect people to be arrested for these crimes, but they are not \(pp. 4-5\); one would expect people to feel angry about these incidents, but they are not \(p. 7\); one would infer from their frequency that Sicily was undergoing some revolution or other terrible cataclysm, but it is not \(p. 11\). In each case the difference between the foreign culture of Sicily and that of the mainland is underscored through the discrepancy between continental expectation and Sicilian reality. 

The frequent use of questions and other indications of perplexity has a similar effect. Certain pages in fact amount to little more than catalogues of questions that express the traveler's inability to orient himself in this strange world, asking, in effect, how could this be possible? "How could these criminals acquire such a sway over men's minds? The mind searches at length in vain to solve this problem,. . What is the reason for the landowners' lack of organization ...?... the mind seeks in vain a criterion that can guide it in the judgment of the facts" \(p. 31\). Sicily thus constitutes a cognitive challenge, a socio-political reality that, in fact, "throws into disarray all the concepts of government and the public good that one has formed in regularly constituted countries" \(p. 35\). 

All these qualifiers, questions, and observations are so many ways of driving home what, at some level, is the fundamental point of Franchetti's study: that Sicily is different, radically different, from the mainland. And while the traveler's conceptual framework may be momentarily "thrown into disarray" by certain aspects of Sicily, it comes out of this cultural encounter quite intact of course, every bit the unwavering standard against which Sicily and the rest of the world can be judged. Sicily is therefore not just different but, as the last comment cited above makes perfectly clear, *irregular*. 

What is striking about this insistent, normative assertion of cultural difference is that Franchetti and Sonnino had claimed in the preface that the phenomena under investigation "have their first origin in the laws of nature," and that they consequently had no intention "judging or condemning anyone" \(p. v\). By the same token, Franchetti stresses in the conclusion that the phenomena he describes "have nothing abnormal about them, but are rather the necessary manifestations of the social state of the island" \(p. 237\). He even grants, with an air of tolerance, that this is "one state of affairs like another," which existed in Europe for many centuries and continues to exist in many countries still today. Sicily is, in a word, medieval, behind on the time-line of historical progress with respect to the "more advanced parts" of the country, and, if left to its own devices, would probably follow in the footsteps of the rest of modern Europe \(p. 220\).23 

The key problem, however, is that Sicily does not exist in isolation, but rather forms part of the *modern* kingdom of Italy. Its "abnormality" derives from its position in this context. What is abnormal in Sicily is thus "the intrusion of a different civilization that seeks to impose itself and throws the play of natural forces into disarray, which otherwise would have resulted in the regular development of Sicilian society" \(p. 237\). Franchetti thus makes clear a point that had been implicit throughout the study: that Sicily and the mainland, North and South, are homogeneous entities, such that Sicily's union with the mainland perforce constitutes an "intrusion," the rupturing of the hermetic seal that had previously protected "medieval" Sicily from modern civilization. Set against one another in this fashion, however, there can be no compromise or fusion between them. 

The coexistence of Sicilian civilization and that of central and northern Italy in the same nation is incompatibile with the prosperity of the nation and, in the long run, with its very existence, for it produces a weakness that renders it vulnerable to disintegration at the slightest push from outside. One of these two civilizations must therefore disappear in those parts of it which are incompatible with the other. And we believe that for any Sicilian of good faith and moderate intelligence there can be no doubt as to which of the two must make room for the other \(p. 237\). 

Now, as one would expect, such a unilaterally negative conceptualization of Sicily has certain ramifications with regard to the prospect of governing it; and it is not surprising that, in order to formulate the specific political relationship between Sicily and the mainland, Franchetti draws upon the repertoire of medical imagery that was frequently employed to represent the South, particularly in moments of heightened social unrest and political conflict.24 In their joint preface, Franchetti and Sonnino had in fact referred to the "diseased phenomena" that Sicily manifests; and over the course of the study the conceptualization of the relationship between northern observer and Sicily as that of doctor and sick patient is implicit throughout In the last two sections of the study, Franchetti elaborates upon the medical metaphor extensively. 

As we saw above, Sicily constitutes an abnormal part of the Italian nation. In the penultimate section, titled - like Villari's last *Letter* - "The Remedies," Franchetti makes it clear that Sicily "must be considered a morbid phenomenon, a form of disorder such that Italy has the duty to suppress it as quickly as possible" \(p. 221\). Who shall spearhead this radical transformation of Sicilian society? Obviously not the Sicilians, for whom such a state of affairs is normal. They cannot participate in this effort, "for it is precisely their way of feeling and seeing that constitutes the illness to be cured" \(p. 221\). Franchetti acknowledges that it is important to ask the Sicilians their opinions on the matter — 

but these views, these opinions, should be taken as phenomena, as symptoms of capital importance for the person who aims to discover the nature and process of the illness, not as directive norms for its cure. For a doctor, the patient's complaints of thirst are often a reason not to give him something to drink. Often the sensations about which the patient complains most bitterly are for the doctor a sign that his remedies are working and, vice versa, an apparent improvement a sign that the disease is worsening, and death approaching \(p. 221\). 

Consequently, if the Italian state "wishes to cure the ills of Sicily, it must avail itself of the elements that the Nation provides, to the exclusion of the Sicilians themselves" \(pp. 222—3\).25 

The North, then, is invested with all the authority commonly associated with a doctor, while Sicily is reduced to the figure of sick patient, wholly ignorant of its own conditions and consequently unable to make decisions on its own behalf.26 Sicily is quarantined off from the community of Italians, denied all political agency. The problem, however, as Franchetti notes in the concluding section of his study, is that the ruling élites of central-northern Italy have been remiss in their medical duties. This part of the nation has lacked 

the sense of its duties and its mission towards Sicily and the southern provinces in general. We have received those little sisters of ours who, without a thought for the future, trustingly threw themselves into our arms. They were emaciated, starving, covered with sores, and we should have cared for them lovingly, nourished them, sought by every means, even with fire where necessary, to give them back their health. Instead, without even taking a look at their wounds, we put them to work, the hard, tiring labor of making Italy. We asked for men and money from them, and we gave them a two-bit freedom in return, imported from abroad, and we said to them: grow and multiply. And then after fifteen years we're surprised to see that the wounds have become gangrenous and threaten to infect Italy \(p. 238\). 

This passage introduces a number of important new elements. In the first place, Franchetti clarifies an issue that had remained in the shadows throughout the study: the relationship between Sicily and continental southern Italy. Franchetti had restricted his focus to Sicily over the course of his analysis, or, to be more precise, had restricted his comparisons to those between Sicily and central-northern Italy, effectively blotting out the continental South. If one were to draw up a map of Italy based on Franchetti's observations, it would consist of an Italian peninsula truncated somewhere below Tuscany, across from which would lie the island of Sicily. Franchetti's study is therefore written as if southern Italy did not exist, and this clearly serves to reinforce the image of Sicily's insularity and isolation from mainland civilization. Here, without any further explanation, continental Southern Italy comes to form part of that same downtrodden world. 

A second important feature of this passage is Franchetti's addition of a gendered, human element to his representation of Sicily and the South, which infuses the medical imagery of doctor-patient with a sense of familial pathos and big-brotherly protectiveness. At the same time, in the last line of the passage the North loses its doctorly detachment and immunity, becoming instead a part of the same diseased organism. And it is with precisely this view of the problem that Franchetti makes his final appeal in the closing lines of the text. 

Certainly, Italy will be able to survive a long time in the same conditions in which it has lived for the past fifteen years. There are many organic diseases that do not lead to an immediate death. But in a weakened organism, full of germs of decomposition, those same causes that in a healthy body would produce barely noticeable effects, generate a total breakdown. And if this should happen, the first to suffer cruelly would be the members of that class that is unable to understand the responsibility and duties towards the rest of the nation that are imposed upon it by the fact that it alone profits from the liberty of Italy \(pp. 237—9\). 

Sicily is then an anomaly, a holdover from the Middle Ages that threatens the modernity of the mainland with its violence, clientelism, and disregard for the law. It is in short a negation of the bourgeois civilization of the mainland \(cf. Mazzamuto 1975: 44—5\). Sicily and the mainland are therefore, as I noted earlier, not only different from one another but utterly distinct and, in a sense, antagonistically opposed to one another. What this means is that Franchetti not only represents "Sicily in 1876" but, if you will, "the North in 1876" as well; these two geopolitical blocks are defined in antithetical relation to one another. The North, in other words, becomes, through this contrastive process, more modern, more European, more governed by law and order, than ever before. This is not to say that Franchetti ignores the fact that conditions in many areas of the North can be improved upon. He himself notes that "the social conditions of northern and central Italy leave much to be desired in every respect" \(p. 237\). But under the pressure of unification, Italy paradoxically splits in two. In Franchetti's text, the imaginary geography of Italy is subjected to a process of polarization of unprecedented force. Only Giustino Fortunato's stark vision of two Italies, distinguished from one another by fundamentally different natural, geographical conditions, would rival and in some sense surpass Franchetti's in argumentative and rhetorical persuasiveness.27 But Fortunato would not elaborate this dualistic vision in writing until the end of the century. During the 1870s, which is to say at the beginnings of the Meridionalist problematic, it was Franchetti's study that constituted the most rigorous and rhetorically charged elaboration of two distinct Italies, that shaped the conceptual framework within which the country's élites viewed Sicily and the South more generally from that point forward. 




### Notes

1. I investigate this broader context in my forthcoming book, *Imagining the South: Italy between Europe and Africa*, from which parts of the present essay are drawn. 

2. Villari 1885: 173. Henceforth in this section I will refer to the revised 1885 edition of *Le lettere meridionali* only by the page number. *Le lettere meridionali* were first published in book form in 1878 by Le Monnier of Florence. Unless otherwise noted, all translations in this essay are mine.

4. Turiello 1980: 23n1. Five years later, Turiello wrote at the beginning of *Governo e governati:*. "For me, as for others, it was Villari's *Lettere napoletane* \[*sic*\] — the most widely read book of all \[on the South\] and the most effective for the authority of its author — that inspired me to pursue these studies" \(p. 23\). Forty years later, Giustino Fortunato spoke in turn of "the happy year in which Villari's *Lettere meridionali* suddenly called the public's attention to what was and still is our greatest domestic problem" \(Fortunato 1927: 164\). 

5. On Dina's career in Italian politics and journalism, see Ghiaia 1896-1903, as well as the entry for Dina in the *Dizionario biografico* 1991. 

6. Ippolito Nievo, for example, had incisively addressed this problem in his "Frammento sulla rivoluzione nazionale," written in 1859 but not published until 1929 \(Nievo 1952\). Closer to the historical moment and cultural milieu in which Villari was writing, fellow Neapolitan Angelo Camillo De Meis also took up the question in his *Il Sovrano* of 1868 \(De Meis 1927\). On the problematic of élites and people more generally in the Risorgimento, see Asor Rosa 1979: 13-48 and, with specific reference to *Il Sovrano*, 1975: 873—8; Columrni Camerino 1975: 5-80; and Gramsci 1971: 44—120, where the issue is central to his interpretation of the Risorgimento. 

7. In 1885: 67. This need for Italy to "look inside its own breast" was also the note on which De Sanctis had concluded his *Storia della letteratura italiana* five years earlier \(De Sanctis 1991: 846\). 

8. Echoing the imagery of the "too narrow sphere," Villari also describes the experience in terms of asphyxiation: "It's as if we lack the air to breathe" \(p. 69\). 

9. In 1885: 68—9. For a discussion of the more general disillusionment — or *deprecatici temporum* — expressed by many of the country's élites at this time, see Asor Rosa's important observations in 1975: 821—39. 

10. Villari's *Letters* are in fact largely composed of various letters and reports that Villari received from correspondents in Naples and Sicily \(among them his sister, Virginia \[see Jeuland-Meynaud 1973: 185\]\); and it is striking with respect to the positivist rhetoric of eyewitness observation that informs the *Letters* — Villari speaks of the necessity of "seeing it with your own eyes" — that the most compelling accounts on the whole are those provided by others. 

11. In 1885: 65. Shortly after composing this letter on the *camorra*, Villari wrote to his sister: "If you only knew how indifferent the House is to all social questions — the Left as much or more than the Right — you would understand how terribly difficult it is to speak about such things. No one wants to hear a word of it" \(quoted in Cicalese 1979: 133\). 

12. An 1878 review of Jessie White Mario's *La miseria in Napoli* published in *Nuova antologia* begins: "The impression produced throughout Italy in 1875 by Villari's description of the caves of the so-called cord-makers in his *Lettere meridionali* has not yet faded" \(Baer 1878: 330\). 

13. In 1885: 8-9. Bulferetti also notes this aspect of the *Southern Letters*, observing that it is not their conceptual content but rather their powerful "veristic descriptions" that grab the reader \(Bulferetti 1951: 91—2\), 

14. Contarino notes with respect to the new literature on the "Neapolitan Question" initiated by Villari, and then Jessie White Mario and Renato Fucini, that despite the ideological differences existing among them, "it is striking that what is prevalent in all of them is the idea of Naples's uniqueness as a case of urban underdevelopment" \(1989: 669\). 

15. Jannazzo, in his introduction to *Condizioni economiche*, highlights Franchetti's profoundly European cultural vision \(Franchetti 1985: vii—xv\). 

16. The article, titled "Delle condizioni dei contadini in Italia," was published in the Fiorentine journal, *La Nazione*, on 12 April 1875, and can now be found in Sonnino 1972: 155—61. 

17. Franchetti and Sonnino 1974: vi. Unless otherwise indicated, page references in this section refer to the first volume of this text. As noted above, the original title of the work was *La Sicilia nel 1876*. 

18. It is also important to remember that Franchetti and Sonnino conceived of their study, at least in its final stages, as a counter-investigation to the parliamentary inquiry into the conditions in Sicily that was being conducted at around the same time as theirs. As they note at the end of the preface, the commission's final report was released shortly before the publication of their study and, while they express agreement with certain "partial" assessments made by the commission, they dissent from its "general judgments." In a letter to Enea Cavalieri written some time after the book's publication, Franchetti recalls how the authors rushed to publish their studies in time for the parliamentary discussion of the commission's report. For a comparative discussion of the two inquiries, see Renda 1984: 68-88. 

19. Mazzamuto recalls the extensive tradition of travel writing on Sicily of which Franchetti was at least partially aware, and makes an argument for a number of links between *Condizioni politiche e amministrative della Sicilia* and Paolo Balsamo's *Il Giornale del viaggio fatto in Sicilia e particolarmente nella contea di Modica* \(1808\) \(1975: 42-4\). 

20. Dickie provides an astute analysis of the relationship between these two perspectives in his chapter on Villari and Franchetti \(1993\). 

21. Franchetti's demystification of the commonplaces of sunny Sicily can be usefully considered alongside that contemporary counter-discourse produced by Mastriani, Serao, Di Giacomo, *et al*. aimed at undoing what Serao termed the *rettorichetta* of picturesque Naples \(see Giammattei 1987: 388—90\). 

22. Franchetti and Sonnino's various Sicilian hosts are one exception, to whom Franchetti expresses his gratitude in a section titled "Hospitality" \(p. 22\). 

23. The "medievalism" of the South was a familiar trope in post-unification Italian culture. Speaking of Basilicata in a parliamentary discussion of brigandage in 1863, deputy Stefano Castagnola exclaimed: "It's the Middle Ages right under our eyes\!" \(cited in Villari 1885: 40\). 

24. See Moe 1992 for a discussion of the use of such medical imagery during the early 1860s. 

25. It is important to note that Sonnino, at the conclusion of his study, adopts a much more inclusive view of the role Sicilians should play in the transformation of conditions on the island, nor is the influence of the North viewed in such a univocally positive light: "Left to its own devices, Sicily would find a solution: numerous facts demonstrate this, and it is rendered certain by the intelligence and energy of its population, as well as the immense richness of its resources. A social transformation would necessarily occur, either through the prudent collaboration of its affluent class, or through the effects of some violent revolution. But we Italians of other provinces prevent this from happening. We have legalized the existing oppression; and we guarantee the impunity of the oppressors" \(Franchetti and Sonnino 1974,2: 263\). Speaking of the corruption of the affluent classes he similarly stresses, "I'm talking about three-quarters of Italy, not just Sicily" \(p. 265\). 

26. It was above all this analogy that outraged the first Sicilian readers of *La Sicilia nel 1876* and that Luigi Capuana later termed the "original sin" of their study — that of traveling to Sicily "like doctors to the bed of a sick patient, with the preconception that the sickness of that poor devil was something unusual, complicated, rebellious to the analyses and cures of science" \(see Capuana 1892: 18—19; De Mattai 1963: 118-19; Brancate 1975: 10-11\). 

27. See above all his famous 1904 essay, "La questione meridionale e la riforma tributaria" \(Fortunato 1973: 539-41\).
