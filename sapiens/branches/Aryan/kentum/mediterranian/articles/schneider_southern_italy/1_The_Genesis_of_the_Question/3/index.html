*Silvana Patriarca *
In the introduction to a collection of essays significantly titled Mezzogiorno senza meridionalismo, Giuseppe Giarrizzo has recently recalled the circumstances in which a meridionalista discourse first emerged. The first articulation of the “Southern Question” was the work of some representatives of the Historic Right who were reacting to the defeat of their party in the southern regions in the elections of 1874, a defeat that paved the way for the Historic Left to attain power in 1876. Far from being a realization of the socio-economic “backwardness” of the South, the descriptions and denunciations of the conditions of the South produced by conservative reformers such as Pasquale Villari, Leopoldo Franchetti, and Sidney Sonnino in the mid-1870s would essentially represent a political indictment of the southern élites (too corrupt, in their views, to be able to ensure a good government of the country). According to Giarrizzo, there was indeed no perception of a fundamental economic and social dualism of North and South in the 1860s and early 1870s; this perception appeared only later, and was then read back into this earlier period (Giarrizzo 1992: xv). The Southern Question in its beginning would thus be a largely political construct. In this discourse the South was a symbol, a signifier whose referent is to be found essentially in the politics of its makers.">

  <p>How Many Italies? Representing the South in Official Statistics</p>
<p>*Silvana Patriarca *</p>
<p>In the introduction to a collection of essays significantly titled <em>Mezzogiorno senza meridionalismo</em>, Giuseppe Giarrizzo has recently recalled the circumstances in which a <em>meridionalista</em> discourse first emerged. The first articulation of the &ldquo;Southern Question&rdquo; was the work of some representatives of the Historic Right who were reacting to the defeat of their party in the southern regions in the elections of 1874, a defeat that paved the way for the Historic Left to attain power in 1876. Far from being a realization of the socio-economic &ldquo;backwardness&rdquo; of the South, the descriptions and denunciations of the conditions of the South produced by conservative reformers such as Pasquale Villari, Leopoldo Franchetti, and Sidney Sonnino in the mid-1870s would essentially represent a political indictment of the southern élites (too corrupt, in their views, to be able to ensure a good government of the country). According to Giarrizzo, there was indeed no perception of a fundamental economic and social dualism of North and South in the 1860s and early 1870s; this perception appeared only later, and was then read back into this earlier period (Giarrizzo 1992: xv). The Southern Question in its beginning would thus be a largely political construct. In this discourse the South was a symbol, a signifier whose referent is to be found essentially in the politics of its makers.</p>
<p>Partly out of a polemical stance against the straitjacket that <em>meridionalismo</em> has often represented for the South itself, Giarrizzo provides an essentially political reading of the emergence of the Southern Question in the mid-1870s,1 an emergence that other scholars have linked to a wider set of intellectual and political developments that shaped Italian society in the early 1870s. Among the conditions that made possible the articulation of the Southern Question at that time we must recall not only the realization of the weakness of the new nation and the mood of disappointment over the poor performance of Italy in the international arena, but especially the new sensitivity of sectors of the Italian élites to the &ldquo;social question&rdquo; after the great fear generated by the episode of the Paris Commune (Salvadori 1960: 41; Villari 1961; Arfé 1962). This sensitivity in turn was spurred by the diffusion of a genuine interest and at times enthusiasm for positivism and empirical social investigation on the part of intellectuals and segments of the political élites (AsorRosa 1975: 913—14; Moe 1994).</p>
<p>Yet Giarrizzo&rsquo;s reading deserves attention because it points to an issue — that of the genesis of the idea of a North-South dualism and of the specific and changing content of this dualism - that it is important to explore more deeply in order to understand the meaning of the Southern Question fully in its discursive dimension Thanks in particular to some recent studies, it is well known how the South was often represented in the early 1860s, when it appeared as the Other of the Italian nation, as &ldquo;Africa,&rdquo; a less &ldquo;civilized&rdquo; if not wholly primitive land whose inhabitants needed to be brought to order and ruled by a more &ldquo;civilized&rdquo; North (Dickie 1992; Moe 1992; Petraccone 1994). Old stereotypes informed the letters and accounts that functionaries, military men, and other individuals involved in the business of government in the South (mostly northerners, but also southerners) sent to their correspondents. This representation coexisted with the idea held throughout the 1860s that the South was a naturally rich land that only corrupt political institutions had ruined — a belief fostered by a scant knowledge about the South and by the forward-looking attitudes of the mostly northern élites (Salvadori 1960: 28 ff.; Villari 1961: 69—70; Ragionieri 1967: 81 ff.). But were political passions, stereotypes, and myths all there was in the image of the South that circulated in the first years of existence of the new state?</p>
<p>Needless to say, this is a rhetorical question, which would appear to demand a reference to the reality behind the representation. In what follows, however, I will not invoke this reality, but will focus my attention on what today&rsquo;s social scientists would call &ldquo;hard data,&rdquo; i.e. quantitative information, and treat them as a representation. Following what was already common practice elsewhere, the new Italian state immediately after its establishment began to assemble a &ldquo;positive&rdquo; and &ldquo;scientific&rdquo; knowledge of the new country and of its various components through the collection and publication of statistics.2 Thus from the 1860s on, the national élites came to know the South not only through the accounts of military men and politicians, but also through that state knowledge <em>par excellence</em>, namely statistics. Statistics was then considered a &ldquo;governmental science&rdquo; and a method that produced what was believed to be an objective and scientific evaluation of the level of &ldquo;civilization&rdquo; of a country. It constituted an actual institution of the new state, recognized as such by its makers, and it even functioned, as Raffaele Romanelli has observed, as the &ldquo;official ideology of the state and its apparatus&rdquo; (Romanelli 1980: 769). But statistics in the plural - in the sense of the actual numbers — were also the most authoritative mode of knowing and representing the social world in an era in which an important segment of the national élites hailed positivism as their new faith. Members of parliament frequently referred to official statistics in their debates and arguments; teachers in secondary schools and university professors used these numbers in their manuals and courses; publicists popularized them in journals and writings that had the function of &ldquo;making the country known to itself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is the image of the South constructed through the authoritative practice of statistics that we must examine in order to understand more fully whether and to what extent the South appeared as a distinct socio-economic reality, if not an altogether distinct &ldquo;civilization,&rdquo; in the 1860s and early 1870s, a reality that stood out in contrast to the rest of the country. Was there a South in Italian official statistics before the articulation of the Southern Question? What did the state statisticians read into their numbers? In what way have statistics contributed to the &ldquo;dualization&rdquo; of Italy, to the definition of the image of the &ldquo;two Italies&rdquo; that since its appearance has maintained a central place not only in Italian political and scholarly debates but also in the collective self-representation of the country? These are the questions that I shall try to approach in this essay by looking primarily at official publications and focusing in particular on the period 1861—1875. I shall also examine how some social observers external to the state apparatus used these numbers in the later part of the century to articulate the paradigm of the &ldquo;two Italies,&rdquo; and finally I shall conclude by looking at some more recent, and somehow paradoxical, developments in the representation of the country constructed and diffused through the means of official statistics.</p>

<p>The most important statistics of the first decade of existence of the new state were undoubtedly those on population. Demographic data occupied a fundamental role in the symptomatology of the national &ldquo;body.&rdquo; The census formed the &ldquo;basis of any statistical and economic inquiry,&rdquo; and the study of population movements was supposed to reveal the &ldquo;laws according to which the nation preserves or renovates itself,&rdquo; as we read in the introduction to the first volume of the series (MAIC 1864a: viii). Together these investigations constituted the review of the &ldquo;vital forces&rdquo; of the nation. Moreover, as state statisticians faced severe difficulties in collecting quantitative data on the economy, demographic data served as the principal indicator of the condition of the country.4 The other kinds of quantitative data that the Milanese Pietro Maestri, the head of the Divisione (later called Direzione) di statistica generale from 1862 to 1871, and his collaborators were able to collect and publish concerned mostly the working of state and local institutions (for example the finances of communes and provinces) and of all those institutions and practices that characterized a modern state, such as elections, schools, savings banks, mutual aid societies, and so on. The new state made a conscious effort to spread the knowledge gathered by the statistical service. About a thousand copies of each publication were distributed free (ISTAT 1936: 38). &ldquo;Popular&rdquo; editions of these works were also published, such as the one on the census results containing Maestri&rsquo;s own introductions to the data (MAIC 1867a), and the <em>Annuario statistico italiano</em> (1864) edited by Maestri and by another Milanese, Cesare Correnti, then member of the Giunta centrale di statistica (the central advisory committee on statistics) as well as a center-left member of parliament.</p>
<p>Needless to say, these men were not statisticians in the modern sense of the word. Maestri held a degree in medicine from the University of Pavia; Correnti had received a degree in law from the same university. Both had been illustrious participants in the struggle for national independence, to which they had also contributed on the cultural front with works of empirico-statistical investigation. The democratic and federalist leanings of Maestri were well known — although after 1861 he chose to be involved almost exclusively with his work at the Direzione. Correnti was a politically more moderate figure, who held several government positions in the governments of the Historic Right before contributing to the rise to power of the Historic Left. Both believed in the fundamental role of statistical knowledge for the building of liberal institutions; both had been and still were in favor of a less centralized state.5</p>
<p>The official publications containing the statistics collected by the Direzione were always introduced by detailed analyses entitled &ldquo;general considerations&rdquo; (probably written by Maestri, though unsigned) aiming to define the patterns, extract the meanings, and provide an explanation of the numerical results. Most importantly, they constructed and proposed a specific reading of the national territory. In what follows I will examine in detail the statisticians&rsquo; own analyses of the data collected to see what the numbers revealed to them — or, better, to see how they made the numbers &ldquo;speak.&rdquo; As Pasquale Villani has observed, in contrast with the more technical and &ldquo;neutral&rdquo; tone that characterized the comments to the data in later years, these analyses were candid about the beliefs and convictions of their authors (Villani 1978: 885—6). They allow us to see clearly their expectations and biases, the schemes that ordered their approach to the figures, but also to have a sense of what they discovered outside of these schemes, of the kind of negotiation taking place between official interpreters and the mass of data, which were supposed to provide, as Maestri observed, &ldquo;a description of the people made by the people themselves&rdquo; (MAIC 1865: xxii).</p>
<p>The three volumes on the census of 1861, published in 1864—6, provided an overall picture of the population. Volume 1 classified the population on the basis of its territorial distribution by communes, districts, provinces, and <em>compartimenti</em> (compartments) (MAIC 1864b). Volume 2 presented its age distribution, sex structure, domestic status, and literacy, and gave information on the electorate (MAIC 1865). Volume 3 showed the distribution of the population by occupation, language, origins, and religion (MAIC 1866a). In the tables accompanying the comments, probably written by Maestri, figures were aggregated and compared by compartments, by provinces, and by urban and rural communes (defined as having more or less than 6,000 inhabitants). The deployment of these various units of observation and reporting was very uneven. It was the grid of the compartments, always arranged &ldquo;geographically&rdquo; from the northern to the southern ones, that dominated the analysis of the data as a whole. Data aggregated by provinces episodically accompanied the aggregation by compartments and were always listed in alphabetical order. The reporting of data by urban and rural communes was more frequent than that by provinces, but less common than that by compartments.</p>
<p>Elsewhere I have discussed in detail the genesis of the compartments, the predecessors of today&rsquo;s &ldquo;regions&rdquo; (Patriarca 1996). Maestri introduced them in 1864 (they were not actual administrative units like the provinces). While in the census volumes the compartments were closely modeled after the old states (with the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies significantly divided into &ldquo;Provincie Napoletane&rdquo; and Sicily), the new compartments introduced in 1864 exhibited more variations (for example the &ldquo;Provincie Napoletane&rdquo; were replaced by five smaller subdivisions). As a supporter of Cattaneo&rsquo;s federalistic views and thus of forms of regional devolution. Maestri maintained that his compartments would provide a more &ldquo;homogeneous and proportionate partition of population and territory&rdquo; than the existing uneven partition by provinces, since they reproduced the &ldquo;territorial divisions based on the nature of the soil and on the laws of economic convenience&rdquo; (MAIC 1864c: vi). Not only did they make more sense from an administrative and political standpoint; they would also provide a better tool for comparison.</p>
<p>&ldquo;North&rdquo; and &ldquo;South&rdquo; did not appear as reporting units in the official statistical publications of the 1860s (in fact they began to appear regularly, as we will see, only in recent times); however, in the comments themselves compartments were sometimes aggregated to form larger units: northern, central and southern Italy, or <em>alta</em> (higher, namely northern) and <em>bassa</em> (lower, namely southern) <em>Italia</em> were the most common. These were fairly conventional partitions of the peninsula used by geographers and statisticians in earlier times. The boundaries of these larger units, however, were quite mobile and opinions about them varied. For example the Tuscan economist and statesman Luigi Serristori in his <em>Saggio statìstico dell&rsquo; Italia</em> (1833) observed that Italy could be divided into two parts, one including the continental part of the Kingdom of Sardinia-Piedmont, Lombardy-Venetia, the Duchies of Parma and Modena and the part of the Papal territory corresponding to the Emilia, and the other including all the rest of the peninsula and the islands. Distinctive geographies, climates, agricultural products, and patterns of popular mores, he claimed, characterized the two areas. In his <em>Corografia fisica, storica e statistica dell&rsquo; Italia e delle sue isole</em> (1845) another Tuscan, the geographer and statistician Attilio Zuccagni Orlandini, divided Italy into four parts (Northern, Central, Southern, and the Islands) claiming that the Italian peninsula let itself easily be divided in such a fashion along &ldquo;natural&rdquo; lines (vol. 1: 123). Now these subdivisions were bound to assume new meanings in the context of a politically unified Italy and in connection with the statisticians&rsquo; desire to find the &ldquo;laws&rdquo; of the new national society, laws that found expression in statistical averages and rates (and for some consisted in them) and could help to identify the causes of social growth and decline. The search for social laws, reflecting the increasing influence in postunification Italy of Adolphe Quetelet&rsquo;s conception of statistics as a &ldquo;numerical social science of laws&rdquo; (Porter 1986: 41) and not just a descriptive enterprise, introduced a naturalistic, if not deterministic, outlook that had been generally absent in previous works.</p>
<p>The introduction to the first volume of the census stressed how the distribution of communes by size and of population densities showed the existence of distinct patterns of settlement in various areas of the country. While Sicily and the &ldquo;Provincie Napoletane&rdquo; had the highest percentages of their populations living in agglomerations with more than 6,000 inhabitants, and Lombardy and Sardinia in agglomerations with fewer than 6,000, in the rest of Italy, and especially in present-day Emilia-Romagna and in central Italy, the majority of the population was scattered in the countryside. These distinctive patterns of settlement bore a relation to distinctive patterns of landownership in the various areas (MAIC 1864b: xxi— xxvi).</p>
<p>The same attention to regional variation was expressed also in the analysis of people&rsquo;s occupations and their various kinds of &ldquo;industry.&rdquo; The preference for, indeed the idealization of small landownership and of sharecropping —an essential component of that paternalistically progressive ideology shared by many Risor-gimento figures (Villani 1978: 891—3) — made Maestri contrast areas with higher percentages of peasant owners, such as Piedmont and Liguria, with the &ldquo;southern provinces,&rdquo; i.e. &ldquo;Naples&rdquo; and Sicily, but also with those areas in the northern regions where laborers had to sell their labor on a daily basis (MAIC 1867a: 84—5). As for manufacturing industry, Maestri distrusted the census results, which showed higher percentages of people so occupied in the &ldquo;Neapolitan and Sicilian provinces&rdquo;, and attributed them to the concentration of the southern population in towns, where they were more easily identified as &ldquo;industrial&rdquo; &ldquo;for whatever little they did in the arts or crafts&rdquo; (&ldquo;per poco che vi esercitassero qualche arte o mestiere&rdquo;) (MAIC 1867a: 90). Clearly other areas of the country were more industrialized: &ldquo;The parts of Italy which are most industrious are exactly those which have the richest agriculture&rdquo; (MAIC 1867a: 90).6</p>
<p>Although there was no South as a unit of reporting, existing ideas about the former Kingdom of Two Sicilies as a whole and about its population directed the gaze of the commentator - favored in particular by that broad unit used in the first census&rsquo;s volumes, the &ldquo;Provincie Napoletane.&rdquo; However, the existence of distinct patterns neatly opposing northern and southern compartments was emphasized only in a couple of places: with respect to the life cycle of individuals, where a distinction was made between &ldquo;sturdy boreal [i.e. northern] generations&rdquo; and &ldquo;precocious southern natures&rdquo; (MAIC 1865: vii) and with respect to the sex ratio, about which it was observed that &ldquo;the smaller number of men, compared to women&rdquo; in southern Italy was &ldquo;a normal condition&rdquo; accentuated by emigration and the &ldquo;scourge of brigandage&rdquo; (MAIC 1864b: xxviii). There were considerable differences also with regards to levels of literacy and the composition of the electorate, but enough variety could be found outside the &ldquo;Provincie Napoletane&rdquo; to make impossible the construction of an image of the nation along a simple North-South opposition.</p>
<p>The analysis of other statistical reports seems to support this evaluation. Let us look at those on the numbers of births, marriages, and deaths, which attracted more anxious scrutiny than the census, since they were supposed to reflect a changing current situation, and not a state of things that had been inherited from the past. In the belief that the positive effects of the new political order should very soon make their appearance, the principal interpretative effort in the volumes on population movements aimed at determining whether, and where, the population increased or decreased. The same units of reporting and comparison used in the volumes on the census, namely urban and rural communes, and, more importantly, the compartments, framed the analysis of the data; the provinces had virtually disappeared, with a couple of exceptions.7</p>
<p>The comparison between city and countryside, urban and rural communes, did not seem to yield the expected results. To the question whether it was an urban or a rural environment that was more conducive to population growth there were no clear answers. The first data on population movements seemed to point to a lesser &ldquo;vitality&rdquo; of the urban populations. However, this was in part an &ldquo;artificial&rdquo; result, an outcome of the higher mortality rate to be found among the poor of the countryside who went to the cities to find relief in hospitals and other institutions (MAIC 1864a: xxv). Both in the countryside and in the cities, high birth rates were accompanied by high levels of mortality, and especially by high infant mortality. Thus Maestri had to admit that &ldquo;in Italy among both the populations of urban communes and those of rural municipalities, mortality reaches a proportion that has few examples elsewhere; to the point that the very increase of inhabitants is to be considered not as the effect of long life, but rather as the result of a larger number of births over deaths &hellip;&rdquo; (MAIC 1864a: xxvi). Italy as a whole, the official commentator regretfully concluded, seemed unable to preserve its &ldquo;vital forces.&rdquo; In the following years, the comparison of the annual natural increase in rural and urban communes showed the former consistently above the latter, a result that was at the same time cause for surprise (as it ran against developments observed in other countries), and for some satisfaction, since the rural communes remained &ldquo;a rich reservoir of forces for themselves and for the larger urban agglomerations &hellip;&rdquo; (MAIC 1866b: lxix). Yet, in the absence of data on emigration from the countryside to the cities, these results did not mean much, and the overall comparison between the vitality of rural and urban communes was abandoned after 1869.</p>
<p>It was, however, the grid of the compartments that was privileged in the assessment and comparison of the overall levels of &ldquo;vitality&rdquo; of the population. As summary results and indicators were all presented by compartments, these clearly offered the organizing frame for making sense of the figures. Maestri chose six demographic indicators (reduced to five in 1865) to determine synthetically the compartments&rsquo; rank on a kind of &ldquo;ladder of vitality&rdquo;: the ratio of births to deaths, the fertility of marriages, population growth (replaced, for no specified reason, in 1863 by <em>male</em> population growth), mean and probable length of life (replaced by &ldquo;longevity&rdquo; in 1865) and &ldquo;premature&rdquo; deaths (of people less than fifteen years old). With a few exceptions, the southern compartments appeared consistently placed in the lowest positions. Initially, the commentator related the differences observed among compartments to the political conditions existing in those areas prior to unification and - in the rare case a positive change occurred in a compartment — to the revitalizing impact of Unification. The well-marked territorial diversity revealed by these figures was considered a relic of the past, a relic that — it was his repeated wish — would disappear through the provisions of the new liberal institutions and the consequent revitalization of the economy.8 The historical explanation, however, grew less adequate in view of the stability of the pattern that emerged through the years; and it was finally abandoned after 1866. No alternative explanation took its place. Indeed the comments on the results of ranking — results that discredited the early optimistic expectations regarding the impact of liberal institutions — became increasingly laconic; and as a result also of flaws in the accuracy of the measurements employed as indicators themselves, ranking was abandoned in 1870.</p>
<p>Besides presenting and analysing demographic data, the volumes on population movements also reported the anthropometric data on conscripts collected by army doctors.9 The statisticians used these data as indicators of the physical appearance and health of the population. Starting in 1863, they drew a picture of the bodily characteristics of the population based on the percentages of rejections of conscripts on account of insufficient height or illness and deformity. The results of these investigations showed that relatively taller people were more numerous in the northern regions and Tuscany, while relatively shorter heights characterized the southern population {MAIC 1864c: xl). Heights followed a &ldquo;<em>topographical law</em>, so to speak, which can be represented through a curve. This curve, reaching its peak in central Italy and precisely in Tuscany, slopes down on both sides in such a way that the slope is slightest northwards and maximum southwards [my emphasis]&rdquo; (ibid.: xli). These results would later be interpreted by positivist anthropology as evidence that two &ldquo;races&rdquo; inhabited the Italian nation. In the 1860s and early 1870s, however, the state statisticians did not speculate on how these results should be explained. Moreover, the data on the rejections of conscripts due to health problems showed a somewhat compensating pattern: people in bad health conditions were more numerous among the taller inhabitants of the northern and central regions (Lombardy surpassed all other areas in this respect), while, with the exception of Sicily, healthier bodies were more numerous among the shorter inhabitants of the southern compartments.</p>
<p>Another kind of data seemed to offer starker evidence of the existence of a cleavage between two distinctive parts of Italy, These were the data on &ldquo;violent deaths,&rdquo; namely deaths by accident, suicides, and homicides, which began to be published in the volume on vital statistics of 1864. This investigation was conceived as a first step towards the creation of a much desired corpus of medical statistics, but also had a direct relevance for measuring levels of &ldquo;civilization&rdquo; within the national community, as it allowed for assessing the &ldquo;different attitudes and moral predispositions of [the Italian] people&rdquo; (MAIC 1866b: Ivi). &ldquo;Some of these deaths,&rdquo; Maestri maintained, were &ldquo;the consequence of little-advanced civilization, while others, unfortunately, must be considered the result of passions and dangers to which modern progress exposes us&rdquo; (ibid.). The statistics on homicides exhibited a clear geographical pattern. The data for 1866 showed the Kingdom divided into two distinct parts; in one of them the homicide rate was almost five times higher than in the other:</p>
<p>With regard to the number of homicides Italy <em>can be divided topographically into two distinct parts</em>, of which the first one includes the Northern and Western provinces (Piedmont, Lombardy, Emilia, Liguria, and Tuscany) and the second one the Eastern and Southern ones (the Marches, Umbria, Neapolitan Provinces, Sicily, and Sardinia). In the former, homicides are relatively less numerous (on average 5.23 per 100,000 people); in the latter, this ratio reaches 23.64 per 100,000.&quot; [my emphasis] (MAIC 1868: xxviii).</p>
<p>But three years later, the boundaries of the area with a higher homicide rate had slightly changed. Marche and Umbria were now included within the area defined by a lower number of homicides (MAIC 1871: xvi). It is important to observe that in reality not all the areas included in the &ldquo;Neapolitan Provinces&rdquo; exhibited the same high rates of victims of homicide. For example Apulia and Basilicata often had lower rates than Umbria, a fact that the construction of a general average for the whole South tended to obscure.</p>
<p>How was this dualistic distribution explained? The difference was immediately traced back to diverse and long-standing local habits determining that in &ldquo;certain Italian regions a given kind of violent, accidental or voluntary death is either very frequent, or altogether absent&rdquo; (MAIC 1866b: Ivi). Yet it was not only a matter of local peculiarities originating in generic local habits. In the commentary on the data for 1867 the two distinct parts had become &ldquo;very distinct.&rdquo; This was a cause of some worry for Maestri, who added emphatically (after quoting from a patriotic poem emphasizing the cultural unity of Italians) that &ldquo;it is three centuries of bad foreign and local dominations, of religious prejudices and baneful civil and economic theories that reflect and explain these strange figures [cotesta stranezza di cifre]&rdquo; (MAIC 1869: xxiv). History again, more than cultural traditions, explained the regional differentials of violent crime rates, in the same way that it also explained the very high percentages of illiteracy in the southern regions.10</p>
<p>We have focused so far on the interpretation of demographic statistics. But the territorial frame also organized the reading of other kinds of statistics: for example those on elections and the electorate, scrutinized in order to measure the greater or smaller &ldquo;political vitality&rdquo; of the various parts of Italy. In the effort to consider the question &ldquo;in general and in large masses,&rdquo; two distinct areas were identified: in the first one, <em>Italia superiore</em> (including Tuscany but excluding Emilia), electors <em>per contribuzioni</em> (those who inet the necessary tax requirement) were dominant, while in the <em>Italia meridionale e media</em> electors <em>per capacità</em> (those who were electors by virtue of their belonging to a particular occupational category — state employees or people exercising a liberal profession) were more numerous, a distinction which the commentator linked to the &ldquo;special economic conditions of the two parts of the Kingdom, namely to the more developed industrial activity and the more diffused and distributed wealth of the <em>settentrione</em> [North] and to the opposite conditions in the <em>mezzodi</em> [South],&rdquo; as well as to other factors such as the level of literacy (MAIC 1867b: xxxiii). In contrast, if one examined the percentage of electors who actually voted, the Veneto and Southern Italy exhibited much higher averages than the Center and the North, thus showing the greater &ldquo;diligence&rdquo; of their electors, but also reflecting the advantages of a more concentrated pattern of residence.</p>
<p>As for the crime statistics made available by the Ministry of Justice, the volumes published in the 1860s and early 1870s did not provide very detailed elaborations and analysis of the data. Some official commentators such as the vice-president of the tribunal of Florence, Giorgio Curcio, remarked that violent crime was more widespread in the southern regions because of the &ldquo;impetuous and vivacious temperament of those populations&rdquo; (Curcio 1873: 23). But, as we read in the introduction to the judicial statistics of 1869 authored by the Minister of Justice Giovanni De Falco, the &ldquo;passionate desire for personal vendettas&rdquo; found in some provinces &ldquo;in which the moral and material progress of civil life [was] less widespread&rdquo; was a phenomenon destined to disappear. It was &ldquo;legitimate to hope&rdquo; — the Minister went on — &ldquo;that time and changing conditions will gradually eliminate the causes and the effects of these deplorable habits&rdquo; (Ministero di Grazia e Giustizia 1871: viii).</p>
<p>If we go back now to our original question about the existence of a perception of a socio-economic dualism in Italy before the first articulation of the Southern Question, we can outline some general considerations. As I mentioned earlier, although there existed a fairly accurate knowledge of the variation in the structure of property relations in the countryside across the national territory, precise data on the economy were lacking. Quantification remained largely limited to the demographic and institutional elements we have just examined. References to a North—South opposition were not absent from the comments that made official sense of the statistics; the boundaries between these two areas, however, were not yet rigidly fixed. Undoubtedly, the comments reveal a greater sensitivity to the variety of situations in the northern and central parts of the country than in the South (which tended to be referred to as a whole, as a distinct entity even after the broad compartment &ldquo;Neapolitan provinces&rdquo; was replaced with five others). We could say that the southern compartments were less individualized than the others - as appears clearly in the analysis of violent deaths. In other words, an existing scheme or representation of the territory, heavily shaped by previous political arrangements, oriented the reading of the new information provided by the figures. The numbers gave not only the blessing of science, but also a concrete, &ldquo;factual&rdquo; body to territorial entities, making comparison more immediate. And the very statistical procedures of data aggregation tended to emphasize the larger subdivisions of the national territory.</p>
<p>Even when the comparison of various statistical indicators by compartments resulted in marking the distinctiveness of the southern regions, their difference from the general mean was a quantitative difference of degree and did not yet imply a qualitative or essential opposition between North and South. The very averages for the northern areas, in any event, were not something the statisticians felt very proud of. Their faith in the virtue of good administration, their conviction that in any event change was possible, and in fact inevitable, if only the principles of good (namely liberal) government were applied, made the results appear as a temporary outcome. This belief existed in a tension with that search for the &ldquo;laws&rdquo; or regularities characterizing the life of the &ldquo;social body&rdquo; that the statisticians also tried to pursue when they analysed the figures. Indeed, the statistical idea of law tended to posit an underlying being of which means and rates were the expression. This did not fit too well with the belief in historical change effected through human intervention that also informed the outlook of the statisticians. It would take another intellectual and political climate, producing less historically minded observers, for different averages and rates to become the signs of essential differences within the &ldquo;body&rdquo; of the nation.</p>
<h2 id="on-the-making-of-the-paradigm-of-the-two-italies">On the Making of the Paradigm of the &ldquo;Two Italies&rdquo;</h2>
<p>The spread of biological evolutionism and racial determinism in the later part of the century provided this climate. In the 1890s, in the midst of social unrest and the most severe crisis yet to be experienced by the Italian state, the persistence of statistical differentials between northern and southern regions came to be read as the expression of an essential difference, a difference inscribed in the bodies and minds not only of individuals but of whole peoples and that characterized whole societies. This reading of Italian society came from the followers of Lombroso, in particular the Sicilian, Alfredo Niceforo, who was one of the first to use the expression &ldquo;two Italies&rdquo; for which Giustino Fortunato claimed paternity.11</p>
<p>Niceforo proclaimed his faith in statistics at the very beginning of his <em>L&rsquo;Italia barbara contemporanea</em> (1898):</p>
<p>Statistics — which ignorant or malicious people consider a humble handmaid to this or that opinion &hellip; is in fact a truly marvelous precision instrument to investigate social phenomena. These can be placed in two great categories: those that pertain to inferior civilizations, and those that characterize superior civilizations. Statistics has this magic power: it can — through the miraculous language of its figures — indicate if a given phenomenon, expressed by numbers, belongs to one or the other civilization (p. 15).</p>
<p>Accordingly, he proceeded to show how northern and southern Italy exhibited different patterns of crimes (he used a distinction made by the economist and statistician Angelo Messedaglia in 1879 between a criminality distinctive of &ldquo;civilization&rdquo; and one distinctive of &ldquo;barbarism&rdquo; as epigraph to the chapter devoted to these data), levels of literacy, birth rates, suicide and mortality rates, distribution of modern industry, and modes of agriculture. In fact there was much else in the book beside numbers: claims about general features of social life in the southern regions and especially about the character of southerners (and northerners too for that matter), which had little to do with any &ldquo;positive&rdquo; evidence, but were the repository of stereotypes of both old and new coinage. There is no need to recall here Niceforo&rsquo;s vast apparatus of oppositions that defined the two &ldquo;races&rdquo; (&ldquo;Mediterranean&rdquo; southerners, by nature individualist and not inclined to life in society, and &ldquo;Aryan&rdquo; northerners who had a more developed social sentiment and were thus better placed to deal with the requirements of modern society; northerners more cold and thoughtful, southerners more instinctive and easily aroused, and so on): some of them have entered the &ldquo;collective imaginary&rdquo; of contemporary Italians.</p>
<p>In a new work published three years later with the purpose of responding to his critics, <em>Italiani del Nord e Italiani del Sud</em> (1901), Niceforo restated more fully his theses about the two different &ldquo;races&rdquo; inhabiting the Italian peninsula and more systematically subjected his descriptive material to the &ldquo;discipline&rdquo; of statistics. He deployed this time a much larger armory of numerical evidence both in the text and in numerous tables and bar charts at the end of each chapter: 133 numerical tables and 31 graphs, to be exact, as the subtitle specified. As a good positivist, Niceforo invited his critics to pay attention to the authority of the &ldquo;long series of facts&rdquo; that he had accumulated in support of his views. Now even more &ldquo;indices&rdquo; pointed to the alleged radical difference between the &ldquo;two Italies&rdquo;: both fairly traditional ones such as population density and patterns of urbanization, which had been serving as indicators of &ldquo;civilization&rdquo; at least since the 1830s, and new ones such as the diffusion of democratic ideas as measured by the percentage of socialists in municipal councils. Niceforo was actually in trouble when attempting to show the different psychology of the two &ldquo;races&rdquo; with the help of numbers, and had to infer it from the different climates of the places they inhabited. But consistency was apparently not a great concern in his discourse.</p>
<p>It is ironic that while he spoke of two Italies, Niceforo&rsquo;s statistical tables in fact always reported data on three Italies: North, Center and South — with Sicily and Sardinia often apart as extreme examples of &ldquo;southernness.&rdquo; Conveniently, most of the time the Center exhibited values that were in between those of the North and those of the South, thus appearing like a vast borderland in which the two races coexisted (&ldquo;Aryans&rdquo; in Tuscany and &ldquo;Mediterraneans&rdquo; in the rest of the area), generating medium values. However, the author did not explain the rationale for this partition, and it is very likely that he resorted to it in order to generate more contrasting averages between North and South and thus to stengthen his thesis about the two civilizations.</p>
<p>As Niceforo&rsquo;s critics were quick to point out, his &ldquo;facts&rdquo; were not enough to prove his racial explanations; explanations which pointed to the role of socio-historical factors in determining the conditions of the South made much more sense. To be sure, Niceforo did not completely exclude the role of socio-economic factors; but he always inscribed them within his anthropological and racial scheme of interpretation.12 For example, when he noticed the more widespread poverty among the population of the South, he saw it as a factor that had contributed in the course of history to higher levels of &ldquo;organic degeneration&rdquo; and had slowed, if not paralysed, the advancement of that population. This insistence on anthropological diversity was partly functional to the politics of the anthropological school, which was strongly opposed to the centralized structure of the state and called for a federalist reform and the introduction of regional legislation. This could deal more adequately, in their view, with the profoundly different characters of the northern and southern peoples.</p>
<p>State statisticians did not sponsor the work of Lombroso and his followers (Pazzagli 1980: 807—8). Although they all shared a positivist outlook, a faith in &ldquo;objective&rdquo; science and &ldquo;positive&rdquo; knowledge, the simplifying biological determinism of the Lombrosians — not to mention their more than cursory treatment of numbers - never appealed to these researchers, who embraced more complex explanatory paradigms. A political contrast also opposed state statisticians and Lombrosians, since the former remained wedded to liberal and unitary views, while the latter were staunch critics of the centralized state. Questionable new &ldquo;sciences&rdquo; such as criminal anthropology and the biological and racial readings of Italy and its people received, however, unwitting support from the steady diffusion of statistical data on the physical characteristics of the population that was carried out by state statisticians. We have seen how in the mid-1860s Maestri and his collaborators, in the attempt to provide a detailed picture of the national population, began to publish the anthropometric data collected by army doctors in the volumes containing data on population movements. Colorful tables showing the differential distribution of the height of conscripts in the national territory were then published by the Central Statistical Office in the late 1870s and early 1880s (MAIC 1878 and 1882). These data abundantly provided very usable evidence for positivist social observers and anthropologists with a racist bent, such as Niceforo and other Lombrosians.</p>
<p>By calling attention to the role of statistics in the making of the &ldquo;two Italies&rdquo; I intend not only to point to the legitimation that certain statistical data could offer to a racist discourse, but also to question the effects of identifying differences primarily by means of statistics and by the &ldquo;facts&rdquo; highlighted by statistics. Official statistics establish what constitutes significant and authoritative evidence about the state of a given country or its internal subdivisions. They direct the gaze of the observer towards certain facts, those that are and can be translated into numbers. Undoubtedly many of these facts were and are revealing, and indeed are often indispensable for the tasks facing reformers and state administrations alike; but their use tends to re-enforce a classificatory and oppositional way of thinking. A recent example of this thinking may be seen in Robert Putnam&rsquo;s quantitative analysis of the degree of &ldquo;civicness&rdquo; to be found in the northern and southern regions of Italy (Putnam 1993). In late nineteenth-century Italy, the positivist method and the extensive reliance on statistics, I suggest, contributed to establish the kind of &ldquo;comparativist&rdquo; and non-relational approach that has characterized a large part of the debate on the Southern Question and a long tradition of studies on the South.13</p>
<h2 id="more-than-two-italies-only-one-south">More Than Two Italies, Only One South</h2>
<p>The image of the two Italies that dominates the work of late nineteenth-century criminal anthropologists and <em>meridionalisti à la</em> Fortunato did not have at the time an equivalent in the units of reporting used in official statistics (although, as we have seen, references to the larger subdivisions of Italy — northern, central, and southern — appeared in the introductions to various statistical publications). How and when did &ldquo;North&rdquo; and &ldquo;South&rdquo; begin to appear as stable units of reporting? The volumes of the statistical yearbook series, which began to be published in 1878, have always maintained as principal units the same ones I described earlier (of course with some variations in their boundaries mostly due to changes in the national frontiers), namely compartments or regions and, in a subordinate role, provinces (MAIC 1878-1995).14 During the fascist period one can find some scattered references to the larger subdivisions (North, Center, South),15 but it is not until the period after the Second World War that these appear as stable units of reporting in the official statistical yearbooks.</p>
<p>A partition of Italy into the conventional four sections (northern, central, southern, and islands) appeared in the yearbook covering the period 1944—8 - but disappeared again in 1951. It was in 1958 that some of the tables in the yearbooks began to exhibit three statistical <em>ripartizioni</em> (subdivisions): the first one corresponding to the North-West, the second one to the North-East and Center (excluding the southern provinces of Lazio), and the third one to the South plus the islands and southern Lazio. This division, which replaced a previous one by agrarian regions, was used only in the tables on the physical characteristics of the territory, in some graphs, and, starting in 1960, in the tables on territorial economic accounting (in this case all of Lazio was included in the second <em>ripartizione</em>). According to the statisticians themselves, this new tripartite division was introduced mainly to serve a disaggregated study of national accounting (Istituto centrale di statistica 1960: xi—xv). The three areas had distinct economic profiles: the North-West was the most industrialized, the North-East and Center had a strong agriculture and an incipient industrial base, and the South was mostly agricultural. This division, with some variation, has constituted the basis for the image of the &ldquo;three Italies&rdquo; popularized by sociologist Arnaldo Bagnasco in his tripartite model of the economic development of the Italian peninsula (Bagnasco 1993).</p>
<p>The three statistical <em>ripartizioni</em> introduced in 1958 reflected also the renewed political interest in the South in the period after the Second World War, when it became the object of a special intervention and a recipient of special state funding through the institution of the Cassa per il Mezzogiorno. The monitoring of change in the South <em>vis-à-vis</em> the other parts of the country then became a priority for planners. Institutions such as the Associazione per lo sviluppo dell&rsquo; industria nel Mezzogiorno (SVIMEZ), created in 1947, started to produce quantitative research and publications of statistical data focusing on the North-South division (S VI MEZ 1954, 1961, 1978). In the yearbooks, however, only in 1979 were two new units of reporting added for almost all data (they appear at the bottom of each table after the regional and national totals), namely &ldquo;North-Center&rdquo; and &ldquo;Mezzogiorno,&rdquo; in some cases subdivided into, respectively, North-West, North-East, Center, and Southern Italy and Islands. The specific rationale for this innovation is unknown, but it is ironic that the distinction North-South was stabilized and generalized in official statistical publications at about the time when historians and social scientists increasingly tended to reject the category of the South as a single unit of observation and analysis and proceeded to disaggregate it into its multiple components.16</p>
<p>In this essay I have not intended to deny the existence of actual differences between regions in Italy — that would clearly amount to an absurd position. Nor have I argued that the lines that divide the territory of a state are just the inventions of administrators and statisticians. In fact, they often have deep roots in complex historical events and processes — one may mention, as an obvious case for comparison with Italy, the South of the United States.17 But these divisions tend to become naturalized and taken for granted instead of being properly historicized and subjected to questioning. While a nation like Italy is certainly not a homogeneous reality, its regional division is often taken to be a kind of indisputable truth, vulgarized to the level of a cliché. Yet, like the nation, the region too, and the macroregion, far from being natural entities, have a history. So do their statistics. This chapter is intended to be a contribution to a rethinking and a more critical reconstruction of these connected histories, one that takes into consideration the contribution of representations in the making of realities.</p>

<li>
<p>I should make clear here that by the term knowledge I mean a practice that is itself partly &ldquo;constitutive&rdquo; of reality rather than a mere discovery of things &ldquo;out there&rdquo; (although it is useful to preserve the idea of discovery in order to point out the presence of gaps between the expectations of the investigators and what they come to see by applying certain methods of investigation). The reference here is of course M. Foucault, especially the works of his early period (Foucault 1972, 1973).</p>

<p>Some paragraphs in the next two sections of this essay have already appeared in a slightly modified version in Chapter 5 and the epilogue of my book (Patriarca 1996). I am grateful to Cambridge University Press for permission to reprint them here.</p>

<p>In 1862 an attempt to take a census of &ldquo;manufacturing industry&rdquo; failed completely (the attempt was not repeated until 1911); some data on agricultural production were collected by the prefects, but no agricultural census was taken before 1930.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On Correnti see <em>Dizionario Biografico degli Italiani</em>, s.v. There are no recent biographies of Maestri. On his work as a &ldquo;statistician&rdquo; see Patriarca 1996. For more details on his politics see Delia Peruta 1990.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Maestri had some acquaintance with the topic as the author of a detailed study on manufacturing industry in the Italian states published in the Piedmontese <em>Rivista contemporanea</em> in 1858, and reproduced or summarized also in other journals.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Provinces were used as reporting units in the commentary only in the case of literacy rates (measured by the signatures of spouses) and for examining the relation between variations in grain prices and variations in the number of marriages and deaths. Several demographic measures reported by provinces can be found also in tables at the end of the volume on population movements for 1864 (MAIC 1866b).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For example, commenting upon the data on illiteracy, Maestri observed how they &ldquo;were not the fruit of the new civil institutions, but on the contrary the result of a state of things which fortunately does not exist any longer&rdquo; adding that &ldquo;the second Italian census will find the state of public education improved&rdquo; (MAIC 1865: xxvi).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On these studies see Farolfi 1979.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Significantly, the urban—rural comparison used, as we saw, in the analysis of demographic data did not appear at all in the comments on this kind of &ldquo;moral statistics&rdquo; — a sign that, in spite of the fairly frequent episodes of urban unrest, cities were not perceived as a particular threat to the social and political order (nor were they growing enough at the time to be perceived as such).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>See his letter to F. Severini (27 March 1911) cited in Romano 1945: 80, note 15.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On this see also Farolfi 1984: 1209, and Teti 1993.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On the predominance of the comparativist approach see also Galasso 1991: 2.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I limited my systematic perusal to this series and to the volumes of the censuses because they have the largest circulation. I did a less comprehensive check of other series (such as the population movement volumes), which confirmed the conclusions I reached for the former.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>See for example the yearbook of 1933. Also the introductions to the censuses published in the 1930s aggregated some data by these larger subdivisions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The results of this new trend are visible in particular in the work of that group of scholars which in the mid-1980s founded the Istituto per lo studio della società meridionale (IMES) and created the journal <em>Meridiana</em>. In an article (published in this journal) that is one of the most lucid contributions to the rethinking of the Southern Question to appear in recent years, Carmine Donzelli has significantly questioned the excessive reliance of researchers on the South as a unit of analysis and their forgetting that it is one &ldquo;statistical aggregate&rdquo; among several possible ones (1990: 23, note 6). On this new historiographie trend see also J. Davis, &ldquo;The Peculiarities of the South Reconsidered&rdquo; (Chapter 9 in this volume).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The matrix of the unit of reporting called South in the official statistics of the US is to be found in the secessionist states (although the correspondence is only partial, as Barbara Fields has made me notice). Regional units of statistical reporting called &ldquo;geographical divisions&rdquo; appear, however, already before the Civil War. A comparison (as suggested by one of the anonymous readers) of the characteristics and functioning of the &ldquo;discourse of the South&rdquo; in the history of both countries (the US and Italy) could be of great interest.</p>
