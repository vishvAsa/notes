  <p>Casting Off the &ldquo;Southern Problem&rdquo;: Or the Peculiarities of the South Reconsidered1</p>
<p>*John A. Davis *</p>
<h2 id="the-new-agenda">The New Agenda</h2>
<p>It is hardly surprising that the South should figure as one of the central themes in the revisionist agenda around which Italian historians are currently rethinking Italy&rsquo;s path to the twentieth century. Central to that agenda is a questioning of the teleological assumptions that linked the collapse of liberal Italy and the rise of fascism to the failings of modernization in Italy (cf. Davis 1994, Pezzino 1993a, Romanelli 1991).</p>
<p>Nowhere have the assumptions of modernization theory been more influential than in the debates on the &ldquo;Southern Problem&rdquo;. Widely as they differed over the causes, the classical interpretations of the <em>Meridionalisti</em> from the late nineteenth century onwards took as axiomatic that social backwardness was determined by the absence of economic change or growth. These assumptions were firmly embedded in images that have dominated postwar debate on the place of the South in modern Italian history. They are captured in Alexander Gerschenkron&rsquo;s description of Italy as an industrial <em>late comer</em>, and hence subject to highly dualistic, internally contradictory and regionally differentiated processes of economic growth. But they are also present in Antonio Gramsci&rsquo;s &ldquo;Passive Revolution.&rdquo; For Gerschenkron, modernization occurred without and despite the Mezzogiorno; for Gramsci, the social and economic retardation of the Mezzogiorno blighted the opportunity for a full bourgeois revolution in Italy in the mid-nineteenth century, and remained thereafter — through the <em>Blocco Storico</em> — the principal obstacle to political and social modernization.</p>
<p>The debate that focused around Gramsci&rsquo;s thesis was, of course, closely linked to the ambitious postwar programs for reconstruction in the South. This was a project that — at least for a short season — mobilized impressive intellectual and cultural energies in the South and created many unusual political alliances (Bevilacqua 1993). But despite the vitality of these postwar debates, the South had to some extent become a prisoner of its own notoriety — not least because the immensely rich documentation provided by the classical studies of the <em>Meridionalisti</em> until only very recently continued to provide the sole documentary base for discussion. The established images of backwardness that were inherited from the past were now to be reinforced by a new vocabulary of developmental sociology that, with concepts like &ldquo;amoral familism,&rdquo; locked the South into a time-warp of social primitivism and economic immobilismi (cf. Banfîeld 1958).</p>
<p>But the South&rsquo;s postwar experience — viewed half a century on — has shown the premisses of these debates to be without solid foundation. Economic growth and social changes since 1947 have been dramatic, and have profoundly changed the fabric of southern society. <em>Bank of Italy</em> estimates suggest, for example, that between 1947 and 1983 production <em>per capita</em> increased threefold in the South, and reached figures comparable to those of Northern and Central Italy twenty years earlier. If the gap between North and South remained, it must be remembered that growth in Northern Italy in these years had been amongst the most dynamic in the whole of Europe (Barbagallo 1990). In the 1980s, the rapid expansion of small enterprises not only in Apulia, but also in historically poor agricultural regions like the Abruzzi and Beneventano, signaled to some that the Mezzogiorno was finally breaking out of the trap of backwardness and following the paths of belated but dynamic economic growth pioneered by the &ldquo;third&rdquo; Italy - Umbria, Tuscany, the Marches, and the Veneto, the regions that in the 1980s became synonymous with the new Italian entrepreneurship (Trigilia 1988, 1992).</p>
<p>In the event, those expectations remained short-lived, and the significance of postwar economic growth in the South still remains open to question. Southern Italy is still at the bottom of the European league in terms of <em>per capita</em> income and production, suggesting that in real terms the North-South gap may have widened. In 1989 a SVIMEZ report curtly referred to what it called &ldquo;mere appearances of modernity:&rdquo; a view reinforced by economists like Augusto Graziani (Barbagallo 1990).</p>
<p>Whatever the nature of postwar economic and social change, change there has been - and on a scale without precedent. Yet these changes have not been accompanied — and this is where modernization theory is most obviously wrong-footed - by a decline in those structural problems traditionally associated with the Mezzogiorno - poverty, unemployment, institutional and structural inertia. Indeed, until very recently, there has been notable deterioration on all these fronts, and a massive qualitative decline in the structures of civil society and the quality of life in the postwar Mezzogiorno - a deterioration that, despite improvements in living standards and public health, is evident in the appalling inadequacies of public services and infrastructures (hospitals, schools, urban planning, etc.), persistently high levels of unemployment and (both symptom and cause) the devastating growth in the closely interdependent phenomena of organized crime and political corruption.</p>
<p>Postwar experiences have necessarily reformulated the classical questions addressed at the South, and a new historical agenda no longer seeks to explain why there has been no economic change, but why it is that economic change has not been accompanied by more solid processes of economic growth and social and institutional modernization: a set of questions that is often summarized (not without an element of tautology) in the formula of &ldquo;modernization without growth&rdquo; <em>(modernizzazione senza sviluppo</em>).</p>
<p>Inverting the central problematic and taking not economic immobilism or backwardness, but rather a persistent failure of economic change to trigger off wider processes of growth, has had the effect of challenging the stereotypes of backwardness, and offers an opportunity to emancipate the South, at least in part, from the suffocating weight of the &ldquo;Southern Problem.&rdquo; In his recent <em>Short History of Southern Italy</em>, Piero Bevilacqua ( 1993) calls for the &ldquo;Southern Problem&rdquo; to be cast off altogether. Identification with the Southern Problem has, Bevilacqua argues, made the history of the South synonymous with failure and backwardness in ways that have turned the historical experience of the enormously variegated southern regions and their people into a single, undifferentiated and stereotyped &ldquo;Mezzogiorno&rdquo; — a mere negative reflection of the North that is denied any &ldquo;history&rdquo; of its own.</p>
<p>Whether this is feasible — and whether his own work succeeds in making this neat separation - will be discussed below. But in arguing that the South&rsquo;s path to the twentieth century deserves to be studied in its own right and in its own terms, Bevilacqua echoes a much wider concern of the new history of the South. By shifting the focus from immobilism and backwardness to &ldquo;change without growth&rdquo; or &ldquo;difficult modernization,&rdquo; the traditional parameters of what is southern come into new perspective. Rather than ask why there was no internal pressure for growth, the new agenda asks instead: why have the forces for change and growth within the South been unable to assert themselves more effectively over the last century and a half? What was the nature of these forces? Have the constraints been external or internal? It also asks whether the South&rsquo;s path to the twentieth century does not represent a particular pattern of capitalist development rather than the failure to attain some abstract model of modern economic growth.</p>
<p>That has also reopened discussion on the political role of the South, and not least the nature of the <em>Blocco Storico —</em> the alliance between reactionary southern landlordism and northern industry. Not only for Gramsci and the Left, the <em>Blocco Storico</em> has widely been seen as the corner-stone of Italian politics from the protective tariffs of the 1880s to Mussolini&rsquo;s agrarian autarky - indeed, for many the Christian Democrats&rsquo; success in turning the South into an electoral fortress after 1949 has been seen as a continuation of the politics of the <em>Blocco Storico</em> by other means. But without backwardness and immobilism, both the concept and the politics of the <em>Blocco Storico</em> call for careful reconsideration.</p>
<p>This chapter will examine very briefly some of the ways in which the &ldquo;new&rdquo; history is redefining these central themes in the historical experience of the contemporary South and will ask to what extent it is indeed possible to study the South in terms other than those of the &ldquo;Southern Problem&rdquo;.2</p>
<h2 id="a-difficult-modernization">A Difficult Modernization?</h2>
<p>The new agenda replaces an image of the South locked into timeless immobilism with one that highlights instead the particularly persistent, unpredictable, and unstable nature of economic change. The studies by Biagio Salvemini, Angelo Massafra, Luigi Masella, and others at the University of Bari, by Giuseppe Barone and Salvatore Lupo and others in Sicily, by Piero Bevilacqua, Augusto Placanica, and others on Calabria, and by the Neapolitan group around Pasquale Villani and Paolo Macry have clearly documented the variety of forms of economic change that were present within the nineteenth-century South (Barone 1983; Bevilacqua and Placanica 1985; Lupo 1990; Macry and Villani 1990; Masella 1983; Masella and Salvemini 1990; Massafra 1988; Salvemini 1984).</p>
<p>Their research brings into profile two characteristics that were hidden by the stereotype of economic immobilism: the first is the immense economic diversity of the regions that constitute the South; the second is the ubiquity, constancy, and disruptive impact of economic change in these regions.</p>
<p>New emphasis on the internal diversities of the South poses a fundamental question: what, if any, are the &ldquo;unities&rdquo; of southern history since Unification? Its political integrity vanished in 1861, while in economic terms the South constituted a number of distinct and quite separate regions, which after 1860 had in many cases less rather than more contact with one another, and whose principal economic ties and emigrant flows were directed outwards and away from the South (in the case of Sicily across the Atlantic; in the case of Apulia, north along the new railroad to Rome and central and northern Italy and along the Adriatic; while Naples lost many of its commercial and economic ties with its former provinces once it lost its status as a capital).</p>
<p>The &ldquo;Southern Problem&rdquo; in the decades after Unification was of course constructed from perceptions of common features of the South and of southerners — defective social organization, criminality, racial inferiority, and so forth. The ways in which images of the South were constructed in the nineteenth century have been revisited recently by Dickie (1992), Moe (1992) and Pick (1986). They offer an interesting reformulation in postmodernist idiom of earlier observations by Gramsci and Salvemini, but may unwittingly strengthen the notion that the South existed simply as an &ldquo;otherness&rdquo; that served to define identities after Unification, thereby again reducing the historical experience of the South to a series of metaphors. But rather than dwell on image-making, the new historiography is more concerned to explore and reconstruct the economic and social realities of the South after Unification and to document the conditions and experiences that were common to the South as a whole.</p>
<p>One answer is provided by the formula of &ldquo;difficult modernization:&rdquo; if the southern regions did experience economic change (and had been doing so from much earlier than Unification), they did so in circumstances and on terms that were particularly disadvantageous. The key agent of economic change was the market, but the changes that this brought were persistently uncertain and unstable, because of the extremely precarious and vulnerable terms on which the southern economies were integrated into international markets. It is easily forgotten, for example, that the southern regions — Apulia, Sicily, Campania — remained until 1914 much more closely dependent on overseas export markets than on national markets. Sicilian oranges, for example, were not sold in Milan until the twentieth century, although for decades they had been sold in huge quantities in the United States (Lupo 1990).</p>
<p>This perspective on economic change in the South up-ends many accepted images of the &ldquo;backwardness&rdquo; of southern society and economic operators. Biagio Salvemini, and most recently Alberto Band (Salvemini 1984; Banti 1989a), have argued that the mercurial and shifting character of the markets in which southern producers found themselves operating account for the preference for a wide range of short-term, multi-sectoral, and essentially speculative investments. These can be seen as rational responses to prevailing circumstances, informed by a logic of risk-sharing in uncertain and uncontrollable markets. Rather than the embodiment of entrepreneurial &ldquo;backwardness,&rdquo; therefore, the multiple investments of Verga&rsquo;s Mastro Don Gesualdo become instead a paradigm of entrepreneurial rationality (Iachello and Signoreili 1987).</p>
<h2 id="difficult-modernization-modernization-without-growth-or-passive-modernization">Difficult Modernization: Modernization without Growth or Passive Modernization</h2>
<p>The subordination of southern producers to powerful external markets, over which no effective controls could be established, can also account for the absence of more solid economic infrastructures. But if there is considerable agreement on the central importance of economic vulnerability and uncertainty in the South (although one might ask whether this was not also true of other Italian regions as well?), there is less consensus, however, over the implications of this &ldquo;difficult modernization.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Did the relatively anarchical and unstable forms of economic change experienced in the South preclude the possibility of more solid processes of economic growth? Bevilacqua, for one, denies this, and insists that despite the obstacles imposed by natural constraints and by unstable markets, it is possible to identify longer-term phenomena of growth. These focused around the gradual development of small and middling peasant properties, which were vehicles for accumulation and established reservoirs of entrepreneurship that would eventually find expression in the post-1945 era (Bevilacqua 1993).</p>
<p>The slow and discontinuous pace of growth, Bevilacqua insists, had little to do with a lack of propensity for modern economic organization or development, but was caused by the failure of successive Italian governments after 1860 to recognize the particular requisites for economic growth in the South. One of the most striking arguments lies in the line of continuity he detects between the land reclamation program and legislation evolved by the last Bourbon governments of the early nineteenth century, Serpieri&rsquo;s <em>Bonifica Integrale</em>, and the original program of the postwar <em>Cassa per il Mezzogiorno</em>. The failure to implement that program, he argues, can be explained only in terms of Italy&rsquo;s postwar political system, which has prioritized the creation of networks of political patronage at the expense of productive investment. However, Leandra D&rsquo;Antone&rsquo;s detailed study of irrigation projects and initiatives in Apulia suggests that the obstacles were far more complex and the earlier provisions much less effective than Bevilacqua claims (D&rsquo;Antone 1990). While castigating the shortcomings of the southern ruling class in the postwar period, Bevilacqua insists that the principal constraints on economic growth in the South have been external and are located in Italy&rsquo;s postwar political system (Bevilacqua 1993).</p>
<p>Bevilacqua&rsquo;s &ldquo;optimistic&rdquo; reading of the capacity for growth in the South has been challenged, and certainly raises a number of questions. At one point, for example, he argues that the natural (geographical, physical, market) obstacles to growth in the South demanded exceptional entrepreneurial skills; but how does this square with his concerns for the shortcomings of southern entrepreneurship? And how do these concerns square with the insistence on the South&rsquo;s historical &ldquo;industrial vocation&rdquo;? Why has the growth on which he insists not been accompanied by the formation of a southern middle class with more positive attributes? His arguments have a tendency to weave between exogenous and endogenous constraints in ways that do not always avoid confusion, or distinguish clearly between endogenous obstacles (for example his critique of southern entrepreneurship and of the southern ruling classes) and exogenous forces (the state and the political system).</p>
<p>Others, while recognizing that prevailing economic conditions imposed a particular rationality on economic activity in the South, have also seen these conditions as a principal cause for the absence of more continuous forms of economic growth. In this view, persistent and unstable economic change has not simply conditioned — as Bevilacqua argues - particular forms of growth in the South, but has made solid growth impossible. In this perspective, the South&rsquo;s path to the twentieth century is described as &ldquo;modernization without growth&rdquo; (<em>modernizzazione sema sviluppo</em>).</p>
<p>The phrase probably works better as a rhetorical flourish than as an analytical formula, because the terms are slippery and have a tendency to become interchangeable; but it seeks to capture the peculiarities of modernization in the South. One application of this explanation of the absence of institutional and social change can be found in Diego Gambetta&rsquo;s recent study of the economic functions of the mafia. Developing an essentially market-driven analysis, Gambetta argues that chronic economic uncertainty and insecurity, combined with weak public authority in western Sicily, created the essential institutional and economic conditions for the development of the mafia. The mafia developed and gained strength not simply as a form of organized violence, but above all because it provided the essential commodities of protection and insurance in an environment in which these could not be provided by a weak state or from within a civil society where the rule of law remained weak, and personal power and violence the norm (Gambetta 1993).</p>
<p>This functionalist approach brings important new insights on the economics of the mafia and can also be seen as part of a wider tendency to explain key structural features of Southern society — the relative weakness of public authority and horizontal social formations and solidarities — in the light of prevailing economic conditions. In those terms, Sicily and the South more generally can be seen as victims of Polanyi&rsquo;s <em>Great Transformation</em>, where the violence of change precluded the formation of those checks and controls that Polanyi identified as the keys to political and social stability. But the weakness of the argument is, of course, that it offers no adequate explanation of why the mafia historically developed in certain regions and not in others, or why and how the geography of the mafia has changed profoundly over time — and especially since the 1960s. (Gambetta does address the issue, but only to argue that &ldquo;responses&rdquo; in other areas were different because conditions were different.)</p>
<p>Gambetta&rsquo;s analysis would seem to confirm what Luciano Cafagna — a staunch advocate of the dualistic character of Italian economic growth (Cafagna 1989) — has described in characteristically provocative terms as &ldquo;passive modernization.&rdquo; Arguing that there never was a real process of modernization in the Mezzogiorno, Cafagna points out that it is hardly surprising to discover that economic change occurred: how could it not? But the economic changes that did occur were almost exclusively external in origin, and the response of the southern élites was invariably &ldquo;Things must change to stay the same.&rdquo; The attitude of the southern élites was defensive and sought wherever possible to minimize the extent and impact of what Cafagna describes as a process of &ldquo;passive — as opposed to active — modernization&rdquo; (Cafagna 1989).</p>
<p>Here we seem to be coming around full circle, and indeed Cafagna&rsquo;s polemical intent is to reaffirm the anti-modern outlook of the southern entrepreneurial élites. His &ldquo;passive modernization&rdquo; is a rewriting of Gramsci&rsquo;s &ldquo;Passive Revolution&rdquo; and the <em>Blocco Storico</em>, but his case relies heavily on contrasts between North and South that recent research has begun to question. Not only are we now more aware of the variety of economic interests that were present in the South, but a number of historians have also begun to explore the realities that lay behind stereotypes of northern capitalism and entrepreneurship (cf. Banti 1989b; Fumian 1984, 1990; Lanaro 1993).</p>
<h2 id="the-blocco-storico">The <em>Blocco Storico</em></h2>
<p>Emphasis on the variety of economic interests present in the South necessarily leads to a reconsideration of the political expression of those interests. For Salvemini, for Gramsci and for Sereni, the <em>Blocco Storico</em> — the alliance between reactionary southern landlordism and northern industrial interests that took shape around the protective tariffs of the 1880s and thereafter dominated Italy&rsquo;s political system until the collapse of the Liberal state - was the political reality that sat at the heart of the &ldquo;Southern Problem.&rdquo; But as Giuseppe Barone, Luigi Masella, and Salvatore Lupo and others argued in the volume that first gave the revisionists a new agenda, the original formulation of the <em>Blocco Storico</em> locked the South into an undifferentiated backwardness that seriously underestimated not only the diversity, but also the strength of more progressive sectors and more progressive groups (Giarrizzo 1983).</p>
<p>It is now evident that important sections of southern producers were strongly hostile to tariff protection in the 1880s, which they knew would damage their economic interests and leave their valuable export crops vulnerable to reprisal (as indeed occurred). Re-examination of the debates that surrounded the tariff issue in the 1880s has revealed the presence of a variety of different and coherent programs for growth in the South, and has also led to a re-evaluation of the relative balance between &ldquo;progressive&rdquo; and more archaic sectors of the southern economy.</p>
<p>It has been recognized that there were a number of relatively dynamic economic sectors in the South - in particular, those linked to high value-added cash crops like olives, citrus fruits, specialized Mediterranean market-garden products, and processing industries. But it has generally been argued that these were too heavily exposed to uncertain market circumstances to survive (the impact, for example, of the agrarian crisis in the 1880s, of phylloxera on southern wine exports, of the collapse of agricultural prices during the Depression, and of fascist commercial policies in the 1930s). As a result, the economic history of the modern Mezzogiorno has long been depicted as a Manichean struggle between the &ldquo;progressive&rdquo; and the &ldquo;backward&rdquo; sectors, in which the former were the losing contender (see Sereni 1947; Rossi Doria 1948, 1958).</p>
<p>It is precisely this contrast between what Manlio Rossi Doria described as &ldquo;the bones and the flesh&rdquo; of southern agriculture that has been extensively reconsidered. A major focus here has been the <em>latifondo</em>, the vast grain-producing estates that dominated many parts of the mainland Mezzogiorno (Capitanata, the Apulian Tavoliere, the Ionian plains of Calabria, and western Sicily) and have long been considered expression and cause of the agrarian backwardness of the South.</p>
<p>New studies now question that image and show that in practice the <em>latifondo</em> combined extensive wheat-growing and transhumant grazing with the more intensive and hence modern production of high value-added cash crops. Whereas Emilio Sereni — like Gramsci — saw the <em>latifondo</em> as a residue of feudalism, more recent studies stress its capitalist nature and its nineteenth-century origins. Rather than relics from the feudal past, the vast latifundist estates grew out of the ashes of the <em>Ancien Régime</em> and took shape from the huge sales of Crown, Church and common lands that began in the Napoleonic period and were renewed after Unification. (For Sicily see Blok 1985; Lupo 1990; Schneider and Schneider 1976; for Apulia see Cormio 1983; for Calabria see Petrusewicz 1996.)</p>
<p>As a creature of the nineteenth century, and of the combination of high value-added cash crops with the more traditional extensive pasture and wheat-growing, the <em>latifondo</em> was commercially oriented, creating a &ldquo;system&rdquo; that permitted considerable flexibility in responding to changing market conditions. When export markets were poor, the system could fall back on the extensive sector and its own internal markets. Marta Petrusewicz, for example, stresses how the management of the vast Barracco estates in Calabria constituted a commercially oriented form of production that was rational and made highly flexible use of the resources available through a system that again sought to minimize the risks inherent in those markets (see Lupo 1990; Petrusewicz 1996).</p>
<p>Some critics have seen in Petrusewicz&rsquo;s depiction of the <em>latifondo</em> and her emphasis on its rationality and paternalism something akin to an apologia. But there are also questions about the nature of this &ldquo;rationality,&rdquo; which seems to have remained dependent on exploitation of a captive labor force on the estates and on the maintenance of a variety of different forms of monopolies, which certainly enhanced the profitability of the enterprise, but at the same time inhibited wider forms of commercial and economic development within the vast bounds of the Barracco estates. Recognition of the rationality of the enterprise and indeed of the modernity of its management in some sectors, does not necessarily deny that the <em>latifondo</em> remained an obstacle to wider forms of economic change — by perpetuating non-economic constraints, by holding back levels of consumption and preventing the development of an internal market. Even had the functionality of the system not been undermined by the agricultural crisis (which reduced profits, increased pressure on the labor force, and ultimately exacerbated social tensions), it is difficult to see how this system could have moved beyond a defensive response to prevailing market conditions to become a force for growth.</p>
<p>The stress on the rationality of the management of the Barracco estates cannot, therefore, fully dispel an earlier image of the <em>latifondo</em> as an obstacle to economic growth - or at least an institution designed to respond to changing external demand and conditions. But the devastating effect of the agricultural crisis of the 1880s on the Barracco estates that Petrusewicz documents does point to what is now seen more generally as a key turning-point in the economic history of the South. Before the 1880s the southern economies offered many windows of comparative advantage that could be successfully exploited — olive oil, wines, and citrus fruits being the most obvious. But after that date, the changed structure of world markets and the changed structure of the industrial economies as they entered the Second Industrial Revolution heavily reduced those spaces.</p>
<p>The importance of these changes emerges sharply from Salvatore Lupo&rsquo;s recent and fine study of the Sicilian citrus industry from the nineteenth to the mid-twentieth century. Oranges and lemons were throughout this period Sicily&rsquo;s single most valuable export commodity. In documenting the rise and fall of citrus production and the citrus trade, Lupo reveals how the Sicilian producers and merchants found it increasingly difficult to remain competitive as they entered the twentieth century. Here again the latifundist and the commercial sectors were closely integrated, and Lupo shows that this did not prevent Sicilian producers from initially taking advantage of expanding US markets in the second half of the nineteenth century. But this was not accompanied by structural or organizational change: the Sicilian producers continued to rely on established factors of production, and when their export markets were challenged by rival citrus production in California and Florida they were unable to respond. They had no domestic markets to fall back on, and while they proved well able to organize effective associations for political and commercial lobbying, they were wary of introducing changes in methods of production that might reduce their own control or power, showed little interest in investing in new sectors such as processing industries, and were reluctant to enter into alliance with powerful northern banking and financial concerns for fear that this might jeopardize their autonomy. Even more important, they were unable to exert significant pressure on the government, which consistently adopted policies that damaged their interests (Lupo 1990; see also Rienzo 1996).</p>
<p>These characteristics are echoed in other studies of southern entrepreneurs in the Giolittian period, and call into question more than one feature of the <em>Blocco Storico</em>. Lupo&rsquo;s study — like the work of Giuseppe Barone, Luigi Masella, and others — indicates that economic interests in the South were more variegated than the old notion of a <em>Blocco Storico</em> allowed. But these studies also point to the failure of the southern élites to adopt more aggressively modernizing strategies — a failure that cannot, they argue, be attributed simply to the determinism of the market-place.</p>
<h2 id="the-southern-bourgeoisie">The Southern Bourgeoisie</h2>
<p>Re-examination of the role of the &ldquo;visible hand&rdquo;, that is to say the strategies, decisions and mentalities of the southern economic operators, leads on to a wider consideration of the nature and development of the southern bourgeoisie - the class that from the time of Pasquale Villari&rsquo;s <em>Lettere Meridionali</em> to the present have been blamed for most, if not all, the ills of the South (what study fails to cite Salvemini &rsquo;s judgment on the <em>piccola borghesia</em> of Molfetta?).</p>
<p>Paolo Macry&rsquo;s important study of the impact of economic change on five Neapolitan patrician families in the nineteenth century adopts a view from above, and offers an excellent example of the uncertainties that accompanied economic change in the South. Macry&rsquo;s study offers even stronger evidence that the southern patrician class was dealt a devastating blow after Unification by the twin impact of the agrarian crisis and massive increases in fiscal burdens. Falling revenues and rising taxes drove these families from the patrician world of land and lineage into a new world of cash and commodities. Their fortunes varied, but sons were now more likely to inherit large debts than broad hectares, and with these changes a whole subculture of aristocratic family strategies and norms became redundant. Like the landed classes in Italy as a whole, Macry&rsquo;s patricians made the transition from a landed to a cash economy; yet it was a transition they made hesitatingly and haltingly, as they tried to cling to earlier aristocratic ways and values and sought to distance themselves from the bourgeois world of which they were now inseparably part (Caglioti 1955; Macry 1988a,b; Montroni 1996).</p>
<p>Macry&rsquo;s study finely pinpoints the realities and indeed the irreversible nature of economic change in the nineteenth century and charts the dramatic demise of the landed patriciate — there was to be no persistence of the <em>Ancien Régime</em> in the Mezzogiorno. But it also shows that the old order in the South passed without its being clear whose was the inheritance.</p>
<p>The uncertainty of the processes of social change in the South is emphasized in other studies that have focused in particular on the links between social formation and state formation. Although the rise of the professional classes began earlier, the creation of an &ldquo;administrative monarchy&rdquo; in the Napoleonic era marked the first clear step forward. Under the Restored Bourbon monarchy, provincial administration continued to act as an important pole for professional employment (on the period 1800-60 see especially Massafra 1988 and more recently Di Ciommo 1993); but it was Unification and the introduction of elected local government that really gave the expansion of the southern bourgeoisie its critical perch and purchase. Giuseppe Civile (1990), Gabriella Gribaudi (1990), and Paolo Pezzino (1993) have all shown how the establishment of elected local administrations created new vectors for professional employment in the South, in which new social, political, and economic networks intersected with older ties of kinship and faction.</p>
<p>While in many respects - in their tastes, culture, and forms of sociability - the new social forces that took shape in the South resembled their counterparts in other parts of Europe, the southern bourgeoisie was in large part (as Pezzino puts it) &ldquo;born in the shadow of the processes of modernization that originated from the State&rdquo; (Pezzino 1993: 32). Did this &ldquo;dependency&rdquo; from the start anticipate what has in the twentieth century been described as a <em>borghesia assistita</em> characterized by an <em>imprenditorialità assistita</em>? Such thoughts have led some to look again for the cultural and social reasons for the absence of more aggressive forms of modernization in the South.</p>
<p>Working backwards from the reasons why small enterprises failed to establish themselves in the South in the 1980s, Carlo Trigilia, for example, has argued that in the North the expansion of market capitalism in the nineteenth century resulted in collective mobilization and the development of mass political movements that brought about mechanisms for regulating and controlling the working of market forces. With collective mobilization in the North came the introduction of what Polanyi termed &ldquo;social defense mechanisms,&rdquo; in ways that then reduced the importance of more primary social institutions such as the family and kin groups in favor of wider collective organizations. These developments in turn created the infrastructures essential for social and economic modernization (Trigilia 1988). In the South, it is argued, there was no comparable mobilization, with the result that political parties remained weak and trade unions non-existent, so that the family and the kin-groups retained their paramount function as agents of social defense. This in turn created the basis for clientist politics and the primacy of sectoral and partisan interests in ways that inhibited collective political values and organization.</p>
<p>As yet there has been no serious attempt to re-examine the social institutions of the South, and new discussions of the &ldquo;social constraints&rdquo; on growth have preferred to resurrect outworn and ahistorical cultural determinisms to explain the absence of &ldquo;civic traditions&rdquo; [no matter how elegantly presented, Putnam (1993) represents this direction]. Generally these excursions into the social and cultural &ldquo;peculiarities&rdquo; of the South have failed to take account of how far patterns of social and economic organization in the North differed from ideal-type models. The work of Banti on Emilia (1989b), and of Lanaro (1984) and Fumian (1984) on Venetian entrepreneurship, for example, reveal how little collective solidarities had to do with the success of northern capitalism in either the nineteenth or the twentieth centuries (see also Corner 1996).</p>
<h2 id="the-south-the-state-and-politics">The South, the State and Politics</h2>
<p>Perhaps one of the most important features of the new southern historiography has been to revisit and revise many of those ideal stereotypes in which the North-South contrasts have for long been drawn. In challenging the notion that capitalism and Liberalism were either synonymous or interdependent in Emilia or in the Veneto, Banti, Lanaro, and others effectively removed one of the polarities on which the old &ldquo;Southern Problem&rdquo; depended.</p>
<p>How does this more brutal assessment of the processes of capitalist development in the North refocus the question of economic and social change in the South? One solution would be to invoke the pluralism of modern economic growth, and identify a particular &ldquo;southern&rdquo; path to the twentieth century. But thanks to the new work on both the North and the South it is becoming possible to identify real differences and distinctions. Amongst these, probably the most important lies in the relationships between state and society in the North (and Center) and in the South.</p>
<p>The dependence of the southern bourgeoisie on state employment has already been noted, and new research has shown the extent to which — from the beginning of the nineteenth century - the southern bourgeoisie began to &ldquo;invade&rdquo; the State, causing a peculiar blurring of public and private power (Aliberti 1987; Davis 1994; Pezzino 1987; Spagnoletti 1985). Was this unique to the South? It is important to distinguish carefully here. Northern/Central Italy-especially Tuscany, Piedmont, Lombardy, and the Veneto — provides endless examples of the survival of forms of private power and influence that remained almost untouched by the presence or the realities of the State until 1900 or beyond. There were crucial consequences — in the Veneto, for example, a paternalistic order to which the State remained external existed into the twentieth century, leaving the landowners as <em>padrones quasi patres</em> (Lanaro 1984). In the South, on the other hand, that paternal order — which survived in Lombardy, Piedmont, and Tuscany at least until the closing decades of the nineteenth century— had collapsed much earlier. Why? The history of social relations in the South cannot be written without reference to the tensions and violence that made the South one of the principal epicenters of political upheaval, revolution, and endemic rural unrest and protest in Europe down to the middle of the nineteenth century. The tendency of the southern élites to &ldquo;invade&rdquo; the institutions of the State may have had economic motives, but it cannot be divorced from the wider tensions that characterized much of rural society in the South — to which both the mafia and the <em>camorra</em> can also be seen as responses.</p>
<p>In short, at a time when the paternalist worlds of their Venetian, Tuscan, and Lombard counterparts remained largely undisturbed, throughout the South the position of the élites was more precarious. Challenged from below and subject to profound internal transformations, the emergence of new élites in the South in the nineteenth century cannot be isolated from the uncertainties of economic change; but nor can it be separated from the equally uncertain processes of political change and social tension. This was one reason why the southern élites from the start looked to the State and its institutions for protection as well as resources. While the northern landowners could keep the State at a distance (at least until later in the century, when their authority also began to be challenged), the southern élites turned to the resources of the State to reinforce their own fragile power.</p>
<p>The ties of interdependence between the southern bourgeoisie and the State went far beyond material benefit, and the role of the southern intellectuals in formulating the theory of the State and in developing Italian nationalism in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries needs to be reconsidered in this light. It is also worth contrasting this strong intellectual and theoretical commitment to the State in the South to the opposition to the interference of the State that was articulated overwhelmingly in the North in the distinction made famous by Stefano Jacini between &ldquo;Real Italy&rdquo; and &ldquo;Legal Italy&rdquo; after Unification (Davis 1994; Di Ciommo 1993).</p>
<p>But if the southern bourgeoisie wanted a stronger state, why did the State remain weak in the South and why did the demarcations between public and private power remain particularly indistinct? Although it was an exceptional case — and exceptional within the South, it should be remembered — recent studies of the mafia offer some important indications. The persistence and the terrible increase in the power and geography of the mafia in recent decades not only constitutes a fundamental challenge to any attempt to equate economic modernization with institutional change, but has also made the mafia the subject of a serious historical analysis for the first time. The carefully documented studies by Salvatore Lupo and Paolo Pezzino have reconstructed the historical origins of the mafia in Sicily from the late nineteenth century, and revealed its organized and criminal character from the start. This is important because — over and above the economic functions examined by Gambetta — these studies show that there cannot be any adequate explanation of the mafia that is couched solely in terms of the subcultures and values that were peculiar to western Sicily. Nor, indeed, can the mafia be explained solely in terms of economic conditions. Nor, as Lupo argues, can the mafia be seen as a residue of the <em>Ancien Régime:</em> it was its gravedigger, the product of radical changes in the nature and composition of the Sicilian elites, at a moment when the absence of a powerful state gave opportunities for new groups (the notorious <em>gabelotti</em> and other intermediaries) to assert their power. This they did, both through the exercise of violence and through cooperation with the representatives of the new state. The mafia was a purveyor not only of protection, but also of votes and &ldquo;social control&rdquo; in ways that made the mafia clans from the start not only powerful brokers between state and society, but essential partners in government.</p>
<p>Why did the new Italian state enter into covert alliance with the mafia in ways that guaranteed its further growth? The answer would seem to be that the mafia in western Sicily offered the representatives of the new state durable allies in a region that was otherwise characterized by fragile and faction-ridden structures of notable politics. The alliance between the political representatives of the new state and mafia factions in Sicily was also replicated elsewhere in the South in other ways, and Gabriella Gribaudi&rsquo;s study of Eboli shows, for example, how the administrators of the new state, while bemoaning factionalism in the South, carefully worked to foster and encourage it, because it provided them with political alternatives that any factional monopoly or firmer organization of power would have precluded (Gribaudi 1990). When these political alliances are set in the context of the particular processes of political exchange that determined relations between center and periphery in Liberal Italy (Romanelli 1988, Pezzino 1987, 1993b), it becomes clear that the process of state formation in the South played on and indeed perpetuated factional rivalries and divisions.</p>
<p>The State can therefore be seen as an important agent of political fragmentation and disunity in the South. This is also one of the reasons why, despite the extent to which the southern élites had &ldquo;invaded&rdquo; the administrative structures of the State, southerners remained ill-equipped to influence economic policies or to protect wider economic interests. A good example is that of the tariffs of 1889. Both Lupo and Petrusewicz show that the southern latifundists were deeply hostile to agricultural protectionism, which they knew would devastate their valuable export trades. So why did the southerners vote for a measure that was damaging to their economic interests? They did so as a trade-off for the shelving of a program of tax reform which would have abolished the fiscal privileges the South had been conceded in 1861. Why was one interest traded for another? Because the fiscal question created greater unanimity than the tariff question, and the studies by Giuseppe Barone, Salvatore Lupo, and Francesco Barbagallo on the politics of southern agrarian, commercial, and financial interests reveal how often the highly fragile and diversified character of the southern economies precluded concerted action and encouraged the development of the &ldquo;politics of exchange&rdquo; in ways that left broader interests vulnerable. Some of the best examples of this vulnerability were to come from the 1920s and 1930s, when, as Lupo shows, the interests of first southern commercial exporters and then the southern landowners more generally were ruinously subordinated to the needs of fascist economic policy (which traded Sicilian lemons with Hitler for coal and steel). There is no better example of this vulnerability than the attempt by the Sicilian landowners to stage a strike against the fascist internal colonization policies in 1940!</p>
<h2 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h2>
<p>Where does all this take the debate on the South? The new southern history has probably been more successful in knocking down stereotypes than in exorcising the Southern Problem, and the difficulty of reformulating the history of the South <em>de novo</em> is evident in the plurality of formulae that have been adopted and indeed in the slipperiness of alternative formulations — especially <em>modernizzazione senza sviluppo</em>. Having said that, the terms of the old debate on the South have been largely transformed, while this has been accompanied by a critical rethinking of certain &ldquo;models&rdquo; of northern capitalism. The history of the South can now be freed, if not of the Southern Problem, at least of two sets of abstract stereotypes (Lanaro 1993). While reconfirming the weaknesses of the southern bourgeoisie and the southern entrepreneurial classes the new agenda also moves beyond the stereotypes of the <em>Blocco Storico</em> to reveal the central role that the Italian state and its political systems have played in the development of the South - a role characterized most often by exploitation of the economic and political weaknesses of the region.</p>
<p>This is not simply to introduce another &ldquo;exogenous&rdquo; interpretation: the State did not create the divisions amongst the southern élites, nor did the State create the economic diversities that divided these élites, nor indeed the region&rsquo;s vulnerable exposure to international markets. But if the &ldquo;Southern Problem&rdquo; has derived in part from factors present within the South, it has also been shaped by the processes of state formation that form part of Italian history more generally. From the time of Unification, the actions of the State have consistently fostered and exacerbated those divisions. The nineteenth-century mafia, for example, was at least in part a creation of the political system that was established after Unification — just as the more recent spread of organized crime in the South is inexplicable without the connivance of political parties and forces. More generally, Italian governments and the Italian political systems — from the tariffs of 1889, to the entry to the European War in 1915, to the revaluation of the Lira in 1927, to Mussolini&rsquo;s policy of economic autarky, and the debasement of the program for special investment in the South after 1950 into a gold mine of political clientism — have failed to take account of the particular economic and social needs and interests of the South. The new southern history therefore contains important messages for those in Northern Italy who in recent years who have been retailing the old stereotypes and the old untruths about the &ldquo;Southern Problem&rdquo;.</p>

<p>A shorter version of this essay was published as &ldquo;Changing Perspectives on Italy&rsquo;s &lsquo;Southern Problem&rsquo;&rdquo; in C. Levy, <em>Italian Regionalism; History, Identity and Politics</em>, Oxford: Berg, 1996.</p>

<p>No brief survey can do justice to the range, breadth, and deeply innovative character of the research that has set out to reformulate and re-address the central themes in the historical development of the South from the end of the <em>Ancien Régime</em> to the present. The new agenda has been driven forward by energetic groups of young historians at the Universities of Naples, Bari, and Catania, and developed through a series of major publishing ventures - notably the Einaudi series, <em>Storia delle Regioni</em>, which includes volumes on Calabria, Campania, Sicily, and Apulia (see Aymard and Giarrizzo 1987; Bevilacqua and Plancanica 1985; Masella and Salvemini 1990); journals such as <em>Studi Storici</em> and <em>Quaderni Storici</em> (with particular reference to recent research on the bourgeoisie); and to the new journal, <em>Meridiana</em>, which is devoted exclusively to exploring &ldquo;southern&rdquo; issues. Together with IMES, <em>Meridiana</em> has provided the principal forum for reformulating and programming research on the South from the early nineteenth century to the present. The &ldquo;revisionist&rdquo; agenda on the South has also been directed at an earlier period (see Marino 1988 and Astarita 1992 for important reconsiderations on the character of southern &quot; feudalism&quot;).</p>
