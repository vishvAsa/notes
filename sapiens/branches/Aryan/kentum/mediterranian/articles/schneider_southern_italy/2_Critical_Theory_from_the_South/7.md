How Critical Was De Martino's "Critical Ethnocentrism" in Southern Italy?

*Annalisa Di Nola *

Ernesto de Martino's engagement with Marxism, evident in his works on the South of Italy, by no means exhausted his main interests. Recent critical essays on this important Neapolitan anthropologist have highlighted his concern with the concept of the loss and maintenance of "presence," that is with the possibility of constituting or preserving the "self" in the face of threatening crises \(see Cherchi 1981; Cherchi and Cherchi 1987; Pasquinelli 1984\). His adherence to this theme reflects his greater fascination with the existential philosophy of Heidegger, and with Kant's and Hegel's "critical" perspective, than with a Marxist approach to social research. Nevertheless, de Martino's years of scholarship on Southern Italy influenced Italian cultural anthropology to approach the Southern Question with political commitment. During the period between 1949 and 1962, when French Marxist anthropology was not yet born and the American researchers in the South of Italy were following the path indicated by Robert Redfield \(1941, 1955a, b; see, for example, Banfield 1958; Friedmann 1952\), de Martino showed a genuine interest in the economic and social emancipation of the people he studied. 

Some of his positions are being reinvented even today, thirty years after his death. His originality of thought, however, defies easy classification. While his refusal to take problems of identity for granted places him close to some postmodern anthropologists, his firm objection to a relativistic perspective sets him far apart from them, and, in some respects, anticipates a "post-ethnic" approach \(see Hollinger 1995\). In this chapter, I draw attention to some debatable statements in de Martino's writings where he seems to be building an ethnocentric hierarchy of values and judging his native southern Italian society in a negative way. Considering him to be deeply ambivalent, however, I attempt to counteract this impression by accounting for these passages in the wider context of de Martino's thought. In the second, more philosophically oriented section, I thus examine the author's approach to the problem of magic, in which he utilized concepts of individual identity and objective reality that actually questioned well-established ethnocentric assumptions. I propose that his concept of culture, on which his theoretical system was founded, endowed magic with a pivotal cultural and existential function. Finally, I take up de Martino's concept of "ethnographic humanism" or "critical ethnocentrism" — one of his most original stands, in which a firm rejection of relativism is combined with a deep awareness of the historical determination and the culturally conditioned use of values and categories of judgment. A concluding section discusses the issues confronting de Martino in his more polemical and politically committed writings of the post-Second World War period, coinciding with his first investigations in Southern Italy. This attempt to give a more complete overview of de Martino's thought, to contextualize his most questionable assertions, contrasts with other treatments that consider the "southern works" separately from the rest of his opus, thus obscuring the links between his general philosophical speculation and his concrete ethnographic and historical investigations. 



## Questionable Extrapolations

Let us start by taking a brief look at *Sud e magia*, de Martino's 1959 study of mourning rituals in Lucania. It is stated in the preface of this book that modern civilization was born out of the choice between magic and rationality \(de Martino 1980 \[1959\]: 8-9; 1984 \[1962\]\). Although fascinated throughout his scientific career by the irrational, de Martino warned that submitting to its appeal meant abdicating the principles derived from our own history, in which the confrontation between magic and rationality developed in terms of a radical opposition, the two options presenting themselves as mutually exclusive and incompatible \(1984 \[1962\]: 213\). Moreover, to renounce Western values in favor of a supposed neutral relativism, or of an uncritical celebration of the "primitive" and the "mystic," would be to lose consciousness of the genesis and development of the civilization that made the anthropological endeavour possible \(1984\[1962\]; 1977: 389-413\). And, he believed, an inclination towards the irrational is always apt to conceal a substantial appeal to authoritarian regimes, as demonstrated by the tragic example of post-First World War Germany \(1953; 1957; 1984 \[1962\]: 81-169\). 

In ***Sud*** *e* ***magia***, de Martino defined his subject as the "ethnographic exploration of the survival of the most gross practices of ceremonial magic in Lucania, aimed at determining, for one of the most backward areas of the South, the structure of magic techniques, their psychological function, and the existential regime that favours their persistence" \(1980 \[1959\]: 9\).1 The preface to ***Morte*** *e* ***pianto rituale*** publically thanked 

all those peasant women from Lucania who willingly ... renewed, in front of others . . . the ritual mourning of their own dead; they themselves being instruments of an incomprehensible science, to which however they were paying a tribute of pain. For these poor women who live in squalid villages ... we could not separate our thanks from the warm wish that, if not they, then at least their daughters and granddaughters . .. might elevate themselves to that higher practice of mourning discipline that forms a sizeable part of the economic, social, political and cultural emancipation of our Mezzogiorno \(1975 \[1958\]: ix\). 

These statements evoke a modernization approach to the southern Italian peasantry, whose magic practices and mourning rituals are presented as doomed to disappear once a higher standard of living and a more evolved cultural pattern are adopted,2 De Martino's use of the term "survival" betrays his assumption that all the "gross" practices and beliefs that interested him had lost the integral meaning they once possessed in their original context. Although still functional in dealing with hardships, they were no longer seen by the author as embedded in a wider texture of relationships and activities in which new meanings might develop. The extent of their persistence, moreover, said something about the kind of energy that was deployed against them. "Even today," de Martino wrote, when 

the ancient seasonal crying is reduced to pale folkloric reflections, the funereal lament is still practiced in the countryside of sizeable areas of the European continent: and although it is restricted almost everywhere to the peasants and it has obviously lost the breadth and complexity of pagan mythic horizons . . . something of its ancient tragic seriousness still persists ... This limit to the expansion of Christian customs undoubtedly poses a problem. One is tempted to say .. that Christianity had the power to remold custom ... in the higher strata of civil society, drawing the courts, the nobility, the lords, the wealthy urban bourgeoisie away from the pagan practice of crying for the dead, but that it could not deploy an equivalent molding energy in the countryside, where decisive progress took place not so much because of the uninterrupted civilizing action of the Church, as because of the bourgeois revolution and with it the development of the industrial age and corresponding civil progress ... If in fact we tried to build a diachronic map of the progressive disappearance of laments among European peasants, we would see how the first to lose them were the countries and the regions that entered earlier within the orbit of the industrial revolution and of the development of an entrepreneurial urban bourgeoisie, whereas the last were those countries and regions that persisted longer in their social structure of precapitalist and semifeudal relations \(1975\[ 1958\]: 354\). 

De Martino's views of folklore as represented by survivals that have lost their original coherence, and of the Church and the bourgeoisie as "civilizing agents," are reflected in the criteria he adopted in selecting sample villages for his Lucania study: namely, their extent of traditionalism or backwardness, their isolation or geographic distribution \(1975\[1958\]: 74\). Here he shared company with other European research traditions, for example the Finnish and other schools of folklore and linguistics \(see Aarne 1928; Battoli 1945; Bertoni 1925; Krohn 1926; Menendez Pidal 1920; Santoli 1940\). Did he accept the conclusion, however, that isolation preserved the supposed purity and original essence of customs, which were progressively contaminated by more frequent culture contact? I do not think this captures the complex and relational way he thought about magic and, indeed, about the Southern Italian peasantry. 



## The Problem of Magic

We remain perhaps disconcerted by the way the problem of magic is posed in *Sud e magia*, but the author had already coped with it in *Il mondo magico* \(1973 \[1948\]\),3 a book that fundamentally challenged the established sense of security and stability in Western civilization, questioning what is meant by reality. Our perception of nature as an entity in itself, de Martino argued, is not a given but a historical development, in so far as science grew out of an increasing withdrawal of the projections of subjects from the objects of their research. But precisely the instruments provided by a scientific approach to natural phenomena are thoroughly inadequate when it comes to the magical world, where we encounter a reality completely interwoven with such projections \(1973\[1948\]: 66-87, 155—62\). Especially in the so-called primitive world, where a series of natural and structural circumstances render life extremely precarious and threatening, the individual is in constant danger of losing his or her "presence," that is her or his ability to be an active agent in history. In a world where "being-here" is not decided and guaranteed once and for all, one is always in the process of constituting and maintaining oneself as such, while the world itself, far from being an objective external given, cannot be thoroughly separated from the drama of the person but is, rather, entangled with it. In the context thus outlined, magic is not 

an obstacle to intelligence, to moral progress . . . The dominating interest of the magical world is ... constituted ... by the conquest and the reinforcement of the elementary "being-here," or "presence," of the person. Now we know that the ideology, praxis, and institutions of the magical world reveal their true meaning only \[in relation to\] defending, mastering, regulating the tenuous "being-here" of the person ... As long as we persist in judging the magical world within traditional categories, we will conceal from our own eyes its characteristic drama ... We shall deem it to have no drama, only negativity to which no history can be given \(1973\[1948\]: 192 3\). 

In other words, under specific historic circumstances the Self is not a given but must fight tenaciously to establish a presence; and, by the same token, nature is not the specific objective entity well known to experimental scientists, but, rather, a culturally conditioned realm, dense with human projections. The fundamental dimension introduced by our author is a historical one, individuating a drama, a process of precarious establishment, where others had seen a plain assumption, a basic point of departure. Indeed, part of the scandal aroused by *Il mondo magico* when it first appeared was its extreme interpretation of Croce's historicism. For Croce, history developed within a clearly defined system constituted by the four eternal forms of the Spirit \(Croce 1902, 1913, 1962\). In questioning the eternal existence of these categories, de Martino, his student, seemed closer to Hegel who, in *The Phenomenology of Mind* \(1973\), had introduced a temporal dimension into the idealistic philosophy of the Spirit. Like Hegel's Spirit or Self, but unlike Croce's, the "presence" of de Martino had a beginning in time. We also see Heidegger's \(1969\) undeniable influence on de Martino's theory, with the difference that the philosopher's Being-here, rather than revealing the limits and finitude of a mundane existence, is interpreted as a safety valve for the individual, standing as a protective guarantee against a rather frightening loss of borders \(de Martino 1973 \[1948\]: 190\). 

In distinguishing magic from the psychopathological outcomes of crises of the "presence," de Martino points out that magic is not only provoked by moments of crisis, but also, and mostly, by the reaction to crisis — by the ransom and redemption that magical institutions exact and provide as they appeal to a long-established and well-consolidated tradition of symbols and meanings. Thoroughly different from the private alienating symbolism displayed in psychopathologies, this ascending process is able to master oncoming crises suffered by individuals or whole groups, under circumstances of particular stress for the "presence" \(1973 \[1948\]: 177-85; 1975\[1958\]: 24-43; 1957\). 

Magic is hence endowed with a very important role in de Martino's view: namely the task of reconstituting and consolidating the jeopardized "presence." It achieves its goal by enacting all its power of molding and reorganization *vis-à-vis* the chaos that could arise out of a precarious situation. When the "presence" threatens to collapse and confuse itself with a particular object or an aspect of it, to slide into a situation of mere biological passivity,4 magic intervenes, translating that passivity into an activity, reintroducing the shaping power of culture. Magic is actually the *only* effective cultural performance allowed under such conditions. 

In his later works de Martino specified better the technique adopted: cultural institutions operate through a process of de-historicization \(1953—1954; 1957; 1959; 1962; 1977; see Massenzio 1985, 1986\) that temporarily conceals the tension and the serious harmfulness of an unbearable historic or natural situation, submerging its negative implications in an atemporal and repetitive realm where everything is mastered and under control by means of known and meaningful procedures. In a subsequent phase, persons and objects are reintegrated in the normal course of events, the risk of a paralysing collapse having been overcome. Such is the way that ritual, ceremonies, symbolism, and culture in general function. Culture is action — doing, forging, attributing shape and meaning to the flux of life, creating value out of what passes away despite or against us, in a way that "we risk passing with what passes" \(De Martino 1975 \[1958\]: 18\). 

The perspective adopted by de Martino was inspired by Kant's criticism. Kant entrusted the possibility of a relation between object and subject to the supreme principle of the "transcendental unity of self-consciousness," a formal function able to synthesize singular elements within a totality. Although questioning their eternal givenness, de Martino attributed to the "presence", and to culture in general, those same formal, synthesizing, objectifying functions \(Kant 1966; de Martino 1973 \[1948\]: 185-9\). 



## Critical Ethnocentrism

It is this basic theory of culture connected to the role of the "presence" that de Martino develops in his last, posthumous work, in which he theorizes the "ethos" of "transcending life through intersubjective valorization" \(1977: 667-84; see also 430-40\). This "valorizing" impetus allows us to go beyond the immediacy of biological life, to transcend it through the values of community projects, historically deployed in multiple cultural forms. At stake is a discourse on the essence of humankind — analogous to arguments in Marxism on man and nature — in which the so-called "ethos of transcending" is the principle which distinguishes the human and cultural from the merely natural. Things existing *per se* are not conceivable, nor is a world of spiritual values that are not embedded in the everyday activity of transforming nature. Shared effort and use over generations constitute a reassuring and meaningful background, more or less identifiable with the anonymous and the habitual, yet leaving room for change precisely through the force of its characteristics: 

... the given, the habitual and the obvious character of the world are possible in so far as they are faithful to the initiatives of past generations, to our own past and what is connected to it through our cultural biography ... Only through this anonymous domesticity of the world is it possible \[for the single person to make\] original, singularized choices ... to "restart" some aspect of the world — and he always starts it over as if he were the first.. . This is only possible if all the other aspects function momentarily as background, and if this background includes an implicit human meaning, a work of humanization developed in the obvious domesticity of the environment \(1977: 648\). 

It is difficult to understand the wider meaning of de Martino's work on Southern Italy unless we also take into account his conviction that an integral humanism5 should inform relationships between individuals and wider human groups. From his lay humanistic perspective, the world has a human origin and destination, not a divine one; moreover, all its inhabitants strive for equal participation in cultural institutions \(1976 \[1961\]: 21\). There is, in other words, a specific "ethos of transcending" which is common to humankind in its entirety, regardless of the different ways and means by which different peoples or ethnic groups actualize their intersubjective valorization of life. Our awareness of this commonality, however, was only rendered possible as a result of the specific historical development of Western civilization. In this respect, although only in this respect, de Martino assigned supremacy to this civilization; it alone could produce the ethnographic endeavour. 

In the perspective of a "critical ethnocentrism," the western \(or westernized\) ethnologist assumes the history of his own culture as a unit by which to measure alien cultural histories, but... in the act of measuring, gains consciousness of the historic prison and of the limits of his own system, and opens himself up to the task of reforming the categories of observation he has available at the start of his research \(1977: 396-7\). 

In other words, de Martino is not talking about a superiority of Western values in absolute terms. His claim is that the Western ethnologist cannot avoid taking a stand, making value judgments, partaking in the culture he has grown up in, as it is the only one which poses the conditions for a dialogue among different cultures within the context of the anthropological discipline. In the impossible attempt to assume a neutral stand, the Western observer inevitably and acritically projects his or her own categories on the object of study. It is, however, a critical and controlled use of those categories that de Martino promotes; a constantly tested use, involving a systematic confrontation with other cultures and a parallel questioning of the respective histories in which different cultural categories are embedded \(see 1977: 389-97; 1984\[1962\]: 5-13, 58, 73, 283-7\). 

Between de Martino's philosophy of the "presence" and his epistemologica\! stance of "critical ethnocentrism," he was far from viewing subaltern culture as intrinsically backward or stubbornly involved in an irrational and inferior value system, notwithstanding some of the passages from *Sud e magia* with which we began. Nor did he posit that cultural contact and technology transfer would cause an automatic, unidirectional change in the less developed term of comparison. It is rather a matter of reciprocal transformation, in which the supposedly more advanced civilization is challenged by the other to test its own viability and dogmatic assumptions. In the ensuing dialog, both draw upon the same "ethos of transcending," sharing equally in the dignity of culture. Both experience the same need of the "presence" to create, shape, and transform mere biological vitality into culture, overcoming the always incumbent risk of not "being-here," not acting in history. In this sense, magic is not an inferior cultural outcome with regard to Western rational attitudes and cultural products; it is instead another example of the demiurgic power of culture — a valuable effort to counteract the supreme loss threatening the very possibility of human existence. 



## A History of the Subaltern World

In the wake of the Second World War, the associated crisis of Western bourgeois society, and the eruption of liberation movements in the colonial world, de Martino resumed his critique of what he called the naturalist trend of anthropology, evident in both evolutionism and functionalism \(1949\). Apprehending the primitive \(and by analogy the lower classes of complex societies\) as natural people, as things or objects rather than historical subjects, these pseudo-scientific modes of classifying and describing coincided for him with the exploitation of the people studied. It was time, he declared, to historicize these subalterns, to widen our humanism by way of letting their world into history. Precisely in this context, de Martino turned to the subalterns of Southern Italy, challenging Croce's influential ethical-political history of the region, which was a history of its ruling classes and political leaders. 

Only later as a militant of the working class in the Mezzogiorno of Italy did I realize that the naturalism of traditional ethnology was linked to the very character of bourgeois society, that between the condition of existence of, for example, the day laborers in Murge and the historiographical inertia of ethnological writings there was an organic connection, and that my theoretical interest to know the primitive was born at once with my practical interest in participating in his real liberation \(1949: 433\). 

In other words, despite the rhetorical or patronizing inflections in some of de Martino's writing, we must note the political and intellectual commitment of the author, for whom Gramsci's model of the organic intellectual, blending theory and practice, was an inspiration. The educational and technological advancement of marginal areas foreseen by Modernization theorists were a far cry from de Martino's goals. These theorists defined traditionalism as the main obstacle to development in the Mezzogiorno, but de Martino was instead interested in peasants' struggles for land reform, in their serious attempt at emancipation, in their desire to break what he, following Gramsci, understood as the key relation: dominant-dominated \(not modern-traditional\). His use, at least on an ideological level, of the concept of class, as well as his attention to power and domination among different strata of society, also marked his distance from the kind of ideological Manicheism implicit in Modernization theory. Insisting on a dialectical relationship between hegemonic and subaltern groups in the social reality of the South, he avoided, finally, the temptation to account for this reality in isolation. 

Between the mid-1940s and the early 1950s, the intellectual and political debate surrounding Southern Italy intensified. Several revolts and land occupations occurred, provoking government repression. What began as enthusiasm on the part of the Left-wing parties gave way to disillusionment as they experienced political defeat. In the meantime, a number of applied and community studies were carried out, mainly by American sociologists and anthropologists, but also by Italian social workers and agrarian economists, which advocated the economic reform of the Mezzogiorno through capitalist industrial development. Framing this orientation was the reconstruction of the Italian state after the war and the move on the part of the United States government to shore up the position of national bourgeoi s élites by, among other things, making a substantial investment in programs set up to stablize and modernize the South. 

Among the agrarian economists against whom de Martino reacted was Manlio Rossi-Doria \(1948, 1958\), the founder of the University in Portici, who had joined the Partito d'Azione in the 1940s but later drew closer to the Socialists. Rossi-Doria gave up his original theorization of the need for a substantial land reform in favor of a more conservative approach, aimed at reassessing marginal properties. And he conceived of peasant civilization as immobile and resistant to change. By contrast, de Martino's emphasis on the centuries-long interconnection between hegemonic and subaltern levels within a single history, and his Marxist recognition of the necessary alliance between peasants and workers for the transformation of existing social conditions, led him to ignore the work of Rossi-Doria, and many others, for example Guido Dorso and Danilo Dolci. Uninterested in their studies, as well as in the new sociological trend being advanced by the North Americans, he criticized what he called the traditional "economist" approach to the Mezzogiorno for overlooking cultural phenomena. 

Clearly, De Martino's alignment with a Marxist approach was at odds with the dominant social science trajectory of the postwar years, yet it did not spare him from serious criticism on the part of Communist Party intellectuals who, though acknowledging the value of proletarian as against bourgeois culture, could not entertain a concept of culture that also included folklore. Perhaps they were still unfamiliar with Gramsci's as yet unpublished work when they interpreted de Martino's interest in peasant beliefs and rituals as a dangerous romantic flirtation with irrationalism and primitivism. In this respect, it is interesting to note de Martino's position on Carlo Levi, whose *Cristo si è fermato a Eboli* \(1945\) was also an important Left contribution to redefining the Southern Question at the end of the war. De Martino praised Levi for recognizing peasants as the bearers of a cultural tradition, but could not share his poetic view of this tradition as autonomous, isolated, enclosed in a mythic reality outside historical time and inaccessible to comprehension as well as to state intervention or political mobilization by outsiders. 

In this context, we can reconsider de Martino's discussion of folkloric survivals. These materials can become documents of history, he argued, not in their present State or in isolation, but as markers that help reconstruct the religious civilization in which they existed. Sometimes they constitute a living and vital moment, organs of a functioning whole in the fullness of its social and cultural life \(as shown in *Morte e pianto rituale*\); at other times they are documents of a past civilization, indicating episodes of arrest in its process of expansion, mishaps that limited its will of history, forcing it, at least in certain layers of society, to tolerate, compromise, syncretize, abdicate \(*Sud e magia* is exemplary\). In both cases, folkloric religious relics identified by ethnographic inquiry document a single history: that of the religious civilization of which they stand as wrecks, or of the religious civilization in which they survive or endure through a more or less deep remolding. They never indicate a *popular* religious history, opposed to, or parallel and competing with, that of the social and cultural élites. Although de Martino's use of the term ''survival" might suggest otherwise, he is here rather close to the American anthropologist, Eric Wolf, whose ironically titled *Europe and the People Without History* \(1982\) similarly places local culture in history, and to critiques one might advance against ethnohistory as a separate historiographical discipline. 

Gramsci contrasted philosophy and modern science, regarded as elaborated, coherent, and systematic conceptions of the world, with folklore as the implicit, incoherent, fragmentary conception of the subaltern classes \(1975: 2311—17\). Folklore, he held, is the reflection on the cultural level of the economic and political dependency of those classes; it is the servile culture of the politically servile. Reciprocally, the culture of subaltern classes cannot be understood without apprehending their relationships of political and ideological dependency, which, through cultural hegemony, subordinate and limit them. Although influenced by this view, de Martino was also critical of Gramsci's emphasis on anachronistic beliefs as obstacles to the acquisition of a mature self- and class consciousness, as if they were the debris of élite cultural production. Instead, de Martino distinguishes between traditional and progressive folklore, the latter being an outcome of the new struggles and mobilizations of the peasant movement \(see de Martino 1951a, b, 1952, 1954\). Yet he more often concentrated his attention on the traditional variant, neglecting an analysis of the relationships of "folkloric" traits with the social economic setting in which their changing function would become more apparent. 

In a way, de Martino engages in a double battle: on the one hand he objects to the cliché of folklore as an unmodified remnant of a past civilization; on the other hand, he refuses to consider it as the product of an autonomous culture, having its own independent system of values. As a consequence he did not envision folklore in terms of resistance, a step that a number of his followers would take. Nor did he celebrate the folkloric customs he helped to draw public attention to. Although according them the dignity of culture, he used such words as "cultural misery," and "low" magical practices, to talk about crying for the dead, the evil eye, and charms \(*c*. 1975; 1980\[ 1959\]: 10\). This made them akin to psychological misery rather than to a curious, valuable heritage to be safeguarded. In his writing, they often evoke areas of negativity or emptiness that high culture was unable to mold, perhaps for lack of hegemonic energy, or of organic relationships in civil society \(although de Martino did not use this Gramscian expression\). The result is non-autonomy on the part of the person — an awareness of being constantly at risk of dispossession, of being acted upon rather than being able to act and decide, transforming critical situations into values, into culture. At best, magical practices constitute a redemption of the "presence." 

De Martino's position was not without ambivalence, since he did attribute a pivotal cultural role to magic, and insisted upon the specific contribution of subaltern classes to history. Overall, however, he eschewed a naive enthusiasm for the creativity and originality of popular culture, pointing rather to the victimization of the people under study. We can see this in his discourse on hegemony, certainly derived from Gramsci and replete with distinctions between traditional and organic intellectuals, between the roles played by bourgeois ideology on the one hand, and the philosophy of praxis inside the revolutionary party on the other. Philosophy, Common Sense, Religion and Folklore — elements of Gramsci's delicate hierarchy — reciprocally flow into one another, constituting a variety of articulations that cannot easily be brought back to a plain dichotomy between high and low levels of culture. Yet, despite his attention to the different social and historical components of Southern Italian culture, de Martino does not always clearly distinguish among different political and ideological alignments. Thus he can sweepingly blame the hegemonic forces for not having deployed a sufficient degree of molding energy to enable the subaltern classes to participate fully in "culture," as if he were unaware that the criticism betrays a rather overt faith in the value of the "high" Western intellectual tradition, which he would like to see become the shared common property of the whole of humankind. As we have seen, however, this faith grew out of focusing on a specific aspect of élite European culture: namely, its humanistic and historicist lay view.6 

Within the framework of a Gramscian perspective, de Martino's reproach exposes the lack of organic relationships in civil society, the historical detachment of intellectuals from the authentic needs and wishes of the masses, and their alignment instead with the dominant oppressive groups. It is not a matter of sustaining peasants in their philosophy of common sense, but of leading them to a superior conception of life, accelerating the ongoing historical process of transformation while keeping in touch with the conditions of their social world, their needs and aspirations \(Gramsci 1975: 1384-7\). 



## *Sud e Magia*, a Return

As we saw earlier, *Sud e magia* seems to start with a straightforward statement of the long-lasting and victorious battle of rationality against magic, yet the text repeatedly brings to the fore the entangled and interconnected destinies of the hegemonic and the subaltern worlds. First of all there is no room for a separate and opposed view of magic versus religion, as if they were two different stages, hierarchically arranged in the evolution of civilization. The difference between magic and religion is only a matter of degree, not of quality, for de Martino. Magic displays a narrower technical set of instruments to cope with the crises induced by dramatic existential situations. The values it discloses are few and very tightly connected to the particular crisis that needs to be resolved. Religion offers a wider technical apparatus for dealing with the so-called "crisis of the presence," its values being much more inclusive. Any attempt to explain magic on the basis of its particular characteristics is doomed to failure, in so far as it could only be an endless classification, missing the meaning that is embedded in specific historical civilizations \(see 1980\[ 1959\]: 81—92; 1975\[1958\]: 40-3; 1957: 96\). In the case of Lucania, the focus of inquiry thus became the centuries-old intertwining of Catholic and magical ideology in the Italian South, with its many contrasts and compromises over time. De Martino's reconstruction avoids an analysis of the nexus between economic and psychological misery, assuming it to be an obvious premiss. He finds it more rewarding to document the magic in southern Catholicism, with its emphasis on outward appearance and exhibitionism, even within the official liturgy. On the one hand, "low" magic introduces, however "grossly" and superficially, elements of Christianity into its practices, for example through formulae that evoke the name of Christ. On the other hand, some rituals characteristic of popular Catholicism are magically biased even when connected to wider Catholic values \(1980 \[1959\]: 87-91\). 

But de Martino's analysis hints at a broader dimension in attempting to relate this regional situation to the history of élite lay culture in the Mezzogiorno in general. He wants to examine to what extent the cultural milieu of the southern Italian peasantry participated in the general movement of European élite culture away from magic toward rationality. According to him, although the Enlightenment in the eighteenth century reflected the advanced social and economic development of the European bourgeoisie, it did not exhibit the same features among its Neapolitan representatives. In the kingdom of Naples, the bourgeoisie did not have the same strength as its commercial and industrial European counterpart, and the members of enlightened circles appeared therefore much more indulgent of magical religious ritualism in their local version of Catholicism. Their polemical activity was directed, rather, to the confrontation between Church and State in the struggle for political power. This delay negatively conditioned subaltern culture by limiting its access to more fully rational attitudes. 

In *Morte e pianto rituale* \(1975\[1958\]\) de Martino analyses the historical compromise between pagan dramatic mourning and Christian resignation. The symbolic image of Mary's crying is, he suggests, an intermediate formation, established during the Middle Ages and encouraging acceptance of a Christian attitude toward death. Similarly, in *La terra del rimorso* \(1976 \[1961\]\), the mythic and ritual complex represented by *tarantismo* is historically analysed as a stratified formation over time. De Martino sheds light on the historical specificity and differentiation of *tarantismo* in Puglia, and on its autonomy from similar cultural formations in other countries or regions. This autonomy and specificity, however, must be understood in relational terms; they do not indicate a deliberate, countercultural, or oppositional refusal of Christian values. On the contrary: *tarantismo* has always been in touch, at least for the largest portion of its history, with hegemonic culture. The exchange between the uneven levels is here particularly apparent. *Tarantismo* contributed to the development of certain élite intellectual elaborations; at the same time, élite culture was aware of its significance and remarkably influenced its trend. 

According to de Martino, official Catholicism gained an especially conspicuous role in *tarantismo* during the eighteenth century, when it attempted to connect to St Paul and his specific healing power the symbol of the *taranta*, the mythic spider whose behaviour is mimicked in the course of the "pagan" ritual in order to achieve therapeutic effects. This intervention was totally disruptive of the existing folkloric custom, an intrusive hegemonic intervention that disintegrated the subaltern ideological construction. Yet, prior to the eighteenth century there was already a long history of interrelationships between this particular custom and various educated élites' literary and scholarly works \(ranging from the ancient Greek myths and tragedies to the theories of natural magic following the Renaissance, to the speculation on "iatromusic" in the seventeenth century and the medical theories of enlightened Neapolitans in the eighteenth century\). Clearly, *taranta* symbolism owed its liveliness to a process of cultural circulation. When enlightened opinion degraded its essence to the level of an illness, that vital connection was broken and the custom entered into its long decline. 

Again, it is worth remarking that a historically oriented consideration of hegemonic—subaltern relationships implies a number of dimensions and articulations that do not easily fit in a dichotomous, unidirectional evaluation of terms such as "modern" and "backward" or, by analogy, "North" and "South." 

In the end, economic and social conditions, however little they were specifically explored by de Martino, were, for him, the foundation of both the "psychological misery" of subaltern magical practices and the scant advancement in the battle for a rational lay humanistic view on the part of the élite components of Southern Italian society. In the epilogue of *Morte e pianto rituale*, too, the crucial importance of a change in the economic and social conditions of existence for poor Lucanian peasants is very clearly expressed. 

The *ethos* of the "presence" is not a matter of grace coming down from above \(even if it can appear to be so to single individuals\) ... It is attainable to the extent that it is realized in the context of social relationships .. . When this process is limited, the reality of the "presence" is weak. When only the memory of one's own failures is accumulated and one experiences only the irrationality of natural forces and the overwhelming oppression of social forces, every critical moment ... can, given the lack of cultural forces to mobilize, stir up a crisis. The agricultural communities, and particularly the women are still subjected to precapitalist and semifeudal relations. That is why the mourning crisis takes such excessive forms, and why the techniques of lamentation are still maintained. A transformation approached exclusively on the level of religious or "moral" preaching is therefore doomed to have here a limited effectiveness \( 1975\[1958\]: 358\). 

This passage represents, as we can see, one more description of the loss of the "presence" and of the conditions that would render its retrieval more likely. But the mode of production is crucial in determining the precariousness of a specific existential situation and the connected deployment of a particular cultural form, able to cope with that situation. Nor is this the only place where de Martino offers an explanation of his theory of the economic as the inaugural level of the detachment of Culture from Nature, and of the economy's pivotal role in the frequency and seriousness of crises.7 It is in any case a straightforward attempt to relate cultural forms to a mode of production, and to warn against easy remedies for poverty or backwardness, remedies such as the education or knowledge transmission so dear to Modernization theory. It is clearly implied that an effective transformation must also involve the structural level. 



## Conclusions

In rereading the quotations transcribed in the first pages of this essay, we can notice that what de Martino is calling for is not just a generic movement from traditional to advanced, but rather the transformation of an existential regime. What he has in mind is not so much the adoption of more modern habits as the economic, social, political, and cultural emancipation of the Mezzogiorno, according to a militant Marxist perspective. Taking into account the wider effectiveness of the industrial revolution and the educational intervention of the Church in the transformation of particular customs implies a clear notion of the embeddedness of such customs in the context of precise forces and relations of production. We can recall that de Martino's whole theorization of folklore cannot support an easy dismissal of anachronistic practices in terms of unworthy relics, but rather valorizes them as documents of history and culture. We saw that his opinions on magic show a thicker complexity than it could appear at first sight. His often declared adherence to a lay perspective, and his analysis of the absence of a qualitative difference between magic and religion, reassure us that he was not interested in celebrating the triumph of Christianity, regarded as a more evolved form of religion, even if some of the passages in *Morte e pianto rituale* might lead us to believe so. 

On closer examination, the hegemony of the more advanced level was at the root of precisely that marginality that the Southern Problem used to highlight, for it acted too often to hinder a sound and up-to-date process of economic, social, and cultural development. But in any case that contact, that intertwining of destinies between the unequal levels, is not a recent outcome of modernity. It has a long, forgotten history. What is new, possibly, is the shape that such a contact could assume in contemporary society under the changed circumstances of international relationships of power. 

De Martino is much more explicit and detailed when discussing his theory of the loss of the "presence" than in dealing with problems of social and economic development. Indeed, focusing mainly on cultural phenomena during his "southern period," he attacked the mounting repertoire of statistical "meridionalist" studies for their "economism." In effect, he never resolved the contradiction between his scholarly interest in the preservation of the phenomena under observation, and his political commitment to the value of transforming an unjust and oppressive social reality. 

In *La terra del rimorso*, a more detached attitude toward problems of intervention led him to emphasize the importance of knowledge and consciousness as a basic stage in the formation of a new Southern awareness and reality, assigning priority to reason in the best tradition of Western thought: 

Tarantismo will no doubt die "on its own" within a short time. But precisely the inertia of that "on its own" is unhealthy and deadly, because the internal law of Culture is to bring about the death of the past through the lively light of consciousness and reason. Too many things in our South die "on their own", without consciousness and reason deriving any operative merit out of it, and too many instead survive without consciousness and reason, without realizing their sharp contradictions in terms of transformation. Someone could remark that tarantismo is too minute and local a fact to stimulate such a process. But it appears "minute" and " local" only because our indifference renders it irrelevant \[. . .\] Pagan tarantismo, its insertion into St. Paul's cult, the break up of musical exorcism, the sick character of the chapel performances and the limits of traditional medical interpretation are today reflected in a system of inertia, intolerance, unrealized contradictions, tolerated incompatibilities. But in this chaos which is given the romantic name of "folklore", and which, at least in this case, is actually impeding history and humiliating nature, it is the task of consciousness and reason to reestablish the transforming process armed with historical knowledge \(1976\[1961\]: 381\).

## Notes

1. In this and the following quotations, I have translated loosely from the original. 

2. For a general critical overview of "modernization theory," see Appleby 1978; Nash 1981; and Tipps 1973. 

3. This work is also available in an \(abridged\) English edition \(de Martino 1988\). 

4. The most extensive explanation of the meaning and function of the presence is offered in the first chapter of de Martino 1975 \[1958\]. 

5. The expression "integral humanism" is actually a term I am using for convenience, in order to cover more themes contained in de Martino's thought. He talks about an enlargement of Western civilization's self-consciousness aimed at creating a wider humanism \(1973\[1948\]: 13\). He polemically refers to the circumscribed and limited humanism of traditional culture \[i.e. élite culture\] \(1949; 1950; 1976 \[1961\]: 21\). He maintains the methodological need "to resolve entirely into human reasons those that in the religious experience appeared as numinous reasons" \(1957: 90\). He outlines it as the task of an ethnographic humanism to accomplish "the unity of what is human" in the ethnographic encounter that questions one's own culture, confronting it with alien ones \(1977: 389-413\). On these topics see also, in English, Saunders 1993: 875-93. 

6. See above p. 162—3. 

7. For his complex view of the relationships between the economic, productive level and what he later called the "ethos of transcending" see de Martino 1953; 1957; 1977: 423-39,450-1, 649-70. Following his revision of the theory first expressed in *Il mondo magico* he recognizes the possibility of the crisis of the "presence" as a constant risk of human civilization, which is however much more threatening when the dependence on natural conditions of existence is greater. This dependence is determined by the rudimentary level of technical means, by their destructive employment, or by exploitative social relationships, implying i.e. forms of domination. It is this oppresive economic and social situation, connected to forms of dominated consciousness — not a supposedly intrinsic stubborness and passiviity of the superstitious peasantry — that calls for a transformation, opening the way to a more complete enjoyment of cultural, not only of material, goods.
