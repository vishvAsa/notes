The Souths of Antonio Gramsci and the Concept of Hegemony

*Nadia Urbinati *



## Preliminary Remarks

The Southern Question was born along with the unity of Italy, out of an awareness of the limits of unity itself and a disillusionment with the leading class that had made it possible. These sentiments were shared by all the *meridionalisti*, conservative, liberal, and democratic alike \(P. Villari 1868; Franchetti 1911; Caizzi 1950; Salvadori 1976\). Already in 1861, in "letters" to the Milanese magazine *La perseveranza* on brigandage, the mafia, and the poverty of the southern peasants, Pasquale Villari employed the notion of the *questione meridionale* to denote the "social" and "political" problems of the South. Villari denounced the selfishness of the largerly northern "bourgeoisie," which, because of its inability to govern, had become brutal and repressive, like a colonizing force, *vis-à-vis* the South. For him, the southern problem was unquestionably related to the way in which the political unification of the country was implemented, as an "occupation" of both the local and the central government by the moderate liberals of the North \(P. Villari 1878: 147\).1 A few years later another "conservative", Sidney Sonnino, declared that for southerners Italy meant nothing but repression, high taxes, and arrogant public officials \(Sonnino 1972: 155—61\). Subsequently to Unification, in the 1880s and 1890s, the Italian government legislated a tariff policy protecting northern industries \(primarily steel and textiles\) and southern wheat from foreign competition. Both northern industrialists and southern landowners supported this policy, their alliance around it constituting what is sometimes called a "historic bloc". Because the first generation of conservative *meridionalisti* distrusted the free market and liberal international exchange, they had no critique of this policy, and did not attribute the South's misery to it \(Urbinati 1990: 109-47\). At the turn of the century, Antonio De Viti De Marco and Francesco Saverio Nitti identified the tariff policy as the tool the North had used to industrialize at the expense of the South \(Caizzi 1950: 225-34; Nitti 1987: 13-15\). 

The first to draw a democratic conclusion from this libertarian critique was Gaetano Salvemini, who suggested that the "subaltern classes" of the South would win emancipation only in alliance with the working class of the North. By adopting a new perspective, which was no longer moralistic but primarily political, Salvemini defined the *questione meridionale* as a national question: the South needed not simply politicians of good will and a new policy, but a new national political subject. The emancipation of the South required the democratic emancipation of the whole nation \(Salvemini 1963: 71—89\).2 

Salvemini proposed federalism, universal suffrage, and an end to protectionism. These suggestions provoked one of the most important schisms within the Socialist Party \(to which Salvemini belonged\), whose leaders were devoted to statism and felt indifferent \(even "hostile"\) to the extension of political rights to southern "barbarians." Salvemini left the party because of the "oligarchic deviation" and "corporate selfishness" of its Northern-oriented ideology \(Caizzi 1950: 327—36; Davidson 1977: 54\). The difference between the Socialists and Salvemini was essentially cultural. The Socialist Party was devoted to an "economistic" interpretation of Marxism and a fatalistic reading of the socialist transformation. The party regarded the working class as the only legitimate subject and socialism as a natural and evolutionary process, requiring neither a political strategy nor a cultural shift. 

The battle over the interpretation of the Southern Question mirrored the tension between idealism and positivism that animated Italian culture during the first decades of the century \(Croce 1929: 238—9; Garin 1955: 20-30; Bobbio 1986: 27—38\). Idealism and positivism grew out of opposite visions of life and inspired divergent political attitudes. As Antonio Gramsci wrote in 1918, for the positivists, society was "a natural organism" ruled by fixed laws, so that human will played no role in political transformation. For the idealist Marxists, on the contrary, *being* and *knowledge* were "unified," so that social emancipation was an entirely human project to be undertaken by a tenacious rational will aiming at conscious control of sordid necessity \(1994: 77—8\). 

It was within this atmosphere of ideological tension that Gramsci developed his political thought and his understanding of the Southern Question. Siding with the idealists against the positivists, and with Salvemini against the socialists, he developed his *meridionalist* perspective within this theoretical framework, remaining consistently idealist over the years \(Garin 1974: 302-9\). The Southern Question was for the Sardinian Gramsci a national question in so far as it was a question of political and cultural hegemony. Its solution required the construction of a new relationship between the intellectuals and the "people-nation," between consciousness and being. 

Analysis of Gramsci's controversial notion of hegemony, and of the even more controversial interpretations attempted by scholars since the publication of Gramsci's *Notebooks*, is beyond the scope of this chapter. It is difficult, however, to avoid the temptation to trace the "troubles" in Gramsci's thought to his idealism and the resulting idea of a *positive* liberty \(Femia 1981\). The idealist notion of the unity of consciousness and being has different implications, depending on whether it is employed as a nonnative argument for social criticism or a normative imperative for social construction. On the one hand, this notion undoubtedly has strong emancipatory significance because it allows us to criticize human subordination to external authority, and to denounce a social and political order based on physical *coercion* instead of free *consensus*. Gramsci's call for individual autonomy and recognition of the equal moral dignity of all human beings rests on this premiss. "A Communist is someone who acknowledges himself to be weaker physically but not inferior intellectually and spiritually; his body may be imprisoned, but not his mind ... what makes man is the spirit of liberty and revolt" \(Germino 1990: 128\). On the other hand, the notion of the unity of consciousness and being entails a society that, in order to solve the conflict between coercion and consent, encourages a harmonious order in which the individual mind adheres to the collective mind perfectly and totally \(Sbarberi 1986\). As Gramsci wrote in the *Notebooks*, in the society of the future, "the single individual is self-governing, without his self-governing coming into conflict with political society - but rather becoming its normal continuation, its organic complement" \(1971: 268\). 

For the idealist philosopher, however, the critical and the constructive moments are logically related, and the work of emancipation does not end with social criticism. For this reason, some scholars have wondered whether the failure of Gramsci's political project did not in fact save it from its own likely bad consequences - although Gramsci's vision of the society of the future was anything but systematic. Indeed, it is hard to describe as totalitarian a model in which political society and civil society remain separate and in which, moreover, civil society is "complex and well-articulated" \(1971: 268\).3 

Gramsci's reflections on the Southern Question confirm the many-sidedness of his political thought, widening the distance between his social criticism and his constructivist ambitions. For him the South was the home of a stubborn necessity, against which the idealist notion of cultural and moral emancipation showed all its powerful critical implications. We might conclude that Gramsci's own southerness worked as a corrective to the comprehensive and unitary character of his hegemonic ideal. In this chapter, I wish to stress that for Gramsci the Southern Question was a national question, in so far as it was a question of lack of *communication* both among the social classes of the South and between the North and the South. Thus, the Southern Question was a cultural problem, whose solution would be the conquest of individual moral autonomy by Southerners and Northerners alike, and it was a political question, whose solution would be a democratic transformation of both society and the State. 



## The Souths of Gramsci

Gramsci's *Mezzogiorni* were many, and many were the strategies he adopted in the tumultuous decades preceding and following the First World War \(Giarrizzo 1977: 321—89\). His first *Mezzogiorno*, highlighting the desire for autonomy, arose during the elections of 1913, when Gramsci 'discovered' Croce, De Viti De Marco, and Salvemini and became an assiduous reader of *La Voce* and *l'Unità*,4 Like these second-generation *meridionalisti*, he embraced a policy of radical opposition to the ruling "bloc" of northern industrialists andhern agrarians — the bloc that had legislated the protectionist policy noted above.5 A free-market strategy, De Vito De Marco had written, could strengthen the political alliance between southern peasants and northern proletarians, because both had the same enemy. The campaign against protectionism was perceived by the *meridionalisti* as the first southern-inspired example of a sincere non-localist policy aimed at national integration \(Caizzi 1950: 217-24\). 

Then came the *Mezzogiorno* of the period of the war, when Gramsci began to see the relevance of the "organization" for political action. Like many of his generation, Gramsci thought that the war would create what the rural economy could not: a collective psychology and a sense of national and class belonging. Two cultural phenomena were produced **by** the war: first, middle-class intellectuals discovered the existence of a nation very different from their rhetorical construction, a poor and illiterate nation with no sense of belonging politically to the Italian state.6 Second, the suffering and fear in the trenches equalized soldiers of different classes by imposing great sacrifices and discipline. In 1918, Gramsci wrote that, thanks to the war, a *mass* of "disorganized individuals" totally "removed from collective activity of any kind" had the chance to become a *people* \(1958: 181\). The Bolshevik revolution seemed to confirm his analysis: the war created a potentially revolutionary class by making soldiers out of peasants. According to Gramsci, the conditions in Italy and Russia "were not and are not very different" \(1954: 25\). Soon, however, the rise of fascism, the Popular Party's penetration of the South, and the Soviet revolution's problems in rural areas dampened his optimism \(Salvadori 1970: 78\).7 Now the countiyside seemed to loom like a terrible menace against the city, its culture of modernity, its industrialism, and the very possibility of the socialist revolution. The peasant, wrote Gramsci in 1920, feels "his powerlessness, his solitude, his desperate condition, and becomes a *brigand*, not a revolutionary, he becomes an assassin of the *signori*, not a fighter for communism" \(1954: 317\). In other words, party ideology, political alliances and a few years of war were not enough to impel the peasants to develop a class consciousness. 

In the light of these crucial events, Gramsci came to realize that the revolutionary party, the Communists, had to replace the strategy of *force* with that of *consent*, turning their attention to the role to be played, even among peasants, by intellectuals. Unfortunately, the Communists of Turin "had undervalued the problems of the South like the socialists" before them, because they had treated the peasants as mere subordinate allies of the workers \(Togliatti 1967: 205\).8 "Personally, I think," wrote Gramsci in 1923, "that the slogan 'Workers' and Peasants' Government' should be adapted in Italy as follows: 'Federal Republic of Workers and Peasants'" \(1978: 162\). 

More than anything, the rise of fascism confirmed yet again the existence of a gap between the rhetoric of national unity and the real "moral and intellectual" condition of the nation. Gramsci's *Alcuni temi della quistione meridionale* \(1926\) ends with a fresco of the "great social disintegration" \(*disgregazione*\) of the South and with a splendid portrait of Piero Gobetti and Guido Dorso, two examples of the new kind of intellectual whom he envisioned.9 Gobetti was not a Marxist, but he saw the proletariat as a legitimate political subject of the liberal struggle, and thus he encouraged an encounter between liberals and Marxists, and between the South \(represented by Benedetto Croce\) and the North \(represented by *L'Ordine Nuovo*\). The task, concluded Gramsci, was to foster the growth of an entirely new class of intellectuals like Gobetti and Dorso, able to take advantage of an even more "critical" situation and promote a new balance among social forces. It would be a long project made up of little "molecular" transformations rather than sudden, wholesale changes. "Intellectuals develop slowly, far more slowly than any other social group" \(1983: 50\). 

Contrasting the strategies *of force* and *consent*, Gramsci linked them to two different political goals: the construction of a new State, and the transformation of an existing State. The comparison between Machiavelli and Bodin in the *Notebooks* expressed very well the rationale for his hegemonic project of transformation. Unlike Machiavelli, Bodin aimed not to construct a territorial State but to "balance the conflicting social forces" within the existing State. Whereas Machiavelli's emphasis was on the "moment of force," Bodin was interested in the "moment of consent" \(1971: 142\). Gramsci saw their difference as analogous to the difference between the leaders of the Risorgimento and his own vision. 



## A New Risorgimento

Gramsci read the hegemonic failure of the Risorgimento as a failure of its intellectuals, who had been unable to transform the dominion of force into political and cultural consent. Both the losers and the winners had failed. The democrats had failed because of their jacobinism and their unpragmatic, sentimental humanitarianism. Like Machiavelli, Carlo Cattaneo thought social unity could be achieved simply by mobilizing a national army; Giuseppe Mazzini, who understood what a great mistake it was to confuse "cultural unity with political and territorial unity," reduced the ideological task to nothing more than some "aphorisms" and "empty talk" \(1992: 139, 152\). To promote the "moral and intellectual unity" of the country required a *Weltanschauung* — in both its theoretical and its popular form — not vague moral preaching. 

Totally misunderstanding the intellectual task, the Risorgimento democrats had failed to perceive the need to implement an agrarian reform in the South, ignoring the strategic importance of winning the consent of the masses. The liberal moderates, who at least had a cultural strategy, failed in their hegemonic project because they mistrusted the masses. Accustomed to hierarchical relations, they treated Italians the way the generals of a pre-Napoleonic army treated their soldiers.10 "The army is also an 'instrument' for a particular end, but it is made up of thinking men and not of robots who can be utilized to the limits of their mechanical and physical cohesion" \(1971: 88\). Piedmontese liberals who led the Risorgimento shared primary responsibility for the failure of a liberal hegemony because they had set themselves up as both intellectuals and politicians. "They said they were aiming at the creation of a modern State in Italy, and they in fact produced a bastard. They aimed at stimulating the formation of an extensive and energetic ruling class, and they did not succeed; at integrating the people into the framework of the new State, and they did not succeed" \(1971: 90\). 

As the leaders of an earlier generation of *meridionalisti* had understood, building a liberal government necessitated the formation of public opinion. Once this project failed, the leading class was left with no instruments other than force and bureaucracy to impose a political order in the South. The vacuum left by the absence of a conservative party was filled by a demagogic nationalism that worsened "social disintegration" and made it easier for fascism to take root. 

Gramsci's project began where liberal hegemony left off: with the goal of incorporating the South into the nation State.11 But precisely because Gramsci did not consider the South to be a local problem, his *meridione* should be read as a category representing the entire nation — the "Italian people \[who\] did not exist as a concrete ideal, as active organization," that nation that existed simply as a figure of speech used by the rulers to manipulate popular sentiment and justify their oppressive policies. Like the South, the whole of Italian society was made up of an "enormous mass of individuals who were disorganized in all senses, innocent of the great evil and the little good that happened around them, indifferent to every ideal, estranged from every collective activity, and who refused every responsibility because they were removed from every enterprise" \(1958: 181\). 

Gramsci's interpretation of the Southern Question as a question of national unity recalled Marx's approach to the Jewish question: as long as the nation State remained the State of the northern-centred agrarian-industrial bloc, and as long as the South remained a "great social disintegration," they were "equally incapable, the one of conferring emancipation, the other of receiving it" \(Marx and Engels 1978: 27\). Indeed, in relation to the South, the Italian State could only adopt the attitude of a northern state, permitting the South to isolate itself from the whole and foster its corporate sentiments and interests. The emancipation of the South could only be its emancipation from itself, which would mean the emancipation of the entire nation.12 This goal was the ideal that shaped Gramsci's research project in prison. As he wrote to his wife's sister, Tania, in 1927, he wanted to study the "formation of the public spirit in Italy" through three topics: the Southern Question, the philosophy of Benedetto Croce, and the evolution of popular literary tastes \(1955: 27-8; 1973: 79\). Clearly, those three topics corresponded to the "disintegrated masses," the great intellectuals and the middle-class intellectuals, respectively — in other words, folklore, philosophy, and common sense. 

From a strategic point of view, common sense played the most important role, because, as Gramsci believed the war had showed, an army's effectiveness rests upon the ability of the *ufficiali* \(lieutenants\) to facilitate *communication* between the generals \(the mind\) and the soldiers \(the body\). The new intellectuals had to elaborate a modern humanism "able to reach right to the simplest and most uneducated classes" \(1985: 211\). The Protestant Reformation triumphed when the aspirations of the few became the common sense of the many, transforming a religious event into a political one. Thanks to the popularization of its tenets, the Reformation had the strength to resist Catholic armies and to form the "German nation." By the same token, liberal democracy won when the principles of the Enlightenment ceased to be the cultural property of a restricted intellectual aristocracy and became common beliefs \(1971: 394\). The new reformers envisaged by Gramsci would have to follow the same path, doing precisely what Italian intellectuals had never done: "going to the people" in order to understand the formation and consolidation of popular beliefs and to give the new principles, as *Capital* recites, "the solidity of a popular prejudice." 



## Culture and the Guilt of the Enlightenment

The growing complexity of Gramsci's *meridione* paralleled the growing complexity of his conception of culture. In the *Notebooks*, one no longer sees a homogeneous "immense countryside" \(South\) opposing a homogeneous "immense city" \(North\). The North did not mean simply modernity and urbanization; it was not free from all provincialism and superstition. The city was not necessarily more progressive than the countryside; in Italy, certainly, urbanization and industrialization did not go always and everywhere together. Gramsci's idea of culture became equally complicated; it cannot be reduced simply to a tension between modernity and backwardness, nor even to an adaptation of popular culture to the ideology of intellectuals \(1971: 337\). 

Cultures were, for him, living bodies always subject to inner transformations, not entities to be worshipped, or homogeneous sets of meanings shared by all in the same way \(1971: 418—19\). Gramsci's interest in popular culture and folklore was *political* — neither the mere curiosity of the erudite, nor the nostalgic longing for a supposedly virgin world besieged by modernity \(1971: 90-1\).13 Understanding popular culture meant grasping its inner diversity and the restless transformations bora of its various relations with the culture of the intellectuals, past and present. Beside this idea of *gradual* transfonnation, the vision of sudden, epochal change appeared to him an "illusion," a sign of "the absence of a critical sense" \(1992: 129\). Old and new, intellectual and popular, blended to produce those complex combinations that constitute what we call a national culture. 

Like Freud's contemporaneous vision of the identity of the self, Gramsci's idea of a national culture could be metaphorically compared to the city of Rome \(Freud 1989: 12—17\). A sufficiently learned tourist would be able to recognize the various strata that tell the story of the eternal city since the Etruscan age; she would see relics where a witless observer would see only stones. Conservation, transformation, sedimentation, and evolution are gradual and blended; they are the result of an endless process of mutual adaptation, as the present comes to terms with the past \(1985: 417—18\). The old does not disappear suddenly, but persists in new forms. Folklore and popular culture are living anachronisms, relics of the past stranded in the present and fused into a totality, like the multi-layered city of Rome. Resembling spoken language in contrast to written, folklore is "unstable and fluctuating." Far from being a "pre-history," it is a living version of existing high culture and a present-day recapitulation of past combinations of high and popular culture \(1985: 194—5\). Far from being passively absorbed, it is *actively* created and remodeled, even if it is formed of elements from other cultural strata and times \(1971: 324\). As Gramsci himself suggested, the "public spirit" he planned to study in jail was nothing but "the popular creative spirit, through its diverse phases and grades of development" \(1973: 80\). 

This interpretation of culture affected both his notion of hegemony and his reading of the relation between city and countiyside \(North/South\), because the interpretation allowed for a historicization of abstract categories, such as intellectuals and people, urbanism and ruralism. In the Italian case, wrote Gramsci in the *Notebooks*, the *typical* loses its typicality and complicates itself. Because the formation of cities preceded the industrial revolution, urbanization was not necessarily an industrial phenomenon, nor could it be identified with modernity. In Italy, therefore, one faced the paradox that "the rural type may be more progressive than the urban type." Naples, the "city of silence," was a mosaic of urban islands "submerged, pressured, crushed" by rural areas. This long-lasting conflict nurtured feelings of hatred and resentment, the very sentiments that divided intellectuals from the peasants, the middle class from the poor. For Gramsci no less than for Vincenzo Cuoco, the Enlightenment \(and its intellectuals\) shared primary responsibility for the fall of the Neapolitan Republic of 1799, which marked the failure of the democratic process in the South: "the countiyside crushed the city with the hordes of Cardinal Ruffo because the city had completely neglected the countryside" \(1992: 129-30\). The main responsibility for the Southern Problem rested with the city and the intellectuals, because of their separation from popular culture and their misunderstanding of cultural phenomena. If the culture of democracy did not prevail in Italy, this failure was due not so much to the strength of the anti-modern forces \(Catholicism and the Counter-Reformation\) as to the deficiencies of the culture of modernity. 

The two evils Gramsci identified — *separateness* and *incomprehension —* connected his analysis of southern intellectuals to his critique of the Enlightenment. The "'enlightenment' error" consisted in attributing the same method of mental assimilation and cultural elaboration to all social classes \(1992: 128\). This "error" grew out of the imperialistic vice of the intellectuals, encapsulated in the Cartesian view that, because truth always takes the form of clear and distinct ideas, intellectuals must foster truth by eradicating error in all its forms, in particular popular beliefs, religions, prejudices. But because intellectual processes are more complex, "the premise of an 'organic diffusion from a homogeneous center of a homogeneous way of thinking and acting' is not sufficient" \(1992: 128\). In so far as general principles and local knowledge stand in a relation of reciprocal influence, the cultural strategy can be neither a forced imposition of new principles \("deductivism"\), nor a passive acceptance of things as they are \("empiricism"\). 

Gramsci's observation recalls that of Alexis de Tocqueville: in Europe, intellectuals "suddenly draw general conclusions" from Descartes's method, while in America philosophy has never separated itself from people's daily lives. In Europe, democracy never became common sense, because from the beginning it took the form of a forced imposition of principles shared only by a narrow circle of *savants.* Democracy was decreed by the "authority of the masters" and left the empirical realm of eveiyday life generally untouched. By contrast, the Americans "have needed no books to teach them philosophic method, having found it in themselves." They were democratic in their *mores* \(common sense\), not in obedience to a decree of Reason \(Tocqueville 1969:430-1\). Gramsci's thought revealed an affinity with that of the American pragmatists. Like them he located the Archimedean point of political action neither on the side of "deductivism" nor of "empiricism," but in the very process of their mutual interaction. Hegemonic work rested on the intellectual ability to seek the "identity underneath the apparent differentiation and contradiction and to find the substantial diversity underneath the apparent identity" \(1992: 128\). This epistemologica\! premiss underlay Gramsci's idea that the relation between high culture and popular culture represented the unity of "knowing" and "feeling". 



## The 'Sage of Vulgar Wisdom'

The unity of "knowing" and "feeling" brings us to Gramsci's notion of *understanding,* which, already in his youth, he identified with the Socratic "know thyself." In 1916, commenting upon Novalis' *Fragments*, Gramsci wrote that the supreme task of cultural emancipation was for the individual to learn to master herself — to become "the self of oneself' — not as an egoistic being, but as a "transcendental self" \(1994: 8\). "Know thyself' was an imperative of moral autonomy, in a Kantian sense. A self-mastering self could construct a dialectical relation with the outside world, which then would cease to be experienced as a reified fatal necessity. "Knowing thyself" meant knowing your condition in the world, so that your will would no longer act out of anarchical rebellion, but would express true freedom, a "passage from the 'objective' to the 'subjective'" \(1975: 1244\). Gramsci's notion of an "intellectual and moral reform" \(hegemony\) is grounded in the primacy of subjectivity \(Bobbio 1968: xlv\). 

To clarify the political meaning of the imperative "know thyself," Gramsci used a passage from *The New Science* in which Vico traced Socrates's motto back to Solon, the "party leader of the plebeians in the first times of the aristocratic commonwealth at Athens". Solon was the "sage of vulgar wisdom," able to overcome the power of the heroes and the nobles who "believed \[themselves\] to be of divine origin" and "kept within their own orders all the public and private rights". Solon turned to the people and challenged them "to reflect upon themselves and to realize that they were of like human nature with the nobles and should therefore be made equal with them in civil rights". The transition from aristocracy to democracy transformed not only the subordinate classes but also the whole society: "we shall demonstrate that the plebeians of the peoples universally, beginning with Solon's reflection, changed the commonwealth from aristocratic to popular" \(Vico 1948: 119-20; Gramsci 1994: 8—9\). 

Gramsci's intellectual was the "sage of vulgar wisdom" who could dialogue with his fellows, not in order to accept their way of being, but to incite them to become conscious of their subjectivity as "transcendental selves," as equals. The seeds of cultural emancipation were already present, even if in a disorganized and folkloric form. The difference between high culture and popular culture was a difference of degree, not of kind \(1971: 199\). 

The "organic intellectual" can know and feel because, as Vico suggested, she is moved by the "force" of "imagination". The imagination is *dramatic fantasy*, a faculty that can vividly represent the problems and hopes of society to the mind and sentiment. Thus politics is not simply a strategic calculus, or the implementation of an abstract model. Politics is a combination of reason with an *empathetic* disposition. "In order to provide for the needs of human beings living in a city, a region, a nation, it is necessary to feel those needs; it is necessary \[for the politician\] to represent concretely to his fantasy those human beings as beings who live and work daily, to represent their sorrows, the sadness of a life they are forced to live. If one does not possess this power to dramatize life, one cannot guess the general and particular provisions able to harmonize life's necessities and government's availabilities" \(1958; 101\). 

Because Italian politicians and intellectuals lacked "dramatic fantasy," their deeds were characterized by domination and arrogance. Instead of governing, they worked "to embitter the uneasiness." Their distance from the people, their rancorous contempt for the poor, made them bad politicians and bad intellectuals. "They are amateur. They do not have any sympathy for human beings. They are rhetoricians of sentimentality, not men who feel concretely. They force others to suffer needlessly in the very moment they glorify the virtue of self-sacrificing of the Italians" \(1958: 101\). "They are incapable of representing to themselves the suffering of others, hence they are pointlessly cruel" \(1958: 104\). 

In the words of *Alcune note sulla questione meridionale*, rural intellectuals developed "a strong aversion for the peasant laborer whom they look on as a living machine that must be worked to the bone \[...\]: they also inherit an atavistic and instinctive feeling of crazy fear of the peasant and his destructive violence, and hence a habit of refined hypocrisy and a most refined skill in deceiving and breaking in the peasant masses" \(1983: 43\). 

Like Gramsci himself as a prisoner, and like his fellow Sardinians, the peasants had only two options: to surrender to fatalism or to resist and rebel. Various scholars have argued that Gramsci's notion of hegemony sacrificed spontaneity to discipline and organization. But Gramsci "blessed" that spontaneous rebelliousness he had felt as a child because it saved him from a life of passive acquiescence to an inevitable destiny: "What was it that stopped me from turning into a stuffed shirt? The instinct of rebellion" \(Fiori 1970: 26\). He felt the same way about the peasants, the seeds of whose liberation might lie in their "instinct" for rebellion. 

The words Gramsci used to describe his condition as prisoner can also be used to understand his view of the South: "When you don't have the initiative in the struggle and the straggle itself comes eventually to be identified with a series of defeats, mechanical determinism becomes a tremendous force of moral resistance," a way to maintain moral and psychological cohesion, A loser thinks "things" themselves will work on his behalf. To survive, the will to resist has to convert itself into a natural necessity. But Gramsci had no doubt that even in such extreme circumstances "fatalism is nothing other than the clothing worn by real and active will when in a weak position." His conclusion sounded like a political program: fatalism was a "cause of passivity, of idiotic self-sufficiency when it is adopted as a thought-out and coherent philosophy on the part of the intellectuals" \(1971: 336-7\). Intellectuals must keep alive the people's volitional instincts in order to help them "emerge from the chaos" and become the subjects of their own liberation. To know means to find the origin of power not outside ourselves, in mechanical necessity, but inside ourselves, in spiritual necessity. Gramsci was reading Marx's *Theses on Feuerbach* through Vico, like Giovanni Gentile years earlier. 



## Phenomenology of the Passions

In 1926, Gramsci defined the South as a "great social disintegration" \(*disgregazione*\): disintegration among the classes, which did not communicate with each other, and within the classes themselves, which were composed of individuals sharing the same material interests but spiritually estranged from one another. The cultural environment of social disintegration was a schism between the intellectuals as encyclopedic rhetoricians and the poor as "empty containers to be filled." The failure of the moderates of the *Risorgimento* was the outcome of a cultural distancing whose viciousness became obvious once middle-class intellectuals embraced it: "The smug little student who knows some Latin and history, the vain little lawyer who has taken advantage of his teachers' laziness and apathy to wangle himself a threadbare degree" \(1994: 9\). The middle-class intellectual was like a two-faced Janus, populist and democratic in his peasant soul, arrogant and reactionary in his landlord outlook \(1983: 43\). 

Concern with cultural separateness was a constant topic of Gramsci's writings, beginning even before the *Note* of 1926 and running through his letters from prison and finally the *Notebooks*. Gramsci's treatment of this subject bore a vivid similarity to Salvemini's description of the rural *petite bourgeoisie* and recalled Aristotle's representation of the savage passions that flourish along the borderline between social classes: envy, mistrust, hypocrisy, hatred, revenge, resentment, anarchy, and sudden rebelliousness. Those very passions divided Italian society and hampered the creation of a politics of consent. The South's "great social disintegration" was a highly segregated society, where the new rich, who lived in permanent fear of losing ground, despised the very poor and envied the very rich; where the very poor hated their superiors but, overwhelmed by fear, slid toward a fatal acceptance of their condition; and where the very rich despised the members of both the other classes, and, like gods, stayed too far above them to be touched by their mean feelings and misery \(1983: 42-3\). 

For the middle class and the landed agrarians, the peasant was a mysterious and frightening enigma, a seething cauldron of primordial passions, ignorant, rebellious, and unpredictable. He represented the *other* against which they had to defend themselves, either through religion or State repression, or both. Gramsci's politics of "knowing thyself" acquired its emancipatory strength in relation to this *moral* picture of the South. 

The phenomenology of liberty and necessity, consciousness and being, that lay beneath Gramsci's Socratism permeated his own life no less than his thought. Like an invisible thread, it unified his relationship with his own body, his island, the South, and his condition as a prisoner. Each was the locus of a recalcitrant necessity against which he struggled endlessly. As he wrote to his sister-in-law about his life in prison, "What makes my suffering is the condition of uncertainty, the indeterminacy of that which will occur" \(1955: 161\). 

His body was a dull necessity. To get it under control and correct his deformity, Gramsci had to develop an iron will, exercising "every day" with extraordinary and methodical "determination" and discipline \(Fiori 1970: 19\). His childhood in Sardinia, when he had struggled against hunger, humiliation, and injustice, was a terrible necessity. Like prisons, those experiences made him think of himself as locked in a permanent "war of position" against an oppressive *nature* that defied any order and rational control. To resist that "absolute and almost fatal impossibility," he donned a mask of distance and irony \(1955: 29\). So did the peasants he described in his writings, who fought against middle-class intellectuals \(doctors, priests, lawyers\) as Gramsci did against his environment: with "impassioned anger" and unpredictable rebelliousness \(1971: 14\). 

Segregation made communication impossible and undesirable. In the South, and between the North and the South, relationships were based on reciprocal ignorance and reciprocal fear, because neither could foresee what the *other* might have done: the peasants because of their superabundance of "feeling," the intellectuals because of their arid erudition, and the Northerners because they thought of the South's "misery" as "unexplainable" \(1971: 70\). "The popular element 'feels' but does not always know or understand; the intellectual element 'knows' but does not always understand and in particular does not always feel" \(1971: 418\). 

How was Gramsci to reconcile these two elements without falling into either Mazzini's humanitarian sentimentalism or an impatient jacobinism? As a student in Turin, Gramsci had been interested in understanding the practical value of the "intellectual factor," in learning why ideas had the power to make us act. His teacher directed him to the theory of the *idées-forces* of Alfred Fouillée, an earlier version of William James's "will to believe," which helped many intellectuals of Gramsci's generation escape from determinism and abstraction \(Garin 1974: 356-7\). 

Gramsci saw two ways to overcome necessity: through a single heroic act \(the "war of maneuver," or *force*\) or through the slow and prosaic work of cultural reshaping \(the "war of position," or *consent*\). As we know, he discarded the first strategy because, according to him, it was suitable only for a less developed society. In Western countries, civil society was much more articulated and pluralistic than in contemporary Russia or eighteenth-century France, making the use of force inappropriate \(Paggi 1984: 14-15\). For the working classes of the West, jacobinism's moment was over. As Georges Sorel had noticed in 1919, social transformation could not be attained by implementing truths from above. "If the Church had been merely a school of philosophy preaching pure morality, it would undoubtedly have disappeared like many other groups" \(Sorel 1976: 73\). No élite, no charismatic leader, could create a new society by force. To use Michael Walzer's language, Gramsci's intellectual would not force the truth from outside \(Walzer 1988: 90\). 

The struggle of the South was thus not simply a struggle for survival or for economic progress, but a struggle to liberate itself from its "tremendous" passions. To succeed it was not enough to invert the relationship between "knowing" and "feeling." As a young journalist for a radical Sardinian newspaper, Gramsci saw firsthand the powerlessness of a rebellion unable to master necessity. In 1910, the peasants had been ready to show their "startling and fearful" determination to obtain universal suffrage in local elections. To calm them down, it had been enough for the government to send eighty soldiers. Paralysed by fear of repression, their rebellious instincts were impotent \(Fiori 1970: 59-60\). The road toward autonomy and dignity had to lead in another direction, because the peasants' weakness lay not in their material conditions but in their lack of subjective consciousness, their inability to guide their "spontaneous" tension toward liberation \(Salvadori 1970: 136\), To distinguish oneself from the other, Gramsci wrote some years later, meant to attain consciousness of oneself as an independent subject, to be able not simply to will, but to have an "exact notion of one's own power" so as to know what one can will \(1994: 57; Adamson 1980: 152—4\). 

This idealist conception of subjectivity was the seed of Gramsci's notion of *catharsis*, the passage from the purely egoistic-passional moment \(economics\) to the ethical-ideal moment \(politics\) \(1971: 366\). The emancipatory function of politics \(the primacy of the political over the economic\) stood against enslavement to biological needs in a way that echoed the Aristotelian duality between the realm of the *household* \(necessity\) and the *political* realm \(liberty\). From the former sphere paralysing passions arose; from the latter the intelligent will arose. Emancipation from "private" passions, such as fear and rage and hatred, was the precondition for political action and corresponded to the passage from a common sense that saw the "enemy" as an irreducible other \(total enemy\) to one that saw him as a specific antagonist \(political enemy\). 



## A Fugitive from Backwardness?

To become the intellectual who *knows* how to liberate the subordinate classes, Michael Walzer recently wrote, Gramsci had to leave behind the backwardness of common sense and learn to see things from a "universal" and external point of view. Gramsci as intellectual needed to "break as radically with the 'Sardinia' of common sense as he had done with the actual Sardinia where he was born and raised" \(Walzer 1988: 95\). The image of Gramsci as a "fugitive" from backwardness, seeking modernity, was first suggested in 1924 by Piero Gobetti, who described Gramsci as a man who left "the countryside in order to forget his traditions and substituted the Sardinian anachronism with a solitary and inexorable effort to grasp the modernity of urban life" \(Gobetti 1969: 1003\). Both Gobetti and Walzer raise a very important concern, even if what was for the former an act of heroism is for the latter a sign of a culpable estrangement. 

Although appealing, however, the image of Gramsci as a fugitive from local knowledge \("his rejection of home and homeland:" Walzer 1988: 95\) reduces his complexity to too sharp a dualism. Did Gramsci reject his origins? During his first years in Turin, he associated only with Sardinians, and chose to study glottology in order to deepen his knowledge of his native language. Indeed, it was this affection for his origins that kept him far from socialist circles, where a loyalty to positivism was fomenting deep anti-southern prejudices. "People usually speak of the lack of initiative of the Southerners. The fact is that capital looks always for the most safe and lucrative ways of investment" \(1958: 32\). An idealist Marxism was for him a way of dignifying southern identity, rather than rejecting it. Indeed, a social interpretation of Sardinian backwardness required first of all the rejection of all "scientific" theories based on a biological reading of cultural difference — among them the theory of the socialist, Lombroso \(see Gibson, this volume, Chapter 4\). Because the South was not "special," composed of constitutionally "different" people, the southern problem could not be solved by "special legislation" \(as both conservatives and socialists were proposing\). It was a "national question," a political question of "a general policy, both domestic and foreign" \(1958: 31\). Gramsci's idealization of modernity reflected first of all his desire to combat those prejudices and their easy diffusion within the working class, thanks to the old Italian socialist culture \(1983: 31\). His *città* was thus a regulative idea more than a description of an actual city \(1958: 93-4\). 

Precisely because Gramsci never totally rejected his identity as a southerner \(and as a southerner gave his first and last parliamentary speech\), he was able to see the limits of the worker culture that treated the peasants of the South as obstacles to progress, as a "lead weight" for the whole nation \(1983: 31; 1971: 71\). Gramsci's opposition of the "universal" \(the general or national\) to the "corporate" should also be seen from this perspective. His promotion of a "new humanism" for all was an attempt to "deprovincialize" both the North and the South, purging the North of its racism and its egocentric localism and the South of its fatalistic resignation. Northerners — both intellectuals and common people — never felt "solidarity" with the South because of their colonizing ideology, their total "ignorance" of southern society, and their prejudices. No less than the Sardinians, the Northerners had to submerge their localism in a unitarian \(or national\) outlook. They did not have to deny their cultural identity, but they did need to free themselves from their selfish provincialism. 

Should we see Gramsci as a "victim" of Marxist teleology? "The more advanced his theory, the more detached he is in practice from working-class backwardness" \(Walzer 1988: 99\). I am inclined to adopt a milder reading, because Gramsci never resolved this tension once and for all. Besides, had he embraced teleology he would not have been content with his disorganized notes; he would have constructed a system out of the sparse empirical evidences he had. He would not have felt in need of that "huge amount of material" \(1973: 79\). Gramsci's attitude is always in balance between spontaneity and constructivism. In prison, he grew plants. He tried constantly to "draw them up a bit to help them grow" \(1973: 144\). He could never solve his "uncertainty" concerning the two opposite methods of education: if he should have been "Rousseauian and let Nature, which never errs and is basically good, do what she wants," or "voluntarist, and force Nature by introducing into its evolution an expert human hand and the principle of authority" \(1955: 72; 1973: 144\). 



## Common Sense as a Common Faith

To interpret the crucial role played by common sense \(and by middle-class intellectuals as *ufficiali of communication and integration*\) in Gramsci's Southern Question, we should think of common sense as a medium that facilitates interaction between the two extremes, high culture and folklore. 

Like the *axiomata media* of John Stuart Mill, Gramsci's common sense comprises the whole of the *maxims* through which principles are translated into moral guides for everyday life. In this sense, Gramsci wrote that every high culture and every discipline has its own folklore. In the case of judicial culture, for instance, the belief in natural rights is a form of folklore, that is, a translation of the judicial principles of the "experts" into common sense and common language. When we say that a judge should interpret the *spirit* of the law, we are asking him to adapt general principles to the shared culture of the whole society \(1985: 193-4\). Between these two levels, a process of reciprocal accommodation, rather than imposition on one side and passive absorption on the other, occurs. Thus Gramsci did not contradict himself when, at the very moment he accepted the leading role of intellectuals, he also insisted that between high culture and popular culture there was a difference of "quantity" not "quality" \( 1971: 347\). Using Rawlsian language, we might say that common sense looks like a *reflective equilibrium*, or, as Gramsci himself said, "a reciprocal 'reduction' so to speak, a passage from one \[principles\] to the other \[common sense\] and vice versa," a movement back and forth between universality and common knowledge. "Recall that Immanuel Kant believed it important for his philosophical theories to agree with common sense" \( 1971: 199\). 

When Gramsci wrote that Italy needed a "public spirit" to become a unified society, he was suggesting that *communication* among social and cultural strata was needed, so that political consciousness would not exist solely among a tiny élite while the masses remained totally estranged from public life. 

If we inspect Gramsci's notion of hegemony in the light of his reflections on the Southern Question, we may be legitimately tempted to extend that notion to democracy and say that his hegemonic project was inspired by the same ideal that underlay John Dewey's conception of democracy as a *common faith*. "The Italian people lack the spirit of disinterested solidarity, the love of free discussion, the desire to attain truth by purely human means offered by intelligence and reason" \(1994: 37\). Interpreting Gramsci's project of "moral and intellectual renovation" of Italian society from this perspective, we may conclude that his notion of hegemonic unity did not necessarily mean the repression of spontaneity and popular culture by the "missionaries" of the philosophy of praxis \(Walzer 1988: 90\). The movement from common sense to philosophy might be seen as a gradual \(and revolving\) move from a lesser to a greater level of generality in the expression of moral principles that are already shared by a political community. It is the work of intellectuals to give these principles theoretical form —not to create them. A theory of the good society has the chance to become widespread common sense in so far as it elaborates upon the notions of justice and equality that are already contained within a given culture in the form of sentiments and intuitions. 

This democratic interpretation of Gramsci's hegemony can be compared to the relationship he spelled out between a dialect and a national language. "Someone who *only* speaks dialect, or understands language incompletely, necessarily has an intuition of the whole which is more or less limited and provincial" \(1971: 325, italics added\). The same was true of someone who spoke *only* the national language. As he wrote to his sister, not teaching her children the Sardinian tongue would mean depriving them of the possibility of understanding their whole culture, which was a blend of the local and the national. To form hegemony, therefore, does not necessarily mean to manipulate or uproot popular culture but to enable communication among the cultural levels that make up a national culture. Hegemony aims at ensuring that no social group, whether intellectuals or southern peasants, remains a "narrow province," segregated and complacent about its own isolation and diversity. 




## Notes

1. "The leading class takes care primarily of its own interests," while the rural working class "is suffering more than any other class." Villari proposed two solutions: first a struggle against illiteracy, second an agrarian reform. The latter had to be accomplished by encouraging the growth of a secure form of sharecropping and of smallholdings. This reference to Villari allows us to question Sidney Tarrow's thesis that Gramsci was the father of the theory of "rape" because he depicted the South as "the special victim" of the Risorgimento \(Tarrow 1967: 251\). 

2. Both as a historian and a *meridionalista*, Salvemini was a pupil of Villari, about whom he wrote an inspiring essay on the occasion of his death in 1918 \(Salvemini 1978: 57-80\). 

3. For a democratic and pluralist interpretation of Gramsci's hegemonic project, see Chantal Mouffe's "Hegemony and Ideology in Gramsci" \(1979\) and Noberto Bobbio \(1977\). 

4. Gramsci never completely abandoned this position or totally rejected regionalism. As he wrote in 1923 in explaining the aims of the new-born newspaper *L'Unità*, to consider the Southern question a national question did not mean to think in terms of centralization: "the real tendencies of the peasant class . . . have always had in their programmes the slogan of local autonomy and decentralization" \(1978: 162\). 

5. "Why can't one recall," wrote Gramsci in 1919, "that Sardinian miners are paid starvation wages ...? Why should it be prohibited to recall that two-thirds of the inhabitants of Sardinia \(especially women and children\) go without shoes in the winter and summer ... because the price of hide has gone sky-high due to the protective tariffs that enrich the Turin industrialists and leather manufacturers?" \(Gramsci 1968: 103—4\). 

6. This conviction was widespread far beyond the Communist circle. See, for instance, Carlo Rosselli 's article "Wilson" \(1917\), quoted in Nicola Tranfaglia \(1968\), *Carlo Rosselli dall'interventismo a* "*Giustizia e Libertà"*, p. 20. 

7. "In vain the Soviet government invited them \[the peasants\] to support the power of the workers and the peasants: they refused to give bread to the workers of the Hungarian cities and Hungary, which is a country of peasants, remained without bread" \(Corvisieri 1970: 380\). 

8. The first criticism of the "unitarian" strategy of the Communists came from the radical *meridionalisti*, in particular Guido Dorso, who in 1925 wrote that both the Partito Popolare and the Communists could not understand and solve the Southern Problem because they "neutralized the southern action into a northern one" \(R. Villari 1981: 524\). As Gramsci's *Southern Question* shows, Dorso's criticism had a deep influence on his revision of his former worker-centred Marxism. 

9. The word *disgregazione* should be read as having two meanings, a moral one and a political one: as denunciation of conditions of suffering and injustice, and as the identification of the critical point from which to begin the transformation of the entire system \(Badaloni 1975: 121-4; Pizzorno 1970: 114\). 

10. It is worth noting that the same diagnosis of the *piemontesi'*s faults was made by some conservative and radical leaders of the Risorgimento. See, for instance, Pasquale Villari, "Di chi è la colpa? o sia la pace e la guerra" \(1866\) in P. Villari 1868: 390, and Carlo Cattaneo, "Prefazione" of Voi. 10 of *Il Politecnico* \(1860\) in Cattaneo 1972, Vol. 1: 209-10. 

11. Gramsci's interpretation of the Risorgimento as a "failed revolution" and a "failed agrarian revolution" was at the center of debate among historians of the 1960s and 1970s, beginning with Rosario Romeo and Federico Chabod \(Davis 1979: 67—103\). I personally tend to accept Alessandro Pizzorno's proposal that we consider Gramsci's interest in the Risorgimento as essentially political rather than historiographical. Gramsci's aim was to verify not a historical interpretation but a political theory; his interest was in the present and future more than in the past. His criticism of a history made of *ifs* is well known. The *ifs*, writes Pizzorno, are useful for the political leader but not for the historian, because they delineate a possible scenario for action that was not taken and ought to be taken \(Pizzorno 1970: 113—14\). Like Machiavelli's *Discorsi*, Gramsci's *Notebooks* is not a book of history but one of politics. 

12. As Gramsci wrote in 1918, Italy's only chance of becoming a nation lay in educating Italians to become responsible citizens with a clear sense of their rights and duties. His ethical model recalled the contrast Mazzini drew between a Bentham-oriented individual and an association-oriented one, or, as Gramsci wrote, between a "capitalist-individual" and an "association-individual" \( 1958: 186-9\). 

13. An excellent analysis of Gramsci's complex notion of folklore is in Cirese 1970: 299-328.
