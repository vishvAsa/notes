## Early conquest
> 
> Hittites had already made it to Anatolia and were working their way across there, invading and conquering Hurrian etc. non-IE groups as they set up their empire. 
> 
> They would have gotten to the area proximate to Anatolia *probably* several centuries beforehand - although it's a bit fuzzy for obvious reasons. Some sources suggest ~1900 BC, others put it a little earlier than that in the late 2000s.

> ... you can *pretty much* tell *exactly* when the Indo-Europeans show up in a range of areas based around the fine depositional layer of carbon from the settlement being burned down ... and then reconstructed "under new management".

## Destruction
> The Bronze Age civilization of Central Anatolia (or Turkey), which we today call Hittite, completely disappeared sometime around 1200 B.C. ...  The capital city was burnt to the ground and remained uninhabited for several hundred years. Out of the wreckage of Bronze Age civilization there emerged a group of small independent states, retaining some of the features and one of the languages of their all but forgotten ancestors, but dominated by the new ethnic groups in the area, chiefly the Arameans. The greatest number of these states were situated about the Taurus and Amanus mountain ranges, in southeastern Turkey and northern Syria. This is the area known to the kings of Assyria as the “Hatti-Land,” and this terminology is also to be found in the Old Testament where we meet such Hittites as the unfortunate Uriah and his beautiful wife, Bathsheba.
