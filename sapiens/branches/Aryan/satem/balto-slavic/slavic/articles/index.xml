      <description>&lt;p&gt;Thread by @NebojsaMalic on Thread Reader App.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Did you know that the Bosnian War (1992-1995, 98k dead) didn&amp;rsquo;t have to happen? There was an EU-brokered deal all three communities agreed to. But the US ambassador went to the Bosnian Muslim leader and said he can renege on it. Which he promptly did. A short ðŸ§µ.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Then he unilaterally declared independence and claimed Serbs and Croats living in Bosnia were &amp;ldquo;aggressors&amp;rdquo; for opposing him. At least three peace proposals brokered by the UN and EU failed because the US told the Muslims they didn&amp;rsquo;t have to accept them. Only in mid-1995, when the US managed to change the situation on the ground by using Croatia as a proxy, did Washington jump in and say &amp;ldquo;NOW we make a peace deal,&amp;rdquo; just in time for Bill Clinton&amp;rsquo;s re-election campaign! The confused Muslims treated the talks in Dayton, Ohio like every other sham negotiation, until Richard Holbrooke told them to get with the program. It&amp;rsquo;s all in his 1998 book, &amp;ldquo;To End A War,&amp;rdquo; self-serving as it is.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
