Did you know that the Bosnian War (1992-1995, 98k dead) didn't have to happen? There was an EU-brokered deal all three communities agreed to. But the US ambassador went to the Bosnian Muslim leader and said he can renege on it. Which he promptly did. A short ðŸ§µ.

Then he unilaterally declared independence and claimed Serbs and Croats living in Bosnia were "aggressors" for opposing him. At least three peace proposals brokered by the UN and EU failed because the US told the Muslims they didn't have to accept them. Only in mid-1995, when the US managed to change the situation on the ground by using Croatia as a proxy, did Washington jump in and say "NOW we make a peace deal," just in time for Bill Clinton's re-election campaign! The confused Muslims treated the talks in Dayton, Ohio like every other sham negotiation, until Richard Holbrooke told them to get with the program. It's all in his 1998 book, "To End A War," self-serving as it is.

Basically, the US unconditionally backed every Bosnian Muslim demand - until it didn't. They signed the Dayton deal thinking it would be an armistice and they could restart the war with US weapons and training. That never happened (for several reasons). Now if any of this sounds familiar... that's because it's happening all over again with Ukraine.
