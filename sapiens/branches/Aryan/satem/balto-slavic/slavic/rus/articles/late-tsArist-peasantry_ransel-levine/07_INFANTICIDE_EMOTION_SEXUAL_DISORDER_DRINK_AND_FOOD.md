title = "07 INFANTICIDE, EMOTION, SEXUAL DISORDER, DRINK AND FOOD"

+++


*As its title reveals, this chapter covers a variety of subjects. Not only the chapter itself but subsections of it have been built out of widely scattered pieces of Semyonova’s account and notes. The result, though still a hodge-podge, has the virtue of greater coherence than the original text. Nevertheless, I occasionally have had to insert transitional comments to avoid too sharp a turn in the discussion*.

*Among a new wife’s most important tasks was to reproduce a new generation. Not until she had a surviving child was she regarded as a full-fledged member of her new household. Since Semyonova has already dealt with the issue of childbirth and with child rearing, such as it was in Russian peasant life, she writes little about it in her subsequent notes. But here I wanted to include a few comments she makes on the length of confinement for birthing mothers, sexual contacts between husband and wife, illegitimacy, lullabies, and related topics*.

*Among these, the topic of infanticide returns. Semyonova’s observations are disturbing to modern readers, but there is no reason to doubt their accuracy. My own recent researches on this question suggest that in many parts of Russia, children, unwanted because of illegitimacy, physical malformation, or apparent weakness, met their deaths either quickly through infanticide of the kinds described by Semyonova or more slowly by a reduced level of care and feeding*.1 *Her laconic remark on the low rate of illegitimate births compared to the number of sexually active unmarried women may be taken as one of her measures of the “infanticide gap.” She notes as well the illegitimate children of married women, a common enough occurrence in Russian villages, from which many of the men were absent for long periods as migrant laborers or soldiers. We need to keep in mind that these women were not moral monsters. They were charged with maintaining a delicate social and demographic balance; their first duty was to ensure the economic and patriarchal control that ultimately protected their healthy children and the family unit as a whole. Their behavior has to be understood within the context of the precarious subsistence economy in which they lived*.2





After getting married, Ivan enjoys a period of grace at home. For the first three days a new husband is a “young prince.” The family is indulgent with him and considerate, “if not for his sake, then for his wife’s,” as they say. The newlyweds receive extra servings of food and are allowed to sleep in during the first three days of celebration, but after that, they work, like everyone else. The groom is told something like: “You were young, but now you are a veteran, got yourself a wife, so get to work.” The bride is treated more leniently, for she is new in the family. She enjoys certain benefits, for instance in food. Thus, pampering consists of fattening up a prospective worker, three days of the easy life, and the privilege of sleeping outside in a barn or storeroom while the weather is warm \[affording the newlyweds some privacy\].

In the first few days after the wedding, the young wife talks with her husband in an effort to find out whatever she can about each member of his family, and occasionally she expresses her concern for the future. She also discusses the customs in her husband’s household. If the young husband likes her, he naturally tries to reassure her and to explain the way things are and how she can best get along with her mother-in-law and father-in-law.

\[When a baby is born,\] according to tradition, husband and wife should resume sexual relations six weeks after the woman’s confinement, a time marked by her churching and ritual purification. But this rule is rarely observed. After delivery of the first baby, a husband might be considerate to his wife, but after the second or third baby, he does not wait the customary six weeks. If he is drunk, he will resume relations after a week. Even if he stays sober, he will ordinarily begin sexual relations after only two or three weeks. In general, Ivan’s sexual demands on his wife are closely related to his diet and to intoxication. Having eaten his fill in the fall, and especially after a drink, Ivan is almost insatiable. On the other hand, when he is hungry or engaged in the heavy summer field work, Ivan rarely goes near his wife. The wife, of course, is not asked her wishes. He simply yells, “Aksinia, come over here\!” and that is it. She knows from his tone of voice what he is looking for.

Women age fast so far as their looks are concerned. Yet despite unfavorable conditions for their health, despite even diseases and malnutrition, they sometimes bear children at the age of fifty, and babies are very often born to women in their mid-forties. I know of a woman who gave birth when she was sixty-three years old. Her husband was the same age. She died at the age of sixty-seven, but her husband is still alive and has as his “heir” this twelve-year-old son.

There are also many instances of older men who are still full of energy while their wives are failing badly. This situation sometimes results in what is known as *snokhachestvo*, that is, sexual relations between a man and his daughter-in-law \(this also happens occasionally in cases of widowers with married sons\).3

The rate of illegitimate births for unmarried women is, in fact, very low compared with the number of “loose” girls.

In the big village of B \(population 1,200\), one, two, or even three times a year a scandal breaks out about an illegitimate pregnancy. Babies in these cases are sent to \[the imperial foundling home in\] Moscow, but killings of the newborn also occur. In the past four years, there have been two notorious cases of infanticide in the village and in its surrounding parish, cases in which the mothers were tried. The sentence in each case was a few months of imprisonment.

In practice, the number of these killings is higher, if the illegitimate infants of soldiers’ wives and other married women are taken into account. Frequently the illegitimacy of these babies is known only to the family, and a killing committed within the family is impossible to prove. I have always been suspicious of cases of reported accidental smothering of babies, since it is very easy to roll over on a baby and intentionally smother it while pretending that it happened by accident in sleep.

Not all babies are subject to killing, but illegitimate ones are very likely to be. A weak baby that is a burden to its mother is not killed, although its parents will grumble at its existence and constantly express a desire for its death.4 Among the reasons for infanticide are shame, fear, and finances. An unmarried woman is most likely to kill her baby out of shame. A married woman or a soldier’s wife will do so fearing the wrath of her husband or his family, while a widow burdened with children will kill a baby because of economic need \(see the accounts \[given earlier\] of a young married woman who under the pressure of her mother-in-law poisoned her illegitimate baby with matches and of a poor homeless widow who drowned her illegitimate baby in the pond\). Older women are very ruthless and cold-blooded about the killing of an illegitimate “whelp,” whom they view as a nuisance and a burden. Young women anguish over such a decision and force themselves to kill their babies only when shame or fear causes them to lose their senses, or when they can no longer bear their own and their babies’ suffering. Men, from what I could observe, often simply do not know about such killings, even when they occur in their own families, or, if they figure out what is going on, they look the other way. “Damn women are cooking up something, the hell with them, it’s no concern of mine” is probably how a man reasons, pushing away any thoughts of what the women are up to.

Leo Tolstoy captured peasant character traits marvelously in a similar situation. Watch the peasants, observe their life closely, and you will see just how accurate Tolstoy’s depiction was: the cruelty of old Matryona, the frenzy of Anisia … all these are true pictures of peasant life, the way it really is.5

The rate of child deaths is highest in the summer during the fast of St. Peter \[in June\], and especially during the field-work season, when unattended children eat anything they come across: cucumbers, sour apples, and any other vegetation. Diarrhea is the chief cause of child death. As for the death rate, in a majority of homes more than half of all children die. Most women bear from eight to ten or twelve children, of which only three or four survive.6 \[The death of an infant in a poor family that could not support another child was evidently regarded as a blessing, as Semyonova recorded in one of her unpublished field notes.\] When a poor family’s child dies, people say: “Thank goodness, the Lord thought better of it\!”7

\[The peasant cradle and the lullabies that accompany its rocking played a central role in family life. The cradle was usually made of wood \(or a wooden frame with a canvas bottom\) and suspended from a small spring attached to a rafter. A rope or thong with a loop fell from the cradle to the floor, enabling the cradle to be rocked by anyone available to sit near it; and Russian cradles were in motion much of the day, by all accounts.\]

A woman slips the loop around her foot to rock the baby, while her hands are occupied with some needlework. When the adult women force a small girl to rock the cradle, she may rock it so hard that the baby flies out. “Mashka, take it easy, you fool, make sure you don’t flip the child onto the floor\!” is the usual rebuke to the child.

Lullabies commonly sung today:


Hush, hush, hushaby my baby,

Don’t lie near the edge of the bed.

The gray wolf will come

And carry you off to the woods.


Or:


Hush, hush, hushaby my baby,

I’ll give you spankings,

Twenty-five of them,

To make you sleep better and deeper.


Or:


Hush, hush, hushaby my baby.

A man lives at the end of the village.

He’s neither poor, nor rich,

He has many children,

They sit on a bench

And eat straw.

I’ll make you suffer even more.

I won’t give you anything to eat.

I won’t make a bed for you.


Or:


Hush, hush, hushaby my baby.

Sleep, sleep, fall asleep

Let peace overtake you.


The last-quoted lullaby is the most common. The women say: “I have no time to think up rhymes; I’ve got enough worries as it is. All you can say is the ordinary ‘Sleep, sleep, may peace overtake you.’ … It is only when there is not much to do and you start thinking about the children, and it upsets you just to look at them, then you might hit on some of the old rhymes, though rarely.”

\[Semyonova wonders about the quality of personal relations between husband and wife, and in this connection she explores the issues of peasant affect and humor.\]

The question of how a peasant husband might show affection for his wife has long interested me. At one time, I believed that peasants simply do not express their emotions, since there are absolutely no external signs of a husband’s feelings toward his wife, even in young couples. But the following story recently caused me to reconsider this issue. “Take Petrukha\!” say the local women. “Look how he cares for his wife\! I wonder if there is another woman as lucky as she in the village\!”

Petrukha, an ordinary peasant, is our coachman, but a coachman “on temporary leave from the plow,” as it were. I have long known him as a plain, quiet man, while his wife is a shrewd and clever, if selfish, woman. I also know that Petrukha gave up drinking after he got drunk at a wedding and nearly drowned in a pond, and that he does not beat his wife. He is not much of a manager, but his wife is first-rate and “thinks through” everything carefully, such as how to do the sowing, the mowing of hay, the purchasing of a cow, and the like. At his wife’s slightest call, Petrukha, who is not capable even of providing for the morrow, rushes to the village to do whatever she asks of him. If his friends prevent him from going during the day, he will sneak out at night. And in case of discovery, he has anticipated the accusation and eagerly provides an explanation: “My missus had an idea to get a head start on binding the millet into sheaves. Well, you could see it was going to rain, so I went out at night and mowed the lot for her.” If his wife tells him that the house is not properly caulked for the winter, he will not rest until he finds the time to patch up the place and put her mind at ease. Before he married eight or nine years ago following his military service, Petrukha was the most slovenly fellow in the village. Unfortunately, men like Petrukha and the type of relationship he has with his wife are rare indeed. To tell the truth, this is the only case I know of.

\[Then Semyonova tells of a sight that she assumes a German would interpret through a romantic metaphor, whereas the Russian applied a competitive one.\]

In the orchard, felling trees.

Looking at two young intertwined trees, a birch and a linden, that grow, as it were, from the same root, I say:

“It is amazing how intertwined they are\!”

To which the gardener replies: “They argue which one will win.”

The laborer, warming to the subject, adds: “I bet the linden will beat it. Birch is no match for linden.”

The Germans would surely have said something about two enamored beings, for it is supposed to be so in an orchard, where the atmosphere is conducive to sentimental thoughts….

\[Further anecdotes concern personal expression and humor.\]

Yesterday I was in our garden and could unseen watch passers-by on the road leading to the village. This year the harvest was good, and there is more traffic on the road. I saw two young men walking along silently eating sunflower seeds. I approached the gate and asked one of them, Boris, where they were going. My question seemed to startle them out of their “sleep walk.” Boris told me that they were on their way to drink tea in Muraevnia. This was said with a completely blank look, with no trace of a smile.

Then a peasant couple passed by in the usual single file, like a gander and his goose, the man leading the way and the woman in his wake. They had been to the mill to sell cabbage. Again, what sullen and dejected looks they wore on their faces\! I watched them for a few minutes as they walked by, oblivious of my presence. Only once did the man turn to his wife, and then merely to ask for paper to make a cigarette. The woman pulled out a package she was carrying on her bosom, tore off a scrap of paper, and passed it to her husband. His gnarled fingers rolled a cigarette, and the couple resumed their silent journey.

Only when peasants are drunk or quarreling can their voices be heard from afar. When the men are drunk, they have an obscene comment for every passing woman. A woman might reply: “You’d better go to church, Ivan. I reckon you’ve never been there.” And the man in rebuttal: “Me? Go to a priest? What do I need with a piece of shit like him? He still hasn’t gotten around to tying the knot between you and me.” This is a relatively good-natured and mild jest. It is a big success with the man’s buddies, and they burst out laughing. But the laughter is hard and fitful. They do not sound as if they are really enjoying themselves.

Husbands and wives speak very little with each other. But if a few women get together, the discussion can be animated, at least more so than in a group of men. When women walk together down the street, they are never silent. They ramble on about the minutiae of their domestic life. Their laughter also strikes me as livelier and more cheerful than that of the men.

Of course, sometimes you can hear genuinely hearty laughter from the men. I have noticed, for example, that some of the peasant men never fail to evoke chuckles from their fellow farm workers or fellow villagers. As soon as the broad beard or fat face of such a peasant comes into view, everyone bursts into laughter. Usually the object of this merriment is a person who carries himself with dignity, may be quite handsome, and strikes a fine figure. Yet he is met with shrieks of laughter. It seems that the reason for the merriment lies in the man’s pretention; peasants do not like “uppityness” and want to make it look ridiculous. It is the air of self-importance that elicits the laughter, and the angrier the target of the fun becomes, the greater the laughter. Usually, the shabbiest-looking peasants take the most delight in this spectacle. Of course, they themselves are never the target of laughter. The peasants’ laughter is prolonged, and they literally shriek with merriment, gasping for air and doubling over as if they wished to hide completely their unassuming faces.

Unfortunately, when the possessor of this “laughable” deportment is a wealthy farmer \(kulak\), you do not hear any laughter. Peasants laugh at their “buddies,” and a kulak is hardly a “buddy.”

A dozen female and two male farm workers are preparing to return from the landlord’s threshing barn. It is cold, and a snowstorm is blowing. Two of the women linger near a pile of oats heaped at the barn’s doorway. Both women, Anisia and Aleksandra, are originally from the same village, but Aleksandra moved after her marriage. Now Anisia is visiting with her sister in the village where Aleksandra also currently lives. Aleksandra has invited her old friend to keep her company at the threshing barn and at the same time to earn good money, thirty kopecks a day. The overseer \(*barskii starosta*\) stands nearby.


ANISIA \(a woman in her thirties\): “Aleksandra, dear, look for my shawl, I left it here somewhere in the oats.”

ALEKSANDRA \(a soldier’s wife\), rummaging in the pile: “I can’t seem to find it.”

THE OVERSEER: “Why are you messing around in the oats? Get on home\!”

ANISIA: “My shawl must be there …”

OVERSEER: “What crap\! The thing costs fifteen kopecks. It’s not exactly a recent wedding present. You’ll make it home without a shawl…. Get moving\!”

ANISIA \(sounding hurt\): “Even if it cost only five kopecks, it’s still dear to me.”

ALEKSANDRA: “Here it is.”


The overseer locks the barn, and he and the two stragglers catch up with the other women, who are struggling against the wind.


ANISIA \(tying the shawl\): “Thank you, dear…. \(Then after a while\) Is your husband coming home soon?”

ALEKSANDRA \(sighs\): “He’s got two more years to serve.”

OVERSEER \(laughs\): “She said just the other day she’d be happy if he had another year to go.”

ALEKSANDRA: “You’re lying. I’ve cried my head off, just look at me. How can you say such a thing—that I’d be ‘happy’?”

OVERSEER \(still laughing\): “Hey, Anisia, the other day they told \[Aleksandra\] that her husband, Pavel, was killed in China, and she started to dance.”

ALEKSANDRA: “Go to hell, damn you\!”

OVERSEER: “Mikolka, why are you hanging around the girls? You haven’t fed the animals yet.”

ALYOSHKA: “Look, there he is, hiding behind Mashka, warming up.”


The women laugh. The wind throws a cloud of tiny sharp snowflakes in their faces.


ANISIA: “It’s freezing\! I can’t wait to get back to the house and lie down on the stove.”

MASHKA \(a fat, ruddy woman\): “Lying on the stove gets boring.”

ALEKSANDRA: “Maybe it’s boring. But it’s better than out here. You warm up first on one side, then on the other.” \(She starts singing.\)

OVERSEER: “Hey, smarty, why start hollering? Not cold enough for you?”

ALEKSANDRA: “One song is all I know.”


The women giggle.


ALEKSANDRA: “If I had wings, I would fly to him.”


The women giggle again. One of them says: “Sure, and he’d give you a beating.”


ALEKSANDRA \(addressing Anisia\): “No, he wrote me8 a letter the other day, says, ‘If I had eight wings, I would fly to you every day.’ That’s what he says.”


Here is the letter from Aleksandra’s husband, Pavel:

“A letter home. From your son. My first duty is to make haste to inform you that at present I am safe and sound. I bow humbly to my dear mother Marfa Vasilevna, and may God grant you good health and a speedy and successful conclusion to all your endeavors. I also pray that peace and goodness may exist in both the military and civil service so long as I live. I also give best regards to my dear brother Demian Ivanovich and pray the Lord grant you good health and the best of everything. I also give my best regards to my dear spouse, Aleksandra Artemovna; I kiss you countless times on your sweet lips as if I were with you and send you my deepest husbandly respects, and may God grant you good health, a speedy and successful conclusion to all your endeavors, and a happy heart. I also give my best greetings to my dear and fondly remembered children, Vladimir Pavlovich and Avdotia Pavlovna. I send you my parental blessing; may peace accompany you all your days. Dear mother, forgive me for not writing you for a long time. I did not know that you had sent me money, which reached me only recently. I thank you from the bottom of my heart for this dear present. You think, dear mother, that I am cross with you, but I am not, the opposite is true—I miss you very much. If I had four big wings, I would fly to you and to my dear wife every day. I also give my best regards to my godparents, first to my godfather, Artem Kuzmich, and his wife, Avdotia Ilinishna, and to their children, and may God grant them all good health and the best of everything. I also give regards to my godmother and her spouse, Ilia Andreevich; may God grant them good health and a speedy and successful conclusion to all their endeavors. I also give my greetings to my aunt Anisia Stepanovna and my brother Pyotr Nikolaevich, along with his spouse and children; may God grant them good health and the best of everything. I also give regards to Yegor Terentievich and his spouse, Liubov Nikolaevna, and their children, and may God grant them good health and the best of everything. Give my regards also to all our other relatives and friends. May the Lord grant them good health and Godspeed in all their endeavors. With this, I bid you farewell. I am safe and sound here, thank God. Pavel Ivanov Openkin.”



\[The family associated with this letter seemed to be managing without the son who was in the army. But the loss of a critical family member to the military or to death could bring a crisis in a household’s economy. This, in turn, led to the need to beg, and some of the beggars, as Semyonova points out, especially outsiders to the village such as Gypsies and blind men, could be a source of sexual disorder. In this connection, she records a humorous story about the blind men.\]

Beggars are usually old people and children, and to a lesser extent young and middle-aged women. Children begin begging as early as the age of six. Children and other members of a peasant family resort to begging when there is not enough food in the house and no means to procure it. When a family has to send one of its own to beg for the first time, it usually does so with tears and lamentations.

There are also permanent beggars. These include single, homeless old men and women, cripples, blind people, imbeciles, and village fools. Sometimes these wretches are not from the poorest families, but being unable to work, they are sent to beg so as to be of some use to their households. Homeless beggars, both men and women, usually find a poor family and in return for lodgings share with the family some of their daily take. I knew one “simpleton,” about forty years of age, a huge man of nearly seven feet, who because of his condition was doing quite well in soliciting donations. He lived in a poor family composed of a father, mother, and two children. This “holy fool,” who was nicknamed Kupolai,9 was having an intimate relationship with the woman of the house. The family treasured him as a source of income, yet when he died, they did not bother to bury him and instead sought out a distant relative of his in another village to do the job.

According to stories told by the peasants, the real Don Juans among the beggars are the blind men, who make their rounds with boys as their seeing-eye guides. The blind men sing religious verses and stay for the night wherever they find hospitality. So some of our “Ivans” are the product of such liaisons; one might be the child of a blind man, another of a Gypsy, or yet another of a holy fool or of a drunkard pretending to be a holy fool. Not long ago, no more than five years back, Gypsies would make camp for the winter in the villages and move in with peasant families. This practice has since been forbidden. Peasant women really go for Gypsy men.

## Boccaccio à la russe

“Those blind fellows are real stallions. Wild, that’s what they are\! It is simply indescribable how they beat the boys they employ as seeing-eye guides. A woman can’t pass by, but they order the boys to grab hold of her.

“There was this one blind man who beat his guide boy so hard that the boy decided to bring him a mare instead of a woman. When the blind fellow mounted the mare from behind, it kicked him right in the face and sent him flying. And what did he say? ‘She’s real hot, I’ve never seen a woman so wild in my life\!’”

\[Excessive consumption of hard liquor might also be seen as a form of disorder, but it was so integral a part of Russian peasant life, as we have already seen, that it can also be understood as belonging to the normal rhythm of daily life.\]

Drinking is a temptation no one can withstand. Prodigious amounts of alcohol are consumed at wedding parties. I myself have attended weddings at which nine-and ten-year-old girls were made to drink so that they would dance for everyone’s entertainment. Reportedly they make the boys drink “for fun,” too. Most youngsters start drinking on a dare.

There are some occasions at which drunkenness is required by tradition. For example, young men are expected to drink before they are drafted. Men who are scheduled to appear at the drafting station in late fall are called “able-bodied” \(*godnye*\). In the period following the field-work season and up to the time of their conscription, the “able-bodied” young men are supposed to enjoy themselves. When their own money runs short, their families supply them with funds to continue their merriment. All the “able-bodied” men of a village go around together having their good time. Anyone who does not keep up with the others is considered “dishonored,” and to avoid this, a young man will sacrifice even his and his family’s last kopeck. The revelry takes place both in the tavern and in the streets, and is accompanied by much rowdiness. All the “able-bodied” men are supposed to carry accordions, which they play all night long, right up to sunrise. With this accompaniment to their drunken singing, the whole crowd stalks around the village, smashing window panes and indulging in most unseemly pranks. These capers are regarded with tolerance. “What’s the uproar going on outside?” someone will ask. “Oh, it’s just the ‘able-bodied’ men making merry …,” and the term “able-bodied men” both explains and justifies everything. Frequently the “able-bodied” engage in a game of pitch and toss, although this activity is banned by the authorities.

The best occasion for young people to get drunk for the first time is the annual festival, which in this region takes place in connection with St. Michael’s Day. On that holiday, every person in the parish is drunk. In a good year the festival lasts for a week, but even when the crops are poor, people manage to go on a spree for three days. There is also a great deal of drinking at Shrovetide. This is the time for traveling to visit relatives, and for riding troikas. Accidents abound in the springtime \[as a result of drunkenness\]. Some people drown in water-filled ravines. Others are crushed under falling wagons; a drunken peasant will have a wagon tip over on him, and that is the end of him. Considerably less drinking occurs on Christmas and Easter.

At a fair I witnessed a woman \(a widow\) walking with her drunken boyfriend, a farm laborer, who, predictably, was squeezing out a tune on his accordion. The woman, too, was drunk and heading back to the tavern for a drink. When her thirteen-year-old daughter accosted her and reproached her for spending their money on alcohol and degrading herself, the woman’s companion reacted violently and beat the girl so mercilessly that it was pitiful to watch. And none of the men lifted a finger to stop him. The women alone reacted by howling.

A young man may be introduced to heavy drinking during the street parties. Street parties provide a brisk trade for the bootleg establishment that is invariably operated in every village, usually by some widow. The drinks are served in a shkalik, a medium-sized glass containing approximately two ounces. A moderate drinker will order two or three shkaliks in a row. Peasants claim they drink “to drown their sorrows” or “to ease their troubled minds.” Frequently vodka becomes indispensable for them. At meetings of the village council, it is customary to take turns paying for drinks. When visiting someone’s house, a peasant will be pleased with the refreshments only if a fair amount of alcohol is served. Snacks are of much less concern. Peasants are naturally more willing to drink while on a visit or in a tavern than at home. When there is a bootleg establishment in the village, men are not likely to drink at all at home, except at family occasions, such as weddings and baptismal dinners.

Drinking also accompanies delivery of the first load of grain for grinding. The miller provides the liquor, for which he is repaid with grain. Another occasion for general drunkenness is seasonal field work for the landlord \(usually mowing and transportation of produce to town\), who by way of payment treats the peasants to refreshments. On these occasions dreadful fights break out and can result in maiming or even killing with a scythe. When the oats are taken to town for sale, the occasion is celebrated with drinking. Needless to say, service in the army is also a school for drinking. When a group of young horseherds includes a few older boys, say about age sixteen or seventeen, they instruct the younger ones to steal liquor from home when their parents are away. The loot is then shared by all, not infrequently including boys ten to twelve years old.

\[This discussion of drink leads naturally to a consideration of peasant diet and drinking in connection with it.\]

During the field-work season, a peasant gets up very early. After bowing before the icon and praying “My Lord Jesus Christ, in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost. Amen,” he sets out to work. But sometimes he leaves right away for work and just makes the sign of the cross along the way. Prayers are also said before the night rest, which lasts two or three hours. Peasants begin mowing on an empty stomach, before breakfast when the sun is not up yet. Occasionally the grain is harvested at night under the full moon, when the dew and the cold keep the ears from shedding their seeds. At seven or eight in the morning, peasants return home and have their breakfast, consisting of potatoes and bread. During the work season, peasants are happy for the chance to drink one or two shkaliks of vodka for refreshment at breakfast, dinner, and supper. If there is a tavern in the village, peasants drop in there after breakfast and have their shkalik before they return to the field, where they work until the noon dinner break.

Dinner consists of cabbage soup, porridge \(kasha\), or, again, potatoes and bread. The soup, of course, has no meat in it, just cabbage, but occasionally sour cream is added. Potatoes are mixed with kvass and onions. The porridge—usually millet—is eaten either with milk, in what is known as the thin form \(*kulesh*\), or in a thicker form made with hemp-seed oil. After dinner, the peasants take a rest and then return to the fields. They take along some bread for an afternoon snack sometime between three and five o’clock. When the sun sets, the peasants go home, and at about nine in the evening they eat their supper, which is warmed-over dinner, with the possible addition of skim milk.

On Sundays and holidays peasants stay in bed till late and get up only before mass. \(An exception is made, however, when it is hot at harvest time and the crops need to be cut promptly before they dry out. At these times, peasants work on Sundays as well.\) Peasants attend mass at the nearest village with a church \(*selo*\). On the way they may find time to visit a tavern and down a shkalik or two. I do not believe that in church the peasants are occupied with thoughts about the mass and God: they are burdened with too many other worries, especially during the field-work season. Peasants are a bit intimidated by the priest, who is much given to sermonizing about and denouncing his parishioners’ indolence and lack of concern for God’s temple, sometimes while pointing at negligent parishioners and reminding them of their various sins. After the service, abstemious peasants go home, while others head for the tavern, where everyone gets drunk. The more sober peasants eat dinner at home, rest, and then “just sit” till the evening, talking about their affairs and discussing the harvest and related subjects. Yet even back in the home village, there are opportunities to have a drink, and it is unlikely that a peasant will let a Sunday go by without having one. In the evening, women get a feeling for the amount of alcohol consumed by their husbands by the intensity of the beatings they receive. Then everything is quiet. The next morning a heavy head reminds them of the day before.

In winter peasants get up at six A.M. and feed the livestock. The rest of the time passes mostly in slumber, unless there is some threshing or weaving of bast shoes to do.

Foods that can be found on a peasant’s table only during the annual festival, or during a wedding or baptismal dinner, include pancakes \(*bliny*\), meat \(veal designated for holidays—*uboina*\), potato fritters \(*drachena*\), buns \(*pyshki\), salamata* \(a kind of thin gruel\), *kalinnik* \(a kind of cake\), fritters \(*olad’i*\), and cabbage soup with corned beef \(*solonina*\).

During a famine, peasant meals consist of stale bread moistened in water and mixed with goosefoot. The men make extra efforts to find any type of work, and sometimes the entire family goes out to beg. As soon as the snow melts, hungry children pick roots and herbs to eat, such as sorrel and clover. Peasants also make soup with goutweed \(*Aegopodium podagraria*\).

\[Sickness was a frequent visitor in peasant homes, and for the most part peasants treated themselves with home remedies or sought the help of a village healer, who would employ incantations, physical manipulation, or herbal cures. Semyonova in her few notes about disease emphasizes the links between illness, diet, and work.\]

Fever is very common in our parts. Among the non-epidemic and non-contagious diseases, most common is indigestion resulting from excessive drinking or from returning to meat and milk products at the end of a fast. Peasants contract a very acute strain of this illness that is accompanied by a stomachache and a pain in the pit of the stomach, with colic and vomiting. A peasant who is suffering these severe symptoms tends to think that he is going to die and sends for a priest. In the work season, peasants often catch colds and lose their voices \(“My whole chest is blocked up,” they report\) because they drink cold water when they are overheated.10 Flushed with heat and “assaulted by thirst,” as the peasants say, they cannot seem to get enough to drink and will take water from any source available. They drink from a roadside ditch, from a muddy puddle, from a swamp, wherever they can find some water to quench their thirst. Tapeworms and roundworms are common among peasants. In the fall, the water in the river is literally poisoned by hemp that is soaked there until the first frosts. There are cases of poisoning with this water. In the fall, women frequently catch chills when bathing sheep in the cold water prior to shearing.

\[As for grooming and washing,\]11 married women comb their hair once every six weeks. Some of them may do it every three weeks. Teenage girls sometimes comb their hair every day, but in any case once a week. They wash their hands once a day without soap. They wash in the morning and dry themselves off with their sleeves, the hems of their skirts, or their aprons. Unmarried women wash with soap morning, noon, and evening. Sometimes mothers wash their children with water that they first put in their mouths to warm up. They do not rinse out their mouths \[after eating\]. Every Saturday they crawl into the stove \[for a kind of sauna\], and occasionally they bathe in the barn with hot water.

2. On the role of the men in distancing themselves from these decisions on life and death, see the introduction to this book. Similar behavior by families in poor Third World countries of the present day has been recorded by sociologists. See, for example, Susan C. M. Scrimshaw, “Infant Mortality and Behavior in the Regulation of Family Size,” *Population and Development Review*, 4:3 \(September 1978\), 383-403; Monica Das Gupta, “Selective Discrimination against Female Children in Rural Punjab, India,” *Population and Development Review*, 13:1 \(March 1987\), 77-100; Nancy Scheper-Hughes, “Culture, Scarcity, and Maternal Thinking: Maternal Detachment and Infant Survival in a Brazilian Shantytown,” *Ethos*, 13:4 \(Winter 1985\), 281-304.

3. For a recent study of the unenviable position of a Russian daughter-in-law, see Beatrice Farnsworth, “The Litigious Daughter-in-Law: Family Relations in Rural Russia in the Second Half of the Nineteenth Century,” *Slavic Review*, 45:1 \(Spring 1986\), 49-64.

4. A Russian folklorist found that about 8 percent of her collection of thousands of lullabies were songs wishing death on babies, presumably weak infants like those mentioned here whose survival was uncertain and who may have been in pain. A. N. Martynova, “Otrazhenie deistvitel’nosti v krest’ianskoi kolybel’noi pesne,” *Russkii fol’klor*, 15 \(Leningrad, 1975\), 145-55.

5. Here Semyonova is referring to a scene in Tolstoy’s play *The Power of Darkness*, in which the peasants kill an illegitimate baby and attempt to hide the evidence by burying the corpse in their cellar. L. N. Tolstoi, *Polnoe sobranie sochinenii* \(Moscow, 1913\), 14:51-52.

6. For the average rates of child survival in late imperial Russia and the causes of infant death, see my “Infant Care Cultures in the Russian Empire,” in *Russia’s Women: Accommodation, Resistance, Transformation*, cited earlier.

8. The letter, as we learn below, is really written to his entire family.

9. A “holy fool” \(*iurodivyi*\) is a person thought to be endowed by God with the power to foretell the future. The nickname given to this holy fool means “cupola” and refers to his height, as high as a church cupola. Peasants often referred to one another, and not just to eccentric persons, by nicknames that were associated with their physical appearance.

10. Even today Russians seem to think that drinking cold water when one is overheated will cause colds and other illnesses. The cause of illness is no doubt the unclean sources of the cold water, as suggested two sentences below, but the association in the minds of the people was \(and is\) with the temperature of the water.

11. The following passage is from Semyonova’s unpublished field notes in Arkhiv AN SSSR, f. 906, op. 1, d. 26, 1. 332.
