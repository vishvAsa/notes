It's interesting to note that European Russians can have upto 11-13% North East Asian (Uralic) ancestry easily. Russians, Finns, Estonians are all a mix of Northern Europeans + Uralic Asians. Russians are unique in being Indo-European speakers in Europe with Uralic ancestry, just like Hungarians are Uralic speakers without any Uralic ancestry. Estonians and Finns have about 4-7% Uralic ancestry. Saamis from Finland have about 25-30% which is the highest amount of Uralic DNA in modern Europe.

The specific "Slavic" look of Russians probably comes from this Uralic DNA. Belorussians and Ukrainians seem to entirely lack this Uralic DNA.

Celtics, North Germanics and North Slavs (East + West Slavic) all have about the same amount of Steppe Yamnaya ancestry at about 47-50%. The highest in Europe.
