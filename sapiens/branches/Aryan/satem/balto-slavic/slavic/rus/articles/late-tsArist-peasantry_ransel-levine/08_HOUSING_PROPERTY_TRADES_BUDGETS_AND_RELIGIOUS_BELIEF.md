*This chapter begins with a description of peasant living quarters, but Semyonova quickly gets caught up in telling about the stifling atmosphere of houses heated by “black stoves.” \(Such chimneyless homes, called in Russian “smokey houses”* \[kurnye izby\], *were quite common in central and especially northern Russia until the end of the nineteenth century.\) Note that the principal fuel in this instance was straw, because Semyonova’s village was in the lightly forested Black Earth region. Here the roofs were often thatched, and chimneyless stoves may have been a necessity because burning straw could drift up the flue and land on the thatched roof*.

*In the discussion of fire protection that follows, Semyonova tells of the willow trees that furnished a protective barrier against the raging fires that all too regularly consumed Russian villages and towns. The willows had dual and discrepant uses: when alive and green, they formed a screen against flying embers, and \(as we read in the court cases cited by Semyonova in chapter 10\) when cut and dried out, they served as ignitable fuel*.

*The next section treats the division of tasks and goods between husband and wife. No formal study of the Russian peasantry can provide a precise division of such things, for each village had its own customs. We can nevertheless see from Semyonova’s description of her village that Russian women, even if ideology placed them in a strictly subordinate position, controlled assets of their own and were by no means simply slaves to their husbands*.

*The information in this chapter about the lending of cows between rich and poor peasants and stories in the next chapter about well-off peasants \(kulaks\) giving interest-free loans suggest that the crude opposition often seen in peasant studies between exploitative kulaks and their poor exploited neighbors is overdrawn. Households of unequal wealth were able to work out arrangements that provided mutual benefits. Conversely, Semyonova reports cases of naked coercion used against persons who refused to support the local political boss or who could not pay their taxes on time, situations that were taken advantage of by some wealthy peasants. The stories in the next chapter, however, make clear that poor peasants also had ways of getting back at better-off neighbors for whom they had no sympathy. In other words, no simple model can capture the complex lines of solidarity and hostility that marked the relations among village households*.

*With regard to the peasants’ unwillingness to engage in more drudgery than it took to meet the needs of their household, which Semyonova mentions here and elsewhere, students may want to look into the ideas of the Russian economist A. V. Chayanov, who constructed an elaborate and influential theory of peasant economy based on the idea that peasant behavior was different from that assumed by classical economists*.1

*When Semyonova turns to the division of family property at the time of the separation of some members, her discussion can be better understood if one recalls that the large Russian peasant family was composed of a mother and father and their grown sons, together with the wives and children of the sons. Two, three, or more nuclear families might reside in a single household, and personal conflict or lack of space could and did regularly require the separation of one or more of the nuclear units*.

*The budget included in this chapter is not that of the kind of joint family just described but of a three-generational stem family \(in which the oldest generation has been truncated by the death of the husband\). The expenses for this family slightly outrun its income, but as the children grow older and begin to contribute to household production, the balance sheet is likely to move into the black. Note, too, that the budget includes payments to the priest and the church. Although her editors did not include any more about this in the published account, I found in Semyonova’s archive a breakdown of payments and other demands for money and goods that the priest made of his parishioners, and I have included this material in the chapter. It is clear from her comments about these payments and from her published notes that follow in which she compares the priest to the local folk healers that Semyonova shared the Russian intelligentsia’s contempt for the Russian clergy*.

*Finally, Semyonova speaks of the peasants’ belief in higher powers, and she compares their ideas of the tsar and of God. She concludes that their most deeply held beliefs in supernatural power continue to be those associated with the religious and magical notions of pre-Christian Russia*.





Houses have equal sides that measure from fourteen to twenty-one feet. There are two windows. The entryway \(*sentsa*\) is usually built with thin, low-quality logs. Just opposite the door from the main room into the entryway is another door leading into the yard. If an entryway is wide enough, it is used for storing horse collars and women’s trunks. To the left of the door leading into the house is a bench known as a *konnik* \(also *ikonnik* or *okonnik*\). Another bench runs along the adjoining wall, the one with the windows in it, and is the longest bench in the house \(*peredniaia lavka*\). In the corner where these two benches meet, the icons are placed on a shelf. One more bench stands along the wall opposite the entrance and is called a *sudnik*. In the far right-hand corner there is a whitewashed brick stove with a sleeping shelf \(*lezhanka*\) running along its top. Stoves with chimneys are called “white,” while chimneyless stoves are referred to as “black.” When a “black” stove is being lighted, the door from the main room into the entryway is left open so that the smoke up to the level of the door is drawn out, but above that level it forms a blue and white blanket through which nothing can be seen. The top of the door is no higher than a rather short person, so that one has to stoop to enter the house \(the ceiling itself is only 5’10” high\). A good-sized man finds it difficult to stand up when the stove is being fired, because his eyes will be in the caustic cloud of smoke. Even when seated on a bench, one feels the acrid smoke in the eyes. I myself cannot stay more than ten minutes inside a house while the stove is being fired, but peasants get used to it. Some old people do not even climb down from the top of the stove when it is being lighted; they lie there right in the thick smoke—but they probably have their eyes closed. When the fuel has burned up, the stove door is closed and, as the peasants avow, “it’s warm as toast in here.” Peasants believe “black” stoves are much warmer than the “white” ones. I do not know if this is true, but I can say that the smoke continues to irritate one’s eyes long after the stove door has been shut.

Peasants use straw for fuel. Rye straw is the best for this purpose; the straw of oats and millet is of much poorer quality. Peasants bring straw in at night to sleep on, and then in the morning they feed this straw into the stove. The use of fresh straw each day provides reasonably hygienic bedding for the peasants. But this is so only in years of abundant harvest. In a bad year, whatever little straw they have is given to the livestock; sometimes even straw roofs have to be pulled down to save the animals from starvation. The shortage of straw forces peasants to use their clothes for bedding and to heat the house with dried manure or weeds such as burdock, thistle, and nettles. Accordingly, illnesses increase in such a year. The lack of fresh bedding is one cause. The poor fuel likewise does much damage to the eyes. In the drought years of 1891–1892, around ten people in two of our small villages \(each containing about fifteen households\) lost their eyesight temporarily or permanently from the smoke of their stoves. The smoke, which was produced by burning dried manure and weeds found on the roadside and in ravines, was so acrid that the victims \(mostly old people and children\) developed cataracts. All of them were admitted to the regional hospital in town, but three of them never got their eyesight back.2

Manure, in addition to being used in lean years as fuel for home heating, is mixed with clay and made into building blocks for clay-walled houses. \[For these reasons, among others,\] poor peasants fertilize their land very little, spreading no more than twenty cartloads of manure.

Back to the house.

The stretch of the wall from the stove to the wall with the entrance door is also lined with a bench \(*zadnik*\), which in the corner joins another bench \(*pridelok*\) that runs up to the entrance door. Next to the protruding corner of the stove there is a post \(the same height as the entrance door\) that supports a beam, the other end of which rests on the log forming a lintel just above the door. The space between this beam and the wall running parallel to it is covered with planks to form a kind of raised platform or loft, on which older members of the family and small children sleep. The rest of the family is accommodated on the sleeping shelf atop the stove and on the benches lining the walls of the house. In the left-hand corner opposite the entryway stands a table. Normally a peasant’s house has one or two short portable benches that are brought to the table for dinner and supper. The floor is made of either hard-packed earth or wooden planks \(rough or finished\). If of planks, these are supported by joists and run across the house parallel to the entrance-door wall. In a floor made of boards, there is usually an opening through which a ladder leads into a pit dug out under the house where potatoes are stored. Above the bench opposite the entrance door, shelves are mounted on the wall to store dishes. Ceiling boards run parallel to the wall with the windows and are supported by a beam that rests on the walls. On the attic side these boards are coated with clay and a layer of dry leaves, and topped off with earth. The roof is supported by rafters and angle brackets. Wattles across the rafters form a base for brushwood, which is then thatched. The lintel is hewn as the walls are being erected, but the door frame and window frames are purchased separately.

In the past, wooden houses were made chiefly of oak, but nowadays willow wood is more often used. Numerous masonry houses are also found, accounting for more than half the homes in a few villages. The clay-walled type of house is becoming increasingly common as we see more and more family divisions and splitting up of property \[so that people live in smaller families but with fewer resources\]. Many peasants now have neither a threshing barn, a shed, nor even a yard of their own.

Both the masonry and clay-walled houses have the same inside layout as a wooden home. A clay-walled house is built in the following manner: four posts are set to form a square; the spaces between the posts are boarded up with thick planks or logs, and then plastered on both sides with clay. Lastly the house is whitewashed inside and out. The yard, which is also square and measures between twenty-three and fifty-eight feet on a side, is enclosed with a wattle fence and covered with a straw awning. The corners of the yard are boarded up to form pens for livestock. There can be from one to four pens. Plows, carts, harrows, and sleighs are stored under the awning.

If a house has only one “shell” \(*srub*\), which is most often the case, then the owner also has a shed or small cabin for storing grain, flour, clothing, footwear, his wife’s trunks, and other household items. These sheds or barns are quadrangular structures measuring eight to sixteen feet on a side. They have small windows facing the main house, which is to say the street, for sheds are normally erected opposite the houses so that a row of houses and a row of sheds define a street. In front of the sheds and the houses, willow trees are planted as a fire-safety measure, and a village constable makes sure the peasants maintain this foliage. The willows can reach considerable size and lend a very picturesque aspect to some villages. Inside the sheds, benches line the walls, and shelves are fitted above the benches. Peasants sleep in the sheds during the spring, summer, and fall. For ordinary peasants, these sheds, or small barns, are usually clay-walled, although some log structures also exist, while the rich peasants known as kulaks build masonry sheds and outfit them with metal roofs and iron-plated doors.



This picture of a brick masonry home was taken by the author, Olga Semyonova, presumably in the village of Muraevnia. Noted the covered yard to the left and the trees screening the house, which are included in her written description. From *Rossiia, Polnoe geograficheskoe opisanie*, vol. 2, p. 179.

Vegetable patches and threshing barns are located behind the yards. A village constable enforces an ordinance requiring that threshing barns be at least two hundred feet away from the houses and, again, surrounded by willows. Like the houses, threshing barns are covered with thatched roofs; the roof framing, however, is supported by studs rather than by rafters as in a house. The threshing goes on in the threshing barns in the winter, and also in the summer during rainy weather. You enter the barn through a gate, which when closed leaves the inside very dark. In the summer, to avoid flies, peasants sleep on the straw floor of the threshing barn.

Every house has an outdoor cellar that is constructed nearby and has a thatched gable roof. A door and a flight of stairs lead inside. A cellar is used for storage of milk, radishes, beets, cabbage, pickled apples, and salted beef.

In winter, if it is cold in the pens outside, the sheep are kept in the main house, as are the cows and pigs that have given birth, along with their calves and piglets. Chickens make their winter roost under the awning in the yard.

\[Fire was a great scourge of Russian villages, and arsonists were punished harshly.\] Peasants prefer to deal with arsonists themselves. If peasants catch an arsonist in the act, they beat him so brutally that within a few hours he is dead. This fall, a man who had allegedly set fire to the same village six times in the course of the year but was never caught in the act was found in a ravine with his head smashed in. Considering the horror of a village fire, one can understand peasants’ rage at arsonists. There is nothing more terrifying than a night fire in a village. I know of cases in which several members of a family perished when they could not get out of a burning house. A lot of livestock is lost in these fires as well. Wattle yards with thatched awnings light up like gunpowder, especially in dry weather, leaving only embers from the animals inside. I myself have seen sheep and pigs, suffocated by smoke, popping inside a burning yard and turning into a charred, shapeless mass. I will never forget one such night when a fire was raging through the peasants’ homes and yards, wiping out innocent animals, and in front of a house that had just started to burn lay the emaciated body of a small girl, illuminated by the fire. She had died of diarrhea only hours before the fire started, and her mother had managed to rescue the body from the conflagration.

\[At another point in her notes, Semyonova tells of an arsonist who was treated differently. Apparently his act did not have devastating consequences. The punishment of expulsion was nevertheless stern; a peasant without a community is truly an orphan.\]

At the peasant assembly of the village of Karavaevo a week ago, an arsonist was expelled from the community. The man in question was a thirty-five-year-old bachelor who had lived with his married elder brother. \[This was the second time he was in trouble.\] He had already been to prison for another escapade. That occurred when he proposed to a young woman from the same village, with whom he had probably been intimate \(but who can know these things for sure?\). When she turned him down, he decided to “show” her. One night he got into the storage room in the young woman’s home, pulled all of her clothes out of her trunk, and shredded them to pieces. Then he defecated in the trunk. While he was in prison, the woman married another man, and people assure me that it is a good marriage.3

## Distribution of Property and Duties between the Spouses

The husband owns the house, grain, horses, sheep, and agricultural implements. His funds pay for the house and fenced yard, the main barn, and the threshing barn, and he buys the horses and other livestock, plus wagons and the like. He also buys grain, cereals, beef, cabbage, salt, kerosene \(“gas”\), and straw for kindling. He is responsible for making bast shoes for the entire family, as well as making ropes and providing everyone with felt boots.

The wife purchases household items, such as bowls, plates, pots, spoons, rolling pins, oven forks, threshing flails, soap, and barrels. From her own supplies of cloth, she makes her husband mittens, scarves, belts, worsted material for his peasant vest \(*pod-dyovka*\), and foot cloths \(*onuchi*\). Men sow flax and women harvest it. The women keep the fiber from the flax crops; the seeds go to the men. Women always try to pick flax while some green is still on it, when the seeds are not yet ripe and the fibers are of better quality. Scutching the flax is usually a woman’s job. All the women in a family share the fiber they have picked, dividing it equally in small sheaves. Women always have a need for flax. The amount they pick never seems to be enough, so they try to procure it elsewhere as well. Landlords let peasant women pick flax on the following terms: women pay six to ten rubles to pick a desiatina \(2.7 acres\) of flax. They scutch the flax and keep the fibers, while the landlord gets the seeds. For this work, a woman normally joins forces with her mother \(or with her aunt if her mother is not available\). The young woman harvests the plant, and her mother stores it and prepares it for spinning.

A woman also clothes her husband, herself, and their children from head to toe, the only exception being in the case of boots, which the husband makes, or has made, for himself at his own expense. A wife provides her husband with sacking for household needs. In addition, she has to buy with her own money a loom, a spinning wheel and hackle, along with the plank on which a spinner sits and into which a hackle or tow is inserted \(*dontse*\), and scutches, plus the trunk in which she keeps her personal possessions.

Women’s wages are distributed in the following way: during the summer work season, the husband takes the pay for any piecework his wife may do, while she keeps any wages she earns at day labor. In some villages, however, both piecework payments and day-labor wages of a wife are given to her husband. Mowing is also included in the summer work season. For the rest of the year, a woman keeps her wages from both day labor and piecework. Spouses continually argue about work. For example, a husband may have made an agreement with the landlord to mow his hay and haul it to the barn, but his wife balks, claiming that some domestic chore is more important, and the husband has to turn down the job. Sometimes, at the height of the work season when the landlord is prepared to pay high wages for harvesting a crop, all the women refuse to go out and bind sheaves, preferring to stay at home and lie on the stove. “I don’t care if my husband loses money, I’m not going to go out binding for him. I’ve got plenty to do here at home, what with having to clothe him and all.” \(This gives some idea of the problems a big landlord faces when he has to get a crop in on time in these conditions.\)

Theft between the spouses is not uncommon. It may be the husband who steals money from his wife’s trunk for some “need” of his or just to enjoy himself at a tavern. Or the wife might take some flour or grain from her husband and use it to pay for soap or some satin cloth at the store. When a husband is drunk, his wife will slip his wallet out of his boot. Children, too, steal eggs or anything handy from their mothers. Wives swipe wool from their husbands.

Pigs are the husband’s property, while chickens naturally belong to the wife. The husband takes care of the horse, and the wife tends to the cow. The cow is considered to be a wife’s possession, if not quite her property. Such a substantial acquisition as a cow usually requires monetary contributions from both the husband and the wife.

The following practice is common with the cows. Let’s say a better-off peasant has a cow and a heifer. When the cow again calves, this heifer is a burden, since the peasant has to feed it. The heifer is therefore given to a poorer peasant on the basis of an oral agreement that he can use the milk of the heifer \(as well as of two or three other heifers that he “adopts”\) until it grows into a cow.4 The cow is then returned to its owner. If it dies while still in the custody of the poorer peasant, the owner receives the hide. For the peasant who has use of the cow, it is known as a “cow out of heifers.” Sometimes it happens that toward the end of the period in which the peasant has use of the cow, he will say that he has no cow. \[And he might be asked,\] “What do you mean, no cow? I saw your wife the other day driving it in from the pasture.” “Well, yes, but that’s just a cow out of heifers.”

The sheep are common property. But sometimes the wife has her own sheep \[called *sobinki*, that is, “personal possessions”; they come as a part of her dowry\]. If a woman who owns such a sheep dies, her mother gets the animal if she takes the grandchildren in and cares for them. Otherwise, the dead woman’s daughter inherits it, but it would never go into the common family property under the control of the husband. When a woman is unable to feed one of her sheep in the winter, she will turn it over temporarily to a poorer peasant, and by way of compensation he keeps the lamb that the sheep delivers in the spring. He, however, is not permitted to take the wool of the sheep.

Wool from the sheep that are common property of the family as a whole is distributed to males and females in a seasonal rotation. Wool shorn in the spring is divided among the women, and wool from the fall shearing goes in equal shares to the men. Sheepskins from the common stock are the property of the men, and they are under no obligation to furnish their wives with winter clothing.

I cannot say that peasants treat their livestock especially well. Horses are routinely beaten. Yet a peasant feels very upset if a horse dies, because this is a great financial loss. A woman reacts the same way to the loss of a cow. When a horse or a cow, or even a sheep, dies, women “wail.” In fact, they wail when anything is lost or stolen from their farms. I once heard a peasant woman “wailing” over a pair of half-boots \(*koty*\) that she lost returning from the fair.

## Division of Family Property at Time of Household Partition

Partitions are usually caused by women quarreling about the children—but not always. The head of household may evict one of the family members for not contributing enough to the budget. This usually happens when the person in question has a job somewhere else \[and is not sending money home\]. Sometimes a family just grows so large that it has to break up because of limited space.

When a family decides to arrange a division, they inform the village “elder” \(*starosta*\), who then calls a meeting of the village council \(*skhod*\). The role of those present at the meeting is not to determine the distribution of property but merely to evaluate the property and observe the allocation of it, which the family does itself by casting lots. The council also draws up for approval by the township administration an official declaration confirming the distribution of family possessions.

The division proceeds essentially as follows: let’s say the entire property has been estimated at 355 rubles 15 kopecks \(each item is appraised separately\). One party is to receive the house, worth 80 rubles, another party the main barn and the threshing barn, worth 45 and 30 rubles respectively. Lots are cast to see who gets the house, and that party pays the 5-ruble difference to the other party. The rest of the property—buildings, tools, livestock—is likewise divided by casting lots.

When the division is over, the family returns home. After saying a prayer, they cut a loaf of bread in the middle, each party receiving half. If only one or two members move out, they receive not half a loaf but only a slice of bread. This is the source of the expression “a lopped-off piece” \[meaning a family member who has voluntarily or forcibly been separated from the household\]. After this, both parts of the family kiss goodbye, occasionally crying, and finally part.

Bread plays a central role in the peasant household and in all the events of peasant life. Only in periods of famine and when a priest’s visit is expected is bread missing from the shelf. In the first case, it is plainly not available, and in the second, it is removed to safekeeping away from “covetous eyes.”

## Budget

## Subsidiary Trades of Peasants

Cottage trades in this region are practiced solely to meet domestic needs and include fulling of felt boots, sewing, shoemaking, carpentry, harnessmaking, thatching roofs, laying brick for houses and stoves, brick baking, and repairing accordions. The people who engage in these activities are also farmers, and so they perform many of these crafts rather poorly. Bricks, for example, are frequently irregular in shape and underbaked. The poor workmanship in this trade may, however, be a result of the fact that this line of work is relatively new here. It was only in the 1870s that bricks began to replace logs in the construction of peasant homes. On the other hand, the peasants have perfected the techniques for thatching roofs. Ditch digging, too, is well developed. In some counties, the entire male population of certain villages hire themselves out as ditch diggers. They work in artels6 and sometimes contract jobs far away from home. Carpenters also sometimes work in artels. In some villages women make lace.

\[As in other societies, in peasant Russia some trades were respected more than others. A few were contemned. Semyonova mentions one of these: flayers.\]

Flayers are peasants who strip the skin from dead or slaughtered animals. Peasants believe it to be an “unclean” occupation—so much so that others will not eat food from the same dish as a flayer.7 Flayers are also subjected to jokes and mockery. Every village has from two to four flayers among the peasants. Flaying a cow or a horse costs thirty to forty kopecks. Those who resort to this occupation are usually poor peasants, but some flayers are cripples, the simple-minded, and improvident landless men.

## Terms of Payment for Work

The phrase “Taking an advance payment from a landlord or merchant for future work” can describe the undertaking of a peasant family to sow and harvest from five to sixteen acres for a landlord in both the spring field and the winter field. A contract is drawn up to this effect and notarized at the township supervisor’s office. After this, a peasant receives in advance the entire sum for the work to be performed. If paid for in advance, the plowing, sowing, weeding, and harvesting of a crop cost the landlord from four and a half to five and a half rubles per desiatina \[2.7 acres\], whereas the same work will cost him from seven to twelve rubles if payment is made upon completion. Some landlords exploit peasants terribly by means of these advance payments. Yet peasants submit to this form of enslavement in order to pay taxes. They contract for the advance payments at just the time taxes come due: the months from August through December. \[See “Form of a Contract between Seasonal Employers and Peasants” in the appendix.\]

## Payments to the Priest

8

1. Wedding: six rubles cash, three bottles of vodka \(fifty-five kopecks per bottle\), two pounds of pretzels, a chicken, bread, and pies. For lighting of the chandelier and other candles in the church, about two rubles. This provides a “first-class wedding.”

2. Baptism: fifty kopecks, plus bread.

3. Funeral: three rubles \(but if candle holders and a high-quality shroud are used, the price could go as high as eight rubles\). Funeral for a child: seventy-five kopecks.

4. Office for the dead: ten kopecks.

5. Special mass: two rubles.

6. Confession: from five to twenty kopecks \(as you wish\).

7. Extreme unction: one and a half rubles \(with candles\).9

8. Prayers requested by the commune for rain: three or four rubles.

9. \[This number is skipped in the document\]

10. Cleansing ritual against mice: thirty to fifty kopecks. If a mouse falls into a tub of pickles, sauerkraut, or pickled apples, the woman of the house will nearly always summon the priest to perform a cleansing ritual. The mouse is plucked from the tub, and the priest proceeds to say a prayer over the tub, pass a cross over it three times, and then bite into a pickle or apple or try some of the sauerkraut. After this, the contents of the tub are again regarded as clean. \(A mouse, to the peasants’ way of thinking, is “foul” and “polluting” \[*nechist’*\].\)

12. Communal prayer for Easter: one ruble. The priest makes the rounds of his parishioners with a public prayer \(that is, a collection\) five times a year. At Easter, he receives forty-five kopecks, bread, and a pie from each household and an egg from each individual. At Christmas, he gets fifteen kopecks and a pie; at Epiphany, twenty-five kopecks, bread, and a pie; on the tsarist holy day, twenty kopecks, bread, and a pie; and at St. Nicholas Day in the spring,10 fifteen kopecks and a pie. It is typical that the collection for St. Nicholas Day, which was instituted fifteen years ago to pay for the restoration of the fence around the churchyard, was subsequently kept by the priest for himself. The money is divided among the priest and the other clerical staff, while the householders themselves distribute the offerings of bread by mutual agreement to the priest, the deacon, and the sub-deacon. The clergy normally use the bread collected at Easter as food for their horses. The bread is dried into hardtack and then softened in water when fed to the livestock. The eggs, which are hard-boiled, are salted and used by the priest to feed his farmhand \(peasants do not like these salted eggs\).

Some priests simply go right up and take bread off the shelf in a peasant home, saying: “Well, I guess you baked that bread for me, didn’t you?” This is the reason the peasants hide their bread from the priest’s prying eyes.

When a peasant owes a debt to the clergy, the priest puts pressure on him to pay as the opportunity presents itself, especially at weddings: “Pay me what you owe, and then I’ll do the wedding; otherwise I won’t do it.” And, indeed, he will refuse to do it. In one village in which the priest is adamant about debts, I know several instances in which his refusal to perform a marriage ceremony has led to cohabitation by unwed couples. In some villages, the clergy organizes obligatory memorial services \(every Saturday\), for which they exact one ruble a year per household. For entering a marriage in the official records of vital events \(*metrika*\), the priest takes two and a half rubles; this is paid by the bride. The groom pays for the wedding itself.11

Peasants consider a priest to be a sponger: “He just stands there, reads a prayer, and you have to give him a fifty-kopeck piece.”

As for witchcraft and goblins, werewolves, and the like, they are believed in least by the very persons who are considered to be sorcerers and witches, the peasants who do cures by reciting incantations and such. “Witchcraft” is a fairly lucrative occupation, and it is amusing to observe how a clever witch “acts out her role” in the village. I wish I could listen in when two “witches” were having a conversation and did not have to pretend in front of each other.

We have a witch like that in our village, a really audacious one, and it has occurred to me more than once that she might look upon the parish priest as her colleague, a fellow professional.

When the tsar was ill, the peasants asked me what he was suffering from, inquiring with some interest but also with complete equanimity. “You see, there he is the tsar and all; no one escapes illness. Of course, they have to go and call in the doctors.” \(A clear note of mistrust toward doctors can be heard in this statement.\) “Hear tell he’s not in Piter but at his country estate; if he dies there, won’t they be taking him, just as they did with his father, into Piter for burial?” “They said mass for the tsar—the priest was saying that they prayed for the tsar.” All this, I repeat, is said with complete composure in the course of the peasants’ daily chores. They speak with much greater animation about some wedding scandal in a nearby village. The tsar is far away—“at the other end of the earth,” off in a fog.

I have sometimes thought that a belief in the tsar, a belief that he is here in existence somewhere, ought to lend support to the peasants’ belief in God. For a peasant the tsar is as far away as God, and his existence is beyond question; so the existence of God, too, ought to seem more certain than it does to us \[educated people\].

The peasant God is something material, very much so, in fact. He is the giver of rain, of drought, health, and sickness. The tsar is a provider in case of need perhaps, the defender of our borders, of our land, which feeds the peasant. Among the mass of peasants, there is nothing mystical about their relationship to the tsar or to God, just as there is nothing mystical about their idea of an afterlife. They simply give no thought to an afterlife, just as they give no thought to the coming year. It is amazing how essentially irreligious they are\! It is only the old people when their health is failing who exhibit a confused fear in the face of “the life beyond the grave.” Here we see an ordinary association of their physical pain with what they assume will be the physical sufferings of hell. Can they really be considered Russian Orthodox? Not at all. They are confused, helpless, and terrified, and have no idea of what to do “to gain salvation.” “Who knows,” they say, “maybe the Freemasons or the Molokane \[sectarians known as ‘milk drinkers’\] have a better way to achieve salvation\!” How timid, uncertain, and full of doubt is this statement, uttered by gasping and coughing old folks\!

Both heaven and hell are understood purely in material terms. In hell people suffer physically for their sins, and in heaven their goodness is rewarded obviously with apples \(although the Molokane sect believes that heaven is a place where people sing hymns to God\). You only have to recall the usual formula in folktale references to heaven: “and he found himself in a Garden of Eden; the trees were leafy and green and heavy with apples.” The apple is the favorite peasant delicacy. People associate the idea of apples with something that does not demand the kind of heavy labor that growing grain does. Real paradise is a place where people do not have to sow and reap by the sweat of their brows.

It is said that our people cannot imagine a person “without God.” Perhaps it is so. I have heard peasants pose the question about many upper-class people who do not go to church: “What faith do they practice?” “Don’t they have their God?” The \[sectarians known as\] Flagellants have “their God.” \[In reference to people with a good standard of living, they might say:\] “Look how wealthy they are; He must give them that.” The word “give” is the crux of the matter, it seems to me. Every person needs his or her God as a personal benefactor.

It is in the notions associated with the land, with Moist Mother Earth, that you find the mystical side of the peasants. Here you see the residue of their ancient, separate worldview, which alas is much more deeply felt and poetic than our vaunted Russian Orthodoxy. Here are also the affecting “Radiant Sun,” “Bright Moon,” “Valiant Charger-Faithful Steed,”13 plus vivid and touching images of communion with nature, human sorrow, and orphanhood. It is not God whom the orphan girl asks to resurrect her parents so that they can give her their blessing as she goes off to be married, but instead Moist Mother Earth to whom she appeals to raise her mother from the grave. And, of course, Orthodoxy does not conform especially well to the peasant soul. And what is it that the peasant lacks in this regard? An awareness of his sinfulness is inborn in him. There is also a “spiritual thirst” \(which you see expressed at least in the church schisms\), but he has not one iota, and nowhere to obtain it, of any kind of “platonic” attachments or “platonic” interests. These are the conditions in which he exists, and is this not then the reason for his undisciplined behavior and drunkenness, the senseless daring of the young men \(the “able-bodied” draftees, for example\), and other such manifestations?

\[As for the peasants’ ideas about who is just and who will attain salvation,\]14 whether it is the poor people or the rich people, he will say that in most cases “the just” are the old people, and definitely not the rich. Yet it is harder for these just people to win salvation than it is for the rich. Merchants, for example, can always bequeath their money to the church or leave funds at a number of monasteries for prayers to be said in their memory, and in this manner “save their souls” and enter into heaven. In regard to life on earth, the poor “just” people are, of course, better.

The peasants hold to the notion that the Last Judgment will take three days. On the first day, the Lord will judge the monks and priests, on the second, the nobility and merchants, and on the third, the peasants. \(Antichrist will be born on the fourth day. He will lure the people with promises of “food, clothing, and shoes.”\) In general, peasants are impressed most by what is written in the Gospels about the Last Judgment, and their thoughts dwell mainly on that. “Oh,” they say, “how terrifying it will be\!”

3. The man’s act was more than vandalism; it was symbolic rape. A woman’s trunk is the container for her most cherished \(and sometimes only\) personal possessions. To enter this container and befoul it as was done here is an act of defilement just short of rape itself.

4. Something was apparently lost in the transcription of Semyonova’s text at this point. The passage reads literally that the peasant can use the milk from the heifer\(s\), but as that is clearly impossible \(a heifer is a young female cow that has not produced a calf; hence she would not yet be producing milk\), she may have meant that the new calf was given to the poor peasant and the cow went with it until the calf was weaned. Possibly, the poor peasant was managing a small herd of heifers, some of which he was breeding, but the first explanation appears more likely, since the Russian seems to refer to the new calf as the one that is a burden.
