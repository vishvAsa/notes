+++





*Most ethnographic accounts of Russian villagers in the nineteenth century indicate fairly strong sanctions against premarital intercourse. Standards for extramarital intercourse were more flexible for married women or even for unmarried women of the age of most married women. Attitudes apparently varied from place to place as well, and, as Semyonova’s descriptions reveal, they were changing rapidly in the late nineteenth century under the impact of migrant labor and rising age at first marriage*.

*Despite the power of men to force women to submit, some of the stories in this chapter demonstrate the degree of control that women could exercise over sexual relations and, as noted earlier in connection with the lying-over deaths of infants, the ultimate responsibility and control that women maintained in the area of family planning. I should, however, note that, although I have no evidence with which to challenge her story of the Easter Sunday infanticide, the account has a folkloric quality in its report of the murder of an innocent on the eve of Easter and its subsequent discovery \(resurrection\). Another Russian collector of ethnographic information at about the same time reported a popular story of a widow who became pregnant and killed her illegitimate child on Easter, though this story was embellished with many magical and surreal elements*.1

*At the close of the chapter, Semyonova discusses “wayward women” with words suggesting that, whereas in the past her villagers did not tolerate premarital relations among unengaged couples, a young woman with only one lover was no longer regarded as “wayward.” Even here she seems to refer to a village that was already under the influence of urban values; the story that follows about a remote village indicates rather severe sanctions against premarital pregnancy, suggesting again that attitudes varied widely. Pregnancy is different from sexual relations, it is true, but the moral stance in both cases would be closely related*.





The age at which girls start to consider Ivan “eligible,” that is, someone who is admitted to parties and dances and who can be an object of their “love,” usually depends on the boy’s looks and height. Sometimes a tall, handsome sixteen-year-old boy is considered a full-fledged “groom”—a boy who can bestow his favors on the girls—whereas an underdeveloped eighteen-year-old may be rejected. In general, short people are the objects of ridicule. Small men and women are given nicknames such as “birdie,” “runt,” “shrimp,” “puppy.” “A little dog is forever a pup,” the girls will mock a small, unattractive man.

In the past, there were quite a few inexperienced boys and girls, but nowadays “innocent” boys are not to be found, and even girls without experience are rather few. A boy of sixteen or seventeen years of age usually has a girlfriend. The two become acquainted, as a rule, at the spring or summer street gatherings and at evening parties. Beginning at Easter, girls gather outdoors for singing and dancing. From then until the start of winter, outdoor gatherings are held on all holidays and occasionally even on workdays. At the country \(round\) dances, boys choose girls and kiss them, dancing to the sound of a pipe and an accordion. They sometimes dance in pairs—the quadrille. When the older people have gone to bed, whoever chooses to do so goes off to the haystacks, the bushes, or the threshing barns, and there matters proceed to sexual relations. More or less the same thing happens at parties; young people might wander off to a barn or a shed.

Parents, of course, frequently upbraid and even whip their daughters for these liaisons. The boys, in contrast, are not punished. Boys naturally look upon premarital liaisons more lightly than girls, and boys frequently break off relations with the girls “they have loved.” But quite often these premarital affairs lead to marriage. In villages in which parents still adhere to the custom of arranging marriages and do not give their children a choice, young people become involved with the purpose of confirming their intention to get married. In these instances, parents agree more readily to their son’s choice if he tells them that he and his chosen one have already “sinned” and in this sense have pledged to be faithful unto death. If a boy has already proposed and the “bride-show” \(*smotriny*\)2 has taken place, then even the older folks look indulgently on premarital relations between the betrothed. Lately this is almost becoming the custom.

When a boy becomes intimate with a girl, he naturally assures her that he is going to marry her. But once in a while you run across a boy who is under the influence of city values and will make his real intentions clear to the girl right from the start: “I’ll love you only as long as I want to: no promises.” Most girls, however, hope to marry the boys they are going with.

If the youth is a live-in farm laborer, getting a woman is even easier, and usually a married one at that. If he is a farm laborer in a peasant’s household, he is likely to take up with one of the women of the house, a family member, and if he is working for a large landlord, his sweetheart may be a cook for the workers, a cattleyard worker, or the like. Hired cooks usually have the reputation of being “loose women.” I knew a woman about thirty years old who worked as a cook while her husband was away on seasonal work; she was said to be dating eight workers at a time. This sort of thing could happen only while the people were employed at the estate of a landlord \[and thus away from the scrutiny of their neighbors\]. People between the ages of sixteen and forty hire on for such seasonal jobs with large landlords. Each of the woman’s lovers knew well that there were seven others. Sometimes, when speaking calmly among themselves, they would decide that they should get together and teach her a lesson, but they never got around to carrying out this plan; she apparently knew how to soft-soap every one of them.

The street parties \(*ulitsa*\) are attended by girls from the whole village as well as by young women, especially those whose husbands are away. They dress up and at dusk go out to a pasture, thus distancing themselves from the supervision of the community \(*poriadok*\). They begin with some long drawn-out songs of the type sung in connection with country dances. These gatherings attract not only local girls but also young people from neighboring villages. If there is a landowner’s estate nearby, the farm laborers are among the first to arrive at the street party, together with female cooks, shepherdesses, and others. They come with accordions and shepherd’s pipes, which provide accompaniment for the dancing that takes place after they have gotten drunk. The more frantic the dancing becomes, the more daring are the verses women sing as accompaniment. “My husband is a devil, but I am not afraid of him.” “Oh what misery, with my husband Grigorii\! I’d even take a skinny one as long as his name is Ivan\!” “I did not give my sweetheart enough love, caressing him and kissing him.” Some women sing even more embarrassing ditties to the delight and cheers of the company. As it gets later, few people remain. One or two men, having “warmed up” at a bootleg liquor joint, dance to the music of the accordion. The rest disperse in pairs to the bushes and behind the barns. These parties sometimes continue until two in the morning, even though the field-work season may be on. The people nap for an hour or two and then go off to the field.

\[During the cold and inclement weather after the work season, the parties move indoors.\] These “evening parties” \(*vechorki, vecherinki*\) proceed as follows: the young women arrange with some widow or soldier’s wife who lives alone to use her house for the night, with one or two pints of kerosene offered as payment to cover lighting expenses. The parties are frequented by unmarried women, soldiers’ wives, and women whose husbands are away. Every party is presided over by an “elder” \(*starosta*\). This position is usually staffed by a boy in his late teens, or by a widow or a soldier’s wife. Women arrive first and start the singing. Then the men arrive and treat them to vodka and other refreshments they have brought, consisting usually of honey cakes, sunflower seeds, apples, sugar candies, and pretzels.

The company alternately sings, drinks, eats, dances, and plays the card game “War,” and group games with names such as “Monks,” “Neighbors,” and “Cossacks.” Essentially all these games amount to kissing. For example, in “Neighbors” the elder places men and women on benches in pairs at his own discretion, then approaches each pair and inquires whether they are happy with each other’s company. If, for example, the girl does not like her “neighbor,” she can request someone else’s company. The elder then says: “Since you are satisfied with one another, mow two oat fields for me,” or “measure me eight yards of lace” \(meaning two or eight kisses\). In the game “Monks,” men take turns leaving the room and knocking on the door. When the elder opens the door, the caller says: “Father Superior\! Give me a nun\!” whereupon the elder asks which nun is desired. The man whispers the name of a particular young woman. The elder then brings him the woman, and the two retire to the hallway for a brief kissing session.

Sometimes the parties break up violently. The young men drink too much and begin fighting, smashing window panes and dishes as well. Occasionally the hostess, too, gets beaten up.

The other day I heard a song that startled me. In a few words, it portrays everything that I gathered from my own observations and inquiries. I offer the story here as a very characteristic representation of village mores. It is a dance tune played at street parties:


Don’t delay, young woman,

Have fun while you may.

In the autumn you’ll be given away in marriage

And won’t enjoy such freedom anymore.

My worthless husband will climb on top of me

And abuse me.

He’ll get up and abuse me some more

And will swear at me and scorn me.

Aren’t you a dandy, Ivan,

I loved you,

And hid you out

Behind the tool rack back of the oven,

So that the old man wouldn’t know,

And would not go searching for you.

But he went looking around the closets,

And found you by the oven,

By the oven, behind the tool rack,

And grabbed you by the shoulders.

The cute little guy pined away,

What with no one to make love to:

To make love to a married woman—

You have to give her gold,

Make love to a soldier’s wife—

And she could get killed,

But to make it with a pretty maiden,

You have to play the dandy.


According to my observations, the young men who are most successful with the women are those who are “neatly dressed,” i.e., have a waistcoat, a jacket, top boots, and a nice peaked cap. They can also make a favorable impression by skillfully playing the accordion, by using certain polite or playful expressions \(nowadays every girl at the street parties is addressed as “miss”\), and perhaps by a display of ready wit. Previously, the dress of the young men was not as important as it has become. The young women liked curly-headed, rosy-complexioned, easy-going boys, and did not mind that they wore bast shoes. \[Nowadays\] men still are outfitted for everyday wear with clothes made at home: shirts, trousers, foot cloths, bast shoes, peasant vests \(*poddyovki*\), sheepskin coats. But on holidays, the men, especially the young ones, wear cotton shirts, trousers of lasting cloth, waistcoats \(*zhiletki*\) \(sometimes even a jacket and galoshes\), and tapered top boots. Felt boots \(*valenki*\) are home-made.

The most successful girls at the street gatherings are those who are cheerful and outgoing, and who can dance well. In the opinion of one landowner, the more indecently a girl behaves at the parties, the greater success she enjoys. Now, however, every girl has a special boyfriend whom she “loves” or “hangs out with,” and she waits for him to pick her out at the country dances. He gives her presents such as a cotton kerchief, a cheap ring or earrings, or a bar of aromatic soap, and he may treat her to sunflowers, honey cakes, or rolls. Girls, too, sometimes give treats to their boyfriends \(usually when they walk them home after the party\) or sew them a tobacco pouch from scraps of cloth. Remarkably, it is the women who walk their boyfriends home, and not the other way around. A boy will not even see his girlfriend to the doorstep, but the girls walk their partners home, whether they are boyfriends or fiancés. This curious behavior is even mentioned in the peasants’ songs.

Professional prostitution does not exist, but it is easy to purchase a woman with money or gifts. One woman naively confided: “I was stupid enough to end up with a son for a trifle—a dozen apples.” Women and girls enjoy getting apples from the leased orchards. They barter eggs for the apples, and occasionally they barter their own bodies.

There was a case this summer in which a twenty-year-old guard at the apple orchard raped a thirteen-year-old girl. The mother of the girl—a very poor woman, it is true—agreed to forgive the offender in exchange for three rubles. The poor girl wailed for two or three days after the incident, and what a terrified and tormented look she had\! Witnesses to the rape were girls of the same age who had stumbled into the guard’s tent at the very moment he was raping the girl and holding his hand over her mouth. Later the girl reported that when the youth began to rape her, he said: “Don’t be afraid, you won’t get pregnant; only grownup women get pregnant.” And when she wanted to scream, he said: “Don’t scream, girl, and I’ll give you a ruble.”

Sometimes in the spring, before the field-work season starts, a number of women, married and unmarried, from the same village set out on a pilgrimage to Voronezh or to the Trinity monastery. Parents and husbands know very well what kind of pilgrimage the women have in mind, but women who have agreed among themselves represent a force that is difficult to resist. They go from one village to another appealing for night lodgings in the name of Christ, and anything and everything happens at these overnight stays. One peasant justly referred to the pilgrimage as “a service for a dark god *\[chernobog\].”*

Abortions are fairly frequent. The wife of a local landlord used to help women in difficult labor, giving them a brew of “cossack juniper” \(*Juniperus sabina*\), which grew abundantly in her garden and was believed to accelerate labor. Ever since the villagers discovered the properties of the plant, “invisible hands” \(in the landlord’s words\) regularly pluck the juniper bushes at night, apparently for use as an abortifacient; the landlord never refuses to give the brew from the plant to a laboring woman.

Cases of infanticide of illegitimate babies are not at all rare. A married or unmarried woman gives birth alone somewhere in a shed, smothers the baby, and dumps it into the river \(with a rock secured to its neck\) or leaves it in a hemp thicket, or buries it either in the yard or somewhere in the pigpen. Once a widow gave birth on the eve of Easter when everyone was in church, and she smothered the baby, thinking \[as she later explained\] “it would kick the bucket3 from hunger in any case.” \(The woman had six children, not counting the baby.\) She took it to the shed where she kept her trunk and locked it in the trunk, for she expected everyone to return soon from church. All day Easter Sunday she stayed in bed, telling people that she felt very ill. At night when everyone was asleep, she picked up a pail \(as if she were going to get water\) and went to the shed, where she removed the body from the trunk. Placing it in the pail, she rushed to the pond and disposed of her cargo \(weighed down with a rock\). Afterwards she returned home with an innocent-looking pail of water. In the morning she left the house altogether and found work elsewhere as a cook. The child was discovered a month later when the pond went dry, and the widow was found out.

Another time a girl was caught when a dog dragged from a hemp field the body of a smothered baby that she had hidden there. In fact, in the large village of Muraevnia, one or two children are found dead almost every year. But only rarely are the mothers identified. Recently, pigs rooted out by the graveyard the body of a newborn that had turned blue, making it obvious that the baby had been buried a very short time before. No action was taken in the matter. Peasants do not like criminal investigations and keep quiet even when they know something. The priest, too, has a similar attitude toward these matters. “It is a sin, but only God knows who did it. Another person’s soul is impenetrable; how are you going to find out? There are plenty of girls carousing.” Sometimes illegitimate children are taken to the foundling home in Moscow.4 Muraevnia even has a woman who, for a small price, transports these “good-time children” to the foundling home. Once a woman went to a childless local landlord with a proposal that he purchase her newborn baby. “I heard that you need a child. Well, I thought you could buy this one. He is a ‘good-time baby,’ and my husband will be coming home soon.”

There are a number of reasons why morals are more relaxed now than they were in earlier times. First, people are more apt nowadays to work away from home, and interactions with other villages are more regular and frequent. Previously, village life was self-contained. The villagers worked exclusively for their owner. Now, in contrast, peasants from different villages meet at the estates of various landlords where they have hired on as day laborers. A girl can sign up for day labor wherever she likes and thus escape the supervision of her home community.

At the same time, a new practice has begun; in contrast to earlier times, young men now can go to the country dances at any village they like. Moreover, farm laborers from nearby estates descend uninvited on the local village, adding still another foreign element to the village street gatherings. \(Women and girls never go to another village for street parties.\) These men can woo the local girls with complete impunity; since they are outsiders, there is no way to restrain them. If a village girl takes up with a landowner’s farm laborer, the affair is bound to be very shortlived, for the landowner tries to hire the workers from a distant village, fifteen to thirty kilometers away, and her man will leave as soon as his contract expires. For a woman, too, it is safer to be involved with a farm laborer who is here today and gone tomorrow, than with someone from her own village; this way she avoids gossip.

The relaxation of morals is also facilitated by the absence of husbands off on migrant labor. The man acquires a mistress, while his wife may carry on an affair back home. If childless, she may in her husband’s absence hire on as a cook for the workers at the landlord’s estate. If she has a child, she will visit for several weeks at her mother’s, who of course will “cover for” her daughter under any circumstances. As the saying goes, “When the cat’s away, the mice will play.”5

An unmarried girl will not always ask for money in return for sexual relations. But virtually every grown woman will demand payment, and some will even ask for payment in advance. Women do not sin “for free,” unless it is some utterly cowed and timid widow. \[Of course, not all widows are cowed and timid.\] Some arrange things for themselves quite nicely. In our village, there is one widow who took in a son-in-law by marrying off her simple-minded, browbeaten eighteen-year-old daughter, and the widow shares the man with her daughter. When the son-in-law gets drunk, fights break out in this *ménage à trois*, but everything ends well, and the woman lives much better with her son-in-law than she did with her weak, sickly husband. She is the envy of many women in the village.

“Wayward women,” a term applied to maidens or married women who have several lovers, are sometimes punished. The lovers may decide to get together and teach their sweetheart a lesson. If she is unmarried, they spread tar on the gate to her house. A married woman is beaten, and, with her dress hoisted and fastened sacklike around her head and her body exposed from the waist down, she is paraded through the village. A girl that has only one lover is not nowadays considered “wayward” and is spared having her gate tarred.

The following event, which occurred in a remote village, illustrates the mores. The parents of a young woman who had gotten pregnant out of wedlock married her off to hide her sin. When the woman gave birth, her husband’s family \[with whom she was then living\] turned against the child. Although her husband was a peaceful, simple-hearted fellow who did not reproach his wife for her youthful indiscretion, his family was relentless and eventually demanded that she “get rid of the little bastard.” This demand was so insistent, the poor woman being continually beaten and persecuted by her in-laws, that she gave in. She filled the infant’s pacifier rag with sulfur scraped off matches, placed it in the baby’s mouth, and it soon died. The mother was taken to court but was acquitted.
