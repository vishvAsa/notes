Based on actual disbursed funds through October 2024, the United States had delivered approximately $61-68 billion in aid to Ukraine since Russia's full-scale invasion began. This disbursed aid breaks down approximately as: 

- Military assistance: ~$44-47 billion in equipment, ammunition, training, and related support that was physically delivered or services rendered
- Economic support: ~$13-15 billion in direct budgetary assistance and other economic aid that was transferred
- Humanitarian assistance: ~$4-6 billion in delivered humanitarian supplies and services 

The disbursed figures are lower than commitment totals because:

- There are administrative and logistical delays between authorization and delivery
- Some multi-year programs had only partially disbursed their funds
- Some equipment takes time to procure, prepare, and deliver

The precise tracking of disbursements is challenging as different government agencies report at different intervals and with varying levels of detail in their public disclosures.

Smaller amounts of aid has been in the form of loans back by frozen Russian assets. This may increase substantially - there are a _lot_ of frozen Russian assets. 

All these number have moved up some, not hugely, in the months since October 24.
