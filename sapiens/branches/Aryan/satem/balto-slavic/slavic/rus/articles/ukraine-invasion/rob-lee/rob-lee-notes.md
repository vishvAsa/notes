## Shifting aims
It seems Russia's goals in Ukraine have gone through three phases:

- 1) Regime change (probably lasted through the first 1-2 weeks)
- 2) Compellence
- 3) Medium to long-term occupation of more Ukrainian territory

Worth noting that a long-term occupation of more Ukrainian territory comes with serious risks and costs for Russia. It has committed the vast majority of its ground units to the war in Ukraine. The Russian military isn't in a great position to respond to other crises.

## US Resupply
One of the points I made before the war is the US lacks many of the weapons that would be most useful for Ukriane, such as long-range loitering munitions like the Harop, 30km-range Spike NLOS ATGMs, and ground-based short and medium-range air defense systems. The US military lacks those weapons because its has a dominant air force, but that means the US doesn't have many of the right weapons to equip a military that lacks a strong air force.

## Preparation errors
### Low notice
I thought Russian soldiers would have been given more than a few hours notice they were going to war. It is hard to overstate the ramifications of that decision. Logisticians didn't have time to plan (e.g. fuel, food), vehicles were sent without proper maintenance, ground guys didn't talk to air guys, adjacent units didn't coordinate, they didn't ensure comms were solid. etc.

One important factor is that few in Putin's inner circle are veterans. Many were intelligence officers, but few have military experience, including Shoigu. They clearly thought opsec was more important than allowing the military to properly prepare. A serious mistake. There is a lot of evidence from different sources that the units were given little warning, including captured documents published by the Ukrainians, statements from Russian POWs from different units/military districts, weak OPSEC steps taken by soldiers before the war. etc.
