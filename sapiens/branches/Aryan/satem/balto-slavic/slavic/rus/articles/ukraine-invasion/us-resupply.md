One of the points I made before the war is the US lacks many of the weapons that would be most useful for Ukriane, such as long-range loitering munitions like the Harop, 30km-range Spike NLOS ATGMs, and ground-based short and medium-range air defense systems. The US military lacks those weapons because its has a dominant air force, but that means the US doesn't have many of the right weapons to equip a military that lacks a strong air force.
