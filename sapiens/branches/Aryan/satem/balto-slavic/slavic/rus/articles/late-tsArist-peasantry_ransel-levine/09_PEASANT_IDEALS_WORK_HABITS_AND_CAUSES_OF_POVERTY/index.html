The first is a very short time horizon, the inability of the peasant to project plans and expectations far into the future. Nothing could be counted on, not even the ordinary expectation in modern society that most children will reach adulthood. The second is the lack of interest in saving money. This characteristic is related to the first; if there is no future, at least none that can be counted on and into which one can project hopes and plans, then why sacrifice anything for it? It makes more sense to work only as much as necessary to make it through the current year and to consume whatever extra comes one’s way.">

  <p><em>The Russian village was changing. Contact with the big city was becoming the common experience of many villagers, as the first vignette in this chapter makes clear. It also reveals two of the characteristics Semyonova thought that she could discern in the peasant way of thinking. The first is a very short time horizon, the inability of the peasant to project plans and expectations far into the future. Nothing could be counted on, not even the ordinary expectation in modern society that most children will reach adulthood. The second is the lack of interest in saving money. This characteristic is related to the first; if there is no future, at least none that can be counted on and into which one can project hopes and plans, then why sacrifice anything for it? It makes more sense to work only as much as necessary to make it through the current year and to consume whatever extra comes one’s way</em>.</p>
<p><em>Semyonova believed that one reason for the lack of motivation to save was the impossibility of doing so in the face of price fluctuations that ate up profits in a good year. Yet while making this point, she seems to want to identify a deeper cause for this peasant attitude in the experience of several centuries of serfdom. Unfortunately, she fails to define exactly what she means by this</em>.</p>
<p><em>Semyonova saw a large difference between the notions of private property and theft in peasant society and in educated Russian society. The peasants’ ideas about theft seem again to have been associated with their negative attitudes toward saving for the future. Objects taken for immediate consumption were not regarded as stolen. An important element here is, of course, also the source of the appropriated goods; the property of a landlord or the government was evidently considered in some larger sense everyone’s property. But we should not draw too sharp a distinction here, because Semyonova also points out that peasants stole from one another</em>.</p>
<p><em>What did Semyonova consider the source of these attitudes she believed were characteristic of the peasants: their lack of respect for the property of others, failure to invest in the future, and disinterest in hard work? Semyonova does not offer an explicit explanation or analysis. But in her notes about the conversations and hopes of the peasants, their difficulties in paying their taxes and in making money even in a good harvest year, and the constraints that joint responsibility</em>1 <em>and other institutions of peasant life placed on enterprise, she seems to imply that the peasants’ attitudes were related to the problem of land. Most peasants did not have a piece of land they could call their own and in which it would make sense to invest, though this is something they obviously wished to have. Keep in mind, too, the larger frame of reference that I outlined in the introduction to this book for possibly understanding their behavior: the notion that the peasants thought in terms of “limited good” and the consequent bias against accumulation</em>.</p>
<p><em>But before too hastily accepting the views of Semyonova, we should consider the likelihood that peasants used means other than setting aside money to save and invest. I have already mentioned more than once the importance of symbolic capital. In this chapter, we can glimpse another, more material form of investment: livestock holdings. In her description of tax collection and arrears, Semyonova refers to peasant families that were able to pay their taxes and still maintain herds of sufficient size to render inconspicuous extra animals left with them by relatives. Some other families were apparently willing to risk tax penalties to maintain their investments in livestock. For the majority, however, the few animals they owned were probably essential to their farming operations and did not represent savings</em>.</p>
<p>Pyotr is a rather simple-hearted and plain-looking peasant twenty-eight to thirty years old who owns his own household apart from his parents and brothers. My question takes him aback.</p>
<p>I: “Tell me, Pyotr, do you ever think about the time your boys will be grown-up and married, and how you and your wife will run the house together with your sons and daughters-in-law?”</p>
<p>Pyotr thought for a moment and replied artlessly: “No, I guess I don’t.”</p>
<p>“Honestly?”</p>
<p>“I’d think about it, if somehow I could really count on it happening. Of course, there would be a change, my sons would be relieving me—but, look, I really can’t be sure of any of that. So what’s the point of thinking about it? Do you really think they will grow up? They could just as easily die first…. I think it is probably more likely that they will die.”</p>
<p>“Pyotr, have you ever planned to go to Moscow? Did you ever want to do that?”</p>
<p>“I was planning to go three years ago, but my mother wouldn’t let me.”</p>
<p>“Just look how eager peasants are to go there nowadays. I often wonder what attracts you people there. Can it be that life is better there? The people who go don’t bring back much money. But could things be better even so? And what a lot of liquor!”</p>
<p>“Of course, we drink a lot there. Hardly anyone brings money back home. You’re right about that. Sometimes a peasant sends his son to Moscow, and the fellow will send some money home on occasion, especially if he’s afraid of his father, but he’ll never bring anything back. But not everyone is a drunkard.”</p>
<p>“True. But what is there for those who do not drink? I believe that by now the young men all know that you can’t get rich there.”</p>
<p>Pyotr, giving the question some thought, replies:</p>
<p>“It seems to me that many of them go there for clothes, too. Here you go around in the same old rags winter and summer, but in town you can get decent clothes and shoes. Why, the way they look when they come back from town, we can’t even stand next to them.” (Indeed, it is a matter of honor for a young man to return from town to his village looking like “a Moscow dandy,” sporting a vest, a jacket, galoshes, and even slacks.)</p>
<p>I: “Did you really want to go to Moscow, then? Are you sorry you weren’t able to get there?”</p>
<p>Pyotr (smiling quietly): “I wanted to, of course. Even now I sometimes want to go there, especially when one of the fellows comes back with a lot of good stories. I get envious. But when I don’t hear anything about Moscow, I all but forget that the place exists. I just go on living and don’t give it a thought.”</p>
<p>“So, what do they tell about Moscow?”</p>
<p>“They say the pay is good there, and people dress better, and there is plenty of everything—tea, liquor, food—not like here in the village. The pay is high, and lots of everything, they say.”</p>
<p>A peasant’s ideal is to be near a warm stove and have at least an hour to himself. Sometimes the ideal is associated with the city life of a carter or a janitor, but again not with the idea of saving money. City life appears attractive because in Moscow one can spend the whole day in a tavern; “drinking there is more fun,” and “the food is better there,” they will say. While a young man may send something to his parents back home (albeit usually only after many entreaties), a newlywed peasant who has moved out of his parents’ home and become a household head on his own will most likely (there are exceptions, of course) return from the big city “as poor as a church mouse,” with only memories of food and drink to savor.</p>

<p>You might say that the peasants <em>never</em> have any money.2 When they sell their grain in the fall, they have to “deal with taxes” and get the larder stocked for the winter. Then the fall festival of their patron saint approaches, and all the money is spent. When sons and brothers send money from Moscow or when peasants get some money from off-farm work, again “it goes to taxes,” or to a holiday celebration or a wedding. Generally speaking, it goes where money is needed and is thus once again spent up. Your average peasant is not used to having extra cash around, and so he quickly drinks up what little extra money has come his way. He looks on this extra as if it were purely happenstance, as if it had just fallen out of the sky; and so it gets drunk up. A man’s wallet is known as a <em>gomonok</em> [a slang word meaning something like “the last abode of money,” from the Russian <em>ugomon dlia deneg</em>].</p>
<p>Peasants believe that “it is a sin to pile up money.” Savings are just one more stone around a sinner’s neck. At present, it is difficult to tell if their utter indifference to the future actually rests on beliefs such as these or if they “dredge up” these ideas in order to justify their predicament to themselves and their families. Probably both factors are at work here.</p>
<p>The cost of cabbage varies from one ruble per hundred in a normal year to three rubles in a good harvest year. A suckling pig starts at seventy kopecks but rises to three rubles in a good year. The range for apples is from fifty kopecks to two rubles. The prices are set by sellers and producers (owners of vegetable gardens and leaseholders of orchards). These price ranges reflect the increase in peasants’ expenses in a good year. Yet, people seem to believe that peasants can “save” when there is a good harvest! Irrespective of the actual situation, however, peasants give no thought to saving for the future. If a peasant has a good harvest that will keep him until the next year, he will stay at home and loaf and cannot be enticed to take an extra job at any price. Peasants hire themselves out as farm laborers only when driven to it by dire need, when they have, so to speak, a knife at their throat. [Then they will do] the most arduous work imaginable.</p>
<p>You really ought to see the arrogance, even impudence, with which a ragged laborer will go to his employer in a good year and ask to settle up before the end of the agreed-upon work period: “Be so kind as to pay up!”</p>
<p>Landlord: “What’s wrong? Are you saying that you’re treated badly here?”</p>
<p>“Nothing’s wrong. I just don’t want to stay here anymore. I’m going home.”</p>
<p>“I can’t let you go. The work season is just starting. I’m not going to give you any money. I need to harvest my crops, too; that’s what I hired you for.”</p>
<p>“If you don’t pay, I’ll leave anyway.”</p>
<p>If the landlord does not let him go, he will work very poorly on purpose, damage equipment, water the horses to the point that they get sick, and the like.</p>
<p>“How come the landlord did not want to let you go at first, and then he kicked you out?”</p>
<p>Ivan (with a smirk): “Well, I just goofed off instead of working, so he let me go.”</p>
<p>They really do abandon their jobs as farm laborers and in their bast shoes and rags go and harvest their own crops, after which they climb up on the stove and seem not to need a thing except bread, warmth, and a “missus” they can order around.</p>
<p>Yet when there is nothing to eat and no fuel to heat the house, these same peasants will go to a landlord and grovel in order to get work. “I’ll do any kind of job you have; just take me and my missus.” “You can pay us in bread, just enough to get us through the winter.” They bow clear to the ground, even shed tears.</p>
<p>Until recently, some peasants could not distinguish one type of paper money from another, count money correctly, or figure out the prices for manufactured goods. But now every peasant has a billfold, and he knows how to manage properly his tax records (<em>podatnaia knizhka</em>) and to calculate his accounts with the landlord or storekeeper. Moreover, he has learned the value of his own labor and, knowing that merchants like to overcharge him and landowners try to take advantage of his poverty and hire him for low wages, he in turn has mastered various ruses to work less and charge more for his labor. If he thinks that a landowner is offering him too little for a job, he would rather forget the work and stay home, taking comfort in the thought that the landlord will eventually have to pay someone else even more.</p>
<h2 id="the-peasants-attitudes-to-noble-and-merchant-landlords">The Peasants’ Attitudes to Noble and Merchant Landlords</h2>
<p>3</p>
<p>In the depths of the peasants’ souls, it seems to me, they prefer landowners from the nobility. They probably feel and understand that noble landowners “in general” treat them more humanely and better. Peasants are not averse to taking advantage of “good-hearted” noble landlords, not to mention that they always expect to receive a handout from them.</p>
<p>The peasants will sometimes come to an inexperienced noble landowner, hang around by the porch hemming and hawing, and, having accepted some medicine or other, will say straight out: “Would you be so good as to give us some [monetary] aid?” On occasion, they will make up a story about how poor they are in order to receive a little larger handout. More than once I have observed a noble landlady in these situations. She was well aware of these at times naive lies, and yet not deterred by them from taking pity on a peasant and freely giving him assistance. In such a case, not a single “Ivan” would have understood that the woman saw through his lie and only out of a sense of pity looked beyond it and gave him assistance. On the contrary, any peasant would have been convinced that he had outwitted the wealthy person. Ivan, of course, would not have suffered any pangs of conscience on this account, since he would figure that rich people earn their salvation by such acts of charity (there is a folktale about a housekeeper who deceived her noble master into benefiting the poor and in this way saved his soul). Besides all this, peasants tend to regard noble landlords and their managerial abilities with scorn and have no faith whatsoever in them.</p>
<p>As for merchant landowners, the peasants have great respect for their ability to realize a solid return from agriculture, and they admire their industrious management of the farm and the fact that the merchants give attention to everything. In this connection, how a merchant runs his business, how he is able to catch workers stealing things from him, and the like are frequent topics of conversation among peasants. By the same token, peasants do not like merchants, of course, and they deal with them in their own firm and familiar way. Nowadays, for example, when fellows use the formal “you” in addressing even young peasant women, the villagers usually continue to use the informal “you” with merchants and to respond to a merchant’s swearing with an equal amount of their own, reminding him that “you’re no better than the rest of us,” you are no noble. Naturally, if the peasants think they can get something out of a merchant, they will humble themselves before him even more than they would before a noble landlord (some merchants love to have the peasants genuflect before them). But the people least liked by the peasants are the noble landlords who manage their estates tightfistedly like kulaks (<em>kulakovatye dvoriane</em>). The peasants forgive them nothing and will burn them out and take vengeance on them for any reason, so long as they do not fear their ties to the authorities. In the moments when peace reigns between the peasants and such a kulak, it is a rare peasant who does not think or say that a noble is not supposed to be involved in all the ins and outs of his business. So the mental outlook of Ivan is rather complex. On the one hand, he lacks respect for the noble because of his inability to master agriculture and toil on the land as the peasant does; on the other, [he appreciates] the grandeur of the noble. There is obviously a peasant aesthetic conception that opposes the noble to the merchant and muzhik moiling in dung. The religious sectarians envy the freedom of nobles to devote their time to thoughts about salvation, a kind of freedom not enjoyed by them, peasants who constantly have to worry about earning their daily bread amid the miserable conditions of village life. The sectarians talk about this openly. In the view of the peasants, this is the real meaning of being wealthy: that you do not have to count pennies or sully your noble dignity by bothering with the minutiae of your farm operations—and it is, incidentally, much more advantageous for “Ivan” if he has this kind of landlord.4</p>
<p>Walking down the village street, I see a wagon loaded with cabbage standing near a poor little house. The horse has been unharnessed and taken inside the fence. While the owner of the home leans idly on the front end of the wagon, three women are busy picking out the best cabbage heads and peeling loose leaves off of them. Two tiny girls, around four years old, carry the cleaned cabbage heads into the open door of the barn and arrange them on the earthen floor, work that has been going on now for about two hours. All this time the man has just stood there, only occasionally bestirring himself to roll a cigarette. The women talk among themselves, sometimes in rapid high voices and sometimes in an unhurried drawl, about the quality of the cabbage and its high price; even so, they work rather fast. But you should see the little girls! What diligence, speed, and determination they display in carrying the cabbage to the storage room! How eager they are for their mother or aunt to pass them a cabbage head, and how radiant are their dirty little faces as they toddle barefoot to the storage room with a head of cabbage or even two heads! One of the women goes into the house and returns carrying in her arms a boy of two and a half. At first he screws up his eyes against the sun; then, with a serious expression, he observes the girls for a few moments, and finally struggles to get down. On still-shaky legs, he approaches the wagon and amusingly grabs at the air with his hands to get a cabbage, saying: “Mama, give me one!” His mother is reluctant at first, and the boy starts crying. “All right, all right, take it; just keep quiet.” The boy now beams and, his eyes not yet dry, joins the girls in carrying heads of cabbage to the storage room. “Just look at them,” one woman remarks, “you can’t drive them away from work. But wait till they grow up; you won’t be able to make them work with a stick. That’s the way it always is.” Maybe this is because for a three-year-old Ivan, the experience with cabbage, as with other objects and people around him, is new, while a fifteen-year-old boy is accustomed to the drab routine. Or perhaps the apathy, gloom, and indifference that will accompany him till his last hour result from his diet of potatoes and stale bread? At any rate, the difference between a three-year-old Ivan and a fifteen-year-old one is enormous.</p>

<p>The peasants’ lack of respect for hard work is remarkable. “Him? He digs in the field like a beetle from morning till night!” They often say this with scorn.</p>
<p>Could it be that this attitude reflects unpleasant memories of obligatory labor services under serfdom, and that the desire to stay home and loaf, thinking, “At least I can take this one day for myself,” is just a natural reaction?</p>
<p>[A peasant woman was hired to cook for our farm laborers.] She took some of the flour she was given for making bread for the workers and used it to bake some cakes for herself. She planned to secretly “gorge” herself and her farm laborer husband on them, but the village elder found her out and reported to me. (The woman was not subjected to any punishment other than a reprimand.) I talked about this incident with another woman, also a house servant.</p>
<p>I: “How do you like what Akulina did?”</p>
<p>Katerina is uneasy at first, then blurts out: “Well, I think Mitrii [the elder] was a fool to bother you with such trifles. Big deal, a woman baked some bread for herself and ate it.”</p>
<p>I: “But she stole the flour for it.”</p>
<p>Katerina: “That’s not stealing! She just baked and ate it. She didn’t take the cakes to her room or hide them in the storeroom.”</p>
<p>I: “But she took the flour, and as a result the laborers had less bread. What’s the difference if she stole it and took it home or ate it right here? It’s still robbery.”</p>
<p>Katerina: “But she ate the cakes right here in your house, together with her husband; that’s not robbery. If she had stolen the flour from a locked cupboard or saved it for the future, that would probably be a sin.”</p>
<p>Try as I might to explain to Katerina that unauthorized appropriation of another person’s property, whether consumed immediately or saved for future use, is still a theft, she would not agree with me.</p>
<p>The very same elder who turned in Akulina, when he is guarding the landlord’s apple trees against raids by the boys hired on temporarily as shepherds, fills his pockets with apples every time he makes the rounds.</p>
<p>Property that belongs to the state is treated with even less respect than that of a landlord. Peasants reason that “the tsar has plenty of everything,” and they steal whatever they can get their hands on. It seems impossible to protect the state forest, however many the number of foresters and guards.</p>
<p>I have observed that peasants, either out of habit or perhaps from some genetic predisposition, have a deep affection for the land. At any rate, a majority of peasants (even those who have lived in town) envy landowners more than anything else. Peasants regard “capital” [money] as more precarious than land; it can slip from your hands much faster because of the temptations to which it exposes its owner. One of the most deep-rooted and firm convictions among peasants is that one day all the land will become theirs. It is terribly amusing to observe how clever they can sometimes be in avoiding this issue in their conversations with landlords. As for the landlords, older peasants consider them to be “weaklings” or “softies,” who squander their capital because they are unable to do hard work. It is hard to tell if the younger generation will adopt this view. It seems to me that these young people (I refer here to eighteen-to-twenty-year-old males) have no definite views. They have discarded many of the old verities but have not yet found anything with which to replace them. Perhaps this is because young people still depend on their parents and have not had to go it on their own.</p>
<p>The conversations of peasant men do not stray far from their domestic affairs, field work, taxes, the township council, and the like. Sometimes they talk about other things, for example, the special favors they expect on the occasion of a tsarist coronation or the birth of an heir to the throne. They naturally hope for an exemption from tax arrears. When parish schools first opened, the men spoke of its being done on the initiative of the new tsaritsa [Alexandra, wife of Nicholas II], for when she married the tsar, it is said, she poked fun at him because of the backwardness of his people. Rumor has it that the tsaritsa is “kind,” and peasants tend to think that she “may have some additional favors in store for them.” Any favor from the tsar provokes speculation about the possibility of more benefits to come.</p>
<p>Women, of course, almost never participate in these conversations. They normally engage in gossip about neighbors or about the families of the local landlords and their household staffs.</p>
<p>Tax collection, too, provokes much grumbling on the part of the peasants. “Does the tsar really not have enough money? We have so little land, and yet have to pay high taxes,” one peasant will say. Another might respond with a common adage such as: “It’s not the tsar who taxes us but his servants. It’s not the tsar who runs things but the huntsman.”5 The peasants frequently talk among themselves about this issue and express their envy of the powerful landlords. In the early 1880s, persistent rumors circulated in the village about a possible reallocation of the large landed estates to the peasants.</p>
<p>Peasants also complain a lot about the practice of making each villager responsible for the obligations of all other villagers [the “joint responsibility” custom referred to earlier]. “We had two brothers in our village, both of them drunks, who lived with their elderly father. They accumulated arrears in excess of 150 rubles. Last spring they both died, and their debt was laid on the rest of us—and besides that, we had to support their father. As you know, our village is small, only fifteen families. Why do I have to pay for a drunk? What kind of justice is that? There’s no justice in our village.” Almost every peasant has a similar tale.</p>
<p>The better-off peasants are bitter about the attitude of their poorer neighbors. “They hate and envy us constantly, saying things like: ‘What makes you think you’re so much better? Just wait, you’re going to be as poor as us.’ If you plant an apple tree, they resent it, saying: ‘Now that big shot is planting an orchard! We are starving while he is putting in an orchard, and fencing it off at that!’” And they think nothing of breaking down the fence and uprooting the tree. If the tree happens to survive and bear fruit, they feel it is their duty to raid it. “That’s how much hate they have! And if some misfortune should befall you, they’ll make sure to finish you off.” The well-to-do peasant who recited this lament came into his money by pure chance and is not the kind of person who takes advantage of his neighbors’ poverty to improve his own lot. This farmer harvests up to 120 shocks of rye off the plot he leases (landlords lease out the land to peasants for seven to twelve rubles per desiatina a year) and is familiar with horticulture because he worked as a gardener for twenty years. Yet, despite great efforts, he had not been able to develop either an orchard or a vegetable garden. “I tried and tried, but now,” he said with a dismissive wave of his hand, “I’ve abandoned the idea and just buy produce.” Arson motivated by revenge is [also] very frequent.</p>
<p>When tax collections begin in September, the kulaks [rich peasants] rejoice. If the ordinary peasants are not prompt with their taxes, the authorities first jail the elders of the communities that are in arrears. Then the elders see to it that those failing to pay up are themselves put in jail. The ultimate measure is auctioning the livestock of a defaulter. Occasionally, because of the practice of joint responsibility, the authorities do not bother to check who paid taxes and who did not: the auction simply starts with the first house at the edge of the village. But if they are prosecuting only the families that have not paid up, these defaulters try to protect their livestock by hiding it on the property of their rich relatives who have paid the tax.</p>
<p>The sale is normally carried out by the township supervisor, with the district police officer (<em>stanovoi</em>) occasionally present. Women “wail” when their cattle are sold. The auction prices are naturally lower than normal market prices. A cow or a horse that is worth thirty rubles is sold for only ten or fifteen rubles. The principal buyers are kulaks. The peasants who lose their livestock do whatever they can to get it back. They pawn their clothes and those of their wives, and may sell their spring fields as cheaply as ten rubles per desiatina to the very same kulaks who have taken possession of their livestock. When such a peasant family scrapes together enough money, they buy back their cow or horse, overpaying as much as five rubles; if their horse was auctioned for ten rubles, they now have to pay fifteen rubles to get it back. When kulaks purchase a spring field from a needy peasant, they allow him a “grace period” of one month during which he still can buy his field back, but, again, only with an overpayment of up to five rubles per desiatina. One might want to think of the five rubles as an interest charge, but this is not the case, since the sale and repurchase are two separate transactions. The very same kulak may lend money to peasants at a low rate of interest or even interest-free. If a peasant treats the kulak to drinks, the kulak will lend him money for a period of time with no interest. If the peasant cannot pay up at the time agreed upon, a bottle of vodka is all it takes to have the kulak extend the date of payment.</p>
<p>There was an article in <em>Novoe Vremia</em> magazine about the inequitable taxation of peasants. The author calculated that in Central Russia a family of five pays approximately nine rubles a year in state taxes, while a family of the same size living in Siberia pays only half that amount. The article is titled “The Impoverishment of the Central Regions,” and the author regards the main cause of this impoverishment as the unequal allocation of the tax burden between the center and the periphery.</p>
<p>But what about the many other reasons for the peasants’ destitution? I already mentioned the price fluctuations on basic necessities. Even a shoemaker’s prices vary from seven rubles for a pair of boots in a bad harvest year to ten rubles in a good year. Furthermore, enormous amounts are squandered in taverns. I know a family in which the husband, after selling grain in town for twenty rubles, never comes back home with more than fourteen or fifteen rubles in his pocket. The head of another family is a lazy lout who rents out his land allotment just so he can avoid farming it himself,6 and he drinks with the money his daughter sends home from the city, where she works as a servant. This family of four is always on the brink of starvation, even in a good harvest year. Unproductive peasants of this kind make up at least 10 percent of the village population. And then there is the money that somehow gets “lost” or “stolen” in a tavern, plus expensive customs like the parties thrown for conscripts and the wedding celebrations out of all proportion to people’s real means. Compared to these large outlays, four or five extra rubles in taxes are a drop in the bucket. I am not saying that we should abandon efforts to achieve more equitable taxation, but the taxes are, I repeat, literally a drop in the bucket.</p>
<p>[In this connection, it might be pointed out that the liquor merchants are skillful in dealing with their clientele.] When a new tavernkeeper comes to a village, he has to secure a steady flow of customers. To do this he offers to lend peasants from eight to twenty rubles by means of promissory notes that he has notarized at the township supervisor’s office. This is in fact a line of credit extended to peasants by the tavernkeeper, and it is applicable only to purchases made at his establishment: vodka, naturally.7</p>

<p>“Joint responsibility” is a Russian practice of very long standing, and a difficult one to explain briefly. In essence, it meant that all members of a group (an artel or village commune, for example) stood surety for all other members in dealings contracted by (or imposed upon) the group as whole.</p>

<p>While Semyonova may be right about the large outlays for parties and weddings, she seems here more than usual to be judging peasant behavior by the standards of her own educated society and failing to understand the centrality of these activities to family status and community solidarity in the peasant world. This type of display and reaffirmation of community bonds may have been needed more than ever at a time of rapid change, signified by the village’s increasing interaction with the city and national government.</p>
