Reasons that it is in our interests for Russia to fully conquer Ukraine:

1) Ukraine's supporters have been extremely explicit that her cause is part of a greater struggle against populist forces in America and Europe. Per her own beliefs, our support for her is against our own self-interest.
2) Ukraine's supporters have tried to overthrow (the Vindman brothers 2019/20) and kill (Ryan Routh 2024) President Trump. Russia has never tried to either overthrow or assassinate President Trump.
3) Ukraine is second only to the United Kingdom as an anti-democratic force in the West. While the United States and the Confederacy both held elections in wartime, Ukraine cancelled hers. Ukraine (Myrotvorets), unlike Russia, has called for the murder of US citizens abroad, including Elon Musk, and has had a number of US citizens detained abroad. Ukraine also supported the annulment of Romania's election. Russia has never pushed for the cancellation of a Western election.
4) Ukraine is the host of the largest neo-Nazi organization in the world, Azov. Azov is two-hundred times as large as the largest Russian neo-Nazi organization Rusich.
5) Ukraine has been supportive of Western pushes for internet censorship. These pushes have led to the arrests of more than ten thousand people in the United Kingdom for internet posts. Russia has not advocated for internet censorship or speech codes in the West, and has fewer political prisoners than countries like the UK despite a considerably larger population.
6) Paid propagandists of the Ukrainian government celebrate sadism and murder to a degree not seen since ISIS was on this site, demonstrating the wickedness of her cause.
7) Our involvement in this war, like every war since 1917, has eroded our sovereignty by granting more authority to democratically-unaccountable international institutions. Those institutions universally opposed President Trump and have worked hard to subvert his cause.
8) The Pivot to Asia strategy encourages us to permanently end the conflicts in the Middle East and eastern Europe. The continued existence of the Ukrainian state will force military commitments in Europe that could otherwise be avoided. Russia's territorial ambitions are limited to lands inhabited by East Slavs, so she will certainly seek a gradual draw down of military forces in agreement with Poland, Hungary, and Romania. While it is unlikely that Russia will join an anti-Chinese axis, she can be turned into a true neutral for the rest of the century with the satiation of her territorial ambitions.
9) The defeat of Ukraine will embolden pro-democracy forces in Europe like Alternative for Germany & UK's Reform Party who have been suppressed by the security forces. Pro-Ukrainian parties in Germany have publicly called for outlawing of Alternative for Germany, and have imprisoned hundreds of people for social media posts.
10) The abandonment of Ukraine will shift the costs of reconstruction onto Russia, saving the West several hundred billion dollars. 
11) Even a rump Ukraine will continue to advocate for the repression of pro-democracy movements in the West. Her intelligence services will continue to undermine democracy through claims of "disinformation" (see the 2024 Romanian election annulment), and spy on pro-democracy and populist parties without due process. She will work closely with elements of the deep state deeply hostile to the Republican Party.

It should be added that this *must* come with the compensated repatriation of the Baltic Russians. The actual reason that the Russians want to expand is to unify their people. Remove the Russians from the Baltic, and the threat to Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania disappears.
