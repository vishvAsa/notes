[Report](https://bbc.global.ssl.fastly.net/russian/features-61848550) from the BBC on Russian volunteers in Ukraine. They say volunteers can either sign a contract with the Russian military, with Rosgvardia in Chechnya, with LNR/DNR forces (less common because the pay is worse), or join Wagner. 

The BBC says that volunteer units are taking part in fighting in some of the most kinetic areas in Ukraine and volunteers generally receive 3-7 days of training. One of the volunteers interviewed said there was no training in tactics and that many volunteers are over 45. Volunteers who join Rosgvardia in Chechnya were provided better training at the Spetsnaz University in Gudermes and signed 3-month contracts. The Rosgvardia volunteer fought in Rubizhne and around Severodonetsk and said Ukrainian mortar and MLRS fire was effective. 

According to the BBC's sources, Wagner as well as volunteer MoD and Rosgvardia units are now Russia's primary assault forces in Ukraine. They identified at least 155 Russian volunteers who have been killed in Ukraine. Of these 155, 57% of them were 40 years old or older and 25% are over 50 years old or older. 5/

One of the main points is that the MoD is offering a sizeable paycheck for 3 months contracts and, apparently, are offering to help pay off loans or debt. Volunteers in Nizhnekamsk are being offered 200k rubles a month, which is 5 times the average monthly salary for the city.
