  <meta property="og:description" content="Once a young couple or the family of an eligible man decided to initiate an official proposal of marriage, one or more matchmakers had to be engaged to make the initial approaches to the family of the bride-to-be. Assuming everyone agreed, the pledging was then followed by a bride-show, and finally the official church marriage ceremony. Some scholars believe that the betrothal (or the betrothal and bride-show together) represented the pre-Christian rites, and these rites sealed the marriage from the peasant point of view (“the wine is drunk”), for the couple at that point could begin sexual relations. This view strikes me as romanticized, for the essence of the bargain was the transfer of the bride to a new household, and this did not occur until after the church ceremony. The marriage bond clearly required all three steps in order to enjoy the sanction of the village community.">

  <p><em>Once a young couple or the family of an eligible man decided to initiate an official proposal of marriage, one or more matchmakers had to be engaged to make the initial approaches to the family of the bride-to-be. Assuming everyone agreed, the pledging was then followed by a bride-show, and finally the official church marriage ceremony. Some scholars believe that the betrothal (or the betrothal and bride-show together) represented the pre-Christian rites, and these rites sealed the marriage from the peasant point of view (“the wine is drunk”), for the couple at that point could begin sexual relations. This view strikes me as romanticized, for the essence of the bargain was the transfer of the bride to a new household, and this did not occur until after the church ceremony. The marriage bond clearly required all three steps in order to enjoy the sanction of the village community</em>.</p>
<p><em>Semyonova’s account raises some additional difficulties in this regard, because of the stress the older generation, at least, appears to have placed on the bride’s virginity. Remarks in this chapter and elsewhere in this study make clear that young people no longer seemed to attach a high value to premarital celibacy</em>.</p>
<p><em>Weddings in this community normally took place during the week-long festival of St. Michael in the fall following the harvest. I have placed a reckoning of expenditures of three families of different means at the end of the chapter (the reckonings are from Semyonova’s unpublished notes), followed by stories about two other marriages, which Semyonova reported in the form of dialogue</em>.</p>
<p>Matchmaking services are not entrusted to outsiders. Usually the matchmaker is a female relative experienced in such matters. She cannot be considered a specialist for the village as a whole, since she provides this service only to her own kin. In general, relatives and the respect paid to them play an enormous role in all “solemn occasions” of peasant life, such as weddings, baptisms, and funerals. (Outsiders are invited to funeral dinners, however, for they offer prayers for the deceased and thus facilitate his entry into heaven. This belief is associated with the notion of the ordeals of the soul after death.)</p>
<p>The mother of the groom, accompanied by his grandmother, aunt, or godmother, comes to the prospective bride’s house to propose. They exchange greetings with the bride’s mother, who probably already knows the purpose of their visit and is waiting for them in the house. The visitors look at the ceiling beam and announce, “We need to cross beyond that beam,” which means they want to propose to the bride.</p>
<p>“Well, it’s a good thing to do.”</p>
<p>“You have a daughter, and we have a son.”</p>
<p>“Well, good luck!”</p>
<p>“We are not joking.”</p>
<p>“Neither am I. I have no objection, but I have to ask her father.”</p>
<p>The father is sent for. After a consultation in the hallway, he is brought in to the matchmakers. The earlier conversation is repeated, the visitors standing by the door all the while. [Finally the bride’s parents say,] “We have no objections. Now we must ask our daughter.” The daughter is sent for (meanwhile she has changed into a cleaner sarafan and a kerchief). In the hallway she is asked whether she wants to marry the man. She replies: “Let it be as you, father and mother, would wish it.” She is brought in, and the visitors have a good look at her. Her parents say: “Now we can drink on it.” A bottle of vodka and other refreshments are placed on the table. The visitors also produce a bottle and some food that they have brought with them. The young woman leaves the room. The two parties to the transaction sit down at the table, drink, eat, and discuss the gifts to be exchanged between the bride and the groom. If the bride’s parents do not want to marry their daughter off on this occasion, they will demand an unreasonable brideprice. If the proposing party did not like the prospective bride, they will not even sit down to drink, but right after the bride leaves the room, they excuse themselves, explaining that they need to give the matter more thought and to discuss it with the rest of the family and with the groom. After the brideprice and the gifts have been agreed upon and the wine is drunk, the girl is considered “pledged.”</p>
<p>The rules governing the behavior of a betrothed couple in intimate relations prior to marriage [differ from those for couples that are merely dating]. The couple act upon the belief that since “the wine was drunk,” which is to say that they received their blessing at the engagement and the families have, moreover, incurred expenses, the matter cannot possibly fall through. All things considered, the young woman feels confident yielding to her betrothed if an opportunity is offered by a late party, a warm night, or a happy moment when the couple can inconspicuously slip off to a barn or vacant house.</p>
<p>Sometimes a betrothed young man will renounce his promised one after the engagement, or, as happens more often, the young woman will renounce him, because he is frequently the choice of her parents, not her, and she may get cold feet at the last minute. In these cases, the offended family claims restitution. The penalty imposed on the family committing the breach of promise is anywhere from ten to twenty-five rubles and is legally enforced through a judgment handed down by the village council (<em>mirskii prigovor</em>).</p>
<p>In some villages, a potential bride [who has not been sued for by the usual age] is presented publicly for marrying. She is dressed up, and her father or another male relative drives her through her home village as well as through some of the neighboring villages. The wagon rolls slowly through the village, and the girl’s father cries out: “Anyone need a stone post?” Everybody gathers to look at the bride, and if someone likes the looks of her, he will invite her to his house with the words: “A pipe, a pipe! Turn in here!” The woman and her father or brother enter the house, and she is given a closer inspection. If the man in question still likes what he sees, a date for the pledging ceremony will be set.</p>
<p>One or two weeks after the proposal, the bride-show is scheduled. The groom’s family provides refreshments (pancakes, fried chicken, pie, pickles, honey cakes, pretzels, sunflower seeds, vodka). All these are placed in a trunk, and the groom and his family take it to the bride’s house. They enter the house, and the men together with the groom take one bench, while the women from the groom’s side sit down on another bench nearby. The trunk with the refreshments is placed by the stove. The bride meanwhile puts on her best clothes and is led into the room by her married sister or sister-in-law. The bride bows to the groom and his family and greets each woman with a kiss. The groom and his family rise. The bride is now standing in front of the groom. Her head kerchief is tied in such a way that her face is shaded. The groom’s family inspects the bride closely. “Perhaps she is lame?” they may inquire. Her sister or sister-in-law then has her walk around the room. Other questions are asked, for example, about whether she may be deaf. Then her future parents-in-law approach the bride and ask: “Why is she wrapped like that so we can’t see her eyes; is she possibly blind in one eye?” The bride’s sister uncovers her face for inspection. If the bride is pale, the groom’s family will want to know the reason, asking whether she is sickly.</p>
<p>The following day the groom may come in a cart to take the bride and her girlfriends for a ride. He then takes them to a tavern, where he treats them to tea, honey cakes, and occasionally vodka. During the ride, the girls honor the couple with songs and beat on scythes for accompaniment. The horse is usually adorned with bells and pieces of cloth woven into its mane. If the groom’s parents like the bride, his mother ties around the bride’s head a kerchief that is brought for the occasion, while his father places a coin (sometimes even one ruble) on the top of her head. After this, the groom’s parents take their son aside, while the bride’s parents do the same with their daughter. The groom is asked whether he likes the bride, and she is asked a similar question. If they are to each other’s liking, the answer is: “If you, father and mother, like him/her, so do I.” After this the groom and the bride stand next to each other, and their relatives perform a blessing with an icon: first the parents of the groom, then the parents of the bride, followed by their respective godparents. The couple bow deeply to them and kiss the icon. Then the couple go hand in hand to the other house (if the family has a second dwelling on its property) or to a neighbor’s. There a table is already set for them.</p>
<p>During this procession, the groom has the right to examine his bride’s body by touch, especially if it seems to him that she has a physical defect. A skinny bride, foreseeing this, will pad herself with a large number of skirts and sarafans to appear pudgier. If the groom discovers that the bride is pregnant, he may go back to his parents and call off the wedding, although this rarely happens; some men will intentionally go for a “good-time” girl who has a substantial dowry, while others are too timid to examine their brides thoroughly. Since bride-shows normally take place in late fall and frequently in the evening, it is easy for the groom to check over the bride by taking her into the unlit hall or outdoors, either on the road in front of the house or even into the dark backyard. The bride is supposed to keep quiet during the inspection and obey her husband-to-be.</p>
<p>When they come back into the house, the groom’s brother seats them at the table in the place of honor (the corner to the left of the entrance door under the icon [known to Russians as the “holy” or “beautiful” corner]). Then the bride’s girlfriends arrive and sit at the table. First the groom’s treats and vodka are served. The couple drink first, and the girls follow. After all of this has been consumed, the bride’s brother places the bride’s treats on the table, and the same order of drinking and eating is repeated. The girls sing songs for the occasion and then start dancing. Very often they become drunk. The groom and the bride sit next to each other and eat honey cakes or crack sunflower seeds. They are allowed to squeeze one another’s hand and converse. When everything has been eaten and all the songs have been sung, the couple, again holding hands, proceed to the house where earlier the bride was first presented. During this move, the groom has another opportunity to examine his bride by touch. One woman, who married off her son to a very poor girl favored by the boy, teased her son that his wife had a mutilated finger (her finger had been smashed in a door when she was a child). The son replied: “Well, mother, I examined her all right but couldn’t make out that anything was wrong with her finger, and indeed you yourself failed to notice anything when Tania was officially presented.”</p>
<p>In the first house, the in-laws, and for that matter all the older people, have been celebrating ever since the bride left. There too the couple are given the place of honor, and their elders drink to their health and toast them. Then the bride rises and presents gifts to her in-laws: a shirt for her father-in-law, a kerchief for her mother-in-law, and towels for other relatives. After this the groom’s family rides off in carts, while he walks home, again holding hands with his bride, who accompanies him to the end of the village or to the nearest street corner. The bride’s girlfriends follow along and again accompany the couple with singing. At this point it is already very late at night, and if the groom did not find an opportunity to examine his bride earlier when they were walking from one house to the other, this is the time to do it. At the end of the village the procession stops. The groom kisses his bride and treats her to honey cakes, sunflower seeds, and apples.</p>
<p>The bride then returns home. She tears off the ceremonial kerchief and pounds her head on a bench while crying out a lamentation or, as it is known here, “the scream.” Her mother and sister join in:</p>
<p>My father, my provider,</p>
<p>My dearest mother,</p>
<p>I’ve been given away, miserable and hapless,</p>
<p>And giving me away they washed it down with vodka</p>
<p>And a burnt bread crust.</p>
<p>How will it turn out for me going to live with strangers,</p>
<p>To a new father and mother.</p>
<p>I will have to please these strangers,</p>
<p>To be pleasing and obedient to them all.</p>
<p>After this, everyone retires for the night. The bride shouts out this lament every evening of the week preceding the wedding. Some brides are completely hoarse by the time they go to church to be wed.</p>
<p>Between the bride-show and the wedding, the groom may call upon his bride several times. On these occasions he brings vodka and treats his prospective relatives. He also brings treats for the bride. When the groom leaves for home, the bride walks him to a street corner. At this point in their relationship, the couple are likely to begin having sex.</p>
<p>On the eve of the wedding, a party for the bride’s girlfriends is held.1 On the afternoon of the day of the party, the parents of the groom arrive to collect the bride’s gifts for him. On his behalf, they present her with a pound of soap and a pair of earrings. Soon the girlfriends arrive. The bride serves them refreshments and vodka. The girls honor her with songs. Then the bride addresses her parents with a lamentation:</p>
<p>My father, my provider,</p>
<p>My dearest mother,</p>
<p>Thank you for your hospitality.</p>
<p>My stay with you has ended,</p>

<p>And the festivities are over for me—</p>
<p>This is my very last day,</p>
<p>This is my very last hour.</p>
<p>After this the bride undresses, and her closest friend gives her a steam bath inside the stove, washing her with the groom’s soap. The girls sing:</p>
<p>Burn red-hot, new bath,</p>
<p>Burn white-hot, stove.</p>
<p>Spill the pearls, small and big,</p>
<p>Neither on satin, nor on velvet,</p>
<p>But on a silver plate.</p>
<p>Cry, Akulina,</p>
<p>Before your dear father….</p>
<p>Then the bride brings her best nuptial bedding and lays it down on the floor for her girlfriends to spend the night. She herself lies down on the edge of this bed, closest to the door. In the morning she is the first to awake, and she rouses the rest with a song:</p>
<p>Get up, my dear friends,</p>
<p>Get up and wash yourselves with spring water,</p>
<p>Dry yourselves with a white towel.</p>
<p>The white dawn is rising,</p>
<p>My adversaries are getting up,</p>
<p>They get up and are about</p>
<p>To tear me away from my father and mother,</p>
<p>And from my dear girlfriends.</p>
<p>The girls get up and go to the groom’s house for breakfast. Afterwards, they return and have breakfast with the bride. All the while they honor the bride and the groom with songs and receive small payments for their singing.</p>
<p>Each village has its own specialists to participate in the wedding ceremony, and most important are the female song leaders. Almost every village has one woman who knows the wedding songs better than anyone else. She is invited to weddings as the song leader. The other singers are girlfriends of the bride and relatives of the couple, and for their performance they collect money that is later divided equally among them. The payment, however, is very small, and the singers come mostly for refreshments and vodka.</p>
<p>[Once the breakfasts are completed,] the bride’s girlfriends begin preparing her for the wedding ceremony. They undo her braid and comb out the hair,2 while she laments:</p>
<p>My dear girlfriends,</p>
<p>Do not unweave my auburn tresses,</p>
<p>Do not remove the scarlet ribbon,</p>
<p>Spare my maidenly beauty;</p>
<p>Do not don me with wifely drabness,</p>
<p>Maidenly beauty is fleeting,</p>
<p>The dreariness of womanhood is endless.</p>
<p>Then the bride is dressed in a blouse, skirts, a sarafan, shoes, and so forth.</p>
<p>In some villages, women wear sarafans to the wedding ceremony, and only afterwards put on the checkered or striped woolen skirt known as a <em>panyova</em> that identifies an engaged or married woman. In other villages, a woman wears a <em>panyova</em> during the wedding ceremony. She puts it on in the following manner: She stands on a bench in her shift while her brother holds the <em>panyova</em> so that she can jump into it. For a long time she resists, turning away and saying: “I’ll jump if I want to, and I won’t if I don’t.” Her mother prevails upon her with words like these: “Jump in, my child. Jump in, my dear. You can’t remain a maiden for the rest of your life. Be smart, be sensible.” Finally the young woman jumps into the <em>panyova</em>, and her brother ties it.</p>
<p>The groom arrives with his entourage. The bride’s father seats her at the table. If the bride’s father has died, she is assisted by her godfather and intones the lament: “A day is bleak without the sun, as my party is bleak without my dear father.”</p>
<p>The groom steps down from the cart. At this moment he is accosted by the female members of the bride’s family. They wear fur coats inside out and make frightening gestures with stakes and oven forks, intended to prevent the “intruder” from entering the house. Finally, the best man gives the women vodka, and they let the groom pass. When the groom enters the house, the bride is seated at the table surrounded by her father, godfather, and brothers, all brandishing whips and cudgels. They block the groom’s path so that he cannot take a seat next to his bride at the table. The groom and his entourage, also with whips in their hands, approach the table and demand to receive the bride. Now the “selling of the bride” begins. Her father places a five-kopeck piece on each corner of the table and says: “Cover these.” The best man, acting on the groom’s behalf, covers each coin with another. The bride’s father then says: “Now gild the bride.” The best man places a few more coins in the center of the table. Then the groom is allowed to approach the bride and sit next to her. The bride’s mother3 gathers up the money from the table and gives it to the bride; the mother then serves a small meal, consisting of no more than three dishes. After everyone has eaten and drunk, a candle is lit in front of the icon, and the bride’s parents bestow their blessing upon the groom and bride. At the same time, the best man, who is outdoors, walks three times around the groom’s cart, holding a cup filled with water and hops, and sprinkles the horses and the people. Bowing to the people, he says: “Orthodox Christian folk! Fair girls are sisters to us, young lads are brothers to us, young women are aunts to us, young men are uncles to us, old men are grandfathers to us, old women are grandmothers to us! Bless our young prince on his way to the temple of God, to face God’s judgment, to put on a golden crown, to kiss a golden cross.” The people reply: “God bless you. We wish you luck.” The best man spills some oats onto the groom’s seat in the cart and proceeds to do the same in the bride’s cart.4 The couple emerges from the house. The groom helps his bride into her cart. The bride, whose face is covered with a towel, is joined in the cart by her godmother, sisters, and aunts. The groom and his company lead the way in his cart.</p>

<p>On the way to the church, as the wedding procession passes through small villages, it is repeatedly halted by the people there, who allow it to continue on its way only after the groom’s entourage has passed around drinks. The groom and his party arrive at the church completely drunk, and if any vodka should happen to remain, they will usually take advantage of the commotion to finish it off inside the church. During the ceremony the bride has her hair undone, a sign of sadness. (Unmarried women always appear with their hair down at funerals for their relatives.) After the wedding ceremony, in the church vestibule and with many people looking on, the godmother does up the new wife’s hair into two braids, placing an underkerchief (<em>povoinik</em>) and a regular kerchief on her head. Then both processions, in the same manner in which they arrived, go to the groom’s house, where the parents of the newlyweds are waiting for them. At the doorstep, oats and hops are thrown at the couple. The newlyweds kiss the icon that the husband’s mother is holding, and accept bread-and-salt from his father.5 At this point the young couple break the bread in half and place it on a shelf, a ceremony that is apparently symbolic of the equal property rights of the spouses. The couple take their seats at the table, on which they find two bottles of vodka bound together with a ribbon. The husband’s parents untie the ribbon and offer drinks to the guests. The husband’s mother removes the kerchief from her daughter-in-law’s head and presents her with a new one.</p>
<p>After this, the best man and the godmother take the bridal couple by the hand and lead them to a cabin away from the main house. There the newlyweds will find a chicken pie on the table, and after they have eaten it, the godmother helps the bride to take off her kerchief, sarafan, and shoes, and then proceeds to remove the groom’s boots. The groom is expected to have a silver coin in his right boot. The bride will shake the coin out and keep it. Then the best man asks the groom: “Why did you marry?” The groom is supposed to reply: “To provide for a wife and to share a household with her.” The godmother directs the same question to the bride, who replies: “To sew shirts for my husband, to clothe him, and to bear him sons.” At this point, the best man puts the couple to bed, so that the wife lies on her husband’s one arm while he embraces her with the other one. The best man likewise intertwines the legs of the couple and covers them with a blanket before retiring from the cabin with the godmother. Occasionally, before the arrival of the couple, the bride’s elder brother and his wife come to the cabin “to warm the bed for the newlyweds.” They lie down and embrace in the nuptial bed while the newlyweds eat the chicken pie. When the couple together with the best man approach the bed, the best man exclaims in amazement: “What are this stallion and his mare doing here?” and he tries to drive them out of the bed with a whip. But they refuse and can be persuaded to leave only by an offer of vodka. When the newlyweds are finally alone, many curious eyes and ears (including sometimes children’s ears) watch and listen near the door. If the husband learns that his wife is not a virgin, he may mete out punishment at once. The punishment can be quite brutal, including kicking her and pinching her stomach and private parts.</p>
<p>There was a case here of a young man being married against his will because his parents were eager for him to wed a well-to-do young woman whose father was allegedly giving fifteen rubles in dowry. When he found out his wife was not a virgin, he subjected her to such cruel treatment that only a few months after the wedding, this young woman in her prime had turned sickly-looking. “He plucked her underbelly clean,” her mother said later. He also would lock her in a shed with only a tiny opening for a window and keep her there for days without food. At night he locked her up and went off to his mistress, a widow who lived in the same village. He habitually dragged his wife by the hair and beat her with whatever was handy. He relented only when the poor woman, whose misfortune it was to be “terribly submissive,” became pregnant (despite the beatings and humiliation, he had sexual relations with her), because he could have risked imprisonment for abusing a pregnant woman.</p>
<p>But let me return to the wedding. While the newlyweds stay in the cabin, the party is well under way in the main house. Women and unmarried young people dance dressed as buffoons (<em>skomorokhi</em>). After an hour or two, the best man and the godmother go “to get the newlyweds.” The godmother takes off the bride’s shift and hands it to the godfather. The godfather (or best man) puts the shift on a ceramic plate. The godmother washes the couple, and they get dressed. This time the bride is supposed to wear her brightest sarafan and kerchief (at the wedding ceremony, blue or white colors are usually worn, and they are considered “dull”). When the couple have dressed and are on their way to the house, the best man walks in front of them carrying the plate with the shift on it. In the house he gives the shift to the groom’s family for inspection. At the same time the buffoons take dishes off the shelves and break them on the floor as a sign that everything is accomplished.6 If there are no indications that the bride was unchaste, her parents are offered the first drink with great honors. If it turns out that she was not virtuous, the first drinks are offered to the groom’s parents, and the bride’s parents are given a mug with a hole in the bottom so that the drink leaks out the moment the best man removes the finger he held over the hole while he was pouring the vodka. If a woman marries a man she was making love to before the wedding, she resorts to the following ruse, with her husband’s approval: she hides the shift she was wearing during her last menstrual period and puts it on before the wedding ceremony.</p>
<p>When the godmother wakes up the couple and takes the shift off the young wife, the husband’s mother is frequently waiting behind the door to see the garment. I recall an instance when a mother was offended because the shift was taken off her new daughter-in-law in her absence. Another story is recounted about a “loose” girl who, once she was in bed with her new husband, admitted that she was not a virgin and offered him twenty rubles to help her cover up and avoid disgrace. He caught a chick, snapped its head off, and smeared the blood on his wife’s shift. Unfortunately, the matchmaker was eavesdropping, and when she handed the girl’s shift to the mother-in-law, she explained that they should not bother to display it in the village. “Nowadays this custom is being abandoned because almost all the girls are regarded as unchaste.”7</p>
<p>The party in the main house goes on until the wee hours. Then the newlyweds retire for the night.</p>
<p>In the morning, the best man and the godmother wake up the bridal couple. The godmother orders the young wife to sweep the floors. Copper coins have been tossed around on the floor beforehand, and the wife is told to give her mother-in-law any coins she finds. This is done to find out if the young wife is a thief, and also to see how well she sweeps the floor. After breakfast the newlyweds have to fetch a tub of water. When they are returning with the water, the father of the groom8 waylays them and pours the first tub of water on them. Then the neighbors, too, are entitled to douse them with the second and the third tubs. After this, the young wife presents the groom’s father a kerchief with which he covers the tub (or pail). From this moment no one can touch the tub, and anyone who does so is whipped by the father. The couple place the tub they have brought at the entrance to the house. At the same time, married women, straddling broomsticks and with their hands covered with chimney soot, chase the neighbors and smear their faces. When the father says “Enough!” the women stop, and the neighbors come to the tub to wash off the soot. As they do so, they drop a kopeck or two, and occasionally even three kopecks, into the tub, while the young wife is standing nearby with a towel ready to help them dry themselves. “If the women are funny and can make people laugh, the young wife may get as much as a whole ruble.”</p>
<p>The wife’s parents usually celebrate all night long at the house of their new son-in-law. In the morning the entire family of the groom accompanies the new wife’s parents back to their home. Occasionally, the newlyweds also go along. In some villages, processions of this type do not occur, and the whole party just rides off in wagons. A supply of vodka is taken along, and naturally everyone gets drunk. During the ride, they sing songs and bang on scythes, and the women from the groom’s family wave at everyone while flourishing the bride’s shift over their heads. Of course, this procession is a major attraction for the villagers, who come to gawk at the couple and to make jokes that are quite obscene. The revelers call on relatives in neighboring villages, jump out of the wagons, and dance, all the while showing off the shift.</p>
<p>“Did you ride like this, too? Did they also take your shift for all to see?”</p>
<p>“Of course I did. I couldn’t help it. But I shut my eyes and did not look.”</p>
<p>[A number of legends and magical beliefs about marriage persisted in the villages studied by Semyonova, and she mentions a few of these.]</p>
<p>There is a legend about a young woman who ordered her brothers to slay her betrothed, and then she arranged a feast at which she regaled the guests with pies baked with his flesh and wine distilled from his brain.</p>
<p>A woman who seeks to charm a man into making love to her washes the menstrual blood off her shift and secretly places the blood—or, more accurately, water with traces of the blood in it—in the kvass or tea that she offers to the object of her desire.</p>
<p>Lovers pledge fidelity by making an oath on the Holy Sacraments. They say, for example: “May I forever be denied the Sacraments if I fail to marry you.” They may also pledge their troth to one another by a vow to “Moist Mother Earth,” and occasionally they eat some soil to affirm the oath. But the strongest and most inviolable oath is one made on the Holy Sacraments.</p>
<p>At the wedding ceremony, the following superstitions are common:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>When the groom arrives to take the bride to the church and pays his way, as they say, through the entryway to the main room of the house, he must be preceded into the room by a blood relative of the bride, lest as [an unaccompanied] “stranger” he bring trouble and discord to the bride’s family.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The best man watches the behavior of the horses before the departure of the couple. If the horses are standing with their heads down, it means the couple will live unhappily. If the horses are in good spirits but quiet, the couple will live in peace. If the horses are violent, the newly weds will live in discord.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The bride and the groom are seated on oats. This is supposed to bring wealth into the family.</p>
</li>

<p>If the husband begins to undo his wife’s hair himself after the wedding ceremony, this too will ensure accord in family life.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Returning from the church, the young wife, on entering the house, grabs the lintel with both hands so that “the husband will love her.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When the mother-in-law shows the couple to the table, no one should pass between the husband and wife. Otherwise they will live in discord.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sorcerers and witches are feared at the time of the wedding, for it is easiest to put a curse on the couple when they are in the church or returning home after the ceremony. In the church a spell can be cast “through the wind” onto the couple’s backs. When newlyweds enter the house, it is not difficult to toss in their path a piece of string tied into a knot with a spell on it. The effects of such a curse may be lack of affection between the husband and wife, illness, lack of appetite, and the like.9</p>

<p>In former times, the father of an “unchaste” bride had to wear a yoke on the morning following the wedding after the discovery of his daughter’s shame. The former partner of an “unchaste” woman may spread a bast mat on the church’s porch as the newlyweds exit after the ceremony.</p>
<p>[Now we learn about the expenses connected with the village’s fall festival, during which weddings were usually held.]10</p>
<p>The harvest was good, and this year the village’s big annual holiday surrounding St. Michael’s Day was celebrated for an entire week. The expenditures for it varied according to the wealth of particular households. The well-to-do peasant Ivan Lunkov, whose family consists of seventeen members and produces a yearly turnover of 500 rubles, purchased two and a half pails of vodka [the equivalent of 8.12 gallons or fifty bottles] at 5.5 rubles per pail; he slaughtered eight sheep (a sheep costs 3–3.5 rubles), one hog at 4 rubles, and provided various other foods, including flour, groats, cabbage, cucumbers, pickled apples, sunflower seeds, nuts, bagels, tea, and sugar, in all amounting to 8–10 rubles. So, the total outlay for his holiday could not have been less than 50 rubles.</p>
<p>Vasilii Yeryomin, a peasant of average means (a yearly turnover of 80–100 rubles), spent about 18 rubles on the holiday festivities. He slaughtered an ox worth 10 rubles, bought a half-pail of vodka [ten bottles] for 3.2 rubles, and so forth.</p>
<p>The poor peasant Ustin Guskov had to lay out 9 rubles to entertain his relatives. He purchased a “pitiable” one and a half pounds [of meat apparently] for 4.5 rubles, one quarter-pail [five bottles] of vodka for 1.6 rubles, and used up 108 pounds of flour on pirogs, plus some butter and millet.</p>
<p>[The published version of Semyonova’s study contains two more reports on what are evidently actual marriages. These are rendered in conversational form.]</p>
<p>A woman who recently married off her son tells the following story:</p>
<p>“Sinner that I am, I listened to them talking on their first night. They apparently had been having fun and were so quiet that I was going to leave when I heard Ivan say to her: ‘I did not even dream you would marry me!’ ‘Why so?’ ‘Well, at the engagement party you looked so nice, and I am pockmarked and cross-eyed. I thought you would turn me down.’ The girl sighed: ‘Well, I didn’t. Maybe now you will treat me better for my good heart.’ I laughed at this. She is a quiet girl, all right. You don’t need any better. To tell the truth, Ivan does not have the looks, although he is my own child. Moreover, at twenty-two he is rather old for her, already past the draft age, while she is just seventeen. But she is an orphan and poverty-stricken. She really owns nothing. Whatever she did have was lost last year when she and her mother were burned out of house and home and escaped with nothing but the shirts on their backs. Since then they have been living with whoever will give them shelter <em>[po fateram]</em>. We, thank goodness, eat our own bread! And, indeed, my Vaniushka is a gentle boy and a good provider.”</p>
<p>From a conversation between two peasant women:</p>
<p>“Have you heard that the master’s horseherd Ilya got married?”</p>
<p>“You don’t say!”</p>
<p>“No kidding. And he’s found a really nice girl, one from Sergeevka.”</p>
<p>“But wasn’t he courting Nastasia?”</p>
<p>“So what if he was? She turned him down, saying she wouldn’t marry a drunkard. The other day he went to the master to get his last payment and says: ‘Congratulate me, I’ve gotten married!’ And he is crying and wiping away the tears with his fist. He loved Nastasia very much, really yearned for her. On his way back from the master’s, he met with Nastasia in a barn, and they got into a long conversation. They felt really sorry for one another, and they were both weeping and kissing.”</p>
<p>“Good gracious!”</p>
<p>“Just as they say: it is one thing to fool around, and quite another to get married.”</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The party is referred to in Russian as the <em>devichnik</em>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The wearing of a single braid was the sign of an unmarried woman, and this act of uncombing it had powerful symbolic significance in marking the bride’s move from her natal family to her husband’s. In connection with the marriage ceremony, the newly wedded woman’s hair was woven into two braids.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The choice of “mother” here is arbitrary. Semyonova uses the term <em>svakha</em>, the female form of the word for matchmaker. According to the pioneer Russian folklorist Vladimir Dal’, the male and female variants of this word can designate the parents of the marriage couple, the godparents, uncles and aunts, or any member of the extended family.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As explained later, the grains sprinkled into the carts have the symbolic significance of wishing good fortune and plenty.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The presentation of bread and salt was (and remains today) the customary greeting for honored guests in rural Russia.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That is, the hymen is broken.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This final remark, in quotes, like many others in the text, is inserted as an indication of what people in the village generally are saying and does not necessarily belong to the matchmaker.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Again, the word is matchmaker (<em>svat</em>) and could refer in this context logically to either the father of the groom or the father of the bride. I have chosen to use the former.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Here are expressed the dangers associated with liminality. When people are in transition from one stable category of being to another, they are most vulnerable to the action of evil spirits and must be especially alert to defend themselves from these forces.</p>
