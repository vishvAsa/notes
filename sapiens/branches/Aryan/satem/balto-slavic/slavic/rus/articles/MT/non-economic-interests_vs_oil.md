Those who fail to account for the interests of conspiring elites (yes people will smear you as "conspiracy theorists"), religion (overt & covert), ethnicity and energy needs, but look at things purely in economic terms tend to get things wrong. Don't be fooled by the fact they might be widely published & advertised in MSM. 

It is sometimes surprising to see rich left-liberals, who live in large houses with multiple motor vehicles, overlook the fact that as of today there is no comfortable modern life without the exothermic consumption of fossil fuels. What to say of the uses of coal tar or petroleum derivatives. Hence, it is rather notable that the Occidental confederation has made several moves that have dropped the axe on its own foot while fighting the Rus in a thinly proxied war. 

- In WW2, Germany lost because of lack of sufficient liquid fossil fuels -- it had captured the French supplies & had some from Romania but failed to take those under Rus or pa~nchanetra control. 
- The 5-eye-s had a bottomless supply from the US even if the west Asian wells fell. 
- The Japanese conquered the archipelago supplies which could have allowed them to keep fighting for a while. However, transporting safely against American assaults was never going to be easy -- they were too stretched for it especially after failing to extend their perimeter against the US at Midway.+++(5)+++ 
  
## 2022 war comments
The German attempt to take the Rus Caspian fields failed again from the resolute defense of it by the Rus. The Japanese geopolitical approach seems to be quite conservative after their heroic effort but subsequent rout in WW2. We are seeing noises that are not covered prominently in the 5IV press of the J wanting to continue with negotiations with the Rus to keep the liquid FF flowing into their system. J is an industrialized modern economy; it seems that they are only going to makes noises that sound pleasing to the 5IVs+++(=5 eyes + vassals)+++ regarding Rus FF but not really act on it. Its industry leaders are pushing strongly against any such move which would end up being disastrous for the J all for ruining the Rus for the 5IVs. Not that the J are exactly thinking of opening a front to take Sakhalin or Kurils. 

This brings us to the real question that cannot be easily addressed in public -- what about the shUlapuruSha-s? Are they not a highly industrialized economy too? But as in WW2 they have no liquid FF supplies.+++(4)+++ Are they going to pay the price of deindustrializing? Are the 5Is going to keep them afloat with oil as their vassal?
