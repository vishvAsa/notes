      <description>&lt;p&gt;Source: TW&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What are the yardsticks for measuring the advance of the Rus in Ukr? It is not easy to get a clear picture especially because of the smoke-screens raised by the Occidental propaganda machinery. We see some anti-Rus handles on the TL swallowing all those claims&amp;amp; eagerly RTing them. On the other hand some Western &amp;amp; Rus handles are relatively realistic. The latter seem to admit that the going is not as good as they would have liked but it is hardly doom &amp;amp; gloom yet. They also seem to admit some of the effects of the classic navyonmatta style warfare waged by the Occident on economic assets.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&#34;https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1530647790153613325.html&#34;&gt;TW&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;From a H perspective, one sees several convergences &amp;amp; some divergences between TSP &amp;amp; Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Even if you subscribe to counterfactual ideas that plague the modern H one cannot deny that the ancient urbanity of the Panjab is the mother of all Indian cities&amp;amp; the root of Indian civilization. Similarly, the Ukr was the mother of the Rus cities &amp;amp; at the heart of their rise. However, it was lost to the core Rus much like sindhu &amp;amp; the pA~nchanada to the H.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
