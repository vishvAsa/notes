title = "02 Note on the Text"

+++

I have used the Library of Congress system of transliteration throughout; however, some minor modifications have been made in the text so that readers unfamiliar with Russian can approximate the correct pronunciation of names and terms. For example, the Russian letter *Ã«* has been rendered as *yo;* soft vowels are rendered as *ya, yu*, and *ye* at the beginning of a word, and as *ia, iu*, and *e* elsewhere. Soft signs have been omitted from transliterated Russian first names in the body of the book but retained in the notes for proper reference.
