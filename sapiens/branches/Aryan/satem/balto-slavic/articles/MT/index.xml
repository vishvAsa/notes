      <description>&lt;p&gt;Some linguists have proposed that the Thracian branch of IE was specifically related to Baltic. We are generally sympathetic to that view â€“ in the least we see it as being a sister group to Balto-Slavic to the exclusion of Indo-Iranian. Of course, there is little we can do about testing this conjecture from a linguistic standpoint because Thracian is dead and gone. However, this opens another line of investigation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
