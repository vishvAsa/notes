Gandhiji once recited the Quran at a Valmiki Basti Temple in Delhi. The woman got up from the crowd and asked Gandhi not to do that. Gandhi asked, "Why?" The woman said it was "against our religion." Gandhi said, "I don't believe so." The woman replied that we do not consider you worthy to order our religion. Gandhi said to take the vote of the people present there. "Can religion be determined by votes?" the woman asked. Gandhi responded, "You are hindering my religion." The woman replied that he is illegally interfering in the religion of crores of Hindus. Gandhi said, "I listen to the Quran." The woman said that she opposes it.

Hundreds of Valmiki youths stood up for the woman and said, "Read the Quran in this temple, but before reciting the Quran in the temple recite the Gita or Ramayana in mosque.‚Äù Seeing the growing protests, Gandhi called the police who arrived and caught the protesters. 107 cases were registered against them. Gandhi then recited the Quran in the same temple under police protection. Source: Vishwashghat by Guru Dutt End of the thread.
