## British Famines
- British rule created famine of 1877-79 which wiped out HALF the Dalit population of Madras state.
- Factors there include artificial famines (Eg: 1943 Bengal famine), food exports at time of famine ([Ja](https://jambudveep.wordpress.com/2011/01/08/an-explanatory-note-on-the-famines-in-india/)).
- Lytton's famine exacerbation. ([TE](http://www.tehelka.com/2014/06/remembering-indias-forgotten-holocaust/))
- Churchill diverted essential grain away from Bengal to \*reserves\* in Europe.
- The time of severe famines in colonial Asia coincided with lack of famines in the colonist homelands.

## Salt
- East India Company controlled all salt production in Bengal. They increased taxes on salt by 1000%.
- And to prevent salt smuggling, which was the only way to get affordable salt in interior India, they built a huge 12 feet tall hedge which ran 1500 km across face of India. This hedge, in 1869, extended from the Indus to the Mahanadi in Madras, a distance of 2,300 miles; guarded by nearly 12,000 men and petty officers.
- Caused salt starvation - especially in times of famine. \[[W](http://www.rmoxham.freeserve.co.uk/salt%20starvation.htm), [Amazon](http://www.amazon.ca/The-Great-Hedge-India-Moxham/dp/1841194670), [RH](https://rhulgeopolitics.wordpress.com/2014/11/18/the-great-hedge-of-india/)\]
