## Rājataraṅgiṇī
It is interesting to note that 𑆯𑇀𑆫𑆵𑆮𑆫 {śrīvara} in his 15th century 𑆫𑆳𑆘𑆠𑆫𑆕𑇀𑆓𑆴𑆟𑆵 {Rājataraṅgiṇī} calls the local vernacular language of Kaśmīra as the 𑆲𑆴𑆤𑇀𑆢𑆶𑆱𑇀𑆡𑆳𑆤𑆮𑆳𑆖𑇀 or the "Language of the Hindus". So in the 15th century, the Kashmiri language was considered by him to be the language of the Hindus of Kashmir. He makes a distinction between

1. 𑆥𑆳𑆫𑆱𑆴𑆨𑆳𑆰𑆳 (Persian)
2. 𑆠𑆶𑆫𑆶𑆰𑇀𑆑𑆨𑆳𑆰𑆳 (Turkic)
3. 𑆲𑆴𑆤𑇀𑆢𑆶𑆱𑇀𑆡𑆳𑆤𑆮𑆳𑆖𑇀 (Language of Hindus, Kashmiri)
