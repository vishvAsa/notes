NOTE

Swami Vivekananda left Calcutta for the West, for the second time, on
the 20th June, 1899, by the BISN steamship Golconda. In reading these
pages the reader should remember that Swamiji wrote them in a light,
humorous tone in Bengali, which it is impossible to render in English.

The [second section](memoirs_of_european_travel_ii.htm) of these
memoirs, relates to his return journey from the West at the end of 1900.

These were originally published in the Udbodhan.
