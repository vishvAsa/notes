## LIII

PERROS GUIREC  
BERTAGNE,  
*22nd September, 1900*.

To Miss Alberta Sturges  
                    on her 23rd birthday

The mother's heart, the hero's will,  
The softest flower's sweetest feel;  
The charm and force that ever sway  
The altar fire's flaming play;  
The strength that leads, in love obeys;  
Far-reaching dreams, and patient ways,  
Eternal faith in Self, in all  
The sight Divine in great in small;  
All these, and more than I could see  
Today may "Mother" grant to thee.

Ever yours with love and blessings,

VIVEKANANDA.

  
DEAR ALBERTA,

This little poem is for your birthday. It is not good, but it has all my
love. I am sure, therefore, you will like it.

Will you kindly send a copy each of the pamphlets there to madame
Besnard, Clairoix, Bres Compiegne, Oise, and oblige?

Your well-wisher,  
VIVEKANANDA.
