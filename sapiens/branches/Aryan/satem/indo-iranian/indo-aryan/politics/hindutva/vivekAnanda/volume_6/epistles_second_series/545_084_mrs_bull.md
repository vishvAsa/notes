## LXXXIV

READING,  
*6th Oct., 1895.*

DEAR MRS. BULL,

. . . I am translating a little book on Bhakti with Mr. Sturdy with
copious commentaries, which is to be published soon. This month I am to
give two lectures in London and one in Maidenhead. This will open up the
way to some classes and parlour lectures. We do not wish to make any
noise but to go quietly. . . 

Yours with best wishes,

VIVEKANANDA.
