*To Miss Josephine MacLeod*

HIGH VIEW, CAVERSHAM,  
READING, ENGLAND,  
*20th October, 1895*.

DEAR JOE JOE,

This note is to welcome the Leggetts to London. This being in a sense my
native country, I send you my welcome first, I shall receive your
welcome next Tuesday the 22nd at Princes' Hall half past eight p.m.

I am so busy till Tuesday, I am afraid, I shall not be able to run in to
see you. I, however, shall come to see you any day after that. Possibly
I may come on Tuesday.

With everlasting love and blessings,

Yours,

VIVEKANANDA.
