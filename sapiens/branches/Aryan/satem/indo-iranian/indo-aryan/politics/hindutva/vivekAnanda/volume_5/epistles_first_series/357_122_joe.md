I send you the letter to Madame Calvé.  
.    .    .  
I am somewhat better, but of course far from what I expected. A great
idea of quiet has come upon me. I am going to retire for good — no more
work for me. If possible, I will revert to my old days of begging.

All blessings attend you, Joe; you have been a good angel to me.

With everlasting love,

VIVEKANANDA.
