**PREFACE**

In my book *The Legacy of Muslim Rule in India*, I had said that “It is
not, pertinent here to make a detailed study of the Muslim slave system
which was an institution as peculiar as it was unique.” A detailed study
of the Muslim slave system in medieval India is being made here. In *The
Legacy* I had also said that “the best way to understand the content and
spirit of Muslim rule in India… is by going through Muslim scriptures
(as) all medieval chroniclers were scholars of Muslim law.” In their
writings they often quote from their holy books to vindicate the actions
of their conquerors and kings. Hence Muslim scriptural sources are
referred to quite often in the present work which is a study both in the
theory and practice of Islamic slavery
