14 GREY COAT GARDENS,  
WESTMINSTER, S. W.,  
*11th November, 1896*.

DEAR ALASINGA,

I shall most probably start on the 16th of December, or may be a day or
two later. I go from here to Italy, and after seeing a few places there,
join the steamer at Naples. Miss M체ller, Mr. and Mrs. Sevier, and a
young man called Goodwin are accompanying me. The Seviers are going to
settle at Almora. So is Miss M체ller. Sevier was an officer in the Indian
army for 5 years. So he knows India a good deal. Miss M체ller was a
Theosophist who adopted Akshay. Goodwin is an Englishman, through whose
shorthand notes it has been possible for the pamphlets to be published.

I arrive at Madras first from Colombo. The other people go their way to
Almora. I go from thence direct to Calcutta. I will write you the exact
information when I start.

Yours affly.,

VIVEKANANDA.

PS. The first edition of *R훮ja-Yoga* is sold out, and a second is in the
press. India and America are the biggest buyers.
