> § 1. The Bond of Alms
>
>  1. The Sangh was an organised body, the membership of which was
> not open to all.  
>  2. To be a mere Parivrajaka was not enough to give the Parivrajaka
> a membership of the Sangh.  
>  3. It is only after the Parivrajaka had obtained Upasampada that
> he could become a member of the Sangh.  
>  4. The Sangh was an independent body. It was independent even of
> its founder.  
>  5. It was autonomous. It could admit anyone it liked to its
> membership. It could dismember \[=expel\] any member, provided it
> acted in accordance with the rules of the Vinaya Pitaka.  
>  6. The only cord which bound the Bhikkhu to the Laity was alms.  
>  7. The Bhikkhu depended upon alms, and it is the laity who gave
> alms.  
>  8. The laity was not organised.  
>  9. There was a Sangha-Diksha, or a ceremony for marking the
> initiation of a person in the Sangh.  
>  10. Sangha-Diksha included both initiation into the Sangh, as well
> as into the Dhamma.  
>  11. But there was no separate Dhamma-Diksha for those who wanted
> to be initiated into the Dhamma but did not wish to become members of
> the Sangh, one of the consequences of which was to go from home into
> homelessness.  
>  12. This was a grave omission. It was one of the causes which
> ultimately led to the downfall of Buddhism in India.  
>  13. For this absence of the initiation ceremony left the laity
> free to wander from one religion to another and, worse still, follow
> \[them\] at one and the same time.
>
>   
> § 2. Mutual Influence
>
>  1. However, the bond of alms was enough for a Bhikkhu to reform an
> erring member of the laity.  
>  2. In this connection the following rules mentioned in the
> Anguttara Nikaya are worthy of attention.  
>  3. In addition to these prescriptions, the laity had a general
> right to complain against a Bhikkhu to other Bhikkhus, against any
> mischief or misconduct.  
>  4. The moment the complaint reached the Buddha and he had verified
> it, the relevant rule in the Vinaya Pithaka was amended to make the
> repetition of such a conduct, an offence against the Sangh.  
>  5. The Vinaya Pithaka is nothing but redress of the complaints of
> the laity.  
>  6. Such was the relation between the Bhikkhu and the Laity.
>
>   
> § 3. Dhamma of the Bhikkhu and the Dhamma of the Upasaka
>
>  1. Some critics of Buddhism allege that Buddhism is not a
> religion.  
>  2. No attention should be paid to such criticism. But if any reply
> is to be given, it is that Buddhism is the only real religion and
> those who do not accept this must revise their definition of
> religion.  
>  3. Other critics do not go so far as this. What they say is that
> Buddhism as a religion is concerned only with the Bhikkhu. It does not
> concern itself with the common man. Buddhism kept the common man
> outside its pale.  
>  4. The references to the Bhikkhu occur so often in the dialogues
> of the Buddha that they go to strengthen the criticism.  
>  5. It therefore becomes necessary to make the matter clear.  
>  6. Was the Dhamma common to both? Or is there any part of the
> Dhamma which is binding on the Bhikkhu but not so on the laity?  
>  7. Merely because the sermons were addressed to the gathering of
> the Bhikkhus, it must not be supposed that what was preached was
> intended to apply to them only. What was preached applied to both.  
>  8. That the Buddha had the laity in mind when he preached: (1) The
> Panchasila, (2) The Ashtanga Marga, and (3) The Paramitas, is quite
> clear from the very nature of things; and no argument, really
> speaking, is necessary.  
>  9. It is \[for\] those who have not left their homes and who are
> engaged in active life that Panchasila, Ashtanga Marga, and Paramitas
> are essential. It is they who are likely to transgress them, and not
> the Bhikkhu who has left home, who is not engaged in active life, and
> who is not likely to transgress them.  
>  10. When the Buddha, therefore, started preaching his Dhamma, it
> must be \[=have been\] principally for the laity.  
>  11. It is not, however, necessary to rely merely on inference.
> There is direct evidence to disprove the criticism.  
>  12. Reference may be made to the following sermon:  
>  13. Once while the Lord was staying at Shravasti in Jeta's Grove
> in Anathapindika's pleasance, there came to him the lay follower
> Dhammika, with \[an\]other five hundred lay followers; who, after due
> salutations, took his seat to one side, and addressed the Lord as
> follows:  
>  14. "What conduct, O Lord, perfects both those that are Bhikkhus
> and those that are only Upasakas--i.e., those who are homeless and
> those who are not?  
>  15. "Let the almsmen seated round with these lay followers learn
> the saving truth."  
>  16. The Blessed Lord said: "Give ear, almsmen. Hear, and keep the
> rules prescribed.  
>  17. "Go not thy round when noon is past; betime seek alms. Snares
> greet the untimely guest.  
>  18. "Before thou seek thy meal, clear thou thy mind of zest for
> forms, sounds, odours, taste, and luck.  
>  19. "Thine alms received, return alone, to sit apart and think,
> with fixed mind that never stays \[=strays?\] abroad  
>  20. "In talk with pious folk, almsmen, let thy theme be the
> Doctrine.  
>  21. "Treat alms, cell, bed, water, and rinsings just as means, and
> nothing more.  
>  22. "Such reasoned use will leave an almsman as unstained as \[a\]
> lotus leaf whereon no drop of water rests.  
>  23. "I now pass to the conduct which perfects the lay followers.
> To them I say:  
>  24. "Slay not, nor doom to death, nor sanction slaughter. Do no
> violence to aught that lives, strong or weak. Love all living
> beings.  
>  25. "No layman wittingly should thieve or order theft; take but
> what others give.  
>  26. "Shun incontinence as it were a pit of fire; on failing
> continence, debauch no wedded wife.  
>  27. "In conclaves, courts, let him not be; let him not prompt or
> sanction lies; let him renounce untruth.  
>  28. "Observe this law: shun drink; make no man drink; sanction no
> drinking. Mark how drink to madness leads.  
>  29. "Through drink, fools sin, and egg lax brethren on to sin. So
> flee this maddening vice, this folly, bliss of fools.  
>  30. "Slay not, steal not, lie not; from strong drink keep away;
> refrain from lechery.  
>  31. "So make thy sabbath vows as week succeeds week, and keep with
> pious hearts this eight-fold festival.  
>  32. "At morn, these vows performed, with pious, thankful heart, be
> wise; and of thy means give almsmen food and drink.  
>  33. "Cherish thy parents well; follow a righteous trade.  
>  34. "Thus shall the layman, staunch, reach realms of light
> above."  
>  35. It will thus be seen that the Dharnma was the same for both.  
>  36. There are of course differences in the call made upon the
> two.  
>  37. A Bhikkhu must take five vows.  
>  38. He must take the vow that he shall not kill.  
>  39. He must take the vow that he shall not appropriate to himself
> property of another which has not been given to him.  
>  40. He must take the vow that he shall never tell a lie.  
>  41. He must take the vow that he shall not try to have carnal
> knowledge of a woman.  
>  42. He must take the vow that he shall never drink any
> intoxicating drink.  
>  43. All these rules are binding also upon the layman.  
>  44. The only difference lies in this: with the Bhikkhu they are
> vows which are not to be transgressed, with the layman they are moral
> obligations to be voluntarily honoured.  
>  45. Besides, there are two other differences which are
> noteworthy.  
>  46. A Bhikkhu cannot have private property. A layman can have.  
>  47. A Bhikkhu is free to enter parnibban. Nibbana is enough for a
> layman.  
>  48. These are the similarities and differences between a Bhikkhu
> and the layman.  
>  49. Dhamma, however, is the same for both.
