## LXXXVIII

MATH, BELUR,  
*15th December, 1898*.

YOUR HIGHNESS, (Maharaja of Khetri.)

Your very kind letter received with the order of 500 on Mr. Dulichand. I
am a little better now. Don't know whether this improvement will
continue or not.

Are you to be in Calcutta this winter, as I hear? Many Rajas are coming
to pay their respects to the new Viceroy. The Maharaja of Sikar is here,
I learn from the papers already.

Ever praying for you and yours,

Yours in the Lord,

VIVEKANANDA.
