We are incapable of nourishing any sinster feeling against the 
British Rule and it is thus impossible for any of us to be convicted of such a heinous charge as sedition. Such risks however, 
we must take * * They are the risks of our profession * * Their 
(the Government's) object is to humiliate the Poona leaders,

^T^HE cruel murder of Mr. Rand and Lieut. Ayerst 
threw the Anglo-Indian community.into a state of 
panic. The psychological day of the Jubilee selected by 
the murderer for his deed, raised suspicion in the Anglo- 
Indian mind that the murder was the result of a deep- 
laid plot by the Poona Brahmins. When the murderer 
made good his escape, the Anglo-Indians vented their 
feelings of revenge in an attack on the Indian press 
which, by its " seditious writings, " was considered to 
have fanned the people into frenzy. They clamoured for 
a very wide use of Sec. 124A of the Penal Code. 
They declared their misgivings about the suitability

of that section for trying subtle writers and speaker- 
and called for a mere stringent definition of sedition. 
They fell foul of Lord Sandhurst for not having vetoed 
the very recent election of Mr. Tilak to the Legislative 
Council. They feared* " lest in proclaiming that dis- 
loyalty is no disqualification for nomination by Govern- 
ment, to places of honour. Government themselves 
should make good citizenship at a discount." Extracts 
from the Poona press were published and though the 
Anglo-Indian papers modestly said that it was for them 
to * " establish a direct connection between this wild 
teaching and that deplorable event" still, *" the atmos- 
phere which such teaching must have created is pre- 
cisely the atomsphere in which violence to individuals, 
hatred of Government and widespread contempt for 
law and authority would necessarily grow as in a 
forcing house." 

The position of Mr. Tilak in the months immediately 
preceding the murder of Messrs. Rand and Ayerst was 
unenviable. His co-operation with the Bureaucracy 
had been bringing him slings from the vernacular papers 
belonging to the party led by Ranade and Gokhale. 
At the same time, every word of his speeches and wri- 
tings was sifted and translated by an ever-watchful 
Government and the malicious Anglo-Indian Press. 
Some of his simplest and most innocent remarks excited 
undeserving suspicion. When on the occassion of the 
Shivaji Festival, he had simply defended Afzulkhan's 
assassination by Shivaji, he was considered to have 
preached political murder. When he said " No 
copper plate was given to Mlenchhas (Mahomedans) to

rule over Hindustan, one "Justice/' who presumably 
was a ' Native ' and whose ignorance of Marathi was 
therefore unpardonable, quoted this sentence in the 
Times of India mistranslating it to apply to the Maho- 
medans and Christians as well and asked whether it 
did not amount to an incitement to sedition against the 
Govenment. When Mr. Tilak drew the attenton of 
the leaders of Poona to the " futility of mere clamour 
against the high-handedness of the authorities " and 
suggested that the best course for the Poona leaders 
was to have remained in the city (Poona) and formed 
vigilance-committees for each street and afforded pecu- 
niary help to the private plague hospital, the Times of 
India quoting the remark after the murder said " Though 
we do not offer any suggestions as to the view that a 
Jury might be persuaded to take of the Hon. Mr. Tilak's 
discourse on the * futility of mere clamour ' against 
Mr. Rand and his assistants, still some one with a 
pistol in his hand seems to have been in hearty agree- 
ment with the Honourable Member's distrust in the 
efficacy of ' mere clamour '." 

The sequence of dates also was considered to be sig- 
nificant. On May iith 1897, Mr. Tilak published the doc- 
trine of the " futility of mere clamour." On June 12th 
he supplemented it by justifying Shivaji's murder of 
Afzulkhan. At the same time he declared that " no 
copperplate has been given to the Mlenchhas (applicable 
equally to Mahomedans and Christians) by God to rule 
over India.'* If all these statements be put together, 
" do they not" said the average x\nglo-Indian, "amount 
clearly to a plea of pohtical murder ?" Lord Sandhurst 
was however saner. He did not tliink so. That is why 



THE LOKAMANYA 95 

after the murders of Rand and Ayerst he sanctioned 
the election of Mr. Tilak to the Legislative Council. 
But " the unreasoning panic into which the Anglo- 
Indian community was driven by such malicious at- 
tacks and its unfortunate success in inflaming the 
English people, forced the hands of the Secretary of 
State and Lord Sandhurst had to take measures which, 
it is beheved, he would never have sanctioned, if he 
had remained a free agent.*" 

So excited were the feelings of the Anglo-Indian com- 
munity that even " on the brink of a gaping grave 
giving a peep into the eternity " " the pride of the 
Europeans left no room in their hearts for better emo- 
tions " and persons like Dr. Cawasji Jehangir, once 
Sheriff of Bombay, were on the occassion of Mr. Rand's 
burial insulted and refused admission by the police at 
the cemetery. A Parsi lady who had attended the 
cemetery for the purpose of putting a wreath on the 
cof&n of Mr. Rand was also not admitted. The threat- 
ening speech of Mr. Lamb, the then Collector of Poona, 
foretelling that people would " find themselves under- 
going an experience to which they had not been accus- 
tomed " was another straw indicative of the direction 
of the wind. A punitive police was imposed on the 
Poona Municipality. Prof. Gokhale, immediately on 
his return from England and while yet ashore, had to 
concede " the best part of his attention " to the head 
of the Bombay Police — the result being a humiliating 
apology tendered by him to Lord Sandhurst, the Plague 
Committee and the British Soldiers. Mr. Tilak as the

editor of Kesari was arrested on 27th July 1897 at 
Bombay where he had gone to seek legal redress 
against the reckless statements made against him 
by the Times of India. The printer of the Kesari 
was also arrested. The Editors of the Poona 
Vaihhav, the Modavritta, the Pratod were also arrest- 
ed. The Editors of the Dnyanprakash and Sudharak 
bent their knees and saved themselves from pro- 
secution. The Natu Brothers were deported under 
the notorious regulations of 18 18. Altogether it 
appeared that a 'reign of terror ' had been fully 
established at Poona and that the Collector's threat 
had been literally carried out. 

After a series of preliminary proceedings Mr. Tilak 
was set free on bail by Mr. Justice Tyabji on August 
4th. The conclusion his Lordship arrived at was that 
*' the articles in question, * * about which he desired to 
say clearly * * that he gave no positive opinion one way 
or the other, were not necessarily of such a character as 
to lead one to the irresistible conclusion that the man 
responsible for such articles must be convicted upon 
them." One of the incriminating articles was a poem 
— the production of a poetaster — supposed to be ad- 
dressed by Shivaji to the Mahrattas exhorting them to 
be up and doing and the other was the report of Mr. 
Tilak's speech at the close of the Shivaji Festival de- 
fending Shivaji's murder of Afzulkhan . On this slen- 
der foundation was the edifice of the prosecution con- 
structed — a rhetorical piece in poetry from some obs- 
cure poet and a report of a speech defending Shivaji's 
greatness and insisting upon his claim to be recognised 
as a national hero. 



THE LOKAMANYA 97 

At the Bombay High Court, the trial commenced on 
August 8th, 1897 before Mr. Justice Strachey and a 
Special Jury of nine of whom six were Europeans, 
unacquainted with the Marathi language, " What with 
the tendencies of the times, th e present temper of the 
European community in India, the prejudice excited 
against the Mahrattas of Poona since the murders of 
Mr. Rand and Lieut. Ayerst "* the verdict was prac- 
tically a foregone conclusion. " The case was one of 
the greatest importance and involved the settlement 
of grave issues. It was too much to expect so young 
and inexperienced a judge as Mr. Arthur Strachey to 
rise equal to the importance of the issues before him "*. 
Had the trial been held at Poona both the Judge and 
the Jury could have acquitted themselves better on 
account of their intimate knowledge of the Vernacular. 
In vain did Mr. Tilak protest that the translations of 
the incriminating articles were incorrect ; in vain 
did Mr. Pugh, his Counsel point to Mr. Tilak 's fair cri- 
ticism of the Government during the Plague adminis- 
tration, his complimentary language with respect to 
Lord Sandhurst which showed that he {Mr. Tilak) could 
have had no animus against the Government. Though 
Mr. Lang, the Advocate-General, was scrupulously 
fair, the Judge dehvered a strongly prejudiced charge 
to the Jury. " It seemed that the Judge and the 
Advocate-General had interchanged places." " Mr. 
Justice Strachey freely referred to the famine and the 
plague * * told about the employment of British troops 
not being liked by the people * * passed on to 
the Poona murders " and " without the least hesita-

tion " declared that "the inevitable result was friction 
and such a state of tension and excited feeling that» 
no wonder it ultimately culminated in the mur- 
ders of Mr. Rand and Lieut. Ayerst." Of course he 
did not mean to suggest in any way that there was re- 
lation of cause and effect between " either of these 
articles and those abominable murders." Still the 
charge of the Judge tended to create strong prejudice 
against the accused, who was pronounced by 6 jurors 
to have committed sedition ; and the Judge after 
complimenting the accused on his remarkable ability 
and influence, sentenced him (14th September 1897), to 
rigorous imprisonment for i8th months. A special appeal 
was made to the Privy Council, but it was fruitless ; 
and in the meantime Mr. Tilak was serving his sentence 
in the Yeravda gaol. 

Such was the result of the conflict — the first of its 
kind in India — between the mighty Government of 
Bombay with its immense resources and a solitary citi- 
zen with nothing but truth, courage and a nation's 
sympathy to support him. Apparently it was a blow 
to Mr. Tilak. Since this time his relations with Gov- 
ernment were uniformly unfriendly and as a conse- 
quence even those who should have stood by him, 
generally kept him at an arm's length ; from this time 
the influential clique that guided the course of the 
Congress tried their best to put Mr. Tilak down. 
Of course, there were leaders like the Hon. Mr. (now 
Sir) Surendranath, whose relations with Mr. Tilak 
stood the shock of this prosecution and conviction. 
But the generality of the Moderate element shrank 
from any further co-operation with him. 



THE LOKAMANYA 99 

But while in one direction Mr. Tilak lost much of 
"that influence which went with moderatism, there was an 
immense accession of purity, strength and purpose to 
the National cause. Patriotism was, by his example 
and suffering lifted up from weak-kneed opportunism 
and humble mendicity to the high level of religion. 
Mr. Tilak's attitude was an object lesson to the people 
in manly fight and courage and suffering came to be 
recognised as the necessary qualities of a leader. The 
political leadership was, up to this time, the property 
of wealth, social position. Government patronage and 
oratorical powers. Now came the demand for leadership 
which would reveal tremendous powers of suffering 
for the cause. Evidently Mr. Tilak gave a deathblow 
to all conceptions of easy-going arm-chair leadership. 
He no longer basked in official sunshine. He was now 
no longer '* Honourable " — Rajamanya. He, however, 
became, what was infinitely greater, the " Lokamanya *' 
— the Honoured of the people. 

The gravest feature of this prosecution was Mr. 
Strachey's wholly untenable definition of ' sedition.* 
According to him ' disaffection ' did not mean any posi- 
tive feeling of hatred etc. towards the Government. It 
simply meant * want of affection.* Regarding this 
and another aspect of the case, the Daily Chronicle 
said : — 

*' Wildness, discontent, mischievous rubbish there 
may be in plenty. But we have got on with it and we 
shall get on with it again. Prove real sedition — above 
all, conclusively connect it with crime — and we should 
all favour sharp, stern punishment. But when it comes 
to overhauling poems and constructing elaborated in- 



100 LOKAMANYA TILAK 

nuendoes from eulogies of picturesque and popular 
bandits (?)... one feels that the Government are on. 
perilous path. 

" There is one aspect of the " sedition " trials in 
India which must not be lost sight of. And that is, the 
new definition of ' disaffection ' enunciated by Mr. 
Justice Strachey * * * According to him * disaffection* 
may be seditious even though it be simply strong dis- 
approval of some omission on the part of Government. 
We feel confident that such an interpretation of the law 
would not be tolerated in England and if not speedily 
over-ruled, may produce grave mischief in India." 

This was the considered opinion of an English news- 
paper and it amounts to a declaration that Mr. Tilak 
was unjustly convicted by an incorrect, arbitrary and 
novel interpretation of Sec. 124-A of the Penal Code. 
Far from over-ruling this interpretation, the Imperial 
Legislative Council gave legal status to it by amending 
on i8th February 1898 the notorious section in the 
teeth of Indian opposition. 

In the chorus of sympathy that rang the air, the 
scene at the National Congress is most significant. 
When the favourite orator of India said in thundering 
accents : — 

" I declare on my behalf and on behalf of the entire 
Native Press that in our heart of hearts we believe Mr. 
Tilak to be innocent of the charge brought against him. 
The ends of technical justice may have been satisfied 
but substantial justice has grievously failed. 
My sympathy goes forth towards Mr. Tilak in 
his prison home for whom the Nation is in tears — ". 
The whole assembly rose to their feet and expressed. 



THE LOKAMANYA lOI 

its feelings by cheering Mr. Tilak vociferously for seve- 
ral minutes, " It was a unique and unprecedented de- 
-anonstration which ushered the advent of a new force in 
Indian Politics. 

Mr. Tilak was a guest of Her Majesty's gaol at 
Yeravda till 6th September 1898, when he was released, 
nearly six months prior to the termination of the pres- 
cribed period of eighteen months. This belated grace 
was accelerated by the influentially signed petition pre- 
sented by the late Prof. Max Muller to H. M. the Queen 
Victoria. Prof. Max Muller knew Mr. Tilak as the 
author of the ' Orion ' and it was largely due to his 
efforts that the sense of justice of Lord Sandhurst was 
at last awakend. There was still a display of petty- 
mindedness in insisting upon an application for cle- 
mency from Mr. Tilak himself. But Mr. Tilak, who 
had manfully rejected such a humiliating offer before 
-he was convicted, was not the man to yield now. 

Prof. Max Muller's interest in Mr. Tilak enabled the 
latter to spend much of his enforced leisure profitably. 
Mr. Tilak was allowed the use of candles for a couple 
of hours at night and he utilized this opportunity to 
push on his researches into Vedic antiquities. The gaol- 
diet reduced his weight from 135 lbs. to 104. A slight 
improvement in his food again increased it to ii3lbs. 
This diet was also responsible for diabetes which he 
soon contracted and which more or less tormented him 
to the end of his life. He was required to do hard work 
indoors. It is really sad to contemplate the author of 
the " Arctic Home in the Vedas " caning chairs and 
painting walls. To Mr. Tilak, all work was equally in- 
teresting and he is said to have surprised the gaoler by 



102 LOKAMANYA TILAK 

his improvements in the mixing up of several colours^ 
The dull monotony of prison-life would have broken a*, 
less ardent spirit. But like a Yogi, Mr. Tilak had with- 
drawn all thoughts from the living present and had; 
concentrated them on the vicissitudes of the ancient 
Aryans. His happiest moments were those when ob- 
scure Vedic passages yielded their meaning to his 
searching intellect, and when he could correctly inter- 
pret the verse commencing with *Taneedahani hahulafi'* 
yasan in the Rig Veda (VII, 76, 3) he could not sleep 
for joy. Mr. Tilak's prison-life shows that he was pos- 
sessed not only of the qualities of the soldier and the 
scholar but also those of the sage, who has transcended^ 
pleasure and plain, happiness and misery and looks at 
the petty struggles of the world from the sublime 
heights of his controlled mind. 

The sudden and unexpected release of Mr. Tilak sent 
a thrill of joy throughout the country. He came out 
of the gaol a broken man — broken physically, 
never mentall3^ or morally. Old age put its inefface- 
able marks upon his face. His first duty, therefore;., 
was to recoup his health. He spent a few months at. 
his favourite sanitorium, the Sinhgad, hallowed by the 
exploits of Shivaji. Then he attended the Congress- 
(Dec. 1898) at Madras ; thence he went to Ceylon and) 
returned Poona in February 1899. During his tours in 
Ceylon, he pushed on his study of the Buddhistic cul-- 
ture and philisophy, commenced as early as 1890. 

Though the excitement of the Anglo-Indian mind 
had much to do with the troubles of Mr, Tilak, stil! 
when the case was going on, the Advocate-General had 

* Vide P. 8^ {The Arctic Home in the Vedas). 



THE LOKAMANYA I03 

distinctly admitted that the charge against Mr. Tilak 
had nothing to do with the Poona murders. In spite 
of this clear admission, the notorious Globe had the 
effrontery to remark that " Tilak " — mark the omission 
of Mr. — had directed, if not organised, the campaign 
of murder and that the Western Presidency had been 
permeated by seditious conspiracies of a most 
dangerous character with the arch-plotter Tilak as the 
head. The Times of India published these remarks ; 
but when hauled up before the Magistrate for defama- 
tion, made suitable amends by tendering a graceful 
apology which was as gracefully accepted. A suit 
was filed against the Globe in England, and the paper 
which had reviled this Poona Brahmin to eat its own 
words and tender an unreserved apology. 

It was reserved for Sir Valentine Chirol to hold Mr. 
Tilak morally responsible for the Poona murders ; and 
though Mr. Tilak failed in his attempts to legally dis- 
prove the subtle accusation, still all India holds him 
morally innocent of the charge. Directly or indirectly 
morally or actually, Mr. Tilak had nothing to do with 
murders ; and the only murder he ever talked about was 
that of Afzulkhan, in connection with the Shivaji Festi- 
val. Mr. Tilak's life was an open book, on which the 
word * patriotism ' was writ large ; and if the courts of 
justice made the mistake of confounding patriotism 
with sedition — well, he was prepared to pay the price. 
As for murder — political or otherwise — it was absolu- 
tely foreign to his nature.
