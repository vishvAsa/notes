## ON SANNYÂSA AND FAMILY LIFE

Talking of the respective duties of a monk and a householder, Swamiji
said:

A Sannyasin should avoid the food, bedding, etc., which have been
touched or used by householders, in order to *save himself* — not from
hatred towards them — so long as he has not risen to the highest grade,
that is, become a Paramahamsa. A householder should salute him with
"Namo Nārāyanāya", and a Sannyasin should bless the former.

मेरुसर्षपयोर्यद्यत् सूर्यखद्योतयोरिव।  
सरित्सागरयोर्यद्यत् तथा भिक्षुगृहस्थयोः॥

— Like the difference between the biggest mountain and a mustard-seed,
between the sun and a glow-worm, between the ocean and a streamlet, is
the wide gulf between a Sannyasin and a householder.

Swami Vivekananda made everyone utter this and, chanting some Vedanta
stanzas, said, "You should always repeat to yourselves these Shlokas.
'Shravana' not only means hearing from the Guru, but also repetition to
our own selves. 'आवृत्तिरसकृदुपदेशात् — Scriptural truth should be often
repeated for such has been repeatedly enjoined' — In this Sutra of
Vedanta, Vyasa lays stress on repetition."
