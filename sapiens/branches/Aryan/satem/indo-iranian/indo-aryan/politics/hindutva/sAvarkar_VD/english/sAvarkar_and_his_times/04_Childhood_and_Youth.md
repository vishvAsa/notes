In politically fallen, socially degraded and financially ruined
Hindusthan, the eighteen-eighties and nineties witnessed the
darkest period in the history of our country. The first peep
of the dawn in the form of the refonns of 1909 was still to
come. The dawn of 1919 was beyond the horizon. The
spiritual planets like Maharshi Ranade, Swami Dayananda
Saraswati and Swami Vivekananda were kindling light of
social regeneration and spiritual heritage. Dayananda,
Dadabhai, Ranade and Vivekananda were rousing the people
from their slumber ; Ram Singh Kuka and Wasudeo Balwant
had disturbed their thoughts for a good while. Tilak was
carrying discontent and unrest from towns to villages and
cottages. Babu Anand Mohan Bose and Babu Surendranath
Banerjee were infusing a spirit of new life in Bengal. Dreading
the resurgent revolts for the overthrow of its power, the
British mind was deeply engrossed in finding out a safety
valve for the wrath of the Indian revolution. And not long
before, the British top-ranking officers and politicians founded
the Indian National Congress on December 28, 1885, despite
the fears and opposition of Sir Syed Ahmed, who warned the
Muslims to keep aloof from the Congress.

Sprung from the neo-ideology of this institution, which was
fathered by Englishmen and mothered by the Indian
intelligentsia, the Moderates in the following decades placed
mild, just and bare demands of the Indians before their god-
sent and enlightened rulers and pleaded for them with all
the force and prayerfulness of their master-minds. For,
strangely enough, they sincerely believed that the victors
would of themselves bless the vanquished with the much
cherished reforms.

The press was almost mu 2 u:led. The Arms Act was
introduced, not, as it may be imagined, with a view to



2 SAVARKAS AND HIS TIMES

ddiveriHg Indians but to degenerating and emasculating them
further. Bills and budgets were prepared, printed, published
and enforced before they were even known or seen by
Indians. The Ilbert Bill also fomented the growing ill-feeling.
The First Indian Councils Act of 1861 was slightly widened
in 1892. In short, it was a shameful and mournful period.
The alternative was reform or revolution.

Two events typified the new year 1883. Swami Dayananda
Saraswati, a leader of renaissance, was at the end of his
earthly pilgrimage, and Krantiveer Wasudeo Balwant, a man
of great action, laid his bones in Aden longing for the establish-
ment of an Indian Republic. In such a tense atmosphere sin:-
charged with unfulfilled aspirations was bom Swatantrya
Veer Vinayak Damodar Savarkar on Monday, the 28th May
1883, at 10 p.m. at Bhagur, a village near Nasik. The aims
and aspirations of the Swami and ICrantiveer were to be
imified in a great idea, new voice and new nationalism.
Seventy-five days before this birth, Karl Marx, the Prophet
of the Proletariat, passed away unnoticed in a London comer
and sixty-two days after this birth was born Benito Mussolini
who later moulded the destiny of Italy.

Savarkar springs from the illustrious clan of Chitpavan
Brahmins that produced Nanasahib of 1857, Wasudeo Balwant
and Lokamanya Tilak, all of whom strove to snatch the crown
of Independence from the hands of the British. The Savarkars
originally came from the Konkan, a land symbolising the
great feat of reclamation performed by Parshxuram who is a
mighty mythological figure. During the declining days of
the Peshwa rule, the Savarkars were an important family
which had moved in and seen great events. They were
Jahgirdars of a small village, Rahiu'i, and enjoyed the honour
of palanquin for their acknowledged eminence in Sanskrit
scholarship. The blood, bones and brains of such ancestors
carved out this epic figure of Indian Revolution, Vinayak
Savarkar, who, like Mazzini, ushered in the revolutionary war
of liberation in the annals of Hindusthan. And it is to be
noted that, as, with the rise of Mazzini, the Austrian rule
over Italy began to wane, so with the rise of De Valera and
Savarkar the British Empire began to wither and vanish.



CHXLOBOOD AND YOUTH


3


n

A man of position and personality, Vinayak’s father,
Damodarpant Savarkar, was well-built, studious, stem and
self-respecting. In spite of his English education he loved
and remembered his past. He was gifted with poetical talents
and was a good conversationalist. What is more, he was an
admirer of Tilak. Damodarpant’s firm and undemonstrative
temperament did not stand any nonsense from his children.
Vinayak’s mother, Radhabai, was a pious, lovely and bright
lady known for the tenderness of her heart. Of these parents
were born three sons and one daughter. The first was Ganesh,
the second Vinayak, the hero of this biography, the third was
a daughter named Mainabai and the fourth was Narayan.

Damodarpant was a good-natured and religious-minded
man. He recited the epics Mahahharata and Ramayana and
read out to his sons Ballads and Bakhars on Pratap, Shivaji
and the Peshwas. He was a warm admirer of Homer and
had studied and read Pope’s translation of the Iliad to his
sons. It was the practice of Savarkar’s mother to make her
eldest son read chapters from the Mahahharata or the Rama-
yana to her children before they retired to bed. Thus the
Ballads, Bakhars, legends, heroic exploits, historical episodes
and mythological stories powerfully contributed to the mental
development of child Savarkar.

Vinayak, the infant Jahgirdar, was sent to the village
school at the age of six. Soon he showed signs of his remark-
able inborn genius. Much of his inspiration he found in
history and epics. His love of books and newspapers was so
great that he read omnivorously, and any book or newspaper
that he laid his hand upon, he read from cover to cover. His
studies were intense, exciting and prolonged. His depth and
intelligence and the immense interest he took in human affairs
can be judged from one incident. While rea ding the history
of the Arabs, he asked his father about the fiirst pages of their
history. The first pages of the book w«re missing. Naturally
the father repUed that they might have been tom off. What
the boy, in fact, wanted to know was the antecedmts of the
Arabs. The range and loftiness of this idea touched the
infinite Universe. Savarkar depicted this idea in one of his



4 SAVARKAR AND HIS TIMES

latter-day poems and concluded that the first pages of all
history are always unknown ! This is the curse on history,
he added.

Vinayak was hardly ten when well-known newspapers from
Poona accepted his poems, not knowing that the contributions
came from a precocious lad. His insatiable thirst for
knowledge, his excellent memory and the pecuhar charm in
his voice and gait impressed every one and raised high hopes
of his future. Damodarpant saw something new and extra-
ordinary in his son that startled him. He was terribly alarm-
ed when one day he saw his son reading the Upmiishads in
the house ; for, reading the Upanishads in a house, it is said,
forebodes evil for the reader’s worldly life. They are to be
read and studied in the woods !

Witty, bold and handsome, Vinayak was also full of pranks.
He once broke the bangles of his sister, and was shielded by
his elder brother in the safe from the wrath of his father. In
his boyhood he learnt archery and riding. To the horror of
his companions he once caught a serpent with a piece of wire
in his hand.

A man is seen at his best in his childhood. Milton says
that childhood shows the man, as the morning shows the day.
Here is an index to the life-book of Savarkar. In June 1893,
serious riots broke between Hindus and Muslims in the
Azamgarh District of the United Provinces and in August of
the same year in Bombay. The news of the atrocities then
perpetrated on the Hindus in the United Provinces and
Bombay fired his blood and he resolved to avenge the woes
and deaths of his co-religionists. The boy Savarkar led a batch
of selected school-mates in a march upon the village mosque.
The battalion of these boys showered stones upon it, shattered
its windows and tiles and returned victorious. This incident
gives the first hint of the heroic mettle Vinayak was made of
and the key to his future daring life and leadership. The
victory, however, was not allowed to go unchallenged. The
Muslim school-boys gave battle to Vinayak, the Hindu
Generalissimo. Although the number of his soldiers decreased
at the time of joining the battle, Vinayak routed the enemy
with missiles like pins, penknives and thorns with which he
had equipped his army. The battle had its lesson. The boy



CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH 5

leader fell to training and organising his group. For the
military training the group was divided into two detachments
— one Hindu and the other a British or a Muslim — ^to defend
a field or a compound. Always the Hindus won and the
Muslims or the British lost in the mock fights and warfare.

Vinayak completed his Primary Education at the village
school, and moved to Nasik with his elder brother for high-
school education. In the meanwhile, misfortune overtook
the family. Radhabai, Vinayak’s mother, died of cholera,
leaving the children to the care of her husband. At the time
of this fir-st calamity Vinayak was hardly ten. He was
passionately devoted to his mother, and so he felt the loss
terribly. Henceforward his father worked from dawn to dead
of night, personally discharging the household duties and
tending the .small ones affectionately.

In every life there are certain momentous incidents that
decide the fate or change the mode of one’s life. A frustrated
and penniless mutineer from Piedmont asked alms of Mazzini
in the name of the outlaws of Italy. That was the moment of
Mazzini’s conversion and dedication to the struggle for his
country’s Independence. Such an occasion occurred in boy
Savarkar’s life, too. It made an indelible impression on his
mind. Those were the times full of horrid tales. People of
Maharashtra stood between famine and death, plague and
soldiers, the devil and the deep sea, as it were. The harass-
ment caused by the rigid segregation camps during the plague
epidemic, the strict quarantines, the dreadful plague hospitals,
the reckless burning of properties and the outrages on women
reached a climax. The patience of the people was wearing
out. Tilak warned Lord Sandhurst’s Government that they
should not drive the people to desperation.

These countless miseries of the famine and plague-stricken
masses and the excesses committed by the soldiers infuriated
the Chaphekar brothers of Poona, and they shot dead the
Plague Commissioner, Mr. Rand, the bullying incompetent
tyrant and one Mr. Ay erst on June 22, 1897, in Poona, the
traditional cradle of the liberators of Hindusthan. That was
the ‘ auspicious ’ day of the Diamond Jubilee of Queen
Victoria’s rule. The day was to be celebrated despite the
grinding famine and raging plague. And the celebration was



6 SAVARXAR AMD HIS TIMES

perfonned in Poona in such a way that the whole country
became ablaze with the performance which electrified the
Indian people. Once again Poona proved the historical law that
repression, injustice and racial humiliation give rise to violent
reaction that recoils on the head of the aggressor. As a result
of this assassination, though outwardly on a charge of
publishing seditious articles, Tilak was thrown behind the
bars. Betrayed by the Dravid brothers, Damodarpant
Chaphekar was arrested, tried and sentenced to death. He
embraced gallows with the Giia in his hands on April 18 , 1898 .

But in a slave country struggling for freedom such abnormal
times have a knack of feeling the pulse of a nation and of
showing up simpletons and sycophants and separating traitors
from patriots. Amd nine out of ten informants in such a
country rarely go impunished. Consequently one night with
the stroke of the city gun at nine, went out two bullets and
the Dravid brothers of Poona, the informants in the
Chaphekar trial, were shot dead in the street by the junior
Chaphekar, Vasudeo and his friend Ranade, nephew of the
historian Rajwade. This brave youth Chaphekar, liis another
brother, Balkrishna, and Ranade were also hanged in May
1899. The end of the Chaphekar brothers marks a turning
      point in the history of freedom movement of India ; for they
      proved to be the harbingers of the coming revolutionary
      movement in India.

In the meanwhile, Vinayak had an attack of small-pox at
Nasik and he was back to Bhagiur. There the horrible news
about Chaphekars’ heroic end fell upon Vinayak’s ears. It
drove the boy Savarkar to a grim resolve. He approached the
family Deity, Durga, the Ashtapraharana Dharini, in the
sanctuary and invoked the blessings of the Great Mother, the
source of divine inspiration and strength. Sitting at the feet
of the armed Goddess Durga at dead of night, he took a vow
of striving nobly and sacrificing his nearest and dearest, his
life and all, to fulfil the incomplete mission of the martyred
Chaphekars. He vowed to drive out the Britishers from his
beloved Motherland and to make her free and great once
again. It was the glorious vow of Shivaji. Shivaji the Great
took his vow of liberating his country from foreign domina-
tion at the age of sixteen in the temple of Rohideshwar. Tilak



CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH 7

took to political agitation at about five-and-twenty after
finishing his college education. Mazzini entered politics at
the age of seventeen, and De Valera, who was born a year
before Savarkar, at thirty, but Savarkar entered politics and
took the vow of liberating his Motherland when he was hardly
sixteen. So sincere, inspired and spontaneous was the love
for his coiuitry burning in his heart !

To stir up his comrades and people Savarkar composed one
night a ballad over the martyred Chaphekars. His face
glowed. Tears rolled down his cheeks as he pored over his
lines. Hearing the sobs, his father woke up and found his
son sitting far into the night by the lamp. He read the lines
of the ballad and clouds shadowed his face. The father scented
a new danger and tried to dissuade his son from those daring
thoughts of martyrdom at so early an age. He gently patted
Vinayak on his back and advised him to take to some light
songs. The father at once understood what those dripping
lines, their spirit and their flash would mean to their author
and his family.

At Nasik Vinayak’s academic career was not extraordinary.
However, the depth of his knowledge and the fire of his
eloquence had been spread far and wide by his teachers.
While a junior high-school student, his article on ‘ The Glory
of Hindusthan’ appeared in two parts as an editorial in the
local paper, Nasik Vaihhav. With the great flow of his words,
breadth of his knowledge and boldness of his views, he easily
towered above all in the elocution competitions. Astounded
at the range of his knowledge and power of his speech, the
judges at first doubted the originality of his views, but
subsequently were glad to own their mistakes. Vinayak’s
poems of welcome to Maharshi Ranade and Tilak and the
several ballads he composed during these years for the village
chorus also won him reputation.

In 1899 Vinayak’s father and imcle succumbed to plague.
Vinayak’s younger brother Narayan was also attacked by
plague. He was removed first to a dilapidated temple on the
outskirts of Bhagur and then to the NasUc Plague Hospital
where Ganeshpant, alias Babarao, looked after him even at
the risk of his own life. Fear lurked in Vinayak’s mind that
Babarao might also catch the infection. And one day it did



8 SAVARKAR AND HIS TIMES

SO happen. Vinayak was terribly shocked. Boy as he was,
he burst into tears in a comer, but he did not give out a word
of it to Babarao’s young wife. The stuff of his courage was
that of a man who stamps his mind upon history. Death was
on the prowl in Nasik which had become the city of the dead.
In this haunted and deserted city Vinayak passed his days
and nights with heart-throbs fearing to hear bad news about
his brothers who were writhing with deadly pain in the
hospital. At last the danger was over. Both the brothers
recovered and returned, and were once more united in a
happy home.


Ill

Stars shine out at night. Although Vinayak’s mind was
filled with these great anxieties, his vow would not let him
sit alone. He was I'estless. He had a purpose in life and it
was the liberation of his Motherland from the foreign yoke.
He mused on it by day, dreamt about it by night, and he was
waiting for an opportunity to throw himself into his life’.s
mission with all the strength of his mind and muscle.
Shakespeare has described such a poAverful mind in these
beautiful lines :

“ The force of his own merit makes his way,

A gift that heaven gives for him.”

With that end in view Vinayak made friends with Mhaskar
and Page, new friends of Babarao, at Nasik. Simple, hard-
working, credulous, Babarao was as great an obliging man
as he was a propagandist. Babarao’s selfless service won the
goodwill and affection of many persons and families. Among
the new additions were Mhaskar and Page. Sober and
sincere, they were both patriotic workers in the background
as are most men in Government service. In action they were
TUakites and in thought they were drawn to the revolutionary
ideas of Shivrampant Paranjpe. The political views of
Paranjpe were the burning thoughts of the boy Savarkar.
Paranjpe and Savarkar were politically parallel, but socially
poles apart. Both were orators. The elder orator was a
master of satire, the younger w'as a live volcano. While



CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH 9

Paranjpe was the dream of revolution, Savarkar was its
living reality.

After img debates and varied discussions Vinayak won
Paranjpe’s followers over to his side, administered to them
the vow, and formed a Patriots’ Group of three members.
This Group, established in 1899, soon assumed the shape of a
Friends’ Union called ‘ Mitra Mela ’ at the beginning of 1900.
Chosen youths of merit and mettle were secretly initiated into
this fold. This was the famous ‘ Beehive in the words of
Sir Valentine Chirol, of revolutionaries in Western India !
The Mitra Mela sprouted into the world-famous Abhinava
Bharat in 1904, its network was spread over Western and
Central India and subsequently its branches in the form of
the Ghadr Party resounded in England, France, Germany,
America, Hong-Kong, Singapore and Burma with their heroic
deeds and risings like the Komagata Maru episode. The aim
and ideal of the Mitra Mela was absolute political Indepen-
dence of India, and it emphatically asserted that such an
independence could be won, if need be, by an armed revolt.
Its watchward was instruction and insurrection.

The organisation started. By diffusing knowledge, dispel-
ling doubts and ignorance of the members and inspiring them
with the noble aim, its young leader Vinayak Savarkar vita-
lised the gilded youths and the intellectual vagabonds, and
brought the best out of them. He gave them aim, form,
means and ways. Those innocent and reckless youths were
converted into a batch of patriots and a galaxy of martsn-s
who afterwards made history.

The new patriotic and political atmosphere transformed the
city into a living force of a political volcano. The Mitra Mela
dominated all public and political institutions of Nasik,
changed religious fimctions and festivals into political and
national celebrations. These activities of the Mitra Mela gave
sleepless nights to the District authorities. The Mitra Mela
re-sanctified and revitalised the life of Nasik which had grown
stale, insipid and hapless.

Nasik has played a very important role in India’s ancient
and modem history. This southern Kashi stands on the bank
of the Godavari and is the place where Sri Ramchandra
passed his voluntary exile resulting from his eternal devotion



10 SAVARKAR ANO HIS TIMES

to his father. It was from Nasik that Sri Ramchandra started
on his great march to annihilate the tyranny of Ravan. It
was here that Ramchandra and Laxman cut the Nasika —
nose — of the demoness Shiupanakha. Strange to say,
Savarkar started his war of Independence for the liberation
of his people in Nasik, cut off the nose of the British
Imperialism and was later on exiled for his deathless devotion
to his Fatherland, changing Nasik into the new Jerusalem of
Revolutionary India.

During the weekly meetings of the Mitra Mela sometimes
there were hot and lively discussions. On the eve of the
accession of King Edward VII in 1901, a debate was held
to consider whether they should hold a condolence meeting
for the death of Queen Victoria and to declare allegiance to
King Edward or not. Mhaskar and Page were in favour of
declaring allegiance in order to allay the suspicions of the
Government. There was a battle royal. Savarkar asked :
“ King or Queen, the question is whose king is he. England’s
Queen or King is the Queen or King of our enemies. To
declare allegiance to such a King or Queen is not allegiance.
It will be the Bible of slavery ! ” Ultimately it was decided
to oppose both the moves. While Vinayak was at Kothur,
a speaker at one meeting extolled King Edward VTI as ‘ our
father ’. Within an hour of this meeting posters appeared in
the village from novrhere and bitingly queried : “ Then what
relation does your father beeir to your mother ? ”

Vinayak’s charming personality, his voracious reading, his
trenchant views and inspiring thoughts electrified his col-
leagues. They devotedly took to heart the teachings and
preachings of the leader. The precepts were thenceforth no
more abstract ideas. They were an everyday guidance and
moving force in the daily life of Nasik. Vinayak created in
his followers a liking for reading, debating and physical train-
ing to make worthy and noble sacrifices, if need should arise.
He himself took physical exercise — Namaskars — ^till the pers-
piration from his body left his mark on the ground. In later
life, however, he opined that moderate exercise consolidates
and strengthens the body.

Members of the Mitra Mela served the city in many
useful ways. They chastised the tyrannical elements and



CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH 11

brow-beat the bully. Those were the days occasionally smitten
with terrible plague that reduced families to ashes, and razed
houses to the ground. It was a dreadful sight. The cries of
the dying men, women and children, the groans of the afSicted
and the wailings of their relations were too shocking for these
budding youths. There was paucity of men to carry the
corpses to the cremation ground. This band of youths carried
the dead all day long. Vinayak also shared the toilsome task.
One night thoroughly fagged out, young Vinayak fell asleep
in the cemetery unnoticed and was left behind.

Anolher prominent cast of Vinayak Savarkar’s leadership
was that he knew no caste distinctions. To him all Hindus
were equal. Those of his countrymen who were prepared to
sacrifice their lives on the altar of freedom were his comrades.
He shared his food with Maratha families and broke his bread
under their roof. His attractive figure and engaging manners
inspired respect and individual devotion in his circle. He
was popular but by nature reserved and rather shy. He was
amongst them but not of them and so he sometimes retired
secretly to some sequestered corner to hold, as he put it, “ the
Parliament of his mind ” ! His dress consisted of a dhoti, a
coat, a jacket and a cap with a line of embroidery in the
middle.

The heart of Vinayak’s poems and patriotism in those days
was the resurrection and liberation of Hindusthan. In one of
his poems composed at this stage of his life he says : “ O
Aryan brothers, arise.” Elsewhere he says : “ For the uplift
of Aryan Race and Aryan Land, better to keep it in one unit
grand.” At another place he observes : “ Follow the laws of
Nature. Little drops of water make the pond. Organise all
Hindus and unify them.” These lines are the best interpreters
of his thoughts as the words ‘ Arya ’ or ‘ Hindu ’ and ‘ One
Unit ’ are the rallying-points of his ideology.

The influence the Mitra Mela exercised upon the poetry and
politics of Maharashtra was of great magnitude. With a little
hyperbole it may be said that the Mitra Mela was a Univer-
sity. Its songs of freedom and its tales of the lives of the
makers of world history inspired the students with a great
vision, and infused vitality in their bones. Choirs were formed.
They fed and fanned the flames of the passions of the people



12 SAVARKAR AND HIS TIMES

with revolutionary ideas. It was a group of these singers
from Nasik that sang a ballad later on at the historic Fort
Raigad in the presence of Tilak, making the Father of Indian
Unrest quite restless.

Poets, speakers, propagandists, patriots and martyrs were
produced by the Mitra Mela in scores. Out of such lumi-
naries came the poet Govind Trimbak Darekar of Maha-
rashtra. A Maratha by caste, his popular name was Aba.
He was lame. The young poet was richly gifted, but was
unlettered and therefore unacquainted with the rules of com-
position. Savarkar tutored him and Aba Darekar became
Poet Govind, the famous revolutionary poet of Maharashtra.
If Savarkar ’s Ganges and Govind ’s Godavari were taken away
from the sea of Maharashtrian Poetry, what Marathi Poetry
would remain on Patriotism and Martyrdom ?

It is remarkable to note that though mostly engaged in the
propagation of his ideals, Savarkar never had a failure in
his school career. As a rule his colleagues and he were very
particular about their success in examinations. Nor were
they ever a whit behind their class. But to Savarkar life
being an oblation, he, like Tilak, cai'ed more for the service
of his Motherland than for academic distinctions. Yet his
preparations were extraordinary. The prodigy that he was,
his head was a storehouse of world history, an encyclopaedia
of political and social revolutions and revolutionary figures.
Few professors, even at fifty, could rival the sweep, breadth
and depth of his vast knowledge. He had mastered the poets
Ramdas, Moropant and Mukteshwar and proficiently com-
pared and contrasted them in literary circles. One of the
articles entitled, ‘ Who was the Greatest Peshwa ’, written for
a competition carried away the prize. It may be mentioned
here that this was recently prescribed by the Bombay Univer-
sity for the Matriculation Examination. Savarkar has brought
out in this article the brilliance and great leadership of the
Peshwa Madhavrao I. Thus, before entering the Fergusson
College, Poona, young Savarkar was a first rate debater, a
powerful orator, a rising writer and a leader of a revolu-
tionary organisation which was creeping over all villages and
towns in the District.



CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH f3

A few months before Savarkar’s Matriculation Examina-
tion, there occurred an important event in his life. Savarkar
was married to the eldest daughter of Sri Trimbak Ram-
chandra Chiplunkar alias Bhaurao, who knew Savarkar from
childhood. Noble and kind-hearted, Bhaurao was a tall and
attractive figure. He loved riding and hunting. Being a
Karhhari in the Jawahar State lie wielded much influence
in the State. The most important pail the marriage played
in Savarkar’s life was fhat it solved the problem of his
University education which had absorbed the attention of
Babarao Savarkar for the previous five or six months. For
Babarao was to Vinayak, what Baliram was to Krishna or
Chimaji to Bajirao I.

After the premature death of their mother and untimely
death of their father, the burden of the family fell upon
Babarao’s shoulders. He had to struggle valiantly to keep
the wolf from the door and to drive the household chariot
along the right path of revolution. That showed his mettle
and unbounded attachment to his brothers for whom he
sacrificed his personal ambition. To tell the truth, Babarao
would have been a great yogin had he not subordinated his
future to that of his younger brother. Even as a boy, Babarao
believed fervently that his younger brother was born with a
mission for liberating his Motherland, that his uncommon
genius and his great faith would bring about a political revo-
lution in Hindusthan and that he would win back her lost
freedom. This belief revolutionised his whole being. The
family was in straightened circumstances and disturbed con-
ditions owing to a theft committed in their house. Still
Babarao vowed before his ailing and anxious “ Tatya ” that,
come what might, he would send him to the University. On
his part Vinayak passed the Public Service Examination and
was ready to enter Government service, if need arose. But
Sri Bhaurao Chiplunkar promised help, fulfilled the promise
and relieved Babarao of his anxiety. Savarkar’s regard for
his generous father-in-law approached reverence. Years
after, through the airhole of the dark cell in the Andamans,
he sighed his grateful tributes to Bhaurao Chiplunkar in these



14"^ SAVABKAR AND HIS TXMBS

words : " If there be any man or any family next to dear
Baba to whom I owe all that is best in me and owing to whose
noble patronage and winning solicitude I had imusual chances
and facilities of assimilating the noblest things of this world
and even of doing something for our common Motherland,
then that man and that family is theirs (Chiplunkars’) •”
