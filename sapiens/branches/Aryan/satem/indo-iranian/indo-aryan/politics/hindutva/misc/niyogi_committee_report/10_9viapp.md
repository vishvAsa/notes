Nagpur, the 30th April 1954.

Public are aware that by a Madhya Pradesh Government Resolution No.

of a preliminary survey of the problem may be made and with this end in
view request the general public, both Christians and non-Christians,
individuals and institutions and organizations to send to the Committee
such information including any literature that they may have.  This will
enable the Committee to determine the exact points involved, which may
subsequently form the basis of a definite programme for enquiry.

The Committee wish to visit almost immediately certain areas which may

the problem before them.  The Committee will be grateful for suggestions
from the public regarding the areas which the Committee should in the

*PRESS NOTE*

**Missionary Activities Enquiry Committee-Selection of members
explained.**

Nagpur, the 3rd May 1954.

The attention of Government has been drawn to the criticism that his
been expressed in certain quarters against the composition of the
Committee recently appointed to investigate the Missionary activities in
the State.  Especially, the representative character of Shri S. K.
George has been questioned.

Government wish to reiterate-what they have already explained in their
communique announcing the appointment of the Committee-that the purpose
of the Committee is to conduct an impartial enquiry into certain
complaints and counter-complaints regarding the Missionary activities in
the State.  Therefore, in selecting the members of the committee,
Government were anxious to have on it men of unbiased and impartial
outlook, who would function more as judges than as advocates of one side
or the other.  The persons nominated have been chosen on this principle,
and the Chairman of the Committee is a retired Chief Justice of the High
Court and the former Chairman of the Public Service Commission.

As regards Shri S. K. George, he is a devout Christian and a
nationalist, belonging to the oldest Church in India-the Syrian
Christian Church, and has been an educationist and a public worker of
more than twenty years’ standing.  He has pursued theological studies
both in India and at Oxford and was also working in Shantiniketan.  He
has published several books on Christianity.  Commenting on his
appointment, one of the outstanding Christian leaders in the country
described it as a “wise” and “correct” choice.

Government wish to make it quite clear that it is not their intention to
interfere with, or curtail in any way the right of every individual to
practise his religion.  Government trust that all sections of the people
will co-operate with the committee in conducting this important enquiry.
