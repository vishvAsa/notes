## Axiomatic differences
- "Despite English leaving almost 7 decades ago most H remain are unable to think independently of occidental axioms: Hence,they live in a world where many H manifestations remain difficult to understand. They have also never take the time to question if the occidental axioms are the correct 1s to use in a description of their own world: much like **describing a Riemannian world with Euclidean axioms**."


## Occidental imposition
It is an old Euro-american habit to superimpose their fancies on foreign cultures in reaction to their terrible internal problems. For example: 

- secularism motivated by their bloody catholic-protestant conflicts 
- svastika-hatred because of Nazi experience
- "white" Aryanism motivated by racial superiority theories 
- denial of genetic disparity in mental faculties due to guilty-conscience over slaver racism
- insisting that "Egyptians were black. Kemeticism is a black religion." again due to internal racism.
