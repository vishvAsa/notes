title: Vishvaguru!

Vishvaguru attitude is a type of arrogance.

This attitude lurks whenever you hear, these type of statements: "veda-s have everything; there is nothing the mlecCha-s have to offer", "rAmAyaNa period we had flying machine, mahAbhArata time we had cloning and nuclear weapons", "there is no problem with hinduism; it suffices to just follow the shAstra". 

## Occurance elsewhere
That's something shared by late mideval China, and recently by western liberal democrats. Contrast with Japan - she's a student culture - *selectively and carefully* picked and learned from Indians, Chinese, Dutch, Americans - no "know it all" attitude.
