      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;temples&#34;&gt;Temples&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Agamas prescribe that temples should have libraries of important texts. This was observed in practice.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;parakala-yati-in-kanchi&#34;&gt;parakAla-yati in kAnchI&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Postakaṅgaḷum idukku vēṇḍum upakaraṇaṅgaḷum&lt;/strong&gt;—By &lt;em&gt;postakaṅgaḷ&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;em&gt;pustaka&lt;/em&gt;), manuscript bundles are apparently meant. The &lt;em&gt;upakaraṇas&lt;/em&gt; are the accessories and paraphernalia required for running a library—such as probably racks for the accommodation of the manuscript bundles, spare sets of cadjan leaves for copying work, and stylus and other scribal apparatus.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;hellip; Another point of interest in this epigraph is the reference to a &lt;strong&gt;collection of manuscripts&lt;/strong&gt; (or a library) which was kept in the &lt;em&gt;maṭha&lt;/em&gt;. It is well-known that in the medieval centuries, religious institutions of all denominations flourished in South India. They were left in charge of the heads of these &lt;em&gt;maṭhas&lt;/em&gt; called &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Maṭhādhipatis, Mudaliyārs&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Jiyars&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. Then there were also the &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ghaṭikāsthānas&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Despite having smaller adult populations than China, both India and the United States have more individuals donating money to charity. A total of 24.9 crore Indians donated to NGOs, followed by the US at 17.5 crore people and China at 14.8 crore.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;Nearly 18.65 crore people in India support non-profit organizations (popularly known as non-government organizations or NGOs) by volunteering their time and effort. In stark contrast, China, with only 6.8 crore volunteers, was fourth on this list. &amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;british-destruction-of-native-charity&#34;&gt;British destruction of native charity&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Sources: &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.dharmadispatch.in/history/how-the-british-broke-our-charitable-institutions-and-created-a-nation-of-beggars&#34;&gt;Sandeep at DD&lt;/a&gt; . &amp;ldquo;Once the state came into the picture, the commissioners wanted the individuals with their spontaneous charitable impulses to simply get out of the way.

Between 1500-1700, China overtook pushing India to second position. In 1700, again India was the topper. 1750 it was China again. Then the British came. By 1800 India&amp;rsquo;s GDP share was 20%, 1830 17%, 1880 8% and in 1900 1.7%. [&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.economist.com/node/16834943&#34;&gt;Economist link&lt;/a&gt; .]&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;turushka-danda&#34;&gt;turuShka-daNDa&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The very first inscription of Chandradeva, the founder of the Gahadavala dynasty mentions Turushka-Danda. In plain words, it was a special tax levied for the explicit purpose of maintaining additional troops for resisting Turushka inroads. In the annals of Hindu polity, Danda has a twofold meaning: tax and army (the other word for army or military in general, is Bala). Thus, in both senses, the meaning of Turushka-Danda is highly appropriate in this context.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
