Despite having smaller adult populations than China, both India and the United States have more individuals donating money to charity. A total of 24.9 crore Indians donated to NGOs, followed by the US at 17.5 crore people and China at 14.8 crore.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;Nearly 18.65 crore people in India support non-profit organizations (popularly known as non-government organizations or NGOs) by volunteering their time and effort.

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;turushka-danda&#34;&gt;turuShka-daNDa&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The very first inscription of Chandradeva, the founder of the Gahadavala dynasty mentions Turushka-Danda. In plain words, it was a special tax levied for the explicit purpose of maintaining additional troops for resisting Turushka inroads. In the annals of Hindu polity, Danda has a twofold meaning: tax and army (the other word for army or military in general, is Bala). Thus, in both senses, the meaning of Turushka-Danda is highly appropriate in this context.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
