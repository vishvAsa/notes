      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;madhvahistory-on-paper-use&#34;&gt;MadhvaHistory on Paper use&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are reasons for absence of paper usage though the paper was in vogue in South India as early as 13/14th century. This 14th c. MS of Chikitsa Sarasangraha (c.1320) is considered as oldest paper MS of S. India. There are many paper MSs from Jaina &amp;amp; Veerashaiva sects.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In his &amp;ldquo;Elements of South-Indian Pal√¶ography, from the Fourth to the Seventeenth Century A.D.&amp;rdquo; British Palaeographer A.C. Burnell makes this curious observation  i.e. paper &amp;ldquo;is regarded by rigid Hindus as unclean.&amp;rdquo; British linguist &amp;amp; paleographer David Diringer (1900-75) in his &amp;ldquo;Early Writing in India&amp;rdquo; published in 1953 resonates what Burnell said in c.1878. According to him &amp;lsquo;conservative Indian literates&amp;rsquo; considered paper as a &amp;lsquo;Mlechcha product&amp;rsquo; as Muslims owned paper manufacturing.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
