The praise of शूद्रजाति composed by कामदेव (कौण्डिन्यवर्य)

> ईश्वर-वदन-भुजोरु-  
> प्रभवा ब्रह्मादिजातयस् तिस्त्रः।  
> तासाम् आधारार्थं चतुर्थ-  
> जातिश् च तत्-पदाज् जाता॥५॥
>
> अस्या जातेस् ताभ्यो  
> जातिभ्यश् शुद्धिर् इति वचस् सिद्धम्।  
> यद् इयं सहजा जाता  
> भागीरथ्यास् त्रिलोक-पावन्याः॥६॥ [1/5]
>
> तज्-जातीयाः कर्मठास् त्यक्त-शाठ्याश्  
> शुद्ध-स्वांताश् शान्त-रागादि-दोषाः।  
> राजन्यानाम् एत्य साहाय्यम् ऊर्व्व्यास्  
> सर्व्वं भारन् निर्वहंत्य् एव सम्यक्॥७॥
>
> The three castes, (viz.) the Brāhmaṇas and the next (Kshatriyas and Vaiśyas), were produced from the face, the arms and the thighs of the Lord (īśvara) ; and for their support was born the fourth caste from His (i.e., Iśvara's) feet. (5)
>   
> That this caste is more pure than those (other three) is self-evident ; for (verily) this caste was born along with the (river) Bhāgīrathī, (i.e., the Ganges [which springs from Vishṇu's foot]), the purifier of the three worlds. (6)
> 
> The members of this caste are eagerly attentive to their duties, not wicked, pure-minded, and are devoid of passion and other such blemishes ; (they) ably bear all the burden of (protecting) the earth by helping those born in the kingly caste. (7)
