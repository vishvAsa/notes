Another real story happened few decades back. You probably are aware of anti-v1 rhetoric from Tamil lands. In an event organized by usual suspects and the speaker was spewing bike, going on and on about how access to 'vedam' was blocked by v1s. A v1 from the audience stood up and said he'll administer upanayanam and teach "vedam" to anyone interested as long as they have the right "anushthana". He start the same week and the classes would begin at 4 AM - the brahma muhurta. Of course no takers. This rhetoric is just a dog whistle.
