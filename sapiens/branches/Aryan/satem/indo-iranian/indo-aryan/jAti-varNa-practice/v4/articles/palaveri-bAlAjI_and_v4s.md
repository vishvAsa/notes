palaveri village in pallava-desha near kAnchIpuram hosted an agrahAra, where rAjagopAla, a reknowned shrIvaiShNava scholar resided. His son, popularly known as bAlAjI, also a scholar, was raised there till late 90s. These are some recollections pertaining to shUdra-s (abbreviated as v4s).

## Respect for v1s
On auspicious occassions like marriage, v4s used to provide grains and such the previous day to my father, and ask him to feast on them the next day, and come and bless during the event.

When shUdra-s entered the agrahAra, on their own accord, they used to remove their footwear.

Once I was travelling to kAnchi from bengaLUru on a sleeper bus. A co-passenger turned to me and realized by seeing my tilaka that I was a brAhmaNa. He asked another person to exchange spots saying : "A brAhmaNa is sleeping here; and I have just consumed meat. Please exchange". Similarly, panchama-s used to, on their own accord, seat themselves elsewhere, rather than next to me.

## Piety
The farmers would be entirely free of agricultural labors for much of the year. Then, they used to perform and enjoy plays based on rAmAyaNa and mahAbhArata all night long. They used to be shy of performing before my respected father, so he used to watch from far away.

A shUdra would scold my father thus: "I used to watch your father with his thick tirumaN tilaka. Now you sit in the same place with your thin tilaka. Fie!"

The farmers would work in the fields all morning; and their wives would bring food. They would offer this food to an idol made of cowdung, and to the sun, before eating.

Farmers used to operate a picotah/ eta to draw water for irrigation. To reduce the effort they felt, they used to say viShNu-stotra-s.
