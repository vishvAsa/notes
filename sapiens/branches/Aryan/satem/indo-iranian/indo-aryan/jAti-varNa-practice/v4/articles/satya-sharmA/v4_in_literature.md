## Pādatāḍitaka
A Śūdra character named Viṣṇunāga in Śyāmilaka's Pādatāḍitaka (~5th century CE) says :

> "I am Ārya, of pure conduct, of good lineage.   
I have studied Śabda (Vyākaraṇa) & Hetusamaya (Nyāya).   
I am an officer of the King.." 

Context: His heart is broken by a Veśyā. He comes to Brāhmaṇas expert in Vedas to ask for a prāyaścitta.

> आर्योऽस्मि शुद्धचरितोऽस्मि कुलोद्गतोऽस्मि,  
शब्दे च हेतुसमये च कृतश्रमोऽस्मि।  
राज्ञोऽस्मि शासनकरो न पृथग्जनोऽस्मि,  
त्रायध्वमार्तमगतिं शरणागतोऽस्मि॥

As per the translation of Motichandra and V. S. Agrawal, it seems that in around the 5th century CE Ujjayinī, Śvapacas/Cāṇḍālas were appointed as persons who would bring a person into the court or call the Vādī and Prativādī.

## Mṛcchakaṭikam

"Ośaladha ajjā ośaladha!"

Taking the idea from the last chapter of Dr. B. R. Ambedkar's book 'The Untouchables', I checked the depiction of Cāṇḍālas in Mṛcchakaṭikam. They're taking Cārudatta for execution & people don't give them way. 

So many times they have to tell them to give them way, saying "ośaladha! ośaladha!" (move away! move away!). This shows that people didn't shy away from walking towards or close to a Cāṇḍāla then. It is further interesting to note that after the truth comes out they leave to meet the king sitting in the 'jaṇṇavāḍa' (yajñavāṭa) or the place where yajña is performed. Although it is not shown what happens when they go there, but it is clear that they don't think that it'd be difficult to meet the king there and immediately leave.

Dr. Ambedkar in the said chapter is of the opinion that untouchability in the case of, say Cāṇḍālas, arose during the Brahminical rule of Gupta dynasty, which implies that the kings who followed 'Brahminism' did that. The mention of jaṇṇavāḍa & that of Dr. Ambedkar in the said chapter is of the opinion that untouchability in the case of, say Cāṇḍālas, arose during the Brahminical rule of Gupta dynasty, which implies that the kings who followed 'Brahminism' did that. The mention of jaṇṇavāḍa & that of the king Śūdraka, the 'dvijottama', as a master of Ṛgveda, Sāmaveda etc., in the beginning of play, suggests that the faith practised by the then royalty may be somewhat 'Brahminical'.

## bhAgavatam
Did 'Brahmahatyā' have a wider meaning?

Śrī Romaharṣaṇa is considered a Pratilomaja Sūta as per Bhāgavata Purāṇa. But killing him (while he was seated on Brahmāsana), Śrī Balarāma was told to perform the prāyaścitta of Brahmahatyā (killing of a Brāhmaṇa). It seems that Brahmahatyā may've had a wider meaning.
