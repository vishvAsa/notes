title = "Wavell on Ambedkar 39"

7 October 1939

He (Ambedkar) and I had seen something of one another in 1934-35: but he had had time to think since then, and the general conclusion which he had in the result reached was that the parliamentary system would not do in India.

I asked him whether he would say that in public, to which he replied that he would be perfectly ready to do so, whith the utmost emphasis.

He was 100 per cent opposed to self-government at the Centre and would resist it in any possible way.

As to the self-government at the Centre he favoured a consultative group but he was strongly opposed to an All Parties meeting on the ground that there would be no hope whatever of our being able to do business at one, owing to the dissensions that would arise.

He was equally opposed to an expanded Executive Council, which he thought would never work together and he begged that no responsibility should be given at the Centre, but that whatever organizations we might device should be consultative in character only.
