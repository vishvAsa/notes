The vaishya from lATa was excited at the successful sighting under clear skies. That afternoon we decided to catch some sleep to make up for the marathon astronomy session. It was the second great revival of astronomy for us and we were looking forward for another great session with vaishya shreShTha spanning the whole night.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The path of the yakShini</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&#34;https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2005/07/25/the-path-of-the-yakshini/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We flew up again with the yakShini. There we stood in the mid-welkin and&#xA;bewitching yakShini whispered in my ear:&lt;br&gt;&#xA;“We need to talk about about a profound question”.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Me: What is it?&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Y: Of all those sexually reproducing beings out there, the majority of&#xA;them are heterogamous There are some like Chlamydomonas that produce&#xA;similar-looking gametes- the male and female gametes are the same. But&#xA;the majority of cases have converged on clear anisogamy or heterogamy.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Me: That is indeed so. Why so ?&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Y: Some have claimed that it is due to disruptive selection: The&#xA;selection favors bigger gametes on one end of the spectrum because they&#xA;can deliver more resource to the zygote and there by improve its&#xA;survival (and there by their own fitness). Thus you get the egg. On the&#xA;other end the more gametes you produce the more chance of propagating&#xA;your genes. So your produce many little gametes- the sperm. Naturally&#xA;you have a disruptive selection that favors both extremes and nothing in&#xA;between because they will be less efficient in their chosen tasks. Thus,&#xA;we get anisogamy.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Y: But now tell me the problem with this reasoning.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Me: Since most organisms start of isogamous the first guy who reduces&#xA;his gamete size in the quest for making more gametes will deliver less&#xA;resource to the zygote than an isogamous member. So reduction will be&#xA;disfavored. This will kill the very emergence of anisogamy. So anisogamy&#xA;will take place only if some way simultaneous you have guys going small&#xA;and other correspondingly going big.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Y: See these centric diatoms- they are oogamous- anisogamous to the&#xA;extreme. How do you think this evolved.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The two paths of the yakShiNi</title>

There we entered The&#xA;House and called up the yakShiNi again. She came forth even as agni had&#xA;shot up when praised by the hymns of the long gone fathers, bhR^igu,&#xA;ushana kAvya, apanavAna and aurva. She created that shield that kept of&#xA;the kR^ityA from coming through. The she said that we shall take the&#xA;flight along two paths. I asked if we may travel along the path where no&#xA;mortal has coursed before. She said: Sure you will but that path is&#xA;taken only at the biding of vaivasvata. Then I asked that we course&#xA;along the backward path. She acquiesed and arose. But the kR^ityA seized&#xA;us and spread fear in our limbs. It looked as though we were&#xA;simultaneously hit by the bhramaNa, bhaya~nkara and stambhana prayogas&#xA;borne by the kR^ityA. We dived within the kavacha of the yakShiNi.&#xA;Suddenly we found ourselves above the kShetra shown in the picture. This&#xA;was a kShetra where we have spent a relatively enormous amount of time&#xA;from our first memories.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&#34;https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2005/07/04/shomsavo/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;oM ShoM / shomsAvo/ shomshomsAvo / othAmo daiva / AthAmo daiva / othAmo&#xA;daiva made / modAmo daivatho /&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There arose a yakShI from the fervid flames, whom we shall call OPJ.&#xA;This yakShI had all the guNas we had concieved in the sujAtA-rUpa. We&#xA;passed the torturous Dismal Hollows Road and a little shmashAna lay&#xA;beyond it. There from the hollow of an old kapala in which the offering&#xA;was being made beyond the midnight hour the remarkable yakShI arose. To&#xA;all beholders she was as though flesh and blood. She could assume any of&#xA;three forms: 1) like a haggish witch-like kR^itya which still drew&#xA;people towards them. 2) A mahAmohinI of young and captivating looks and&#xA;3) a fair lass with immense flowing locks. The yakShI was manifest only&#xA;after midnight. The yakShI was difficult to handle and burnt the body&#xA;intensely suggesting that more work was required to get her under&#xA;control. We watched her go into the peculiar house at middle of the&#xA;Dismal Hollows Road and signal to us with a remarkable flash of light.&#xA;The feelings of which were just beyond description despite the burning&#xA;she was causing to every one.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
