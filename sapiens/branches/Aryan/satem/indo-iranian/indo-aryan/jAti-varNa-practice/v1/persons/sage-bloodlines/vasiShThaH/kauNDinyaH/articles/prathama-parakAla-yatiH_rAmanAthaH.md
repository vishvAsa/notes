As regards Brahma-tantra-svatantra-Jiyar, the donee of the record, some information is available from Vaishṇava literature. Among the South Indian religions, it was Vaishṇavism alone that had developed the ‘historical sense’ to an appreciable extent, and there are therefore several biographies of the Vaishṇava *āchāryas* available, collated under the names of *Vaibhavas* and *Guruparamparās* of varying volume.[^321_6] One such work dealing with the life of the great Vaishṇava reformer **Vēdānta-Dēśika** is the *Guruparamparā-prabhāvam*[^321_7] in Tamil prose by Tritīya-Brahma-tantra-svatantra-Jiyar.

[^321_1]: *Guruparamparā-prabhāvam* (Tamil, Madras,), p. 114; see also f. n. 3 on p. 319.
[^321_2]: *Ibid.*, p. 138.
[^321_3]: There were 74 *siṁhāsanādhipatis* who were selected. Their names are given in the reply to question No. 24 of the *Trimśatpraśnōttaram, Palaṇadai-viḷakkam*, p. 30.
[^321_4]: The following expression from No. 51 of 1938-39 from Śrīraṅgam may be compared—*Kodavar kōvaṇavar nam bhaṭṭakaḷ . . . nam Rāmānujaṇ-uḍaiyār nam pādūvār*, etc.
[^321_5]: Compare No. 567 of 1919 of the Madras Epigraphical collection.
[^321_6]: There are many biographies of Dēśika available. The *Vēdānta-Dēśika-vaibhava-prakāśikā* by Doḍḍayāchārya is in Sanskrit.
[^321_7]: Published in Madras in several editions. **Dvitīya-Brahma-tantra-svatantra-Jiyar**, the *āchārya* of the author of this work is said to have written the *Pannirāyirappaḍi-Guruparamparā-prabhāvam*, which is not extant.

From it we gather the following details about Brahma-tantra-svatantra-Jiyar, the first of that name, who was a disciple of Vēdānta-Dēśika :

**Brahma-tantra-svatantra-Jiyar** belonged to the Kauṇḍinya-gōtra and was originally called **Vīravalli Pēraruḷāḷayyaṇ**. Well-versed in all the *śāstras*, he became an ardent disciple of Dēśika and assumed the *saṁnyāsa* garb under the name of **Pēraruḷāḷa-Jiyar**. 

When the Raṅganātha temple at Śrīraṅgam was looted by the Muhammadans in the first quarter of the 14th century, Brahma-tantra-svatantra-Jiyar fled along with his *āchārya* to Satyamangalam (in the Coimbatore District) and returned to Śrīraṅgam only after some years. 

He was taught the *Bhagavad-vishayam* (*Ārāyirappaḍi*) by Varadāchārya alias **Nayiṇārāchārya**, the son and disciple of Vēdānta-Dēśika, in **Kali 4440, Bahudhānya, Āvaṇi, śu. 2, Hasta (=A.D. 1338, August 18)**. 

On one occasion, he vanquished a pandit of North India in a polemical contest at Śrīraṅgam and was honoured by Dēśika with the title of ‘**Brahma-tantra-svatantra**’[^322_1] ‘he who is a master in Brahma-tantra’. That accounts for the origin of the name by which he was popularly known. 

On another occasion during the régime of **Tirumalai-Śrīnivāsāchārya**[^322_2] who had been installed by Dēśika as the *Śrīkārya-dhurandhara* of the Kāñchīpuram temple, Brahma-tantra-svatantra-Jiyar overcame a Kashmīrian Pandit in a philosophical discussion and earned the title of ‘**Paryāya-Bhāshyakāra**’.[^322_3] 

Some time later under the direction of god Veṅkaṭēśa in a dream, he accepted the **Trusteeship of the Tirupati temple**. He stayed at Tirupati for a long time expounding the Vaishṇava philosophy to his disciples.
