There are many lines of Atrīs, all of them trace their descent from Atri & Arcanānas. Some take different sons or descendants of Arcananas such as Vadbhutaka, Gavișțhira, Pūrvātithi, etc or even replace Arcananas with one of the above sons/descendants & add yet later Rșis, to make themselves further distinct & distinguished.

Some even take one of these sons/descendants of Arcananas, Putrika, and trace their ancestry through the patriline produced by the daughter of a later day Rși from this Putrika as he appointed his daughter’s son to continue his legacy, together with his actual patrilineal gotra.

But those who trace themselves to Atri & Arcananas via the famous Syāvaśva (who got the Maruts to help him woo & obtain a Dārbhya/Kevalāńgīrasa girl as wife) are to be known **only** or **simply** as Atrīs. Hence, Kevalātreyas.
