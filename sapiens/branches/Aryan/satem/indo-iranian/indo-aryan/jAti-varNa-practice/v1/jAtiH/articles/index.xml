      <description>&lt;p&gt;Bhumihars of Bihar and U.P. did not participate in the common front of Brahmins and Rajputs in 1857. Maharajas of Benaras, Hathua and Bettiah rendered signal service to the British during 1857. On the other hand the Britishers believed that 1857 was the mechinations of Brahmins and Rajputs in Bihar and U.P. Maharani Victoria&amp;rsquo;s declaration on Ist November, 1858, obliquely accepted the Caste hierarchy of Hindu Society. The result was the acceptance of Brahmin superiority and Kunwar Singh&amp;rsquo;s Rajput caste as second in caste category. A furore was created in the minds of Bhumihars, as they were placed third in the ad-hoc census of 1865 in U.P. and Bihar. The Regular Census began in 1881. The Bhumihars were greatly shocked and felt humiliated, finding themselves in the third position in the Regular Census.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The Cathiar were Brahmin war bands found throughout Kerala and Tamil Nadu as well as the rest of Southern India, where they were referred to as ghatam/kalam.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Cathiar would take up arms for their respective kings. However upon defeat of their liege lord, they could be incorporated into the new kingdom. At times, they entered into political disputes, choosing the kings of the Cheras and Pallavas, or even founded kingdoms in the case of the Kadambas. To join the Cathiar, one had to be proficient in the Vedas and had to be certified by 5 current members that the candidate was proficient in Vaiyakarna, Mimamsa and Purohita.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

This likely stems from the seamless integration of Indian religions, culture and society into Thai life since ancient times. The propagation of Buddhism and Hinduism was primarily led by monks and priests who built monasteries and temples to promote their faiths. In early modern times, Hindu priests became known as Siamese Brahmins, an esteemed group headed by the Rajaguru, appointed by the monarch. They have played a pivotal role in shaping the countryâ€™s spiritual and cultural landscape since the Sukhothai period (13thâ€“14th centuries ce) or earlier. Descendants of ancient lineages, these brahmins conduct royal ceremonies, preserve traditional rituals and provide spiritual guidance to the Thai monarchy.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Coming from Kanyakubja is a frequent claim among Brahmins living in distant areas from the Ganges heartland. Short thread on some instances of migration of Kanyakubja Brahmins. ðŸ§µ&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The 4th century Nandisutra written in Nagari script found in Gujarat tells about Grants of Ancient Copper-plates to Brahmins who came to Gujarat from Kanyakubja. Interestingly there are Anavil Brahmins of Gujarat who claim to be descended from Kanyakubjas.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The most famous Instance of Kanyakubjas Migrating comes from Bengal when King Adisura who was troubled by the lack of Vedic prowess among Brahmins already residing there, invited 5 Brahmins from Kannauj for restoring the Brahminical order in Bengal.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.namboothiri.com/articles/faq/&#34;&gt;TW&lt;/a&gt;&#xA;Source: &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.namboothiri.com/articles/faq/faq3.htm&#34;&gt;TW&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Q-2. What is the origin of the name Embranthiri? Does it exclusively apply to Brahmins from South Kanara settled in Kerala? (Nikhil Rao, Software Engineer, USA)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Ans: In the 8th century AD, as per the request from King Udayavarma Raja of Kolathunaad (a small ancient kingdom in north Kerala), King Mayooravarman of Gokarnam sent 237 Tulu Brahmanan families to Kolathunaad. These family members performed &amp;ldquo;Hiranyagarbha&amp;rdquo; and converted themselves to Malayalam Brahmanans. They had settled in Arathil, Cheruthaazham, Pilathara and Chirakkal. All these places are in and around one of the strongest Namboothiri Graamams (villages) of those days, Perinchelloor (near today&amp;rsquo;s Taliparamba in Kannur district in north Kerala).&lt;/p&gt;</description>
