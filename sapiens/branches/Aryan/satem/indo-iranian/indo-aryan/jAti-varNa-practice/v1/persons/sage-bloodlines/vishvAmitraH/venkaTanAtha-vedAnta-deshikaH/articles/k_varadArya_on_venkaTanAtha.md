**The Desika Incarnation of Sri Ramanuja**

(By Srimad Ubhaya Vedantacharya Kothimangalam Varadacharya Mahadesikan, Mysore)

**Foreword:** Before the incarnation of Sri Bhagavad Ramanuja, the propagation of Buddhism was dominant throughout India, along with Jainism. As a result, our Vedic religion had fallen. At that time, Sri Shankara, by stating what the Buddhists said and asserting that the same meaning exists in the Vedas, attempted to first save the Vedas, and he succeeded in this endeavor. However, the true meaning of the Vedas was not obtained. It was Buddhism that was established under the guise of the Vedas. It was then that Sri Ramanuja incarnated and explained the true meaning of the Vedas.

Later, after Sri Ramanuja, Buddhism and Advaita once again joined hands and attempted to crush the Vedic religion. Sri Harsha initiated this with great fanfare. Furthermore, concepts like Saranagati (surrender), Samashrayanam (initiation), Achara (conduct), and Anushtana (practices) were all targeted by a barrage of questions and faced the danger of disappearing. It was then that Sri Ramanuja took another incarnation to save them. That is the Desika incarnation.

This is the article that explains it.

**Sri Nathamuni and Yamunamuni**

History tells us that Sri Yamunamuni, also known as Alavandar, the grandson of Sri Nathamuni who preceded Sri Ramanuja, had intended to write a 'Bhashya' (commentary) on the Brahma Sutras himself. However, upon realizing the divine will (Bhagavat Sankalpa) that this task must be accomplished through the forthcoming Ramanuja, he left the responsibility of fulfilling this great work to Sri Ramanuja. As Sri Desika also stated, "Nathopajnam; Yamuneyaprabandhaih.... Yatindraih," it is noteworthy that all three sages—Nathamuni, Alavandar, and Sri Ramanuja—share the credit for establishing this philosophy (Siddhanta). However, the primary reason this philosophy became famous in the world under Ramanuja's name is the divine will. According to it, the Guru Parampara (lineage of teachers) states that Thirukoshtiyur Nambi named it 'Ramanuja Darshanam'. The root cause for all this was the will of Sri Hayagriva, who had Ramanuja write the commentary on the Brahma Sutras and blessed him with his own form (murti) through the goddess Saraswati. Hayagriva is the embodiment of supreme knowledge (Vijnana Murti). This signifies that the knowledge of the self (Atma Vijnana) was revealed through Ramanuja to an extent unmatched by anyone else. Knowledge becomes supreme knowledge (Vijnana) when it is complete.

**Sri Desika and Sri Ramanuja**

Just as the Kathopanishad says, "The Lord is easy to see for those whom he chooses," our Desika was another Acharya whom Hayagriva sought out on his own. The mantra that Sri Desika's Acharya taught him was the Garuda Mantra. However, Garuda (Periya Thiruvadi) himself appeared before Desika, taught him the Hayagriva Mantra, and instructed him to chant it. It is no ordinary matter for one deity to teach the mantra of another. When mantras taught by human Acharyas can accomplish wondrous feats, one need not be told how powerful a mantra taught by a deity would be. In short, Lord Hayagriva did not shine through anyone else as he did through Sri Desika. Thus, the fact that Hayagriva, who had sought out Sri Ramanuja, reappeared and fully manifested in Sri Desika out of necessity confirms the relationship between Sri Ramanuja and Sri Desika.

**Hayagriva and Desika**

What is the reason for Sri Lakshmi Hayagriva to voluntarily choose and reach Sri Desika? To understand this, we must examine about 1600 years of our country's history. About 1500 years ago, that is, from the fifth century A.D., a great opposition to our Sanatana Dharma began to arise from Buddhist scholars. Many great souls who lived from Kumarila Bhatta, who appeared around the seventh century A.D., to Udayanacharya, who appeared in the tenth century A.D., struggled immensely to defeat the Buddhists in many ways and re-establish our Sanatana Vedic Dharma. Adi Shankara also belongs to this lineage. The tenth-century Buddhist text 'Tattva Sangraha' is evidence that despite the various efforts of these great men, external religions like Buddhism and Jainism were not completely eradicated until the 10th century. It is noteworthy that no work from followers of external religions was published after the time of Ramanuja. Therefore, it is clear that the establishment of the Vedic religion was perfected by Sri Ramanuja.

**Buddhists and Crypto-Buddhists (Prachanna Bauddhas)**

Thus, even though the era of overt Buddhists ended and our Vedic religion flourished completely during Sri Ramanuja's time, it was as if waiting for Sri Ramanuja to attain his heavenly abode (Parama Padam) that the menace of Buddhism began to sprout again. Furthermore, these individuals became crypto-Buddhists (Maricha Bauddhas), causing more harm to our dharma than the Buddhists who existed before Sri Ramanuja. An internal enemy is more harmful to a nation than an external one. Similarly, those who have studied history will know that Buddhists began to appear in the guise of Vaidikas (followers of the Vedas).

When Buddhism was suppressed by great men like Kumarila Bhatta, many scholars, realizing the greatness of our religion and having been defeated in debates, reconverted to the Vedic faith. However, is it not natural for old impressions (vasana) to persist even after they change? Therefore, the scent of old Buddhism can be clearly detected in the works of many Vedantins who preceded Ramanuja.

**Advaita and Bhaskara**

This truth can be seen revealed in the book 'Bhaskara Bhashya', written by a Vedantin named 'Bhaskara' who appeared before Sri Ramanuja. He called the Advaita Vedantins of his time 'Buddhists in the guise of Vaidikas'. Sri Desika also taunts them in his Satadushani, asking, "Why do you, who are a Buddhist in waiting, wear the cloak of a Vaidika?" Thus, due to these Buddhists who infiltrated our religion like parasitic plants, and due to Vedantins who, despite genuinely converting, had not shed their old Buddhist impressions, a more terrible danger arose for our religion than in earlier times.

**Sanatana Dharma and Buddhism**

The foundational issue that caused the conflict between Sanatana Dharma (Vedic Dharma) and Buddhist Dharma is the 'Ishvara Vada' (the doctrine of God). Vedic Dharma holds that this world originates from Ishvara, is sustained in Him, and merges into Him. The primary objective of Buddhism is to oppose the principle of Ishvara. One might ask, "Did not the Mimamsa school, known as a Vedic Darshana, also not accept Ishvara?" The truth is that it did not oppose Ishvara; it simply did not speak about Him. This can be explained at another time. It seems the Buddhists thought that their first duty was to oppose the doctrine of Ishvara, knowing that if it stands, all other principles of the Vedic tradition will automatically follow.

**Buddhism and Middle-Period Advaita**

Middle-period Advaita establishes the same thing under a different name. There is no such real entity as Ishvara. There is no creation or destruction (srishti, layam) for the world. Everything is false. How can a false world be created and protected? This is the essence of middle-period Advaita. Buddhism also emphasizes this. That is why the Vedantin Bhaskara called them Buddhists. Our Sanatana Dharma must thrive by embracing the principle of Ishvara. Only by properly understanding our relationship with Him, showing devotion (bhakti), and joyfully praising, worshipping, and celebrating Him can the soul (Jiva) attain salvation. There is no place for any of this in Buddhism or middle-period Advaita. What greater calamity could befall our dharma than this?

**Sri Ramanuja and His Darshana (Philosophy)**

It was in such a dire situation that Sri Ramanuja, accepting the Lord's holy command, established in the world the greatness of Bhakti and the Lord's infinite auspicious qualities, infinite forms, and glories through his own experience and practice. As he lived for about 120 years, his principles became well-established in the world, and the doctrine that 'the world is false' and the doctrine of atheism (nirishvara vada) were uprooted.

**Sri Harsha and Advaita**

However, in the 12th century A.D., a fierce scholar named Sri Harsha, in his polemical work 'Khandanakhandakhadya', attempted to demolish the principle of Ishvara and the theistic doctrines based on it, while being a Buddhist in Vedic guise. In this work, one can also see that Sri Harsha equates the Advaitins of his time with the Buddhists. This clearly shows that he attempted to spread Buddhism under the veneer of Vedic religion, like serving old wine in a new bottle. Had our Desika not appeared and eradicated them, all the hardships endured by Kumarila, Adi Shankara, and others would have been in vain.

**Vidyaranya and Sri Desika**

The truth that Vidyaranya, an Advaitin and contemporary of Sri Desika, has stated in his work 'Sankara Vijayam' that Sri Harsha was a heretic (puramatattavan) and his work an unacceptable external text (puranool), can be seen. When we see modern Advaitins, in contrast, treating Sri Harsha and his work as their own, it becomes clear that Sri Desika was the main reason for Vidyaranya making such a statement at that time. Vidyaranya, who witnessed firsthand Sri Desika establishing the true form of Sri Harsha as an atheist in Vedic guise, was justified in abandoning him and his work.

**Sri Harsha and Desika**

Sri Harsha has clearly stated in his book that the reason for his scholarship was a mantra belonging to the Buddhist Tantra called 'Chintamani'. It seems that as a result of the power of this mantra-siddhi, no one at that time could oppose him directly. It was to prevent our dharma from being diminished by the followers of such a great scholar that Sri Hayagriva himself manifested through our Desika. A question might arise as to why Sri Harsha was not suppressed directly. It is natural for a deity to grant a boon in some form to one who has attained mastery over a mantra (mantra-siddhi). Therefore, defeating such a person indirectly rather than directly is a subtlety to be observed in all divine actions.

**Sri Desika's Yatiraja Saptati**

To subdue the rampaging crowd that, in the arrogance of their mantra-siddhi, was destroying Sanatana Dharma as an internal enemy, with no one daring to challenge them, it was necessary for someone to rise up fiercely, according to the proverb 'one must answer devils in their own language'. Therefore, Sri Desika, taking the Lord's command upon his head, composed a shloka starting with "Yatīśvarasarasvatī surabhitāśayānāṁ satāṁ...". He roared, "I bear on my head the holy feet of the good men whose minds are fragrant with the works of Sri Ramanuja; I place my left foot on the heads of the followers of other religions." The first part of this shloka refers to those who accept our Veda, the Ishvara within it, His form, qualities, etc. The latter part refers to the atheists who are opposed to this.

**Sri Desika and Sahadeva**

It is noteworthy that in the Mahabharata, during the Rajasuya Yaga, Sahadeva spoke similarly regarding Shishupala, who objected to giving the first ceremonial offering (tāmbūlam) to Sri Krishna. The Mahabharata says that when Sahadeva declared, "I place my foot on the head of anyone who objects to the worship of Sri Krishna," a shower of flowers rained down from the heavens. Those who have studied the texts and histories of that time will well understand that this shloka came from Sri Desika's holy mouth under the same circumstances as Sahadeva's aforementioned shlokas.

**Sri Adi Shankara and Sri Desika**

Even Adi Shankara, who praised the Lord's auspicious qualities and forms through various hymns, would have been filled with joy upon hearing this shloka of Sri Desika and would certainly not have been angered. This is because impartial scholars accept that the philosophy (Siddhanta) of Adi Shankara and the philosophy of later Advaitins are different. The discerning world is closely watching as this view is being expressed more strongly day by day. Sri Desika also proclaimed this shloka with such middle-period Buddhists in Vedic guise in mind.

Thus, Desika Darshanam, Vaidika Darshanam, Sanatana Darshanam, and Ramanuja Darshanam are all synonymous. There is no obstacle for the Darshana of Nathamuni and Yamunamuni to become Ramanuja Darshanam and then Desika Darshanam. Moreover, just as it was appropriate for this philosophy to be named Ramanuja Darshanam because the task willed by Sri Hayagriva was fulfilled through Sri Ramanuja, it is also highly fitting to call Ramanuja Darshanam as Desika Darshanam, as Sri Hayagriva's will was firmly established by Sri Desika.

If Sri Ramanuja had not incarnated as Desika and destroyed these wolves in sheep's clothing, would the Vedic Dharma have been available even to the extent we see it today? Without a doubt, it would not have been.

Therefore, understand with impartiality that the Vaidika Darshanam is the Ramanuja Desika Darshanam.
