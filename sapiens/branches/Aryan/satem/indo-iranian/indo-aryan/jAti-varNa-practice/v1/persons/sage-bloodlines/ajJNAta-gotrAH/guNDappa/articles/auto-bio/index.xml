      <description>&lt;p&gt;[[Baṇḍi Rasūl Khān&#x9;Source: &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.prekshaa.in/bandi-rasul-khan&#34;&gt;prekshaa&lt;/a&gt;]]&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I have passed two examinations in my life. One is the &lt;em&gt;Lower Secondary&lt;/em&gt;&#xA;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; in Kannada. That was probably in 1898–99. At that time, there was no English [medium] school in our town. The second examination I cleared was the &lt;em&gt;Lower Secondary&lt;/em&gt; in English, which was was probably in 1900. That is altogether a different story.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;After finishing the English &lt;em&gt;Lower Secondary&lt;/em&gt;, came the plan for further studies. No one in our house was particularly enthusiastic about that. My grandmother was totally opposed to sending me out of town for studies. “The child in front of my eyes should remain in front of my eyes, as long as I am alive” – was her obstinate stance. My grandfather had died recently. Hence we would experience financial shortfall in running the family. In those days, sending money to another town was a difficult task. Food grains were delivered home. So even if there were ten guests for dinner, we could serve them without any worries. Money was a different matter. Therefore my great uncles were hesitant.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

This was during the time of Garret, Leonard, Rice, and other British officers. As this continued for ten to fifteen years a promotion to four rupees was given; and persons who labored for more than twenty years received five rupees. There was a constant recommendation from the officers of the department that this was insufficient and had to be increased. The government used to respond as insufficient funds. During the tenure of Bhabha &lt;em&gt;Saheb&lt;/em&gt;&#xA;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, there was a pressure to increase this amount from Rs. 5 to Rs. 7. This question remained unresolved for eight to ten years. I was the eye witness to one such scenario of that era.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Kolachalam Srinivasa Rao was the director of that drama company. He was an advocate. It was &lt;em&gt;Sāhukār&lt;/em&gt; Netkallappa&#xA;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; who helped the company by making arrangements for them in Bangalore.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;citranaḻīyamu&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Citranaḻīyamu&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;At that time, the passion for drama in Bellary was intense. Several educated young men and women would gather at the theatre. &lt;em&gt;Sarasa Vinodini Sabhā&lt;/em&gt; was established a little earlier than the aforementioned &lt;em&gt;Sumanorama Sabhā&lt;/em&gt;. I’m recalling the names of the &lt;em&gt;sabhā&lt;/em&gt;s from memory; it’s possible that the names were different.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Though he did not teach me, I am grateful to him for certain reasons. As he was the warden of the hostel, we got to know each other quite closely.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I have heard that Gopalakrishna Rao taught Kannada to some Americans at the American Mission in Kolar. They had great regard for his words because of his deed. Gopalakrishna Rao somehow came to know about my feeble financial condition. There was often a delay in my payment of the hostel fees and it was perhaps because of this that he must have surmised my condition.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

During the days I was in the high school, procuring a job was naturally a common concern of students. Matriculation was a momentous landing after the first few flights of the staircase of education. There, one would pause to ponder over the future course. “What would you like to become - teacher, lawyer, doctors, engineer or officer?” - were the questions posed by the elders. I too was anxious about the future. This was when I was studying in the fourth Form in Mysore*.*&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Among the warehouses that lay on the opposite side of the western compound of the Victoria Hospital, the third or the fourth shop belonged to D. Srinivasa Rao. He was the son of &lt;em&gt;Dharmapravartaka&lt;/em&gt; Late D. Appu Rao. The Printing Press of ‘Navakarnataka &amp;amp; Co.’ was housed in the same building. The English newspaper ‘The Karnataka’ that I was running back then was being printed there. I reminisce that those were the last days of that newspaper.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

But it was neat and pretty. The arterial road ran from east to west. On the western end was the Kodandaramaswamy Temple, facing north. The Shiva Temple was opposite to that. The &lt;em&gt;pūjā&lt;/em&gt; was performed punctually and regularly in both temples.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Among the town’s &lt;em&gt;brāhmaṇa&lt;/em&gt; community, Venkatesha Shastri was a prominent figure. He was a Vedic scholar and disciplined in his rituals. He was tall, but very lean. All the townsfolk respected and loved him. His son was Venkatasubba Shastri, who at that time was learning &lt;em&gt;prayoga&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#sdfootnote1sym&#34;&gt;^(^([1]))&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;mantra&lt;/em&gt;s at Kolar from Manikundala Subbaraya Shastri, a relative from his maternal uncle’s side. When he returned to Yeldur, I was living at their home. My studies had stopped. Since I had nothing else to do, Venkatasubba Shastri took me with him. We both used to go to the Kodandaramaswamy Temple every morning and learn &lt;em&gt;mantras&lt;/em&gt;. Now I feel that that was also my good fortune.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Of those shortcomings, two are related to the aforementioned scenario.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;1. I do not have prospects to indicate my relationship to eminent personages and feel proud that my teacher was that great &lt;em&gt;paṇḍita&lt;/em&gt; or this brilliant &lt;em&gt;vidvān&lt;/em&gt;. My teachers were remarkable men in my view but were unknown to the world; they did not boast of great titles such as ‘&lt;em&gt;Mahāmahopadhyāya&lt;/em&gt;,’ ‘D.Litt.,’ and so forth; they had not roared in large assemblies. They were among the commonest of commoners.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;2. I cannot even claim that a certain famous personality or an exceptionally competent individual was among my classmates. Those who studied with me were also among the commonest folk. Nobody ascended to the rank of a great scholar. They did not rise to positions of power. They did not gain fame by becoming an advocate or a doctor.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

His name was Avani Narasinga Rao. Avani is a village about five – six miles from Mulabagal. Avani is also known as Avanti Kshetra. Some people call it as Valmiki Ashram. Locals say that Sita Devi gave birth to Lava and Kusha in that village. They point to a pond amid its hilly rocks and say that this was where Sita washed the soiled clothes of her children. There is a Sita Devi temple atop the hill. Some people refer to it as Sitamahalakshmi while others call it Sitagowri.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Among this group, Thiruvengadam was the one whom people loved the most.

Because he was humorous and helpful, he was loved by all. So, his circle of friends and acquaintances was bigger than any other’s. Because of this large circle, the inconvenience he had to undergo was also high.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Is there any future for joint family system in our country? Is it not declining at present? If we decide that this system is good from a broader perspective, is it possible under the current circumstances to keep it alive?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I find that the joint family system is helpful for the development of a quality namely self-expansion. In a family, if four or five brothers live together, each one of them cultivates the habit of dissolving and unifying his ‘self’ in the with that of his brothers. The wives of those four or five brothers too develop the feeling of non-duality. It is not rare to find that the clothes used by one person is the family is used by the others too.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;unsung-poetry-part-1&#34;&gt;Unsung Poetry (Part 1)&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;[[Unsung Poetry (Part 1)&#x9;Source: &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.prekshaa.in/unsung-poetry-part1&#34;&gt;prekshaa&lt;/a&gt;]]&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Here poetry isn’t the proverbial tough nut to crack. One need not raise their eyebrows remembering illustrious poets like &lt;em&gt;Pampa&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Ranna&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Ṣaḍakṣarī&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Harihara&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Rudra-bhaṭṭa&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Nāraṇappa&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;em&gt;Kumāra-vyāsa&lt;/em&gt;). Our aim here is some light poetry. In these we see hints of prosody here and there; alliteration is present in a haphazard manner. The purpose here is to highlight some light compositions of people which they normally don’t highlight themselves. Since the aim here is to extol the proverbial dwarf reaching out for a coconut high up in the tree or the singer who after opening her mouth to sing ends up burping instead, it might end up being a mischief, a ramble or a tickle. One can guess the nature of the light-hearted poetry by reading the examples given here.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
