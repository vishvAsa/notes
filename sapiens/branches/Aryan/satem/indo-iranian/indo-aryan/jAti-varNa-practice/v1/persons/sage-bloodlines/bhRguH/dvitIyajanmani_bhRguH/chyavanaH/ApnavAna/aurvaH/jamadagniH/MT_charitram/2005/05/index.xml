      <description>&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&#34;https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2005/05/26/the-grass-on-jxs-pasture/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“svargeNa svargaM”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There were two cell phones. One of mine and one of Jx. They were both&#xA;mundane objects. There were numerous cell phones like that in the&#xA;market. The one Jx possessed was very sleekly designed and was easy to&#xA;use. The one I possessed was one which Jx coveted but I found very&#xA;difficult to use. The Mumbai hecklers asked us: After all your mantra&#xA;and tantra did your arcane gods only give you this cell phone? Before I&#xA;could say anything Jx answered: What nonsense are you all talking. He&#xA;has got such a wonderful cell phone- exactly like the one I wanted. The&#xA;hecklers, who always believed Jx, were confused and did not know what to&#xA;do or say. They kept mum.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&#34;https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2005/05/03/kala-chidra/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The last step had been reached. The powers of the mAnava had reached&#xA;their end. Only the powers of the devas were next recourse. It is also&#xA;called the setu- the bridge to the unknown loka. We had reached the end&#xA;of the bridge- we stood at the door stead of the loka hidden beyond the&#xA;impenetrable veil. Many fragments of thoughts crowded the brain- each&#xA;having its own significance to us- we record them here for we are&#xA;passing out that path, which the mAnava takes only once in his&#xA;existence.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
