Ghatikshatam Ammal or Chinna Ammal was the son of “Ghatikashatam Swami”, the great-grandson of Sri Nadadoor Ammal. “Ghatikashatam Swami” was so known because of his extraordinary creative skill, where he could pen 100 slokas in a Ghatika’s time. (1 Ghatika is 24 minutes).

Chinna Ammal learnt all scriptures from Bramhatantra Swami. The founder of Sri Ahobila Matha, Shri Adivan Shatakopan, was Chinna Ammal’s disciple. He learnt Sribhashya, Bhagavadvishaya and Geetabhashya at the feet of Chinna Ammal.
