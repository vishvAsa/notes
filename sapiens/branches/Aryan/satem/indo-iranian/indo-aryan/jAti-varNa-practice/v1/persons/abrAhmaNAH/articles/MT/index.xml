      <description>&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&#34;https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2003/12/03/shri-sitaram-goel/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The doyen of the Hindu revival, the battler of secularists, communists and other allied fiends and the exposer of India’s middle period history has become a guest of the great Vaivasvata. He has been the corrective influence on many a Hindu and been at the vanguard of the fight to preserve the Dharma.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;He has lived a full life and protected his small publishing houses the Voice of India and Aditya Prakashan. Along with Ram Swarup will remembered long for his attempt at awakening the slumbering Hindu consciousness that had been subverted by the disasterous English rule.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I heard a scholar say that rudra himself had caused inspiration to arise within the Englishman Alexis Sanderson, who is apparently given the Sanskrit appellation sundarasena, to revive interest in the shAstra-s taught by him.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Well, Mark SG Dyczkowski despite his flaws passed away in Kashi on the śrīpañcamī (devoted to Saraswati) last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;While he himself mentioned being directly inspired by the mistress of the pashchimAmnAya, he was channeled towards her by sundarasena via a marriage gift.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&#34;https://x.com/blog_supplement/status/1886200761492865439&#34;&gt;TW&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I once had correspondence with him (Dyczkowski) about the pashchimAMnAya in the saundaryalaharI. He was a very good scholar.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Apparently, it was Alexis Sanderson who inspired him to turn to the pashchimAMnAya, in whose study his contribution is incalculable. He also had a connection to the learned Gopinath Kaviraj, the brilliant vA~Nga scholar of the mantramArga, via his successor. I have only glanced at parts of his final work &amp;ndash; new edition and translation of the tantrAloka of abhinavagupta and its commentary by jayaratha, but it promises to be of great value.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
