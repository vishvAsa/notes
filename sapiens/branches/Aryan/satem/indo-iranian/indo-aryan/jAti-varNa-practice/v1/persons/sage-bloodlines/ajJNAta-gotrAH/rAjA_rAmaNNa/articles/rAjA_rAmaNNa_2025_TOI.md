From Tumkur to Pokhran: The multifaceted legacy of Raja Ramanna in India's nuclear journey

Raja Ramanna, a significant figure in India's nuclear programme, played a pivotal role in the nation’s atomic advancements. His tenure included the successful Pokhran tests and the transformation of DRDO. He later served both as a Minister and a foundational pioneer in the nuclear field.

BENGALURU: Raja Ramanna, whose birth centenary was commemorated Tuesday (January 28), stood as a towering figure who seamlessly bridged the worlds of science, music, philosophy, and public service. The nuclear physicist played a key role in India’s nuclear programme, including the two successful tests in Pokhran.

Ramanna was born in Titpur, in Karnataka’s Tumkur district. He studied science at Madras Christian College before moving to London, where he completed a PhD in physics at King’s College. He returned to India in 1949.

Upon his return to India, he was recruited by Homi Bhabha to join the Indian nuclear programme and served as director of the Bhabha Atomic Research Centre (BARC) twice. India tested its first atomic bomb in 1974 during his tenure. For this accomplishment, Ramanna received the Padma Vibhushan, India’s second-highest civilian honour.

According to the Atomic Heritage Foundation: “...On a visit to Baghdad in 1978, Ramanna was recruited by Saddam Hussein to build an atomic bomb for Iraq. “You have done enough for your country; don’t go back,” declared Hussein. “Stay here and take over our nuclear programme. I will pay you whatever you want.” Ramanna refused and left Iraq the next day.”

During his career, Ramanna also served as chairman of the Indian Atomic Energy Commission and as secretary of the Department of Atomic Energy. Aside from this, he served as the scientific adviser to the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO).

According to DRDO, Ramanna made significant contributions in the field of neutron thermalisation and reactor design. 

> “He brought home to DRDO three important aspects of leadership.  
> India’s first nuclear reactor, Apsara, was designed under his guidance. Under his tenure, DRDO was transformed into a more challenging workplace.”

A DRDO statement further reads: 

> “...The predominant activity of catering to the short-term requirements of the services was replaced by technical activities, leading to contemporary systems development. Thrust areas were clearly identified and prioritisation of the resources was accordingly carried out. 
> 
> The personnel policy was also changed to conform to the ‘flexible complementing’ policy adopted by other S&T departments. Steps were taken to promote inter-laboratory interaction and cooperation for better utilisation of resources.”

After his retirement in January 1987, Ramanna established the National Institute of Advanced Studies in Bengaluru in 1988.

Member of Parliament Jairam Ramesh said in a post on X that 

> “Ramanna was the foundational pillar of the country’s nuclear establishment.” 

Recollecting several of Ramanna’s contributions, Ramesh recounted: 

> “During January-November 1990, Ramanna was minister of state of defence in the VP Singh govt. His parliamentary career was unique. He is the only person to be first elected to the Rajya Sabha in March 1990 from UP for a two-year term and later nominated to the Council of States by the President of India when IK Gujral was PM for a six-year term beginning August 1997.”
