      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://archive.org/details/kamalA-parents-bio/page/n3/mode/2up?view=theater&#34;&gt;pdf source&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;THROUGH THE EYES OF A DAUGHTER&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;the story of my parents by kamala parthasarathy&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-it-all-started&#34;&gt;How it all started&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I was at my friend Naguâ€™s house in January, 2011.&#xA;GRP and I had gone there to condole the demise of her&#xA;father. She showed me a folder containing a family biogra-&#xA;phy that her brother had written. It contained details of her&#xA;parents, all the siblings and various family events. It was&#xA;poignant, amusing, and all the family members truly en-&#xA;joyed going through and getting reminded of various hap-&#xA;penings, both happy and otherwise. Seeing this gave me an&#xA;idea. I wanted to put in writing the profile of my parents&#xA;for my daughters, nieces, nephews, grandchildren, grand-&#xA;nieces and nephews, so they may get an idea about their&#xA;grand and great grandparents. The first person I thought of&#xA;contacting, to give me her account of her experiences with&#xA;my parents was my dear cousin, Rangamani. Prompt as&#xA;she is, she sent in her piece, a lovely write-up on my moth-&#xA;er. Her account was so touching, truthful and hilarious that&#xA;it moved me to tears. Now I know that whatever is writ-&#xA;ten should be an honest opinion with candid information&#xA;of the good and the not so. Thereafter I talked to several&#xA;other people to give me their accounts and following is my&#xA;best effort at writing about my father, warm, affectionate&#xA;and generous, and my mother, equally warm and generous&#xA;and also impulsive and fun loving. I hope my effort is worth&#xA;reading and gives the readers an idea of the kind of people&#xA;my parents were.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
