      <description>&lt;p&gt;Source: TW&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the wildest thing about Kumārajīva&amp;rsquo;s life is that the Chinese thought he was so valuable that they forced him to have sex to produce heirs (he had taken a vow of celibacy) on multiple occassions.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On the first occassion, the Later Liang dynasty ruler holding him captive made him &amp;ldquo;surrender his celibacy&amp;rdquo; after getting him drunk. Then, when he came to China, Yao Xing, of the later Qin forced him to cohabit with no less than 10 courtesans in his harem to &amp;ldquo;carry his seed&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Source: TW - Of Life, Off Life (Social, Political Spiritual, Essays, &amp;hellip;) by a Hindi teacher Dr Ramprasad Mishr.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;RAHUL SANKRITYAYAN (9 April 1893 - 14 April 1963) was, to quote Nehru, “One of our greatest scholars.&amp;quot; A towering man of letters, he was a historian, archaeologist and philosopher. Besides, he was freedom-fighter and crusader against Hindu Dharm, including Hindu way of life.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Born as Kedar Pandeya in a remote village of Azamgarh district of Eastern Uttar Pradesh, he fled to Ayodhya to become Ram Udar Das during his naughty-cum-haughty boyhood days. He left Ayodhya to turn Left and became a Congressman in Bihar. Then he became a Communist but was thrown out by the party when he opposed “Romanscript-Hindustani&amp;rsquo; and favoured &amp;lsquo;Devanagari-script Hindi&amp;rsquo;.+++(5)+++ Like all communists, he was anti-Hindu; but becoming anti-Hindi would have become suicidal as he was out and out a Hindi-litterateur, he rather opted-out. After all,&amp;lsquo;self&amp;rsquo; comes first of all! And, totalitarianism allows no dissent! Communism is an insult to mankind.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
