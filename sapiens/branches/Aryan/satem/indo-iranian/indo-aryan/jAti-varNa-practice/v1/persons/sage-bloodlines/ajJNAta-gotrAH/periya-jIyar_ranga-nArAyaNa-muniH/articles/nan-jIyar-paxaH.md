## A Srinivasa Raghavan
All the Guruparamparas uniformly declare that Nanjiyar has written a Bhashya on Sri Sukta. The Rahasya-Traya-Sara of Sri Venkatanatha corroborates this. After discussing the greatness and nature of Lakshmi in great detail in Chapter XXIII of that work, Venkatanatha [[xxxi]]concludes that Periya Jiyar also has adduced the necessary arguments in the Sri Sukta Bhashya.\* The introduction in the beginning of the Bhashya and the long discussion in the Bhashya of the ninth verse amply corroborate this statement. 

That the Periya Jiyar\' here mentioned is Nanjiyar is known to all acquainted with the Vaishnava hierarchy and can be seen from another passage in the same book. It says: Periya Jiyar wrote a Nityam based on those of Ramanuja and Bhattar which he began with a salutation to Bhattar his Guru. The author of this Nityam should be Nanjiyar; for he was the only person who was a disciple of Bhattar, a good scholar, teaching philosophy to others, and the author of some books on philosophy.

Again the order in which Venkatanatha quotes the Acaryas also proves that Periya Jiyar is Nanjiyar. The order is: Yamuna, Ramanuja, Kurattalvan, Bhattar and Periya Jiyar. The place of Nanjiyar is after Bhattar and there was no one immediately after Bhattar and before Venkatanatha who was a scholar and a Sannyasin, and the author of a Nitya and Sri Sukta Bhashya.

That this Periya Jiyar was also known as Narayana Muni can be seen from the PancaRatra-Raksha of Desika where he quotes the same slokas†, attributed in the Rahasya - trayasara to Periya Jiyar, under the name of Narayana Muni and speaks of the latter as following the footsteps of Parasara Bhattar. 



cf. Panca Ratra Raksha, printed in Vyavahara Tarangini Press 1880 A. D. in Grantha script :p. 31 : 

अत एव हि तदुभयानुसारिभिः (वङ्गिवंशेश्वरपर राशर भट्टारकानुसारिभिः) नारायणमुनिभिरपि पञ्चकालकल्पनया तत्तत्कालानुष्ठेयानि यथाक्रमं प्रपञ्चितानि । तथा हिभगवच्चरणांभोजपरिचर्याविधिक्रमम् । एकान्तिमिरनुष्ठेयं नित्यं समभिदध्यमहे ॥” 

p. 65 संगृहीतं नारायणमुनिभिः- 

> आपो हीत्यादिभिर्मन्त्रैः वाचकैः परमात्मनः । संप्रोक्ष्य मन्त्राचमनं मन्त्रैस्तत्प्रतिपादकैः ॥ 
नारायणात्मकान् देवान् ऋषीन् संतर्पयेत् पितॄन् ॥ 

[[xxxiii]] 

The opening stanza of Sri Sukta Bhashya is a salutation to Bhattar : श्रीपराशरभार्यः श्रीरङ्गेशपुरोहितः, " It is the tradition among the Vaishnavaites to salute their immediate Acaryas in the beginning of their works and the opening verse will generally be adopted as the Tanian' of that Acarya. Cf. ' यो नित्यभच्युतपदांबुजयुग्म'-which is the Mangala sloka of Sri Vaikuntha Stava of Sri Vatsanka Misra, a disciple of Ramanuja and which is now Ramanuja'stanian'; "m: नमउक्तिमधीमहे " which is the Mangala Sloka of Sri Rangaraja Stava of Bhattar, the son and disciple of Kurattalvan and which is now the latter's 'tanian.' So the Sloka ' श्रीपराशरभट्टार्य ' composed by Nanjiyar, the disciple, as the Mangala Sloka of Sri Sukta Bhashya is the 'tanian' of Bhattar. 

There is another statement of Venkatanatha in chapter XXIII of his Rahasya-Traya-Sara:  

Nanjiyar heard from Accan (a direct disciple of Ramanuja) what Sri Ramanuja had said (regarding Sri) and summarised it: Wherever the Lord is spoken of, there Lakshmi also is spoken of."\*  

Sri Sukta Bhashya is the only work of Nanjiyar in which he has dealt with Sri exclusively and in great detail, and the internal evidence of the Bhashya also corroborates this. For these words of Venkatanatha are almost a translation of the concluding stanza of Sri Sukta Bhashya: 

“यतीन्द्रमाहानसिकात्  
प्रणतार्तिहरात् गुरोः ।  
सत्संप्रदायसिद्धोऽर्थः  
श्रीसूक्तस्य विनिश्चितः || ” 

எம்பெருமானைச் சொன்ன இடத்திலே பிராட்டியையும் சொல்லிற்றாம் 
என்று தொடங்கி, உடையவர் அருளிச்செய்த வார்த்தையை ஆச்சான் பக்கலிலே கேட்டு நஞ்ஜீயர் ங்ைகிரஹித்தார்.(ரஹஸ்யத்ரயஸாரம்XXIII ஸித்தோபாய சோதனாதிகாரம்.) 

[[XXXiv]] 

[Sri Sukta has been interpreted (by us) according to the correct tradition as we learnt it at the feet of (our) master Pranatartihara, the Mahanasika of Sri Ramanuja.] 

It is well-known that Pranatartihara attended to the cooking of the food of Ramanuja and hence his name Mahanasika' (cook); and he was also known as Kidambi Accan' and 'Madaippalli Accan.' So from these two we have to conclude that Nanjiyar and Ranganatha Muni are different names of the same person who learnt all these truths about Lakshmi from Pranatartihara, the Accan, who in his turn, learnt them from Ramanuja. 

The order in which the Bhashyakara quotes authorities also shows that our Ranganatha Muni is none other than Nanjiyar. When he cites authorities in support of some statement of his, he begins with Sruti and Smriti and then proceeds to the work of the Acaryas. There the order is Yamuna, Ramanuja, Sri Vatsanka Misra and Bhattar. Himself being the immediate disciple of the last, he stops with Bhattar. Venkatanatha, who is later than Ranganatha Muni, alias Nanjiyar, goes one step further and cites Nanjiyar also, as Periya Jiyar or Nanjiyar in Tamil works and as Narayana Muni in Sanskrit works. Ranganatha Muni (alias Nanjiyar) agrees entirely with his master Bhattar in his concept of Sri and the latter's view is known to us [[XXXV]] from his Sri Gunaratnakosa' and his 'Lakshmikalyana.' (Three slokas are all that we have of Bhattar's play Lakshmi kalyana and they are had in the three works of Venkatanatha: Rahasyatraya-sara XXIII, Sara-sara. ii, and Tatparya candrika or the gloss on Gita Bhashya XVIII. 14.) 

There is a slight indication in the Bhashya even in the manner of citing the names of the earlier Acaryas which corroborates our conclusion. Yamuna, Ramanuja, and Sri Vatsanka Misra he mentions only with the plural suffix out of respect whereas he refers to Bhattar his immediate Acarya with honorific and plural suffixes (भट्टपराशरपादैः). 

Further in the concluding stanza, the author of the Bhashya styles himself as श्रीमहालक्ष्मिदास (a devotee or servant of Goddess Lakshmi). It reminds us of Bhattar styling himself as one of the retinue of Maithili (Lakshmi of Ramayana) (vide Sri Gunaratnakosa, 51.); and thus the Bhashyakara echoes the sentiment of his beloved master. He again quotes and explains in the introduction Sraddha-, and Medha-suktas mentioned by Bhattar in his Sahasranama Bhashya as dealing with the greatness of Sri, and explains also the Aditi-, Vak-, and Prthivi-suktas indicated by the term ('adi') 'etc.' in that work. Venkatanatha also agrees entirely with Nanjiyar's interpretation as he cites in his Catus-sloki Bhashya all the Samhitas and Suktas quoted by Nanjiyar.[[xxxvi]] 

Apart from the agreement of the names of the author, of the book, and of the subject matter, there is verbal agreement also.  
Venkatanatha ( alias Vedanta Desika) in his Rahasya Raksha, a commentary on Catus-Sloki  
states the views of different Schools on the concept of Lakshmi  
and concludes in the words of an earlier writer who is none other than our Bhashyakara: 

> “अन्योन्येच्छा विघातादिनिवृत्तौ तत्परत्वतः । ऐककण्ठ्यमशेषाणां आगमानां भवत्विति ॥  
पञ्चस्वेतेषु पक्षेषु कश्चिदेकः प्रमाणवान् ।  
सलक्ष्मीकस्य साम्राज्यं सर्वथा सुप्रतिष्ठितम् ॥" 

This is only a restatement almost in identical words of the view of Ranganatha Muni expressed in his Bhashya on verse 9 of Sri Sukta, but summarised here for exigencies of metre. Ranganatha Muni writes: (p. 48 of Sri Sukta Bhashya) 

> "एवं सर्वभूतेश्वरत्ववचनसाम्यात्  
> द्वयोर् अपि मुख्येश्वरत्वस्य दुर्-अपह्नवत्वेन  
> सर्वागमानां ईश्वर-व्यक्त्य्-ऐक्य-परत्वे अनुपपन्ने,  
> सर्वागमानां ऐककण्ठ्यं अन्योऽन्येच्छा-विघातादि-निवृत्तौ तात्पर्यात् उपपन्नम् ।"   +++(5)+++
>
> [Thus there are some passages in the Vedas which say clearly that Narayana is the sovereign of all beings and others which, with equal clearness, declare that Lakshmi is the Sovereign. So [[xxxvii]] the paramount sovereignty of both Lakshmi and Narayana becomes unshakable. But there are yet others which declare that there is only one sovereign of the Universe. The apparent contradiction between the first two statements and the third must be reconciled by saying that, though both Lakshmi and Narayana are the sovereigns, there is no difference of opinion between the two (and so practically there is only one sovereign).] +++(5)+++

Sri Venkatanatha has cited with perfect approval the Sri Sukta Bhashya of Nanjiyar as an authority in his Rahasyatraya Sara and has quoted almost the same words from that Bhashya in his Catus-sloki Bhashya. So our Bhashyakara is Nanjiyar and no one else. That the author is referred to by two different names is no great obstacle against arriving at the above conclusion; for among the Vaishnavas it is common to have more than one name. The father of Vadihamsambuvahacarya had two names: Sri Rangaraja and Padmanabha. Desika himself is known by two names: Venkatanatha and Vedanta Desika; Bhattar as Parasara Bhattar and Ranganatha though the latter name is not so well-known. So there is nothing strange in our author having two names. 

Thus we see that Ranganatha Muni, the author of Sri Sukta Bhashya that is published now, and Nanjiyar, its reputed author are the same: 

- because of the opening stanza which is a [[xxxviii]] salutation to Bhattar; 
- because of the more respectful reference to Bhattar and his works; 
- because of the absence of a quotation from any author later than Bhattar; 
- because of the concluding stanzas where he styles himself a devotee of Mahalakshmi and where he acknowledges his indebtedness to Pranatartihara alias Madaipalli or Kidambi Accan; 
- and because of the citations by Desika in his Rahasyatraya Sara (chap. 23 and 29,) Panca Ratra Raksha, and Catus-sloki Bhashya. 

\* An ingenious interpretation of the name 'Nanjiyar' is given by the author of Sri Tattva Nirnaya' in Tamil. He says that the original name was 'Nam-perumal-jiyar and 'Nanjiyar' is its corrupted form. (இவர் திருநாமம் 'நம்பெருமாள் ஜீயர், இத்திருநாமம் சுருங்கிச் சுருங்கி 'நஞ்ஜீயர்' என S. p. 8.) This only helps our view: the Tamil name of Ranganatha is Nam-perumal' and Muni is 'Jiyar'; so Ranganatha Muni translated into the Tamil of the Vaishnavaite section will be Namperumal Jiyar. It is an easy step from this name to 'Nanjiyar.'
