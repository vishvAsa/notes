      <description>&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&#34;https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2004/07/31/nityaklinna/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Burg Niedeck ist im Elsass der Sage wohlbekannt. Die Höhe, wo&#xA;vorzeiten die Burg der Riesen stand.”-Adelbert von Chamisso&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I stood before the great vimalashambhu. The amR^ita flowed from the&#xA;heaven cup of soma and drenched the great nityaklinnA on the 4th point&#xA;of the yoni triangle. Raimented in the red, her limbs were smeared with&#xA;red unguent, she held a skull bowl filled with red wine. Her face was&#xA;full of smiles and restless with desire. The power of nityaklinna&#xA;briefly filled me and I coursed over the rasArNava like boat gliding&#xA;over water. It was that mixture of all the emotions that welled up in me&#xA;at once. The sensations were of every possible description. And at the&#xA;end of it I had transcended them.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&#34;https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2004/07/16/the-ghost-transferred/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I received a call from him. He sounded much the same rustic fellow as I&#xA;hand last enountered him over 8 years ago. His accent was the same&#xA;rasping one, which sounded like a metal plate rubbing on another. I&#xA;asked what had befallen him. He replied that he had been to the house&#xA;beside the curve on the northward street and was quite sick after his&#xA;stay there. I was shocked, that this could happen. I remembered the old&#xA;words that the place might not be alright. My mind turned to the tale of&#xA;Dildrum and Doldrum.Once a man walked through an alley of cats. Suddenly&#xA;a cat yelled “tell Dildrum that Doldrum is dead”. All the cats dispersed&#xA;meowing away incomprehensibly. The man came home and told his wife. I&#xA;heard a cat state that Doldrum is dead. Immediately his cat yelled: “I&#xA;shall soon be king of the cats” and climbed up the wall and departed.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
