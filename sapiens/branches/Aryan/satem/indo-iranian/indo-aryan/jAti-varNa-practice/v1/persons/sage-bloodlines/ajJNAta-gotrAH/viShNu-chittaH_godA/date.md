## Data
### धनुर्-मासः, पूर्ण-चन्द्रः
Entire tiruppAvai is about 1 day.

nautical twilight (eastern sky brightens, Sun is between 6° and 12° below the horizon, limited stars)  
between Astronomical twilight (Sun is between 12° and 18° below the horizon), and civil twilight. 

Also, full moon might make it problematic for astronomical twilight. Considering nautical twilight is also better than astronomical twilight as it is a full moon sky.

### Jupiter and venus

> वॆळ्ळिय्+++(=शुक्रः)+++ ऎऴुन्दु वियाऴम्+++(=गुरुः)+++ **उऱङ्गिट्रु**,  
पुळ्ळुं+++(=पक्षी)+++ शिलम्बिन+++(=कूजन्ति)+++ काण्! … ॥ १३ ॥

> शुक्रः प्रादुरभूद् बृहस्पतिर् अगाद् अस्तं द्विजाश् चोत्थिताः  
> 
> The venus has risen in the morn,  
The Jupiter has vanished from the sky

So, venus should rise first, then guru should set (present tense), with birds chattering and eastern nautical twilight (per prior verses).

Between 672 and 886, it happened only in 672, 696, 731, 885 and 886 in the month of dhanu.

Caveat - The particular Astronomical sight inspiring the poetess is probable, but not definite. खगोलस्थितिर् अपि काल्पनिकी स्यात्। If I'm a poet describing night in the himAlaya-s, I would specify many details unique to that place without actually describing it live. 

### Loss
viShNuchitta / periyALvAr describes his lost daughter (DP_२९९) - 

> ऒरु मगळ् तऩ्ऩै उडैयेऩ्, उलगम् निऱैन्द पुगऴाल्  
तिरुमगळ् पोल वळर्त्तेऩ्, सॆङ्-गण्-माल् ताऩ् कॊण्डु पोऩाऩ्,

> I have only one daughter  
and I raised her like Lakshmi, the beautiful goddess:  
The world praises me as a good mother:  
Lovely-eyed Thirumāl has taken her with him:

### king neDumAran

### vallabhadeva
Much is made of the fact that hagiographies wrote centuries later call the ruler as Vallabhadeva. It is better to use the words of the Azhvars themselves rather than hagiographies written much later - which are not be perfect recording of past history. 

And the claim that periyALvAr was contemporary of srivallabhan itself is baseless. Azhvar doesn't mention the name srivallabhan. Much later gpp text says vallabhadeva pandyan.



### pANDya chronology
See separate page: [TW](/notes/sapiens/branches/Aryan/satem/indo-iranian/indo-aryan/jAti-varNa-practice/v2/persons/pANDya/articles/ravilochana-dates)

### nAthamuni
rAmAnuja was born 1017. (1111 ce viShNuvardhana inscription in shrIrangam matches traditional 1098 melukoTe entry + 12 year exile.) 
When he was about 20, yAmuna was \~ 100. (Every guru parampara statement is very clear that he was extremely old.)  
So, yAmuna was born around 937.  
So, his grandfather nAthamuni must have preceeded 880.  
To make viShNuchitta and ANDAL contemporaneous with the compiler of their texts, nAthamuni, would be nonsensical.

## 696 पक्षः
guru sets at the beginning of nautical twilight (sun being about 11.5 deg below horizon).

#### mAravarmA
Even as per their own dates (which are wrong), ninra seer neDumAran was only ruling till 700 from 650. One may call him nayanmar. That doesn't change the fact that the ruler was indeed a neDumAran. Praise for a viShNu temple does not necessarily make neDumAran to be a "vaiShNava". shaiva kings gladly supported and even built viShNu temples - let alone sophisticated ones praising a sacred mountain shrine.

Pandikkovai uses the title Vallabhan for him.

## 672 पक्षः
ravilochana

### Astronomical fit
6th dec 672. approx Dhanus 13.
10th dec 672. Full moon.  
Venus rising at 3.09 and jupiter setting at around 5:01 - some 20 min before nautical twilight.

### neDumAran fit
any mAravarman could be called neDumAran.
Nedumaran living in 672 is shaky, but even if you accept it, it would still match Andal's date.


## 731
Mu raghavaiyangar considered 731. But that happened much before sunrise. 731 occurrence is before twilight.

### rAjasiMha mAravarmA
The date of 731 CE seems most probable. The reigning monarch was Rajasimha Maravarman - who was also called Ter-Maran, thus fitting the title Nedumaran. Velvikudi plates call Ter-Maran (ca 720/730-768) as not just Rajasimha Maravarman but also as bhusundari-'vallabha' (husband of earth - as a king).  
Interestingly, hagiography also uses similar term for him bhartA dharaNyAH - husband of earth and thus, vallabhadeva.

This Maravarman's son Jatila Parantaka Varaguna was a parama Vaishnava and perhaps the greatest of all Pandya rulers of Kadungon lineage till 10th century. He has stated in his Sreevaramanga plates that he celebrates guru-carita. This guru might be Periyazhvar himself - who is said to have established the validity of Vaishnava siddhanta in the Pandyan royal court.


## 886
15 dec 886 matches very beautifully as per some (eg. nAgasvamI). Venus rising at 4.57 am, twilight at 5.12, civil twilight at 6.05, jupiter setting at 6.22 and sun rising at 6.28

### Astronomy
Jupiter sets right about sunrise, and not at nautical twilight. Whereas she visits krishna himself before or exactly at civil twilight.. ciRRan ciRu kAlai as she says.

Moon is prominently in conjunction with jupiter - but ANDAL does not mention it.

### nAthamuni
But 886 is too late and it matches with nathamunis times. Periyazhvar was not a contemporary of Nathamuni. His video doesn't explain how there is a venus-jupiter combo in 861 CE.

### King
Moreover, Periyazhvar mentions the name of the reigning Pandya monarch, after Andal's marriage, as Nedumaran. If Andal's marriage happened in 885/6, then the reigning monarch for that decade and next was Parantaka Viranarayana - not any Nedumaran.

Dr Nagasamy and a few others use the fact that Srimara Srivallabha could be the king as he had both titles. But he reigned in 815-862CE. There was no Margazhi Purnima where Jupiter set and Venus rose before sunrise during his reign or for decades before his reign. His title Srivallabha doesnt exactly match Vallabhadeva of later texts either.

#### Motivation
tiruvempAvai of mANikkavAchakar describes a shaiva lady undertaking a vrata so as to marry a good shaiva. shaiva fanatics want to twist evidence to imply that this novel vrata inspired tiruppAvai, rather than the other way around.

- gopis undergoing vrata for kRShNa is an old concept (recounted in the later bhAgavata), while the shaiva vrata is relatively much novel.
- mANikkavAchakar mentions a (shaiva) king (vara-guNa) who ruled in the 860s. However, confused (or contra-factual) shaivas push him back to early 800s. 


> And then they will claim that Andal lived in 861 or 886 (supposedly during Srimara Srivallabha's time). So Tiruvempavai came first and Tiruppavai was essentially a copy of Tiruvempavai.
