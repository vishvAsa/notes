Mahavidvan Purisai Srirangachariyar Swami&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Sthalacarya Purusha&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Tamil Version and Introduction By Sri.U.Ve.TA.Krishnamacharya Vidvan &amp;amp; Siromani&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Head of the Dept.of Nyaya (Retd) S.V.Oriental College,Tirupati&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Translated in to English by Shri.T.C.A.Ramanujam Chief Commissioner of Income Tax (Retd.) Member-Income Tax Appellate Tribunal (Retd.) Advocate-Madras&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;0&#34;&gt;0&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-man-of-courage&#34;&gt;The Man of Courage&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The title was given by Ramanuja to Ananthalvan who accepted to go to Tirumalai and cultivate the flower garden-nandavanam to serve the Lord Venkatesvara.Thousand years back, Tirumalai was a deep forest. It was not congenial for human habitation. There were ferocious animals like tigers and leopards, snakes and various poisonous reptiles. Only Ananthalvan had the courage to come and cultivate the garden there. Ramanuja appreciated this and called him as Anpillai -i.e Courageous man. Hence the successors came to be called Anantha-anpillai. When we look at the main deity viz Lord Venkatesvara in the Garbhagriha we find the application of Pacchaikarpuram (Medicated Camphor) at the chin. There is an anecdote in this regard. Ananthalvan was digging the tank and his wife was helping him. She picked up the dug-up earth and put it away at a distance. She was in an advanced state of pregnancy and was finding this task very difficult. A brahmachari came to her rescue and asked her to give the pan to him so that he would dump it at a distance. When Ananthalvan saw his wife returning so quickly, he asked her and she told that a brahmachari was helping her to throw away the mud. Ananthalvan was angry with the interruption of the stranger and he threw the spade at him. It hit the chin and the blood oozed. When archakas opened the temple, they found that the Lord was bleeding at the chin.The archakas then applied pacchaikarpuram and the bleeding stopped. The practice still continues. Ananthalvan’s garden is in the left side of the temple where Ananthalvan breathed the last. Lord Venkatesvara every year on this day visits the place and offers special honour to the tree under which Ananthalvan expired. There is another important historical aspect in Ananthalvan Valitttirunamam. Malaiyil Venkatavarku Mamanar Valiye. That means let him live long, who is the father in law of Venkatesa. This gives a clue by which we can get the&lt;/p&gt;</description>
