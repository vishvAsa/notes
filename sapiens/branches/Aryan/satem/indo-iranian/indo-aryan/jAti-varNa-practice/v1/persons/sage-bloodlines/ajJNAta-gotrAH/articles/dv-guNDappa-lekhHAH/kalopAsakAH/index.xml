She had a foster daughter. I remember her name to be &lt;em&gt;Ratnāsānī&lt;/em&gt;. In those days, the &lt;em&gt;Bharatācārya&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#_ftn1&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;[1]&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; who lived in our town was a &lt;em&gt;vaidika&lt;/em&gt; (a Vedic scholar/someone who follows and practices the Vedic lifestyle), Panasakayala Venkatasubbabhatta. I must have been around seven-eight years of age when I saw him. He was around seventy. He was a respected person in the town’s assembly of connoisseurs. Once, Venkatanarayanabhatta and such other connoisseurs requested Venkatasubbabhatta to perform. I more or less remember the reply given by Venkatasubbabhatta: “Oh come on – I have already turned seventy. My beard and moustache have diminished. Face and body have become weak. Now why are you asking to see me perform? When there is no zeal in the body, performance becomes a parody. Whatever is to be done now, I have to make-do with these … They will not realise it; I will not forget it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The object—&lt;em&gt;lakṣya-vastu&lt;/em&gt;—and the subject—&lt;em&gt;lakṣyakāra&lt;/em&gt;—get mixed up indistinguishably; this is the perfect state of Experience.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;[[Bangalore’s Vainikas and Violinists&#x9;Source: &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.prekshaa.in/bangalores-vainikas-violinists&#34;&gt;prekshaa&lt;/a&gt;]]&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As far as I know, there were three eminent &lt;em&gt;vaiṇika&lt;/em&gt;s (musicians who play the &lt;em&gt;vīṇā&lt;/em&gt;) in Bangalore. Of them, the seniormost was an Iyengar. If I remember right, his full name was either Rangaswami Iyengar or Krishnaswami Iyengar. His house was on the street leading to Chikka Lalbagh from Balepet – in the locality of Purnaiah’s &lt;em&gt;satra&lt;/em&gt; (rest-house).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;By the time I met Iyengar he was already quite old. Two or three times a week, there would be a get-together of musicians (&lt;em&gt;Saṅgīta Sādhaka Goṣṭhi&lt;/em&gt;) at his house; starting at about eight or eight-thirty in the evening until eleven or eleven-thirty. At the start, Iyengar would take his &lt;em&gt;vīṇā&lt;/em&gt; and play a round of &lt;em&gt;rāga&lt;/em&gt; improvisation. Taking a cue from that, another musician would sing and the violinist would repeat it with some variations. This would be followed by yet another singer. Then the &lt;em&gt;kirtana&lt;/em&gt; (song) would start. In this manner, each and every aspect of the &lt;em&gt;Pallavi&lt;/em&gt; (opening line or stanza of a &lt;em&gt;kṛti&lt;/em&gt;) or the &lt;em&gt;Caraṇa&lt;/em&gt; (last segment of a &lt;em&gt;kṛti&lt;/em&gt;) would be taught in four to five rounds. The &lt;em&gt;mṛdaṅga&lt;/em&gt; player would follow each round and accompany the musicians. Then they would take a break to give him a chance. He would showcase his prowess during that time. I’m unaware if this methodology is in practice anywhere today. During those practice sessions, I got the opportunity to discover Iyengar’s expertise and mastery over &lt;em&gt;rāga&lt;/em&gt;s.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Though the usage of ‘tiger’ as a simile for a musician may be debated, the tiger is renowned for representing courage and fortitude. This was the prowess of Venkataraya. He belonged to the line of great &lt;em&gt;vidvan&lt;/em&gt;s of music. His training in tradition and the craft of music was of a high degree. When a person acquires learning by his own efforts, when the mind becomes filled with enthusiasm and brightness, a zeal arises to create waves. Even after he was ninety, Venkataraya had this kind of zeal.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

He was also one who deeply engaged in the study of Sanskrit poetry. Therefore when he uttered a Sanskrit word (or phrase), the pronunciation of the letters and the division of the words would manifest itself clearly.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;He was a short man with a nice ivory skin colour. He was also well-versed in Tamil and Telugu.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Acharya’s grandson, S Krishnamurthy, M.A. was the editor of that book. That anthology also contains essays by a few eminent scholarly connoisseurs. I also got the opportunity to express my innermost sentiments in the foreword I wrote for Acharya’s wonderful work, &lt;em&gt;Nā kaṇḍa kalāvidaru&lt;/em&gt; (‘Artistes whom I have encountered’). Another book written by Acharya, &lt;em&gt;Nenapugaḻu&lt;/em&gt; is also an interesting read.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

At that time, a man came there, stood at a distance, and spoke in Telugu in a soft voice, “Right now, if I requested you for some food, would it be inconvenient?”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That man must have been 50 or 55 years old. He had a copper vessel in his hand and had covered himself with a quilt. He wore neither a shirt nor a vest. A dirty dhoti was all he wore. He had folded it and worn it like a &lt;em&gt;mundu&lt;/em&gt; [almost like wearing shorts; the portion below the knees remains uncovered]. He had another small piece of cloth in his hand. His head was completely shaven and he had a two- or three-day old stubble.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

He was popularly called Gattanagari Muniswamy. He was a goldsmith. One of his ancestors by name Ghattanna might have probablygained popularity for his athleticism.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Muniswamy loved music and literature; good-humored and generous, he was known to be competent in gold and silver smithy works. Yet I have never got an opportunity to see him at work. It’s true that there was alwaysa workbench in front of him. However, much of his time was devoted to group meetings. All the work was being done by two of his nephews whom he had fostered. Muniswamy was guiding them in their work and supervising them. People had great faith in him.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

He possessed an extremely manly voice in both singing and teaching music. I listened to his music for the first time in 1904. He was in his youth back then. That particular concert was attended by quite a large number of Vidwans belonging to the older generation.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sri Sastri&lt;/strong&gt; was immaculately attired. A Felt hat on his head. An elaborate wraparound&lt;em&gt;Shalya&lt;/em&gt;(to cover the upper body). A fine coat. A&lt;em&gt;Dhoti&lt;/em&gt;with an ornate border. It was a wedding concert. Sri Sastri opened it with the very popular composition,&lt;em&gt;Vatapi Ganapatim.&lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt;Alapanam&lt;/em&gt;of the Raga, the rendition of the composition, the*Kalpanaswara–*all of these were intricately woven. Now it appears that it was one of the concerts that he performed in the initial days of his career. Most folks in the audience showered generous praises and discussed among themselves that a new star had risen in the world of music.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Just like the fashion in food and clothing has changed, there has been a change in music. About thirty or forty years ago, Malavalli Sundaramma was singing at a wedding in a friend’s house. The Tyagaraja &lt;em&gt;kriti&lt;/em&gt; in Harikambhoji &lt;em&gt;raga&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;‘Dinamani vamsha’&lt;/em&gt; was one of the songs she sang. Within half an hour of her finishing the song, a friend of mine came up to me and whispered in my ears, “Make her sing &lt;em&gt;‘Dinamani vamsha’&lt;/em&gt;!” Per my request, she sang the song a second time. About forty-five minutes later, another friend came to me and indicated his interest in listening to &lt;em&gt;‘Dinamani vamsha.’&lt;/em&gt; When I put forward the request to the singer, she said, “Oh! Didn’t I just sing it a second time!”&lt;/p&gt;</description>

I met &lt;strong&gt;Captain Ajab Khan&lt;/strong&gt; to gather information about the army and other personnel employed by the Princely States. &lt;strong&gt;Ajab Khan&lt;/strong&gt; hailed from Punjab. He had served as a Commander of one of the units engaged in the &lt;strong&gt;First World War (1914-18).&lt;/strong&gt; He had been nominated as a Member of the then &lt;strong&gt;Rajya Sabha&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;strong&gt;Right Honourable&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Srinivasa Sastri&lt;/strong&gt; had written a letter of introduction to the Captain after suggesting to me that Ajab Khan would supply the most accurate information and details that I needed.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Ramachandracharya 3.  Venkatappa 4.  Sethumadhava Rao&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Among these, Madhavayya was the best when it comes to his command over the instrument and proficiency in the &lt;em&gt;Raga&lt;/em&gt;s*.* But Sethumadhava Rao was the most senior in terms age and experience. Hence, I shall commence by narrating about him first.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;sethumadhava-rao&#34;&gt;Sethumadhava Rao&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Sethumadhava Rao belonged to the &lt;em&gt;Vaiṣṇava&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Deśastha&lt;/em&gt; Brahmin community. People spoke about his ancestors being affluent. Sethumadhava Rao was a serene and content person. By the time I had seen him, he was an elderly man whose age had crossed seventy. He had already lost his wife and sons. Hence, his boarding happened at a far of relative’s house and lodging elsewhere. He spent his time in the practice of violin, zestful chit chat and playing cards. Occasionally he would visit &lt;em&gt;Narasiṃha-tīrtha&lt;/em&gt; to get some Pūjā offered to deity. Every evening he would visit the &lt;em&gt;Prāṇa-deva (Hanūmān)&lt;/em&gt; temple. In his last days, people addressed him as Sethumadhava Dasa. Overall, a jovial being.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

It is neither the mother of music, not even in part.&#xA;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Music—just like poetry—has its origins in &lt;em&gt;pratibhā&lt;/em&gt; (talent, creativity, genius) and &lt;em&gt;kalpanā&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;pratibhā&lt;/em&gt; (creative imagination). This is akin to Tvaṣṭṛ, the creator, who gives shape and characteristics to all objects of the world, as described in the &lt;em&gt;Veda&lt;/em&gt;s. Similarly, &lt;em&gt;pratibhā&lt;/em&gt; is the power that gives shape and characteristics to the musical ingredients, &lt;em&gt;i.e.&lt;/em&gt; musical notes. This good fortune is obtained with the blessings of the divine or as a result of the good deeds done in the previous birth or by a combination of both. Of course, &lt;em&gt;sādhanā&lt;/em&gt; (rigorous practice) should be undertaken as a &lt;em&gt;tapas&lt;/em&gt; (penance, meditation, vow) in order to obtain the fruit of this good fortune.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

What should be mentioned first is that he may be counted as one among the noble people.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In Akkipete, we find the Sri Lakshminarayanaswamy temple. Beside this temple the Sri Lakshminarasimha Bhajana Mandira is situated. I have heard that a rich landlord residing in that area is the patron of the institute. Soorappa oversees the work of that Bhajana Mandira.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The number of people asking the question “&lt;em&gt;What do you get by listening to music?&lt;/em&gt;” is increasing. High-rise buildings have value. Silk clothes have value. Motor cars have value. Gold and precious stones have always had immense value. Liquor and food also have great value – among the wealthy folk. &lt;em&gt;Kāvya&lt;/em&gt; (poetry) and &lt;em&gt;Saṅgītā&lt;/em&gt; (music) are the ones that aren’t valued any more. If there’s a wedding in the house, it is customary for a few sounds to fill the ambience. &lt;em&gt;Kāvya-vācana&lt;a href=&#34;#_ftn2&#34;&gt;^(&lt;strong&gt;^([2])&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/em&gt; music, etc. are part of those sounds.
