My ugrakAmI tried to&#xA;ask tura~NgA what she was doing there but she ran away. svastrI tried&#xA;to chase her but even the pumAn have never beaten tura~NgA. The muni&#xA;knew this as me and the muni had one watched a long gone duShTa chase&#xA;tura~NgA and failed. I was intensely agitated by the display of&#xA;tura~NgA, but the young muni who had transcended the rasArNava was&#xA;unmoved. But svastrI was unusually alarmed of tura~NgA’s presence and&#xA;changed the venue. I started thinking of tura~NgA and saw the two&#xA;shakunas. I was puzzled as when I noticed them first but I still do not&#xA;understand them. But we still march ahead- for they all these shakunas&#xA;are only for traders and not true warriors.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

May manmatha be favorable to us.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;…..&lt;br&gt;&#xA;We faced an unexpected attack from the dasyus. We were initially put off but we realized that we would need a combination of rakShohA agni and the dhUrta patha again. May the dhUrta come to our aid and disperse the dasyus.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;kR^iNuShva pAjaH prasitiM na pR^ithvIM yAhi rAjevAmavAM ibhena |&lt;br&gt;&#xA;tR^iShvIm anu prasitiM drUNAno .astAsi vidhya rakShasas tapiShThaiH ||&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&#34;https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2005/04/20/the-last-stretch/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We stood at the last stretch of the passage. Hence, we wanted to comment&#xA;on somethings as they represent our very last comments in this phase of&#xA;existence. As we remarked before we do not know if we shall speak of the&#xA;face of the pishAchI. As our previous comments here, they shall be in&#xA;the saMdhyAbhASha with the same codes in place.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We marched to the edge of the great shmashAna. In the midst was seated&#xA;The god. He was khaDgarAvaNa, with 5 faces and a sword dripping in&#xA;blood. He was laughing awfully. vetAlas howled endlessly. I looked&#xA;around and I saw the corpses of Blackie, Horse-face, White beauty,&#xA;Sambhi, Palm-tree, Pygmy, Grey shudra, White shudrika, Yellow vaishyakA,&#xA;Black kikaTa, grAma maNDuka and bR^ihatsphig. Some were without heads,&#xA;some were without arms and of others only heads remained. There were&#xA;also those rAkshasas, namely dursachi, hrasvaroman, lambashiras,&#xA;kuTilaroman, ugrashmashru, viTshUla, puMshchalIpriya and sphigja who&#xA;were horribly howling and roaming around. There were the three fields&#xA;beside the shmashAna which were utterly empty- were one went in looking&#xA;for something and came back, usually losing what one had.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>On the pishAchis, rAkShasis, apasarAs and the vajrayoginI</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&#34;https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2005/04/19/on-the-pishachis-rakshasis-apasaras-and-the-vajrayogini/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We had in our long wanderings encountered many a pishAchi, rAkSasi and apsarA. What we were fated to have we knew not. We were locked in the embrace of the vajrayoginI. We sunk into the ultimate intoxication of her ApIna-vakshAbyaH and gazed at her urUbhyaH with our third eye which was open in midst of the kR^iShNa rAtrI, even as mahAkAla danced the tANDava on our shikhA. She split herself into three forms and provided us pleasure in the midst of the kAlarAtrI and the yuddhachakra. We now hold on to her before the uncovering of the pishAchi’s face hoping that she might possess the nagara-pishAchi herself.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The nice&#xA;weather before the return of vR^itra gave a brief respite. We enjoyed it&#xA;all- a good night of astronomy, a whole day of lolling around in the&#xA;spring sunshine, talking about all and sundry. We lived in the present&#xA;the worries of the past and the future, the dIrgha-jihvIs and their ilk&#xA;were all forgotten as though they never were- as though erased by the&#xA;intoxication of the mAdvIpAnas. We saw the laukIka revellers and&#xA;realized what had been termed by mAnasikA as the “inversion”. We then&#xA;returned to the station by the shmashAna and wound our way back to our&#xA;cave meditating on the slayer of hiraNyakashipu.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;————-&lt;br&gt;&#xA;The revolt of khANDava continued unabated. But we realized that the&#xA;destroyer of prahlAda, the demolisher of forts, the one with variegated&#xA;bow had remained on our side during the difficult conquest of khANDava.&#xA;As we studied the post-mortem intelligence reports on the assault we saw&#xA;how close we had been to defeat and we were happy to see that the&#xA;intricate defense plans had after all been successful in pulling off the&#xA;victory. However, now we face and even more complicated situation that&#xA;is probably going to be the real bang with no holds bared.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

All of us were there and performed well for these conditions. We also saw the inter-galactic wanderer globular cluster through the “Mars-man’s” scope.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The one who knows this rahasya and performs the invocation of&#xA;sumukhI along with the great dhUrtasvamI will be favored by them. That&#xA;glorious goddess sumukhI also called the great mahAmayUrI, engaged in&#xA;amorous dalliance with the dhUrta, is described as sulabhAgati. In the&#xA;midst of her yantra, the mate of kArttikeya is meditated as residing and&#xA;invoked with the mighty mantra (in mantra shAstra code):&lt;br&gt;&#xA;karNa ; sanayana dyuti; jarAsana svetesha ; lakShmI ; dirgha nandi ;&#xA;sadR^ik kriya ; samAdhava meSha ; karNo bhR^igu ; sendhikA tandrI ;&#xA;khidevi ma &amp;lt;svayamarupa&amp;gt; ; dIrgha viyat ; pishAchinI &amp;lt;svayamarupa&amp;gt; ;&#xA;himAdrijA ; sarginandajatritayaM.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

We saw Jx with the wheel spinning on his head. We asked him- hey&#xA;Jx how did you get that wheel on your head. And lo behold, the wheel&#xA;flew off his head and crashed on to mine.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;…&lt;br&gt;&#xA;It was like Holmes and Moriarty locked in that final encounter on the&#xA;cliff in Switzerland. One of them had to die– which one of them will it&#xA;be or may be both ?&lt;br&gt;&#xA;…&lt;br&gt;&#xA;The hirsute M won an amazing battle. It exactly like that of Jx. Still&#xA;his fate was sealed. There was no escape at the other end of the tunnel.&#xA;We only won khANDavaprastha, yet our fate was looking pretty damn&#xA;grim.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;…&lt;br&gt;&#xA;It looked as though the kR^ityA had hit her target — She was uprooting&#xA;everything in its path. One after the other our kavachas were failing.&#xA;We cannot even inform the muni of our fate !! We have been thus blocked&#xA;by the kR^ityA.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;…&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Definitely we had hit the nadir of our existence– or was there worse —&#xA;we were just amazed at the noose of fate– it drags you without you being&#xA;able to do anything right into naraka.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&#34;https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2005/04/01/what/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We have seen many things in life. But never have we seen something hit&#xA;us as overwhelming as this. There was revolt in khANDavaprastha. It&#xA;looked as though kumbhakarNa was standing there on the field and&#xA;marching steadily towards us. What ever astra we hurled at kumbhakarNa&#xA;simply broke to pieces and fell down. But kumbhakarNa, unaffected moved&#xA;on. It was terrifying to stand there and watch all our weapons crumble&#xA;like that as behemoth advanced towards us. Like arjuna saw the kaurava&#xA;warriors rushing head long into mouth of the all consuming viShNu we saw&#xA;everything we sent move into the mouth of kAla. We felt in real life&#xA;those fears we only had experienced in our dreams- those dreams in which&#xA;you go to the exam hall and miss the whole damn thing there- or the&#xA;nightmare from which you get up in a shock… Never did we realize the&#xA;stark fate of the muni’s words- our divya dR^iShTi now acted like that&#xA;of dR^itarAShTra’s in that moment when he saw the awful vishvarUpa. We&#xA;asked had we navigated the ocean this far with all the power of our&#xA;mantras only to be sent against this whirlpool. Will we be alive at the&#xA;other end of it? It was in such a situation with our bow broken and for&#xA;the first time all our astras blow away we humbly sought the refuge of&#xA;the hallowed feet of our great god shaNmukha.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
