## 1 INTRODUCTION

### The Bukkapattanam Śrīvaiṣṇavas

The Viśiṣṭādvaita system of philosophy which was given a form and direction by teachers like Nāthamuni and Yāmuna was firmly established by Śrī Rāmānuja through his monumental works like the *Vedārthasaṅgraha*, *Śrībhāṣya* and the *Gītābhāṣya*. The post-Rāmānuja period saw the emergence of giants of learning like Piḷḷai Lokācārya and Vedānta Deśika who strengthened the system further and made it formidable and streamlined. Several writers from different parts of the country added their own mite to the general renaissance and development of the system. The Telugu Country, for its own part, had given rise to many scholarly writers who, from time to time, reinforced the system by their dialectical works, silencing critics belonging to the Advaita and Dvaita traditions. Among such writers who lived in Andhra and contributed to the general renaissance and reinforcement of the Viśiṣṭādvaita system, mention should be made of the descendants of the Bukkappaṭṭanam family.

### The Surāpuram Chiefs

These writers were patronized by the chiefs of Surāpuram (Shorapur). This place lies between the rivers Kṛṣṇā and the Bhīmā at a short distance in the north from the Kṛṣṇā and in a south-westerly direction from Bijapur. At present it is in the Gulbarga District of the Nizam dominions. A Telugu Kaifiyat, *Surāpura Rājula Vaṃśāvali*¹ informs us that the family of the chiefs of Surapuram came to be called Kosalavaṃśa after their ancestor Kosalanātha. One of their old head-quarters in Mudugalasīmā was named Kosalapeṭa. This Kosalavaṃśa is [[P2]] referred to by the Bukkappaṭṭanam writers Annaya II and Śrīnivāsa II and others in their works. They call themselves the court-poets of and gurus of the Kosala Chief Veṅkaṭa who was the twenty-second ruler of Surāpuram. Annaya II and Śrīnivāsa II were brought to Bukkappaṭṭanam by one Pāmi Nāyaka. The Bukkappaṭṭanam writers also refer to themselves as belonging to the Śrīśaila or Tirumala Bukkappaṭṭaṇa family. Telugu was their mother-tongue.

### Important writers of the Bukkapattanam family

Among the many writers who were born in this family, mention may be made of Śrīnivāsa II, Annaya Dīkṣita, Kirīṭi Veṅkaṭācārya and Bucci Veṅkaṭācārya. Śrīnivāsācārya II is the most prolific writer of this family with about eighteen works to his credit, covering various branches of learning. In his work called the *Virodha-varūthinī-pramathinī* he states that he hails from the Śrīśaila (Tirumala) Bukkappaṭṭanam family. In this [[P3]] work he gives his father's name as 'Śrīnidhi' Tātārya. 'Śrī-nidhi' is same as 'Śrī-nivāsa'. He also refers to one Narasiṃha Tātārya who must have been Tātārya's (his father's) brother. Before going into further details of the parentage and works of our author, it is but proper to learn about the royal family of Surāpuram which patronised these writers. Some of these writers were 'Rājagurus'.

### Surāpuram in history

It appears that all these writers made Surāpuram their head-quarters although they originally belonged to Bukkappaṭṭanam, which is a village in the Jammalamadugu Taluq in the Cuddapah District of Andhra Pradesh. One of the descendants of this family, Veṅkaṭācārya III states in his work *Śṛṅgāra-taraṅgiṇī* that the presiding deity at Surāpuram is Lord Kṛṣṇa, and that he was the preceptor of the ruler Veṅkaṭa, son [[P4]] of Pāmi who bore the title *Bahiri*². It appears that our writers were the spiritual preceptors of the chiefs who ruled Surāpuram from time to time and who embraced the Śrīvaiṣṇava faith. The title *Bahirī* which Veṅkaṭa, the son of Pāmi Nāyaka had, has its own history. One of the Kosala Chiefs, Cinna Hanmi Nāyaka, defeated one 'Bahiri' Vasanta Rao who was a Desai at Mudugal, and a minister under the Bijapur Sultan. As a mark of his victory over Vasanta Rao, Hanmi Nāyaka got the title 'Bahiri'. This became the common title for all the successors of Hanmi Nāyaka.

The Telugu Kaifiyat³ further points out that Surāpuram was founded in the year 1713 A.D. by Pāmi Nāyaka who was the son of Peda Nāyaka. Pāmi Nāyaka passed away in 1740 A.D. and he was succeeded by his son Peda Nāyaka. Peda Nāyaka ruled for five years and died issueless in the year 1745 [[P5]] A.D. He was succeeded by his younger brother Muṇḍigai Veṅkaṭappa who also died issueless in 1751 A.D. Just before his demise, he called Pāmi, one of his cousins and asked him to take care of the Estate after his death. It was thus that Pāmi became the ruler of the Surāpuram Saṃsthānam after Veṅkaṭappa's death.⁴ The Telugu *Kaifiyat* further notes that the Surāpuram chiefs trace their origin to Guha the hunter-chief who was a devotee and friend of Śrī Rāma of the Tretā Yuga. According to this *Kaifiyat* Pāmi Nāyaka who stayed at Sahāpuram and ruled for ten years from 1678 to 1688 wanted to take Śrīvaiṣṇava Dīkṣā. For this purpose he approached Śaṅkhavanam Śrīnivāsācārya of Ānegoṇḍi and received the Mudrās from him.

Pāmi Nāyaka who succeeded Veṅkaṭappa in the year 1752 A.D., wanted to have a similar initiation into [[P6]] Śrīvaiṣṇavism. But only a boy named Śrīnivāsa belonging to the Śaṅkhavanam family was alive by that time, who did not even have his Upanayana. Therefore Pāmi approached an Ācārya from Bukkappaṭṭanam for initiation. Bukkappaṭṭaṇam lies in the Auku-sīmā near Gutti, south of the river Tuṅgabhadrā. The name of this Ācārya is given as Annaya, who had also a brother by name Cinnaya. These two brothers thus moved from Bukkappaṭṭanam to Surāpuram and this took place probably between the years 1760 and 1766.

The *Kaifiyat* further states that the Maratha Rulers subjugated this part of the country around this time, and collected tributes from the Surāpuram chiefs. Pāmi Nāyaka died in 1773 A.D. He had a son by name Veṅkaṭa and he passed away in 1802 A.D., after ruling the territory for twenty years. The authors Veṅkaṭācārya II, Annayācārya II, Śrīnivāsācārya II and Veṅkaṭācārya III (also called Ayyā [[P7]] Veṅkaṭācārya and Kirīṭi Veṅkaṭācārya) and Veṅkaṭācārya IV also known as Bucci Veṅkaṭācārya, the author of the popular Viśiṣṭādvaita manual, *Vedānta Kārikāvali* may all be assigned to a period between 1725 A.D. and 1825 A.D.

A list of works was supplied to the New Catalogus Catalogorum Office of the University of Madras in the year 1936 by one Tirumala Bukkappaṭṭanam Jātakavidvanmaṇi Veṅkaṭācārya, who stayed at Amaracinta. This town comes in Ātmakūr Saṃsthānam of the Nizam's Dominions. This list mentions seven authors of this family: Śrīnivāsa, Annaya Dīkṣita, Kirīṭi Veṅkaṭācārya, Annaya (II), Bucci Veṅkaṭācārya, Raṅgācārya and Śrīnivāsācārya. Raṅgācārya wrote four works and the last mentioned author, nineteen works. Of these nineteen, one work describes the World War I (1914-18) through which the author appears to have been a modern writer. However, his works are not available. Fortunately for us, the [[P8]] works written by the Bukkappaṭṭanam authors contain some biographical data with the help of which one may draw their family tree.

Among the three brothers Veṅkaṭācārya II, Annayācārya II [[P9]] and Śrīnivāsācārya II, the eldest one mentions one Veṅkaṭa Deśika as his Guru. But nothing is known about this teacher. Annayācārya II and Śrīnivāsa II[^5] refer frequently to Kauṇḍinya Śrīnivāsa as their preceptor. The *Rasikajanarasollāsa Bhāṇa*[^6] of one Veṅkaṭa gives the following genealogy of this preceptor:

*   **Kauṇḍinya Gotra** (Family at Kāmasamudram village)
  *   **Ahobilācārya**
    *   *Sons:*
      *   **Ācārya Dīkṣita** (1st Son)
      *   **Sampadācārya** (2nd Son)
        *   *Son:*
          *   **Vedāntācārya**
            *   (Wife: Akkamāmbā)
            *   *Son:*
              *   **Veṅkaṭa** (Author of *Rasikajanarasollāsa*)

Veṅkaṭa informs that he had his Mantropadeśa from one Śrīnivāsādhvarin and studied under Śrīnivāsācārya (II) who was [[P10]] the younger brother of Annayācārya (II). Śrīnivāsa II in his *Tattva-mārtāṇḍa*[^7] mentions one Ācārya Dīkṣita as the guru of his seniormost paternal uncle Jayavara. Towards the end of his *Nītiśataka*⁸ he tells us that he was the son of Śrīnivāsa Tātārya (*Kamalānivāsa-tātārya-sūnuḥ*) and brother of Annayārya (*Annayārya-sahajaḥ*) and that he had been blessed by Ācārya Dīkṣita (*ācāryadīkṣita-kaṭākṣa-dhanī*). We may now identify this Ācārya Dīkṣita with the person of the same name mentioned in the *Rasikajanarasollāsa Bhāṇa* as the elder brother of the author Veṅkaṭa's grandfather, Sampadācārya. Śrīnivāsādhvarin mentioned by Veṅkaṭa as the one who gave him Mantropadeśa might, in all probability, be the same as Kauṇḍinya Śrīnivāsādhvarin who was the guru of both Annaya II and Śrīnivāsa II. But the exact relation Kauṇḍinya Śrīnivāsa had with the author of the *Bhāṇa* is not quite evident. [[P11]]
