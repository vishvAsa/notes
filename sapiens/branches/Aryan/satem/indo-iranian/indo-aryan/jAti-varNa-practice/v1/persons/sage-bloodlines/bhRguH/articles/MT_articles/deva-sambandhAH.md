As an aside the bhR^igu-s have an ambivalent relationship viShNu as with the other daiva traditions: 

1. bhR^igu's wife is beheaded by viShNu; 
2. bhR^igu kicking viShNu; 
3. bhArgava kAvya fighting viShNu before being crushed/blinded by him (also by rudra). 
4. bhArgava-s headed by chyavAna attacking indra. 
5. indra shattering dadhya~nch's head. etc.

But on the other hand they also figure in pro-viShNu roles like rAma bhArgava.
