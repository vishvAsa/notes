Life and Writings of Śrī Vedāntadeśika

Śrī Venkaṭanātha or Vedāntadeśika, to use the name by which he is more commonly known, was born at Thooppil, a village near Kañcīpuram, in 1268. His father was called Anantasūri and his mother Totaramba. His maternal uncle was the renowned Appullār, whose real name was Rāmānuja. It is under him that Vedāntadeśika learnt the Śāstras. Appullār had studied Vedānta under Nadathur Ammāḷ (Varadācārya) along with Sudarsana Bhatta, the author of Śrutaprakāśikā, the splendid commentary on Rāmānuja's Śrī Bhāṣya. Appullār was the great-grandson of Praṇatārtihara, the disciple of Śrī Rāmānuja, who was called Vedānta Udayana for his proficiency in Vedānta. He had, there. fore, personal knowledge of Rāmānuja's religious teaching and tradition,

Vedāntadeśika seems to have attracted the notice of Nadathur Ammāḷ by his precociousness. Before the age of twenty, he bad acquired a mastery of all the learning current in his days not only in religion but in secular subjects as well. He states that his uncle, Appullār, taught him with as much patience and care as a man would teach a parrot to speak. Vedāntadeśika became so proficient in the composition of poetry and in the mastery of the science of logic that be came to be called Kavi Tārkika Simha (the lion among poets and logicians).

Three holy places are associated with Vedāntadeśika's name as having been his residences. One is Tiruvahīndrapuram in South Arcot District, where, it may be presumed, he composed some of his well-known Stotras or hymns like Gopāla Viṁśati and Devanāyaka Pañcāśat in Sanskrit and Achyuta śatakam in Prakrit. He lived for many years at Kañcīpuram. It is on the chief deity in Kañcīpuram that deśika composed his Varadarāja Pañcāśat in Sanskrit and his Attigiri Mānmiyam in Tamil.

Śrīraṅgam was, then, the centre of Vaiśṇavite culture and learning and every one who had pretensions to a knowledge of Viśiṣṭādvaitic philosophy and religion made it a point to stay there as long as he could. Vedāntadeśika seems to have spent some years of his life at Śrīraṅgam, gathering round him a band of disciples who were greatly devoted to him. He says somewhere that he had taught Vedānta (i. e.) Śrī Bhāśya, thirty times over. He wrote also many treatises in Sanskrit and in Tamil in support of the Vedāntic system of Rāmānuja and in refutation of rival systems. It is no wonder that the title of Vedāntadeśika (or Vedāntācārya) was conferred on him, as he himself says, by the Lord Śrī Ranganātha.

Vedāntadeśika, or deśika, to use the shorter name by which also he is often referred to, followed the usual custom of going on pilgrimages to places in North India which are considered holy. It was probably at Tirupati that he composed his Stotra called Dayāśatakam. It is said that he visited also Mathura, Brindavan, Ayodhya and Banaras.

Deśika chose to live a life of poverty. He would not seek the patronage of the great as it might lead to a loss of independence. It is said that the great Vidyāraṇya invited him to the court of Vijayanagar assuring him of an honourable reception. But Vedānta deśika would not consent. His reply to Vidyāraṇya called Vairāgyapañcakam, which is in the form of five ślokas in Sanskrit, reveals his stern and austere independence of spirit.

By his extraordinary learning and exemplary way of life, Vedāntadeśika won the admiration and reverence of all those who were spiritually-minded. Like Rāmānuja before him, he was blessed with a long life of strenuous, spiritual activity and died in his one-hundredth year (1369).

## HIS WORKS
Śrī Vedāntadeśika's life was dedicated solely to study, to teaching and to the composition of books and tracts. He is a voluminous and versatile writer who has left works in Sanskrit and Tamil, in prose and in verse, and also in maṇipravālam, a kind of Sanskritized Tamil. The number of his writings would come to a hundred or more and only the more important of them are briefly mentioned below.

Vedāntadeśika reminds one of the English post Milton. It is well-known that Milton was a scholar in Greek, Latin and Italian, besides his own language, English. His poetry was the poetry of a scholar steeped in varied learning and a full and critical appreciation of his poems and prose writings is possible only to men of learning. With just a few exceptions, all the poems of Milton are on religious themes, as he had a lofty conception of the poet's art and mission and would not care to dally in secular writing. He wrote a drama taking his subject from the Old Testament of the Bible. Milton wrote extensively in prose also, both in Eoglish and in Latin. He was also noted for the austerity of his life, the earnestness of his religious convictions, and the stubborn independence of his character.

Śrī Vedāntadeśika's works may be classified ander the following heads

### SANSKRIT
#### 1. POETRY AND THE DRAMA :

Though deśika was wholly absorbed in the study and the interpretation of Vedānta and of the religious tradition associated with Śrī Rāmanuja, he had in him a genius for poetic composition which could not be repressed. So, instead of writing on secular subjects, he made his base the handmaid of religion. With the single exception of Subhashita-neevi, which is a didactic poem containing gnomic verses like the śatakas of Bhartṛhari, all his poems have a religious background.

When he wanted to write a Mahākāvya like Raghuvamśa, he chose for his theme Śrī Kṛṣṇa's life and composed his Yādavābhyudayam in twenty-four cantos (or sargas), The playful activities of ŚrīKṛṣṇa in his boyhood and youth lend themselves easily to poetic delight. It is deśika's peculiar feature as a poet to incorporate philosophical and religious ideas even into his poems. The great Advaitic teacber, Śrī Appayya Dikṣitar, has written a commentary on this Mahākāvya.

Deśika was an admirer of Kālidāsa's genius as a poet and wrote a Sandeśa Kāvya following his manner. This is Haṁsa Sandeśa. Śrī Rāma sends a message by a swan to Sītādevī at Laṅkā where she has been imprisoned by Rāvaṇa. The first part consisting of sixty ślokas describes the route that the swan should take in its journey to Laṅkā. The religious bias of the poet makes him speak with reverence of the holy places and shrines of South India on this route. In the second part consisting of fifty ślokas Śrī Rāma gives a description of the state of Sita in Laṅkā as he visualises it in his imagination and this is followed by the message which is to give her comfort and consolation. The poem is written in the metre called Mandākrāntā which Kalidasa had employed with brilliant success in his Meghasandeśa.

Pādukāsahasram is a poetical tour de force said to have been composed in the course of a single night. The theme is the sandals of Śrī Raṅganātha at Śrīraṅgam and the poem has one thousand and eight ślokas in varied metres and is partly in praise of Śrī Rāma's sandals which were taken by Bharata to Ayodhya and which are identified with Śrī Raṅganātha's.

##### THE DRAMA

Kr̥ṣṇamiśra, a gifted poet, wrote an allegorical drama called Prabodhacandrodaya on the Advaita Philosophy, wherein Prabodhacandra or Jñāna brings about the deliverance of King Viveka from the bondage of saṁsāra into which he had been forced by his enemies, Lust, Anger, and the like. In reply, as it were, to this play, deśika wrote an allegorical drama called Saṅkalpa Sūryodaya in ten acts. The war is between two sets of combatants, Viveka, Bhakti, and Spiritual Serenity (Śānti) on one side and Lust, Pride, Vanity and the like on the other. The hero is Puruṣa or the Jīva and the final deliverance of Puruṣa is brought about by the victory of Viveka over Moha with the help of Viṣṇu bhakti.

#### 2. RELIGIOUS LYRICS (STOTRAS):

Vedāntadeśika has left a number of religious lyrics or Stotras which have won the admiration of Śrī Vaiṣṇavas so much that they are often repeated with great devotion during their gatherings. These Stotras or religious lyrics are mainly on the gods worshipped in Kañcīpuram, Śrīraṅgam, Tirupati and Tiruvahīndrapuram. Some of them are on Garuḍa, the Goddess Lakṣmī, the Goddess of the Earth and Goda the saintly daughter of Periāḻvār.

Deśika is said to have been an upāsaka of Bhagavān as Hayagrīva and has composed thirty-three ślokas in His praise.

The ten avatārs of Viṣṇu are described in ten ślokas called Daśavatāra-stotram. After the Muslim raids in the 14th century, deśika composed his Abhīti-stava, praying for succour to Śrī Raṅganātha's shrine and worshippers, Dayāśatakam consists of about one hundred ślokas on the Lord of Tirupati and on His mercy shown to the Jīva in varied ways.

Varadarāja-pañcāśat, referred to before, has fifty-one ślokas in praise of Śrī Varadarāja of Kañcīpuram.

Deśika was, for some years, a resident at Tiruvahīndrapuram wbere he was a staunch devotee of the god Devanātha, in whose praise he composed fifty three ślokas called Devanāyakapañcaśat.

Deśika was a profound admirer of Śrī Rāmānuja whose works he studied again and again with reverance and also taught to others. In Yatirāja-saptati, he has expressed his boundless admiration and reverence and also his indebtedness to Śrī Rāmānuja. The poem has seventy ślokas.

One of the finest of these lyrics is Gopālaviṁśati on Śrī Kr̥ṣṇa. Deśika's poetic style is generally that of a scholar and is not easily understood by the ordinary reader. But in Gopāla viṁśati, his deep and fervent devotion has enabled him to visualise Śrī Kṛṣṇa and sing his praise in ślokas which are lucid and delightful and can be understood even by the beginner of Sanskrit studies.

#### 3. Vedānta.

It is in the discussion of subjects connected with Vedānta that Vedāntadeśika excelled. He had studied the philosophical writings of Śrī Saṅkarācārya and others and was a master, as has already been stated, of Viśiṣṭādvaita as taught by Śrī Rāmanuja. He dedicated his life, it may be said without any exaggeration, to the propagation of Rāmānuja's gospel by all the means in his power. Being a subtle logician, be refuted rival systems of philosophical thought in many of his writings and established the soundness of Viśiṣṭādvaita from the point of view of Śrutis and of reason.

Tattvaṭīkā : Śrī deśika began an elaborate commentary on Śrī Bhāśyam but left it incomplete. It is only the commentary up to the section dealing with the Mahasiddhānta that is now available.

Adhikaraṇasārāvalī is in 502 ślokas and is a synopsis of Śrī Bhāśyam. Deśika had a wonderful gift of expressing philosophical ideas concisely in Sanskrit verse giving the pūrvapakṣa and the Siddhānta in each śloka. In this work which is in the metre called Sragdharā Deśika summarises the meaning of each sūtra and of each adhikaraṇa or section of Śrī Rāmanuja's commentary on the Brahma Sūtras giving, as a general rule, the prima facie view in the first half of each śloka and the right interpretation of the adhikaraṇa or siddhānta in the second half.


Tatvamuktākalapā is a controversial work in Sanskrit verse, and consists of 501 ślokas. The Viśiṣṭādvaita philosophy is sought to be established as the only right system by a refutation of rival views or theories. Here again, the first half of each śloka expresses the pūrvapakṣa stating concisely the tenets of other systems and the second the siddhānta in connection with such topics as the Jaḍa or non-sentient things, the Jīva, the Nāyaka or Īśvara and buddhi, which are all dravya or substances and also adravya, those which are not substances. Deśika has left also a commentary of, his own on this work called Sarvārthasiddhi.

Śatadūṣaṇī is a controversial treatise in terse prose against Advaita. Deśika finds a hundred points of objection against Advaita, but only sixty-six of them are extant in the texts that are now available.

Nyāya Pariśuddhi and Nyāya siddhāñjanam are treatises of logic or nyāya as it should be understood. They are both critical of the Vaiśeṣika and Nyāya schools of logic.

Seśvara-mīmāṁsā : It is generally held that Jaiminī, the author of the Pūrva Mīmāmsā Sūtras, was an agnostic who had no faith in the existence of God or Gods. In this work Deśika's aim is to prove that Jaiminī did believe in the existence of gods. Only a fragment of this treatise is, at present, available.

Nyāsa - viṁśati. Nikṣeparakṣā, Nyāsa-tilaka, Saraṇāgati pañcāśat, and Nyāsa daśaka aim at establishing Prapatti as an upāya for mokṣa by refuting the arguments of those who hold that bhakti alone is prescribed in the Śāstras as the means for attaining it. They describe also the manner of performing prapatti and the potency of the upāya along with the qualifications which make one competent for it.

#### 4. COMMENTARIES :

Deśika has left commentaries on Iśāvāsyopaniṣad, on Aḷavandār's Catuśślokī and his Stotra-ratnam, and on the three prose works of Śrī Rāmānuja, namely, Śaraṇāgati gadyam, Śrīraṅga gadyam and Vaikuṇṭha gadyam.

Tātparya candrikā is a scholarly commentary on Śrī Rāmanuja's Gitā bhāṣyam. The author shows how Śrī Rāmānuja's interpretation of the verses of the Gita is more apt and more in accordance with reason than that of other commentators.

### TAMIL

Deśika has composed many treatises in Tamil, most of them being in verse. Among the verse compositions are Attigiri-Mānmiyan aleady referred to and Muomanikkovai which is on Śrī Devanātha of Tiruvahīndrapuram.

Paramatabhangam expounds, in Tamil verse and in highly Sanskritised Tamil prose, the doctrines of Viśiṣṭādvaita and refutes some sixteen rival systems. It is also in support of the pāñcarātra Āgamas and describes Śaraṇāgati as an upāya.

#### Rahasyatrayasāra
Śrīmad Rahasyatrayasāra is, of course, one of his greatest prose works. The Tamil prose in this work, as in others, has a large admixture of sanskrit words.

Deśika has left also a large number of tracts on the proper code of conduct and observances that a good Śrī Vaiṣṇava should follow and likewise on the doctrines of Viśiṣṭādvaita.
