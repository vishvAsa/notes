      <description>&lt;p&gt;Brāḥmaṇa by Rabindranath Tagore&lt;br&gt;&#xA;from the anthology Bhāratavarṣa.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Translated into English by Sreejit Datta&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Everyone knows that recently [c. 1902 – translator] one Marathi Brahmin was beaten up with a shoe by his English employer; the matter was taken to the highest court for hearing – finally, the judge has dismissed the matter as trifle.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The incident is so shameful that we had decided not to mention it in our monthly magazine. Having been beaten up by another, whether one should retaliate or cry or complain – the papers have carried out all such tittle-tattle; we don’t intend to bring up such discussions either. However, it is time we express certain matters deserving of serious consideration that have occurred to us.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&#34;https://pragyata.com/indias-history-part-i-by-rabindranath-tagore/&#34;&gt;TW&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;details&gt;&lt;summary&gt;विस्तारः (द्रष्टुं नोद्यम्)&lt;/summary&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is an English translation of the essay “Bharatbarsher Itihas” by Rabindranath Tagore, to be found in his anthology of Bengali essays entitled “Bharatavarsha”. The anthology contains several of Rabindranath’s longish essays concerning historical, cultural, and political dimensions of India, all written between 1901 and 1905, a period which can be described as the zenith of Bengal’s (and in turn, India’s) rebirth in the Modern Era. Each of these essays, though deeply embedded within the historical context of the author’s time and space, is largely relevant for all of India today.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
