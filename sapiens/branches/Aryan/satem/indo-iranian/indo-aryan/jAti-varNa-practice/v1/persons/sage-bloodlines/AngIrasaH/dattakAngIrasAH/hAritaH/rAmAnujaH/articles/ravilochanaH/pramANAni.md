## यतिराजवैभवम्
Among the hagiographical/biographical texts which may be considered as possibly written by someone who was a contemporary of Sri Ramanuja, only Yatiraja Vaibhavam by Andhra Purna seems to pass the test. 

Divyasuri Caritam is a much later work - last chapter makes it clear. Venkatachala Itihasa Mala is also a later work. The appointment of Satakopa Jiyars in Tirumala is attributed to Sri Ramanuja in the work. But the Jiyars and mathams were established only in 14th century as is clear from inscriptions. VIM and DSC mentioned above have to be discarded as primary texts of evidence. Yatiraja Vaibhavam alone should be taken seriously by those interested in history.

### kRmikaNTha vs govindarAja-remover
From Kulottunga Colan ula, we come to know that Kulottunga II desecrated Govindaraja shrine before starting his major renovation work in Chidambaram. His inscriptions show that his renovations were begun by 1333-36 CE. (Venkatesa Itihasa Mala places it very early in Ramanuja's life. This is another piece of evidence against the text being a contemporary work.) 

OTOH, Yatiraja Vaibhavam alone places it towards the end of Ramanuja's life - as an act made much after his return from Karnataka.

Earliest acharyas did not connect Krimikantha with Kulottunga II - So, claiming that Krimikantha who blinded Kuresa was same as Kulottunga II is also baseless. Rather, former seems to be some local rebel who tried to become emperor before Kulottunga I but lost. This Kulottunga's grandson is the one who removed Govindaraja. While early acharyas refused to say his name (instead using term avyapadesa - 'he who shall not be named' :)), they did not call him krimikantha either - which was the title used for the person who blinded Kuresa and Nambi. Hence, the two are different. This is made clear only by one hagiography - Yatiraja Vaibhavam of Vaduga nambi aka Andhra Purna. 

### Delhi statue revovery
Back to Yatiraja Vaibhavam. The only anachronistic thing that can be claimed abt it - is that it refers to Ramanuja bringing from Ramapriya murti from Delhi. These days, it is said that he brought the murti back from a Sultan's palace & that his daughter merged with the Lord. There was no sultan in Delhi at that time. And despite what some may want to argue, there is no evidence for any M incursion into Karnataka from Islamic states during the 11th century. But once again, YV proves to be very different compared to other texts. YV doesn't say that the ruler of Delhi was a Muslim or a Mleccha. It simply says ruler of Delhi. None of the other early texts claim that the ruler was a Muslim either. This opinion seems to have cropped up in later era when Delhi became Sultanate iconoclasts' capital

## Earliest inscriptions

### viShNuvardhana 1111
There is an inscription of Vishnuvardhana in srirangam belonging to the year 1111 ce which matches with the return of ramanuja from melkote after 12 yrs (his entry in melkote was in 1098 as per traditional claims).

rAmAnuja was extremely old during exile (81-93 years).
</details>



Belur temple inscription shows that the temple was built in 1117ce or so.

All this supports the date of ramanuja and his exile into karntaka prior to 1133ce.


### Kodai Ravivarman 1156
Earliest clear reference to Sri Ramanuja in an epigraph comes from inscription dated 19th Nov 1156 CE in Srirangam temple. A Southern Kerala ruler, Kodai Ravivarman had offered lamp and camphor to the Lord as per orders of Emperumanar (a title of Sri Ramanuja). Per tradition, Ramanuja attained paramapada in 1137 CE. 

While the inscription says that the offering is as per Ramanuja's orders, it doesn't necessarily refer to him as alive during that year. Rather the words seem to indicate past order being given effect.  
Also, the inscription merely says that he fulfilled an order/advice/wish of ramanuja. Iirc, the words are emperumananar thiru-ullappadi.. or something like that.  
It is also possible that it was his wish and the venad ruler came to know about it during his visit in 1156 when he fulfilled it. (Venad was not exactly on good terms with cholas and it is not easy to do this when the diplomatic relations are not so good.)

(Quite interesting fact is that this offering was made by Venad (Southern Kerala) ruler whose descendants are the current Travancore Royal family.) 

#### Ilaiyazhvaan in toNDanUr
The only possible earlier reference to Ramanuja is from Tondanur (Kere Tonnur) in Karnataka. The epigraphy is in 12th century characters and refers to the donee being a sishya of Ilaiyazhvaan (a Tamil Sri Vaishnava word for Ramanuja/Lakshmana). Name of the year is lost due to time but we can read that the tithi was amavasya with Anuradha star on Thursday. Amavasya in Anuradha can happen in Tamil months of Karthigai-Margazhi-Thai. 

### toNNur 1135?
There is another inscription of 1135 CE referring to a Tamil couple offering donations in Tonnur in Margazhi month. It is seen that Amavasya of Margazhi in that year does match the inscription. 5th Dec 1135 - Margazhi Amavasya with Anuradha star and Thursday. If this is indeed the date of the inscription, then it might be the earliest datable reference to Sri Ramanuja in an epigraph. But the lack of year name or number is a problem.

## Indologist speculation
> The traditional date of Rāmānuja’s death, 1137 CE, is now widely regarded - see Carman \(1974: 27\) and Young \(2007: 236\) - as 30 or 40 years too early.

30-40 yrs too early is just a 'subjective' opinion unsubstantiated by anything solid.

The only claim that they to 'establish' a later date for ramanuja is an inscription in srirangam from 1155/56 ce where it is mentioned that a venad ruler gave a golden lamp to srirangam temple as per the advice of emperumanar. Some indologists take it to mean that ramanuja was alive at that time.

Which they substantiate with a 15th century guruparampara text which gives the year of completion of sribhashyam as 1156 or so. Now, this GP text has several other errors in dates (including major errors like year name and saka year number not matching - missing by a decade or so). So the GP text written four centuries later cannot be taken seriously.

The inscription itself doesn't say that ramanuja was alive at the time. It could as well be a reference to an older order/advice. Otoh the dates of Belur inscription, srirangam inscription as well as inscription from 1135 ce which refers to Ramanuja in Karnataka disproves all these attempts to date ramanujas birth to 1100ce



## On Nagaswamy's work
Nagasamy has made many omissions and commissions in his life. His work on Ramanuja is a combo of both. As for Nagasamy's lack of objectivity one just has to see how he treats the requirements of epigraphs wrt Ramanuja vis a vis Sankara.

Of course, he had also stated that Ramanuja was alive in 1156 CE based on a Srirangam epigraph. If accepted, then one can argue that Kulottunga II & Krimikanta are one. I don't agree with such a view either.

### Kulottunga II & Krimikanta
Vishnuvardhana was in Srirangam in 1111CE (12 yrs after Ramanuja entered Melkote) - which coincides with Ramanuja's return to the holy town. So Kulottunga II +++(being later)+++ & Krimikantha are not one.

That Kulottunga II removed Govindaraja from Srirangam is attested by his court poet.  
Kuresa confirms persecution of Ramanuja in his work.

Finally, some persecution of Vaishnavas by Kulottunga II is indirectly confirmed by his son whose meikeerthi says that he uplifted the Vaishnava faith which had fallen. Said son was also a Shaiva by faith. But he stopped persecution of Vaishnavas as per near contemporary texts which is confirmed by this meikeerthi as well.


## Ramanuja and viShNuvardhana
As per tradition, Ramanuja's disciple Mudaliyandan/Dasarathi was appointed by the Acharya to consecrate the Panchanarayanas established by Vishnuvardhana. Belur Chennakesava was consecrated on 10th Mar 1117 CE - on caitra sukla pancami tithi. Date is given in an inscription of Vishnuvardhana - see Epigraphia Carnatica Vol 5 Page 134 (Belur inscription no.58). Vishnuvardhana's inscription is found in Srirangam temple dated to 1111CE (12 years after Ramanuja's entry into Melukote) as per tradition.

We know that Ramanuja most probably left Srirangam ca.1070 CE. The belief that he spent 12 yrs in Hoysala kingdom seems to be based on the Melukote period of stay mentioned above. A 12 yr stint in Melukote being wrongly considered as entire period of stay in later texts. Some try to shift the entire period of Ramanuja's visit to Karnataka by several decades later (post 1135 CE) to match it with Kulottunga II's reign in Chola desha. But such attempts miss the clear indications given by Vishnuvardhana's inscriptions.

Srirangam inscription also holds 1111 CE as 15th year of Vishnuvardhana's reign. So, he must have been co-ruler or heir apparent or at least ruler of a portion of the Hoysala territory from 1096 CE. This confirms story about VV being ruler when Ramanuja reached Melkote. Presuming that VV accompanied Ramanuja on his trip back to Srirangam in 1111CE after 12 yrs in Melkote - Ramanuja seems to have visited Karnataka again in 1117CE for the consecration of Pancanarayana temples. Perhaps a short visit - Yatiraja Vaibhavam is silent about this visit.

## pANDyan connection
It is known that a Pandya Manabharana was a sishya of Nanjiyar - a Sri Vaishnava acharya who lived in later half of 12th century.
