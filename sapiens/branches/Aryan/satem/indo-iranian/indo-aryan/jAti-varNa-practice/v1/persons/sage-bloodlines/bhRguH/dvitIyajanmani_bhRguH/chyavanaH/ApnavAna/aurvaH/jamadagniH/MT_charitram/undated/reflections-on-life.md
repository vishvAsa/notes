Imagine the course of a Lactobacillus -- you chance into a luxuriant pail of milk -- turn it into curds -- get consumed by someone & travel through their gut -- some copies get to colonize it -- bang you are out in the toilet flushed along with a host of other bacteria into the hostile world of the sewer -- conflict & uncertainty prevail -- more likely you are dead by phage than landing in another milk pail or animal gut. But you may rest in peace that some of your twins are still enjoying the milk or the gut. In some ways that's human life too.
