## Lactobacillus
Imagine the course of a Lactobacillus -- you chance into a luxuriant pail of milk -- turn it into curds -- get consumed by someone & travel through their gut -- some copies get to colonize it -- bang you are out in the toilet flushed along with a host of other bacteria into the hostile world of the sewer -- conflict & uncertainty prevail -- more likely you are dead by phage than landing in another milk pail or animal gut. But you may rest in peace that some of your twins are still enjoying the milk or the gut. In some ways that's human life too.

## Greatness as curvature
The perception of the greatness of others is like the perception of curvature. If it is a small or medium-sized object relative to ourselves, we can see its curvature. We can say if it's big or a small sphere. However, if it is too large, like the earth on which we are standing, we don't see its curvature. Likewise, if the greatness of a man is too vast relative to our own, we simply fail to perceive it.

There are some things a man can enjoy by himself early in life, but as he ages, he needs another person to share the experience to really enjoy them. But often, when he has an abundance of the object of enjoyment, he does not have the person in whose company he can derive that pleasure.
