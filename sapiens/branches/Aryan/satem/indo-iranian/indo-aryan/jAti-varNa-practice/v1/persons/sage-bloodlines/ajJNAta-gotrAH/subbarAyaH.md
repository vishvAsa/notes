Dr. T. S. Subbaraya was a brilliant student, teacher and an excellent individual. Born on 10.10.1905 (his parents were Pandit T N Subbaraya Shastry, a Kannada and Sanskrit scholar who taught Vidwat classes in Maharaja’s College, Mysore, and Kaveramma, a self-effacing and god-fearing housewife), he had an excellent academic record and became an erudite professor of physics in Central College, Bangalore. For some time he was also the Principal of the First Grade College at Tumkur. A synopsis of his bio-data is provided on the following page.

He obtained the DSc degree of the Mysore University in 1944 based on the research he had undertaken in spectroscopy in the Central College. The referees for the doctoral thesis were none other than Prof.  C V Raman, Nobel Laureate, and Prof. Megnadh Saha, Fellow of the Royal Society.  His passion was for physics and, in fact, for all of science. In spite of securing a high rank in the Mysore Civil Service examinations (which would have earned him excellent administrative posts), he opted for teaching and joined the Central College. He became proficient in German and French languages and learnt for himself mathematical physics (vectors, dyadics and tensors, relativity theory and quantum mechanics) which he could impart to the students of Honours and MSc classes.

After retirement as an emeritus professor, he chose to write an English-Kannada dictionary during 1968 to 1971 (20/6/1960 to 9/4/1971), using the Oxford English Dictionary as the starting point.  His idea for compiling the dictionary was mainly with the view to disseminate his mastery in English, Kannada and Sanskrit languages.

For a variety of reasons, the original manuscript (numbering 1578 foolscap pages and written in his own closely-written handwriting) could not be printed or published when he was alive. However, over the past few years, the source material was converted into electronic form using software tools, and the dictionary is now printed in both PDF and HTML formats. It is our fond hope that the material will prove useful, even four decades after its compilation, to scholars and teachers writing textbooks in Kannada.
