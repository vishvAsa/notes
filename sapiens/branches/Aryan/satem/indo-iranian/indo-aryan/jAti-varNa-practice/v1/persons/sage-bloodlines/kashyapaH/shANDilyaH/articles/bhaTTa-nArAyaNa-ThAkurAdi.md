## भट्ट-नारायणः
At about 8th or 10th century AD, five Kulin Brahmin came to Bengal from Kanyakubja ( Uttar Pradesh) at the invitation of a King, named AdiShur. Bhattanarayan was the son of Kshitish of Sandilya Gotra.  
Din, son of Bhattanarayan,  received a gift of land at Kushgram in the district of Burdwan,  and got the surname Kushari giving up his own title Bandyapadhayaya.  
After the 8th or 10th generation, Jagannath was born. 

## जगन्नाथः
Daksha was the first person in the clan of the Roychoudhurys of the Kashyap Gotra. Dakshinanath, born after 12th generation of Daksha, had three sons. Sukdev, Kamdev and Joydev. Amongst them Kamdev and Joydev were forcibly converted to Islam by a Mahammadan. Sukdev, though he did not convert, maintained his relationship with Kamdev and Joydev, later known as Kamaluddin and Jamaluddin, and became known as Pir-Ali Brahmin, meaning boycotted Brahmin. Any Brahmin with any kind of relation with Sukdev would come to be termed a Pir-Ali Brahmin. 

Jagannath Kushari married a daughter of Sukdev and was gifted land at Dakshindihi of Khulna district and began to live there. Jagannath Kushari, thus having entered a matrimonial relationship with Sukdev, also became known as Pir-Ali Brahmin. 

## पञ्चाननः
After a few generations, Panchanan was born in the the Kushari family. But due to some family troubles, Panchanan along with his uncle Sukdev came by boat on the Ganges to a place known as Govindapur. 

Some fishermen lived there. Panchanan and his uncle were the only Brahmins there and the fishermen, respectfully, called them 'Thakur', a name later pronounced as 'Tagore' by Europeans. Henceforth, Panchanan and his uncle became known as Thakur, giving up their surname, Kushari. Panchanan Kushari became known as Panchanan Thakur. But they followed the rites and customs of Kulin Brahmins in the case of marriage or any other social function. Panchanan used to supply  goods to the captains of the Ships.  His son Joyram earned a great deal of money in this way. He became a surveyor of the East India Company. Joyram died on 1756.

Provat Mukhopadhyaya, in his book Rabindra Jiban Katha, wrote that during marriage they had to search for girls from Jessore or Khulna. 

Even  Rabindranath was married to Bhabatarini, later known as Mrinalini, the daughter of one of the clerks of the Tagore family of Khulna district who was also a Pir-Ali Brahmin. 


Among the four sons of Joyram+++(=??)+++, Nilmoni and Darpanarayan were two prominent persons. In 1765, East India Company got the charge of collectorates of Revenues of Bengal. Nilmoni was appointed in the office of the collectorate of Orissa and gradually his earnings grew.

## Pathuriaghata family
Darpanarayan Tagore (1731-1791) was the first person in the family to earn through the money-lending business. But he had some dispute with Nilmoni who shifted his family to Mechuabazar (Jorasanko) and settled there. The other members of the family settled in Pathuriaghat, Kailaghata, and Chorbagan when Govindapur was razed by the British for the construction of the new Fort William.

### Gopimohan Tagore
Gopimohan Tagore (1760-1819), was well known for his wealth and in 1822 made what may be the largest ever gift of gold to the Kali temple at Kalighat. He was one of the founders of Hindu College. He knew English, French, Portuguese, Sanskrit, Persian and Urdu.

### Prasanna Kumar Tagore
Prasanna Kumar Tagore (1801-1868), son of Gopimohan was one of the leaders of the Landholders' Society and the president of the British Indian Association, the earliest organisation of Indians in British India. He was the founder of the first local theatre- The Hindu Theatre. He was also the first Indian to be appointed to the Viceregal Legislative Council. Jatindramohan Tagore (1831-1908), the son of Hara Kumar Tagore (1798-1858), and grand son of Gopimohan Tagore, was a theatre enthusiast, art-lover, and philanthropist. He started Banga Natya Mela. He constructed the first house on the land where Tagore Castle now stands at 26, Prasanna Kumar Tagore Street in Pathuriaghata.      

There stands on the Strand Road, facing the Hooghly, an old and yellowish dilapidated building with its imposing frontage designed as a replica of the Temple of Minerva in Athens. Kolkata's old Silver Mint, a land mark that has seen the city change dramatically over the past 184 years. The peeling plaster of the walls and wild growth of plants fail to veil the grandeur of the Doric columns of the Mint. Giving company to this grand structure is the historic Tagore Castle at Pathuriaghata, which was built by Darpanarayan Tagore, great grandfather of Nobel Laureate poet Rabindranath Tagore of Jorasanko Thakurbari which was located in its vicinity. In the early years of 1800s, this area used to be bustling with commercial activities of street vendors and traders.

## Jorasanko Thakurbari, Sovabazar Rajbari
In those days, Tagore Castle, Jorasanko Thakurbari, and at some little distance, Sovabazar Rajbari- all located on the embankment of the hooghly- attracted a great deal of public interest. But nowadays, except Jorasanko, the birth place of Tagore, all these buildings are in bad shape.  It was said that Raja Nabakrishna of Sovabazar, Prince Dwarakanath Tagore of Jorasanko and Raja Prasanna Thakur of Pathuriaghata- the three outstanding personalities of the Bengal renaissance- had played a pioneering role in the establishment of the old Silver Mint in the Business area. The Mint was of great importance since it was the only one that produced silver coins. As many as 3,00,000 to 6,00,000 siver coins were manufactured daily. Gold, Copper and Bronze coins were also made here. The facility of manufacturing medals was also available. 

The old yellowish Greecian structure that was once the old Mint complex of Kolkata, was built on an area of 12.5 acres of  land. Its foundation stone was laid in March 1824, and it became operational from 1 August 1829. It ceased to function in 1972. Official records revealed that the first mint in Calcutta was constructed in 1759.

The government undertook to protect all these places as heritages of India.

Nilmoni Thakur was the first person who in 1784, during the time of Warren Hastings, purchased a plot of land on the east side of Chitpur Road and constructed a building there. It was known as Mechhuabazar at that time, later it was renamed as Jorasanko.

Dwarakanath constructed another building by the side of his paternal house where he used to arrange dinner parties for his European friends, ladies and gentlemen.  Ganganendranath and Abaninidranth used to stay there.  The main portion of this building was damaged and the rest was utilized as a campus of the Viswa Bharati University.


The old house was not constructed all at a time, rather it was extended as and when required without having a definite plan. As a result it was built at various levels and made to bend according to necessity with staircases here and there, coming to look a bit like a jigsaw puzzle. It was a great wonder to Rabindranath when he was a child.  

## Jorasanko family
### Dwarakanath Tagore
Nilmoni's son Ramlochan, a rich banea and businessman had adopted Dwarakanath.

The Jorasanko Family: Dwarakanath Tagore (1794-1846) was the man who ushered the family into its special role in the history and culture of Bengal. He was the second son of  Rammani Tagore (second son of Nilmoni), but was adopted by the childless elder son, Ramlochan Tagore. He, not only inherited the great wealth of the Jorasanko family but also built up an extensive business empire even  while he worked as sheristadar, the highest position then open to Indians. He was a luxury loving prodigal. 

The contemporaries called him a prince because he had been to Britain where he was first described as a prince by the people coming in contact with him and also because of his lifestyle in Britain and Calcutta marked with princely grandeur and influence. Dwarakanath was one of those Baneans and mutsuddis  who were the first generation of the Bengali entrepreneurs and socio-political activists. The first Thakur to leave the parental home in Dakshindihi, Khulna, and join the rank of banians to the Europeans, was  Panchanan who worked with the French as a banian in the late 17th. century.

Dwarakanath Thakur, affluent enough to leave the low lying ancestral home at Pathuriaghata built by Joyram, constructed a colourful new home at Jorasanko where Rabindranath Tagore was born and brought up. 

The family name Thakur is said to have been conferred by the people of the fishing village, Govindapur, who felt to have been privileged by being served by the Pirali Brahmins ritually. However, the members of the Thakur family proved to be immensely entrepreneurial. But still, Dwarakanath Tagore suffered a sense of injury resulting from the indignity that other superior Brahmins had inflicted on them. No member of the Thakur family, including even Rabindranath, could set up any matrimonial connection with the superior Brahmin families due to alleged caste inferiority.

Under Robert Gutlar Fergusson, a british advocate, Dwarakanath learnt, as an apprentice, the laws of the Permanent Settlement and also the laws and procedures of the supreme court of Calcutta, Sadr and Zila courts and started his legal career very successfully in 1815. Soon, he started expanding the modest Zamindari estate that he inherited from his father, Ramlochan.  In 1830 Dwarakanath bought in auction the Kaligram zamindari in Rajshahi district and, in 1834, Shahazadpur in Pabna district. His zamindari had many partners and co-purchasers. But he himself held four large estates- Berhampur, Pandua, Kaligram and Shahazadpur- without partners and he placed them in trust for his sons and their descendants in 1840. 

He put his Zamindari management under several European experts. Dwarakanath made a fortune from his lucrative service as a serestadar (1828) and later diwan, the Board of Customs, Salt and Opium. He served for twelve years as diwan and had a money-lending business to salt manufacturers and others.  In addition to money-lending, he invested his money in the famous concern, Mackintosh and Company. He also had shares in the Union Bank when it was established in 1829.

In 1835, Government honoured him with the post of Justice of Peace, an honorary position newly opened to Indians at that time. He had investments in shipping , export trade, insurance, banking, coal mines, indigo, urban real estates and in zamindari estates.

#### EU visits
He often visited Britain like his friend and philosopher Raja Rammohan Roy. 

On 9 Jan 1842, Dwarakanath boarded his own steamer, the India, for the Suez. His European Physician, Dr. MacGowan, his nephew Chandra Mohan Chatterjee, his aide-de-camp, Paramananda Moitra, three Hindu servants and a Muslim cook accompanied him. In London, the British Prime Minister, Robert Peel (in office from December 1834 to April 1835 and June 1841 to June 1846) President of the Board of Control, Lord Fitzgerald, Prince Albert, Dutchess of Kent, Queen Victoria and others received him. (Pictures from top to bottom).

He spent 23 June with the Queen, reviewing troops. On 8 July, he was invited to a dinner with the Queen. The Queen noted in her diary, "The Brahmin speaks English remarkably well, and is a very intelligent, interesting man" (Queen Victoria's journal, 8 July 1842 ).

Dwarakanath left England on 15 October for Paris.

Dwarakanath left England on 15 October for Paris, where he was received by the French King, Louis-Philipe at St. Cloudon on 28 October. He returned to Calcutta in December 1842. 

#### Recession
The business recession of the early 1840s and his newly acquired princely life-style led to the collapse of his business empire and mired him in debt. The accumulated debt at his death was so huge that it took his son, Devendranath Thakur, almost all his life to free the family from encumberances. It was not only Dwarakanath's business that went into the red in the hard days of early 1840s, but many others like him were ruined due to the depression. Dwarakanath was the product of the depression of 1830-33 and victim of that of the 1840s. But his greatest success lies elsewhere . Collaboration in trade and commerce with the Europeans had long established precedents, but never before had a Bengali received recognition from them as an equal partner. Dwarakanath had broken that tradition and become an equal "partner in empire" by his own right.

#### Depression of the 1840s  
The depression of the 1840s, experienced Australia-wide, was a major halt to rapid economic growth in Van Diemens Land. The continued low price of wood in the London market after 1837, the 1839 English recession, the collapse of the mainland markets for grain and livestock, and the downturn of Tasmanian Capital invested in Port Phillip speculations led to the depression. Goods piled up in shops as lower earning power led to reduced spending . The influx of British capital ceased. Banks restricted credit. By 1843, bankrupcies no longer involved small retail traders and merchants alone, but extended to landed interests. Two Banks were closed.  


Dwarakanath was firm in defending the interest and sentiments of his people against European prejudices. He was one of those who took the role of spokesman of freedom of India abroad. He established on 21 March 1838 an Association for landholders (later known as Landholders' Society). The association was overtly a self-serving political association, founded on a large and liberal basis, to admit landholders of all descriptions, Englishmen, Hindus, Muslims, Christians. It was interesting to note that he along with Raja Radhakanta Dev founded the Gaudiya Sabha, the first political association in India to ventilate in a constitutional manner the grievances of the people or the section of them that were outspoken. From this grew the British India Association, the precursor to the Indian National Congress.  

Dwarakanath Tagore died on the evening of Saturday, 1 August 1846, at the St. George's Hotel in London during a tremendous thunderstorm, the likes of which had not been seen for many years. The London Mail of 7 August wrote of him, "descended from the highest Brahmin caste of India, his family can prove a long and undoubted pedigree."  

### Devendranath Thakur
Devendranath Tagore (15 May 1817- 19 January 1905) was an Indian Philosopher in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries from United Bengal in British India.

He  was born in Jorasanko, Calcutta and was the eldest son of his father, Dwarakanath. Being the son of a person known as prince, he was brought up in the lap of luxury surrounded by pomp and power. But  early in his youth the family fell into misfortune due to the economic depression in the 1840s and the life style of his father Prince Dwarakanath Tagore, who died on the evening of 1 August 1846 at the St. George's Hotel in London, leaving a huge debt. Devendranath, however, managed to repay all the loans and was, even, able to retain some of his property by intelligent management and a modest style of living.  He worked as a priest.

One day he came to learn a sloka from Ishaponishad written by Ram Chandra Vidyasagar which said  that "God is immanent in all things, in whatsoever lives and moves in the Universe, enjoy therefore without being attached, covet not wealth belonging to the others". From that day the course of his life was changed forever.

#### Tattwabodhini Sabha :
Along with the awakening of the soul, the influence of Raja Rammohan Roy was of immense significance. In October 1839, he, along with his friends, started the Tattva-ranjini Sabha. Its object was the dissemination of the knowledge of the Upanishads and the promotion of religious enquiry.  In two years there were 500 members including rich and influential men of Bengal. 

Pt. Ishwarchandra Vidyasagar was for some time the secretary of this Sabha. It was the largest and most influential cultural organisation of Bengal and it lasted till 1854. 


#### Tattvabodhini Patrika
It also had a printing press and Devendranath  started publishing the Tattvabodhini Patrika. This Patrika became the principal organ of the samaj for propagating its views. It taught men to think seriously and speak earnestly. It inaugurated the era of earnest journalism in Bengal. It was published in 5 different languages from five different centers- in  Bengali from Calcutta, in Tamil and English from Madras, and in Hindi and Urdu from Bareily.

Tattwabodhini Patrika was the organ of  Tattwabodhini Sabha. The journal was first published on 16th August 1843 from Calcutta to propagate the Brahmo faith and to enable regular contact among members of  Tattwabodhini Sabha. Akshoy Kumar Dutta was the first editor, and Debendranath Tagore was charged with its overall supervision. The best known prose writers of the 19th century- Iswar Chandra Vidyasagar, Rajnarayan Basu, Debendranath Tagore- contributed regularly to the journal, spawning a new epoch in Bangla language  and literature. All its contributors and patrons were reformists.

Tattwabodhini Patrika played a key role in the propagation of Brahmoism in Eastern Bengal. Brajasundar Mitra, initiator of the Brahmo Samaj in Dhaka, was attracted to this faith by reading the journal .Debendranath Tagore wanted to limit the journal to purely religious issues but Akshoy Kumar Dutta, the editor, extended it to scientific issues to place the journal at a high level. A committee was formed with Rajnarayan Basu, Anandakrishna Basu, Shridhar Nyayaratna, Radhaprasad Roy (son of Rammohan Roy), Debendranath Tagore and others for selecting articles for the journal.

Tattwabodhini Patrika was published upto 1932. After Akshoy Kumar Dutta it was edited at different times by Nabin Chandra Banerjee, Satyendranath Tagore, Ayodhya nath Pakrashi, Hemchandra Vidyaratna, Dwijendranath Tagore, Rabindranath Tagore and Kshitindranath Tagore.


#### Brahmo Sabha
In 1843, Devendranath started the Tattwabodhini Patrika as mouthpiece of the Tattwabodhini Sabha. In the same year, he revived the Brahmo Sabha fallen in vigour since the death of Rammohan (1774-1833) in 1833. The Brahmo Sabha was originally absorbed into the Tattwabodhini Sabha and renamed as Calcutta Brahmo Samaj. Devendranath took 20 of his young associates who joined him on 21 December 1843 (7 Paush, 1765 B.E.). This led the step for converting Brahmo Samaj into a spiritual fraternity. This day is still commemorated with the annual Paush mela at Santiniketan. 

#### Shantiniketan
The history of the place goes back to the 1860s, when Devendranath was struck by the beauty of the place of Shantiniketan, the western most corner of Bengal in Birbhum with red laterite soil, watered by several rain-fed rivulets. Passing through the village commons of Bhuvandanga (an area avoided by travellors because of dacoits), Maharshi was captivated by the beauty of two luxuriantly canopied Chattim trees, offering shade in that barren red land. To the Maharshi this was an idyllic venue for meditating. So he bought a large tract of land along with the two Chhatim trees and built a beautiful prayer hall with stained glass. Trees were planted all around to achieve the ancient forest-ashram look. In keeping with the spirit of the place, Maharshi named it "Shantiniketan" or 'the abode of peace'.

Devendranath's spiritual prowess was of the highest order, even while he maintained his worldly affairs not renouncing his material possessions as some Hindu traditions prescribed but rather continuing to enjoy them in a spirit of detachment.

His considerable material property included several estates spread over the districts of Bengal, most famously, the later acquisition Santiniketan Estate near Bolpur  in the Birbhum district  where his eldest son Rabindranath Tagore set up his school.

Devendranath was a master of the Upanishads and played no small role in the education and cultivation of faculties of his sons.

Dwijendranath (11 March-1840-19 Jan 1926) was a poet, a composer, philosopher, mathematician, and a pioneer in Bengali shorthand  and musical notations:

#### Daughters

Devendranath's daughters were Soudamini, Saratkumari, Swarnakumari, and Brahmakumari. Soudamini was the first student of Bethune school and gifted writer. Swarnakumari was also a gifted writer, editor, song-composer and social worker. All of them were famous for their beauty and education.

### dvijendranAth
Dwijendranath Thakur (11 March 1840 - 19 Jan 1926) the eldest son of Debendranath Thakur and grandson of Dwarakanath Thakur was born in Kolkata (Calcutta) on 11 March 1840. He was a poet, song composer, philosopher, mathematician, and a pioneer in Bengali shorthand and musical notation. He was mainly educated at home, but later he studied for some time in St. Paul's School and Hindu College of Kolkata. He was always close to his younger brother Satyendranath (1842 - 1923) but the two brothers differed considerably. Dwijendranath was comfortable with the traditions of the society, while Satyendranath enjoyed breaking down conservative rules to establish a modern society. Dwijendranath spent his time in cultivating poetry, acquiring knowledge and conducting various experiments.

His wife, Sarbasundari, died at an early age and he remained widower through out the rest of his life.

#### Contribution to Bengali Literature :

His first contribution to Bengali literature was the Bengali translation of Kaildasa's classical Sanskrit work Meghadut in 1860 before the  birth of his younger brother Rabindranath. It was the first time that that the great sanskrit poetic work was translated into Bengali. He had used two different Bengali rythmic styles for the translation.

Dwijendranath's second great work of poetry Swapnaprayan, published in  1875. This novel-poetry describes the travels of a young man to different places. Prabhat Mukhopadhayaya in his book Rabindrajiban Katha mentioned  when Dwijendranath was writing Swapnaprayan and was reciting the book  in front of his friends, Rabindranath was a boy noticing all this standing by the side of a door. Dwijendranath had displayed a remarkable control over the use of different rhythmic styles in the book. The book has a historic value.

It was an age when Michael Madhusudan influenced all Bengali poets but Dwijendranath was free from any such impact. On the other hand, Michael Madhusudan had hailed Dwijendranath as a poet of the future. Dwijendranath was 'a true philosopher'. He consorted with the learned of the National Society and the Biddwajjan-Samagam, both of which he had organised. Rabindranath came back from England in 1880 and after coming from England he found that a get-together had been arranged where renowned persons would be coming from Calcutta.  Rabindranath was given the charge of writing a drama  to be staged before the audience. He wrote Balmiki Prativa and he himself took the role of Valmiki. The lyrical-dramma was excellent and the performance was grand.  Dwijendranath delved deep into the philosophy of the Bhagabad Gita.

Dwijendranath on the chair and Rabindranath sitting by his side.

The philosophical work, Tattwabidya (Knowledge of Principles), published in three vols between 1866 and 1868, was a pioneering effort in Bengali literature. Never before had such a work been published. In 1896, he published Adwaita Mather Samalochana (Criticism of Adwaita Phlosophy) and in 1899, Aryadharma O Boudhya Darmer Ghat-Pratighat (a book on the conflicts of aryan religion, Hinduism, and Buddhism). 

He edited Tattwabodhini Patrika for 25 years from 1884 and was  a founder of Hitabadi. He was keen on extending Tattwabodhini Patrika but his younger brother Jyotirindranath (1849-1925) proposed a new magazine Bharati and made Dwijendranath the editor. Rabindranath was 16 years at that time and was not left out of the editorial board of the magazine, Bharati. In the first year Kabikahini of Rabindranath was being published in serial.

To acknowledge the contribution of Dwijendranath to Bengali literature, he was elected President of Bangiya Sahitya Parishad from 1897 to 1900. He presided over the 1914  session of the Bangiya Sahitya Sammelan.

He was a Zamindar who always remained absent from his Zamandari, but in 1873, he advocated drastic action for "the restoration of order and tranquility " against peasants participating in the Pabna disturbances, which was severely curtailing his income.

Dwijendranath kept himself always busy with experiments of various types. He was a pioneer in the field of Bengali short hand and even coded  it in the form of poetry. He pioneered the use of notations (swaralipi) for Bengali music. The only other person who could claim credit for this was Kshetramahon Goswami, assistant to Raja Shourindramohan Tagore. In 913, he wrote a book Boxometry, the construction of boxes.He was adept in folding paper into different shapes.

He was secretary of the Adi Brahmo Samaj from 1866 to 1871 and used to serve as  Acharya or minister for Upasanas or Brahmo Prayers. He had accompanied his father to Dakha when Dhaka Brahmo Samaj was in its formative years under the leadership of Braja Sundar Mitra.

Closely associated with Hindu Mela, he was its secretary and composed patriotic songs for it. One of its devotional song , karo tomar naam gaan, jata din rahe dehe pran (sing his praise as long as there is life in the body) has been sung with the prayers on 7th of Poush for many years. He wrote many other devotional songs broadly classified as Brahmasangeet, sung with prayers of Brahmo Samaj.  One popular patriotic song he composed for the Hindu Mela was "malina mukhochandrama Bharat tomari" (pale is your face, o India).


#### shAntiniketan
History : Shantiniketan was previously called Bhubandanga (named after Bhuban Dakat, a local dacoit).   Devendranath Thakur, father of Dwijendranath, visited the place in 1861 and found it very peaceful, suitable for meditation and other Aradhana purpose. He purchased 20 bighas of land of Bhubandanga village from Singha family of Roypur under Bolpur Mouja in 1863 and renamed it as Shantiniketan, which means 'abode of peace' . He  used to visit the place occasionally and took Rabindranath  there for the first time in 1873 and stayed for some time, enroute to Dalhouse.

The weather in Shantiniketan is usually a peasant one although one might come across the changes of weather in summer, winter and rainy season. Nonetheless spring has its own charm, not only because of its natural beauty blooming to its fullest amidst the lush greenary but also due to the famous Vasanta utsab held to mark the festival of Holi with the on set of spring..

Rabindranath founded a school at Shantiniketan in 1901with five student.He took Rabindranath for the first time

Dwijendranath spent the last 20 years of his life in Shantiniketan, in oneness with nature for learning and writing. He wrote humorous four-line rhymes on people in Shantiniketan, which were published in Shanti- niketan Patrika. His sense of humor  was a talking point for many years. His friendship with sparrows, squirrels, and crows became legends in Shantiniketan.

He followed the advice of the Upanishads - after acquiring knowledge remain a child at heart. He read his papers at the majlis or gathering of learned men, including Rabindranath. There were an assembly of learned persons like Bidhushekhar Sastri, Kshitimohan Sen. Mahatma Gandhi and C.F.Andrews used to call Dwijendranath bardada like Rabindranath Thakur.


Apart from editing he had his own publication. In Bengali Bhratribhab (1863), Tattwabidya (1866-68), Sonar kathi Rupor kathi (1885), Sonay Sohaga ( 1885), Aryami ebong Sahebiyana (1890), Samajik Roger Kaviraji Chikitsa (1891), Adaitya- mater Samalochana (1896), Brahmagnan O Brahmasadhana (1900), Banger Rangabhumi (1907), Haramanir Anwesan (1908), Gitapather Bhumika (1915), and Prabandhmala (1920), in English : Boxometry (of Mathematics)-1913, Ontology (1871), a book on Geometry.He published innumerable writings in different magazines such as Jnankur, Pratibimbo, Tattwabodhini, Barati, Sadhana, new look Bangadarshan, Manasi, Sahitya Parishad Patrika, Santiniketan, Budhbar, Shreyasi, Prabasi, Sabujpatra, and Supravat. This is simply a quantitave estimate and not a qualitative one.

#### Descendants 

Dwijendranath had five sons--1. Dipendranath, 2. Arunendranath, 3. Nitindranath, 4. Sudhindranath, 5. and Kripendra.

Amongst his sons- Sudhindranath (1869-1929) was a talented author. he wrote poems, novels, and short Stories. He introduced a new literary magazine, Sadhana in 1891 and was its first editor. Later, Rabindranath edited it and subsequently it was merged with Bharati .

Amongst his grand sons, Dinendranath (1882-1935), son of Dipendranath, had exceptional talent of music. He could remember the tune of any song he heard once. Rabindranath used to compose tunes of the songs he wrote but found it difficult to remember and codify them. He used to call Dinendranath to do the job and develop notations. Rabindranath called him "store keeper of his songs."

Soumendranath Tagore (1910-1974), son of Sudhindranath , was a great orator. He was an icon of cultural arena in the 1960s and 1970s. he was associated with the communist movement from his younger days.    

#### Hindu Mela
Hindu Mela was a socio-cultural organisation aimed at reviving the glory of Indian civilisation, mobilise the Hindus, especially the youth, and to cultivate the national language and ideas, so as to fight the cultural colonisation of British. This organisation was mainly supported by several members of the Tagore family, Rajnarayan Basu and Nabagopal Mitra (the editor of the National paper). 
In April 1867, on the day of  the Chaitra Sankranti (the last day of the Bengali year) the Hindu Mela was established. A formal committee was set up on the first day of the Mela of which Ganendranath Tagore became the  first secretary and Nabagopal Mitra the chief organiser. An exhibition was arranged on the occasion with National art-work, handicrafts, cottage industries etc. Among others who took active interest in the Mela were Dwijendranath Tagore, Rajnarayan Basu, Kristodas Pal, Girish Chandra Ghosh, Raja Kamal Krishna Bahadur and others. This was an early attempt to fight British Imperialism and to develop national industries.
The first three annual gatherings was also called Chaitra Mela. A national fair was organised on Chaitra Sankranti. The annual mela was inaugurated amidst the patriotic song of Dwijendranath Tagore- Malina Mukhochandra Ma Bharat Tomari (O mother India, your moon-face is so gloomy...). At the second annual Mela (1868), held at Belgachia and presided by Gnanandranath Tagore, a patriotic song composed by Satyendranath (when he was an ICS) - Gao Bharater Joy  was sung . This song was virtually the National Song till Bankim Chandra wrote Bande Mataram to replace it.. The details of the Mela was published in detail in all the news papers and magazines. In its annual gathering of 1875, Rabindranath Tagore recited his own poetry -Hindu Melar Upahar - which was publised in Amrita Bazar Patrika of 25 February 1875. The Hindu Mela gradually lost ground unable to cope with the new and complex demands of the 1880s and 1890s.  In the 1890s the Mela gradually faded away. But the spirit of swadeshi that it invoked in the minds of the Bengalis survived, which was subsequently developed during the Swadeshi Movement during the early period of twentieth century.


### Satyendranath (1842-1923)
Satyendranath (1842-1923) was the first Indian to join the Indian Civil Service. He was a great scholar with a large reservoir of creative talents.

Satyendranath Thakur, (1842-1923)

#### First Indian ICS :

For a long time, only the British were appointed to administrative posts in India. In 1832, the post of Musif and Sadar amin were created and opened to Indians. In 1833, the post of deputy Magistrate and deputy Collector were created for Indians. The ICS Act of 1861, established the Indian Civil Service. The Act of 1853 already established the practice of recruiting Indian civilians through competitive examinations. It was a daunting task to go to England at that time and compete with the British for securing a position . However, being inspired by a friend, Monomohan Ghose, Satyendranath, along with Monomohan, set sail for England in 1862 to prepare for and compete in the civil service examination. Satyendranath was selected in June 1863 but Monomohan was not. He was called to the bar. Satyendranath was posted to the Bombay Presidency, which then covered western parts of present day Maharashtra, Gujrat and Sindh. He had his first posting at Ahmedabad. Among the regular visitors to his place were his younger brothers,  Jyotirindranath (1849-1825), Rabindranath (1861-1941) and his sister Swarnakumari Devi.

His posting outside Bengal helped him to learn several Indian languages other than Bengali. While in Maharashtra he had close contact with many of the leading reformers, such as, Govinda Ranade, Kashinath Trimbak Telang, Ramkrishna Gopal Bhandarkar and Narayan Ganesh Chandavarkar.

He retired as a Judge of Satara in Maharashtra in 1897.

Ram Mohan Roy found Hindu Indian women "uneducated and illiterate, deprived of property rights, married before puberty, imprisoned in purdah, and murdered at widowhood by a barbaric custom of immolation known as SATI". By the time Satyendranath was born, SATI had been baned in 1829, and the process of reformation had begun. Satyendranath began thinking that purdah system had come from Muslim practices. 

After his marriage (1859), he found that Jnanadanandini was the ideal partner for his social experiments. In-spite of the opposition from Devendranath,  he sent her along with her two children, Surendranath and Indira Devi, to England to learn from the behavior of women in an advanced society. In Calcutta, breaking from all the previous practices, he took her to a party at the Government House (now Raj Bhavan).  

Prasanna Coomar Tagore of Pathuriaghata branch of Tagore family, who was also present on the occasion, became astonished to see a Bengali woman in such an open place among the hundreds of English women and left the place immediately 'in shame and anger'. 

In 1877, he sent Jnanadanandini Devi with two children to England with an English couple. They, initially stayed with the family of Prasanna Coomar Tagore's son, Gnanendramohan Tagore, who had converted to Christianity and was the first Indian to qualify for the English  bar.+++(5)+++ Later Jnanadanandini with her children shifted to Brighton and lived on their own there.

This was the attempt of Satyendranath to remove the upper and middle class women from purdah.

#### Patriotism
The Tagore family was deeply patriotic.  It was a fashion to wear foreign clothes and use foreign language (without having sound knowledge) at that time. The members of Tagore family stuck to wearing Indian dress and did a lot to improve Bengali language. Satyendranath was one of the persons to organize Hindu Mela to arouse patriotism in people. In the second session, he composed the pariotic song "mile sabe Bharat santan, ektan gaho gaan" ( unite India's Children, sing in unision). The song was hailed as the first national anthem of India.

After retirement, he lived in Park Street and Ballygunge in Kolkata. His house was the meeting place of his friends and relatives. Persons who visited regularly, outside his family members, were Taraknath Palit, Monomohan Ghose, Satyendraprasanna Sinha, W.C.Banerjee, Krishna Govinda Gupta, and Bihari Lal Gupta and others.

His house at Park Street was the centre of a literary majlis.

He was president of Bangiya Sahitya Parishad from 1900-1901and presided over the 10th session of the Bengal Provincial Conference held at Natore in 1897.

Satyendranath was the author of :

1. Sushila o Birsingha (play, 1867)
2. Bombay Chitra (1888)
3. Nabarathna mala
4. Stree swadhinata
5. Baudhafharmma
6. Amar Balyakatha
7. Bharatbarshiya Ingrej


### Hemendranath (1842-1923)
He was the third son of Devendranath,  a scientist and organiser of the family. He was a strict disciplinarian who was entrusted with the responsibility of looking after the education of his younger brothers as well as administering the large family estates.

Like most of Devendranath's children, he had varied interests in different fields. On the one hand he composed  a number of Brahma Sangeets and on the other, wrote articles on Physical Science which he planned to compile and edit into a text book for school students.

If his untimely death had not prevented him from completing the project, this would certainly have been the first science text book to be written in Bengali. He was known for his physical strength and wrestling skills.

Exceptionally for the times, he insisted on a formal education for his daughters. He not only put them into schools but trained them in Music, the Arts and European languages such as French and German. It was another mark of his forward-looking mentality that he actively sought out eligible grooms from different provinces of India for his daughters and married them off to places as far as away as UP and Assam.

He was a spiritual seer and Yogi of the highest order and he was responsible for the development of modern Brahmoism which is now the Adi Brahmo Dharma religion. He was a "doer" of his Tagore generation and worthy successor to the father and grand-father.

This is the only Photo obtained on search from internet which claims to be the photo of Hemendranath Tagore.

Debendranath Tagore's third son, is notable for being the first ever Brahmo as he was the first child born in 1844 to any of the 21 Brahmos who swore the first Brahmo Covenant on 21st Dec 1843 at Kolkata.

An intesely private person, he was also known by his three qualities.

1. A strict disciplinarian entrusted with responsibility of looking after the education of his younger brothers,
2. As the administrator of the large family estates of Debendranath's branch of the Tagore family, and
3. While alive, he was also the constant spiritual companion  to his father, Debendranath Tagore, who founded Brahmoism, and despite his extreme youth, acted as the channel between his father and the seniors of the Tattwabodhini Sabha.

#### Educational career
Like most of Debendranath's children, he had varied interest in different fields and was a polymath. He had much interest in science and attended the Calcutta Medical College  (established by his grand father Dwarakanath Tagore). He wrote articles on Physical Science which he planned to compile and edit into a text book for school students. If his early death had not prevented him from completing the project, this would certainly had been the first science text book to be written in Bengali.

From 1867 Hemendranath Tagore began conducting his first experiments into radio waves and electromagnetic propagations. Between 1872-1873 he wrote several articles on the results of his research, these were transcribed by another Brahmin, Ramendra Sundar Trivedi. In 1874, he compiled the first scholarly Asian work on physics entitled Prakritik Vijnaner Sthulamarma which was updated in 1878-79.

Since the knowledge contained within was potentially explosive, its circulation was restricted only to Brahmins of the Adi Brahmo Samaj.

Built like a bull, he was known for his extraordinary physical strength and prowess in wrestling contests - described as being a "renowned wrestler", as also his expertise in martial arts like judo and ninjitsu. He was also an adept of ancient Raj Yoga at  the highest levels with control over time and space.

Exceptionally modern for the times,  after siring three sons, he sired only daughters thereafter and insisted on formal education for all of them. He not only put them through schools but trained them in music, arts, and European Languages such as German and French. It was another mark of his forward looking mentality that he actively sought out eligible grooms from different parts of India for his daughters.

He arranged marriages for his daughters in UP and Assam. 

A staunch modernist, he instituted various financial trusts for the womenfolk of Tagore family (specially his sisters) and was responsible for settling the Santiniketan estate near Bolpur which later evolved into Viswa Bharati.

A practical and scientific humanist, he was deeply loved by the peasants of his estates in India and Bangladesh. After his death in 1884, his brothers especially Rabindranath Tagore and Satyendranath Tagore revoked all the trusts, destroyed the papers of Dwarakanath Tagore, cheated their sisters from their patrimony, squandered the family money, and rack-rented the peasantry who rose up in revolt

Hemendranath was concerned with three things.  His family- in the broader sense, which included father, mother, brothers, sisters, and his own family, Tattwabodhini Sabha and the estates of  the Tagore family.

But his life-span was so brief, only 40 yrs, 1844-1848, that he could not do any justice to any of the three excepting that he could get married of his daughters to well placed grooms in different parts of India.


#### jAti and upavIta

A series of developments in Tattwabodhini Sabha after its merger in 1843 with Calcutta Brahmo Samaj resulted in the forming of a reformist core elect Brahmin group, which stood apart from Calcutta Brahmo Samaj during the fractious period of 1858 to 1865, to later emerge as Adi Dharma. This core was initially under Pt. Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar who later entrusted it to Hemendranath in 1859. 

Finally in 1865 Hemendranath took charge, firmly insisting on the expulsion of non-Brahmins from preaching posts. He thereafter organised research on the formal practices, rituals and observations for Brahmo adherents which were privately circulated in early 1860 as Brahmo Anusthan. 

This Anusthan was limited for the Brahmin families of the 1843 First Covenant only and was first used publicly in 26 July 1861 for the marriage of his second sister Sukumari. The Anusthan involving discarding the Sacred Brahmin Thread, which created considerable controversy and was thereafter adopted for the non-brahmins also with some small modifications for those who possessed no thread.

#### Children Of Hemendranath
Hemendranath had eleven children. The first threee were sons and the last eight were daughters. The names were;
Hitendranath, Kshitindranath, Ritendranath, these three were the  sons.
Prativa, Pragna, Abhi, manisha, Shovana, Sushama, Sumrita, Sudakshina, these eight were daughters.

Among the sons, Kshitindrnath was well known as official Historian of Adi Brahmo Samaj and Editor of the Tattwabodhini juournal, a duty carried on by grandson Commander Amritomayi Mukherjee I.N. He tirelessly strove to unearth the tagore family records which were removed by Satyendranath Tagore and his daughter Indira Devi from Jorasanko. (  Ref :en.wikipedia.org)

Prativa Devi married Ashutosh Choudhury. Their son Arya studied architecture in England.

Pragnasundari Devi married the most famous Assam author Sahityarahthi Lakshinath Bezbarua (1868-1938), whose father was the physician to the last Kings of Assam. The inventive genius of Bezbarua who was an intellectual of the highest order and a humorist of considerable power.....his song O Mor Apanar Desh is the most popular assamese patriotic song of all times, and the de-facto anthem of Assam. 

Pragnasundari Devi was a literary phenomenain in her own right, her cook-book Amish O Niramis Ahar (1900, reprinted 1995) was a standard book given to everyBengali bride with her trousseau, and earning her the apellation "India's Mrs Beeton" . From 1897 -1902 Pragnasundari was the editor of the periodical Punya , at first started as the inhouse publication of Thakur-Bari. containing fiction, poetry, and do

Hemendranath's youngest child was a daughter, Sudakshina nee Purnima Devi (later Mrs. Jwala Prasad) who was born on 13th May, 1884 at no.6, Dwarakanath Tagore Lane, Jorasanko, Calcutta. Purnima devi was educated at the Loreto Convent  (a school for European girls) at Park Street, Calcutta, as a day scholar and in addition to English she knew Bengali, Sanskrit, Urdu, Hindi, French, Piano, and Violin. She passed the Cambridge Trinity College Music Examination. 

She is the first Bengali woman to marry into the United provinces, her husband being the late Hon'ble Pandit Jwala Prasad, M.A., Deputy Commissioner of Hardoi, (an officer in the Imperial Civil Services, whose great grand father was Late Kunwar Jitendra Prasad, a vetaran Congress Party Leader, in 1903). She was the winner of the B.P.R.A. medal for Diana matches for schooling (1911 Meerut). She was an expert rider going round her villages on horse back and an expert hunter having taken part in big game shooting with her husband. She took a very keen interest in the education and upliftment of women in India. 

In memory of her husband she founded 'The Pandit Jwala Prasad Kanya Pathsala' at Shahjahanpur in UP. She helped in the establishment of the Hewett Model Girls' school at Muzaffarnagar, United Provinces, and founded Pardah Clubs at Shahjahanpur and Muzaffarpur with a view to the improvement of Pardanashin women. She was the owner of several villages in Shahjahanpur District and a beautiful hill property at Nainitala (Uttarkhand) called Abbotsford, Prasad Bhawan (http;//www.abbotsford,in/History.html). There now lives the fourth generation of Prasads who carry their ancestral heritage.  

She also had a house now acquired by the Army and a beachhouse in Puri. She was the author of a Hindi publication, "unki bunat ki Prathaiji Siksha" adopted by the United peovinces Educational Textbook Committee for schools. She was engaged in writing a novel in English under the Title of "The last lamp out". she was the holder of a Kaisar-i-Hind medal and was the first Indian woman exempted from the operation of the Arms Act.             



#### Vision of Brahma

Hemendranath explained his peculiar experiences while he was meditating. This was known as "description of Vision of Brahma in 1848".

> Then I went out and sat underneath an ashvatta tree and according to the teaching of the saints began meditating on the Spirit of of God dwelling my soul. My mind was flooded with emotion, my eyes were filled with tears. All at once I saw the shining vision of Brahma in the lotus core of my heart. A thrill passed through my whole body, I felt a joy beyond all measure. But the next moment I could see Him  no more. On losing sight of that beautific vision which destroys all sorrow, I suddenly rose from the ground. A great sadness came over my spirit. Then I tried to see him again by force of contemplation, and found him not. I became as one stricken with disease and would not be comforted. Meanwhile I suddenly heard a voice in the air, "In this life thou shalt see Me no More. Those whose hearts have not been purified, who have not achieved the highest Yoga, cannot see Me. It was only to stimulate thy love that I once appeared before thee.'

### Jyotirindranath
Jyotirindranath (1849-1925) was a scholar, artist, music composer and theater personality.

Jyotirindranath, the grandson of Dwarakanath Tagore and fifth son of Debendranath Tagore, was born in Jorasanko, Calcutta, on 4 May 1849. He was twelve years senior to Rabindranath but was close to him and he assisted Rabindranath in the development of his cultural life.

Formative years : In his early childhood he was taught by his elder brother Hmendranath. Then he studied at St. Paul's and Montague's School and passed entrance examination (school leaving ) from Hindu School in 1864. The renowned historian and writer Ramesh Chandra Dutta was his classmate.While studying in Presidency College, he developed interest in the theatre and left his studies.

#### Involvement in the theatre 
He formed a home theatre group and staged dramas. One of his cousins, Ganendranath, established the Jorasanko Natyasala in 1865. The first play to be staged was Krishnakumari written by Michael Madhusudan Dutta. Jyotirindranath acted in the role of Ahalyadevi, a brave queen. His early success developed in him a strong determination to be one of greatest playwrights of his age. He became involved in Hindu Mela and he recited poems and composed patriotic dramas to develop its cultural organisation. He also organised Biddvajjana  Samagama as a support base of cultural program of Hindu Mela. This organisation also provided Rabindranath an opportunity to stage some of his plays and dance dramas. Jyotirindranath was elected General secretary of Hindu Mela in the ninth year of existence of the organisation.

#### Works of Jyotirindranath
Jyotirindranath wrote popular plays such as Purubikram (1874), Sarojini ( Rabindranath wrote a song to this Drama, Jwala jwala Chita, Dwigun-dwigun") (1875), Swapnamayi (1882).  His noteworthy satires include Kinchit Jalajog, Eman karma ar karbo na, Hathat Nabab, Alik babu, Hathat Nabab was based on Moliere's Bougeois Gentilhomme. Purubikarma was based on raja Puru. Sarojini is a trajedy.

In 1867, while staying with his elder brother Satyendranath Tagore in Ahmedabad, he learnt many things, 1. how to play with the sitar, and 2. painting. He picked up French and Marathi languages.He translated books from different languages into his native language Bengali, the focus being on plays. From English he translated Marcus Aurelius' Meditation  , Shakespeare's Julius Caeser. Apart from Pierre Loti and and Theophile Gautier, he translated many books on history, philosophy and travels, novels aand short stories from French.

From Marathi , he translated Balgangadhar Tilak's Geetarahasya. Jyotirindranath proposed a newmagazine Bharati in 1877 and made Dwijendranath its editor. He became vice-president of the Bangiya Sahitya Parishad in 1902 -03.Jyotirindranath had 46 vols of published works to his credit, including translation. He always attended a literary gathering (majlis) in the house of his elder brother Satyendranath Tagore.

#### Music
Jyotirindranath had his lessons in music, early in his life from Bishnupada Chakraborty. He was expert in playing Piano, Violin, Sitar, and Harmonium. Jyotirindrath was the pivot of a developing musical environment in Jorasanko. His companion was Akshoy Kumar Dutta. Later Rabindranath joined him at the age of 14. The system of development was peculiar in their case. Jyotirindranath gave the musical note and Rabindranath had to fit lyrics in it. 20 songs of Rabindranath's dance drama Mayar Khela  was composed like this. Jyotirindranath first of all developed musical note and then lyrics was put in it. In 1879, he published a magazine, Binabadini, on behalf of the organisation Swaralipigitimala,on musical matters. This was the first magazine of its type. He published another magazine on music, Sangeet Prakashika. One  of the foresmost musicologists of Kolkata, as well as a classical singer Rajyeswar Mitra opines, "at this stage too, we find the rise of a celebrated line of musical and dramatic culture in the house of the Thakurs, which was much more polished and enlightened in character than most other such houses. The chief architect of this development was Jyotirindranath."  

#### Drawing
He was attracted towards drawing and sketching. He sketches the portraits of many persons in his family, specially of  Rabindranath there were numerous sketches in different styles. He drew the sketches of plain folk around him including the employees of his shipping firm. He had drawn around 2,000 sketches, which are preserved in Rabindra Bharati University museum. Some of his sketches were published in Bharati in 1912. William Rothenstein happened to see them. When Rabindranath proceeded  for third time to visit  England, he carried a bunch of sketches prepared by Jyotirindranath. Rothenstein was highly impressed and with his assistance the book Twenty-five collotypes from the original drawings of Jyotirindranath was published in England.

#### Business Venture
Jyotirindranath earned some money from indigo cultivation. He could not continue indigo cultivation due to the fall of demand of  natural indigo after the discovery of chemical indigo in Germany. He became esger to switch over to other ventures. At that time, there was need  for a steamer link between Khulna and Barisal (both the places are now in Bangladesh). 

He started a steamer service, Sarojini.     But a English company Flotilla  also started the same business. To meet the competition, he purchased four more steamers, Swadeshi, Bharat, Bangalakshmi, and Ripon.      But after reducing the fare, Jyotirindranath incurred heavy losses. Moreover, Swadeshi hit a jetty and sank. Jyotirindranath had no alternative but to sell the steamers and opt out of the competition.

#### Other activities
He served as secretary of the Adi Brahmo Samaj from 1869 to 1888. He founded Adi Brahmo Samaj Sangit Vidyalaya. At his initiative a secret society Sanjivani Sabha was formed, possibly in 1876, with Rajnarayan Basu as president. This society manufactured match sticks and hand-woven cloth which could not earn any profit but did encourage swadeshi enterprise.

#### Marriage
He was married to Kadambari Devi on 5 July 1868. He arranged for her education including horse-riding in the public grounds of Kolkata defying the attitude of conservativbe society. Kadambari committed suicide on 19 April 1884, the cause of which was unknown.



### Rabindranath Tagore
Rabindranath Tagore was born at No. 6 Dwarakanath Tagore Lane, Jorasanko, located in north Calcutta (Kolkata) near Chitpur Road on 7 May 1861. He was the youngest  son (eighth) among the fourteen children (Budhendranath, 1863-1864, died at the age of 1) of his parents- Devendranath and Sarada Devi.
 
He (called Rabi) was born in a family of mixed culture of East and West. He wrote in his autobiography - My life in my words -

> "there was something remarkable in our family. it was as if we lived close to the age of pre-Puranic India through our commitment to the Upanishads. As a boy, I grew up reciting slokas from the Upanishads with a clear enunciation. We had no experience of the emotional excesses prevalent in Bengal's religious life. My father's spiritual life was quiet and controlled."

They had a genuinely deep love of English literature. Shakespeare and Sir Walter Scott had a strong influence over their family.

There had been several changes, both nationally and internationally, in the second half of the nineteenth century. Rabi noted that a great fight ensued between the more progressive people of his time and the orthodox, who became 'nervous and angry' when some lover of truth broke open their enclosure and flooded it with the sunshine of thought and life.

Rabi felt proud of having witnessed three revolutionary movements in his family during his father's time.

1. He was proud, for his father was one of the great leaders of the movement, a movement for whose sake he suffered ostracism and braved social indignities.
2. A literary revolution of which Bankim Chandra Chatterjee of Bengal was the pioneer.
3. The third one was the emergence of nationalism. He was proud that the people of his country started asserting their own personality and began to raise their voice against the indignity and the humiliation imposed upon them by the British colonisers.

The first modern man of India, Raja Ram Mohan Roy, was a friend of the Tagore family since the time of Dwarakanath Tagore.  Under his influence Devendranath took to Brahmoism in 1848 much before the birth of Rabindranath. Rabindranath said in his autobiography that his father was fortunate to come under the influence of Ram Mohan Roy from his (Devendranath's) early years which helped him to free himself from the sectarian barriers, from traditions of worldly and social ideas that were very rigid in many aspects, very narrow and not altogether beneficial, and his family had given up "mainstream" Hinduism well before he was born. 

Devendranath was 45 years of age when Rabi was born. Their special Puja building was no longer in use and he had no idea about any rituals and practices of his ancestors. He did not see the "festival of wealth' of his grandfather (Dwarakanath) except the "black marks of the burnt lamps".

Rabindranath's  early life was  simple and modest. The only difference with other families was that the family home had a flow of cultural activities, and the cultivation of art and music had become a family tradition.

Organising the Hindu Mela was an annual affair of Devendranath and Babu Nabagopal Mitra was entrusted with the job. When Rabi was born, Dwijendranath was 21 years, Satyendranath 19 years, Hemendranath 17 years, and Jyotirindranath 13 years.  There were other siblings, but the four elder brothers had a strong influence on Rabindranath. 

The daughters of Devendranath, who were married, lived with their husbands in Jorasanko. Sometimes the number of members of Jorasanko Thakur Bari exceeded 200. Devendranath's wife Sarada Devi, busy with such a large household, could not find time for her children. Rabindranath was brought up by the servants and taught by his brothers.

In childhood Rabindranath had two friends- Satyaprasad, slightly older and the sister of Satyaprasad, Ira (Irabati, 1861-1918), son and daughter of Soudamini, the eldest daughter of Devendranath- both of them always fuelled his imagination by telling peculiar tales about Thakurbari.

After the birth of the youngest child (Budhendranath), who died at the age of one, Sarada Devi's health  broke down and she could  devote even less time to her children. Other senior women of the family, elder sisters and sisters-in-law, were also very busy with their respective duties. 

Rabindranath Tagore had to  pass most of his time with a 'retinue' of servants and maid-servants from morning till night before going to  sleep. He was not allowed to move around even within the house. He had no ideas about the different rooms, corridors within the building. Only his imagination and the stories told by his two companions gave him what he called 'pictures of life's memories rather than life's history'. This he termed 'servocracy'. 

> 'One of the servants would place him at a certain strategic point and draw a circle round him', 

warning him of dire consequences if he  crossed the border line. They always used to tell the story of the Ramayana, reminding him of the punishment that Sita received by crossing the line. The boy stayed well within the circle, imagining the worst possible perils if he disobeyed. There was a pond beneath the window. On the east side of the pond, by the side of the wall, stood a big banyan tree (Rabindranath wrote a poem on this Banyan tree, Purono Bat) and on the south there were rows of coconut trees. As a child Rabindranath used to pass his time looking at all these like 'Amal of Dakghar'.

When Rabi was a child he was not allowed to go outside the house. So he peeped through corridors and windows and wanted to see beyond his reach. Sometimes he could hear whiffs of sounds coming from inside or outside, some scents which used to touch his mind and he felt that someone was around and would be  meeting and playing with him. The ways of such  a meeting of a bounded person with an unbounded entity (he wrote a poem, Dui Pakhi, in Sonar Tari) was unknown to him and the attraction of such a call gradually became stronger.  


In the city of Calcutta, when Rabindranath was born, there was no trams,buses or motor cars. Only horse driven cars were available. The horses moved in the city raising dust all around and the coachman used to whip the horses to keep them on the right track.  The marks of the whip lashes became invisible in the bony recesses on the horse's back. Life was slow and leisurely and betel chewing clerical staff sometimes came to their offices in shared carriages. 


Palanquin, a spot for Imagination of Rabindranath
"The chalk line has been wiped away today, but the confining ring is still there. The distance is just as distant, the outside is still beyond me...." 
 

In the time of Dwarakanath, grand father of Rabindranath, palanquins were in use. He had a big palanquin which required eight bearers to carry each pole. The bearers, their gold bracelets, their thick earrings and their sleeveless red tunics had gone with the wealth and glory of  Prince Dwarakanath. The body of the palanquin sans the decorations was left in a corner of the accounting-house as a piece of common-place lumber.

It was to him an island  in the midst of the ocean, and he,on holidays, became Robinson Crusoe. He sat within its closed doors, completely out of sight, delightfully safe from prying eyes'.  

#### Song
Rabindranath Tagore had a sweet voice from his childhood . Thakurbari was always full of literary activities, songs and dramas. But that was amongst the elders, children were not allowed to enter. Dwijendranath, the eldest son of   Devendranath, was then writing a Kabya, "Swapnaprayan", which he used to recite for others to listen. Rabindranath, standing by the side of the door, listened and learnt the verses by heart. Rabindranath said that he could not remember how he learnt to sing. Sreekantha Singh, a friend of Devendranath and el Singing was his passion. He was always absorbed in music. He was appointed for teaching songs but he did not teach songs, he gave them lessons only. Bishnu Chakraborty was a singer of  Adi Brahmo Samaj; he gave them the first lesson in how to sing. Rabindranath did not take regular tuition. Finally, Jadu Bhatta became their vocal music teacher. 

But Rabindranath  learnt singing in his own way- from servants, from gypsy women, from Bauls and from here and there, from whatever he heard. These were the first lessons of Rabindranath  before he went into formal education.

He and the other children had to pass most of their time with Ishwar or to be more precise,  Brajeshwar. Once he was a village-teacher. He was entrusted to train the children. At that time there was no electricity, there were Kerosene or other oil lamps. Childrens used to sit around him and hear the stories of Ramayana and Mahabharata in the dim light of the lamp. After dinner, when they went to bed, a maid told them bed time stories of galloping horses on vast stretches of land, till all of them were sound asleep.       

This was the beginning of his education before actually reading books. ??der brother of Lord Satyendra Prasanna, came from Raipur of Birbhum district to stay in Calcutta.

#### Game with wooden lion

There was another game, too, with his wooden lion. He heard stories of sacrifices of goats, buffaloes and he decided that a lion sacrifice would be magnificient.  He had a wooden lion. Ofcourse, there would be some strong 'mantra' for the lion otherwise it could not be offered for puja, He found a mantra,

#### Servants
The house was full of relatives and other people. From all parts of the house one could hear the sounds made by the shouts of the servants at work.

Pari, the maid, returning from the bazaar through the front courtyard, her vegetables in a basket on her hip;  
Dukhon the bearer carrying Ganga water in a yoke across his shoulder, the weaver woman going into the inner apartments to trade the newest style of sari;  
Dinu the goldsmith, who received a monthly wage, sitting in the room next to the lane, blowing his bellows and carrying out the orders of the family, now coming to the counting-house to present his bill to  
Kailash Mukherjee, who had a quill pen stuck behind his ear.  
The carder sits in the courtyard cleaning the mattress-stuffing on his twinging bow.  
Mukundalal, the durwan  was rolling outside on the ground with the one-eyed wrestler, trying out a new wrestling fall. He slapped his thighs loudly and repeated his movements twenty or thirty times, dropping on all fours.  
A crowd of beggars were waiting outside for their regular dole.

This was a regular routine Rabindranath witnessed and it became tedious.

#### Home-Schooling
After some oral education of songs, Ramayana, Mahabharata, Thakumar Jhuli etc Rabindranah got his first lesson from "Barnaparichyaya" from his home tutor Madhab Pandit. Rabindranath had a good memory and quickly finished the spelling lessons of "KARA, KHALA , JALA etc and came to short sentences --Jala Pare, Pata Nare. By this time his imagination had sparked and he thought that he was gradually entering into the area of  "Adi kabita of Adi Poet" and the line was continually vibrating through his mind --Jala Pare Pata Nare. 

Rabindranath was getting his education at home but when he saw that his elder brothers (Somendranath and Satyaprasad) were going to School he began to cry and wanted to go with them. At this Madhab Pandit got angry and slapped him and said that now he was crying for going to school, a time would come when he would cry to avoid going to school. 

Rabindranath said in his old age that the forecast made by his home tutor was the most accurate that he had come across in his life.


#### Schooling
He was admitted to the Oriental Seminary. (In 1823, Gourmohan Addya established the School. The school was running at that time in the house of Gorachand Basak of Garanhata). This was the first school he attended, along with his elder brothers Somendra and his nephew Satyaprasad. Rabindranath, Somendra (Rabindranath called him DADA) and Satyaprasad went to school together. He could not remember the lesson he got in the Oriental Seminary. He remembered only the punishment a student got for being unable to  answer any question about his home task. He was asked to stand up on the bench and extend both of his hands. Then slates, one after another, was kept on his extended hands.

After few days,  the guardians transferred  all the wards to Normal School, where the method of teaching was of European style. The school started after a prayer song.  One line in the song was -full of glee, singing merrily, merrily, merrily. This school was established under the guidance of Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar in 1855. At that time the School was held in Jorasanko, in the house of Shyamlal Mallik, very close to the Thakur bari.

Rabindranath expressed in his " Jibansmriti" that he was not happy at the School because of the rough behaviour of the teachers. The behaviour of one of the teachers was so nasty that he refused to answer any of his questions.

But he secured highest mark in the annual Bengali Examination taken by his Bengali teacher Madhusudan Bachaspati . The Class Teacher could not believe this and he complained to the Headmaster that Madhusudan Babu might have been partial. At this, Rabindranath was re-examined and the superintendant became the invigilator during the examination. The second time also Rabindranath secured the highest mark.

This was the only known result of an examination taken by Rabindranath during his student life.

#### Schooling
Rabindranath was admitted to the Normal School at the age of 7 years. Rabindranath wrote a short story, Ginni, remembering this school. After  one year when his age was about eight he was forced to write a poem by one of his nephews, Jyotyprakash Gangopadhyaya (1855-1919), son of Kadambini Devi (the eldest sister of Gunendranath). Jyotyprakash was six years older than Rabindranath. He was reading, at that time, English literature, especially Hamlet, and was always reciting the dialogues.

One day, in the day time, he called Rabindranath and said that he had to write a poem.  Jyotyprakash explained to Rabindranath the Payar Chanda containg 14 words in a line.

Rabindranath at that stage had seen poetry only in the books.  It appeared to him as neat and clean with no overwriting or scribbling in it. There was no hesitation. He could not imagine that he could write such a thing only by his mere will. However, he collected some blue papers with the help of an office staff of Tagore family, drew some lines, running in different directions, and tried to write something with his hand. Somendranath, the brother immediately elder to Rabindranath, became delighted with this and began collecting listeners for Rabindranath's potery. Somendra always encouraged Rabindranath to keep writing poetry and he acted as his oral publisher.  One day he caught Nabagopal Babu, the editor of "National Paper", and persuaded him to listen.  On hearing the poetry, Nabagopal Babu said it was alright but he could not understand the meaning of the word "DWIREF". Now the words  DWIREF and BHRAMAR,  in Bengali, both contained three letters, and why he used the former one and where from he got the word, Rabindranath could not recollect.

#### Schooling
Govinda Babu was the superindentent of Normal School. He was short, fat and dark. His office room was on the first floor. One day, Rabindranath entered in his room fearfully to report torture by some of the naughty boys of the school. Govinda Babu took pity on him and one day he called Rabindranath to his room and asked that whether he wrote poetry. Rabindranath was pleased and confirmed the rumour.  He asked Rabindranath to write a poem on some difficult topic. Rabindranath did so and brought the poem the next day. Govinda Babu took Rabindranath to the class and told him to read it. Rabindranath recited the poem loudly.

In 1871, Rabindranath was admitted to the Bengal Academy, an Anglo-Indian School.  
In the year 1872 when he was about 11 years old, he got the opportunity of going out of town for the first time due to a Dengue (1872-1873) epidemic in Calcutta.


All of them went to a garden-house at Panihati near the Ganges. In front of the servant's quarter there was a  guava tree and through  two of its branches  Rabi could see large boats  sailing  in the Ganges.

That blue coloured copy book was gradually being filled up with poetry and he always welcomed the news of its circulation.

Satkari Dutta was not a teacher in the class where  Rabindranath was reading but he was sympathetic to Rabindranath. One day he asked Rabindranath that whether he wrote poetry. On hearing in the affirmative he gave him two lines and asked him to fill up next two lines; Rabindranath did this nicely. Thus he gradually became known as a poet and he got a new avenue in his life which he maintained till his death.  

This time his  third elder brother Hemendranath, a good student in Science, was in charge of supervising their all round development. 

He narrated a daily routine to be followed by every body from morning till night. In the morning , after rising from  bed, they had to practice wrestling with an one eyed wrestler.+++(5)+++ Then they had to take their lessons with all the muds and sands in their body. The   home tutors for Bengali, Mathematics, History and Geography would come. Then they had to go to school. After coming back from the school, at about four,  they had to attend drawing classes with the drawing-master and then Gymnastics. In the evening followed English lessons. At this time they were about to fall asleep and the elder Brother Dwijendranath on seeing this allowed them to go to bed. Rabi , at this opportunity, used to go to his mother's room.

Every Sunday, Science teacher used to come with the apparatus for demonstrations. Rabi happened to get interested. The passion, Rabindranath had for science, was due to this. Moreover, for training in the Bengali literature Meghnad-bad-kabya was chosen. Rabindranath wrote a critical review of this book which was published in "Bharati".

Even in winter Rabindranath used to get up early in the morning when it was still dark and he shivered with the cold. He practised wrestling with the 'celebrated one-eyed'  wrestler. Their wrestling ground was on the north side of the outer room where there was once a greenery. The ground had been prepared by digging and loosening the earth to a depth of one cubit and pouring over it a mound of mustard oil. It was a mere child play for the wrestler to tangle with him. But Rabi's mother did not like this activity because her son's skin was becoming darkened and in holidays she used to scrub him top to bottom and treated him with cosmetics like almond paste, thickened cream, the rind of orange etc. Specially on Sunday morning, there was much rubbing and scrubbing on the veranda,
After coming from the wrestling ground there was a medical student waiting with a skeleton of the human body to teach them the names of the bones which were terribly difficult to remember.

As the clock struck 7, Master Nilkamal appeared to teach him Bengali, Arithmatic, Algebra and Geometry with the help of the black board. In the literature lesson he could quickly jump from Sitar Banabas to Meghnadhbadh Kabya. Along with this he had learned natural sciences. Sometimes Sitanath Dutta came to teach experiments in science with familiar things. Once Hiramba Tattnaratna, the Sanskrit scholar, came and taught them Mugdhobodh Sanskrit grammar, which they had to learn by heart without understanding anything.

After finishing the morning lessons, he had to go to school and returned at half past four. The gymnastic master came then and for about an hour he had to practise with parallel bars. He enjoyed other types of games also, with marbles, with bat-ball (a poor relation of cricket), top spinning, kite-flying-- all the lazy types of games.  Football was out of their reach.


The boys had to leave Normal School and be admitted in Bengal Academy, a European School, for their training in English. Here Rabindranath  got a friend who knew some tricks of magic. Rabindranath has mentioned his name in his book.

The interest of Rabindranath Tagore developed in books rather than in his study materials. He took books from his elder brother, Dwijendranath's library e.g.,   "Abodhbandhu" and Bividharta Sangraha. Rabindranath beacame a fan of poet Biharilal Chakraborty.

In 1872, at the age of eleven, Rabindranath finished "Bangadarshan" from beginning to the end.

#### upanayana
In Adi Brahmo Samaj the ritual of Sacred Thread ceremony was in vogue. Devendranath got the celebration done for his two youngest sons Somendranath and Rabindranath along with Satyaprasad, the son of his eldest daughter. It was in 1873, when Rabindranath was 11 years and 9 months old, but he took it seriously and observed all the rituals though it was not possible for him to follow all the meanings of the Mantras. Its influence lingered even in his old age.  He had become a Brahmin but with his shaved head  it became difficult for him to go to School. 

#### Travel with father
At this time his father offered to take him to the Himalayas,  which he accepted at once. He felt so excited that he wanted to express his willingness by shouting like a thunder.

This was the first time he would enjoy the  world outside and the company of his father which was also unknown to him. At first they went to Shantiniketan and stayed there for a few days. It was a mere village at that time in 1873. About 4-5 Kilometers away from Bolpur station, Devendranath had purchased 20 bighas of land and constructed a one storied building there with bricks and given it the name "Shantiniketan".   All around there were open meadows, an unfinished pond and at a distance there was a dam in Bhubandanga village and  rows of palm-trees, non-existent today.

Later on Devendranath established an Ashram and a temple there. This was the first outing for Rabindranath, in 1873, at the age of 11yrs and 9 months.

Devendranath used to stay away from home for his work and could not devote  time to his children. This was the quite the usual practice at that time-- for the father to keep himself at a respectable distance from the children. After coming to Bolpur, Rabindranath got the chance to come into close contact with his father and could help him out, such as winding his watch, keeping cash and accounts etc. He also got ample opportunity to roam around as he liked. The peaceful environment of Shantiniketan helped him in his creative work. In Shantiniketan, under a small coconut tree, he wrote a lyrical-drama, "Prthwiraj  Parajay", the manuscript of this book is lost. However, the lyrical-drama "Rudrachandra" might be of a similar type.

They left Bolpur after a few days and went to Amritsar, halting at several places - Sahibganj, Danapur, Allahabad, Kanpur etc.

At last they reached Amritsar of the Punjab. They stayed in a resort and used to visit Swarna Mandir almost every day and became pleased on hearing their songs and offered donations to the singers. He implemented in Shantiniketan these practices-- to read their holy book, Grantha Saheb, and the  Bhajan. This practice prevailed for long.

After staying for one month in Amrtisar, they went to Dalhousie in Himachal Pradesh.  The house they had taken at Bakrota was on the highest hill-top.  Though it was nearing May, it was still bitterly cold there, so much so that, on the shaded side of the hill, the winter frost had not yet melted.  Rabindranath's room was at one end of the house from where he could see through the uncurtained windows, the distant snowy peaks shimmering dimly in the starlight.

Rabindranath was allowed to move through the small lane in between two hills and pine-trees. Sometimes his father took him along with him along the hilly roads with Dandy. 

In the bangalow of Bakrota, Devendranath regularly gave lessons to Rabindranath in Sanskrit, English, and Astrology.  In the  Astrology book written in English, Devendranath showed Rabindranath the stars and planets in the open sky.

What he learnt from the English text and from his father, he put them in an eassay which was published in Tattwabodhini magazine in short form. Probably this was his first published essay.

#### Return to tutoring
After about a four-months' tour to the Himalayas, Rabindranath came back  home with one of the assistants of Devendranath and was placed in the "Andarmahal"- amongst his near and dear ones. When he was under the administration of the 'retinue of servants' which he termed  'servocracy' he had his foundation of learning. His third elder brother Hemendranath, strong in Science and Mathematics, believed that before learning English one must be sufficiently strong in one's mother tongue (in this case Bengali).  Since then English spellings and meanings did not lie heavily on his shoulder like a nightmare.

Until then , even when he was within the house the day long, still  he felt that he was in exile. Now he got his seat inside his mother's room and got his friend, the youngest daughter-in-law of the family, wife of Jyotirindranath named Kadambari, who also took him with love and affection because he was the youngest brother-in-law, the most beloved one.

But he, again, had to go to Bengal Academy which he did not like and felt as if he was being imprisoned within the four walls of a prison. He expressed his feeling in the poem "Abhilas" written at the age of eleven. The poem was published in "Tattwabodhini" in 1281 (Bangabda) without mentioning his name. The previous eassay on Astrology published in the same magazine was also without his name.

The number of days he could not attend the school gradually became more than  the number of days he attended the school. As a result, one home tutor, named Gnanchandra Bhattacharya, was appointed. He was meritorious and his method of teaching was also unique. He taught Kumarsambhab of Kalidas and Macbeth of Shakespeare in the original and opened a new world to the mind of the young poet.  The teacher forced the learners to translate those pieces in  other languages also.

One day Rabindranath had to go to Vidyasagar  to recite before him one such  translated piece. On seeing the number of books in  the library of Vidyasagar, Rabindranath became overwhelmed with joy.

At this time he used to  publish his eassays and poetry anonymously. The first poetry in his own name was "Hindu Melar Upahar" published  in Bi-lingual Amrita Bazar Patrika  in February 1875. His age at that time was 13 yrs and 8 months.

The meeting of the Hindumela usually took place at Parsibagan of Upper Circular Road: Rajnarayan Bose was its Presidsent.  Rabindranath wrote this poem imitating the poetry , "Bajre Shinga Bajre", written by Poet Hemchandra Bandyopadhaya. In those days, the Bengali elite had memorised the " Bharat Sangeet". Once Rabindranath recited in a meeting of the elite, another poem, 'Prakritir Khed", which was written by him and was also expressed uniquely the pathos of the country. This was published in "Pratibimba" magazine in 1282, Baishakh (Bangabda).

He also wrote a song "Jwal Jwal Chita" for the dramma "Sarojini" written by Jyotirindrannath. In this year, from Agrahayan, 1282 to Kartik 1283, he wrote a serial, "Banaphul".  

Rabindranath, since his childhood, had a powerful imagination. He imagined that the bearers of the palanquin carried him to a fancy world and passed through faraway strange lands and he gave each country a name from the books he read. His imagination took him through a deep forest  where tiger's eyes blazed. Sometimes his palanquin became a peacock-boat, floating on the ocean  until the shore was out of sight. The water splashed gently on to the shore, the waves winged and swelled around them.
Role of a teacher; 
Sometimes he assumed the role of a teacher. The railings of the veranda were his students. They were afraid of him. Some of them were very naughty and cared nothing for their books. He told them with dire threats that when they  grew up they would be fit for nothing but casual labor. They bore the marks of his beating from head to foot, yet they did not stop being naughty. They would only stop at the end of his game.

At this time, he also wrote a song, "Ek sutre Gnathiyachi sahasrati mon" for the secret organisation (patriotic) of his elder brothers, led by Jyotirindranath, of which he  was also a member.

Rabindranath's attendance at Bengal Academy did not improve. He was frequently absent on one lame excuse or another, even after returning from the Himalayas.  He was then admitted to St.Xevier's school along with his other brothers. But the result was the same. In the meantime, Sarada Devi, wife of Devendranath, died in 1875,  when Ranindranath was fourteen years old. At the death of such a well organised housewife of the family, every thing became disorderly. The elder sisters and sisters-in-law of Rabindranath, being sympathetic to him,  also did not press him to go to school.
At home, Rabindranath began to study Bengali books, Bengali magazines and anything which he could lay his hands on. Specially, he began to study Baishnab Padabali. As a result, he was not promoted to the next class after the end of the year. This led to the discontinuation of his going to school and that  was the end of his school education at the age of 14+ when he was reading fifth standard, i.e., class VI.

#### Schooling summary
The summary of his School education was as follows :

1. At the age of 5 - in 1866 - Rituals for first lesson was done along with Somendranath.
2. At the age of 7- in 1868- he was admitted to Oriental Seminary and then to Normal School.
3. At the age of 10- in 1871- he was transferred to Bengal Academy, an Anglo-Indian School with the intention of  acquiring a better vocabulary in English.
4. At the age of 13- in 1874- he was admitted to St. Xavier's School. The last Indian School where he was admitted.


#### Creative activity
Rabindranath started his creative activity after returning from the Himalayas.  His "Prakritir Khed" was published in "Pratibimba", edited by Pandit Ramsarbaswar in its 1st issue, 1st year, Baishakh, 1282 Bangabda (1875).  After a few months, Pratibimba amalgamated with Gnanankur. When he was a boy of 13+, he wrote in this magazine his first Novel in Poetry, Banaful as a serial. His elder brother Somendranath published it as a book in 1880. This book was not re-printed- it was included in the collection of Tagore's uncirculated work.

Gnanankur published some other Tagore's poem. It was only possible for Rabindranath to write in such a language at that age. .

Rabindranath began to write essays too at this stage. He wrote three essays- Bhuban Mohini Pratibha, Abasar Sarojini and Dukhyosangini in 1876 - in which he discussed the qualities of a  lyric, an epic and small poetry and said that "Banaful" was below the standard of  any of the three. These were the first essays written by Rabindranath.

While reading in Normal School, at the age of eight, Rabindranath began to practice writing poetry  under the influence of Jyoti, a son of a niece of the father of Rabindranath. He finished the "blue manuscript book" with the words "like the hive of some insect, with a network of variously slanting lines and the thin and thick strokes of letters.". When he was reading in Bengal Academy, in the year 1873, he went to Bolpur with his father Debendranath, enroute to Dalhousie,  and there he wrote a drama-"Prithwiraj Parajoy"  at the age of twelve, sitting under a coconut tree .. But the manuscript of the book was lost. Though it was similar to Rudrachandra, written after few days.. His attendance in school did not improve even after coming back from the Himalayas.. He was then at St. Xavier.s School in 1874. He translated in Bengali verse from  Kumar Sambhaba, the original book in Sanskrit and Macbeth in English. Some of these translations were published in Bharati, later on, .without mentioning his name. He also had to recite those translations in front of Vifdyasagar one day when he visited his place with Ramsarbaswa. At the age of twelve, his first poetry Abhilash was published in Tattwabodhini Patrika (in Agrahayan of 1796 Shakabda). He wrote a song "Jwal jwal chita, dwigun, dwigun." for the drama Sorojini of Jyodirindranath without mentioning his name.The first poetry, Hindu Melar Upahar ,mentioning his name of  was published in Bilingual magazine "Amrita Bazar Patrika " which was also recited by him in the  Annual Festival of Hindu Mela.. He was then thirteen years eight months. The poetry was written in the line of "baj re singa baj, ei rabe" written by Hemchandra Bandyopadhaya.He also wrote another poetry Prakritir Khed  which he read in a gathering of learned people person. The then Sadharani Patrika published the Prakritir Khed wrtten by Rabindranath was so alluring that the depressed condition of the country became visible when it was read in the gathering.It was published in Pratibimba edited by Pandit Ramsarbaswa..Gnanankur was amalgamated  with Pratibimba. "Banaful" , the first kabya-novel of Rabindranath, was published in serial in this magazine  from Agrahayan 1282- Kartik 1283..His age at that time was not more than thirteen when he wrote Banaful..Later on Somendranatjh, in March 1880, published it as a  Book.Some other short poem of boy Rabi was also published in  Gnanankur. Rabindranath also wrote Critical Essay at this stage (1876) in Gnanankur, .Bhuban Mohini Prtiva.  In a discussion about the thtee Kabyas "Mohini Mohan Prativa, Abasar Sarojini and Duukha Sangini " , he enunciated  the three forms,  a lyric, an epic and a short poem and proved that the three Kabyas were not upto the standard.Within the age of fifteen Rabindranath, showed his efficiencies   in writing Poetry, Kabya, Essay and in recitation, singing.   .  



#### Amdavad
About five years had elapsed since Rabindranath returned from the Himalayas and there was no sign of improvement in his formal education. The anxious guardians were wondering whether he might be sent to England for studying law but before that he was sent to Ahmedabad to his second elder brother, Satyendranath, to improve his English vocabulary.

Satyendranath stayed in a big house meant for the Judge at Shahibag, on the bank of Sabarmati River in Ahmedabad.  During the day, Satyendranath used to remain in the court and his wife and children were in London at that time. Rabindranath usually passed his time in the library reading books, specially in English with the help of a dictionary and using his imagination.

Simultaneously, he was writing articles for "Bharati" on various famous Eurpean writers. He roamed about the house from top to bottom and sang to himself.  His first music composition in music of a set of songs was created here- "Nirab rajani dyakho mogna jochanaya", "Boli o amar golap bala" and others.  He wrote poetry also which were simply translations of English poems.

But he could not develop  his vocabulary in English alone. He was removed to the house of a friend of Styendranath, Atmaram Panduranga, whose daughter, Anna, was well versed in English. Rabindranath was a poet and used to recite poems several times which the girl would commit to memory. One day, she asked Rabindranath to give her a name. Rabindranath gave her a name and wrote a poem using the word. Anna used to listen songs of Rabindranath almost everyday and they became closely acquainted. Rabindranath remembered her even in his old age.  In the "Shaishab Sangeet Kabya,"  there are references to  his close relationship with Anna.

#### UK
Rabindranath sailed for UK accompanying his second elder brother Stayendranath from Bombay boarding the Ship "Puna" on 20th Sept., 1878. Satyendranath took a long leave to stay in UK where his wife with two children had gone earlier. They first landed in Brindis, Italy, had a journey on land through the tunnel of Alps and went  to Paris. There they visited an art Exhibition, organised after the fall of the monarchy and establishment of  a Republic in France.

After reaching England they went straight to Brighton where Satyendranath's family stayed. Rabindranath saw the two beloved children (Surendranath and Indira) and was delighted. He stayed there and was admitted in a Public School. He made many friends (boys and girls) at the school, and attended a dance party on invitation. Every one loved this young handsome boy. He learnt many English songs also and was passing his time nicely.

One day Tarak Nath Palit, a High Court advocate and a friend of Satyendranath, came and asked Satyendranath to send him to London without further wasting time in a suburban  town.

He arranged everything and Rabindranath was brought to London and began to stay in a house in front of Regent Park. He began learning Latin from a private tutor and then he was taken to a teacher named Barker who used to prepare students for admission to College and University.

Ultimately, Rabindranath was admitted to London University  where he studied English literature from Prof. Henry Morley. He enjoyed this experience.  
At that time, he stayed as a boarder with the Scott family in London. Dr Scott  had  two girls. Both of them loved Rabindranath .  

He attended a session of the House of Commons to hear William Gladstone and John Bright who spoke on Irish Home Rule. He wrote a poem "Dui Din" here which was published in his "Sandhya Sangeet. " He wrote many letters "Europe Prabasir Patra" that was published in 1881. Here Rabindranath passed most of his time by writing essays on Western civilization, their attitude, behavior and sent them to be published in "Bharati". Reading all these essays, his guardians asked him to come back to India. He came back to India after about one and half years without obtaining any degree or passing any formal examination.


#### Return
There was a second attempt at sending him to England. 

It was settled that this time Satyaprasad, son of his elder sister,  would accompany him. Satyaprasad had been recently married and after reaching Madras they changed their mind and decided to return home.

They went to Mussouri to see Devendranath who accepted their decision without recriminations.

#### Paintings
Rabindranath learnt drawing in his childhood and was attracted to the sketches drawn by his elder brother Jyotirindranath.
In 1924, while writing Purabi  he started doodling on the pages of his manuscript. Thus, Rabindranath Tagore's famous world appearence as painter in France in 1930 was not sudden. Long before the Paris exhibition which catapaulted him to worldwide  fame, in 1926, Tagore had long discussions on his art with Romain Rolland. Himself a Nobel Laureate, Romain Rolland wrote in his book "Inde-Journal" on 3rd July, 1926, that  Tagore had been discussing on his application of colour in paintings. He likes very little red colour, the dominance of red colour in Italian village did not attract him. His love was for violet and blue, and for green. Tagore had discussions about art with another Nobel laureate, French Poet, St John Perse, over their several meetings in 1920s.

Rabindranath transformed his lack of formal training into an advantage and opened new horizons in the use of line and colour. He was prolific in his paintings and sketches as he was in his writing, producing over 2500 of these within a decade. Over 1500 of them are preserved in Viswa Bharati, Santiniketan. 

#### Summary
Rabindranath's formal education was brief. He had changed schools four times (Oriental Seminary, Normal School, Bengal Academy, St. Xavier's School) in eight years (1868-1876). Then he tried to study law in UK for about two years (1878-1880) and came back home without obtaining any degree. He again attempted to go to England but after reaching Madras he changed his mind. To become a graduate one has to undergo 10+2+2=14 years of study. But he had undergone only 10 years of study and did not secure any formal diploma.

During this time, however, he did not spoil any single moment. He followed  strictly a daily time table from morning till night and was tutored at home by his brothers (Hemendranath and Dwijendranath) and by his father, Devendranath during journey to Dalhousie and 20 private tutors on different subjects including wrestling, swimming, trekking. He was so equipped during this time that he could translate Kumarsambhaba from Sanskrit to Bengali  and Macbeth from English to Bengali, both in verse. He had filled up a Blue Book obtained from the office of the Tagore family with own written verses at the age of eight and started his life in literary work both as a  writer and a performer and established himself as a poet, a singer, a playwriter, a musician.

#### Poetry
abindranath started writing alphabets in 1866 at the age 5, he was admitted to school, first in Oriental Seminary and then to Normal Schhol in 1868 at the age of seven, and he started writing poetry in 1869 at the age of eight, just after  one year of attending Normal School. He was urged by his elder brother, Somendranath, to recite these poems to people in the mansion - including a  Brahmo Nationalist, a news paper editor and organizer of Hindu Mela. He became known as a poet in Normal School where he impressed his teachers of his ability in writing poetry.
He was born in an atmosphere where literary magazines were published, musical recitals were held, and theatre performed. He was influenced by his elder brothers like Dwijendranath, Satyendranath, Jyotirindranath, Hemendranath and others who were always engaged in literary and cultural activities.
In 1874, at th age of thirteen, his first  poem Abhilash (desire) was published under the alias, Bhanu Singha.

In the opinion of Rabindranath there should be freedom of reading even to the boys. He was not in favor of putting  any bar of age to readers. Might be that the juniors were not in a position to understand the difficult portion of the text. In boyhood days he used to read all the books, magazines, even those which he might  not understand. He tried to follow the meaning with his imagination.
There was a big library of old books and magazines in Thakur Bari,  kept under lock and key for safety. Rabindranath managed to get the key  and open the almirah. He was in the habit reading  books and magazines. He read BIBIDHA BHARATI SANGRAHA of Rajendra Lal Mitra, Novel of Krishnakumari, books of Science and Anthropology, a small paper ABODH BANDHU and Banga Darshan of Bankim Chandra. He was fond of reading classical books of Sarada Charan Mitra and Akshoy Sarker  and of Bidyapati written in Maithali language. He used to collect all the magazines of which Dwijendranath and Jyotirindranath were customers and read them. He also took notes of the difficult portions from those writings.
He gathered, by this time, a vast knowledge in Bengali, Sanskrit, and English by learning at home.
He got Akshoy Chandra Choudhury, a friend of Jyotirindranath, as his beloved guide for Bengali literature of Baishnabpadabali, Kabikankan, Ramprasad, Bharatchandra, Haruthakur, Rambasu, Nidhubabu, Sreedhar etc.   

(Help was taken from the essay written by Sushil Roy in Jiban Smriti). In 1874, he completed a long poem in the Maithili style pioneered by Vidyapati. Published pseudonymously, experts accepted them as the lost works of Bhanusingha, a newly discovered 17th century Vaisnava poet. It had already been said that Rabindranath had a keen interest in old Vaishnava poems which were being collected and published by Babu Akshay Sarker and Sarada Mitter. The language, largely mixed with Maithili, was difficult to understand, but for that very reason Rabindranath took more pains to get at their meaning. His feeling towards the poems were as if they were ungerminated sprout within  the seed, or an undiscovered mystery under the dust covering of the earth. Buoyed with the hope of bringing to light some unknown poetical gems, he went deeper and deeper into the unexplored darkness of he treasure-house. Then he came upon the idea of writing in the same styile--  in such a wrapping of mystery.  As he heard from Akshoy Choudhury the story of the English  boy-poet Chatterton. Though he had no idea about the writings nor had Akshoy Babu given any details about the poet,  the unknown and untold story didn't lose its hidden charm. The melodramatic element in it which fired his imagination was sufficient.           
One noon in a cloudy weather lying prone on his bed in his inner room he wrote in maithili,   "Gahana kusuma kunja majhe"and became delighted to be able to write such a line. One day he mentioned to one of his friend: "A tattered old manuscript has been discovered while rummaging in the ADI BRAHMA SAMAJ library and from this he has coppied some poems by an old Vaishnava poet named Bhanu Singha". The friend was excited and  said that  " these could not have been written even by Vidyapati or Chandidas" . Then Rabindranath showed him his manuscript and said these could not have been written by Vidyapati or Chandidas because he himself had written these.When these poems in the name of Bhanu Singha was gradually coming out in Bharati, Dr. Nishikanta Chatterjee was in Germany. He wrote a Thesis on the lyric of our country comparing with that of Europe. Bhanu Singha was given a place of honour as one of the old poets such as no  modern writer could have aspired to. This was the thesis on which Nishikanta got his Ph.D.
It was at that time a matter of discussion  amongst the elites about this Bhanu Singha and his period of existence. In the opinion of Panchkari Babu, Bhanu Singh might have been born before 451 BC, Nitai Charan Babu said he was born some times in between 1104 AD to 1799 AD, Kalachand De said thatBhanu Singha was born either before 819 BC or after 1639. Ultimately Rabindranath pointed out the mistakes of every one that Bhanu Singh was born in 1861 because he himself took the name of Bhanu Singha.

Rabindranath was a poet . He mentioned, "I say again and again that I am a poet, that I am not a fighter by nature."  No doubt that he was first of all a poet and he wrote more than thousand poems, more than fifty Kabya Granthas and constructed more than two thousands songs of which he wrote both the words and the music. But he contributed over thousand essays on literary, social, religious, political, and on other topics. he also contributed in all the branches of literary activities and wrote innumerable letters to his relatives, known and unkown friends. A detailed work of Rabindranath had been tabulated in the margin.
