## भट्ट-नारायणः
At about 8th or 10th century AD, five Kulin Brahmin came to Bengal from Kanyakubja ( Uttar Pradesh) at the invitation of a King, named AdiShur. Bhattanarayan was the son of Kshitish of Sandilya Gotra.  
Din, son of Bhattanarayan,  received a gift of land at Kushgram in the district of Burdwan,  and got the surname Kushari giving up his own title Bandyapadhayaya.  
After the 8th or 10th generation, Jagannath was born. 

## जगन्नाथः
Daksha was the first person in the clan of the Roychoudhurys of the Kashyap Gotra. Dakshinanath, born after 12th generation of Daksha, had three sons. Sukdev, Kamdev and Joydev. Amongst them Kamdev and Joydev were forcibly converted to Islam by a Mahammadan. Sukdev, though he did not convert, maintained his relationship with Kamdev and Joydev, later known as Kamaluddin and Jamaluddin, and became known as Pir-Ali Brahmin, meaning boycotted Brahmin. Any Brahmin with any kind of relation with Sukdev would come to be termed a Pir-Ali Brahmin. 

Jagannath Kushari married a daughter of Sukdev and was gifted land at Dakshindihi of Khulna district and began to live there. Jagannath Kushari, thus having entered a matrimonial relationship with Sukdev, also became known as Pir-Ali Brahmin. 

## पञ्चाननः
After a few generations, Panchanan was born in the the Kushari family. But due to some family troubles, Panchanan along with his uncle Sukdev came by boat on the Ganges to a place known as Govindapur. 

Some fishermen lived there. Panchanan and his uncle were the only Brahmins there and the fishermen, respectfully, called them 'Thakur', a name later pronounced as 'Tagore' by Europeans. Henceforth, Panchanan and his uncle became known as Thakur, giving up their surname, Kushari. Panchanan Kushari became known as Panchanan Thakur. But they followed the rites and customs of Kulin Brahmins in the case of marriage or any other social function. Panchanan used to supply  goods to the captains of the Ships.  His son Joyram earned a great deal of money in this way. He became a surveyor of the East India Company. Joyram died on 1756.

Provat Mukhopadhyaya, in his book Rabindra Jiban Katha, wrote that during marriage they had to search for girls from Jessore or Khulna. 

Even  Rabindranath was married to Bhabatarini, later known as Mrinalini, the daughter of one of the clerks of the Tagore family of Khulna district who was also a Pir-Ali Brahmin. 


Among the four sons of Joyram+++(=??)+++, Nilmoni and Darpanarayan were two prominent persons. In 1765, East India Company got the charge of collectorates of Revenues of Bengal. Nilmoni was appointed in the office of the collectorate of Orissa and gradually his earnings grew.

## Pathuriaghata family
Darpanarayan Tagore (1731-1791) was the first person in the family to earn through the money-lending business. But he had some dispute with Nilmoni who shifted his family to Mechuabazar (Jorasanko) and settled there. The other members of the family settled in Pathuriaghat, Kailaghata, and Chorbagan when Govindapur was razed by the British for the construction of the new Fort William.

### Gopimohan Tagore
Gopimohan Tagore (1760-1819), was well known for his wealth and in 1822 made what may be the largest ever gift of gold to the Kali temple at Kalighat. He was one of the founders of Hindu College. He knew English, French, Portuguese, Sanskrit, Persian and Urdu.

### Prasanna Kumar Tagore
Prasanna Kumar Tagore (1801-1868), son of Gopimohan was one of the leaders of the Landholders' Society and the president of the British Indian Association, the earliest organisation of Indians in British India. He was the founder of the first local theatre- The Hindu Theatre. He was also the first Indian to be appointed to the Viceregal Legislative Council. Jatindramohan Tagore (1831-1908), the son of Hara Kumar Tagore (1798-1858), and grand son of Gopimohan Tagore, was a theatre enthusiast, art-lover, and philanthropist. He started Banga Natya Mela. He constructed the first house on the land where Tagore Castle now stands at 26, Prasanna Kumar Tagore Street in Pathuriaghata.      

There stands on the Strand Road, facing the Hooghly, an old and yellowish dilapidated building with its imposing frontage designed as a replica of the Temple of Minerva in Athens. Kolkata's old Silver Mint, a land mark that has seen the city change dramatically over the past 184 years. The peeling plaster of the walls and wild growth of plants fail to veil the grandeur of the Doric columns of the Mint. Giving company to this grand structure is the historic Tagore Castle at Pathuriaghata, which was built by Darpanarayan Tagore, great grandfather of Nobel Laureate poet Rabindranath Tagore of Jorasanko Thakurbari which was located in its vicinity. In the early years of 1800s, this area used to be bustling with commercial activities of street vendors and traders.

## Jorasanko Thakurbari, Sovabazar Rajbari
In those days, Tagore Castle, Jorasanko Thakurbari, and at some little distance, Sovabazar Rajbari- all located on the embankment of the hooghly- attracted a great deal of public interest. But nowadays, except Jorasanko, the birth place of Tagore, all these buildings are in bad shape.  It was said that Raja Nabakrishna of Sovabazar, Prince Dwarakanath Tagore of Jorasanko and Raja Prasanna Thakur of Pathuriaghata- the three outstanding personalities of the Bengal renaissance- had played a pioneering role in the establishment of the old Silver Mint in the Business area. The Mint was of great importance since it was the only one that produced silver coins. As many as 3,00,000 to 6,00,000 siver coins were manufactured daily. Gold, Copper and Bronze coins were also made here. The facility of manufacturing medals was also available. 

The old yellowish Greecian structure that was once the old Mint complex of Kolkata, was built on an area of 12.5 acres of  land. Its foundation stone was laid in March 1824, and it became operational from 1 August 1829. It ceased to function in 1972. Official records revealed that the first mint in Calcutta was constructed in 1759.

The government undertook to protect all these places as heritages of India.

Nilmoni Thakur was the first person who in 1784, during the time of Warren Hastings, purchased a plot of land on the east side of Chitpur Road and constructed a building there. It was known as Mechhuabazar at that time, later it was renamed as Jorasanko.

Dwarakanath constructed another building by the side of his paternal house where he used to arrange dinner parties for his European friends, ladies and gentlemen.  Ganganendranath and Abaninidranth used to stay there.  The main portion of this building was damaged and the rest was utilized as a campus of the Viswa Bharati University.


The old house was not constructed all at a time, rather it was extended as and when required without having a definite plan. As a result it was built at various levels and made to bend according to necessity with staircases here and there, coming to look a bit like a jigsaw puzzle. It was a great wonder to Rabindranath when he was a child.  

## Jorasanko family
### Dwarakanath Tagore
Nilmoni's son Ramlochan, a rich banea and businessman had adopted Dwarakanath.

The Jorasanko Family: Dwarakanath Tagore (1794-1846) was the man who ushered the family into its special role in the history and culture of Bengal. He was the second son of  Rammani Tagore (second son of Nilmoni), but was adopted by the childless elder son, Ramlochan Tagore. He, not only inherited the great wealth of the Jorasanko family but also built up an extensive business empire even  while he worked as sheristadar, the highest position then open to Indians. He was a luxury loving prodigal. 

The contemporaries called him a prince because he had been to Britain where he was first described as a prince by the people coming in contact with him and also because of his lifestyle in Britain and Calcutta marked with princely grandeur and influence. Dwarakanath was one of those Baneans and mutsuddis  who were the first generation of the Bengali entrepreneurs and socio-political activists. The first Thakur to leave the parental home in Dakshindihi, Khulna, and join the rank of banians to the Europeans, was  Panchanan who worked with the French as a banian in the late 17th. century.

Dwarakanath Thakur, affluent enough to leave the low lying ancestral home at Pathuriaghata built by Joyram, constructed a colourful new home at Jorasanko where Rabindranath Tagore was born and brought up. 

The family name Thakur is said to have been conferred by the people of the fishing village, Govindapur, who felt to have been privileged by being served by the Pirali Brahmins ritually. However, the members of the Thakur family proved to be immensely entrepreneurial. But still, Dwarakanath Tagore suffered a sense of injury resulting from the indignity that other superior Brahmins had inflicted on them. No member of the Thakur family, including even Rabindranath, could set up any matrimonial connection with the superior Brahmin families due to alleged caste inferiority.

Under Robert Gutlar Fergusson, a british advocate, Dwarakanath learnt, as an apprentice, the laws of the Permanent Settlement and also the laws and procedures of the supreme court of Calcutta, Sadr and Zila courts and started his legal career very successfully in 1815. Soon, he started expanding the modest Zamindari estate that he inherited from his father, Ramlochan.  In 1830 Dwarakanath bought in auction the Kaligram zamindari in Rajshahi district and, in 1834, Shahazadpur in Pabna district. His zamindari had many partners and co-purchasers. But he himself held four large estates- Berhampur, Pandua, Kaligram and Shahazadpur- without partners and he placed them in trust for his sons and their descendants in 1840. 

He put his Zamindari management under several European experts. Dwarakanath made a fortune from his lucrative service as a serestadar (1828) and later diwan, the Board of Customs, Salt and Opium. He served for twelve years as diwan and had a money-lending business to salt manufacturers and others.  In addition to money-lending, he invested his money in the famous concern, Mackintosh and Company. He also had shares in the Union Bank when it was established in 1829.

In 1835, Government honoured him with the post of Justice of Peace, an honorary position newly opened to Indians at that time. He had investments in shipping , export trade, insurance, banking, coal mines, indigo, urban real estates and in zamindari estates.

#### EU visits
He often visited Britain like his friend and philosopher Raja Rammohan Roy. 

On 9 Jan 1842, Dwarakanath boarded his own steamer, the India, for the Suez. His European Physician, Dr. MacGowan, his nephew Chandra Mohan Chatterjee, his aide-de-camp, Paramananda Moitra, three Hindu servants and a Muslim cook accompanied him. In London, the British Prime Minister, Robert Peel (in office from December 1834 to April 1835 and June 1841 to June 1846) President of the Board of Control, Lord Fitzgerald, Prince Albert, Dutchess of Kent, Queen Victoria and others received him. (Pictures from top to bottom).

He spent 23 June with the Queen, reviewing troops. On 8 July, he was invited to a dinner with the Queen. The Queen noted in her diary, "The Brahmin speaks English remarkably well, and is a very intelligent, interesting man" (Queen Victoria's journal, 8 July 1842 ).

Dwarakanath left England on 15 October for Paris.

Dwarakanath left England on 15 October for Paris, where he was received by the French King, Louis-Philipe at St. Cloudon on 28 October. He returned to Calcutta in December 1842. 

#### Recession
The business recession of the early 1840s and his newly acquired princely life-style led to the collapse of his business empire and mired him in debt. The accumulated debt at his death was so huge that it took his son, Devendranath Thakur, almost all his life to free the family from encumberances. It was not only Dwarakanath's business that went into the red in the hard days of early 1840s, but many others like him were ruined due to the depression. Dwarakanath was the product of the depression of 1830-33 and victim of that of the 1840s. But his greatest success lies elsewhere . Collaboration in trade and commerce with the Europeans had long established precedents, but never before had a Bengali received recognition from them as an equal partner. Dwarakanath had broken that tradition and become an equal "partner in empire" by his own right.

#### Depression of the 1840s  
The depression of the 1840s, experienced Australia-wide, was a major halt to rapid economic growth in Van Diemens Land. The continued low price of wood in the London market after 1837, the 1839 English recession, the collapse of the mainland markets for grain and livestock, and the downturn of Tasmanian Capital invested in Port Phillip speculations led to the depression. Goods piled up in shops as lower earning power led to reduced spending . The influx of British capital ceased. Banks restricted credit. By 1843, bankrupcies no longer involved small retail traders and merchants alone, but extended to landed interests. Two Banks were closed.  


Dwarakanath was firm in defending the interest and sentiments of his people against European prejudices. He was one of those who took the role of spokesman of freedom of India abroad. He established on 21 March 1838 an Association for landholders (later known as Landholders' Society). The association was overtly a self-serving political association, founded on a large and liberal basis, to admit landholders of all descriptions, Englishmen, Hindus, Muslims, Christians. It was interesting to note that he along with Raja Radhakanta Dev founded the Gaudiya Sabha, the first political association in India to ventilate in a constitutional manner the grievances of the people or the section of them that were outspoken. From this grew the British India Association, the precursor to the Indian National Congress.  

Dwarakanath Tagore died on the evening of Saturday, 1 August 1846, at the St. George's Hotel in London during a tremendous thunderstorm, the likes of which had not been seen for many years. The London Mail of 7 August wrote of him, "descended from the highest Brahmin caste of India, his family can prove a long and undoubted pedigree."  

### Devendranath Thakur
Devendranath Tagore (15 May 1817- 19 January 1905) was an Indian Philosopher in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries from United Bengal in British India.

He  was born in Jorasanko, Calcutta and was the eldest son of his father, Dwarakanath. Being the son of a person known as prince, he was brought up in the lap of luxury surrounded by pomp and power. But  early in his youth the family fell into misfortune due to the economic depression in the 1840s and the life style of his father Prince Dwarakanath Tagore, who died on the evening of 1 August 1846 at the St. George's Hotel in London, leaving a huge debt. Devendranath, however, managed to repay all the loans and was, even, able to retain some of his property by intelligent management and a modest style of living.  He worked as a priest.

One day he came to learn a sloka from Ishaponishad written by Ram Chandra Vidyasagar which said  that "God is immanent in all things, in whatsoever lives and moves in the Universe, enjoy therefore without being attached, covet not wealth belonging to the others". From that day the course of his life was changed forever.

#### Tattwabodhini Sabha :
Along with the awakening of the soul, the influence of Raja Rammohan Roy was of immense significance. In October 1839, he, along with his friends, started the Tattva-ranjini Sabha. Its object was the dissemination of the knowledge of the Upanishads and the promotion of religious enquiry.  In two years there were 500 members including rich and influential men of Bengal. 

Pt. Ishwarchandra Vidyasagar was for some time the secretary of this Sabha. It was the largest and most influential cultural organisation of Bengal and it lasted till 1854. 


#### Tattvabodhini Patrika
It also had a printing press and Devendranath  started publishing the Tattvabodhini Patrika. This Patrika became the principal organ of the samaj for propagating its views. It taught men to think seriously and speak earnestly. It inaugurated the era of earnest journalism in Bengal. It was published in 5 different languages from five different centers- in  Bengali from Calcutta, in Tamil and English from Madras, and in Hindi and Urdu from Bareily.

Tattwabodhini Patrika was the organ of  Tattwabodhini Sabha. The journal was first published on 16th August 1843 from Calcutta to propagate the Brahmo faith and to enable regular contact among members of  Tattwabodhini Sabha. Akshoy Kumar Dutta was the first editor, and Debendranath Tagore was charged with its overall supervision. The best known prose writers of the 19th century- Iswar Chandra Vidyasagar, Rajnarayan Basu, Debendranath Tagore- contributed regularly to the journal, spawning a new epoch in Bangla language  and literature. All its contributors and patrons were reformists.

Tattwabodhini Patrika played a key role in the propagation of Brahmoism in Eastern Bengal. Brajasundar Mitra, initiator of the Brahmo Samaj in Dhaka, was attracted to this faith by reading the journal .Debendranath Tagore wanted to limit the journal to purely religious issues but Akshoy Kumar Dutta, the editor, extended it to scientific issues to place the journal at a high level. A committee was formed with Rajnarayan Basu, Anandakrishna Basu, Shridhar Nyayaratna, Radhaprasad Roy (son of Rammohan Roy), Debendranath Tagore and others for selecting articles for the journal.

Tattwabodhini Patrika was published upto 1932. After Akshoy Kumar Dutta it was edited at different times by Nabin Chandra Banerjee, Satyendranath Tagore, Ayodhya nath Pakrashi, Hemchandra Vidyaratna, Dwijendranath Tagore, Rabindranath Tagore and Kshitindranath Tagore.


#### Brahmo Sabha
In 1843, Devendranath started the Tattwabodhini Patrika as mouthpiece of the Tattwabodhini Sabha. In the same year, he revived the Brahmo Sabha fallen in vigour since the death of Rammohan (1774-1833) in 1833. The Brahmo Sabha was originally absorbed into the Tattwabodhini Sabha and renamed as Calcutta Brahmo Samaj. Devendranath took 20 of his young associates who joined him on 21 December 1843 (7 Paush, 1765 B.E.). This led the step for converting Brahmo Samaj into a spiritual fraternity. This day is still commemorated with the annual Paush mela at Santiniketan. 

#### Shantiniketan
The history of the place goes back to the 1860s, when Devendranath was struck by the beauty of the place of Shantiniketan, the western most corner of Bengal in Birbhum with red laterite soil, watered by several rain-fed rivulets. Passing through the village commons of Bhuvandanga (an area avoided by travellors because of dacoits), Maharshi was captivated by the beauty of two luxuriantly canopied Chattim trees, offering shade in that barren red land. To the Maharshi this was an idyllic venue for meditating. So he bought a large tract of land along with the two Chhatim trees and built a beautiful prayer hall with stained glass. Trees were planted all around to achieve the ancient forest-ashram look. In keeping with the spirit of the place, Maharshi named it "Shantiniketan" or 'the abode of peace'.

Devendranath's spiritual prowess was of the highest order, even while he maintained his worldly affairs not renouncing his material possessions as some Hindu traditions prescribed but rather continuing to enjoy them in a spirit of detachment.

His considerable material property included several estates spread over the districts of Bengal, most famously, the later acquisition Santiniketan Estate near Bolpur  in the Birbhum district  where his eldest son Rabindranath Tagore set up his school.

Devendranath was a master of the Upanishads and played no small role in the education and cultivation of faculties of his sons.

Dwijendranath (11 March-1840-19 Jan 1926) was a poet, a composer, philosopher, mathematician, and a pioneer in Bengali shorthand  and musical notations:

#### Daughters

Devendranath's daughters were Soudamini, Saratkumari, Swarnakumari, and Brahmakumari. Soudamini was the first student of Bethune school and gifted writer. Swarnakumari was also a gifted writer, editor, song-composer and social worker. All of them were famous for their beauty and education.

### dvijendranAth
Dwijendranath Thakur (11 March 1840 - 19 Jan 1926) the eldest son of Debendranath Thakur and grandson of Dwarakanath Thakur was born in Kolkata (Calcutta) on 11 March 1840. He was a poet, song composer, philosopher, mathematician, and a pioneer in Bengali shorthand and musical notation. He was mainly educated at home, but later he studied for some time in St. Paul's School and Hindu College of Kolkata. He was always close to his younger brother Satyendranath (1842 - 1923) but the two brothers differed considerably. Dwijendranath was comfortable with the traditions of the society, while Satyendranath enjoyed breaking down conservative rules to establish a modern society. Dwijendranath spent his time in cultivating poetry, acquiring knowledge and conducting various experiments.

His wife, Sarbasundari, died at an early age and he remained widower through out the rest of his life.

#### Contribution to Bengali Literature :

His first contribution to Bengali literature was the Bengali translation of Kaildasa's classical Sanskrit work Meghadut in 1860 before the  birth of his younger brother Rabindranath. It was the first time that that the great sanskrit poetic work was translated into Bengali. He had used two different Bengali rythmic styles for the translation.

Dwijendranath's second great work of poetry Swapnaprayan, published in  1875. This novel-poetry describes the travels of a young man to different places. Prabhat Mukhopadhayaya in his book Rabindrajiban Katha mentioned  when Dwijendranath was writing Swapnaprayan and was reciting the book  in front of his friends, Rabindranath was a boy noticing all this standing by the side of a door. Dwijendranath had displayed a remarkable control over the use of different rhythmic styles in the book. The book has a historic value.

It was an age when Michael Madhusudan influenced all Bengali poets but Dwijendranath was free from any such impact. On the other hand, Michael Madhusudan had hailed Dwijendranath as a poet of the future. Dwijendranath was 'a true philosopher'. He consorted with the learned of the National Society and the Biddwajjan-Samagam, both of which he had organised. Rabindranath came back from England in 1880 and after coming from England he found that a get-together had been arranged where renowned persons would be coming from Calcutta.  Rabindranath was given the charge of writing a drama  to be staged before the audience. He wrote Balmiki Prativa and he himself took the role of Valmiki. The lyrical-dramma was excellent and the performance was grand.  Dwijendranath delved deep into the philosophy of the Bhagabad Gita.

Dwijendranath on the chair and Rabindranath sitting by his side.

The philosophical work, Tattwabidya (Knowledge of Principles), published in three vols between 1866 and 1868, was a pioneering effort in Bengali literature. Never before had such a work been published. In 1896, he published Adwaita Mather Samalochana (Criticism of Adwaita Phlosophy) and in 1899, Aryadharma O Boudhya Darmer Ghat-Pratighat (a book on the conflicts of aryan religion, Hinduism, and Buddhism). 

He edited Tattwabodhini Patrika for 25 years from 1884 and was  a founder of Hitabadi. He was keen on extending Tattwabodhini Patrika but his younger brother Jyotirindranath (1849-1925) proposed a new magazine Bharati and made Dwijendranath the editor. Rabindranath was 16 years at that time and was not left out of the editorial board of the magazine, Bharati. In the first year Kabikahini of Rabindranath was being published in serial.

To acknowledge the contribution of Dwijendranath to Bengali literature, he was elected President of Bangiya Sahitya Parishad from 1897 to 1900. He presided over the 1914  session of the Bangiya Sahitya Sammelan.

He was a Zamindar who always remained absent from his Zamandari, but in 1873, he advocated drastic action for "the restoration of order and tranquility " against peasants participating in the Pabna disturbances, which was severely curtailing his income.

Dwijendranath kept himself always busy with experiments of various types. He was a pioneer in the field of Bengali short hand and even coded  it in the form of poetry. He pioneered the use of notations (swaralipi) for Bengali music. The only other person who could claim credit for this was Kshetramahon Goswami, assistant to Raja Shourindramohan Tagore. In 913, he wrote a book Boxometry, the construction of boxes.He was adept in folding paper into different shapes.

He was secretary of the Adi Brahmo Samaj from 1866 to 1871 and used to serve as  Acharya or minister for Upasanas or Brahmo Prayers. He had accompanied his father to Dakha when Dhaka Brahmo Samaj was in its formative years under the leadership of Braja Sundar Mitra.

Closely associated with Hindu Mela, he was its secretary and composed patriotic songs for it. One of its devotional song , karo tomar naam gaan, jata din rahe dehe pran (sing his praise as long as there is life in the body) has been sung with the prayers on 7th of Poush for many years. He wrote many other devotional songs broadly classified as Brahmasangeet, sung with prayers of Brahmo Samaj.  One popular patriotic song he composed for the Hindu Mela was "malina mukhochandrama Bharat tomari" (pale is your face, o India).


#### shAntiniketan
History : Shantiniketan was previously called Bhubandanga (named after Bhuban Dakat, a local dacoit).   Devendranath Thakur, father of Dwijendranath, visited the place in 1861 and found it very peaceful, suitable for meditation and other Aradhana purpose. He purchased 20 bighas of land of Bhubandanga village from Singha family of Roypur under Bolpur Mouja in 1863 and renamed it as Shantiniketan, which means 'abode of peace' . He  used to visit the place occasionally and took Rabindranath  there for the first time in 1873 and stayed for some time, enroute to Dalhouse.

The weather in Shantiniketan is usually a peasant one although one might come across the changes of weather in summer, winter and rainy season. Nonetheless spring has its own charm, not only because of its natural beauty blooming to its fullest amidst the lush greenary but also due to the famous Vasanta utsab held to mark the festival of Holi with the on set of spring..

Rabindranath founded a school at Shantiniketan in 1901with five student.He took Rabindranath for the first time

Dwijendranath spent the last 20 years of his life in Shantiniketan, in oneness with nature for learning and writing. He wrote humorous four-line rhymes on people in Shantiniketan, which were published in Shanti- niketan Patrika. His sense of humor  was a talking point for many years. His friendship with sparrows, squirrels, and crows became legends in Shantiniketan.

He followed the advice of the Upanishads - after acquiring knowledge remain a child at heart. He read his papers at the majlis or gathering of learned men, including Rabindranath. There were an assembly of learned persons like Bidhushekhar Sastri, Kshitimohan Sen. Mahatma Gandhi and C.F.Andrews used to call Dwijendranath bardada like Rabindranath Thakur.


Apart from editing he had his own publication. In Bengali Bhratribhab (1863), Tattwabidya (1866-68), Sonar kathi Rupor kathi (1885), Sonay Sohaga ( 1885), Aryami ebong Sahebiyana (1890), Samajik Roger Kaviraji Chikitsa (1891), Adaitya- mater Samalochana (1896), Brahmagnan O Brahmasadhana (1900), Banger Rangabhumi (1907), Haramanir Anwesan (1908), Gitapather Bhumika (1915), and Prabandhmala (1920), in English : Boxometry (of Mathematics)-1913, Ontology (1871), a book on Geometry.He published innumerable writings in different magazines such as Jnankur, Pratibimbo, Tattwabodhini, Barati, Sadhana, new look Bangadarshan, Manasi, Sahitya Parishad Patrika, Santiniketan, Budhbar, Shreyasi, Prabasi, Sabujpatra, and Supravat. This is simply a quantitave estimate and not a qualitative one.

#### Descendants 

Dwijendranath had five sons--1. Dipendranath, 2. Arunendranath, 3. Nitindranath, 4. Sudhindranath, 5. and Kripendra.

Amongst his sons- Sudhindranath (1869-1929) was a talented author. he wrote poems, novels, and short Stories. He introduced a new literary magazine, Sadhana in 1891 and was its first editor. Later, Rabindranath edited it and subsequently it was merged with Bharati .

Amongst his grand sons, Dinendranath (1882-1935), son of Dipendranath, had exceptional talent of music. He could remember the tune of any song he heard once. Rabindranath used to compose tunes of the songs he wrote but found it difficult to remember and codify them. He used to call Dinendranath to do the job and develop notations. Rabindranath called him "store keeper of his songs."

Soumendranath Tagore (1910-1974), son of Sudhindranath , was a great orator. He was an icon of cultural arena in the 1960s and 1970s. he was associated with the communist movement from his younger days.    

#### Hindu Mela
Hindu Mela was a socio-cultural organisation aimed at reviving the glory of Indian civilisation, mobilise the Hindus, especially the youth, and to cultivate the national language and ideas, so as to fight the cultural colonisation of British. This organisation was mainly supported by several members of the Tagore family, Rajnarayan Basu and Nabagopal Mitra (the editor of the National paper). 
In April 1867, on the day of  the Chaitra Sankranti (the last day of the Bengali year) the Hindu Mela was established. A formal committee was set up on the first day of the Mela of which Ganendranath Tagore became the  first secretary and Nabagopal Mitra the chief organiser. An exhibition was arranged on the occasion with National art-work, handicrafts, cottage industries etc. Among others who took active interest in the Mela were Dwijendranath Tagore, Rajnarayan Basu, Kristodas Pal, Girish Chandra Ghosh, Raja Kamal Krishna Bahadur and others. This was an early attempt to fight British Imperialism and to develop national industries.
The first three annual gatherings was also called Chaitra Mela. A national fair was organised on Chaitra Sankranti. The annual mela was inaugurated amidst the patriotic song of Dwijendranath Tagore- Malina Mukhochandra Ma Bharat Tomari (O mother India, your moon-face is so gloomy...). At the second annual Mela (1868), held at Belgachia and presided by Gnanandranath Tagore, a patriotic song composed by Satyendranath (when he was an ICS) - Gao Bharater Joy  was sung . This song was virtually the National Song till Bankim Chandra wrote Bande Mataram to replace it.. The details of the Mela was published in detail in all the news papers and magazines. In its annual gathering of 1875, Rabindranath Tagore recited his own poetry -Hindu Melar Upahar - which was publised in Amrita Bazar Patrika of 25 February 1875. The Hindu Mela gradually lost ground unable to cope with the new and complex demands of the 1880s and 1890s.  In the 1890s the Mela gradually faded away. But the spirit of swadeshi that it invoked in the minds of the Bengalis survived, which was subsequently developed during the Swadeshi Movement during the early period of twentieth century.


### Satyendranath (1842-1923)
Satyendranath (1842-1923) was the first Indian to join the Indian Civil Service. He was a great scholar with a large reservoir of creative talents.

Satyendranath Thakur, (1842-1923)

#### First Indian ICS :

For a long time, only the British were appointed to administrative posts in India. In 1832, the post of Musif and Sadar amin were created and opened to Indians. In 1833, the post of deputy Magistrate and deputy Collector were created for Indians. The ICS Act of 1861, established the Indian Civil Service. The Act of 1853 already established the practice of recruiting Indian civilians through competitive examinations. It was a daunting task to go to England at that time and compete with the British for securing a position . However, being inspired by a friend, Monomohan Ghose, Satyendranath, along with Monomohan, set sail for England in 1862 to prepare for and compete in the civil service examination. Satyendranath was selected in June 1863 but Monomohan was not. He was called to the bar. Satyendranath was posted to the Bombay Presidency, which then covered western parts of present day Maharashtra, Gujrat and Sindh. He had his first posting at Ahmedabad. Among the regular visitors to his place were his younger brothers,  Jyotirindranath (1849-1825), Rabindranath (1861-1941) and his sister Swarnakumari Devi.

His posting outside Bengal helped him to learn several Indian languages other than Bengali. While in Maharashtra he had close contact with many of the leading reformers, such as, Govinda Ranade, Kashinath Trimbak Telang, Ramkrishna Gopal Bhandarkar and Narayan Ganesh Chandavarkar.

He retired as a Judge of Satara in Maharashtra in 1897.

Ram Mohan Roy found Hindu Indian women "uneducated and illiterate, deprived of property rights, married before puberty, imprisoned in purdah, and murdered at widowhood by a barbaric custom of immolation known as SATI". By the time Satyendranath was born, SATI had been baned in 1829, and the process of reformation had begun. Satyendranath began thinking that purdah system had come from Muslim practices. 

After his marriage (1859), he found that Jnanadanandini was the ideal partner for his social experiments. In-spite of the opposition from Devendranath,  he sent her along with her two children, Surendranath and Indira Devi, to England to learn from the behavior of women in an advanced society. In Calcutta, breaking from all the previous practices, he took her to a party at the Government House (now Raj Bhavan).  

Prasanna Coomar Tagore of Pathuriaghata branch of Tagore family, who was also present on the occasion, became astonished to see a Bengali woman in such an open place among the hundreds of English women and left the place immediately 'in shame and anger'. 

In 1877, he sent Jnanadanandini Devi with two children to England with an English couple. They, initially stayed with the family of Prasanna Coomar Tagore's son, Gnanendramohan Tagore, who had converted to Christianity and was the first Indian to qualify for the English  bar.+++(5)+++ Later Jnanadanandini with her children shifted to Brighton and lived on their own there.

This was the attempt of Satyendranath to remove the upper and middle class women from purdah.

#### Patriotism
The Tagore family was deeply patriotic.  It was a fashion to wear foreign clothes and use foreign language (without having sound knowledge) at that time. The members of Tagore family stuck to wearing Indian dress and did a lot to improve Bengali language. Satyendranath was one of the persons to organize Hindu Mela to arouse patriotism in people. In the second session, he composed the pariotic song "mile sabe Bharat santan, ektan gaho gaan" ( unite India's Children, sing in unision). The song was hailed as the first national anthem of India.

After retirement, he lived in Park Street and Ballygunge in Kolkata. His house was the meeting place of his friends and relatives. Persons who visited regularly, outside his family members, were Taraknath Palit, Monomohan Ghose, Satyendraprasanna Sinha, W.C.Banerjee, Krishna Govinda Gupta, and Bihari Lal Gupta and others.

His house at Park Street was the centre of a literary majlis.

He was president of Bangiya Sahitya Parishad from 1900-1901and presided over the 10th session of the Bengal Provincial Conference held at Natore in 1897.

Satyendranath was the author of :

1. Sushila o Birsingha (play, 1867)
2. Bombay Chitra (1888)
3. Nabarathna mala
4. Stree swadhinata
5. Baudhafharmma
6. Amar Balyakatha
7. Bharatbarshiya Ingrej


#### bAlaka

Satyendranath (1842-1923), the second son of Maharshi Debendranath Tagore, was educated at Hindu School and Presidency College. Keshab Chandra Sen was his classmate in college. In 1859 he went to Ceylon with his father and was married with a 8 year old girl, Gnanadanandini, daughter of Abhoy Charan Mukhopadhyaya. From his very boy-hood he was an active supporter of freedom of women. He didn't keep his wife confined within the four walls of his residence. Swarnakumari Devi wrote that her 2nd elder brother came back to India after passing ICS. When he first joined his office he took his wife to Bombay.  He sent his wife to England with her two children. This caused much controversy in contemporary society. He was  a senior Govt. officer from 1865 to 1897 and came back to Calcutta after retirement.  After coming back to Calcutta he joined the then Nationalist Movement against the order of  Lord Curzon to partition Bengal in 1905. He wrote many songs which inspired his countrymen. He also took a role of editting Tattwabodhini Patrika. He became president of Bangiya Sahitya Parishad. He was Acharyya of Brahmmo Society for a long time. He constructed many Brahma Sangeet. His important works were - Shushila O Birsingha, Bombai Chitra, Balykatha, Freedom of Womem and British in India. He translated Meghdut kavya. With the help of his daughter, Indira, he translated the Autobiography of Maharshi Debendranath into English. He died of piles. His daughter described how he asked for oxygen in the last stages. Rabikaka came and sat on the floor to pray to God.
Of the many articles he wrote for Balaka, 'Bombai Sahar' was one with the map of the city.            



#### bAlaka - jnAnada-nandinI
In April 1885 (Baishakh 1292), the monthly magazine Balaka, edited by Jnanadanandini (wife of Satyendranath), was being published regulraly. She was staying in Calcutta for her children's education. Thakurbari was full of boys and girls growning up together, such as Sudhindranath, the fourth son of Dwijendranath, Balendranath, son of Birendranath, Hitendranath, son of Hemendranath and of the house no.5, Gaganendranath, Samarendranath, Abanindranath, the three brothers. Jnanadanandini knew Rabindranath was to be given the charge of managing the magazine Balaka, though she was at that time editing it. Rabindranath took the responsibility of writing many articles for the magazine. He wrote poetry, essay, letters, comics, a novel in the name of Mukut, and a big novel Rajarshi within a year. The expression of the thought and sense of Balaka were far reaching, sometimes beyond the world of the children,  which was evident from  each of its issue.
After a few days Rabindranath expressed his deep sorrow and wrote that  the literature written for children, recently, was oversimplified. Every regarded  the child as a mere child and not as a human being. In his opinion, the books meant for the children should be such that they would understand some portion of it and some other portion might be out of their reach, which they would understand with the help of imagination. He said that in his boyhood he read books from the library from one end to the other. Some portion he could follow, some not but both effected his mind. Many of the articles published in Balaka , strictly speaking,  were not actually meant for children. Rabindranath's ideas about study material of the children was explained in "JibanSmriti". He wrote in Reminiscences that during his boyhood days he had  finished both the readable and unreadable books.
The experienced editor Ramananda Chattopadhyaya thought after reading Balaka that Rabindranath measured the mental condition of the boys according to his own mental condition when he was a child. In fact he did not select books, readable or un-readable,  while he read books in his childhood.


Prafullamayee Devi, wife of Birendranath , wrote that Jnanadanandini Devi, after coming back from Bombay, introduced dress code amongst the female members of Tagore family.  She taught them to put on inner garments under the sari and to wear a blouse to cover the upper body. The people outside the Tagore family also took to these ideas. It was very difficult at that time to change custom. She was very straightforward and courageous-- she went to England with her children even though Satyendranath could not accompny her due to his duties. He along with Rabindranath went there after some time. Apart from literary work she had interest in photography. At her initiative many photographs of different members of Tagore were taken. Her daughter, Indira Devi, wrote that she was in the habit of taking care of all the relatives and was very lively. Many dramas  were staged at Thakur bari under her initiative. She used to take care of everybody. Everyone respected her for her sober attitude.

Jnanadanandini wrote a historical story on Russia of the 1870s, i.e., before the October Revolution of 1917.
In another article she described with figures different physical exercises from which one might benifit.

In reply to the essay written by Jnadanandini about the benifits of physical exercise, Rabindranath in the form of  "letters to the editor" contradicted the content of the essay and pointed out the differences of weather, food habits of India with that of Europe and America. In his opinion physical exercise in those country was a necessity but in India one had to take rest due to its hot weather condition. The standard of the magazine could be seen very easily 



### Hemendranath (1842-1923)
He was the third son of Devendranath,  a scientist and organiser of the family. He was a strict disciplinarian who was entrusted with the responsibility of looking after the education of his younger brothers as well as administering the large family estates.

Like most of Devendranath's children, he had varied interests in different fields. On the one hand he composed  a number of Brahma Sangeets and on the other, wrote articles on Physical Science which he planned to compile and edit into a text book for school students.

If his untimely death had not prevented him from completing the project, this would certainly have been the first science text book to be written in Bengali. He was known for his physical strength and wrestling skills.

Exceptionally for the times, he insisted on a formal education for his daughters. He not only put them into schools but trained them in Music, the Arts and European languages such as French and German. It was another mark of his forward-looking mentality that he actively sought out eligible grooms from different provinces of India for his daughters and married them off to places as far as away as UP and Assam.

He was a spiritual seer and Yogi of the highest order and he was responsible for the development of modern Brahmoism which is now the Adi Brahmo Dharma religion. He was a "doer" of his Tagore generation and worthy successor to the father and grand-father.

This is the only Photo obtained on search from internet which claims to be the photo of Hemendranath Tagore.

Debendranath Tagore's third son, is notable for being the first ever Brahmo as he was the first child born in 1844 to any of the 21 Brahmos who swore the first Brahmo Covenant on 21st Dec 1843 at Kolkata.

An intesely private person, he was also known by his three qualities.

1. A strict disciplinarian entrusted with responsibility of looking after the education of his younger brothers,
2. As the administrator of the large family estates of Debendranath's branch of the Tagore family, and
3. While alive, he was also the constant spiritual companion  to his father, Debendranath Tagore, who founded Brahmoism, and despite his extreme youth, acted as the channel between his father and the seniors of the Tattwabodhini Sabha.

#### Educational career
Like most of Debendranath's children, he had varied interest in different fields and was a polymath. He had much interest in science and attended the Calcutta Medical College  (established by his grand father Dwarakanath Tagore). He wrote articles on Physical Science which he planned to compile and edit into a text book for school students. If his early death had not prevented him from completing the project, this would certainly had been the first science text book to be written in Bengali.

From 1867 Hemendranath Tagore began conducting his first experiments into radio waves and electromagnetic propagations. Between 1872-1873 he wrote several articles on the results of his research, these were transcribed by another Brahmin, Ramendra Sundar Trivedi. In 1874, he compiled the first scholarly Asian work on physics entitled Prakritik Vijnaner Sthulamarma which was updated in 1878-79.

Since the knowledge contained within was potentially explosive, its circulation was restricted only to Brahmins of the Adi Brahmo Samaj.

Built like a bull, he was known for his extraordinary physical strength and prowess in wrestling contests - described as being a "renowned wrestler", as also his expertise in martial arts like judo and ninjitsu. He was also an adept of ancient Raj Yoga at  the highest levels with control over time and space.

Exceptionally modern for the times,  after siring three sons, he sired only daughters thereafter and insisted on formal education for all of them. He not only put them through schools but trained them in music, arts, and European Languages such as German and French. It was another mark of his forward looking mentality that he actively sought out eligible grooms from different parts of India for his daughters.

He arranged marriages for his daughters in UP and Assam. 

A staunch modernist, he instituted various financial trusts for the womenfolk of Tagore family (specially his sisters) and was responsible for settling the Santiniketan estate near Bolpur which later evolved into Viswa Bharati.

A practical and scientific humanist, he was deeply loved by the peasants of his estates in India and Bangladesh. After his death in 1884, his brothers especially Rabindranath Tagore and Satyendranath Tagore revoked all the trusts, destroyed the papers of Dwarakanath Tagore, cheated their sisters from their patrimony, squandered the family money, and rack-rented the peasantry who rose up in revolt

Hemendranath was concerned with three things.  His family- in the broader sense, which included father, mother, brothers, sisters, and his own family, Tattwabodhini Sabha and the estates of  the Tagore family.

But his life-span was so brief, only 40 yrs, 1844-1848, that he could not do any justice to any of the three excepting that he could get married of his daughters to well placed grooms in different parts of India.


#### jAti and upavIta

A series of developments in Tattwabodhini Sabha after its merger in 1843 with Calcutta Brahmo Samaj resulted in the forming of a reformist core elect Brahmin group, which stood apart from Calcutta Brahmo Samaj during the fractious period of 1858 to 1865, to later emerge as Adi Dharma. This core was initially under Pt. Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar who later entrusted it to Hemendranath in 1859. 

Finally in 1865 Hemendranath took charge, firmly insisting on the expulsion of non-Brahmins from preaching posts. He thereafter organised research on the formal practices, rituals and observations for Brahmo adherents which were privately circulated in early 1860 as Brahmo Anusthan. 

This Anusthan was limited for the Brahmin families of the 1843 First Covenant only and was first used publicly in 26 July 1861 for the marriage of his second sister Sukumari. The Anusthan involving discarding the Sacred Brahmin Thread, which created considerable controversy and was thereafter adopted for the non-brahmins also with some small modifications for those who possessed no thread.

#### Children Of Hemendranath
Hemendranath had eleven children. The first threee were sons and the last eight were daughters. The names were;
Hitendranath, Kshitindranath, Ritendranath, these three were the  sons.
Prativa, Pragna, Abhi, manisha, Shovana, Sushama, Sumrita, Sudakshina, these eight were daughters.

Among the sons, Kshitindrnath was well known as official Historian of Adi Brahmo Samaj and Editor of the Tattwabodhini juournal, a duty carried on by grandson Commander Amritomayi Mukherjee I.N.

##### prativa sundarI
Prativa Sundari Devi (1866-1922) was the daughter of Hemendranath, the third son of Debendranath Tagore.  She was the only woman in Thakur Bari  who was highly educated. She studied in Bethune and then in Loreto. She was exceptionally brilliant in music. She mastered both eastern and western music. She took the role Saraswati in Balmiki Prativa in its first performance  and was highly appreciated. Bankim Chandra was present on the occasion. Not only in performance she had contributed to some theoritical aspects of music.She also gave notations to Rabindranath's lyric and earned a reputation. The notation of the song "Bal Golap More Bal" of Tagore was done by her  which was  the first  printed notation of Tagore's lyric. She was married to Ashutosh Choudhury. She continued singing even after her marriage. She took an important role in publicising and circulation of  Tagore songs.She founded a school for music with the name of "Sangeet Sangha". This school felicitated Rabindranath on 21st Aug 1921 for winning the Nobel Prize.
In Balaka, she wrote an article in which she discussed Marga Sangeet. In her article she also gave notations to some of the songs and discussed some basic points on music.  "Balaka" was a magazine for children, but it contained different departments. e.g., travel, drama, exercise, music and editorial with letters to the editor. Prativa Sundari Devi was in charge of the column on music. She wrote many essays on music in 'Balaka' covering 41 pages in the compiled book. In fact she tried to give an introductory lesson in music through this medium under the title "Sahaje Gan-shiksha". She discussefd about beats, gaps with examples.

#### Vision of Brahma

Hemendranath explained his peculiar experiences while he was meditating. This was known as "description of Vision of Brahma in 1848".

> Then I went out and sat underneath an ashvatta tree and according to the teaching of the saints began meditating on the Spirit of of God dwelling my soul. My mind was flooded with emotion, my eyes were filled with tears. All at once I saw the shining vision of Brahma in the lotus core of my heart. A thrill passed through my whole body, I felt a joy beyond all measure. But the next moment I could see Him  no more. On losing sight of that beautific vision which destroys all sorrow, I suddenly rose from the ground. A great sadness came over my spirit. Then I tried to see him again by force of contemplation, and found him not. I became as one stricken with disease and would not be comforted. Meanwhile I suddenly heard a voice in the air, "In this life thou shalt see Me no More. Those whose hearts have not been purified, who have not achieved the highest Yoga, cannot see Me. It was only to stimulate thy love that I once appeared before thee.'

### Jyotirindranath
Jyotirindranath (1849-1925) was a scholar, artist, music composer and theater personality.

Jyotirindranath, the grandson of Dwarakanath Tagore and fifth son of Debendranath Tagore, was born in Jorasanko, Calcutta, on 4 May 1849. He was twelve years senior to Rabindranath but was close to him and he assisted Rabindranath in the development of his cultural life.

Formative years : In his early childhood he was taught by his elder brother Hmendranath. Then he studied at St. Paul's and Montague's School and passed entrance examination (school leaving ) from Hindu School in 1864. The renowned historian and writer Ramesh Chandra Dutta was his classmate.While studying in Presidency College, he developed interest in the theatre and left his studies.

#### Involvement in the theatre 
He formed a home theatre group and staged dramas. One of his cousins, Ganendranath, established the Jorasanko Natyasala in 1865. The first play to be staged was Krishnakumari written by Michael Madhusudan Dutta. Jyotirindranath acted in the role of Ahalyadevi, a brave queen. His early success developed in him a strong determination to be one of greatest playwrights of his age. He became involved in Hindu Mela and he recited poems and composed patriotic dramas to develop its cultural organisation. He also organised Biddvajjana  Samagama as a support base of cultural program of Hindu Mela. This organisation also provided Rabindranath an opportunity to stage some of his plays and dance dramas. Jyotirindranath was elected General secretary of Hindu Mela in the ninth year of existence of the organisation.

#### Works of Jyotirindranath
Jyotirindranath wrote popular plays such as Purubikram (1874), Sarojini ( Rabindranath wrote a song to this Drama, Jwala jwala Chita, Dwigun-dwigun") (1875), Swapnamayi (1882).  His noteworthy satires include Kinchit Jalajog, Eman karma ar karbo na, Hathat Nabab, Alik babu, Hathat Nabab was based on Moliere's Bougeois Gentilhomme. Purubikarma was based on raja Puru. Sarojini is a trajedy.

In 1867, while staying with his elder brother Satyendranath Tagore in Ahmedabad, he learnt many things, 1. how to play with the sitar, and 2. painting. He picked up French and Marathi languages.He translated books from different languages into his native language Bengali, the focus being on plays. From English he translated Marcus Aurelius' Meditation  , Shakespeare's Julius Caeser. Apart from Pierre Loti and and Theophile Gautier, he translated many books on history, philosophy and travels, novels aand short stories from French.

From Marathi , he translated Balgangadhar Tilak's Geetarahasya. Jyotirindranath proposed a newmagazine Bharati in 1877 and made Dwijendranath its editor. He became vice-president of the Bangiya Sahitya Parishad in 1902 -03.Jyotirindranath had 46 vols of published works to his credit, including translation. He always attended a literary gathering (majlis) in the house of his elder brother Satyendranath Tagore.

#### Music
Jyotirindranath had his lessons in music, early in his life from Bishnupada Chakraborty. He was expert in playing Piano, Violin, Sitar, and Harmonium. Jyotirindrath was the pivot of a developing musical environment in Jorasanko. His companion was Akshoy Kumar Dutta. Later Rabindranath joined him at the age of 14. The system of development was peculiar in their case. Jyotirindranath gave the musical note and Rabindranath had to fit lyrics in it. 20 songs of Rabindranath's dance drama Mayar Khela  was composed like this. Jyotirindranath first of all developed musical note and then lyrics was put in it. In 1879, he published a magazine, Binabadini, on behalf of the organisation Swaralipigitimala,on musical matters. This was the first magazine of its type. He published another magazine on music, Sangeet Prakashika. One  of the foresmost musicologists of Kolkata, as well as a classical singer Rajyeswar Mitra opines, "at this stage too, we find the rise of a celebrated line of musical and dramatic culture in the house of the Thakurs, which was much more polished and enlightened in character than most other such houses. The chief architect of this development was Jyotirindranath."  

#### Drawing
He was attracted towards drawing and sketching. He sketches the portraits of many persons in his family, specially of  Rabindranath there were numerous sketches in different styles. He drew the sketches of plain folk around him including the employees of his shipping firm. He had drawn around 2,000 sketches, which are preserved in Rabindra Bharati University museum. Some of his sketches were published in Bharati in 1912. William Rothenstein happened to see them. When Rabindranath proceeded  for third time to visit  England, he carried a bunch of sketches prepared by Jyotirindranath. Rothenstein was highly impressed and with his assistance the book Twenty-five collotypes from the original drawings of Jyotirindranath was published in England.

#### bAlaka
Jyotirindranath (1849-1925) was the 6th child and 5th son of Debendranath Tagore. Rabindranath called him  'Natun Dada'. He was also in favour of the freedom of women. His wife Kadambari was the first lady who went to the Maidan from Jorasanko on horse back. He had talent in instrumental music and art. In 1914 Rodenstein published a collection of his 25 oil paintings of which he wrote the introduction. In his essays written for Balaka he had drawn illustrations.


#### Business Venture
Jyotirindranath earned some money from indigo cultivation. He could not continue indigo cultivation due to the fall of demand of  natural indigo after the discovery of chemical indigo in Germany. He became esger to switch over to other ventures. At that time, there was need  for a steamer link between Khulna and Barisal (both the places are now in Bangladesh). 

He started a steamer service, Sarojini.     But a English company Flotilla  also started the same business. To meet the competition, he purchased four more steamers, Swadeshi, Bharat, Bangalakshmi, and Ripon.      But after reducing the fare, Jyotirindranath incurred heavy losses. Moreover, Swadeshi hit a jetty and sank. Jyotirindranath had no alternative but to sell the steamers and opt out of the competition.

#### Other activities
He served as secretary of the Adi Brahmo Samaj from 1869 to 1888. He founded Adi Brahmo Samaj Sangit Vidyalaya. At his initiative a secret society Sanjivani Sabha was formed, possibly in 1876, with Rajnarayan Basu as president. This society manufactured match sticks and hand-woven cloth which could not earn any profit but did encourage swadeshi enterprise.

#### Marriage
He was married to Kadambari Devi on 5 July 1868. He arranged for her education including horse-riding in the public grounds of Kolkata defying the attitude of conservativbe society. Kadambari committed suicide on 19 April 1884, the cause of which was unknown.

Krishna Kripalani, who married Tagore's granddaughter, writes in his own biography of Tagore, the futility of speculating on the causes of the suicide by Kadambari Devi.

The effect of Kadambari Devi's death on the mind of Rabindranath can readily be established from Tagore's own words expressed in  a correspondence to a young Amiya Chakraborty of about 16, who would, a decade or so later, become Tagore's literary secretary for a period of time. Tagore wrote to him in 1917 (Kripalani's translation):

> Once, when I was about your age, I suffered a devastating sorrow, similar to yours now. A very close relative  of mine committed suicide, and she had been my life's total support, right from childhood onward. And so with her unexpected death it was as if the earth itself receded from beneath my feet, as though the skies above me all went dark. My universe turned empty, my zest for life departed.

In 1884, there were three sad deaths: On 8 January, Keshab Chandra Sen, on  19 April, Kadambari Devi (an unnatural death), and on 5 June,  Hemendranath Tagore. This was a great loss to the Tagore family, specially the untimely death of Hemendranath Tagore at the age of 40 years. In his reminiscences, Rabindranath spent more than 2,500 words to explain the loss of Kadambari Devi. He wrote that his mother's death did not affect him so strongly for  he was too young ( 14 years old) and Kadambari Devi, aged 16, assumed the role of a surrogate maternal figure. Tagore's biographer, Prabhat Kumar Mukhopadhyaya, writes that she was more a playmate.  A number of poems written by Rabindranath at different times expresses his deep sorrow.  He dedicated four books to her before her death and two more after. In 1901, he portrayed her as Charu in Nashtanir.  Mr. Krishna Kripalini concluded that

> "I have nothing more to add to this controversy. I, personally, believe that, with my little knowledge of Rabindranath Tagore and his family life, Kadambari Devi was in love with him, and when his marriage was organised by  his family she was heartbroken and committed suicide.

### Rabindranath Tagore
Rabindranath Tagore was born at No. 6 Dwarakanath Tagore Lane, Jorasanko, located in north Calcutta (Kolkata) near Chitpur Road on 7 May 1861. He was the youngest  son (eighth) among the fourteen children (Budhendranath, 1863-1864, died at the age of 1) of his parents- Devendranath and Sarada Devi.
 
He (called Rabi) was born in a family of mixed culture of East and West. He wrote in his autobiography - My life in my words -

> "there was something remarkable in our family. it was as if we lived close to the age of pre-Puranic India through our commitment to the Upanishads. As a boy, I grew up reciting slokas from the Upanishads with a clear enunciation. We had no experience of the emotional excesses prevalent in Bengal's religious life. My father's spiritual life was quiet and controlled."

They had a genuinely deep love of English literature. Shakespeare and Sir Walter Scott had a strong influence over their family.

There had been several changes, both nationally and internationally, in the second half of the nineteenth century. Rabi noted that a great fight ensued between the more progressive people of his time and the orthodox, who became 'nervous and angry' when some lover of truth broke open their enclosure and flooded it with the sunshine of thought and life.

Rabi felt proud of having witnessed three revolutionary movements in his family during his father's time.

1. He was proud, for his father was one of the great leaders of the movement, a movement for whose sake he suffered ostracism and braved social indignities.
2. A literary revolution of which Bankim Chandra Chatterjee of Bengal was the pioneer.
3. The third one was the emergence of nationalism. He was proud that the people of his country started asserting their own personality and began to raise their voice against the indignity and the humiliation imposed upon them by the British colonisers.

The first modern man of India, Raja Ram Mohan Roy, was a friend of the Tagore family since the time of Dwarakanath Tagore.  Under his influence Devendranath took to Brahmoism in 1848 much before the birth of Rabindranath. Rabindranath said in his autobiography that his father was fortunate to come under the influence of Ram Mohan Roy from his (Devendranath's) early years which helped him to free himself from the sectarian barriers, from traditions of worldly and social ideas that were very rigid in many aspects, very narrow and not altogether beneficial, and his family had given up "mainstream" Hinduism well before he was born. 

Devendranath was 45 years of age when Rabi was born. Their special Puja building was no longer in use and he had no idea about any rituals and practices of his ancestors. He did not see the "festival of wealth' of his grandfather (Dwarakanath) except the "black marks of the burnt lamps".

Rabindranath's  early life was  simple and modest. The only difference with other families was that the family home had a flow of cultural activities, and the cultivation of art and music had become a family tradition.

Organising the Hindu Mela was an annual affair of Devendranath and Babu Nabagopal Mitra was entrusted with the job. When Rabi was born, Dwijendranath was 21 years, Satyendranath 19 years, Hemendranath 17 years, and Jyotirindranath 13 years.  There were other siblings, but the four elder brothers had a strong influence on Rabindranath. 

The daughters of Devendranath, who were married, lived with their husbands in Jorasanko. Sometimes the number of members of Jorasanko Thakur Bari exceeded 200. Devendranath's wife Sarada Devi, busy with such a large household, could not find time for her children. Rabindranath was brought up by the servants and taught by his brothers.

In childhood Rabindranath had two friends- Satyaprasad, slightly older and the sister of Satyaprasad, Ira (Irabati, 1861-1918), son and daughter of Soudamini, the eldest daughter of Devendranath- both of them always fuelled his imagination by telling peculiar tales about Thakurbari.

After the birth of the youngest child (Budhendranath), who died at the age of one, Sarada Devi's health  broke down and she could  devote even less time to her children. Other senior women of the family, elder sisters and sisters-in-law, were also very busy with their respective duties. 

Rabindranath Tagore had to  pass most of his time with a 'retinue' of servants and maid-servants from morning till night before going to  sleep. He was not allowed to move around even within the house. He had no ideas about the different rooms, corridors within the building. Only his imagination and the stories told by his two companions gave him what he called 'pictures of life's memories rather than life's history'. This he termed 'servocracy'. 

> 'One of the servants would place him at a certain strategic point and draw a circle round him', 

warning him of dire consequences if he  crossed the border line. They always used to tell the story of the Ramayana, reminding him of the punishment that Sita received by crossing the line. The boy stayed well within the circle, imagining the worst possible perils if he disobeyed. There was a pond beneath the window. On the east side of the pond, by the side of the wall, stood a big banyan tree (Rabindranath wrote a poem on this Banyan tree, Purono Bat) and on the south there were rows of coconut trees. As a child Rabindranath used to pass his time looking at all these like 'Amal of Dakghar'.

When Rabi was a child he was not allowed to go outside the house. So he peeped through corridors and windows and wanted to see beyond his reach. Sometimes he could hear whiffs of sounds coming from inside or outside, some scents which used to touch his mind and he felt that someone was around and would be  meeting and playing with him. The ways of such  a meeting of a bounded person with an unbounded entity (he wrote a poem, Dui Pakhi, in Sonar Tari) was unknown to him and the attraction of such a call gradually became stronger.  


In the city of Calcutta, when Rabindranath was born, there was no trams,buses or motor cars. Only horse driven cars were available. The horses moved in the city raising dust all around and the coachman used to whip the horses to keep them on the right track.  The marks of the whip lashes became invisible in the bony recesses on the horse's back. Life was slow and leisurely and betel chewing clerical staff sometimes came to their offices in shared carriages. 


Palanquin, a spot for Imagination of Rabindranath
"The chalk line has been wiped away today, but the confining ring is still there. The distance is just as distant, the outside is still beyond me...." 
 

In the time of Dwarakanath, grand father of Rabindranath, palanquins were in use. He had a big palanquin which required eight bearers to carry each pole. The bearers, their gold bracelets, their thick earrings and their sleeveless red tunics had gone with the wealth and glory of  Prince Dwarakanath. The body of the palanquin sans the decorations was left in a corner of the accounting-house as a piece of common-place lumber.

It was to him an island  in the midst of the ocean, and he,on holidays, became Robinson Crusoe. He sat within its closed doors, completely out of sight, delightfully safe from prying eyes'.  

#### Song
Rabindranath Tagore had a sweet voice from his childhood . Thakurbari was always full of literary activities, songs and dramas. But that was amongst the elders, children were not allowed to enter. Dwijendranath, the eldest son of   Devendranath, was then writing a Kabya, "Swapnaprayan", which he used to recite for others to listen. Rabindranath, standing by the side of the door, listened and learnt the verses by heart. Rabindranath said that he could not remember how he learnt to sing. Sreekantha Singh, a friend of Devendranath and el Singing was his passion. He was always absorbed in music. He was appointed for teaching songs but he did not teach songs, he gave them lessons only. Bishnu Chakraborty was a singer of  Adi Brahmo Samaj; he gave them the first lesson in how to sing. Rabindranath did not take regular tuition. Finally, Jadu Bhatta became their vocal music teacher. 

But Rabindranath  learnt singing in his own way- from servants, from gypsy women, from Bauls and from here and there, from whatever he heard. These were the first lessons of Rabindranath  before he went into formal education.

He and the other children had to pass most of their time with Ishwar or to be more precise,  Brajeshwar. Once he was a village-teacher. He was entrusted to train the children. At that time there was no electricity, there were Kerosene or other oil lamps. Childrens used to sit around him and hear the stories of Ramayana and Mahabharata in the dim light of the lamp. After dinner, when they went to bed, a maid told them bed time stories of galloping horses on vast stretches of land, till all of them were sound asleep.       

This was the beginning of his education before actually reading books. ??der brother of Lord Satyendra Prasanna, came from Raipur of Birbhum district to stay in Calcutta.

#### Game with wooden lion

There was another game, too, with his wooden lion. He heard stories of sacrifices of goats, buffaloes and he decided that a lion sacrifice would be magnificient.  He had a wooden lion. Ofcourse, there would be some strong 'mantra' for the lion otherwise it could not be offered for puja, He found a mantra,

> Liony, Liony, off with your head,  
Liony, Liony, now you are dead,  
Woofle the walnut goes clappety clap,  
Snip, Snop, Snap.

#### Servants
The house was full of relatives and other people. From all parts of the house one could hear the sounds made by the shouts of the servants at work.

Pari, the maid, returning from the bazaar through the front courtyard, her vegetables in a basket on her hip;  
Dukhon the bearer carrying Ganga water in a yoke across his shoulder, the weaver woman going into the inner apartments to trade the newest style of sari;  
Dinu the goldsmith, who received a monthly wage, sitting in the room next to the lane, blowing his bellows and carrying out the orders of the family, now coming to the counting-house to present his bill to  
Kailash Mukherjee, who had a quill pen stuck behind his ear.  
The carder sits in the courtyard cleaning the mattress-stuffing on his twinging bow.  
Mukundalal, the durwan  was rolling outside on the ground with the one-eyed wrestler, trying out a new wrestling fall. He slapped his thighs loudly and repeated his movements twenty or thirty times, dropping on all fours.  
A crowd of beggars were waiting outside for their regular dole.

This was a regular routine Rabindranath witnessed and it became tedious.

#### Home-Schooling
After some oral education of songs, Ramayana, Mahabharata, Thakumar Jhuli etc Rabindranah got his first lesson from "Barnaparichyaya" from his home tutor Madhab Pandit. Rabindranath had a good memory and quickly finished the spelling lessons of "KARA, KHALA , JALA etc and came to short sentences --Jala Pare, Pata Nare. By this time his imagination had sparked and he thought that he was gradually entering into the area of  "Adi kabita of Adi Poet" and the line was continually vibrating through his mind --Jala Pare Pata Nare. 

Rabindranath was getting his education at home but when he saw that his elder brothers (Somendranath and Satyaprasad) were going to School he began to cry and wanted to go with them. At this Madhab Pandit got angry and slapped him and said that now he was crying for going to school, a time would come when he would cry to avoid going to school. 

Rabindranath said in his old age that the forecast made by his home tutor was the most accurate that he had come across in his life.


#### Schooling
He was admitted to the Oriental Seminary. (In 1823, Gourmohan Addya established the School. The school was running at that time in the house of Gorachand Basak of Garanhata). This was the first school he attended, along with his elder brothers Somendra and his nephew Satyaprasad. Rabindranath, Somendra (Rabindranath called him DADA) and Satyaprasad went to school together. He could not remember the lesson he got in the Oriental Seminary. He remembered only the punishment a student got for being unable to  answer any question about his home task. He was asked to stand up on the bench and extend both of his hands. Then slates, one after another, was kept on his extended hands.

After few days,  the guardians transferred  all the wards to Normal School, where the method of teaching was of European style. The school started after a prayer song.  One line in the song was -full of glee, singing merrily, merrily, merrily. This school was established under the guidance of Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar in 1855. At that time the School was held in Jorasanko, in the house of Shyamlal Mallik, very close to the Thakur bari.

Rabindranath expressed in his " Jibansmriti" that he was not happy at the School because of the rough behaviour of the teachers. The behaviour of one of the teachers was so nasty that he refused to answer any of his questions.

But he secured highest mark in the annual Bengali Examination taken by his Bengali teacher Madhusudan Bachaspati . The Class Teacher could not believe this and he complained to the Headmaster that Madhusudan Babu might have been partial. At this, Rabindranath was re-examined and the superintendant became the invigilator during the examination. The second time also Rabindranath secured the highest mark.

This was the only known result of an examination taken by Rabindranath during his student life.

#### Schooling
Rabindranath was admitted to the Normal School at the age of 7 years. Rabindranath wrote a short story, Ginni, remembering this school. After  one year when his age was about eight he was forced to write a poem by one of his nephews, Jyotyprakash Gangopadhyaya (1855-1919), son of Kadambini Devi (the eldest sister of Gunendranath). Jyotyprakash was six years older than Rabindranath. He was reading, at that time, English literature, especially Hamlet, and was always reciting the dialogues.

One day, in the day time, he called Rabindranath and said that he had to write a poem.  Jyotyprakash explained to Rabindranath the Payar Chanda containg 14 words in a line.

Rabindranath at that stage had seen poetry only in the books.  It appeared to him as neat and clean with no overwriting or scribbling in it. There was no hesitation. He could not imagine that he could write such a thing only by his mere will. However, he collected some blue papers with the help of an office staff of Tagore family, drew some lines, running in different directions, and tried to write something with his hand. Somendranath, the brother immediately elder to Rabindranath, became delighted with this and began collecting listeners for Rabindranath's potery. Somendra always encouraged Rabindranath to keep writing poetry and he acted as his oral publisher.  One day he caught Nabagopal Babu, the editor of "National Paper", and persuaded him to listen.  On hearing the poetry, Nabagopal Babu said it was alright but he could not understand the meaning of the word "DWIREF". Now the words  DWIREF and BHRAMAR,  in Bengali, both contained three letters, and why he used the former one and where from he got the word, Rabindranath could not recollect.

#### Schooling
Govinda Babu was the superindentent of Normal School. He was short, fat and dark. His office room was on the first floor. One day, Rabindranath entered in his room fearfully to report torture by some of the naughty boys of the school. Govinda Babu took pity on him and one day he called Rabindranath to his room and asked that whether he wrote poetry. Rabindranath was pleased and confirmed the rumour.  He asked Rabindranath to write a poem on some difficult topic. Rabindranath did so and brought the poem the next day. Govinda Babu took Rabindranath to the class and told him to read it. Rabindranath recited the poem loudly.

In 1871, Rabindranath was admitted to the Bengal Academy, an Anglo-Indian School.  
In the year 1872 when he was about 11 years old, he got the opportunity of going out of town for the first time due to a Dengue (1872-1873) epidemic in Calcutta.


All of them went to a garden-house at Panihati near the Ganges. In front of the servant's quarter there was a  guava tree and through  two of its branches  Rabi could see large boats  sailing  in the Ganges.

That blue coloured copy book was gradually being filled up with poetry and he always welcomed the news of its circulation.

Satkari Dutta was not a teacher in the class where  Rabindranath was reading but he was sympathetic to Rabindranath. One day he asked Rabindranath that whether he wrote poetry. On hearing in the affirmative he gave him two lines and asked him to fill up next two lines; Rabindranath did this nicely. Thus he gradually became known as a poet and he got a new avenue in his life which he maintained till his death.  

This time his  third elder brother Hemendranath, a good student in Science, was in charge of supervising their all round development. 

He narrated a daily routine to be followed by every body from morning till night. In the morning , after rising from  bed, they had to practice wrestling with an one eyed wrestler.+++(5)+++ Then they had to take their lessons with all the muds and sands in their body. The   home tutors for Bengali, Mathematics, History and Geography would come. Then they had to go to school. After coming back from the school, at about four,  they had to attend drawing classes with the drawing-master and then Gymnastics. In the evening followed English lessons. At this time they were about to fall asleep and the elder Brother Dwijendranath on seeing this allowed them to go to bed. Rabi , at this opportunity, used to go to his mother's room.

Every Sunday, Science teacher used to come with the apparatus for demonstrations. Rabi happened to get interested. The passion, Rabindranath had for science, was due to this. Moreover, for training in the Bengali literature Meghnad-bad-kabya was chosen. Rabindranath wrote a critical review of this book which was published in "Bharati".

Even in winter Rabindranath used to get up early in the morning when it was still dark and he shivered with the cold. He practised wrestling with the 'celebrated one-eyed'  wrestler. Their wrestling ground was on the north side of the outer room where there was once a greenery. The ground had been prepared by digging and loosening the earth to a depth of one cubit and pouring over it a mound of mustard oil. It was a mere child play for the wrestler to tangle with him. But Rabi's mother did not like this activity because her son's skin was becoming darkened and in holidays she used to scrub him top to bottom and treated him with cosmetics like almond paste, thickened cream, the rind of orange etc. Specially on Sunday morning, there was much rubbing and scrubbing on the veranda,
After coming from the wrestling ground there was a medical student waiting with a skeleton of the human body to teach them the names of the bones which were terribly difficult to remember.

As the clock struck 7, Master Nilkamal appeared to teach him Bengali, Arithmatic, Algebra and Geometry with the help of the black board. In the literature lesson he could quickly jump from Sitar Banabas to Meghnadhbadh Kabya. Along with this he had learned natural sciences. Sometimes Sitanath Dutta came to teach experiments in science with familiar things. Once Hiramba Tattnaratna, the Sanskrit scholar, came and taught them Mugdhobodh Sanskrit grammar, which they had to learn by heart without understanding anything.

After finishing the morning lessons, he had to go to school and returned at half past four. The gymnastic master came then and for about an hour he had to practise with parallel bars. He enjoyed other types of games also, with marbles, with bat-ball (a poor relation of cricket), top spinning, kite-flying-- all the lazy types of games.  Football was out of their reach.


The boys had to leave Normal School and be admitted in Bengal Academy, a European School, for their training in English. Here Rabindranath  got a friend who knew some tricks of magic. Rabindranath has mentioned his name in his book.

The interest of Rabindranath Tagore developed in books rather than in his study materials. He took books from his elder brother, Dwijendranath's library e.g.,   "Abodhbandhu" and Bividharta Sangraha. Rabindranath beacame a fan of poet Biharilal Chakraborty.

In 1872, at the age of eleven, Rabindranath finished "Bangadarshan" from beginning to the end.

#### upanayana
In Adi Brahmo Samaj the ritual of Sacred Thread ceremony was in vogue. Devendranath got the celebration done for his two youngest sons Somendranath and Rabindranath along with Satyaprasad, the son of his eldest daughter. It was in 1873, when Rabindranath was 11 years and 9 months old, but he took it seriously and observed all the rituals though it was not possible for him to follow all the meanings of the Mantras. Its influence lingered even in his old age.  He had become a Brahmin but with his shaved head  it became difficult for him to go to School. 

#### Travel with father
At this time his father offered to take him to the Himalayas,  which he accepted at once. He felt so excited that he wanted to express his willingness by shouting like a thunder.

This was the first time he would enjoy the  world outside and the company of his father which was also unknown to him. At first they went to Shantiniketan and stayed there for a few days. It was a mere village at that time in 1873. About 4-5 Kilometers away from Bolpur station, Devendranath had purchased 20 bighas of land and constructed a one storied building there with bricks and given it the name "Shantiniketan".   All around there were open meadows, an unfinished pond and at a distance there was a dam in Bhubandanga village and  rows of palm-trees, non-existent today.

Later on Devendranath established an Ashram and a temple there. This was the first outing for Rabindranath, in 1873, at the age of 11yrs and 9 months.

Devendranath used to stay away from home for his work and could not devote  time to his children. This was the quite the usual practice at that time-- for the father to keep himself at a respectable distance from the children. After coming to Bolpur, Rabindranath got the chance to come into close contact with his father and could help him out, such as winding his watch, keeping cash and accounts etc. He also got ample opportunity to roam around as he liked. The peaceful environment of Shantiniketan helped him in his creative work. In Shantiniketan, under a small coconut tree, he wrote a lyrical-drama, "Prthwiraj  Parajay", the manuscript of this book is lost. However, the lyrical-drama "Rudrachandra" might be of a similar type.

They left Bolpur after a few days and went to Amritsar, halting at several places - Sahibganj, Danapur, Allahabad, Kanpur etc.

At last they reached Amritsar of the Punjab. They stayed in a resort and used to visit Swarna Mandir almost every day and became pleased on hearing their songs and offered donations to the singers. He implemented in Shantiniketan these practices-- to read their holy book, Grantha Saheb, and the  Bhajan. This practice prevailed for long.

After staying for one month in Amrtisar, they went to Dalhousie in Himachal Pradesh.  The house they had taken at Bakrota was on the highest hill-top.  Though it was nearing May, it was still bitterly cold there, so much so that, on the shaded side of the hill, the winter frost had not yet melted.  Rabindranath's room was at one end of the house from where he could see through the uncurtained windows, the distant snowy peaks shimmering dimly in the starlight.

Rabindranath was allowed to move through the small lane in between two hills and pine-trees. Sometimes his father took him along with him along the hilly roads with Dandy. 

In the bangalow of Bakrota, Devendranath regularly gave lessons to Rabindranath in Sanskrit, English, and Astrology.  In the  Astrology book written in English, Devendranath showed Rabindranath the stars and planets in the open sky.

What he learnt from the English text and from his father, he put them in an eassay which was published in Tattwabodhini magazine in short form. Probably this was his first published essay.

#### Return to tutoring
After about a four-months' tour to the Himalayas, Rabindranath came back  home with one of the assistants of Devendranath and was placed in the "Andarmahal"- amongst his near and dear ones. When he was under the administration of the 'retinue of servants' which he termed  'servocracy' he had his foundation of learning. His third elder brother Hemendranath, strong in Science and Mathematics, believed that before learning English one must be sufficiently strong in one's mother tongue (in this case Bengali).  Since then English spellings and meanings did not lie heavily on his shoulder like a nightmare.

Until then , even when he was within the house the day long, still  he felt that he was in exile. Now he got his seat inside his mother's room and got his friend, the youngest daughter-in-law of the family, wife of Jyotirindranath named Kadambari, who also took him with love and affection because he was the youngest brother-in-law, the most beloved one.

But he, again, had to go to Bengal Academy which he did not like and felt as if he was being imprisoned within the four walls of a prison. He expressed his feeling in the poem "Abhilas" written at the age of eleven. The poem was published in "Tattwabodhini" in 1281 (Bangabda) without mentioning his name. The previous eassay on Astrology published in the same magazine was also without his name.

The number of days he could not attend the school gradually became more than  the number of days he attended the school. As a result, one home tutor, named Gnanchandra Bhattacharya, was appointed. He was meritorious and his method of teaching was also unique. He taught Kumarsambhab of Kalidas and Macbeth of Shakespeare in the original and opened a new world to the mind of the young poet.  The teacher forced the learners to translate those pieces in  other languages also.

One day Rabindranath had to go to Vidyasagar  to recite before him one such  translated piece. On seeing the number of books in  the library of Vidyasagar, Rabindranath became overwhelmed with joy.

At this time he used to  publish his eassays and poetry anonymously. The first poetry in his own name was "Hindu Melar Upahar" published  in Bi-lingual Amrita Bazar Patrika  in February 1875. His age at that time was 13 yrs and 8 months.

The meeting of the Hindumela usually took place at Parsibagan of Upper Circular Road: Rajnarayan Bose was its Presidsent.  Rabindranath wrote this poem imitating the poetry , "Bajre Shinga Bajre", written by Poet Hemchandra Bandyopadhaya. In those days, the Bengali elite had memorised the " Bharat Sangeet". Once Rabindranath recited in a meeting of the elite, another poem, 'Prakritir Khed", which was written by him and was also expressed uniquely the pathos of the country. This was published in "Pratibimba" magazine in 1282, Baishakh (Bangabda).

He also wrote a song "Jwal Jwal Chita" for the dramma "Sarojini" written by Jyotirindrannath. In this year, from Agrahayan, 1282 to Kartik 1283, he wrote a serial, "Banaphul".  

Rabindranath, since his childhood, had a powerful imagination. He imagined that the bearers of the palanquin carried him to a fancy world and passed through faraway strange lands and he gave each country a name from the books he read. His imagination took him through a deep forest  where tiger's eyes blazed. Sometimes his palanquin became a peacock-boat, floating on the ocean  until the shore was out of sight. The water splashed gently on to the shore, the waves winged and swelled around them.
Role of a teacher; 
Sometimes he assumed the role of a teacher. The railings of the veranda were his students. They were afraid of him. Some of them were very naughty and cared nothing for their books. He told them with dire threats that when they  grew up they would be fit for nothing but casual labor. They bore the marks of his beating from head to foot, yet they did not stop being naughty. They would only stop at the end of his game.

At this time, he also wrote a song, "Ek sutre Gnathiyachi sahasrati mon" for the secret organisation (patriotic) of his elder brothers, led by Jyotirindranath, of which he  was also a member.

Rabindranath's attendance at Bengal Academy did not improve. He was frequently absent on one lame excuse or another, even after returning from the Himalayas.  He was then admitted to St.Xevier's school along with his other brothers. But the result was the same. In the meantime, Sarada Devi, wife of Devendranath, died in 1875,  when Ranindranath was fourteen years old. At the death of such a well organised housewife of the family, every thing became disorderly. The elder sisters and sisters-in-law of Rabindranath, being sympathetic to him,  also did not press him to go to school.
At home, Rabindranath began to study Bengali books, Bengali magazines and anything which he could lay his hands on. Specially, he began to study Baishnab Padabali. As a result, he was not promoted to the next class after the end of the year. This led to the discontinuation of his going to school and that  was the end of his school education at the age of 14+ when he was reading fifth standard, i.e., class VI.

#### Schooling summary
The summary of his School education was as follows :

1. At the age of 5 - in 1866 - Rituals for first lesson was done along with Somendranath.
2. At the age of 7- in 1868- he was admitted to Oriental Seminary and then to Normal School.
3. At the age of 10- in 1871- he was transferred to Bengal Academy, an Anglo-Indian School with the intention of  acquiring a better vocabulary in English.
4. At the age of 13- in 1874- he was admitted to St. Xavier's School. The last Indian School where he was admitted.


#### Creative activity
Rabindranath started his creative activity after returning from the Himalayas.  His "Prakritir Khed" was published in "Pratibimba", edited by Pandit Ramsarbaswar in its 1st issue, 1st year, Baishakh, 1282 Bangabda (1875).  After a few months, Pratibimba amalgamated with Gnanankur. When he was a boy of 13+, he wrote in this magazine his first Novel in Poetry, Banaful as a serial. His elder brother Somendranath published it as a book in 1880. This book was not re-printed- it was included in the collection of Tagore's uncirculated work.

Gnanankur published some other Tagore's poem. It was only possible for Rabindranath to write in such a language at that age. .

Rabindranath began to write essays too at this stage. He wrote three essays- Bhuban Mohini Pratibha, Abasar Sarojini and Dukhyosangini in 1876 - in which he discussed the qualities of a  lyric, an epic and small poetry and said that "Banaful" was below the standard of  any of the three. These were the first essays written by Rabindranath.

While reading in Normal School, at the age of eight, Rabindranath began to practice writing poetry  under the influence of Jyoti, a son of a niece of the father of Rabindranath. He finished the "blue manuscript book" with the words "like the hive of some insect, with a network of variously slanting lines and the thin and thick strokes of letters.". When he was reading in Bengal Academy, in the year 1873, he went to Bolpur with his father Debendranath, enroute to Dalhousie,  and there he wrote a drama-"Prithwiraj Parajoy"  at the age of twelve, sitting under a coconut tree .. But the manuscript of the book was lost. Though it was similar to Rudrachandra, written after few days.. His attendance in school did not improve even after coming back from the Himalayas.. He was then at St. Xavier.s School in 1874. He translated in Bengali verse from  Kumar Sambhaba, the original book in Sanskrit and Macbeth in English. Some of these translations were published in Bharati, later on, .without mentioning his name. He also had to recite those translations in front of Vifdyasagar one day when he visited his place with Ramsarbaswa. At the age of twelve, his first poetry Abhilash was published in Tattwabodhini Patrika (in Agrahayan of 1796 Shakabda). He wrote a song "Jwal jwal chita, dwigun, dwigun." for the drama Sorojini of Jyodirindranath without mentioning his name.The first poetry, Hindu Melar Upahar ,mentioning his name of  was published in Bilingual magazine "Amrita Bazar Patrika " which was also recited by him in the  Annual Festival of Hindu Mela.. He was then thirteen years eight months. The poetry was written in the line of "baj re singa baj, ei rabe" written by Hemchandra Bandyopadhaya.He also wrote another poetry Prakritir Khed  which he read in a gathering of learned people person. The then Sadharani Patrika published the Prakritir Khed wrtten by Rabindranath was so alluring that the depressed condition of the country became visible when it was read in the gathering.It was published in Pratibimba edited by Pandit Ramsarbaswa..Gnanankur was amalgamated  with Pratibimba. "Banaful" , the first kabya-novel of Rabindranath, was published in serial in this magazine  from Agrahayan 1282- Kartik 1283..His age at that time was not more than thirteen when he wrote Banaful..Later on Somendranatjh, in March 1880, published it as a  Book.Some other short poem of boy Rabi was also published in  Gnanankur. Rabindranath also wrote Critical Essay at this stage (1876) in Gnanankur, .Bhuban Mohini Prtiva.  In a discussion about the thtee Kabyas "Mohini Mohan Prativa, Abasar Sarojini and Duukha Sangini " , he enunciated  the three forms,  a lyric, an epic and a short poem and proved that the three Kabyas were not upto the standard.Within the age of fifteen Rabindranath, showed his efficiencies   in writing Poetry, Kabya, Essay and in recitation, singing.   .  

Sarada Devi, mother of Rabindranath, died in 1875. Hindu Mela gradually became a cultural organisation and this organisation could not help in bringing freedom to the country. Hence, under the leadership of Jyotirindranath and Rajnarayan Basu,  another organistation, Sanjibani Sabha, a secret revolutionary one, was formed in Tagore's house.  The sittings were held in a tumbledown building in an obscure Calcutta lane. Its proceedings were shrouded in mystery. In fact, there was nothing in their deliberations or doings of which Govt or people needed to be afraid.  Even Rabindranath became a member. Rabindranath wrote a song for this organisation, "Eksutre Bnadhiyavhi Sahasrati Jiban". The boy Rabindranath wrote a poem and recited it in Tenth Annual Function of Hindu Mela in 1877. The poetry was inspiring. Viceroy Lord Lytton with usual pomp and grandeur arranged in  famine stricken Delhi to welcome Queen Victoria and he addressed her as Empress of India (Bharat Samrangi). Rabindranath's poetry was a real answer to the inhuman attitude of Lord Lytton. After writing this poetry (attached in the margin ) Rabindranath wrote another Kabya Kabi-Kahini , which was  published in Bharati. Later on, it was printed as a book in 1878. This was his first printed book of Rabindranath. Kabi-Kahini was praised by Kaliprasanna, editor of Bandhab Patrika and others.  


Ahmedabad, Shahibaug : After about five years of discontinuation from school, it was decided that Rabindranath be sent to England to become a Barrister. To prepare him, especially with adequate knowledge of English, he was sent to Satyendranath, then residing at Ahmedabad. Rabindranath stayed for a few months in Shahibaug, Ahmaedabad where he had to stay alone in a big palace as his sister-in-law was in England with her children and Satyendranath remained out on his job. He always read English there in the library of Satyendranath and tried to understand with a dictionary and his imagination. He didn't stop his creation . He was a constant supplier of articles to Bharati. He wrote critical essays on the works of Goethe, Dante, Petrarch etc. First thing he did in Ahmedabad was to set his own songs to music.  Here he constructed lyric and music of  "Niraba rajani dakho magna jochanaya", "Boli o amar golapabala", etc. To increase his English vocabulary he was sent to Satyendranath's friend, Atmaram Panduranga, whose daughter Anna Tarkhar was well versed in English. Rabindranath would improve his vocabulary with her help. Here Rabindranath did one thing to increase his knowledge and vocabulary. He translated Kabikahini in English and recited those before Anna Tarkhar. Anna Tatkhar asked him  to give her a name. Rabindranath gave her the name Nalini and wrote a poe ,

Shuno Nalini, kholo go Ankhi -  
Ghum ekhono Bhngilo na ki !  
Dekho , Tomari Duara pare  
Sakhi, eseche tomari Rabi //  

In England Rabindranath went straight to Brighton accompanying Satyendranath where his sister-in-law lived with her children. He was admitted in a Public School. Within a very short time,  he practiced  English Dance and learnt many English songs. He had private tutor for teaching him Latin. He went to Devonshire for a week end and wrote a poem, "Magna Bhagnatari". 

Tarak Nath Palit,  a friend of Satyendranath, took him to London University. Rabindranath liked the method of teaching there, specially Prof. Henry Morley. In London, he attended Parliamentary sittings.  He heard the lecture of Gladstone and observed Old Brighton listening silently.

He wrote regularly of his experiences, later compiled as "Europe Prabasir Patra", which was published in Bharati. After coming back to India he took one and half years to publish the book. In London he stayed in the house of Dr. Scott. He wrote a poem "Dui Din", mentioning the two daughters of Dr. Scott. He didn't complete his  studies in London and had to come back home at the request of his guardians.
After coming back home he found that a rehearsal was going on for a drama Manmoyee written by Jyotirindranath, Rabindranath joined the program and wrote a song "Ay tabe sahachari, hate hate dhari dhari". 
In  London he wrote one or two poems and started a kabya "Bhagnahriday".  

Usually lyrics are constructed first and music with notations are attributed later on. But in Tagore family things became reversed. Jyotirindranath played the instrument and asked Rabindranath to put words in it. Showers of songs were coming out through his mouth. In Rabindranath's language, "Eibar chutlo amar ganer phoara."  In 1881 Rabindranath prepared 7 Brahma Sangeet for Magh Utsab. He was also asked to write drama for the ensuing Viddwatjjana Sabha. He wrote Valmiki Prativa , a lyrical  drama in which he took the main role of Valmiki..   

Valmiki Prativa was one of Tagore's major early creations. Valmiki Pratibha was not a composition which will bear being read. Its significance is lost if it is not heard sung and seen acted. After Valmiki Prativba, Rabindranath wrote  two other musical plays of the same type: Kal mrigaya and Mayar Khela.
In  1881, Rabindranath wrote two Kabyas -Rudrachanda and Bhagnahriday. Rudrachanda was just a reprint of Prithwiraj Parajoy, a lyric drama written on his first visit of Santiniketan in 1873, the manuscript of which was lost. It earned fame in those days from literary persons. Rabindranath said like Goethe that he was eighteen. Once Goethe said, "when I was eighteen all my country was eighteen".
Bhagna Hriday was a large lyric written in the form of a drama (34 sarga). Maharaja Birchandra Manikya of Tripura sent his personal clerk, Radharaman Ghosh, to express the Maharaja's appreciation.
A meeting was arranged in Kolkata Medical College by Bethune Society. Rabindranath gave his first lecture on "Sangeet O Bhab" with example in that meeting.
He wrote many small essays while staying with Jyotirindranath in Chandannagar in the same year and a novel- "Bauthakuranir Hat"   and a series of poetry, published in Sandhya Sangeet.

The daughter, Lila, of Rajnarayan Basu ,was married with Krishnakumar Mitra. Rabindranath sung many songs written by him on that occasion. The songs were published in Tattwabodhini Patrika in Bhadra,1803. These were the first songs of marriage. The songs were, "Dui hridayer nadi", " Jagater Purohit", "Subhodin Eseche Dnohe" . The books published in this year were Valmiki Pratbha, Bhagna Hriday, Rudrachanda, Europe Prabasir Patra.

The material for Bauthakuranir Hat was taken from the life of Pratapaditya taken from the book Bangadhipaparajay (1869) of Pratap Chandra Ghosh. Rabindranath also collected some stories from different sources. Durgeshnandini was the first novel  written by Bankimchandra in Bengali in 1865.

Rabindranath said, later, that his mind had emerged into an open field after leaving the four walls of the house begun to roam through an unknown world.

After about thirty years, the poet wrote a drama (1909)- Prayashchittya,  based on the story of this novel. After 20 years of this date (1929)  he wrote "Paritran" and in the middle (1922)  - Muktadhara.

He also wrote some critical essays on Meghnad Badh Kabya. and Baul Sangeet which attracted the minds of the then literary persons.

"Bharati" was reorganised at this stage and a costitution was forrmed . As per constitution, Rajendralal Mitra was elected as President and Krishna Behari Sen, the brother of Keshab Chandra Sen, and Rabindranath was elected joint Secretaries.  Rabindranath felt that Vidyasagar's advice of not going to big personalities for help had been further endorsed. He wrote his experience in an essay. However, Rabindranath took much interest when after some time in Bangiya Sahitya Parishad an attempt was made to find out similar words in Bengali of English words.   

In 1881-1882, amongst other things Rabindranath finished  3 important projects, 1. Bauthakuranir Hat, a novel, 2. Sandhya Sangeet, comprising 26 poems and, 3. Pravat Sangeet, comprising 16 poems. Some poems published in Sandhya Sangeet had been placed in Hriday Aranya.

Jyotidada and his wife went out trvelling and  Rabindranath was left alone. He passed his time alone in the vacant rooms and the roof of second floor. Rabindranath felt freed of all bondage and his creativity flowed freely. The poetry which he wrote then was purely of his own, even though they may not have been superlative. This was the first time that the poetry bore Rabindranath's own style and he was pleased about this. The honing of his poetic techniques came later. Some of this poetry were pessimistic. Pravat Sangeet was alive with passion, of course. In Nirjharer Swapna Bhagna, one of the most famous of its poems, he celebrates and exults in the new.

While compiling for printing, Rabindranath discarded many poems, excepting those that were to later become Bhanu Singher Padabali. In his old age, he wanted to discard Sandhya Sangeet also but he disisted because of the objections raised by many.

In 1882, Kamala, the daughter of Ramesh Chandra Dutta was married to P. N. Basu. BankimChandra and Rabindranath both were present on the occasion. Bankim Chandra was so pleased with Sandhya Sangeet that he offered the garland, offered to  him, to Rabindranath Tagore as a mark of recognition of the book, Sandhya Sangeet.

In autumn (1882) Rabindranath went to Darjeeling with Jyotidada and Kadambari. He thought that the feelings of Pravat Sangeet would jump to a height in Darjeeling but nothing  remarkable happened. Only he was able to create another Kabya "Pratidhwani".

In this year Kalmrigaya was staged on the occasion of Biddwatjana Samagama.

Jyotirindranath was a very good organiser. He was good at choosing the right person for the right posts. He wanted to start a Literary Academy by bringing together all the men of letters of repute. The object of this Literary Academy was to find authoritative technical terms for the Bengali language and to assist its growth. Dr. Rajendrahal Mitra took up the idea of this Academy with enthusiasm, and he was eventually its president for the short time it lasted. Rabindranath went to Pandit Vidyasagar and request him to join. Vidyasagar gave patient hearing to Rabindranath's explanation of its objects and the list of names proposed for the academy and said that his suggestion was to leave them out of the list for nothing could be achieved with big wigs because they would never agree with one another. Bankim Babu became a member but did not take much interest in it. So long as Rajendrahal Mitra took the chair, he did everything single handed.

Pandit Vidyasagar's prophecy was fulfilled and the academy withered away shortly after sprouting.  


Karwar was the headquarter of the Kannara district in the southern portion of the Bombay Presidency. Satyendranath was posted there as a judge.The little harbour, ringed round with the Malaya hills. Its crescent shaped beach throws out its arms to the shoreless open sea like the very image of an eager striving to embrace the infinite. The edge of the broad sandy beach was fringed with a forest of casuarinas, broken at one end by the "Kala nadi" or Kali river into the sea after passing through a gorge flanked by rows of hills on either side. In one moonlit evening Rabindranath and others went up this river in a little boat and stopped at one of Shivaji's old hill forts. They sat on a spot where moonbeams fell glancing off the top of the outer enclosure, and there ate the food they had brought with them.The night brooded over the motionless hills and forests, and on the silent flowing stream of this little Kalanadi throwing over all its moonlight spell. It took a good time to reach the mouth of the river. The deep silence of this illimitable whiteness they  walked along with their shadows , without a word. The sleep came over their eyes when they reached home..

Karwar is the administrative headquarters of  Uttara Kannada district in Karnatak, India. It is a seaside town situated on the banks of Kali river which is on the west coast of the Indian peninsula. The Karwar is derived from a nearby village called Kadwad (as the British could not pronounce "d" and replaced r for d.)

Karwar was an ancient site of sea trade visited by the Arabs, Dutch, Portuguese, French and later the British. The Sadashivgad fort is of historical importance situated by the Kali river bridge. Karwar was a part of the Maratha empire during the 18th century. After the defeat of the Marathas in the Third war of Anglo-Maratha, it became a part of the British territory.

Here Rabindranath wrote many articles, drama, song, poetry and short essays. His best creation in this period was "Prakritir Pratishod". This drama was not in the background of songs. Only the monk's dialogue was in the verse.


After leaving Karwar, Jyotirindranath, his wife and Rabindranath, came to a garden house on the Circular Road, near Chowrangee. To the south there was a large basti visible from Rabindranath's room. Rabindranath would often sit near the window and watch the sights of the people of the basti, their comings and goings. It seemed to be a living story to him. His first book, "Morning Songs", came to an end. .He painted the pictures he saw around him in the book, "Pictures and Songs." (Chabi o Gaan).

He wrote many essays at this stage, the titles of which were, Lekha Kumari o Chapa Sundari, Gnop o Dim, Chnechiye Bala, Jihba Asphalan, National Fund, Akal Kushmanda, Hate Kalame. All eassays were satires. He wrote, in an eassay, about the spread of education in Bengali medium. In his opinion education in English medium would not spread throughout Bengal.



#### Amdavad
About five years had elapsed since Rabindranath returned from the Himalayas and there was no sign of improvement in his formal education. The anxious guardians were wondering whether he might be sent to England for studying law but before that he was sent to Ahmedabad to his second elder brother, Satyendranath, to improve his English vocabulary.

Satyendranath stayed in a big house meant for the Judge at Shahibag, on the bank of Sabarmati River in Ahmedabad.  During the day, Satyendranath used to remain in the court and his wife and children were in London at that time. Rabindranath usually passed his time in the library reading books, specially in English with the help of a dictionary and using his imagination.

Simultaneously, he was writing articles for "Bharati" on various famous Eurpean writers. He roamed about the house from top to bottom and sang to himself.  His first music composition in music of a set of songs was created here- "Nirab rajani dyakho mogna jochanaya", "Boli o amar golap bala" and others.  He wrote poetry also which were simply translations of English poems.

But he could not develop  his vocabulary in English alone. He was removed to the house of a friend of Styendranath, Atmaram Panduranga, whose daughter, Anna, was well versed in English. Rabindranath was a poet and used to recite poems several times which the girl would commit to memory. One day, she asked Rabindranath to give her a name. Rabindranath gave her a name and wrote a poem using the word. Anna used to listen songs of Rabindranath almost everyday and they became closely acquainted. Rabindranath remembered her even in his old age.  In the "Shaishab Sangeet Kabya,"  there are references to  his close relationship with Anna.

#### UK
Rabindranath sailed for UK accompanying his second elder brother Stayendranath from Bombay boarding the Ship "Puna" on 20th Sept., 1878. Satyendranath took a long leave to stay in UK where his wife with two children had gone earlier. They first landed in Brindis, Italy, had a journey on land through the tunnel of Alps and went  to Paris. There they visited an art Exhibition, organised after the fall of the monarchy and establishment of  a Republic in France.

After reaching England they went straight to Brighton where Satyendranath's family stayed. Rabindranath saw the two beloved children (Surendranath and Indira) and was delighted. He stayed there and was admitted in a Public School. He made many friends (boys and girls) at the school, and attended a dance party on invitation. Every one loved this young handsome boy. He learnt many English songs also and was passing his time nicely.

One day Tarak Nath Palit, a High Court advocate and a friend of Satyendranath, came and asked Satyendranath to send him to London without further wasting time in a suburban  town.

He arranged everything and Rabindranath was brought to London and began to stay in a house in front of Regent Park. He began learning Latin from a private tutor and then he was taken to a teacher named Barker who used to prepare students for admission to College and University.

Ultimately, Rabindranath was admitted to London University  where he studied English literature from Prof. Henry Morley. He enjoyed this experience.  
At that time, he stayed as a boarder with the Scott family in London. Dr Scott  had  two girls. Both of them loved Rabindranath .  

He attended a session of the House of Commons to hear William Gladstone and John Bright who spoke on Irish Home Rule. He wrote a poem "Dui Din" here which was published in his "Sandhya Sangeet. " He wrote many letters "Europe Prabasir Patra" that was published in 1881. Here Rabindranath passed most of his time by writing essays on Western civilization, their attitude, behavior and sent them to be published in "Bharati". Reading all these essays, his guardians asked him to come back to India. He came back to India after about one and half years without obtaining any degree or passing any formal examination.


#### Return
There was a second attempt at sending him to England. 

It was settled that this time Satyaprasad, son of his elder sister,  would accompany him. Satyaprasad had been recently married and after reaching Madras they changed their mind and decided to return home.

They went to Mussouri to see Devendranath who accepted their decision without recriminations.


#### Marriage
On 9 December 1883, Rabindranath was married to Bhabatarini, daughter of Benimadhab Roychoudury of Jessore, a pirali Brahmin. Her name was changed to Mrinalini.  Under the instruction of Debendranath through a letter, she was admitted to Loreto School. Rabindranath was affectionate and caring to his wife..


Mrinalini Devi (1872-1902), Wife of Rabindranath

Mrinalini Devi was born in 1872 at Jessore (in present Bangladesh). Her father Benimadhab Raichoudhuri was a clerk in the estate of Debendranath Tagore. As Devendranath was a Pyrali Brahmin, it was not easy to get a girl from higher ranks of  Brahmins. Benimadhab's daughter was chosen as a bride of Rabindranath and they were married on 9 December 1883 at Jorasanko hurriedly.  Rabindranath was summoned from Satyendranath's residence. 

Before marriage her name was Bhabatarini. At the time of the marriage Rabindranath was 22 years old and Bhabatarini was 12. She was quite thin at that time, not very good-looking and was almost illeterate with an old-fashioned outlook. 

To speak frankly, she was not a good match for Rabindranath. In an attempt to groom her, she was admitted in Loreto School. Rabindranath was very caring and dutiful.  Five months after the marriage, Kadambari Devi,  wife of Jyotirindranath, committed suicide leaving a lasting effect on Rabindranath. 

On 25 October 1886, Mrinalini gave birth to her first child Madurilata, nicknamed Bela, in Kolkata.
Rabindranath went on a family tour to Darjeeling with his wife, daughter, sister, and nephew. 
 
On 27 November,1888, Mrinalini gave birth to another child (male), Rathindranath.

Rabindranath's young family was at the centre of his life. He was deeply upset at having to leave them in order to go to England in August 1890. A letter that he wrote to his wife from the ship stated that he felt his spirit left his body  to come and see her. His eldest daughter Madhurilata was four at that time and his eldest son Rathi was two. He returned to home from England in November 1890. But he could not take his family with him when he first went to live in Shelidah on Zamindari work since their house was not yet built. He lived in the old family house boat called the Padmaboat.

He sent his wife and children to Sholapur in Maharashtra where Satyendranath was posted at that time.

He wrote very frequently to his wife and, as his letters show, he  waited anxiously and longingly for her reply.

The concerns he was sharing were about their togetherness, her happiness, his life, their children's future, and the marriages of their daughters. Both Bela and his second daughter Renuka or Rani were married in 1901, with one month's gap, when they were fouteen and twelve years old, respectively. He worried especially about Rani's ability to make the transition. He wrote,

Bird's build their nests with straw. It matters little to them to leave their homes and go. But we build ours with our minds . That becomes an invisible shelter in all that we do, in our work, our reading and writing , our thinking. Just as a cart makes grooves on its journey which we can feel in the swaying of our bodies, a mind involuntarily settles into the grooves it makes with the mind's eye, and we don't want to get out of them even when there is occasion for it.    

Attempt was being made to get his book 'Rajarshi' in the list of approved books for schools.

Sometmes Rabindranath wrote to his wife that he felt very restless when his mind turned to Beli (affectionate derivative of Bela) and Khoka (common Bengali name for a male child). He further added that probably, Beli was not taking her food regularly and was afraid that Khoka might forget him . Rabindranath called his wife Choto Bau and wrote to her,

> " Did you think of me when I was ill on the ship?  I was dying to return home to you. These days I am convinced there is no place like home.I am not going anywhere after I get back from this trip. I have taken a bath today after a whole week. It is no fun to bathe in salty water. One's hair gets all knotted and the body feels sticky. I have decided not to bathe again till I leave the ship."  
"We have one more week to reach Europe. It will be such a relief to be  on land again. I am tired of being on the sea day and night."  
"I wrote to you day before yesterday, I am writing to you again today. You may get both the letters on the same day, what is the harm? We shall be landing tomorow - all the more reason for writing you today. I will be writing to you again on reaching England."
Rabindranath wrote to his wife in detail of his journey to England and came  back home after one month.

Rabindranath was given the charge of looking after the zamindari of Debendranath as there was no one else in the Tagore family capable of doing the job after the death of Hemendranath. At the begining he was trained in the office. Then he was asked to go to Shelaidah in North Bengal (at present Bangladesh) to visit the place of work. He wrote to his wife,

> 'I got your letter just as I was leaving Shelaidah this morning. It made me sad. But the thought of your returning to Calcutta cheered me up. Otherwise I would not have come to  Calcutta now.I am not feeling too well either and wishing that you were with me. I was sure in my mind that it would be for the best that all of you stay in Sholapur for as long as possible.I had hoped that the children would study well there and grow up healthy. Anyway not everything can be in one's control. We have to make do with what comes our way and dutifully do the best we can under these circumstances.That is all that is humanly possible. 
Please don't nurse any discontent within yourself, choto-bou; that does more harm than good. Let us just carry on resolutely with contentment and a smile.With my brooding temperament I know that I suffer unnecessarily. I want you to stay happy, otherwise our prospect looks bleak.You know, my dear, how intense I am by nature. But you don't know how hard I work to keep calm. Please help me overcome my discontent, and please never join me in it.
If you are already on your way, I shall see you when I am in Calcutta this time. I shall try to arrange for you to come with me to Orissa. It is a very healthy place. I have already told father what I want to do, I think he understands. I may get my way if I talk to him once or twice more still it is best not to raise our hopes. I have a feeling this letter may reach you while you are still in Solapur. It may be eight or ten days more  you can start. Let's see.
My boat is slowly moving along the whole day . It is already evening but we have not yet made it to Pabna. Once we are  there we shall have to go on for many more miles by palanquin."

Rabindrnath wrote to Mrinalini from Shelaidah in 1892. 

Rabindrnath was caring to his wife and children and kept himself updated writing letters to his wife.

> "Yesterday, I received from Dickinson's a bill for Rs. 182, together with a reminder for payment. I shall have to borrow from Satya (his nephew and a finance manager of sorts for the Jorasanko household) again. I shall then owe him nine hundred rupees. Has he given you four hundred rupees? He has not written to me about it yet. There is news of you in Bibi's (his niece Indira Devi Choudhurani) letter today. She writes that you often visit them- that our little one makes all kinds of gestures and sounds in mejo-bouthan's lap. I so long to see her. She will have changed a lot if I spend the whole month of Ashar in the country . Is Khoka also learning to sing along with Beli? Is his voice shaping well? He should be taught not just the sa re ga ma  for voice training but also a song as a start. Otherwise, he soon will lose interest. When I was a boy, I disliked being taught sa re ga ma by Bishnu. I used to be so happy on the days he taught me a song. Why don't you also learn singing with the children? You and I can sit together on a rainy day and talk of music when I am back home. What do you feel?"

He wrote another day,

> "You know from my letter to Beli that I was not able to come today. I have stayed home. The post arrived, there were three letters but none from you . I did not expect one but wondered if by divine chance you could have written one by mistake! The joy of living separately is in writing letters to one another. It can be more rewarding than being together. When we write letters we can come closer to each other with only a few words and get as much of each other as possible by way of those few words. What we say to each other when we meet can fade away in the instant excitement of meeting each other. Really and truly, writing letters can become a deeper and more intimate experience of  knowing ourselves than just seeing each other. Don't you agree?"
> 
> " I do constantly try not to worry about our children. It is our duty to see to it that they are well behaved and that they get a good education Beyond that it is a mistake to dwel on them. They will grow up to do their life's work in their own way be it good , bad, or indifferent. It is, of course, true that they are our children, but they are also individuals in their own right. We will not have much control over the way they live their lives.Let us do our duty by them but let us not expect too much from them. It is God's hands how they turn out as human beings. It is from a certain vanity that we expect the best from our own progeny. We have no right to do that. After all, are we all that concerned about other children who had hard lives?"  
" The future is uncertain no matter how we live. Therefore, it is only sensible that we should simply do our duty and not think of the outcome . We have to forever learn to take both good and bad -- and we must restrain ourselves every time there is an urge to deviate from that path. We have our past, and we can have no prior knowledge about our future . Therefore, all that is possible is to do our work diligently, wherever we are and  whatever the work is . We must also try to be happy and make others happy. If after that we fail it should no matter to us. We must accept and remember that the results are in God's hands once we have done our part. We must at least try to free our minds from expectations."

Rabindranath wrote letters regularly to his wife but he only occasionally received letters from her. He was delighted when he got a reply from his wife. One day he got two replies at a time. He wrote,
" I am so delighted to get all of two letters from you today. Unfortunately, I am unable to respond... because I must go to Bolpur today.  I have read out to father my address for the Seventh of Poush
celebrations (Seventh of Poush was the foundation day of Santiniketan Ashram). He has asked me to expand it a bit here and there. I have to get down to that now. There is only an hour left to finish it."
"Please don't work any harder for my happiness. Your love is enough. But it would be very nice if you and I could work together and think together with one mind. I know that cannot always happen even if we wish it. It will make me happy if you could join me in all that we do - and give me much joy if you agree to learn what I want to be learnt... It is easier to move forward if we are so united. I don't wish to leave  you out of anything  I do, but I hesitate to thrust my will on you. Everyone has  the right to do things their way, as they would like to. It may not be possible for you to agree with my wishes and inclinations every time -- I would not worry about it. It is good enough if you agree with my life the way you do with your love."
In another letter he wrote,
" I am back to my writing at the end of the festivities. I am just like a fish back in its own habitat when I can return to my writing. The solitude of this place has given me perfect shelter; none of the trivialities of daily life can touch me any more, so I am able to forgive ny enemies easily. I can well understand how this solitude may not appeal to you. I would have been so happy  if only I could have given you even a portion of my feeling for solitude. But such things can not be given. I can understand how you would miss the hustle and bustle of Calcutta in the first few days when you came here. I can also imagine that it may not be easy for you to cope with so much quiet even after you get used to it.
But when can I do if I can't stand the atmosphere of our Calcutta household any better? When I am there I feel a continuous irritation over every little thing , and lose my peace of mind. Besides, I know that Rathi will not get an adequate education there since everybody around is so restless. You will, therefore, have to accept this exile till I am able to move you to a better place. I cannot surrender my inherent nature to live in Calcutta.
The whole sky is thick with clouds and it has just began to rain. I have closed the glass windows in my room and I am enjoying the rain while I sit and write to you. You don't have this grand view from your room on the second storey.It is so beautiful to see this new rain falling on the rice fields on all sides, I am writing an essay on Meghdut...." ( This letter was written by Rabindranath to Mrinalini Devi in June 1901.)

After Bela's marriage,  Rabindranath had to take her to her father-in-law's house and informed his wife,
"I have left Bela at her husband's home. Things are not what you imagine them to be from far away. Bela seems to be quite happy there. I believe she is enjoying the new life. She does not need us in the same way now. It is important for a newly married girl to be away from her parents so that she gets time and space to feel comfortable in her new home. The proximity of parents can hinder this process because the two families are inevitably different in habit and taste. Even in little ways with parents around, it is difficult for a girl to forget her earlier life. If she must be given away, why cling on? It is her happiness and peace we must ensure, not ours. If that is more important, why must we burden her with more attachment.

Believe me, Bela is all right . We should find peace in the thought that she is happy. Things would not have been good if we had not let go of her and her husband.  We will continue to love her as before, even more, now that she is far away. We shall enjoy a new and expectant love when they come to us for the pujas, or when we visit them on occasion. Distance is important in all love. Simply surrounding each other may not necessarily be for the good. We will do the same for Rani after her marriage. She must of course stay with us for the first couple of years but when the time is right she must be sent away for her own well-being.
Our family is very different from other Bengali families in culture and taste, language, and neutrality. That is all the more why our girls must stay away from us after they are married. Otherwise, small matters about the husband's family will begin to  tell on their nerves and weaken respect and feeling. We must be particularly mindful about Rani, given her temperament. She will change once she leaves us behind.
Just think back about yourself. If I had stayed on at Phultala ( Mrinalini Devi's home town in the Jessore district  of East Bengal)."

He wrote to Mrinalini from Shelaidah in June 1901,
"I have arrived here  after quite a dangerous journey. There were whirlwinds during the first three days which made it  impossible for the boat to move. When we finally but slowly started again we fell into a beel.  As you know, a beel is like a sea, everywhere there is lot of water. All one could see was submerged grain peeping out above the water, or villages looking like small islands as they tried to stay afloat. The cows cannot graze, the people have no ground to walk on. They move from village to village by boat.You cannot imagine such a scene from Bolpur. Every where there is moss floating on the waters, the lotus, the blue flower, also black weed - all producing such a rotten smell. I see kites floating over our heads to catch fish. My mind turns wistful in the evenings on these endless still waters. Things are much more varied when one is on the sea. Also, the sea makes a noise- that is not so here. It is absolutely quite all around. Just the sound of the water from the passing ferry boat.
When the faint moonlight falls on the scene, I really wonder if I am in the world of the dead. I switch off my light, draw my armchair out near the window, and sit absolutely still in the moonlight.The peace of this massive water touches my heart fully. Day before yesterday, there was a storm over this beel from clouds gathering from the western sky.Luckily for us, our boat was floating on a rice field so that we could drop an anchor quickly and somehow manage to cling to the earth below. We started out as soon as the storm was over. But as our luck would have it there was another storm suddenly. This time, too, we  found a safe place by God's grace. Or else there was no knowing where the storm would have taken us.
On arrival here I was informed that I shall have to appear in court this coming Monday. So I must set out tomorrow. I may not get the time to write to you while  I am in Calcutta,  given that there is always so much going on there. That is why I am writing from here. I feel better for having lived on the waters these few days in absolute quite and peace. if I want to recover my broken health , the only way for me is to surrender to these waters. Yet another storm has risen while I am writing to you. Topsi is dropping anchor . I hope to get news from you once I am in Calcutta."
This letter was written by Rabindranath from Kaligram in 1901.     


##### Death
Rabindranath's wife died after a brief illness in 1902. He wrote the smaran poems to enshrine her memory. "Mrinalini Devi loved to live a joyful life with her relatives", wrote Prafullamayee Devi, the mother of Balendranath.  

In October 1902, Mrinalini's illness took a serious turn. At the same time, Renuka's illness was also added to their anxieties. A few days later, Rabindranath wrote to Monaranjan Bandyopadhyay that he was deeply absorbed in dealing with the ailments of his family members. "My wife's illness shows no sign of improvement. Renuka got a sore throat and Mira was attacked with fever from last night."  Renuka's sore throat turned out to be a symptom of tuberculosis. Detection of the disease was a bit late.The antibiotic for the disease had not been invented at that time.
Renuka's health was not good from her childhood. She looked sick amongst the others-- this is visible from her photographs. She was very obstinate. She did not like to dress well. Her youngest sister, Mira, wrote that all the girls were not meant for going through family life. Ranidi was of that type. It would have been better if her father did not arrange for her marriage at such an young age. She read books most of the time. She did not pass her time gossiping.
Satyababu, with whom she was married, had been sent abroad for study by Rabindranath but he came back home unsuccessful and was ciritcised by the women in the family. This gave her a great shock. Renuka suffered from fever for a few days in silence. Mira thought that her sister may not have wanted to live: but she was, at that time, only 9 years old and she may not have got the story right.
Within a few days, Mrinalini became worse. Bedpan, stomach tube and other accessories were brought for her. Dr. D. N. Chattopadhyay (Alopath), Dr. J. N. Majumdar and Dr. D. N. Roy (both Homeopath) were coming frequently. Rathindranath wrote that the Alopath Doctors could not diagonise the disease due to which  his father consulted Homeopath Doctors. They were all respectful to his father and gave him the same rank in Homeopathy as they possessed.  They used to prescribe medicine in consultation with his father.  But all their attempts were fruitless.   Indira Devi and some others complained that the result might have been different if there had been a change of doctors.
The dying bed of Mrinalini was arranged on the first floor of Rabindranath's own  red building. The room was a long one and made into three by a partition with two almirahs. In one room, Mira and others lived. Mrinalini was kept in the roomof the last corner towards the west so that she could stay there peacefully. In front stood a tall building in which Gaganendranath lived, and the room was dark and had little ventilation. There was no electric fan. Nobody could say whether Mrinalini suffered more in these conditions. Mira came to learn from her elder aunt (wife of Dwijendranath) that Rabindranath fanned his wife whole night with a palmtree made fan, simply sitting by her side.
Hemalata Devi also wrote that for about two months Mrinalini was bed-ridden. The poet did not rely on paid nurses. It might be noted here that a paid nurse and an attendant were appointed at the last stage of her ailment. Considering the seriousness of Mrinalini's disease, Rabindranath's childrens were brought from Shantiniketan to Jorasanko.     
   
Day by day, Mrinalini was getting worse. Rathindranath wrote that on the day before the death of his mother,  his father called him to his mother's room and asked him to sit by her bedside.
She had lost her voice by that time. Rathi saw his mother for the last time and tears silently trickled down her eyes. His father asked all his sisters and brothers to go to the second floor for the night. An unknown anxiety haunted them throughout the night and they passed a  sleepless night. Early in the morning, they tried to see the red-coloured building from the verandah. The whole house was covered in darkness and there was a pin-drop-silence. No sign of life was visible. They felt from the core of their heart that their mother was no more. She had been taken away to burning ghat.
It was unbelievable that even the eldest son Rathi was not allowed to go with his mother's dead body.
Mrinalini Devi was married at the age ten, on 9 December 1883 when Rabindranath was 22. She was married for 19 years less 17 days when she died at the age of 29 years.
Hemalata Devi (second wife of Dipendranath, son of Dwijendanath) narrated the story after the death of her aunt-in-law. In the next night her husband (Dipendranath) came and said that their aunt had died. Uncle (Rabindranath) went to the roof alone and asked to be alone. It was learnt that the poet passed the whole night walking about the roof. His father Maharshidev was still alive . On hearing the news of the death of his son's wife, he said that he did not worry about Rabi, who would go on with his writings and readings. He felt sorry for the young children.
On the next day many people came to condole the sad demise. Rathindranath described that his father replied patiently to every body calmly and controlled himself with great difficulty. When every body went away, Rabindranath called Rathi and offered him the slipper which his mother put on regularly and asked him to keep that with him and then he silently went to his room.   



In 1903, Renuka (Rani) died, nine month's after her mother's death. In 1907, the same fate befell his youngest child Samindranath (Sami). Sami was then only eleven years old and died of Cholera while on a visit to Monghyr in Bihar. 

While nursing Rani in Almora in her last days, Rabindranath wrote the 'Sisu' poems to amuse Sami who had to be left with relatives. Bela died in 1918. The only two children who lived were his elder son, Rathindranath (Rathi), and his youngest daughter, Mira. In 1906, Rathindranath was sent to the University of Illinois at Urbana to study agriculture so that he would have the expertise on his return to work for the improvement of rural life. The following year, Mira was married to Nagendranath Ganguli, who too was sent to Urbana to study agriculture. The marriage did not last, and Rabindranath did not compel Mira to return to her husband. If anything, as is evident from his letters in this context, he blamed himself for Mira not marrying again. He worried about Mira and was heartbroken when her son Nitindranath (Nitu), his only grandson, died at the prime of his life in 1932, aged  twenty-one. During 30 years from 1902 to 1932, Rabindranath lost  five important lives in his life; his wife, his three children, and one grandson.

Rabindranath once suffered a nervous breakdown of which the only record is a letter he wrote to Rathi, very probably in 1915. Inspite of all that went wrong in his life, he continued with every activity and kept his personal pain to himself.        

Immediately after Mrinalini's death, even when Renuka, his second daughter was seriously ill and he had taken her for a change of scene to Almorah via Hazaribagh and Giridi, and he felt restless and anxious, he never became too perturbed by worldly disturbances. Bangadarshan ran on schedule. But his mind was filled up with publishing his Kabya Granthas.
Sishu was prepared at this time with the help of Mohit Chandra Sen.  After reading the volume, Sen's wife, Shusila Devi, asked Rabindranath to explain why Khoka was so ubiquitous and there was no Khuki. Shusila Devi had two daughters and no son.
Rabindranath replied that at that time the sweet memory of  his wife and his son inspired him to write the poems.     

Rabindranath had imagined that he would establish his family in Santiniketan. But Man proposes and God disposes. Rabindranath's wife, Mrinalini, fell seriously ill there in 1902. She was brought to Calcutta when Rabindranth's mind was pre-occupied with thoughts of his school at Shantiniketan and with recent Indian politics. The Governor Lord Curzon, after the death of the Queen Victoria, convened a meeting at Delhi. Rabindranath wrote an essay, Atyukti ( Exaggeration). The essay was a reply to the lecture delivered by Curzon in the convocation of Calcutta University where he mentioned that exaggeration was a peculiarity of the East. In such a situation, Rabindranath had to stay far away from his school. He had to prepare a constitution for the School which  had been converted to an University, Viswabharati University. meanwhile, Mrinalini was gradually getting worse. She brought her second son-in-law from America because he had to complete 'Phool Sajya'  (second marriage) after Renuka attained her womanhood and she wanted to see the occasion with her own eyes.
Mrinalini died on 23 December 1902, just after 11 months of the inauguration of Santiniketan. At the time of her death, Mrinalini was 30 years old and Rabindranath was 41. His eldest son Rathindra was 14, preparing for  his Entrance Examination, and Mira, the youngest daughter,  was 10 years old, the youngest son, Shamindra was 8.
Rabindranath wrote many poems as a  commemorative piece after the death of his wife, which he called  'Smaran'. He also wrote 'Utsarga' where he expressed his deep agony. In his life he had to overcome many sorrows but nothing could obstruct his creative activity. Rani, his second daughter, was suffering for some time. At first it appeared as an infection of the throat. But after some time it was diagonised as TB. Rabindranath, after the death of his wife, brought his children again at Santiniketan. But Rani (Renuka)gradualy got worse. The physician advised her to have a change of climate. Rabindranath took her to Hazaribagh. But it was a very difficult route at that time. One had to go to Hazaribagh via Giridi in a palanquin known as push-push. Once many days ago he had been there as a tourist. This time he was going with his daughter with heavy heart.

Rabindranath and his daughter, Renuka, stayed for some time in Hazaribagh. He began to write 'Noukadubi' for Bangadarshan, serialised from April 1903. Renuka's health, however, did not improve. It was decided that they would go to Almorah.
It was difficult to go to Almorah from Hazaribagh via Giridi with an ailing daughter. On reaching there, he wrote to Priyanath Sen that he was sailing amidst thunder and cloud, uncertain how to drop anchor. Amongst his children each one was moving in a different direction; his school was moving in another and he was going with his ancient disease in a separate direction. He was restless.
Before going to Almorah he kept Mira and Shamindra, the youngest daughter and the youngest son with Gnanadanandini, wife of Satyendranath. Rathi remained at the boarding in Shantiniketan and Bela was at her in-laws' home.
Despite the sorrow and the suffering Rabindranath's mind remained active. In 1896, he published his first Kabyagrantha, Kadi O Komal. He wanted to republish them organised in order to the subject matter and in the chronology of evolution of thought. Mohit Chandra Sen had taken the responsibility for publishing the books from Majumdar Library. In Almorah, about to publish the Shishu kabyagrantha he found the collection incomplete. He wrote another 30 poems to complete the volume.
More than three months they stayed in Almorah but no sign of improvement was visible. Renuka then insisted on returning to Calcutta. She might have understood that her days were numbered. Within a few days after coming back to Calcutta, Renuka expired and it was within three months that his wife and his second daughter died.


#### Summary
Rabindranath's formal education was brief. He had changed schools four times (Oriental Seminary, Normal School, Bengal Academy, St. Xavier's School) in eight years (1868-1876). Then he tried to study law in UK for about two years (1878-1880) and came back home without obtaining any degree. He again attempted to go to England but after reaching Madras he changed his mind. To become a graduate one has to undergo 10+2+2=14 years of study. But he had undergone only 10 years of study and did not secure any formal diploma.

During this time, however, he did not spoil any single moment. He followed  strictly a daily time table from morning till night and was tutored at home by his brothers (Hemendranath and Dwijendranath) and by his father, Devendranath during journey to Dalhousie and 20 private tutors on different subjects including wrestling, swimming, trekking. He was so equipped during this time that he could translate Kumarsambhaba from Sanskrit to Bengali  and Macbeth from English to Bengali, both in verse. He had filled up a Blue Book obtained from the office of the Tagore family with own written verses at the age of eight and started his life in literary work both as a  writer and a performer and established himself as a poet, a singer, a playwriter, a musician.

#### 1884
The year 1884 was a remarkable year in Tagore family.  The family lost three important members. Rabindranath's creativity was in full spate. In "Rabindra Jiban Katha" Prabhat Kumar Mukhopadhyaya said that, sometimes, the mind of Rabindranath became peculiarly detached from the earthly feelings. He himself said that "forgetfulness is one of the motive force of livelihood".  He wrote in a poetry,
"Hetha hote jao puratan,
Hethay Natun Khela Arambha hoyeche".
Many times he welcomed the new, bidding good bye to the old. In reply to a question from someone, he said - if I did not forget, how would I set a new tune to a different song? All the songs would appear with the same tune as in 'Ramprasadi'.
In this year, he started Kadi O Komal (Sharps and Flats). Asutosh Choudhuri, with whom Rabindranath tried to go to England for the second time but changed his mind, came back to India after becoming a  barristor with knowledge of French. Ashu could discern resemblances between many of the poems of Kadi O Komal and old French poems he knew. According to him the common element in all these poems was the attraction which the play of world life had for the poet and this had found varied expression in each and every one of them. The unfulfilled desire to  enter into this larger life was the fundamental motive throughout. "I would arrange and publish these poems for you", said Ashu, and accordingly that task was entrusted to him. The poem beginning  This World is sweet was the one he considered to be the keynote of the whole series and so he placed it at the begining of the volume.
Rabindranath wrote Nalini, the first prose drama and 8 Brahma Sangeet for Magh Utsab. It was decided that the lyrical drama 'Bibaha Utsab" written by Rabindranath will be staged at the wedding of Hiranmayee, the eldest daughter of Swarna Kumari. Jyotirindranath, Akshoy Choudhury and Rabindranath would take part in the play. Out of 45 songs of the drama 28 were constructed by Rabindranath of which 18 songs were constructed recently.
He read an eassay, "Akalkushmanda", written by him, at Sabitri Library.
Poems 'Dukha diyecho, kshati nei', 'Chaliachi grihapane, kheladhula abasan'   were written in Kadi O Komal.
Rabindranath had a journey by steamer and wrote 'Sarojini Prayan' .
He became the Secretary of Adi Brahma Samaj in Sept 1884 and continued in the post for many years. Some essays and some parodies were also written by Rabindranath which was published in "Sanjibani".

There were eassays of Rabindranath in the magazine Nabajiban edited by Akshoy chandra Sarkar and in the magazine "Prachar" edited by Rakhalchandra Bandyopadhyaya..


At the beginning of the year, on 19 January, Rabindranath read out an essay on Rammohan Roy at City College Hall on Mirzapur Street. In his lecture he described the utility of  discussing the life of a great man like Rammohan Roy. Most people remember Raja Ram Mohan Roy as the   man who fought to abolish Sati (the practice of a wife immolating herself on her husband's funeral pyre) and also founded the Brahmo Samaj. But his contribution was a great deal more than that. Born in Radhanagar, a village in Hooghly District, on 22 May 1772 in a conservative Bengali Brahmin family, he had his elementary education in a village school and studied from the age 12 in a Muslim seminary in Patna where he mastered Persian and Arabic. His knowledge of Arabic enabled him to read the Koran in the original, as well as the works of Sufi saints. He also devoured Arabic translations of the works of Aristotle and Plato.When he was 16, Roy clashed with his orthodox father on the issue of idol worship and laft home. For the next three years he travelled through north India and Tibet to learn about Buddhism. He then visited Varanasi where he learnt Sanskrit and and studied ancient Hindu scriptures. In 1803, he secured a job with with the East India Company and in 1809 he was posted to Rangpur . There he learnt about Jainism and studied the Jain texts. He was drawn to certain aspects of Christianity. The knowledge of different religion helped him to compare these with Vedantic philosophy. He resigned from East India Company and came to Calcutta in 1815. Along with a group of like-minded people, he founded the Atmiya Sabha in 1815. He proved that the practice of Sati did not confer "moksha" (salvation) for the husband as each man was responsible for his own destiny. His relentless effort in the form petitions and writings ultimately led William Bentick to pass an order of banning the practice of Sati. He alsdo published a newspaper in Persian called Miratul-Akbar and a Begali weekly "Sambad Kumudi". Founding of Brahmo Samaj was one of the most important contribution of Ram Mohan Roy. He was close friend of Dwarakanath Tagore and the Tagore family.      
  

   
#### 1885 Age 24


After being  the Secretary of Adi Brahmo Samaj, Rabindranath wrote 32 Brahmo Sangeet in four months before the ceremony of Magh Utsab. At his initiative a Reading Room was opened at the Brahmo Samaj Building at Chitpore Road.   Rabindranath made many friends in the Brahmo Samaj: other than Akshoy Choudhury, Jyotirindranath, Probodh Chandra Ghosh he was associated with  Priya Nath Sen, Shrish Chandra Majumdar, Kaliprasanna Kabya Bisharad, Ashutosh Choudhury, Jogendranarayan Mitra etc.Jogendranarayan Mitra printed a collection of songs of Rabindranath (1292)-Rabichchaya- the title of which was given by him .He published jointly a book Padaratnabali with Shrish Chandra; Ashutosh Choudhury arranged the poems of Kadi O Komal for printing. Once rabindranath thought that he would print the padabali of Bidyapati, but on hearing that the project was going to be done by Kaliprasanna, he submitted his collected materials to Kaliprasanna Kabyabisharad. Ashutosh choudhury was a brilliant student. He was scholar both of Calcutta and Cambridge University and had a taste for literature.  He married Prativa Devi, daughter of Hemendranath. Rabindranath used to consult him about foreign literature. Priya Nath Sen with knowledge of foreign literature, was at that time very close to Rabindranath, who wrote about this time in his life, "Jiban achilo laghu pratham bayase" 

In April 1885 (Baishakh 1292), the monthly magazine Balaka, edited by Jnanadanandini (wife of Satyendranath), was being published regulraly. She was staying in Calcutta for her children's education. Thakurbari was full of boys and girls growning  up together, such as Sudhindranath, the fourth son of Dwijendranath, Balendranath, son of Birendranath, Hitendranath, son of Hemendranath and of the house no.5, Gaganendranath, Samarendranath, Abanindranath, the three brothers. Jnanadanandini knew Rabindranath was to be given the charge of managing the magazine Balaka, though she was at that time editing it. Rabindranath took the responsibility of writing many articles for the magazine. He wrote poetry, essay, letters, comics, a novel in the name of  Mukut, and a big novel Rajarshi within a year.   
Thakur Barir Balaka was first published in April 1885 (1292 Bangabde), edited by Jnanadanndini, with the support of Rabindranath. But it did not live long. After publishing only 11 issues it was amalgamated with 8 years old (29th July 1877) "Bharati", edited by Dwijendranath of which Swarnakumari was the then editor. For six years ( 1293-1299) the magazine was published in the name Bharati O Balaka. In 1300 Bangabda the magazine began to be published, as before, as Bharati. After amalgamation with Bharati Balaka lost its identity, but after 1300 Bangabda it vanished totally.
Parthajit Gangopadhyaya published a collection of these eleven issues, in 22 Shraban, 1415  with his own  introduction.

Parthajit Gangopadhyaya in his editorial introduction discussed in detail, since 1818, the publication of literature for children. He mentioned that Khagendra Mitra described 'Digdarshan' by John Clerk as the pioneering magazine for children. Then several magazines came into being. Starting  from Pashwabali  came Jnanoday, Bidyadarpan, Satyapradip etc.In 1866 Abodhbandhu and in 1878 Balaka Bandhu were published. Parthajit in his collection of the issues of Balakas also introduced the writers by their photograph and short bio-data. The total number of writers participating in Balaka was 28.



#### Paintings
Rabindranath learnt drawing in his childhood and was attracted to the sketches drawn by his elder brother Jyotirindranath.
In 1924, while writing Purabi  he started doodling on the pages of his manuscript. Thus, Rabindranath Tagore's famous world appearence as painter in France in 1930 was not sudden. Long before the Paris exhibition which catapaulted him to worldwide  fame, in 1926, Tagore had long discussions on his art with Romain Rolland. Himself a Nobel Laureate, Romain Rolland wrote in his book "Inde-Journal" on 3rd July, 1926, that  Tagore had been discussing on his application of colour in paintings. He likes very little red colour, the dominance of red colour in Italian village did not attract him. His love was for violet and blue, and for green. Tagore had discussions about art with another Nobel laureate, French Poet, St John Perse, over their several meetings in 1920s.

Rabindranath transformed his lack of formal training into an advantage and opened new horizons in the use of line and colour. He was prolific in his paintings and sketches as he was in his writing, producing over 2500 of these within a decade. Over 1500 of them are preserved in Viswa Bharati, Santiniketan. 



#### Poetry
Rabindranath started writing alphabets in 1866 at the age 5, he was admitted to school, first in Oriental Seminary and then to Normal Schhol in 1868 at the age of seven, and he started writing poetry in 1869 at the age of eight, just after  one year of attending Normal School. He was urged by his elder brother, Somendranath, to recite these poems to people in the mansion - including a  Brahmo Nationalist, a news paper editor and organizer of Hindu Mela. He became known as a poet in Normal School where he impressed his teachers of his ability in writing poetry.
He was born in an atmosphere where literary magazines were published, musical recitals were held, and theatre performed. He was influenced by his elder brothers like Dwijendranath, Satyendranath, Jyotirindranath, Hemendranath and others who were always engaged in literary and cultural activities.
In 1874, at th age of thirteen, his first  poem Abhilash (desire) was published under the alias, Bhanu Singha.

In the opinion of Rabindranath there should be freedom of reading even to the boys. He was not in favor of putting  any bar of age to readers. Might be that the juniors were not in a position to understand the difficult portion of the text. In boyhood days he used to read all the books, magazines, even those which he might  not understand. He tried to follow the meaning with his imagination.
There was a big library of old books and magazines in Thakur Bari,  kept under lock and key for safety. Rabindranath managed to get the key  and open the almirah. He was in the habit reading  books and magazines. He read BIBIDHA BHARATI SANGRAHA of Rajendra Lal Mitra, Novel of Krishnakumari, books of Science and Anthropology, a small paper ABODH BANDHU and Banga Darshan of Bankim Chandra. He was fond of reading classical books of Sarada Charan Mitra and Akshoy Sarker  and of Bidyapati written in Maithali language. He used to collect all the magazines of which Dwijendranath and Jyotirindranath were customers and read them. He also took notes of the difficult portions from those writings.
He gathered, by this time, a vast knowledge in Bengali, Sanskrit, and English by learning at home.
He got Akshoy Chandra Choudhury, a friend of Jyotirindranath, as his beloved guide for Bengali literature of Baishnabpadabali, Kabikankan, Ramprasad, Bharatchandra, Haruthakur, Rambasu, Nidhubabu, Sreedhar etc.   

(Help was taken from the essay written by Sushil Roy in Jiban Smriti). In 1874, he completed a long poem in the Maithili style pioneered by Vidyapati. Published pseudonymously, experts accepted them as the lost works of Bhanusingha, a newly discovered 17th century Vaisnava poet. It had already been said that Rabindranath had a keen interest in old Vaishnava poems which were being collected and published by Babu Akshay Sarker and Sarada Mitter. The language, largely mixed with Maithili, was difficult to understand, but for that very reason Rabindranath took more pains to get at their meaning. His feeling towards the poems were as if they were ungerminated sprout within  the seed, or an undiscovered mystery under the dust covering of the earth. Buoyed with the hope of bringing to light some unknown poetical gems, he went deeper and deeper into the unexplored darkness of he treasure-house. Then he came upon the idea of writing in the same styile--  in such a wrapping of mystery.  As he heard from Akshoy Choudhury the story of the English  boy-poet Chatterton. Though he had no idea about the writings nor had Akshoy Babu given any details about the poet,  the unknown and untold story didn't lose its hidden charm. The melodramatic element in it which fired his imagination was sufficient.           
One noon in a cloudy weather lying prone on his bed in his inner room he wrote in maithili,   "Gahana kusuma kunja majhe"and became delighted to be able to write such a line. One day he mentioned to one of his friend: "A tattered old manuscript has been discovered while rummaging in the ADI BRAHMA SAMAJ library and from this he has coppied some poems by an old Vaishnava poet named Bhanu Singha". The friend was excited and  said that  " these could not have been written even by Vidyapati or Chandidas" . Then Rabindranath showed him his manuscript and said these could not have been written by Vidyapati or Chandidas because he himself had written these.When these poems in the name of Bhanu Singha was gradually coming out in Bharati, Dr. Nishikanta Chatterjee was in Germany. He wrote a Thesis on the lyric of our country comparing with that of Europe. Bhanu Singha was given a place of honour as one of the old poets such as no  modern writer could have aspired to. This was the thesis on which Nishikanta got his Ph.D.
It was at that time a matter of discussion  amongst the elites about this Bhanu Singha and his period of existence. In the opinion of Panchkari Babu, Bhanu Singh might have been born before 451 BC, Nitai Charan Babu said he was born some times in between 1104 AD to 1799 AD, Kalachand De said thatBhanu Singha was born either before 819 BC or after 1639. Ultimately Rabindranath pointed out the mistakes of every one that Bhanu Singh was born in 1861 because he himself took the name of Bhanu Singha.

Rabindranath was a poet . He mentioned, "I say again and again that I am a poet, that I am not a fighter by nature."  No doubt that he was first of all a poet and he wrote more than thousand poems, more than fifty Kabya Granthas and constructed more than two thousands songs of which he wrote both the words and the music. But he contributed over thousand essays on literary, social, religious, political, and on other topics. he also contributed in all the branches of literary activities and wrote innumerable letters to his relatives, known and unkown friends. A detailed work of Rabindranath had been tabulated in the margin.     

#### bAlaka

'Balaka' accomodated different subjects so that it could get different types of readers. The departments were : Novel, Poetry, Story, Essay, and biography, Drama, Music, Editorial, Letters to the Editor and others.
On scrutiny  it was found that during 11 months of publication of the monthly magazine Balaka, 120 articles were published of which Rabindranath, himself, wrote 45 articles, other members of Tagore family wrote 36 articles and known important persons wrote 39 articles. Hence Rabindranath wrote more than 1/3 of the essays published in the magazine.
Only one novel, Rajarshi, published in the magazine was written by Rabindranath. He wtrote stories, drama, poetry etc.    

#### shishu
Rabindranath wrote a bundle of poems for 'Sishu', a Kabyagrantha that is popular even today. He wrote another set of poems for 'Sishu' in the 1903 when he was in Almorah. Both the set of poems were edited and published by Mohit Chandra Sen in that year. This was the first instance when the voice of children got an expression, appealing to children in its taste, colour and rhyme. He transformed the story 'Mukut', suitable for staging by children and gave 'Rajarshi' the form of drama in the name 'Bisarjan'. Simultaneously, he maintained his quota for 'Bharati' and wrote 'Pushpanjali' which he dedicated to 'Bauthan' in her sad memory. Also wrote a satire 'Rasikatar Phalaphal' for Bharati. Then he went to Hazaribagh accompanying Indira Devi and Surendranath (children of Satyendranath). Here he wrote 'Chotonagpur' and 'Misc. Essays'.
Indira Devi wrote an essay describing her journey with Rabikaka. She didn't forget to mention that amongst the large family and its members, Jyotikaka and Rabikaka were very close to them. The relation with Rabikaka became intimate when he came to England to stay in their house.This time Rabikaka took her to Hazribagh Convent. It was at a distance from the station. One had to go there with the help of a 'Push Push' car, some sort of a big palanquin. To move in the night through this forest was dangarous due to bears and tigers. After reaching Hazaribagh they took rest in a 'Dakbanglo'. She could remember that there was a picture of Rabikaka lying on an easychair in that place in 'Balaka' published some days ago. The picture, drawn by an artist, bore some resmblance to Rabindranath.


#### Brahmo samAj

The  year 1884 is  remarkable in the history of Tagore family. Firstly, due to the death of Keshab Chandra Sen, Brahmo Samaj faced an organisational setback. To cope with the situation and to reorganize the Brahmo Samaj, Debendranath selected Rabindranath as its Secretary and Dwijendranath as the editor of "Tattwabodhini Patrika".
In the meantime, many learned persons were attracted to Ramkrishna Paramhangsa's devotion to God. Shashadhar Tarkachuramoni and other Pandits, at that time,  began to explain some of the tenets and practices of Hinduism with the help of scientific postulates to half-learned people. Two monthly magazines, Nabajiban and Prachar, came to light  to explain the greatness of Hinduism in place of Brahmoism. Bankim Chandra, Chandranath Basu etc were amongst the contributors.
Rabindranath criticized severely some of the essays in these magazines and he had some heated exchanges in with Bankimchandra, who ultimtely took a cordial view of their differences on the ground that Rabindrababu was talented, learned and an influential person, who deserved affection and importance, specially as he was young.  He considered Rabindranath's arguments to be exaggerated but was, nevertheless, eager to hear his views.
Rabindranath too wrote in his "Jibansmriti" that his mis-understanding with Bankimchandra was cleared by a the latter's letter (which is lost) in which he forgave Rabindranath completely.  The acrimonious past was erased.        

#### shAntiniketan school
By 1893 Rabindranath turned his attention to Santiniktan school after withdrawing his attention from Swadeshi movement. Later on Rabindranath founded the Shantiniketan School in his father's Ashram at Shantiniketan with 5 students, one of the student being his own son Rathindranath,on 22nd Dec  1901.At first it was started with his meagre funds and no tuition fees were collected. It was located within  two miles from the Bolpur Railway station on the East India Railway line.  The school had the advantage of being situated in the heart of nature but not too far from the city. The girl's school was added in the year 1908. But it did not survive for more than a year owing to a tragic suicide of a girl student.It was started again in 1922, as a separate wing for girl.
About the foundation of School at Santiniketan, Prasanata Kumar Paul, author of Rabindra Jibani, gave the following information.
A book written by Dr. Zacharias titled Renascent India published in London in the year 1933 wrote that Brahmabandhab and his disciple Animananda started a school in Kolkata to teach the upper class Hindus about the old ideas and traditions of ancient India in 1901. A few months later Rabindranath joined  them and subsequently requested them to shift the school to Santiniketan which in due course converted to Viswabharati University. Dr. Zacharias further stated that Brahmananda and Animananda had to quit the Ashram as the poet had strong influence on the students.
On learning this Ramananda Chattopadhyay, editor of Pravasi and The Modern Review, after interviewing Rabindranath  expressed his opinion about the incident.This was published in Pravasi in Shravan issue of 1340 in the column "Bibidha Prasanga". The controversy was explained by Amiya chakraborty,the personal Secretay of Rabindranath in the following lines, 
" Rabindranath said , in short, to inform that after the establishment of Ashram in Santiniketan Rabindranath met Brahmabandhab Upadhyay in Calcutta, who was reviewing   successfully and efficiently some poetry of 'Naibedya' and other writings of Rabindranath. At this Rabindranath was pleased and was attracted to him. When they met each other Brahmabandhab expressed his willingness to join the Ashram with one of his friend, Animananda since he had past experience of serving in such a institution because they were  conversant to the ideals and purpose of Ashram. Rabindranath invited both of them to join. Rabindranath was not acquianted with Animananda. So long as they were in Santiniketan their service were beneficial to the Ashram."


Rabindranath wrote a letter to the youth leader Pramathalal Sen (1866-1930) who was the elder son of Nabin Chandra, the elder brother of Keshab Chandra Sen. Under the influence of Keshab Chandra Sen, Pramathalal became religious-minded like his elder brother Nandalal, Bhabani Charan Bandyopadhyay (Brahmabandhab), Sadhu Hirananda etc. and became a member of Eagle's Nest.  Binayendranath Sen and Mohit chandra Sen were  energetic members of Nababidhan Samaj. Pramathalal and Pratap Chandra Majumdar along with them formed an organisation named Prayer Meeting Band. He was the first recepients of the scholarship (1895), namely Manchester,  introduced by   British Unitarian Association. The source by which Rabindranath was introduced with Pramathalal was unknown but he had communication with the three persons, Pramathalal, Binayendranath, and Mohit Chandra. Mohit Chandra was a distant brother of Nagendranath Gupta. Benimadhab Das wrote that Pratap Chandra was a great personality and Rabindranath was also attracted to him and the poet used to  come to his house - the "Peace Cottage".  He remembered with pleasure the afternoon when some of the Prayer Meeting Band were gathered round Rishi Pratap Chandra, listening with rapt attention to his slow mellow voice pouring out his deep spiritual thoughts in poetic language, all his own. Suddenly there was a gentle stir,- "Ah! Rabi Babu is coming.Rabi Babu is here."  A tie sprang up between the Poet and Prayer Meeting Trio, which gradually grew stronger with time.
On the occasion of 11th Annual ceremony of Paus Parban (7th Paush, 1901) and after the morning prayer in Santiniketan, Brahmacharyashram was inaugurated.Brahmabandhab, Rebachand etc were present as teachers and students coming from Calcutta and other respected guests were present. A car was hired on 4th Paush to bring Satyaprasad, Dinendranath, Singer Biharilal Chattopadhyay  etc. The Magistrate of Birbhum district was also present. Prasanta Kr. Paul mentioned in his book that Rs.3060.50 was spent on the occasion which he discovered from the cash book of the Tagore family.  Rabindranath himself initiated the students by reciting a sanskrit sloka, 'Shreyan byasohsani swaha' (let me be glorious rather than becoming a rich man) and explained the glory of the ancient monk's virtues.

The five students present on the occasion were renamed as Satyabrata, Abhoybrata, Punyabrata, Mangalbrata and Brahmabrata. They had to pray to god at least once in a day and recite the Gayatri mantra given to them.
in the evening prayer Rabindranath, Chintamani Chattopadhyay, and Shambhunath Gadgadi took the seat on the dias. Rabindranath gave them advice after the prayer.
Who were the first students is not very clear. Rathindranath, the elder son of Rabindranath, was one amongst them. He was 13 years old. He wrote that it was a problem for his father to collect students at that time. He asked Brahmabandhab to assist him in this respect. Brahmabandhab sent four boys from families he knew. Rathindranath remembered that two among them were the sons of a renowned businesss family of Nan. The autographer of Rabindranath gave the list of students as follows;

1. Gaur Govinda Gupta (became professor of philosophy in Rangpur College),
2. Asok Kumar Gupta (son of the same family),
3. Yogananda Mitra (a cousin of Ambikacharan Mitra, prof. of Philosophy)
4. Sudhir Chandra Nan,
5. Girin Bhattacharya,
6. Rajendranath De,
7. Premkumar Gupta,
8. Rathindranath Thakur,
9. Shamindranath Thakur, and
10. Santosh Chandra Majumdar.
Amongst the teachers there were Reba Chand, Shibdhan Bidyarnab, Jagadananda Roy, and Shasi Bhushan Roychoudhury.

Philosopher Brajendranath Seal (1864-1938) was also became close with Rabindranath. Rabindranath wrote to Pramathalal that he was busy writing critical essays on Kumarsamvab and Shakuntala  to discuss about literature and society  in the context of Indian Idealism. He did not have any time for writing on education in Bangadarshan. Perhaps that would be done in the next issue. In fact, he was not in favour of discussion regarding his school. He imagined only a limited number of students. They would work there as far as practicable. 
It could be mentioned here that The Unity and Minister, the mouth peace of  Nababidhan Samaj, in its issue of 13 Oct 1901, wrote an essay about the Brahmacharyasharm, titled Pilgrimage to Shantiniketan of Bolpur', the following lines ,
The latest addition is a Brahmavidyalaya or a school for imparting secular and religious education to students in the national style. A boarding house will be opened and there shall be accomodation for 12 students who would learn Sanskrit and Brahmacharya according to the Vedic idea. English, Mathematics, History, upto the Entarnce Course, will also be taught.
It was not clear who wrote this but the person came to Shantiniketan before writing this.

Uma Dasgupta in her book, 'Rabindranath Tagore-my life in my words', gave a brief description of the natural environment of the school at Shantiniketan.
"The Ashram is situated on a vast open country, bare up to the line of the horizon except for sparesely growing stunted date palms and prickly shrubs strugging with anti-hills. Below the level of the field, there extend numberless mounds and tiny hillocks of red gravel and pebbles of all shapes and colours, intersected by  narrow channels of rain water.Not far away towards the south near the village can be seen through the intervals of a row palm trees the gleeming surface of steel-blue water, collected in a hollow of the ground. A road used by the village people for their marketing  in the town goes meandering through the lonely fields, with its red dust staring in the sun. Travellers coming up this road can see from a distance on the summit of the undulating ground the spire of a temple and the top of a building,, indicating the Shantiniketan ashram, among its amlaki groves and its avenue of stately sal trees.
Rabindranath wanted to run his school in the model of the ancient hermitages with no luxuries, the rich and the poor being alike, will live like ascetics. But he did not find any right teachers."
He had to sell all the copyrights of his books, and everything he had in order to carry on with the school.
As per the instruction of Brahma Bandhab Upadhyay Brahmacharjashram was formed. Rabindranath delivered his first lecture in the New Year in the sacred place. But Brahmabandhab and Rebachand discontinued from the Ashram and Monaranjan Bandyopadhyay was appointed as Headmaster.  Tuition fees were collected from the month of July 1902.  Until then there had been no tuition fee.
A Japanese student came to learn Sanskrit.

Rabindranath was searching for some dedicated teachers for his School at Shantiniketan. He came across two such persons-- Brahmabandhab and Rebachand (full name was Gnanchand Makhijani who took the name of Animananda).
Brahmabandhab was starting a Math along with Rebachand and another student. But because of  the opposition of the authorities of the Catholic Mission the Math could not function. Brahmabandhab lived in a rented house at Beadon Street, Calcutta. Within a short distance was Bethune Row, where he had established his office to run his weekly magazine Sophia. Rebachand was a born teacher. In Sophia, Brahmabandha wrote an essay, namely, "The world Poet of Bengal", where he acknowledged the poetry of Rabindtanath, and thus Rabindranath came to know him.
Rabindranath was thinking of opening a residential school at Santiniketan for some time. Three years earlier Balendranath had constructed a building for opening a 'Brahma Vidyalaya'  there. Now the residential school was established at this place. Viswabharati Library had its office in the building for a long time. Three rooms and an attached verandah were its earlier shape.
Maharshi Debendranath established in Shantiniketan a temple and an Ashram. But at that time there were no activity there. The school was opened formally on 7th Paush with only 5 students. Rabindranath appointed Brahmabandhab Upadhyaya as an organiser. He was contemporary to Rabindranath. His original name was Bhabani Charan Bandyopadyay. He was the son of Kalicharan Bandyopadhyay's brother. Kalicharan was a follower of Jesus Christ .
Rabindranath wrote in Bangadarshan that he gradually grew close to Brahmabandhab who came to understand that Rabindranath ran the school with his father's consent.
Brahmabandhab joined the school along with some of his disciples. Brahmabandhab began to address Rabindranath as "Gurudev" and the name stuck. In such an address, there was much respect but not unmixed with fear. Brahmabandhab was looked upon as a close relative, but he could never influence the Thakur family.
The residential school  was oriented as a "Brahmaacharyashram" by Brahmabandhab. Rabindranath always tried to explain, in his written letters and essays, the importance of the methods of teaching in the preceptor's house in ancient India. But it was not possible for him to stay in Shantiniketan regularly and conduct the school.  That was done by Brahmabandhab. He stayed there for four months. It was impossible for him also to stay in a fixed place for a long time because he was a patriot who was called by the people of his country.
Brahmabandhab could not take classes regularly. He frequently came from Calcutta and advised Rabindranath about the rules and regulations to be introduced in the school. Rabindranath remembered later that during the formation of the school, Brahmabandhab was with him. Brahmabandhab and he discussed many things while walking through the lanes of the villages. He had tremendous strength in his body and once he defeated a Punjabi wrestler.  In the book 'Ashramer roop o bikash' Rabindranath spoke at length of his association with Brahmabandhab.

Brahmabandhab Upadhyay (born Bhabanicharan Bandyopadhtay, 1861-1907) was a complicated, rebellious, and seemingly contradictory man in a turbulent period of colonial  history of Bengal. Inspired from an early life with a patriotic zeal for freeing his motherland from the British, at the age seventeen i.e. in the seventees of the ninetieth century, he decided  not to complete his education or to marry but to devote himself to the struggle for independence as a celibate journalist. In time, as a young adult, he became increasingly attracted to the Brahmo teachings of Keshab Chandra Sen.
But gradually he developed a love for Jesus, which led to his conversion to Roman Catholicism in the mid 1890s. Taking the saffron robes of a Hindu renouncer, going barefoot and wearing a cross, he changed his last name from Bandyopadhyay (venerated teacher) to the simpler Upadhyay (teacher).
Influenced by Swami Vivekananda he retraced his steps back to Hinduism. In 1902, he gave a series of lectures in Europe.  He left Shantiniketan within 4/5 months. 
A young graduate, Monaranjan Bhattacharya, became the Headmaster of Santiniketan after the summer vacation. At first the school was free but when Rabindranath observed that his countrymen did not come forward with financial help on the basis of idealism, he began collecting fees from the boarders since July 1902. The vision of an Ashram free of cost ended in no time.   

A Japanese Budhist monk named Okakura came to Surendranath when Rabindranath was with him at his Ballygunge home. Horisan, a Japanese student of 25 years, came with him to India to learn Sanskrit. He too was a Budhist priest. After travelling through different places like Bodhgaya and Banaras he came to Belur Math to learn sanskrit. But as he was not keeping well there, Surendranath, on 10 June 1902, sent him to Santiniketan. Rabindranath was happy to receive a foreign student in Santiniketan. He wanted to make Santiniketan a global institution and this was the first step. Rabindranath wrote to Jagadish Chandra on 20 June giving him the good news:
'A Japanese student was admitted in my School at Santiniketan' . He wanted to get the whole world in his nest and this was the beginning and he added, 'The boy is good. He has become close to us. Your friend Mira made him her fan by supplying a cup of flowers everyday and learning a Japanese word every day from him.'
The letter written to Brajendra Kishore by Rabindranath was a bit longer. He wrote, 'A Japanese student got admitted here. His name was Hori but he gave his name as Chidananda. He was very polite and calm. He was so attentive in his lesson that it surprised everybody because he came here from a long distance, leaving all his near and dear ones to live in a so lonely a place. The servants living here are also moved at his polite behavior. His main aim was to study Tripitak, the Budhist religious book,  in sanskrit. He would take much time in learning Sanskrit because he could not pronounce a single sanskrit word. He faltered every time. Once he became ill, but his eagerness to learn did not decrease.'
Rabindranath was also taking care of him. He wrote to Manoranjan Bandyopadhyay 'employ Rathi or someone to look after Hori. Hori might be busy during his Entrance Examination so some senior student should look after his food timely  etc'.
Jagadish chandra became acquianted with Hori after coming from London. He prepared a long programme  on how Hory should complete his study.


Rabindranath was of the opinion that Jagadananda Roy was not fit to look after the zamindari work at Shelaidah and  appointed him as a teacher in Shantiniketan. He was ready to devote his life to this work and had a deep sympathy for the students. He could not bear the sorrow of a student even when he was punished.  Rathindranath mentioned how he could explain difficult science topics in a simple manner in the form of a story. 

From Rathindranath one gets many important information about  Shantiniketan. He wrote about Rebachand that he was an honest person and could teach English well but was strict in his attitude. He insisted on rules and regulations very strictly. He was a very good cricket player. He wanted to introduce the rules of cricket games in all affairs though Rabindranath did not like it.
The life of Brahmacharyashram without any amenities was very hard. The building proposed by Balendranath and constructed later on was the only accomodations for teachers, students and for holding classes. That one-storied building was divided into three portions. One portion was meant for teacher's residence, the second portion  was for the class-rooms and the third portion was kept as a students' hostel.
Early in the morning at fifteen minutes past five,  students had to get up from their bed and complete their ablutions. Since there was no sanitory toilet they had to go to the 'Bhubandanga Dam' to answer nature's call which was popularly known as "Math kara". Even today this business is termed as 'Math kara'. They used to finish their morning bath in the Bhubandanga Dam. At that time there was classifiaction of dress among the students of different castes. For Brahmins, the colour of the dress was white, for Baidya or Kayastha, it was red and for lower castes, it was yellow. They had to put on a long apron over their normal dress. After  a few days, the sartorial distinction of castes was removed and everybody used deep orange (gerua) coloured aprons. Rathindranath wrote that this system was advantageous to them as they could use dirty or torn clothes under their aprons. Wearing their dress, they took their seat under the trees. Each one had to sit under a separate tree for their prayers. They had to utter sacred text in sanskrit. Then they used to take their breakfast with Haluya made up from suji. Half an hour was alloted for exercise when they dug earth  before the mass-prayer at which when both students and teachers would participate. Then they started their classes.    
At 10 a.m., after the study hour, there was time for play as you like, singing with the harmonium or for reading. At half past 11, a vegetarian lunch was served. Only the Brahmin boys used to sit in a separate line. At half past 12, the  study hour resumed and continued upto half past four with a 15 minutes break at 3 p.m.
Then came the games hour. Rathindranath wrote that as football was less costly, it was loved by all and played by all. Once the Maharaja of Nator gifted enough playing materials to the boys but everyone wanted to play football. At half past 6, the evening prayer started. At 9 p.m., after dinner, everybody went to sleep. At half past 6 in the evening, Rabindranath used to meet the boys when he remained in Shantiniketan. This was the daily routine of the boys of Shantiniketan where Rathindranath amongst others was being brought up.     

The school at Shantiniketan was established on 22 December 1901 (7th Paus 1308) with five students and five teachers. Among the teachers there were Brahmabandhab, Rebachand (Brahmachari Animananda), Jagadananda Roy, Sibdhan Bidyarnab, and Laurence.
Brahmabandhab didn't take classes regularly. He frequently went to Calcutta and while he stayed at Shantiniketan he simply adviced Rabindranath on how to enforce discipline in the School. Within 4/5 months, Brahmabandhab resigned and a graduate teacher, Monaranjan Bhattacharya, joined as Headmaster. Rabindranath wrote to Pravat Kumar Mukhopadhyay that within  few days the number of students rose to 12 and for this increase of students extra teachers and increased accomodation became necessary. A boarding house was constructed for the accomodation of students.
As per promise, Rabindranath explained, in an essay, "the early period of Brahmacharyashram" which was published in Aswin issue of 1343 of Prabasi as 'Ashramer Rup O Bikash'. In that essay Rabindranath wrote in a footnote that someone complained to Maharshi Debendranath about the conversion of Brahmabandhab and Rebachand to Christianity. But that was not true. Rabindranath wrote, "I know that one of my relative have done this. But my father replied that he was not afraid because he had founded ' Shantam Shibam Adwaitam' there."   
Of course this foot note did not reveal the reason for the resignation of Upadhyaya and Rebachand from Shantiniketan. The explanation submitted by Kartik Chandra Nan in this repect was more acceptable.
That Maharshi Debendranath and Adibrahmo Samaj were not pleased with the Christians was not a secret. It was quite natural for them to become displeased with the Catholic Brahmbandhab and Rebachand. Prof. Gaur Gobinda Gupta, lecturer for the first batch of students of Shantiniketan, referred to an incident which was very important. "Prof. Mohit Chandra Sen, on an inspection tour to the Shantiniketan, offerred a pictorial Bible to the students of Shantiniketan as a prize. The book,  filled up with bold type of English letters and coloured pictures, was dear to Prof. Gaur Gobinda Babu. On learning this Rebachand was  pleased and explained the meaning of the pictures to Gaur Gobinda. At this, some teachers of the school became curious about the intention of Rebachand. When Brahmabandhab came to learn the whole story, he called back Rebachand and he himself cut off all connections with the School.
It may be mentioned here that Rabindranath was secular and this was known to everybody. The decision taken by Brahmabandhab was due to some other reason. It can be noted here that Sibdhan Bidyarnab, the sanskrit teacher of the School, also left the school within a few days.        

Due to some political reason Radhakishore, Maharaja of Tripura, could not get his second son admitted into the school at Shantiniketan but he helped the school financiaally. Rabindranath replied, in a letter, that he had received with thanks the sum of Rs. 50/- and said that he could feel the love and passion he (Radhakishore) had sent along with this small amount. The love and affection which he had bestowed upon him would stored in the deepest corner of his heart. This he remembered not as a gift from one of the king but from a close friend.


TAGORE’S IMMORTAL TIES WITH TRIPURA

Bikach Choudhury

Though lulled to a sequestered life in the backyard of an ancient tribal kingdom, Tripura goes down in the pages of history as a little place almost religiously devoted to fine experiments in arts, crafts and literature. The rulers of this ancient State were not merely patrons of art and culture but a number of them were great exponents in different creative fields. Even the reputed journals of the West mention eloquently their work of art, photography, literature and music. Tripura’s modern era began with Maharaja Birchandra (1862-96) who was a superb painter, an excellent photographer, a great composer of music, a profound scholar of Vaishnav literature and obviously a great connoisseur of all creative activities.

This sagacious ruler created a stir in the literary world by conferring upon young Rabindranath Tagore the honour of the ‘best poet" in 1882. The poet was hardly 21 years old then and he had to his credit only one book of verses - Bhagna Hriday - (The Broken Heart). Birchandra, having read ‘Bhagna Hriday’, was so moved that he immediately sent his minister all the way from Agartala to Jorasanko, home of the Tagores at Calcutta just to convey the message that he discerned in the young poet the promise of a great future. Tagore was taken by surprise.

Tagore very respectfully mentioned the great event in his autobiography Jiban Smriti and paid great tributes to Birchandra on a number of occasions during his sojourns to Tripura.

This was the beginning of an unforgettable tie between the ruling house of an obscure land and a great poet who dominated the literary world. This historic bond lasted for over sixty years till the last days of Tagore. He became the friend, philosopher and guide to the four generations of Tripura rulers.

The elderly Birchandra was quick enough to befriend the young poet. Tagore went to Kurseong twice during 1894 and 1896. On both the occasions he invited Tagore to be his guest of honour and the poet gladly obliged. Those were meetings between two great minds that provided a rare opportunity to both of them to know each other more intimately. Tagore was then hardly thirty-three years old and Birchandra almost double his age. Naturally, the young poet felt shy to open up himself. But in all literary discussions he was treated as an equal. Tagore often recalled the sweet memories of those golden days that he spent together with Birchandra (pic-2) at Kurseong.

Birchandra was quite pained at the ruthless criticism that Tagore’s literary works drew from the critics of that time. He wanted to buy a printing press and invest one lakh rupees, a princely sum in those days, so that decorated editions of Tagore’s works could be published without any hitch from any quarters. But as ill luck would have it, while returning from Kurseong, Birchandra died in Calcutta in 1896. Tagore was naturally very upset. He thought his ties with the Tripura royal family would abruptly come to an end. But it was not be.

There waited more surprises for Rabindranath from this land of eternal love. Birchandra’s worthy son, Radhakishore, lost no time in extending even warmer invitation to Tagore to take his seat of affection in Tripura left void by the death of his illustrious father. Radhakishore ascended the throne in 1897 and died in 1909. During these twelve years, Tagore visited Tripura as many as five times. On innumerable occasions, Radhakishore sought Tagore’s help in rescuing himself from very complicated problems of statecraft which he faced. Tagore’s advice was sought in all matters right from the appointment of ministers, drafting of state budget, framing of code of conduct for the officers of the royal court and general approach towards dealing with erring officials. Leaving aside literature, Tagore lavishly showered his hitherto unknown skills in all these prosaic areas of statecraft. The erstwhile Tripura royal family still preserves the rare historic documents written in Tagore’s own handwriting where he has shown his remarkable ingenuity in matters of public finance, state policy, principle of education and other such matters. Radhakishore virtually became dependent on Tagore in all the areas of day-to-day administration. This naturally irked the officials of the royal court. But Tagore, even at the cost of burning his fingers, did not leave his trusted friend at large.

This short-association of Tagore with Radhakishore(pic-1) had lasting impact on Tripura’s ties with greater Bengal. The benevolent Maharaja contributed liberally in various literary, cultural and scientific endeavors of Bengal. Tagore once approached Radhakishore for financial grant for the scientific research work of Acharya Jagadish Chandra Bose who was in dire financial state at that time in England. Radhakishore himself was in a very tight financial condition as the palace at Agartala had been struck by a severe earthquake and was to be re-built. besides, the marriage of prince Birendrakishore was on hand. But the ever-generous Radhakishore did not fail to rise to the occasion. He wrote to Tagore that he was prepared to deprive his would-be daughter-in-law from a piece or two of jewelleries for he was sure that in return of that Jagadish Babu would decorate mother India in a much befitting manner. He kept his promise and granted a huge sum of rupees fifty thousand in those days with the only stipulation that his name should not be made public.

Radhakishore also sanctioned an annual grant of Rupees One thousand for Tagore’s Viswa Bharati which was continued for nearly fifty years till the death of the last ruler, Maharaja Bir Bikram Kishore.

Radhakishore’s son, Birendra Kishore, also inherited the rare artistic acumen of his grandfather, Birchandra. He was a great painter and a musician, too. Like his forefathers, he extended liberal financial grants to Viswa Bharati. It was during his time that Tripura’s relationship with Tagore acquired a cultural dimension. In 1939, Birchandra’s great-grandson - Maharaj Bir Bikram Kishore, visited Shantiniketan.He deputed Rajkumar Buddhimanta Singh from Tripura as a Manipuri dance teacher at Shantiniketan. Buddhimanta was followed by a number of other talented experts in Manipuri dance from Tripura. They made remarkable contributions in providing the floral foundation of effusive softness, style and grace to Rabindra Nritya.

Following the footsteps of his ancestors, Tripura’s last ruler, Maharaja Bir Bikram Kishore, always paid the highest respect to Gurudeb Rabindranath Tagore. It was his privilege to confer on Tagore the honorific title "Bharat Bhaskar" just three months before the death of the great poet. Tagore’s 80th birth anniversary was celebrated at the royal Durbar of Tripura with all solemnity. An emissary was sent to Shantiniketan to formally confer on Tagore this last tribute of Tripura. The ailing poet was so moved by this generous royal gesture that he made no secret of his feelings,"Such a free and disinterested bond of friendship between an immature poet whose fame was yet uncertain and one enjoying royal distinction is unprecedented in the history of any literature. The distinction that this royal family has conferred on me has illumined today the last limits of my life’s span".

During his last visit to Agartala in 1926, while addressing a public meeting Tagore had another occasion to pay his tributes to Tripura. In response to the genuine love showered on him by the Kishore Sahitya Samaj of Agartala, Tagore in his inimitable words said, "Gone too are those days, I had the good fortune to receive great honour; it has been my privilege to receive honour even at the hand of kings in the West. But the tribute I received from a prince of my own country is to me, personally speaking, of much greater value. That is why my relation with this State of Tripura is not just that of a guest for a day. That relation is indeed wedded to the memories of the father and the grandfather of the present king".


The school at Shantiniketan was not performing well. This was known from an undated letter written by Rabindranath to Basanta Kumar Gupta. He wrote that he had talks with his father about the school. He was anxious about the guests who wanted stay at Shantiniketan because the school was occupying most of the space on the ground floor and upstairs and Debendranath did not like it. It was decided that very soon more teachers would be coming. Dwipendranath (eldest son of Dwijendranath) would join them soon and he might be annoyed to see the scarcity of accomodation. Dwipendranath was one of the member of the board of trustees of Shantiniketan. But as per convention none in the Tagore family could stay for long with his family in Shantiniketan, which Rabindranath did. There was some unpleasantness with Dwipendranath, which he mentioned in a letter. At first there were indirect references, but after some time he expressed it directly.
For this reason Rabinfranath had to purchase land outside the boundary of the trust's jurisdiction.  


Rathindranath would sit for Matriculation examination that year. His test examination was coming very close. Rabindranath's mind was full of different thoughts. He was thinking about Rathi's test examination. In the puja vacation a few teachers went home but did not return after the vacation, he was worried about that. Some new teachers were appointed and they had to be initiated properly in work, he was concerned about that. He remained absent in the school for a long while and could not conduct the school, and that was another source of worry.
Rabindranath Singh was arranging for puja of mother Kali. He wanted Rathi and Prem(ananda) to come to see the puja. But Rabindranath did not want Rathi to waste any more time away from his study. Rabindranath was concerned about Subodh Chandra Majumdar not turning up after the puja vacation. This time he was advised to take care of the teaching of geography. He hoped that Rathi's lessons were going alright. Narendranath Bhattacharya was teaching geometry but there was no one to guide him in Algebra and Arithmetic. Rabindranath said that he was not sure when he would be able to go to Bolpur. Dr. Kali Prasanna Lahiri was asking for leave. But in his absence, this was not possible.
Jagadananda Roy was suffering from intermittent fever. Subodh was held up by his daughter's illness. With all these concerns, he was not in favour of closing the school during Puja. The sanskrit teacher after many requests went home to fetch his relatives.

Rabindranath wanted that his son might be a successful one. Before the death of Mrinalini, one day he  wrote her from Shelidah to take care about the study of Rathindranath. Mrinalini Devi had some unhappiness in her mind for she could not feed Rathi in her own hand during vacation. This was known to Rabindranath. For that he mentioned at the end of his letter that he wanted to inspire Rathi in his ideals. He wanted to prepare Rathi for higher living. So he should practice self-restraint, follow strict rules and regulations and observe austerities and penances. If he could follow the path to attain his goal with strong determination without any exception, he would be able to become a man of success.
" From our very childhood we were busy to fulfill our own desire. We had given much more importance to triffling matters. As a result we looked upon our self interest keeping aside great ideas, absolute truth, humanity, and even eternal love and auspiciousness."   
Rathindranath and Santosh Kumar Majumdar were the students of the school at Shantiniketan reading in Class X (Entrance Exainaion). But the school was not affiliated to the Calcutta University upto the standard of Entrance Examination. For that they had to sit for the examination as a private student. Their test examination for sitting in the entrance exam. would be held separately in District level to be organised by the authorities. As because Jagadananda Roy was having his residential place in Krishnanagar, Rabindranath wanted that they should sit for the test exam. in Krishnanagar. Rabindranath wrote to Manoranjan Bandopadhyay at the end of the month "Kartick' that the arrangment for them for  sitting in the exam. might be done aat Krishnanagar.
Accordingly Manoranjan, Jagadananda, Rathindranath and Santosh Chandra, all of  student class X, along with an attendant came to Calcutta on 9th January, 1902 and went to Krishnanagar to sit for test exam.
At  this Rabindranath wrote to Manoranjan that he was satisfied to learn that they had a good healthy accomodation there in Krishnanagar and Jagadananda Roy might be able to arrange for their fooding.
rathindranath deposited his fees of Rs. 10/- as his fee for Entrance exam. on 19 January  which Rabindranath intimated to Manoranjan Bandopadhyay.     
In Tagore family, even in the case of a servant of salary of Rs. 3 only 'no work, no pay' was the system in vogue. The sentiment of Rabindranath towards Jagadananda, a teacher of Shantiniketan, regarding payment of salary was no exception.
Subodh Chandra along with Shamindranath came to Shantiniketan. From a letter written, after few days, it was revealed that the management of Shantiniketan rested on the shoulders of Manoranjan Babu, Subodh Chandra and Jagadananda Roy it seemed that, by that time, Jagadananda had joined the Shantiniketan.
In the mean time Kunjalal Ghosh, the son-in-law of Shibnath Shastri,expressed his desire to work in Shantiniketan, being attracted with the ideals of Shatiniketan. Rabindranath appointed him as the working secretary of the school. Rabindranath wrote about him to Manoranjan Babu in a letter that Kunja Babu would go to Bolpore very soon. He expressed his expectation about him that many help might be available from him.
He might aso help in delivering lectures.He had come forward in this job by himself so it was expected that he would work sincerely. The informations received about him from many sources said that he was good. Rabindranath had given him in writing  the details of  aims and objectives and programmes of the school.He asked every body to read that and do accordingly.
Rabindranath had given the responsibilty of conducting the school to three persons, 1. Manoranjan Bandyopadhyay, 2. Jagadananda Roy, and 3.Subodh Chandra. Manoranjan Babu had been nominated to act as Chairman of this Teachers' Council. Kunja Babu was inducted to act as working Secretary to this council. He would show the accounts of income and expenditure to the others for approval and pass that by them. He would work according to your directions. Rabindranath had written in the details the rules and regulations of the school and gave it to him and asked them to go through it. They should not hesitate to communicate any change of the rules to be ammended by them.
On 13th November, 1902, Rabindranath handed over a twenty page detail rules and regulations to Kujalal from Jorasanko. During the formation of plan for Brahmavidyalay Balendranath prepared a draft rules and regulations. But after the foundation of Brahmacharyashram Rabindranth himself took the responsibility of conducting the school and there was no necessity of forming separately  'rules a regulations' for the Ashram. Moreover he was not in favour following any hard rules and regulations for the Ashram.  As because of his family mishaps he had to remain absent off and on for long and short periods and felt a written rules and regulations for the Ashram. This might be termed as the First constitution of Shantiniketan Brahmacharyashram. It included a preamble also explaining the aims and objectives of the Ashram. This is to be noted that he had done this just before 11 days earier of his wife's death.   

After the death of his wife Rabindranath wrote a letter to Priya Nath Sen. He described a sloka of Mahabharata which he described at least  six times while writing a letter. This sloka he always tried to remember in time of any disaster. He got himself prepared to face all sorts of sorrows and sufferings of the world. He also wrote to Brajendrakishore Devmanikya that God had given him the woe and he would surely do something better through this sufferings. He expressed similar feeling to Mohit chandra Sen also and said that God would not misuse his bereavment. He would promote him from one class to the next higher class.
He wanted to do something to remember the death of his wife by doing a better deed. He asked Hirendranath Dutta to help one student in his study by a financial support of Rs 180 a year. He did not feel ashamed of asking this amount of money for a boy of his school.
He wrote similar letter to many of his friend but the result was unknown. Because once he sent a boy to one of his friend asking him in a letter to return the previous one if that did not have any effect. This is to be noted that the recipient kept both the letters.     

Rabindranath got rid of his anxiety on the part of his wife after her death but his anxiety over the school at Shantiniketan did not reduce. He formed a 'Teachers' Council' with Manoranjan Bandyopadhyay as President and Kunja Lal Ghosh as a working secretary for smooth running of the school. The problem came from a different direction. Rabindranath wanted  that the inspiration should be developed from inside but the teachers gave importance towards outside. Rabindranath's instruction was that the students would bow down to the teachers everyday. The problems arose from castecism.It was not known whether the students protested against this instruction. But Manoranjan Babu wrote a letter to Rabindranath asking him that whether it would  be justified for a brahmin student to bow down before a non-Brahmin like Kunja Lal Ghosh.Rabindranath was careful about appointing a non-brahmin cook considering the mentality of the brahmin student but he could not think that it might be difficult for a brahmin student to bow down before the non-brahmin teachers. It became difficult for Rabindranath to accomodate his ideas in this case still he answered Manoranjan Babu saying that the hesitation developed in his mind was not unjust. we should not accept any custom which was not approved by Hindu Society. We should follow the advice, on this point, given in the 'Sanghita' which said that the students would bow down before the Brahmin teachers and would sh ow respect by folded hands to the non-brahmin teachers. It would have been better if Kunja babu be relieved of the duties of a teacher. It would be better if he would keep himself in the management fooding and lodging instead of being a teacher of the School. Further, Rabindranath put a question in himself whether a non-brahmin student could bowdown before a non-brahmin teacher.He also wrote , in this letter, the news of their arrival in the Shantiniketan.          




#### Okakura
On 16th April 1902, Rabindranath wrote to Jagadish Chandra Bose that Nivedita had introduced him to a Japanese scholar, Okakura Kakuzo.  He had thus gained a friend. He came of a renowned family, namely Samurai. From his very child he had deep interest in art and culture.As a member of Imperial Art Commission of Japan, he visited Europe and America in 1886. He was made Pricipal in New Art School in Tokyo when he came back from his tour. Due to some presure to follow the European style in that school, he resigned and founded a new Institution, 'Hall of Fine Arts' (Bijitsu-in) in 1897, with some of his students. He had enormous influence as a member of the Head of Imperial Archeological Commission. Okakura met Miss Maclaud, one of the follower of Swami Vevekananda, who published the famous book of Okakura, namely Ideals of the East. The main subject of this book was to expand the influence of India in describing Eastern Culture to the whole world.
Many important persons of Japan were eager to bring Swami Vivekananda, a Hindu Monk,  to Japan since he fostered the prestige of Asia in Europe and America. As a token conveyance fare he sent Rs. 300 for bringing Swamiji to Japan in June 1901. But it was not possible for him to go due tohis broken health and the immediate responsibilities of the Math.  Along with the young devotee, Harisun and Miss Maclaud, Okakura after a long tour of different places came to see Swami Vivekananda at Belur Math on 6 January 1902. Okakura was introduced to Nivedita some time in March 1902.
Mrs. Oli Bul arranged a party at American Consulate in honour of Okakura. In this party, at the initiative of Nivedita, Surendranath Thakur got acquianted with Okakura and became his follower. After a long time, in August 1936, Surendranath described this incident in journal, The Viswabharati Quarterly. But due to political reason he suppressed many facts there. As a result, the story of Rabindranath and Okakura remained unpublished. This incident was unearthed by Abanindranath subsequently.
Rabindranath invited Okakura to Shantiniketan and he also accepted the invitation. The friendship between Rabindranath and Okakura was deep and lasting. At the request of Srish Chandra Majumdar, Rabindranath acquisitioned a piece of land in Bodhgaya for Okakura and met him in Boston, USA, in 1913.  He stayed in Okakura's house when he went to Japan. Rabindranath offered flowers to the memory of Okakura in Japan..        



### bAlendranAth
Balendranath (1870-1899) was the only son of  Birendranath, the 4th son  of Maharshi Debendranath Tagore. He was one of the favourite nephews of Rabindranath Tagore who dedicated to him the book 'Nadi'. He  took active part in the national movement  in the role of marketing goods prepared locally. He began writing in Balaka from a very tender age. He wrote many articles in Bharati O Balaka, Bharati, Sadhana, Pradip etc. The variation in the choice of essays was unique. He wrote many essays on Indian paintings.  Even at that time, it was not in vogue as a medium of expression. Amongst his works were : Chitra O Kabya, Madhabika O Shrabani.The first one was a collection of essays and the second one was collection of poems. These were published in1907. Ramendra Sundar Tribedi wrote its introduction. He died at a very young age from an attack of  TB. Rabindranath commpleted his unfinished writing and published in the magazine 'Pradip' under the title 'Balendranather Asamapta Rachana.'      

### Rathindranath ( 1910 - 1961)
1910

Mrinalini had not yet been transferred to Calcutta from Shantiniketan for better treatment. Rathindranath wrotethat his fatherwas at calcutta. His father informed Dwipendranath,  elder brother of Rathindranath and son of Dwijendranath, to fetch Mrinalini to Calcutta. it was a remarkable incident to Rathindranath to bring his mother from Bolpur to Calcutta. His mother lying on the bed and Rathindranath  sitting by her side was watching through the window and gave a vivid description of the scenery outside the window as if Rabindranath had drawn a picture. Rows of innumerable  palm trees on both sides of the lane with frequent bushes of wild date trees. There were also stray villages covered by bushes of bamboo trees. Suddenly appeared a child sitting bravely on a buffalo. All these sceneries appearing before the eyes and leaving one after another. Once an open field was visible of which there was  a  pond with middle portion  broken. The amount of water inside the pond was covered with white lotus. The scenery was so beautiful that Rathi asked his mother to look at.
Oneday Rathindranath described about the games played in Shantiniketan. The cost of playing football was less than the expenses of the other games. There were no arrangements  of other games.Every body was fond of playing football. One day Natore's Maharaja came to Shantiniketan and gifted many playing materials. but still they liked to play football.
Rabindranath was an efficient actor and a director too. Rathindranath wrote that in 1902, they staged "Bisarjan". At that time they had no stage, no dresses nor any other equipments. We had mae up of all such drawbacks by only our will. The no. of students were also small. There were only Santosh Majumdar, nayanmohan Chattopadhyay ( second son of Manimohan son in law of Dwijendranath) and  himself. These three persons were the organisors, sponsorer and actors. The entrance examination was knocking at the door but the Reharshal was going on. Being afrid our teachers complained to Rabindranath . But Rabindranath did not listened to their complain.  
Rathindranath wrote in his autobiography that 'H-CH-H' (Harish Chandra Halder) had drawn the 'Scene'
of the dramma 'Bisarjan'.
There was no hall for staging dramma. In the dinning hall, at the back  side of the school building, the stage had been prepared with the help of some wooden platform. Some platforms were placed vertically on its legs for hanging the 'scene' with the help of nails. Rathindranath said that they had done all these childish affairs but still the performnce was good. Nayan played well in the role of Nakshatra Manikya, the role of Raghupati was played by Jagadananda Babu. At this Rabindranath understood that he was one amongst a lakh and from then he became an essential actor for every dramma when staged. Though there was no mention in the 'Smriti Katha' written by Jagadananda Roy. Rathindranath said that Nayan's acting was splendid. His mamannerism in the soliloquy was perfect of its kind.After few days it was again staged on 1903. 



After completing his B.S. in Agriculture Rathindranath returned to India having some educational tour in Europe at the request of his father in Sept. 1909. In the mean time his field for constructing a farm wirh a laboratory had been made ready by Rabindranath at Silaidah. Rabindranath also decided to hand over some charges of zamindary estate to his son Rathindranath. Rathindranath became satisfied with his future prospect. Rabindranath had moved to different places of his zamindary with Rathindranath to  introduce him with the tenants. Moreover, this was the first time when he became close to his father in the same house boat. Rabindranath, having faced several untimely death of his loved ones ( Mrinlini, Renuka and Shamindranath) specially Shamindranath, embraced his son, Rathindranath, with all the love and passion he had.

While visiting for his Zamindari work Rabindranath preferred to use a Bajra (big boat) but in the opinion of his son Rathindranath, having returned from America after obtaining his degree, Bajra was a slow vehicle and was not suitable for going by water. Rabindranath purchased a steamer with Rs. 7900/- from Fortilla Company for him. Rabindranath wrote about this steamer to Rathindranath in some of his letters earlier. Previously Jyotirindranath lost all his wealth in competition with this company namely " The Bengal Central Fortilla Co. Ltd." This was the beginning of Rathindranath's exorbitant cost of living in contrast with Rabindranath's simple living. Rabindranath was not satisfied with his son's way of living but due to his affection towards his son he could not point it out to him. After few years the steamer had to be sold out for Rs.3000/- only on 8 May, 1917, undergoing heavy loss.
Sujit Kumar Chakraborty, brother of Arabindo Mohan and Ajit Kumar, passed B.Sc. from Presidency College. Rabindranath paid Sujit Kumar Rs.35/- pm regularly in the absence of Ajit Kumar. Now Rathindranath, being in charge of the estate, was instructed by Rabindranath to pay the amount from Ashwin within 3rd day of every month.
Rathindranath got his education in Agricultural Science from America and Rabindranath selected Silaidah as his place of work. Rathindranath wrote ;
"My life has been started afresh in Silaidah -it is supposed that I am just a wealthy farmer in Europe or in America. A vast land was made ready for the purpose of farming. The seeds of corn and seeds of different grass for the animals were imported from America. Different kinds of instruments for farming, suitable for our country was prepared. Even a small laboratory was constructed for testing the soil,
"Rabindranath stayed here as a guest of his son and daughter -in-law. He came here with illness and wrote Ajit Kumar, " My lever was not functioning properly which I did not feel earlier- for this reason, I have come here. Now I'm feeling better. The problem of my lever is no more." A small room was
constructed on the roof of the estate-building (Kuthi-Bari). That was his shelter. The rain is over and Beneath the sky there is wide field of crops and the stream of water of Padma is flowing . His mind became completely filled with sense of leisure in the slow-idle going village life. Explaining his state of mind he wrote a letter to Ajit Kumar.In  every evening they had discussions on different issues - some times of his past educational life, some times of his present programme of action, sometimes with the miserable conditions of the peasants, sometimes of Rabindranath's plan and programme of development of villages. Sometimes they had some discussions on literature also. Rathindranath started a new life in Silaidah as if he was an well to do agriculturist in Europe or in America . He had to establish his farm on a vast land at Silaidah. Seeds of corn, food for domestic animal and seeds of different kinds grass  was imported from America. Different kinds of ploughs and plough shares which was suitable for applying  in this country. Even a small laboratory was prepared for examining the soil of the land. By this time Myron Phelps had come from America who was sympathetic to the cause of India.Different essays written by him were published in local papers. He had certified in his writings about the farm at Silaidah as a good attempt to organise a farm like America. When Rathinranath was busy with his present work he was called for his marriage which was fixed on 27th January, 1910, after five months of his arrival in India. This was the first time in their family of an widow marriage. After his marriage a few years had passed very smoothly and peacefully. He was doing his work in the farm at Silaidah and in the laboratory and Pratima was going  on with her study at Jorasanko with the help of  a lady teacher Miss Burdaten  coming from Illionos. But this easy going life within the simple living peasants in the villages had ended suddenly.
As it became very difficult for Rabindranath to take all the responsibilities of Santiniketan,  he called Rathindranath to share some of his responsibilities. His classmate Santosh Kumar Majumdar after coming from America had already joined Santiniketan. His brother-in-law (husband of Mira), Nagendranath, also, would come back from America after finishing his study and would join. Rabindranath sent them all to America for their study in agriculture to help  in the developmental work of  Santiniketan and the country.
Rathindranath was happy in the natural environment of Silaidah but he had to take an additional responsibility of his father at Santiniketan.
His subject of study was agriculture and its scientific application. Now he had to think of handicraft and fine arts. After coming  from America he found that Jorasanko was busy with ceremonies of art and literature.  In America and Europe he attended many cultural  programmes  but the tastes of those were different from that of Jorasanko Here the ceremony was balanced, restrained and appreciating
Gaganendra and Abanindra were doing various types of experiments on art and culture. He went  to their house at 5 no. Jorasanko, everyday. and tried to follow. He organised  a club known as "Bichitra Club".
Here it might be mentioned that Rathindranath organised a Cosmopolitan Club at Illionos at Urbana. The logo of their Club had drawn by  Nanda lal Bose.
After organising Bichitra Club he had to come to Santiniketan at the call of his father. Before  that he tried for a business which as usual in Tagore family could not see any success. He purchased a car for  his conveyance and went with it in different places inside and outside Bengal by self driving. This was the only benefit he got from his business.
Rabindranath’s second child Rathindranath Tagore (2nd from left), who was his eldest son, was born on 27 November 1888. Rathindranath was married on 27 January 1910 to Pratima Debi (2nd from right). Pratima Debi was born in the year 1893. At the time of their marriage, Rathindranath was 21 years 2 months of age and Pratima Debi was about 17 years .
Pratima Debi was Gaganendranath and Abanindranath Tagore’s niece. (Her mother Binayini Debi was their sister). Before her marriage to Rathindranath, Pratima Debi had been married to Nilanath Mukhopadhyay but, was widowed later. Rathindranath and Pratima Debi’s marriage was the first instance of a widow marriage in the Tagore family
First rice taking ceremony of Pratima was held on 30th Jan, 2010 and Rabindranath handed over the charge of his family to her with a sum of Rupees 50/- as the balance of family expenses on 2nd Feb, 2010, just after 3 days she came to her father-in-law's house. Rabindranath wrote to his son-in-law, Nagendranath,
" Hope you have got the news of my daughter-in-law. Everybody likes her very much. It is Santi who is charmed and Dhiren (both are brothers of Nagendra) too is so. They are of opinion that this time her beauty surpassed that of Bela even. Not only in outward beauty, her behaviour is also sweet. Her face appears so calm that she looks gracious and everyone becomes attracted."
In that letter, written to Nagendra, he described the duties allotted to Rathindranath. After the completion of his course Nagendranath might join in the same field of work. Rabindranath described him in details the socio-economic perspective of contemporary India.
" Now,our main duty is to try to develop the economic condition of the downtrodden people of our society.If you want to be a co-worker of Rathi then there are ample scope. You can cultivate land in co-operation with the farmers, can open Banks, to build healthy dwelling place for them, to pay up their debt, to arrange for the education of their kids, to provide means of livelihood for their old age, to construct roads and dams, to remove scarcity of drinking water, to fasten each other with bondage on the basis of co-operation, and so many similar works.If we became successful to form an ideal village of this type, then the whole country will get an example to do likewise. I did not find persons to do this type of basic work. Everyone wants excitement. There are very few persons for real work, for real sacrifice."
In the month April (Baishakh, 1319),1912, Rathindranath purchased a bunglow with garden in Ramgarh, near Nainital with Rs. 10,000/- only  where Rabindranath had gone for rest with Pratima Devi, Mira, Nagendra and two servants.
Rabindranth decided to go to foreign for the third time on Friday, 24 May 1912.
"The Bengalee" paper published, in Saturday, 25 May (12 Jaistha) issue, the detail description of the farewell of Rabindranath;
" Babu Rabindranath Tagore accompanied by his son Babu Rathindranath left Calcutta on Friday by B.N.Railway Bombay Mail for Europe.he will first visit France and Germany and stay for some time in England, whence he will go to America and return after making a prolong tour through China, Japan Siam. Members of the Tagore family, his friend and devotee, his Bolpur students and ex-students, with many of the teaching staff saw him off at the station.
Rathindranath along with his wife accompanied Rabindranath to Europe and America in May, 1912. They stayed in England and then went to America and came back.
Manchestor Guardian during day time published the news of the departure of Rabindranath Tagore on 3rd Sept,1913.
Rabindranath reached Bombay station on 27th Sept when he had answer several questions put by the reporters. His answers were published in The Bombay Chronicle and Morning Post, Observer of London.
He boarded the ship when he went to London from the same port and came back to his own land after one year 4 months.
In London and in America Rathindranath tried to increase his academic attainment but circumstances did not permit him to do so.﻿
Rathindranath established his family in the Kuthibari of Surul, the newly purchased garden house.On 25th Aug  Rabindranath became a guest in their house. Rabindranath came everyday to Santiniketan with the help of a Cow-Cart through the earthen road. Dinendranath stayed in the house known as Benukunja made of straw where every evening Sangeet Sandhya were arranged.


Rabindranath was staying with Rathi and Pratima  in Surul. But they would be going to the Bunglow of Pearson at Chandipur and Puri during Puja vacation and so Rabindranath had to go to Santiniketan.
A few years back Rabindranath had some trouble at the left of his countenance and at the neuralgia of his ear which had elapsed recently. He was facing this trouble off and on. He informed Rathindranath about his health. Previously he had his treatment and was relieved of his pain. But due to the side effects of the medicine he got some new problems in his nervous system. Rabindranath, himself, was also a good physician and practiced Homeopathy and so knew the cause and side-effects of a disease. Quoting from the Materia Medica he wrote Rathindranath his present state of depression of his mind. This was clearly expressed in his songs and poetries published in Gitali.   
He wrote poems in Gitali about his mental depression, his trouble out of it and way of attaining higher stage of mind. He wrote to Kshitimohan Sen at the crossing point of his recovery on 2nd Oct 1914;
" I'm passing through a stage of separation and union - after finishing my lyrics, I shall get a way out of it. Now I should keep mum"
But he again wrote to Andrews on 4th Oct;
" It seems as though I am coming out of the mist once more, and I am trying to throw off my shoulders the burden that has been oppressing me all these days. As my mind feels lighter, I have rightly earned my freedom./We have all come to Santiniketan from Surul; and this change has done me good. "
He again wrote on 7th Oct ;
" My period of darkness is over once again. It has been a time of very great trial to me, and I believe it absolutely necessary for my emancipation. I know that I am being lifted from the sphere
where I was before ; and it is the loneliness of the new situation and and the cry of the old life that is still troubling me. But I have glimpses of the ineffable light of joy, which I am sure will not fail me."
While Rabindranath was in London in 1912, he purchased the Kuthibari and garden house of Surul with a sum of Rs.8000.00 by a hand  note and started remodelling it very soon. In 26 Aug 1914 the payment of the same was completed. But before that on 14th April in Bengali new year day the ceremony of formal entry into the house took place.In front of Rabindranath Rathindranath and Pratima took their seat on the sacred stage and Kshitimohan Sen recited Vedic hymn. All the teachers and the students were present as guests but the ceremony was not finished due to rain.
Rabindranath had a dream  that Rathindranath would construct a laboratory here on agricultural science. Rathindranath and Pratima began to stay here but after some time both of them were attacked with Malaria. As a result they had to leave the idea of permanently staying there. After passing several years by doing this and that,  a centre for village culture, Sriniketan, had been developed here.
Rabindranath was a Nobel Laureate. But he was not in the habit of staying at a particular place and remained absorbed in his own writing. Rathindranath said that he was a born-traveller. When he was young he could not stay at home for long time. He moved from this place to that within the country. He also went twice in England for a short period.The first time he went to England before his (Rathindranath's) birth. Second time he went to England in 1890, when he was a mere child. Third time when he went to Europe and America, Rathindranath and his wife accompanied him. Rathindranath said, so far he could remember, Rabindranath had journey to foreign in 1912, 1920, 1924, 1926, 1930 and in all these times Rathindranath and Pratima accompanied him. In 1932, Rabindranath went to Iran and Mesopatemia by plane - Rathindranath could not accompany due his ailment and only Pratima accompanied him. Rabindranath went several times to different places of far-east and North and South America taking others as his accompaniment.When he went to Russia , Rathi and Pratima could not accompany.

Rathindranath was the youngest one in the Tagore family amongst all his cousin brothers and sisters . In a big-book known as "Paribarik Khata" was kept in his uncle's (Satyendranath) house for writing comments by the members of the Tagore family where  he was marked as a shy and introvert one by his cousin brothers and sisters. He was born in 1888 and remained in Jorasanko upto the age of 10 yrs and his preliminary education from a Nusrsery trained teacher and his wife.   He was then admitted in a school at Silaidah founded by his father. He got his education from his father and three other teachers there.. He took admission as a founder student, among 4 others, in Santiniketan Brahmmacharyasram in 1901 after studying 3 years in Silaidah.. He passed Matriculation examination in 1903 and was trained at home for 3 years to be admitted in Illionos University to study  BS in agricultural Science in 1906. He passed BS in agriculture in 1909, had an educational tour to different countries of Europe and had come back home in the same year at the call of his father. He had gone to Silaidah and Patisar to get himself acquainted  with the tenants of the estate. He started an agricultural  farm with a laboratory for soil taste in Patisar. In 1910 he was married to Pratima and then came to Santiniketan to take some responsibility of his father in the mangement of the Institution. He wanted to stay permanently in the Kuthibadi of Surul but was unable to stay there  as they were attacked with malaria and came back to Santiniketan. He permanently stayed in Santiniketan with his wife Pratima unless he was deputed for other responsible job.He got  4 genuine responsibilties; .1. to look after the Zamindary including to conduct village court founded by his father, 2. to look after his farm at patisar, 3.to look after the administration and development of Santiniketan, 4. to accompany his father in his foreign tour.

Rathindranath was not only one of the first five boys of the Santiniketan Brahmacharyasrama, he was also one of the key persons for the existence and development of Santiniketan. Rathindranath was one of the most representative product of Rabindranath's educational ideals. After his matriculation, Rathindranath was sent to Illinois to study Agricultural Science. He spent the next four decades of his life serving Santiniketan and Visva-Bharati.

At Santiniketan, he taught genetics to the students and he had been praised for making such a technical subject interesting to the students. Apart from teaching he worked mostly behind-the-scenes, organising, trying to find newer and better methods to implement ideas. At different times he had been the Karma-Sachiva  and  teacher. As a  Santiniketan-Sachiva, in charge of Sriniketan,  he served for about fifty years after his joining the Brahmacharyasram. He did a lot to promote it to Visva-Bharati University,  a Central University in 1953 and  became its first Upacharya.

Without his active patronage, the Tagore memorial and archives perhaps could never have come into existence. He made over his heir loom to Visva-Bharati and a part of his income to Rabindra Bharati.

Rabindranath reached Shantiniketan along with his children and son-in-law.(Satyendranath Bhattcharya, husband of Renuka)
When Mrinalini became bedridden, her Pisima (aunt  from father's side), Rajlakshmi, came to Calcutta to see her.  Rajlakshmi had strong affection for Mrinalini. One day Mrinalini told Rajlakshmi that she was bedridden so her children were in great difficulties. There was none to look after them. She asked that if she  (Rajlakshmi) took the responsibility of looking after them, she  would be tension free.Pisima kept her request. From that day she remained with them to look after the children of Mrinalini.
After the death of Mrinalini, Rajlakshmi  came to Shantiniketan with Rabindranath and began to manage the household affairs in there..From that time she became a member of Rabindranath's family.Mira and Shamindranath were then a mere child. 
Mira Devi while in Shantiniketan wrote from her memory about Mrinalini that she used to cook with a  cooking stove in the thin slice of verandah and aunt Rajlakshmi used to help her by making pieces of the vegetables.They used to gossip at that time also.
She could remember another story. A table lamp on the open balcony of the first floor of the building at Shantiniketan was glowing,  An English novel was in the hand of her mother, Mrinalini, who used to make her grand mother, Rajlakshmi, listen the transltaed version of the book in that light.
Rabindranath was not only busy in writing poems for 'Smaran' Kabya Granatha, he was also busy in managing the school affairs which was disturbed during his absence.Formerly he formed a Teachers' Council with Manoranjan Bandyopadhyay, Jagadananda Roy, and Subodh Chandra Majumdar and Kunjalal Ghosh who was made the working Secretary. Rabindranath also handed over a set of rules and regulations prepared by him handed over to them for smooth running  the school. He expected more sincerity from the teachers to implement his ideal but they kept themselves busy in making contradictions with some triffling matters. For shortage fund the students were charged with Rs. 15/- only for fooding and lodging but the parents did not show any liberal attitude which Rabindranath wrote to Akshoy Chandra Sarker in a letter as follows;
" I am sorry to learn that you have deducted the amount of tuition fees for which Achyut remained absent from the school. This is not even permitted with the rules and regulations of any school. Moreover, you know that this school is not money earning institution to me. I spent more than the school can collect as fees and donations.So I  must follow, strictly, the rules of the school once formulated. I inform you the following rules we are following and there is no exception. 
  Each student has to pay his tuition fee for every month within 10th of the respective month failing which a fine of 1 ana will be charged per day.. If within 15th of the next month the fee with fine was not paid, the name of the student will be struck off from the roles and will be sent back to his house. Fees for vacation is also to be paid."
Rabindranath had some experience in managing his zamindary estate but that did not help him in conducting the school. He abolished the Teachers Council and made Satyendranah, his son in law,  the principal of the school. He wrote letter informing his present decision to Manoranjan Bandyopadhyay requesting to inform every body to obey Satyendranath so that the school might run smoothly.
But that experiment also failed due to the mal-functioning on the part of Satyendranath who was not having any work culture and Rabindranath had to take other means.

Jagadish Chandra wrote to Rabindranath from London that he had sent a book namely John Chinaman and asked him to read the book.He also remarked, "we are painting ourselves with European dust keeping aside our gold." Goldsworthy Lowes Dickinson, professor of King's College of Cambridge and London School of Economics was a Rhodes Scholar. He while moving in China wrote this book and published it in the name of a   Chinese knowing English.
Rabinranath read this book without knowing the writer of the book and wrote a summary of the book thinking that he was Chinese.Before one year Rabindranath wrote two essays, Difference of Society and Mother land, which were published in Bangadarshan. In the essays he narrated the opressions done in China by the European Imperiolists. Moreover he became acquianted with the Japanese great man Kakujo Okakura who wrote the book "Asia is one". Rabindranath came to understand the heritage of the country and the relation between China and India. It should be mentioned here that Surendranath Thakur in an eassay East and West,  published in Bharati, expressed the similar ideas.
In 1912, when Rabindranath went to England he stayed for two days in the house of Dickinson and well acquianted with him.
In 1913 Dickinson visited Jorasanko and Shantiniketan.    ﻿

Jagadish Chandra was acquianted with Hori at Shantiniketan after coming back from England. He began to imagine a broad outline of programme with Hori as its center. He wrote to Rabindranath that they were searching such a person who knew Sanskrit and English at a time.He could be allowed to study in Asiatic Society for six months to studty Budhism along with other relavant manuscript.then Hori should be taken to the different places of Japan where such manuscripts were available. In this regard Hori was to convinced. The fiancial burden was to be born by them.Hori might be helpful in such a benevolent deed.
But all these thinking were fruitless asw Hori lef6 Shantiniketan within a few days. Rabindranath wrote to Manoranjan babu that they were then free rom presure of heavy work after Hori left the Shantiniketan.A sketch of Hori, drawn by Jyotirindranath, was kept at the Museum of The society of  Rabindranath. This picture was drawn at the house of Satyendranath, situated on the Ballygunge Store Road on 20 th. Feb.
A few months after, Hori died due to an accident.
Nivedita, on 15 dec 1903, wrote Miss Macloudk ;
'A Japanese turned up from Tokio, a Mr. Ito, and Hori went off with him to travel over India. On the Journey, he scratched his finger in a railway carriage some where in Punjab and the wound turned to lockjaw, and then, on the way from Lahore to Calcutta, he died.it was last week bet. 6th and 12 th  Dec.   

Manoranjan Bandyopadhyay came to Santiniketan, Brahmmacharyashram as a teacher to help Rathindranath in his preparation for Matriculation Examination. But he resigned from his duty as a teacher and left the school before the examination of Rathindranath started. Rabindranath wrote him on 25 Feb, 2003,
You have joined the Brahmavidyalaya as a Head Teacher since the openning of the school. You have resigned on the ground of your health and I could not stand in your way. I have no other way to express my gratitude to you for the trouble you have taken with your efficient teaching capacity to make ready for final examination of the two students of the school to sit for the Matriculation examination.
It was not expected that Rathindra and Santosh could appear in the examination this year and it was you who made Rathindra ready for examination within a year and made Santosh ready for examination in less than a year time. I had gathered faith in you for your sincerity and efficiency as a teacher for the quality you possess. If opportunity comes again I would ask you to join.
Dwijendranath, too, wrote in a letter to him,
It seemed that you had left the school just to keep yourselves aloof. I would not have allowed you to go if your health would permit you to stay here .
It was not only for his health that Manoranjan Babu left Santiniketan was known to Rabindranath because he (Manoranjan bab) wrote on 19th Sept, 1903, to Rabindranath that it was his (Rabindranath's) weakness and attitude that helped him to resign   This weakness was revealed when Rabindranath deputed Satyendranath Bhattacharya as the head of the institution and Kunjalal in charge of management of the school. Specially his contradiction with Kunjalal was much which was revealed from a letter written by Rabindranath on 2nd June, 1903,
'... Your mind was so agrieved with Kunja babu that I think needless to say anything about him to you. I would not even like to say that he had done wrong to you for it may add fire to the straw. I would not mention the reverse to add to your depression. The reason behind this contradiction was, probably, Rabindranath wanted to arrange accomodation of Kunja Babu with his family in the proposed laboratory room due to his want of fund to construct a separate accomodation for him.
Rabindranath had to face several resignation from teachers of Santiniketan for triffling matters, personality clashes, failure of being close to Rabindranath or to earn faith from him. Attraction for higher salary also was one of the factors of such resignation.
Even after submitting his resignation Rabindranath did not lose regards and gratitude for Manoranjan Babu and wished his success in his legal practice. He also offered him to take again the charge of the school. In return Manoranjan Babu too used to visit Santiniketan off and on and pass a few days there. Exchange of letters between Rabindranath and Manoranjan Babu lasted till his death.  

The entrance examination of Rathindranath started from 2 March and for that he came to Calcutta on 25th ,february,1903. Informing this Rabindranath wrote to Priya Nath Sen that Rathi had come to Clacutta.
Mohit Chandra Sen was a friend of Rabindranth who died at an early death. After his death ( 9 June, 1906) Rabindranath wrote an essay and published that in Bangadarshan enunciating, in detail, a story about him.
One day Rabindranath received a letter from him at Calcutta intimating that he wished to go to Santiniketan. he came to Santiniketan in the evening train. Before their dinner he came to Rabindranath and said hesitatingly ,
" I thought that I shall donate to Santiniketan the full amount I receive by examining the scripts of the Univerity examination this year. As it is not possible for me to work in this institution, i would get a satisfaction by donating some amount of money. "
After saying this he humbly put a note of rupee in the pocket of Rabindranath.Rabindranath opened the Rupee note and saw to his astonishment that the note was a Thousand Rupees note.
This amount of money appeared before Rabindranath as agift from god.A thousand rupee note was undoubtedly invaluable to him at that moment but he got himself revitalised at this and thought that  his duty had now became easy to fulfill.
 mohit chandra would receive Rs. 650/- by examining his paper and he had to add Rs. 350/- more to make it a thousand rupee.

This time Rabindranath got another gift for the school, poet Satsh Chandra Roy (1882-1904) who vertually sacrificed himself for the school. he was the son of Akhil Chandra Roy, the descendant of the dynasty of Chandradwip of the village Uzipur of Barishal district, at present in Bangladesh. He passed F.A. examination from Brajamohan College of Barishal district. and while studying in triple honours in Sanskrit, English, and Philosophy in General Assembly's Institution he was introduced with Rabindranath.
Rabindranath wrote that Ajit Kumar Chakraborty (1886-1918) introduced him with his friend Satish Chandra Roy. Earlier to this he gave a manuscript  of poetries written by Satish Chandra to him for reading.
Rabindranath gave her comments clearly in each page though that was not always in his favour. He would not express his opinion so critically if the case was of some other person.Having gone through his writings Rabindranath felt that the poetries written him in an younger age bore testimony of individual outlook. His power was uneqivocally superb and did not deserve superficial remarks. After being introduced with him Rabindranath was attracted to him for his quality of being absorbed whole heartedly in his creativity. His first published work was a trnslation of the poetry of 'love among the Ruins' by Browning in Bangadarshan . The title was 'Bhagnanagare Premsammilan'.His many translation of the poems of Browning were published in Bangadarshan.  

Rabindranth wrote,  "starting the school at Bolpur was an endeavour to take education in our own hands and make it as indiginous as possible". Describing his father's struggle, Rathindranath wrote , "very few realised the struggle with which father had to carry on his educational experiment in Santiniketan. When the school was established he had difficulty in getting pupils and those who came were mostly of difficult type. The people looked down upon the institution and ridiculed father's attempt to introduce new ideas in education... Considered from a worldly point of view it was foolhardy of father to have launched into this misadventure when he hardly had enough to support himself and his family and was actually in debt over the failure of the Kushtia business when he had to dispose of everything he possessed including the jewellery belonging to my mother.'
Rabindranath wrote that the determination of establishing a school at Santiniketan was resounding in his mind. During conversation he described the future of the bright picture in front of them.One day Satish came and wanted to offer himself before Rabindranath for Santiniketan. At first Rabindranath was not agreeable to appoint Satish because financial condition of Satish was not good. After passing B.A. examination he had to earn for his family. He was married in an early age following the old custom. But he wanted to join the Ashram before passing the B.A. examination so that he had not to bear the family burden. Rabindranath allowed him to join the Ashram just when Manorajan Bandyopadhyay left the school. Though Satish was not in favour of accepting salary, Rabindranath, secretly, used to send to his father a suitable amount as stiphend.
Brahmabandhab called Rabindranmath, the head of the Ashram, as Gurudev but it was Satish made the term popular and gave it a lively meaning. He wrote a letter to his friend, Ajitkumar, dated nil,
" the creativity of Rabindranath like that of nature. What beautiful scenery in this remote village through the rows of Saal trees I observe, I could perceive the heart felt essay of Rabindranath. Do you know why I called him Gurudev ? ....... I tried to call him this and that but the word Gurudev only suits him."
Rabindranath also felt Satish as god gifted. He wrote to Brajendra Kishore a long letter on 21 March, 2003,
" God is making my job  successful uncalled for.I become astonished to think that a person earns only Rs.150/- a month as a teacher, maintains his family in a rented house at Calcutta and comes to Bolpur to donate Rs.1000/-  to me. It is god who does His duty in the world through a negligible person just to publicise  His worth. From that day I began to work myself in the name of gad throwing the bag of begging. Formerly I became afraid how I shall meet up the expenditure but now i leave everything upon the almighty god. I have constructed another room for the students and appointed an Englishman to teach English. I'm constructing a big room like an workshop because one my friend expressed his willingness to donate one engine and other equipments . I don't know how i spend so much money. God will make good of my deficit."
He wrote to Dinesh Chandra Sen that he was worried as he was  not able to watch the method of teaching of the English tutor . He was sure that the teacher was not Lorence because he knew the method of their teaching.
He was the first European teacher appointed in Santiniketan.
