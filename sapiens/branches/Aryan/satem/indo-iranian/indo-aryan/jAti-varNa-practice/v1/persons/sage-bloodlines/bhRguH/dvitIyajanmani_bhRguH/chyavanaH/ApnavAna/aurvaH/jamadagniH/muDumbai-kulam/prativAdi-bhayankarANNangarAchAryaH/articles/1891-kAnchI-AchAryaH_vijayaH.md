The more recent PB Annangaracharya who lived in the previous century is the one who has written a lot against Vadakalai views. He descends from the same PB Annan. At some point of time in his later life, he performed Prapatti in secret from Abhinava Ranganatha Parakala Swamy (1884-1966).  He has published several texts in a Ramanuja Granthamala and a Vedanta Desikah Granthamala, the latter being on the guidance of the Parakala Jeer so presumably post-prapatti.
