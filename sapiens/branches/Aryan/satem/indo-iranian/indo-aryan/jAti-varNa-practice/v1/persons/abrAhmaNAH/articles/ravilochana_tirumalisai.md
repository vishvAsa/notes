Thirumalisai Alvar refers to Vishnu as Gunabharan. Now Gunabharan is a title of Mahendravarman Pallava. And Nagaswamy as well as other such people are very happy to point out that it is a title of Mahendravarman Pallava. So the Alvar must be a contemporary of Mahendravarman. That he was a contemporary of Simhavishnu and Mahendravarman is something which I am also ready to agree.
