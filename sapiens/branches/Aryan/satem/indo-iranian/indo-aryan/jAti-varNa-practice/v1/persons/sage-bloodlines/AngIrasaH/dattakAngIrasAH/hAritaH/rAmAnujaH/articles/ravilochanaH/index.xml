      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;यतरजवभवम&#34;&gt;यतिराजवैभवम्&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Among the hagiographical/biographical texts which may be considered as possibly written by someone who was a contemporary of Sri Ramanuja, only Yatiraja Vaibhavam by Andhra Purna seems to pass the test.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Divyasuri Caritam is a much later work - last chapter makes it clear. Venkatachala Itihasa Mala is also a later work. The appointment of Satakopa Jiyars in Tirumala is attributed to Sri Ramanuja in the work. But the Jiyars and mathams were established only in 14th century as is clear from inscriptions. VIM and DSC mentioned above have to be discarded as primary texts of evidence. Yatiraja Vaibhavam alone should be taken seriously by those interested in history.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
