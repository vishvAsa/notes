      <description>&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&#34;https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2005/09/28/things/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Over and over the downward turn of the yuga was burning us. We were reviewing the reports from the unfair battle with Shoi on the pAShaNDa hill. We noticed that there were two major points that came up:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;there was a signal known as “daiva” that inexplicably came up at a time when the troops thought all was hunky-dory. The shachiva was completely blind to this signal but the amAtya saw it and moved troops in panic.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;There was the signal known as “oShadhi-vanaspati” which we received at around the midday hour. We did not know whether to charge with out troops or to negotiate. We decided to negotiate to buy time hoping the amAtya would strike a blow with his division and the muni may arrive with his reinforcements in the mean time. Our negotiations were very successful on the mUlaka bridge and the bhutapati temple road. This gave us time to move our troops closer with the muni’s reinforcements. But the amAtya had panicked and we failed to complete the encircling move. We were just preparing for a thrust when Shoi saw the breach in the amAtya’s section and made a deadly thrust with the entire enemy decision. The amAtya was wounded in the encounter. The shachIva and amAtya sustained injuries when the turushkapura allies of Shoi made a surprise sally on their camps. Me and the muni escaped in time though. But the losses to the troops had greatly set us back.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But going back to the reports we are disappointed to see that we repeated the mistake when confronted by a similar trap. It is almost a Hindu aspect to commit the same military mistakes over and over again. Now with our troops reduced we were not clear as to what strategy to adopt.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Hayastanika, sAMkhya, Plato etc.</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&#34;https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2005/09/26/hayastanika-samkhya-plato-etc/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Hayastanika is known as sarvapriyA and mahAsurApipAnA. Thus, we mused&#xA;over the turn of the chakra known as the saMvatsara. The wheel turned&#xA;and sharadaH had come resulting in the dismal air that hangs over us. We&#xA;decided to stay away from lalAmI and enjoy the pleasant company of&#xA;Kappa, which was like a madhu-chaShaka in itself. We saw the movie&#xA;sukhAvati of Campbell and then began discussing a hero with a 1000&#xA;faces. Sparked by the images of Campbell’s movie we had an interesting&#xA;discourse on the further similarities between the fundamentals of Greek&#xA;thought and their Hindu counterparts. An important parallel is that doxa&#xA;and mAyA. This doxa is represented as a female deity, Ananke, just as&#xA;the Hindus represent mAyA by the great trans-functional goddess. Her&#xA;trans-functionality across the categories of the gods in the Hindu world&#xA;is a clear inheritence from the proto-Indo-European world. Nextly, in&#xA;the Greek world she creates Eros first amongst the gods and also causes&#xA;the “maithuna” of males and females. In the Hindu world this deity,&#xA;kAmeshvarI, regenerates kAma who can conquer rudra and drives the&#xA;maithuna of organisms. Thus, these deeper connections, which are at the&#xA;heart of the tantra, was existent in both the worlds. Plato and Socrates&#xA;drew their inspiration from Parmenides and Heraclitus. The later was an&#xA;equivalent of the Vedantic thinkers of the Hindu world. His book was&#xA;dedicated as an offering in the temple of the great goddess Artemis and&#xA;late in his life, Heraclitus renounced the world and lived as a mountain&#xA;hermit on wild grasses and plants. By synthesizing the ideas of&#xA;Heraclitus and Parmenides, the Socratic school under Plato proposed an&#xA;evolutionary model of the world where the primal “One” and the “Other”&#xA;spin out the world through a series of emanations. These primary&#xA;emanations are in the Greek fashion described as natural numbers- from 1&#xA;to 10 or their inner core 1-4 (1+2+3+4=10). This four called the&#xA;tetractys is believed to represent the following: 1= the point&#xA;transcending sense perception. 2= line, the emergence of subject and&#xA;object. 3= triangle, the first two dimensional entity. 3= tetrahedron&#xA;the first 3D entity representing space. Thus, the tetractys symbolizes&#xA;the emergence of the spatial physical world from an imperceivable unity&#xA;of the point. Plato declared that the pure unitive knowledge associated&#xA;with the point was the highest wisdom, whereas the higher emanations&#xA;associated with sense perception are lower knowledge or ignorance.&#xA;Theophrastus, clarifies that the one acting upon the “Other (also termed&#xA;the indefinite dyad by Pythagoras)” produce the conceptual “Ideas”. The&#xA;“Ideas” then acting upon the Other or the indefinite dyad produce the&#xA;“Particulars”. The parallels with sAMkhya and vedANta can hardly be&#xA;escaped. The puruSha and the prakrR^iti standing in for the One and the&#xA;Other (or Doxa of Parmenides).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The symmetric devolution of Jx</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&#34;https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2005/09/23/the-symmetric-devolution-of-jx/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The chance for the kuriltai was unusually solidified by the bold&#xA;Argentinian adventurer. At the said hour we met with Mn and the&#xA;shachiva’s prime agent. Mn, was a pioneer and even bolder adventurer&#xA;than the Argentinian and was as ever silent, but he was shaken the&#xA;strikes close to home. The shachiva’s agent who had maintained silence&#xA;all this while, suddenly gave in to revealing the secrets of Jx. We were&#xA;surprised the precision with which the shachiva’s agent described the&#xA;various issues surrounding the rAkShasi. I asked how could she know that&#xA;much, when the shachiva himself was generally poorly informed and living&#xA;in figments of his making. The agent then revealed the startling point.&#xA;She saw Jx looking to the mirror one day and crept up behind him. To her&#xA;horror she saw that the reflection in the mirror was not that of Jx but&#xA;that of the rAkshasi. Then everything became clear to the agent by&#xA;merely gazing at the mirror. We discussed the matter more deeply. It&#xA;became clear to us that we had not bought a cell phone at all but a&#xA;dangerous device that looked like one. Even the muni until that point&#xA;would not have expected that the dangerous contraption was so cleverly&#xA;concealed. It suddenly struck us that we had picked up the sarpa of the&#xA;khANDavan blunder: Even janamejaya could not revive the kurus until&#xA;parIkShit had died.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

It had triggered the waves in the rasArNava. The warm sun was exceedingly pleasant as it dipped towards the western peg. The relieved ourselves of the ill memories of the tragic +++(vivAha?)+++bandha temporarily and wandered on the sunny plains. But the samudra within was hardly placid. The huge waves lashed as result of the highest rasa. Then it came under the grasp of dhumAvati’s sleep and was suppressed for a long time.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
