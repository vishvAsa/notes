यामुनो नाथमुनि-वृद्धावस्थायां जातः, तेनैव नाम दत्तम्।  
महाभाष्यभट्टशिष्यः।  
राजपुरोहितकरतिरस्काराय +अक्कि-आऴ्वान्-नामकं राजसभायां जितवान्। राज्यार्धम् अजयत्।  
नाथमुनिना पुण्डरीकाक्षः, तेन राममिश्रश् च तद्-उपदेशे प्रेरितः।


### मारनेरि-नम्बि-कथा
yAmuna's students included a non-brahmin (likely shudra) called mAraneri-nambi. He used to attend vedAnta classes as yAmuna said "vedAnta is for all" (But his caste fellows excommunicated him!) Once students collected funds to renovate the pAThashAlA. After completion, mAranerinambi was shown the new structure. Next day was gRhapravesha. 

- yAmuna asked - "Where is mAranerinambi?" 
- brAhmaNa students said: "He's not here because he's not a brAhmaNa. He's already seen yesterday - he will come soon as the classes start in the coming days".
- yAmuna said - "So gRhapravesha has already happened yesterday."

## periya-tirumalai-nambi
Aka Srisailanatha, shrIshailapUrNa. Not to be confused with periya-nambi / mahApUrNa.

>  grandson and disciple of Sri Alavandar and maternal uncle of the great Vaishnavite teacher Ramanuja was staying at Tirupati (Tirumalai) and doing Kainkaryam to the Lord of the Seven Hills side by side with his teachings of Vaishnavism. He was also one of the Acharyas of Sri Ramanuja, his nephew. It is said that Lord Srinivasa was very much pleased with him for the paternal care he was taking of Him and on one occasion the God is said to have addressed him “ mama-tata ” (my father) and ever since then Peria Tirumalai Nambikal came to be recognised by the name Tatacharya, a title which his descendants also began to assume.  ...  
> Sri Periya Tirumalai Nambikal who was said to have attained to great glory by his mastery in Srimad Ramayana. Sri Ramanuja, his nephew had to make, it is said, eighteen trips to Tirupati to get himself initiated in this sacred treatise*, under him.

## Tirukkurukai Piran Pillan
> (11th century, AD) was the son of Sri Tirumalai Nambikal. Sri Ramanuja was the sister’s son of Sri Nambikal (Srisailapuma). Sri Pillan’s keen perception, deep knowledge in the scriptures and devotion to Sri Ramanuja endeared him very much to the latter. He was chosen by Sri Ramanuja as the fit and competent person to translate the Tiruvaimozhi, since he had both the capacity and heredity to undertake the task, as a descendant of Sriman Natamunikal. The annotation of Tiruvaimozhi thus brought out by Sri Pillan under the behests of his Acharya is called the famous Aaraayirappadi, the first gloss in Manipravala, an elegant mixture of Sanskrit and Tamil expressions of the Divya
  Prabandas. Further he was made the first and foremost among the seventy-four Simhasanatipatis created by Sri Ramanuja for propagating the Visishtadvaita philosophy after him, and was also announced by him during his last days that he
  (Pillan) was his jnana Putra and successor.

## Tirumalai Srinivasacharya
> He was one of the most trusted disciples of Sri Vedanta Desika (13th and 14th Centuries AD). Tradition has it, that Sri Vedanta Desika who was attending to the worship of Lord Varadaraja, later entrusted the responsibility to Sri Srinivasacharya, whom be considered as the best choice for this service. Thus the Srikaryam of the Temple devolved upon him and, later on his descendants.


## Later royal perceptors
- LaxmIkumAra branch - see separate page.
- Another group of Tatacharyas settled at Srirangam. Known as the ‘ Mudhal Tirimaligai ’ Tatacharyas, they did not lag behind the other branches in propagating Srivaishnavism and increasing its votaries. Their scions have performed * PANCHASAMSKARA ’ to families of royal descent in Gujarat and Rajasthan including the princes of Jodhpur.

## Sundapalayam Ramabhadrachariar
Sri Sundapalayam tirumalai Ramabhadrachariar, a Maha Kavi (Great Poet), was born in 1840 in the village of Sundapalayam, near Coimbatore. Hailing from a well educated family, he enriched his knowledge by constantly interacting with scholars and pandits who visted his family. He had authored over 20 such works through out his life. In spite of his fame, he led a very simple and orthodox life. He died in 1904 at the age of 65.

His poetical works are noted for their versatility, purity, elegance, mastery of language, originality in thought, rich imagery, majesticity of expression, aptness in the choice of words, word play, sweetness in recitation and adaptability to music. Many such poems are intended for and capable of being embedded in pictures. For all these reasons, he is considered a Maha Kavi (Great Poet). All of these characteristics are being reflected in his master piece, Chitrakavyam.
