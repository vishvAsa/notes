      <description>&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&#34;https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2004/11/28/further-proceedings-on-the-battle-front/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We invested today in some heavy duty diplomatic negotiations in the hope&#xA;that we may strengthen our hand for the impending battle. The&#xA;negotiations went off well but we cannot be lulled into security because&#xA;the enemy too is possibly using this as a ploy to obtain a dependable&#xA;escape route if they are pressed hard. Funnily the situation is somewhat&#xA;like Iraq (them) and the USA (us). On the occassions we smashed them, we&#xA;gained little, but their constant assaults have a tremendous nuisance&#xA;value. We felt some omens but refrained from consulting the shakuna&#xA;shAstra to see whether they good or bad, because omens are only&#xA;tradesmen and not brave kShatriyas.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Further skirmishes</title>

We also spied a long but interesting attack&#xA;route that would carry us straight to the ground of the initial&#xA;encounter. We realized that this attack route would save us a lot on&#xA;investing in the baggage train. While there is one outstanding issue, we&#xA;were fairly satisfied with it and will investigate it further. We also&#xA;tested out some other attack routes and have a reasonable picture of how&#xA;the battle may go. We still are bothered by our main weakness, but there&#xA;is not much we can do about it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The first skirmishes</title>
      <link>https://vishvAsa.github.io/notes/sapiens/branches/Aryan/satem/indo-iranian/indo-aryan/jAti-varNa-practice/v1/persons/sage-bloodlines/bhRguH/dvitIyajanmani_bhRguH/chyavanaH/ApnavAna/aurvaH/jamadagniH/MT_charitram/2004/11/2004-11-26_the-first-skirmishes/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&#34;https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2004/11/26/the-first-skirmishes/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It was a cold and blustery day. We sent out a expeditionary force to&#xA;check out the fortress we had secured for the purpose of the showdown.&#xA;The conditions were similar to those predicted on the lower end on the&#xA;day of the impending campaign. We are still vary of fighting the&#xA;encounter in the famous battle ground “Gaugamela”. Our track record was&#xA;mixed. The first encounter was a dismal disaster despite the good&#xA;weather conditions. We knew what caused us the defeat but there was just&#xA;nothing we could do against that deficiency. The second encounter was&#xA;actually easy, we nearly screwed that one up too, but we won in the end.&#xA;Though the victory was of hardly any value. Anyhow, coming back to the&#xA;matter at hand we successfully inspected the fort and returned, though&#xA;the whole journey was quite scary. In the least we had trained ourselves&#xA;to the conditions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The lull before the storm</title>
      <link>https://vishvAsa.github.io/notes/sapiens/branches/Aryan/satem/indo-iranian/indo-aryan/jAti-varNa-practice/v1/persons/sage-bloodlines/bhRguH/dvitIyajanmani_bhRguH/chyavanaH/ApnavAna/aurvaH/jamadagniH/MT_charitram/2004/11/2004-11-24_the-lull-before-the-storm/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&#34;https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2004/11/24/the-lull-before-the-storm/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We were waiting quietly on the undergrowth beside the banks of the River&#xA;mahAsankaTa. There was a tense silence in the air. We had performed our&#xA;karma to the best we could, but were indeed limited by our terrible&#xA;short comings. Would we tide over it? Time would tell, but would we be&#xA;around to receive the answer? There was no going back now. The war had&#xA;been declared. The previous encounters and their results flashed in our&#xA;minds eye. We felt supersitious, but that hardly helped. The disastrous&#xA;showing on the hillock of the shudra bard, came to our minds. We invoked&#xA;sarasvatI, even as divodAsa and vadhryAshva did on the great day of the&#xA;show down with the paNis. We now could feel how it was for sahadeva,&#xA;somaka and bhayamAna as they readied themselves to face the dasyus and&#xA;the shimyus. It was clear that it needed a great effort like that of&#xA;sudAsa if we were to come out victorious on the other side. The weather&#xA;is supposed to be cold, we have no rathas, and we were battling on alien&#xA;territory….&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>A dialog in sandhyAbhASha</title>

This&#xA;lead to a discussion of the sandhyAbhASha used in the text. So we had&#xA;this conversation in mlechChita-manipravala SB.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I: “I feel close to jaya but there is a strange bhaya due to&#xA;precedence”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;R: “Are you really sure that you are close to jaya ?”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I: “That it is good point, I was close to grabbing the Hvarena- same&#xA;time different cycle. Like Frangrasyan (though not is his physical state&#xA;:-)) I tried to grab it but failed. The failure almost happened as&#xA;thought from the blue.”&lt;/p&gt;</description>
