Marc spent a while observing it with his 8 inch sweetie. &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.hello.com/&#34;&gt;&lt;figure class=&#34;&#34;&gt;&#xA;&#xA;    &lt;a href=&#34;https://i0.wp.com/photos1.blogger.com/pbh.gif&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;&#xA;        &lt;img src=&#34;https://i0.wp.com/photos1.blogger.com/pbh.gif&#34; alt=&#34;Posted by Hello&#34; title=&#34;&#34;&gt;&#xA;    &lt;/a&gt;&#xA;&#xA;    &#xA;&#xA;&lt;/figure&gt;&#xA;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://photos1.blogger.com/img/133/1300/640/saturn_13.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;figure class=&#34;&#34;&gt;&#xA;&#xA;    &lt;a href=&#34;https://i1.wp.com/photos1.blogger.com/img/133/1300/400/saturn_13.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;&#xA;        &lt;img src=&#34;https://i1.wp.com/photos1.blogger.com/img/133/1300/400/saturn_13.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; title=&#34;&#34;&gt;&#xA;    &lt;/a&gt;&#xA;&#xA;    &#xA;&#xA;&lt;/figure&gt;&#xA;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I saw it with my eyes from the plane window just before landing in bhAratavarsha.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I always felt Marc was favored by the devas because his lolAkShI who can make any male’s heart miss a beat or more faithfully accompanies him to every expedition to see the stars and can knowledgeably converse about all these matters because of her “purvajanma” training with me.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

After some time somAkhya had also&#xA;purchased a cell phone. Jx had all kinds of problems with his phone.&#xA;Everyone who would look at Jx’s phone would say: “Wow that is a great&#xA;phone.” All features we want is there in it they would say. But Jx would&#xA;shake his head and say it just does not work. They would take his phone&#xA;and place a call and ask their friends to call back and they all felt it&#xA;worked fine. Yet, Jx would insist that it never worked. somAkhya found&#xA;that his cell phone generally had many features, but he rarely had any&#xA;use of them. Jx saw somAkhya’s phone and he said that the ergonomic&#xA;design of it perfectly fitted his hand shape. He said he was always in&#xA;search of such feature and wondered why his phone did not have them. But&#xA;somAkhya never understood what was so fancy in his phone.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&#34;https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2005/02/23/game-levels/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There were the two players of Tetris who were known as Wump and Tump.&#xA;They Wump and Tump were good each playing at their respective level. But&#xA;obviously one was better than the other. My strI finally gave me a hint&#xA;of which level I was at. I feared I was the worst of the pack but in the&#xA;least there were others worse than me. So assuming that my kAmikA was&#xA;right, may be I do play at a reasonable level. The two nityashrI-s who&#xA;always advised me had proposed the two laws: One was: Play the game at&#xA;the right level. After 4 trials you will know your level at a&#xA;sub-conscious level but will need somebody to actually tell you that&#xA;before you actually know it. The other was: Things could have been&#xA;worse.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Fourier’s spells blocked</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&#34;https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2005/02/20/fouriers-spells-blocked/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Mr. Engineer of Mangalagrama (We shall call him Fourier after his&#xA;fascination for illustrating Fourier transforms) had become a vairi of&#xA;our clansmen on account of his daughter. His friend had controlled the&#xA;bhuta that the board had and gave it to Fourier. He laid many an&#xA;incantation on some our clansmen. J, was seized and broken up by his&#xA;charms. J’ mother was harrassed immensely by one of those spells. J’s&#xA;father, who rode roughshod on all and sundry with an air of superiority&#xA;was shattered by Fourier’s mantras. Our own PM was struck down to a&#xA;pitiful condition by another of those spells. We too were scorched but&#xA;by them, but indra and varuNa, sarasvatI and the maruts and the&#xA;ashvinau, bore us aid and we overcame those charms finally. However,&#xA;they had drained us so much that we were left vulnerable on the other&#xA;fronts. We needed to invoke medholka so that we removed the vighnas that&#xA;were preventing us from performing the rahoyAgas to attend to those&#xA;fronts.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>pratya~NgirA and kR^ityA prayoga</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&#34;https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2005/02/20/pratyangira-and-kritya-prayoga/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There was more than one discussion recently as to whether the tantric&#xA;goddess pratya~NgirA was associated with a kR^ityA prayoga. The&#xA;atharvan text clearly deploys the sUkta of pratichIna A~Ngirasa as a&#xA;counter charm against kR^ityAs. An extension of the deployment, similar&#xA;in spirit is seen in the R^ig vidhAna of shaunaka. MS Bhat titled his&#xA;study on the R^igvidhAna as “Vedic Tantrism”. This title is somewhat&#xA;appropriate because the vidhAna appears to represent intermediate&#xA;condition through which the evolution of vedic prayogas into tantric&#xA;prayogas occured. However, Bhat does not pursue the whole evolutionary&#xA;course. While I have traced much of this evolutionary pathway, the lack&#xA;of time prevents me from expounding this in a book-length scholarly&#xA;form. The pratya~Ngira sUktaM and subsequently its first R^ik provide&#xA;an illustration of this evolutionary process.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&#34;https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2005/02/19/khandavaprastha/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Those battles were over. Our gaping breaches in the fronts of sharirasya&#xA;oShadhi, dagdaratha and kosha remained, but the realization dawned on us&#xA;that we had won the encounter. Our amAtya and sachIva had been&#xA;unfortunately cursed with naraka which had visited then in the form of&#xA;the dreadful possession of the old one. indra had however given them a&#xA;boon that they would pass through naraka in pleasant surroundings. We&#xA;had invested the fort of khANDavaprastha after much fighting. Our&#xA;internal affairs were relatively precarious but we now ruled over&#xA;khANDava. ajadADhika, viTmukha and muNDakacha lay dead or wounded on the&#xA;field. We roamed around in khANDavagrAma not knowing where to start and&#xA;what to do. We received a congratulatory message from the Princess of&#xA;Hayastan, who then asked to try to cultivate masura lentils in khANDava.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

But we must remark that we reached the last shop&#xA;keeping cell phones at the end of a long and arduous trek. We did not&#xA;find a phone cum camera contraption. But we bought the last cell phone&#xA;that lay on the last shelf. We await our fate there after.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
