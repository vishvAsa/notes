      <description>&lt;p&gt;Swami Engalazhwan was born in the family of  a Poorvashika-srivaishnava in  Thiruvellarai. His thirunakshathram is Chithirai Rohini.  His parents had named him &amp;lsquo;Vishnuchithan&amp;rsquo; after Swami Periyazhwar. He was  about  80 years younger than  Swami Ramanuja. Nothing is known about his parents, his education and so forth. One has to note that great acharyas were content to be  disciples of Swami Ramanuja. They didn&amp;rsquo;t like to bring their greatness in the limelight.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
