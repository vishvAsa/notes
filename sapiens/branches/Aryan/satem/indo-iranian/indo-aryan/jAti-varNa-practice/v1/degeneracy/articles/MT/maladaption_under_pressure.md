I believe this is part of the larger encounter of the v1s with modernity going bad. As the natural intellectual and to a degree strategic leaders of H society some v1s led the H in their last struggle against the mlechCha-s i.e. 1857CE and lost. In the case of the Kashmirian v1s there was the even earlier trauma of destruction of their world by the u3s.  

The once mighty mahArAShTrI v1s of the last H empire drew into a shell shocked by their very visceral defeat to the English just when they had nearly restored H-dom. The triumph of the English & the transition of the Indians to modernity under English tyranny resulted in the v1s having to negotiate the new memetic complex not on their own terms but with constructs of the occident which they had not understood.

In sense it might be seen as sickle cell anemia as an adaptation to malaria: works but has serious problems for the population in long run. There was no time for them to evolve more robust adaptations to modernity on their own terms. 

This resulted in a disastrous susceptibility to it more dangerous memes and it as consequence a large body of v1s were created especially among those who retained strong traditions of education like v1s in your regions or the south.+++(5)+++ So this new education without proper indigenization among some v1s made them rAvaNa-s &kumbhakarNa-s - v1s but dharmadviT-s.
