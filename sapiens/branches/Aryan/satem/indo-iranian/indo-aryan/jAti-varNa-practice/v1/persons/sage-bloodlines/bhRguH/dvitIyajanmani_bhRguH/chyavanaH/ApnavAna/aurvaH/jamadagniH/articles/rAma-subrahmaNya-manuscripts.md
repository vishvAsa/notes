In or just before 1693, King Śāhaji of Thanjavur founded an academic community at the village of Tiruviśainallūr, on the banks of the river Kāverī near Kumbakonam. This paper reports on a visit to the village in 2005, and describes the work and manuscript library of Rāmasubba Śāstrin, an active scholar from about 1900 whose descendants today energetically maintain some of the traditions founded by King Śāhaji's academy.

## Rāmasubba's Family

I took the photograph in Fig. 1 in 2005. We see a gentleman, Mr V. S***, his uncle and the head of the family, Mr R***, and his son. In front of them is a pile of written works in Sanskrit that they wished to be displayed when I photographed them. On the right are printed books, on the left are palm-leaf manuscripts. What cultural and historical understanding can we bring to bear on this image?

## Tiruviśainallūr today

The photograph was taken during a visit to a village in the Thanjavur district of South India. Tiruviśainallūr is a village close to the better-known temple city of Kumbakonam, in the fertile valley of the Kaveri River, and north of the great temple city of Thanjavur (Fig. 2). It is a tiny village, scarcely more than a row of houses.

## Śāhaji and the Foundation of a New College

In or just before 1693, in South India, King Śāhaji of Thanjavur (regn. 1684–d. 28 Sept 1711[^p3_1], see Fig. 4) founded an academic community at the nearby village of Tiruviśainallūr,[^p3_2] on the banks of the river Kāverī.[^p3_3] To be more precise, he arranged for homes and land in the village to be donated tax-free and in perpetuity to a group of 46 scholars and their descendants.[^p3_4] Some of these scholars settled in the village itself, while others made Thanjavur itself their base. But they formed a single intellectual community, [[P4]] networked not only through their academic work but in many cases – as before – also through ties of family and origin. In the years to come, the scholars of this college would produce a flood of literature on all aspects of the arts and sciences, including linguistics, theology, philosophy, law and ethics, drama and medicine. The manuscripts of much of this work are today housed in the Thanjavur library. Many of these works have been printed; an even greater number are still in manuscript, unpublished, and are yet to be integrated into contemporary scholarship.

## Rāmabhadradīkṣita

One of the first scholars to arrive in Tiruviśainallūr in 1693 was the great Rāmabhadra Dīkṣita (fl. 1638–), who moved to this new centre from his [[P5]] [[P6]]
home village of Kandaramāṇikyam, a unique village that produced several of the most impressive intellectuals of seventeenth and eighteenth century South India.[^p6_5] The Marathi land-grant which records the college endowment notes that Rāmabhadra was to receive four shares of the gift, a higher proportion than other scholars, presumably in recognition of his already substantial reputation.[^p6_6] His presence alone bestowed on the new college an academic probity that would ensure that it acted as a magnet to fellow scholars as well as students seeking education.

Rāmabhadra was a pivotal intellectual figure of the period. Through his education, he was in receipt of scholarly influences from some of the greatest teachers of the age, including Nīlakaṇṭhadīkṣita of Madurai, the pupil of Appayya Dīkṣita.[^p6_7] Through his students and his own writings, he amplified and passed on the learning to a huge number of later scholars. He is just one example of the founding professors of Śāhaji's college.

One of Rāmabhadra's colleagues in the original foundation by Śāhaji was a scholar named Śrīdharaveṅkaṭeśa, better known as Ayyāvaḷ. Śrīdharaveṅkaṭeśa wrote an account of the history of Śāhaji and his Thanjavur court, the Śāhendravilāsa, that has long been an important source of for historians of Early Modern South India.[^p6_8] However, as we shall see below, it was Śrīdharaveṅkaṭeśa's example of religious tolerance and generosity as well as his legacy of powerful songs of religious devotion that have kept [[P7]] his memory alive for most South Indians until today.

## Rāmasubba's family

The gentleman on the left of the picture in Fig. 1 is Mr S***, is a kind, pious and articulate man. We met at the cultural centre that he runs in Tiruviśalūr that celebrates the saintly life of Ayyāvaḷ, a smārta brahman from the late seventeenth century who composed Sanskrit bhajans of great fervour and enduring appeal (see Fig. 5). In the 1930s, Krishnamachariar noted that he was “celebrated in South India for his piety and devotion”.[^p7_9] Milton Singer remarked in the 1950s that Ayyaval's bhajans were an important feature of the religious life of Madras,[^p7_10] and an article in The Hindu newspaper as recently as 2003 described his memory as follows:

> Ayyaval, an erudite Karnataka smartha Brahmin, having spurned the ministerial offer made to him by the then ruler of Mysore, embarked upon a kshetradanam (pilgrimage) of the south along with his wife, Sundari Ammal, and settled down in the village of Tiruvisainallur. The place was then known as Shajirajapuram since it was gifted by Shaji II to 45 pandits well versed in the Vedas (AD1685 – AD1712). In fact, the sign board carrying the name of the village as Shajirajapuram was seen at the entrance to the village on the Veppathur-Kumbakonam road till 1950, and it was an ‘inam’ village up to 1952.[^p7_11]

[[P8]]

*Figure 5: Śrīdhara Veṅkaṭeśvara, a.k.a. Ayyāvaḷ.*

An annual ten-day festival in November in the village still draws huge crowds for a visit to the well in the compound of Ayyāvaḷ's former home, and for the singing of devotional songs.

Mr S***'s family retained strong traditions of their family history. In fact, it was Mr S***'s uncle's wife, unfortunately not shown in the picture, who seemed to be the main holder of the family memory, and many of the details were recounted by her. In the attic of Mr S***'s home there was a large pile of disintegrating documents. Mr S*** and his uncle insisted on giving me several books and a manuscript from this collection. The family were adamant, and insisted that they could no longer read and understand these documents, and that they would be in better hands with a scholar of Sanskrit. This generosity and trust makes it particularly pleasing to be able to report on some of these documents in the present paper.

[[P9]]
*Figure 6: Rāmasubba Śāstrī*

So what can be discovered about the heritage of this family and its place in this village?

## Tiruviśainallūr

### Rāmasubba's descendants

The ancestor that Mr S*** considered to be the most important member of his family was called Rāmasubba, and the family retained his portrait as show in Fig. 6. The family tree is, to my best understanding, as given in Fig. 7.

As I subsequently learned, Rāmasubba was the familiar name of Rāmasubrahmaṇya Śāstrī, a learned scholar, who lived in Tiruviśainallūr from

[[P10]]
about 1840 until his death in 1922. Rāmasubba was well known enough that some of his works are mentioned with approval in Krishnamachariar's *History of Classical Sanskrit Literature*:

> Ramasubrahmanya Sastrin was son of Rāmaśaṅkara and grandson of Asvatthanārāyaṇa and disciple of Śivarāma. He was an authority on Śāstras and lived at Tiruvasanallur, Tanjore Dt. He was born in the last thirties and died in 1922 AD.[^p10_12]

Krishnamachariar noted that Rāmasubba Śāstri was particularly respected for his commentaries on the Upaniṣads, and that in his Alaṅkāraśāstravilāsa he criticised Vidyānātha's definition of poetry[^p10_13], and he wrote the devotional work Bhaktyānandaprakāśa.[^p10_14] But Rāmasubba wrote many other śāstric works including chandas, alaṃkāra, dharma, mīmāṃsā and especially vedānta.[^p10_15]

It is interesting to note too that Rāmasubba's manuscript library was known to Eugene Hultzsch, who listed most of the titles in his Report of 1895–1905.[^p10_16] Hultzsch noted that,

> A large number of works in the list were composed by Râmasubrahmanya Śâstri or Râmasubba Śâstri, the son of Râmaśaṅkara and grandson of Aśvatthanârâyaṇa.[^p10_17]

Hultzsch's Report listed sixty-five manuscripts in Rāmasubba's library, and suggested that this was not the whole collection. The list was dominated by palm-leaf manuscripts (49 items) mainly on Dharmaśāstra, and paper

[[P11]]



*Figure 7: Rāmasubrahmaṇyaśāstrin's descendants, described by his family, Tiruviśainallūr, 2005.*

manuscripts (17 items) mainly on Vedānta. The manuscripts were predominantly in the Grantha script. Most of Rāmasubba's own compositions were written on paper manuscripts in Grantha script.

The Report included over twenty manuscripts of works authored by Rāmasubba himself.[^p11_18] These were:

1.  Matatattvarahasya (Vedānta)
2.  Śaivavaiṣṇavavāda (")
3.  Brahmavidyāmuktāphala (")

[[P12]]
4.  Saguṇanirguṇavādārtha (")
5.  Bhāṭṭakalpataru (Mīmāṃsā), ibid. c. on Bhāṭṭadīpikā
6.  Candrikākhaṇḍana (Vedānta)
7.  Tattvārthavibodhana ("), c. on Vedāntamuktāvalī by Brahmānanda Sarasvatī
8.  Bhāṣyatātparyasaṃgraha (")
9.  Dattāśaucavyavasthāpanavāda (Dharma)
10. Brahmasūtratattvavilāsa (Vedānta)
11. Haribhaktirasaprajñā (”), c. on Bhagavadgītā
12. Bhāratatattvārthavilāsa (")
13. Atharvaśiropaniṣadvilāsa (")
14. Kaivalyopaniṣadvilāsa (")
15. Jagatkāraṇatvavilāsa (")
16. Śvetāśvataropaniṣadvilāsa (")
17. Raghuvīravṛttastava (Chandas)
18. Dharmavivecana (Dharma)
19. Alaṅkāraśāstrasaṃgraha (Alaṅkāra)
20. Sarvavedāntasarvamatatattvārthavilāsa (Vedānta)

From Hultzsch's remarks, it appears that he may have met Rāmasubba personally.

Amongst the books and manuscripts given to me by the family were several publications from about 1913 of original Sanskrit treatises by Rāmasubba himself.[^p12_19] These Sanskrit treatises are mainly Vaiṣṇava theological works. Mrs R*** was able to give some of the social background to one the works, the Viṣṇudveṣakara-Mahāśaivamatamardanam. She recounted how Rāmasubba participated in an intellectual conflict with a scholar who

[[P13]]
*Figure 8: Some cultural centres in the Kaveri river delta*

lived in Mārguḍi (see Fig. refculturalcentres). Although Rāmasubba was a devoted Vaiṣṇava, he had no serious argument with Śaivas, and had even been into a Śaiva temple on some occasions, though he prayed to Rāma. When the scholar Mahāmahopādhyāya Rāju Śāstri, alias Tyāgarājamakhin, of Mannārguḍi, a descendant of Appayadīkṣita, wrote a pro-Śaiva tract, Rāmasubba wrote a counter-blast. A counter-counter-blast came from Mannārguḍi, and so forth for about four exchanges, of which the Viṣṇudveṣakara-Mahāśaivamatamardanam is one.

The family's present-day memory is exactly corroborated Hultzsch's first-hand report from a century ago.[^p13_20]

> [Râmasubba Śâstri] is a Smârta Brâhmaṇa who advocates in his writings the Vaishnava faith and opposes the Śaiva writings

[[P14]]
of Mahâmahôpādhyāya Râju Śâstri alias Tyâgarâjamakhin, who lives at Mārguḍi near Tanjore and is a descendant of Appayadîkshita. His Candrikâkhaṇḍana (No. 1537) is directed against Vyâsarâyayati's Candrikâ (No. 1533).[^p14_21]

## Rāmasubba's Ancestors

In one of these disputatious works, called the Viṣṇudveṣakaramahāśaivamatamardanam, Rāmasubba gives the following interesting account of his ancestors:[^p14_22]
> sāmorpattūrgrāmaḥ khyātaḥ kāñcyāḥ paścād deśe ramye |  
> tadgrāmasthā viprā vatsās tv audīcyākhyās teṣām madhye ||1||  
> raghunāthākhyabhūdevas tv āsīc chāstrārthatattvavit |

In a charming place near Kanchi there is a village called Sāmorpattūr.[^p14_23] The brahmans who live in that village are descendants of Vatsa, called Northerners (audīcya). Amongst them there was a brahman called Raghunātha, who knew the true meaning of the shastras.
> putras tasya catustantrī rāmabhadrākhyapaṇḍitaḥ ||2||

He had a son who was a pandit called Rāmabhadra, who followed the four Tantras.[^p14_24]
> tasya putradvayam khyātaṃ tatraiko 'yyākhyabhūsuraḥ|  
> sa tu vidvān sarvaśāstre tulajīndrapure 'vasat||3||

[[P15]]
He was said to have had a pair of sons, one of them a brahman called Ayyā. He was wise in all the shastras, and he lived in the city of Prince Tulaji.
> tasya putratrayam jātam madhyamo 'ṇṇākhyapaṇḍitaḥ |  
> yasya śiṣyapraśiṣyais tu bhūṣitaṃ maṇḍalaṃ bhuvaḥ||4||

To him were born three sons, the middle one being the pandit called Aṇṇā. His pupils and sub-pupils decorated the whole land.
> tasya putro harer aṃśaḥ sākṣān nārāyaṇāhvayaḥ |  
> aśvatthapūrvapadakaḥ prasiddhaḥ pṛthivītale||5||

His son called Nārāyaṇa was like a part of Hari before one's eyes. He was well known on earth with the pre-name Aśvattha.
> pituḥ sakāśāt saṃlabdhasarvaśāstrārthatattvavit |  
> svapitur nikaṭe śāstram advaitaṃ jñātum āgatāt||6||  
> ahobilākhyaviduṣo mahābhāṣyaṃ gṛhītavān|

He had learned the true meaning of all the shastras from his father. From the scholar Ahobila who had come to learn the Advaita shastra at his own father's side, he grasped the Mahābhāṣya.[^p15_25]

[[P16]]
> svayamprakāśapramukhā yativaryā api svayam||7||  
> yasmād adhītavedāntatritayāḥ khyātapaṇḍitāḥ |  
> mādhvā rāmānujīyāś ca śrīśāṃkaramatānugāḥ||8||

The most excellent ascetics (yatis), headed by Svayamprakāśa,[^p16_26] those famous pandits who had studied the three Vedāntas, the followers of Madhva, Rāmānuja, and those who follow the philosophy of Śaṅkara,
> svasvasiddhāntasaṃsiddhagranthatattvabubhutsayā |  
> yasya cchātratvam āpadya pāṇḍitye prathitā babhūḥ|9||

by the desire to know the truth of the books of those who were fully versed each in their own philosophies, having approached whose scholarship they were celebrated in erudition,
> pātañjale mahābhāṣye gādādharyāṃ ca vārttike|  
> bhaṭṭapādakṛte bhāṣye śabarasvāminā kṛte||10||  
> khaṇḍadevakṛtau bhāṭṭadīpikāyāṃ ca kaustubhe |

[He was expert in (v.14)] Patañjali's Mahābhāṣya and in the Vārttika of Gadādhara,[^p16_27] in the Bhāṣya by Bhaṭṭapāda on the work of Śabarasvāmin,[^p16_28]

[[P17]]
*Figure 9: Rāmasubba's ancestors*

[[P18]]
> brahmānandasarasvatyā racitā candrikābhidhā||11||

in Khaṇḍadeva's work the Bhāṭṭadīpikā and the Kaustubha, on that work [kṛtis tasyām, v. 12] written by Brahmānandasarasvatī[^p18_29] called Candrikā,
> kṛtis tasyāṃ madhvatantracandrikāvanamālayoḥ |  
> vedāntācāryaracitā śatadūṣaṇisaṃjñikā||12||

on the Candrikā on Madhva's system and on Vanamāli,[^p18_30] on that work, the Śatadūṣaṇī composed by Vedāntācārya,[^p18_31]
> kṛtis tasyāṃ doḍḍayāryaracite caṇḍamārute |  
> tattanmatasthabhāṣyeṣu tathā vidyāntareṣu ca||13||

on the Caṇḍamāruta composed by Doḍḍayārya[^p18_32] and on on the commentaries on each of these philosophies and on other sciences.
> jñānaṃ yasya mahānto 'pi śāstriṇas tryambakādayaḥ |  
> jñātvāścaryam mudam caiva prāptā iti hi śuśrumuḥ||14||

The knowledge [in these texts] of that great person [Aśvattha]

[[P19]]
was such that great professors such as Tryambaka etc., having learned of it, became astonished and delighted, so we have heard.[^p19_33]
> sītāpateḥ pādapadme yanmano 'liḥ sadā sthitaḥ |  
> iti śrutaṃ mayā tasya putraḥ śrīrāmaśaṅkaraḥ||15||

His son was Śrīrāmaśaṅkara, of whom it was said, so I heard, that, "whose mind was a bee always staying at the at the lotus feet of Sītā's lord."
> dharmaśāstre tathā pūrvatantre buddhim avāpa saḥ |  
> tasya putratrayaṃ tatra jyeṣṭho nārāyaṇāhvayaḥ||16||

He applied his intellect to Dharmaśāstra and to the prior system (pūrvatantra). He had three sons, the eldest of whom was called Nārāyaṇa.
> śrutismṛtitadartheṣu samyakchraddhāsamanvitaḥ |  
> kodaṇḍapūrvakair varṇair nāmnā rāmeti viśrutaḥ||17||  
> kaniṣṭho madhyamas tatra rāmasubbv iti viśrutaḥ |

He was full of complete faith in the scriptures, traditions, and their meanings. The younger was famous by the name Kodaṇḍa Rāma, the middle one was famous as Rāmasubbu.
> śivarāmāryasaṃjñānāṃ deśikānāṃ mahātmanām||18||  
> prasādāt sarvaśāstrajño rāmadāsyarasānubhūḥ|  
> tenāyam racito grantho lokānugrahakāmyayā||19||

[[P20]]
By the grace of the great-souled teacher called Śivarāmārya, he experienced devotion to Rāma, learned all the shastras. He wrote this book, wishing to benefit the world.
> iti viṣṇudveṣakaramahāśaivamatamardanaṃ sampūrṇam|

The *Viṣṇudveṣakaramahāśaivamatamardana*, “the Crushing of the of the Great Śaiva Doctrine that Creates Enmity to Viṣṇu" is finished.

This family history provides much interesting material, some of it clear, some of it tantalizingly unclear. It is valuable to have an account by a learned paṇḍita, Rāmasubba, in 1912 of the scholarly expertise and intellectual networking of his grandfather Aśvattha in the first half of the nineteenth century.

The reference to Ayya as a resident in Tulajī's City definitely connects the family with eighteenth-century Thanjavur (cf. Fig. 4). If the reference is to Tulajī the first (r. 1730–d. 1735), then we may speculate that either Ayya or his father Rāmabhadra may have lived in Thanjavur in the 1730s.[^p20_34] The family tree of Rāmasubba's ancestors is shown in Fig. 9.


*   **Raghunātha** (of Sāmorpattūr)
  *   **Rāmabhadra**
    *   **Ayya** (of Tulajī's city)
    *   *Unknown son*
      *   **Aṇṇa** (had many pupils)
      *   *Two unknown sons*
        *   **Aśvattha Nārāyaṇa** (studied many texts)
          *   **Śrīrāmaśaṅkara** (Dharmaśāstra etc.)
            *   **Nārāyaṇa**
            *   **Rāma Subba**
            *   **Kodaṇḍa Rāma**

Several of the philosophical works known by Aśvattha Nārāyaṇa were still represented in the libraries of Rāmasubba and his brother Kodaṇḍa, as catalogued by Hultzsch in 1905.[^p20_35] For example, Kodaṇḍa owned copies of

[[P21]]
works by Śaṅkarācārya,[^p21_36] Gadādhara,[^p21_37] Svayamprakāśayati,[^p21_38] and Khaṇḍadeva[^p21_39] while Rāmasubba owned manuscripts of works by Doḍḍācārya[^p21_40], and Vanamālimiśra.[^p21_41] Aśvattha's works were also read elsewhere in the region, for example in the village of Tiruvidaimarudūr.[^p21_42]

Some of these specific links are also confirmed by the patterns of manuscript ownership and scholarship documented in the chapter by Kenneth Zysk in the present volume. Zysk's tables 2 & 3 show, for example, that nine manuscripts on Nyāya owned by Aśvattha Nārāyaṇa were present in the library collection at Kanchipuram. This proves that Aśvattha's manuscripts from Tiruviśainallūr, were studied in Kanchi, one of the great centres of scholarship in South India from medieval times.

This literary and intellectual persistence demonstrates the family's lasting intellectual engagement in serious scholarship and its participation in a philosophical discussion over centuries that stretched from Tiruviśainallūr to Thanjavur and Kanchipuram.

Furthermore, both Kodaṇḍa and Rāmasubba owned manuscripts of works written by members of Śahaji's original endowment in the village, colleagues and contemporaries of Ayyāvaḷ. Thus, Kodaṇḍa owned a work by Bhāskaradīkṣita,[^p21_43] one of the original recipients of Śāhaji's grant, and Rāmasubba owned a works by Mahādeva[vājapeyin],[^p21_44] another of the original

[[P22]]
recipients, as well as Mahādeva's second son Vāsudevadīkṣita (fl. 1729–1736)[^p22_45]. The presence of these manuscripts in the brothers' libraries demonstrates that although evidence is lacking to connect this family's lineage directly to the recipients of Śāhaji's endowment, the family nevertheless engaged with the work of those original scholars and their successors. Although Rāmasubba's ancestor may not have been one of the founding scholars of King Śāhaji's college, dates point to his arrival at Tiruviśainallūr at the time of this foundation. This family tree connects Rāmasubba and his family into a wide network of scholarship in the Kāverī delta that can still be closely documented over several centuries.

Today, the village of Tiruviśainallūr is perhaps a 90 minute drive from Thanjavur on good roads. It is no longer a place of intellectual work, but thanks to Ayyaval's spiritual legacy, it is an active centre of devotion and pilgrimage.

King Śāhaji's gift to 46 leading scholars in 1693 is still remembered well by the Brahman families in the village, and several of the houses of the original scholars are still identified by the inhabitants. The villagers tell enthusiastically of how great intellectuals used to meet and debate abstruse topics together, and to sing devotional hymns, and how their ancestors were actors in a great intellectual and religious drama. The documentary evidence abundantly supports this community memory, as well as the extensive networks of Sanskrit scholarship and intellectual exchange that resulted from Śāhaji's endowment and that were still alive and active in the early decades of the twentieth century.

[^p3_1]: Subrahmanyam 2001:150.
[^p3_2]: A.k.a. Tiruviśalūr, and variously called “Thiruvishaloor” or “Tiruvisalur” by its present residents and in inscriptions (e.g., “Tiruviśalûr” in Hultzsch et al. 1895–1913: passim).
[^p3_3]: The following account draws on the seminal article by (Kuppuswamy Sastri 1904).
[^p3_4]: Idem, 128, 179, 130, 134. This type of land grant was called *sarvamānyam*.
[^p6_5]: Kuppuswamy Sastri (1904: 126–7) lists the works of eight other leading scholars born in Kandaramāṇikyam. He notes that it was, in 1904, “almost in ruins.” On Rāmabhadra's work, see also Krishnamachariar 1937: §160, who notes that Rāmabhadra's brother Rāmacandra (a. of *Keralābharaṇa*) was a "humorous poet."
[^p6_6]: Ibid., 128. Kuppuswami Sastri does not give precise reference to this land grant, and at the time of writing it is no longer traceable in the TMSSM Library, Thanjavur.
[^p6_7]: On these intellectual connections, see further Wujastyk 2007: passim.

[^p14_23]: At the time of writing I have been unable to identify this village.
[^p14_24]: Or "Who knew the four vedas"?
[^p15_25]: Ahobila is the location of the Śrīvaiṣṇava Ahobila Maṭha in Kurnool district, Andhra Pradesh, founded in about AD 1400 (cf. http://www.ahobilamutt.org/). It is a Śrīvaiṣṇava centre following the tradition of Vedānta Deśika (cf. also Rajagopalan 2005, Talbot 1995: 717). Presumably the present verse refers to a scholar from the Ahobila matha visiting Aśvatthanārāyaṇa. Table 3 of Zysk's paper in the present volume shows manuscripts on vedānta owned by the Ahobila tradition present in collections in Kāñcī and in Tiruvalūr.
[^p16_26]: Svayamprakāśayati (or -muni, or -yatīndra) (fl. 1640) wrote the *Rasābhivyañjikā* commentary on the 28 verses of Lakṣmīdharakavi's *Advaitamakaranda*, and 13 other works. Several MSS of his works are found in the Tanjore Sarasvati Mahal library (TMSSML), and the TMSSML journal published his *Svātmādīpana* in 1952 (Potter 2005).
[^p16_27]: Gadādhara's commentary on Raghunātha Śiromaṇi's *Tattvacintāmaṇidīdhiti*
[^p16_28]: Kumārilabhaṭṭa's *Ślokavārttika* on Śabara's *Mīmāṃsāsūtrabhāṣya*.
[^p18_29]: Fl. 1645/1700, wrote a *Candrikā* on Madhusūdana Sarasvatī's *Advaitasiddhi*. He also wrote a *Vedāntasūtramuktāvalī*, of which a manuscript copied in 1908 was kept in the family of Subrahmaṇyaśāstrin. In the colophon of that MS he says that his teacher was Paramānandasarasvatī. There is another MS of the work in the TMSSML library.
[^p18_30]: Fl. 1650–1700, pupil of Bhaṭṭojī Dīkṣita, and wrote about a dozen works on vedānta, nyāya, vyākaraṇa etc.
[^p18_31]: I.e., Vedānta Deśika
[^p18_32]: Fl. 1590 wrote about 14 works on vedānta etc., including *Caṇḍamāruta* on Vedānta Deśika's *Śatadūṣaṇī*.
[^p19_33]: Hultzsch (1895–1905: v. 2, 55, #1343) records a manuscript of a Vedānta work by a Tryambaka, the *Siddhāntavaijayantī*, in the collection of Sundaravājapeyi in Tiruvidaimarudūr.
[^p20_34]: This rules out the possibility of this Rāmabhadra being the seventeenth-century Rāmabhadra Dīkṣita.
[^p20_35]: Hultzsch (1895–1905: v. 2) lists Kodaṇḍa's library in § 14 (pp. 64–7) and Rāmasubba's in § 15 (pp. 67–71).
[^p21_36]: #1456: *Śārīrakamīmāsābhāṣya*, #1480: *Vivekacūḍāmaṇisaṃgraha* and #1481: *Jagadutpattiprakaraṇa*.
[^p21_37]: #1465: *Hetvābhāsasāmānyalakṣaṇa*

[^p21_40]: #1532: *Caṇḍamāruta*.
[^p21_41]: #1540: *Nyāyaratnākara*; #1541: *Nyāyāmṛtasaugandhya*.
[^p21_42]: #1287 c. on (Gādādhara's?) *Vādārtha*.

[^p21_44]: #1505: *Āśaucatattva*.
