      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;background&#34;&gt;Background&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Shamaiya Iyengar (Shyama Iyengar) popularly known as Anche Shamaiya, [1] son of varadaraja Iyengar, dewan of Krishna Raja Wadiyar II (varad-rao) and grandson of Vasudeva Iyengar(A great Sanskrit scholar), was the minister of the police and the post office (also served as the intelligence department) during the time of Hyder Ali and Tipu Sultan.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;He was originally from Sulikunte in Kolar district of Karnataka (also known as Sulkunte), near Budikote in Bangarpet. Although it is said he was born in shambonahali or shamaiahhalli after his name sake (source: Mysore State Gazetteer) in the tumkur district, his ancestors had migrated by then to sulikunte(sulakunte) agrahara formerly known as soolikere village in Kolar district from tumkur. Shamaih and his ancestors were also religious gurus to what Lt Col Kirkpatrick refers to as the brinjara people.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
