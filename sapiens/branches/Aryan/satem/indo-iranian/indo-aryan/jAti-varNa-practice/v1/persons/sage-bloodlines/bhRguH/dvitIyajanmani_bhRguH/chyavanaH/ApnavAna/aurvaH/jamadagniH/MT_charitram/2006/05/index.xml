      <description>&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&#34;https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2006/05/28/the-result/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;kR^iShamukha and paraShumukha organized their attack at us with the deep&#xA;hate and hope of overthrowing us for good– the mahochChATanaM. We were&#xA;enveloped by the kR^ityA-s of dhUmAvatI that they had sent. Our senAnI&#xA;had warned us well of what was approaching. We paused for a moment and&#xA;decided that we must break up kR^iShamukha and paraShumukha as well as&#xA;their spells as we had done to yUpa-shiras and matsya-pucCha-shiras in&#xA;that great battle of dvAdasha. In every respect we were having a deja vu&#xA;with respect to that old battle. We laid the circle of jamadagni’s&#xA;daughter’s ra~NkuTi (Vicia tetrasperma), in the middle we laid the&#xA;ayokaNa (Polygonum convolvulus) and deployed the nirR^iti-dispelling&#xA;spell of our patriarchs, the bhR^igus of yore. When the words were&#xA;uttered: “Seek the one who does not make offering nor rites; the may you&#xA;follow the road of the thief and dacoit; seek that other man than us,&#xA;that is your path; salutations be you, O goddess nirR^iti.”&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&#34;https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2006/05/14/the-passing-characters/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Fancying myself as the wandering vrAtya I wandered in the mAnuSha lokaH.&#xA;I noticed many leaving images in the eye and then in the brain. At face&#xA;value these images are useless, but who knows, they may be the&#xA;well-springs of future thoughts on the great moha. I appreciate daNDin&#xA;that jewel of the bR^ihatcharaNa-s because of the word “bhramati”. I&#xA;wandered beside the river holding my kapAla given to silence observing&#xA;all. Poor and rich men of various races. Men bereft of skills, very&#xA;skilled but un-wanted and full of handy abilities. Scurrying like&#xA;shailUShas and mAgadhas and mankha-s they went about their business&#xA;hoping to fill their bellies. There were women with the great beauty of&#xA;yakSiNis and apsaras and others with the form of rAkShasis in&#xA;ashoka-vana, also going about their existence. We had intersected in&#xA;life with a friend who discovered humor in Telugu and Tamil films. We&#xA;wondered if there were others in the world on that path — it was not&#xA;before long in our wanderings before we saw many such. We saw another&#xA;northerner revelling in his chalices of mada. Another northerner was&#xA;singing songs of taurIya gAnaM, moving all hearers. We saw others&#xA;reveling in their respective moha-s, the ephemeral world. Their jollity&#xA;was much like the boat ride we were on.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&#34;https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2006/05/13/tracked-by-the-3-kritya-s/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Mn, Jx and me assembled for the long awaited Kuriltai of the clan on the&#xA;steppes. The only one missing from our old clan assembly was the muni,&#xA;who was doing his time beside the somesha shrine where we spent the most&#xA;liberated days of our existence when our aged clansmen who have now&#xA;attained vaivasvata were still alive. Those days were our introduction&#xA;to the sanAtana dharma and aswell as the seeds of our future. She who is&#xA;not a clanswoman but our companion in exploits like ekAnaMshA was also&#xA;missing on account of her advanced level of maturity probably having&#xA;surpassed us ruffians when we became a band. We were having this saMgama&#xA;after a gap of more than 10 years. We both realized how Jx had been&#xA;freed from the grip of the abhichAra of Fourier’s party by his yoga. Jx&#xA;was doing pretty well and in good health. Mn and me were a touch nervous&#xA;about the place were we held our Kuriltai for we were not free from the&#xA;cloud– it was the place that proved my Gaugamela on not one, but two&#xA;occasions. Mn and me knew that if we were found together the bagalAmukhI&#xA;attack could be simultaneously launched on us. Of the clansmen Mn was&#xA;rarely around these days so the whole saMgaMa was as rare as a&#xA;conjunction marking the begining of the kaliyuga per the Hindu calender.&#xA;Mn’s behavior was best approximated by that of a musalendra, while the&#xA;muni who stood on the other shore thought and acted possibly much like&#xA;us.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&#34;https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2006/05/08/the-second-circle/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We had sought she who dwells in the midst of the kiri chakra. Our&#xA;AchArya’s AchArya the one learned in the great atharvan lore with all&#xA;its parishiShTha-s, kalpa-s brAhmaNa and upaniShads retired to live in&#xA;the most picturesque land south of lATa pradesha, with forests largely&#xA;inhabited by niShAda tribes. There on the banks of the Damanganga river&#xA;he settled down with the forest providing him the quietude and oShadhI-s&#xA;for his rites. We decided after the great battle of tIkShNa jvara to&#xA;proceed to the sylvan slopes of Damanganga to spend time in tapasya and&#xA;acquisition of the vidyAs of the goat-headed one and she who dwells in&#xA;the midst of the kiri chakra. We got into the train that bore us on the&#xA;long journey and then we used a ratha to reach the silent Ashrama on the&#xA;banks of the Damanganga to go with our acts. The setting was most&#xA;splendid. We found that path through which ShaShThinAtha and his wife&#xA;AryamekhalA had traversed the regions infested with fierce kirATas and&#xA;bhilla-s to reach the shores skirting the sahayAdrI’s. There we went to&#xA;the ancient kumAra gR^iha, we as the sun was reaching the western peg.&#xA;The pleasant breezes were blowing from the west and we sat by the&#xA;chaitya. The amaraugha of his includes rudra, himavat’s pretty daughter,&#xA;agni and ga~Nga. The mAnavaugha began with vishvAmitra and haimavatI,&#xA;passing through, brahmAskanda, through ShaShThinAtha and AryamekhalA.&#xA;From him to saMbhadra and divyamekhalA. Then the mAnavaugha split into&#xA;the ogha of the adhoretas who moved along the paschima mayUkha and&#xA;pUrNagiri pITha and ogha of the Urdhvaretas that dwelt in prAchya&#xA;mayUkha and then moved to kumAra tapovana. We joined the adhoretasas,&#xA;being of this world.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&#34;https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2006/05/07/the-first-circle/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There we moved swiftly on our vAhana and placed it on the stalls. The&#xA;two shUdra-s kR^iShNamukha and shUdra-shiromaNi met us at the ashvashAla&#xA;where we kept our horses. One of the shUdra-s asked, O foreign brahmin,&#xA;should we participate in a vigorous game of kandUka kR^iDa in the yonder&#xA;kandukaprastha that lies beyond the nAga-bila and at the foot hills of&#xA;the vAnara parvata. The other shUdra said: this place is blessed with&#xA;many women who are the handiworks of manmatha, yet why is it we are&#xA;cursed to wander in these uninteresting assemblages with nothing more of&#xA;interest than the aforesaid kR^IDa. Soon some others joined in and asked&#xA;who among the young women was the greatest of the works of&#xA;manmatha-kalA. Just then madana’s companion, the malaya-vAta wafted&#xA;bearing the fresh odors of the shaila-puShpa-s captivating the minds&#xA;with the presence of the wielder of the ikShu-chApa. There was&#xA;considerable unanimity in the assembly in picking one of the foremost of&#xA;the strI-chUDAmaNi-s. They described that one whose voice was like the&#xA;one who is brought up in another’s nest, whose tvacha was like the light&#xA;of the star Ardra, whose eyes were like those of a tittirI, whose each&#xA;vakShas was like the suvarNa kalasha held by the awful vinAyaka. We knew&#xA;this kAMini better than the rest and uttered silently to ourselves the&#xA;statement: “She said: “gaurI rests in her abode guarded by nandin” “. We&#xA;cannot talk more of this sakhI, for in the world of men, people can&#xA;connect the dots. Then they moved on to describe that other mohini on&#xA;whom they were unanimous. Firstly, they declared she was unusually a&#xA;tIkShNa tri-patha strI, while most strI-s were komala tripatha-s or&#xA;chatush-patha-s. Our curiousity was greatly roused regarding this&#xA;strI-ratna, so we asked our priya-sakhI to lead us to her.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

It brought me some nostalgia and with due permissions I scanned&#xA;them to put them up. She drew much better later in life, but I was never&#xA;able to get her to draw more like these again. It is sad that a great&#xA;tapestry of the yogini-s, vArAhI, mantriNI, ashvAruDhA and kAmeshvarI,&#xA;in their war march, that she drew with considerable detail seems to be&#xA;lost now.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
