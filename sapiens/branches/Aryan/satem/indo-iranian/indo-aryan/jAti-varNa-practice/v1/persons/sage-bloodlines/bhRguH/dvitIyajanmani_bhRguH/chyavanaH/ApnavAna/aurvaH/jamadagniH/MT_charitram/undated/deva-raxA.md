Coming to the family deities, yes Kumara is indeed one of them. Following are our tutelary deities, considering both our maternal & paternal side:

1. Palani's Dandayudhapani Temple: When MT was barely few days old, due to some accident his tiny head was bruised & he got a cut :(. My maternal Tatha immediately took MT to Palani and placed him at the feet of Karttikeya. My mother used to often narrate the story. I believe MT may have developed a special fondness for Kumara for saving him right at that stage üôè

2. Kathayee Amman:
   Katyayani is the tutelage deity on my father's side. He still regularly tries to support this temple. Before I was born, my father used to worship Katyayani with the 75th ≈õloka of the Soundarya Lahari (Twa stanyam manye dharanidhara kanye hridhayatha...)

3. The form of Vishnu known as Sundararaja Perumal is also a tutelage deity on my maternal side.
