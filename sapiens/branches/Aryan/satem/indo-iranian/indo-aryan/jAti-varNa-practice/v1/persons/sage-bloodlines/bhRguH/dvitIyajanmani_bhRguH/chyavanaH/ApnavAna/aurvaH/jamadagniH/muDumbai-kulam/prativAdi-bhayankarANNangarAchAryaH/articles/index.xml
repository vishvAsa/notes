      <description>&lt;p&gt;was it the original Annan or his son/grandson who became tk? Latter is more possible.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Also, the title PB originally belonged to Swami Desikan as seen from the colophon of sindhumativilasa written by Gopanarya, Swami&amp;rsquo;s sishya. So KV gave the title of his father to PB swami.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;PBA Swami Vaibhavam&lt;br&gt;&#xA;By Sri T.S. SundaraRajan&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;pedigree&#34;&gt;Pedigree&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Sri Kanchi Prativadi Bhayankaram AnnangarachAriar Swami was born in the year 1891, ‘mIna-viSAkham of year vikrti’, in SrIvatsa gOtram, of the noble ‘muDumbai’ descent, same as SrI piLLai-lOkAchArya and his brother SrI azhagia-maNavALa-perumAL nAyanAr. ‘mithuna Sukla-EkAdasI’ is the ‘tiru-adhyayana-tithi’ of svAmi (1891-1983) of blessed memory. The title ‘prativAdi-bhayankaram’ was given to his ancestor SrI-hastigiri-aNNA, by no less than Srivarada nAyanAcharya, the son of svAmi vEdAntadESikan. This PB ‘mUla-purusha’ became one of the chosen ‘ashTa-dig-gaja’ disciples of SrI-maNavALa mAmunigaL. Thus, the PB lineage represents the confluence of two eminent AchArya, viz., svAmi-dESikan and SrI mAmunigaL. Hence the PB ‘tanian’:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The more recent PB Annangaracharya who lived in the previous century is the one who has written a lot against Vadakalai views. He descends from the same PB Annan. At some point of time in his later life, he performed Prapatti in secret from Abhinava Ranganatha Parakala Swamy (1884-1966).  He has published several texts in a Ramanuja Granthamala and a Vedanta Desikah Granthamala, the latter being on the guidance of the Parakala Jeer so presumably post-prapatti.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;He was deemed to be deeply awed by the works of स्वामिदेशिकः and remained his sincere भक्त only in the closet to the extent that he had an idol of स्वामिदेशिकः that he did विग्रहाराधनं to at his residence. But externally he was an evidently and reputedly fierce advocate of the दक्षिणकला interpretations of our common पूर्वाचार्यग्रन्थाः । It&amp;rsquo;s heard that, he used to add a त्रिदण्डं to the आचार्यविग्रहं at his place when visited by दक्षिणकलाश्रितशिष्याः to hide his awe of स्वामिदेशिकः । This seems to supported by the claims that he performed प्रपत्ति at the feet of परकालमठ आचार्यः during his final days in atonement perhaps.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
