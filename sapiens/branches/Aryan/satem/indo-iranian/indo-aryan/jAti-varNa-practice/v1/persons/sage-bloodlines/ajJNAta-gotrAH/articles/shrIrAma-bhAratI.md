## LS forward
Sriram, as he used to be called, was a brilliant student of Delhi University,  
who went to the US (late 60's/early 70's) for his Ph D in Physics.  
During his thesis work, he is said to have attained an awakening  
and left forthwith for India whereupon he went back to his school in New Delhi  
and started teaching the students devotional hymns. 

Soon he got married and worked as an employee of the AIR.  
His true love was however the Divya Prabandham which he learnt formally under the aegis of the Vanamamalai Matham.  
He also obtained guidance on the difficult and intricate subject of Arayar Sevai.  
In his last years, he ran a Prabandham school for poor villagers in Pallikaranai in the outskirts of Madras and rendered yeomen service towards popularizing the vanishing art of Arayar Sevai.  
He has to his credit a scholarly work on Arayar Sevai and many tape recordings of the Alwar pasurams rendered in ragam.  

For the last few years, he was suffering from cancer. He has now succumbed to it.

## kAmeshvaran Reminiscence
He was 51. Real sad. You know, thinking back and remembering him walking in Bharati Nagar, coming to school, taking off his chappals before entering the school gate, doing dandam namskaram to school and teachers, teaching songs sitting in front of the Saraswati statue, chanting divya prabandam along with his wife in Raamar koil...
