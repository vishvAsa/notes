The reason I don’t comment on caste issues is for two reasons

1) It makes Hs falsely think they are very divided people while Ms are united. (i.e- look up number of Alawite Shiites killed in Syria last year)

2) I blame UC elites for our problems, not OBCs SCs STs.


## Division exaggerated
Let’s look at 1) first. The idea that Hindus are divided on caste and hate each other is a misleading myth. Hindus are fragmented but do not hate each other. Muslims have a veneer of unity but hate each other to the point of murder.

### Muharram
You must’ve heard of Muharram. Its a holiday in parts of India iirc. Do you know what its origins are? Its Shiites whipping themselves in solidarity with Ali’s family that was killed at the Battle of Karbala.

Most non-Muslims don’t know this but the reason the civil war in Islam was so sensitive was because the earliest Sunni Caliphs who were companions of the Prophet Mohammed literally murdered the family of the Prophet Mohammed.

Shiites are followers of the party of Ali and are supporters of the blood family of the prophet Mohammed. However, Shiites claim that Sunnis killed and murdered the Prophet’s family over the greed of political power.

The strength of this hatred is so strong that countries with both Sunni-Shia populations like Syria, Iraq, Lebanon etc. basically are in constant conflict, distrust and usually escalate the situation to violent murder of each other.Image

Last year, after the fall of Assad’s regime, you had a 3 week long period of purging and ethnic cleansing of the coastal elite Alawite population by Sunni gangs backed by the state and by the Turks. 

### Fake hatred
If Hindu castes hate each other so much, why is there not a single incident of two castes murdering each other in the tens of thousands?

The answer is a combination of two facts:

1) The ‘hatred’ is just a desire to gain political power and share of the resource pie.
2) Hindus in general are not very senselessly murderous people.

#### Islamic uniformity?
The reason Islam doesn’t have to worry about 

1) is because for the most part their countries resemble a coherent unity in ethnicity, language and sect. The Islamic countries that don’t have this unity are full of murderous violence (Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, Pakistan).


## Self-goals
Let’s come to 2). Why should I hate OBC SC ST leaders for sticking up for tribal interests and trying to do good for their caste when my own caste is so clueless, disconnected and useless that they prefer to be global elite citizens, ‘temporarily embarrassed’ Americans who don’t care about India and Indian politics.

I hate my own who have betrayed us, I don’t care about others.
