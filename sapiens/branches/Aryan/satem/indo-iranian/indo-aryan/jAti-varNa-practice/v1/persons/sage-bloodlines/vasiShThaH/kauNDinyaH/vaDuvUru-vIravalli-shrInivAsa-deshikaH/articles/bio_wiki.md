Vaduvur Veeravalli Srinivasa Desikachariar (4 November 1928 — 9 September 2014) was an Indian scholar. He studied Sanskrit and published several books. In 2001, he received the Rashtrapathi Award from the President of India as a Sanskrit scholar, one of the highest awards awarded by the Indian state.[1]  

Life and contribution  
[edit]  
Vaduvur (Vaduvoor) Veeravalli Sri Srinivasa Desikachariar Swami was born in Vaduvur, India on 4 November 1928 (Vibhava Varusham Aippasi Maasam Pushya Nakshatram), to Srimathi Kanakavalli and Sri Veeraraghavachariar.  

Five generations of his ancestors were trained in Veda Adhyayis and were rendering service to Srimad Andavan Ashramam without compensation  

His uncle (Chitappa), Ganapadi Sri Narasimhachariar, was one of the great Veda teachers of those days, teaching in the famous Veda Patasala in Mannargudi founded by Sri Anna Swami Iyengar (continued by his son, A. Srinivasa Iyengar Swami). In fact, he introduced the weekly tests in Veda Patasalas in Tamil Nadu modelled after the Kerala pattern. When his father died when he was 12, the young Desikachariar was enrolled by his uncle, in that Patasala and started training in Divya Prabandham from Kanthadai Ramanujachariar Swami and later Veda Adhyayanam from his uncle. He completed Veda Adhyayanam (up to Kramantham) in seven years and completed the Ganantham and then Salakshanam (equivalent to PhD) in just one more year. He was examined at the Sankara Mutt and cleared these in First Class.  

As Yajamana Bhakti, when Sri Desikachariar was honoured with the President Award in 2001, he went straight to Mannargudi and sought the blessings of A Srinivasa Iyengar Swami, his well wisher and founder of Mannargudi Veda Pata Sala and then later visited his own house in Vaduvur.  

## Prapathi/Saranagathi  


Srimad Andavan Swami and Vaduvur Desikachariar  
Our Swami had his Prapatthi performed at a very tender age by Srimad Therazhundur Andavan Swami and Samasrayanam under Akkur Andavan Swami. Thus, he along with Sri Thenbirai Lakshmi Raghavachariar remains one of the few living sishyas with links to six Acharya Sreshtas of the Andavan Parampara.  

## Our Swami and late Sri Kanchi Paramacharya  

While Sri Desikachariar was 13 years old and having training in Prabandha Adyayenam, Kanchi Paramacharya Sri Chandrashekarendra Saraswati Swami was visiting Mannargudi. The great Sage had tremendous respect for the Mannargudi family. Srinivasa Iyengar introduced the young scholar to Paramacharya, who asked the boy to recite the "Koondhal malar mangaikkum man madanthaikkum". Young Sri Desikachariar recited this Pasuram in a resounding manner and was blessed by the Paramacharya.  

Later, Sri Desikachariar's Ganantham Pariksha was conducted by none other than Late Kanchi Paramacharya himself.  

Tremendously impressed by the then young Yajur Veda Ganapadi, Paramacharya appointed him as a Parikshaadhikari (examiner) for the Vedic Exams conducted by Sankara Mutt Patasalas and our swami performed this task for nearly 55 years before he gracefully let others do that job.  

Kanchi Paramacharya Sri Chandrashekarendra Saraswati Swami continued to be his Guide and Philosopher for more than 50 years.  

During the time, Sri Kanchi Paramacharya desired that Sri Desikachariar should publish some authoritative works on Dharma Saastra. Desikachariar located the Telugu edition of "Pithru Medha Saram" originally done by Vaideeka Sarvabhouma Thozhappar, and translated to Devanagari with all Pramanams and a Tamizh vyakyanam.
