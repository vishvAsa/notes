Preface

BiographiesarecertainlyrareinKannaḍaliterature. ṀṢPuṭṭaṇṇa’s biography of Kuṇigala Rāmaśastri made clear to me the desirability of more such works in Kannaḍa, and I began by writing a biography of my grandfather, Srīkanṭha Śāstri of Cāmarājanagara.35 I then determined to write a biography of his in-law Sōsale Garaḷapurī Śāstri, and as I collected the relevant material, I approached his second son Sōsale Ayyā Śāstri for assistance. He provided much information, placing great faith and confiidence in me. I have been able to publish this book only with his help. I plan to follow up with a biography of Rāmaśāstri of Cāmarājanagara.36 I hope to continue these efforts, publishing the biography of a great \(Kannaḍa\) scholar each year in the *Kādambarī Saṇgraha*monthly. Readers supportive of my intentions may send me other biographies they may come across of scholars. I plan to begin work soon on the biographies of *Aḷiya*Liṇgarāja Arasu, who was a student of Garaḷapurī Śāstri, and of the well-known Basappa Śāstri.37 There is no doubt that the number of such works of signifiicance will grow in proportion to encouragement by Kannaḍigas.

35This biography of Cāmarājanagara Śrīkaṇṭha Śāstri is the second biography incuded in this volume, and Puṭṭaṇṇa’s biography of Kuṇigala Rāmaśāstri, fiirst published in 1910 C.E., is the third. ṀṢPuṭṭaṇṇa \(1854–1930 C.E.\) and Garaḷapurī Śāstri’s second son Ayyā Śāstri \(1855–1934 C.E.\) were both noted literary fiigures of the time. The families were connected by marriage, Ayyā Śāstri having married Śrīkaṇṭha Śāstri’s daughter Lakṣmīdevamma, and Ayyā Śāstri’s third son Rāmasvāmi Śāstri having married Puṭṭaṇṇa’s daughter Sītamma.

Chapter One: The Narrative of Vijayanagara

Vidyāraṇya *Svāmi* founded  Vijayanagara on Wednesday,theseventh day of the *śuddha*fortnight in the month of Vaiśākha, in the Dhātu year 1258 of the Śāḻīvāhana era, corresponding to the year 1336 of the Christian era.39

38The translator has found several sources for this verse, which is clearly of importance. 

Row \[1905, p. 10\] claims that this verse is a temple inscription in Hampi. It has not been possible to trace the original inscription. A version appears in the *Guruvaṁśakāvya *\(6:8\)

\[Śāstri 1928\], dated to c. 1735 C.E.: *“nāgeṣvarkairmita iha śake śālivāhasya yāte dhātaryabde* *śubhasamucite māsi vaiśākhanāmni | śukle pakśe suguṇapitr̥bhe sūryavāre sulagne saptamyām śrīvijayanagarīm nirmane nirmamendrah. ∥”*This verse seems to have been traditionally known, and appears in a document dating to 1809 C.E., called the *Kaifiyattu Kurugōḍu *\[Kalburgi 1994, p. 449\], part of the Mackenzie collection of *Kaifiyats.*The Archeological Department of Mais ūru \[1932, p. 111\] references this verse via Row \[1905\]. This chronology is also referenced by Sastry and Venkataramanayya \[1946, p. 15\]. The version in this biography is a variation of the version in the Introduction and Chapter 1 of Row \[1905\]. 

“Nagashwarkay, Namitasakay, Salivahasyayata, Dhaturyabday, Sugunasahi-tay Masa Visaki Namny Suklay Pakshay Suraguruyutay Soumya Varay Su-lagnay Saptamyam Sri Vijayanagaray Nirmamay Nerinamendra.” 

The following chronogram is critical to this verse. *Nāgeṣvarke: dvandva*compound of the masculine locative singulars *nāge\+iṣau\+arke*, encoding the date. Row \[1905\] uses the encoding *nāga=8, iṣu=5, arka=12*, matching those of Sircar \[1996, p. 230\], and Monier-Williams

\[1899\], who gives *nāga=7 or 8, iṣu=5, and arka=12*. The “reversal” formula *aṇkānaṁ* *vāmato gatih. *\[Sircar 1996\] leads to the date Śālivāhana 1258, or 1336 C.E. The following translation \(after Row \[1905\]\) is adequate for our purposes. 

“On Wednesday, the seventh lunar day of the bright half of Vaiśakha, in the year Dhātu, Śāḻīvāhana śaka 1258, in an auspicious time with Guru \(Jupiter\) in the rising sign \(lagna\), I, the prince of ascetics, have constructed this city in Vijayanagar.” 

39Vidyāraṇya is a deeply revered fiigure for his scholarly and political accomplishments. 

He helped the brothers Hakka \(Harihara I, 1346–1357 C.E.\) and Bukka \(Bukka Rāya I, 1357–

1377 C.E.\) establish the Vijayanagara kingdom, and served as mentor and inspiration for its 4

A Muslim torrent had raged uncontrolled through our Bhārata before the founding of Vijayanagara. Tossed about in this flow, now sinking, now rising, undefended, at imminent risk of extinction, were pious sects, ancient temples, and great repositories of learning.40 At such a time it was that a titan named Vidyāraṇya checked this torrent, founded Vijayanagara, and restored *sanātana dharma*.41 Vijayanagara, indeed, was the kingdom that protected all Hindus of the south when the Muslims had grown strong, and threatened their *āryan*ways and freedoms. Vidyāraṇya, indeed, was the august fiigure who delivered such succour by halting the spread of impious ways. But for his founding of this kingdom, all peoples of the South would have become Muslims, ceding to them this Bhārata of ours, and wiping out all traces of the great *āryan*people they once were. 

The celebrated kingdom of Vijayanagara occupied a vast expanse on the southern bank of the Tuṇgabhadrā river, near the city of Hosapēṭe in the region of Baḷḷāri. On the northern bank of this river is the city of Ānēgondi. 

According to tradition, this is the renowned city of Kiṣkindha,42 dating to the times of Śrī Rāma. It had been ruled by great kings from *āryan*dynasties for seven hundred years.43

early kings. The kingdom even appears to have been called Vidyānagara, in his honour. He was also a profound scholar, and with his brother Sāyaṇa, ranks among the most authoritative *Vēdic*commentators, especially on *Advaita*philosophy. Vidyāraṇya is believed to have become pontiff of the Śr̥ṇgēri Maṭha around 1375 C.E. 

40A reference to the extensive destruction of temples and libraries by the Muslims, and forced conversions to Islam. 

41“Eternal/ancient *dharma*”, the traditional and correct name for “Hinduism”. It is certainly true that Vijayanagara’s existence helped preserve Hindu traditions and culture. 

While we have no insights into the minds of its founders, Vijayanagara’s later kings and their Muslim rivals appear not to have been motivated purely by religious considerations. 

See page 367. 

42The kingdom of the *vānara*king Vāli. En route to Rāvaṇa’s capital Laṇkā, Rāma slew Vāli, and forged an alliance with his brother Sugrīva. 

43This statement is initially baffling, given the preceding allusion to Kiṣkindha’s great antiquity. The present author, however, is merely echoing a line from Farishta \[Briggs 1829\], which is also quoted by Row \[1905, p. 4\]: “Chiefs of Anagondi had existed as a ruling family for seven hundred years prior to the year 1350.” Farishta saw Vijayanagara as a continuation of the Cāḷukyan empire, which spanned seven centuries, and included three dynasties which, albeit unrelated, shared a name. The fiirst, based in Bādāmi, was founded in 543 C.E.; the others, based in Veṇgi and Kalyāṇa, lasted till around 1189 C.E. Farishta’s error, however, is understandable. The Āravīḍus, Vijayanagara’s last dynasty, and usurpers of the throne from the Tuḷuvas, had promoted this theory to claim illustrious descent. Sources such as

sons of sarasvatī

Vidyāraṇya, ascending the throne of Vijayanagara, ruled it with great devotion for twenty years, creating prosperity akin to that of *Rāmarājya*by the grace of the goddess Bhuvanēśvarī,44 and handing it over to Bukkarāya in the year 1363 of the Christian era,45 corresponding to the Śubhakr̥tu year 1284 of the Śāḻīvāhana era, attained transcendence after 32 years of deep contemplation. *Svāmi*Vidyāraṇya is known to have been a *Smārta*brāhmaṇa belonging to the *Hoysaḷa Karṇāṭaka*sect.46 A poet has had this to say about how he imbued our world with virtue:47

Kōnērinātha’s *Bālabhāgavatam*, the *Basava Purāṇa*, and an inscription from Dēvanahaḷḷi

\[Rice 1879, p. 252\] claim that the Āravīḍus were descendants of Vijjala, the *Kaḷacūri*prince who usurped the Cāḷukyan throne \(see Plate 39\). These works use titles such as as *Cāḷukya* *Cakravarti *\(Cāḷukya emperor\), *Cāḷukya Anvaya Bhava *\(Cāḷukya by descent\), and *Cāḷikki* *Nārāyaṇa *\(Cāḷukya Nārāyaṇa\) for members of this family, including the regent Rāma Rāya \(1484–1565 C.E.\) and his grandfather Tirumala. This Cāḷukya connection is dismissed by Eaton \[2005, p. 94\], but a deeper irony arises from this claim. The Muslim Deccan Sultanates and Vijayanagara had been engaged in a complex dance of warfare and shifting alliances. Kalyāṇa had been under Muslim rule for at least two centuries before Rāma Rāya’s time, but his preoccupation with it caused him to ensure that the city always remained under the control of the Muslim kingdom currently allied with him. Such moves likely caused frustration among the four Sultanates, as well as the perception of treachery, strengthening their resolve to join forces against Rāma Rāya, ultimately causing Vijayanagara’s fall in 1565

C.E. See the prelude to Tāḷikōṭe starting page 367. 

44Bhuvanēśvarī is a manifestation of Durgā or Pārvatī, and the patroness of Vijayanagara. Vidyāraṇya was a devotee of this deity. *Rāmarājya*is Rāma’s 10,000-year reign after his return to Ayodhyā following his victory over Rāvaṇa, as described in the *Rāmāyaṇa *\(Yuddhakāṇḍa 128:99–106\). *Rāmarājya*represents the Utopian ideal not merely of good and just governance, but also of the action of *dharma*in sustaining order in the world, where everything in the personal, societal, and natural realms functions in perfect mutual harmony, and in consonance with the order of *r̥ta*. 

45See footnote 562 for clarifiication on Vidyāraṇya’s role as ruler of Vijayanagara. The dates and many particulars pertaining to Hakka and Bukka are unresolved. See page 390. 

46 *Smārta*brāhmaṇas are devoted to the study and preservation of the *smr̥tis *\(the “remembered” corpus\). The *smr̥tis*include the six *Vedāṇgas*, the *Itihāsas*, the *Purāṇas*, the *Dharmaśāstras*, the *S ūtras*, the *Kāvyas*, and the extensive corpus of commentaries. The *śmr̥ti*corpus is regarded as *pauruṣeya*, or of human creation, in contrast with the *śruti*, the “heard” or revealed corpus of ancient Indian oral tradition, seen as *apauruṣeya*, not of human creation. 

The *śrutis*include the *Vēdas*, the *Brāhmaṇas*, the *Āraṇyakas*, and the *Upaniṣads. *

47The metre is *Śārd ūlavikrīditā*. See page 394 for a translation. The suggestion is that the kingdom flourishes because of *mādhava*. There is wordplay here on *mādhava*, which refers to Vidyāraṇya, but also connotes the season of spring. If the word is taken to mean spring, the verse treats the kingdom metaphorically as a tree, which puts out branches, shoots, and flowers, and thrives in the season of spring. If taken to mean Vidyāraṇya, the kingdom flourishes because of his skills in statecraft. A series of metaphors reference the classical

*upekṣaṇamāsanam | abhyuccayo yānam | parārpaṇam saṁśrayam | saṁdhivigrahopādanam* *dvaidhībhāvaḥ|”*The fiirst statement, in light of the second, translates to: “The learned teachers say that the six forms of state policy are are *saṁdhi *\(treaty, or rapprochement\), *vigraha *\(warfare\), *āsana *\(forbearance, or neutrality\), *yāna *\(expedition\), *saṁśraya *\(asylum\), and *dvaidhībhāva *\(sowing dissention\).” 

48The translator has located a manuscript in the hand of Garaḷapurī Śāstri’s son Ayyā Śāstri, giving a genealogy identical to that in this biography. See page 344. The genealogical account that has come down to us lacks dates, but the translator’s analysis suggests that Tammaṇṇa Śāstri was born around 1600 C.E. \(see page 67\). If we reckon 30–40 years per generation, the fiirst of his ministerial ancestors would have been born about 150–200 years before this date, that is, in the early-to-mid 1400s C.E. This date is later than that assigned to Vidyāraṇya, and is consistent with the narrative in the biography, which places this person after Vidyāraṇya’s departure from Ānēgondi. Tammaṇṇa Śāstri’s remote ancestors likely came to Ānēgondi from the Hoysaḷa regions during Vidyāraṇya’s time, and assumed ministerial roles a little later. See footnote 49. 

Chapter Two

Tammaṇṇa Śāstri was a *Smārta*brāhmaṇa of the *Hoysaḷa Karṇāṭaka* sect.49 He was born into the Kāśyapa *gōtra*and belonged to the *Drāh-yāyaṇa*school of the *Sāmavēdic*tradition.50 This distinguished administrator was also a great *Vēdic*scholar. Tammaṇṇa Śāstri had two sons: Śaṇkara Śāstri and Paṭṭābhirāma Śāstri.51 The king held the illustrious Śāstri in high esteem, and relied on his able counsel in all matters. 

The paths of history are indeed tortuous; Vijayanagara now entered a decline as remarkable as its glorious ascent. The strength of the Muslims began growing by the day all over Hindustan. Confiirmation appeared to be at hand of the impermanence of all creation. The Muslims of Haiderābād now cast their cruel sights in Vijayanagara’s direction. Not contented thereby, they besieged Vijayanagara with huge armies.52 How long indeed, could small numbers of Hind ū soldiers, mere water droplets, hold out against the Muslim hordes that surged on like ocean waves? Yet, could these *āryan*offspring ever yield? Each Hind ū hero killed Muslims by the hundred as he won his place in the heaven for heroes. In the end, the Muslims, with their 49See footnotes 46 and 536. The family’s oral history holds, according to Garaḷapurī Śāstri’s great-grandson ṢR̥Śivasvāmi, that Tammaṇṇa Śāstri’s remote ancestors migrated to Ānēgondi from D ōrasamudra, the Hoysaḷa capital, where also they held ministerial positions. 

50 *“kāśyapasagōtrōtpanna”*in the source. The *gōtra*is often taken to be *kāśyapasa*. But by Pāṇini \( *4.1.162*\): *“apatyam pautraprabhr̥ti gotram” *, the grandson’s name defiines the *gōtra*. 

The progenitor *r̥ṣi*Kaśyapa’s grandson being Kāśyapa, the *gōtra*name should be *kāśyapa*, not *kāśyapasa*. Either *“kāśyapa·gōtrō’tpannah.” *, or *“kāśyapa·sagōtrah. *” may have been better. 

51The name appears as Śaṇkarabhaṭṭa, rather than as Śaṇkaraśāstri, in the genealogical manuscript by Ayyā Śāstri. *Śāstri, bhaṭṭa,*and *śarma*are equivalent qualifiiers, all connoting brahminhood. Members of the *Liṇgāyata*or *Vīraśaiva*community do also adopt the qualifiier Śāstri. An excellent example would be Basappa Śāstri \(see footnote 132\). 

52Vijayanagara was destroyed in the aftermath of the Battle of Rakkasa-Taṇgaḍi \(also referred to as Tāḷikōte\), January 26, 1565 C.E. Contemporary writers give various reasons for the defeat, including betrayal by the Gilani brothers, Muslim defectors from ‘Ali ‘Ādil Śāh I, 

who commanded large Vijayanagara forces. The city was sacked by the combined forces of the Deccan Sultanates. In the present account, however, the attackers are specifiically identifiied as Haiderābādī Muslims. The battle being referenced here is almost surely different from Tāḷikōṭe. See pages 367 and 380 for further discussion.

far more numerous armies, were the ones to fiind favour with Jayalakṣmī.53

Vijayanagara fell to the Muslims. They now proceeded to exact vengeance for their many long-standing envies of the Hind ūs. They began to enter and loot every home, directly after having gained the kingdom. Boundless wealth fell into Muslim hands. Many began to flee in the face

*1565/1638*

of this calamity. Cries of distress everywhere\! Dreadful sights everywhere\! Many Hind ū residents, abandoning all they had, 

fled to foreign lands. Nobody knew what became of the king.54

We are drawn to describe the state of mind of Tammaṇṇa Śāstri at this time of anguish. This noble, gentle fiigure remained composed even at the loss of all his material possessions. The Muslims had spared his palm-leaf manuscripts, more precious to him than his own life, thinking them to be kindling, or otherwise worthless. Rejoicing at this, the Śāstri loaded them on to buffaloes, the popular transport of the time, and departed with his family for the province of Anantaśayana.55

En route, he arrived at a town called Ānēkallu, part of Mais ūru, our

realm.56 The local *pāḷeyagāra*was engaged in building a strong fort around this town.57 Astonished at the arrival of Tammaṇṇa Śāstri, who was *1639*

traveling with eight buffaloes, and deeply anguished by his narrative, he conducted the Śāstri with great respect to his home, and 53The godess Lakṣmī has the following eight manifestations, representing various aspects of wealth or well-being: *¯*

*Adi*Lakṣmī \(primæval form\), *Dhana*Lakṣmī \(wealth\), *Dhānya* Lakṣmī \(grain\), *Gaja*Lakṣmī \(sovereignty\), *Santāna*Lakṣmī \(progeny\), *Vīra*Lakṣmī \(valour\), *Jaya*Lakṣmī \(victory\), and *Vidyā*Lakṣmī \(learning\). 

54This reference to the king’s disappearance is meaningful if we grant the erroneous suggestion that this was the battle of Tāḷikōṭe, causing Vijayanagara’s fall in 1565 C.E. \(footnote 52\). Sadāśiva Rāya was nominally king, but his regent *Aḷiya*Rāma Rāya, a distinguished general, held the reins of power, and led the Vijayanagara forces, despite being 80 years old. 

Rāmarāya was captured and beheaded at Tāḷikōṭe, causing the Vijayanagara army’s collapse. 

Rāmarāya’s brother Tirumala is known to have rushed back to Vijayanagara after the battle was lost, and immediately fled to Penukoṇḍa with enormous treasure. See pages 367–374. 

We will see, however, that this was most likely a different battle, fought around 1638 C.E. 

55Anantaśayana is modern-day Tiruvanantapuram, Kerala \[Sircar 1971, p. 92\]. 

56That is, Ānēkallu was part of Maisūru in 1919 C.E., not at Tammaṇṇa Śāstri’s time. 

57See page 344 for the original source of this information. A *pāḷeyagāra *\(or *pāḷyagāra*\) is a tributary chieftain ruling a *pāḷya*, which may vary in size from a hamlet to a large district. 

This allusion to a fort’s construction in Ānēkallu is crucial, and allows us to date Tammaṇṇa

Śāstri’s arrival to after 1638 C.E., much later than Vijayanagara’s fall in 1565 C.E., following the battle of Tāḷikōṭe. See pages 351–362 for a detailed discussion.

urged him to settle in his domain. Unable to decline his entreaties, the Śāstri graciously accepted his gift of ten *vr̥ttis*and a house, and settled down there.58 He lived there contentedly for some time, and passed on into the next world. 

After Tammaṇṇa Śāstri’s passing, his son Śaṇkara Śāstri remained in

Ānēkallu for some time, then moved to Māgaḍi, where he settled down. 

The second son continued in Ānēkallu. Śaṇkara Śāstri had two children, 

Veṇkaṭarāmābhaṭṭa and Tammaṇṇabhaṭṭa by name. Veṇkaṭarāmābhaṭṭa came to the village of Sōsale in the province of Tirumak ūḍalu-Narasīpura, and remained, fiinding support from many families there.59 Veṇkaṭarāmābhaṭṭa’s son was Timmappa Śāstri, whose son Veṇkaṭadāsappa was well known by the name of Sōsale Aṇṇayya Śāstri. 

Even from childhood, Aṇṇayya Śāstri immersed himself in our ancient learning, and after his *upanayana,*devoted himself to *Vēdic*and literary studies. Those times were indeed unlike our own. Each person preserved his own traditions with great solicitude. Even when brāhmaṇas pursued occupations for their livelihoods, they never neglected their daily devotions, even by oversight. The *pañcamahāyajñas*sanctifiied

*Late 1700s–early 1800s. *

the residence of every householder. Our *śāstric*tra-

ditions require every married brāhmaṇa to perform

the *pancamahāyajñas.*The *pancayajñas*are: worship of the *dēvas,*worship of the *r̥ṣis,*compassion for all creatures, rituals for departed ancestors, and solicitude for guests. Knowing these to be important to well-being in both worlds, ancient sages codifiied them as *nitya*rituals, and enjoined their daily performance on all brāhmaṇas.60 Our ancestors performed them with devotion, and ensured the continuance of this tradition.61

58A *vr̥tti *\(“living”\) is a unit of largesse or endowment to a brāhmaṇa, typically comprising land, a home in an *agrahāra,*and means of sustenance, such as a well and cattle. Such grants were crucial to observant brāḥmaṇas, since *Manusmr̥ti*iv, 2–6 permitted them only certain livelihoods. The grant of as many as ten *vr̥ttis*to Tammaṇṇa Śāstri indicates extraordinarily high esteem on the part of the *pāḷeyagāra*. See footnote 240 for the value of *vr̥ttis*in 1821. 

59 Ānēkallu is at 12.7 *◦* N, 77.7 *◦* E, Māgaḍi at 12.97 *◦* N, 77.23 *◦* E, and Sōsale at 12.23 *◦* N, 76.92 *◦* E. 

60These are *nitya*or mandatory daily rituals. We see in *Manusmr̥ti*3 \(69–71\) *: “tāsām* *krameṇa sarvāsām niṣkr̥tyartham maharṣibhiḥ| pañca kl¸ptā mahāyajñāḥpratyaham gr̥ha-medhinām ∥ adhyāpanam brahmayajñaḥpitr̥yajñam tu tarpaṇam | homo daivo balir* *bhauto nr̥yajño atithipūjanam ∥ pañca etān yo mahāyajñān na hāpayati śaktitaḥ| sa gr̥he* *api vasan nityaṁ s ūnādoṣair na lipyate ∥*” 

61See page 324 for an example from the early 20th century of solicitude for guests. Indeed, 

biography of sōsale garaḷapurī śāstri

11

In Aṇṇayya Śāstri’s time, 120 years before the present, brāhmaṇic traditions flourished everywhere in forms tangible and incarnate. As a householder, Aṇṇayya Śāstri rose at dawn each morning, and after bathing and fiinishing his daily rituals, engaged himself in acts of service. He was skilled in practical matters. He founded a large *agrahāra*in Sōsale, which was home to many brāhmaṇas.62 This was known as Aṇṇayya Śāstri’s Agrahāra.63

His home was well attended by servants. Guests were always welcome and well served. He was kindly and generous, always treating everyone as his own. 

*atithi,*the word for guest, literally refers to one who arrives without warning. Well into the 20th century, such hospitality was the norm, and mandatory. See *Yājñavalkyasmr̥ti \(*5.105 *\):*

*“bālasvavāsiṉīvr̥ddhagarbhiṇyāturakanyakā | sambhojyātithibhr̥tyāṁṣca dampatyoḥśeśa-bhojanam ∥”*meaning: “Having fed children, married daughters, the old, the pregnant, the ill, unmarried girls, guests, and servants, the couple may then partake of what remains.” Also see *Yājñavalkyasmr̥ti \(*5.111 *\): “adhvaṉīno’tithijñeyaḥśrotriyo vedapāragaḥ| mānyāvetau* *gr̥hasthasya braḥmalokamabhīpsitah. ∥”*meaning: “Travellers are to be seen as guests. The *śrotrīya*and the one learned in the *Vēdas*are both to be honoured by the householder who wishes to attain the regions of Brahma.” 

62An *agrahāra*is a settlement of brāhmaṇas, usually resulting from a charter or a grant of land. The granting of *agrahāras*is an ancient tradition, as *Mahābhārata*III 65.3 illustrates: *“asmin karmaṇi niṣpanne vijñāte niṣadhādhipe | gavām sahasram dāsyāmi yo vas tāv*

63Aṇṇayya Śāstri’s Agrahāra no longer exists. As of August 2010, only a handful of brāhmaṇa households remained in Sōsale. Apart from three or four *Ayyaṇgār*families, there is the family of Mr V. Narasiṁha M ūrti, the resident priest at the old location of Sōsale’s Vyāsarāya Maṭha, and that of Mr Narendra Bābu, a *Baḍaganāḍu*brāhmaṇa of the Ātreya *gōtra.*Aṇṇayya Śāstri was a *Hoysaḷa Karṇāṭaka*brāhmaṇa of the Kāśyapa *gōtra,*so it appears that none of his male descendents remain in sōsale. Such migrations of brāhmaṇas to larger urban centres in search of opportunities is not unusual. According to the Indian Census of 2011, over 63% of the 7,260 residents of Sōsale were engaged in marginal occupations providing livelihood for at least six months of the year, and 80% were from the Scheduled Castes or Tribes of India.

AṇṇayyaŚāstrihadtwosons,VeṇkaṭarāmāŚāstriandTimmappaŚāstri by name. They were both excellent *Vēdic*scholars and kind-hearted. 

Even from an early age, they were erudite and righteous, and benefiited from the good advice of their parents, always treating them with godlike respect. 

Another son was born to Aṇṇayya Śāstri in the Citrabhānu *saṁvatsara* \(1822 C.E.\).64 This was the renowned Garaḷapurī Śāstri.65 It is from this luminary that we have learned of the positions of high esteem held by his ancestors. This son was the object of special affection on the part of Aṇṇayya Śāstri. Even from the age of three, he called him to his side every *1822*

day, teaching him words from the *Amara Kōśa*,66 as well as grammatical formulæ. Garaḷapurī Śāstri quickly learned everything he was taught. By the age of eight, the Śāstri had already attained profiiciency in poetry, and was ready for more advanced study. He had also completed his *upanayana*by this time.67

Recognizing the brilliance of this child, and wishing to further his learning at the hands of a great scholar, his father and older brother took him to Rāmāśāstri, an eminent scholar in the town of Tirumak ūḍalu. Welcoming them with respect, and learning of their intentions, Rāmāśāstri evaluated the boy, and accepting him with great enthusiasm, said “Let Garaḷapurī remain here, studying while living with us”; Aṇṇayya Śāstri responded: “He will arrive from Sōsale every day for his lessons,” and returned with his son 64This date comes from Garaḷapurī Śāstri’s son Ayyā Śāstri. As the only reliable date in this biography, it is one of our anchors for dating the rest of the genealogy. See the discussion following page 344. 

65The correct form is Garaḷapurīśa, meaning Śiva, the lord of Garaḷapurī, a town better known as Nañjanag ūḍu, and famous for its Śiva temple. The fiinal *śa*of *Garaḷapurīśa* becomes assimilated into the initial syllable of *Śāstri*upon vocalization, and the name is articulated as *Garaḷapurī Śāstri*. *Sandhi*rules require *Garaḷapurīśśāstri*, but the doubled *śa* would be hard to discern in speech. 

66A thesaurus, by Amara Siṁha of the 4th century. It is written in verse in the *Anuṣṭhubh* metre, and comprises 10,000 words arranged in categories. It is traditionally memorized by children. 

67The *upanayana *\(“taking near”\) is the ceremonial initiation of a boy into Brāhminhood, and is a traditional ritual prerequisite to starting one’s formal tutelage under a guru.

to sōsale.68 Aṇṇayya Śāstri possessed the great virtue that while lavish in his generosity and hospitality to all, he did not accept unwarranted favours from others. He paid no heed to the strain of physical exertion. 

*1830*

That he too should adopt and practice this ideal, going back and forth each day between sōsale and Tirumak ūḍalu, was agreeable to Garaḷapurī Śāstri. He never acted against the wishes of his father or brother. 

The idea of going to Tirumak ūḍalu for advanced study with his brother now also occurred to Timmappa Śāstri. Aṇṇayya Śāstri and Veṇkaṭarāmā Śāstri approved of the idea, and bade Timmappa Śāstri do so, feeling that the brothers would be mutually supportive; the two now began to travel back and forth enthusiastically to Tirumak ūḍalu each day. 

The river Kāvērī flows between Sōsale and Tirumak ūḍalu. Tirumakū-ḍalu is a noted place of pilgrimage in the South, akin to Kāśī in the North. 

The temple of Agastyēśvara here is well renowned, just as the temple of Viś-veśvara is in Kāśī. The holy Gaṇgā is ever present in Agastyēśvara’s hair.69

This is a place of pilgrimage of infiinite sanctity and benefiicience. Tirumak ūḍalu is ringed by the Kapilā and Kāvērīrivers. “Tirumakūḍalu” means the confluence of three holy bodies of water. *Saṁskr̥ta*works refer to it as Trimakuṭa or Trimakuṭi. 

Prayāga is the site of the confluence of the Gaṇgā, Yamunā, and Sarasvatī rivers. Here is the site of the confluence of the Kapilā and Kāvērī rivers, and the Sphaṭika lake. The Sphaṭika is invisible to our eyes. A stone pillar stands in the middle of the Kāvērī. This pillar is said to mark the middle of the Sphaṭika lake, which is the region around it. Tradition enjoins us not to question the origins of gods, of rivers, or of *r̥ṣis.*70 Indeed, the *Purāṇas*hold that nobody has apprehended the origins of this lake, and we are obliged to take this as the truth.71 At the site of confluence in Tirumak ūḍalu is a stone staircase. Sitting on these stairs, we may behold the Kapilā flowing to our right and the Kāvērī to our left. Wherever we may sit, the meeting of these great rivers is a thrilling sight. 

68In the traditional *gurukula*system, the student lived with the guru during his education. Garaḷapurī Śāstri would have likely traveled 3–4 km each way to Rāmāśāstri’s house. 

69A hollow atop of the Śiva *liṇga*in the Agastyēśvara temple is said to collect water, an effect that the faithful attribute to the waters of the Gaṇgā, which Śiva is represented as bearing in his hair. 

70See *Garuḍapurāṇa*1.115.57 *: “nadīnāmagnihōtrāṇāṁ bhāratasya kulasya ca | mūlānvēṣō* *na kartavyō m ūlāddoṣēṇa hīyate ∥” *

71The possibility of the Kāvērī having subsumed a lake in early times is an obvious one.

sons of sarasvatī

Casting our sights on the banks of the Kapilā, we behold the Guñjā-narasimhasvāmi temple. If we extend our gaze farther along the bank, we perceive a *ghāt..*This is called the Jñānavāpī Tīrtha. At the edge of this *ghāt.*is the temple of Anādi Mūlasthāneśvara. If we cross the stream and proceed to Narasīpura, we may visit the deities of Narasiṁhasvāmi and M ūlasthāneśvara. Our eyes and hearts long for more, no matter how long we remain at this *saṇgama.*If we now tear ourselves away, and ascend the steps, we behold a giant *aśvattha*tree. All around this *aśvattha*tree are consecrated innumerable *nāgaśilas.*72 Upon circumambulating this *aśvattha* tree and proceeding further, our eyes are gratifiied by an image of Agastyēśvara with P ūrṇamaṇgaḷa Kāmākṣi. 

This town is thick with the residences of *śrōtri*brāhmaṇas.73 The *Purā-ṇas*hold this place as no less than Kailāsa on earth, with its fiive *liṇgas*Sōmēśvara, Hanumantēśvara, Pātāḷēśvara, Agastyēśvara, and Mūlasthānēśvara, representing the fiive aspects of Īśvara. This is regarded as an important place of pilgrimage in our country of Mais ūru.74 One may reach this place by an overnight journey by cart from Mais ūru. The distance between Mais ūru and here is eighteen miles. 

Rāmāśāstri lived here, a pure *vaidika*brāhmaṇa, ever observant of tradition, and ever engaged in worship and devotion.75 His scholarship in litera-72The *aśvattha*tree is *Ficus religiosa*, sometimes called the *pippala *\(peepal\) tree. It holds great religious signifiicance. *Nāgaśilās*are granite plaques with carved images of the snake god *Nāgēśvara,*and are quite commonly seen in South India. 

73 *Śrōtris \(śrōtrīyas\)*are especially profiicient *vaidika*scholars \(see footnote 75\), devoted to preserving *śrutis,*the “heard” texts, traditionally transmitted only orally. The following verse from Śaṇkara’s commentary on Kālidāsa’s *Śākuntala*shows the high regard *śrōtrīyas* command: *“janmanā brāhmaṇo jñeyaḥsaṁskārair dvija ucyate | vidyayā yāti vipratvam* *tribhiḥśrotrīya ucyate ∥” *\(By birth is derived the status of brāhmaṇa, by sacrament that of the twice-born. By learning comes the status of *vipra*, and by all three that of *śrōtrīya*.\) 74Maisūru was still a kingdom in 1919 C.E., with the city of Maisūru as its capital. This kingdom formed the basis for the state of Karnāṭaka, which was called Mysore till 1973 C.E. 

75In contrast to *laukika *\(worldly\) brāhmaṇas, *vaidika*brāhmaṇas devoted themselves to *Vēdic*studies and traditional learning, eschewing other more lucrative occupations. See, for instance, Bhandarkar \[1933\]: “. . . But a more important class of *Bhikṣukas*are *Vaidikas*, some of whom are *Yājñikas*as well. Learning the *Vedas*by heart, and repeating them in a manner never to make a single mistake, even in the accents, is the occupation of their life. The best *R.gvedi Vaidika*knows by heart the *Saṁhitā, Pada, Krama, Jaṭā*, and *Ghana*of the hymns or *Mantra*portion of the *Veda*, and the *Aitareya Brāhmaṇa*and *Āraṇyaka*; the *Kalpa*and *Gr̥hya Sūtra*of the *Āśvalāyana*, the *Nighaṇṭu, Nirukta, Chandas, Jyotis. *, and *Śikṣa*, and Pāṇini’s *Aṣṭādhyāyī*on grammar. A *Vaidika*is thus a living *Vedic*library...” It should be no surprise that *Vaidikas*are especially respected. See the episode recounted on page 323.

ture and grammar was unequalled. GaraḷapurīŚāstri now began his tutelage under him. A proverb says “The tender shoot foreshadows the full-grown crop”;76 delighting in the brilliance of Garaḷapurī Śāstri, Rāmāśāstri was content that his great learning had found fulfiillment in the instruction of a student of such merit. 

The flow in the river being greatly diminished between the months of Mārgaśira and Vaiśakha, Garaḷapurī Śāstri and Timmappa Śāstri waded through it each day en route to Tirumak ūḍalu.77 When the river was in flood, they would cross it by boat, returning to Sōsale after their lessons.78

76This is a literal translation. This proverb has equivalents in many Indian languages, but there appears to be none in English. 

77The shallow Kāvērī crossing at Sōsale has played a pivotal role in shaping the history of Mais ūru, through events that Aṇṇayya Śāstri is sure to have witnessed. In its advance on Śrīraṇgapaṭṭaṇa during the Fourth Mysore War, the campaign that led to T.ippu Sultān’s death, the British army under Major General George Harris abruptly turned south after an engagement with T.ippu’s troops at Maḷavaḷḷi, and forded the Kāvērī at Sōsale on March 30, 1799 C.E., in a manœuvre that outflanked the Sultān’s forces, which were deployed in anticipation of a crossing at Arakere. Intending to use Sōsale as a supply depot, T.ippu had stock-piled vast stocks of provisions at the village, which all fell into British hands. A ruined brick hut, which the locals attribute to T.ippu, still stands on the Kāvērī’s banks directly to the west of sōsale. The river was about three feet deep and three hundred yards wide at the Sōsale crossing \[Groves 1887, Hook 1832\], and the place had 15,000 head of cattle and large stocks of fodder and grain, which the British commandeered. The attacking forces, the largest British army ever assembled in India, must have presented quite a spectacle at sōsale, consisting of 15,076 infantry, 2635 cavalry, 608 gunners, 104 pieces of artillery, joined by 10,157 infantry and 6000 horse belonging to the *Nizām *\[Murray 1853\]. The supply train included 60,000

oxen, carrying suffiicient supplies for several monthṣsōsale’s economy must have been devastated by the passage of such a large force, since the British armies tended to preserve their supplies, living off the land in their conquest of South India. Nonetheless, Sōsale benefiited greatly from T.ippu’s miscalculation. Had he expected the Sōsale crossing, he would have devastated the surrounding countryside to deny the British forage and shelter, as he did the countryside between Maḷavaḷḷi and the expected crossing near Arakere. Every dwelling there was torched, and not a blade of grass left intact. The supplies secured at Sōsale were vital to the British success, since the march was rigorous and the cattle, used as draft and pack animals, were driven mercilessly. In fact, the assault on Śrīraṇgapaṭṭaṇa was forced on May 4

by impending starvation in the British camp, and the death of almost all its cattle \[Dundas 1800, p. 279\]. 

78Coracles, called *teppas*in Kannaḍa, are widely used for crossing rivers and streams in the region. *Teppas*are circular baskets of bamboo and reed, measuring 5–8 feet in diameter and often covered on the outside with hide and tar. They are propelled and steered with a single paddle, and accommodate about six passengers. Steel *teppas*are now commonly used for transportation, since these accommodate up to a dozen people \(or goods\), and are more robust to bottom scraping in shallow water. Bamboo *teppas*are still used by fiishermen, being cheaper, lighter, and more manœuvrable.

The rain, wind, cold, or the sun would frequently be cruel and merciless, but they continued their studies with dedication and enthusiasm, heedless of these discomforts, recognizing that the cycle of the seasons followed the patterns of Nature. 

By the age of sixteen, Garaḷapurī Śāstri had attained profiiciency in the subjects of *campū,*79 dramaturgy, poetics,80 and grammar. Upon hearing of Garaḷapurī Śāstri’s scholarly achievements, his great virtues, and his *śrōtric* heritage, Veṇkaṭasubbayya of Hulluhaḷḷi81 in Nañjanagūḍu district *1838*

approached Aṇṇayya Śāstri with a proposal for marriage with his eight-year-old daughter Subbamma.82 Veṇkaṭasubbayya’s also being an illustrious heritage, this alliance met with mutual approval. Garaḷapurī Śāstri accepted the duties of a householder at an auspicious time. 

Aṇṇayya Śāstri had a son before Garaḷapurī Śāstri, whom everyone called Rāmappa. Having an unusually sluggish intellect, he had been unreceptive to learning as a child. The father and older brothers had made great efforts to ensure an education for this brother, but had remained unsuccessful. They were fiinally resigned for this to remain his fate in this birth. 

Though Rāmappa was not learned, he was extremely virtuous. Everyone had great compassion for him. In his case too, Aṇṇayya Śāstri ensured the timely completion of all such rituals as *upanayana*and marriage. 

79A complex literary form, which treats a subject in both rhythmic prose and poetry. 

80The word used is *alaṇkāra*, which literally means tropology. As will become clear shortly, he was also a profiicient poet. 

81This name appears inconsistently as Veṇkaṭarāmayya in subsequent references. 

82Subbamma, eight years Garaḷapurī Śāstri’s junior, must have been born in 1830 C.E. 

Chapter Four

GaraḷapuriŚāstriremainedinSōsaleafterhismarriage. Atthetime, Sōsale too, was home to great scholars. The grand *maṭha*of the great *Mādhva*guru Vyāsarāyasvāmi is in Sōsale.83 Many scholars were attached to this *maṭha.*Among them was the great scholar Tammayyācārya.84 This stalwart possessed a deep mastery of logic. Wishing to study logic with him, Garaḷapurī Śāstri ventured to approach Tammayyācārya to make his wishes known. The *¯*

*Acārya*accepted him gladly. Applying himself assiduously to the study of logic, the Śāstri attained great profiiciency in this fiield as well.85

83This *maṭha,*originally called the Pūrvādi Maṭha, is named after *Śrī*Vyāsarāya \(1460–

1539 C.E.\), who became its head in 1476 C.E. This *Mādhva*saint was guru to Vijayanagara kings such as Kr̥ṣṇadēvarāya, and is often held as being second only to Madhvācārya, the founder of the *Dvaita*branch of *Vēdantic*philosophy. The poet-composers Purandaradāsa and Kanakadāsa were his students. After being damaged by the Kāvērī floods of 1924 C.E., this *maṭha*was relocated to Vyāsarājapura, just north of Sōsale, and again in 1981 C.E. to a new site at the *saṇgama*in Tirumak ūḍalu, next to the temple of Agastyēśvara. Thereafter, the old *maṭha*location remained shuttered for many years, but was reopened in 2008, with Mr V. Narasiṁha M ūrti of Baḷḷāri as its resident priest. Activity at this location was limited at the time, but it remained accessible to visiting devotees. 

84The records of the Parakāla Maṭha in Maisūru indicate that Tammayyācārya of Sōsale’s Vyāsarāya Maṭha welcomed *Śrī*Śrīnivāsa Parakālasvāmi with *kāṇikas,*fruit trays, and shawls upon the *Svāmi’s*return on May 24, 1859 C.E. from a trip away from Mais ūru, and that he received *phalamantrākṣate*from the *Svāmi *\[Desikāchārya 1949, p. cxxxvii\]. Garaḷapurī Śāstri appears to have moved to Mais ūru around this time, and may have been by his guru’s side on this occasion. 

85According to the information on page 336, it appears that Garaḷapurī Śāstri also taught logic to his students. A *Dēvanāgari*manuscript the translator has discovered in Kavitāvilāsa is an extensive *krōḍapatra *\(scholium\) on the *Sāmānyanirukti*, a treatise on *Navya Nyāya* logic by the well-known Gadādhara Bhaṭṭācārya. The colophon credits it to a Śrīpurīśa in the *saṁvatsara Krōdhin*, or 1844 C.E., when Garaḷapurī Śāstri would have been 22 years old. We can be confiident that this Śrīpurīśa is none other than Garaḷapurī Śāstri from the fiinal colophon in his *Kr̥ṣṇabhūpāḻīyam: “iti śrīpurīśakr̥tau kr̥ṣṇabhūpāḻīye alaṇkāraśāstre* *śabdālaṇkāra prakaraṇaṁ saṁpūrṇaṁ” *. His profiiciency in *Navya Nyāya*is clearly evident in his defiinition of *alaṇkāra*in his *Kr̥ṣṇabhūpāliyam: “. . . śabdārthacārutvātiśayahētutvam* *ca śabdārthānyataraniṣṭhā yā viṣayitāsaṁba ˙ndhāvacchinnā camatkr̥tijanakatā tadavacchēdakatvam” *. This technical and precise defiinition uses a cascade of formal constructions and technical concepts from *Navya Nyāya*, such as *hētutvam*, *viṣayitā*, *avacchinna*, and *avacchedakatvam*. The use of *Navya Nyāya*concepts in defiining *alaṇkāras*was pioneered by the well-known Jagannātha Paṇḍita in works such as the *Rasagaṇgādhara*. The *Kr̥ṣṇabhū-pāḻīyam*follows Appayya Dīkṣita’s treatment of *alaṇkāras*, but Garaḷapurī Śāstri was clearly familiar with the work of Dīkṣita’s rival Jagannātha.

Timmappa Śāstri had trained, with his brother, to the extent of dramaturgy under Rāmāśāstri, but no further in literary fiields. Nonetheless, like his brother, he was accomplished in literature, and tutored many students in his home. 

Garaḷapurī Śāstri had a natural and innate talent for poetry. This is not an ability that can be taught. Following the example of his illustrious guru Rāmāśāstri, an exceptional poet, who would frequently compose exquisite verses on Agastyēśvara and other deities, he too would often compose splendid *ślokas*on various topics. Shortly after his marriage, according to an anecdote of his childhood that has survived, his father-in-law Hulluhaḷḷi Veṇkaṭarāmayya,86 reciting the following *ślōka*in praise of Rāma87

*vāme bh ūmi·sutā puraś’ca hanumān paścāt sumitrā·sutah. *

*śatrughno bharataś’ca pārśva·daḷayor vāyvādi·koṇeṣu ca |*

*sugrīvaś’ca vibhīṣaṇaś’ca yuvarāṭtārā·suto jāmbavān* *madhye ṉīla·saroja·komala·ruciṁ rāmaṁ bhaje śyāmalam ∥*

before his household deity, asked: “Garaḷapurī, what do you think of this *ślōka?*Do you happen to know it?” The Śāstri, listening with great respect and devotion, answered that it was a mere prayer *ślōka.*His father-in-law then asked: “Could you compose a similar *ślōka*on Īśvara?”88 Rising to the challenge, the Śāstri promptly composed the *ślōka* 89

*vāmāṇke girijā puras’tricaraṇaḥpaścāc.’ca nandīśvarō* *herambaś’ca guhaś’ca pārśva·dalayōr vāyvādi·koṇeṣu ca |*

*caṇḍīśo’pi ca bhairavas’savinayo bāṇas’tathā rāvaṇah. *

*tan’madhye sphuṭa·puṇḍārīka·ruciraṁ śrī·ṉīlakaṇṭhaṁ bhaje ∥*

86This name appeared inconsistently as Hulluhaḷḷi Veṇkaṭasubbayya on page 16. 

87This is a well-known *ślōka*in the *Śārd ūlavikrīditā*metre. Many South Indian household shrines include paintings or pictures depicting deities surrounded in this fashion by attendants and devotees. The image described in this *ślōka*is a common image, and generally referred to as *Śrīrāma paṭṭābhiṣēkaṁ*, or Śrīrāma’s coronation. The imagery reflects the description of Rāma’s coronation in the *Yuddhakāṇḍa:128*of the *Rāmāyaṇa.*See page 394

for a translation. 

88Given the imagery in the *ślōka*, the challenge was likely not simply to compose any Śiva *ślōka*similar to the Rāma *ślōka,*but to compose one describing an image of Īśvara in Hulluhaḷḷi Veṇkaṭarāmayya’s household shrine. 

89See page 395 for a translation.

Overjoyed at hearing this, Veṇkaṭarāmayya declared, “Garaḷapurī, you are destined for great fame\!” to which the Śāstri respectfully responded, “These are merely the fruits of your blessings.”90 The poetic muse had favored him even as a student. The meaning of the saying *“kavitā vanitā caiva* *svayamēvāgatā varā”*91 was exemplifiied in him. His poetic abilities were well known to his fellow-students, but not to either Tammayyācārya or the *Śrī* *Svāmi*.92 These came to light through a remarkable episode. 

A scholar of ordinary merit and without poetic talent once arrived in Sōsale from elsewhere, craving to be rewarded for a *ślōka*of his own composition, though it lacked integrity of meaning or structure. He met the *Śrī Svāmi*with the help of offiicials from the Maṭha. Upon his indicating that he had composed poetry, which he would gladly present at the *Svāmi’s* behest, the *Svāmi*arranged for a large audience.93 The poem was recited. In the audience that day were Tammayyācārya, his student Garaḷapurī Śāstri, as well as many other scholars. Out of politeness, and a sense that criticism would amount to rudeness, everyone was content to merely acknowledge the work. Sensing this, the *Śrī Svāmi*remained silent, and respecting all mutual courtesies between scholars, saw off the scholar with proper deference. 

Garaḷapurī Śāstri, who was in the audience, was greatly saddened at the lack of criticism of a work so shoddy and lacking in poetic merit. He sat silently, however, out of regard for his guru Tammayyācārya, not wanting to anger him. The sadness, however, remained with him, even after he returned home and went to bed. He did not sleep well. Rising before dawn the next morning, he went to the river for his ablutions. A stone *maṇṭapa*stands en route to the river from the Maṭha.94 While returning 90The traditional response to a compliment from an elder. 

91“Of maidens and verses, they alone are most excellent, who come of their own accord.” 

A couplet expressing a similar sentiment says: *“kavitā vanitā caiva svayātā rasadāyiṉī |*

*balādākr̥ṣyamāṇā cet sarasā nirasā bhavet ∥” *

92The honorifiic title of the head of the Vyāsarāyasvāmi Maṭha. *Srī*Vidyāpūrṇa Tīrtha was the head of this *maṭha*1824–1872 C.E. These events date to 1842 C.E. See footnote 98. 

93Footnote in original: “These verses do not appear here, having been lost. Likewise, many poems of Garaḷapurī Śāstri’s childhood have been lost with him.” 

94 *Maṇṭapa*is the Kannaḍa form of *maṇḍapa*, a ceremonial pavilion or structure. The *maṇṭapa*referenced here no longer exists. Mr V. Narasiṁha Mūrti, resident priest at the Sōsale *maṭha*in 2010 C.E., was aware of a *maṇṭapa*gurus had used for meditation in the past.

from the river, he wrote the following *ślōka*on the walls of the *maṇṭapa*in Dēvanāgari script, reflecting the sadness within him.95

*anāghrāta·vyaṇgyair aparicita·śabdārtha·racanair*

*abuddhā’laṇkārair’anavagata·bhāvojjvala·rasaiḥ|*

*yaśo·mātr’āṇk ūrān’nava·nava·durāśaiḥkukavibhih. *

*duradhvē vyākr̥ṣṭā bhagavati vipannāsi kavitē ∥*

The meaning of this *ślōka*is as follows: O beautiful muse of poetry, how tragically have you been drawn down the path of ruin by base poets, who are unacquainted with *vyaṇgya*, unskilled in poetic composition, and ignorant of poetic tropes and devices\!96

95The metre is *Śikhariṇī*. See page 395 for a translation. 

96 *Vyaṇgya*is the poetic device where subtle meaning is revealed through suggestion, inference, or implication in context, rather than from the overt meanings of the words. Poetic meaning can be construed at three levels: *vācyārtha, lakṣyārtha*, and the *vyaṇgyārtha*, corresponding to the word-meaning, metaphorical meaning, and suggested meaning. Effective use of *vyaṇgya*requires great subtlety, and represents the highest form of accomplishment in Indian poetics. Consider the following verse from Kālidāsa \( *Kumārasambhava,*6:84\) *:* *evaṁ vādini devarṣau pārśve pituradhomukhī | ḻīlākamalapatrāṇi gaṇayāmāsa pārvatī ∥,* which translates to “As the divine sage \(Aṇgīrasa\) spoke thus, Pārvatī, by her father’s \(Him-

ālaya’s\) side, lowered her gaze and began counting the petals of the lotus she was playing with.” Aṇgīrasa has just asked Himālaya to give his daughter Pārvatī in marriage to Śiva. 

Kālidāsa paints a picture of a bashful but willing Pārvatī, without ever explicitly using words suggesting these sentiments. *Vyaṇgya*can operate in very subtle ways in the hands of an accomplished master. Consider, for example, Kālidāsa’s invocation of Śiva and Pārvatī in the justly celebrated fiirst verse of his *Raghuvaṁśa*: *vāgarthāviva saṁpr̥ktau vāgarthapratipattaye |*

*jagataḥpitarau vande pārvatīparameśvarau ∥*

Kālidāsa never explicitly mentions the conjoined *Ardhanārīśvara*form of Śiva and Pārvatī, but readily reveals his intention by using the word *saṁpraktau *\(commingled\) to describe the pair. Having thus prepared the reader’s mind, he deploys such an astonishing variety of subtle grammatical, philosophical, and poetical devices to reinforce this image as to leave one breathless. Thus, at the grammatical level, Kālidāsa is implicitly invoking the *vārttika “ivena* *nityasamāso vibhaktyalopaḥpurvapadaprakr̥tisvaratvaṁ ca” *, which declares *vāgarthāviva* \(“as are word and meaning”\) to be a *nityasamāsa*or inseparable compound, which we cannot separate into *vāk *\(word\) \+ *artha *\(meaning\) \+ *iva *\(as are\), though these components are clearly apparent. This evokes the inseparability of the couple in their *Ardhanārīśvara*form. 

In his commentary, Mallinātha takes note of an even subtler evocation of this inseparability at the semantic level, through the *vārttika “siddhe śabdārtha sambandhe” *\(“eternal are word, meaning, and their relationship”\), the very fiirst commented upon by Patañjali in his

biography of sōsale garaḷapurī śāstri

The Śāstri returned home after having written this *ślōka.*Now, it was the *Śrī Svāmi’s*practice to perform *japa*at this *maṇṭapa*after bathing in the river each morning.97 When the *Svāmi*arrived at the *manṭapa*as usual for his *japa,*his eyes fell upon the *ślōka*written on the wall. When the *Svāmi*read it, he wondered who could have composed a *ślōka*of such del-icacy, surmising that it had to be the work of some great poet from times past. While the other scholars accompanying the *Svāmi*were tending to the same opinion upon reading it, the *Svāmi*called out to Tammayyācārya, and asked, “ *¯*

*Acārya,*where is the *ślōka*on the wall from?” A number of Garaḷapurī Śāstri’s fellow-students, who were around, now suggested to the *Svāmi* that this was very likely to have been the work of Garaḷapurī Śāstri. At this, the *Svāmi*and Tammayyācārya, summoning Garaḷapurī Śāstri, asked him “Garaḷapurī, do tell us, who from the *maṭha*is likely to have composed this *ślōka*?”. The Śāstri, unwilling to speak anything but the full truth in the presence of his guru, acknowledged that he had composed *1842*

and written the *ślōka,*and explained his reasons. The *Svāmi*and the scholars present were full of praise for his abilities. The *Svāmi* blessed the Śāstri, saying “Śāstri, you will go on to be a great poet; this is truly the result of divine favour.” Such was the extraordinary extent of the Śāstri’s accomplishments, even by the age of twenty.98

GaraḷapurīŚāstri knew all fiive of the Nāgara, Dēvanāgara, Grantha, Telugu, and Kannaḍa scripts. He could write in an elegant hand in each of these scripts, and used them all as he wrote in his books.99

When Aṇṇayya Śāstri passed on, his sons completed his last rites, and divided their paternal property amongst themselves. Since the youngest brother Rāmappa was the least intellectually accomplished, the three eldest brothers gave him the largest share. 

*Mahābhāṣya*. Similarly, *pitarau *\( *mātā ca pitā ca pitarau*\) is an *ekaśeṣa dvandva*compound, in which only *pitā*remains when *mātā*and *pitā*are compounded, again evoking the oneness of the conjoined form. And so on. This is *vyaṇgya*, indeed, for the profoundly erudite.

spective lands, living on different sides of the courtyard of the large house in Sōsale they had divided between themselves. Veṇkaṭarāmāśāstri, the eldest, having always had a knack for practical affairs, enjoyed the confiidence of people in surrounding villages, and was frequently called upon to adjudicate various matters arising between them. As head of the joint family, he made his residence in the great hall upstairs in the Sōsale house, and continued looking after his lands. 

Now, when his father-in-law Giribhaṭṭa, royal *r̥tvik*at the Palace,100 impressed by his great skill in practical matters, appointed him head of his *jōḍi* village of Duddagere,101 he brought about great improvements in this village, and receiving particular assistance and resources from his father-in-law, built a large house just north of the temple of Gargēśvara Svāmi.102 This house still stands. 

In the month of Māgha each year, as a mark of deep devotion, his father Aṇṇayya Śāstri conducted a generous *santarpaṇa*for a thousand brāhmaṇas and a thousand of their womenfolk, in a grove near the river in Sōsale.103

It was quite diffiicult to accommodate so many brahmaṇas and their womenfolk in the village in a single day.104 Arrangements had therefore been made for brahmaṇas and their wives to arrive from various places, such as Tirumak ūḍalu and Narasīpura, on different days. Brahmaṇas and their wives would continue to arrive from all over, for as many as fiive or six days, 100Offiiciating priest at *Vēdic*rituals. It is unclear who this Giribhaṭṭa is. A reference to the work *Saṁskāra Kaumudi*by a Giribhaṭṭa appears in Pandey \[1998, p. 288\] without a date or publisher. 

101Duddagere is about 16 km east of Maisūru. A *jōḍi*village is a freehold or leasehold grant by royal decree, obligating the recipient only to some nominal taxes. The types of *inām*land grants in Kr̥ṣṇarāja Voḍeyar III’s reign were *sarvamānya, ardhamānya, jōḍi grāma, jōḍi* *agrahāra, bhaṭamānya, dēvādāya, dharmādāya, koḍagi inām*, and *kere bandi *\[Rice 1877a, pp. 686–691\]. See George \[1970\] for a discussion of the land revenue system in Mais ūru. 

102The temple referenced appears to be in the village of Gargēśvarī, not in Duddagere. 

103See page 326 for a fiirst-hand account of a *santarpaṇa *\(literally “satiating”\) from the early 1900s. An *anna santarpaṇa*such as this was supposed to accrue great merit. 

104In 1876 C.E., Sōsale had 536 houses and 2,716 people, Narasīpura had 82 houses and 444

people \(Tirumakuḍalu-Narasīpura had 1,650 people in 1891 C.E.\), Hulluhaḷḷi had a population of 1,277, and Mais ūru itself had 11,618 houses with 57,815 people \[Rice 1877b\].

until their count reached a thousand. Many relatives of theirs would come along as well. Cooks and servants were not readily available in those times. 

Family members and relatives helped out, participating enthusiastically in cooking and other such activities. As a result, the *santarpaṇas*proceeded with grandeur. Well pleased, brahmaṇas from the neighbouring villages and their wives bestowed their blessings on Aṇṇayya Śāstri’s household.105

After Aṇṇayya Śāstri’s time, Veṇkaṭarāmāśāstri continued this tradition with great devotion. Since the country was prosperous in those times, the essentials for *santarpaṇas,*such as grain, flowers, fruit, milk, yoghurt, ghee, and vegetables were readily and cheaply available; it was also usual for the residents of one village to send such essentials to the residents of another village, when the need arose. Consequently, *santarpaṇas*proceeded with great splendour. 

From time to time, Garaḷapurī Śāstri accompanied his guru Tammayyā-cārya, *paṇḍita*at the court, on his trips to Maisūru to see His Highness regarding matters concerning the *maṭha.*On one such occasion, Tammayyā-cārya took his student Garaḷapurī Śāstri to the court with him.106 His Highness always treated Tammayyācārya, great scholar that he was, with enormous respect. Such pillars of scholarship as Dādāśāstri,107 Rāmaśēṣāśāstri,108

Kavi Varadācārya, Sajjayyācārya, Kuṇigala Rāmaśāstri, *Vyākaraṇa*Narasiṁhaśāstri, Kāśī Timmaṇṇācārya,109 and Kumbhakōṇa Śēṣācārya110 graced the court. Garaḷapurī Śāstri decided to move to Maisūru upon witnessing this 105See footnote 276. The *āśīrvāda*or blessing is an essential and integral component of any ritual, and occurs at the end. 

106See footnote 84. 

107From the Kannaḍa caption in the painting shown in Plate 25b, it appears that Dādāśāstri was in fact none other than Tryambakaśāstri, who fiigures prominently in Kuṇigala Rāmaśāstri’s biography. 

108It has been argued \[in Lakshminarasimhaiya *et al.,*1970, p. 140\] that the Rāmaśēṣā-śāstri appearing in ṀṢPuṭṭaṇṇa’s biography of Kuṇigala Rāmaśāstri should be identifiied with Kaśi Śēṣa Śāstri. These authors also note \[on p. 22\] that Kaśi Śēṣa Śāstri established a school of *Saṁskr̥ta*grammar in Maisūru, and list a number of famous scholars of the time, who are claimed to have become eminent professors under his “guidance”. This list, however, is excessively broad, and includes several great scholars, such as Garaḷapurī Śāstri and Kumbhakōṇa Śēṣācārya, who defiinitely *were not*his students. \(See footnote 110.\) This erroneous information has been reproduced, as by Naidu \[1996\]. In fact, when Śēṣa Śāstri died on April 26, 1860 C.E., Garaḷapurī Śāstri, himself a mature thirty-eight, had likely just moved to Mais ūru. See page 179 for an illustration of Rāmaśeṣaśāstri’s prodigious intellect. 

109See footnote 594.

constellation of scholars, the great regard they were held in by His Highness, and the grandeur of the capital city, and with support from Kempu Rāmāśāstri, who was his sister’s father-in-law and physician at the court, he moved with his family from Sōsale to Mais ūru, and took

*1859*

up temporary residence in Kempu Rāmāśāstri’s home.111

The

Śāstri’s brother-in-law Subbaṇṇa was studying medicine at this time. Kempu Rāmāpaṇḍita, who later became principal of the Maisūru

Āyurvēdic College, was none other than his son.112 Kempu Rāmāśāstri arranged to have his eldest son Subbaṇṇa receive instruction from Garaḷapurī Śāstri on the *Vāgbhaṭa,*a book on medicine.113

Śāstri’s son *Kavitilaka*Ayyā Śāstri. In December 2010, the translator had the great privilege of meeting Śēṣācārya’s grandson, Kaulagi Śēṣācārya, then a hundred years of age, living at 5/1 Sītāvilāsa Road, opposite Marimallappa’s Junior College. Despite his advanced age, he remained astonishingly robust, and in full possession of his mental faculties. Not only was he able to recount his various memories of Ayyā Śāstri from over eighty years past, he instantly remembered all of Ayyā Śāstri’s children in birth order. He also correctly pointed out that the name was properly “Ayya” Śāstri, not “Ayyā” Śāstri, as it is pronounced by Ayya Śāstri’s surviving relatives. The present work uses the form “Ayyā” Śāstri, so this pronounci-ation was clearly acceptable to Ayyā Śāstri himself, although it appears as “Ayya” in his own works. Kaulagi Śēṣācārya also strongly refuted the claim \[in Lakshminarasimhaiya *et al.,* 1970\] that his grandfather Kumbhak ōṇa Śēṣācārya had been one of Kāśī Śēṣa Śāstri’s students. Incidentally, the “Kumbhakōṇa” in his name can mislead. Śēṣācārya’s ancestors were in fact Marāṭhi-speaking immigrants. The family still speaks an archaic form of the language. 

Regrettably, Kaulagi Śēṣācārya passed away in 2011. 

111No date is given for Garaḷapurī Śāstri’s move to Maisūru. However, a biography of Garaḷapurī Śāstri’s son Ayyā Śāstri \(b. 1855 C.E.\) written by his son Kr̥ṣṇasvāmi Śāstri \(see page 335\) indicates that Ayyā Śāstri moved to Mais ūru with his father and his family at the age of about six or seven. This account places the year of his move to around 1861–1862

C.E. Among Ayyā Śāstri’s papers, the translator found an anonymous manuscript biography

\[Sāstri 2012\], likely also to have been by this biography’s author, of Perīsvāmi Tirumalācārya \(b. 1847 C.E.\), which states that he was 12 when he became Garaḷapurī Śāstri’s student, placing Garaḷapurī Śāstri in Maisūru by 1859 C.E. Perhaps Garaḷapurī Śāstri moved to Maisūru fiirst, and his family followed a few years later.

The father of this Kempu Rāmāśāstri was Kempu Śāstri, also known as Kempu Nārāyaṇakavi, the author of the *Mudrāmañj ūṣa,*114 a Kannaḍa literary work. After some time, GaraḷapurīŚāstri decided to move into a house of his own, and made his intentions known to Kānkānhaḷḷi Subr-

*> 1864*

ahmaṇyācārya,115 *paurāṇika*at the royal court, who lived in the *vaṭhāra*of *Vīṇe*Veṇkaṭasubbayya’s house,116 close to Kempu Rāmāśāstri’s home in Mais ūru’s Old Agrahāra, and to his younger brother Guṇḍācārya. These brothers approached *Vīṇe*Veṇkaṭasubbayya’s son *Vīṇe* Śēṣaṇṇa, *Vīṇā Bakṣi*at the court, who then arranged to have Garaḷapurī Śāstri occupy a house that had become vacant in the *vaṭhāra*where he himself resided.117 It was generally not the practice at that time to charge rent. 

Garaḷapurī Śāstri and his family lived contentedly in this house, which, by being used here as a metonym. GaraḷapurīŚāstri, though not trained in medicine, clearly had the scholarship in *Saṁskr̥ta*to interpret the text. Indian scientifiic treatises were generally written in poetry or as terse aphorisms, requiring facility in *Saṁskr̥ta*. The *Aṣṭāṇgahr̥daya* and *Aṣṭāṇgasaṁhitā \(Vāgbhaṭa\)*are attributed to Vāgbhaṭa. Caraka, Suśruta, and Vāgbhaṭa were the three classical writers on Āyurvēda. 

114This landmark work of Kannaḍa literature dates to 1823 C.E., and is based on a study of Viśākhadatta’s *Mudrārākṣasa *\(a play of the 9th century C.E. on Candragupta Maurya\), the *Mudrārākṣasa Kathā*by Mahādēva Tirtha and *Mudrārākṣasa Kathāsāra*by Ravikartana \(both 16th century C.E.\). Professor ṬV. Venkatachala Sastry has prepared a modern critical edition of this work \[Śāstri 1999\]. 

115Kānkānhaḷḷi Subrahmaṇyācārya was the father of the celebrated vocalist Mysore Vāsudevācārya \(1865–1961 C.E.\), to whom we owe *Nā Kaṇḍa Kalāvidaru*, a treasury of fiirst-hand accounts of musicians of the period \[Vasudevacārya 1994\]. In childhood, Vāsudēvācārya would have known Garaḷapurī Śāstri. See footnote 118. 

116A *vaṭhāra*is a community of families living in a cluster of houses within a walled enclosure. *Vīṇe*Veṇkaṭasubbayya \(1750–1838 C.E.\) was a well-known *vīṇā*player who wielded enormous political influence. See Plate 18a. Contemporary British accounts pillory him as a corrupt offiicial who was *qāzi*at the court when Liṇga Raj Arasu \(not *Aḷiya*Liṇgarajē Arasu\) was *Dīvān,*and who was even convicted of corruption \[Gopal 1993\]. Veṇkaṭasubbayya’s residence was a palatial mansion within the Mais ūru fort, protected by seven guards with swords drawn \[Vasudevacārya 1994, p. 6\]. The house referred to here was clearly among his other properties. 

117 *Bakṣi *\(properly *baḳhśi*, from the Persian *baḳhśidan*, “to bestow”, but often encountered as the droll variant *bhakṣi*, related to *bhakṣa*, “to consume”\) was a title derived from Mughal administration, where it referred to an executive position, including the function of paymaster. In Mais ūru of the time, however, it was an honorary administrative title given to heads of departments at the Palace, with status equivalent to that of Assistant Commissioners in the State Government \[Ikegame 2007, p. 24\]. The Śēṣaṇṇa referred to would be *Doḍḍa *\(the elder\) *Vīṇe*Śēṣaṇṇa, *Vīṇe*Veṇkaṭasubbayya’s adopted son \[Subramanian 1985, p. 71; Vedavalli 1992, p. 55\]. *Doḍḍa Vīṇe*Śēṣaṇṇa became *Vīṇā Bakṣi*at the Palace after the death of *Cikka*Rāmappa in 1864 C.E., who had himself been appointed to the post after the

providence, they were able to obtain so quickly. This *vaṭhara,*and the mansion in it, survives to this day.118 The lower floor of this mansion contains a large hall. This hall served as Garaḷapurī Śāstri’s classroom. Schools, by themselves, did not exist in those times. The homes of great scholars served as schools. 

At this time, some ten or twelve students, some local, some from elsewhere, came to study with the Śāstri. Some studied poetics, while others studied *campū.*The Śāstri would include newly arriving students in these same classes. His students numbered about twenty, after a year or so. Gradually, the number of students studying subjects such as poetics, *campū,*and dramaturgy with the Śāstri reached thirty or thirty-fiive. Among them were many advanced students, such as Perīsvāmi Tirumalācārya, the principal of Mais ūru’s Sadvidyāśāla,119 Narasiṁhasvāmi of Mahādēvapura, Nārāyaṇa Sōmayāji, and K ūḍli Subbarāya Śāstri. That three-fourths of these students became great scholars in their own right is even now well known to many. 

Over time, the Śāstri’s great scholarship, poetic abilities, nobility of nature, reputation, and generosity with learning came to the attention of His Highness Kr̥ṣṇarāja Voḍeyar III,120 who called him to court through *Bakṣi* death of his guru *Vīṇe*Veṇkaṭasubbayya in 1838 C.E. Interestingly, *Cikka*Rāmappa’s son was *Cikka *\(the younger\) *Vīṇe*Śēṣaṇṇa \(1852–1926 C.E.\), himself a celebrated *vīṇā*player, and a student of *Doḍḍa*Śēṣaṇṇa and the vocalist Sadāśiva Rāv. *Doḍḍa*Śēṣaṇṇa’s son was the equally celebrated *Vīṇe*Subbaṇṇa \(1854–1939 C.E.\). At any rate, the text’s allusion to *Vīṇe*Śēṣaṇṇa as *Bakṣi*allows us to date Garaḷapurī Śāstri’s move to *Vīṇe*Śēṣaṇṇa’s *vaṭhāra* to after 1864 C.E. 

118Subrahmaṇyācārya’s son Vāsudēvācārya \(1865–1961 C.E.\) has recorded his clear memories of Garaḷapurī Śāstri’s house having been within the walls of the Maisūru fort, in apparent conflict with the information here \[Vāsudevācārya 1962, p. 39\]. Kempu Rāmāśāstri’s house, Garaḷapurī Śāstri’s initial residence in Maisūru, is stated above to have been close to Veṇkaṭasubbayya’s *vaṭhāra*in the Old Agrahāra, which is itself outside and to the south of the fort. Subrahmaṇyācārya died in 1868 C.E., so Garaḷapurī Śāstri must have moved into his own residence in the *vaṭhāra*before this date. He appears to have continued living here till around 1873 C.E. \(see footnote 138\), so it is unclear when exactly he would have lived within the fort. 

119Tirumalacārya was only 12 when he became Garaḷapurī Śāstri’s student \(see footnote 111\). The Sadvidyāśāla, founded in 1870 C.E. by Tirumalācārya, still flourishes in Maisūru. 

Garaḷapurī Śāstri’s son Ayyā Śāstri \(b. 1855 C.E.\) a student of Tirumalācārya, was the school’s vice-principal in 1871 C.E. 

120Reigned 1799–1868 C.E. He was a child of fiive when installed king by the British, with P ūrṇayya as *Dīvān,*after the defeat and death in 1799 C.E. of T.ippu Sultān, whose father Haidar ‘Ali had usurped the Mais ūru throne from the Voḍeyars. Kr̥ṣṇarāja Voḍeyar III held

Ten concentric circles are each divided into six equal sectors by the three diameters. The wheel’s hub houses the single *akṣara “khi” *, its rim houses 18 *akṣaras*distributed in radially symmetric positions, and the segment of each spoke between the rim and the hub holds 8 *akṣaras*, the outermost always being a conjunct consonant. Traversing the vertical, horizontal, and diagonal diameters, and the rim, in that order, yields the following verse in praise of Kr̥ṣṇarāja Voḍeyar III:

Narasappa,121 and pleased with the acclaim of the scholars at his court for the Śāstri’s scholarship, he bade the Śāstri visit the court regularly. 

After this time, the Śāstri continued his teaching, paying occasional visits to the court. There were frequent discussions among the scholars assembled at the court on various scholarly topics. Poetics and poetic tropes would be the topic of discussion on some occasions. Wishing to demonstrate his poetic abilities and scholarship in poetics to His Highness, Garaḷapurī Śāstri composed the *Kr̥ṣṇabhūpāḻīyam,*a work on tropology.122 Greatly pleased with this accomplishment, His Highness formally appointed the Śāstri as a scholar at the court, at a monthly salary of thirty *Haṇas.*In those times, a salary of thirty *Haṇas*had a value far exceeding that of a salary of even thirty *R ūpīs*today.123

In 1867, Mysore was elevated to the status of a 21-gun salute state.

He retired following Kr̥ṣṇarāja Voḍeyar III’s death in 1868, and died on or around August 27, 1878 \[Venkataramayya 1905, p. 270\]. He had played an important role in Kr̥ṣṇarāja Voḍeyar III’s attempts to secure the succesion of his adopted son, as well as the restoration of his rule, which ultimately occurred in 1881 C.E. Despite the central role he had in the administration, surprisingly little information is available about him. He received the title *Rāi Bahād ūr*on January 1, 1877 at the Delhi Darbār.

The work expounds on 107 different *alaṇkāras*, generally mirroring their treatment in Appayya Dīkṣita’s *Kuvalayānanda*, but illustrating them with 187 verses of Garaḷapurī Śāstri’s own composition, all in praise of Kr̥ṣṇarāja Voḍeyar III. This is hence a *yaśobh ūṣaṇa*composition, a form pioneered by Vidyānātha in his *Pratāparudrīya*. The three fiinal verses illustrate the *citrakāvya*forms *padmabandha, cakrabandha,*and *nāgabandha *\(Plates 4 and 5\). Garaḷapurī Śāstri’s son Ayyā Śāstri had the work published in 1931 C.E., with the help of a royal grant of Rs. 310. No date is given for the manuscript, but in 2008, the translator was able to identify and rescue the original manuscript, which is in Kannaḍa script. The paper is watermarked 1850, so the manuscript is subsequent to this date, matching the dates given in footnote 111. The manuscript remains in the custody of Mr Sandeep Sastry, son of Mr ṢK. Dwarki. 

123All Palace employees were paid in *Kaṇṭhīrava Haṇas*and *Pagōḍas*during Kr̥ṣṇarāja Voḍeyar III’s reign, and in British-issued currency after his demise \[Rao 1936b, p. 16\]. A *Kaṇṭhīrava Haṇa*was a gold coin weighing an eightieth of a Troy ounce \[Sircar 1966, p. 74\], and valued at 7.489 Pence \[in Buchanan 1807, p. 88\]. Thirty *Haṇas*would have contained 3/8 ounces of gold, and at the time of Buchanan’s travels in 1800 C.E., would have been worth just under £ 1. After 1868 C.E., a *Haṇa*was worth 4 *Annas*and 8 *Pais,*so that 30

*Haṇas*were worth about 9 *Rūpīs,*or just under £ 1, using the 1868 C.E. valuation of the Mysore crown jewels \[in Bell 1882, p. vi\] as a benchmark.

convened daily discussions among the scholars at his court on matters such as the *Vēdas,*the *Purāṇas,*the *Itihāsas,*and poetics.124 On one such occasion, the scholar *Vyākaraṇa*Narasiṁhaśāstri recited a *ślōka*he had composed in praise of the king, which had four metrically identical quarters in an unusual metre. His Highness was very appreciative. At once, the scholar Kavi Varadācārya declared loudly: “Your Majesty, the structure of this verse is entirely opaque, and does not correspond to any known poetic metre.” 

At this, His Highness turned to Garaḷapurī Śāstri, and bade him examine this matter and judge the soundness of the verse. Accordingly, the Śāstri analyzed the verse closely, and having determined, by the rules of prosody, which subclass of which poetic metre it belonged to, presented a manuscript on the matter to His Highness.125 When it was read, the assembled scholars all concurred on the correctness of the verse, whereupon *Vyākaraṇa*Narasiṁhaśāstri promptly composed the following verse, rose to his feet, and loudly declaimed:126

*nr̥simhākhyē gaṇḍa·śailē varadākhyo mahāmaṇiḥ|*

*nipatya khalu tatraiva vyaśīryata sahasradhā ∥*

124Kr̥ṣṇarāja Voḍeyar III was well versed in Kannaḍa, Marāṭhi, and Hindustāni, which were all languages current in Mais ūru, as well as knowledgeable in Persian and *Saṁskr̥ta*. 

He also knew some English \[Rao 1936a, p. 605\]. After having been relieved of administrative responsibilities for his kingdom in 1831 C.E., he was able to devote himself to scholarly and cultural pursuits. In Ayyāśāstri \[1916\], we see the following works attributed to him: *Śrītattvanidhi*, *Gaṇitasaṇgraha*, *Svaracūḍāmaṇi*, *Saṇkhyāratnakōśa*, *Saugandhikāpariṇaya*, *Śrīkr̥ṣṇakathāsārasaṇgraha*, *Āryārāmāyaṇa*, *Mahākōśasudhākara*, *Cāmuṇḍēśvarītriśati*, *Śrīkaṇṭhēśvaratriśati*, *Mahāviṣṇutriśati*, and *Gaṇapatitriśati*. He is also credited with the *S ūryacandrādivamśāvataraṇa*, *Daśarathanandanacaritra*, *Grahaṇadarpaṇa*, and the *Caturaṇgasārasarvasva*. Many may have been composed in his name by scholars at court. 

125See page 330 for a humourous example of such a debate. *Saṁskr̥ta*prosody is complex. 

A verse may comprise unequal divisions or *pādas*, each an aperiodic sequence of the eight possible trisyllabic groups \( *gaṇas*\) of long and short syllables. The last *gaṇa*may be short. 

Verses are chanted or sung, not just read, so cæsuræ \( *yatis*\) are specifiied for each *pāda*. Some 600–700 meters are distinguished by name, with many dozen in general use \[Deo 2007\]. 

126The metre is *Anuṣṭhubh*. See page 395 for a translation.

Meaning: The great jewel Varadācārya, falling down upon the rock Narasiṁha Śāstri, was broken asunder into a thousand pieces. 

Upon hearing this, His Highness, with great composure, declared: “It was altogether proper for Varadācārya to critique a verse of obscure structure, as it was for Garaḷapurī Śāstri to research the issue and determine the soundness of the verse, as it was for Narasiṁha Śāstri to compose the second *ślōka*for satisfaction that his fiirst composition was judged sound,” and by gifting expensive shawls to all three,127 ensured that no ill feelings developed between them. 

Garaḷapurī Śāstri was held in ever greater regard after this episode. At this time, Liṇgarāje Arasu,128 who was son-in-law to His Highness, and had himself been born into great wealth, used to engage himself in the melodious recitation of works such as the Kannaḍa *Jaimini Bhārata*,129 as well as in the study of *Saṁskr̥ta*works such as *Raghuvaṁśa*and that of Māgha,130

and having a talent for poetry, in creating new compositions, such as short *yakṣagānas.*131 Impressed with the scholarship and poetic skills of Garaḷapurī Śāstri, and wishing to study *Saṁskr̥ta campū*works under his guidance, he received the Śāstri with great respect, and made his wishes known. 

The Śāstri agreed, and began visiting the Palace in the evenings, systematically tutoring him in *campū*works. Basappa Śāstri,132 under Liṇgarāje Arasu’s care from childhood, also participated in these lessons. He made 127A traditional way of honouring scholars. 

128A noted literary and musical fiigure \(1823–1874 C.E.\). See Plate 20. Since he was born posthumously to *Doḍḍa *\(senior\) Liṇgarāje Arasu, Kr̥ṣṇarāja Voḍeyar III himself performed all neonatal ceremonies, named him after his deceased father, and subsequently ensured his proper education and nurture. His sobriquet *Aḷiya *\(son-in-law\) derives from his marriages to the princesses Kempunañjammaṇṇi and Kempadēvājamaṇṇi \[Arasu 1993, p. 75\]. *Aḷiya* Liṇgarāje Arasu’s three-story mansion was located on “H ūvina Bīdi” street within the old Mais ūru fort \[Arasu 1993, p. 77\]. Also see footnote 185 for the precise date of his death. 

129The *Kāvyavācana*and *Gamaka*traditions of musical poetry recitiation continue in Karṇāṭaka. *Rabīndrasangīt*is an example of this tradition in Beṇgāli. The *Jaimini Bhārata* is a work based on the *Mahābhārata*by the Kannaḍa poet Lakṣmīśa \(16th or 17th century\). 

130The *Raghuvaṁśa*is an epic poem by Kālidāsa on the dynasty of Raghu, to which Rāma belonged. Māgha is the author of the celebrated *Saṁskr̥ta*work *Śiśupālavadha,*and is held in very high regard for his well-rounded poetic abilities. A measure of this regard is indicated by the well-known *ślōka: “upamā kalidāsasya bhāraverarthagauravam | danḍinah. *

*padalālityam māghe santi trayo gunāh. ∥” *

excellent progress, absorbing even more of Garaḷapurī Śāstri’s instruction than Liṇgarāje Arasu did. Towards the end of his studies in dramaturgy and poetics, Liṇgarāje Arasu had also attained suffiicient expertise in music and *Saṁskr̥ta*to put them to good use in his works in Kannaḍa. He had, in fact, become a substantial scholar. 

Basappa Śāstri and he were both strong Kannaḍa scholars. Liṇgarāje Arasu continued his cordial and selfless patronage of Garaḷapurī Śāstri and Basappa, his ward from childhood; with their encouragement, he also composed many excellent *yakṣagānas*in Kannaḍa, and arranged for their performance on a stage built at his residence, with many children and youths under his patronage serving as actors. He also authored many excellent musical compositions in Kannaḍa and *Saṁskr̥ta*. Garaḷapurī Śāstri too, gained considerable scholarship in Kannaḍa through this association, and from his resulting contact with classical and contemporary Kannaḍa literature. 

In poetic matters, Garaḷapurī Śāstri and Basappa were as the right and left arms of Liṇgarāje Arasu. They critiqued all his poetic compositions, and Kannaḍa, and his translations of Kālidāsa’s plays into Kannaḍa. Śāstri \[1949\] provides the following information: “He belonged to the Vīraśaiva community. His ancestor was Muruḍu Basavasvāmi, *maṭhādhikāri*of the Rudrākṣi Maṭha Vīramāhēśvara sect, located in the Nārusandra village of Beṇgaḷūru district. His son was the well-known *Vēdic*scholar Mahādevaśāstri, who had been named chief priest in the Sammukha division of the Palace by the great patron of scholarship Kr̥ṣṇarāja Voḍeyar III. Basavappa Śāstri was born to him in the Śubhakr̥t *saṁvatsara*, that is, in 1843 C.E. Having lost his father in infancy, he grew up under the care of the well-known poet *Aḷiya*Liṇgarāja Arasu, and attained great scholarship in *Saṁskr̥ta*, Kannaḍa, and various arts, including music, under the tutelage of great scholars. As an accomplished scholar even by the age of eighteen, he composed the *Bilvavr̥kṣapūjāvidhi*in *Saṁskr̥ta*and the *campū*work *Kr̥ṣṇarājābhyudaya*in Kannaḍa, upon Her Highness’s bidding. Subsequently, he became teacher to Śrī Cāmarāja Voḍeyar, and later, a poet at his court. He acquired the title *Abhinavakāḷidāsa*owing to his poetic skills. His works include the plays *Śākuntala, Ratnāvaḷi, Vikramōrvaśīya, Mālatīmādhava,* *Caṇḍakauśika,*and *Śūrasēnacaritre*, a translation of Shakespeare’s *Othello.*His wrote many works for children in simple style, such as Bhartr̥hari’s *Ṉītiśataka, Śr̥ṇgāraśataka*, and *Vairāgyaśataka*, the *Śaṁkaraśataka, Ṉītisārasaṇgraha, Sāvitrīcaritre*, and works for scholars, such as the *campū Damayantīsvayaṁvara, Śrīharṣacarite, Rēṇukāvijaya*, and in *Saṁskr̥ta*, *Śivabhakti Sudhātraṇgiṇī, Āryāśataka, Nakṣatramālikā, Ambāṣōḍaśamañjarī, Aṣṭamūrti* *Tanayāṣṭaka, Dakṣiṇāmūrtyaṣṭaka, Śivāṣṭaka, Sadāśivāṣṭaka*. He passed away in the Vikr̥ti *saṁvatsara*on Saturday, the thirteenth *śuddha tithi*of Māgha.” The *tithi*of his passing corresponds to February 21, 1891 C.E.

pointing out shortcomings, and editing them to make them more generally accessible.133 Over time, Liṇgarāje Arasu matured as a poet. Resolving to undertake a major poetic work, similar to the *Jaimini,*in the *Vārdhaka* *S.aṭpadi*metre, he began the *Prabhāvatīsvayamvara,*completing a chapter a month. The work progressed rapidly to a stage where it lacked no more than two or three chapters; it was then already larger than the Karnāṭaka *Jaimini.*Here, the Arasu stopped his work, intending to hold a grand *maṇgaḷa*, and a celebration.134 The poetic flow, the richness of sentiment, and the rhetorical ornamentation in this work are especially praiseworthy. 

Liṇgarāje Arasu treated his guru Garaḷapurī Śāstri with the greatest respect, always rising to his feet to lead him to his seat as he welcomed him to his home every day.135 His gifts to the Śāstri were bestowed without his ever being asked. Thus freed from material concerns, the Śāstri could devote himself to gifting his knowledge to others at home, and sometimes visiting the Palace, and sometimes Liṇgarāje Arasu’s home. Garaḷapurī Śāstri’s small house became inadequate as his own family grew;136 determining that he needed a larger residence, he composed a *ślōka,*and recited it to Liṇgarāje Arasu, when he went to his house, as usual. The Arasu wrote it down respectfully. The *ślōka*was as follows:137

133Sarōjā Veṇkaṭarām, the only daughter of Rāmasvāmi Śāstri \(1894–1973 C.E., Ayyā Śāstri’s third son\) recalls the statement of her mother Sītamma \(1904–1993 C.E, the daughter of ṀṢPuṭṭaṇṇa\), that the well-known composition *Śr̥ṇgāralaharī*in rāga *Ṉīlāmbarī,* though generally attributed to Liṇgarāje Arasu, was actually the work of Garaḷapurī Śāstri. 

The two may well have collaborated, especially on the *Saṁskr̥ta*lyrics. 

134A *maṇgaḷa* isaceremonyofbenediction. ProfessorṬV.VenkatachalaSastryofMaisūru indicates that a boxed Royal Edition of the *Prabhāvatisvayamvara*exists in the library of the Kuvempu Institute of Kannaḍa Studies, University of Maisūru. 

135There appears to have been a warm friendship between GaraḷapurīŚāstri and Liṇgarāje Arasu. According to the biographical manuscript referenced in footnote 111, they were both great chess affiicionados, and spent a great deal of time playing chess. 

136His eldest son was Aṇṇayya Śāstri \(see the front matter for Śāstri 1891\), his second son Ayya Śāstri \(“Ayya” was a term of endearment, his real name being Veṇkaṭasubbaśarma\), and his third son Rāmasvāmi Śāstri \(referred to in Ayya Śāstri’s will\). Garaḷapurī Śāstri’s fiirst daughter was Nañjamma, and his second was Sītamma. Nañjamma married Hemmanahaḷḷi Kr̥ṣṇabhaṭṭa \[Śāstri 1925a\], and Sītamma married Kempu Rāmāpaṇḍita \(footnote 112\). Attiguppe Kr̥ṣṇaśāstri \(1873–1924 C.E.\), a well-known member of the Maisūru Representative Assembly, was Nañjamma’s son. As a child, he lived and studied in GaraḷapurīŚāstri’s house. 

His biography has been published by Veṇkaṭaramaṇa Śāstri \[Śāstri 1925a\]. 

137The metre is *Mālini*. This *slōka*apparently gained some renown at the time. Attiguppe Kr̥ṣṇaśāstri reports that he had accompanied Garaḷapurī Śāstri to the Palace on one occasion

Meaning: \(My lord, inferred address\) *tvamasirasikamadhyē maṇgaḷasvānaramyah. *—with melodious voice are you resplendent amidst connoisseurs, and *samaramr̥ditaśatruh. *—you are he whose foes have been crushed in battle; *kiñcarambhāratīcchuh. *—moreover, your righteousness makes you properly deserving of heaven and desirous of amorous sport with the heavenly nymph Rambhā; *daradharahr̥dayōham*—my heart is fearful since I live in someone else’s house; *nēśvaraśrīh. *—and I am penurious; *jitōnyaih. *—I am scorned by all, having no house of my own, and hence— *mamavitarasamr.-*

*ddhyai mandiraṁ*—give me prosperity by bestowing upon me the syllables *man, di*, and *ram*; *kākṣatistē*—what indeed, do you lack? 

You lack nothing, and I will gain respect because of you. Transfer to me the syllable *man*, for you, who are *ma ˙n-gaḷasvānaramyah.*will then become *gaḷasvānaramyaḥ,*that is, resplendent through melodious speech, meaning that the euphony of scholarship will manifest itself in your speech. By the syllable *man*, I, who am now *daradharahr̥dayaḥ,*will become *man-daradharahr̥dayaḥ,*the one who holds Narayaṇa in his heart. That is, I will attain peace meditating upon Narayaṇa. Give me *di*, for then you, who are *samaramr.-di-taśatruh.*will become *samaramr̥taśatruḥ,*the one whose foes have died in battle; that is, your foes will die when you take to battle. I, who am now *nēśvaraśrīh.*will become *di-nēśvaraśrīḥ,*or luminous like the sun, meaning I will shine with happiness. When you give me *ram*, you, who are *ram-bhāratīcchuh.*will become *bhāratīcchuḥ,*or the one who seeks Sarasvatī, that is, a scholar. I, who am *jita*on the part of others will become *rañ-jita* on their part, meaning I will be liked by everyone. 

The main but cleverly concealed message calls for the gift of *mandiram*, a dwelling. Grasping the ingenious construction of the *ślōka,*the Arasu exclaimed joyously to the Śāstri, “Truly, the gift of a house is unbefiitting of \(he was less than four when Garaḷapurī Śāstri died\), and greatly impressed Cāmarāja Voḍeyar X by reciting this *slōka *\[Śāstri 1925a\].

this feat of poetry\! This merits the gift of a kingdom\!” He then summoned the steward of his estates, and ordered that all resources be made available towards the construction of a house for the Śāstri, as and where he *c. 1873*

pleased. The Śāstri had a house constructed on a site he purchased in the row of houses in the Katvāḍipura Agrahāra.138

At this time, His Highness Kr̥ṣṇarāja Voḍeyar III made arrangements for the housing, board, and education of *Saṁskr̥ta*students from elsewhere in the stables belonging to Sañjīvarajē Arasu, and through *Bakṣi*Narasappa, established a school to promote *Saṁskr̥ta*learning in the realm.139 *Bakṣi* Narasappa appointed Garaḷapurī Śāstri as the instructor in this school for dramaturgy and poetry. Garaḷapurī Śāstri had his current pupils join this school; they continued their advanced studies with him, along with the other pupils there. 

A *vaidika*scholar of unsound intellect, who went by the name of Āśu-

kavi, arrived at around this time from the village of Gargēśvarī, and being an acquaintance, lodged in Garaḷapurī Śāstri’s house.140 Knowing his temperament all too well, the Śāstri welcomed him tactfully, upon which the

Āśukavi intimated that he had composed poetry in praise of the Mahārāja, and requested help in obtaining an audience.141 The Śāstri heard the fatuous and awkward poem, and seeing much humour in it, and thinking it worthwhile to arrange an audience, composed a *ślōka*of his own, and placing it into an envelope, suggested that an audience might be arranged were it 138 In 2008 C.E., the translator located the Katvāḍipura Agrahāra as the 2nd Cross Road behind Lakṣmi movie theatre, passing through 12 *.*3008 *◦* N, 76 *.*651 *◦* E. See footnote 240

for the origins of this *agrahāra.*We can date the episode referenced. Garaḷapurī Śāstri still lived in *Vīṇe*Veṇkaṭasubbayya’s *vaṭhāra*in 1873 C.E., the year his grandson Attiguppe Kr̥ṣṇasvāmi Śāstri was born \[Śāstri 1925a\]. *Aḷiya*Liṇgarāje Arasu died in December 1874

C.E., so the verse was likely composed in 1873 C.E. Garaḷapurī Śāstri must have moved to his new home in the Katvāḍipura Agrahāra in 1873 or 1874 C.E. An old home, perhaps dating to the time, still exists at \#721 on this street. In 2008 C.E., this house was owned by Gōpayya, a brāhmaṇa who was then 84 years old. See Plate 16. 

139This appears to be the Śaradāvilāsa Pāṭhaśāla, established by *Bakṣi*Narasappa in 1861

C.E. It started as a *Saṁskr̥ta*school, became a general primary school in 1870 C.E., and is now a large organization running a range of institutions from the elementary to the university levels. 

140 *¯*

*Aśu*means “quick” in *Saṁskr̥ta*, so an *āśukavi*is a poet skilled in composing verses impromptu, either spontaneously or in response to a challenge. Gargēśvarī is on the Kāvērī’s west bank, across from sōsale, which is on its eastern bank.

conveyed to Kavi Varadācārya, whereupon the Āśukavi delivered it to Kavi Varadācārya. The envelope contained a single *ślōka.*It held no other intimations or names. Kavi Varadācārya read it, and tactfully inquiring after the well-being and intentions of the Āśukavi, asked where he was lodged, 

to which the Āśukavi carelessly replied that he was staying with Garaḷa-

purī Śāstri. Kavi Varadācārya, thinking amusedly, “Who else but Garaḷapurī Śāstri could have composed such a delicious *ślōka*for a recommendation?”, and seeing the Āśukavi off courteously, saying that he had been pleased to

meet him and would try to arrange a Royal audience, acquainted His Highness with the episode, and upon his command, conducted the Āśukavi to

the Royal court, and after an audience, made reference to the *ślōka*he had received. The *ślōka*was as follows:142

*niḥsvatā·yuvati·cumbana·jany’onmāda·mūla·kavitā·kr̥ti·dakṣaṁ |*

*sarva·loka·parihāsa·padaṁ mām ko nirīkṣya na bhavet karunārdrah. ∥*

Meaning: I am adept at composing fatuous *ślokās*, distracted as I am from keeping company with the maiden Poverty. Who would not feel compassion for me, the object of universal ridicule? \(That is, please help me.\) At this, His Highness and the scholars at the court, greatly amused, inquired after the well-being of the Āśukavi, and had him recite the *ślōka*

he had composed in praise of His Highness. When the entire court laughed out loudly at the silly and awkward composition, His Highness, seeking to allay the Āśukavi’s discomfiiture, declared that there was no one else capable of such compositions, that he had derived great pleasure from his poetry, and bade him visit the court regularly. 

When, after a few days of the Āśukavi’s attendance at the court, a refer-

ence again arose to the *ślōka “nisvatāyuvati”,*and the Āśukavi arrived home

unhappy, having seen everyone laughing to themselves, the Śāstri asked why he seemed so distracted. The Āśukavi responded unhappily: “Whatever

was it that you sent Kavi Varadācārya\! As you well know, he recites this *ślōka* over and over again at court, his manner suggesting that I am the speaker. I appear to have become an object of ridicule at the court\! All this seems to have been on your account\!” The Śāstri comforted him, saying, “It is really not as you suppose. You should not feel troubled by levity on the part of 142The metre is *Svāgatā*. See page 396 for a translation.

anyone. The Mahārāja has great regard for you”, but the Āśukavi insisted

on moving into Kempuśāstri’s house, and in court the following day, recited the following *ślōka*before His Highness:

*garaḷapuri·śāstrī rāja·pāṇḍitya·māṉī*

*budha·jana·parihartrī kḥpitāṇṇayya·nāmā |*

*kavi·jana·karuṇārī kāśyapī drāhyasūtrī*

*kisalaya·salilāyām sosalē’ghrāra·vāsī ∥*

When the Mahārāja, remarking that this appeared to be a new composition, bade the Āśukavi explain its meaning, the Āśukavi submitted: “Your High-

ness, anything I say appears to become cause for merriment at this court. 

This *ślōka*is merely a composition arising from my anger at Garaḷapurī Śāstri, who appears to have been responsible for this situation. I refuse to be intimidated by these scholars.” When His Highness said: “The course you have chosen in the case of Garaḷapurī Śāstri is surely proper, but we would like to hear the meaning of this *ślōka*in your own words”, the Āśukavi re-

sponded: “I am incapable of diffiicult poetic compositions, and even a child would understand my poetry. The meaning of this *ślōka*is as follows—This Garaḷapurī Śāstri fancies himself a great royal scholar, and has little respect for scholars like me. His father’s name was Aṇṇayya. However, there remains some intrigue in this poem.” 

With everyone urging him to reveal this intrigue, the Āśukavi said: “Ev-

eryone calls him Aṇṇayya Śāstri. But even he, surely, is not as great a *śāstri* as Garaḷapurī Śāstri, so I have left out the word *śāstri,*and said ‘Aṇṇayya *nāmā*’ instead, thereby marking him with a *nāmā. *”143 Everyone laughed out loudly at this, and eagerly urged him to continue. The Āśukavi contin-

ued: “Having no regard for ordinary poets like us, he has sent Kavi Varadā-cārya some secret intimation. He was born into the Kāśyapa *gōtra,*and follows the *Drāhyāyaṇa sūtra. Drāhya*being the same as *Drāhyāyaṇa,*there are no hidden allusions there. However, there is some intrigue in the fiinal quarter of the verse.” 

143 *Aṇṇayya nāmā* means“namedAṇṇayya”in *Saṁskr̥ta*. InKannaḍa, however, theword *nāma*also refers to a *tilaka*, or mark on the forehead, in the form of one, two, or three vertical lines, worn by *Vaiṣnava*brāhmaṇas. The exact form is specifiic to the sect. This type of *tilaka* is also called an *ūrdhva puṇḍra*. In colloquial Kannaḍa, to mark someone with a *nāma*is to play a trick on them, so this is a pun on the part of the Āśukavi. Also see footnote 440.

39

With everyone again urging him to reveal this hidden intrigue, the Āśu-

kavi continued: “He is a resident of the Sōsale *agrahāra.*His garden has a patch of *kīre*greens.144 When visiting his house once, I have actually seen Garaḷapurī Śāstri, this great royal scholar, watering his *kīre*shoots. This is the hidden intrigue in my poem.” As the court laughed at his poem, the

Āśukavi laughed along, thinking they were laughing at the intrigue he had described. His Highness, smiling amusedly, congratulated the Āśukavi on

such a diverting *ślōka. *

The Āśukavi carried on thus every day, composing silly *ślōkas*on the spur of the moment, suffering, no doubt, the effects of his experiences and deeds in earlier births. On one occasion, he had returned from a visit to Cāmuṇḍī hill and Kārañjī lake. When someone at the court asked him how he had found Cāmuṇḍī hill and Kārañjī lake, the Āśukavi, intending to say that the breeze on Cāmuṇḍī hill was pleasant and that the water in Kārañjī lake was excellent to drink,145 instantly responded *“cāmuṇḍī parvatōvatō* *kārañjīudakōpibō”,*causing great merriment among those present.146

Finally, His Highness, out of pity for this accomplished but mentally unsound brāhmaṇa, awarded him a pair of shawls and a hundred *R ūpīs. *

This gift greatly pleased the Āśukavi, who learning from others that this

had been on account of Garaḷapurī Śāstri and Kavi Varadācārya, laid aside his anger, thanked them, and departed for home. 

Subsequently, when His Highness Kr̥ṣṇarāja Voḍeyar III took Cāmarajēndra Voḍeyar as his adopted son, he appointed Garaḷapurī Śāstri as his *Saṁskr̥ta*instructor when the prince was formally initiated into learning.147

After this time, Garaḷapurī Śāstri’s day was spent teaching at the *Saṁskr̥ta* 144The leaves of a member of the family *Amaranthus*, most likely *Amaranthus frumen-taceus. *

145Footnote in original: “The fate of many of the Āśukavi’s *ślōkas*remains unknown.” 

146This utterance translates roughly into “Cāmuṇḍi mountain \(is\) wind, and the Kārañjī lake \(is\) drink.” 

147Cāmarajēndra Voḍeyar \(b. February 22, 1863 C.E.\) was adopted on June 18, 1865 C.E., but the adoption received offiicial sanction from the \(British\) Government of India only in April 1867 C.E. This adoption was triggered partly by the fear of the kingdom being usurped by the British under Lord Dalhousie’s Doctrine of Lapse \(see footnote 520\). In a minute dated January 16, 1856, Dalhousie says: “The Raja of Mysore is now 62 years of age. He is the only Raja who for twenty generations past, as he himself informed me, has lived to the age of 60 years. It is probable therefore that his life will not be much further prolonged. . . 

I trust therefore that when the decease of the present Raja shall come to pass with no son or grandson or legitimate male heir of any description, the territory of Mysore, which will

school in the mornings, tutoring the prince in the afternoons, and visiting Liṇgarāje Arasu in the evenings. 

Around this time, His Highness determined to have competent scholars research and edit the medical work *Aṣṭāṇgahr̥daya*by Bāhaṭācārya, all available versions of which were corrupt, intending to have it published through the lithographic press at the Palace.148 After he appointed Garaḷapurī Śāstri and Hulluhaḷḷi Nallāṁ Gōpalakr̥ṣṇācārya to this task, Garaḷapurī Śāstri reduced his tutoring of the young prince to a half-hour in the afternoons, and then worked till the evening on the premises of the Palace Press, researching Bāhaṭā’s book with Gōpalakr̥ṣṇācārya.149

Thus progressed things for some time, and when in the Vibhava *saṁvatsara,*150 time in its course claimed the aged Kr̥ṣṇarāja Voḍeyar III Raṇgā-cārya,151 who had just become Palace Controller, had the work published152

by the lithographic press at the Palace with the permission of Mysore State then have lapsed to the British Government will be resumed and that the good work which has been so well begun will be completed.” 

148Kr̥ṣṇarāja Voḍeyar III established the lithographic press in the Ambāvilāsa section of the Palace in 1841 C.E. \[Kamath 1996, p. 42\]. 

149The front matter for Garaḷapurī Śāstri’s edition \(footnote 152\) attributes the work to Bāhaṭa, though a work called the *Aṣṭāṇgaḥr̥daya*is attributed to Vāgbhaṭa \(footnote 113\). 

Hymavathi \[1993, p. 49\] suggests that Bāhaṭa was a Telugu author who wrote the *Bāhaṭagrantha*and *Aṣṭāṇganighaṇṭu.*Rao \[1985, p. 89\] and Bendall \[1886, p. 61\] suggest Bāhaṭa to be a Prākr̥tized version, popular in Southern India, of the *Saṁskr̥ta*name Vāgbhaṭa. 

A lithographed copy of the *Aṣṭāṇgaḥr̥daya*was presented to the Royal Asiatic Society of Bengal on June 1, 1870 by Colonel G.B. Malleson \[Society 1870\], who was guardian to ḤH. 

Cāmarājendra Voḍeyar, July 1869–June 1877 C.E. This was surely GaraḷapurīŚāstri’s edition. 

150See footnote 166.

C.E., and formally crowned on September 23, 1868 C.E., but was invested with ruling powers only upon the Rendition of Mysore on March 25, 1881 C.E. C.V. Raṇgācārlu was appointed *Dīvān*of Mysore that same day. See Bowring \[1872, p. 388\] for Lady Bowring’s delightful account of the coronation. Raṇgācārlu had been appointed Palace Controller around May 1868, at a salary of Rs. 800 per month.

Commissioner Bowring.153 After its publication, Garaḷapurī Śāstri himself tutored his son-in-law Kempu Rāmāpaṇḍita as well as Puṭṭaśyāmapaṇḍita on the entirety of the material in this book. The two of them be-1869

came very accomplished in medicine, and taught medicine at the *Saṁskr̥ta*College at Maisūru.154 Later, Kempu Rāmāpanḍita became principal of the Āyurvēda College. Garaḷapurī Śāstri taught not just

literature, but also medicine to many students. 

While he was still resident in the *vaṭhāra*of *Vīṇe*Veṇkaṭasubbayya’s mansion in the Old Agrahāra,155 some of the Śāstri’s advanced students, seeing that the *Yuddhakāṇḍa*addendum by Lakṣmaṇakavi was stylistically quite different from the fiirst fiive cantos of the *Caṁpu Rāmāyaṇa*by Bhōja Rāja,156 now urged him to compose a new *Yuddhakāṇḍa*in the style of Bhōja Rāja; the Śāstri, feeling that such an effort would be in fulfiilment *nallāṁ gōpālakr̥ṣṇācāryēṇaca yathāmatisamyakpariśōdhya mahīśūra mahārāja cīpakami-ṣanar bavaraṇgnāmakaprabhōranumatyāvimudritamāsīṭsan 1869 nē isavi agīṣtu tā∥ 12.” *

This is *Saṁskr̥ta*, but curiously, it includes words and phrases with Kannaḍa declensions, such as *“saṁvatsarada” *, and *“san 1869 nē isavi” *. We give the following translation:

*“ ¯*

*Arya. May the reign of the moon Cāmarāja, the son of Kr̥ṣṇarāja, king of the Karṇāṭaka nation, be great and everlasting. In the saṁvatsara named Śukla, year 1792 of the* *Śāḻīvāhana era, on the day corresponding to the fifth tithi of the waxing phase of the lunar* *month Śrāvaṇa, in the printing press opened at the Palace of the Mahārāja of Maisūru,* *under the imprimatur of the Mais ūru Royal Chief Commissioner Lord Bowring, has been* *published this medical work called Aṣṭāṇgahr̥daya, being a compendium in six divisions* *created for the great benefit of physicians by Bāhaṭācārya, from the substance of original works* *by earlier followers of the system of Caraka, Suśrūtha and others, but which, having become* *altered, confused, and inexact due to inconsistencies in writing styles, has been judiciously* *researched and edited by Sōsale Garaḷapurī Śāstri and Nallāṁ Gōpālakr̥ṣṇācāryā, members* *of the community of scholars under the patronage of the monarch aforesaid. Dated August* *12, 1869 C.E.” *

153This would be Lewin Bentham Bowring, Mysore Chief Commissioner, 1862–1870 C.E. 

154Mahārāja’s *Saṁskr̥ta*College was established in 1876 C.E. in a building called *Sarasvatī* *Prāsāda*. After moving to Sayyāji Road in 1883 C.E., it added subjects such as Āyurvēda, 

music, and astrology. 

155The Katvāḍipura Agrahāra was also known as the Old Agrahāra. See footnote 167. 

156The remarkable Bhoja of the Paramāra dynasty ruled Malwa *c.*1000–1060 C.E., and was renowned both as a general and a literary fiigure. He is the Bhoja Rāja of legend. His substantial military accomplishments include victories over the Ghaznavid invaders. He also authored numerous distinguished literary works, including the fiirst fiive cantos of the *Campūrāmayaṇa*, though the colophons refer to him indirectly as *Vaidarbharāja*. A sixth canto \( *Yuddhakāṇḍa*\) was contributed by Lakṣmaṇa, who according to the colophon, was from Śanagara village \(Śanigaram of modern-day Karīmnagar district in Āndhra Pradēśa\)

and the son of Gaṇgādhara and Gaṇgāmbikā. He is assigned to 12th–13th century C.E.

of Bhōja Rāja’s own intentions, began work on a new *Yuddhakāṇḍa*at an auspicious time. The work was complete within a year. All students of his studying the *Caṁpu Rāmāyaṇa*now began studying this work.157

In later years, Garaḷapurī Śāstri devoted himself entirely to teaching advanced students, and stopped teaching beginners. Even his own children were taught by his advanced students.158 He also knew by heart every book he taught. His lessons were always lucid, enjoyable, and delivered with great facility. Many students were therefore eager to study with him. The Śāstri’s conversations with his friends, students, and his children were often humorous, inventive, and witty. I will now recount a couple of incidents in this respect—It was Garaḷapurī Śāstri’s practice to leave home after fiive every evening, and return at nine-thirty. A manservant by the name of Javara had been employed at the time to milk the cattle belonging to Kānkānhaḷḷi Subrahmaṇyācārya and Guṇḍācārya, who both lived in the same *vaṭhāra*as Garaḷapurī Śāstri.159 On one occasion, Garaḷapurī Śāstri returned home after nine thirty, to fiind the main door to the *vaṭhāra*locked. The Śāstri called out loudly for the door to be opened. Hearing this, Subrahmaṇyācārya, just settling down in front of his house after dinner, shouted back playfully:

“Who are you fellow? Javara, surely?” Garaḷapurī Śāstri responded immediately: “Indeed not, fellow, it’s I– *dvijavara\! *”160 Subrahmaṇyācārya immediately opened the door, took Garaḷapurī Śāstri by the hand, and led him inside, saying: “Śāstri\! How quickly you made your riposte\! A *dvijavara* you truly are\!” 

157The original date of this work is not given, but is likely to have been around 1869–1870

C.E. It was published in 1891 C.E. by GaraḷapurīŚāstri’s son Ayyā Śāstri, some fourteeen years after his father’s demise. In the colophon, Garaḷapurī Śāstri alludes to himself as the fiirst *Saṁskr̥ta*teacher of ḤḤCāmarājēndra Voḍeyar, who was born in 1863 C.E. It is unlikely that colophon was altered during publication, so the work was likely completed after 1869

C.E., in light of footnote 168, and the information on page 61 that Tirumalācārya founded the Sadvidyāśālā \(in 1870 C.E.\) after he had written the commentary. Other information \(see footnote 184\) suggesting that the work may have been complete as early as 1866 C.E may be discounted. The prince would have been only three years old at that time, too young to have received *Saṁskr̥ta*instruction from Garaḷapurī Śāstri. 

158His son Ayyā Śāstri was a student of both Perīsvāmi Tirumalācārya and Basappa Śāstri. 

159Subrahmaṇyācārya and Guṇḍācārya were brothers. See page 25. 

160Footnote in original: “*dvijavara*—an excellent brāhmaṇa.” *“Dvijavara”*can be parsed as *dvija·vara, dvija*meaning twice-born \(a brāhmaṇa\), and *vara*meaning excellent. Another parsing \(not the one intended\) yields *dvi·javara*, translating roughly as *a double Javara*.

On another occasion, when the Śāstri’s second son returned after fetch-ing some banana-flower *kari* 161 from the nearby garden of Narasē Arasu, the Śāstri interrupted his *cintana* 162 to ask him where he had been. When the son responded that he had been to fetch \(some\) *kari,*the Śāstri asked him where he would tie \(tether\) it. When the son responded that he would tie it in the sunshine, the Śāstri chidingly asked him how tying it in the sunshine could be the right thing to do. When the son responded that he would tie it in the shade, the Śāstri smiled and asked him how he proposed *1868*

to care for it. The son, realizing that the Śāstri’s elaborate discussion of so simple a matter could not be without motive, immediately recalled the *nighaṇṭu “kuñjarō vāraṇaḥkarī” *,163 and realizing the Śāstri’s meaning, responded that he would take care of it somehow; the Śāstri too, was pleased that his son, then just thirteen,164 had grasped his meaning. 

This second son of his is none other than *Kavitilaka*Ayyā Śāstri,165 who is presently a *mahāvidvān*at the court. Garaḷapurī Śāstri’s conversations were always full of wit and humour. 

Now, some time after ḤḤKr̥ṣṇarāja Voḍeyar III passed away in the Vibhava *saṁvatsara*,166 Garaḷapurī Śāstri, still resident in the Katvāḍipura Agrahāra,167 tutored ḤḤCāmarāja Voḍeyar X in *Saṁskr̥ta*every day in the Royal School specially established in a mansion for His Highness’s education;168 Raṇgācarya, who was Palace Controller at the time, witnessing 161Footnote in original: “*kari*—elephant in *Saṁskr̥ta*. In Kannaḍa, it refers to the petals of the banana flower, roasted and added to turmeric paste to give it reddish colour.” Sar ōjā Veṇkaṭarām, the great-granddaughter of Garaḷapurī Śāstri, recalls that her family would use roast banana peel to make *akṣate*, a pigment used to form a circular *tilaka *\(itself also *akṣate*\) in the middle of *vibh ūti*on the forehead. Also see footnote 378. 

162Footnote in original: “*cintana*—deliberation over some subject of recent study.” 

163A *nighaṇṭu*is a thesaurus or glossary, here the *Amara Kōśa *\(see footnote 66\). *Kuñjara,* *vāraṇa,*and *karī*are synonyms for elephant. See *Amara Kōśa *\( *kṣatriyavarga*:35\): *“dantī* *dantāvalō hastī dviradō’anēkapō dvipaḥ| mataṇgajō gajō nāgaḥkuñjarō vāraṇaḥkarī ∥” *

164That makes 1868 C.E. the date of this episode. Ayyā Śāstri was born in 1855 C.E. 

165Kr̥ṣṇarāja Voḍeyar IV bestowed the title *Kavitilaka*on Ayyā Śāstri in 1912 C.E. 

166He died on March 27, 1868 C.E. at 10:45 pm, after a long illness \[Desikāchārya 1949\]. 

According to Bowring \[1872\], he had “. . . long sufferred from swellings in the legs and neck, accompanied by severe coughing, vomiting, and purging. . . ” 

167The dates in footnote 138 suggest that Garaḷapurī Śāstri still lived at the time in *Vīṇe* Veṇkaṭasubbayya’s *vaṭhāra*, which must have been located in the Katvāḍipura Agrahāra. 

168Colonel Malleson etablished the Royal School within two months of arriving in Mais ūru at the end of June 1869 as Cāmarājēndra Voḍeyar’s guardian. The school, situated

fiirst-hand the scholarship and virtues of Garaḷapurī Śāstri, would very respectfully invite Garaḷapurī Śāstri to his own home every day, and out of regard for him as among the most distinguished of the distinguished scholars at the court, would occasionally do him the honour of some reward. 

At this time, the Śāstri composed a work called the *Hariharāṣṭōttara* that could be construed to have one meaning with respect to Īśvara and a different meaning with respect to Viṣṇu.169 Raṇgācārya, hearing of this work and his other works, developed a great regard for the Śāstri. 

Around this same time, a missive arrived from Veṇkōbarāv and Rāmacandrarāv, offiicials of a state in the region of Mahārāṣtra,170 announcing a *Bhāgavata Saptāha*celebration,171 and forwarding an invitation to the distinguished scholars of the Mais ūru court through Raṇgācārya. The invitation comprised delicate verses in the *¯*

*Aryā*metre. Raṇgācārya forwarded the

invitation to the Parakāla Svāmi.172 The *Śrī Svāmi*gathered the scholars of the court around him, and acquainted them with its contents. Some verses at the beginning of the document have been lost. The rest are as follows.173

in a building now known as L ōkarañjana Mahal, was run by Jayarām Rāv \(headmaster\) and A. Narasiṁha Ayyaṇgār, both English-educated brāhmaṇas in their twenties. Jayarām Rāv apparently read Kant and Goethe in the German original \[Ikegame 2009\]. Kr̥ṣṇarāja Voḍeyar III and the British had both wished to ensure a modern education for the young prince. 

169The translator has been unable to locate this work. Hopefully, it is among the inaccessible manuscripts of Garaḷapurī Śāstri currently in the possession of Mr Sandeep Sastry. 

The *Hariharābheda Stuti*is a similar work by Appayya Dīkṣita.

172The *Śrīvaiṣṇavaite*Parakāla Maṭha was very important in the political and religious life of Mais ūru at the time. Śrī Śrīnivāsa Deśikēndra Brahmatantra Swatantra Parakāla Mahā Dēśikan, head of the Maṭha \(1860–1873 C.E.\), was accorded a 21-gun salute by the Mahārāja, and was the *rājaguru *\[Desikāchārya 1949\].

The great scholars assembled were unanimous in their appreciation of this missive, but with no one indicating the ability to travel abroad at the time, the *Śrī Svāmi,*in accordance with Raṇgācārya’s request to arrange for a response, asked Garaḷapurī Śāstri to compose a suitable reply in the *Āryā*metre; the Śāstri composed a response accordingly. It was as follows:176

175Footnote in original: “Some 7 *mātras*are illegible here due to mold. *Vē *∥ *Kavitilaka* Ayyāśastri conjectures the missing letters to be *‘niśyaṇkamā’.*This appears likely.” 

176The translator has located the original manuscript in Garaḷapurī Śāstri’s hand, in Kannaḍa script, with the heading: *“śrī rāma *| *śrī vallavījana vallabhāya namōnamah..”*This title clearly echoes the fiirst verse of Vēdānta Dēśika’s *Yādavābhyudaya: “vande vr̥ndā-vanacaram vallavījanavallabham | jayantīsambhavam dhāma vaijayantīvibhūṣaṇam ∥”*Mr Naresh Keerthi is to be credited for this observation. See page 412 for a translation. 

177This fiirst verse is in the *Śārd ūlavikrīditā*metre. The following verses are in *¯*

*Aryā*. 

178The text numbers these verses sequentially, marking this the second verse. However, Garaḷapurī Śāstri’s original manuscript correctly resets the numbering, marking this as the fiirst verse of the *¯*

*Aryā*series, the preceding being an invocatory verse in a different metre. 

The manuscript also shows hemistich cæsurae \(such as the | after *santu*\) absent in the text.

The Parakālasvāmi and Raṇgācārya, very pleased with this response, forwarded it to those ministers. 

At this time, when Perīsvāmi Tirumalācārya, the Śāstri’s student and principal of the Sadvidyāśāla,183 wrote a commentary called the *Madhumañjarī*on the *Campūrāmāyaṇa Yuddhakānḍa*that the Śāstri had composed in the past, the Śāstri delighted greatly in having it read to him in *1866*

its entirety by his student, and approved of it as having done justice to the poet’s intent. An edition of the Śāstri’s *Campūrāmayaṇa* with this commentary is now available, having recently been published by 182Footnote in original: “7 *mātrās*are indecipherable in the worn-out sheet. *Vē ∥ Kavitilaka*Ayyāśāstri suggests that the missing characters are *‘vapravr̥ttī’.*This appears likely.” 

183Perīsvāmi Tirumalācārya \(b. March 8, 1848 C.E.\), Basappa Śāstri, and *Aḷiya*Liṇgarāje Arasu may rank as Garaḷapurī Śāstri’s three most distinguished students. Tirumalācārya \(Plate 19\) himself had many distinguished students, including Garaḷapurī Śāstri’s son Ayyā Śāstri, the philosopher ṀHiriyaṇṇa, ṀṆKr̥ṣṇarāv \(later *Dīvān*of Mysore\), and the poly-math *Rao Bahadur*ṀRangācārya. The great regard his students had for him is captured in V.ṬTirunārāyaṇa Ayyaṇgār’s report that his own guru ṀHiriyaṇṇa kept a portrait of Tirumalācārya in his study, and meditated before it with eyes closed and palms joined for a few moments every day \[Sāstri 2005, p. 12\]. Tirumalācārya’s works include *Upāyaniśrēṇikā*, *Vigrahārādhana Vidhāyiṉī*, *Prauḍhabodhiṉī*, *Vr̥ddhaseviṉī*, *Śrī Cāmarājēndrābhyudaya*, *Ambujavallarīstotra*, and the *Sadvidyāsārasaṇgraha*. As principal of the Sadvidyā Pāṭhaśālā, Tirumalācārya wrote the *Bālabōdhiṉī*, described in \[Bendall 1893\] as “A Sanskrit grammar for schools in Mysore, printed in the Devanāgarī character, with lithographed tables of other South Indian characters, and preceded by an English preface. Pt. 1. Mysore, 1880”, and the *Sadvidyāsaṇgraha*, described as “. . . an elementary reading book. . . , Bangalore 1890.”

sons of sarasvatī

the Śāstri’s second son *Vē*∥ *Kavitilaka*Ayyā Śāstri.184 Great poets capable of producing original works of such calibre, and scholars capable of such excellent commentaries are rare indeed in our times. 

When Liṇgarājē Arasu passed away, his in-law Nañjarāj Bahād ūr took charge of managing his estate as well as the care of his son *Cikka*Liṇgarājē Arasu, who was then still a child. Many scholars under

*December 5, 1874*

the patronage of Liṇgarājē Arasu accepted the patronage

of Nañjarāj Bahād ūr. One day, Garaḷapurī Śāstri com-

posed the following *carama ślōka* 185

*lakṣmī·śāradayōs’svaya ˙n’gr̥ha·patir’dātā dayāluḥkṣamī* *jāmātā dharaṇīśa·kr̥ṣṇa·nr̥patēś’śrīliṇgarāja·prabhuḥ|*

*bhāvābdē sahasi dvipāsya·divasē vārē śanēr’ viṣṇu·bhē* *śrīkaṇṭh’āṇghri·sarōruha·bhramaratāṁ āpat’tapōbhir’nijaih. ∥*

and thereafter remained engaged in his appointed duties, desirous of no one else’s patronage; by this time, the young *Mahārāja*had reached the end of his primary education in *Saṁskr̥ta*. To make more time for *1876*

his education in English, Raṇgācārya discontinued his *Saṁskr̥ta* lessons, and with the purpose of enhancing the *Saṁskr̥ta*school established by Kr̥ṣṇarāja Voḍeyar III, established a *Saṁskr̥ta*college in a new building called *Sarasvatī Prāsāda*built for the purpose, wherein he appointed Garaḷapurī Śāstri a Professor of Literature.186 Garaḷapurī Śāstri taught literature to a large number of students here. 

184Ayyā Śāstri had the *Yuddhakāṇḍa*with the *Madhumañjarī*published in 1891 C.E. It appears in Telugu script. An anonymous manuscript biography of Tirumalācārya that the translator discovered among Ayyā Śāstri’s papers \(and published recently by Sāstri \[2012\]\) recounts lore that Tirumalācārya wrote this commentary when he was 18 years of age, i.e., in 1866 C.E., suggesting that the *Yuddhakāṇḍa*had been fiinished by this time. This appears unlikely \(see footnote 157\). The front matter for the *Yuddhakāṇḍa*acknowledges the assistance of Garaḷapurī Śāstri’s eldest son Sōsale Aṇṇayya Śāstri, the King’s brother-in-law Kāntarājē Arasu, the commentator Perīsvāmi Tirumalācārya, Puṭṭaśyāmāpaṇḍita of the Royal Hospital, and Ayyanayyaṇgār, the head of the printing press at the Sadvidyāmandira. 

185A *carama ślōka*is a *ślōka*of eulogy. The metre is *Śārdūlavikrīditā*. See page 396 for a translation. The chronogram *“bhāvābdē sahasi dvipāsyadivasē vārēśanēḥviṣṇubhē”*yields the date of Liṇgarājē Arasu’s death: *“In the Bhāva saṁvatsara, on Saturday, the fourth day* *of Mārgaśira, under the nakṣatra Śravaṇa. *” This date is Saturday, December 5, 1874 C.E. 

*Śravaṇa*was current from 11:30 am that day till 11:30 am on December 6, 1874 C.E. 

186This institution was established in 1876 C.E. \(footnote 154\). G.B. Malleson was the prince’s guardian till June 1876 C.E.. Rangācārlu was placed in charge till August 1876, after which Major F.A. Wilson came to this position. This episode likely dates to this time.

Now, after Sōsale Garaḷapurī Śāstri arranged for the marriage of his second son *Brahmaśrī Kavitilaka*Sōsale Ayyā Śāstri, now *Mahāvidvāṁsa*at the court, with the daughter of Cāmarājanagara Śrīkanṭhaśāstri,187 who became *Dharmādhikāri*at the court, he would very affectionately host his in-law C..∥ Śrīkanṭhaśāstri and his younger brother Cāmarājanagara Rāmaśāstri, who became *Mahāvidvāṁsa*at the court and *Paṇḍita*at Mahārāja’s *Saṁskr̥ta*College, during their trips to Maisūru, always delighing in erudite discussions with them, as well as in tutoring his many students.188

On such occasions, he and his younger in-law Rāmaśāstri would discuss poetry, and compose assorted *ślōkas,*sometimes together, sometimes by themselves.189 Most of these *ślōkas*have been lost with them. However, his son *Br. *∥ *Kavitilaka*Ayyā Śāstri happened to be present when a few were composed. We will now describe how and when these were composed. 

Garaḷapurī Śāstri was resting one morning, after having just woken, when Rāmaśāstri, who had also just arisen nearby, recited the *ślōka “bālāyaṉīlavapruṣē. . . ”*during his morning prayers.190 On hearing this, Garaḷapurī Śāstri playfully challenged him, saying: “What\! Must you recite such time-worn *ślōkas*? Couldn’t we have something new, of your own composition?” 

He responded: “Indeed, tell me what sort of *ślōka*you would like, and I will compose one accordingly.” Garaḷapurī Śāstri said: “In that case, I will compose a *pāda*in the *¯*

*Aryā*metre, and we shall see how well you compose a

second *pāda*to match mine,” and started the fiirst *pāda*as follows:191

*Garaḷapurī śāstri: badhṉīmō vayam’añjali·*

*Rāmaśāstri: sampuṭam’avanamritē mūrdhni |*

187Lakṣmīdevamma was married to Sōsale Ayyā Śāstri in her ninth year \[Śāstri 1917\]. In a biography of Ayyā Śāstri, his son Kr̥ṣṇasvāmi Śāstri \(see page 337\) says that this marriage took place in the Kṣaya *saṁvatsara*of 1866–1867 C.E., when Ayyā Śāstri was fourteen. He was only twelve that year, however, so the *saṁvatsara*is likely incorrect, and the marriage took place in 1868 or 1869 C.E. Lakṣmīdevamma’s brother Veṇkaṭakr̥ṣṇa Śāstri was, in fact, the father of Veṇkaṭaramaṇa Śāstri, the author of this biography. 

188Śrīkaṇṭha Śāstri was made *Dhamādhikāri*in 1913 C.E. See page 119. Rāmaśāstri was made *¯*

*Asthānavidvān*in 1878 C.E., and later *¯*

*Asthānamahāvidvān *\[Rāmaśāstri 1997\]. 

189Activities and interactions such as these were common when scholars met, and formed an integral part of the training given to students. Also see page 336. 

190This should be *vapuṣe*, rather than *vapruṣe*. This *ślōka*in the *Vasantatilakā*metre appears in the second chapter of the *Śrīkr̥ṣṇa Karṇāmr̥tam*by Līlāśuka Bilvamaṇgala. The full *ślōka*is: *“bālāya ṉīla vapuṣe navakiṇkiṇīka jālābhirāma jaghanāya digambarāya | śārdūla* *divya nakha bh ūṣaṇa bhūṣitāya nandātmajāya navaṉītamuṣe namaste ∥” *

*Garaḷapurī śāstri: dadhnā sikta·kalēbaram*

*Rāmaśāstri: arbhakam’ēkaṁ purāṇam’uddiśya ∥*

They proceeded to compose fiive such *ślōkas.*This *ślōka,*however, is the only to have remained in Ayyā Śāstri’s memory. 

When the topic of *yamaka ślōkas*arose on another occasion, Rāmaśāstri remarked how utterly devoid of poetic purpose a meaningless *yamaka ślōka* by a certain ancient poet had been, and recited it as follows:192

*mukhañ’ca candra·pratimaṁ timaṁ timam*

*kucau ca pīnau kaṭhinau ṭhinau ṭhinau |*

*kaṭir’viśālā rabhasā bhasā bhasā*

*ahō vicitrā taruṇī ruṇī ruṇī ∥*

Garaḷapurī Śāstri responded: “Well then, let me compose a *ślōka,*and you can see how it turns out,” and composed the following verse right away:193

*smara·śriyaṁ yaṁ tarasā rasā’rasā*

*nirīkṣya gōpyō mumuhur’ muhurmuhuḥ|*

*anudravad’dhēnu·paramparaṁ param*

*tam’ēha jihvē vada nanda·nandanaṁ ∥*

One is to interpolate as per *“ralayōrabhēdēnarasālasāh.”*for *“rasārasāh.” *.194

He composed the following structurally similar *ślōka*the next day:195

*vr̥ṣā’py’upēkṣā·priyayā yayā yayā·*

*v’adhaśca bhikṣāñ’jagr̥hē gr̥hē gr̥hē |*

*dayārdray’airāvata·yātayā tayā*

*vaya ˙n’galad’dainya·may’āmayā mayā ∥*

192In the fourth *saṁdhi*of his *Kavikaṇṭhābharaṇa*, the 11th-century poet Kṣemendra of Kāśmīra criticises the following verse by the poet Candraka for lack of poetic merit: *“stanau* *supīnau kaṭhinau ṭhinau ṭhinau | kaṭirviśālā rabhasābhasābhasā ∥ mukha ˙nca candrapra-timaṁtimaṁtimaṁ | ahō sur ūpā taruṇiruṇiruṇiruṇi ∥”*The metre used is *Vaṁśasthavila*. 

See page 397 for a translation. 

193The translator has found a manuscript, in more than one hand, with several of the ensuing verses. Garaḷapurī Śāstri’s hand is readily recognizable. The other hand is presumably Rāmaśāstri’s. The manuscript shows *tamēvajihvē*rather than *tamēhajihvē*. The metre used is *Vaṁśasthavila*. See page 398 for a translation. 

194The grammatical formula *ralayōrabhedah.*declares the phonemes *ra*and *la*to be allophones in *Saṁskr̥ta*. We are therefore to read *rasālasāh.*in place of *rasārasāh. *. 

195The metre used is *Vaṁśasthavila*. See page 398 for a translation.

The following day, he composed two more *ślōkas:* 196

*tav’āmba kund’ōtkara·dāradā radāh. *

*kuc.’ābham’ētan’na tu kantu·kantukaṁ |*

*dr̥śōs’sakhāyō’jina·yōnayō’nayōh. *

*kacō’rcitōñcan’naḷinālinā’ḷinā ∥*

*pravāḷa·kānti·prakar’ākarā karāh. *

*radac.’chada·śrīr’tarun.’ārun.’āruṇā |*

*iti sphut.’ōpāsanayā’nayā nayā·*

*my’ahāni sarva·kratavas’tava stavah. ∥*

Having thus composed fiive *ślōkas,*he said to Rāmaśāstri: “Now, shall we hear one from you?” Rāmaśastri composed this *ślōka*that very day:197

*bhavēt’tavā’nugraha·dōha·dōhadō*

*dayā·plutō’pāṇga·lav’ālavālavān*

*manōratha·drur’mama nāma nā’manā·*

*k’phalaḥkathaṁ vā’bja·padē padē·padē ∥*

After having composed this *ślōka,*Rāmaśāstri declared: “I will now compose another for you,” and remained deep in thought for some time. After a while, Garaḷapurī Śāstri asked: “It is now nearly afternoon. Do we have even a single *pāda*complete?” Rāmaśastri replied: “The fiirst *pāda*is indeed complete. However, I had intended to incorporate both *ślēṣa*and *yamaka* *alaṇkāras*into the composition.198 I am now considering how to complete the verse.” Garaḷapurī Śāstri said: “Let’s hear the *pāda,*then,” and Rāmaśāstri responded:

*budh’ālir’ēkā mahit’ēhitē hi tē*

Garaḷapurī Śāstri replied to this *pāda*with

196The metre used is *Vaṁśasthavila*. See pages 399 and 400 for translations. 

197The metre used is *Vaṁśasthavila*. See page 401 for a translation. 

198A *ślēṣa*is a pun. A *yamaka*is the repetition of a set of syllables that can be parsed differently to yield different meanings in each case. In his *Kr̥ṣṇabhūpāḻīyam*, Garaḷapurī Śāstri defiines a *yamaka*as *sasvaravyañjanasamudāyasyāvr̥ttiryamakaṁ*, or as the repetition of a group of syllables.

*tav’ābhibh ūtā sva·pad’āpadā padā*

Rāmaśastri now said: “Very well, I will then compose the third *pāda;*let us see how fiitting a fourth *pāda*you compose,” and continued: *nirasta·kalpa·prasav’āsavā savā*

By itself, the fiinal *vā*in this *pāda*is devoid of meaning. Garaḷapurī Śāstri now faced the task of composing a fourth *pāda*whose initial letters would cause this fiinal *vā*to become meaningful, and at the same time, would stand as a sentence with meaning fully consonant with Rāmaśāstri’s poetic intent. 

After considering this challenge, Garaḷapurī Śāstri responded with *g’rasaiḥpar’ābhukta·savā sa·vāsavā*199

Astonished by the manner in which Garaḷapurī Śāstri had not merely fulfiilled his poetic intent, but had masterfully echoed *savāsavāsavā*, his *yamaka* from the third *pāda,*but with a different meaning in the fourth, Rāmaśāstri now exclaimed loudly: “Well done\! Well done, dear Śāstri\! How wonderfully you have framed this fiinal *pāda*\!”, and praised his feat over and over again. He then remarked that the *ślōkas*they had composed all had *yamakas* of two syllables, and that it would likely be very diffiicult to compose *ślōkas* with three-syllable *yamakas. *

Garaḷapurī Śāstri composed the following *ślōka*the very next day:200

*kamalā punātu bhava·śōka·malā·*

*n’avadh ūya māṁ garuḍa·yāna·vadhūḥ|*

*sumanā natā’vana·kalāsu manā·*

*g’avanamra·m ūrtir’agha·nāga·vanaṁ ∥*

On another occasion, Rāmaśāstri challenged Garaḷapurī Śāstri by saying:

“Let’s have a *ślōka*with a three-syllable *yamaka*at the start. I will begin by composing such a *pāda;*your task is to compose the next *pāda*that is consonant with my meaning,” and started thus:201

199The metre used is *Vaṁśasthavila*. See page 401 for a translation. 

200The metre used is *Pramitākṣara*. See page 402 for a translation. 

201The metre used is *Indravajrā*. See page 403 for a translation.

*Rāmaśāstri: mōhaṁ tamō hanta jighamsatāṁ svaṁ* *Garaḷapurī śāstri: dīpam nadī·pannaga·candra·bhūṣam ∥*

One yet another occasion, during a playful discussion of poetry, Rāmaśāstri remarked: “It would be quite novel if a *yamaka*at the start of a *pāda*in a *ślōka*were to repeat at the end of that *pāda*as well.” Garaḷapurī Śāstri responded: “Well, we shall compose such a *ślōka,*then\!” and composed the following *ślōka:* 202

*stainyēna praṇayēna vā bhuvi sakr̥d yas’tē namas’stēnam’a·*

Upon hearing this, Rāmaśāstri said: “A *ślōka*on Pārvatī would have the ending *‘śrī kāḷikākāḷikā’*; let us see if you can compose a *ślōka*following my design.” Garaḷapurī Śāstri then proceeded to compose the following *ślōka:* *śēṣasphāraphaṇāsahasravikasannānāpadānāpadā |*

*muccētrībhajatāñjitēnduśakala śrīkāḷikākāḷikā ∥*

It is most regrettable that the latter half this *ślōka*has not come to hand.

205An encyclopædic work on poetics, rhetoric, and dramaturgy by Vidyānātha, a scholar in the court of Pratāparudra II \(1294–1325 C.E.\), who ruled from Waraṇgal over the Kākaṭiya kingdom. All examples and illustrations in the work eulogize Pratāparudra, whence the work’s name. In his own *Kr̥ṣṇabhūpāḻīyam*, Garaḷapurī Śāstri uses this same device to honour Kr̥ṣṇarāja Voḍeyar III.

Garaḷapurī Śāstri explained that the word *dārān*, which appears with masculine plural case endings as per the *nighaṇṭu*formula *dārāḥpuṁsi ca bhūmnyēva*,207 is an adjective qualifying the noun *girāṁ dēvataṁ*.208 The students then asked: “If instead *dārāh.*were to appear as a substantive, must its qualifiier then appear in plural form?” Garaḷapurī Śāstri explained that adjectives must always appear in the same case and number as the nouns they qualify. Poetry is better served on some occasions, however, by using words that follow normal rules, and on other occasions by words that represent exceptions to these rules. When the students began to look for other such *ślōkas,*Garaḷapurī Śāstri said: “Do not trouble yourselves to search for other such *ślōkas.*I will compose such a *ślōka*for you myself,” and immediately dictated the following *ślōka:* 209

*śrī·vatsa·kaustubh’ālaṇkāra·sadmānō gr̥hīta·padmā nō |*

*kāmitam’ati·mandārāḥparamōdārāḥphalantu hari·dārāh. ∥*

The students were truly delighted by the Śāstri’s work. 

207The *Ratnāpaṇa*gloss by Mallinātha’s son Kumārasvāmi has *“dārāḥpuṁsi ca bhūmnyeva”,*but see *Amarakōśa*6.6 *: “bhāryā jāyā\_tha puṁbh ūmni dārāḥsyāt tu kuṭumbiṉī | pu-randhrī sucaritrā tu satī sādhvī pativratā ∥”*and *Amarakośa*2.5 *: “niśāntaṁ pastyasadanaṁ* *bhavanā\_gāra mandiram | gr̥hāḥpuṁsi ca bhūmnyeva nikāyya nilayā\_laya ∥”*In the fiirst verse quoted, *puṁbh ūmni*means “in the masculine plural”. Both *dāra*and *gr̥ha*can mean wife, but anomalously take masculine plural case endings, always. 

208This *maṇgalaśloka*expresses reverence for Sarasvatī, addressed as *girāṁ devatā *\(“goddess of speech”, or “goddess of the *Vedas*”\). As the direct object of the verb *vande*, it takes the feminine accusative singular form *girāṁ devatām*. A series of *bahuvrīhis*qualifying *girāṁ* *devatā*also appear. *Saṁskr̥ta*requires perfect inflectional accord between substantives and adjectives, so these must also all be in the feminine accusative singular. The *nighaṇṭu*rule, however, forces *padmabhuvaḥdāra *\(“wife of Brahma”\) into the masculine accusative plural *padmabhuvaḥdārān*, falsely suggesting a grammatical inconsistency or anomaly. 

209Here, Garaḷapurī Śāstri avoids the suggestion of a grammatical discrepancy by making *hari·dārāh.*the subject in the sentence. All *bahuvrīhi*compounds qualifying *hari·dārāh. *

are in the nominative masculine plural, showing perfect inflectional accord with their external referent. In the *Pratāparudrīya*verse, in contrast, *padmabhuvaḥdārān*stands out because of inflectional discord with *girāṁ devatām*. If the *Pratāparudrīya*verse illustrates the anomalies arising with stems such as *dāra*, Garaḷapurī Śāstri’s verse illustrates how they may be used so the inflectional endings remain consistent. Mr Naresh Keerthi is to be thanked for discussions regarding this verse. 

Garaḷapurī Śāstri is able to create some interesting *antyānuprāsa*concordances in this verse. In the fiirst line, *sandhi*rules change *padmāḥnah.*to *padmā nō*, echoing the *sadmānō*. 

The second line echoes *dārāh. *, fiirst in *mandārāh. *, then in *udārāh. *, and fiinally in *haridārāh. *.

from Cāmarājanagara, recited a palindromic *ślōka*in the course of some discussion, and playfully challenged Garaḷapurī Śāstri to compose a similar *ślōka.*Garaḷapurī Śāstri promised to have it done by dinner time the same day after he had completed his teaching and other duties, and spending the day in thought as he went about his normal routine, returned in the late evening, and calling for Rāmaśāstri’s attention, recited210

*draupad’īna·nadīpa·drau māra·bhē śuśubhē ramā |*

*sv’āparādha·dharā’pa·svā vēda·yānini yādavē ∥*

which Rāmaśāstri greatly applauded, enthusiastically shaking and nodding his head. This *ślōka*has survived only because we were able to fiind the piece of paper on which the Śāstri’s second son had jotted it down after dinner. 

With this *ślōka*we discovered another moldy scrap of paper, on one corner of which was the following single quarter of a *praśṇōttarābhinna ślōka*the Śāstri had composed on some occasion: *“pramadōrasikaśśētē”.*Here, *“pramadōrasi, kaḥ, śētē”*is the question, to which the answer is *“pramadaḥ,* *rasikaḥ, śētē” *.211 Unfortunately, a large number of the Śāstri’s *ślōkas,*having remained unrecorded, have been lost with him. 

Around that time, after he had written his commentary on the *Yuddhakāṇḍa,*Perīsvāmi Tirumalācārya founded a *Saṁskr̥ta*school called the Sadvidyāśāla, along the lines of an English school, and became its principal. 

The school grew rapidly, and soon enrolled about two hundred students. 

Many of these students studied in an English school for a half-day, and studied *Saṁskr̥ta*at this school the other half-day. Some others attended this school alone, studying *Saṁskr̥ta*for a half-day. Many of the younger pupils 210The metre used is *Anuṣṭubh*. See page 409 for a translation. 

211 *Pramadōrasi*is the locative singular form of *pramadōras*, a *ṣaṣṭhī tatpuruṣa*compound construed as *pramadāyāḥuras*, yielding the meaning “on the chest of a \(wanton\) woman”. 

The sentence is now asking “Who sleeps on the chest of a \(wanton\) woman?” The answer is also given by the same sentence, if decomposed as *pramadaḥrasikaḥśete*, meaning “the intoxicated libertine sleeps”.

studied *Saṁskr̥ta*at this school for both half-days. There were four teachers at this school at the time, including its principal.212 The subjects taught included literature, poetry, *campū,*drama, *alaṇkāra,*logic, and grammar. 

Now, as he was teaching the *Ṉīlakaṇṭhavijaya*to some of his students one day,213 Perīsvāmi Tirumalācārya thought of asking his guru Garaḷapurī Śāstri to write a commentary on this work, and accompanied by his fellow-student Noṇavinakere Tirumalācārya, visited the Śāstri, and made this suggestion. Garaḷapurī Śāstri responded that he had indeed planned to write such a commentary, and in light of their suggestion, would start on it immediately. He began on this endeavour, working whenever he found time. 

Within a month, he had completed his commentary on half of the fiirst canto of the *Ṉīlakaṇṭhavijaya. *

212See footnote 119. According to an anonymous manuscript the translator discovered in Kavitāvilāsa \(and published recently \[Sāstri 2012\]\), the instructors at the time included Perīsvāmi Tirumalācārya, Sōsale Ayyā Śāstri, Āji Ayyanayyaṇgār, Sō∥ Śrīnivāsācārya, and Guṇḍa Śāstri. 

213This is a famous *campū*work in fiive chapters written by Ṉīlakaṇṭha Dīkṣita around 1637–1638 C.E. A minister in the court of Tirumala *Nāyaka*of Madurai, he is from what is surely the most important family of scholars of the period. Ṉīlakaṇṭha’s grandfather Acchan Dīkṣita was the younger brother of the astonishingly prolifiic poet and scholar Appayya Dīkṣita, who was reportedly patronized by the Āravīḍu kings *Cinna*Timma and Veṇkaṭāpati, as well as *Cinna*Bomma Nāyaka of Vēlūr. As many as 104 works are attributed to Appayya Dīkṣita, many authoritative, in fiields as diverse as poetry, grammar, and philosophy. Garaḷapurī Śāstri’s *Kr̥ṣṇabhūpāḻīyam*follows the treatment of *alaṇkāras*in Appayya Dīkṣita’s *Kuvalayānanda*, although the verses illustrating the *alaṇkāras*are Garaḷapurī Śāstri’s own.

on the Śāstri’s left cheek. Since it seemed to be a minor problem, little attention was paid to it for two or three days, beyond the application of some simple home remedies; it quickly swelled up and worsened, however, requiring the Śāstri to take a leave of absence from his teaching at the Pāṭhaśāla and the Royal School.214 Upon becoming aware of this problem, Controller Raṇgācārya promptly arranged for proper treatment for the Śāstri at the hands of Dr. Jagannātha Nāyaḍu of the Palace Hospital. 

This doctor, who was then renowned as a skilled physician, exerted himself to the utmost, both from respect for the Śāstri as well as in deference to the directives of authority. The ailment failed to yield, however. Many of the Śāstri’s students, relatives, and friends attended to the Śāstri day and night, helping to lighten his suffering. The Śāstri remained in high spirits, bantering in good humour with this company, and having his students read to him from the *Vēṇīsaṁhāra*and the *Bhagavadgītā*.215

Having a premonition of his own passing, however, he called together his family and a group of his foremost students on the morning of the day of the tenth *bahuḷa tithi*in the Caitra month of the Īśvara *April 8, 1877*

Grasping his meaning, his son quickly wedged a *tuḷasi*stalk from the *arcana* behind his right ear. Within two or three minutes of his doing so, the Śāstri had attained the lotus feet of Śrī Veṇkaṭācalapati.224

218 *Maḍi*vestments are ritually pure, and in modern times connote freshly washed clothes, generally worn dripping wet to avoid any possible contamination. This echoes the ancient practice of wearing bark vestments, regarded as having intrinsic purity, even if unwashed. 

Silk, also being intrinsically pure, is commonly worn during ritual. Broadly, to practice *maḍi* is to follow detailed norms of ritual conduct that ensure freedom from ritual pollution.

A good death is traditionally regarded as occurring in the presence of family and loved ones, after completing the specifiied *dānas*and other rituals, on the ground or on a bed of *darbha*or *kuśa*grass, and in the presence of a *tulasi*plant or in contact with *tulasi. *

224It is impossible to accurately diagnose Garaḷapurī Śāstri’s ailment at this point, but we can make some educated guesses. The account gives few specifiics regarding the presentation of the ailment, but refers to the lesion using the Kannaḍa word *“guḷḷe” *, which suggests a boil, blister, or furuncle, most likely involving suppuration. This seems to exclude the possibility of neoplasm. The relatively rapid course of the illness is also highly suggestive of infection. Diabetes can increase the severity of any infections, and predispose the patient to skin and soft-tissue infections. However, diabetes is not known among current descendants of Garaḷapurī Śāstri. A likely scenario is that of a superfiicial infection leading to a furuncle that got out of hand, resulting in a systemic infection such as sepsis, or a secondary infection, such as endocarditis. An infection of the lymph nodes in the cheek is also a possibility. Furuncles are usually *Staphylococcus aureus*infections that generally heal in a couple of weeks, but can sometimes persist much longer, and lead to secondary infections. Once a furuncle forms, topical remedies, including anti-bacterial preparations, are generally of little value in pre-empting deeper abscesses or systemic infections. Topical preparations, herbal

Following Garaḷapurī Śāstri’s passing, *Jahgīrdār*Kr̥ṣṇamūrti,225 who had been offiiciating as Controller for three months in Raṇgācārya’s absence,226 appointed Garaḷapurī Śāstri’s second son *Kavitilaka*Ayyā Śāstri as potions, dietary regimes, compresses, and surgical drainage were most likely the only treatment options available. Secondary infections and sepsis were likely much more common at the time than they are now, since antibiotics were unknown, and the infection had to be overcome by the body’s own immune response. The location of the lesion and the lack of effective painkillers would have made it very diffiicult for Garaḷapurī Śāstri to eat or drink, increasing the likelihood that he had become malnourished, and that his immune response was depressed. He appears to have remained mentally alert as well as active on the eve of his death, reducing the likelihood that the cause of death was either secondary sepsis or menin-gitis, both of which cause extreme fatigue, prostration, and frequently, mental confusion. 

Secondary endocarditis remains a possibility, although the account makes no reference to fevers. Ayyā Śāstri \(or the biographer\) may simply have seen fever as a routine symptom, and not worth explicit mention. Garaḷapurī Śāstri also probably received much help from family members and friends in attendance during his ritual preparations on the eve of his passing. The deterioration of cardiac function in the fiinal stages of endocarditis would have been debilitating and clearly perceptible to Garaḷapurī Śāstri; it may have served as an indication that his body was giving up, leading to his premonition of death. All of this, of course, is speculation, albeit somewhat informed by current understanding of disease processes, but he seems to have died of an infection that would likely be easily cured today. 

225Sir Pūrṇayya Narasiṇgarāv Kr̥ṣṇamūrti, who went on to become *Dīvān*of Maisūru \(1901–1906 C.E.\), was the grandson of the famous P ūrṇayya, who was *Dīvān*under T.ippu Sultān, and continued in this capacity after Kr̥ṣṇarāja Voḍeyar III came to the throne as a minor in 1799 C.E. P ūrṇayya was granted Yeḷandūr in Camarājanagara district as a *jāhgīr*in 1807

C.E. P ūrṇayya died in 1812 C.E., but by 1835, the *jāhgīr*had been divided piecemeal among his descendants, and largely dissipated. Cubbon was forced to intervene, and cancelled the rights of all except P.ṆKr̥ṣṇamūrti’s father Narasiṇga Rāo Kr̥ṣṇamūrti \(he was the son of Śrīnivāsa M ūrti, himself the son of P ūrṇayya’s son Narasiṇga Rāo\). P.ṆKr̥ṣṇamūrti would have inherited the *jāhgīr*. 

226There is inconsistency between this account and the historical record of Raṇgācārlu’s absence. The text implies that Raṇgācārlu was present at the onset of Garaḷapurī Śāstri’s illness \(he arranged for treatment\), but was absent at his death, and further, that he learned of his death only upon returning to his duties after a three-month absence. GaraḷapurīŚāstri died on April 9, 1877. Raṇgācārlu testifiied during an inquiry into the theft of certain Palace jewels, however, that he went on leave in July and returned in September 1877, dates which are confiirmed by Kr̥ṣṇamūrti’s testimony \[Stanhope 1878, pp. 171, 173\]. \(For an account of the theft and the resulting scandal, see \[Bell 1882\].\) The *tithi*given for Garaḷapurī Śāstri’s death cannot be wrong, since his son Ayyā Śāstri, the primary source of information for this biography, would have performed the *śrāddha*for his father each year on that *tithi*. Matters are further complicated by this excerpt from the short story *Hāgalakāyi Mattu Tāḷehūvu* 65

a scholar at the court at a salary of three *Varāhas,*demonstrating regard for him as the son of a great scholar.227 When Raṇgācāri returned from his absence, he was greatly saddened by the news of Garaḷapurī Śāstri’s passing, and considering a salary of three *Varāhas*inadequate for his second son Ayyā Śāstri, increased it to four *Varāhas,*and continued to maintain great regard for him. Since that time, *Kavitilaka*Ayyā Śāstri has attained great fame and stature, and has now come to be regarded by all as a truly fiitting successor to Garaḷapurī Śāstri.228

from *Iddar ū Irabahudu*by Ayyā Śāstri’s son Garaḷapurī Śāstri, which he says is based on real events \[Śāstri 1946b, p. 2\]. Veṇkaṭasubbaśāstri is being Ayyā Śāstri’s real name, it is clear that the account refers to him. 

*Dvādaśīpāraṇe*was under way in many homes. Veṇkaṭasubbaśāstri was reading the *Rāmāyaṇa*aloud after having fiinished his *pūjā*. Being musically accomplished, his reading of it in the *rāga Bilahari*was captivating. This virtuous man was a great devotee of Śrīrāma. He never missed his daily reading of the *Vālmīkīrāmāyaṇa*. He valued more than his very life the beautifully written manuscripts of the *Rāmāyaṇa*in his possession. He safeguarded them in a teak-wood box he had made for that very purpose. . . Veṇkaṭasubbaśāstri was still young—just twenty-three. He lived in the *vaṭhāra*of *Vīṇe*Veṇkaṭasubbayya in the Old Agrahāra. Not wishing to live with his brothers following the death of his father, he had disposed of his share of the inherited property, and set up a separate household with his wife. Following the division of property, he had been left only with his daily clothes, a silk *magaṭa*, and these *Rāmāyaṇa*manuscripts. 

How was he to run a household without kitchen utensils, clothes, or foodstuffs? 

He sent his wife to her father’s home for two months, worked hard to garner the essentials for a household, found a house, and brought his wife back at an auspicious time. In the meanwhile, he had secured a position as teacher in *Śrīmān* Tirumalacārya’s school at a salary of six *Rūpīs*a month. His application to be granted his father’s position in the palace had not yet borne fruit. He had unequalled scholarship in both *Saṁskr̥ta*and Kannaḍa, and had acquired great poetic ability at an early age. On this Kārtīka *śuddha dvādaśī*. . . 

The excerpt suggests that he had not yet been granted a position in the palace as of Kārtīka *śuddha dvādaśī *\(November 17, 1877\), a full seven months after Garaḷapurī Śāstri’s death. 

One possibility is that Raṇgācārlu was in Maisūru at the time of Garaḷapurī Śāstri’s passing, but that Ayyā Śāstri’s appointment as a scholar at a salary of three *Varāhas*occurred during the time Kr̥ṣṇamūrti was offiiciating for him. The excerpt above suggests that Ayyā Śāstri had sought an appointment as a scholar at the court. Perhaps his application was not approved, but Raṇgācārlu instead raised his salary to four *Varāhas*. His application may still have been pending in November 1877. 

227A *Varāha*was the equivalent of ten *Haṇas.*See footnote 123. Ayyā Śāstri would have been twenty-two at this time. He was honoured with the title *Kavitilaka*in 1912 C.E.

great scholarship, and always treated students with great affection. 

He remained modest in the presence of other scholars. All students hence showed him great devotion. He commanded both respect and devotion from scholars, as well. 

When anyone criticized or disparaged him, whether at home or elsewhere, he approached the matter gently and without anger, and handled it with humility, in a spirit of reconciliation. In consequence, he had no enemies in this world, and received great affection from all. The Śāstri had pursued the study of the *Sāmavēda*and literature immediately following his *upanayana;*after acquiring a command of the *Sāmavēda*suffiicient for the performance of his daily rituals,229 he had studied works on grammar along with literature. After mastering foundational works in grammar, he turned to advanced works in literature and logic, and after seven or eight years of deep study, mastered them both, developing especially strong abilities as a poet. Subsequently, through his association with physicians, astrologers, and *Vēdāntins,*he also acquired substantial scholarship in medicine, astrology, and *Vēdānta.*230

Owing to his exceptional scholarly abilities, the Śāstri had a large circle of acquaintances and friends, and close friendships with many scholars and aristocrats. Through several such associations, he acquired strong skills in chess, and an excellent knowledge of music through his friendships with many *vīṇā*players.231 The Śāstri would frequently amuse himself by playing chess with his friends.232 When the need arose to recite *ślōkas*in the course of conversation, he would do so melodiously, and would also read 229The *Sāmavēda*is sung in complex musical patterns, rather than chanted, as the other *Vēdas*are. Learning the *Sāmavēda*is no simple undertaking, since its melodies must be reproduced exactly. 

230Garaḷapurī Śāstri taught literature \(see page 26\), logic \(see footnote 761\), as well as medicine \(see page 24\) to his students. 

231See footnotes 117 and 133. Also, Rajagopalan \[1992, p. 291\] indicates that the musician M ūg ūru Subbaṇṇa often consulted Garaḷapurī Śāstri about the meaning of *Saṁskr̥ta kr̥tis*.

aloud the *Rāmāyaṇa*daily, its verses set to many melodious *rāgas*.233 Many were the listeners who derived pleasure from this. That such a profound scholar should also be so musically accomplished was akin to gold exuding fragrance. 

The Śāstri was born with an exceptional memory. As a result, he had retained in memory everything he had learnt from his gurus. Any book he taught his students even once also became committed to memory, so that he could, with complete ease, teach the same work again without ever needing to refer to the book.234 In addition, he carried in his memory all the books he had written, the thousands of verses of his own composition, innumerable compositions of ancient poets, and a number of *cūrṇikās*;235 they have all been lost with him. Printing was not prevalent at his time, nor was it the practice to commit to writing most material, with some exceptions, such as works studied with a guru, new works written by oneself, and certain works required in the conduct of daily life. The practices of education had not reached their current levels of sophistication, nor were there printing presses, newspapers, or schools. One can only imagine the impact such a scholar would have had were he to have lived in our modern world. 

When there were errors in the books he was teaching, the Śāstri’s deep insights into the poet’s style and design allowed him to confiidently interpolate corrections exactly matching the poet’s intent. On one occasion, when he had just moved to Mais ūru from Sōsale, he happened to be teaching the ninth canto of the *Raghuvaṁśa*to a group of four students. One of the four had a palm-leaf manuscript, from which the other three were making their own copies. This manuscript included a commentary, but nine of the original *ślōkas*happened to be missing from the manuscript, leaving only the commentary intact. Considering that waiting to obtain a complete copy would amount to undue delay, he proceeded to reconstruct all 233Sarōjā Veṇkaṭarām, GaraḷapurīŚāstri’s great-granddaughter, recalls that Mr ṢG. Śāstri, Ayyā Śāstri’s eldest son, had a palm-leaf manuscript of the *Rāmāyaṇa.*This is likely the same manuscript that Garaḷapurī Śāstri had used for his *pārāyaṇa*, and which Ayyā Śāstri must have used in his own melodious *Rāmāyaṇa*readings \(see the excerpt in footnote 226\). 

234GaraḷapurīŚāstri’s namesake grandson ṢG. Śāstri, speaking on the occasion of the cen-tenary celebration of Basappa Śāstri, recalled Garaḷapurī Śāstri’s advice to his son Ayyā Śāstri not to attempt poetical composition before fiirst committing at least ten thousand verses to memory, offering Basappa Śāstri as an example \[Venkaṭasubbayya and Gītācārya 2000, p. 15\]. Basappa Śāstri was, of course, Garaḷapurī Śāstri’s student and Ayyā Śāstri’s teacher. 

235A *cūrṇikā*is a composition in rhythmic prose.

nine verses using the available commentary, and taught the students accordingly. When a new copy of the work was fiinally obtained, the nine verses in it were completely identical to the reconstructed verses. Similarly, when he happened to be teaching the following verse from the sixth canto of the *Naiṣadha*to some students,236

he noticed that the third quarter of this verse improperly followed the 12-syllable *Vaṁśastha*metre, instead of the 11-syllable *Vajrā*metre. After some reflection, he proceeded, correcting the third quarter to read *“sakhīmukhē* *candra samēsasarja” *. This turned out to be the correct form when an old copy of the work was consulted. 

Even from his very fiirst days in Mais ūru, Garaḷapurī Śāstri never sought anyone’s patronage, unless that person himself approached him. He refused such patronage even when offered by persons of note, unless it was also accompanied with due and proper respect. He would treat as a close friend any benefactor who treated him with genuine regard. He was always content with what support he received, and never, on his own accord, 236The *Naiṣadhacarita*or *Naiṣidhīya*is a complex poem of about 3000 verses by Śrīharṣa, a poet and *Advaita*philospher of the 12th century C.E. It is based on the story of Nala and Damayantī from the *Mahābhārata.*It is seen as a poetical masterpiece, but also as complex and diffiicult reading, especially since its treatment reflects Śriharṣa’s philosophical disposition. The saying *“naiṣadham vidvadauṣadham” *, meaning “the *Naiṣadha*is as tonic for the intellect”, is often used to allude to its technically abstruse nature. Similarly, the verse *“tāvad* *bhā bhāraver bhāti yāvan māghasya nodayaḥ| udite naiṣadhe kāvye kva māgha kva ca* *bhāravi ∥” *, meaning “Bhāravi’s lustre shines bright till Māgha has risen. But of what account, truly, are Māgha and Bhāravi once the Naiṣadha has risen?” is frequently quoted to indicate the high poetic regard this work is held in. Also see footnote 130. The verse referenced here is the 62nd verse in the 6th canto. Given the age of the work, we should expect to see variations across editions. For instance, Śrīharṣa \[1912\] gives: *“candrābhamabhrantitilakandadhāna* *tadvannijāsyēndu kr̥tānubimbam | sakhīmukhēcandra samēsasarja candrānavasthāmiva* *kāpi yatra ∥” *, which exchanges the second and fourth quarters, compared to the version GaraḷapurīŚāstri was using, but the third quarter still matches GaraḷapurīŚāstri’s correction. 

The metre is *Upēndravajrā*. It is technically permissible to mix this metre with *Vaṁśastha* \(the mixed metre would be in the *Upajāti*class\). The mixed metre would clearly be inconsistent with the rest of the canto, however. 

solicited assistance from anyone. If ever the need arose for him to make a request of some person, he would, at some proper time, make his meaning known through a clever *ślōka*of his own composition. Thereby delighted, the person would fulfiil the Śāstri’s wishes unstintingly. Many people of lesser character would impose themselves on affluent patrons, and gain material benefiit by inducing a sense of obligation upon them. Garaḷapurī Śāstri could have gained enormous wealth, had this been his way. He commanded great respect from everyone, since he disdained all wealth thus acquired, and always remained uncovetous. 

Having been born into a family of high standing, he was high-minded, and always conducted himself honourably, regardless of material incentive to do otherwise. He was fully content with any generosity his patrons may have bestowed upon him, of their own accord. Indeed, he had also inherited land in suffiicient measure to allow him to live contentedly, imparting learning without expectation of remuneration, and rendering material support to others in need. 

He ensured that all special occasions and events in his household were celebrated with grandeur, matching the dignity and esteem that he and his family commanded. Despite such prosperity, the Śāstri lived modestly and without undue pride, conducting himself as a simple and pious *vaidika* brāhmaṇa, ever hard-working and virtuous, and earning great respect and acclaim from all quarters.
