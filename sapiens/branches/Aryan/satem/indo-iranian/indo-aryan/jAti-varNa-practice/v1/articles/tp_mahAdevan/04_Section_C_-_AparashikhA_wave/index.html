The Origins of the Aparaśikhā Brahmans, Their Śrauta Traditions and Their Arrival in the Tamil Country The outwardly distinguishing feature of the Aparaśikhā Brahmans, corresponding to the pūrvaśikhā of the Pūrvaśikhā Brahmans, is their aparaśikhā, “pin kuṭumi,” or back tuft in Tamil, as opposed to the “mun kuṭumi” or front tuft of the Pūrvaśikhās (Illustration 2; the illustration is a painting in the Panjab Hills school of the 16th century, precisely the area to which we will trace the Aparaśikhā group below.) Indeed, the aparaśikhā style is the ubiquitous mode now, in all of India, so much so that kuṭumi neutrally signifies the aparaśikhā mode, although in Sangam period, it did the pūrvaśikhā. As we saw, the ‘poetic code’ surrounding the representation of the kuṭumi in the Sangam poems clearly excludes the aparaśikhā mode.">

2; the illustration is a painting in the Panjab Hills school of the 16th century, precisely the area to which we will trace the Aparaśikhā group below.) Indeed, the aparaśikhā style is
the ubiquitous mode now, in all of India, so much so that kuṭumi neutrally signifies the
aparaśikhā mode, although in Sangam period, it did the pūrvaśikhā. As we saw, the
‘poetic code’ surrounding the representation of the kuṭumi in the Sangam poems clearly
excludes the aparaśikhā mode.</p>
<p>Unlike the case with the Pūrvaśikhā Brahmans, everything about the Aparaśikhā
Brahmans is grounded in recorded history: their arrival in the Tamil country is one of the
most meticulously recorded movements of human groups in history, especially
considering its time span, ca. from 4th to 14th centuries CE. Like the Pūrvaśikhā
Brahmans, they too brought with them live, if semi-literate, śrauta traditions to peninsular
India. Their Veda śākhās fall into the following groups:78</p>
<ul>
<li>i. Ṛgveda: Only the Śākhala śākhā of the Ṛgveda and its Āśvalāyana tradition are known among the Aparaśikhā Brahmans. The Kauṣītaki tradition of the Ṛgveda, the mainstay of the Pūrvaśikhā śruatism, is entirely unknown among them.</li>
<li>ii Yajurveda: Both the Kṛṣṇa and the Śukla Yajurveda śākhās, the latter both its Kāṇviya and Mādhyandina recensions, are attested among the Aparaśikhā Brahmans, although a śrauta tradition has not survived along the Śukla Yajurveda matrix. The Kṛṣṇa Yajurveda is entirely of the Taittirīya śākhā, attested in four schools, a minority Baudhāyana school and the prepossessingly dominant Āpastaṃba school and its two sister traditions, the Bhāradvāja and Hiraṇyakeśi (aka Śāṭyāṣāḍha) schools.</li>
<li>iii. Sāmaveda: Only the Kauthuma śākhā of the Sāmaveda is attested among the Aparaśikhā Brahmans, in its Drāhyāyana school.</li>
</ul>
<p>Of the above, the Śukla Yajurveda occurs only among the Aparaśikhā Brahmans in the
Tamil country.79 Likewise, the Āpastaṃba (along with the nearly identical Bhāradvāja
and Hiraṇyakeśi) and the Drāhyāyana traditions also occur only among the Aparaśikhā 50
Brahmans: these signify thus positive control with respect to the Aparaśikhā Brahmans in
epigraphy and fieldwork, just as the Kauṣītaki Ṛgveda, Vādhūla/Āgniveśya Yajurveda
and Jaiminīya Sāmaveda do for the Pūrvaśikhās. And as with the Pūrvaśikhā term
“paviḻiya” for the bahuvṛca tradition and ś/jāṃbavya for a branch of the Kauṣītaki
tradition, the term “pravacana” for the Baudhāyana tradition seems to be an exclusive
Aparaśikhā usage, in epigraphy (see below).</p>
<p>As a Śukla Yajurveda Śrauta tradition is not extant among the Aparaśikhā
Brahmans, the following four Śrauta matrices are possible among them:</p>
<ul>
<li>i. Āśvalāyana Ṛgveda-Baudhāyana Yajurveda-Drāhyāyana Sāmaveda</li>
<li>ii. Āśvalāyana Ṛgveda-Āpastaṃba Yajurveda-Drāhyāyana Sāmaveda</li>
<li>iii. Āśvalāyana Ṛgveda-Hiraṇyakeśi Yajurveda-Drāhyāyana Sāmaveda</li>
<li>iv. Āśvalāyana Ṛgveda-Bhāradvāja Yajurveda-Drāhyāyana Sāmaveda</li>
</ul>
<p>The second axis seems to be the near universal tradition extant among the
Aparaśikhā Brahmans, mostly in the agrahārams along the Kaveri river from
Tiruchirapalli to Tanjavur and onward to Kumbakonam.80 Key epigraphic records, as we
will see below, show that at least 70% of the Aparaśikhā Brahmans belong to the
Āpastaṃba tradition, the Yajurvedis as a whole forming possibly upto 90 per cent, and
they are the subjects of the Pallava-Cōḷa land grants in the villages along the Kaveri river.
This striking statistic helps us trace the Aparaśikhā group to the Mathurā regions
of the Yamunā River, to which the Āpastaṃba tradition has been localized.81 The region
would extend to the Hariyana area in the northwest (Map V) to the old Kuru area in the
north with its Kauthuma Sāmaveda, the Malva territory in the south and southeast. A
name that appears frequently in the Aparaśikhā epigraphic records is Daśapuriyan, after
the Malva city Daśapuri (also known as Mandasor). The Aparaśikhā emigration seems to
coincide in the main with the fall of the entire region first to the Huns (5th-6th centuries
CE) and the Muslims later, with widespread dispersion of the Brahmans of the area,
including the Daśapuri Brahmans.</p>
<p>Like the Pūrvaśikhā group, the Aparaśikhās also fall into several internal
divisions, not endogamous with one another till recent times and even today not fully so.
We know that this division goes back to the time—and place—of migration. Its first
attestation comes to us from the famous family history of Rāmānuja. His family was of
the “vaṭama” division, his preceptor’s that of “bṛhatcaraṇam” (as it happens, the two
principal and largest groups of the Aparaśikhā Brahmans) forcing, as we noted above,
Rāmānuja’s wife into a conduct unbecoming toward his guru and embarrassing
personally to him.82 That is, these divisions existed among the Aparaśikhā Brahmans
before their arrival in the Tamil country and they arrived as strangers, despite adherence
to common Veda śākhās. We will see that the Vaiṣṇava group, when it begins to emerge
as a separate group within Ramanuja’s life time, is made up almost entirely from the
Aparaśikhā group, all of the vaṭakalai group and 85% of the tenkalai, the balance of 15%
made up of the Pūrvaśikhā group, the Brahman element of the founders of Āḻvār-
Vaiṣṇavism.</p>
<p>I list here from Thurston (1909) the names of these divisions, from the most
numerous to the least as determined in my field work:83 i. the vaṭama; ii. the
bṛhatcaraṇam; iii. the aṣṭasahasram; iv. the vāttima; v. the prathamasākī. The first four
are all Taittirīya adherents, mostly its Āpastaṃba Sūtra; the last is made up entirely of
adherents of the Śukla Yajurveda in both its recensions, the Kāṇva and the Mādhyandina.</p>
<h2 id="c-ii-the-pallava-period-epigraphy-and-the-aparaśikhā-brahmans">C. ii. The Pallava Period Epigraphy and the Aparaśikhā Brahmans</h2>
<p>As I noted above, the first Aparaśikhā Brahman we can positively identify as one
may well be Jyeṣṭa Śarman of the Gautama gotra and group-specific Āpastaṃba Sūtra of
the Vēsantha (Jalapuram) Copper Plates of the Pallava King Simhavarman II, issued in
his 19th Regnal Year, in the 5th century CE, granting the village of Vēsantha to Jyeṣṭa
Śarman (Mahalingam 1983: 52-54; Item 7).84 The royal order is issued from
Kanchipuram (not perhaps the extant city of that name in the Tonṭaimaṇṭalam area of the
Tamil country85) to the “villagers of Vēsantha in Nādattapādi and to the Mahāmātras,
Adhyakṣas, Rājapuruṣas, and Cancarantas,” the oral order recorded by “Kulippoṭṭar, a
Rahasyādhikṛt”. The village lay still in the present Guntur district of southern Andhra
Pradesh, the northern reaches of Toṇṭaimaṇṭalam, in the east coast area between the
Pennār River in the north and the Pennaiyār river: this will include as Frasca (Map VI
after Frasca 1990: 3; Map 2) shows well-known centers like the state capital, the city of
Madras (also known as Chennai), Kanchipuram in the south and Tirupati and Nellur in
the north, the whole area containing islands of both Tamil and Telugu communities even
today.86 We already face here the Vēnkata hills, the northern boundary of the Tamil
country as recognized in the Sangam poems. The Kaveri delta lies still to the south, the
eventual destination of many of the Aparaśikhā Brahmans. Nāthamuni, the redactor of
the Āḻvār hymns, was born in Viṣṇunārāyaṇapuram ca. 11th century CE and Rāmānuja, in
the 13th century CE in Śrīperubendūr, three generations later in the same family lines,
both with signature Aparaśikhā Vedic affiliations, both still in the Toṇṭaimaṇṭalam
region.</p>
<p>For the Pallava period, we have data for some 467 Brahmans arriving into the
Tamil country, in 20 Copper Plate deeds that have survived, ranging from single families
as with Jyeṣṭa Śarman above, to 308 families of the Taṇṭamtōṭṭam Plates of Nandivarman
II, dated to his Regnal Year 33, 765-6 CE, with 108 families becoming interim the
standard complement in a grāmadeya. The happenchance discovery of the original
Copper plates,87 mostly unearthed by farmers tilling the land, suggests that the discovered
deeds constitute only a fraction of the total, as suggested by Burton Stein for the later
Cōḷa period.88 Of the 467 families, the Veda śākhās of 442 families are recorded in the
plates. The Veda śākhā breakdown of these immigrants is given in Table I:</p>
<ul>
<li>Āpastaṃba 274</li>
<li>Hiraṇyakeśi 18</li>
<li>Bhāradvāja 1</li>
<li>Pravacana 101</li>
<li>Āśvalāyana 7</li>
<li>Candogā 23</li>
<li>Kātyāyana 8</li>
<li>*Agniveśya 2</li>
<li>*Paviḷiya 4</li>
<li>*Jaiminīya 1</li>
<li>Kalarakha 2</li>
<li>Kaṭu 1</li>
<li>Goduma 2</li>
</ul>
<p>Table I: The Veda Śākhās of Pallava Aparaśikhās</p>
<p>The followers of the Āpastaṃba tradition constitute 62% of the total, the number
increasing to 66% if we include the closely related Hiraṇyakeśi and Bhāradvāja Sūtra
adherents, reaching 90% (including the prarvacana adherents) for the Yajurvedis as a
whole, giving rise eventually to the adage that every “house cat” in South India, as Witzel
notes (1995:335), can recite the Taittirīya Saṃhita. The backbone of the Aparaśikhā
Brahman group takes shape in this period, constituting close to 95% by the modern
period of the Tamil country, eventually coming to define the rubric “Tamil Brahman” for
the area.89 We do not know what Veda Sūtras the Kaḷarśa (also Kaḷarakha), Goduma
(also Godu), and Kaṭu signified.</p>
<p>The three starred items in Table 1 belong to the Pūrvaśikhā group, represented by
five families, identifiably so from their Veda śākhās (Jaiminīya, Āgniveśya and
“paviḻiya,” a corrupt form of Bahuvṛca but part of the Pūrvaśikha argot) although there
may have been some Pūrvaśikhā families in the Āśvalāyana group, the Baudhāyana
group excluding itself out, however, being all “pravacana,” the Aparaśikhā term for the
Baudhāyana tradition.90</p>
<p>The “paviḻiya” term for the bahuvṛca appellation is of exceptional interest: today,
as noted above, it occurs only among the Nambudiri Pūrvaśikhās, yet the four paviḻiya
families, at least two of them, are shown coming from the villages in southern Andhra
Pradesh (#23, Vaḍuga Śarma of Kāśyapa gotra from Nimbēi and #134, Dāmodarabhaṭṭa
of Garga gotra from Vaṅgippāṛu), both in the Toṇṭaimanṭalam area extending northward
into southern Andhra Pradesh, suggesting that the Pūrvaśikhās were present in areas
beyond the traditional boundaries of the Tamil country during the early era of the Pallava
regime. It is possible as well that the families were Śōḻiya Pūrvaśikhās, who regularly
share with the Nambudiris several rare Veda śākhās. The term occurs, designating a
Veda śākhā at NDP: 1611-12:
Candōgā! Pauḻiyā! Taittirīyā! Cāmavēdiyinē! neṭumālē<br>
Anto! ninnaṭiyanṛimaṟṟiyēn aḻuntūrmēlticainin ammānē</p>
<p>It is of interest in the above that there are two terms for the Sāmaveda: one Candogā, the
Aparaśikhā śākhā, beginning to be known in the Tamil county among the Brahmans
coming under the Pallava grāmadeya system and the other neutral Sāmaveda, possibly
designating the Jaiminīya śākhā of the Pūrvaśikhā Brahmans, being the Veda śākhā of
Maturakavi, one of the four Brahman Āḻvārs and the figure supplying the corpus
Nālāyiradivyaprabhadam to the Aparaśikhā Nāthamuni in the Vaiṣṇava tradition.</p>
<p>We must also note that the Pūrvaśikhā presence in the Pallava epigraphy is
practically non-existent, seven families of the total of 467, showing that they were not
part of the grāmadeya deeds, near autochthons by now in the Tamil country; it also marks
the relative eclipse of the group in the Tamil country, being reduced, as noted above, to a
small minority eventually. On the other hand, the epigraphy also shows that the
Aparaśikhā Brahmans are the group sponsored primarily and brought in by the Pallavas.
It would seem that the Pallavas adopted in return the Bhāradvāja gotra, the predominant
gotra of the Aparaśikhās, regularly attested upto 30% in some gotra samples I have
studied, leading to the Tamil saying, “half of Brahmans are Bhāradvājas” (“pāppānil pāti
pāratvācam”).91</p>
<p>A line (l. 198) in the Tanṭantōṭṭam Plates noted above reads: pārataṃ
vā[ci]ppānukku ppaṅgonrum (“one share for the Bhārata reader”)—in 789 CE. What
recension was read by this person in the temples? We do not know. Our hypothesis is
that the *Pūrvaśikhā text is in existence in the Tamil country at this time, as our Σ-text
facing the Sukthankar-σ-text. Did the epic, corresponding to the Sukthankar-σ text, come
with the Aparaśikhā Brahmans? I list below what would be a “learning quotient” of the
Aparaśikhā Brahmans from the Pallava grāmadeya deeds:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dvivedi 1</li>
<li>Trivedi 41</li>
<li>Caturvedi 129</li>
<li>Kramavittan 36</li>
<li>Ṣaḍaṅgavit 40</li>
<li>Somayājis 23</li>
<li>Vasantayāji 1</li>
<li>Sarvakratuyāji 3</li>
<li>Vājapeyi 1</li>
</ul>
<p>Table II: The Aparaśikhā Vedic Titles</p>
<p>It is true that titles, especially ones like caturvedi, are not always, as Louis Renou noted,
to be taken literally.92 Nevertheless, we have here (as with the Pūrvaśikhā Brahmans
earlier) a fairly elite group moving from one part of the country to another, and it stands
to reason that a Mahābhārata traveled with them, most likely, by the 8th century CE or
later, a vulgate Northern Recension text. The Aparaśikhā migration was to continue in
this fashion to well-nigh pre-modern times, the last deeds of the brahmadeyas occurring
in the Nāyaka period,93 giving us the veritable modern Tamil Brahman.
Yet the *Pūrvaśikhā text resident with the Śōḻiya Pūrvaśikhās in the Tamil
country as the Σ-text dictates the terms of reaction between it and the in-coming,
Sukthankar σ-text of the Aparaśikhā Northern Recension. It seems improbable at first
consideration, but as noted, it accords, on the other hand, perfectly well with the
development of the texts of the emerging Vaiṣṇava movement. As we have already
noted, the founding Āḻvār text, the NDP, begins its career, in part, with the Śōḻiya
Pūrvaśikhā’s Bhakti compositions in Tamil, depending upon the Mahabharata Σ-text,
specifically its Harivaṃśa, for its Kṛṣṇāism: it is these texts that are collected by the
Aparaśikhā immigrant, Nāthamuni, with the north Indian name Miśra still common in his
circles, and fashioned into the founding text of Śrīvaiṣṇavism (see below).
We do not have a similarly concrete narrative as regards the interaction between
northern and southern strands in the case of the Mahābhāratha. That is to say, we do not
have a Nāthamuni-like figure orchestrating the formation of the Tamil (Grantha)-Telugu
version of the epic. However, it would seem that the *Pūrvaśikhā text of the Śōḻiya
Pūrvaśikhās functioned like the Āḻvār compositions, providing the basis for the emerging
Tamil (Grantha)-Telugu versions of the Southern Recension, most likely, as I argue
below, in the Tanjavur Nāyaka courts.</p>
<h2 id="c-iii-the-cōḷa-period-epigraphy-and-the-aparaśikhā-brahmans">C. iii. The Cōḷa Period Epigraphy and the Aparaśikhā Brahmans</h2>
<p>When the Pallava imperium comes to an end in the first decades of the 10th
century CE—we need to remind ourselves (Mahalingam 1983: xxvii) that it began almost
with the Guptas, in the early 4th century, outlasting them by two centuries, indeed
reaching its apex with the long rule of Nandivarman II from 731 to 792, well after the
decline of the Gupta period in the north—the system of the grāmadeya passes on
seamlessly to the Cōḷa empire. The story that Burton Stein (1968; 1982) tells of the
Brahman alliance with the land-owning Vēḷḷāḷa group under the local, segmentary control
of the Cōḷa rule is essentially that of the Aparaśikhā Brahmans, and he estimates that
there were some 300 grāmadeya deeds in the Cōḷa period—with the rider about this being
a fraction of the original number. Champakalakshmi (2001) shows that the Cōḷa
brahmadeya system builds on the Pallava practice by designating certain brhmadeya units
as tankūṛu (taniyūr) as “separate unit[s] of political-economic significance from the early
tenth century [CE]” (65), a total of 22 such “rural-urban continuums” attested so far in
the Cōḷa realm.</p>
<p>All the same, it has not been noticed how strikingly similar the practice of the
Cōḷa period (ca. 900-1350 CE) is to that of the Pallava period:94 essentially the same
infrastructure supervises the same Aparaśikhā Brahmans, most, followers of the
Āpastaṃba Sūtra, entering the Tamil country from an immediate domicile in southern
Andhra Pradesh, and many more Daśapuriyans. Besides, the epigraphy clearly shows a
gradual increase in the numbers per deed of the Aparaśikhā Brahmans arriving in the
Tamil country, the earliest Pallava deeds being brahmadeya, in which the recipients of
the royal bounty are single families and later ones grāmadeya, in which a number of
families, eventually becoming 108, come to be settled in a village with various privileges
stipulated relating to taxes, water rights, access paths and other such matters—the entire
process achieving a greater level of sophistication and organization in the Cōḷa institution
of tankūṛu. And because their śrauta traditions place them in the Mathurā region in north-
central India, covering areas in the north in Hariyana and eastern Panjab, western
Rajastan and the entire Malva region in the south and east we can say that the era of the
Aparaśikhā migration begins with the arrival of the Huns in northwest South Asia (5th
century CE) and continues un-interrupted with the Islamic conquests. To be sure, in the
grāmadeya deeds, these Brahmans are also immediately from their domiciles in southern
Andhra Pradesh, but originating eventually in the northwest, in the Malva country and its
immediate northwest, the Eastern Panjab, the original Āpastaṃba home.
Not many of the Cōḷa Copper Plates have come to light yet, but one spectacular
find gives us three times the data of the entire Pallava epigraphy, the Karandai plates,
weighing in at nearly 250 pounds of copper and miraculously unearthed in a field in the
village of Puttūr in Papanāśam Taluk and Tanjavur District ca. 1920’s.95 Planned as a
grand grant to 1080 families by Rajendra I, the entire process lasting almost two years,
1019-1021 CE, Tribhuvanamahādāvic-caturvēdimaṅgalam, named for the king’s mother,
was made up from some 52 villages, covering a total area of 20,305 acres, almost the
entire southern part of today’s Papanasam Taluk in the south and extending to the
Mannargudi Taluk in the northeast of the Tanjavur district.
I give below the Veda śākhā distributions of the Brahmans of the Karandai Plates
in Table III below: 60</p>
<ul>
<li>Āpastaṃba 615</li>
<li>Hiraṇyakeśi 42</li>
<li>Bhāradvāja 11</li>
<li>Āgastya 29</li>
<li>Baudhāyana 54</li>
<li>*Āgniveśya 2</li>
<li>Āśvalāyana 154</li>
<li>*Ś/Jāmbavya 4</li>
<li>Drāhyāyana 77</li>
<li>*Jaiminīya 41</li>
<li>Kātyāyana 50</li>
</ul>
<p>Table III: The Veda Śākhās of the Karandai Plates Brahmans</p>
<p>Essentially this is the Aparaśikhā profile of the Pallava plates above. The
adherents of the Āpastaṃba Sūtra and related Sūtra traditions amount to 62% of the total,
almost the same ratio as with the Pallava grant. “Pravacana,” the Aparaśikhā term for
the Baudhāyana Sūtra, is absent here: the 54 Baudhāyana families could thus be from
either Aparaśikhā or Pūrvaśikhā group, as is the case with the 154 Āśvalāyana families.
We encounter a significant number of Vājanaseyi adherents, following the Kāṇva
recension of the white Yajurveda as well, 50, many of them carrying the title
kramavittan—trained to recite the birth Veda upto the krama vikṛti level. The Agastya
Sūtra designates a Yajurveda tradition and seems to be confined to the Aparaśikhā
Brahmans96</p>
<p>On the other hand, the starred items are signature Pūrvaśikhā sūtras: 47 families
of the 1080, all moving from the western parts of the Tamil country to the eastern parts.</p>
<p>Here we note a new Pūrvaśikhā Veda sūtra, the Ś/Jāṃbavya, a close branch of the
Kauṣītaki Ṛgveda tradition (Oldenberg 1884; Gonda 1977: 606)97 with four followers.
Considering the date of the Karandai Plates (1029-31 CE), it is most probable that the
Jāṃbavya Sūtra of the Ṛgveda would be found among the Tamil Pūrvaśikhās, almost
certainly among the Śōḻiya Brahmans.98</p>
<p>We should note as well that the Pūrvaśikhā Brahmans of the Karandai Plates are
not domiciled in the villages of the southern Andhra Pradesh: it will be recalled that the
four “paviḻiya” adherents of the Pallava Plates, almost three centuries earlier, were from
the Toṇṭaimaṇṭalam area. The bulk of the Aparaśikhā Brahmans of the Plates, as
Krishnan notes with emphasis, are also from this area.99 On the other hand, the 41
Jaiminīya Brahmans of the Karandai Plates—the Brahmans that we can unambiguously
identify as Śōḻiya Brahmans as with the Jambavya and Āgniveśya adherents&ndash;come from
the following domiciles, all recognizably of the Tamil country: Kōṭṭaiyūr: 2; Emappērūr:
1; Ādanūr:7; Palurūr:1; Puḷḷamaṅgalam 10; Marudūr 2; Pulvāvūr 1; Tiṭṭakuṭi:2;
Iṭaiyāṟṟukuṭi:5; Māruṇdūr:4; Anbil: 3; Nāraṇamaṅgalam: 1; Cātthamaṅgalam:1;
Aruvalam: 1. Moreover, as noted already, some of the adherents of the Āśvalāyana and
Baudhāyana Sūtras may also be Pūrvaśikhās, indeed cohorts of the Jaiminīyas, as several
of them are from the same Tamil villages as the Jaiminīya Śōḻiyas.</p>
<p>All the same, the dominance of the signature Aparaśikhā Veda śākhās, already
clear in the Pallava period, is even greater in the Karandai Plates: more than 800 belong
to Veda śākhās recognizable as those of the Aparaśikhā group. The largest single group,
at 615, is made up of the adherents of the Āpastaṃba Sūtra, with another 33, of the
closely related Hiraṇyakeśi and Bhāradvāja. The 77 Drāhyāyana adherents represent a
robust Aparaśikhā Sāmaveda tradition, no doubt the back bone of the Aparaśikhā
Śrautism attested in the Plates, a strength that is still extant among the Aparaśikhā
Brahmans in the Tanjavur-Kumbakonam area.</p>
<p>Some 500 families, all following the signature Aparaśikhā Veda śākhās, carry the
last name daśapuriyan, derived from the city of that name in Malva, increasing from its
30 occurrences out of the Pallava total of 467, pointing to the origins of the Aparaśikhā
group in north-central and northwestern regions, along the Narmadā, Chambal, and
Yamunā banks.</p>
<p>As for the Pallava Brahmans, I give in Table 4 a breakdown of the “learning
quotient” of the Karandai Brahmans:</p>
<p>-Trivedi 1</p>
<ul>
<li>Caturvedi 2</li>
<li>Ṣaḍaṅgavit 4</li>
<li>Kramavittan 118</li>
<li>Āhitāgni 4</li>
<li>Somayāji 28</li>
<li>Kāṭaka- Somayāji 3</li>
<li>Vasantayāji 3</li>
<li>Kāṭaka- Sarvakratu Vasantayāji 1</li>
<li>Sarvakratu 1</li>
<li>Agnicittayāji 2</li>
<li>Vājapeyi 1</li>
<li>Atirātran 1</li>
<li>Sahasran 151</li>
</ul>
<p>Table IV: The Learning Quotient of the Karandai Families</p>
<p>There are almost 50 Śrautins in the group (of which 5 are identifiably
Pūrvaśikhās, being Jaiminīyas, of a total of 41 [12.5%], indicating a robust śrauta
tradition among the Śōḻiya Pūrvaśikhās in the 11th century CE; the one Atirātran may also
be a Pūrvaśikhā Brahman, this being the term still in use among the Nambudiri
Pūrvaśikhās to signify a ritualist who has performed the Agnicayana), with another 118
Brahmans who can recite the Vedas upto the krama vikṛti. In other words, the in-coming
Aparaśikhā Brahmans continue to be drawn from the same elite levels as in the Pallava
period, a trend that is to continue, further justifying the assumption that a version of
Mahābhārata epic, almost certainly a Vulgate text by now, came with them.</p>
<h2 id="c-iv-the-emergence-of-the-aparaśikhā-śrīvaiṣṇavism">C. iv. The Emergence of the Aparaśikhā Śrīvaiṣṇavism</h2>
<p>One way to approach the development of the eventual Tamil (Grantha)-Telugu
Mahābhārata of the Aparaśikhās is to approach it in the perspective of a precedent. Such
a precedent exists in the formation of the texts and traditions of the mature Śrīvaiṣṇavism
by the Aparaśikhā Brahmans from the Āḻvār songs, collected in the
Nālāyiradivyaprabhandham by an Aparaśikhā Brahman. This is, as noted earlier, the
famous Nāthamuni, generally thought to have been born in 11th century, in
Vīranārāyaṇapuram, very much the village of the Pallava-Cōḷa epigraphy, perhaps a first
generation Aparaśikhā immigrant, among, as noted above, people still with the northern
name, Miśra (Carman 1973: 24).100 Once hearing a decad of the still uncollected NDP
the pāsuram, Āravamudē (3194) by singers from the “west” (the traditional Cōḷa area
along the Kaveri river west from Nāthamuni’s Vīranārāyaṇapuram in the relatively
northern and eastern Toṇṭaimaṇṭalam-Arcot area, the region of the Śōḻiya Pūrvaśikhās
who supply all the Brahman Āḻvārs), tradition has it that Nāthamuni seeks out and
collects the songs into the extant text, the Nālāyiradivyaprabhandam, setting it besides to
music, inaugurating the great performance tradition of the aṛaiyars in the Viṣṇu temples
of Tamil Nadu. And the figure from whom he is able to collect the 4000-verse long text
is Maturakavi, a Jaiminīya Sāmavedi and hence unambiguously a Pūrvaśikhā Brahman.
However, and this is the other half of the reaction, tradition has him also bring to
the Āḻvār Vaiṣṇavism northern texts and practices as well (the counterpart of the
Sukthankar σ-text), as set forth in his Nyāya Tatva and Yoga Rahasya, laying the
foundation through his grandson and disciple, Yāmuna, to the Pañcarātra-Āgama
tradition (Carmen 1973: 25), the entire line of development culminating in Rāmānuja,
Yāmuna’s grandson. We know that Rāmānuja belonged to the signature Aparaśikhā
sūtra of Āpastaṃba, belonging in addition, as noted above, to the vaṭama group, hailing
from Śriperumbedur, in the Tonṭaimaṇṭalam area, near Kanchipuram and a descendant of
Nāthamuni on his mother’s side.101</p>
<p>I noted above that the Bhāgavata Purāṇa is a literary expression of this religious
synthesis. Dated to ca. 9th century CE, very much in the period of Nāthamuni, the
Bhāgavata Purāṇa incorporates, as Dihejia shows,102 many elements of the Āḻvār
Vaiṣṇavism, but addressing at the same time an extra-Tamil audience, in the north, still
no doubt a place historical memory for many Aparaśikhās, with Nāthamuni himself going
to Mathurā on a long sojourn and coming back to the peninsula only when compelled by
a vision of the deity of his natal village commanding him to return (Carman: 24-25).
Indeed, when the great Śrīvaiṣṇava schism into “vaṭakalai” (northern) and “tenkalai”
(southern) occurs in the post-Rāmānuja period, the vaṭakalai branch is seen to be made up
of entirely Aparaśikhā Brahmans, with Tirupati in the north, outside the northern
boundary of the modern state of Tamil Nadu, as its center, with the tenkalai school,
located in the south, in Śrī Rangam, Śrīvilliputhūr and Āḷvārtirunagarī, orienting itself to
the Āḻvār Vaiṣṇavism and Tamil, its language. The tenkalai branch is made up both of
the Aparaśikhā and the Śōḻiya Pūrvaśikhās, the latter less than 15% of the smaller tenkalai
group and relegated to a low social status among the Śrī Vaiṣṇavas, although originally
among the founders of Āḻvār-Vaiṣṇavism.103</p>
<h2 id="c-v-the-tamil-grantha-and-telugu-versions-of-the-mahābhārata">C. v. The Tamil (Grantha) and Telugu versions of the Mahābhārata</h2>
<p>It is in the perspective of the above precedent that we must approach the
formation of the Tamil (Grantha)-Telugu versions of the Mahābhārata. In both cases, we
have a resident tradition hosting an immigrant tradition, giving rise to broader and larger
developments in both cases, the Bhāgavatapurāṇa in the Vaiṣṇava tradition, the summum
bonum of the Śrīvaiṣṇava precedent, and the Tamil (Grantha)-Telugu versions of the
Mahābhārata, its epic counterpart. However, as we noted, we have very little concrete
information about the precise details of how the Tamil (Grantha)-Telugu versions of the
epic developed: we do not have the equivalent of an iconic figure like Nāthamuni of the
Vaiṣṇava tradition, the figure who weaves the southern Āḻvār and the northern Pañcarātra,
its σ-text, into Śrīvaiṣṇavism of the Tamil country through Yāmuna first and Rāmānuja
thence. It is quite possible that the Villipputhūr Mahābhārata represents a stage in the
development of the Tamil (Grantha)-Telugu Mahābhārata. Śrī Villipputhur is
traditionally a Pūrvaśikhā agrahāram, the birth place of Periyāḷvār and Āṇdāḷ, two of the
four Pūrvaśikhā Brahman Āḻvārs. The author of the Tamil translation of the epic is
named after the village and traditionally considered to be a Śrī Vaiṣṇava Brahman, and
dated to the Tamil Middle Ages (12th to 13th CE) although we do not know if he was a
Pūrvaśikhā or the Aparaśikhā type.104 We know that the Villipputhūr text served as the
fundamental source for the Tamil kūthu repertory, in the non-Brahman circles.105 Being a
center of the emerging Śrīvaiṣṇavism, second perhaps only to Śri Rangam, being in
regular contact with this bigger center, Śrī Villipputhur may well have been the center of
reaction between the two recensions in the Tamil country, with the final phases of it
occurring in the Nāyaka period, in the 16th -17th centuries, as P.P.S.Sastri pointed out, in
his Southern Recension edition of the Mahābhārata,106 made from pretty much the same
Tamil(Grantha)-Telugu manuscripts of the Sarasvatī Mahāl Library of Tanjavur that went
to Poona for the collation and preparation of the Critical Edition.</p>
<h2 id="c-vi-the-grantha-and-telugu-mahābhārata-and-the-poona-critical-edition">C. vi. The Grantha and Telugu Mahābhārata and the Poona Critical Edition</h2>
<p>We have from the first half of the 16th century a kāvya work titled
Viśvāguṇadarśacampū107 by a Veṅkatādhvarin, identified as “an orthodox Śrī Vaiṣṇava
Tamil Brahman” (Rao et al 1992: 1) with his name ādhvarin deriving from adhvaryu, the
main śrauta priest and belonging to the Yajurveda. Purporting to be an aerial journey
over the Tamil country by two gāndharvas, conversing between them on the earthly
sights below, the poem is an objective representation of the final Aparaśikhā ‘possession’
of the Tamil country, an aerial map literally laid over the territory of the Pallava-Cōḻa and
subsequent grāmadeya epigraphy about the Aparaśikhā Brahmans. The gāndharvas begin
their peninsular journey at the Karnataka Aparaśikhā centers at Udupi and Melkote and,
flying due east to Tirupati, the most important, by the time of the poem, vaṭakalai, and
thus all-Aparaśikhā, center of Tamil Śrīvaiṣṇavism, they turn southward and retrace the
path of the Aparaśikhā immigration, covering the entire region of the Pallava and Cōḷa
epigraphy, starting with Kanchipuram in the northeast, coming to the Kaveri river banks
stretching from Śri Rangam through Tanjavur to Kumbakonam in the east, the Tanjavur-
Kumabakonam-Mannarkode area, and south to the Tāṃṛavarṇī delta (Map V after Map 1
in Rao [1992] et al.) The gāndharvas notice the author’s village, Vīkṣāraṇya, not far from
Ramanuja’s village at Sriperumbudūr, both in all likelihood villages of the Pallava-Cōḻa
gramadeya system, a system the Nāyakas continued.
We know that poets like Venkatādhvarin above found patronage with the Nāyaka
chieftains, the latter, Telugu-speaking, coming south to the Tamil country with the
dissolution of the Vijayanagara empire, and establishing themselves as rulers there, the
“little kings” eventually with “hollow crowns”.108 Indeed Veṅkatādhvarin is himself
linked to the Señji Nāyakas, and his poem partakes of what has been identified with the
Nāyaka ethos, centering around the theme of the “unknown, unpedigreed warrior who
fights his way into power and a kingdom of his own” (Rao et al. 1992: 7). Moreover, the
Nāyaka courts produced “an enormous corpus of Sanskrit works, reflect[ing] the
accumulated erudition of late medieval south India” (336), altogether a fitting
environment for what P.P.S.Sastri has called the “Nāyaka excesses” of the Grantha-
Telugu Mahābhārata.</p>
<p>This is particularly true in the case of Tanjavur, which by all account went
through a brief renaissance—beginning thus a journey toward the eventual capital of
Brahmanical culture of the Tamil country&ndash;under its three Nāyaka kings, Accutappa
Nāyaka (1564-1612), his son Raghunātha Nāyaka (1600-1634) and his son
Vijayarāghava Nāyaka (1631-1673). The famous Govinda Dīkṣita begins his career as
the King’s Minister with the first of the three Nāyakas, providing tutelage and a splendid
education for the middle Nāyaka, a Renaissance prince in every respect,109 and his son,
Yagnanārāyaṇa Dīkṣita, continuing his father’s cultural and artistic leadership. The
Tanjavur court was the host to many poets and musicians, with Raghunātha Nāyaka
actually fashioning the extant vīṇa of the Carnatic musical tradition. As Krishnasvami
Aiyangar (1941: [II] 296), a 20th century descendant from the grāmadeya village of the
third Nāyaka&ndash;called at the time of the grant Raghunāthapuram in honor of his father but
now Śakkoṭṭai&ndash;notes, Raghunātha Nāyaka “held a competition among the ladies of the
court, several of [whom] could compose poetry in the four kinds. They were also expert
in resolving curious literary puzzles. Some of them could compose hundred verses in “an
hour” and write poetry in eight languages. One lady of the court by name
Rāmabhadrāmba was accorded first place in this and was installed as the “empress
among poets” (sāhityasāmrājya) which probably involved the honor of kanakābhiṣeka
(bathing [sic] in gold)”. Thus we have every reason to think that the Tanjavur court
functioned as a nursery for the Tamil (Grantha)-Telugu versions of the Southern
Recension, with their inflationary excesses.</p>
<p>We must note that Tanjavur’s famed Sarasvatī Mahāl Library, the final source110
of the manuscripts of the Tamil (Grantha) and Telugu Mahābhārata for the Poona editors
began its life as the Sarasvatī Bhandār in the early 17th century under Raghunātha
Nāyaka. This tradition of scholarship and respect for the arts continued after the
Maharashtrian take-over of Tanjavur in late 17th century, in 1674 CE, with Sarasvatī
Bhandār metamorphosing into the Sarasvatī Mahāl Library and acquiring vast numbers of
manuscripts from Benares, under Serfoji II, during his famous pilgrimage to the holy city
in 1832 with a retinue exceeding 3000. True, some Maharashtrian Brahmans came to
Tanjavur with the Maharashtrian conquest and rule, but there is little doubt that the city’s
intellectual and cultural life was entirely the creation of the Aparaśikhā Brahmans, long
prepared for their eminent role through the historical processes described by Burton Stein
(1982). A roll call would include such names as Appayya Dīkṣitar (1520-1593); Govinda
Dīkṣita and his son, Yagnanārāyaṇa Dīkṣita; and later, the musical trinity of composers of
the Carnatic music, all from Tanjavur, all anecdotally Aparaśikhā Brahmans. In all
likelihood, the final form of the Tamil (Grantha) and Telugu Mahābhārata takes shape in
this period, 16th to 17th centuries, CE.</p>
