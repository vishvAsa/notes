An anecdote by the late Ki. Va. Jagannathan on his legendary guru, shrI U. Ve Swaminatha Iyer, who literally knocked on thousands of home doors in TN to obtain the sangam manuscripts in precarious states, decipher & publish them in printed form before they could be lost forever.

Since he is in the position of an AcArya, it is not wrong to pay reverence to him as a mANuSya-matsyadeva who revived the veda from the ocean-bed. shrI Ki. Va Ja's anecdote gives an insight into his character as well. A picture of U. Ve Sa reading his obtained manuscripts.

shrI Ki. Va Ja speaks of how his guru (shrI U. Ve Sa) would take a morning walk around the shiva temple (tiruvETTIshvarar at Chepauk) & on his way back home, he will buy idlis from the old lady at the street corner for the Rickshaw riders! As he bought the idlis for the rickshaw riders who would crowd around him to ask him to buy for them, the old lady would say to him, "magarAsan nallA irukkanam" (maharAja (a term of affection) should be well/happy).

Born as a bhUSaNa of the aSTasahasra division of the tamizh smArta brAhmaNas, he studied tamizh under the great vidvAn, shrI mInAkSI sundaram piLLai & was very close to many of the shaiva maThas. Endowed with both knowledge & godliness, he manifested immeasurable tejas.

One can only hope that his legacy continues to inspire tamizh people to pursue that old, great tamizh heritage of scholarship combined with devotion; intellectual refinement as part & parcel of spiritual edification. Unfortunately, the less said about this hope, the better.

## Ingratitude
The best way (for tamizh Hindus) to show your gratitude to shrI U. Ve Sa's legendary efforts is to read the sangam texts he struggled so much to retrieve & revive for posterity; even giving commentaries for a few. 

We are so lucky to have these texts online. For free. But what does the average tamizh youth do? Especially those with proper homes & decent facilities. Garbage movies; degenerate TV shows....168 hours in a week & not even 3 or even just 2 can be spent for reading.

At least in TN, Tamizh children should have been given an education that enriches them with knowledge & an appreciation of such luminaries & legends as role-models.

It was the evil genius of the Dravidianists to not only destroy the communities which historically contributed to the edification of the tamizh mind & intellect but also destroy any inclination whatsoever of all tamizhs to learn transforming a whole race into a profoundly anti-intellectual, cinema-loving, alcohol-addicted, retarded human baboons.

Speaking of the legend's works; his blood, sweat & tears (that is, tears of joy at finding those precious manuscripts), they are all here:

- If you are blessed enough to be able to read daiva (godly) tamizh, please honor him by at least checking it out. Source: [TW](https://archive.org/details/Religion-U.Ve.Sa.LibraryBooks)
- As list in previous link doesn't contain all of his sangam publications, I link them here, individually. Most important imho is the puRa-nAnURu ("outer" 400; 'puRam' in tamizh means "outer", referring to themes like war, cattle raids, kingly feasts, etc): Source: [TW](https://archive.org/details/Tamil-Purananuru-U-Ve-Sa-3rd-Edition-1935)
- The kuRuntokai (kuRu-short, tokai-collection), like the puRanAnURu, is one of the "eight collections" (eTTu-tokai), a body of works in sangam literature:
