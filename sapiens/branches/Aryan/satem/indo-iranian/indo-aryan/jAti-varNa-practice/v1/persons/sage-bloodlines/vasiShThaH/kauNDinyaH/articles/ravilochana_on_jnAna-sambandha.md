730-746CE (Ravilochana)

Conversion of pANDya (neDumAran) - see : [TW](/notes/sapiens/branches/Aryan/satem/indo-iranian/indo-aryan/jAti-varNa-practice/v2/persons/pANDya/articles/ravilochana-dates)

## jainas
mentions 11 jaina ascetics by name – Candusenan, Indusenan, Dharmasenan, Kandusenan, Kanaksenan, Kanakanandi, Pushpanandi, Pavananandi, Kumanama-sunakanandi, Gunakanandi and Divananandi. Of these Pushpanandi, Kanankanandi, Pavanandi (Pavananandi of the Tevaram?)and Gunanandi (Gunakanandi of the Tevaram?) are mentioned in the Kalugumalai Jain bed inscriptions which are dated to the second half of 8th century.

## paranjyotiSh Siruthondar
Sambandar was a contemporary of paranjyotiSh, who was general in the Pallava army and then he became a Siruthondar Nayanmar. Tiruchangattangudi he is mentioned.

### vAtApi invasion
Periyapuranam is supposed to be in the 12th century. It says that he was a person called Paranjothi who took part in the Pallava attack on Vatapi. Vatapi was destroyed by Narasimhavarman in 642.

There were actually two invasions of Vatapi. The second invasion happened sometime after 690. 

In 687 there is a copper plate grant which is given by the then Pallava ruler Parameshwara Varma Pallava who was a Shaiva. He defeated Vikramaditya Chalukya. Parameshwara Pallava mentions about his defeat of Vikramaditya. But he doesn't mention about any invasion of Vatapi.

Whereas his son Rajasimha in his inscription calls his father as Rana-rasika-pura mardhana (Ranarasika was the name of Vikramaditya. So Ranarasikapura is his capital Vatapi).

if at all we have to accept Siruthondar as someone who invaded Vatapi, it should be in this period. +++(Since it would fit with neDumAran being converted by jnAnasambandha.)+++

## appAr navukkarasar
As per hagiography, Appar was elderly in age when Sambandar had his upanayanam (sacred thread ceremony). Sambandar is dated to circa 730-746CE. Appar’s birth would have been circa 670CE. 

Such date would also explain the hagiography claim about a northern invasion when he was a boy. In 674CE, Vikramaditya I Chalukya had invaded Pallava empire and had reached the banks of Kaveri after conquering Kanchi.

Now, why don't you apply the same logic (applied to tirumalisai being contemporary of Mahendravarman guNabharan: [TW](/notes.sapiens/branches/Aryan/satem/indo-iranian/indo-aryan/jAti-varNa-practice/v1/persons/abrAhmaNAH/articles/ravilochana_tirumalisai)) to Appar? Appar refers to Shiva as Rajasimha. Rajasimha was a title used only by Rajasimha Pallava who came after 700. So bring Appar to 700. Paranjothi also lived in the same 700s. Sambandar lived sometime in the 700s as well.



### Mahendravarman theory
Appars story says that he converted a pallava who was named gunadharan. Periya puranam said gunadharan only. But post 1950s, recent editions have changed it to gunabharan in conjunction with this identification

Mahendravarman Pallava was (supposedly) the person who was converted by appAr - Based on that one inscription in Trichy Source: [TW](https://archive.org/details/in.gov.ignca.79590/page/n43/mode/1up). It is not a proper interpretation of the shloka -  

> गुण-भर-नामनि राजन्य्  
> अनेन लिङ्गेन लिङ्गिनि।  
> ज्ञानम् प्रथतां चिराय  
> लोके विपक्षवृत्तेः परावृत्तम् ॥ 
> 
> While the king called Gunabhara is a worshipper of the linga, let the knowledge, which has turned back from hostile (vipaksha) conduct, be spread for a long time in the world by this linga !

As for the Pallava who supposedly tried to persecute Appar, it must have been a vassal named Gunadhara from a collateral branch who ruled Cuddalore region.

## mAhapadma-nanda
Till 1920s, saiba scholars claimed that sambandar lived as contemporary to mahapadma nanda. As in a pathigam he says naTTaar naDuve nandan Ala.
