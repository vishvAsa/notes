Conversion of pANDya (neDumAran) - see : [TW](/notes/sapiens/branches/Aryan/satem/indo-iranian/indo-aryan/jAti-varNa-practice/v2/persons/pANDya/articles/ravilochana-dates)

## paranjyotiSh
Sambandar was a contemporary of paranjyotiSh, who was general in the Pallava army and then he became a Siruthondar Nayanmar. Tiruchangattangudi he is mentioned.

### vAtApi invasion
Periyapuranam is supposed to be in the 12th century. It says that he was a person called Paranjothi who took part in the Pallava attack on Vatapi. Vatapi was destroyed by Narasimhavarman in 642.

There were actually two invasions of Vatapi. The second invasion happened sometime after 690. 

In 687 there is a copper plate grant which is given by the then Pallava ruler Parameshwara Varma Pallava who was a Shaiva. He defeated Vikramaditya Chalukya. Parameshwara Pallava mentions about his defeat of Vikramaditya. But he doesn't mention about any invasion of Vatapi.

Whereas his son Rajasimha in his inscription calls his father as Rana-rasika-pura mardhana (Ranarasika was the name of Vikramaditya. So Ranarasikapura is his capital Vatapi).

if at all we have to accept Siruthondar as someone who invaded Vatapi, it should be in this period. +++(Since it would fit with neDumAran being converted by jnAnasambandha.)+++

## appAr
Jnanasambandar and Appar were contemporaries. 

Now, why don't you apply the same logic (applied to tirumalisai being contemporary of Mahendravarman guNabharan: [TW](/notes.sapiens/branches/Aryan/satem/indo-iranian/indo-aryan/jAti-varNa-practice/v1/persons/abrAhmaNAH/articles/ravilochana_tirumalisai)) to Appar? Appar refers to Shiva as Rajasimha. Rajasimha was a title used only by Rajasimha Pallava who came after 700. So bring Appar to 700. Paranjothi also lived in the same 700s. Sambandar lived sometime in the 700s as well.



### Mahendravarman theory
Mahendravarman Pallava was (supposedly) the person who was converted by appAr. Based on that one inscription in Trichy (VV also agreed that it is not a proper interpretation of the shloka). 

so everything is dependent on some of these matching things that they have done and all of them are nothing but a pack of cards.
