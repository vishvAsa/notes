He's an archaic author being the composer of much of maNDala 4 of the RV. In the purANa-s:

1. in a version of the shivapurANa he narrates the AkhyAna-s of skanda & gaNesha. Thus, it is indeed apt here that he is mentioned as worship gaNesha.
2. In the gaNesha purANa he curses a gandharva to become a rat, which dwells in rAma bhArgava's Ashrama causing much trouble. This rat is brought under control by gaNesha & made his vAhana
