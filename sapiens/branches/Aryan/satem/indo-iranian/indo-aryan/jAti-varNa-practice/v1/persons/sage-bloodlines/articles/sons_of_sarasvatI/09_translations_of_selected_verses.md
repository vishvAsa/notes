Translation:

They catch not even the faintest smell of suggestiveness. The art of bringing sound and sense together is foreign to them. They have never fiigured out the various fiigures of speech. Words splendidly infused with aesthetic sentiments are unknown to them. And just because they have sprouted some fame, these poetasters, greedier with every passing moment, dare drag you into wrong paths. You are doomed, O divine Muse.

Poverty, my ever-youthful sweetheart, kisses me and leaves me insane enough to compose poetry. I am the subject of universal ridicule. Is there anyone at all who could look at me and yet not feel pity?

811 *Dōhada*is a ritual performed by ladies so trees may bring forth flowers. The notion is that trees, like pregnant women, have desires that must be fulfiilled \(also see footnote 627\). 

The Aśoka, for instance, is said to crave a kick from the bejeweled feet of beautiful maidens. See Kālidāsa’s *Uttaramegha,*18 *: “raktāśokaścalakisalaya kesarascātra kāntaḥ| pratyā-sannau kurabakavr̥termādhavīmaṇḍapasya ∥ ekaḥsakhyāstava saha mayā vāmapadābhilāṣī*

I salute the goddess of speech. She, the beloved wife of Brahma, is the moonlight which puts to bloom night lilies in the form of the various sciences and the pearl ornament that adorns the crest of embodied *Vēdic*lore.

*Bhāgavatasaptāha*Invitation and Garaḷapurī śāstri’s Response

*Vidvān*ḤV. Nagaraja Rao

Letter from Veṇk ōba Rāv and Rāmacandra Rāv to Mais ūru. 

\(An invitation to the *paṇḍitas*to attend the *Bhāgavatasaptāha*celebration to take place in Mahārāṣtra. *The first 22 ślōkas of the letter of the invitation* *have been lost. *\)

... 

A great *yajña*in the form of reading the *Bhāgavata*is to be held shortly in the vicinity of a beautiful mansion. This will be a rare event, which will surely bring the grace of God. 

∥23∥

This auspicious event, which will be wonderful and attractive in the extreme, should be witnessed by one and all. In it will be an assembly of brāhmaṇas reciting holy texts. 

∥24∥

We are hence requesting you, with folded hands and bowed heads, and urge you to come here and stay with us for seven days. 

∥25∥

Great persons will participate in this assembly of scholars, in which the story of Lord Kr̥ṣṇa will be presented in melodious tunes, highlighting its deep meanings. 

∥26∥

May all of you, desirous of imbibing the nectarine sweetness of the *Bhāgavata,*kindly drop the pollen of your lotus feet on the floor of our residence. 

∥27∥

Do please all of you arrive before the commencement of the event, and stay here till its end, relishing the ambrosia of the story of the Lord. 

∥28∥

If, however, time does not permit, you may visit us for a day, a minute, or even half an instant, for there is surely nothing else that will bring us such prosperity. 

∥29∥

As the *Śrīmad Bhāgavata*itself says: “To what end are many years spent without an awareness of Lord Kr̥ṣṇa? Even a single hour will bring all prosperity, if one knows in it God’s greatness. 

∥30∥

“For anyone who has entered into this cycle of birth and death, there is no path other than that of devotion. 

∥31∥

“They who drink the divine nectar of Kr̥ṣṇa’s story will purify the people whose hearts are spoiled by the taint of worldly objects of trivial pleasure. Such good persons will also reach the lotus feet of Lord Kr̥ṣṇa. ∥32∥

“The sun robs the lifespan of all beings when he rises and sets, except in those moments spent eulogising the stories of good persons.” 

∥33∥

What is the use of talking or writing too much? O, enjoyers of the study of the *Vēdas\! *

∥34∥

You are all learned scholars, and your dispositions are generous. The two of us are trying to accomplish a diffiicult task. Do make our tree of desire bear fruit. 

∥35∥

All those who covet various benefiits in this world will surely obtain them from the wish-yielding tree known as the *Bhāgavata.*In this there is no doubt\! 

∥36∥

Please do accept our prayerful invitation, and come. We wish to be blessed by you, the connoisseurs \(of the wine of the *Bhāgavata*\). 

∥37∥

Sirs, may you virtuous scholars kindly pardon us if we have written anything that may be erroneous or contrary to tradition, due to our haste or impetuosity.

Garaḷapurī śāstri’s reply to the above invitation

*We bow to Kr̥ṣṇa, the beloved of the cowherdesses. *

May Lord Kr̥ṣṇa, who enhances love in Rukmiṇī’s heart, who kindles the fiire of desire in Satyabhāma, who is intoxicated from drinking the juice of Jāṁbavatī’s lips, whose mind is ever in the control of Rādhā, whose eyes are riveted on Ṉīlā’s blouse, and who is a natural servant of the cowherdesses, protect us. 

∥1∥

May the world be peaceful, and may all righteous people be happy. May all works of such good persons be free of obstacles. 

∥2∥

There is a city known as Mais ūru, which is the capital and jewel of the state of Karṇāṭaka. Its prosperity puts even Heaven to shame. 

∥3∥

There shone king Kr̥ṣṇarāja; he was indefatigable and most virtuous. 

He was as the full moon to the ocean of scholars at his court. He was as Hariścandra in keeping his word. 

∥4∥

He was born of the powers of the Lords of Directions. He protected all his people with love as that of a father. 

∥5∥

Now Cāmarāja, who is like a reflection of his predecessor, is looking after the scholars, with even greater love. 

∥6∥

The scholars are engaged in realizing the Indescribable Principle by the means of listening to and memorizing the hidden meanings of the *Upaniṣa-ds. *

∥7∥

They have gained expertise in the eighteen branches of learning, putting their rivals to shame. Even so, these scholars remained untainted even by the slightest bit of arrogance. 

∥8∥

These scholars wear pearl necklaces strung with strong threads, and live in *agrahāras*donated by the king Kr̥ṣṇa, and which are free from diseases, possess the best qualities, and exhibit excellent characteristics.812

∥9∥

812This interesting verse contains a series of cleverly crafted puns. Mr Naresh Keerthi offers the following: “The scholars wear and reside in that *agrahāra *\[necklace/community\], which is a gift from king Kr̥ṣṇa, *muktāmaya *\[pearl-studded/healthy\], *sugraha-guṇāḍhya*

These scholars take pleasure in beautiful poetry suffused with emotions, and in which refusal may signify assent, just as they relish the compan-ionship of a wife who conveys assent through words that appear to assert refusal. 

∥10∥

Just as a bee sucks nectar from a flower, leaving behind its pollen, these scholars see only good qualities in others, omitting their flaws. 

∥11∥

The blessings of these scholars, following prayers and worship offered to Viṣṇu, Śiva, and other gods, and accompanied by *Vēdic*recitations are showered upon the two of you. 

∥12∥

You two possess wealth in measure fiit for kings, and like the mountains Mēru and Himālaya, remain steadfast, without trembling in crises. 

∥13∥

You two are stamped by the footprints of Lakṣmī, which are coloured red by *lākṣā*. Your speech is sweet as cow’s milk, honey, sugarcane, and grapes. 

∥14∥

The rivalry between Lakṣmīand Sarasvatīhas existed from the begining of creation. However, the two of you have brought about their reconciliation within yourselves. 

∥15∥

The ocean of milk was covered with blue due to the shining body of Viṣṇu, who sleeps there. You two, however, have made the ocean white on account of your fame. 

∥16∥

As befiits your position as ministers, you are managing the affairs of your master’s kingdom effortlessly, issuing commands even just by the movements of your eyebrows. 

∥17∥

A couch of devotion have you spread on the swing of your mind, whose very fabric is faith. Thereupon have you placed a motherless and fatherless orphan child \(i.e., Lord Nārāyaṇa\). 

∥18∥

May the blessings of scholars bestow great prosperity on you two, Ve ˙n-kōba and Rāmacandra, who please all learned scholars. 

∥19∥

\[strung on a strong thread/accessible/well connected and prosperous\] and *sadvr̥ttam *\[well rounded/well built\].”

By the grace of Rāma, the king of K ōsala, we are all well, as of this morning of the tenth day of the *bahula*half of the month of Puṣya in the year Vibhava. 

∥20∥

We wish to receive a letter again from you, conveying the welfare of yourselves, your wives, children, friends, and relatives. 

∥21∥

And now, we are extremely pleased to learn of your adventurous undertaking in organizing an event fiit to be performed in *kr̥tayuga*, even in this impious *kaliyuga*, from your letter, which was given to us by the revered sage of the Parakāla Maṭha, who is always engaged in the performance of amazing feats of *tapasya*. 

∥22, 23∥

These are truly the fruits of being born, of being alive, and of possessing wealth, if a person worships Lord Hari in the company of brāhmaṇas.∥24∥

You two are born into noble families, which great persons have adorned. 

The tongue is ashamed of its inability to adequately praise your extraordinary feats. 

∥25∥

It would indeed be proper for us to attend the auspicious event you are organizing even in the absence of an invitation, let alone after being invited with such love and humility. 

∥26∥

We are not, however, used to travelling far, and hence remain here, but truly only our bodies remain here, like wooden idols. 

∥27∥

Our minds have travelled to your place with speed, along with our sentiments. When our sentiments are expressed in words, they yield the desired result, we believe. 

∥28∥

When you will have completed the bath signalling the culmination of the great event you have planned, you may kindly write a letter again to bring great joy to our ears. 

∥29∥

You know all, and all undesirable possibilities are ruled out in your case because you have served for long the lotus feet of revered preceptors. So, nothing remains to be wished for in your case. Nonetheless, we wish to say the following. 

∥30∥

May the grace of the prime couple of all creation be showered upon you. May the king who is your helper be equal to Kubēra in wealth \(or, may your king become an emperor\).

The great persons who serve the divine child Kr̥ṣṇa, who brought happiness to the smiling Yaśōdā, and also serve the meritorious assembly of brāhmaṇas with guileless devotion, will obtain unblemished fame. 

∥32∥

Garaḷapurī Śāstri, urged by great scholars, wrote these verses due to their grace. May these words, though slight, bring delight, like the crescent moon.
