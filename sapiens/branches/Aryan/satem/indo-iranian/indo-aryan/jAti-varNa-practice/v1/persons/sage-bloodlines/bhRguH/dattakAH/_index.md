## वाधूलगोत्रम्
- वीतहव्यः → सवेतस् (सावेतस-साम-द्रष्टा)।
- तत्प्रजासु - जैमिनिः, यास्कः।  

### वीतहव्यः
> वीतहव्य was a हैहय-यादव king, whose ancestors had repeatedly attacked the kings of काशि. So, this conflict goes over several generations & दिवोदास (काशिराज) asks a certain भारद्वाज, his पुरोहित for help. With भारद्वाज’s grace, दिवोदास has a son, प्रतर्दन, who manages to defeat वीतहव्य & wants to avenge his ancestors by killing the latter. वीतहव्य takes refuge at an आश्रम of the great भृगु & when प्रतर्दन asks the great ऋषि to hand over वीतहव्य, the ऋषि tells him that there are no non ब्राह्मण-s at his hermitage. Owing to the तपोबल of the great ऋषि, that king became a ब्राह्मण

> Vīta-havya is the name of a prince who is mentioned in the Rigveda1 along with bharadvāja, and as a contemporary of sudās,2 though in both passages it is possible to understand the word as a mere adjective. In the Atharvaveda3 vītahavya appears as connected with jamadagni and asita, but it is clear that the legend there has no value. It is possible, though not certain, that he was a king of the Sṛṇjayas.4 In the yajurveda Saṃhitās5 a vītahavya śrāyasa appears as a king: he may be identical with the vītahavya of the Rigveda, or belong to the same line. Cf. vaitahavya.

> The legend of vItahavya is garbled and you see 2 different accounts from mahabharata and shaunaka Rigvidhana. We can safely deduce that the vaitahavyas were originally kshatriyas who were absorbed into kevala bhargava set. Rigvidhana makes him a gArtdamada. Irrespective of these uncertainties of original founder, the lineage gave rise to illustrious figures like jaimini and yAska.
