## Life at Melukote

However one day due to some reason, Ayee swamy was late for his nithya kainkaryam so the temple priest thought of offering Kshira anna itself to the Almighty Shelvapillai as Naivedhya, Immediately there was a divine voice of Thirunarayana "Where is my mother(Ayee)? Please wait till my mother offers me milk". Thus the Lord of Melkote adored him like mother Yashodha, for his devoted service and addressed him as Ayee (Mother), as per legends. Since then, he was called as Ayee Swami or Jananyacharya (Janani Meaning Mother in Sanskrit)

He continued living in Melukote and involved himself completely in writing commentaries for Thiruppavai (2000 padi and 4000 padi), Sri vachana Bushanam and Acharya Hrudayam. He also composed Kurungi Stotra and few padya and gadya (poems and proses) in Tamil and Sanskrit language.
