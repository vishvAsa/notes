- his tiru-nakshatra (Ani-Svati i.e. Svati nakshatra of Mituna masa)
- Periyazhvar and his daughter, Andal, have sung beautiful verses showcasing two different rasas/bhavas - vatsalya and srngara resp. Andal, considered as avatara of Bhumi, married the Lord of Srirangam. The ALvAr 'blessed' Vishnu to live long - out of his overflowing love for the Lord.
- The author of this gloss is the great and renowned man called variously as ‘Sri Ramagnichit’, ‘Sri Bhattanathar’ and ‘Sri Vishnuchittar’, hailed as ‘Periyazhvar’ by Vaishnavas, the father of Sri Andal. He has composed Prabandhas called ‘Tiruppallandu’ etc. Sri Vedanta Desika has confirmed in his work ‘Rahasyatrayasaram’ that the gloss on Kalpasutras was written by Periyazhvar or Sri Vishnuchitta.
  - Periyazhvar was a purvasikha brahmana and as such baudhayana. He is believed to have written gloss on both apastamba and bodhayana srauta sutras of which only former is aval now.
- The pANDyan king was likely his disciple.
