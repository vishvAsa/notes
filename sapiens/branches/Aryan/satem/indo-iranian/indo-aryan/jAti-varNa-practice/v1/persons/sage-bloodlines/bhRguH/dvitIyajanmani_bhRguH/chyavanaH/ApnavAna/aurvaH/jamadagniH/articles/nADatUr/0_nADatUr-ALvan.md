Mahakaruniaka’s son Varadavishnu alias Sri Sudarsanar was popularly known as Nadadoor Azhwan, since, like Koorathazhwan, he was close and intimate to his teacher, Sri Ramanuja.  Nadadoor Azhwan was  one of the chosen few disciples who had the blessed opportunity of scribing  the Sri Bhashya, the commentary to the Brahma-Sutra, as and when it was recited by Sri Ramanuja.

Sri Ramanuja gave his “Sri Bhashya Simhasanam” to Nadadoor Azhwan, the choice being made by Lord Varadaraja Himself. After Sri Ramanuja, Nadadoor Azhwan installed the archa form of his preceptor at Sri Kanchi Varadaraja temple. He stayed in Kanchipuram and continued to do services to Sri Vaishnavism. His son, Deveraja Mahadesikan ardently followed his footsteps in the propagation of Sri Vaishavism.
