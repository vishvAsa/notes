      <description>&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&#34;https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2004/06/08/we-are-zombies/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Marc, R and I had a strange philosophical discussion this week end, when&#xA;perhaps we could have spent time in more practical but rewarding things.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;R and I have for long been what may be termed bhUta chaitanya vAdins in&#xA;the old Hindu parlance. We essentially believed that consciousness arose&#xA;from the neural material. Marc though somewhat closer to electron&#xA;orbitals than either of us in his daily existence made a strange&#xA;statement: I seem to accept the reality of consciousness much more than&#xA;you two, despite you all being born Hindus. We hastily clarified that we&#xA;do not deny the existence of consciousness like most other Hindus, we&#xA;merely &lt;em&gt;believe&lt;/em&gt; that it has a neural origin. There is a certain&#xA;philosopher, if we can call him that, named Dan Dennett, who almost&#xA;argues that there is no such thing as consciousness. Unlike him we do&#xA;not deny it but realize that it exists. So we decided to make sure that&#xA;we meant the same thing as Marc in the term “consciousness”.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
