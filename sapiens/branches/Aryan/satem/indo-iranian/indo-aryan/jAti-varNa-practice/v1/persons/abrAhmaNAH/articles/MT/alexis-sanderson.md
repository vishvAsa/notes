I heard a scholar say that rudra himself had caused inspiration to arise within the Englishman Alexis Sanderson, who is apparently given the Sanskrit appellation sundarasena, to revive interest in the shAstra-s taught by him.

> Well, Mark SG Dyczkowski despite his flaws passed away in Kashi on the śrīpañcamī (devoted to Saraswati) last year.

While he himself mentioned being directly inspired by the mistress of the pashchimAmnAya, he was channeled towards her by sundarasena via a marriage gift.

> In one interview in the late 2000s I believe, he mentioned how his study of Sanskrit aesthetic literature led him to Abhinavagupta, and he wanted to basically learn everything about him. This led to him studying under Swami Lakshmanjoo for 6 years until he eventually left because, although he was grateful for the time spent with him, he wanted to figure out the religious context in which texts like the Tantraloka was written, which he had to figure out on his own. At least at that point in time he had inclinations towards the Pratyabhijna system but considered himself a distinct, scholarly class of "believer".
