## Escape from lAhore
He was in pre partition TSP. Terrorist state of porkistan. He knew population exchange was coming. So he sent all his family to mainland bharat ahead of time.

They had land and property. He didn’t want to abandon those just like that. So wanted to see which direction wind blew. He stockpiled weapons. Rifles, pistols etc..

Sullas came to his neighborhood. But didn’t expect he was prepared. Before abandoning his property for good, he wanted to inflict as much damage as possible. His house got surrounded. He loaded up with pistols and rifles, escaped from the house. Shot his way through the border and escaped to india.
