Some of its familiar derivatives include Bhāskara and Bhānu. But its most renowned derivative is the very name of our country, Bhārata. In the human realm, the once-ubiquitous surname Bhaṭṭāraka was variously used as a title of respect, a formal address that had a range of meanings including preceptor, saint, sage, king, a noble lord, and so on. Its most frequent usage occurs in the Buddhist annals where Bauddha Munis and philosophers are addressed using the generic Bhaṭṭāraka honorific. Bhaṭṭāraka also means “Sun.” In some regions of Bhārata, the term Bhaṭṭāraka-vāra was used for “Sunday.”&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In 1960s, Dr. S. K. Srivastava &amp;amp; O. P. Misra of Agra University observed that Brahmins are, in some areas, giving up customs, e.g. timely upanayana—a process they termed &amp;ldquo;Desanskritisation&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Part of this was &amp;ldquo;Kshatriyaisation&amp;rdquo; aspiring landlord-status, even adopting Singh surname!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Source: RavilochanaH&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;details&gt;&lt;summary&gt;विस्तारः (द्रष्टुं नोद्यम्)&lt;/summary&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Context: In &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/realitycheckind/status/1489252075217174529&#34;&gt;a video&lt;/a&gt;, Dr K Kantharaj is a medical doctor , teacher of medical students, from political family, and from an elite Dravidian nonbrahmin caste said that brAhmins - and by extension hindutvaists - should stick to rituals, beg for livelihood and not bother with university education.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/details&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For once &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/realitycheckind/status/1489252075217174529&#34;&gt;this video&lt;/a&gt; makes the reason for Dravidian politics clear. The root of their politics is that Brahmins of TN became financially independent. It is a social injustice movement in reality. The landed castes could not stand the fact that Brahmins were not dependent on them.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Some female scholars of traditional Indian philosophy from the 18th and 19th centuries&lt;/strong&gt; Dr. Satyan Sharma&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;X : &lt;a href=&#34;https://x.com/sharmasatyan&#34;&gt;https://x.com/sharmasatyan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Linkedin : &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.linkedin.com/in/satyansharma/&#34;&gt;https://www.linkedin.com/in/satyansharma/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Academia : &lt;a href=&#34;https://puchd.academia.edu/SharmaSatyan&#34;&gt;https://puchd.academia.edu/SharmaSatyan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;abstract&#34;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When we talk of scholars of traditional Indian philosophy, although we do not intend to do so, we generally think of those scholars as men. We are not to blame, because what all is available under the category of traditional Indian philosophy, is mostly represented by men, as far as the current set of available information is concerned. It is good to ask about the existence female scholars in the same field. We do find certain scriptural sanctions for what kind of &amp;lsquo;spiritual-knowledge&amp;rsquo; women are eligible for. Historical data for the existence of female ascetics are available, which suggest that there were at least some women who thought about, spoke about and practised parts of what all is tagged as traditional Indian philosophy. What about the India of the 18th and 19th centuries? This was a time when the political and religious landscape had undergone, and was still undergoing a lot of change. Were there any female scholars of traditional Indian philosophy then? The answer is yes. In this paper I present a list of nine such Indian women, who either produced a work on traditional Indian philosophy or were recognised as learned in it or even as professing it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>In early muslim writings</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Evolution of the Figure of the Brahmin in Early Muslim Writings&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Dunkin Jalki&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;[This is a pre-copyedited, author-produced version of an article accepted for publication in Oñati Socio-legal Series (ISSN 2079-5971, http://opo.iisj.net/index.php/osls/index) following peer review.]&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;abstract&#34;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When we talk about the caste system today, among other things, we talk about the wily, crafty, and ostentatious Brahmins who founded and maintained a set of self-serving rules that effectively took the form of the caste system. How do social scientists know about these Brahmins? As a set of new scholars are demonstrating today, the ancient Indian texts - such as the Vedas or the Mahabharata - do not talk about the caste system or the domineering priestly class of Brahmins. These texts do not even exhibit an impulse to put into place a system that even remotely resembles the so-called caste system. From where does this idea of the Brahmin emerge then? Ever since Wilhelm Halbfass’s Imagining India (1990), a growing number of Indologists talk about the 11th century Al-Bīrūnī as one of ‘the greatest scholars ever’ to speak about the Indian caste system or as the one who gave birth to ‘Muslim scientific studies in the field of Indology’. However, such attempts merely re-present the orientalist view of India. What we need today are comprehensive studies that dig into the Islamic culture that culminates in Al-Biruni’s elaborate depiction of the Brahmin and the caste system. This paper sifts through the earliest available Islamic writings on India, from the early 8th century to Al-Biruni’s time, to chart a genealogy of the figure of the law-making, crafty Brahmin that emerges in 11th-century Muslim writings.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The religion of Siwa was introduced in Bali between three and four hundred years ago, previous to which the reigning religion was Buddhism. The following is the account of this revolution furnished to me by the Brahmins themselves. A few years previous to the Mahommedan conversion of the Javanese, there arrived in Java, from Kalinga, a number of Brahmins, of the sect of Siwa who received protection from Browijoyo, the last Hindu sovereign of Mojopahit.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Perhaps the only saving grace about the book, beginning right with its title, is that it makes no pretence of its agenda - though it must also be admitted that the research is quite impressive.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Niyogis would only give governmental positions to their kin. Vaidikis viewed Niyogis are lower and degenerate Brahmins. Yet, they both were proficient in Sanskrit and Telugu&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;An inscription from Panugallu (A.D. 1121) records that the government of Maduvula village in Kukkaḍam-30 was granted to Bhimana preggada while a village in Addaluru-70 was granted to Doddaya bhattu as estates. Doddaya bhattu was referred to as the son of the above Bhimana preggada. This shows that the vaidika and niyogi sects were not clearly seperated or not crystallised as endogamous groups or sects in the early Kakatiya period.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The beauty &amp;amp; complexity of polytheist ritual was framed in missionary discourse as perverse &amp;ldquo;Priestcraft&amp;rdquo; (invokes the connotations of &amp;lsquo;witchcraft&amp;rsquo;)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Ritual, as a category of thought, is not a brAhmaNa monopoly in Hindu dharma. Every jAti had its priesthood &amp;amp; ritual tradition. But, like it or not, it was the brAhmaNa spearheading the preservation of the essential character of Hindu polytheism. In every great polytheist civilization, it was the respective priesthood that generated intellectual impetus for sustaining the overall &amp;ldquo;spirit&amp;rdquo; of the old religion, even as local &amp;amp; household cults flourished in their own spaces as miniature versions of the grander priesthoods.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Intro&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Were the Brahmins of Southeast Asia Brahmins? by Dick van der Meij&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The main evidence in support of the idea that the brahmins of Southeast Asia were brahmins is that they were called so. Filliozat (1972: vii ) was suitably cautious in putting both &amp;lsquo;brahmin&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;Hindu&amp;rsquo; within quotation marks: &amp;ldquo;En Thailande et au Cambodge il existe une communauté dite de &amp;lsquo;brahmanes&amp;rsquo;, spécialisée dans l&amp;rsquo;accomplissement de rites &amp;lsquo;hindous&amp;rsquo; dans les cérémoni es officielles.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&#34;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/ecin.13139&#34;&gt;TW&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;details&gt;&lt;summary&gt;विस्तारः (द्रष्टुं नोद्यम्)&lt;/summary&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Brahmans (the highest caste) were much more likely to move home after completing their work contract in Fiji at the turn of the century. This allows the authors to estimate the value of status &amp;ndash; 2.5 years income.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/details&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;How much are individuals willing to pay for privileged status in a society with systemic discrimination? Utilizing unique data on indentured Indians in Fiji paying to return to India, I calculate how much upper-caste individuals were willing to pay historically for their status. I show the lower bound of the value of the uppermost castes in north India equaled almost 2.5 years&amp;rsquo; gross wages. The ordering follows hypothesized inter-caste hierarchies and shows diminishing effects as caste status falls. Men entirely drive the effects. My results show some of the first evidence quantifying caste status values and speak to caste&amp;rsquo;s persistence.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Pandit Madan Mohan Malaviya: Some Personal Reminiscences&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It has been my privilege to come into contact with Pandit Madan Mohan Malaviya on more than a dozen occasions within the past 22 years and on several of these occasions I have had opportunities of discussing with him at length topics of common interest to us, particularly in the spheres of education, politics and economics. I will briefly recall here some of my reminiscences of such occasions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Author: shivakumAr 2021&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;tenali&#34;&gt;Tenali&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Tenali is a small city in the Guntur district of Andhra Pradesh. It is only small in size. The town continues to live in our consciousness for more than one reason. Not in small measure for being the birthplace of Tenali Ramakrishna, one of the Ashta Diggajas of Sri Krishnadevaraya. Situated on the banks of the River Krishna, Tenali is an ancient place. It finds mention in the Andhra-Satavahana Kingdom relics. The Nagalingeshwara Temple inscription of Tenali shows a rich Vedic-Jain-Buddhist history for the place going back to 2000 years. In the modern era too, Tenali as a town is known for Art, Literature and Culture. But that is not everything. This story is about a tradition, culture and a person who should have been an inspiration for many in the nation, only if we cared to know the man and the institution. It is a one-man Institution that he has held fort in the midst of all turmoil.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The below is from &amp;ldquo;An Empire of Books : The Naval Kishore Press and the Diffusion of the Printed Word in Colonial India  by Ulrike Stark&amp;rdquo;:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In its complexity it reflects the fluid nature and flexibility of jāti and varņa norms prevailing during the first half of the century, while also illustrating the emergence of caste consciousness and a more homogeneous &amp;lsquo;caste society&amp;rsquo; in the second half. His story is in short that of a Dhusar turned Bhargava, involving a shift in varna affiliation from Kshatriya to Brahmin. While many of the actual forces at work in the process remain obscure, an attempt will be made here to trace this development in its successive stages.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Sri Gurukripa Vilasam (Greatness of Sri Chandrasekhara Bharathi) Bhashya Swami in Tamil&lt;br&gt;&#xA;(Translated from Tamil by Sri K. Narayanaswami, Vidyanarayanapuram, Sringeri)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Some other evening, when Sri Chandrasekhara Bharathi Mahaswami went to the Kalabhairava shrine on the small hill some of the asthana vidwans of the Sringeri Math accompanied him. As usual some of the boys of the patashala also followed them. When they were all seated in the small shrine the vidyarthis went through the usual exercise of antadhi sloka recitation and His Holiness was watching it with great interest.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
