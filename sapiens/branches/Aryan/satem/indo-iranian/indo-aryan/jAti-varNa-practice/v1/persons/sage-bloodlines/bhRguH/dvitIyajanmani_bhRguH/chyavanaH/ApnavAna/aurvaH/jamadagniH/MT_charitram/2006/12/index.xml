      <description>&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&#34;https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2006/12/11/devata-chitra-samgraha/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The eldest son of the great king of Nepal, pR^ithivi nArAyaNa shahA (who&#xA;defeated the British and founded the Nepal Kingdom until its recent&#xA;destruction by Marxists), pratApa siMha, compiled a voluminous work on&#xA;the mantra shAstra during his brief life. As a companion to this a&#xA;collection of pictures for the dhyAna-s on various deities was prepared&#xA;by the artists in Nepal. A copy of this collection with R1’s father is&#xA;of considerable interest in terms of tradition Hindu dhyAna art of which&#xA;not many old samples survive. That this Hindu tradition was very old is&#xA;shown by the chitra-kalA section of the viShNudharmottara. Here the&#xA;bhArgava mArkaNDeya gives a lecture on drawing and painting and&#xA;specifically provides the principal lakShaNas that should depicted in&#xA;paintings of devatAs. Most of the drawings in this collection are pretty&#xA;exquisite and depict the following deities:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&#34;https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2006/12/07/do-we-have-control-over-our-decisionsactions/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We set out on an utterly free afternoon on a long and interesting drive&#xA;towards the place known as the Sahayadri. We passed by Mis-creant’s&#xA;house but resisted the temptation to call on her, then we passed the&#xA;hilly outcrops where the rough rowdy lived, and arrived at the spot&#xA;where the muni’s horse had fallen as he was fleeing the black dasyus of&#xA;viTmaru. Then we arrived at Sujata’s house. To our surprise we saw&#xA;Mis-creant with Sujata and they excitedly told us how they were planning&#xA;to ply the bhUta-chakra with K. We knew how boring that would get and&#xA;proceeded on to the Sahayadri. There we met our good friend who&#xA;mysteriously passed out of our life 2 months after the Great War 1.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
