(Pandit Vanamali Chakravarti Vedantatirtha,who published an edition of Gobhila with the commentary of bhaTTanArAyaNa)

Let the pandit realize that erelong he would cease to exercise any influence upon society, if he do not educate himself properly at this juncture. Now or never is the time to cast off all that is useless in the Tol education and to incorporate with it all that is of real value in the learning of the West... The position of the teacher of Sanskrit in a school or college is precisely emblematic of the Tol Pandit's position in general society. In a school, the good-natured pandit, recruited from the Tol, is regarded by his pupils more as an object of amusement than of reverence. It cannot be otherwise. The student generally possesses a much larger share of real knowledge than his pandit, and he is fully conscious of his superiority. Under these circumstances, how could he really venerate his teacher? What is true in the School is also true in the Society (Chakravarti 1910: 54-5).
