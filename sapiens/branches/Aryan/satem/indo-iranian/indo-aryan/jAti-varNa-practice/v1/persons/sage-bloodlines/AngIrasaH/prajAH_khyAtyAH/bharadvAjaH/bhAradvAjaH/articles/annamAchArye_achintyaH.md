“śubhamastu.. śrīmate rāmānujāya namaḥ..”- Thus begins the inscription on the first copper plate bearing the texts of the divine Sankirtanas of Sri Tāllapāka Annamāchārya.  

## Info sources
Five hundred and eighteen years have elapsed since Sri. Annamāchārya attained Sree Vaikuntam, on the auspicious Dwadashi day of the Phalguna Lunar month of the Dundhubi Samvatsara – Saka year 1424 (Thursday, February 3, 1503 C.E.); after having dedicated a lifetime to composing Sankirtanas in praise of the Lord of Tiruvênkatam. That special day has been immortalized in a Sankirtana by Annāmācharya’s son, as follows.

> दिनमु द्वादशि नेडु तीर्थदिवसमु नीकु जनकुड अन्नमाचार्युड विच्चेयवे  
dinamu dvādasi nēdu tirthadivasamu niku 
janakuḍa annamācāryuḍa viccēyavē. ..

> “The day is Dvadasi, the sacred day for you. O father, Annamāchārya! Please do come…..”

Indeed, four main sources provide rich information about the life of Sri. Annamāchārya. 

One- the prologues to his Sankirtanas, as found inscribed on the copper plates (hereafter referred to as CPP).  
Two- the Telugu work called ‘Annamāchārya Jeevithacharitramu’ (AJC), composed in a Dwipada meter, by his grandson Sri. Tāllapāka Tiruvengadanātha.  
The third important source is the Sankirtanas composed in praise of Annamāchārya (SPA) by his sons and grandsons.  
Fourth, the body of Sankirtanas composed by Annamāchārya himself, which give a glimpse into events that occurred in his lifetime.  

In this article, we will quote from all these sources to share some well-known details and to also reveal some lesser-known facts pertaining to the life of this divine soul, even as we recall his glorious contributions.

## sankIrtana Prologue
The prologues to the Sankirtanas inscribed on the copper plates run as follows:

> शुभमस्तु श्रीमते रामानुजाय नमः  
> स्वस्तिश्री जयाभ्युदय शालिवाहनशकवरुषम्बुलु 1346 अगुनेँटि क्रोधिसंवत्सरमन्दु, ताळ्ळपाक अन्नमाचार्युलु अवतरिञ्चिन पदारुयेण्ड्लकु तिरुवेङ्गळनाथुण्डु प्रत्यक्षमै तेनु,  
> अदिमॊदलुगानु शालिवाहनशकवरुषम्बुलु 1424 आगु नेँटिदुन्दुभिसंवत्सरफाल्गुण ब १२ निरधानकु ० (निरोधानकु? तिरोधानानकु!) तिरुवेङ्गळनाथुनिमीँदनु अङ्कितमुगानु ताळ्लपाक अन्नमाचार्युलु विन्नपमुचेसिन अध्यात्मसङ्कीर्तनलु.  
śubhamastu śrīmate rāmānujāya namaḥ.. svastiśrī jayābhyudaya śālivāhanaśakavaruṣambulu 1346 aguneṭi krodhisaṃvatsaramandu, tāl̤l̤apāka annamācāryulu avatariñcinapadāruyeṇḍlaku tiruveṅgal̤anāthuṇḍu pratyakṣamaitenu, adimŏdalugānu śālivāhanaśakavaruṣambulu 1424 āgu neṭidundubhisaṃvatsaraphālguṇa bahula 12 niradhānaku (virodhānaku? tirodhānānaku?) tiruveṅgal̤anāthunimīdanu aṅkitamugānu tāl̤lapāka annamācāryulu vinnapamucesina adhyātmasaṅkīrtanalu.

Freely translated, the inscription runs:

> “May auspiciousness prevail! Obeisance to Sri Rāmānuja! Let there be prosperity! In the Jayabhyudaya era of Kali- year 1346 of the salivahana saka being the ‘Krodhi’ Samvatsara, 16 years from the descent of Sri Tāllapāka Annamāchārya, Lord Tiruvênkatanātha manifested to him. With this as the beginning and up to year 1424 of the salivahana saka being the ‘Dundhubui’ Samvatsara, Phalguna month, Bahula Paksha, Dwadasi (12th) Tallapaka Annamacharya composed and dedicated these Sringara Sankirtanas to Lord Tiruvênkatanātha.”  

The following are noteworthy from this inscription:

1) At the tender age of 16 years, Lord Vênkatêshwara manifested to Annamāchārya in a dream.  
2) This was the start year of his compositions in dedication to the Lord.
3) The date of his ascent to Sree Vaikuntam is also indicated. 

However, the complex construction of this long sentence in the inscription leads one to ask the question- was the year ‘Krodhi’ 1346 of the salivahana saka the year that Annamāchārya was born? Or was it the year when Lord Vênkatêshwara manifested to him?

Some opine that this was the year of his birth, and thus they indicate the year 1424 C.E. as the birth year of Annamāchārya.

However, careful observation of the copper plate inscription indicates that the word ‘pratyaksamaitenu’ – ‘became manifest’ is the verb ending that becomes qualified by preceding portion of the long sentence. Thus, is it more appropriate to take the year 1424 C.E. as the year the Lord manifested to Sri Annamāchārya. His birth therefore would have been in the year 1408 C.E., sixteen years preceding this event. The period Saka 1346 to 1424 (i.e., 1424 C.E. to 1503 C.E.) therefore denotes the period of his steadfastness to carrying out the divine mandate of the Lord, by composing Sankirtanas dedicated to Him. Indeed, looking at the prologues for the works of his son Tirumalacharya and grandson Chinna Tirumalacharya also reveals that the dates mentioned in the corresponding references denotes only the period of dedicating their lives in composing Sankirtanas on the Lord, and not their dates of birth.  

## Importance
Why is it worthy for us to recall the life of Sri. Annamacharya? 

So states his grandson (in AJC):

> हरि! म्मुने कॊनियाडु मा जिह्व   
नॊरुलकु गॊनियाडकुण्डङ्गँजेसि  
कण्टुलेनट्टि लक्ष्मणगुरु मतमु-

hari! mimmune koniyādu mā jihva  
norulaku goniyādakundanga jesi  
kantulēnaṭṭi lakṣmaṇaguru matamu-  
vanti sanmatamu mivanti daivatamu  
tanavanți guruni nandaralona decci  
vanajaksal nedu māvantivaralaku   
garatalāmalakambu gāviñce ganuka

> O lord Hari! Having ensured that our tongues praise Your glory alone   
and not sing the praise of any other; he bestowed upon us :  
\- the blemishless doctrine of ‘Rāmānuja Matam’, as the correct doctrine;  
\- a Supreme God like You (along with Lakshmi); 
\- and a preceptor like himself;  
O Lotus eyed Lord! Moreover, he bestowed all this to (ordinary) people like us, 
even as easily and clearly as having an āmala fruit in the palm of the hand!”

Indeed, also as recounted in other Sankirtanas praising Annamāchārya (SPA): 

> अदिवो ताळ्लपाक अन्नमाचार्युलु  
वीडॆ श्री वेङ्कटेशु नॆदुट वॆदवॆट्टि  
लोकमुलो वेदमुलन्नियु मञ्चि-

> adivō tāļlapāka annamācāryulu

padamulusēsi pādi pāvanamu sēsenu.

> “Behold! Tāllapāka Annamāchārya, (standing) right here in front of Lord Sree Venkatesha, composed the (tenets of the) entire Vedas into excellent “padās” and having then sung those, he purified the entire world”

And again,

> सकलवेदमुलु सङ्कीर्तनलु चेसि  
प्रकटिञ्चि निनु बाडि पावनुडैन -  
अकलङ्कुडु ताळ्लपाकन्नमाचार्युल

> sakalavēdamulu sankirtanalu cēsi

> “Having composed the entirety of the Vedas into Sankirtanas,  
and thus, having revealed You, and sung Your glories O Lord,  
 that sinless and blemish less Tāllapāka Annamāchārya…..

And also,

> अन्दमैन रामानुज आचार्यमतमुनु  
अन्दुकॊनि निलचिनाडु अन्नमय्य  
विन्दुवलॆ माकुनु श्रीवेङ्कटनाठुनिनिच्चॆ

> “Having got initiated into the glorious doctrine of 
Rāmānujāchārya, he remained steadfast in it!
Like a feast, he offered Sree Venkatesha to all of us, 
that Tāllapāka Annamayya!
    

## Birth and Childhood of Annamāchārya

In the current state of Andhra Pradesh, about 80 kilometers North West of Tirupati is the village called Tāllapāka. The name Tāllapāka is likely derived from the Tamil word ‘pākkam’ which means ‘a village’ or ‘a town’. ‘tāla’ refers to ‘tāti chettu’ or the Palmyra trees. This indicates the abundance of palm trees that may have flourished in that village, and hence the name. This village is home to Lord Chennakêśava who stands resplendently in the shrine there, conferring boons to devotees even to this day.

In that village of Tāllapāka, centuries ago, there lived a devotee of Lord Vishnu by the name Nārāyaṇasūri. Nārāyaṇasūri belonged to the Nandavarika clan, who had adopted the Rik shāka of the Vedas, and followed the Asvalayana Sutras. Nārāyaṇasūri himself was well versed in all branches of learning. In due course of time, he was married to a pious lady called Lakkamāmba of Mādupūru - a village adjacent to Tāllapāka.

Lakkamāmba was no ordinary soul. She had sought refuge at Lord Chennakêśava of Mādupūru (a village adjacent to Tallapaka) and He became her constant protector. It is said that she was so devoted and close to Him that the Lord of Mādupūru Himself used to converse with her!

Nārāyaṇasūri along with Lakkamāmba acquired great prosperity. However, being worried that he did not have any progeny, he and his wife reached the temple of Lord Vênkatêshwara at Tirumala. Offering repeated prostrations near the Garuda Sthamba, they prayed for a child. 

So states the AJC-

> वरदुँडै वेङ्कटेश्वरयँडु ताबूनु –  
बिरुदुगज्जियल मुप्पिडि कठारम्बु  
कललोन नॊसग नक्कजमन्दि तपमु  
फलियिञ्चॆ ननुचु दम्पतु लेगि;  
varaduḍai vēńkateśvarayaḍu tābūnu – 
birudugajjiyala muppidi katharambu
kalalōna nosaga nakkajamandi tapamu 
phaliyiñce nanucu dampatu legi;

> “That boon bestowing Lord Vênkatêshwara then made His 
triple hilted divine sword - decorated with badges declaring 
its victories- appear in their dreams! The couple then felt that their 
penances had become fulfilled and left (to return to their home).”

Further, it is stated regarding the birth:

> राजीवनयन वरप्रसादमुन   
देजम्बु मतियु नॆन्ते स्तरिल्ल  
लक्कमाम्बकु बुण्यलावण्यनिधिकि  
जक्कनि ग्रहमु लुच्चमुन मूँडलर   
ननुपम लग्नम्बुनन्दु वैशाख –   
मुन शाखनु जगम्बुन नुल्लसिल्ल   
जनियिञ्चॆ नन्नमाचार्युण्डु शक्ति –  
मुनिकि बराशरमुनि पुट्टिनटुलु;  
rajivanayana varaprasādamuna  
dejambu matiyu nente vistarilla  
lakkamāmbaku bunyalavaṇyanidhiki  
jakkani grahamu luccamuna mudalara  
nanupama lagnambunandu vaisakha –  
muna visakhanu jagambuna nullasilla  
janiyince nannamācāryundu śakti –  
muniki baraśaramuni puttinatulu;

> “By the grace of the lotus eyed Lord, the qualities of ‘tejas’ - effulgence 
and ‘mati’ - intellect were made to issue forth in abundance; and to 
the meritorious Lakkamamba, who was also a repository of beauty; in 
the month of Vaishāka, while the asterism of Vishāka shone bright in 
this world; and during an extraordinary ‘lagna’ when three planets 
were resplendent in an exalted position, was born Annamāchārya, 
even as Parāshara muni was born to his father Shakti muni!”

Two aspects need to be addressed here.

### Why is there a reference to ‘tejas’ and ‘mati’?

Tejas means ‘brilliance’, referring to the brilliant blue dazzle of the Nandaka Sword of Lord Vishnu. Tejas also means ‘sharpness’, and puns upon the exceedingly sharp edge of the Nandaka sword. The Nandaka sword of Lord Hari is also the presiding deity of ‘correct knowledge’. The foremost qualities of the Nandaka sword of Lord Hari became manifest in the personality of Annamayya. He was considered to be verily a manifestation of the Nandaka sword of Lord Vishnu. Even as the AJC explicitly states-

> हरिनन्दकांशजुं डगुट डॆन्दमुन  
परमसुज्ञानसम्पद पॊदलङ्ग  
harinandakāmśajum daguța dendamuna   
paramasujñanasampada podalanga  

Because he was the very incarnation of Nandaka- the sword of Hari, he prospered 
with the wealth of supreme ‘correct knowledge’ within his heart, even from birth!

### Why is there a comparison between the birth of Parāshara muni and that of Annamāchārya?

The Âdi parva of the Mahābhārata gives the details of the birth of sage Parāshara. Parāshara was born as the son of Adrishyanti and Shakti Muni. Prior to Parāshara’s birth however, Shakti Muni had been devoured by a Rākshasa. Owing to the death of father Shakti Muni, Parāshara was raised by his grandfather Vashista (i.e., the father of Shakti muni). This however is not the reason for the comparison here. 

It is also mentioned in the Mahābhārata, that Parāshara lived in his mother’s womb for twelve full years prior to his birth. As is with the case of the birth of Parāshara, long gestation periods are indicated in the case of extraordinary beings. Another instance of such extraordinary birth is that of Swāmi Vêdānta Deśika, an avatāra of the bell of Lord Vênkatêshwara of Tirumala. Deśika was also known to be born after a ‘Garbha Vāsam’ (gestation) of twelve long years like Parāshara Muni. 

However, what is to be understood here is as follows. From the time of the vision of Lord Vênkatêshwara’s sword Nandaka in the dream of Nārāyaṇasūri and Lakkamamba (at Tirumala) up to the birth of Annamayya, twelve full years had elapsed. For this reason, Annamayya, like Parāshara, was borne in the womb for a period of twelve full years.

### Name
Even as the Sruti states अन्नं ब्रह्मेति व्यजानात्‌। “annam brahmeti vyajānāt” (Taittiriya Brighuvalli 2-1) meaning - “Know Annam to be Brahman”; the father Nārāyaṇasūri, keeping the same words of the Sruti in mind, named the child as ‘Annam’ (or Annā) -the appellation of Lord Vishnu. The suffix ‘ayya’ became honorific for the name. Thus, he was called ‘Annamayya’.

### Devotion
Indeed, even from a young age, the child showed exemplary devotion towards Lord Vishnu. He would not partake food unless it was specifically given to him as the ‘prasadam’ of the Lord of Tirumala! Even by constantly placing in a cradle and singing lullabies to him, no matter how much one tried or for how long they tried, the child’s pertinacious crying would not be comforted unless the rendered songs were made appropriate by the specific mention of the name of the Lord of Vênkata Hill! The child moreover would never offer obeisance to anyone unless he was asked to offer prostrations to the Lord of the Hills! In this manner, that little child remained deeply rooted in utmost affection directed only towards the Lord of Sesha Hill.

At the tender age of eight, Annamayya’s mind became filled with vexation towards mundane activities. He left his home and joined a group of devotees travelling to Tirumala. Having beheld the Supreme Lord of the Vênkata hill, the young Annamayya continued to reside there, composing Sankirtanas in praise of the Lord and serving Him. He also became initiated with the Pancha Samskaras at Tirumala by a sage named Ghana Vishnu who lived in Tirumala. 
      

## Seeking the refuge of Sri Adi Van śaṭhakopa Jiyar

At the age of sixteen, an important event transpired in Annamayya’s life that led him to live a life dedicated to the service of the Supreme Lord. While it is well known that Annamayya sought refuge at the lotus feet of Sri Adi Vān śaṭhakopa Jiyar, it is important to see what set the stage for this divine meeting between the Acharya and the disciple. 

So states the AJC-

> वेद्यम्बुलगु वेद वेदान्तमुख्य-  
विद्यल नधिकुलै वॆलसियुण्डुदुरु  
 तॆल्लम्बुगा देहदेहिभावमुन-  
नॆल्लवस्तुवुलुनु नीवॆका दलँचि  
 परचिन्त लुडिगि नापैनॆ विन्यस्त-  
भरु(डवै युण्डु शुभम्बुलन्नियुनुननघात्म!  
 vēdyambulagu vēda vēdāntamukhya-  
vidyala nadhikulai velasiyunduduru  
tellambuga 'dehadehibhavamuna-  
nellavastuvulunu nivekā dalaci  
paracinta luḍigi nāpaine vinyasta-  
bharudavai yundu śubhambulanniyununanaghātma!

The Lord (manifested in his dream and) spoke- 

> “Those who are adept in the quintessential tenets of the 
veda-vedānta, the doctrine that is to be known, they are renowned 
as authorities in the doctrine. By clearly understanding (from them) the 
truth that “You alone (O Lord) are present in all entities in 
‘Deha-Dehi Bhaava’”, then relinquishing all other thoughts or 
anxieties, do remain as one who has entrusted all burdens unto Me! 
By this you shall attain all auspiciousness, O sinless one!”

Thus, appearing to Annamāchārya in a dream, Lord Vênkatêshwara instructed the central import of the Vedanta to him. The Lord instructs him to first comprehend the ‘Deha-Dehi Bhaava’, that too only by instruction from a preceptor who had correctly comprehended the quintessential import of the Veda-Vedanta. The Lord also commanded him to perform Bhara-nyāsam by entrusting all his burdens unto Him!

This heart of the whole Shastra- the ‘Dehā-Dehî Bhāva’ or ‘Śārîrā-Śārîri Bhāvā’ has been completely and flawlessly reconciled by Âchārya Rāmānuja even as he systematized the ancient doctrine and expounded the principal teachings of the Vêda- Vêdānta. In his elaborate commentary on the Śārîrika Sutras, Âchārya Rāmānuja reconciled seemingly contradictory scriptural concepts to arrive at a flawless conclusion in the form of a doctrine which became called Rāmānuja-Matam. The crux of this doctrine is the reconciliation of the Abheda Sruti (Vedic texts which speak of non-difference between Jivatma and Paramatma) and Bheda Sruti (Vedic texts which speak of a difference between Jivatma and Paramatma) with the help of the purport of the ‘Antaryāmi Brāhmana’ and other texts- called as the Ghataka Sruti, which reveal that - All non-sentient objects and also the entirety of sentient individual selves are ensouled by the Supreme Brahman. Thus, the Supreme Brahman is revealed to possess a ‘Dehā-Dehî Bhāva’ or ‘Śārîrā-Śārîri Bhāvā’ with the entire universe. This Śārîrā-Śārîri Bhāvā’ is to be understood carefully and is probably best done by quoting Sri Rāmānuja’s own words regarding this principal doctrine-

> अयमेव च आत्मशरीरभाव- पृथक्सिद्ध्यनर्हाधाराधेयभावः नियन्तृनियाम्यभावः शेषशेषिभावश्च । सर्वात्मना आधारतया नियन्तृतया शेषतया च आप्नोतीति आत्मा, सर्वात्मना आधेयतया नियाम्यतया शेषतया च अपृथक्सिद्धं प्रकारभूतमिति आकारः शरिरम् इति च उच्यते ।


> "This is what is meant by 'Atma-Sarira Bhava'- It is the ever inseparable relationship between the ‘ādhāra’ – the supporter (the Lord) and the ‘ādheya’ – the supported (the universe); between the ‘niyanta’ - the controller (the Lord) and the ‘niyāmya’- the controlled (the universe); between the ‘śēşi’ - the principal entity (the Lord) and the ‘śēşa’- the secondary entity (the universe). That which occupies the position of being the supporter, the controller, and the primary entity is called the 'soul' or 'Atma'; while that which takes the position of being dependent upon, being controlled by and being subservient to the primary entity, thereby becoming its inseparable mode, is called the 'body' or 'śarira' of the primary entity."

This ‘Śārîrā-Śārîri Bhāvā’ is called as the as the ‘प्रधानप्रतितन्त्रम्’ ‘pradhānapratitantram’ – ‘Principal distinguishing doctrinal tenet’ of Rāmānuja Siddhānta. This flawless understanding of the heart of the Vedanta is unique to the system of Rāmānuja. 

Indeed, Acharya Rāmānuja himself summarizes the essence of his doctrine so beautifully in the mangala sloka (opening verse) of ‘Vedanta Sāra’ as follows:

> समस्त चिदचिद्वस्तुशरीरायाखिलात्मने ।   
श्रीमते निर्मलानन्दोदन्वते विष्णवे नमः ॥  

> “We bow (in surrender) to that Lord Vishnu; who is verily the Âtma (inner-soul) 
for the Śārîrā (body) constituted by the multitude and entirety of all insentient 
objects and sentient individual selves; who is an ocean of (auspicious qualities like) 
blemishless-ness and bliss; and who is inseparably united with Goddess Sree!” 

Now, Lord Tiru Vênkatêshwara had appeared in the dream of Annamayya and Himself introduced Annamayya into this doctrine of ‘Dêhā-Dêhî’ or the ‘Śārîrā-Śārîri’ concept and had thereby alluded to the flawless philosophy propounded by Sri. Rāmānujāchārya. In accordance with this command of Lord Vênkatêshwara communicated in the dream, desire arose in Annamāchārya’s heart to study this ‘Śārîrā-Śārîri’ doctrine of Śri Bhāshyakāra. Further, the Lord had also instructed him to seek the refuge of an ‘adhikari’ or authority in the Vêda-Vêdānta. Annamāchārya was well aware that such an ‘adhikari’ could only be an Âchārya who himself was duly initiated into the doctrine by means of a ‘Sat-Sampradāya’ or traditional succession of preceptors. 

During those days, in the holiest of holy towns revered by supreme devotees- the town by the name of Ahobilam, there lived a great exponent of the doctrine of Rāmānujāchārya, serving humbly the lotus feet of Lord Mālola Narasimha. The work ‘Vāsantikā Parinayam’ of Śri Śatakopa Yatîndra Mahādeshikan, the seventh Jîyar of Ahobila Matam (Nirvāham 1513 – 1522 C.E.), gives a wonderful description of that great exponent of Ramanuja Siddhanta as follows-

> अत्र खलु, पवित्रतर-परम-भागवत-परिवृत-- श्रीमद्-अहोबिल-पुरे  
> 
> आसीद् व्यासस्य वीप्सा, शुक-मुनि-यमकं, पुण्डरीक-द्विरुक्तिः,  
> ???? प्रथित-यति-कुल-प्राग्रणी-वण्-शठारि-  
> प्राज्ञानां यस्तु राज्ञां पदवि-नति-कृताम् अष्ट-वर्णोपदेशात्  
> अष्टैश्वर्याष्टभोगान् अदित समधिकाम् अष्ट-दिक्-ख्याततां च॥

atra khalu pavitratara paramabhagavataparivṛta śrimad ahōbilapurē āsid vyāsasya vipsā śukamuniyamakam pundarikadviruktiḥ prathitayatikulaprāgrani vansathāriḥ 
prājñānām yastu rājñām padavinatikṛtām aṣṭavarṇōpadēśāt aṣṭaiśvaryāṣṭabhogān aditasamadhikāmaṣṭadikkhyātatām ca

> “People considered him to be a second manifestation of sage Vyāsa, or a descent of sage Śuka, or perhaps even a reappearance of sage Pundarîka! He became celebrated as the foremost among the ‘Yatis’ or ascetics. The wise and great kings bowed down in deep 
reverence to his lotus feet. And this Yati, by initiating those devotees into the ‘Astāksharî’ ‘eight syllable’ mantra, also blessed them with eight kinds of wealth, eight kinds of enjoyment, renown in all the eight directions- all these and more, in a superabundant manner!”

This Yati was none other than the divine Sri ‘Van Śatāri’, or Sri ‘Van-Śatakopa Muni’, or Śri Âdi Van Śatakopa Swāmi. 

Sri Tallapaka Annamacharya

Śri Âdi Van Śatakopa Swāmi

Indeed, the AJC states of Sri śaṭhakopa Muni-

> परमेशुडगु नहोबलनृसिंहुण्डु  
गुरुभावमुनँ जेरुकॊनि त्रिदण्डम्बु-  
ना नरसिंहु चक्रादिमन्त्रमुलु  
ताने प्रत्यक्षम्बु दयसेय गॊनुचु,  
हरि हयग्रीवु ब्रत्यक्षम्बुँजेसि  
धर सर्वतन्त्र स्वतन्त्रुडैनट्टि-  
वेदान्त देशिकु वेङ्कटाचार्युना  
दिव्यसम्प्रदायमुन वर्तिञ्चु- शठकोपमुनि

> paramēśuḍagu nahobalanrsimhundu
gurubhāvamuna jērukoni tridaṇḍambu-
nā narasimhu cakrādimantramulu
tāne pratyakṣambu dayasēya gonucu,

dhara sarvatantra svatantruḍainaṭṭi-
vēdāntadēśiku vēnkaṭācāryunā
divyasampradayamuna vartiñcu- śathakōpamuni

> Lord Nrusimha of Ahobalam, the Supreme Lord of all, Himself appeared in 
the form of a Guru and bestowed to Sri Śatakopa muni – the mantras, the triple staff, 
the deity of Lord Narasimha, the shanka-chakra mudras and other such insignia. 
Sri Śathakopa muni imbibed the Divya-Sampradaaya (divine tradition) of Venkatacharya- 
who himself having manifested Lord Hari in the form of Hayagreeva, became
 renowned as ‘Sarvatantra swatantra’ and ‘Vedanta Desika’ upon this earth!

This key passage from AJC, a 16th century work, clarifies the following important aspects-

1) Lord Narasimha is said to have Himself appeared in the form of a Guru to initiate Sri Van Śatakopan into Sannyasa, by bestowing the appropriate mantras and the insignia, along with a deity of Himself. This is also reminiscent of the famous verse:

> अहोबिले श्रीनृसिंह-  
> प्रेषमन्त्रं स्वयं ददौ
योगिरूपेण यस्यास्मै  
शठकोपाय मङ्गळम्

> Auspiciousness unto that śaṭhakopa, to whom Lord Narasimha of Ahobilam 
Himself bestowed the “Presha mantra” by taking the form of an ascetic!”

2) Sri Âdi Van Śatakopa Jîyar had imbibed the divine tradition of Swami Vênkatanātha, who was also bestowed with the title of ‘Vedanta Desika’ and ‘Sarvatantra swatantra’.

Annamayya, hearing of the greatness of this Guru, came to Ahobilam and sought refuge at his lotus feet. The compassionate Acharya accepted him as a disciple. Annamāchārya imbibed the doctrine of Rāmānuja according to the ‘Deśika Divya Sampradāyam’ directly from Âdi Van Śatakopa Jîyar.

So states the AJC regarding the relationship between these two divine souls- Âdi Van Śatakopa Jîyar and Annamayya:

> शठकोपमुनिवद्द सकल वेदान्त-  
पठनम्बुँ जेसि यभङ्ग स्फूर्ति  
हरिपूज हरिसेव हरिकीर्तनम्बु  
हरिमननमु ध्यान मनिशम्बुँ दनकु  
घनतर सकलभोगम्बुलुगाग मनुचु,  
śathakōpamunivadda sakala vēdānta-  
pathanambu jēsi yabhangavisphūrti   
haripūja harisēva harikirtanambu   
harimananamu dhyana maniśambu danaku   
ghanatara sakalabhogambulugāga manucu  

> At the feet of that Śatakopa muni, Annamayya studied the entirety of the Vedanta.  
By the grace of his Guru, the worship of Lord Hari with unhindered brilliance,  
service to Lord Hari, composing sankeertanas upon Lord Hari, thoughts upon  
Lord Hari, recollection and remembrance of Lord Hari, incessant meditation  
upon Lord Hari- all these became the entirety of enjoyments for him.

## Doctrine in kIrtanas
Having thus imbibed the glorious doctrine of Rāmānuja from his Acharya, Annamayya stood by the same and propagated it. While the entire host of the floral offerings of his Sankirtanas bears the fragrance of the doctrine of Visishtādvaita, there are a few wherein he explicitly highlights the principles of the doctrine. Here is one example- 

> विष्णुड् ऒक्कडे विश्वात्मकुडु  
वैष्णवमे सर्वम्बुनु ॥
vişņu dokkadē viśvātmakuḍu
vaisnavamē sarvambunu.

> Vishnu alone is the inner-self of the entire universe!
Everything is of Vishnu alone!

> परमेष्ठि सेयु ब्रह्माण्ड सृष्टियु   
हरुनिलोनिसंहारशक्ति  
परगगन् इन्द्रुनि परिपालनमुनु   
अरसि चूड श्रीहरि-महिम ॥  
paramēşthi sẽyu brahmaṇḍa sṛṣṭiyu 
harunilōnisamhāraśakti 
paragaga nindruniparipalanamunu 
arasicūḍa śriharimahima.

> The creation of the cosmos by Brahma,  
the power of dissolution possesed by Shiva,  
the acclaimed rulership of Indra,
if correctly appraised, are all Sree Hari’s glories!

> यिलबञ्चभूतमुललो गुणमुलु 
अल नवग्रहवनिहारमुलु 
तलकॊनु कालत्रयधर्मम्बुनु 
अलरग नारायणुनिमहिमलॆ ॥

> yilabañcabhūtamulalo gunamulu 
ala navagrahavanihāramulu 
talakonu kālatrayadharmambunu 
alaraga nārāyaṇunimahimalē.

> The qualities exisiting in the five elements (Panchabhutas),
the movements of the nine planets (Navagrahas),
 the occurance of the order of the three durations of time,
all these shine forth as Narayana’s glories!

> अन्तट गलमायाविलासमुलु  
सॊन्त बरमपदभोगमुलु  
मन्तुकुनॆक्किन मरिसमस्तमुनु  
यिन्तयु श्री वेङ्कटेशुमहिमलॆ ।  
amtaṭa galamāyāvilasamulu 
ponta baramapadabhogamulu 
mantukunekkina marisamastamunu
yintayu śrivēnkatēśumahimalē.

> The sport of ‘māya’ which exisits everywhere,
so also, the blissful experiences at ‘Parama-pada’;,
All that is supremely great, and so also everything,
in entirety is but Sree Venkatesha’s glory!

• Copper plate # 171, Naata Raaga 

The ‘pradhānapratitantram’ – ‘Principal distinguishing doctrinal tenet’ of Rāmānuja Siddhānta is also made explicit in several Sankirtanas. Here are a few examples, in short -

> आतनिबो पॊगणेमु आतनि शरणण्टिमि  
आतडे सर्वजीवुलअन्तर्यामि ॥  
atanibo pogadēmu atani śaraṇantimi
ataḍē sarvajivulaamtaryāmi.

> Him alone we praise! To Him alone we surrender!
He alone is the ‘antaryami’ in all beings!
--------------------------------

> पॊसग निन्निटि दाने पुट्टिञ्चि रक्षिञ्चिनट्टि-
 असङ्ख्यातुडु श्रीवेङ्कटाद्रीशुडु ॥  
posaga ninniți dānē puṭṭinci rakṣincinaṭṭi-
asankhyātuḍu śrivēnkaṭādriśudu.

> Being Himself the creator and protector of all these,
unfathomably infinite is this Lord of Sree Venkatadri!

> The mind being sinful cannot cease to think

Further, several compositions of Annamayya a indicate his intimate relationship with Âchārya Âdi Van Śatakopan. We would like to share here a few of these as examples. 

Annamayya received initiation into the Supreme ‘Vênkatêshwara’ Mantra from his Guru:

> वेदवेद्युलु वॆदकेटिमन्दु   
अदिनन्त्यमुलेनिआमन्दु ॥  
> अदन श्रीतिरुवेङ्कटाद्रि ऎदिमन्दु

This is the medicine that has no beginning or end!

> This is the medicine that is available atop the Venkatadri hill,
Behold! This is the very medicine bestowed by my Guru!

• Copper plate # 1, Desaksi Raaga 

And again- 

> अन्नि मन्त्रमुलु इन्दॆ आवहिञ्चॆनु 
वॆन्नतो नाकु गलिगॆ वेङ्कटेशु मन्त्रमु


> “All mantras indeed give rise to this, 
like butter, I obtained the Venkatesha Mantra!

> नारदुडु जपियिञ्चॆ नारायण मन्त्रमु

> “The Narayana mantra recited by Narada,
the Narasimha Mantra recited by Prahlada,
the Rama Mantra which was desired and obtained by Vibheesana,
and I obtained a different one, this Venkatesha mantra!” 

(like butter, I obtained)

> रङ्गगु वासुदेव मन्त्रमु धृवुण्डु जपिञ्चॆ   
अङ्गविञ्चॆ कृष्ण मन्त्रमु अर्जुनुडु

(like butter, I obtained)

> For all these mantras, the end aim is the Lord of Lakshmi,
and thus, they are verily the Para-Brahma Mantra!
This which can protect me, and bestowed by my guru,
is the Venkatesha mantra, which is soothing like moonlight!”

• Copper plate # 375, Lalita Raaga 

The analogy ‘like butter’ means the churning of all mantras (or the divine names of the Lord) yields the nectarine butter called Venkatesha mantra. The analogy to ‘moonlight’ is also for a specific reason. The moonlight ‘Venkatesha Mantra’ reveals the Supreme Brahman, the Lord of Lakshmi. Since all these mantras have the Lord of Lakshmi as their sole object, they are all Para Brahma Mantras. Because Swami Âdi Van Śatakopan specifically initiated Annamacharya into this mantra, the reference to ‘verēnāku’- ‘differently’; ‘viṅgaḍamai nāku’- ‘separately for me’; this mantra became unique for Annamacharya because of having obtained it from his Acharya. The usage of the term ‘indiranāthuḍē guṟi’- ‘the Lord of Lakshmi is the aim’- is to denote the fact that the Parabrahman is identified, even by the Vedas, by referring to Him as the consort of Lakshmi. If He is identified thus, there can be no mistake or confusion whatsoever as to who the Parabrahman is.

Annamayya received initiation into the art of composing Sankirtanas from his Âchārya Âdi Van Śatakopan. 

> परमु श्रीवेङ्कटपतिसङ्कीर्तन

cirapunyulu munu cekonnanija midi 
marigi manuța tamamanasulakoladi..

> The Supreme ‘Sree Venkatapati Sankeertana’ is verily a
subtle secret bestowed by my Guru in an appropriate manner!
This is the truth accepted by the meritorious ones previously,
  
• Copper plate # 246, Lalita Raaga

It is known from internal references that Annamayya was initiated into the work called ‘Natya Shastra’ of Bharata Muni. Swami Vedanta Desika states (in the Hastigiri Mahatmyam) that the word ‘Bharata’ is composed of three letters- ‘Bha’ ‘Ra’ and Ta’; and these stand for Bhaava- or emotion, Raaga- melody, and Taala- rhythm respectively. 

These are the key elements of Sangita Shastra – the discipline of music. It is for this reason that Annamacharya’s compositions are outward expressions of his internal emotion of deep Bhakti or devotion to Lord Sriman Narayana; and these outward expressions were rendered with Raaga- melody, and Taala- rhythm. His Sankeertanas are verily a result of this.

> भावमुलोन बाह्यमुनन्दुनु
गोविन्द गोविन्दयनि कॊलुववो मनसा
bhāvamulona bāhyamunandunu

> From within, and from outside,

hariyavatāramule akhiladevatalu

harināmamule anni mantramulu

> All the Devatas (Gods) are but manifestations of Lord Hari,
the entire universe is present within Lord Hari,
all mantras are but names of Lord Hari,
O mind, say Hari-Hari! Hari-Hari!

> विष्णुनि महिमले विहित कर्ममुलु

viṣṇuvu viṣṇuvani vēdakavo manasā

> All the karmas are but the glory of Lord Vishnu,
the entirety of the Vedas praises Lord Vishnu alone,
Vishnu alone is the innermost self of this whole universe, 
O mind seek Him saying ‘Vishnu’ ‘Vishnu’!

> अच्युतुडितडॆ आदियुनन्त्यमु

acyutuḍitaḍē ādiyunantyamu
acyutuḍe asurāntakuḍu

acyuta acyuta śaraṇanavo manasā

> The beginning and the end is but only Achyutha,
Achyutha is the one who quells the evil,
That Lord Achyutha is here upon Sree Venkatadri,
O mind surrender unto Him, (saying) ‘Achyutha’ ‘Achyutha’!

Here, the mention of all gods being ‘avataras’ of Hari is not to be taken literally to mean that Lord Hari Himself descends as Indra, Aditya, Agni etc. just like He takes the manifestations of Rama, Krishna and etc. Rather it is to be understood that all deities other than the Supreme Lord are but sentient beings like us, and that they have been endowed with special powers only by the grace of Lord Sree Hari. 

The Lord’s the manifestations as Rama, Krishna and etc. on the other hand are verily His own descent and are therefore ‘true avataras’. Here, the word ‘avatara’ or ‘manifestation’ is taken in a secondary sense; i.e., all it denotes here is that the special powers vested in the deities are but manifestations of Lord Hari. The final purport of this song therefore is that Lord Vishnu is the inner controller of the entire Universe. Seeking refuge in Him alone is the best remedy.

Further it is seen that Annamayya was taught the path of Sharanāgati by Âdi Van Śatakopan. Several Sankirtanas outline this fact-

> कैवल्यमुनकु गडु दॆरुवै नदि 
आवल नीशरणागतिये
श्रीवेङ्कटेश्वर चॆप्पॆ मागुरुडु 
मावद्द निदॆ नी मन्त्रमॆपो ॥  
kaivalyamunaku gadu deruvai nadi 
avala nisaraṇāgatiye 
śrivenkateśvara ceppe magurudu 
maavaddanide ni mantramepo..

> The only way to ‘Kaivalyam’ (moksha) is by performing 
sharanāgati unto You! This is what my Guru instructed me, 
O Sree Venkatesha! And indeed, I am blessed with Your mantra!

• Copper plate # 295, Telugukambodi Raaga

Annamayya partook the Śri Pāda Tîrtham of his Âchārya Âdi Van Śatakopan and also was initiated into the inner sense of the Dvaya Mantra by him. Âdi Van Śatakopan also manifested the Lord in the heart of Annamayya and bestowed him with +++(metaphorically)+++ ‘swaroopa diksha’. 

> ज्ञानयज्ञ मीगति मोक्ष साधनमु

> Offering the prasada of Guru and tadiyyas as ‘Purodasa’,
placing the ‘Dvaya Mantra’ as an adorment for my ears, and 
then manifesting Lord Sree Venkateshwara verily within the heart,
in this manner he bestowed the ‘svaroopa deeksha’ to me, my Guru!

• Copper plate # 136, Dhanyasi Raaga

Here, ‘swaroopa diksha’ means the initiation into the true knowledge of the self. In other words, the knowledge that the self or the ‘jivātma’ is innately the servant or ‘dāsa’ of the Lord is verily the true understanding of its nature. The guru is said to have bestowed this nectarine knowledge to Annamayya.


It is also seen that Annamayya performed Âchāryanishta at the feet of Âdi Van Śatakopan.

> अन्निटा नावॆनकटि अपराध मेमिगल्ला

 So also, Sree Venkatesha, the only means for all this
is accepting the matchless ‘Ramanuja Matam’! 

(We will attain this only if You bestow!)

It is also seen that Annamayya received initiation into ‘Tiruvārādhanam’ or Archā worship from his Âchārya Âdi Van Śatakopan.

> ऎट्टयिना जेसुको इक नीचित्तमु नन्नु

> ‘He chants My name all the time, what may he ask from Me?’  
Thinking thus, do not get worried!  
My Acharya has already blessed me with everything previously!  
If asked ‘Why this?’, it is because I will not let go of his precepts!

> ‘Lovingly, placing Me in his house, he worships Me!

My Acharya is the very reason for this relationship between You and me!
If asked ‘Why this love?’ it is because this is the wealth he bestowed!

therefore, this relationship between You and me remains for eternity!

And finally, we cannot forget to quote Annamayya’s heartfelt eulogy of his Guru Âdi Van Śatakopan in this beautiful Sankirtana:

> चूडु डिन्दरिकि सुलभुडु हरि-
तोडुनीडयगुदॊरमुनि यितडु ॥
cūdu dindariki sulabhuḍu hari-
todunidayagudoramuni yitadu.

> Behold! He is easily approchable by all!
Hari is the constant companion of this lordly sage!

> Being the golden stairway to eternal beatitude,
as a final authority on the scriptures,
as the sole personification of purity,
being a boat to the Viraja river, here he is!

> कापाडग लॊकमुलकु सुज्ञान-

> Being a lamp of benevolent knowledge to save the worlds,
and verily as the effulgence of this world,
to destroy the sins, beaing a raft to cross the 
ocean of existance, here he is!

and eternally Lord Narasimha of Ahobalam,  
these being his only goal, here he is- Sri Śatakopa Muni!

## The Greatness of Annamāchārya:

It is well known that a chieftain by the name of Saluva Narasimha sought the refuge of Annamāchārya. For the sake of brevity, we will not get into the details pertaining to Saluva Narasimha in this article. However, it is important to mention here that Saluva Narasimha’s parents had been blessed with him as their child owing to the grace of Lord Narasimha of Ahobilam. Therefore, they named him ‘Narasimha’. We have inscriptional records that document this fact. 

It is therefore known that Saluva Narasimha and his family had strong ties to Ahobilam and it is very likely that he had met Annamāchārya there during their younger years. The same fact is also indicated in passages of the AJC, wherein Saluva is said to have referred to his friendship with Annamayya as ‘balyasakhyambu’ meaning ‘childhood friendship’.

Indeed, with the blessings of Annamāchārya, Saluva soon rose in ranks to take over the ruler ship of a large empire which would eventually become the nucleus of the famed Vijayanagar Empire. 

Once, having become victorious in the battle of Penukonda (or Ghana Giri), Saluva invited Annamāchārya for the consecration of Penukonda as the capital city of his growing kingdom. On that occasion, says the AJC, Annamāchārya rendered an immaculate Sankirtana (in Sringara Rasa) on the Lord of the seven Hills, to the pleasure of a large assembly in the King’s court.

The king is said to have appreciated the rendition very deeply and was moved by it. However, not recognizing the deep devotion of Annamāchārya towards the Lord, Saluva made a great mistake – the sin of asking Annamayya to compose a eulogy on him. This angered Annamāchārya. The AJC says, having heard these ‘intolerable’ words, Annamayya spoke to the king as follows:  

> बरमपतिव्रताभावम्बुँ बूनि
हरि मुकुन्दुनिँ गॊनियाडु ना जिह्व
निनुँ गॊनियाडङ्गनेर दॆन्तैन
ननु नॆट्लु पलिकिति नैच्यम्पुबलुकु-
नायच्युतुनि दक्क नन्युल नुति-
सेयुट ना कन्न चॆलियलि वा  
paramapativratābhāvambu būni
hari mukunduni goniyādu nā jihva
ninu goniyādanganēra dentaina
nanu netlu palikiti naicyampubaluku-
nāyacyutuni dakka nanyula vinuti-
seyuta nā kanna celiyali vāvi

> “Having embraced the sentiment of a chaste wife (in my devotion to the Lord), 
my tongue, which is engaged in the praise of Lord Hari Mukunda only, 
can never accept to render your praise, no matter what!   
How can you speak such sinful words to me, O king? 
Rendering a eulogy on anyone other than Lord Achyutha I consider to be 
equivalent to a sin as heinous as incest between a brother and sister!”

Indeed, this incident portrays the true nature of Annamāchārya. By the grace of his Acharya Âdi Van Śatakopan Swāmi, Annamayya had developed the sentiment of ‘Paramaikantyam’- ‘one pointed devotion’ towards his dear most Lord. And this is what sets him apart from the host of all the other composers. He was a devotee par excellence. His compositions were merely a manifestation of his unwavering devotion to the Supreme Lord. True to his word, not one of his Sankirtanas praises any other deity than the Lord of Lakshmi! The available 12,000 Sankirtanas are testimony to this fact.

## The works of Annamāchārya and its preservation

Over the course of his lifetime, Annamāchārya composed numerous Sankirtanas and other works, glorifying his Lord- Tiru Venkatesha. He speaks of his own compositions as follows-

> दाचुको नीपादालकु दगने जेसिनपूज लिवि  
पूचि नीकीरीतिरूप पुष्पमुलिवि यय्या  
dācuko nīpādālaku dagane jesinapūja livi
pūci nīkīrītirūpa puṣpamulivi yayyā

> “Protect these offerings unto Your feet, performed by me as Your worship,
O Lord! These are but flowers representing Your glory!

> वॊक्कसङ्कीर्तने चालु वॊद्दिकैमम्मु रक्षिञ्चग
तक्किनवि भाण्डारान दाचि वुण्डनी
वॆक्कसमगु नी नाममु वॆलसुलभमु फल मधिकमु
दिक्कै नन्नेलिति विक नवि तीरनिनाधनमय्या ..  
vökkasaṅkīrtane cālu vöddikaimammu rakṣiñcaga
takkinavi bhāṇḍārāna dāci vuṇḍanī
vēkkasamagu nī nāmamu vēlasulabhamu phala madhikamu
dikkai nanneliti vika navi tīraninādhanamayyā ..

One Sankirtana suffices, to protect us, 
let the others be preserved in the ‘bhandaram’!
Your name alone protects us with ease and bestows fruits in excess,
You rule over me and these (kirtanas) are my limitless treasure, O Lord!

> ना नालिकपैनुण्डि नानासङ्कीर्तनलु
पूनि नाचे निन्नु बॊगडिञ्चितिवि
वेनामालवॆन्नुडा विनुतिञ्च नॆन्तवाड
कानिम्मनि ना कीपुण्यमु गट्टिति विन्तेयय्या ..  
nā nālikapainuṇḍi nānāsaṅkīrtanalu
pūni nāce ninnu bögaḍiñcitivi
vēnāmālavēnnuḍā vinutiñca nēntavāḍa
kānimmani nā kīpuṇyamu gaṭṭiti vinteyayyā ..

> Becoming seated upon my tongue, You had Yourself praised
by me, through numerous Sankirtanas!
O Lord of thousand names, who indeed am I to praise You?
You yourself bestowed this ‘punyam’ (fortune) upon me!

> यीमाट गर्वमु गादु नी महिमे कॊनियाडितिगानि
चेमुञ्चि नास्वातन्त्र्यमु चॆप्पिनवाडगानु
नेमान बाडेवाडनु नेरमु लॆञ्चकु मी
श्रीमधव ने नीदासुड श्रीवेङ्कटेशुडवय्या  
yīmāṭa garvamu gādu nī mahime köniyāḍitigāni
cemuñci nāsvātantryamu cēppinavāḍagānu
nēmāna bāḍevāḍanu nēramu lēñcaku mī
śrīmadhava ne nīdāsuḍa śrīveṅkaṭeśuḍavayyā

> This has not been said out of pride. I have only extolled Your glory,
not having said anything out of my own free will.
I have sung these as a vow, please do not find fault,
O Sree Madhava! I am Your servant and You are Sree Venkateshwara!

Indeed, every Sankirtana was offered to the Lord’s feet like a flower offering given during worship. It must be said that these were no ordinary flowers, but these were flowers carrying the special fragrance called- ‘Ramanuja Mata’ or ‘the doctrine of Ramanuja’ and also the most splendid fragrance of Lord Venkateshwara and Goddess Alamelumanga Taayar’s glory. 

The AJC summarizes the nature of his works as follows-

> योगमार्गम्बुन नॊककॊन्नि, बुधुलु 
रागिल्ल शृङ्गार रसरीतिँ गॊन्नि, 
वैराग्यरचनतो वासिम्पँ गॊन्नि,

सरसत्वमुन दाळसमुखमुल् गाग 
परमतन्त्रमुलु मुप्पदि रॆण्डुवेलु, 
प्र मल द्विपद प्रबन्धरूपमुन 
नवमुगा रामायणमु, दिव्यभाष 
ना वेङ्कटाद्रिमाहात्म्य मन्तयुनु 
गा चि, रुचुल शृङ्गारमञ्जरियु 
शतकमुल् पदि रॆण्डु सकलभाषलनु 
प्रतिलेनि नानाप्रबन्धमुल् चेसि,

> yogamārgambuna nokakonni, budhulu
ragilla sringāra rasariti gonni, 
vairāgyaracanatö vāsimpa gonni, 
sārasanetrupai sarikirtanamulu 
sarasatvamuna dālasamukhamul gāga 
paramatantramulu muppadirenduvelu, 
pravimala dvipada prabandharūpamuna 
navamugā rāmayanamu, divyabhāsa 
nā vēnkaṭādrimāhātmya mantayunu 
gāvinci, rucula śrrigāramañjariyu 
śatakamul padirendu sakalabhāṣalanu 
pratileni nānāprabandhamul cesi, 

> Some describing the path of attaining the Lord- i.e. the Yoga maarga, 
Some in the sentiment of ‘srngaara’ for the enjoyment of the wise,
Some with the fragrance of dispassion - ‘vairagya’,
thus were the Sankirtanas composed on the Lotus Eyed Lord;
tuned with the ‘taala’ and brining out the beauty of composition,
thirty-two thousand of them, being verily supreme most mantras,
and in the form of a blemishless dvipada compostion, rendering
the Ramayana in a novel way; and in the language of the Gods,
having composed the Venkatadri Mahatmyam in entirety,
and then composing beautifully the work Sringaara Manjari,
and also Satakas – twelve in number, in various languages; 
thus having composed matchless Prabandhas…..!

These Sankirtanas totaling to about 32,000 in number, along with other works, became inscribed in copper plates and were stored in a stone-built cell called ‘Sankirtana Bhandaram’ (i.e., the storehouse of Sankirtanas), located right adjacent to the shrine of Acharya Rāmānuja, in the Tirumamani Mantapam within the Vimana Pradakshina of the Tirumala temple. This storehouse exists till today. It is indeed a place where reverence has to be paid because this was the place of safe concealment of the copper plates bearing the Sankirtanas for nearly four centuries, until they were removed in the mid 1900’s for the purpose of publication.+++(5)+++

The reverence given to these Sankirtanas and its rendition in the divine presence of the Lord is evident in several inscriptions available on the walls of the Tirumala temple. We quote a few here –

1) An inscription dated 31 October 1530 C.E., on the North wall of the second prākāra of the Tirumala temple records the provision for the offering of one Atirasa-Padi to Lord Malayappa, in front of the Sankirtana Bhandaram, during the Lakshmi Devi Mahotsavam – a festival to be celebrated for Lord Vênkatêshwara and Alamelumanga Tāyār, instituted by King Achuta Devaraya. (TTD inscriptions Vol IV, #6).
2) An inscription on the south wall of the third prākāra of the Tirumala temple, dated 12 February 1541 C.E. speaks of offerings to be given to Lord Malayappa in front of the Sankirtana Bhandaram, along with one measure of oil to be used for lighting of lamps in front of the Bhandaram. (TTD inscriptions Vol IV, #155).
3) An inscription on the south wall of the third prākāra of the Tirumala temple documenting the deed of charity executed on 3rd July 1545 C.E. indicates the allotment of 12 gold coins yearly for the honoring and worship of the Sankirtanas preserved in the Sankirtana Bhandaram; 16 gold coins to be paid yearly to two learned persons engaged in the singing of Sankirtanas; and further 6 gold coins to be paid yearly for a Sree Vaishnava scholar engaged in the reading of the Śree Bhāshya in the divine presence of Lord Venkatesha, during the Tirumanjanam, at Tirumalai. And similarly, the same donations to be paid to two learned persons engaged in singing the Sankirtanas during the daily ablutions and to the scholars rendering the Śree Bhāshya in the divine presence of Lord Govindaraja at Tirupati. (TTD inscriptions Vol V, #47). 
4) An inscription, dated 13 Jan 1558 C.E. on the south wall of the second prākāra Govindaraja Swami temple in Tirupati records the donation of money for 200 areca nuts and 400 betel leaves to be offered during the ‘Sankirtana Arulappād’, conducted during the summer festival at Tirumalai (TTD inscriptions Vol V, #159).

These inscriptions also indicate that the Sankirtana Bhandaram itself was considered a ‘temple of music’ and was shown deep reverence. The reverence to these Sankirtanas was not a phenomenon limited to Tirumala and Tirupati. Indeed, separate copper plates (smaller in size) were also made for easy transport to other distant locations such as Ahobilam, Srirangam and Kanchipuram; so that the Sankirtanas could be rendered to the Lord in those divine Kshetras as well. The Madras Epigraphical society found these copper plates in Ahobilam and also in large numbers at Srirangam. The plates found in Ahobilam were reportedly acquired by the Devasthanam.     

Another important aspect of the Sankirtana Bhandaram is the finding of two stone cut images representing the images of Annamāchārya and his son Tirumalacharya, presented on the facade. Similar images have subsequently been identified at multiple places- for example at the doorway of the Kalyana Vênkatêshwara Swami temple in Tirupati, at Ahobilam, at Kanchipuram, in Kolar and also in the Hampi region. This indicates the widespread impact of the Tāllapāka Poets during the 15th and 16th Centuries.

## Conclusion
Thus, in a nutshell, we have highlighted some of the glories of this divine soul, a Parama Vaishnava, Sri Tallapaka Annamāchārya. We have brought out some of the extraordinary aspects in his life and his deep association with the doctrine of Ramanuja.  

This article would be incomplete without acknowledging the contributions of Smt. Ambika Ananth, who has, and continues to help me in my detailed study of the Sankirtanas of Annamāchārya. Further, all the Sankirtanas presented in this article have been translated with the help and guidance of Smt. Ambika Ananth. 

It is also important to recognize the invaluable contribution of Sri. T.V. Subba Rao by whose help I was able to undertake a detailed study of the Annamāchārya Jeevithacharitramu, not once but several times; and certainly, also that of Sri. Veturi Anandamurthy by whose help I was able to study a copy of the original manuscript of the Dwipada, and further clarify some deep aspects of the Annamāchārya Jeevithacharitramu.

Adiyen also expresses heartfelt gratitude to Sri. K Sadagopa Iyengar, Editor- Sri Nirisimha Priya (Journal of the Ahobila Sri Matham) for the kind support bestowed upon me and for being the motivation to write this particular piece on Annamāchārya. 

❖❖❖

It is only due to the fortune of being blessed by the sheer compassionate grace of my Acharya, Mahavidwan Sri. U.Ve. Valayapettai Ramachariar Swami, that adiyen has been able to accomplish this blessed task of bringing out the glories of Sri Annamāchārya in accordance with the Sri Vaishnava Sampradaya. 

By the blessings of my Acharya, I have been able to comprehend the deeper aspects (related to Sri Ramanuja Sampradaya) in this study and have been able to present the same for the enjoyment of others- i.e., for the devotees of the Lord.
