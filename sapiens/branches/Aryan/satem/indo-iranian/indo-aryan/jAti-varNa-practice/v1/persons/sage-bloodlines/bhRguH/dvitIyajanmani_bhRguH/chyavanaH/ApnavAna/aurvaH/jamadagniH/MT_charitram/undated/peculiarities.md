People are made different: some people have a natural tendency to think in terms of physics and put together a theory of the observed world via physical principles. We are not like that. Instead, we need to see a concept in a purely mathematical context first. Then, if we see the same in the real world, we can immediately make sense of it. For example, a basic concept of physics -- force -- was somewhat mysterious to us. However, we realized that it was the negative gradient of a potential curve, i.e., potential energy: F=−∇V we finally understood it.

From around the time I was born to the mid-eighties, it was an exciting time in particle physics: the electroweak unification, discovery of key fundamental particles filling in the 3 generations of fermions like tau, charm, bottom, glimpses of GUT. It had a fascinating allure to it, but lay behind a wall of formidable mathematics that few could scale. But for an outsider now basic physics looks jaded. A vast swampland of string theory and nothing much after the last holdouts like the Higgs boson, the Tau neutrino and top quark were experimentally verified.
