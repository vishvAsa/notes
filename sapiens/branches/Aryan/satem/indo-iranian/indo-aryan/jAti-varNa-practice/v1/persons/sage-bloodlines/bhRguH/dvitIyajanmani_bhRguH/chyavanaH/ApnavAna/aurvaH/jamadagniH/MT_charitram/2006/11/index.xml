The green elements mark the fire&#xA;altars&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;He sat in the place where the first of the pieces had fallen. In his&#xA;mind’s eye h remembered the tale of the great grahanatha: “tArakAsura&#xA;the accursed enemy of the gods wore a li~Nga around his neck that&#xA;protected him from death as long as it was there. As he fought viShNu&#xA;and vIrabhadra their weapons failed on him after prolonged and fierce&#xA;duels. Finally the one born of the arrow-forest charged forth to meet&#xA;the daitya. After a prolonged duel he finally struck the daitya with his&#xA;charmed shakti, from which none escape. The shakti shattered the li~Nga&#xA;into 5 fragments and the pierced the daitya-s broad chest slaying him.&#xA;The pieces of the li~Nga fell on pR^ithivi and each became a&#xA;maha-li~Nga in which The god is worshiped.” It was near the first of&#xA;these pieces he had constructed a kumAra gR^iha. After having performed&#xA;the kha-chakra-dharaNi he offered the oblations to the bull-headed&#xA;nandikeshvara at the appropriate altar. Then he moved over to the altar&#xA;of pilipichChikA and offered seven oblations: pilipichChikA, revatI,&#xA;shakunI, ShaShThi, jAtahAriNi, mukhamaNDikA and devasenA on the&#xA;pa~nchami day. Even as the last oblation hit the fire a terrifying&#xA;graha named pariprakAsha arose, filling the air with awe that only the&#xA;masters of the mahAmantra know. He muttered the graha-stotraM was&#xA;transported to the great mound of shrI-parvata by that awful graha. Atop&#xA;shrIparvata he remained lying at night performing the complete cycle of&#xA;the kha-chakra-dhyAna. He joined the siddhaugha.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The most mysterious was a manuscript of a&#xA;tantric from around 900 AD from Uttaranchal which had in an archaic&#xA;script a whole collection of mantra-s, some found no where else.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;The pishAchi prayogas: 1) pishAchI karNagR^ihyA 2) pishAchI aulumbinI 3)&#xA;pishAchI kR^iShNamukhI 4) kharamukhI&lt;br&gt;&#xA;The pishAcha prayogas: 1) pishAcha pilupAla 2) karNa-pishAcha 3)&#xA;kR^iShNa pishAcha 4) kR^iShNa-sAra pishAcha 5) munidhara pishAcha 6)&#xA;alagupta&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Other prayogas:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&#34;https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2006/11/08/awakening/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We moved past to the nest where the root of sorrow lay like a dread&#xA;beast waiting in prowl for its unprotected prey. With our prayoga-s&#xA;spent on mundane battles, we needed to lift our bow and perform&#xA;bhIma-karma-s as our henchmen having little foresight were tossing about&#xA;like a rudderless boat. Having mentally marked ourselves for the&#xA;struggle we wandered on to the beginning of the backward journey, having&#xA;neutralized after some struggle the rAkShasi-s on our path. We were&#xA;originally going to talk of the bAShakala-mantra upaniShad but in a&#xA;strange reverie slipped back to the distant time when we had the triad&#xA;of dreams. They occurred before we awoke in the cool cocoon of the&#xA;backroom where we slept.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&#34;https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2006/11/01/watongia/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The varanopids are a lineage of synapsids whose distinctness and wide&#xA;distribution has come to light more recently, even though Romer&#xA;described Varanops elegantly in his early monographs. More recently&#xA;Reisz and Laurin, the experts on these topics, described a relatively&#xA;large varanopid, Watongia, from the Oklahoma Chickasha formation. This&#xA;synapsid was discovered by Olson in 1974 but was poorly understood until&#xA;a few years ago. Watongia appears to share a hallmark feature of two&#xA;other varanopids, namely the postorbital tuberosity if the authors’&#xA;interpretation of the skull is correct. The vertebra nevertheless are&#xA;very similar to Aerosaurus and Varanodon even if larger. The function of&#xA;this tuberosity in Watongia, Aerosaurus and Varanodon is unclear. It&#xA;could be a muscle attachment site, but I suspect that it might have had&#xA;a soft tissue decoration, like a spike or spine that played a role in&#xA;sexual selection. Watongia also has a distinct canine that is twice the&#xA;size of the maxillary teeth. This suggests that the presence of the&#xA;hypertrophied canine as a predatory device emerged relatively early in&#xA;synapsid evolution, and was repeatedly used in so many synapsids lineage&#xA;down to this day. The teeth were recurved strongly with anterior and&#xA;posterior unserrated cutting edges.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
