## Background
Shamaiya Iyengar (Shyama Iyengar) popularly known as Anche Shamaiya, [1] son of varadaraja Iyengar, dewan of Krishna Raja Wadiyar II (varad-rao) and grandson of Vasudeva Iyengar(A great Sanskrit scholar), was the minister of the police and the post office (also served as the intelligence department) during the time of Hyder Ali and Tipu Sultan. 

He was originally from Sulikunte in Kolar district of Karnataka (also known as Sulkunte), near Budikote in Bangarpet. Although it is said he was born in shambonahali or shamaiahhalli after his name sake (source: Mysore State Gazetteer) in the tumkur district, his ancestors had migrated by then to sulikunte(sulakunte) agrahara formerly known as soolikere village in Kolar district from tumkur. Shamaih and his ancestors were also religious gurus to what Lt Col Kirkpatrick refers to as the brinjara people.

> "Shamaiah, an Iyengar Bramin, of very superior abilities, was the author of several learned works, and among others, of a complete commentary on the Vedanta Sutra, one of the most abstruse and difficult of the Hindu sciences. The Sultan was much attached to him, and employed him on all occasions which required great skill and judgment, in political as well as religious matters."


## Haidar
Shamaiya had met Hyder when he was a young man. He rose to the height of his power when he was appointed as the head of the post office and police which also served many other functions (Anche Guritana) in 1776 (Some historians put this date at 1779) after helping catch a corrupt official in hiding who had run off with significant money from the state treasury who is referred to as Anche Thimmaih. It is said he used his agents and network of emissaries to track him down and bring him back to face justice.

He was honoured with an umbrella, medal, pearl necklace, received 5000 varahas as reward and 1000 varahas as allowance from Hyder Ali. Shamaiah enjoyed great success as an all round administrator during the time of Hyder. It was said that shamaiah was so trusted and an important figure that all courtiers except shamaiah were to compulsorily attend Tippoos wedding. Shamaih was left free to look after the affairs of the state even when the most important nobles and administrators were forced to attend the wedding. Shamaih was the only Hindu allowed to wear the mohammeden elite noble green headdress and ride on a palanquin during the time of Hyder.

## Tipu
Later in Tipu sultan's time an alleged insurrection to overthrow Tipu and reestablish the Hindu king was plotted around 1783. Shamaiya was believed to be the leader of the insurrection. It is said that some mandyam iyengars of the bharadwaja gotra, the same gotra as that of Shamaiah. 

During this time, or slightly before it, he interfered in melukoTe tradition, and partly succeeded in tenkalai-ifying it.

The Sanad of Tipu Sultan in 1793 regarding Sulakunte Agrahara gives it over to the Parakala Matha of Mysore by the ruler.

## Brits
Brits are said to have tried him, and to have confiscated some of his vast property.
