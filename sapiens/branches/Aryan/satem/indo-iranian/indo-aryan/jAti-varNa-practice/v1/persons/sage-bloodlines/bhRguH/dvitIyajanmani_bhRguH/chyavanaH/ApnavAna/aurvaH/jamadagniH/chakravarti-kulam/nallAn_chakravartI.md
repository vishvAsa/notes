## वरदराजानुग्रह-कथा
काञ्चीपुरे पुरा नद्य् अवर्तत।  
तत्र स्नानसमये शूद्रभागवत-कलेवरम् प्राप चक्रवर्ती।  
तद्-अन्तिम-संस्कारं चकार।  
ततस् तत्रत्याश् शिष्टास् तम् बहिर् अकुर्वन्।  
किञ्च काञ्चीपूर्णो "नल्लाऩ् चक्रवर्ती" इति वरदराजोक्तिं प्रचार्य तन् न्यवारयत्। 

## रामानुजानुग्रह-कथा

> Nallan Chakravarti was a sishyA of Ramanuja and is said to have converted even some hunters into Sri Vaishnavaites. These hunters were the ones who helped our Sri Ramanuja when he was in exile due to the atrocities commited by the KrimikanTa chOlan. On seeing their bhakthi when Sri Ramanuja asked them as to who taught them all these things, they replied that it was their AchArya by name Thirumalai nallAn, for which Sri Ramanuja said "nallAn enRa kALamEgham ippadi varshikkiradhE" (The dark cloud named 'nallAn' is pouring the grace and the bhakthi in a great manner so that everyone is benefitted).
