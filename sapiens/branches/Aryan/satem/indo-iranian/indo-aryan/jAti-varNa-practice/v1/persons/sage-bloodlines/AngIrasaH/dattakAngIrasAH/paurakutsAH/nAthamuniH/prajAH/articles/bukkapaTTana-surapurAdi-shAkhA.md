“**_Why should we know ?_**

**_our family tree_** **_/ genealogical tree/_**

**_vamsa vriksham ?”_** **J**

  

Let us consider few facts.... Environmental factors influence the true picture of a person, **moulded by his gene-structure**, favorably or unfavorably modifying the outward appearance subject to the degree and nature of inter-action. If the interaction is positive, the fate of the individual and in turn his family/ society/ culture/ heritage flourishes, other wise suffers - this speaks about ones own Karma Phalam. There lies the presence of God, the Almighty, the Supreme. justify yourself and mould yourself and your future generation to right path to prosper. God will bless you, your family/ Vamsam and in turn our society and Vaishanava cult. Hence genealogy or charting generation or vamsa vruksham.

  

 GENETIC ENGINEERING: This was known to us, in India, even during the period of Mahabharata and Vyasa Maharishi. **Sri Vyasa Maharishi** applied molecular biology and genetic engineering to produce hundred tanians / children to Gandhary by culturing the hundred pieces of fetus broken by her forceful beating of her stomach/abdomen. It so happened when she was carrying, she made this in-human act out of her sheer jealousy, when she was unable to bear and heard that Kunti delivered a male child first . We know what happened to that delivery of hundred ill fated taninans / children, Sri Vysar’s genetic engineering using tissue culture techniques and their fate in the Mahabharata.

  

The Hindu on Oct 17, 1998, has published an article about the castes in India, have developed through centuries, each has its unique genetic profile distinct from one caste to other for the purpose it generated, as observed by the scientists in Utah university.:-

  

 One must know that a man’s DNA, the gene, is highly specific to his caste and remained static, while women’s genes show some mobility. the **MITOCHONDRIAL - DNA (x-**chromosomes) is inherited only from mothers while Y-chromosomes are inherited from fathers. By marrying a bride from other Gotras (within the same caste) improvises intellectual mobility, health and culture due to import of desirable genes to the next Tanians / children (and generations) of the family line depending upon the nett worth of selection. Eventually the stratification (layers of social grades) of the Hindu caste system was driven by women. Yes, one should think over before selecting a bride for marriage. The genetic structure was developed through ages by selection in natural way but not by the half baked research generating artificial genetic engineering, so called miracle of searching or assembling/ synthesizing the right star, fusing it in right place, in right combination and generating a assembled / synthesized individual (as experimented in animals) all under the grace of God, THE SUPREME. It is a feat of research, a tiny insignificant **part of the god’s wonders** started recently by some of the intellectuals.

  

  

**SIGNIFICANCE OF GENELOGY**

  

Let us see, how far these so-called Tanians / children of significance of knowing Vamsa Vriksham. In other words it is to know our heredity i.e. and when put on paper Vamsa Vriksham : -

  

1. **To identify one’s own ancestry , great heritage, rich tradition.** pleasant life you will never get back.

2\. **To keep your genealogy line pure**, maintain or build superior intellectual genes by selective matching between families of different Gotras of same caste. You can not dream of getting ‘Kapila Gomata” spiritual potency once you perish the breed by cross breeding.

3. Pay respects during invocations and rituals to honour their fore-fathers, gurus, Acharyas and upto Rushies

4 For temple Kainkaryams and worship, your gotram is most essential to identify and to introduce yourself.

5. As a strong piece of information that can be trusted for purpose of history and family stories, culture, heritage etc.

6\. For matching the marriages other than swa-gotra and

7\. Finally **to make the children to understand their pure rich tradition, great ancestral history** of Srivishnavism and high intellectual heritage and/or to mould their future in right direction, whatever caste they may be Brahmana go near to god in this way for the benefit of mankind. We will appreciate if they go in right direction and achieve significantly and perfectly. May god bless them.

  

**SATAMARSHANA GOTRAM (VAMSAM):**

Satamarshana Gothri’s are called Srestars or Sottai kulam people in Tamil. YAAMUNAMUNI (Alawandar / Yamunaitturaivan / Suyamuna ha) refers to his reputed lineage referring to his grandfather Nathamuni & Stamarshana.

Ranganatha Tata Charya P.A., has written about the glory of this Gotram in his monograph - “SATAMARSHANA PRABHAVAM”. (Extracted from e-mail)

One opinion is by Shri V Sadagopan, indicates, Purukutsa and Trasa dassu were authorities of Rugvedam. Tras is made-up of 3 kinds of fear which run away by his power derived from penance, he is called trasa dassyu.. All these three Rishis are thus included in the Pravaras of Satha marshana gothris. All are staunch Viashanavites.

One more variation is that “Satha Marshana Sidha Yajna” _(though Parakala Matham has been approached for the book as they are the publishers, I have yet to see the book,_) written by Shri KS Tata Char (Koti Kanya Daanam Krishna Tata char) says lineage as **Angirasa** **à Paurukutsa** **à Trasa dasu** **à Sata marshana.** The **Genealogical tree given by Shri (Dr) Tiruvengala charya shows Satamarshana had three progenies** i.e. **Angirasa, Paurakutsa, Trasadasu.** At present the family Tree held by Shri (Dr) Tiruvengala charya, is taken into consideration. Accordingly his (Satha marshana) 3 (three) children i.e. Angirasa, Purakutsa, Trasasyu are only considered in the present Genealogy.

Pravaram of Tirumala (In daily Sanhdya Vandanam I say my Pravaram ) as known to me is said “Angirasa Purakutsa Trasadassu, Traya Risheya pravaranwita SATA MARSHNA gotra Apastambha Sootra Yajushyakh Adhyayee…”. Hence we have Sata Marshana and his three children i.e. Angirasa, Paurakutsa, Trasadassu, are hallmarks. Although Aghamarshnar is mentioned (in genealogical tree received by me from Shri (Dr) Tiru Vengala Acharya, <probably held ancestrally> of Achampeta (M’nagar – A.P), his – **Aghamarshanar’s** \- name is not included in our pravara.

_Among the 20 gothras, (based on an observations of Pravaras), one can see the Aangirasa Rishi appears 12 times including multiple versions. Aangirasa is the Rishi with whom more than half of the Atharva Veda samhitas are associated. An analysis of the Rishis associated with the Veda Mantras will give info on the other Rishis associated with the twenty Gothras and their lineage._

  

**WHY A FAMILY TREE NOW**  **J**

Primarily, the family tree used to be put in the available mode of presentation, i.e. books, taala patrams, Silaa saasanam, Taamra phalakas, written and this is not a new phenomena in India. To my knowledge, although every-one know that all these were used in olden days by kings and others, -- and poets, do mention their heredity in their poetry. The genealogical trees were mentioned even in epics. RAMAYANA being the oldest epic, we can see the genealogy of Sri Rama (Ch. Canto ) in the book published by Geetha Press Gorakhpur. We may also find genealogy in Mahabharatam. It may not be out of place to mention, that Mahabharata is the 3rd version (III rd). As can be seen from Telugu “Mahabharatam” published by TTD, original epic was named as “JAYAM”, J  and modified version (2nd) as “BHARATAM”,  **J** and the present and IIIrd version is “MAHABHARATAM”. These changes guide us to think that there have been many changes to the original JAYAM epic and addition and deletion may have lead to the modified version in which many modifications could have been added. Hence the genealogy, we may quote for academic interest, but there is possibilities of additions to the Original JAYAM and also BHAARATAM. Next best epic is to quote **BHAGAVATAM** written by Sri Vyasa maha rishi, published by Geeta Press Gorakhpur, in which the genealogical trees are mentioned. Please refer Skanda I, Ch. 1, Ch.8, to view Genealogy. Skanda 1, Ch. 13 & 24, gives details of Dhruva and Pruthu Maharaja’s, 5th Skanda Ch.15, gives details of Bharata Dynasty. 6th Skanda Chapter 6 gives genealogy of Daksha Prajapathi, Ch. 18 gives details of progenies of Diti and Adity. 8th Skanda Ch. 14, gives genealogy of 7 Manus’ , 9th Skanda, Ch. 2 and 6 give details of Ikshwaku dynasty. In the 9th skanda, Ch., 8,12, 17, 20, 21, 22 & 23, 24 gives genealogies of Bhagiratha, Ikshwaku & Janaka, other kings dynasties, Dynasty of Dushyanta (from Puru to Dushyanta), Dynasty of Bharata, Panchala /Kaurava/ Magadha dynasties, dynasties of Vidarbha respectively.

This is the first reason.

Second reason :

For starting genealogy of our family , i.e. SATAMARSHANA “Tirumala”, there is altogether a different reason. In this regard, I wish to mention two strange incidents of mine and are explained here : 

I was going to a marriage. Incidentally the bride and I were traveling in the same compartment and opposite seat was that of the girl. When train halted at Tirupathi, the girl joined her father. Her maternal uncle received me and all of us were at the gate to go out. Since the maternal uncle did intimate to me earlier to my departure, before starting from Hyderabad that the girl is also traveling in this train, I asked the girls’ maternal uncle, who the girl was?. He surprisingly asked me; Did I really not know her? I said ‘yes’. He laughed and said that I traveled with the girl. So strange.

An another incident : Some years back, another strange incident came to my notice. A marriage alliance of a girl was initiated and both sides tentatively agreed subject to approval of an elderly person i.e. grand father of bride groom. The brides’ party went to the grand old man. The grand old man enquired details and came to conclusion that the girl’s father is his own younger brother although the girls’ father went out for adoption into other family & with some more reasons, and resultant loss of contacts between them. Imagine the grand old man’s confusion or name-it-what-you-have.

**There may be many more incidents which are not brought to light. So the best way is to make family trees on paper / computer in modern days (e-mail, / website etc).** _There fore I have decided first to put on paper and then on computerize, put on web-sites. First time I have failed to draw attention of this family members by putting on website. Now I am putting on paper and then on the website._

With these two incidents in my mind, I discussed about drawing a family chart, with my elder brother, Sri Krishnama Acharya who had just finished penning **_“Mareyalagada Surapura Rajara Charitrey”_** in Kannada wherein a family tree is also is given and I sought his opinion. He expressed **incumbent vast difficulties** to be faced, while putting on paper and collection of a full fledged data for  **Genealogical tree** or **Vamsa Vriksham****.**

It was known to us that we belong to the family of Shri Yamuna Charya , yet we did not have the required paper from any where, the sources known to me. So I started with my family, from me upwards, upto Sri Peddayarya, who has been now identified as 7th generation from Sri Yamuna acharya. Sri Yamuna muni (Alawandar) was born in 918 A.D. in South Arcot District, a _villag_e **_Kattu Mannar Koil_**. This is now called as **_Veera Narayana Puram_**_. **Yamuna Muni**_,  after 120 years, has left for abode of Srimannarayana in Paala Kadali. In about ten centuries, his progenies are multiplied and scattered all over in such a large number, **it has become very difficult to trace all of them and to put on Vamsa Vrisham. Even now the situation is same i.e.** I have to trace person of satamarshana gothram, go to him, try to get the details. Many a time I draw blank for the reason that they do not know more than three generation**.** The people of this lineage are so widely scattered, they will not be knowing each other even if they meet or sit together and travel together and work in the same office, unless some one opens talk and enquire of gotram.

I started to work on “_VAMSA VRIKSHAM_” and drew a Genealogical chart based on my personal knowledge. I cross checked with my elder brother’s book **_“MAREYA LAGADA SURAPURA RAJARA CHRITREY”_** _(then a manuscript-cum-and also-proof for printing**)**_, in which our **family tree** is also given. Details were matching as far as our family “_Vamsa Vriksham_” is concerned. But this was limited to our family only and was a limited family tree. What about so many people scattered all over and still many more earlier generations? Only hard work and extensive contacts can bring details. By contacting, number of persons, I received few family trees or genealogical charts.

  

 While this was being progressed, my elder brother, (Author of **“Mareyalagada Surapura Rajara Charitre”** and some more books in Kannada) has expired. By the middle of 2005 many more relatives were lost. I left the genealogical tree. During this time, one gentle man has collected a newspaper cutting under the heading “COMMUNITIES” in Deccan Chronicle, dated 12 JULY 2004 which exhibited a limited details of particular community. The gentleman who was very kind and encouraging, came and shown. He put one QUESTION to me enquiring as to why I should abandon the work which is being done by me. On the contrary I should add some new dimension in the given situation, as particular community have claimed that they “made mark for themselves”. Acharya Utpala (his real name is Shri Pandu Ranga Charya) who made “Srivaishnava Namavalee” has forcefully impressed on me to proceed. Then onwards again I started computing first copy, stating that this was the first copy and some or more additions can lead to accumulate maximum data, **(if not complete)** and arrive at least near reasonable genealogy. Even now it is not complete and exhaustive for few. Again I continued.

This Family Tree (Genealogical chart) of _Srisaila (Tirumala) Peddayarya_ is based on the following Family Trees collected from concerned families, and I developed the same as near and correct as possible:-

1) Recollection of discussions (Brief tele-con discussion / exchange) between me and **_Dr. Lakshmikant Moharyr_**, then a Research scholar for Ph. D. from Gulbarga University.

2) Family tree from Surapuram of Gulbarga District, by Late Shriman **_Bukkapatnam Krishnama charya_** (my elder brother).

4) _Genealogical tree_ dictated by Shri **Wanaparthy Narayna Charya (late) and his nephew, Shri Radha swamy.** This is the 1st detailed Genealogical tree (limited to few families and 7-8 generations, given by Radhaswamy) and detailed corrections by Shri Narayana charya.

5) Family tree from _Dr**. B.T. Jairam**_ (Rtd prof of Telugu ‘versity, at Tirupati, including two updated information, last given in gen-pro software.

6) Hand written Family tree (Xerox copy) given by _Shri **Ananda Ramacharya**_, Executive Editor of “Trikaranmayee Sowrabham”, Hyderabad.

7) Family tree given by **_Shri Ramagopal_**, Advocate, Tarnaka,

11) Details given _by **Smt Vijayalakshmy Venu gopalacharya**_, then near Fever Hospital, & _Shri **Kodanda RamaCharya**_, near Chandulal Baradari. ( Bela).

12) Genealogical chart given by **_Shri HARATHY SOWMITRY_** at Venkateswara colony Mehaboob Nagar. His brother Dr. **_HD_ _Dwarakanath_** at Vikarabad was been approached for the purpose of corrections, additions if any, to the genealogical tree and he has obliged.

13) Genealogical tree dicted by **_Shri Putta Parthy Kamalakanth_** (H.No. Kurnool –

49-2C-15, Lakshmi Nagar, Kurnool). Correction process is on (as on 1-1-2010) in consultation with Smt (Dr) Naga lakshmi, (Doora darshan) for the purpose life profile of Sri Pt. Narayana Charya.

_14)_ **Miscellaneous Family Trees collected, but are not well connected or linked, like _Bookapatnam (VI) , Allurei T.B (V), Kaan cheruvu (IV), etc_**_._

15) Manuscript copy held by **Shri (Dr.) T.G. Tiru Vengala charya** at Achampet, Mehboob nagar dist. He has given his original manuscript copy of Genealogical tree, which has enough details prior to 17th Century ( i.e. 1600 AD and earlier) and reasonable data details of T.G. family. This is the latest collection.(NOVEMBER 2009). I have Xeroxed them and computerized.

**The Family Trees from the following BOOKS are also considered and abstracted**:-

_a)_ “**Mareyalagada Surapura Rajara Charitrey**” _by Shri B. Krishnama charya (late)._ And a genealogical tree written with his own hand

_b)_ “**Venkatarya Vijaya Vaijayanti**” by _Prof. B. Ramaraju garu, in which a family tree is given **based on** genealogical **tree** given by Sriman Kavitarkika Simhacharya **(Atmakoor-A)** both were matching or indistinguishable._ This, OUR family tree is updated periodically or re-written by us depending on the condition of paper say every 10-12 years or even more.

_c)_ “**Contribution of Andhra to Sanskrit Literature**” by p_rof. B. Ramarajugaru, **wherein** portions of family tree are given._

d) “**Kuvalascha Vijayamu**” by _Shri Bukkapattanam Raghava charyulu (late). The family tree is given in shape of poem. Or poetically._

e) “**Golkonda Kavula Sanchika**” edited by _Shri Suravaram Pratap Reddy (1934). (Reprinted in 2002)_

While I was working on family tree, Dr. Lakshmi Kant Moharyr, (from Gulbarga University), then a research scholar, came to residence to check family details since the scholars of his thesis belonged to our family. His thesis was on contemporary Samscrit scholars at the time of Paminayaka, Raja of Surapura.

The first book I have **referred** is “Golkonda Kavula Sanchika” 1934 (Xeroxed from the original book borrowed by Prof. B. Rama Raju garu) (reprinted in Aug 2002) which says **writers from Gulbarga district are 5 (five)** but according to the names listed out, there are 9 (nine) names which are as under:-

**SURAPURAM KAVULU**

**Kavi parichayamu:**

1) Melnaty Rangayya Garu (127)

2) Sata Avadhany Varakur Venkata Sastry Garu (217 )

  

  

**Poorva Kavulu:**

3) Tirumala Bukkapatanam Srinivasa Desika Acharya (2)  (One)

4) Tirumala Bukkapatanam Annayya Dikshita Acharya (3) (Two)

5) Kesavayya (24)

6) Bahari Pamanayaka (74)

7) Tirumla Bukkapatanam Venkata Acharya Kireety (144) (three)

8) Tirumala Bukkapatanam Srinivasa Acharya (158) (four)

9) Tirumala Bukkapatanam Srinivasa Tata Acharya (159) (six)

All the 9 writers are from one place i.e. Surapuram , now Surapura in Gulbarga District. And names at item 3,4,7,8,9, are from Bukkapatnam (Tirumala Bukkapatnam)

**The “Golconda Kavula sanchika (1934) considers names of erstwhile Hyderabad State (or Nizam State) only.**

  

There were five renowned scholars of my family in Sanskrit as mentioned above and Dr. Lakshmikant Moharyr was doing thesis for his Ph. D on the contemporaries of the same period. He has also visited Prof B. Ramaraju garu, for the purpose of his thesis. Though I do not remember, why and how I reached for Prof. Rama Raju garu, and exchanged views on genealogical tree. Since he was editing “Venkatarya Vijaya Vaijayanti” and I belong to this family and somehow, I gave certain details of Surapuram, now (“Shorapur”) “Surapura” in Gulbarga (Karnataka) including the family tree of rulers. The same family details and family tree Raja of Surapura were also included in the book “Rasodhara bhana”. It was clear that four of my ancestors have a definite place in the history of Sanskrit literature. He lent a book **“Golkonda Kavula Sanchika” published in the year 1934 (now reprinted in Aug 2002 by Konda Venkata Lakshmikantha Reddy and published by Vignan Sarovara Prachuranalu No.5).** Altogether there are **108 Srivaishnava writers, out of all 537 writers.** Out of 108 writers, as many as writers 23 writers (as of now known) belong to our Srisaila (Tirumala) family alone and, (this does not include Shri “Bukkapatanam Raghavacharya”) writer of “Kuvaascha Vijayamu” and **Shri Tirumala Ramachandra,** with more than100 books (probably many more books), and many more writers, who are not known to me yet.

The ten (10) names belonging to my family are:-

**SRI VAISHNAVA KAVULU / PANDITULU**

**POORVA KAVULU**

a) Annayya charya  (Surapuram)

b) Annayya dikshitulawaru (Surapuram)

c) Venkatacharya (Kireety) (Surapuram)

d) Srinivasa Desikulawaru (Surapuram)

e) Srinivasa Tata Charya  (Surapuram)

f) Balasaraswathy Srinivasa charya  (Atmakor (A))

g) Krishnamacharya   (Kollapur)

h) Krishnamacharya  (Gadwala)

i) Buchi Venkata Charya  (Gadwala)

j) Rangacharyulu Tirmala Bukkapatanam Atmakur (A)

**The “Golconda Kavula sanchika (1934) considers names of erstwhile Hyderabad State (or Nizam State) only.**

**KAVI PARICHAYAM**

In addition to the above named Sanskrit scholars from Bukkapatanam family, few (14 - fourteen) more are from the same Bukkapattanam family whose names are give below:-

a) Srinivasa Charya

b) Kavitarkika Simhacharya

c) Rangacharyulu

d) Krishna Desikacharyulu

e) Bukkapatnam Ramachandra (Gopalapeta)

g) Dikshacharya Harthy 

h) Venkatacharya Jataka Vidwan

i) Ranga Charya

j) Appalacharya Srisaila

k) Ghanapaty Ahobila Soory

l) Tirumala Venkata Desika

m) Chandragiri Venkata charya (Tirupathy)

n) Singara charya Tirumala (Addanki) (

The fifteenth name is Shri Bukkapatnam Raghavachaya author of “Kuvalascha Vijayamu” .

**The “Golconda Kavula sanchika (1934) considers names of erstwhile Hyderabad State (or Nizam State) only.**

Reverting back to genealogical tree**, most of us, are having the opinion that SRISAILA PEDDAYARYA had three sons,** Tatacharya (Chandragiri or Tirupathy), Satha Gopa charya (Ghanagiri or Penugonda), Annayya charya (Bukkapatnam).

  

UNTIL 2nd Nov 2009 the available data indicated that Sri Saila Peddayarya is having three sons only. However, I received a copy of family tree from **Shri Tiru Vengala Acharya, of Achampet**  , which has shown six (6) progenies, whose names are now being included i.e. **Satha gopa charya** (Donee -Penugonda / Ghanagiri)**, Tirumala(Sri Saila) Tata charya (**Donee **-**Tirupathy / Chandragiri) **, Srinivasa charya, Ramanujacharya, Annayya charya** (Donee – Bukkapatnam) **and Sesha charya****. **

Now, exchange of data lead me to the understanding that , prior to 1700 and up to SRISAILA PEDAYYARYA (or starting from Srisaila Peddayyara down **up to BT Raghavacharya** or any thing else, to have a correct linage) details are **NOT** **available**, and a clear **linage** is yet to be established. Since both of us were working on the same genealogical tree, I have given my version of comparison to Dr. B. T. Jairam , with some more modifications, which is as under:--

 **While we observe - frankly \- only persons belonging branches of Srisaila Peddayarya, are using surname as Bukkapatanam, and others are using their surnames such as Penugonda, T.G. , or only Tirumala.** Right now this is only  observation, and with some more observation of few more family trees, this can be inferred or some one or writers may have written about his genealogy basing on which present inference may change. There is practice of writers in yester years to tell their heredity or genealogy in their literary works. This approach also lead us to near date of their birth / life.

Safely I can say both of us i.e. myself and Dr. B.T. Jayaraman (and also Sri Ananda Ramacharya) belong to the same family. But, which is the branch of Peddayara (i.e. among his six sons), is the criteria to be concluded or the conclusion to be arrived at.

  

After having the data from Vishnu Vardhana to Guru Muni to Yamuna charya (Muni) and from Yamuna Muni to Srisaila Peddayarya to Annayyarya I (Donee of Bukkapatnam) to Annayya Acharya III to myself Rajagopalacharya, let us study the near approximate dates of their life or at least span of life from Yamunacharya to myself and B.T. Jayaraman

Now we have confirmed dates of the following**:**

**NATHA MUNI ……823 A.D. (823-933)**

**YAMUNA MUNI (AALAWANDAR) … 918 A.D. (918-1038)**

**ANNAYYA DIKSHITA ACHARYA … 1704 A.D. (1704-1778)**

**SRINIVASA DESIKA ACHARYA …. 1708 A.D.(1708-1783)**

**B.T. JAYARAM ……1934 A.D**

**B. RAJAGOPALA CHARI …1939 A.D**

**TG TIRUVENGALA CHARYA .. 1934 A.D**

**SRI SAILA PEDDAYARA …** 1380 (Notional, after calculating the real age and generation between Venkata charya III and Rajagopalacharya)

**Sri VENKATA CHARYA … 1696 ( calculated and notional as well )**

**Sri APPALA CHARYA**  **….1700 ( calculated and notional as well )**

**Sri Natha Muni to Aalawandar (Yamunacharya) = 95 years for (3) three generation i.e. 35 years for each generation.**

**From Natha Muni to Srisaila Peddayara there are 462 years equaling to 13 generations, which indicates that 6-7 generations are missing or not recorded.**

**Sri Venkatacharya III to Rajagopala charya = 243 years for (7) generations i.e. 35 years for each generation.**

**Sri Sri Saila Peddayyarya to Rajagopala charya = 559 years for (16) generations i.e. 35 years for each generation.**

**Sri BT Jayaraman is born in 1934. From him upwards to Sri Raghava charya there are eight (8)generations. As per yard stick of 35 years per generation, his YOB is 1660, (contemporary of Sri Srinivasa Tata Charya, father of Srinivasa Desika, Annayya Dikshita, Appala Charya, and eldest Venkata Charya.**

AVERAGE YEARS FOR EACH GENERATION = 35 YEARS

  

  

_Now let us use 35 years per generation as a notional yardstick FOR EACH GENERATION._

  

Aalawandar to Sri Saila Peddayarya = 462 years for (7) generation. (918 A.D. to 1380 A.D. == equaling to 462 years) i.e. 66 years per generation (1380 A.D. to 918 A.D ). The average no. of years per generation is 35 years, and in this case it is 66 years. It is indicative that we are missing another six generations.

**Now about T.G. family.** From Tirukkaran Happiran Pillan whose period is approximately between 910 A.D. to 915 A. D**. SAY 915 A.D**.

From Tirukkaran Happiran Pillan (21st Genaration ) 915 A.D. to Sri Tiruvengala charya T.G. {(and also of TG Raghava charya & Sundara vardhan)} (35th generation) 1934 A.D = 1019 years for 15 Generations. 1019 years divided by 15 generation = 68 years for each generation. @ 35 years per generation 1019 years will have 29 generations. Contgemporary Sri B. Rajagopala charya, is of 42nd generation. Hence it indicates there is **a gap of 14 generations.**

While discussing with Sri T.G. Raghava charya, some time back, has expressed his doubt, whether himself and Shri TG Tiruvenglachaya, have completed (7) seven Generations. **Shri T.G. Raghava charya expressed his doubt whether they are 6th or 7th geeratio**n. Hence there is need to review / need corrections above 6th/7th generation.

There may be some more persons / generations who are **not noted** by any one or it has not come to the light. It may also be that persons between Shri Yamunacharya and Srisaila Peddayarya may be having longer life like Yamuna muni and Ramanujacharya (each one of them lived for 120 years).

  

  

As mentioned earlier I also contacted Shri B.T. Ananda Ramacharya, who gave me “Kuvalascha Vijayamu” wherein the author Sri Bukkapattanam Raghavacharya had given details of BT Family. I have put 4 (four) basic family trees, (1) one by Dr Jayaram, through e-mail & a floppy and (2) second from “Kuvalascha Vijayamu”, (3) third from B.T. Ramagopal and (4) fourth one from B.T.Ananda Rama Charya

Apart from these four genealogical trees, as I said earlier, lot more work is to be done. I contacted few more people and got information from them and penned down. Monthly magazine “Trikaranmayee sowrabham” is having a circulation of about 1000 copies. I requested to Shri Ananda Rama Charya to publish in the magazine. He published continuously for six months. I requested in the above magazine to everyone concerned of Sathamarshana gotra and also surnames like the “Tirumala Bukkapattanam”, or “Bukkapattanam”, or “Bukkapattanam Tirumala”, to please give details of as many families as possible either in shape of “Vamsa Vriksham” held by them, extract from books known to them, or giving specific details or any other details which can improve / add / correct the existing Genealogical Tree. Trikanmayee Sowrabham” management came forward and published for six months seeking / requesting readers to give details of families of Srisaila Peddayyarya. Not an encouraging attempt. Only one family details received i.e. from Dr. Sharad N Char. Later Sri Harthy Raghavacharya had added Harthy Family. Shri Dasarathy of Mehaboob Nagar, and Dr. Dwarakanath, Vikarabad have also contributed, significantly for their lineage / heredity.

Now data collection. It is becoming difficult, as the people are scattered and migrated on account of jobs and other avocations. **_Due to present day constraints and of Job requirements, they are having little time and facilities to study about their ancestors, hence a retired and willing man or one who can devote time should have to work. Hence I started to pursue._**

Some, though not all, known and renown writers of our family are given below:

  

**TIRUPATHI /(CHANDRAGIRI) / SIMHACHALA**

**(CHITTOOR)**

I am still working on the families of Tirupathi (Simhachala / Srisaila). For Srisaila, certain data is available, some data collected by Dr. Jairam, and some by moving in Hyderabad by myself. In a sense I started to collect data of Srisaila Peddayya Arya’s descendants and in the meantime I came across a post card from Prof. (Dr.) B.T.Jayaram. On his advise, I contacted shri Ananda Rama charya. Correspondence & e-mails and also a personal visit by prof. BT Jayaram, Tirupathi, lead to accumulation of a large data belonging to their ancestors. Almost in the same period I came across another B.T. Family through, Smt. Vijayalakshmi Venugopala charya & Shri Kodanda Rama charya (Bela, near Charminar) and by contacting both of them I developed a tree. They are aware that their ancestors migrated **from Kancheruvu**. No further details are available of the leanage prior to Sri Ramachandra Charyulu. There is much more left for progressing. Probably they are also from Bukkapatnam **as** **their surname clearly indicates they both come from Bukka patnam family and probably not from Tirupathi.**

The writers belonging to Tirupathi are as under:-

**1) CHANDRA GIRI VENKATA CHARYA** (P.578 Sl.No.189 of book by Prof. Rama Raju garu)

Although, his genealogy is not available, he is known as from Srisaila Family. His known literary work is “Srungara Bhushana bhana.” He is grand son of Srinivasa Charya of Srisaila Family and descendant of Chandragiri Tata Charya . Chandragiri is in Chittoor district.

**2) APPALA CHARYA Sanskrit Scholar (probably resident of Tirupathy)** (P. 48, S.No.13 of book by Prof. Rama Raju garu)

Father and mother of Appala Charya were Raghava Charya and Lakshmi. He has composed Yadugiri Bhushana campu in nine cantos (ratnas) praising the sanctity and greatness of Melkote (also known as Yadavagiri or YADUGIRI, TIRUNARAYANAPURAM) which is one of the pilgrim place of Sri Vaishnavas (Available in Madras). He had skill in Sanskrit and Telugu. Though Time is not known but his guru is Veera Raghava.

**3) RAGHAVA CHARYA Bukkapatnam Tirimala (**Period 1848 to 1908)

Entire details about this writer is from “**Kuvalascha vijayamu”** a poetry  written by him. The family tree also is given his book in the First Canton itself. The book was hand-written in 1920s. He knows Sanskrit, Andhra (Telugu), and Hoona . The manuscript was in SV University. Gomatham Vijaya Lakshmi, while doing her research in SV University has copied and ultimately reached Sri Ananda Rama Charya of Trikaranmayee Publisher. Any other works of Shri B.T. Raghavacharya, are now known.

  

  

  

**N E L L O R E**

  

**4) TIRUVENKATA TATA DESIKA of Takkella padu of Nellore Dist.** (P. 243 Sl. No. 68 of book by Prof. Rama Raju garu).

Sri Vaishnava of Tirumala Family from Addanki or Addanki Tirumala. . And his father is Vidya Bhooshana Singara Charya who has written Meghananda Vijayavya Yoga and Great SansKrit Scholar.

Tiru Venkata Tata Desika born in 1892 and resident of Chirala (Cirala) was scholar in Telugu, Sanskrit and Prakrit (prakrut). A) **Mantra Rasa Saastra** is one of the books written by him. B) **Stuti malika Part I, II, III, and IV c) Sri Vakula Bhushana maliaka Satakam (printed in Devanaari) d) Varadaraja Stuti e) Sriman nrusimha nakha ashtakam (Prined in Telugu) F) Tamraparni stutih G) Madhura Kavi stutih h) Vikranta Prekshanakam j) Upadesa sara rasayanam k) Uttara Rama Charita Vyakhya L) aduka stuthih m) Subhashita Tarangini. N) Tiruvenkata tata desika’s narasimhastakam.** It is understood that the books are available with their descendants at Cirala and Takkellapadu.

**5) SINGARACHARYA ADDANKI TIRUMALA of Takkellapadu Agraharam Nellore (**p.661 / Sl. No. 211)

He is father of Sri Tiruvenkata Desika mentioned at Sl. No. 4 above. He was titled as **VIDYA BHUSHANA** . He was a scholar and poet in sanscrit of considerable merit. Vyayoga type of dramatic compositions are rarely written . **MEGHANADHA VIJAYA VYAYOG** explaining the battle between Meghanada or Indrajit son of Ravana and Lakshmana and Victory of Lakshmana over Meghanadha.. The vyayoga dramatic composition was published in 1945 Kalikuma Granthamala Series No. 11, Ayodhya, but lived during 19th century.

  

**PENUGONDA (GHANAGIRI) SAMSTHANAM**

  

There is very limited data available of only two / threee families now belonging to Penugonda /Ghanagiri. The inheritors of this area may be in around Bellary/ Anantapur etc. Although I contacted some persons, I got no result yet from Ananthapur. Not much of details are available or my efforts are not sufficient.

There is enough scope for improving of data. I have just started on families belonging to Satha Gopa Charya of Penugonda / Ghanagir

  

The writers belonging to Penugonda are as under:-

**1) AHOBILA SURI (Ghanapati) OF PENUGONDA** **(Penugonda is also known as Ghana giri)** ( P.60 Sl..18 of book by Prof. Rama Raju garu).

His parents are Tirumala Venkata Charya and Lakshmi . He has written “Yatiraja Vijaya campu” which depicts important incidents in life of Sri Ramanuja. It also describes Alwars and Acharyas of earlier to Sri Ramanuja Charya. Since he conjure or initiate and pray, Sri Vedanta Desika, he must be Vadagalai Sri Vaishnava. He describes himself as disciple of Sri Ramanuja Muni. Penugonda was Capital of Sri Krishna Deva Raya earlier to Vijaya nagar.

 **2) PUTTAPARTHY NARAYANA CHARYA , TIRUPATHY:** Details are awaited. Personally twice or thrice I visited Doordarshan to take some more details on genealogy and also brief life profile from Smt Dr.Nagalakshmi.

  

  

**B U K K A P A T N A M.**

Not much is known earlier to Shri Srinivasa Tata Charya (Venkatamba) who had four sons. IInd son Annayacharya had two sons, 1st Nrusimha charya, 2nd son Srinivasa Tata charya (Lakshmamba). Srinivasa Tatachaya had Four sons, Venkatacharya, Appalacharya, Annayya Dikshita chaya and Srinivasa Desikacharya. The two illustrious sons, were scholars of high order, and they have given their heredity or forefathers. Annayya (Dikshita) Charya’s 2nd son Sri Kirity Venkatachraya is one among the most famous poet and sanscrit language. In the Durbar of Peshwa at Pune, none could match him. “Mareyalagada Surapura Samsthan Rajara charitrey”, attribute 15 books to his credit. Although many express their opinion that he lived 32 yeas only, no one has inked anywhere, as to when and where his worldly / mortal avatara was completed. On the available information & as inferred by me (I am doing some effort to have access in Pune to find out more about him) as he, along with his brothers, have migrated to Pune Durbar of Peshwa.

**SURAPURAM FAMILIES****.**

**1 ANNAYYA CHARYA** TIRUMALA BUKAPATNAM. (P.394 Sl. No. 2-)(GKS 1937)

His period is approximately

(He is great grand father of Kirity Venkata charya charya. And grand father of Annayya Diksita charya and Srinivasa Desikacharya). In my Genealogical tree it is mentioned as Annayya Charya III. Golkonda Kavula Sanchika 1937 gives credit of the following books **a) Desika Yesho bhooshanamu, b) Acharya vimsati c) Sidhanta Ratnavali d) Sidhanta vaijayantamu**

**2. TIRIMALA BUKKAPATNAM SRINIVASA TATA CHARYA (LAKSHMAMBA) (Shatha Marshana Gotra)** PERIOD APPROXIMATELY 1600. A.D as per Golkonda Kavula Sanchika. (s.saka 1630) (P.413 SL No.159 )(GKS-1937)

He is son of Annayya Charya SL.No.1, above. Except that he has four sons who, at the invitation of Surapuram Raja, migrated to Surapuram, not much is known. However **Golkonda Kavula Sanchika** quotes **“Rasodhara Bhanamu**” as his literary work**.** Perhaps he may have also moved along with his four sons, i.e. a) Venkatacharya, b) Appala charya, c) Annayya Dikshita Charya (father of Kirity Venkata Charya) and d) Srinivasa Desika charya (Balasaraswathy Srinivasa charya is in his continued line of genealogy).

**3. ANNAYYA (DIKSHITA) CHARYA (SURAPURAM**) PERIOD 1704 to 1778. (salivahana saka 1526) **(Father of Kirity Venkata charya).** (P.394 SL NO. 3)

He is 3rd son of Srinivasa Tata Charya (Sl No. 2 above). He is elder brother of Srinivasa (Desika) Acharya. **(Since he performed Vajapeya, Paundarika, Garudacayana, aptoryama etc.hence he is called as Annayya Dikshita)** There was a Zamindari system in erstwhile Nizam state (Hyderabad State) and Surapuram (Surapura/ Shorapur) was one of Zamindari (Samsthana) ruled by Telugu Naykas, and known as Bedars. In Telugu it is known as Boya, community. The root of this words as said by shri Tirumala Ramachandra is **Vyadha, (hunter** **àByadha** **àByada****àBeda** **àbedara in Kannada).** Surapuram was ruled by these bedars. During the period of Paminayaka (1752-1773) he had invited scholars to his Samsthanam, and one family from Bukkapatnam (now in Anantapur, then probably in J’madugu, Kadapa,) was invited. The four sons of Srinivasa Tata charya II (Venkatamba) are Venkatarya, Appalarya, Annayyarya (Annayyadikshita – Pedda Ayyawarlu) and Srinivasa Desikarya (Chinnayya warlu). Many writers have taken only three sons of Srinivasacharya (Venkatamba) in to consideration, including Prof. Raghu Nathacharya, at Tirupathy, Prof Rama Raju garu, at Hyderabad and many more. Actually, they are four brother. Venkata charya remained as Rajguru, and the other two as Vidya Gurus and Aasthana Vidwans. The opinion of three brothers was corrected in the book “MAREYALAGADA SURAPURA RAJARA CHARITREY” by late Sri B. Krishnamacnarya (He himself was a Rajaguru till his expiry in 2005 ??). During the same period, Prof B. Ramarajugaru, was editing “Venkatarya Vijaya Vaijayanti”, and on showing our extensive genealogy - family tree, Prof B. Ramaraju garu, has corrected the same i.e. as four children.

By invitation, these scholars moved from Bukapatnam to Surapuram. After the migration of four brothers continued their literary persuite. In Surapuram, local people started calling them as Bukkapatnam family, which still continues. The actual surname should have been and it is, Tirumala (Bukkapatnam). The family expanded. Gradually migration started to Atmakur (A), Gadwala, Wanaparthy, and other samsthanams of Erstwhile Nizam State. Venkata charya, Annaya charya and Srinivasa charya all received patronage of Paminayaka, (who was himself a scholar. His “Bhargava Purana” is well known in Telugu Literature). One among his i.e.Annayyacharya’s, four children is “KIRITY VENKATACHARYA”

THERE ARE **TWO SAMADHIES** OF ANNAYYA DIKSHITA CHARYA AND SRINIVASA DESIKA CHARYA **IN SURAPUAM.** In Kannada it is called as Surpur (Shorapur) BRINDAVANAM OR **SAMADHIES ARE CONSTRUTED FOR SANYASIES.** IT IS NOT KNOWN, HOW AND WHEN THEY HAVE TAKEN SANYASAM.

There are 3 (three) books to his credit**.** A) Geetartha sangrahamu, b) Vyakhya Virodhi Varodhini Pramadini, c) Rasodara bhana (not yet printed).  However, Prof. Rama Raju garu, gives credit of seven books. The remaining four are a) Tatwaguna Darsha b) Acharya Vimsathi. C) Desika Yeso Bhushanam d) Abhinava Karnamrutha e) Ananda TaraTamya khandanam f) Vyavaharikatva Khandana Sara . **Bhana** is referred by both. It is in this book he has given his genealogical tree.

** 4. SRINIVASA (DESIKA) CHARYA TIRUMALA BUKKAPATNAM (Shatha Marshana Gotra)** Period 1708 to 1783 (S. Saka 1600.) **(YOUNGER UNCLE OF Kirity Venkat charya )** (Sl.no. 158 of p.413)

He is fourth and last son of Srinivasacharya II (Lakshmamba). He is mentor of Kiriti Venkata Charya (son of Annayya Dikshita Charya). He is also known as ABHINAVA NIGAMANTA DESIKA OF SRISAILA (TIRUMALA) BUKKA PATTANAM family..

One of the argument is, after migration of Kiriti Venkatacharya to Pune Peshwas, both these brothers may have renounced the worldliness.

In his book “Rasodara bhana”, he has mentioned his genealogy. Unlike his brother’s children (Venkatacharya Kirity, and three brothers children) of Srinivasa desika charya have not migrated and remained in Surapuram. . He has 60 books to his credit as mentioned in “Contribution of Andhra to Sanskrit Literature, while Golkonda Kavula Sanchika 1934 claims twelve (12) books i.e**. a) Tatwa marthandamu (24000 slokas) b) nayadyumni guna mimasa, c) Sidhanta Chintamany, d) Upasamhara Vijaya parajaya e) Gnana Ratna Prakasika f) Chatu sootriya, g) trayanta ghanta patha h) dur upadesa dhikkara j) rahasya traya sara gatha vyakha k) datta ratna pradipia, L) grahana bhukti deepika m) sri jayanti Nirnayam.** However, prof. B. Ramaraju garu claims 60 books **.** Since there are more than 2 Srinivasacharyas inthis family, there is every possibility of getting confused. At present “Golconda Kavula Sanchika “ is taken into consideration.

Sri Balasaraswathi Srinivasa charya, 6th generation in linage, was in Atmakoor(A) Samsthana and belongs to genealogical line Srinivasa Desika charya of Surapuram. . He is a stalwart by himself and by his own right.

**Names of Srinivasa Charya and Venkatacharya are often repeated and as such there is every possibility of mixing orattributing their works one to another. Golkonda Kavula Sanchika, at present is considered authentic.**

  

**P U N E (P O O N A) MAHA-RASHTRA**

  

**1. VENKATA CHARYA _KIRITI_ , TIRUMALA BUKKAPATTANAM. Period 1773 to 1802 A.D.** . (Sali vahahana saka 1730) ( Sl. No.144 of P.411).

Born in Surapuram

He is the second son of Sri Annyya Dikshitacharya. So far not much is known as far as his brothers except that they are four children and he was a scholar in Surapuram and migrated to Pune and made his own place in Peshwa Durbar. Venkataya Vijaya Vaijayanti, a drama written by Bala Saraswathi Srinivasa Charya gives extensive details of happening in the Durbar of Madhava Rao Peshwas, but is silent about his family like brothers, and their children However, Parkala matha Vaibhavam book gives some details. When Parakal yateendra, His holiness sri ……..visited nasik one Diksha charya invited swamiji to his residence. It is also said in Venkatarya Vijaya vaijayanthi, he moved extensively. And also stated he stayed 12 years in durbar of Peshwas. Therefore he may have lived longer than 32 years. Probably he may have migrated to Pune at 32 years and it may have been taken as end. Since no one has come in to my contact in spite of my best efforts with some persons at Pune and Nasik. Bala Saraswathi Srinivasa charya, in his drama “Venkatrya Vijaya Vaijayanthi” now edited by Prof. B. Rama Raju garu, has given biography and all the happenings of Peshwa Durbar during the period and also the picture of Social Structure prevailing in and around areas like Atmakur, Surapuram,Gadwal, Poona etc., of that period.

His literary achievements are 22 books. Golkonda kavula sanchika attributes 12 books. They are **a) Gada dhariya Khandanau (Jhanjha marutam), b) Srungara Tarangini, c) Alankara Kaustubham, d) Rasika manaso llasamu bhanamu e) sukabhipatanamu, f) usha parinayamu, natakau g) Yatiraja Dandakamu, h) Hayagriva Dandakamu j) Dasavatara stotramu , k) Bhava satakamu l) Achalatmaja parinayamu m)Gaja Sootra wadamu n) Sringara Lahari.**

The name of “Venkata charya” is often repeated, there is every possibility of getting confused. Accordingly 10 books have been attributed to him, instead of the other Venkata Charya.

  

  

**A T M A K O O R (A M A R A C H I N T A)**

**M A H A B O O B N A G A R (A. P)**

**1. SRINIVASA CHARY (BALA SARASWATHI)** **TIRUMALA BUKKA PATTANAM ( 22-04-1862 TO 1920)** (s. saka 1785 to 1841 ) (p,353 Sl.no.11)

He is son of Buchi Venkata charya and Seshamamb. He was born and brought up at Atmacoor (Amarachinta) of Mahaboobnagar District. He is the fourth generation from Srinivasa Desika charya (Lakshmamba). Srinivasa Desikacharya had four sons, Venkata Raghavacharya, Venkata Rangacharya, Kasturi Ranga Charya, and Srinivasa charya. The last son Srinivasa charya had a son Ranganatha Charya (Bucchemamba), and he had a son Srinivasacharya (Venkatamba). Srinivasacharyas’ first son Buchi Venkatacharya (Seshamamba), Bala Saraswathi Srinivasa Charya is son of Bucchi Venkata charya. From the child hood , he was extreamly geneous, and finished sahitya and alankara works by 11 years. Later studied and grammer and astrology. At the age of 16 , he went to Mysore for further studies. His extra ordinary intelligence, was noticed by the Maharaja of Mysore Chamarajendra Wodeyar, through his court poets / vidwans, and Mysore Maharaja conferred the title of BALA SARASWATHI. It is this Bala Saraswathi Srinivasa charya has written a book Venkatarya Vijaya Vaijayanthi , wherein he has narrated much about Kiriti Venkata Charya and his contemporary picture of state like Gadwall, Avuku, Surapuram, and Poona (now Pune). The last act of this Drama give details of expedition of Kiriti venkata charya in Poona (in the durbar of Peshwa). He made extensive tour of India and won laurels to his credit. He had settled in Atmakur (Amarachinta), and Ruler of Atmakoor gave him enough for his lively hood. But he established an institution through which he invited scholars, conducted discourses and rewarded them. He is credited with 22 books. However Golkonda Kavula Sanchika attributes 9 books only which are given below..

**a)** **sata ghanta avadhanamulu b) srinivasa vilasamu c) veera saiva sirasthadanamu d) durvigraha nigrahamu e) nanjaraja parinaya champu f) tatwa marthanda prabha patalamu g) Kiriti Venkatarya Vijaya Vaijayanti natakamu h) Raja vamsa ratnavali j) Lakshmi saraswathi dandakamulu.**

**2)** **RANGA CHARYA** TIRUMALA BUKKA PATNAM. (P.386 Sl, No.350)

Yet he has written two books i.e. **a) Guna Ratnakaramu b) Padmini Parinayamu champu not printed**. These two books were available in Amara chinta (Mehaboob nagar). He is very near relative, probably paternal uncle of Bala Saraswathy Srinivasa Charya..

**4)** **RANGACHARYA** Tirumala Bukkapatnam. (page 386 Sl.No. 149)

Not very much is known, except that he hails from the family of Kiriti Venkata charya. He is born at Atmakoor (A)

**5)** **VENKATA CHARYA,** JATAKA VIDANMANY (Sl.No. 347 Page 386)

He was Rajaguru of Atmakoor Samsthanam. Not much is known. However it is clear that he is son of Venkata charya and grandson of Bala Saraswathy Srinivasacharya. He was born in 1913 approximately. I was just in early teens or even below 10 years when he visited, and read the inscriptions on the stone on the compound Wall of Samadhies. He was preserving few manuscripts and I personally contacted his daughter staying in Atmakoor as on that day for these books and these were parted one by one for publications. Details are not known.

**7) HARATHY DIKSHA CHARYA.** (Sl.No. 337 Page No. 385)

Harathy name is acquired by this family, as the use to perform Harathy with a very big vessel to the Deity of their family,. Probably the name is acquired from Singaracharya onwards. It is believed that the family used to perform exemplary Harthy in a big plate with lighting camphor or other type of fragrant. Hence surname Harthy. Sri Harthy Dikshacharya was born in Amara chinta (Atmakoor), Mahaboobnagar. His unpublished books **are a) Mahantarlapa ratnamala b) Srinivasa Samstuti c) Sri Rama Mangala Harathy, d) Srirama Kesava stuti e) Alankarana Manimala f) Acharya gadyam g) Acharya visati.**
