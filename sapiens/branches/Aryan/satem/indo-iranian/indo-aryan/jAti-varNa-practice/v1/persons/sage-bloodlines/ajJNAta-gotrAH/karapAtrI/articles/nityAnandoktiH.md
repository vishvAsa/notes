The above paragraph is from a small article I wrote last year on Karapātra Svāmī falling for an American creationist hoax in his book ‘Mārksavāda Aura Rāmarājya’.

## When Karapātra Svāmī fell for an American creationist hoax

Karapātra Svāmī was undoubtedly a great scholar of Sanskrit, Sanātana scriptures and Vedānta. His works in these fields are an invaluable addition to the Indic knowledge traditions. However, outside these fields, his knowledge was quite limited. He had no training or specialised knowledge in non-Indic languages, history, science, anthropology, etc. This, per se, is not a problem; there are limits to every human mind. But it becomes a problem when a scholar ventures way out of their areas of scholarship, not knowing where to stop, and starts speaking or writing about things they have zero idea about. This was a big problem with Karapātra Svāmī (or his ghostwriters, more on this later); he did not know where and when to stop.

The same Karapātra Svāmī who would astonish and inspire readers by writing on topics he specialised in would almost always reduce himself to a laughing stock by writing tomes with supreme confidence on topics outside his expertise. For example, 

- he would confidently date Pythagoras, who lived in the sixth century BCE, to the thirteenth century CE. 
- He would mock and chide great minds like Āryabhaṭa, Kepler and Newton for believing in the earth’s rotation and then establish with his ‘arguments’ and ‘proofs’ that the earth does not rotate. 
- He would emphatically declare that scientists measuring the speed of light means nothing, adding that only the astronomical bodies mentioned in the Sūrya-Siddhānta move; other stars and comets are stationary. 
- He would derive the Hebrew names Shem and Ham (names of two of the three sons of Noah in the Hebrew Bible) from Sanskrit ‘soma’ and ‘hema-garbha’ and thus ‘prove’ that Noah of the Bible was Manu and his sons Shem and Ham were Candravaṃśī and Sūryavaṃśī kings Soma and Hemagarbha. 
- He would venture into biology and state that an amoeba is a more complex life form than all plants and trees because it can form a hole (referring to the food vacuole) in its body. 
- He would quote from the many works of Christian creationists (of all people!) of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries to ‘disprove’ the theory of evolution and then go on to establish, with his own ‘arguments’ and ‘proofs’, his theory of ‘devolution’. 

This is just a sample of his writings outside his areas; there are hundreds of pages filled with such preposterous nonsense. Thankfully, these writings of Karapātra Svāmī are still in Sanskrit or Hindi. If they, or extracts from them, are translated into English, the whole world will laugh at how out-of-date and ridiculous Hindu traditional thought was as of the late 20th century. Sanātana/Hindu tradition believes in acquiring knowledge from everybody. The Hindus of yore learned a lot from the Greeks and the Romans: Sanskrit texts like the Yavanajātaka and the Pañcasiddhāntikā (with its Romakasiddhānta and Pauliṣasiddhānta) were the results of assimilating knowledge from foreigners. They had an open mind, unlike Karapātra Svāmī..

Many modern scholars believe that the Vedic commentaries attributed to Sāyaṇa are the work of many people, not one. Similarly, several people, including me, believe that some works attributed to Karapātra Svāmī were written by a group of scholars (ghostwriters) in addition to Karapātra Svāmī. Karapātra Svāmī did not have advanced knowledge of foreign languages and the requisite training in specialised disciplines (Western philosophy, comparative anatomy, evolutionary biology, etc.) required to understand, let alone critique, the works of Hegel, Kant, Huxley, Darwin, etc. 

How was Karapātra Svāmī then able to read, understand, critique and mock the works of these authors and many others quoted in the Hindi book ‘Mārksavāda Aura Rāmarājya’ (“Marxism and rule of Rāma”, मार्क्सवाद और रामराज्य, 1957)? It is unlikely he was reading translations because many works (e.g., John Dawson’s “Modern Ideas of Evolution”) cited in the book were never translated into Hindi or Sanskrit. Surely, other scholars were reading, summarising and also ghost-writing for Karapātra Svāmī. 

Rahul Sankrityayan, the Marxist scholar and polyglot who knew thirty languages, wrote that the study of works and literature referenced in the book ‘Mārksavāda Aura Rāmarājya’ was beyond the capabilities of Karapātra Svāmī, and it was clear that Karapātra Svāmī’s disciples had helped him wholeheartedly in this endeavour. Like Karapātra Svāmī, Sankrityayan was also a tall scholar with his flaws. However, this particular observation of Sankrityayan was spot on. Karapātra Svāmī was indeed helped by ghostwriters in writing this book.

Now we come to the topic alluded to in the title of the post: the Nevada shoeprint hoax. In the early 1920s, some American creationists, including the Catholic creationist Alfred W. McCann, claimed that a “Triassic shoe sole fossil” had been found in Nevada. McCann and others claimed that the ‘fossil’, which looked like a partial shoeprint to them, was proof that humans walked around with shoes in the Triassic age and thus ‘disproved’ the theory of evolution. While the current location of the ‘fossil’ is unknown, the photos of the same were published in the 1920s. From the photos, the object looks like a rock concretion. In 1922, McCann published an anti-evolution book peddling this shoeprint hoax. 

The book was slammed by both atheists and creationists for various reasons (a rebuttal was printed in the same year), and the hoax was never taken seriously by geologists, even though some other conspiracy theorists and creationists have brought up the Nevada shoeprint hoax now and then. By the early 1950s, the hoax had been debunked thoroughly. In a book published in 1952, science writer Martin Gardner dismissed McCann’s work in just two lines. 

But none of this mattered to Karapātra Svāmī (or his ghostwriters) writing in 1957. He (or they) presented the Nevada shoeprint as further ‘evidence’ and used it to build another ‘argument’ to ‘disprove’ evolution in ‘Mārksavāda Aura Rāmarājya’. Karapātra Svāmī neither understood the writings of Huxley and Darwin nor their arguments and theories. But he built up his case against their sound theories with such laughable titbits, including discredited hoaxes popularised by Christian creationists in the 1920s. Sankrityayan rightly said that Karapātra Svāmī relied on a gossipmonger to publish this claim.

This is not to discredit Karapātra Svāmī or praise Sankrityayan. Karapātra Svāmī remains relevant for Sanskrit and Vedānta studies and is an ācārya/guru worth honouring. But not everything he wrote was correct. By venturing into areas outside his expertise, he made himself (and Hindu intellectuals) an object of ridicule.
