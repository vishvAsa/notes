"Why is it so? Where have we, deeply orthodox, ritualistic, endogamous even 30 years ago, faltered so badly."


## Maladaption to modernity under pressure
Communities in the vicinity of politico-economic capitals (madras, bangalore, calcutta) at the advent of modernity were infected by (proto-)wokeness at a greater rate.

Particular cases:

- Several chennai vaDakalai shrI-vaiShNava-s went rogue - (higher concentration/ dominance in pallava-nADu)

  - N Ram of Hindu
  - Kamal Hasan
  - TTK group of Prestige pressure cooker fame and also N Murali etc., which patronized MMA (Madras Music academy), which eventually conferred sangIta-kalAnidhi title on the rabid activist singer Thodur Madabussi Krishna (of the same family).

## Active English intellectual subversion
- See [rivals/academia/charges](../../../../rivals/academia/charges/) page for examples of systematic disparagement of Hindu origins of many scientific / mathematical ideas, and their conspicuous absence in education, leading to stunted formation of a confident hindu version of modernity.
