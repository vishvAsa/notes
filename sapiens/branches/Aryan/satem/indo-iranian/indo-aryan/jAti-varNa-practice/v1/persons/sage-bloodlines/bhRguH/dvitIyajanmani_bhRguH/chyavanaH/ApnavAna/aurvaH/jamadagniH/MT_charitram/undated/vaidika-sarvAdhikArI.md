I can see the narrow devotional focus of those brought up in the vaiShNava ekAntika-dharma. However, even with smArta-s whose devotional focus is a little more spread-out it might cover only a few more deities and for many viShNu (often an anthropomorphic avatAra) or shiva remain devotional foci. That's largely so even within my smArta family though the veda is practice and revered by those who have not degenerated. 

In contrast to that I'm particularly more atavistic& more the vaidika religion-centered sarvAdhikArin type sort of like the last great roman emperor Julian (by no means am claiming to have his virtues üôÇ). 

Focal bhakti to 1-4 deities with occasional attention to rest within a vedAntika framework is for most part the main stay among lay H. However, neither that type of bhakti nor that vedAntika framework has ever gelled with me from when I was a kid.

As abhinavagupta said there are those who are good yogin-s and those who can be scholastic and hold the tradition. The former capacity is a must for mantrasiddhi. I knew relatively early that my yoga capacity was weak; so mantrasiddhi is correspondingly weak
