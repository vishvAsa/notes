PBA Swami Vaibhavam  
By Sri T.S. SundaraRajan

## Pedigree
Sri Kanchi Prativadi Bhayankaram AnnangarachAriar Swami was born in the year 1891, ‘mIna-viSAkham of year vikrti’, in SrIvatsa gOtram, of the noble ‘muDumbai’ descent, same as SrI piLLai-lOkAchArya and his brother SrI azhagia-maNavALa-perumAL nAyanAr. ‘mithuna Sukla-EkAdasI’ is the ‘tiru-adhyayana-tithi’ of svAmi (1891-1983) of blessed memory. The title ‘prativAdi-bhayankaram’ was given to his ancestor SrI-hastigiri-aNNA, by no less than Srivarada nAyanAcharya, the son of svAmi vEdAntadESikan. This PB ‘mUla-purusha’ became one of the chosen ‘ashTa-dig-gaja’ disciples of SrI-maNavALa mAmunigaL. Thus, the PB lineage represents the confluence of two eminent AchArya, viz., svAmi-dESikan and SrI mAmunigaL. Hence the PB ‘tanian’:

वेदान्त-देशिक-कटाक्ष-विवृद्ध-बोधं  
कान्तोपयन्तृ-यमिनः करुणैक-पात्रम्।   
वत्सान्ववायम् अनवद्य-गुणैर् उपेतम्  
भक्त्या भजामि परवादि-भयङ्करार्यम्॥

prativAdi-bhayankaram aNNangarAchArya-svAmi is remembered in Srirangam simply as the ‘kAnchi-svAmi’. His education commenced under his own father, PB SrI-rangAcharya who, in the short span of his life, had had such distinguished disciples as jagad-guru gAdhi anantAchArya-svAmi who later established the tiruvEnkatam-uDaiyAn sannidhi in FanasvADi, Mumbai. The education continued under his maternal grandfather (later the azhagia-maNavALa jIyar alias chatus-shashTi-kalA jIyar) and gAdhi svAmi himself, giving him an academic pedigree no university could ever match.

## Devotion
In the world of letters, religion and philosophy, kAnchisvAmi was truly a Renaissance kind of figure. He was a ‘prAtah-smaraNIyah’ (one to remember at sunrise) to anyone who had had the fortune to meet him, or even to look at him from a way off, or had read any of his works, or had attended his discourse. His life, centred in dEvaperumAL (SrIvaradarAja perumAL) as it was, wrote itself as a commentary on SrIkrshna’s exhortation,

> “tasmAt sarvEshu kAlEshu mAm anusmara yudhya cha  
mayyarpita-mano-buddhih mAm Eva Eshyasi asamSayah”
(SrImad-bhagavad-gItA 8:7)

## Books
His first publication was the title ‘divya-prabandha-vaibhava-vivEkah’ written in Sanskrit to establish the canonical status of AzhvAr ‘aruLich-cheyal’ as equal to the ‘gIrvANa vEdam’. His monumental work consisted of the first-ever publication of the complete works of svAmidEsikan, SrIrAmAnuja, and maNavALA-mAmunigaL; his own Sanskrit translation of the divyaprabandham and of the ‘rahasya’ (esoteric) classics ‘mumukshuppaDi’, ‘tatva-trayam’ and ‘SrIvachana-bhUshaNam’; and his own Tamil commentary ‘divyArtha-dIpika’ on the entirety of divya-prabandham, SrIvachana-bhUshaNam and AchArya-hrdayam. His ‘vEda-lakshana’ works are original investigations into vedic grammar and semantics, and have not been duplicated.

## sampradAya-sevA
His annual ‘tiruppAvai’ discourses in Madras (now Chennai) city constituted his most visible service to the ‘sampradAyam’, and these gave a festive look to the city environs themselves. Besides the dEvaperumAL ‘adhyApaka-gOShTHI’ in kAnchIpuram, he also adorned namperumAL gOShTHI as its centrepiece whenever he visited Srirangam. The ‘iyal-SAttu’ has the verse 

> “Uzhi-torum...nUl Odi,  
> vIthi vAzhi ena varum  
> tiraLai vAzhttuvAr tam malar  
> aDi en Sennikku malarnda pUvE” 
> 
> (Watch the devotees in formation walking the streets and reciting the divya-prabandham;  
> and there be those that bless this ‘gOshThI’, and  
> I shall carry their sacred feet as a flower of decoration on my forehead.)

This was the very sentiment evoked by kAnchi svAmi’s gOshThI.

## Conclusion
He attained his acharyan thiruvadi on (June 21 1983) ‘mithuna Sukla EkAdaSI’, the day of ‘Ani-garuDan’ marking periAzhvAr Sattumurai. I have never ceased to wonder that kAnchi svAmi’s kind of accomplishments were at all possible in one lifetime. All excellence partakes of divinity (yad-yad vibhUtimat sarvam: SrImad bhagavad-gItA 10:41), and this is how we are to understand of the kAnchi svAmi. It is a memory that purifies.
