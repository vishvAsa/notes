## mAhatyam.

Critical channel in transmission of yoga-paramparA (others being shivAnanda . .) from samnyAsI-s. As Yoga Journal described in an article entitled, "The Legacy of Krishnamacharya," "You may never have heard of him but Tirumalai Krishnamacharya influenced or perhaps even invented your yoga. Whether you practice the dynamic series of Pattabhi Jois, the refined alignments of B.K.S. Iyengar, the classical postures of Indra Devi, or the customized vinyasa of Viniyoga, your practice stems from one source: a five-foot, two-inch Brahmin born more than one hundred years ago in a small South Indian village."

He is widely considered as the architect of _vinyasa_,[[6]](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tirumalai_Krishnamacharya#cite_note-Ruiz-5) in the sense of combining breathing with movement.
