In that school, there were two Hindu teachers who taught Kannada. The strength of the school was about a hundred. The headmaster of the school was a person by name &lt;em&gt;Janab&lt;/em&gt; Mustafā. He was known for his scholarship in Urdu, Arabic, and Persian.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;k-v-ramaswami-iyer-part-1&#34;&gt;K V Ramaswami Iyer (Part 1)&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;[[K V Ramaswami Iyer (Part 1)&#x9;Source: &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.prekshaa.in/kv-ramaswami-iyer-part1&#34;&gt;prekshaa&lt;/a&gt;]]&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I have already written about my Sanskrit teacher, Kashi Raghavendracharya elsewhere.&#xA;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; I shall now move on to reminiscences of my English teacher.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It appears that Mulbagal secured the benefit of English education during 1900. Before this, there were only two or three people literate in English apart from those employed by the Post Office. One of them was Ramachandracharya from Kaveripattinam. I have made a mention of him earlier.&#xA;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Another one was an assistant teacher at the Telugu School by name Māraśèṭṭi. He hailed from the &lt;em&gt;baṇajiga&lt;/em&gt;&#xA;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; community. The members of this community were among the disciples of a certain &lt;em&gt;Śrīvaiṣṇava ācārya&lt;/em&gt;. One S Rangacharya was the Inspector of Sanskrit schools in Mysore. This Rangacharya’s elder brother was Vèṅkaṭācārya. He was a great scholar as well. Our Māraśèṭṭi and his ancestors were among the numerous disciples under Vèṅkaṭācārya’s tutelage. Māraśèṭṭi’s father Muniyappa, out of his regard for Vèṅkaṭācārya, had sent his son to Mysore for education. Māraśèṭṭi had learnt a bit of English during this time. It seems like he had completed an equivalent of Matriculation&#xA;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:4&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:4&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; that was in existence back then.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;[[Kolar Lodging&#x9;Source: &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.prekshaa.in/kolar-lodging-d-v-gundappa&#34;&gt;prekshaa&lt;/a&gt;]]&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Upon completing my first year of high school (Fourth Form) at Mysore, I moved to Kolar for the second year (Fifth Form). After initial hardships in matters of boarding and lodging, I was able to set up boarding arrangement at one Venkataramayya’s residence, which was made possible by Ramadasappa’s munificence.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Ramadasappa and Venkataramayya were friends. While they were not related to one another, they belonged to the same community (&lt;em&gt;Baḍaganāḍu&lt;/em&gt;) and adhered to a similar lifestyle and culture. Venkataramayya was employed as Head Clerk at the &lt;em&gt;Subdivision Office&lt;/em&gt;. He spent fifteen to twenty days a month on ‘circuits’ (field trips). It pained him to forsake the daily &lt;em&gt;pūjā&lt;/em&gt; at home during his official travel to other towns. He expressed this lament to Ramadasappa. This resulted in my boarding arrangement; when Venkataramayya was out of town, I was to perform the daily &lt;em&gt;pūjā&lt;/em&gt; at his home. I also had to tutor his three children every day. I was offered two daily meals at his house while I continued to pursue my education. My lodging was in a room at Vedamurti Manikundalam Subbarayasastri’s residence within the fort, which was nearby.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

He was appointed as the &lt;em&gt;Sheikhdar&lt;/em&gt; of the Baikur Hobli, Mulubagilu Taluk. It appears that in those days, the elders of my family didn’t know he hailed from my own community.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
