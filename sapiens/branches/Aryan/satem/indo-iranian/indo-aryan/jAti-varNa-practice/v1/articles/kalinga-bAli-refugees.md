The religion of Siwa was introduced in Bali between three and four hundred years ago, previous to which the reigning religion was Buddhism. The following is the account of this revolution furnished to me by the Brahmins themselves. A few years previous to the Mahommedan conversion of the Javanese, there arrived in Java, from Kalinga, a number of Brahmins, of the sect of Siwa who received protection from Browijoyo, the last Hindu sovereign of Mojopahit. 

Soon after the overthrow of that state, they fled to Bali under their leader Wahu Bahu, and there disseminated their doctrines. The present generation are, by their own account, the tenth in descent from Wahu Bahu and his companions.

> Brahmins from Odisha helped supplant Buddhist influence from Bali and replace it with Orthodox Shaivism during the same period Java was falling to Islam.
