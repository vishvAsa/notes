      <description>&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&#34;https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2004/05/17/the-great-bhaskararaya-makhindra/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;intro&#34;&gt;Intro&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The redoubtable bhAskararAya was one of the greatest shrauta sacrificers and exponents of the tantra of recent times. He would rank no less than great savants of the mantra shAstra throughout bhArata, through the ages, like amoghavajra and indrabodhi of Kanchipuram, vasugupta, lakshmaNa deshikendra and abhinavagupta of Kashmir, sha~nkara bhagavatpAda of the Chera country, dIpAMkarashriGYAna of Kalinga, mahIdhara dIkShita of Kashi and matsyendra of the icy Himalayas.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;early-life&#34;&gt;Early life&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;He was born in Hyderabad in ~1690 as the second son of gambhIraraya and koNamAmbAL of the kaushika gotra [several southerners claim that he belonged to the vaDamA branch of smArtas, while Maharashtrians claim that he was of the Deshasta branch of Maharatti Brahmins. The distinctions amongst the pa~ncha draviDa may have been less pronounced then].&lt;br&gt;&#xA;gambhIraraya was an expert of the purANas and epics and had studied the tantras from his uncle nArAyaNan paNditar of our lineage of the bhArgava gotra.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&#34;https://x.com/blog_supplement/status/1938807347595391240&#34;&gt;TW&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A friend somewhat childishly asked who I considered the greatest of the three matsyendra, abhinavagupta and bhAskararAya. I said we have to leave out Matsyendra because he is the beginning of the gurupa~nkti of the yuga and kulashAstra will not exist as we have it without him. However, of the other two, I chose bhAskararAya because I&amp;rsquo;m much closer to him in spirit &amp;ndash; he was one who penetrated both the mantrashAstra-s Agamika and naigamika and was bold in theorizing and seeing deep connections. Had he lived today, his works might have been even more dazzling.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
