      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;history-of-the-term-paṇḍita&#34;&gt;History of the term paṇḍita&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;etymology&#34;&gt;Etymology&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the Indian tradition of word derivation, paṇḍita has been derived from the feminine noun paṇḍā, The paraphrase of paṇḍā given by Bhattoji Dīkṣita (Uņādisūtra 1.111) is buddhi &amp;ldquo;waking up, realisation, intellect, intelligence&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The dictionaries compiled by traditional scholars in the second half of the nineteenth century, namely Sabdārthacintămani (p. IIA.25), Sabdakalpadruma (p. III.20) and Vācaspatya (p. V.4203), are more specific. They explain paṇḍā with tattva-visayinī buddhi &amp;lsquo;a mental state or cognition concerning reality, knowledge pertaining to truth”, tattvānugā buddhi &amp;ldquo;an intellectual state that follows (= seeks or is based on) reality”, nirṇāyatma-jñāna &amp;ldquo;a cognition in which a determination about the true nature of something) is made&amp;rdquo;, vedojjvalā buddhi &amp;ldquo;understanding illumined by the Veda”.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The paṇḍits from a piṇḍa-brahmāṇḍa Point of View&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;It is sad to see the number of great sastrīs, distinguished no less for their humility and modesty than for their learning and intelligence, diminish year after year, and to feel that with them there is dying away more and more of that traditional learning which we can so ill dispense with in the interpretation of the enigmatic works of Hindu antiquity, but it appears to me all the more to be the duty of both Native and European Sanskrit scholars to save as much as can still be saved, and to fix in writing what in less than half a century will otherwise be irreparably lost.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
