THROUGH THE EYES OF A DAUGHTER

the story of my parents by kamala parthasarathy

## How it all started
I was at my friend Nagu’s house in January, 2011.
GRP and I had gone there to condole the demise of her
father. She showed me a folder containing a family biogra-
phy that her brother had written. It contained details of her
parents, all the siblings and various family events. It was
poignant, amusing, and all the family members truly en-
joyed going through and getting reminded of various hap-
penings, both happy and otherwise. Seeing this gave me an
idea. I wanted to put in writing the profile of my parents
for my daughters, nieces, nephews, grandchildren, grand-
nieces and nephews, so they may get an idea about their
grand and great grandparents. The first person I thought of
contacting, to give me her account of her experiences with
my parents was my dear cousin, Rangamani. Prompt as
she is, she sent in her piece, a lovely write-up on my moth-
er. Her account was so touching, truthful and hilarious that
it moved me to tears. Now I know that whatever is writ-
ten should be an honest opinion with candid information
of the good and the not so. Thereafter I talked to several
other people to give me their accounts and following is my
best effort at writing about my father, warm, affectionate
and generous, and my mother, equally warm and generous
and also impulsive and fun loving. I hope my effort is worth
reading and gives the readers an idea of the kind of people
my parents were.

## My father
My father Krishnaswamy Ramanujam was born in
the year 1910 to Rukmini and K. R. Krishnaswamy, called
K.R.K. Iyengar by all. I do not know the date of his birth.
His astrological sign was Cancer, so he was probably a born
in June.

My father, Appa as I am going to refer to him, was
not very tall or handsome, and had a loud, gruff voice that
belied his gentle nature. He never cursed or swore and his
voice always expressed love and affection.

He was born in Sirkazhi, a small town in Tamil
Nadu. Appa had an elder brother Thiruvegadathan Iyengar,
and two sisters, Vijayam, the oldest child, and Pattammal,
the youngest. His father, K.R.krishnasway Iyengar was
a leading lawyer in that town. In those days, the lawyers
were the elite of the society. Appa completed his schooling
in the Sabhanayagr Mudaliar Hindu School in Sirkazhi and
received his Bachelor’s degree from Pachaiappa College in
Chennai, and later received a Diploma in Pharmaceuticals
in Bangalore. He worked first as a clerk and then a manager
at the Central Bank in Kumbakonam. He was transferred to
different branches throughout Kumbakonum and else-
where, and I was born when Appa was posted at Thiruvar-
ur, a town about 40 kilometers from Kumbakonum. I was
named Kamala after a deity in the temple.

We lived in a big house on Dabir Street in Kumba-
konam, and I have faint memories of that house. There was
a huge living room which opened into a dark kitchen on the
ground floor. The first floor had a similar long living room
with built-in cupboards on either side. There were two
staircases, one from the verandah in front and one from the
kitchen at the back. We slept on the first floor. The front
yard was large and square, paved with rough tiles.
Appa and Amma had four children. Srinivasa
Raghavan (Periyanna) was the oldest, born in April 1930.
Sampath Kumaran, the second, was born in January 1933.
I was born in April 1944, and my youngest brother Murali
in August 1948. Amma gave birth to two more children, one
between my two brothers and another between Sampath
and myself, both of whom died at birth. She also had a
miscarriage after Murali.

As Appa continued working at the bank, he began
to feel that his income was not enough to support his grow-
ing family. Amma’s older sister, Pattamal Vedantha Iyen-
gar, whom I called Periyamma, lived in Bangalore with her
husband. Periyappa, came from a very rich family. He was
an engineer who had a high post in hydroelectric projects in
Karnataka. He and his wife had three sons, Kannan, Sam-
path and Varadu. In 1949, Sampath and his two cousins,
Kuppuswamy and Rangaswamy, planned to buy a pharma-
cy, and in 1951, Kannan began a printing shop. Periyamma
invited Appa to join her sons in both business ventures, and
he accepted.

Around this time, Periyanna had just graduated
from college, and Periyappa got him a job at Kirloskar Elec-
tric Company in Bangalore. He was living with Periyamma’s
family. So the decision for the family to move to Bangalore
was easy.

Appa did not have the money to invest in these
businesses. Appa’s father had died young, and he be-
queathed his house in Sirkazhi to Appa. However, his older
brother, also my Periyappa on the paternal side, refused
to vacate the house and Appa had to file a lawsuit against
him in court at Sirkazhi. Amma’s older brother, Shri.
Raghavachari (my Mama) was a lawyer, and represented
Appa in his case. The amusing thing was that Appa and
Sri. Raghavachari would go to Sirkhazhi for the hearings,
during which time Periyappa would insist that they go to
his (disputed) home and have lunch, which they would
accept. After lunch, they would go to the court to fight the
case against each other. Despite their legal troubles, Appa
and his brother still remained close. Appa realized that his
brother would not vacate the house not because he wanted
to cheat Appa of his share but because he had a large family
2and had genuine money problems. Appa helped three of his
brother’s sons to come up in life. In the end, Appa won the
case and finally sold the house to pay for his share of invest-
ments in the two businesses. With a new job for Appa and
money to invest, our family moved to Bangalore in 1949.

Appa and his partners bought the Seshamahal
Pharmacy in Bangalore and later renamed it Kalyan Phar-
macy. It exists even today in the same busy City Market
area in Bangalore under the same name but different own-
ership. The printing shop was also named Kalyan Printers
and Appa became a partner in the printing business, along
with Kannan, Varadu and C. R. Sampath, my uncle, Shri
Raghavachari’s older son-in-law. C. R. Sampath was a gi-
ant of a man who was probably over six feet tall with broad
shoulders, a square face and bushy eye brows, yet a very
cultured, gentle and soft spoken person.

When we first moved to Bangalore, we stayed
with Periyamma in her sprawling house, though we soon
moved to a rented house in Chamrajpet. It belonged to a
rich landlady, Mrs. Deshmukh, who owned several houses
in the area. Our house was in the end of a small lane close
to the famous Shankar Mutt temple and monastery and it
was identical to the house next door. I remember its layout
quite well. There was a living room, which opened into a
bedroom on the right. Beyond it was a large hall, which had
another bedroom to its right. The hall opened into a dining
room. There was a tiny kitchen to its left. A small passage to
the right led to a bathroom and opened into the backyard.
The toilet was outside but close to the backyard door and
could be reached easily. It was covered with asbestos sheets
and had a wooden door and running water. The steps that
led to the backyard had a ramp to move Periyanna’s mo-
torbike into the yard. There was a big stone with a rough
top on which clothes would be washed. The cloth would be
rubbed gently on the stone and it would emerge clean. The
bathroom had an oven with a built in copper cauldron that
held hot water for bathing and was closed by a wooden
plank. The bathroom also contained a shower area paved
with rough stone that prevented people from slipping
and acted as a pumice stone for scrubbing rough heels.

The rent was eighty rupees per month, and I
remember going with Amma to Mrs. Deshmukh’s house
on the first day of every month to give her the rent. I
loved to go with her and steal glances into the landlady’s
beautiful house. Amma never missed the first day of the
month and was very proud when the landlady comment-
ed that among all her tenants, we were the only people
who were so regular with the rent payment.

our house in Chamarajpet.

Appa would go to the printing shop early in the
morning, and return around 8:30 a.m. After a second cup
of coffee he would have a bath and have lunch with whoever
was at home at the time. We had never heard of breakfast in
those days. All of us would sit at our designated places eat-
ing off sterling silver plates. After lunch Appa would leave
for the pharmacy for the rest of the day. He would walk
with his bicycle until the end of the lane, and Amma would
go with him. When he reached the circle, he would wave to
Amma, who would wave back and return home with a smile
on her face. I recall now that Amma would always welcome
Appa when he returned from work with such a lovely smile
on her face as if she had not seen him in a very long time.
They were devoted to each other throughout their marriage.
There were about seven houses in the lane and
everyone knew everyone else. I would walk in and out of
any of the houses at any time of day. I would eat whatever
they offered, sometimes even from their own plates! Amma
never worried about where I was at any time, since the
neighborhood was very safe and the neighbors were good
people.

Our next-door neighbor was Subbannachar, a
lawyer. He had five children, Malathi, Bharati, Raghanna,
Chinu and Guru, who were all very scared of their father,
only speaking in whispers when he was around. Whenever
he ate lunch, he would belch very loudly. It would sound
like a siren blowing, and Murali and I would be in splits
laughing.

Ganesh Chaturti was a very important function at
their house. A huge idol would be brought home and the
family would make a large mandap decked with flowers. A
puja and prayer ceremony (aarati) would be held in the eve-
ning. During the ten-day long festival, I would be at their
house during all my free time.

When the Subbannachar family bought their own
house and moved away, another family moved in. They
were a very cultured and sophisticated family, a husband
and wife with seven children. The oldest daughter, Ranga-
nayaki, was a doctor, and there were two more daughters,
Vishali and Kamala, as well as four sons, Swami, Mani, Do-
rai, and Balu. None of the children was married. Vishali was
very short and always wore high-heeled slippers. I was in
awe of them and when no one was looking would try them
on. Their mother was very sick and weak, and she died a
year after they moved in. Their cries after she died kept
me awake for a few nights. Swami could sketch very well
and Kamala was a talented painter. She painted a beauti-
ful scene in my autograph book and wrote “Sweet remem-
brances from your friends at Park-Face”, which was their
name for their house. Many years later, may be in the year
1965, when I was living in Park View at Sion, I met Vishali,
who had got married and had a daughter. They soon moved
to France.

Around 1952, we moved from Chamrajpet to our
own home at 89 Third Cross, Gavipuram Extension, Ban-
galore. All of the four partners at Kalyan Pharmacy lived on
the same street. Amma sold some land she inherited from
her father, and the money she received, coupled with some
of Appa’s savings, were used to buy this place.

### In our own home

Our home was fairly large, with a compound in the
front and a yard at the back. The front entrance had three
small steps with a ramp in the middle to move a motorbike
onto a small verandah. On either side of the verandah were
two bedrooms used by my older brothers. The verandah
opened into a big hall, which connected to a third bed-
room on the left. This hall opened into a large dining room,
partitioned into two rooms, one of which opened into a
kitchen. The dining room had a Perumal Medai to store the
mandap and the pictures of gods. There was a glass fronted
cupboard where the silver utensils used for daily prayers
(aaradhanam ) were kept. On the opposite side was a table
with an electric hot plate for making coffee. At the right end
of the dining room was a large, airy storeroom. It contained
shelves to store plates; grains, fruits and vegetables, as well
as cupboards with wire mesh doors that held milk and but-
termilk. The right side of the partition opened into another
small verandah, which connected to the bathroom. This
location, near the rear of the house, allowed the sweeper to
enter through the back door and clean the toilet every day.

The backyard had a well and an area with running
water, for the maid to wash utensils in. There was also
a washing stone for clothes. Before the yard was paved,
Amma had a vegetable patch, and grew beans, okra, and to-
matoes. After the paving, only the huge lime tree survived,
and it continued to produce many limes.Sundari Patti left us when her brother died. When
I came home to give birth to Jayalu after my mother’s
demise, the only woman in the house was my young sister-
in-law, Saroja Manni. Appa wanted someone more experi-
enced to care for me following child birth. so Sundari Patti
came and stayed with us for two months.
The front yard had many flowering plants, particu-
larly jasmine. There was an arch above the gate filled with
jasmine vines, and even now, the smell of jasmine brings 
back memories of my Bangalore days.

Our home had a mother-in-law’s quarters (we
called it an outhouse) that was separate from the main
house, which contained a living room, bedroom, and kitch-
en. The outhouse used to be rented out from time to time.
Later it was rebuilt and had one large room and a bathroom
with a western style toilet. On the right of the outhouse was
our granary. Amma’s father would send paddy, urad dal,
and moong dal every year from his fields and the paddy
would be stored there. It would be taken to the rice mill
to remove the husks. We always had semi-polished rice
(brown rice) during those days. I do not remember eating
white rice as a child.

### Sundari Patti and others


Appa always insisted on having a cook in the house,
so that Amma would not be burdened with the day-to-day
cooking. Therefore, we always had a cook, and two live-in
servants, a maid and a manservant. Our cook in the early
days was Sundari Patti. She was with us for decades, and
for the longest time, I thought that she was a close relative.
Widowed young, she was childless, and her only relatives
were a brother with many children and a sister. Her brother
and sister would visit her, staying at our home, and Appa
was very hospitable to them. Sundari Patti had a shaved
head, as widows did in those days, and she wore only a
white sari, with no blouse. Yet, she did not look obscene.
I remember her as a good looking woman with a rosy
complexion, straight backed and very fit. This was prob-
ably because she was physically active throughout the day,
cooking for the fairly large family, grinding batter for idli
and dosa, and drawing water from the well, as well. I have
quite a few fond memories of her However I remember
one of her rituals very clearly. Every two months, a barber
(pariyari) would come early in the morning to shave her
head. Afterwards, she would draw water from the well, pour
it over her head and body, and then have her regular bath.
She religiously followed the rules set for her by her fam-
ily and society. Given her good looks and youth when she
was widowed, she could have attempted a fresh start, but
society prevented her from committing that grave sin by
shaving off her hair!!!

Over time, we had other cooks, always widowed
and destitute women. Working as a cook was the only living
these women could eke out in those days. Two of our cooks
were Kannamma Mami and Padmasani Mami, wonderful
women who worked tirelessly from morning to night. Liv-
ing with us, they had no days off and nowhere to go if they
were given one.

I remember Kannamma Mami liked to use English
words in her conversations. Once, when my aunt’s family
arrived unannounced at midnight from their pilgrimage,
Mami woke up and cooked a full meal for them. She then
told my aunt (in tamil) “Next time please drop a kalana(one
paisa worth) card and I will have readymade (in English)
food for you all.” How we laughed! After the night’s work
she was up and about in the morning for another demand-
ing day.

Padmasani Mami would draw beautiful rangolis at
the entrance to our house. Once she had drawn a beautiful
serpent, but I did not like that design at the entrance. She
said that there was no harm, since Lord Vishnu slept on
Adisesha, the seven headed serpent.

All of them cooked well, but Sundari Patti’s cooking
was different. Her vegetables were always undercooked and
crunchy, while I liked mine cooked to a pulp. If I com-
plained, Appa would say “Learn to eat vegetables that way.
It is good for health”.

father’s house on Pachaiappa Mudali Street in Kumbakonum.

left and other family members are behind.

When we were inbetween cooks, Appa would help
amma with cooking and the kitchen chores. He would be
constantly by her side chatting in the most companionable
manner. But in the evenings he would be at work and hence
had another widowed lady Chellamma Patti for help. Chel-
lamma Patti was blind in one eye and wore anly the cream
coloured sary called the Narmadi. She had a widowed
daughter and two granddaughters. Chellamma Patti was
extremely punctual and showed up at our doorstep at four
every evening. She would chop vegetables, grind masala
and make batter for idli and dosa. She would fill water and
clean the kitchen which would be spotless when she left. I
do not know what she was paid. But Amma would give her
a good meal and a large glass of steaming coffee with lot
of sugar. I think coffee was one stimulant all these women
needed after the back breaking work they did day in and
day out.

### A person of varied interests
Appa had many interests. He was fond of reading.
He subscribed to the Illustrated Weekly (Kushwant Singh’s
famous magazine), Readers’ Digest, and bought all of the
condensed editions of novels published by the Digest. He
would regularly listen to the daily news broadcast on All
India Radio. He particularly liked newsreaders like Melville
D’mello, Roshan Menon (the only lady newsreader then),
and V. N. Charapani. He would also listen to the radio
newsreel programme once a week and the BBC broadcast
every morning, and did not like to be disturbed during
those times. Appa was also fond of music. After moving to
our new home in Bangalore, he had given up the printing
shop partnership, thereby freeing up his mornings, dur-
ing which time he would walk around the house whistling
his favourite tunes over and over again.

As a pharmacist, Appa kept several bottles of
medicines for immediate relief of minor ailments. There
were always two bottles; one with iodine and the other
with benzoin. The former was for cuts and burned the
skin when applied. The latter was used to soothe a sore
throat. Appa would use a thin stick (cut out of a broom-
stick!) with cotton on the end to paint the solution on our
throats. Very soothing it would be! He also kept a number
of injection syringes and needles of different sizes and
thickness. During home visits, if our family physician had
to administer an injection, Appa would select the syringe
and the needle (very thin ones for kids and also his wife!)
and sterilize them himself. As the doctor gave the injec-
6tion, he would stand over his shoulder and wince when the
needle went in. He would lovingly massage the part after
the prick and felt everybody’s pain, physical or otherwise.
Pity no one, not even any of his four children felt his.
Our family physician was Dr. Parthasarathy Iyen-
gar. He had his dispensary in Gandhi Bazaar. Whenever
summoned, he would walk all the way to our home after his
working hours carrying his medical kit. He was in his late
fifties and would wear a full suit complete with a tie and a
turban on his head. He would always sport a namam (vaish-
navite symbol with two white lines with a red line drawn on
the forehead). Whenever he was called to attend to some-
one at home, Appa would come home from the pharmacy.
After the doctor attended to the patient, Appa would insist
that he have coffee and some snacks at our house, since
he had to walk all the way back to his house. Dr. Iyengar’s
Tamil pronunciations were a source of amusement to
Amma. She would ask him to say ‘vazhappazham (banana).
He could never say that and would say ‘valappalam’.
I also remember Appa’s eco- friendly habits. When
the municipal water service was introduced, water had to
be filled up for use at home. There were built-in cement
tanks in the kitchen and the bathroom for water storage.
In the kitchen instead of filling the tub with the help of a
rubber tube, Appa used a long bamboo split in the middle
lengthwise. One end of it was tied to the tap and the other
end would be placed in the tub and water would flow down
the bamboo into the tub. In the bathroom, there was a rub-
ber tube. He would siphon the water from the hot water
cauldron and the tub into a bucket for bathing purposes.
Seeing him siphoning for the first time, I thought that Appa
was doing some magic trick!

### Ever-helpful Appa
Making morning coffee in the house was
Appa’s job. An early riser, he would filter the coffee
decoction and keep it ready and hot. The silver jug
with the decoction would be kept in a saucepan of
boiling water. Appa would then wait for the milk-
man, Raghavan to deliver the milk. Raghavan stayed
near our old house at Chamrajpet, He had a dairy
farm with several cows and buffaloes and contin-
ued to deliver milk to us even after we moved to
Gavipuram Extension. He would come all the way
to our house with a cow and its calf. He would show
the empty vessel to Appa and then start milking the
cow. Milk would be delivered warm and frothing
twice a day. Our milk consumption was huge for we
had coffee, some of us had a nightcap of milk and
all of us needed curd and buttermilk. The poor cow
not only provided us with milk but also made two
long trips to our home along with its calf. The milk
7
being of such good quality, Amma also separated the cream
and made butter and clarified butter (ghee) at home. Appa
would bring in the vessel, boil the milk and offer fresh,
delicious and aromatic coffee to each of us as each one of us
walked in.

We had a cat, which Amma got from her friend’s
place to take care of the mice and cockroaches at home. The
cat did a good job of it. Her favourite was Appa who gave
her fresh milk every morning. Her bowl was a large coconut
shell and Appa would fill her bowl thrice for her breakfast.
After her enormous meal she would waddle to the steps
to the backyard, lie down, start licking and cleaning her-
self and doze off. When any of us was sitting on any of the
couches, she would nonchalantly climb up and settle on our
laps for a snooze. She was with us for about three years and
one day went missing. Amma suspected that someone must
have stolen her, since she was a beautiful cat, white with
brown patches.

We had two servants who lived with us, a young
boy named Maya and a middle-aged woman named Meen-
akshi. Maya had been with Ambulu Ammanga’s family and
came to work for us when they moved to Salam. He was tall
and dark, rather dim on the uptake but a good worker. He
would arrange our beds in the night and roll them up in the
morning. He would help the maid with washing clothes.
Maya did other odd jobs around the house; he ran errands
for us and sewed buttons on blouses when Amma was
learning to sew. He folded Amma’s saries and always went
about his work in silence.

Meenakshi was also dark but had sharp features
and looked good. Her husband had abandoned her, as
she had no kids. She would sweep and swab the house
and wash vessels. In the evenings, Meenakshi and Maya
would carry water in buckets from the back yard where the
water was, all the way to the front yard to water the plants.
Both of them did this chore tirelessly everyday. Besides
coffee and snacks they were given substantial amounts of
food twice a day. Meenakshi slept in the granary room and
Maya somewhere in front. They were both happy with us
for Appa was a very generous person and took good care of
the servants.

### Generous to a fault
Appa’s generosity needs to be dealt with in de-
tail. Most times, I approved of his generosity whole-
heartedly, but at other times, I thought it was unwarranted,
impulsive, thoughtless and wasteful.
Appa’s elder brother had four sons and a daughter.
He needed help with his sons which Appa readily offered.
Raju (Krishnamacahari),the eldest was not too keen on
studies. So after his school finals, Appa invited him to Ban-
galore to live with us and also work full-time at the pharma-
cy. Appa also got him a bicycle, so he could go to work and
return home on his own. Raju was treated like a member of
the family and upon his marriage, he lived in our outhouse
with his wife, Bhooma for a long time. He then moved to
Chidambaram, a small town in Tamil Nadu famous for the
Nataraja temple and the Annamalai University. There,
Appa’ s cousin Dr. Sriraman, who was a reader in Physics,
got Raju a job in administration. Raju had five children,
two sons and three daughters; all of them are brilliant and
professionally qualified. Raju’s wife died and he lived with
one of his daughters in Chennai. When Jayalu and Ranga
got married, Raju arranged for their wedding mats from Sirkhazhi.

They are a specialty of that town with the names
of the bride and the groom and the date of the wedding
woven into them.

Raju’s younger brother Rangaraj wanted to study
law and asked Appa for help. Appa invited him as well to
live with us, go to law college in the mornings and work at
the pharmacy during the days to earn a living and pay his
school fees.. Rangaraj stayed with us until he finished his
studies and thereafter got a job in the Survey Of India, in
the capital city of New Delhi. He married Chandra, my el-
dest aunt (Athai) Vijayam’s daughter. He died young and
Chandra was given a job in the same organization on sym-
pathetic grounds. Brought up in a conservative place with
minimal education, she rose to the occasion, worked hard
and brought up her kids. I heard that she now lives in the
west with one of her children.

wedding.

My uncle’s youngest son Raman also stayed with us
for some years when he studied in Bangalore. By that time I
had been married and had moved away from Bangalore, so
I do not have many memories on him.

When Amma was in the Cancer Institute, in Chen-
nai, then Madras, Pattamma Athai’s eldest daughter Rajam
came to see her. Rajam and her husband Krishnaswamy are
very cultured people. They have brilliant sons and daugh-
ters. Rajam spoke to Amma about her parents’ difficult
days at Srirangam and that her father was unemployed.
Athai had five daughters and four sons. When Rajam came
to Amma ,three of Athai’s daughters , Rajam, Padma and
Maragatham were married. But the youngest daughters,
Malthi and Bhooma were still young and all the sons had
yet to finish school as well. Amma knew that her days were
numbered and that her husband would be shattered when
she went. She wanted to provide some emotional support
to him and at the same time help his sister. So she invited
Athai’s family to move to Bangalore. Athai was a wonderful
person, very patient and loving and she provided the much-
needed emotional support to Appa.

Periyanna had started working as soon as he
finished his graduation and helped the family financially
for many years. So when the pharmacy started doing well
Amma bought a house for him close by (Periyanna repaid
the money in installments to Amma). Periyanna of course
stayed with his parents and his house remained vacant.
Athai’s family moved in the house and lived there for
fourteen years. Athimber was given a full time job in the
pharmacy and Appa helped the family to whatever extent
he could. Come to think of it, Kalyan Pharmacy, just like my
father took in all those who needed help. All Athai’ s sons
did well. Seshadri took up a government job after gradu-
ation. Sampath passed out of MIT and after a stint with
8IFFCO, started his own business. Rangarajan got a job in
Kirlosker’s with Periyanna’s recommendation and retired
from the company only recently. The youngest Singan is do-
ing extremely well in Bangalore and is married to Kala, his
siter Padma’s daughter. Malathy and Bhooma are married.
All of them are lovely people and always speak very fondly
of my parents and express their affection to them.

Sajoja Manni’s brother Rangan came to Bangalore.
Rangan’s father (Manni’s father) was a leading advocate
in Kukmbakonam. Anna encouraged Rangan to follow his
father’s footsteps. So Rangan also studied law and worked
(where else?) in the pharmacy during the day. Appa treated
him like his own son. Rangan stayed with us for two years,
graduated from college and started his own practice in
Kumbakonam. He has excelled himself in this profession.
He and his wife, Ranganayaki are a very warm and hospi-
table couple. They are now settled in Srirangam , a temple
town near Thiruchrapalli in Tamil nadu. We meet them
when we go there or at Bangalore on important occasions.
I am extremely proud of my father for all this gen-
erosity in him but did not approve of his wasteful habits.
I especially remember an incident that exhibited Appa’s
wastefulness that involved my cousin Rangamani. She was
and still is a favourite person to our family and her father
Papa Mutha (my mother’s older brother’s son) was my
parents’ favourite too. Their family visited us often. During
one such visit, Amma mentioned that Rangamani was fond
of flowers. That did it! When Appa went to Gandhi Bazaar
for the usual daily fruit and vegetable purchase, he bought
back a bag full (yes, a whole bag full!) of flowers. I remem-
ber as he emptied the bag on the table out came heaps of
huge flowers, colorful and lovely. There were giant mari-
golds, sunflowers, asters, dahlias and more. Rangamani
was enchanted and wide eyed. My mother was so proud
of what her husband had done. She kept repeating to one
and all,” You must have seen the child’s face. It was radiant
with delight”. She had this habit of repeating. Not senility.
Remember? She died young. I was very angry. It certainly
was not jealousy. I was and am fond of Rangamani too.
The flowers were too heavy and numerous to wear in our
hair; even if they were to be displayed, their stems were too
short and we did not have any flower vases. They were also
leaving that evening. Being very sensitive people they took
all the flowers with them. I did not want to think what they
must have done with them. I thought Rangamani would
have been equally delighted with one, two or even three
flowers of that size. Why twenty? It must have cost at least
ten rupees, a good enough sum then.

It was again the same with weekly magazines. We
were all avid readers and bought many magazines at home.
They were weeklies, fortnightlies and monthly magazines.
9
There were at least seven of them. Appa would buy two sets
every week, one for his house and one for my Athai’s house.
I would wonder why he should have done that. They living
a stone’s throw away, there were many visits to and fro the
whole day and we could have managed with one set. But
it was a big no for my father. During those days I was in
Bangalore awaiting the birth of my children. I had no cour-
age to take him to task or talk to him plainly. I would sulk.
The poor man would think that I was missing my mother
and try to divert my attention. It would mean buying or do-
ing something for me spending more money! That was just
what I did not want him to do. Hopeless situation! Though
I grieved at the loss of my mother, I did not miss her. I had
the best mother in my father. Even today I can’t help think-
ing that if only he had been a little careful with his money
he would not have had the financial difficulties in his last
days. Thought about tomorrow and prudence with money
were simple missing in his DNA.

### Good days
Kalyan Pharmacy started doing well. The partners
worked very hard and were very ambitious. As the fam-
ily finances improved Appa was more relaxed. Murali and
I were in school. Periyanna was married to the still most
beautiful Saroja. Janaki and Ramu were born. Much later
after Amma’s demise they had one more daughter Jayal-
akshmi (chinchu) named after my mother. Sampath was
married to my Mama’s daughter Malathi (equally beauti-
ful!). Lakshmi was born soon after. Sampath working
for Hindustan Lever was transferred out of Bangalore to
Hubli. Thereafter, he was transferred to Chennai, Hyder-
abad, Mumbai and thenback to Chennai. Sampath never
returned to stay at Bangalore any more but came only on
special occasions. We visited him frequently and always
had a gala time during our holidays at his home. Sampath
and Mala had three more kids, three boys, Kichi, Srikanth
and Raghva. Srikanth and Raghva were born after Amma’s
demise.

Appa loved food! Around 7:30 am he would snack
and his snack was not normal breakfast food, but savoury
delights such as thengozhal, manangombu, murukku,
cheedai, and mixture. These dishes used to be made in large
quantities at our house. Appa would take a plateful and I
would follow suit! He would eat as he was listening to the
morning news and walk around whistling. After his bath,
we would lunch together. Appa would leave for work while
Murali and I would leave for school. In the evenings when
Murali and I returned home from school, there would be
some tiffin (small snack) like dosa, idli, uppma etc. Then
there would be dinner. Appa would return home around
8:30 and the entire family would dine together. We had
standard food, nourishing and not too heavy; there would
be sambar, rasam, and a vegetable. Papads were a must. 
Some times there would be fried preserves (Vathal).
Our meals always included fruit. Appa would buy
dozens of oranges, apples and bananas. He would
also buy tins of mixed dry fruits and biscuits, plain
and creamed. Amma would store them in glass
bottles in a wooden cupboard. My young life was one
of gourmet delights. Speaks volumes about the size I
was in. Took decades to reduce, but reduce I did!

Some evenings on holidays Appa, Amma
and I would go for a walk, up to the National High
school grounds where a street vendor would be
selling “Brain Tonic”. That was spiced crisp puffed
rice (kurmura), mixed with roasted groundnuts
and curry leaves. It was some thing to die for! I
remember how the vendor would greet Appa. He
would say “Banni Sar, Kanle illa. Double packet
thogolli”(Welcome sir. You have not been seen these
days. Buy double quantity.). Appa would smilingly
take what he packed and pay him cheerfully. On the
way back I would have eaten a good quantity and
Anna would pounce on the rest when we reached
home.

The Kalyan Pharmacy partners ordered
crates of apples from faraway Kulu for their fami-
lies every year, even though there was no dearth of
fresh fruit in Bangalore. The partners’ prosperity at
the time must have inspired this indulgence. Each
partner would get two crates of red, crunchy, juicy
apples each individually packed in paper. Our crates
would be kept of the platform in the storeroom.
Amma was very careful to see that not a single fruit
got decayed or spoilt. She would check them, rotate
them and some times cover them with a wet cloth.
She did not have to worry for long for we would help
her by finishing them in a short period of time!

The partners had a meeting every Sunday
in one of their homes. All the partners lived on the
same street, a few yards from one another. What
they discussed, I do not know. But I know that
they had a breakfast, which would be a monumen-
tal meal. There would be idlis or dosas with vada,
chutney and sambar. Some times it would be pongal
floating in ghee and bursting with cashew nuts. All
of them ate very well, with two or three helpings of
each dish. Their weekly meetings were a source of
amusement to all the four families because we did
not know if any work actually got done!

The month of October was the new account-
ing period in the Pharmacy. The entire staff and all
the partners and their families would have a gala
10dinner at the Woodlands Hotel on Sampige Road beyond
Cubbon Park. We would look forward to it and all of us
would be dressed to the hilt. Even Appa would dress up.
Normally, Appa wore only a dhothie and a white shirt or
jubba, but for the dinner night, he would were his dhothie
in the traditional style with a pangakachham and have an
angavastram on his shoulder. Not only that, we also forced
him to wear chappals, something that he did not always do!
Appa would look regal and impressive, all dressed up.!

The dinner would be a really grand affair, with
sambar, rasam, kootu and curry. In addition there would be
chips, fried papads, vadas, pongal and puliodarai, payasam
and more sweets. There would be jangri and chirotty, a
multi-layered puri and a specialty of Bangalore. Powdered
sugar would be sprinkled over it. The puri was so light that
with a slight tap it would crumble to small pieces. Sweet-
ened, warm milk would be poured over it and eaten. I
always had two of them. The staff would eat well and all will
go home sated, happy and sleepy.

Jayalu and Ranga pose at a studio in Bombay in 1967.

Diwali was always a special occasion also. So many
dishes would be made, each stored in big tins. Sweets and
diwali marundu will be special items and they would be ex-
changed among the patners’ families. For me, the highlight
would be the Diwali malars, special editions of the usual
magazines we bought. They were my delights during this
11 festival. For the next ten days I would be busy reading all of
them. Knowing how fond I was of these books, Appa would
order every malar that was published.

Every Sunday Appa would take Amma to a movie,
usually a Tamil movie. If the actors were my favourites, I
would also tag along. Appa had a regular carriage driver
(Jatkawalla), who would come in his horse-drawn carriage,
to pick us up at the appointed time. The driver would be
waiting to pick us up at the end of the movie and would
bring us back home. We did not own a car and Appa would
not take a bus, as this mode of transport was very conve-
nient. I don’t think they missed any good movie and they
saw the bad ones too. It was their weekly outing that they
did not want to miss at any cost.

Kalyan Pharmacy bagged a very profitable deal.
It became the sole wholesale distributor for a popular
milk food called Dumex. Revenue increased manifold. To
celebrate the occasion, all the partners went to Tirupati
with their families. How well I remember the trip! All the
married women wore nine-yard saries in the traditional
way. Amma made me wear a sary also. A private bus
had been hired. The trip was so enjoyable with jokes and
music galore. We stayed in the choultry belonging to the
devastanam(temple) on the previous evening and early
the next morning, we went to the temple for Suprabatham
(waking up of the Lord with prayers and music). We stood
in the sannidhi (sanctum sanctorum) for the whole session.
We were standing so close to the Lord. In those days the
temple was not as crowded as it is to day. Standing in the
sannidhi for nearly twenty-five minutes as we did that day
is unheard of now. These days we get a glimpse of the Lord
when we go through the line with the volunteers physically
pushing us away from Him. It must be a conditioned reflex
in my mind that whenever I hear the suprabatahm, that
fortunate day of the past flashes in my mind.

With the wholesale dealership a separate wholesale
shop was opened close to the Pharmacy at the Silver Jubilee
Park Road. It was called “The Kalyan Drughouse”. It was a
stone’s throw away from the main shop. Close by was the
famous restaurant, the Bombay Chandra Bhavan. Appa
was very fond of sweets specially Jangiri (Ranga must have
inherited his genes). Every afternoon Appa would have cof-
fee at Bombay Chandra Bhavan along with jangiri and some
other savory. We loved going to the shop at that hour for it
meant a treat. Murali especially loved it. Once Murali went
all by himself (without telling Appa) and had a veritable
feast. When the bill was presented to him, he nonchalantly
told the waiter to charge it on his father, a partner of Kalyan
Pharmacy. At once he was told, “Aagli sar, billannu navu
doddavaarkade kalusthave”(ok sir we will send the bill to
the respected elder). Murali was also asked if he wanted any thing else! 
That night however, Appa was livid. He told
Murali that he should not have gone into the restaurant
without money on hand. Murali was confused. He felt he
had not done anything wrong. He had charged his bill on
the most creditworthy, human credit card! But then he did
not realize that Appa had a moral compass and took his
directions only from it.

(Murali was originally named Muralidharan, but he did not
like his name, and so took matters into his own hands,
telling the teachers at the school that his name was
Murali Rajan. His name was changed in the school reg-
ister and thereafter he officially became Murali Rajan.
)

It was the same all over city market. When Amma
and I went for any purchase, and if Amma tried to bargain
she would be told. “Neevu thogundu hogi ammavare. Naavu
doddavarakade billannu thogothave” (Please take what you
want madam. We will take the money from our respected
elder). Surely when the bill was presented to him, Appa
would have paid the asking price without a second thought.
This was the kind of respect he commanded all over City
Market. Kalyan Pharmacy was an institution there.

With prosperity came progress. A second branch of
the pharmacy was opened in Madras(Chennai). Rangappa
Mama moved with Vimala Mami to Madras to take care of
the shop. In Bangalore, a dispensing section, was opened
in and Kalyan Pharmacy became a dispensing chemist’s
shop. Those days, not many family physicians had dispens-
ing sections in their practice, so Kalyan Pharmacy provided
a much-needed service. They would provide, pills, potions
(mixtures, they were called) and powders as per the doc-
tors’ prescriptions. Once I was standing near Appa when a
patient brought in a prescription. Accordingly Appa pre-
pared a powder using a mortar and pestle. He divided the
powder carefully according to indicated dosage and made
neat packets for every dose. Then Appa, the linguist, told
him in a mixture of English, Tamil and Kannada “after
food, solpa neerakki (adding a little water) kudichudu
(drink)”. I burst out laughing. That was the joke during din-
ner that night. Appa argued that the important thing was
that the patient should understand what is being told. Since
Appa had seen to it, his lack of fluency in Kannada did not
matter. Perhaps so. He conversed with people and all his
staff this way and was well understood.

Our dinnertime had its own fun moments. Appa
loved tender mango pickle (mavadu) He would have three
or four small mangoes each time. He would bite into the
raw mango in such a way that it gave a kind of clicking
sound. No matter how many times all of us tried, we could
never master that knack. Some days we would beg Appa
to give us our food in our hands. He would take a large
vessel; mix ghee (lots of it) and sambar. The vegetable will
be on the side. He would make us all (including Amma) sit
around him in a semi circle and give us a mouthful on our
palms. We would gobble the food. When this was done all
of us would consume double the quantity and if the cook
knew about it in advance the dinner preparation would be
on a larger scale

### Liked by one and all
Appa had a cousin Dr.Sourirajan. He was the
younger brother of Dr.Sriraman of Annamalai university.
He was doing postdoctoral research at the Tata Institute
Of Science, now the Indian Institute Of Science. He was
also doing some kind of project in The Raman Institute Of
Science run by Sir. C. V. Raman, the Nobel Laureate. Souri
Chithappa (as I called him) was very fond of my parents.
He would come home during weekends and spend a relax-
ing day with all of us. Amma would have special dishes
prepared for him. Since he was in the hostel, Amma felt he
should be given home- cooked, special meals whenever he
came over. Once, he invited us, (my parents and me) to the
Institute. After showing us around he took us to the Raman
Institute. As we entered, Sir C V Raman himself got out of
his car. He recognized Chithappa, who introduced Appa to
him. The distinguished gentleman himself took us inside
and showed us around. We went to his private lab where he
explained something and switched on some lights and the
small rocks kept on the shelf shone as if they were covered
with a velvet cloth. I remember Appa asking him a lot of
questions and he seemed very happy to answer them. After
the visit, Appa patted Chithappa on his back with so much
admiration in his eyes that Chithappa beamed with pride.
The only thing I remember about the visit was how Sir CV
Raman looked. He was dressed in full suit with a turban on
his head. However much I try, I cannot remember anything
more about the visit. Such a shame that I cannot recall what
Sir C V Raman himself told us about the Raman Effect, the
discovery that got him the Nobel Prize.!

children at his son’s house in Bombay.

All our relatives were fond of Appa. Souri Chithap-
pa got married to Kamala and moved to Canada. They have
a son, Krishnan. After Appa’s demise, when we were in
Sion, Chithappa got my address and wrote a letter to me
asking about Appa’s demise. He came over to our place with
his wife and son and had dinner. He spoke so fondly of my
parents.

His elder brother Dr.Sriraman (also my Periyappa)
was also very fond of Appa and he was a regular visitor at
our home. He had a daughter Maithili, who was about my
age. She had some major problem with her eyes. She could
not see well even after several operations. For every one of
those surgeries done in Bangalore, they would come and
stay with us. Appa gave Periyappa a lot of emotional sup-
port that was much needed during his daughter’s difficultt
days. Maithili died when she was in her thirties..

### Active, understanding and sensitive
Appa was always very active. I had never seen him
sitting idle or resting. Eve after Amma’s demise, whenever
we were between cooks, he would help Saroja Manni in the
kitchen.. That was his nature. Manni’s sisters speak very
often of those days when they visited their sister and they
would be amazed to see Saroja’s father-in-law giving her a
helping hand, something that was unheard of at the time.
Appa and Amma were very generous with the
needy. I remember a young boy Satya who came to our
home every evening with a vessel in hand. He would say
“Bhavati Biksham Dehi” meaning, “Please give me alms”’
That was the way poor Brahmins would ask for food. It was
an unwritten rule at home that he should be given food ev-
ery day. He would accept whatever others and we gave, in a
single vessel. It would be a mixture of all kind of food. Appa
was particular that what we offered him should be from
the freshly prepared dinner for the night. Satya was a hard
12working, brilliant boy. He lived in a small house on our lane.
His family was large and his father was unemployed and
ailing. Satya went to evening college and worked in some
office during the day. Later Appa engaged him to teach me
Sanskrit (for I needed some help with the subject initially).
He had warned me that I should never mention the days
when Satya came asking for food.+++(4)+++


An old man would come every Saturday begging
for money. I had named him ‘Saturday old man’. I would
always give him half an anna (the coin of those days). One
Saturday he told me, “ I cannot come next Saturday. So
give me that day’s quota to day only”. I was angry. What
cheek this fellow had to make such a demand! Appa had a
hearty laugh and told me to give that man the extra money.
He added that charity should not be done with anger. That
poor man did not want to miss out on his Saturday’s share
as it probably meant a lot to him.

I cannot forget the days when I was with Appa
when I had delivered my daughters. He was always close
by. During the nights, he would wake up at the slightest
disturbance caused by the sleeping kids. He would be up
to change their nappies. He would sterilize their feeding
bottles. Whenever he was around, Appa would prepare
their formula. In those days for about forty days after
childbirth, lactating mothers were given a herbal digestive
called leghiyam, a delicious preparation similar to halva.
It had to be eaten very early in the morning. Though we
had a cook to help in these matters. Appa would wake up
around four in the morning and bring me a tablespoon of
leghiyam warmed on a beetle leaf. He never missed a day.
I do not know if he used to go back to sleep after that, but
I would be fast asleep at once. Similarly at ten in the night
he would get me cup of warm Horlicks. I remember so well
that it would come in a long silver tumbler (We had about
a dozen of these tumblers and used them for all beverages).
He was again absolutely regular. I wonder, didn’t he ever
become tired, or sleepy or have a headache? Could he not
have delegated the job to his cook? The answer was NO. He
did not think that he could ever tire of
doing something for his child (no mat-
ter what the age of the child was). The
thought of that Horlicks now brings
back the sweet taste I had in my mouth
and the thought also fills my eyes with
tears.

### Another shameful memory
that I have is the day when I threw up
on the floor of our living room. When
I was pregnant, I had felt full and felt
uneasy in my stomach for about two
days. Thinking that at the stage I was
in, proper intake of food was a must,
I continued to eat. Late one evening,
I brought out all that food right in the
middle of our living room. Coming to
think of it now, I was not that sick that
I could not have rushed to the back-
yard or the toilet to vomit. The floor
was full of that stinking mess. Appa
at once went out and brought a lot of
sand and covered the mess with it. He
brought a broom and swept the mess
into a tin sheet. After he threw it out,
he cleaned the floor with an antisep-
tic. There was no disgust on his face.
He did not complain. He did not say
that I should have known better (now
I know for sure) than to vomit inside
the house on the floor. Well, more like
him are not made now. The Good Lord
must have thrown away the mould.
He must have realized that these men
were too good for practical life!

### Appa and our academics
Though Appa wanted us to do
well at school, he never participated
in our academic life. He never came to
my school or interacted with my teach-
ers. When I was in the 11th standard
(SSLC it was called) I was worried
about Algebra in which I was weak. I
confided in Appa that it was worrying
me. Within a week, Appa had arranged
private tuition for me in that subject.
Mr. Keshava Rao, a mathematics
teacher in Acharya Patashala was very
popular and competent. He trained
many students, all boys privately at
his own home. Appa requested him to
come to our house to teach me. The
14teacher could allot me an hour only early in the mornings
and agreed to come home at six every morning. The fee was
a princely sum of Rs.25. Appa would wake me up at 5:30
a.m. to get ready for my tuition. Mr. Keshava Rao will ar-
rive promptly at 6:00 a.m.. The class would be held in the
outhouse. Five minutes after his arrival Appa would appear
with a steaming cup of coffee for the teacher, which Mr Rao
would accept with a smile. The ritual never varied.
When the SSLC results were announced, Appa
happened to be at home. The result would be published
the previous evening in the newspaper and the mark sheet
would be available in the school the next day. Appa went on
his cycle to the Prajamatha and Janavani (the two popular
local news papers) office. The results were posted on the
notice board. He checked my number, found that I had
passed in the first class and came home beaming with plea-
sure. I was awarded a certificate and a silver cup for hav-
ing come first in Sanskrit in the exam. Neither my parents
thought of coming to the school for the award ceremony
nor did I think of inviting them. We were all happy and that
was about it.

When I was in the Mt.Carmel College, the bus
belonging to the college would pick me up and drop me
at the doorstep. But during the exams I had to use pub-
lic transportation. Appa would accompany me to Gandhi
Bazaar from where I would take bus no.2, to the canton-
ment area, which was a fairly long distance from our house.
One morning the bus did not arrive till 7:30 a.m. and I was
expected in college in half an hour’s time, so Appa took me
by an autorickshaw. He was surprised that my college was
so far away. That was the only time he ever visited the place
where I studied. He put us through school and college and
trusted that we would do our best and come out well.

### Trouble ahead
Everything was going well for our family until
around early 1960, Amma started complaining of
swallowing difficulties. The doctor did not think it was
serious. Around May, 1960. Appa and Amma went
to Kumbakonam for some puja. There are two routes
to get there and no direct train. One could go via
Trichi or Chennai. The former was shorter and hence
used often. My parents took the shorter route to get
to Kumbakonam and returned via Channai, so they
could spend time with Sampath, Mala and the kids.
Sampath had Amma’s throat x-rayed, after which my
parents returned to Bangalore. In two days Sampath
called and said that the doctor had some doubts about
the x-ray reports and wanted to check Amma again.
Both my parents went back. After some more extensive
tests Amma was diagnosed with cancer of the gullet.
She was admitted at once into the Cancer Institute at
15
Adayar, Chennai, under the care of two eminent oncolo-
gists, Dr.Sadashivan and Dr. Shantha, both pioneers n can-
cer research. Having gone to Chennai in the month of June,
Amma and Appa returned to Bangalore only in December,
1960.

While at Chennai, it was determined that Amma
was not strong enough to withstand surgery. As was the
norm at the time, Amma was started on radiation treat-
ment. The cancer was exposed to cobalt rays for about ten
minutes every day. It was an aggressive treatment. The area
of exposure became dark and soft. But it must have worked
since Amma could eat without pain. Appa never left her
side during the daytime. He would come every morning
with her food and attend to all her needs. He would give her
food, make fruit juice, get her coffee and try to cheer her up.
By then, it was known that her days were numbered. Since
Amma was in the female ward, Appa could not stay with
her during nights. Three wonderful women from Amma’s
family took turns to be with her during those six months.
They were Amma’s elder sister and my Periyamma, Pat-
tammal, her elder sister-in-law Padmasani Ammal and the
second sister-in-law Komalavalli Ammal. None of them
lived in Chennai. Periyamma lived in Bangalore and my
other two aunts lived in Kumbakonam. But taking turns
among themselves they never let her be alone even for a
single night.

### Accepting the inevitable
I think that during the period when Amma was in
the hospital; Appa and she must have had a lot of discus-
sions, reminiscing their life together, and planning for the
future minus Amma. I being the only daughter and being
of marriageable age in those days, Amma wanted me to
be married and settled before she went. When she was in
the hospital, I had visited Chennai once. Appa took me for
a walk one evening and told me what his wife wished and
why I should agree to that. I was shocked to hear about
Amma’s condition and agreed to her wish. Now when I
recall those days I think it was some kind of intuition that
made Appa make a firm decision about my studies. I had
wanted to be a doctor. I had secured very high marks in
my SSLC exam and could have easily got into the science
stream in my first year in college. But Appa would not allow
that. He said a medical course would mean my studying for
a minimum of seven years and he could not see it happen-
ing. He insisted that I study in the Arts stream instead. I
had to discontinue my studies midway to get married.
Much to her surprise Amma found that her class-
mate in her school was also in the institute with breast
cancer. That lady died recently of old age. With her help
and contacts Appa and Amma fixed my marriage. When
they returned to Chennai, I was asked to meet my future
husband, Parthasarathy, whom I married on 2nd February
1961.

Appa knew how much this marriage meant to
Amma and gave in to all her wishes. There was no com-
promise on expenses. . A grand wedding was planned and
celebrated. I wonder how Appa managed the expenses.
Amma’s treatment must have been expensive and this was
soon followed by my marriage. He bought everything that
I would possibly need to start and run a home. How well I
remember some incidents! I moved to Lucknow with my
husband. My parents came to Chennai to see to see us off.
Appa called me aside and gave me Rs.100/ for my imme-
diate needs till I feel comfortable to ask my husband for
money. In the Madras Central station, he went to the shop
and came back with two things, a thermos flask and two
dozens of clothesline clips! He just remembered that he had
not thought of them till then. I met my parents together for
the last time in the station. Within the next six months just
as the doctor had warned, Amma passed away.

Amma’s demise though expected, shattered Appa.
I remember the day of the funeral. The pyre was ready.
Appa, Murali and I were sitting aside. When Periyanna lit
the pyre, Appa could not bear to watch. He took my hands
in his, covered his face with them and cried; the only time I
had seen him cry.

Life went on and Appa had to move forward. His
duties were still pending. He was young, in his early fifties.
Murali had not settled down and was still in school. He
continued in the pharmacy and kept himself busy through
out the day. Meantime, the pharmacy also was also encoun-
tering problems. The Dumex dealership was withdrawn as
a company called Pfiizer bought the product.t. The phar-
macy’s revenue was drastically reduced. Nevertheless, the
other contracts and the dispensing section of the pharmacy
kept the business afloat. His sister living close by must have
been some kind of comfort to him.

Meantime I came to my father’s home for the
birth of my daughters. I was given the best medical help
and he did all that he could to keep me in cheer. He helped
me to care for my babies and also saw to it that my health
was fully restored after childbirth. He attended my chil-
dren’s first birthdays, laden with gifts for them.. When we
were in Malad, in Mumbai GRP developed a shooting pain
in his left shoulder and had palpitations. We thought it was
a heart attack and I called Appa around 9 in the night. He
told me not to worry and that he would come to Mumbai.
But I had certainly not expected that he would arrive at 12
the next day, which he did! He was with us till it was found
that GRP had no heart problems. That was the only time
when Appa stayed with me for about eight days. He came
twice when he accompanied me back home after the birth
of my newborn daughters, but never stayed for more than a
couple of days each time.

Around 1965 Appa withdrew his partnership from
the pharmacy. But there were some legal issues, which
went on for a decade. Anna moved into his own home after
Athai’s family vacated and Appa moved in with him, having
leased his house to an old lady who ran a catering business.
Around 1970 , Appa sold his house. Murali got married
Appa used the proceeds to rent a small house for Murali
and his young wife and furnish it with all the requirements
to start a family home. Murali married the young and
lovely Nikila, who was the daughter of Manni’s elder sister
Shakunthala. . Murali and Nikila had a son Srikanth (Kutty
payya) and one more son Ashwin after nearly ten years.
Kuttipayya died in a tragic accident leaving behind his
young wife, Aruna and two daughters Akshaya and Abhi-
16naya. Aruna works for Infosys and lives in Bangalore. She
is a lovely girl and keeps in touch with all of us.

### The last days
The legal issues in connection with Kalyan
Pharmacy continued for quite a few years and got fi-
nally resolved around 1974. About that time, Sampath
resigned from his job and started his own business. He
requested Appa to move to Chennai and help him with
his business.That must have been the best news for Appa
after many years. He immediately moved to Sampath’s
home and helped with his business. This must have been
a second lease of professional life for Appa. He was both
usefully and gainfully employed. Sampath was living in a
large two-storied house in Chennai. He lived with Mala
and kids on the first floor. The ground floor had his office
and storage. Appa had his own lovely room complete with
a sit out and attached bath. This must have been the best
arrangement for Appa, both interdependent and indepen-
dent. After a year or two, around early 1976, Appa devel-
oped some kind of skin infection, which did not respond
to treatment. He must have sensed that is end was near.
He visited his family temple at Anna Parumal Koil and
met with his only living sibling his elder brother.

During this time, GRP was in Chennai. He went
to meet Appa and spent some time with him. Appa would
always carry a photo of Annan Paerumal wherever he
went. It always hung in his room where he could see it
when he got up in the morning. He removed that picture
and gave tit to GRP to be handed over to me. This was his
last blessing and final good-bye to me. . ..

Around mid April 1976, Appa went to Bangalore
to Periynna’s place He had wanted to die only his eldest
son’s house. On 1st May 1976, he had his first and mas-
sive heart attack at 7:30 in the morning. He was rushed
in vain to the hospital. Appa was sixty-six years old at the
time.

The telegram informing Appa’s demise arrived in
Mumbai around nine in the morning on the same day. I
was to go to Bangalore later that month with Jayalu and
Ranga. I was looking forward to that trip. In my previ-
ous trip, to Bangalore, Appa told me that I was grossly
overweight and if I did not reduce, I may have health
issues. I decided to do something about it and devised a
physical regimen, (which I keep to this day) and reduced
my weight. I was looking rather trim (in my opinion) and
wanted Appa to see me. But it was not to be. Ranga and
I rushed to Bangalore by air within a few hours and GRP
and Jayalu followed in two days. When Appa was taken to
the cemetery, Anna, Sampath and Murali were to go in the
hearse with Appa. I insisted on going and young Janaki who
17
was most attached to her grandfather said that she would
certainly go with her Thatha to bid him good-bye. The five
of us went with Appa and the final rites were performed by
Periyanna. 

### Grandchildren memories
As I was writing the biography, I was mailing the
chapters to Jaylu, Ranga, Rangamani, Janaki and Chinchu.
Janaki felt that the biography will not be complete without
writing about the interaction that Appa had with his grand
children. So I requested all of them to give me their memo-
ries.

Jankai had spent more time with Appa than any
of the other grandchildren. She had a lot to tell. She spoke
about how sympathetic Appa was to animals. Though he
would travel by the horse drawn jutkas in Bangalore, he
was very strict that the horse should not be whipped to go
faster. I remember the way he fed our cat in my younger
days. Janaki said that Appa got her join a local library and
cultivated her reading habit. When she kept asking her for
word meanings, he got her an Oxford dictionary and taught
her to find the meaning of words.

This reminds me of Appa’s books. He was very fond
of reading and had a good collection. After his demise when
I went through his books I was quite impressed. There were
books by Pearl S Buck, A. J. Cronin, P. G. Wodehouse and
many others. He had a medical encyclopedia, a book on
the miracle of vitamins. There was one on the essence of
Baghvat Geeta . I also remember a book by Napolean Hill
on how to get rich with positive thinking (the recent wave
all over).

Ramu had this to say. Appa would feed him every
day when he came home from school for lunch. Once Appa
gave him curd rice which tasted awful. Ramu refused to eat
it and was shouted at by Appa. Still Ramu refused and Appa
tasted it to find out what was wrong with it. He had mixed
rice with dosa batter instead of curds! When Appa realized
his mistake he was full of apology and gave Rs 5/ to Ramu
as compensation. Janaki said that she and her friends
pounced on Ramu and made him buy eats for them with
that money. Ramu secretly hoped for a repetition!

As a child Chinna Jayalu (Chinchu) had been
pampered by Appa. She has very fond memories (though
not much for he died when she was around nine years) of
her days with her thatha. She responded to my request and
went down memory lane.

She remembered how she would come home from
school and demand what she wanted him to provide for
her school lunch box the next day(she would have surveyed
what her friends had brought) and surely he would pack
that for her. He would plait her hair for school. Nights she
would sleep with him and he would ask her to expand the
names of all the public sector units of Bangalore like the
BHEL, HAL etc.

She remembered some of the dishes he would
prepare, yummi keerai and awesome pongal (in her words).
She fondly recalled how he pampered her father peeling
oranges for him and how affectionately he treated manni’s
brother Rangan who studied Law and stayed in our home.
She said that she could still visualize her thatha walking
around the house with a mundas (bandana) on his head
and whistling his favoutite tunes.

She remembers with amusement how he would
shout at Murali and Ramu if they teased the other kids at
home.

Loving memories and simple tales, touching and
sweet. Made me nostalgic. I remember my own lunch box
during my college days. Appa would make upma, pack it
neatly in a banana leaf and it would fit snugly into my rect-
angular box , the size of my notebooks. The upma would
glisten with the generously smeared ghee and taste divine.
I had also asked Lakshmi, Kichi and Sreekanth.

They did not live with Appa in Bangalore , but would visit
on holidays and occasions. Two years before his demise
Appa went to live with them in Chennai when he helped
Sampath in his business. Lakshmi recalled how thatha
would lovingly plait her hair and adorn it with jasmin
flowers. Sreekanth wrote to me a lovely mail, which I have
reproduced verbatim on page 14.

Saroja (Perianna’s wife), Perianna, and I pose at Perianna’s house in
Bangalore. The house was named “Jayalakshmi” after Amma.

Apoorva was also reading the chapters as I was
writing. She called once and told me to write the Sasemira
story which Appa would tell me and which I had told
Apoorva and Kavya. She said that this was her contribution
to her Kolluthatha’s biography. I was touched.
This was the only story that Appa knew. He would tell me
the story sometimes before I went to sleep.

A man was walking near a forest when a tiger
started chasing him. He ran for his life and started climb-
ing a tree. Atop the tree he spotted a bear and was petrified.
The bear told the man not to worry. It said that he could
stay on the tree and the bear would not harm him. Both
of them sat for a long time and the tiger continued to wait
below. Then both the man and the bear were sleepy. So
the bear told the man to sleep and offered to keep watch.
The man slept. Then the tiger told the bear that both being
wild animals the bear should know that the man was their
enemy and asked the bear to push the sleeping man down.
The bear refused saying that it has promised protection to
him. Later the man woke up and the bear went to sleep.
The tiger told the man that he was foolish to believe that
the bear would protect him. It had not harmed the man
because it was not hungry just then. After the tiger left, the
bear would certainly eat up the man. Saying this the tiger
told the man to push the bear down so it could eat him. The
man believed this and without second thoughts, pushed the
bear down. The bear caught a branch and saved itself from
falling down. The bear then told the man that he was most
ungrateful and cursed that he would become mad and go
around saying “sasemira, sasemira” for the rest of his life.
I never tired of listening to this story when I was young.
Thanks to Apoorva, I remembered to add this to the biog-
raphy.

Ranga remembers the sandwiches that Appa
19
packed for all the kids to take to school - soft white bread
sandwiches with the crusts meticulously removed, and
smeared with ghee and sugar. Does not get any better!!
She also remembers how she and Chinchu would play
together and whenever they wanted a prop for their games,
Thatha was ever ready to help out.

After this I was about to complete the biography.
But then I was pleasantly surprised by a phone call from
Radha, Rangamani’s elder sister. She asked me why I had
not asked her about her memories of her time with Appa.
She told me some about some events that really adds colour
to the biography.

Bhavani is the eldest of the three sisters. When
Papa Mutha’s family was in Bangalore, Bhavani was study-
ing in Mt.Carmel College. She would take the public trans-
port to the college and back. One evening on her return,
she boarded a different bus my mistake and did not really
know the route that the bus took. She sat confused and at
the verge of tears. When the bus reached its final destina-
tion, she realized that it was the City market area. She saw
the name board of Kalyan Pharmacy and at once felt safe.
She entered the shop.with a tear stained face. Appa was
full of concern and found out why she was there and com-
forted her with Cadbury’s chocolates. Since he could not
leave the shop during the day, he had her escorted home.
This incident reminds me of what Jayalu said about her
Thatha, that one felt safe in his company.

Radha also remembered this when she had gone to
Chennai with her husband Madhavan and stayed in Sam-
path’s home. Appa was with Sampath helping him in his
business. There was a cinema theater close by. Radha had
planned to go for the evening show to watch the popular
movie Maman Magal (uncle’s daughter). Unfortunately her
spectacles broke and she was so disappointed. Appa would
not let her down. He offered his own glasses and said that
they were merely reading glasses and she could manage to
see the movie with them. Radha said that she did watch the
movie though she had to keep moving them up and down
her eyes to focus. But she managed and was so thankful to
Appa for his thoughtfulness.

I had failed to ask Radha for her input. Still when
she heard about the biography she felt that she should
share her memories with all of us. That is what Appa was,
compassionate, sensitive and with hands that reached to
help out so spontaneously. Hearing her relate this most
certainly made me proud of Appa.

There is so much more that I can keep writing
about my Appa. I need to stop somewhere. All of us siblings
were fortunate in having had such an exceptional father. To
me he was both a father and a mother and mothered me as
much as a mother would have.

Somehow it has so happened that I finished this
account on Father’s Day.


### Rangamani's account
Author’s note: Besides the grandchildren, there is one more
person who had good rapport with Appa. That is dear Ran-
gamani. Her parents lived close to Anna’s house, where Appa
lived and Appa would visit them often. He was very fond of
Rangamani’s parents and they reciprocated Appa’s affection.
When I started the biography, I asked Rangamani to write her
thoughts about Appa, which she readily did. Her piece follows.

My first memory of Athimber is at my grandmother’s
place in Kumbakonam. A huge plate full of kalkandu was kept
out of my reach in the dark storeroom. I had been eyeing it for
a good while and wondering how to get at it. Suddenly Athim-
ber went into the storeroom and got me a big fistful of kalkandu
and told me to go somewhere quiet and eat it up! I could not
believe my luck and obeyed him without a murmur. No wonder
he became a favorite with me all my life!

My father had a similar tale to tell about Athimber’s kind-
heartedness. When he was young, my father was very fond of
mangoes but did not like the messiness of eating it whole. Once
when the house was flooded with a rich mango harvest, Athim-
ber called my father aside and taught him to suck out the juice
from a small opening and then eat the mango pulp. My father
was overjoyed and remained a loyal fan of Athimeber.

He was a very kind person and very observant too
and unfailingly reached out to persons in need. He was gener-
ous with money, time and affection. Though a part of him died
with his loving wife, he remained the same caring person. There
was a tinge of sadness in him due to the loss. He was often at
loose ends not knowing what to do with his time. He visited us
frequently and spent long hours at home, all of us having whale
of a time. We could discuss anything with him and he would
patiently explain things and encourage more questions.
While he was popular with us, he could not handle his son Murali.
He was totally lost and could not relate to him well. He indulged
him with every comic that was issued and got him everything he
fancied but could not form a bond with him. Looking back, I wish
some of the women folk from the family had pitched in to help.
Perhaps Murali could have benefited by the gentle woman’s
touch, I do not know. But for his times. Athimber was far ahead
and enriched the life of every one around him. His memories still
remain dear to us, decades after he passed away.

Author’s note: It was indeed a fault in my Appa that he could
never be assertive nor could he demand certain things to be
done or not done even when these actions caused him a lot of
pain. When Murali was in his final years at school, Appa could
not make much time for him, as he was really busy with his
work in the pharmacy. But later when Murali started working
in Kirloskars, and he got married, Appa did bond with him.
He loved Murali’s son Srikanth. He went to their house every
day to spend time with the child and also saw to it that Nikila
was comfortable.

### sreekanth's account
Author’s note: Sreekanth shared
some of his memories of Appa with
me via email.

My dear Athai,
You are absolutely correct
in stating that we might not have
had much time with Thatha to
form too many memories, but I do
have a couple:

As you might remember,
Appa had a business as a distribu-
tor for various products and ran
this business out of the lower floor
of the house. The rooms were piled
with boxes in several stacks. On
occasion, Thatha would allow me
to play hide-and-seek with him
and it was tremendous fun.

I don’t know if you remember the
house, but there was a porch right
outside Thatha’s room where he
would sit and relax after the office
was closed for the night. There was
a railing (about 12 or so feet long)
and I kept trying to walk on that
railing. Thatha used to walk right
next to me to keep me from falling
and would clap and celebrate
every time I walked from one end
to the other. He would encourage
me to keep trying and would chal-
lenge me to do it three times in a
row, etc.

On rare occasions, he
would allow me to help him in the
office by having me count the
number of boxes of specific prod-
ucts. He usually would not allow
me in the office during business
hours, so the times he allowed me
to either play or help in the office
were rare treats.

While these are my fond
memories of Thatha, the over-rid-
ing memory I have associated with
him is about the day he passed
away. That day was the first time I
saw Appa cry and I still remember
Appa being inconsolable in his
grief. I remember being in tears
myself, but my memory of that
moment is being upset myself be-
cause my Appa was crying. I don’t
know why I was not more upset
that Thatha had passed away, but
I believe this was the first time I had
experienced someone passing
away.

Since Prashanth and
Madhav were both around seeing
Appa in his final months as he de-
teriorated, I honestly believe they
were much better-informed and
prepared to deal with his death
when it happened.

I thought back to my
reactions when Thatha passed
away and compared it to how my
sons dealt with my father passing
away. What a difference!!! My
tears were because my father was
crying, not because my Thatha
had passed away. Prashanth and
Madhav cried for their Thatha in a
way I never did. Whether this was
because they had so much more
time with him, I cannot say for sure.
Athai, I thank you so very much
for allowing me to relive these
small memories. In the years since
Appa’s death, I have faithfully
executed the shrardam rites each
year and have recited the names
of our ancestors. The next time I
perform these rites, I know I will
think about Thatha and these
memories when I utter his name.

I remember seeing Paati’s photo
in our Perumal room and asking
who that was and why her photo
was amongst the pictures and
vigrahams of “ommachis”. Appa’s
explanation was something to the
effect that “she was a guardian
angel".

I distinctly remember
Appa putting Thatha’s photo next
to hers in our Perumal room and
all of us praying together. I look
back now and wish I did have
more time with Thatha to get to
know him better. Unfortunately,
I never even got to meet Paati
because she passed away before
I was born. I will wait for your ac-
count of their lives when you have
compiled it to help me understand
them better.

Much love, Sreekanth

### Jailu's account
Author’s note: Jayalu and Ranga spent a year in
Bangalore . They studied in my alma mater, Mahila
Seva Samaja. Jayalu wrote about what she and Ranga
remembered about their Thatha. Jayalu wrote:
All my memories about Thatha are non verbal
rather than actual verbal inputs. While I always felt protect-
ed and safe when I was in his company, it was more due
his solid presence rather than anything he ‘said’.
I mainly remember his eyes which to my child-
hood impression were always very ‘sad’ looking. May be in
retrospect as an adult, it was probably ‘compassionate’,
rather than sad. The other impression is his posture of stand-
ing with ‘his hands folded’ and the crisp white really white
kurta he wore when he went out.

When Ranga and I lived in Bangalore for a year,
everybody made us welcome but poor Janaki must have
been most put out. We went to school with Janaki and her
friends, sat with them through lunch and just in case they
forgot us also watched them practice ‘ball badminton’ in
the evenings (I think they were a champion team). On the
rare occasion, we walked to school by ourselves; we would
take a ‘detour’ and play on a slide enroute. On one such
occasion, I spotted Thatha following us at a distance in a
cycle. Obviously, he was making sure, we were safe and
got to school on time. It was what Thatha did that made
me feel really safe.

Author’s note: Yes, Appa did make children feel very
protected and cherished. This year we were in London on
Appa’s death anniversary. Jayalu took us to the Krishna
temple near her home. She had also arranged for a Raj-
bog Aarati in the temple in the names of both Appa and
Amma. I had tears seeing their names on the board. The
biography has brought the grandchildren close to the
grandparent.

Reading about Appa’s eyes, I too remember an incident.
When we were in Sion, a bullock cart carrying blocks of
ice would be brought in the evenings. Stopping the cart
near our home the cart driver would cut our huge slabs
and deliver them to the nearby hotels and juice venders.
Once I was passing by and happened to look at the eyes of
the ox. Something prompted me to come home, and take
out a photo of Appa and look at his eyes. They appeared
so very similar. It was perhaps the same sorrow of the
pain of the burden expressed in those eyes. After that day I
avoided looking in to the eyes of that animal.

### kAvya editing
18When Kavya so meticulously edited and
formatted the biography and suggested that I add
more pictures of my parents in their early days, I
dipped into my archive of old photos. But much
to my disappointment I could not find too many
pictures. Photography as a hobby required (per-
haps still does) time, inclination and money. For
obvious reasons Appa never owned a camera. The
few photos I have had been clicked by Sampath
with his (now ancient) Kodak box camera. They
may not be very clear, but will have to do for this
record.

That was the reason why I was so thrilled
when Radha so thoughtfully sent me a photo of
ancestors (page 23) which showed along with my
great grandparents and uncles, Amma’s parents,
Bangla Thatha and Alamelu Patti. I remembered
Bangla Thatha, with whom I had spent time in Kum-
bakonam during my vacations. Alamelu Patti died
within a month of Amma’s birth. I could see that
Amma resembled her mother. Seeing this precious
photo brought a lump in my throat. We had photo-
graphs of Appa’s parents at our Gavipuram home
also, but those were lost in transit when we moved
out of that house.

## AMMA
part two
21My time with Amma was not long, but that short time
had a strong impact on my life. When I was in my first year of
college, she contracted esophageal cancer and was admitted
into the Cancer Institute in Madras (Chennai). Six months
later, she returned home from the hospital, in remission, and
decided that I should be married. After my marriage, I left
for Lucknow with my husband and that was the last time I
saw her alive. When I recall my mother’s short life, I see that
she had many blessings. Besides her husband who doted on
her, she had caring siblings and children. Though she died
young, I still have many memories of my mother, and I have
gathered information about her younger days from people
like Ambulu Ammanga (Amma’s neice) and Saundara Mami
( Amma’s cousin’s wife). My close friend Nagu gave me the
idea of writing my mother’s biography, and my family has
encouraged me to write this.

### Early days
Though I do not know when exactly my mother was
born, I do know that that Appa was born in the year 1910
and that there was a six-year difference between my parents,
making Amma’s birthday sometime in 1916.

Amma was born in Kuthalam, near Kukbakonam, in
Tamil Nadu. Her father was Shri V Krishnaswamy Iyengar
(Bungala Thatha) and her mother was Smt. Alemelu. Am-
ma’s maternal grandparents were the elite of Kuthalam and
they were referred to as Kuthalathu Iyengar and Kuthalat-
hamma, though I have not been able to find their real names.
Alamelu was V. Krishnaswamy Iyengar’s second wife, whom
he married after his first wife, Lakshmi died young. Before
her death, Lakshmi and V. Krishnaswamy Iyengar had one
son, Shri Raghavacahari. Alamelu had three children, Pat-
tammal (Periyamma), Raghunathan (Thambi Mama) and
my mother, Jayalakshmi, all of whom were born at Alemalu’s
mother’s home in Kuthalam. She died within a month or so
after my mother’s birth. Not only devoid of a mother’s care,
the unfortunate baby contracted small pox, a dreaded
disease at the time. The disease covered the baby’s small
body with deep blisters, including one on her right eye
that left a white dot in the middle of her eye. The blis-
ters were extremely painful for the baby, making it dif-
ficult to lift or move her. For days on end she was placed
on tender banana leaves smeared with castor oil to ease
the pain. I dread to think how miserable it must have
been for the newborn. Yet Amma survived and came to
her father’s (Bangala Thatha’s) home at 57 Pachaiyappa
Mudali Street in Kumbakonam. Once home, she was
pampered by every member of the family.

Bangala Thatha had four siblings. He and one of
his brothers, Shri Ramaswamy Iyengar (Chithi Thatha),
Sunset over Sarangapani Koil in Kumbakonum, Tamil Nadu, Amma’s hometown.
were leading lawyers in Kumbakonum and lived to-
gether on Pachaiyappa Mudali Street, though they moved to
a farmhouse with Bangala Thatha’s son and daughter-in-law
(Thambi Mama and Mami) on Vetti Pilliar Koil Street after
retirement. They also owned a village, Seethakamangalam,
fourteen miles away from Kumbakonam. Chithi Thatha’s
wife died young and he brought up his brother’s children as
his own, though Amma was his favourite. Jayyu was her pet
name, but my father always called her Jayam.

Thatha’s home in Pachaiyappa Mudali Street was a
veritable palace, and I remember the facade very well. There
were broad steps to enter the house, and at the top of the
steps, there was a two-level verandah (thinnai) on either side.
Three clerks would be seated on the floor (of the verandah?)
in front of their desks, busy preparing the paperwork for the
various cases that the lawyers were handling. The steps led to
a passage that opened in to a huge hall, and on the left was an
open quadrangle with a swing. This square was surrounded
by glass-fronted cupboards with thousands of law books and
old records of legal cases, most of which were never opened.
However, living in this setting stimulated a deep interest in
learning for Amma. My sister-in-law, Mala had heard from
her mother that as a small girl of three or four years Amma
would constantly be running around her home with a heavy
book in her hand, which she would not part with at any time.
She would tell her sister-in-law that books were Saraswathi
and that she was going to name her daughter Saraswathi.
I was not named Saraswathi, but Amma was very keen not
only on my education, but also her own later on in life.

To the right of the hall was a huge bedroom used for
childbirth, with windows opening into the thinnai. Amma,
her older sister, (Periyamma), and my cousin Ambulu Am-
manga gave birth in this room, and I think even Mala deliv-
ered her first-born, Lakshmi here. The women never went
to hospitals, as the midwives and older women in the family
were quite capable of handling childbirth.

Beside this room was another room, which contained sev-
eral steel cupboards with all the silver and gold of the house.
Amma would occasionally come to her father’s home to re-
move or return items and I always accompanied her. The
gold and silver that the cupboards contained always fasci-
nated me.

Beyond the hall was a storeroom and a huge dining
room with a red cement floor, that could house a hundred
people. At the very end of the hall, there was an altar (pe-
rumal medai) and a storeroom on the right. To the left of
the dining room was an open verandah with a well, and the
kitchen was at the end. Then came another broad verandah,
which had a large bathroom on its left. It contained a built-
in copper cauldron for heating water and stone benches on
two sides for keeping baskets of fresh and soiled clothes. A
shelf carried soapboxes, a small can of oil, and twin contain-
ers with turmeric powder and fresh turmeric. The bathing
area was one step down and was open to the sky, floored
with hard stone useful for scrubbing heels (who needs pum-
ice stone?!). A huge brass vessel (gangalam) held water for
bathing. The gangalam, with its brass handles on each side,
would now make a great museum piece. The broad passage
22also had a stone bench for coconuts, which were torn open
with an iron rod fixed to a wooden plank by farm hands. Be-
yond the passage was another well and a granary.On the left
was a door that opened into another long courtyard that led
to the stables and a garden.

The large first floor was divided in two by an open
verandah. The front was used for official work and it con-
tained tables, chairs, and bookshelves. The portion at the
back was where people slept, and it had a small attached bal-
cony. The verandah had steps leading to the open terraced
second floor.

This house was where we spent our holidays and
festivals like Diwali. Besides this house, Thatha had an-
other bungalow outside the city, a farmhouse with mango
orchards, coconut palms, and bamboo patches, as well as a
pond.

Amma was a pampered child, and her word was
law to Chithi Thatha, father, siblings, and her sisters in law.
Her sister-in-law (Madani), Padmasani Ammal related to
me a story about Amma. One day Madani returned to her
husband’s house from her parents’ and was feeding Amma,
who was about three or four. Just then her husband, Amma’s
older brother arrived and asked her when she had arrived,
to which Madani replied that she had just returned. At once
Amma jumped from her hip and ran to her father, shouting,
“Anna, (so she called her father), your son asked his wife a
question and she answered at once. She had no respect for
her sister-in-law (Naathanar), who is right there.” Amma
would laugh heartily when this story was told.

### Marriage and children
During this time, it was imperative that girls must
be married before they reached their teens, or they would
be considered old maids. Appa was an eligible boy from a
good family and after the horoscopes were matched, women
from Appa’s family came to Thatha’s home to meet Amma.
As Appa had no mother, his cousins Thillakka, Ponnakka,
and sister Vijayam came from Sirkazhi, a town two hours
from Kumbakonum, to meet Amma. They liked her and after
ensuring she was literate by having her read from a book,
Amma and Appa married in 1928, when she was only twelve
years old. I do not know if the two of them met before the
wedding, and I wish I had asked Amma about this.
While Amma was petite and frail, Appa was strap
ping and dark, with a loud, gruff voice. This worried Thatha,
as he wondered if the boy would be loving and tender to-
wards his beloved Jayyu. Yet, Appa was the most considerate
of husbands, always concerned about his Jayam’s well being,
as illustrated by this incident soon after their marriage.
It was (and still is) a practice that Vaishnavites should have on their persons the symbol of Lord Vishnu, the
conch (shangu) on the left hand and Chakkaram (Sudarsha-
na wheel) on the right. These symbols would be impressed
on the respective shoulders of men and women by pressing
a red-hot seal, in a process called the Samarshanam. As was
the practice, Amma had a bath and came in her wet clothes
and sat before the Aacharya. Throughout the procedure,
Appa stood right behind, holding her shoulders gently. Af-
terwards, he attended to her throughout the day, ensuring
she was comfortable. He cared for her in this same way when
she later fought cancer.

Amma had her children young. My oldest brother,
Periyanna, was born in 1930, when she was only fourteen
years old. My birth certificate states that my mother was 27
years old when I was born. While I was her third living child,
she had lost two babies, one born between Periyanna and
my second oldest brother, Sampath, and another between
Sampath and me. Murali was born four years after me, af-
ter which she had another miscarriage. As was the custom
in those days, Amma gave birth to all of her children in her
father’s house, cared for by a distant family member called
Sigarathamma (Thamma). She had been widowed young,
and like the widows in those days, her head was shaved and
she wore only white.

Society was cruel to women in those days, as widows
had to shave their heads, wear only white and could not take
part in any auspicious occasion in the family. Their food had
to be bland, not stimulating, only sustaining.
During that time women in particular, ate
betel nut leaf (paan) with supari and calcium hydrox-
ide (chunna), which acted as a digestive and pro-
vided calcium. After childbirth, women were given
large quantities of paan, after every meal. However,
widows were not permitted to have paan, since it was
considered to be an aphrodisiac. Men who lost their
wives had no such rules though, living a normal life
and and marrying again. Women at the time accepted
these rules without question, following them rigidly.
Singarathamma always made her own food in a small
charcoal oven kept in the corner of the dining room.
She would prepare the most basic of foods, with very
little dal, not much oil, only a few vegetables and no
curds, only watery buttermilk. Yet she still cooked for her
nieces and the children, and her pumpkin chutney (thogai-
yal) was something to die for. She would share her food with
all of us so generously. Thinking about her I realize now that
she was unlike Sundari Patti, our cook, who had to work for a
living. Thamma had a loving family. If she had wanted to eat
better food, no one in the family would have had any objec-
tion, but she would not even think
of going against the norms set by a
society, which was biased against
women. I wonder why women then
showed such meek acceptance.

### Move to Bangalore
Appa was working at the
Central Bank and was posted in
Kumbakonam, though he was sent out of town frequently.
We were living in Dabir Street in a fairly big house. Appa be-
came a favourite with Amma’s family. They called him by his
pet name, Pattu. When Appa decided to resign from his job
to move to Bangalore to join in business with Amma’s side
of the family, they encouraged him. We moved to Bangalore,
where Periyamma lived.

Periyamma was Amma’s role model. She was the
wife of a senior engineer and her husband’s family was af-
fluent. She herself was quite fashionable and sophisticated,
dressing well and moved with ease in high society. She was
very particular about her looks and was extremely wealthy.
Once she came to our home in her car, a convenience that
was available to only the wealthiest of families in those days,
to take Amma out. When Amma was getting ready Periyam-
ma happened to look at her own hands,
and upon seeing wrinkles, she asked for some cold cream
(that was the moisturizer in those days) and massaged her
hands well before going out.

Though Amma and Appa were not as wealthy as
Periyappa, Periyamma and their family celebrate his 60th birthday in Bangalore.

Periyamma, Amma was extremely ambitious, and Periyam-
ma took Amma under her wing. Wanting to meet her sister’s
high expectations, Amma decided to continue her education,
which had stopped after fifth standard in the Saraswathi
Vidhyalaya in Kumbakonam. She wanted to learn English,
and with Periyamma’s help, she invited a woman named Ra-
jam Saraswathi to teach her English. Unmarried and living
alone, Rajam Saraswathi would walk long distances to reach
Amma’s house, but was rewarded since Amma was a good
student. Soon Amma could read and write reasonably well,
though I do not remember her speaking the language. Rajam
Saraswathi brought Amma a small book of one-page stories,
Aesop’s Fables, which is now with Ranga. Amma could read
all of them and write summaries of the stories. The lessons
stopped when Rajam Saraswathi opened her own school
“Amara Kala Niketan” at which Murali was the first student.
After we moved from Kumbakonam to Bangalore, I
was enrolled in St Teresa’s convent in the Tamil medium, a
path of learning where all subjects were taught in Tamil. Al-
ways highly interested in learning English herself and pass-
ing it on to her children, Amma wanted me enrolled in the
English medium class and used Periyamma’s connections to
achieve this end.

Periyamma’s mother-in-law, Ranganayaki Ammal, a
social worker, and Rajalakshmi Madhava Iyengar, the moth-
er of Appa’s partners, Kuppuswami and Rangaswamy were
both trustees of the elite school Mahila Seva Samaja. Amma
requested the management through her sister to admit me
in this school. I was given a test, a dictation of a paragraph
from a textbook. I passed and was admitted into the sixth
grade in 1954.

24Mahila Seva Samaja was ahead of its time. The
school had both English and Kannada medium classes. The
school ran adult education classes for women either desti-
tute or widowed. This class, as well as classes for boys, were
up to eighth standard. After that, only women and girls
could enroll in the common high school classes. One woman
in my class, Leelamma, whose husband had abandoned her,
studied very hard, passed her school final with me and later
became a teacher at the same school.


Unlike other schools at the time, this school was
run by dedicated, hard working and educated women. These
exceptional ladies belonged to the richer class, and were
modern enough to speak flawless English, though they wore
traditional nine-yard sarees. They had a tennis club in the
school and played the game dressed in the same manner.
They invited dignitaries who visited the city to the school,
including Indira Gandhi, Margaret Thatcher and Sarojini
Naidu, whose photographs still adorn the school. These
teachers encouraged students to be well behaved, exhibit
moral conduct and excel in school.

Amma was always extremely proud of my achieve-
ments, both in school and otherwise. I was good at reading
aloud in both Tamil and English, and both Bangala Thatha
and Chithi Thatha would ask me to read aloud. Amma was
very proud when they complimented me on my reading.
Furthermore, during my final year in school, I was awarded
the Sanskrit prize, instituted by Rajalakshmi Madhava Iyen-
gar, and my award pleased Amma to no end. The morning
after the prize distribution (my parents had not come for the
function) Rajalakshmi invited Amma and me to her house to
congratulate me. I cannot forget my mother’s beaming face.
Her daughter had done her proud.

Bangalore.

### Vibrant and impulsive

Amma had a variety of interests, one of which was
her love of reading, particularly Tamil magazines and novels.
She would cut out serial stories from weekly magazines and
have them bound into books. There were quite a few of them
at home and I have one or two of them with me. These mag-
azines would be delivered either on Thursday evenings or
Friday mornings, and I would hurry home on Thursdays to
receive them. We would discuss the plight of the characters,
and Amma could guess the names of the authors from their
styles of writing. These experiences inculcated good read-
ing habits in me, and I was able to get Jayalu and Ranga
interested in books. Jayalu is also a voracious reader, and I
remember that she read all of my MA literature course selec-
tions.

Amma also wanted to learn sewing, and she arranged
for Rangamani, a sewing teacher and Sundari Patti’s niece,
to come in once or twice a week. Rangamani lived in Nara-
simha Raja colony, far from our home. Despite the distance,
she would come to our house around 11 a.m. and stay until
evening teaching Amma and my sister-in-law, Saroja Manni
to sew. Sometimes Amma, Saroja Manni and I would walk to
Rangamani’s house and stay there the whole day, learning to
cut and make blouses. She made several blouses at home and
our servant boy Maya would stitch the buttons and hooks.
At the start of these lessons, Amma was in good health and
could walk to Rangamani’s house with ease. However, as she
became weaker, she stopped sewing, since she could not sit
for long at the machine.

Amma would also watch most Tamil movies, which
would would be her Sunday outing with Appa. We had a
gramophone and bought a lot of records. Though she was
tone deaf, she loved to listen to songs.

Some of Amma’s interests were uncommon for wom-
en during that time. I remember that she was fond of doing
yoga. Though she was always clad in nine yards saries, she
could do the poses with ease. He favorite were the shoulder
stand and crunches, which she could do despite her paunch.
I never asked her how she got interested in yoga and from
where she learnt these asanas. After reading this, my cousin,
Rangamani told me that Amma’s second brother Raghuna-
than (Thambi Mama) was very good at yoga and he taught
yogic exercises to his older brother and probably Amma had
also learned from him.

I heard from Papa Mutha (Rangamani’s father) that
Amma was very good at math. When Papa Mutha turned
eighty years old, I called to wish him, and he told me this sto-
ry. Amma had been very close to him. They were playmates
and often they would play pallanguzhi, a board game played
with either tamarind seeds or cowri shells. The jackpot was
the Kashi. The players have to be quick in calculating where
to start, so as to end with the Kashi. Amma was good at this
and often won the jackpot. The punishment for the loser was
to say loudly that he ate kootu made with a type of centipede
(kattu maravattai) and fried lentil cake (vada) made with the
the washerman’s (dhobi’s) feces. I do not know the reason
behind the choice of the raw material for the vada.

Periappa’s 60th birthday in their home.

Amma was very clever and spontaneous in her actions. Once
when I was returning from my friend’s house, there was a
hailstorm for about fifteen minutes, an extremely rare oc-
currence in Bangalore. I took shelter in a shop and was fasci-
nated to see even sized pebbles of ice showering down. With
so many people around I could not pick the hail in my hand,
but when I returned home, I was pleasantly surprised by
Amma, who had collected the hail in a vessel and stored it
in a thermos, where the ice pebbles remained until late night
for everyone to enjoy. This was the kind of zest and vibrancy
she exhibited in her short life.


Her quick thinking and presence of mind even saved
Saroja Manni’s life on one occasion. Food in our home was
always cooked in the kitchen on firewood or charcoal ovens,
but coffee was made by Appa in the dining room on an elec-
tric stove. The stove had open coils wound round and held in
place by metal loops, and was kept on a table with a wooden
plank at the foot of the table. Appa was very particular that ev-
eryone stand on the plank while operating the stove to avoid
electric shocks. Appa always made coffee in the mornings,
and either Amma or Saroja Manni made coffee in the after-
noons. One afternoon Amma and I were in the living room,
and Manni went to make coffee. As she placed water on the
stove, the loops holding the coil gave way, and the red-hot
coil sprang up and landed around her neck. She screamed
and put one foot on the ground, which gave her a shock. Her
sudden scream jolted us and we went running to the dining
room. I was shocked, but was immobilized by fear. Amma,
on the other hand, took one look at the scene and sprinted
to the verandah in the front of the house, opened the meter
box and switched off the main. The whole thing must have
taken just a few seconds. Amma removed the coil from Sa-
roja Manni’s neck, made her sit down, applied some cream
on the burn, and comforted her by giving her kozhumor,
warmed buttermilk given to people in shock, to drink. I was
amazed at my mother’s timely reaction. Later that year, Peri-
yamma’s son Sampath and his wife Thilaka toured Europe,
bringing gifts for the family, thoughtfully including an elec-
tric stove with covered coils for us.

However, Amma’s spontaneous nature sometimes
made her act impulsively and caused her to be quite short-
tempered, though her anger would subside quickly. One
day, Meenakshi, our maid stumbled over the store room
threshold. A nail from one of her toes got ripped off and her
toe started bleeding fast. Meenakshi screamed, pulled from
the shelf the bottle with turmeric and saffron powder (puja
kumkum) and applied it on the wound. Amma heard her
scream and came to see what happened. When she saw that
Meenakshi had applied the holy powder on her wound, she
took a stick and gave Meenakshi two whacks on her back.
She yelled at her for taking God’s kumkum and applying it
on her toes. Meenakshi did not rebel, instead she hung her
head in shame. She told Amma that she was very intolerant
to pain and that what she had done was very wrong. Having
beaten her, Amma then asked her to wash her feet and she
herself applied a medicinal cream over the wound.

I too had been subjected to Amma’s wrath,
though never my father’s. One Saturday, I came home
after the customary half-day of school and sat down for
lunch. There was lentil stew (kootu) with peanuts in it
and since I hated peanuts, I threw the plate with food
on the floor. The next minute Amma used her stick on me.
She said that I should either eat the food that had been made
at home or go hungry. Petrified, I picked up my plate and ate the remaining food, peanuts and all. I did not speak to her
for the next four or five days, but I don’t think she was sorry
for what she did. She said that I should know how to behave.
However, after that, whenever Sundari Paatti made kootu,
Amma would have some taken out for me without peanuts.

Amma could sometimes be hard to understand. One
year, when Ambulu Ammanga moved from Bangalore to
Salam, she left some Dasara dolls with Amma to be kept in
our doll arrangement (kolu). For some reason Amma told
Saroja Manni and me in a very stern voice that when people
visited our home, we should not tell them that some dolls
were the hand-me-downs from Ammanga. I wondered if
anyone cared to know this, but did not have the courage to
tell her so. However, what Amma did was really funny. To
every one, I mean every single person who visited our house,
she would show the small Dashavatharam set of ten dolls
and one or two other ones and say that Ambulu had given
them to her when she moved from Bangalore. Finally I could
not take it any more and asked her why she had to warn us
not to talk about Ammanga’s dolls and then tell every person
who came home about them. She looked at me for a minute,
shrugged her shoulders and turned around saying, “saridan
podi” - another way of asking me to mind my business.

bujan, during the Kashiyathra at Perianna’s wedding.


Amma was traditional in her beliefs, but at the same
time, practical in her thinking, as was demonstrated by this
incident. As with most houses at the time, we had an altar
(perumal modai) in our house in Bangalore with pictures
and idols of different gods and a saligramam, a set of puja
vessels, and a wooden plank with a bar of sandalwood, all of
which were a must in every girls’ dowry. A saligrammam is a
polished round stone found on the riverbanks in Nepal that
represents some form of Lord Vishnu. It was kept either in
an ornamental wooden box or in a silver box (nagar). The box
would look like a coiled snake with seven heads bent over the
box like an umbrella. It represents Lord Vishnu sleeping on
the snake (Adisesha) on the milky ocean. Aaradhanam is the
traditional puja that is done for Lord Vishnu, and was done
usually on Tuesdays, Fridays and some special festival days.
In our home, Shri Doaraiswamy Iyengar was the priest (Puja
Mama). He would arrive around 8 a.m. and start the Aarad-
hanam. He would first take out the saligramam, put it on a
silver plate and bathe it with well water. He would wipe it
dry and set it aside, and then he would start grinding sandal-
wood paste to apply on the Lord. He would then prepare the
holy water (perumal theertham), flavouring the water with
saffron, cardamom and basil (tulsi) leaves. It tasted divine.
Each of us was given either one spoon or three spoons. (I
would drink the remaining water after the Puja mama left).
One morning, when the Puja Mama was busy grinding san-
dal wood paste, Ramu, my three-year-old nephew, entered
the room and watched him work. When he saw that Mama
27was busy, he took the Saligramam in his hand and ran away.
Amma saw this and was aghast. She yelled at him to come
back, but Ramu ran into the street and Amma sprinted be-
hind him shouting. Someone on the road saw Amma run-
ning behind Ramu and caught him and handed him over to
her. Amma gave him one hard whack on his backside and
returned the saligramam for the puja. As was her habit,
Amma repeated this incident to everyone around her. She
said that she was shocked beyond words, that her heart
skipped a beat and her stomach felt uneasy thinking about
the grave sin that had been committed, that the child had
taken the saligramam to play with like a marble. That night
however, she confided in me that if she had not noticed what
Ramu had done then it was quite probable that Mama would
not have noticed the absence of the saligramam. He would
have closed the box and gone away. He could not be blamed
though, for he had to do Aaradhanam in about twenty hous-
es all over town within the next three hours and would have
been hard pressed for time.


### Growing family
It was around 1955 and Appa’s business was go-
ing well. Every day, after Appa had his morning snack and
before his bath, Amma and Appa would sit in the bedroom
near the living room and discuss the future. I remember that
around this time they had started buying one sovereign of
gold (8 grams) every month to make my wedding jewellery.
Over time, Amma collected quite a lot of gold and made jew-
elery for me, so as to be prepared in the event that my mar-
riage was arranged with short notice.


By this time, my older brothers were already mar-
ried and had kids. My eldest brother, Srinivasa Raghavan,
had two children then, Janaki and Ramu, and would later
have one more child, Jayalu. Sampath, my
second brother and his wife, Mala had
Lakshmi, and would later have three sons,
Krishnan, Shrikanth, and Raghavan. We
all lived together in the same house at
Gavipuram Extension in Bangalore until
around 1958, when Sampath was trans-
ferred to Hubli, a town in Karnataka, and
moved there with his family, before set-
tling down in Chennai, Tamil Nadu.


Janaki was the pet of her grandparents. After Ramu
was born, Janaki continued to sleep in the same bed as her
parents, perhaps because she was jealous of another sibling
sharing their attention. However, at around midnight, ev-
ery single night, she would start screaming, as only Janaki
could, with her screams reverberating throughout the house.
Amma felt that this may be happening because she was un-
comfortable in the crowded bed and she suggested to Anna
and Manni that Janaki should sleep with her. When Janaki
started sleeping between my parents on their bed, she im-
mediately stopped the racket and we were at peace.

### Holidays
Bangalore is 3,000 feet above sea level and during
those days it was not crowded, since the information tech-
nology companies had not yet taken over the city. Trees,
lawns and parks were plentiful and the city would be cool in
summer. People generally came to Bangalore to spend their
summers, but we on the other hand would leave the comfort
of Bangalore and spend our summers with Bangala Thatha
and Chithi Thatha in Kumbakonam and in Seethakaman-
galam, a village that they owned, about fourteen miles from
Kumbakonam.

Kumbakonam was tolerable since it was equipped
with electricity, running water and flushing toilets. But
Seethakamangalam, their village, was another story. There
was no electricity, no running water, and the area behind
the trees in the backyard served as the toilet. I remember we
would return to Bangalore covered with prickly heat all over
our bodies, and Appa would have Johnson’s Prickly Heat
Powder ready for us. Chithi Thatha insisted that we spend a
lot of time in the village with him and despite its rural setting,
I enjoyed my time there. Thatha had two clerks, Seshadri and
Tambi, who farmed Thatha’s lands. They lived in the area in
the village traditionally inhabited by Tamil brahmins (the
agraharam) with their families. Both Seshadri and Tambi
had several children each, who served as my playmates. Se-
shadri was also a very good cook. Before our arrival Thatha
would have him make sweets such as mysorepak, kunja ladu,
rava ladu, badhusha, wheat halva and theratti pal, and sa-
vouries such as thengozhal, manangombu, nada, murukku,
cheedai and more. These delicacies were stored in Thatha’s
bedroom in cane baskets kept under his bed and they were
for us to take. I simply loved eating.

The other source of attraction in Seethakamangalam
was the village pond, at the end of the street that Chithi Tha-
tha lived in. We would bathe in the pond surrounded by
women washing clothes and vessels, children performing
their morning ablutions, and cattle being washed by farm
hands. Buffaloes would be soaking without moving and
there would be water snakes swimming around. We did not
mind any of these. After bathing in the murky, filthy water
of the pond, I would refuse to bathe again
at home. I would tell Amma that I had
taken a long bath in the pond and needed
no more, but Amma never listened to my
pleadings.

28

Every house on that street had a triangular niche
on the outside wall near the entrance door. In the evenings,
earthen lamps would be placed in them. One such niche in
the corner house was deep and I heard that it had a beehive
in it. Curious to find out what a beehive looked like, I stuck
my hand right inside and out came fury. The bees came out
in large numbers and started stinging me all over. I screamed
and ran toward Chithi Thatha’s home. As the bees followed
me, I ran fast and closed the door behind me. By then of
course, I had been stung all over and the pain was excruciat-
ing. Thatha wanted to summon the doctor from the next vil-
lage, but my resourceful Amma told him not to. Appa would
always give Amma a first aid box, with every medicine that
she could possibly need. After all he owned a pharmacy! She
applied something all over my wounds and I was just fine.

Though I loved spending time with both Bangala
Thatha and Chithi Thatha in Kumbakonam, I could never
assume that I could take whatever I wanted from their home.
Chithi Thatha had a gramophone and lots of records, which
I loved listening to. The records were of the 78 rpm variety
and the gramaphone had to be wound to provide momen-
tum for the record to revolve. A needle was inserted into the
playing head, which had to be lowered on the revolving re-
cord. In those days it was a technological wonder. I would
keep playing those records particularly the sound track of
Mahatma Gandhi’s story, rendered by the then famous Ko-
thamangalam Subbu. The story was told in prose and song
and I found it extremely moving. In fact, I heard the record
so many times that I knew it by heart. I wanted this set of
four records for myself, so I could listen to them in Appa’s
gramophone player, back in Bangalore. Now when my
grand-daughter Apu visited me when she was little, she used
to help herself to anything she wanted from my house and as
far as I was concerned, whatever she liked was hers to take.
In fact, for this, she earned the name, Mohammad of Ghazni
from me, after the Moghul king who came to India multiple
times and plundered the country. Though I was close to my
grandfather, I could never take the liberty of assuming that
whatever was his was mine, so it was with great hesitation
that I asked him for the records. He immediately had them
packed for me. I was euphoric.

I loved to read to Bangala Thatha while he would
sit in a cane easy chair on the verandah in their farmhouse.
When I finished reading the chosen passage or story, he
would open a biscuit tin and give me exactly two Monaco
29
salt biscuits, imported treats that were always crisp and deli-
cious. I always wanted more but could never ask.

Our family not only visited Kumbakonam annually,
but also returned there for special occasions. In 1956 we
went there for Mahamagam, a festival that is celebrated once
every twelve years. I had taken time off from school to be at
this rare event, but when we got there, Chithi Thatha would
not let me go anywhere near the three temples and ponds
where people bathed and prayed. I was confined to the house
and satisfied myself by looking at the crowd of people from
the second floor balcony. On my return, Saraswathi Swamy,
a teacher at my school, asked me what exactly happened in
Kumbakonam and how I had enjoyed the experience. I could
have cried!


### Dasara
Dasara was an important festival in our home. Most homes would set up
displays of religious figurines arranged on steps in their living rooms. There
would be a miniature garden too. Women would invite one another over
to visit at any time over the ten-day festival and the hosts would give the
guests prasad (sundal) to take home. The children on the street would visit
every house, every day, more for the prasad than anything else. I too would
join them, asking the hosts at every house “Ree, bombe ittidheera?”(Sir or
Madam, have you arranged dolls in your house?) This was in spite of know-
ing full well that almost all the houses had doll arrangements.

### Beginning of the end
Amma and I pose in the compound of our house at Gavipuram Extension,
Bangalore, before her diagnosis.

Life went on this way for a few years, and then the
trouble started. Early in 1960, Amma started complaining
of difficulty swallowing due to an intense pain in her throat.
One Sunday towards the end of May, when Amma and Appa
went to watch a movie, I went with them. In those days ven-
dors would come inside the theater to sell snacks, drinks,
and betel leaf (pan) during the movie interval. As was his
habit, Appa bought pan for Amma. As we were talking about
an interesting scene in the movie, Amma tried to swallow a
bit of pan but found that she simply could not. Tears started
flowing from her eyes due to the excruciating pain. Appa got
her a cup of coffee, something Amma would never have con-
sented to drink on normal days. She grabbed it, started tak-
ing tiny sips and somehow managed to push the pan down
her throat. That would be the last movie I ever saw with both
of them.

Though something had to be done about Amma’s
throat condition, Amma and Appa still had to go to Kum-
bakonam the next day to attend a puja, which Chithi Tha-
tha had insisted they attend. Since there was no direct train
to Kumbakonam, they had to change trains at either Trichi
or Chennai. When they returned, passing through Chennai,
Appa and Sampath, who was living there, took Amma to a
doctor. A barium x-ray was taken and the next day Sampath
called to say that the doctor had some concerns and wanted
to examine Amma again. Amma was diagnosed with throat
cancer in June and was immediately admitted in to the Can-
cer Institute in Chennai; Appa stayed on with her.

The Cancer Institute was a newly founded organiza-
tion, headed by two dedicated oncologists, Drs. Sadashivan
and Shantha. They were pioneers in treating cancer with co-
balt rays, and since Amma was too weak to withstand sur-
gery, they began the cobalt radiation treatment at once. The
Institute treated poor people free of charge, though space
was limited. One long corridor was filled with patients lying
on beds on the floor. Despite the crowded conditions, treat-
ment was the same for both paying and free patients. Amma
was admitted into the female ward in a twin sharing room,
and her roommate was called Kaundammal. That was not
her real name, but indicated that she belonged to the Kaun-
da caste. She did not have children and her husband had
married again, though she continued to live with the family.
After she was diagnosed with cancer and was admitted into
the Institute, none of her family members bothered to visit
her. In contrast, Amma had visitors every evening, includ-
ing Sampath, Papa Mutha, and others. Kaundammal must
have felt very lonely during these times, and she would turn
towards the wall and pretend to be asleep. Appa and Amma
felt sorry for her, and tried to make her stay bearable by
bringing her coffee and offering her food. They became quite
friendly with each other as Amma’s stay progressed. Though
she felt bad for Kaundammal, Amma was secretly proud of
her own loving family, who ensured she never felt alone dur-
ing her stay. Every weekend Amma would go to Sampath’s
house in Lakshmipuram, returning on Monday morning
in time for her treatment. It was here that Amma met her
classmate Jayalakshmi, whose brother was Thiruvengada-
than Ramanujam (T. Ramanujam), who Appa knew during
his Kumbakonam days. At that point, Amma and Appa, with
my consent, decided to arrange my marriage, since Amma
knew she did not have much longer to live. When Shri. T.
Ramanujam suggested his son in law’s brother, G.R. Par-
thasarathy, for me to marry, Amma and Appa accepted.

Amma returned home in December of that year,
and the wedding arrangements began immediately. My fu-
ture husband came over to meet my family and myself, and
the wedding date was set for February 2nd, 1961. Though
she had to be careful about her diet and had to take many
medicines, Amma was in good spirits as she and Periyamma
started the preparations. Appa spared no expense, agreeing
to everything that Amma wanted. Saries were purchased
for the relatives and me, and my jewellery and silver vessels
were ordered. Appa designed a pair of large, heavy lamps
(kuthu vilakku) for me, and Amma bought me a a sandal
wood mandap, a silver nagar, and a gold cup designed like a
lotus to store the saligramam, out of which the gold cup has
remained in my bank locker for the past fifty years.

Amma made several trips to the busy Chickpet
wholesale market area to buy sarees, vessels, and other
wedding requirements and Periyamma never left her alone.
Within a month everything for the wedding had been bought.
Many of our relatives came for the wedding. A concert by
the then famous singer Madurai Mani Iyer was arranged.
The wedding was celebrated according to Amma’s wishes.
Murali’s Poonal was also held on the same day.

I stayed in Bangalore with my husband for a week
after the wedding. We then left for Chennai, from where we
proceeded to Lucknow where my husband had been post-
ed.

I remember the day of our departure well. Appa and
Amma came to the station, and we all cried. That was the last
day I saw her alive.

In April, Amma went to the Cancer Institute for a
check up, and was told that she was doing well. Amma’s
46th birthday that year was celebrated “like a child’s first
birthday”, according to her last letter to me written after
the event, in which she told me that she had missed me on
the occasion. To celebrate the milestone, Anna had got her
a two- stringed gold chain and Appa had insisted on getting
her a new silk sari, a green one with an orange and gold bor-
der.

In June, 1961, Amma’s health took a turn for the
worse. She began having chest pains. On her last evening, at
about 8 p.m., she complained of chest pain and a cardiolo-
gist came home to treat her. Amma was being helped by her
sister to get up to see the doctor. when she passed away. She
died on Wednesday, July 27th, 1961, with a heart specialist
waiting outside the room.

At the time of her death I was in Delhi with GRP,
who had to do some training there. When we received the
telegram in Delhi informing us about Amma’s demise, the
scene played out like a Bollywood movie. I received the
news around midnight, and at once GRP and I agreed that I
should leave for Bangalore on the next flight. In those days
the journey from Delhi to Bangalore, via Hyderabad, took
nearly seven hours. We went to the airport and bought the
ticket, but there was still no guarantee that I would get a
seat in Hyderabad to proceed to Bangalore. Some gentle-
man who was also traveling to Bangalore offered to help me,
offering me his seat from Hyderabad to Bangalore in case I
did not have one. This kind gesture proved to be unneces-
sary, since I got a seat on the plane in Hyderabad, and was
soon on my way to Bangalore.

I was numb throughout the flight. I had never flown
before and had never even traveled anywhere alone. When
I reached Bangalore, in the afternoon, I just stood there,
wondering what I should do. Periyamma had thought ahead
though, and asked Appa to wait for at least one flight from
Delhi in case I came. Since I had been such a protected
daughter, accompanied by a servant wherever I went as a
child, Appa did not even think that I would travel all the
way from Delhi by plane. The body was taken for the last
rites, but despite this, Periyamma did not give up, asking
Kannan, her eldest son, to send someone to the airport. As
I stood, completely confused, in the airport, the gentleman
approached me, asking if I was Kannan’s cousin Kamala. He
said that Kannan had asked him to put me on the transit bus
from the airport to the airline office at South Parade. I could
take a taxi from there to reach home. I had doubts whether
I should go with him, so I did the only sensible thing I had
done all day; I telephoned home. Periyamma picked up the
phone, and when she heard my voice she said, “Do not have
any expectations. Your Amma’s remains have already been
taken away.” She told me that the house was getting washed,
as is the custom after a death in the family. Some workers from the pharmacy were helping out, and Periyamma
asked one of them, Srinivas, to go to the cemetery.
She told him to stop the proceedings if Amma’s body
had not been lit yet, but if it had, he was to come back
without telling anyone anything. She then called Kan-
nan and asked him to pick me up from the airline of-
fice. They later told me that Srinivas went very fast and
when he saw that Anna was getting ready to light the
pyre, he rang a bell loudly and shouted for them to wait.
While this was occurring, Kannan picked me up from
the airline office and took me straight to the cemetery.
Amma had been washed and had been placed on the
pyre, with firewood piled all over her body, though her
face and arms were still visible. Her hands were folded
in a namaste and her visible elbow was smooth and
white. I took one long look at her face, which appeared
to be smiling. The memory of her face and elbow is still
etched in my mind. As I write this now, I am reliving
that moment. Anna and Sampath were standing near
the body with tears flowing down their faces, while Mu-
rali and Appa were standing at a distance. I put some
rice in Amma’s mouth and then went and stood with
Appa. As the body was consigned to the flames, Appa’s
face was a picture of agony and Murali was shivering.
Appa held my hands as we said good-bye to Amma. I
do not remember if we ate lunch, which had been sent
from Periyamma’s house, that day. Our home had been
completely washed to remove all traces of my mother,
and the thirteen day rites were performed with extreme
devotion.

When Amma passed away Janaki, Lakshmi
and Ramu were very young. Kichi must have been
three months old. None of the other grand children
have any idea about the kind of person she was. But
Rangamani had visited our home many times. Amma
and all of us would meet annually in Kumbakonam at
my Mama’s house.

hind and Murali, the bowler playing an imaginary game of cricket

I was quite apprehensive when I started Amma’s bi-
ography. My time with her was very short. She was gone at
such a young age and at the most impressionable period of
my life. I was not sure that I would be able to put on paper
the essence of her personality. I did ask around and started
writing. Now looking back I feel I may have touched upon
her many qualities that endeared her to so many. She was
fun loving, so interested in life and was ever willing to learn.
She was ambitious for her children and dearly loved and was
devoted to her husband, supproting him always. She was
also impulsive and short tempered and many a time acted
at the spur of the moment. What makes me happy is the fact
that the events that I have described in this record were all
experienced by me personally. They were not hearsay. Even
in her short life she presented a complete picture of herself
that I was able to put in writing. Such was her personality.
Had she lived longer, all her children would have had so
much to share with her. She too would have been proud of
33
her children and grandchildren. But I am happy that I was
able to do this much. Silly thought, but she too would have
been interested in knowing what her children felt about her
and how her daughter picturised her.

### Gold belt
As shown in the photo above, Amma used to wear a solid gold belt that
was pawned repeatedly whenever a lump sum of money was needed.
I remember that the belt was pawned so Perianna could buy his first BSA
motorbike. He redeemed the belt within the next few months and returned
it to Amma.

### Rangamani's account
Rangamani has some good memo-
ries of my mother and she wrote a lovely email about
Amma, which I have incorporated verbatim. Rangamani wrote.......

Her name was Jayalakshmi. Her husband lovingly
called her Jayam. She was my father’s aunt and we children
called her Kunjathai. The first thing I remember about her is her
smile. It was from the heart and lit up her face. She was always
available for us kids, ready to play games and share jokes.
More hilarious than the games we played were the punish-
ments she invented for the loser. She would make the loser re-
peat horrible things like “I ate a pudding made of centipede”
or “I made vadas out of dobhi’s shit and ate them”. Once one
of us uttered these words, the entire clan would tease him or
her the whole day, saying he or she stank because of what
he or she ate, quoting the words that person said and mak-
ing him or her cringe. She would never make fun of the loser
though, and I remember how she would pull me close to her
and hug me and kiss me on my head. That made me feel
very special and the horror of the punishment melted away.
It was customary to gather at my grandmother’s home
for holidays. All of our relatives and their kids came, as would
Kunjathai. Once she brought a huge load of high quality dry
fruits, which vanished seconds after we pounced on them,
much to her amusement. She said that we gobbled up the
food like we had never seen it before, and from then on, dry
fruits were always known as “what has never been seen before”
(kannale kanathathu). Every holiday she made sure she would
bring larger and larger loads of these and they still vanished in
minutes. Years after she passed away, we still call dry fruits by
the name she gave them and remember her with love and joy.
She was a favorite of a grand uncle, who was a terror
to everyone else. Once, when my parents and others sneaked
out to a late night movie, they made sure she led them on their
return home. Though our grand uncle was waiting with severe
countenance, he could not be angry once he saw her. While
she held a loving conversation with him, the rest of the culprits
snuck quietly indoors, spared from his harsh words. Needless
to say, Kunjathai was the heroine for the next several days!
She was tone deaf but nevertheless burst into song
whenever she wanted. She could enjoy a joke at her own
expense and said that her music master fell before a run-
ning train since he was unable to teach her. This became a
legend in the family and whenever a girl proposed to learn
music, she was always warned to think of the teacher’s fate!
We were still young when she was struck by cancer.

We lived in Chennai and she came over frequently for treat-
ment at Cancer Institute. Her family and the entire clan trav-
eled to the Institute to be with her at the hospital, and made
sure to bring her food and other requirements. Her youngest
son was couple of years older than me and we kids were
taken to visit her off and on. I remember once when we
were at her side, she showed us a horrible festering wound in
her arm. We were shocked, moved to tears by the sight. She
then pulled her arm away and laughed, saying it was made
from dye. We believed her and laughed at her prank, telling
her not to fool us again. Looking back, I cannot imagine how
much effort it must have taken her to make light of her suf-
fering. But that was who she was, always thinking of others.
When the hospital closed for couple of days for
32some reason, we were looking forward to having her
home, and she soon arrived, accompanied by another
patient, a lady who had nowhere to go since her rela-
tives lived far away. She made sure her friend was giv-
en as much love and affection as she herself received.

During her life, she had a partner who was as kind
as she was herself. Her husband was a very dear uncle to
us. They enjoyed life, despite her sickness. They saw the
latest movies, in English or Tamil, and always held hands
when they walked, a rarity for those times. He loved her
dearly and supported her in everything. Like the rest of
us, he was shattered when she passed away in her forties.
Kunjathai lived at a time when girls were not edu-
cated. She was married off early and sent off to Banga-
lore. She must have faced a lot of ups and downs in life, as
money was tight sometimes. She still never let anything bring
her down and lived with zeal until the end of her life. De-
cades after her demise, the entire clan still talks of her with
love, readily recalling many happy memories. She made an
impact on me as a child and I will always think of her with
joy and awe for the way she fought through her demand-
ing illness and yet remained a gentle and affectionate aunt.

Author’s note: Amma was called Kunjathai as she was the
youngest among the siblings and was almost the contempo-
rary of her nephew, Papa Mutha and Ambulu Ammanga. She
was indeed the favourite among all of her nieces and nephews.
Her music master did die in a tragic accident when
he fell headlong on the railway track and was crushed.
Amma could still laugh at herself when people teased her
that he committed suicide due to her lack of singing skill.

The wound that Rangamani saw was not ac-
tually a dye, but a wound on her skin due to exposure
to cobalt rays. She had another one near on her chest,
and they were extremely painful. I remember her tell-
ing me that her cancer was getting killed in that place.

### Ambulu account
Ambulu Ammanga has another story about Amma. There was a difference of six
years between Amma and Ammanga. As a child, Ammanga would become
breathless when she cried, and Amma had heard that if this happened, the child
should be made to lie on the ground on her stomach and should be patted on
the back side of her neck. Once when this happened, Amma picked up the child
and dropped her headlong on the ground, slapping the child’s neck. Ammanga
still laughs about this incident, saying, “Your mother tried her best. Still I survived.”

## Conclusion
And to conclude.......

Five years back Sampath wanted to do some-
thing special in Appa and Amma’s memory. It was decided
to finance the cost of building a green room in the new audi-
torium in Mahila Seva Samaja. Amma had great regard for
that school and had insisted that Janaki also be admitted in
the same school, years after I graduated from the institution.
Sampath had requested every one of the family to contribute
what they could. Pity he did not live to see complete. The
room stands today with a marble tablet above the door with
the names of my parents.

Last year we were in London at Jayalu’s home on
Appa’s death anniversary. To comemmorate the day, Jayalu
arranged for an aarati at the temple in the names of both my
parents. This year Jayalu took part in a marathon walk in
aid of cancer research in the UK and dedicated her participa-
tion to Amma’s memory. I would like to think that it is the
biography that has brought the grandchildren closer to their
grandparents.

Even at the age of sixty-seven, I have memories
that come flooding into my mind. Fortunately, there are
still some people in my family who could give an idea of
the younger days of my parents. My daughters, cousin and
nieces encouraged me to write this biographical account.
My only regret is that none of my three brothers is
alive to read the biography. Had they been around, I would
have had a great time writing. They would have agreed
with some narrations, refuted some others, had their own
versions of some events, corrected my thought process and
would have finally grunted their approval. But it was not to
be.

By writing their biography, I do not know if I have
paid my tribute to my parents. But during the process of
writing this I have relived my days with them, joys, sorrows
and all. I feel blessed.34
