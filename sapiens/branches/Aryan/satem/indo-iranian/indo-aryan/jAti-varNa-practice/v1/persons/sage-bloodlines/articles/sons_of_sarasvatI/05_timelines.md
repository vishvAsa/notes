Summary Timeline of Garaḷapurī śāstri’s Life SosaleGaraḷapurīŚāstriwasa *HoysaḷaKarṇāṭakaSmārta* brāhmaṇa of the *Kāśyapa gōtra*. His family were followers of the *Drāhyāyaṇa* *S ūtra*of the tradition of the *Sāmavēda*. His earliest known ancestor was Tammaṇṇa Śāstri, whose ancestors arrived in Ānēgondi from Dōrasamudra *circa*1300–1400 C.E. Tammaṇṇa Śāstri appears to have been minister to *Aḷiya*Rāma Rāya’s descendants from the Āravīḍu lineage, who had continued at Ānēgondi after the disastrous loss at Tāḷikōṭe. Following a devastating attack by Gōlkoṇḍa *circa*1638 C.E., however, Tammaṇṇa Śāstri departed Ānēgondi for Anantaśayana. He appears to have arrived at Ānēkallu

just as Tammēgauḍa of the Sugaṭuru lineage was fortifying Ānēkallu, having been forced to move there after losing Hosakōṭe to the Bijāpur army under Śivāji’s father Śāhji. Subsequently, one of Tammaṇṇa Śāstri’s sons continued in Ānēkallu, but the other son Śaṇkarabhaṭṭa moved to Māgaḍi. 

Śaṇkarabhaṭṭa’s son Veṇkaṭarāmabhaṭṭa later moved to Sōsale. Veṇkaṭarāmabhaṭṭa’s son was Timmappa Śāstri, whose son Veṇkaṭadāsappa, better known as Sōsale Aṇṇayya Śāstri, was Garaḷapurī Śāstri’s father.

Garaḷapurī śāstri’s Known Works

Garaḷapurī Śāstri’s known works include the *Kr̥ṣṇabhūpāḻīyam*, the *Cam-p ūrāmāyaṇa Yuddhakāṇḍa*, a commentary on the *Ṉīlakaṇṭhavijaya *\(in-complete\), and the *Hariharāṣṭōttara*, a poetic work that could be read either as in praise of Viṣṇu or Śiva. He also had substantial scholarship in medicine and logic. Jointly with Hulluhaḷḷi Nallāṁ Gōpalakr̥ṣṇācārya, he produced a corrected edition of the *Aṣṭāṇgahr̥daya*, a classical work on Āyurveda by Bāhaṭācārya. His surviving manuscripts include a substantial *kroḍapatra* on Gadādhara’s *Sāmānyanirukti *\(unpublished\). His *¯*

*Aryā*metre verses re-

sponding to the *Bhāgavatasaptāha*invitation from an unidentifiied Marāṭha kingdom, and several *citrakāvya*compositions appear in his biography. He is known to have authored many other poetical compositions, which are now lost. Additional works may exist in the now inaccessible archive of manuscripts under the control of Mr Sandeep Sastry. He also had substantial musical skills, and according to family tradition, the well-known musical composition *Śr̥ṇgāralaharī*in *rāga Ṉīlāmbarī*is the result of a collaboration between him and his patron *Aḷiya*Liṇgarāje Arasu. 

Summary Timeline of Śrīkaṇṭha śāstri’s Life ŚrīkaṇṭhaŚāstriwasa *Smārta* brāhmaṇafromthe *HoysaḷaKarṇāṭaka* community, of the *Bhāradvāja gōtra*and the *¯*

*Aśvalāyana S ūtra*of the

*R.gvēdic*tradition. His ancestor Gaṇgādhara “Vāraṇāsi”, originally from Bādāmi, came to Honnavaḷḷi in Tumakūru district to escape political unrest. The local Muslim ruler’s depredations caused him to move to Sindhughaṭṭa, where the local *pāḷeyagāra*welcomed him, supporting him with a *vr̥tti*. Of his sons Narasiṁhabhaṭṭa and Kr̥ṣṇabhaṭṭa, the former remained in Sindhughaṭṭa. Kr̥ṣṇabhaṭṭa’s second son Veṇkaṭaramaṇa Śāstri, a deep scholar, came to Mais ūru in 1931. He attained such recognition at the royal court as to have received great benefactions from prominent fiigures, despite his indifference to worldly matters. The renowned scholar Rāmaśēṣa Śāstri gifted away his own *vr̥tti*in the Katvāḍipura *agrahāra*to Veṇkaṭaramaṇa Śāstri. Kr̥ṣṇarāja Voḍeyar III sought to keep him at his court, but later accommodated his wishes by granting him a position at the temple in Cāmarājanagara. Veṇkaṭaramaṇa Śāstri later became a *saṁnyāsi*, and spent his fiinal days in Kāśī. Śrīkaṇṭha Śāstri was Veṇkaṭaramaṇa Śāstri’s eldest son.

Śrīkaṇṭha śāstri’s Known Works

Śrīkaṇṭha Śāstri’s fiirst major work was the *Ti ˙nantar ūpāvali*, a work on grammar which was misappropriated by a trusted friend and published under his own name.

His second major work was the monumental *Dhātur ūpaprakāśikā*, a comprehensive compendium of *Saṁskr̥ta*verbal conjugations. His *Mahārājābhyudayapraśaṁsā*is a collection of verses in praise of Kr̥ṣṇarāja Voḍeyar IV, his family, and achievements under his rule. He also completed three-fourths of a translation into *Saṁskr̥ta*of the *Yavanayāmiṉī Vinōda Kathegaḷu*by Veda-Mitra, a Kannada version of the *Arabian Nights.*Śrīkaṇṭha Śāstri also worked on the *Annals of the Mysore Royal Family *\( *Śrīmanmahārajaravara* *Vaṁśāvaḷi*\), and on the staff of the Kannaḍa monthly *Hitabōdhiṉī. *
