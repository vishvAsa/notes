Born in 1925. sri http://U.Ve thiruvaheendrapuram Devanathachar, the acharya through who's help samveda was saved from getting lost.

Once upon a time in 1960, just 10 ashtabrahmana adhyayis (one who has learnt all 8 brahmanas of kauthuma samaveda) in Tamilnadu and just 20 across India were there.

One of them is Srirangam Saamam Swamy (sri U. Ve thiruvaheendrapuram Devanathachar.) He was a legendary teacher who taught samveda all his life and now  due ti his efforts around 100 students and prasishyas of his are ashtabrahmana adhyayis.
He was instrumental in keeping karnaparampara of the shakha's brahmanas. Without him and Kanchi matha Murali Krishna shrauti family, Samaveda Brahmana might've been lost in adhyayana parampara.
