      <description>&lt;p&gt;The above paragraph is from a small article I wrote last year on Karapātra Svāmī falling for an American creationist hoax in his book ‘Mārksavāda Aura Rāmarājya’.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;when-karapātra-svāmī-fell-for-an-american-creationist-hoax&#34;&gt;When Karapātra Svāmī fell for an American creationist hoax&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Karapātra Svāmī was undoubtedly a great scholar of Sanskrit, Sanātana scriptures and Vedānta. His works in these fields are an invaluable addition to the Indic knowledge traditions. However, outside these fields, his knowledge was quite limited. He had no training or specialised knowledge in non-Indic languages, history, science, anthropology, etc. This, per se, is not a problem; there are limits to every human mind. But it becomes a problem when a scholar ventures way out of their areas of scholarship, not knowing where to stop, and starts speaking or writing about things they have zero idea about. This was a big problem with Karapātra Svāmī (or his ghostwriters, more on this later); he did not know where and when to stop.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
