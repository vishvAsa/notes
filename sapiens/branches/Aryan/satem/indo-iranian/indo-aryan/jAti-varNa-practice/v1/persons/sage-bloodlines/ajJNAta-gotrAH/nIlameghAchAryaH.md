> Before settling down to a more strict Achara and Anushtana, he started on his pilgrimage to Divya Kshetras in North India after obtaining permission from his Revered Acharya, Sri Koliyalam Swami. On his Acharya's suggestion he also took with him as  companion, his Sateertiya, Sri Nilameghacharya, a Brahmachari. They  used to travel during nights and during daytime stay in wayside Vaishnavite villages and spent the day doing Upanyasams on Sri Desika Sampradaya in Sanskrit while the local pandits translated the same in local languages, to the audience. This took four months for them to reach Calcutta.
