      <description>&lt;p&gt;Sri Sri Rangapriya Sri Srih&lt;br&gt;&#xA;By: Dr R Mohan&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;intro-anecdote&#34;&gt;Intro anecdote&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The setting : A yoga conference in Hardwar.  A sadhu in ochre, with a face radiant as the sun, a gaze as deep as the ocean, walked towards the venue with measured steps and a dignified gait. A volunteer enquired in half amusement, “Maharaj aapka car kahan hai? “. A second’s silence later, the sadhu drew a deep breath and with gaze turned inwards replied, “Hamara car om-kaar hai” and walked on unperturbed. The sadhu was Sri Sri Rangapriya Swamiji. In an age where commercialisation has invaded even spirituality, he was single-minded in his pursuit and advocacy of spirituality and simplicity. In his later days when material comforts came to him unasked, he remained unattached to them, ever ready to relinquish them.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
