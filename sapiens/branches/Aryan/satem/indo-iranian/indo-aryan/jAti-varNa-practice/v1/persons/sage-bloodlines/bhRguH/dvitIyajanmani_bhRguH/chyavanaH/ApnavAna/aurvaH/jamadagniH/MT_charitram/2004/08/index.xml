He&#xA;descended to the sattra of the 3 seers. He asked preNin the son of&#xA;somAhita, madhucchandas the vaishvAmitra and asita the kAshyapa to make&#xA;their wishes. preNin wished that he should have the best goat and that&#xA;which ever woman he calls unto him should desire him.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&#34;https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2004/08/17/sadness/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The smart and ever-scheming GS had been my student some years ago. He&#xA;came from a sAma vedic family of bharadvAjas. His academic record had&#xA;been a long string of successes, like the victories of Alexander of&#xA;Macedon. I had lead him to a few glorious victories and he had paid me&#xA;suitable dakShiNa for that. He put to good use what he learned from me&#xA;as he landed one great job after another, making enormous fiduciary&#xA;killings on the way. He was always the typical Indian sincere kind,&#xA;working unbelievably hard at anything he did. His energy was not unlike&#xA;that of the** princess of Hayastan**, and he could go on at one meal a&#xA;day for long. He never really cared if his food tasted good or bad, he&#xA;never cared for entertainment nor those long-winding chatter sessions&#xA;with our chosen ones that the rest of us blithely gave ourselves to.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>A strange day</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&#34;https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2004/08/02/a-strange-day/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It had been pouring heavily. Normally on such a day I would have not&#xA;liked to step out of the warmth of the house and drive through the slush&#xA;and the dampness of the Hindustani monsoon. But that was a strange day.&#xA;There was this sense of adventure that seized me and I got on to my&#xA;aging black “horse” and drove on till I reached the bike stand. Having&#xA;parked and not minding the oppression caused by indra’s bounty I head&#xA;straight to the classroom. R was tensely looking out from the window and&#xA;even as I got in, I was followed by the droning botany lecturer. This&#xA;damped all the built up excitment and we had to put up with an hour of&#xA;the botany buzz with a straight face. It often puzzled me how my&#xA;studious deluded classmates so thoroughly enjoyed these interminable&#xA;sessions with the relish similar to what one might get while enjoying a&#xA;ripe mango or a jackfruit.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
