#### Descent (23andme 2017)
- A
    - 275,000 Years Ago
- F-M89
    - 76,000 Years Ago
- K-M9
    - 53,000 Years Ago
- R-M207
    - 35,000 Years Ago
- R-M420 (R1a)
    - 25,000 Years Ago
- R-SRY1532.2 (R1a1)
- R-M17/M198 (R1a1a)
    - R-M512 snp
        - "Today, the men who share your haplogroup are most common in Eastern Europe, Russia and Ukraine. The lineage is also quite common in Poland, but decreases in frequency toward the Mediterranean countries. Farther to the west, about one-third of Norwegian men and a quarter of men from the far northern British Isles carry R-M512. Their ancestors arrived with various groups over the past 2,000 years, including with the Anglo-Saxons from central Europe in the 5th century and the Vikings who came from Scandinavia beginning about 800 CE. Additionally, the haplogroup is still relatively common in the Middle East, as well as in Central and South Asia where it reaches levels of up to 60% among the Kyrgyz and the Tajiks."

- Haplogroup R
    - R arose in the Near East about 60,000 years ago, not long after humans first spread out of Africa into southwestern Asia.

### Modeling
qpAdm models (IVC = Indus Valley Civilization, Irula = A tribe acting as a placeholder for early Indian hunter gatherers)

- 52.1 IVC_I8726 (90% IranN), 35.8 Onge, 12.2 Sintashta with p=0.2
- 45.6% IVC (70% IranN, 25% AASI and 5% neolithic steppe), 45.7% Irula, 8.6% Sintashta. Steppe rich ancestors admixed with Steppe poor ancestors around 300 AD. (algorithm DATES developed by Moorjani. date was not accurate. Unfortunately for getting decent admixture dates one needs many samples.)

- The fundamental issue is this: IVC samples we have so far DON'T form a cluster. But they are very different from each other - this is one main reason why Razib, MT, etc believe that jAti stratification predated the Arya-s. For the sake of simplicity all of them are combined in literature as IVCperiphery.
