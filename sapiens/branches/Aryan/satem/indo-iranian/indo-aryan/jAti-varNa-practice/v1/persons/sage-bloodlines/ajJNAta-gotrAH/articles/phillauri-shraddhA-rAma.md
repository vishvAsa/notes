Do you know the most famous Arti "Om Jai Jagdeesh Hare" was written by a Punjabi Hindu Brahmin, Shraddha Ram Phillauri? Pandit Shraddha Ram was born in 1837 at Phillaur (Jullundur district), During the 1857 war, he was 19 years old,& he began to preach the Mahabharata in public 

He asked Hindus to follow the ritual of purification,apply tilak on their foreheads, and greet each other with ‘Jayati Hari’  (Victory to the Gods). It is said that when Maharaja of Kapurthala was about to convert to Christianity, Shraddha Ram ji persuaded him not to do so. 

He continued to defend orthodox Hinduism and bitterly condemned Christian missionaries According to him 'there are only two things you can get from being in the Christian religion that are not possible in Hindu dharma — one is liquor & the other is eating left over food. He published a number of books and tracts for defending the Sanatana Dharma through Hindu scriptures. In 1880, he established Hari Gyan Mandir in Lahore. Along with this he opened a school where the four Vedas would be taught.

His defensive campaign was the first attempt to protect Hindu orthodoxy in Punjab and was a natural outgrowth of socioreligious movements that threatened the entrenched religious establishment of the Hindu community.

Some of his notable works are:

- Bhagyawati  (first Hindi novel)
- Dharma Raksha (In defence of religion)
  -Sikhan De Raj Di Vithia
  -Punjabi Batcheet
  -Satya Dharm Muktavli
  -Shatopadesh
  -Satyamrit Pravaha etc.

He passed away in the first quarter of 1881.The services of Pandit Shardha Ram Phillauri to Sanatana Dharma are immense.

One of the greatest writers of his time, Phillauri, not only gave the legendary religious offering to the Hindus, but also took an active part in the freedom struggle. He also did significant work for the upliftment of widows and against child marriage too.
