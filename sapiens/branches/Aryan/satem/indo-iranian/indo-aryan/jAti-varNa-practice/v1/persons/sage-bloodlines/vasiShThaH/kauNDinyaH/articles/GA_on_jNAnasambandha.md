(Vaik─Бsi/Vai┼Ы─Бkha-M┼лla) (26 May) is the day of Gurup┼лj─Б of the one who drank milk from Dev─лтАЩs hands when He was just three, the day when He attained union with ┼Ъiva after 16 years of a divine & glorious life, culminating with His divine marriage. He is empir─Бn (our Lord; the Lord of ┼Ъaivas)

He is Kauс╣Зiya-D─лpan, the light of Kauс╣Зс╕Нinya Gotra. He is the Prince of Pugali that is, S─лrk─Бzhi, where He was born. He is the King of ┼Ъaivas, ┼Ъaivattvar Arasu. 

His name is preceded by the adjective, N─Бnmarai as He is possessed of the 4 Vedas; by the adjective Naс╣нramil as He is possessed of the goodly tamizh language. He is Tamizh─Бkaran; the very form of Tamizh. 

He is the one who, while still a young boy, revived the girl P┼лmp─Бvai from an urn of her ashes outside the house of Kap─Бl─л┼Ыa at Mayil─Бpuri (Mylapore, TN) & when her father wanted to offer Him her hand in marriage, He said тАЬBy HaraтАЩs grace I caused her to be revived, therefore it will not be appropriateтАЭ, implying that P┼лmp─Бvai is like His daughter. 

He quelled the wicked Bauddhas & Jainas who attacked Veda & ┼Ъaivam. 

He has touched the lives of more of the 63 N─Бyanm─Бr than any other N─Бyan─Бr. He led several of the N─Бyanm─Бr to Mukti on the day of His marriage to Mother Stotrap┼лrс╣З─Бmbik─Б:

He is:

It is by the grace of the Seng┼Нl (Sceptre) blessed with His sacred hymn (K┼Нlaru-Tiruppathikam) that Bh─БrataтАЩs sovereignty has stood safeguarded all these decades despite having enemies on all sides. 

Is there anyone like Tiruj├▒─Бnasambandhar? There never was & never will there be one like Him.

## Wedding
Is there a day like today? Today is the рдЧреБрд░реБрдкреВрдЬрд╛ & wedding anniversary ЁЯЩВ of рд╢реНрд░реА-рдЬреНрдЮрд╛рдирд╕рдореНрдмрдиреНрдз, the day he merged with рд╢рд┐рд╡ right after his divine wedding at the temple of рд╢рд┐рд╡рд▓реЛрдХ-рддреНрдпрд╛рдЧреЗрд╢ at рдирд▓реНрд▓реВрд░реН-рдкреЖрд░реБрдордгрдореН.

All his guests at the wedding were also granted the merger with the рд╢рд┐рд╡рдЬреНрдпреЛрддрд┐, including 3 рдирд╛рдпрдиреНрдорд╛рд░реН: 

- рддрд┐рд░реБ-рдиреАрд▓рдирдХреНрдХрд░реН (who was the glorious рдкреБрд░реЛрд╣рд┐рдд conducting the wedding rituals), his long-time companion, 
- рдиреАрд▓рдХрдгреНрда-рдпрд╛рд┤реНрдкреНрдкрд╛рдгрд░реН (the player of the рдпрд╛рд┤реН instrument) & 
- рдореБрд░реБрдЧ-рдирд╛рдпрдирд╛рд░реН.

He is the рдирд╛рдпрдирд╛рд░реН (1 of the 63 рдирд╛рдпрдиреНрдорд╛рд░реН, exalted devotees of рд╢рд┐рд╡) who has impacted so many other рдирд╛рдпрдиреНрдорд╛рд░реН. Not only was he the reason for 3 other рдирд╛рдпрдиреНрдорд╛рд░реН getting рдореБрдХреНрддрд┐, he was also the special object of worship for рдЧрдгрдирд╛рде-рдирд╛рдпрдирд╛рд░реН.

The рдирд╛рдпрдирд╛рд░реН рдЪрд┐рд▒реБрддреНрддреЖрдгреНрдбрд░реН & his son, рдЪреАрд░рд╛рд│рдиреН (who will both attain рдореБрдХреНрддрд┐ in a few years after рдЪреАрд░рд╛рд│рдиреН grows up) also received the special grace of the prince of рд╕реАрд░реНрдХрд╛рд┤рд┐ (рд╕рдореНрдмрдиреНрдзрд░реН), who mentions рдЪрд┐рд▒реБрддреНрддреЖрдгреНрдбрд░реНтАЩs name throughout a decad & рдЪреАрд░рд╛рд│рдиреНтАЩs name once.

That verse is this: http://www.thevaaram.org/thirumurai_1/songview.php?thiru=3&Song_idField=30630&padhi=063&startLimit=8&limitPerPage=1&sortBy=&sortOrder=DESC


Ordinarily, it is translated to mean that one (anyone) may one day attain the grace of рдЧрдгрдкрддреАрд╢реНрд╡рд░ (рдЙрддреНрддрд░рдкрд╢реБрдкрддреАрд╢реНрд╡рд░) who dwells in рддрд┐рд░реБрдЪреЖрдЩреНрдХрд╛рдЯреНрдЯрдЩреНрдХреБрдбрд┐ town of рдЪрд┐рд▒реБрддреНрддреЖрдгреНрдбрд░реН & his son, рдЪреАрд░рд╛рд│рдиреН.

However, it can also be understood to mean that рдЪрд┐рд▒реБрддреНрддреЖрдгреНрдбрд░реН & his son, рдЪреАрд░рд╛рд│рдиреН will one day attain the grace of the god of рддрд┐рд░реБрдЪреЖрдЩреНрдХрд╛рдЯреНрдЯрдЩреНрдХреБрдбрд┐. Verily, some have understood this verse as a cryptic benediction of рд╕рдореНрдмрдиреНрдзрд░реН for рдЪрд┐рд▒реБрддреНрддреЖрдгреНрдбрд░реН & his family to attain рдореБрдХреНрддрд┐.

It is рд╕рдореНрдмрдиреНрдзрд░реН that рд╕реБрдиреНрджрд░рдореВрд░реНрддрд┐-рдирд╛рдпрдирд╛рд░реН (who lived a century later), in his list of names of 60 рдирд╛рдпрдиреНрдорд╛рд░реН, calls, тАЬрдОрдореНрдкрд┐рд░рд╛рдиреНтАЭ (my master). Such was the reverence рд╕реБрдиреНрджрд░ had for the divine child that he did not dare enter the latterтАЩs birthplace of рд╕реАрд░реНрдХрд╛рд┤рд┐!!


Why was рд╕рдореНрдмрдиреНрдзрд░реН born? What was the purpose of his birth? This is the opening verse of his life-account as given by the blessed poet рдЪреЗрдХреНрдХрд┐рд┤рд╛рд░реН

A translation here:  
Every part of his life is so beautifully described. When he was a young infant, he would play with the girls in his neighbourhood by kicking their toy-houses. But who then realized the divine import of his deeds? ЁЯЩВ

When рдЬреНрдЮрд╛рдирд╕рдореНрдмрдиреНрдз-рд╕реНрд╡рд╛рдореА revives the girl рдкреВрдореНрдкрд╛рд╡реИ from her ashes in an urn by the grace of рдХрдкрд╛рд▓реАрд╢реНрд╡рд░ of рдордпрд┐рд▓рд╛рдкреБрд░реА, her father asks him to accept her as his bride. But he refused, stating that he had given her life by рд╢рд┐рд╡тАЩs grace, implying that he is like the girlтАЩs father!

When рдкреВрдореНрдкрд╛рд╡реИ is revived with adolescent beauty by рд╢рд┐рд╡, all рдЬреНрдЮрд╛рдирд╕рдореНрдмрдиреНрдз could see in front of him was the boundless grace of рд╢рд┐рд╡, not the beauty of her form.

Some of the great hymns of рдЬреНрдЮрд╛рдирд╕рдореНрдмрдиреНрдз-рд╕реНрд╡рд╛рдореА

1. родро┐ро░рпБроирпАро▒рпНро▒рпБрокрпН рокродро┐роХроорпН (on greatness of bhasma/vibh┼лti) - This was sung to cure the рдкрд╛рдгреНрдбреНрдп king of fever.

2. роЪрпЖропрпНропройрпЗ родро┐ро░рпБроЖро▓ро╡ро╛ропрпН (When the рдкрд╛рдгреНрдбреНрдп king gives the green signal to his рдирд╛рд╕реНрддрд┐рдХ рдЧреБрд░реБ-s to set fire to the monastery рд╕рдореНрдмрдиреНрдзрд░реН was staying at with рд╢рд┐рд╡рднрдХреНрдд-s, the divine child then hymned these 10 verses, asking the fire to go to the king (I.e. fever).

3. роироороЪрпНроЪро┐ро╡ро╛ропрокрпН рокродро┐роХроорпН (on greatness of рдкрдЮреНрдЪрд╛рдХреНрд╖рд░ рдордиреНрддреНрд░- рди-рдордГ-рд╢рд┐-рд╡рд╛-рдп ) starts famously as тАЬроХро╛родро▓ро╛роХро┐роХрпН роХроЪро┐роирпНродрпБ роХрогрпНрогрпАро░рпН рооро▓рпНроХро┐тАЭ

4. рооро╛ройро┐ройрпН роирпЗро░рпНро╡ро┐ро┤ро┐ рооро╛родро░ро╛ропрпН (beautiful hymn)

Hymn sung by рд╕рдореНрдмрдиреНрдзрд░реН to the pious рдкрд╛рдгреНрдбреНрдп king to reassure her that nothing untoward will happen to him when рд╕реБрдиреНрджрд░реНрд╢реНрд╡рд░ is standing with him & that she need not worry, thinking him to be a defenceless child.

5. родрпЛроЯрпБроЯрпИроп роЪрпЖро╡ро┐ропройрпН (sv─Бm─лтАЩs very 1st hymn that he sang when he was 3 or 4)

Deep meaning of that hymn explained here:

6. роХрпЛро│ро▒рпБродрпН родро┐ро░рпБрокрпНрокродро┐роХроорпН


This was sung to reassure the great рдЕрдкреНрдкрд░ who sees the planetary positions & expresses his fears for the divine child who wants to leave for madurai (then under рдирд╛рд╕реНрддрд┐рдХ control).

7. рокрпЛроХрооро╛ро░рпНродрпНрод рокрпВрогрпНроорпБро▓рпИропро╛ро│рпН

A hymn to рд╢рд┐рд╡ of рдирд│реНрд│рд╛рд▒реБ; what is so special? The рдЖрд░реНрд╣рдд-s at рдорджреБрд░реИ, after failing to cure the рдкрд╛рдгреНрдбреНрдп king of fever, challenged рд╕рдореНрдмрдиреНрдзрд░реН to prove the greatness of рд╢реИрд╡рдореН by burning a leaf from his collection of verses.++

7. ContтАЩd:
This was the collection of palm-leaves that he carried along during his journey. When he opened his collection, the leaf with this verse showed up. That leaf was the one selected to go through the fire!!
8. рооро╛ро▓рпИрооро╛ро▒рпНро▒рпБрокрпН рокродро┐роХроорпН: Please see the lyrics given in the video for the verses. Please see each verse & read it from backwards, syllable by syllable. Palindromic tamizh hymn!

9. родро┐ро░рпБро╡рпЖро┤рпБроХрпВро▒рпНро▒ро┐ро░рпБроХрпНроХрпИ:

рд╕рдореНрдмрдиреНрдзтАЩs father, рд╢рд┐рд╡рдкрд╛рджрд╣реГрджрдп, had a practice of reciting every morning all the hymns his son would have composed the then. But the divine one would compose so prolifically even at a tender age. As a result, it became very difficult for the father to recite the whole collection, which was just growing day by day. So, his son composed this beautiful verse which makes numerical references as shown in the picture below:

For those who donтАЩt know tamizh, this is how the hymn тАЬlooksтАЭ like:

It is a тАЬliterary chariotтАЭ; a chariot made up of numerical references in a verse. Of course, рд╕реНрд╡рд╛рдореА is not the only one to use this style but his is unarguably one of the very earliest & arguably the earliest.

Now, his son composed this hymn so that his father will get the рдлрд▓ of reciting all the hymns of рд╕рдореНрдмрдиреНрдз with this one hymn alone. The hymn possesses a magical sense of completeness. Whether 1-2-1 or 1-2-3-4-3-2-1 or so on, it forms a complete circuit at each level.

Even today, one recites just this one hymn to attain the fruit of reciting all of the divine childтАЩs hymns. CanтАЩt resist sharing another beautiful рдЪрд┐рддреНрд░ of the poem although the words are hard to read.

The numerical references are produced forwards & backwards to build the complete chariot.

10. ро╡ро╛ро┤рпНроХ роЕроирпНродрогро░рпН ро╡ро╛ройро╡ро░рпН роЖройро┐ройроорпН

When рд╕рдореНрдмрдиреНрдзрд░реНтАЩs scroll containing a hymn of his went against the current of the рд╡реИрдЧреИ river & reached the shores safely, it was this hymn that was written there. Translation of 1st verse:

Made my day; kids singing the opening verse of рд╕рдореНрдмрдиреНрдзрд░реНтАЩs story from рдкреЖрд░рд┐рдпрдкреБрд░рд╛рдгрдореН
