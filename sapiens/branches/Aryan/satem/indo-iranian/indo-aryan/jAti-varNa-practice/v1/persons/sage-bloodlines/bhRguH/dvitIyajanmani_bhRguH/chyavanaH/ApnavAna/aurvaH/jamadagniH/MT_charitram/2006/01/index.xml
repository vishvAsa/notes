      <description>&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&#34;https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2006/01/17/the-vighnas/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We thought of the freedom of Jx and wondered what our fate might be. Our spasha reported that even before the khANDava event there was much fear that all were targets. The spasha stated that the khANDava event only took us into the center of the raNanadi. The spasha clarified that there was really no way out of it we had only two options: face the prashoSha attack of the vairis or go out to battle in khANDavaprastha. As we discussed the coming encounter with the amAtya, the fate of Jx was mentioned again. It was no better but the devas had saved him. Then the amAtya asked for a detailed account the events.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&#34;https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2006/01/08/the-signal-in-samdhyabhasha/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We invoked the wondrous yakShini ullAsamekhalA again. She appeared in&#xA;the first of her forms ‘OJ’. We asked where does the high one go? She&#xA;manifested in her second form ‘GW’. It was 10 times more dazzling than&#xA;‘OJ’. She flew over the cold northern ocean to the cold, dark of ice.&#xA;Then she flew back to the city with tall houses. We were so dazzled by&#xA;her that we felt completely speechless and humble. ullAsamekhalA raised&#xA;me to the higher plane and there we conversed about the history of&#xA;mammalian carnivores. The story unfolded before me as I humbly heard&#xA;from the great being. No one, other than the devas knew the higher&#xA;truths unfolded by the great yakShini. We felt the oneness with the true&#xA;knowledge. The yakShini also pointed to the great gandharva with blazing&#xA;jaws and a terrible club. ullAsamekhalA spoke: “you must climb the&#xA;yonder peak of the gandharva.”&lt;br&gt;&#xA;“sa eko gandharvAnAm AnandaH “&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&#34;https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2006/01/01/same-place-same-time-phase-shifted/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Phase shifted by an year we were there forced to spend time with the&#xA;wild Northerners, more precisely characterized as the fallen brahmins&#xA;and kShatriyas. Luckily for us we had our own inner circle with whom we&#xA;could explore the further mysteries of whippos and the secret&#xA;applications. We remained there like a pAshupata verily, concealing the&#xA;brahman, observing the unmatta of others, behaving like a vR^ikSha&#xA;ourselves. The secret formula goes as badhira Akrandayati.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
