## नल्लान्-चक्रवर्ती
Tirumalai Nallan Chakravarti was a sishyA of Ramanuja and is said to have converted even some hunters into Sri Vaishnavaites. These hunters were the ones who helped our Sri Ramanuja when he was in exile due to the atrocities commited by the KrimikanTa chOlan. On seeing their bhakthi when Sri Ramanuja asked them as to who taught them all these things, they replied that it was their AchArya by name Thirumalai nallAn, for which Sri Ramanuja said "nallAn enRa kALamEgham ippadi varshikkiradhE" (The dark cloud named 'nallAn' is pouring the grace and the bhakthi in a great manner so that everyone is benefitted).
