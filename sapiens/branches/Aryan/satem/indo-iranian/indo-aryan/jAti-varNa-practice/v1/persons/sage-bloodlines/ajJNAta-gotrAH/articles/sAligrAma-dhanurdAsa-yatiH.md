## parivAraH
Maternal great grandson of Karpangadu venkatacharyar swamy.

## viraktiH
Was an IT person abroad. Had 2 kids with a vaDakalai shaThamarShaNa family wife.  
Disagreement over vedAdhyayana led to break up.

## shrIranga-vAsaH
Was a cook in shrIrangam.  


## sAligrAma-vAsaH
The (relatively) young dhanurdAsa-yati (AchArya of @sankIrtaH ) started caring for the rAmAnuja shrine in sAligrAma village (R supposedly stayed there). 

Seems to have degenerated to ruins frequented by prostitutes, dogs and such. He got the villagers to agree to let him care for it, and build some 3 rooms. The land is, as per records, titled as "smashAna" (though it's an ASI recognized 1k year old site etc.). He's trying to get it separated from the cemetary (which might've been an usurpation case) so that he can build a fence.

Has managed to find a v4 (and another v1?) bhAgavata to assist in maintenance.

## AchAraH
Quite severe in his routine - lives off uncooked food for most days of the month. 

## kAlaxepaH
Still conducts online kAlaxepa and inspires shiShyas. The shiShya-s are carefully tested for AchAra over a long period of time - even with random video calls!
