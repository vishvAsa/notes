A friend somewhat childishly asked who I considered the greatest of the three matsyendra, abhinavagupta and bhAskararAya. I said we have to leave out Matsyendra because he is the beginning of the gurupa~nkti of the yuga and kulashAstra will not exist as we have it without him. However, of the other two, I chose bhAskararAya because I'm much closer to him in spirit -- he was one who penetrated both the mantrashAstra-s Agamika and naigamika and was bold in theorizing and seeing deep connections. Had he lived today, his works might have been even more dazzling.

While the brilliance of the great kashmirian exegetes abhinavagupta, kShemarAja & jayaratha thereafter is dazzling, and the diligence of the va~Nga and chera compilators is admirable, I'm always inclined to place bhAskara-rayA makhIndra above all of them.+++(4)+++ I see him as one who grasped the deep unity of the mantrashAstra. 

While one could quibble with some of his homologies he clearly had the right spirit combined with a formidable scholarship. As a thought experiment, one could imagine how much more formidable he would have been if he had been in complete possession of the Indo-European theory.

If you subscribe to nonsense like OIT then don't bother. What is meant by the IE theory is the monophyly of the IEans, the reconstruction of earlier unified stages of IE lineage (e.g. I-Ir, B-Sl etc) in terms of language & their corresponding unified religious practice and world view. IMO that would have offered ways of understanding the emergence & evolution of the mantra-shAstra as an integral aspect of the IE tradition

Further, it is not clear if he has access to all the Kashmirian and older pashchimAmnAya material -- that would have again magnified his horizon immensely. 

However, he had to contend himself with the path carved by the later day shA~NkhAyana-s and mantravAdin-s in the tradition of the parashurAma-kalpasUtra. When one has a resonance with him, one can see the unified vision in:

> कामो योनिः कमला वज्रपाणिर्  
गुहा हसा मातरिश्वाभ्रम् इन्द्रः।  
पुनर् गुहा सकला मायया च  
पुरूच्यैषा विश्व-मातादिविद्य्-ओम्॥14॥
