Rajputs from Eastern Uttar Pradesh are genetically the closest to South Indian, Bengali & Marathi Brahmins. Meanwhile, Rajputs from Madhya Pradesh are more similar to UP & Gujarati Brahmins.

It's faux similarity in a way I guess, cause all these groups have higher AASI plus similar amounts of Steppe ancestry and low to non existent Gedrosian/BMAC ancestry.
