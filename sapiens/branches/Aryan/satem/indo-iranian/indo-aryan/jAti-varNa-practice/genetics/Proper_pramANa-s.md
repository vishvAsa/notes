The above is from \[[Nature16](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v541/n7637/full/nature21347.html)\].  

- "First, a paper from 2006 is wildly out of date for this field. The methods used have been superseded. Instead of using one locus, the Y chromosome, and focusing on microsatellites (which have upsides and downsides), researchers now look at the whole genome." [RK15](http://www.unz.com/gnxp/the-aryan-invasion-was-not-fantasy/#comments)
- "Dr. Underhill says there is no comparison between the kind of data available in 2010 and now. “Then, it was like looking into a darkened room from the outside through a keyhole with a little torch in hand; you could see some corners but not all, and not the whole picture. With whole genome sequencing, we can now see nearly the entire room, in clearer light.”" [H17](http://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/how-genetics-is-settling-the-aryan-migration-debate/article19090301.ece).
