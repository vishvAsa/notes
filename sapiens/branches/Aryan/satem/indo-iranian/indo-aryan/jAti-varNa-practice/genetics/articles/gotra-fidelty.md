I recently performed my whole genome sequencing (black Friday sale $200 instead of $400). So I could find out my detailed Y-chr subclade by uploading to Yfull for another $45. I am L-Z5929, my macro-haplogroup being L-M27 or L1a which I knew from 23andMe. Another Tamil brahmin called Krishnan reached out to me on Yfull who also had his WGS done. We share a subclade L-Z5926. Our most recent common paternal ancestor is 3900 years ago, according to Yfull. He is kaundinya gotra and I am bhAradvAja.

So one of these:

1) it is L subclades that correspond to some gotras
2) Correlation between Y-haplo and gotram has not been strict since at least 3900 years ago
