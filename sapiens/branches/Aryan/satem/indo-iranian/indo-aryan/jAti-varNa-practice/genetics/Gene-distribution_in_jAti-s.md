- "Not shown in this diagram is the O3e marker that is predominantly seen in the Tibeto-Burman speaking eastern tribals (who also have some O2a), and nearly absent elsewhere."\[[MT5](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2005/12/20/socio-genetic-stratification-of-india/)\]
- "The O2a, H1, F* and H2 haplogroups are predominantly seen in the mainland tribal population and decline in the middle-lower castes and are low or almost absent in upper castes." \[[MT5](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2005/12/20/socio-genetic-stratification-of-india/)\]


## Summaries
> the steppe ancestry is ~20-30% in pakistan/punjab. 30% in brahmins in north india. 20% in brahmins in south india. 
> 
> In gangetic plain goes from 20 to 10% in peasants as u go west to east (10% in bengal).  
> In south india it's like 5% among non-brahmins.   
> ~0% in dalits in the south and some tribals. in north india lower than 10% in dalits like chamars.  
> it correlates with skin color, but imperfect, since skin color is due to only a few genes and sample variance is higher.
>
> the high genetic diversity is because indian people are a mix of VERY DIFFERENT population groups, one related to those of europe and west asia, and one distantly related to the people of eastern eurasia and australia. these lineages were separated for ~50,000 years before mixing 5,000 years ago.
> 
> the fraction of onge increases as you go east, but there is still appreciable stepple. clearly the aryans were outrunning the core post-IVC zones, and were marginally mixed with IVC. eg. bihar brahmins have way more onge than sindhis, but also 50-100% more steppe.

> Seems like all savarna castes in North-Central India have 15% Steppe ancestry at minimum.
> 
> Genetic ancestry of the traditionally non-elite Kurmi tiller caste from Uttar Pradesh. Uttar Pradesh Kurmi Russia_MLBA_Sintashta: 15.7 ± 2.28% Indus_Periphery_Gonur: 46.6 ± 3.76% Onge (AASI proxy): 37.7 ± 2.41% p-value: 0.349  
> So-called untouchables or dalits from Uttar Pradesh have about 10% Steppe ancestry as well.
> 
> In South India and Maharashtra, it seems only Brahmins (eg. Iyer, nambUtiri), CKPs and a few castes that mixed a lot with Brahmins like Nairs have 15% Steppe. The rest (eg. Bunt, Thiyya) have about 5-8% (even some Kannadiga tribals like Hakkipikkis have 5% Steppe).
> 
> You can model Nairs as approximately 50% Namboodiri and 50% Kerala/Andhra non-Brahmins.

### Maxima
> UP Brahmins have the highest Steppe ancestry in Indian subcontinent (including Afghanistan) along with some Hindu Jats/Rors. Gangetic Rajputs, Baniyas, Kayasthas etc don't have as high Steppe. This probably confirms the fact that Gangetic Brahmins are direct descendants of Painted Grey Ware Vedic Aryans, and have stayed extremley endogamous for 2500 plus years. Many Gujarati Brahmins also show similar ancestral profile though. ... Many Tiwari Brahmins from Chattisgarh have more Aryan DNA than huge bunch of Pashtuns from Afghanistan and almost double the Aryan DNA of many Persians from Iran. This is what 2500+ years of a strict caste system looks like.
