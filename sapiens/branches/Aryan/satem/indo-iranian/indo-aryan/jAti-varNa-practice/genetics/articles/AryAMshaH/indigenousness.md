Aryans are indigenous to India, and all Indians have Aryan DNA. UCs are indigenous to India. SC & OBC are genetically similar to most UCs in each region. There is little difference in them.

Most people in India are part of the same genetic cline and race. Doesn’t matter what your jati is. Some North Indian Dalits have more Aryan DNA than some SI Brahmins, so are those Dalits foreigners now?

UP Chamar (an “untouchable” caste) with 15% Aryan DNA. Same as most Persians and South Indian Brahmins. Should he go back to Central Asia?

Most STs like Austroasiatic or Tibeto-Burman tribes are foreign immigrants.
