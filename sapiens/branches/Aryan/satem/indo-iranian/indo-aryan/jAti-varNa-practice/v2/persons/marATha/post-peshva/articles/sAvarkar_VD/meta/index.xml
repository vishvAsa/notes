      <description>&lt;p&gt;Source: RA&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;While the Congress allied with the Bombay Lobby the Hindu Sanghatanists, were trying to warm up to the princes &amp;amp; feudals. The above paragraph (skipped) is from A Bunch of Thoughts written by Golwalkar, where he is defending the zamindars by saying that they shouldn&amp;rsquo;t even voluntarily give away their land in Vinoba Bhave&amp;rsquo;s Bhudan movement, because it will encourage the communists. Savarkar too glorified the martial cultures, and instead of viewing them as the upholders of the feudal order, portrayed them as brave freedom fighters who fought against foreigners. (Ref. Six Golden Epochs of Indian history). The princes too had grown resentful at the success of Congress and were willing to support anyone willing to fight the Congress, so many princes supported the Hindu Sanghatanists and later Rajaji&amp;rsquo;s Swatantrata Party.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
