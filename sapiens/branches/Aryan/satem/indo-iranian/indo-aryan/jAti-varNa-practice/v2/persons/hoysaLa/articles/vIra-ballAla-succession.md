Veera Ballaladeva was the strongest monarch in the south — his kingdom had survived two islamic invasions. He was building his country back and getting prepared to address the Islamic threat from the north — and for this, he had moved his capital temporarily to Tiruvannamalai. As a wise old man, Islamic invasions and destruction of his peers — Yadavas and Kakatiyas at the hands of mlecchas must have been a devastating event in his life. 

Recall, all three bowed to the Chalukya throne only 100 years ago. Surely, he has heard stories from his ancestors. He perhaps wondered what would have happened if the Karnata empire still held sway over dakshinapatha. Not surprisingly, we see a pan-south Indian empire established shortly after his death with the exact same emblem as the Karnata empire that fragmented a century ago!

How did this happen? What is the origin of the legendary hindu bastion of the south — the Vijayanagara empire? A thread is in order and will go against popularly believed legend. With the Islamic question looming, he had become very worried — he didn’t have a son who would carry forward his legacy. Wait a moment… but then, he had a son! Veera Virupaksha who we know took over the kingdom after him. That being so, why was he dejected and why was he praying to Arunachaleshwara, the lord of his southern capital, Tiruvannamalai, for a second son?

Unlike other kings of his time, this brave king take on the mlecchas head on and so, established a capital in the northern edge of his country and named it “Virupaksha hosapattana” — perhaps named after his very son in whom he had no faith! So, why was he asking Arunachaleshwara for a son? He wanted someone take his legacy forward and do his shraddha. Why couldn’t his son do it? What was wrong with him?

Fair questions. That leads us to a treaty concluded with Delhi Sultanat that required him to send his son to Dehli for a few years. Perhaps something happened here — his temporary conversion to Islam or maybe the mlecchas forced him to do taboo things like eating beef etc. Ballaladeva didn’t disown his son — he was very happy and organized festivities when his son returned. But then, he didn’t have the faith to pass on his legacy to this son with whom some misconduct had occurred during his stay in Delhi.

So, who else? Arunchalapuranam says that Shiva himself came in his dream in the form of a “Jangama” (Sangama, clever word play!) and agreed to be his son! Asked him to have faith and that he himself would do Ballaladeva’s shraddha. After the emperor passed away, his nephew, Harihara of the Sangama clan, who was already organizing the defenses of the newly founded “Virupaksha hosapattana” was coronated in the presence of his widow and rajaguru, Kriyashakti from the Kalamukha tradition.+++(5)+++ Gangadevi, in her Madhuravijyama seeks the blessings of guru Kriyashakti before beginning her epic poem. Further, on the same day, both Ballala’s widow and Harihara made a grant to Shringeri guru Shri Bharati teertha.

So, what of Ballala deva’s biological son? Out of respect for the great king, he continued to rule the southern portion of the empire till his death and after that, it naturally became a part of the Vijayanagara state.
