Mathur Kayasthas  
-Footprints from Kushan to Paramars-

Mathur Kayasthas likely derive their surname from geographical location of Mathura.  
Early Kayasthas of Mathura were an elite group is indicated by the fact that they donated sculptures during Kushana period.Yasa wife of a kayastha is said to have donated this sculpture .  

## Manoratha
After mention of Yasa of Kushana Period,we find mention of Mathur Kayasthas in Gwalior inscription of King Bhuvanpala 1103AD. The inscription speaks of Manoratha who was a gentleman and followed the three fold way of life.He was brilliant at arithmetic and his calibre was such that even Brihaspati couldn't praise him enough. He was confidante of the King and had total control over exchequer.

Manorathas son and grandson both built two temples for Lord Siva to show their devotion.
Eventually the Fort of Gwalior fell to Muslim invader Iltumish and Mathur Kayasthas migrated to Narwar, 50 miles southwest of Gwalior. It was a hindu state ruled by Yajvapala dynasty.

## Narwar
Two prominent families come to fore in Narwar . One whose patriarch was Alhana of Kashyap Gotra and another whose genealogy started with Syama of Harita gotra. 

Alhana ( as mentioned in Narwar inscription VS1355 )belonged to Kashyap gotra .His son Vijahada was a mantrin and proficient in Royal affairs .Vijahada's grandson was very wealthy and built temple,well and garden to increase his religious merit.

Syama Kayastha family belonged to Harita gotra. The patriarch Syama's son Bhuvanpala was so powerful as a minister that he is said to have seated on half the throne of Paramar King Bhoja 1.

Bhuvanpala's great grandson Lohata became a close associate of Chahad ,the founder of Yajvapala Kingdom.Lohata was treasurer of Chahad and was married to Dharma,daughter of Pithana . Pithana the father in law of Lohata has been identified with Pithana of Baraudi inscription. He belonged to Vatsa Gotra and was a Gaudahara kshatriya.

Matrimonial relationship between Mathur Kayastha and Kshatriyas is quite interesting.

All of this goes on to show that Mathur Kayasthas played an important role in medieval India .Gained great fame,wealth and recognition, in all produced men of great substance.
