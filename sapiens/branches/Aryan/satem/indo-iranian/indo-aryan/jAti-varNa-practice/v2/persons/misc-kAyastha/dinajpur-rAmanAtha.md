## Kāntajiu Temple of Dinajpur Kāyastha Raj

In 1704 CE, Mahārāja Prāṇanātha Rāya started the construction. After his demise in 1722, his son Rāmanātha Rāya completed it in subsequent years.

Father of Prāṇanātha, Śukadeva Ghoṣa was Dauhitra of Śrīmanta Datta; founder of this Raj

By far the finest Navaratna temple in Bengal —
Unfortunately all nine spires were destroyed in the great earthquake of 1897. But most of the intricate terracotta carvings, depicting the scenes of Rāmāyaṇa & Mahābhārata, are still intact.

The deity Kāntajī is of course Śrī Kṛṣṇa.
But unlike most other temples in Bengal, He is worshipped here as Rukmiṇīkānta (with Rukmiṇī);
not Rādhākānta.

## gaNesha
According to family history, predecessor of Śrīmanta; Viṣṇu Datta was a descendant of Rājā Gaņeśa. Several other narratives connect him to the famed ruler in different ways.

While Francis Buchanan says Viṣṇu Datta held the high post of Naib Kanungo.
