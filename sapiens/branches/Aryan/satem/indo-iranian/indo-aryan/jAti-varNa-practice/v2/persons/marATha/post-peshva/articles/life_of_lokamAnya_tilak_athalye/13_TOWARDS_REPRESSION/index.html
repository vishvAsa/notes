<p>&ldquo;Who broke the Congress at Surat ?&rdquo; In reply ^
we ask, &quot; Who wanted to go back on the
Calcutta resolutions ?&quot; &ldquo;Who hailed the Surat split
with rapture ?&rdquo; &ldquo;Who wanted to rally round the
banner of Lord Morley?&rdquo; Not the least important
question is &quot; whose conduct was unconstitutional and
un-Parliamentary ?&quot;</p>
<p>Mr. Tilak sends to the Chairman of the Congress
Reception Committee a notice of adjournment with a
constructive proposal. Writers on constitutional law
hold that &quot; a motion for adjourning the debate may be
offered at any period of the discussion. Dr. Smith,*
the great English authority on the subject remarks that
on such occasions &quot; the Chairman will feel bound to</p>
<ul>
<li>Author of Handbook 0/ Law and Practice of Public meetings.</li>
</ul>
<p>TOWARDS REPRNSSION l8l</p>
<p>put it (i.e. the motion of adjournment) to the vote.&quot;
Mr. Malvi merely * thinks &rsquo; it to be * irregular and out
of order &lsquo;. Mr. Tilak asserts his right to speak. He is
not allowed to proceed. The Chairman is anxious to
gag him. TheTresident is impatient to read his address.
Confusion drowns the rest.</p>
<p>Regarding the diplomatic hurry shown by the Con###gress authorities in declaring Dr. Ghose duly elected,
we may note that such incidents are by no means rare.
Let Dr. Smith speak : —</p>
<p>&quot; Sometimes, especially at meetings, where the Chair###man and the party appointing him are anxious to have
a certain resolution carried and wish to remove every
opportunity for opposition to it, the Chairman will in###sist upon putting it to the vote, the moment it is moved
and seconded ; and although some member claims to be
heard before the votes are completely taken, the Chair###man goes on taking the votes and then tells the member
that the question is now decided and he cannot speak
to it because it is not before the meeting. In such a
• case, the member should of course endeavour to attract
the Chairman&rsquo;s attention in a way which the latter can###not ignore, and may then proceed to speak in spite of
the Chairman.&quot;</p>
<p>Mr. Tilak&rsquo;s views on the relations between the
Moderates and the Nationalists are sound and refresh###ing. He says* : —</p>
<p>&quot; Both the Moderates and the Nationahsts must
remember that persons belonging to both the parties
are actuated by a sincere desire to promote the welfare
-of he country; and that none is deliberately working to</p>
<p>♦The Kesari,</p>
<p>tSz LOKAMANYA TDLAK</p>
<p>bring about the ruin of the country. If both parties start
mth this assumption, if both are wilhng to accept the
existence of difference of opinions as inevitable, and as
constituting a healthy sign in the body politic, there
would be less room for misunderstandings. Both the
parties should realise that only in Unity there is safety
and that this unity they have to keep in spite of acute
differences of opinion. Neither should try to stamp
out the other and both should, while exerting their
utmost to get the upper hand in the National assemblies
conducted by the united efforts of the Moderates and
the Nationalists, never abuse their supremacy by try###ing to crush or cripple their opponents in the other
party. The Moderates should remember that it
is because the New Party has come into existence
that the Bureaucracy condescends to &quot; rally &quot; themo
The Nationahsts must understand that though the
caution and hesitation of the Moderates is often galling
to them, still their influence and prestige is not to be
despised. If these are the advantages, which one gets
from the other, there are some inevitable disadvantages
also. The Nationahsts have generally to bear the
brunt of political fight, but the rewards of the political
warfare go invariably to the Moderates. By their asso###ciation with the Nationalists, the Moderates do sometime
receive official taunts and frowns. When taken to taskp
the Moderates must however poiut-black tell the autho###rities that though they differ in many important res###pects from the * Extremists *, still, so long as the latter
are willing to co-operate with them, they would not
part company. True, some of the Nationahsts have
set up &quot; Independence &quot; as the ultimate goal of theht</p>
<p>TOWARDS REPRESSION 183</p>
<p>ambition ; but even Lord Morley does not find any###thing illegal in such &quot; faiths and aspirations.&quot; True,
also that some of the Nationalists preach boycott which
is more than a boycott of British goods, still there is
nothing wrong in the Moderates co-operating to the
point both the parties are agreed. If these points are
kept in mind, the unity between the two parties will be
ever-lasting&quot; .</p>
<p>In contrast with these statesman-like utterances.lread
the following petulant and short-sighted remarks of
Dr. Rash Behari Ghose : —</p>
<p>&quot; The Extremist Party is an ominous shadow, which
has projected itself over the future fortunes of the</p>
<p>country It has no place in the pale of the</p>
<p>Congress. Secession, therefore, is the only course
open to it. (Turning to his brother Extremists, Dr.
Ghose said) you may deny it, but I fear, you are in
danger, slowly but surely of drifting into
treason. &ldquo;•!■</p>
<p>Immediately on his return to Poona from Surat, Mr.
Tilak commenced collecting funds for starting a Nation###alist Daily (Marathi). The Paper — Rashtra-Mat — came
out in June (1908) and in its very short career, justified
its existence by bravely fighting for the National cause.
About the end of February (1908) Mr. Tilak started on,
what he intended to make, a long tour throughout all</p>
<p>&ldquo;^ Undelivered Presidential Address. Since the above lines
were written. Dr. Ghose, alas, has passed away. He lived to
nnderstand and appreciate the Nationalists and to recognise
their place in the National Movement. Indeed, it may be con###fidently said that latterly, Dr. Ghose&rsquo;s agreed more with the
views of Mr, Tilak than with those of his own &quot; friend and
master&rdquo; the Hon. Sir Surendranath Banerjea.</p>
<p>184 LOKAMANYA TILAK</p>
<p>Marathi-speaking districts of the Presidency in order
to collect about five lakhs of rupees to put the Samartha
Vidyalaya, the well-known National School on a sound
basis. He went first to Sholapur and then to Barsi.
He was extremely well-received and he collected a sum
of Rs. 50,000. He had, however, to return to Bombay
to give evidence (9th March) before the Royal Com###mission of Decentrahsation. The work of the Poona
District Conference (20th, 21st, and 22nd March)
then claimed his attention. Then came the work
of organising the picketing at the liquor shops.
This movement lasted for about a month. Then he
attended the Provincial Conference at Dhulia. To top
all, came the bomb (30th April), changing the political
atmosphere in its entirety. It threw the shadow of
misfortune and failure over every public activity. The
Samartha-Vidyalaya was subsequently suppressed by
the Government (1910).</p>
<p>Mr, Tilak&rsquo;s pithy and closely-reasoned evidence before
the Decentralization Commission concluded thus : —</p>
<p>&quot; The mere shifting of the centre of power and autho###rity from one official to another is not, in my opinion
calculated to restore the feelings of cordiality between
the officers and the people, prevailing in earlier days.
English Education has created new aspirations and
ideals amongst the people and so long as these national
aspirations remain unsatisfied, it is useless to expect
that the hiatus between the officers and the people
could be removed by any scheme of official Decentraliz###ation. In is no remedy — not even a palliative against the
evil complained of, nor was it put forward by the people
or their leaders. The fluctuating wave of Decentralize</p>
<p>TOWARDS REPRESSION 185</p>
<p>-mtion may infuse more or less life in the individual
members of the Bureaucracy, but it cannot remove the
growing estrangement between the rulers and the
ruled, unless and until the people are allowed more and
more effective voice in the management of their own
affairs in an ever expansive spirit of wise liberalism and
wide sympathy, aiming at raising India to the level of
Self-Go verning countries.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Poona District Conference, which met on 20th,
2 1st and 22nd March, 1908 bespeaks the resource###fulness, patience, tact and the organizing power of Mr.
Tilak. Immediately on his return from Surat, while
the dust of controversy still darkened all quarters, he
sent round his lieutenants all over the district and
established Taluka Associations. Two months of pro###poganda work left nothing to be desired either in the
thoroughness of the preparations or in the representa###tive character of the delegates who attended the Con###ference from different parts of the district. But that
the Moderates should have, so soon after the breach at
Surat stood on the same political platform with Mr.
Tilak is as great a compliment to their good sense as
to Mr. Tilak&rsquo;s tact in managing men. Perhaps the
Moderates felt it their duty to accept what they might
have thought to be Mr. Tilak&rsquo;s challenge and so they
mustered strong. They must, however, have been
surprised to find the intellectual tenacity and political
zeal of the delegates hailing from the nooks and corners
of the district. The late Rao Bahadur Joshi, the famous
Statistician, was the President. Fourteen Resolutions
were passed. One of them appealed to the leaders of
the various parties to sink, differences and restore</p>
<p>l86 LOKAMANYA TILAK</p>
<p>unity in the National Congress. Another resolution
advocated the Swadeshi and Boycott movement ; an
attempt was made to substitute the words &quot; boycott of
foreign goods ** for the words ** the Boycott movement&quot;
but it met with a miserable failure. A resolution on
National Education was also passed and a strong Com###mittee was appointed to work it out. Most of the re###solutions were mandates to the people and not appeals
to the Government. &quot; Self-reliance, no mendicancy **
was the watch- word of this Conference. It was resol###ved to take steps to encourage sugar mdustry in Poona;.
to make an industrial survey of the district, to start at
least 25 primary schools during the course of one year,
to encourage arbitration and discourage liquor. Alto###gether a nice programme of work, unluckily required to
be totally shelved by the coming of the bomb.</p>
<p>It was a nice and most inspiring speech that Mr. Tilak
delivered in the District Conference on the &quot; Evils of
Drink.&quot; He ridiculed the idea of carrying on &ldquo;a
Temperance propaganda &quot; by means of magic lantern
performances and like otlier methods. These methods
according to him, were «!dl right in countries having the
hereditary poison of drink in their blood. But where^
as in India, morality, religion, social opinion, instinct
and heredity were strongly against the use of
liquor, picketing was the only way to rouse indivi###dual, social as well as the Abkari conscience. ^ He
wound up his speech with an impassioned appeal to the
young men sitting opposite in the gallery. The effect
was electric. A band of youths formed themselves
into a Volunteer corps and spontaneously started peaceful
picketing before the principle liquor-shops of Poona. It</p>
<p>TOWARDS REPRESSION 187</p>
<p>would be a mistake to suppose, that this movement
was merely impulsive. Years since, it had been in ex###istence ; the Swadeshi movement, which in its wider
significance was a movement for the reconstruction of
the National Life, made it powerful. Especially in
Thana, Belgaum and Ahmednagar, systematic efforts
had been made to check the evil of drink. It was,
however, reserved, for the picketng movement to make
*&rsquo; Temperance &quot; which in Indian Vernaculars always
means total abstinence, a hve issue. Within less than
a fortnight, it was estimated that the sale of liquor in
Poona City was all but stopped. It was impossible
that the keepers of the liquor shops would take this
agitation lying down. They tried their best to put
obstacles in the way of the Volunteers. But cautious,
tactful and well-disciplined that the volunteers were,
they worked in spite of rebufifs, insults and provoca###tions. The experiences of the Swadeshi picketing at
Calcutta had taught them not to court any collision
with the Police ; and in their well-meant efforts, they
could rely upon the support and advice of three differ###ent sections of people, the Nationalists, the Moderates
and Loyahsts of the type of Dr. Mann and the Rev. Mr.
MacNickel the purity of whose motives at least was sO
far as the Bureaucrats were concerned beyond question.
The Volunteers worked under the direct supervision of
the Poona Temperance Society, whose members, be###sides framing stringent rules for the observance of the
Volunteers took special care to see that those rules were
scrupulously observed. The Volunteers were selected
after careful inquiry ; the work they were set to do was
&lt;:arefully apportioned. They were strictly directed to</p>
<p>LOKAMANYA TILAK</p>
<p>preach peacef^lly and modestly to persons entering the
liquor shops. On no account were they to use intimi###dation or force. A deputation consisting of the Hon. Mr.
Gokhale, Mr. Tilak, the Rev. Mr. MacNickel and others
waited on the then Collector of Poona to discuss the
rules and it is said that in accordance with some of his
suggestions, certain changes were introduced therein ;
and still as ill-luck would have it, in spite of every care,
caution and foresight exercised, more than 40 Volun###teers out of about 150 working in the City were hauled
up before the Magistrate and convicted and fined for
having disobeyed orders of the Police. Technically
they were offenders ; for the Police had ordered them
to stop picketing, which they had refused to do.
Undoubtedly, the Policeman has got the power to
order any person to quit a place where he is standing
on a public street. But where such an order is given
tDnly to disallow a peaceful citizen from doing a peaceful
legitimate and philanthrophic duty, conscientious per###sons will feel bound to dis-obey such orders. In this con###nection, it should be remembered that in Europe and
America, pickets are allowed even to enter liquor-shops
and there do their work.</p>
<p>The movement spread like-fire in the whole of Maha###rashtra and in the enthusiasm .that it awakened, even
Swadeshi and Boycott were for a time forgotten. But
the custodians of law and order, afraid that it would
lead to disorder, took early steps to &quot; suppress picket###ing.&rdquo; At Lonavla (near Poona) the District Magistrate
issued an order (nth April 1908) under Section 144 of
the Criminal Procedure Code, enjoining people not to</p>
<p>congregate and loiter daily in the vicinity of the coun*</p>
<p>.&rsquo;((</p>
<p>TOWARDS REPRESSION iSg.</p>
<p>try liquor shops at Karla and Lonavla with the purpose
of preventing customers from entering the shops.&quot; The
Magistrate wanted to save &quot; persons lawfully resorting&quot;
to the liquor-shops from annoyance. On or about
April 17th, instructions were issued to the Poona
Police to suppress the movement.</p>
<p>On April 23rd, a huge meeting of about 12,000 persons
was held, under the Presidency of Dr. Bhandarkar to
protest against the high-handedness of the District
Magistrate and to devise means of continuing the work
thus interrupted. A deputation consisting of Dr.
Bhandarkar, Mr. Tilak, the Rev. Mr. MacNickel and
others was appointed to meet the Governor who received
members of the Deputation (In the mean-while Mr.
Tilak was arrested on June 24th, 1908) on July 6th,
1908. After expressing his general sympathy with the
Temperance Movement, His Excellency Sir George Clarke
(Now Lord Sydenham) explained the Government&rsquo;s
policy with regard to the sale of liquor, took exception
to certain statements made by the members of the
Deputation and concluded by saying that though the
rules made by the Association were unexceptionable,
still it was impossible owing to the difference in indivi###dual temperaments to expect uniform and consistent
observance of them. He reminded the deputation,
how, even at Poona, the rules failed to keep order and
how therefore, their universal application was fraught
with evil consequences. He concluded &quot; Picketing is
an interference with liberty which in Poona, certainly
would have the appearance of class legislation, that it
would in many places inevitably lead to breaches of
peace and to police prosecutions which we all wish to</p>
<p>IQO LOKAMANYA TELAK</p>
<p>avoid, that it cannot permanently promote the object
you have in view and that it may help to defeat that
object. I sincerely hope, you will not regard this as
an arbitrary decision of an alien Government which
does not sympathise with your valuable Association.*&rsquo;. .</p>
<p>A sadder commentary on the incapacity of the Bureau###cracy to understand the Indian view-point and a
stronger argument for the immediate establishment of
Swaraj can hardly be imagined.</p>
<p>While engaged in these and other activities Mr. Tilak
had not forgotten the question of the Congress-compro###mise. The first time that this problem was tackled
since the Surat solit w£is at the Provincial Conference
of United Bengal held in February 1908 at Pabna under
the Presidency of Srj. (Dr.) Rabindranath Tagore. In
this Conference, both the parties were strongly repre###sented and after full and mature consideration, the
Calcutta Resolutions on Swaraj, Swadeshi, Boycott
and National Education were passed. The resolution
on the Boycott did not speak merely of the Boycott of
British goods but referred to the Boycott Movement —
words Mr, Gokhale had taken strong objection to at
Surat — and it is remarkable that though in the Swaraj
resolution, demand was made only for Colonial Self###Govemment still, the Nationalists were allowed to bring
in a formal amendment expressive of their longing for ab###solute Independence. The harmony that prevailed bet###ween the Bengal Moderates and the Bengal Nation###alists on such heated subjects as Boycott and Self###Government was of happy augury and Mr. Tilak expect###ed the same reasonable attitude from both the parties in
the Bombay Provincial Conference that was to be held</p>
<p>TOWARDS REPRESSION I9I</p>
<p>at Dhulia, under the Presidentship of the late Mr. Daji
Abaji Khare. The Convention Committee appointed
by the Moderates at Surat was to meet at Allahabad in
the Easter Holidays ; and it was the earnest wish of
many that the Bombay Conference should be held
before the Easter. But to suit the convenience of the
President, it was decided to be held after the Easter.
At the eleventh hour, however, Mr. Khare refused to
preside, and his place was filled by the late Hon.
Mr. G. V. Joshi. Before, however, the Conference
could meet, the Convention Committee held its
sittings at Allahabad and passed certain rules and re###gulations which were not likely to commend themselves
to the Nationalists. The work of Congress compro###mise thus became more difficult than ever, but with
his usual optimism, Mr. Tilak refused to be discouraged.
The Dhulia conference commenced its sittings on April
17th. Resolutions on Swadeshi, Boycott, and National
Education were passed. To the last two Resolutions
there was in the Conference a slight opposition. The
resolution appointing a Committee to bring about Con###gress Compromise was moved by Mr. Tilak ; speaking to
this resolution he declared how suicidal it would be to
leave out of the Congress any party pledged to peaceful
and &ldquo;constitutional&rdquo; methods, only because that party
preached independence.</p>
<p>It is not impossible that the Congress Compromise
on which Mr. Tilak had set his heart, would have been
an accomplished fact long ago, had not the whole poli###tical atmosphere been suddenly changed for the worse
by the unexpected appearance of the bomb. On April
30th, a bomb intended for Mr. Kingsford, Sessions</p>
<p>192 LOKAMANYA TILAK</p>
<p>Judge at Mozufferpore struck Mrs. and Miss Kennedy
leaving them killed on the spot. This incident created
a panic, intensified by the rapid arrests of a number of
Bengali youths. The fury of the Anglo-Indian Com###munity knew no bounds and some fanatics like the
Pioneer and the Asian began to cry for blood. The
Moderates and the Loyalists were terrified and lost all
sense of proportion. The Government was panic-stri###ken. The delicate duty of warning the Government of
the dangers of repression, the Terrorists of the utter
futility of their doings and the Moderates of the neces###sity of keeping their heads cool, fell upon the &quot; Extre###mists &quot; and this duty Mr. Tilak discharged with his
usual candour. He did not &quot; speak of murders with
approval &quot; nor did he &quot; hail the advent of the bomb in
India as if something had come to India for its good.&quot;
He did not, like Mathew Arnold, refuse to call a man
murderer who &ldquo;for some great public cause, without
love or hate, austerely raised his arm against a power
exempt from common checks.&rdquo; On the contrary he
considered it to be &quot; the country&rsquo;s misfortune &quot; that the
bomb had come ; and he called upon the Government,
with all the fervour at his command to uproot this
&rsquo; poisonous tree &rsquo; by giving larger political rights to the
people. He clearly saw through the attempts made to
fasten the responsibility of such events upon the much###disliked agitator. But really speaking &quot; the ultimate
cause of terrism in Bengal must be sought in the utterly
selfish, high-handed and tyrannical policy of the Govern###ment and in the contemptuous and insulting manner
in which most official and non-official Anglo-Indians
have spoken of and treated the Bengalees. They have</p>
<p>TOWARDS REPRESSION 1 95</p>
<p>ridden rough-shod over the feelings of the Bengalees and
turned a deaf ear to their strongest and most reasonable
representations, supported by facts and figures. The
Russianization of the administration in spirit and me###thods has led to the conversion of a small section of the
people to the methods of Russian teiroism. It is sim###ply a question of action and re-action, &rsquo; Stimulus * and</p>
<ul>
<li>response &lsquo;.&quot;</li>
</ul>
<p>Mr. Tilak had nothing but contempt for those who
in their hurry to save their skin and position were osten###tatiously profuse in their condemnation of the Terro###rists. His views may be summed up in the following
words of the talented editor of the Modern Review.^
** It may be easy for arm-chair critics who are incapa###ble of risking or sacrificing anything for humanity, to
inveigh in unmeasurable terms against persons who
have made terrible mistakes, but who nevertheless were
prepared to lose all that men hold dear, for their race
and country ; — persons whose fall has been great, be###cause perhaps, equally great was their capacity for
rising to the heights of being ; but for ourselves, we
pause awe-struck in the presence of this m-ystericus
tragedy of mingled crime and stern devotion. Deplore
as we do the death of the two European women, and
strongly condemn the murderous deed, we scorn to
associate ourselves in our condolence and condemnation
with those Anglo-Indian editors and others who have
not even a word of regret to express, when brutal Anglo###Indians kill inoffensive and defenceless Indians or assault
helpless Indian women. Whatever feelirgs we express,
we must do independently and in measured terms.&quot;</p>
<ul>
<li>The Modern Review (June 1908).</li>
</ul>
<p>13</p>
<p>194 LOKAMANYA TILAK</p>
<p>On May 22nd, the following statement was issued over
the signatures of Mr. Tilak and 24 leading Nationalists
of Maharashtra : —</p>
<p>&quot; We view with deep regret the recent acts of violence
on the part of certain young men in Bengal, resulting
i» lamentable deaths.</p>
<p>&quot; We firmly believe that these regrettable occurances
are the result of prolonged and persistent disregard of
public opinion and a continued pohcy of repression
on the part of the Government, and not as alleged in
some quarters of any speeches or writings.</p>
<p>&quot; We are convinced, that the true remedy for the
present state of things, lies, not in the adoption of any
measures of repression and coercion, which must prove
futile, but in the prompt redress of popular grievances
and in making liberal concessions to the legitimate
demands and aspirations of the people in a spirit of
large-minded sympathy and far-sighted statesmanship.</p>
<p>&quot; We hold that such a pohcy of concihation will be
in harmony with the best traditions of British Rule in
India.&quot;</p>
<p>But just as Mr. Tilak and others were convinced
that the real cause of these fanatical outbursts lay in the
■unsympathetic rule of a Bureaucracy, irresponsible to
the people of this country, so was the Bureaucracy con###vinced that it was the agitators whose pernicious wri###tings and speeches had created such a tense situation.
They, therefore, set themselves to stamp out the bomb
by making penal the mere possession of chemicals re###quired for preparing bombs, by a stringent Press Act
and a vigorous hunting of * sedition.* A Press Act was
contemplated, but it saw the light of the day a couple</p>
<p>TOWARDS REPRESSION I95</p>
<p>of years later. Newspaper prosecutions commenced
right earnestly. Early in June as many as four editors
were arrested in the Bombay Presidency, om charges of
sedition. When the smaller fry was thus being disposed
of, Mr. TUak could not be ignored, and when on
June 20th, 1908, the (then) Governor of Bombay re###marked that certain persons possessing influence over
the people were exciting hatred and contempt against
the Government and that they were playing with fire
it was clearly understood that the remarks were specifi###cally meant for Mr. Tilak, who, four days later, was
arrested (June 24th, 1908.)</p>
