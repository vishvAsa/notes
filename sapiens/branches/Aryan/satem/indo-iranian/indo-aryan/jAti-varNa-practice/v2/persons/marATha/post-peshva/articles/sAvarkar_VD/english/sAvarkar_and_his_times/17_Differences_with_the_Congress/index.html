Owing to their stupendous ignorance of and a wrong approach to the Moslem problem, the Congress leaders betrayed a woeful lack of self-confidence in the conduct of the national struggle. This ultimately discredited the prestige and patriotism of the Hindus, undermined the pov/er of the national majority, and mortgaged the destiny of the country to the anti-national forces.
Savarkar’s insight perceived this growing danger from the designs of the awakened Muslim mind. He knew that Muslim opposition to the national aspirations was not confined to a song here or a piece of music there. According to him there was a fundamental difference in their outlook on life and literature and in their aspirations for the governance of Hindusthan as a nation. Therefore the first thing Savarkar did was to strive to bring into operation the Federal part of the 1935 Act, and frustrate the Muslim designs. Though the Federal part of this Act, he said, handed over no real power especially in the matter of Military and Foreign policy to the representatives of the people, it offered an opportunity for the realization of national unification of the States and other parts under the British occupation into an organized and corporate whole. But partly being not sure of the party domination at the Centre, and partly being afraid of the opposition led in the field by the youthful left-wing forged by President Subhas Bose, the Congress High Command bypassed the issue of Federation, Not because there was no promise for immediate independence that the Congress did not accept the Federation. The Congress could have fought here, too, to undo the unsatisfactory portion of the Federation.">

<p>Owing to their stupendous ignorance of and a wrong
approach to the Moslem problem, the Congress leaders
betrayed a woeful lack of self-confidence in the conduct of
the national struggle. This ultimately discredited the prestige
and patriotism of the Hindus, undermined the pov/er of the
national majority, and mortgaged the destiny of the country
to the anti-national forces.</p>
<p>Savarkar’s insight perceived this growing danger from the
designs of the awakened Muslim mind. He knew that Muslim
opposition to the national aspirations was not confined to a
song here or a piece of music there. According to him there
was a fundamental difference in their outlook on life and
literature and in their aspirations for the governance of
Hindusthan as a nation. Therefore the first thing Savarkar
did was to strive to bring into operation the Federal part of
the 1935 Act, and frustrate the Muslim designs. Though the
Federal part of this Act, he said, handed over no real power
especially in the matter of Military and Foreign policy to the
representatives of the people, it offered an opportunity for the
realization of national unification of the States and other
parts under the British occupation into an organized and
corporate whole. But partly being not sure of the party
domination at the Centre, and partly being afraid of the
opposition led in the field by the youthful left-wing forged by
President Subhas Bose, the Congress High Command
bypassed the issue of Federation, Not because there was no
promise for immediate independence that the Congress did
not accept the Federation. The Congress could have fought
here, too, to undo the unsatisfactory portion of the Federation.</p>
<p>A shrewd and practical politician as he was, Mr. Jinnah
feared that if the Federation came into operation, it would
weld India into a unified and united State under which the</p>
<p>252 SAVARKAH AND HIS TIMES</p>
<p>separatist designs of the Muslims would be totally crushed.
Hence he condemned the Federation Scheme as ‘thoroughly
rotten, fundamentally bad and totally unacceptable ’ &rsquo; to the
Muslims. In fact, this fear of Jinnah fully justified Savarkar,
Bhai Parmananda and Dr. Moonje in their pro-Federation
stand which was conducive to national solidarity. Had the
Congre.ss accepted the Federal part of the Government of
India Act of 1935, it would have made the Central Government
an irresistible and irremovable power that would have been
the death-warrant of the separatist Muslim ambitions, and
would have muzzled the four or five Muslim-ruled rebellious
provinces into complete subordination. But short-sighted,
irrational and irresolute as its stand was, the Congre.ss lost
a unique opportunity to consolidate and strengthen the
integrity of India.</p>
<p>About this time World War II broke out. The Federation
Scheme was suspended. The Congress party gave up power
in all seven provinces, went into wilderness demanding the
war and peace aims of the British Government, and launched
an individual Civil Disobedience Movement. Mr. Jinnah
rejoiced at this and declared in his Presidential Address at
the Annual Session of the Muslim League at Madras with
great joy ; “ After the war had broken out the first good news,
along with other bad news that we got, was the declaration
of the Viceroy that His Majesty’s Government are pleased to
suspend the All-India Federation Scheme embodied in the
Government of India Act, 1935 (cheers). . . . India’s future
constitution will be considered de novo, including the policy
and the plan on which the Government of India Act, 1935, was
based. That was no doubt a great relief, because it was
against that part of the Act that Muslim India was fighting
from the very commencement.” ”</p>
<p>When the Congressmen gave up ministries, the Legislatures
of the Muslim majority provinces had hardly any Muslim
League members. But thanks to the jail-seeking policy of the
Congress party, Mr. Jinnah was given sufficient time to
consolidate his position and with what little strength he had
in those provinces at his command, he soon established League</p>

</ul>
<p>DIFFERENCES WITH THE CONGRESS 253</p>
<p>Ministries in five provinces. These Ministries proved a
stepping-stone to his future plans nd policies. The end of the
rule of the Congress party in thi . even provinces wa.s hailed
by Muslims all over India as tl * Jay of Deliverance. Their
Pirpur Committee’s report lev*, led heinous charges against
the Congress party. The Congress leaders on their part
produced certificates of their • conduct from the British
Governors. On top of it all, dr Jinnah continually voiced
that “ A parliamentary system ba^ed on the majority principle
must inevitably mean the rule of the major nation. . . .
Western Democracy was totally unsuited for India and
its imposition would be resisted by the Mussalmans.” ‘ The
Mu-slims, Jinnah said, should be treated as a separate nation
and not a minority, otherwise there would be irretrievable
disaster to the country.</p>
<p>The Congress leaders thought that Jinnah was the voice
of the Muslim classes and not of the Muslim masses. The
Congress party and Pandit Nehru particulcirly stai&rsquo;ted Muslim
mass-contact drive to attract Muslim masses to the Congress.
As this reading of the MusUm mind was historically untrue,
the Muslim contact movement of Nehru prov^ to be not only
a dismal failure, but also proved to be a Muslim conflict move-
ment. Mr. Jinnah had made no secret of his burning hatred
for the concept of the Constituent Assembly of an all-India
character. To the Muslims he said : “ We do not want in any
circumstances a constitution of an all-India character with one
Government at the centre. &hellip; If we once agree to that, let
me tell you, the Muslims will be absolutely wiped out of
existence.” -</p>
<p>On September 1, 1939, Britain declared War on Germany
‘ to save the whole world from the pestilence of Nazi tyranny
and in defence of all that was sacred to man.’ H.E. the
Marquis of Linlithgow, the Viceroy of India, proclaimed that
India was at war with Germany and expressed that India
would fight for human freedom as against the rule of force.
Soon after this Gandhiji told the Viceroy that he was not
thinking of the deliverance of India, and he broke down before</p>

<p>254 SAVARKAR AND HIS TIMES</p>
<p>the Viceroy as he pictured before himself the House of
Parliament and the Westminster Abbey and their possible
destruction. Pandit Noliru on his return journey from China
issued a statement at Rangoon declaring that India had no
desire to take advantage of Britain’s difficulties and was not
out to bargain.</p>
<p>The Liberals thought it disastrous if India were to offer help
subject to conditions. The Parsees offered prayers and H.H.
the Aga Khan appealed for heartfelt, loyal and unstinted
service to the cause of the British Empire. Dr. Ambedkar
lamented that India had no voice in her foreign policy in
declaring war and in the making of peace. He further said
that India should reuuiin witiiin the Bi itish Commonwealth of
Nations and strive to achieve the status of equal partnership
therein. He, too, appealed to Government to take steps to
prepare Indians for defending their country. The Muslim
League offered conditional support asking the British Govern-
ment to create a sense of security and satisfaction amongst
the Mussalmans, and curiously enough urged His Majesty’s
Government to satisfy the Arab national demands.</p>
<p>As President, of the Hindu Mahasabha, Savarkar declared
that Britain’s claim that she entered war to Scifeguard the vital
principles affecting human freedom was a political stunt so
long as she continued to hold India in pohtical bondage. In
his interview, on October 9, 1939, he plainly told the Viceroy
at Delhi that none of the belligerent powers in Europe
including Poland and, above all, Russia was actuated by any
moral or human principle of Democracy, or the liberties of
the down-trodden or political justice and equality beyond
what suited the self-interests of the respective nations and
states.</p>
<p>However, Savarkar said that the Hindu Mahasabha felt
itself concerned with the issues at stake in the war so far as
they were hkely to affect the safety and interests of the Hindu
Nation. He, therefore, appealed to the British Government
to make an unambiguous declaration of gi-anting Hindusthan
the status of a self-govez’ning Dominion as an immediate step
leading towards the final goal of complete independence and
to introduce immediately responsible Government at the
Centre based on the democratic principle of ‘ one man one</p>
<p>differences with the congress 255</p>
<p>.vote/ He urged the Viceroy to guard India’s Western
Frontiers by Hindu forces, to introduce compulsory military
training in High Schools and Colleges throughout India (as in
Englar d), to start and encourage Rifle Classes, to expand the
Indian Territorial Force, to inspire the people of India to feel
instinctively that the Indian Army was the Army of the people
of India and not of Britain, and he appealed to the British
Government not to use Indian forces outside India proper.
Savarkar called upon Capital and Labour in the countiy to
utilize thvT unique opportunity of the European War to capture
the markets by working to •,&lsquo;apacity all the existing industries
and by starting new ones and replacing at full speed all foreign
articles by Swadeshi.'^</p>
<p>But the main object of Savarkar ’s war policy was to make
Hindus re-animated and re-born into a martial race. It w&rsquo;as
in this belief that, like Tilak, he had supported from the
cellular jail in the Andamans the militarization movement
during World War I, and was delighted to hear that his
counti-ymen were allowed to go to Europe in thousands to
light against the best military power in the world. In his
youth, he wrote from London in 1906 quoting from the
Spectator that soldiers could be thoroughly trained in six
months, and casting a longing look at the then Boy Army of
Britain, he felt that every Indian youth must learn Drill,
Riding and Shooting. Long ago, in 1906 Savarkar observed
in one of his letters from London that a nation’s existence
depended upon its political independence. If the nation
enjoyed independence, it could make progress. That indepen-
dence in its turn depended upon the mental and military
training the nation imparted to its youths. That was why
after his release the first slogan he raised was, “ Down with
the Arms Act, Start Rifle Classes.” Thus it can be seen from
this that his militarization policy was consistent during both
the World Wars.</p>
<p>Savarkar was the only all-India leader, and the Hindu
Mahasabha was the only political party in India that launched
an intense propaganda for the militarization of the Hindus
and for the industrialization of the country with pure patriotic
and political objects during World War H. Liong before the</p>
<p>‘ Savarkar, Whirlwind Propaganda, pp. 146-68.</p>
<p>256 SAVABKAB AND HIS TIMES</p>
<p>outbreak of World War n Savarkar had seized every .
opportunity of bringing to the notice of the nation the woeful
want of the military strength of the Hindus whenever he
spoke in schools and colleges and even at literary conferences.</p>
<p>Savarkar stressed the need for Hindu militarization in his
speeches in Poona, Wardha, Chalisgaon, Delhi, Nagar, Lahore,
Hyderabad (Sind) , Sukkar and during the war years he sent
forth appeal upon appeal and gave an impetus to the move-
ment, explaining liis militarization policy at Meerut, Salem,
Changanaeheri, at Calcutta in the Ashutosh Hall and Scottish
College and at Sangli in the Willingdon College. In one of
his speeches he said : Today it may well appear that these
men in the armed forces are mere slaves in the pay of a foreign
Government ; but there can be no doubt that when tlie crucial
moment comes, they will prove themselves real patriots and
staunch Hindus.” While addressing the students of the
Scottish College, Calcutta, he said : “ Since the days of our
First War of Independence in 1857, it has been the policy of
the British Government to keep the army out of politics. Our
policy against this should be to carry politics into the army
by all possible means and once we succeed in this, the battle
of freedom will be won.” On another occasion he said :</p>
<p>“ Forces beyond their control have compelled the British
Government to trust you with arms and ammimition.
Formerly youths had to rot in cells for being in possession of
pistols, but today the Britishers are placing rifles, guns,
cannons, and machine-guns in your hands. Get fully trained
as soldiers and conunanders. Get thousands of mechanics
trained into technical experts in building .shipyards, aero-
planes, guns and ammunition factories. At another meeting
he said : “ Why not co-operate when you are gaining ? Did
you not flout the wily expectation of Lord Macaulay ? Then
why not welcome this unique opportunity for our own good ?
You know your enemies. I ask you to join the Army and
wield the guns and turn them to the cause of freedom. I tell
you this as plainly as I told the Viceroy himself about it. Do
not worry about the bonds and agreements. The reverse of
those scraps is blank. You can write new bonds and new
agreements on it when the time comes. Mind, Swaraj will never
come to you, although you cover the whole earth with paper</p>
<p>differences with the congress 257</p>
<p>resolutions. But if you pass resolutions with rifles on your
shoulders, you will attain it.”</p>
<p>Till the day of Savarkar^s whirlwind propaganda for Hindu
militarization, military career was the monopoly of the
Muslims, who formed the three-fourths of the Indian Army.
The realist in Savarkar sensed the danger of the Muslim
preponderance in the army in case of internal anarchy and
external pressure. With that md in view Savarkar preached
militarizati m sc that when ae proper time came for the
British to quit India, Free 1 li i could stand erect with its
national army. The editors of Lie so-called nationalist papers
that throve on military contracts and military advertisements
of the foreign Government whom they asked to quit, basely
enough decried the soldiers as hirelings ; their leaders
described the soldiers as “ rice soldiers,” their partymen
stigmatized them as mercenaries, and the meanest born
amongst them called Savarkar &rsquo; a recruit hero The worst
of it was that those very journalists throve on papers, whose
owners throve on Government contracts ; those very leaders
whose relatives and friends made skyhigh profits out of
military contracts ; those very persons who paid all sorts of
taxes and co-operated with the British Government in
conducting the railways and all other departments producing
war materials with selfish motives and for paltry things and
those followers of Gandhiji whose Gandhi Seva Sangh
supplied the military with blankets, were the persons who
ignobly attacked now and then Savarkar, who never asked his
countrymen to contribute a pie to the war fund and whose
propaganda for the Hindu militarization emanated from his
selfless, patriotic, and far-sighted policy and anxiety for the
welfare of India. What a paradox ! What a low level a slave
country’s reason descends to ! In its degraded conditions it
often curses the selfless as selfish.</p>
<p>Despite these curses, Savarkar vigorously carried on his
propaganda. What of Gandhi-brand jail-seekers, some of
Savai’kar’s flamboyant lieutenants, too, at first could make
neither head nor tail of his militarization policy, and were
sceptical about it. No wonder then that men who posed as
radicals and were outside Hindu Mahasabha looked askance</p>
<p>17</p>
<p>258 SAVARKAR AND HIS TIMES</p>
<p>at this policy. When Savarkar thundered from the Presi-
dential Chair at the Annual Session of the Maharashtra
Marathi Literary Conference in Bombay in January 1938,
asking the delegates to abandon their pens in favour of guns
the wordy parrots of progress grew restless at the re-appear-
ance of Shivaji, who wanted to give them arms to turn them
to the cause of freedom. Savarkar shouted in his Presidential
Address to the Literary Conference : “ The absence of poetry^
and poets, novels and novelists would not be felt during the
coming decade. Austria and China suffered not because they
lacked good literature, but because they lacked military
power. Did you not hear, O learned men, and scholars, the
last pathetic shriek of the President of Austria ? He said,
‘ We yield under German bayonets’ and not under German
sonnets.”</p>
<p>Savarkar further said : ‘‘ If literature is a part of the
national life, its primary aim ought to be the .security of
national life. I absolutely admire the advocates of the
principle of “ Art for Art’s sake.” But when a theatre is
ablaze, it is the duty of the true worshipper of Art to rush
out to extinguish the gathering flames. What worth is litera-
ture, then, if a whole nation is writhing with pain under the
oppressor’s heel ? ” Savarkar went on : “ Did you forget the
fate of Nalanda and Takshashila, the seats of leaiming, and
other gi’eat libraries that were turned into smouldering
ruins ? &hellip; It was the triumphant sword of Shivaji that made
Maharashtra safe for poets and philosophers.” He concluded
his famous Presidential Address at this Literary Conference :
“ I say, therefore, with all the emphasis at my command that
the crying need of our times is not men of letters, but soldiers.
It does not matter even if the whole decade is barren in respect
of literature. Let there not be a song sung, or a sonnet
composed. But let the streets resotmd with the thud of the
feet of thousands of soldiers marching with modern rifles on
their shoulders. A love song here, and a love story there,
may come in as a diversion. We know even Napoleon would
relax on occasions. Having brought his enemies to their
knees, Bajirao I also enjoyed the prattle of love. But it gives
me terrible pain to see my country reduced to the
Brahmavarta of Bajirao II. My heart breaks with anguish</p>
<p>DIFFEBENCES WITH THE CONGRESS 259</p>
<p>when I St &rsquo; the vapid emasculated young faces engrossed in
love prattles. So my message to you, literary men, is that
you should abandon your pens in favour of guns ; for
literature can never flourish in a slave country. It has been
well said that pursuit of science is possible only in a free
nation protected by the power of arms.”</p>
<p>Independently and in honourable co-operation with the
Government the Hindu Mahasabha workers and leaders gave
an impetus to the Hindu ^’’ilitarization movement through the
Hindu Mahasabha paper? they had at their command, from
the platform and through the Militarization Boards which they
had established independently of Government recruiting
machinery. The effect of this intense propaganda was seen
everywhere. The Muslim preponderance was effectively
checkmated and brought down and the percentage of the
Hindus in the army went as high up as seventy.</p>
<p>So powerful was the effect of this propaganda that
Sir Ziauddin Alimed, Vice-Chancellor of the Aligarh Muslim
University, in a speech at Poona raised an alarm at the
increasing number of Hindus enlisting daily in the Land,
Navy and Air Forces thereby reducing the percentage of
Muslims in the fighting Forces. The Eastern Times, a
prominent Muslim League paper, too, raised an outcry against
the march stolen upon the Muslim monopoly and wrote :
“ The Hindu Mahasabha also has agitated strongly for
militarization of the Hindus as a great opportunity and with
the active co-operation of the Government, has met with
astonishing success.” ^</p>
<p>The Muslims and the British Government knew well what
Savarkar’s militarization movement stood for. It aimed at
carrying politics into the military ranks of the Indian Army,
and winning over the Army to the side of revolution for the
final overthrow of the British yoke. It was, indeed, the
military movement of Shahaji to facilitate the mission of his
son, Shivaji, for the attainment of Swaraj. Every British
statesman knew what Savarkar aimed at. Writing in Great
Britain and the East in January 1943, Sir Alfred Watson,
former editor of the Statesman, Calcutta, Sciid : “In his belief
of dictatorship, Nehru has a dangerous rival in Savarkar, who</p>
<p>^ Quoted by Bhide Guruji in From Quit India to Split India.</p>
<p>260 SAVARKAR AMD HIS TIMSS</p>
<p>does not hide his aspiration to rule under any veil of anony-
mity but publicly proclaims it as the leader of the Hindu
Sabha.” Sir Alfred proceeds : “ Savarkar claims domination
on the democratic basis of counting heads. For that domina-
tion he is prepared to fight and loudly demands that in
recruiting for armies in India, the present rulers shall elect
a majority of Hindus so that he may have an instrument to
enforce his will when the British rule is finally abandoned.
If it ever comes to a tussle between Nehru and Savarkar, as
seems inevitable, there is little doubt who will win.’’ Except
for the reference to dictatorship, Watson’s remarks are quite
pertinent.</p>
<p>It is well known that Deshgaurav Subhas Bose cherished
a loving admiration for Savarkar, and showed reverential
respect for him whenever he visited Savarkar, the Prince of
Indian revolutionaries. It is also an open secret now that
Subhas, the devotee of Shivaji and his politics, had discussed
the Indian political and international situation respecting
World War II with Savarkar some months before his dramatic
escape from India in January 1941. In the course of the
discussion Savarkar, the Indian Mazzini, inspired Subhas Bose,
the Indian Garibaldi, with the idea of an armed Revolution
from outside in order to intensify the struggle for Freedom.
The born general in Subhas took the cue, and played the role
of the Indian Garibaldi, rightly called the Netaji of the Indian
National Army, which was founded by Ras Behari Bose in
the Elast. A world-famous veteran revolutionary and a
man of great mental force and a powerful pen, Ras Behari
Bose, who was the guide and sole adviser of the Azad Hind
Government of Subhas Bose, was in correspondence with
Savarkar till the outbreak of World War II, was President of
the Japan Hindu Sabha, and had immensely contributed
through the Indian League of Independence to the forces of
the Indian Freedom Movement outside India. Netaji Subhas,
the I.N.A. and India owe a debt of deep gratitude to Ras
Behari Bose, the great figure of Indian Revolution.</p>
<p>The leader and the Founder of the I.N.A. both addressed
special messages to Savarkar over the Azad Hind Radio. On
one of such occasions Netaji Bose gave a broadcast on Jime
25, 1944, at night over the Singapore Radio and said : “ When</p>

Bombay (1^40)</p>

<p>At the time of the Cripps
Mission, the Mahasahha

gress delegation</p>
<p>DIFFERENCES WITH THE CONGRESS 261</p>
<p>due to misguided political whims and lack of vision almost all
the leaders of the Congress party are decrying all the soldiers
in the Indian Army as mercenaries, it is heartening to know
that Veer Savarkar is fearlessly exhorting the youths of India
to enlist in the Armed Forces. These enlisted youths them-
selves provide us with trained men from which we draw the
soldiers of our Indian National Army.”</p>
<p>Ras Behari Bose said in his Radio talk addressed to
Savarkar : “ In saluting you I have the joy of doing my duty
towards one of my elderly comrades-in-arms. In saluting
you, I am saluting the symbol of sacrifice itself.” Paying
homage to Savarkar’s unexampled sacrifice, untold sufferings
and matchless courage, he further said : “ I can see God’s
divine hand clearly behind your unconditional release. You
have once more proved your real greatness by propagating
the theme that our politics must never depend upon the
foreign politics of others. England’s enemy must be our
friend.” * Ras Behari concluded with Bande Mataram,
reiterating his belief that Savarkar’s leadership was the
greatest hope inside India. Is any further evidence necessary
to prove that the very I.N.A. movement, which Savarkar’s
opponents exploited, was the outcome of his ideology, politics
and his great book on ‘ 1857 ’, which provided the I.N.A. with
slogans, battle cries, and vision, and inspired them to fight the
battle of freedom ?</p>
<p>II</p>
<p>Savarkar’s main appeal to the Hindus was that they should
elect only those Hindus, who could act openly, publicly and
boldly as advocates of the Hindu Nation. The policy of the
Congress party in power and in politics was entirely and
grossly pro-Muslim. It encouraged the Muslims to be more
and more communal, fanatical and overbearing. The actions
of the Congress party were more anti-Hindu than their policy
on paper, and they trampled upon even the most legitimate
national claims and interests of the Hindus. One Congress
Ministry asked the Hindus not to play any music whatsoever
during the Moharam days. The Congress mutilated the Bande</p>
<p>^Ras Behari Bose’s message to Savarkar quoted in Indian Independ-
ence League’s Publication.</p>
<p>262 SAVARKAR AND HIS TIMES</p>
<p>Mataram cowardly. In their zest to plead that their natio-
nalism was above suspicion, they vued with one another to
prove to the Muslims that the Congressite Ministries had
always sacrificed Hindu interests, pandered to the Muslim
prejudices and loaded the latter with weightages, posts and
positions at the cost of the interests of the national majority.
But the more the Congress fawned, the more the Muslims
pretended to be oppressed and grew more fanatic.</p>
<p>Savarkar therefore unscathingly attacked this unjust and
unpatriotic, servile, senile and placating attitude on the part
of Congressmen. To Savarkar trampling the legitimate and
just rights of the national majority and favouring others with
undue weightages was perverse communalism, false and
destructive nationalism. Not that he was not for a fair
compromise with the Muslims on a true national basis. He
had appreciated the right step taken by Sir Sikandar Hyat
Khan, the Premier of the Punjab, in regard to the Shahid
Gunj affair and said that it was wise for them all to bury the
hatchet. Savarkar publicly appreciated the benevolent
gestures shown by the Shias in Lucknow regarding the
slaughter of cows and the playing of Music on public roads ;
and expressed the hope that if all non-Hindus would adopt
such an honourable, radical and accommodating formula of
unity, that kind of mutual co-operation would develop into a
common nationality, and common national State cemented
with patriotic ties.</p>
<p>But Savarkar never tolerated any unjust or unpatriotic
demand on the part of the minorities made overtly or covertly.
When the Azad Muslim Conference, held at Delhi in April
1940, opposed the proposal of the vivisection of India, but
resolved that the question of the nature and number of the
safeguards must be dictated by the minorities themselves,
Savarkar appreciated the first part, but denounced the latter
part of the resolution as a demand for the pound of flesh.
Savarkar believed that patriots fight for their Motherland they
love as patriots, and not as mercenaries demanding their
pound of flesh. When Sri Rajagopalachari came out with his
sporting offer promising the Muslim League Pakistan if they
joined the National Government, Savarkar replied indignantly
that it was curious to see that “ even the Congressite leaders</p>
<p>DIFFERENCES WITH THE CONGRESS 263</p>
<p>like Sri Rajaji should fail to perceive that the two terms
‘ Pakistan ’ and an ‘ Indian National Government ’ were in
themselves self-contradictory and self-destructive and how
typical it was of the Congress! te conception of ‘ National
Unity ’ that such eminent Congress leaders like Rajaji should
have given an open assurance to the Muslims regarding
Pakistan long before the British Government even dared to
do so. The ‘ sportive offers ’ of Sri Rajagopalachari were
becoming as much a pub] ; nuisance as the ‘ Inner Voices ’ of
Gandhiji were wont to be . '</p>
<p>Not less infuriated was Savarkar by an article of Gandhiji
in the Harijan dated the 13th October 1940, wherein Gandliiji
stated that in case the British power was overthrown as a
result of the war and an internal anarchy set in, “ the strongest
power in the land would hold sw’ay over all India and this may
be Hyderabad for aught I know. All other big and petty
chiefs will ultimately succumb to the strongest power of the
Nizam who will be the emperor of India.” Gandhiji also said
in the article : “ If you ask me in advance, I would face
anarchy to foreign orderly rule whether British or any other.
I would unhesitatingly plump for anarchy, say, the rule of the
Nizam supported by the chiefs becoming feudatory to him
or supported by the border Muslim tribes. In my estimation,
it will be cent per cent domestic. It will be Home Rule,
though far, far from self-rule or Swaraj.”</p>
<p>Savarkar replied ^ that Gandhiji knew as little of Indian
History as of Hebrew and stated that though the rule of an
Allauddin or an Aurangzeb was also a cent per cent domestic
rule, the Hindus detested it as veritable hell and added that
any rule of Muslims in future would be similarly hated and
overthrown by a new Shivaji, a Bajirao or a Ranjit. As for
the Nizam, Savarkar reminded him of the fate of King
Amanulla of Afghanistan. How anti-democratic and politically
false was the spirit of Gandhiji ’s article was well demonstrated
eight years later by his disciples, Nehru and Patel, who
attacked Hyderabad State and smashed the Nizam’s ambitious
role and his tyrannical un-domestic rule, vindicating the
correct stand taken by Savarkar in regard to the Hyderabad</p>
<p>1 Savarkar, Whirlwind Propaganda, pp. 239-58.</p>
<p>264 SAVARKAH AND HIS TIMES</p>
<p>State in 1939 when he challenged the Nizam’s misrule and
suzerainty.</p>
<p>in</p>
<p>Another point of difference with the Congress party was the
attitude of the latter to the Census. Savarkar believed then
that for at least ten years to come, all constitutional progress
and matters regarding public services, representation in
legislatures, etc. would necessarily be indexed or determined
by the figures and information registered in the Census of
1941. He, therefore, condemned the senseless policy of the
Congress party in boycotting the Census and said that the
Congress policy would hit the Hindus hard.</p>
<p>The numerical strength recorded in the Census of 1941 in
respect of the Hindus and Muslims was going to affect political
discussions in India as had the Census of 1931 affected the Act
of 1935. On the eve of the Census of 1941 Savarkai’ issued a
fervent public appeal to all Hindus including the Bhils
Santhals and all Animists to get themselves correctly
enumerated. Savarkar announced : “ Hindus, wake up ; the
hour of the Census strikes.” With a great hope and sense of
duty, he issued instructions to all District and Provincial
Hindu Sabhas to co-operate with the Census authorities, to
watch vigilantly the operation, approach the authorities
and secure an assurance from Government that Muslim
women’s number would be scrutinized by Christian and
Anglo-Indian lady Supervisors. In a special appeal, Savarkar
exhorted the Arya Samajists, Lingayats, Jains and Sikhs that
they might show their religion as Vaidic, Lingayat, Jain, Sikh,
but they should at least see that they were recorded as Arya
(Hindu) , Lingayat (Hindu), Jain (Hindu) , and Sikh (Hindu)
as their religions were of Indian origin, and as they regarded
India as their Fatherland and Holyland.</p>
<p>The Congressmen boycotted the Census as they did in 1921
and 1931 and the General Secretary of the Congress, Sri J. B.
Kripalani, isisued a statement on the eve of the Census of 1941
to the effect that the Congress refused to have anytliing to do
with the Census as it was a communal question. Savarkar
retorted that if it was so, how did the Congress beg for votes</p>
<p>DIFFERENCES WITH THE CONGRESS 265</p>
<p>at the doors of the communal electorates at the time of
elections ? Not only that, they even filled in their own castes
and religion in the nomination papers. Moreover, it was very
strange that these very Congressmen gave recognition to the
numerical strength of the Muslims while deciding the political
questions of India.</p>
<p>The Congress-minded Hindus respected the Congress
mandate and suffered terribly. No wonder then that the
Census, which showed T^-ndus to form .13 per cent in the
Punjab in 1881, showed tv. ir percentage In be 49. in 1921, 48 in
1931 and 47 in 1941 and simultaneously recorded a rise in the
population of the Muslims during ilie periods from 47 per
cent to 53 in the Punjab. In Assam, thirty years ago, the
Muslim percentage was 26 ; in 1931 it rose to 31 and in 1941
to 33.7 ; and Bengal, which had already suffered a great loss
in the numei-ical strength of the Hindus in the Census on the
previous two occasions and had reaped the fruits in the form
of the Communal Award, was at last declared in 1941 a
Muslim majority province. What the incorrect Census had
done to the Bengal Hindus was the result of the criminal
negligence of their top-most Hindu leaders, foremost news-
papers and illustrious personedities towards the solidarity and
correct recording of the Hindu population under the ruinous
influence of the Congress. The Modern Reinew in its issues
of June and November 1941 disclosed the mischief played by
the Bengal Muslim League Ministry in the Census affair,
avowing that the Muslims were not in a majority in Bengal
and that many Hindus especially the tribesmen numbering
about 14 per cent remained unenumerated.</p>
<p>Students of history and politics may note that these very
Congressmen who boycotted the Census of 1931 took the
figures of the Muslim population as correct while discussing
and determining the question of communal weightages, etc. in
1931. It was they who boycotted the Census of 1941 and yet
again conducted later on their negotiations with Jinnah and
the British Cabinet Mission for determining the issue of
Pakistan on the basis of these very census figures the
procedure and reliability of which was so doubtful !</p>
<p>266</p>
<p>SAVARKAR AND HIS TIMES</p>
<p>IV</p>
<p>Two guiding principles inspired Savarkar through his
political career ; they were the Independence and the Indivisi-
bility of India. These were the articles of faith with Savarkar
and the Hindu Mahasabha. To Savarkar from the Indus to the
Seas, India was one and indivisible. In his Presidential
Address at the Hindu Mahasabha Session at Ahmedabad in
1937, he stated that the very words, Portuguese India and
French India sounded preposterous and insulting to us, and
declared that the Hindusthan of tomorrow must be one and
indivisible, not only a united, but a Unitarian nation from
Kaslimir to Rameshwar, from Sind to Assam. He believed
that the Independence of India was in sight ; but he sensed the
danger to the integrity of India from the vacillating, servile,
deceptive, and short-sighted lead and policy of the Congress
in respect of the Blank Cheque offers, the Communal Award,
the Simon Commission, the Census, the National Script, the
Lingua Franca and the National Anthem.</p>
<p>And as foretold by Savarkar the anti-national forces through
the Muslim League came out with a demand for dividing India
into sej&gt;arate independent States, and the time for struggling
against and suppressing the forces of vivisection came. The
Muslim League, at its Lahore Session in 1940, declared “ that
the areas in which the Muslims are numerically in a majority
as in the North-Western and Eastern Zones of India should
be grouped to constitute ‘ Independent States in which the
constituent units shall be autonomous and sovereign The
Congress which had till then capitulated to the Muslim League
in its communal demands was rightly apprehended by
Savarkar to grant the demand for Pakistan. He, therefore,
declared that a vote for the Congress was a vote for Pakistan
and sounded a warning to the whole nation in April 1940 :</p>
<p>“ A number of Congress leaders of eminence are very likely
to go a long way in acquiescing even in this notorious demand
of the Muslims to break up the unity and integrity of India
and the Indian State, if the Hindus do not repudiate in time
the claim of the Congress to speak on behalf of Hindudom as
a whole.&quot;</p>
<p>DIFFERENCES WITH THE CONGRESS 267</p>
<p>And when a year after, he told his audience at Lucknow
that there was a move for compromise on the question of
Pakistan among the Congress High Command, the purblind
Congress press discredited Savarkar for having suspected the
peerless patriotism of their holy fathers, and declaied with
all the force at their command that Savarkar assertion was
an untruth, although subsequently Congress politics literally
bore out Savarkar \s assertions !</p>
<p>Mr. Jinnah denounce &rsquo; the Hindu Mahasabha in his
Presidential Address at ? Madras Session of the Muslim
League in 1941 as an abs&lt; Aitel 3 ^ incorj igible and hopeless
body, and threatened that if the British Government failed to
create an independent group of Pakistan States, others W&rsquo;ould
come and do it. Savarkar accepted Mr. Jinnah’s remarks
about the Hindu Mahasabha as an unalloyed tribute to the
unalloyed patriotism of the Hindu Mahasabha, and asked the
Congress party to read with open eyes the widting on the
wall — the declaiation of Pakistan — and warned them not to
deceive themselves and to delude the masses by misreading
and misunderstanding the demands of the Muslim League.</p>
<p>In his reply to Mr. Jinnah Savarkar further retorted that
if the State of the Croats was an ideal and a prototype of his
Pakistan, he asked Mr. Jinnah to refer to history about the
fate of the Croats, the Serbs and the Slavs, who had been
victims of larger States. As for the threat from outside forces,
Savarkar replied that the Pan-Islamic alliance would be
resisted by a Hindu-Buddhistic alliance from Jammu to Japan
and he warned Mr. Jinnah : ‘‘ Then again, such parasite
growths of the Pakistan type are no new experience to
Hindudom. During the course of the last five thousand years
of its continuous growth and consolidation, this gigantic
Octopus of Hindudom has clutched and crushed Avithin the
formidable grip of its mighty arms and absorbed a number of
Shakasthans, Hunasthans, and the Marathas sw^allowed and
gulped down your verj^ Mogul Empire entirely before it knew
what was happening.” “The same fate,” asserted Savarkar
vehemently, “ shall these your petty parasites of your Pakistan
States meet after a miserable existence for a time, even if
they ever come into existence.” He then concluded his</p>
<p>268 SAVARKAR AND HIS TIMES</p>
<p>historical reply to Mr. Jinnah, “History avers to the ever-
abiding truth that in India :</p>
<p>‘ Pakistans may come and Pakistans may go
But Hindusthan goes on for ever.’</p>
<p>Savarkar then put forth his historical formula for the
formation of a imited and powerful Indian State. He said :
“ There is, consequently, only one way for the Indian Moslems
to secure their safety, peace and prosperity as a community
in India ; and that is to get themselves incorporated whole-
heartedly and loyally into an Indian Nation which can only
be done on the following basic principles: —</p>
<p>(1) Independence of India and Indivisibility of India as
a Nation and State. (2) Representation strictly in
proportion to the population strength. (3) PubUc
Services to go by merit alone, and (4) the fundamental
rights of freedom of worship, language, script, etc.
guaranteed to all citizens alike.”</p>
<p>After putting forth the basic principles for an honourable
Hindu-Muslim unity and the formation of the Indian State,
Savarkar reiterated his famous historic formxUa, which was
the guiding .star of self-respecting and rising nation: —</p>
<p>“ On these terms and on these terms alone, if they come,
with them, if they do not without them ; but if they
oppose, in spite of them, the Hindus are determined to
continue the good fight for the freedom and integrity of
Hindusthan.” '</p>
