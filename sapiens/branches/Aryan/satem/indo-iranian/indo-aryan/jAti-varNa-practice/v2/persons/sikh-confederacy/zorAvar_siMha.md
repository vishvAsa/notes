- zorAvar siMha the intrepid Dogra general, a kalhuria rAjaputra of the mountains, who solidly conquered Ladhak and Baltistan, repulsed the Tibetans and Chinese, and forced his way in pilgrimage to mAnasasarovara and kailAsa, reached the nepAla border and died fighting Tibetans on his way back ([wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zorawar_Singh_Kahluria)). So honest that "he would transfer to his master any gifts or tribute that came to him."
