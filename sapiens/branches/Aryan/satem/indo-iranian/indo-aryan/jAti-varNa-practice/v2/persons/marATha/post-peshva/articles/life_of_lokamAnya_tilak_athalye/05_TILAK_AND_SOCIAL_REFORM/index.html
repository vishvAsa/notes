<p>The stagnant condition of the Indian civilisation
during several centuries has given rise to a number
of social evils which by their very accumulation impres###sed the imagination of the first generation of English###educated Indians. But these evils are neither more pres###sing nor more hideous than those which during the last
three centuries have accompanied the rapid growth of
European power and culture. The first duty of every
country is to strengthen its position and consolidate its
influence amidst neighbouring groups of nations with
a view to safe-guard its political liberty which is the
mother of all social well-being. Where this hberty is
wanting, the duty of the people lies in recovering it</p>
<p>46 LOKAMANYA TILAK</p>
<p>from those into whose hands it has fallen. But the
Indian leaders in the first half of the 19th century
failed to take note of this cardinal principle and the
country, instead of pining for its lost independence
was applauding the English as deliverers. Howsoever
natural such an attitude might have been owing to
the chaotic condition of things just before the
British Conquest it cannot be too much deplored.
For, relieved of the cares and responsibilities of
political and international questions, the new leaders
of the country attended to the next best thing,
the condition of their society. In this attitude
they were encouraged by their English and Anglo###Indian masters as well as by the zealous Mission###aries, who, too had an axe of their own to grind. Add
to this the tendency of a fallen nation to be-little its
own worth and admire the customs, manners, thoughts
and institutions of the rulers. Knowing that they were
a mere handful in the midst of crores of Indians, the
English believed that unless they maintained very high
prestige among Indians the Political domination of
India was an impossibility and hence they appeared to
us at their best, — strong, masterful, gifted with all the
qualities of greatness. They were demigods amidst a
race of mortals, giants ruling over pigmies and the very
limited intercourse Indians could have with them com###pletely concealed from us their shortcomings. It is not
surprising that in the psychological situation detailed
above, Indian leaders, cut off from the moorings of
National traditions mistook the unreal for the real, the
accidental accompaniment for the substance. Cons###cious of their own impotence and anxious to lift up the</p>
<p>TILAK AND SOCIAL REFORM 47</p>
<p>country to a high level they could think of only one
way, the complete Westernisation of India. English
dress, English habits, even English diet and English
life must, they thought, be imported into this country
before we could think of replacing the English Bureau###crats. Ladies must learn, widows must remarry, castes
must go, — all because we must be equal to our rulers in
efficiency and strength. These early English-educated
leaders advocated Social Reform with the same
object with which Japan, nearly seventy years back
threw away her crude military weapons in favour
of the modern instruments of destruction. In short,
love of imitation, loss of individuality, the glamour
of the English civilisation and a fierce desire to get
rid of India&rsquo;s inferiority, joined with the liberalising
tendencies of the Western thought, ushered the era
of Social Reform in India.</p>
<p>As years passed by, the wildness of these reformers
somewhat abated. But the central idea that possessed
them was faithfully transmitted to the next genration.
Even Ranade was obessed with the idea of getting, so
to speak a certificate from the rulers about the equal
social status of the Indians. In all the social programme
he has left us, we do not come accross a single item
wherein he has departed from the English model. The
idea that the English were Heaven-sent trustees of this
country dominated Indian thought in his days also and
it was believed that once the English had to concede
that Indians had socially advanced up to their level
political rights could not, with decency, be refused. It
was Vishnushastri Chiploonkar, who gave a rude shock
to this blind optimism and declared that if Indian</p>
<p>48 LOKAMANYA TILAK</p>
<p>Society was to grow, it could only develop on its own
lines. His scathing criticism of the degenerate Social
Reformers of the day created a new epoch of social and
political thought and during all his eventful career,
Mr. Tilak did not much depart from the lines laid down
by his master. Mr. Tilak was essentially a Puritan of
Puritans and so was in a sense more fitted to lead Social
Reform than many of the so-called Reformers ; but
being more a man of action than of thought he prefer###red to concentrate on the political issue.</p>
<p>** Was Mr. Tilak a Social Reformer &ldquo;? The question
can be correctly answered only by knowing which re###forms he approved of and which &rsquo; reforms &rsquo; he con###demned. He favoured foreign travel but insisted on
teetotalism and vegetarian diet. He applauded re###marriages of child-widows ; but laid stress on the proper
performance of the Vedic rites. He was for female edu###cation but wanted it to be both useful and ornamental.
He tolerated inter-dining but only on occasions of neces###sity. He wanted sub-castes to intermarry before he
could favour the larger question of intercaste marriages.
He advocated adult marriages but disliked the predo###minantly materialistic nature of Western marriages.
He wanted the badge of untouchability to be removed
but would be no party to hasty and fanatical measures
that would only retard the improvement of the social
life of the &rsquo; depressed &rsquo; classes. He was for a policy oi
open door to all classes and creeds. Drink he abhored,
also sexual vice. He wished our reformers to actively
combat these evils by strenuous propaganda. Reform
he wanted, but genuine reform and not apish imita###tion of Western life and manners.</p>
<p>TILAK AND SOCIAL REtCRM 49</p>
<p>His ideal of a Social Reformer was a Buddha, a Kabir
or a Tukaram. The leader of the Social Reform move###ment must essentially be a man of peace. He must be
a lover of Indian civilisation and culture and must pro###ceed to reform society with due respect for the tradi###tions of the society itself. He must not only be of our
society but must live in it. He must be bold enough
to break those bonds that have outlived their utility ;
but at the same time he must be calm enough
not to harm his cause by abusive language. He
must be a &quot; stalwart Puritan man, battling for the
right, trustful but not elated, serious but not de###jected.&rdquo; He should make his way through mis###understandings, opposition and persecution by sheer
force of truth, love and courage.</p>
<p>But the Social Reform movement of Mr. Tilak&rsquo;s
youthful days did not conform to this ideal. It was
essentially a child of the Western civilisation ; it had
its origin in callous disregard of the past. It ignored
the study of the fundamental basis of Indian Society.
It was not discriminating. It was largely imitative.
It sought to copy Western life and institutions. The
leaders were weak, halting and inconsistent ; the fol###lowers had nothing in them but sound and fury. Sus###tained enthusiasm and sterling sacrifice were woefully
at a discount. It was a movement which claimed,
first priority to and later on equal status with the poli###tical movement and sought radically to reconstruct our
society without taking note of the traditions of the
past or the insufficient materials available in the pre###sent. Such an artificial and indiscriminating move###ment, launched by a handful of fanatics simultaneously
4</p>
<p>50 LOKAMANYA TILAK</p>
<p>with the National Congress excited Mr. Tilak&rsquo;s liveliest
opposition ; and for a few years he was engaged in rele###gating the movement to its normal plane and not allow###ing it to usurp the chief attention of the country.</p>
<p>Ever since 1S34, the &rsquo; irrepressible and audacious *
Mr. Malbari had been trying to raise the age of marriage
of Hindu girls. The field of his activity covered not
only the length and breadth of India but the United
Kingdom of Great Britain also, whence he brought con###siderable pressure to bear on the then Viceroy and his
Council to consider his proposals some of which were as
follows : —</p>
<p>(i) Cohabitation by a husband with his wife, under
twelve years of age, should be made penal.</p>
<p>(2) In cases of infant-marriages, the wife should be</p>
<p>entitled to cancel the marriage, if she liked, on
attaining majority.</p>
<p>(3) Suits by husbands for the restitution of conju-</p>
<p>gal rights should not be allowed. ,</p>
<p>(4) A widow should continue to hold her first hus-</p>
<p>band&rsquo;s property even after her remarriage.
These and other proposals struck at the very root of
Hindu Society and nullified at one stroke the sanctity
and indissoiubiUty of the marriage-tie. They, there###fore caused intense alarm ; and when it was known
that a Bill to raise the &quot; Age of Consent &quot; from
10 (Vide Sec. 375 of the Indian Penal Code) to 12
was in contemplation not only the orthodox people
but some of those who were pronounced Social
Reformers resented this legislative interference. It
was generally believed, though without reason and
in spite of the Government&rsquo;s assurance to the</p>
<p>TILAK AND SOCIAL REFORM $1</p>
<p>contrary, that the introduction of this Bill was
only the thin end of the wedge and that the
whole of Mr. Malabari&rsquo;s programme was likely to re###ceive legislative sanction. Mr. Tilak&rsquo;s opposition to
this Bill has been severely criticised. We should re###member, however, that amongst those who diaspproved
of this Bill, can be seen the names of the late Sir Romesh
Chander Mitter, the late Mr. W. C. Banerjea, the late
Sir T. Madhavarao, Babu (now Hoa. Sir) Surendranath
Banerjea, Mr. (Hon. Dr. Sir) Chimanlal H. Setalwad
and Mr. (now Hon. Mr.) G. S. Khaparde. Mr. Tilak&rsquo;s
attitude was guided by strong common sense. He
challenged the right of a foreign Bureaucracy to sit in
legislative judgment on the Indian society. He denied
the necessity of the measure and the extent of the evil
which he was sure would be eradicated by increasing
education. He led a vigorous agitation, which there
is reason to believe convinced the Government of the
day of the unwisdom of its step ; the fetish of prestige,
however steeled the Governments&rsquo; determination to
get the BiU passed (19th March 189 1). The Govern###ment even preferred* &ldquo;to be wrong with Prof. Bhan###darkar, Mr. Justice Telang and Dewan Bahdur Raghu###nath Rao, than to be right with Pandit Sasadhar and
Prof. Tilak.&rdquo; The impression which Mr. Tilak made, in
those eventful months marked him out as the ** coming
man&quot;. The merciless logic and the vast knowledge
with which he exposed the fallacies and sophistries of
the Reformers in his &quot; long and scholarly &quot; letters
to the Times of India were universally admired and
the extent to which he succeeded in organising</p>
<ul>
<li>From the speech of Sir A. R. Scoble (Law Member),</li>
</ul>
<p>52 LOKAMANYA TILAK</p>
<p>public opinion enabled him to pass a resolution
in the Bombay Provincial Conference (May 1891)
regretting that the Government did not properly
respect the public opinion on the &ldquo;Age of Consent
Bill.&rdquo; It is worth noting that the leaders of the
Keform Party who were present at the Conference
dared not oppose the resolution moved by Mr. Tilak.
Mr. Tilak was not merely a destructive critic. He
showed the way in which the Bill could be made accept###able to the Orthodox party. He suggested that the
attainment of puberty should be made the legal age for
the consummation of marriage. Had this compromise
been accepted there would have been no trouble. But
neither the Governm.ent nor the leading Reformers
were in a conciliatory mood. Mr. Tilak about this
time (26th October 1890) put forth one suggestion which
shows the sincerity of his faith in genuine social reform.
He disapproved of general legislation as the masses
were not prepared for the same. But he welcomed
resort to legislation as a binding force to those who be###lieved in reforms. His proposals were as follows : —
(i) &amp; (2) Girls and boys should not be married until</p>
<p>they have reached the age of 16 and 2a</p>
<p>respectively.
(3) &amp; (4) Unless they are prepared to marry</p>
<p>v/idows, men should not marry after they</p>
<p>are 40 years old.</p>
<p>(5) There should be absolute prohibition of liquor.</p>
<p>(6) Acceptance of dowry in marriages should be</p>
<p>prohibited.</p>
<p>(7) Disfigurement of widows should be forthwith</p>
<p>stopped.</p>
<p>TILAK AND SOCIAL REFORM 53</p>
<p>(8) One-tenth of the monthly income of every re###former should be devoted to public purposes.
Neither Ranade nor Agarkar were willing to bind
themselves with this pledge. However, on Nov. ist
1890, a meeting was held under the presidency of the
late Hon. Rao Bahadur Nulkar to consider Mr. Tilak s
proposals. At this meeting where both Mr. Ranade and
Prof. (Dr. Sir) Bhandarkar were present, Mr. Tilak de###livered a speech which deserves to be recorded. He
said — &quot; There has been much tall talk but little action
regarding social reform, with the result that even those
reforms, the vital need of which has been generally ad###mitted have not been carried out into practice. We
must not only see what reforms are required, but also
whether and how far they are practicable and how
they can be made popular ; for in reforming society,
care ought to be taken to avoid the creation of any
gulf between the people on the one hand and the refor###mers on the other. We must always carry public opi###nion with us ; and this can be done, inter alia, by secur###ing for our reforms the sanction of religion. I am in
favour of Social Reform.&quot; He then discussed his 8
points and wound up by saying that modifications
might here and there be made in his scheme and then
the whole be made binding on its supporters by calling
in legislative sanction. Legislation, he urged should
bind the reformers only and not the masses. Mr.
Ranade welcomed Mr. Tilak&rsquo;s speech but expressed his
doubt as to how many people would come forward to
bind themselves legally to carry out the reforms
proposed in the 8 points. He said that there
were 4 classes of social reformers (i) Those who look to</p>
<p>54 LOKAMANYA TILAK</p>
<p>religious leaders for support, (2) Those who wanted ta
avail themselves of caste-unions, (3) Those who were
willing to accept legislation for themselves and (4)
Those w*ho wanted legislation applicable to all. He
concluded by saying that as Mr. Tilak had fairly ad###vanced up to the third stage, there was very little###difference between himself and Mr. Tilak.</p>
<p>What, then, was the difference between the school of
thought represented by Mr. Ranade and that represent###ed by Mr. Tilak ? For difference — vital difference —
there was, in spite of Mr. Ranade&rsquo;s attempt to
emphasise the points of agreement. The difference
was this that while Ranade was prepared, if con###venient, to coquette with religious sanction to
social reform, Mr. Tilak insisted that there should
be no divorce between the two. The former wanted
to utilise, for the propagation of his ideas, the
disintegrating forces that had come in the
wake of the English conquest ; the latter while
emphatically not unfriendly to social reform, believed
in the imperative necessity of checking, from the larger
national standpoint, the disintegrating forces by fos^
tering a due sense of pride in and respect for the social
and religious institutions of the people. The former
depended solely on Western influence and thought;
Mr. Tilak was for the blending of the old culture and the
new. The former welcomed State-interference in mat###ters social, the latter strongly resented it for the simple
reason that reform to be durable must be a growth from
within. Differing thus in their outlook, it is not sur###prising that while Ranade was prepared to associate
and work with wild and reckless people, people who^</p>
<p>TILAK AMD SOCIAL REFORM 55</p>
<p>were the very negation of qualities required for the Social
Reformer— gentleness, patience, tact, forbearance, and
sweetness, Mr. Tilak was gradually convinced of the
futility of sccial reform as it was then propagated
and was for the above reason compelled to adopt
first an attitude of constructive opposition and then
of neutrality. No &rsquo; petti-fogging motives of policy/
no consideration of winning cheap popularity by
&rsquo; pandering to public prejudices &rsquo; determined his atti###tude.</p>
<p>Looking back at the controversy from a distance of
30 years, what, after all has been the net result of this
much-debated measure ? Under the combined influ###ence of increasing education and economic conditions
and not certainly as a result of the passing of the Bill,
the age of marriage has gone up, making the law practi###cally a dead letter. Only bitter feelings have been
created, feelings which have widened the gulf be###tween the Orthodox and the Reformers and frus###trated Mr. Tilak&rsquo;s attempts to bring about a
social Reform that would not run counter to the reli###gious and patriotic susceptibilities of the people. It
is with pain that one recalls the rowdy scenes that
unfortunately marred a meeting convened by the
Reformers at the Kreeda Bhuwan (25th Feb. 1891).
These scenes, it is still more regrettable to observe, so
enraged a venerable and learned Reformer that he
telegraphed to the Times of India insinuating that
Messrs. Tilak and Namjoshi were at the bottom of the
mischief. Subsequently a notice was served upon the
Times of India (2nd Mar. 189 1) and the Reformers
ceased to persist in the insinuation. They, however</p>
<p>56 LOKAMANYA TILAK</p>
<p>prosecuted five persons for rioting, all of whom were
acquitted by the Magistrate. (23rd Mar. 1891).</p>
<p>While the ashes of the * Age of Consent &rsquo; controversy
were still hot, another episode, still less important
widened the breach between Mr. Tilak and the Refor###mers. Mrs. Ramabai — that enterprising Indian Chris###tian lady — had, by her untiring efforts in America, col###lected funds for the establishment of a Resident School
for Indian girls, especially widows. Mr. Tilak, did not
at all approve of the idea of a school for Indian girls
managed by a Christian lady ; but knowing full well
that the Reformers could not command the necessary
sacrifice and organising capacity, he reluctantly enrolled
his name among the sympathisers of the institution,
after satisfying himself that only secular education
would be imparted in the school. When, however, he
read in the Illustrated Christian Weekly of New York
(21st Dec. 1889) ^^^^ there were about four students
in the school studying Christianity or attending Chris###tian prayers in a Church, he indignantly asked what
became of Mrs. Ramabai&rsquo;s pledge that the school
would strictly remain secular in its character.
Mrs. Ramabai protested and explained the circum###stances under which her four students were receiving
Christian training. The Advisory Committee consist###ing of men like Mr. Ranade and Dr. Bhandarkar
took Mrs. Ramabai to task and asked her to
confine herself to secular education. Mrs. Ramabai
had to yield for a time. But she soon
threw overboard the Advisory Committee by
managing to secure for herself plenary powers from the
Head Office in America. This was the moment when</p>
<p>TILAK AND SOCIAL REFORM 57</p>
<p>the advisory Committee ought to have spoken out its
mind in unmistakable terms and withdrawn, by means
of resignation its moral support from the institution.
But the members wanted to outwit Mrs. Ramabai and
get a reversal of their decision from the American Head
Office ; this was an impossibility, as the Head Office had
implicit trust in Mrs. Ramabai and it was supplying
funds to her mainly for the propagation of Christianity.
Mr. Ranade and his followers had therefore to play a
game of dissimulation ; for they knew that once the
public faith in Mrs. Ramabai was shattered, nothing
could rehabilitate it. It was here that they had a
tussle with Mr. Tilak. From the middle of 1891 to the
close of 1893, this was one of the burning topics of the
day. The taunting and violent way in which papers
like the Subodh Patrika and Agarkar&rsquo;s Sudharak fell foul
of Mr. Tilak is the more remarkable when we remember
how they must have realised their double game. Why
should they all have clung up to Mrs. Ramabai, so un###reasonably, so fanatically ? Could they not have
started an institution of their own, under some trust###worthy management ? Did they think that female
education, even attended with grave risks of conver###sion to Christianity was so necessary ? Apparently
they did not, for on Aug. 13th, 1893, they publicly dis###owned all connection with the institution because it was
^&lsquo;conducted as an avowedly proselytizing institution&quot;*.
They admitted that &quot; during the past year or so, Pandita
Ramabai departed from the lines of strict neutrality &ldquo;;
In trying, therefore to screen Pandita Ramabai from the</p>
<ul>
<li>The Sharada Sudan is now avowedly a Missionary institu###tion, located at Kedgaon near Poona.</li>
</ul>
<p>58 LOKAMANYA TILAK</p>
<p>righteous indignation of the public, they succeeded in
making (he cause of reform more unpopular and the
breach between the Orthodox and the Reform parties
still wider.</p>
<p>The same fateful year (1890) which witnessed the
origin of the Age of Consent controversy and the
SJiarada-Sadana episode was marked by the com###mencement of a dispute still more ridiculous — a
veritable storm in a tea cup. The responsibihty of
this dispute rests not with the Reformers but with
the Orthodox party at Foona, the fanatical and
foolish self-stj&rsquo;led leaders of which charged 42
persons including Ranade, Tilak and Gokhale with
having taken tea (Oct. 4th 1S90), at the residence of a
Missionary with the deliberate object of breaking caste
and in the following two years (1891-92) this suit of
the Orthodox party against these 42 gentlemen in the
Court of Shree Shankaracharya was the principle sub###ject of heated public controversy. The Reformers con###gratulated themselves on having an ally in Mr. Trlak
whose resourceful Sanskrit scholarship stood them in
good stead and helped them in getting very light punish###ment from the religious tribunal. It is noteworthy that
Ranade thought it in no way humiliating to submit to
the decision of the Court and for this conduct he was
severely criticised by both the Orthodox and the Re###form parties (the latter included some of his own ardent
followers). Mr. Tilak justified the taking of Pray ash###chitia, and said that in such matters it is the duty of us
all to be actuated by a spirit of compromise. He said
** There is considerable resemblance between our diffi###culties in the Political field and those in the Social one J</p>
<p>TILAK AND SOCIAL REFORM 59</p>
<p>neither the political asdministration nor the structure
of our society completely satisfies us. We want to
reform both. The English administration as well as
the Indian society have solid foundations; we are, there###fore, bound to proceed with caution. Now, if people
are willing to accept Political Reforms in a spirit of
conciliation and compromise we fail to understand why
we should like to proceed with Social Reform in an
arrogant and defiant manner. If we are prepared to
make compromise when the Parliament passes the
Council&rsquo;s Act, 1892, why should we not do so with res###pect to questions likes widow-remarriage ? Fanatical
opposition might occassionally be successful, but as a
rule, in political as well as social matters, fanaticism is
suicidal &quot; {Kesari 7th June 1892).</p>
<p>It will be news to this generation, accustomed to take
for granted Mr. Tilak&rsquo;s hostility or indifference to Social
Reform, that not only did he attend Social Confer###ences but also took active part in the proceedings. In
the 4th Social Conference, held at Calcutta, (Dec. 1890),
Mr. Tilak moved an amendment to a Resolution pro###posed by the late Mr. R. N, Mudholkar. The resolu###tion condemned child-marriages and advocated adult###marriages. Mr. Tilak, who whole-heartedly supported
the proposition wanted to delete an incorrect reference
to the Shastras. In the Social Conference of 1891, held
at Nagpur, Mr. Tilak suggested a bold amendment to
the Resolution which advocated widow remarriages and
called upon people to help the movement by doing their
utmost. &ldquo;How are the people to help &ldquo;? asked Mr.
Tilak. He said that mere lip-sympathy for widow
remarriages would not do. These who sympathised</p>
<p>-60 LOKAMANYA TILAK</p>
<p>with the cause ought to show their sympathy by attend###ing not only the marriage-ceremony but the marriage
feasts also. But the diplomatic leaders of the Confer###ence, the professions of some of whom considerably
differed from practice, wriggled themselves out of the
difficulty, by adding the words &quot; so far as possible &quot; to
&quot; help the movement .&rdquo; To the resolution advocating
sea- voyage, Mr. Tilak moved an amendment which laid
stress upon vegetarian diet and Prayaschitta. He was
supported by Pandit Mad an Mohan Malaviya.</p>
<p>In 1889, the Social Reform leaders issued a circular
together with printed copies of pledges which persons
who believed in Social Reform had to sign. The cir###cular expressly declared that the idea of resort to legis###lation, in matters social, was definitely given up. So
Mr. Tilak gladly associated himself with this movement
led by Ranade and other leading Reformers of the
Bombay Presidency. But when the Government,
showed their willingness to introduce the &quot; Age of
Consent Bill &ldquo;, the leaders of Social Reform did not
hesitate to go back on their pledged word. The Social
Conference of 1889 decided — altogether without con###sulting the signatories to the pledge — that the pledge
bound not themselves alone but their children and exe###cutors as well ! ! ! Mr. Tilak was utterly disgusted
with such ridiculous resolutions. He admitted that the
disfigurement of widow was unjustifiable but he had
nothing but contempt and ridicule for those who seri###ously brought forward a resolution in the Conference
requesting Government to make penal the disfigure###ment of widows. Such childish, perverse and un###reasonable conduct was in his opinion extremely</p>
<p>TILAK AND SOCIAL REFORM. 6r</p>
<p>prejudical fo the cause itself. The greatest defect
in the movement was, Mr. Tilak declared, want of
courage and wand of sincerity. There was much
empty noise. Nothing could be gained, he thought,
by holding National Social Conferences. There
was no country in the world, which resorted
to such general condemnation of its customs and
manners. Moreover, there are so many different
castes and creeds in India that, excepting a very
few common points, each section of the community
must proceed in its own way along the path of
reform. x\ll reform is a growth from within and
unless the people are sufficiently prepared by due
assimilation of liberal ideas if is useless to march
ahead. It was no use running the Social Conference
on the lines of the National Congress. The latter
was a deliberative assembly and could not be
otherwise in the present circumstances. But it devolved
upon the Reformers to appeal more to the people than
to the Government. Action and not mere speech was
the need of the day. A vigorous educative propaganda
must be carried on. We must proceed step by step
along the lines of least resistance ; and above aU the
Reformers must in no way hurt the general pride of the
people in their Social life and institutions. In the
atmosphere of political serfdom, there are countless
things that make us conscious of our weakness. What
we want is self-confidence ; and all reform that tends
to make the nation more conscious of its shortcomings
than of its strength, is not only undesirable but is posi###tively mischievous.</p>
<p>It will thus be seen there was something more than</p>
<p>62 LOKAMANYA TILAK</p>
<p>mere Opportunism behind Mr. Tilak&rsquo;s attitude towards
Social Reform nearly 30 years ago. It has been said
that since his return from Mandalay he showed a broad###er outlook and he did not hesitate to assimilate &quot; the
more Catholic tendencies &quot; of the time. But a careful
perusal of the preceding pages will show that, even in
his younger days, Mr. Tiiak was a Social Reformer.
His declaration of sympathy with the depressed classes,
made on the eve of his departure to England was much
appreciated. Here again Mr. Tilak&rsquo;s ideas about the
best v/ay of effecting reform prevented him from sign###ing the manifesto which pledged the signatories to take
every opportunity of breaking the bonds of untoucha###bility. Mr. Tilak was no believer in violent Social
Reform. Regarding the Patel-marriage-Bill, though
he was in favour of some such legislation, he
believed the Bill to be untimely and against the basic
principles of the Hindu religion and society. Had he
lived for a decade more, the country would have seen
him playing the role of an active Social Legislator in
the new Councils. In his youth, parasitical Social
Reform was blended with lukewarm political spirit.
Mr. Tilak gave a rub to both and became, in spite of an
unpleasant episode the leader of the Orthodox Party
in social as well as political matters. He lived, how###ever to claim amongst his followers, persons of all castes
and creeds, the Orthodox and the Reformers. The
silent force of modern conditions has wrought a mighty
revolution in the Social ideas of the people in spite of
the fact that there has been no propaganda worth the
name. All have moved with it ; Tilak and Chanda###varkar, the bigots of the Orthodox Party and the fire-</p>
<p>TILAK AND SOCIAL REFORM. 63</p>
<p>eaters amongst Social Reformers. To-day&rsquo;s Social
Reformer speaks quite a different language from that
of Ranade and others. And the venerable Shastris
and Pandits of the present time sanction things that
would have shocked their own susceptibilities a gene###ration ago. The evolution of Mr. Tilak&rsquo;s religious
views, so bold and original — lies recorded in the pages
of the Gita-Rahasya ; but the cruel hand of death has
for ever prevented us from having an actual knowledge
of the evolution of his ideas about the Hindu Society
and the ways and means he had devised for its improve###ment. &rsquo; Ditcher &rsquo; in the Capital (7th August 1920)
remarks most thoughtfully; —</p>
<p>&quot; There were epochs of thought in his personal bio###graphy ; and I think that in the zenith of his power, the
fervour of his Hindu particularism began to cool and
blend with the more CathoUc tendencies of his time and
conutry.&rdquo;</p>
