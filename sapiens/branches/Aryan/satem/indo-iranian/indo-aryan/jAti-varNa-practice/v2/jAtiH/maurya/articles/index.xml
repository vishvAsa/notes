      <description>&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&#34;https://x.com/cbkwgl/status/2010259859468378434&#34;&gt;TW&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Asoka&amp;rsquo;s is one of the most warped narration in world history.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;He killed his father and his brothers to seize throne&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;For support to his quest for throne, he converted to Buddhism and slaughtered the armies of Kalinga, which probably rejected his coup&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Even after he became the king, his brutalities are well known. He murdered one of his wives, slaughtered the Ajivakas and Jains, unable to face his anger, a Minister of his fled to Tarim Basin. In fact, his son was that ashamed of his deeds, he rehabilitated everyone his father persecuted.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;While Central Asia&amp;rsquo;s conversions to Buddhism are attributed to him, the reality is, those conversions happened during the reign of Kanishka but narrative ended up praising Asoka&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;His pacifist model simply led the kingdom into a rot - a rot from which it never recovered for centuries. Pushyamitra Shunga tried to an extent but was only partly successful.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;</description>
