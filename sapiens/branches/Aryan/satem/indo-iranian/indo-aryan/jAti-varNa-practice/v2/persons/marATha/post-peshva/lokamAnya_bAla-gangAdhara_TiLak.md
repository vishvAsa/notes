chitpAvana ([shikhA_img](../../../images/people/tilak-wears-cap-on-shikhA.gif)), great patriot, a fine sanskrit poet (even a chitrakavi) in his boyhood \[[IMG](../../images/snippets/tilak-chitra-kAvya.jpg), [TW](https://twitter.com/blog_supplement/status/991509282582560770)\], good scholar of the veda-s (taking a philological angle), "endeavored to position Hindu thought as a capable player in the arena of modern philosophical discourse", who said "svarAj is our right, and we shall have it", and went to jail; who initiated the svadeshI movement, and boycott of English administration. \[[nehru1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVjJ4UQZJcc), [vid_trailer1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpS2bF3KwmU&feature=youtu.be)\]
- लोकमान्यः शाण्डिल्य इति ज्ञायते।
- Roused the people with newspaper kesarI, gaNesha-pUjA, shivAjI-jayanti. Spearheaded education efforts. Partly inspired chApekar brothers.
- "Despite being personally opposed to early marriage, Tilak was against the 1891 Age of Consent bill, seeing it as interference with Hinduism and a dangerous precedent. The act raised the age at which a girl could get married from 10 to 12 years." This is the kind of foresight and clarity that set the great patriot from contemporaries.
- A man of great emotional robustness [IMG](http://i.imgur.com/MHL9HX0.png). Mandalay routine - [KPP](http://www.kamat.com/jyotsna/blog/blog.php?BlogID=1235).

- BG Tilak was homeschooled till age 11. And he hated school.
  Once he left: For full one year,  he neglected his studies and devoted practically all his time exclusively to physical culture.
