  <p>I</p>
<p>The Abhinava Bharat was pondering over the sentences
passed upon the Maniktola revolutionaries. Babarao Savar-
kar’s heroic sacrifice blazed vigorously under the sacrificial
firmament. The boiling point of British reaction was reached.
The zero hour had struck. And Sir Curzon Wyllie, the brain
and eye of Indian affairs at the India House, fell a victim to
the bullets of Madanlal Dhingra on the first night of July 1909.
Along with him also fell Dr. Cawas Lalcaca, an Anglecised
Parsee zealot, who tried to save the life of Sir Curzon WyUie.
The fateful incident took place in the Hall of the Imperial
Institute, London, at the conclusion of a meeting held to cele-
brate the annual function of the National Indian Association.</p>
<p>Madanlal Dhingra was a manly spirit, a man who looked
into his open grave ! Smartly dressed he looked like a dandy.
He was a devoted follower of Savarkar and was proud of his
nation. One day someone taunted him that the Japanese
were the bravest people in Asia. Dhingra retorted that his
Hindu Nation was nothing less in comparison. In the course
of the talk, it was decided to test the mettle of Madanlal him-
self. A pin was pierced through his palm. Blood flowed
out profusely, but Dhingra remained unperturbed.</p>
<p>A few days before the Wyllie incident Dhingra had asked
his leader whether the time for martyrdom had really come.
Out came the epigrammatic reply from Savarkar : “ If a
martyr is determined and ready that fact by itself generally
implies that the time for martyrdom must have come.”
Dhingra then joined a jolly club where high-placed English-
men attended. He crept into their confidence. There he
learnt to shoot and gained closer knowledge of men like Lord
Morley, Lord Ciurzon and Sir Ciu^on Wyllie. The living symbol
of racial arrogance, the Bengal culprit and the enlightened
despot, Lord Curzon was Dhingra’s immediate target. A few</p>
<p>4</p>
<p>50 SAVASKAR AND HIS TIMBS</p>
<p>days before at a meeting he had pursued this target with the
eyes of a crocodile. But the doors of the Hall were closed
in his face and restless Dhingra returned and said to Savor-
kar, “ The tiger has escaped ! ” Determined to avenge the
misdeeds the British Government perpetrated in India, he
then fell on an equally responsible man, Sir William Curzon
Wyllie, with the fierceness of a lion and achieved his end ! He
was arrested forthwith. Two pistols, a knife and a dagger
were found on his person. After the deed, the doctors who
examined the victims were astounded to see Dhingra’s pulse
beating normal, for he was no common killer. Great was the
strength and noblest was the soul of Madanlal. Dhingra was
then put into the Brixton Jail. And proceedings against
Dhingra commenced.</p>
<p>The incident shook London to its marrow ! Some unusual
crowbar turned London upside down, as it were ! India was
the subject in every British cottage, in every paper, in trains,
in trams, at public squares and in markets, palaces and the
British Parliament. The atmosphere became tense. Dhingra’s
father wired to Lord Morley that he was ashamed to own
Madanlal as his son. Even Dhingra’s brother in London
publicly disowned him. Under the fiery eyes of the Britishers
loyal Indians also trembled. Their holy tears overflowed.
They assembled on the 5th of July in the famous Caxton Hall
to condemn Dhingra. At the meeting Sir Mancherjee Bhow-
nagari. Sir Aga Khan, Sir Surendranath Banerjee, Sri B. C.
Pal and Sri Khaparde were loud in their denunciation.
The meeting was attended by Maharajkumar of Coochbihar,
Sir Dinshaw Petit, Fazalbhoy Karimbhoy, etc. Just then
&lsquo;Theodore Morrison, a member of the India Council, brought
Madanlal’s brother on to the platform. MadanlaTs brother
spoke sentences which were not his own. Sir Aga Khan, the
chairman, then declared, “ The meeting unanimously condemns
Madanlal Dhingra.” But a defying voice from the thickly
crowded Hall roared, “ No, not unanimously.” &lsquo;The chairman
angrily uttered : “ Who says no ? ” Out came the reply, “ I
say no.” The chairman pursued, “ Your name please.” Upon
this some lost their patience and shouted, “Pull him down,
drive him out ! ” In a moment Sir Mancherjee Bhownagari
jumped from the platform and ran in the direction of the</p>
<p>THE STORM BREAKS</p>
<p>51</p>
<p>voice. The challenging voice shot back : “ It is me. My name is
Savarkar.” At this the audience trembled in their joints.
They feared that revolutionaries would now bomb the meet-
ing. Women shrieked, non-partisans took to their heels and
partisans came from words to blows. The chicken-hearted
shook beneath benches and chairs ! In the heat of the passion
a Eurasian swooped down upon Savarkar and struck him a
blow on the forehead. Savarkar’s face was besmeared with
blood. His clothes were dripping, his spectacles broken to
pieces. “ With all this I say, I am against the resolution,” ho
said standing as firm as a rock to maintain his opinion to the
last drop of his blood. As he was saying this, Sri Tiruma-
lacharya, who was standing by Savarkar, thrashed the head
of the aggressor, one Mr. Palmer, and down went Palmer
reeling. Sri Aiyer was about to shoot Palmer, but Savarkar
winked at him and restrained him.</p>
<p>In the meanwhile Sir Surendranath had left the hall protest-
ing against the cowardly attack on Savairkar. Sir Aga Khan
also did not like the rashness of Sir Mancherjee. At last at
the instance of Sir Mancherjee the police interfered, but, seeing
that the truth was on Savarkar’s side, they let him go.
Savarkar also let the Eurasian go ! And the meeting ended.</p>
<p>Tossing from side to side in his bed with a fold of wet cloth
on his forehead, Savarkar at his residence dictated a letter the
very night for the London Times. With its publication he
silenced all the hostile criticism against him. His arguments
were irrefutable when he stated that, as the case of Dhingra
was sub judice, the meeting had no right to usurp the powers
of the court and condemn Madanlal in advance. Moreover,
he had a right to record his vote ! Thus did the historic meet-
ing test the stuff of the leader of revolution and his knowledge
of law ! Here one thing may be made clear. Had the meeting
at the Caxton Hall sympathised with Lady Curzon Wyllie in
her bereavement and done nothing else, Savarkar would have
also sympathised with the poor lady. Savarkar was a poet
and philosopher full of human attributes. Niranjan Pal, who
was present at the meeting, dwells upon this great trait in
Savarkar and observes : “ The assassination of Sir Curzon
Wyllie remixids me of another great trait in Savarkar’s
character, his humanity. An Indian student laughingly</p>
<p>52 SAVARKAR AND HIS TIMBS</p>
<p>described how Lady Ciirzon Wyllie ran down the staircase and
threw herself on the body of her husband. All this was too
much for Savarkar. ‘ A wife sobs her heart out for her
husband and you laugh at it ! I do not trust you — can-
not ! ’ Savarkar had replied in burning indignation. It was
a prophetic statement for, the very man secured the King’s
pardon by giving evidence against Savarkar.” ^</p>
<p>When preliminary hearing of the Dhingra trial com-
menced on July 10, at the Westminster Court, despite the evil
advice to feign madness, Dhingra boldly asserted that he
wished that the English Court of Law should sentence him to
death, for in that case the vengeance of his countrymen would
be all the keener. He further said ; “ Just as the Germans
have no right to occupy this country, so the English people
have no right to occupy India ; and it is perfectly justifiable
on our part to kill the Englishman who is polluting our sacred
land. I am surprised at the terrible hypocrisy, the farce and
the mockery of the English people.” Dhingra made this
ex tempore statement as the written statement found on liis
person at the time of his arrest was suppressed by the police
who said that no such statement was recovered at all. Dhingra
was then committed to Sessions.</p>
<p>In India also there were sky-high denimciations of the deed
of Madanlal. N. C. Kelkar, at one such protest meeting, asked
his audience to uproot the doctrine of violence. He said it
was a poisonous tree which must not be allowed to grow, even
in neglected comers. Kelkar was indeed a man of elastic
convictions. Afterwards, while writing the life of Garibaldi,
he openly glorified the sacrifice of revolutionaries as the
fertilizer of the nation ! Gokhale went one step further than
Kelkar. He denoimced the whole London group of about
fifty revolutionaries and insinuated that their activities would
not stop imless Savarkar was arrested.</p>
<p>Dhingra’s Sessions trial was a formal affair. There, too, he
repeated his demand that his statement suppressed by the
police should be read, and offered no other defence. But the
police persisted in their assxuned ignorance of the statement as
in the lower Court. The Court thereupon sentenced Dhingra
to death and the trial ended.</p>
<p>^ Niranjan Pal, The Mahratta, dated 27-5-1938.</p>
<p>THE STORM BREAKS</p>
<p>53</p>
<p>Newspapers now directly attacked Savarkar as the source
of the tragedy. In India his relations and colleagues were
persecuted. Some lost their jobs, some their property and his
father-in-law heroically faced sufferings. Harsh measures
were adopted to crush the Indian students. Pandit
Shyamji’s Scholarship money for Spencer Lectureship was
returned. The Pandit and Virendranath Chattopadhyaya lost
their degrees as a result of their writings and propaganda.
Though Savarkar passed the final examination of the Gray’s
Inn, the Benchers of his Inn declined to confer the degree
upon him. Thereupon Savarkar made an appeal to the autho-
rities of the Gray’s Iim. They appointed a Committee to
inquire into the affair. That Committee instituted an inquiry
into the matter. Match as Savarkar was for the legal brains
on the Committee and their cross-examination, nothing was
proved against him though this Committee was aided by the
Government of India. At last the Committee of the Gray’s Inn
decided to confer the degree upon Savarkar provided he gave
them a written undertaking that he would never participate
in politics. Savarkar rejected their offer in toto ! Getting
the degree was not his aim. His sole aim was to free his
country and make it great and powerful. This barrister was
not meant for conducting petty cases and amass wealth. He
was the nation’s barrister. He was destined to study the case
of his Fatherland and put it before the world opinion as did
Mazzini and Lenin. Hindusthan knows how from the sun-
shine of his youth to the golden evening of his life, he has
been a loyal barrister all along defending and fighting for the
absolute political Independence of India, her integrity and her
honour.</p>
<p>Savarkar was now on the verge of physical collapse. For
the last four years he had worked with a phenomenal energy.
Persecution reached its climax. A yell of wrath fell on him
from all quarters. As the India House was closed down just a
few days before the Curzon Wyllie incident, Savarkar then
resided for some days with Sri B. C. Pal. On the next day of
Wyllie’s death angry crowds stormed Pal’s residence. Elder Pal
told the mob that Savarkar was his guest and averted further
consequences. Savarkar, however, thought it wise to leave
his residence for their and his safety. Homeless, friendless,</p>
<p>54 SAVARKAR AMD HIS TIMES</p>
<p>starving, stranded and shadowed by CJ.D., he wandered
from lodge to lodge and house to house for shelter. But who
shelters a defeated Guru Govind Singh ? Was not the
defeated Tatya Tope betrayed ? And so in a single day
Savarkar had to quit two lodgings. From one of these he was
ousted even at midnight ! The C.I.D. men followed his
shadow. No sleep, no rest, no food ! At last a German land-
lady accepted him as a boarder for some days.</p>
<p>Fatigued and fagged out, Savarkar soon went to Brighton,
a seaside English town, for a change. It was here sitting by
the side of Niranjan Pal on the beach that in overwhelming
emotions filled with helplessness and hopelessness in a foreign
land, the deserted youth sobbed his glorious moving poem
“ Take me O Ocean ! Take me to my native shores. Tliou
promised me to take me home. But thee coward, afraid of
thy mighty master, Britain, thou hast betrayed me. But mind
my mother is not altogether helpless. She will complain to
sage Agasti and in a draught he will swallow thee as he did
in the past.” Several front rank poets and first-rate literary men
of Maharashtra have regarded this poem as an unparalleled
poem on patriotism. Foremost amongst them is the chief
disciple of Gandhiji, Acharya Kaka Kalelkar, who described
it as an inscription on the Marathi language.^ Acharya Atre,
a front rank playwright and journalist, recently commented
in his address at a literary Conference at Indore that every
lofty idea in this pathetic song represented a specimen of great
life and great poetry ! Thirty years after, describing the mov-
ing incident at Brighton, Niranjan Pal remarked : “It has
been my supreme good fortune to have met and known almost
all the great patriots and personalities of modern India, but
I have yet to know of a patriot who loved his Motherland as
dearly as Vinayak Damodar Savarkar.” &quot;</p>
<p>Even at Brighton Savarkar had an urgent feat to accom-
plish. It was the publication of Dhingra’s suppressed state-
ment before he was hanged. Savarkar, therefore, called his
comrade, Gyanchand Varma, to Brighton and arranged for
giving publicity to Dhingra’s written statement which had
been suppressed by the police. Two days gone, and Dhingra</p>
<p>1 Kaka Kalelkar. The Pratibha. dated 15-1-1936.</p>
<p>-Niranjal Pal, The Mahratta. dated 27-5-1938.</p>
<p>THESTORMBREAKS 55</p>
<p>would jcm eternity. Savarkar, therefore, resolved that
Dhingra must see the statement published. Accordingly
Savarkar got the copies of Dhingra’s statement printed and
Varma posted them from Paris to different American and
Irish&rsquo; papers. It was difficult to find an English paper to
publish the statement. But an Irishman working as an
assistant editor on the Daily News undertook the job and
inserted it in his paper during the night shift. The statement
then exploded on the morning of the 16th August throughout
London as a bombshell ! The C.I.D. and police officers were
sure it would never be published. It was in their possession.
But they were outwitted and the statement entitled “ Chal-
lenge ” flashed throughout the world. The statement of
Dhingra read as below :</p>
<p>“ I admit, the other day, I attempted to shed English blood
as an humble revenge for the unhuman hangings and depor-
tations of patriotic Indian youths. &hellip; I believe that a nation
held in bondage with the help of foreign bayonets is in a per-
petual state of war. Since open battle is rendered impossible
to a disarmed race, I attacked by surprise ; since guns were
denied to me, I drew forth my pistol and fired.” The state-
ment proceeds : “ As a Hindu, I feel that a wrong done to my
country is an insult to God.” It concluded : “ The war of
independence will continue between India and England so
long as the English and Hindu races last (if this present un-
natural relation does not cease).”</p>
<p>This was the statement which Dhingra said he did not
remember fully and a copy of which the police had secured
at Dhingra’s residence and another on his person. They had
no idea that there were more copies in existence. How could
Savarkar get a third copy and send it with Varma for being
circulated and published all over the world ? Some papers
like the London Times openly spoke out their ininds by saying
that someone must have put these words into Dhingra’s
mouth ! It was clear beyond doubt that the author of the
statement was the leader himself !</p>
<p>Savarkar saw Dhingra in the Brixton Jail on July 22. He
said to Madanlal, “ I have come to have your Darshan.’* On
hearing the tribute to his sacrifice, glee played over his face
and grateful tears appeared in his eyes. Dhingra’s last wish</p>
<p>56 SAVARKAB AMD HIS TIMES</p>
<p>was that be shoiild be burnt in conformity with Hindu rites,
that no non-Hindu should touch his body, that his clothes and
articles should be sold and the money should be donated to
the National Fund ! Is death more fearless than Madanlal ?
How many such peerless jewels has a slave coimtry to dedicate
for propitiating the Goddess of Freedom ?</p>
<p>Delighted at the frustration of the police plan, Dhingra
embraced gallows on August 17, 1909. His last words as
explained in the statement were, “ My wish is that I should
be bom again of the same Mother and that I should die the
same death for her again.” His dead body was not handed
over to the London Hindus. Still Varma performed the funeral
obsequies and got his head tonsmed according to Hindu rites
in honour of the great soul ! Long live Dhingra for the
intense love of his coxmtry ! They never die who fall in a
great cause ! He fell with faith in his mission and in the
destiny of his countrymen and love for his Motherland.</p>
<p>Dhingra’s deed thrilled the entire world. Huge placards
from Irish papers paid glowing tributes to Dhingra : &lsquo;* Ireland
honours Madanlal Dhingra who was proud to lay down his
life for the sake of his country.” Only men like Pandit
Jawaharlal Nehru, however, who were then in London
seemed to be unconcerned with the momentous deed. Later
in life he has ‘ observed Gandhian Monday ’ over this thrilling
episode even in his ‘ Autobiography</p>
<p>The storm raised by Dhingra did not immediately subside.
Comments continued for a long time.</p>
<p>Mr. W. S. Blunt, author of Secret History oj the English
Occupation of Egypt, wrote about his interview with Mr. Lyne
Stevens, the Doctor Royal friend. Blunt says : “ He talked
about the Dhingra assassination, which seems to have at last
convinced his Royal friends that there is something wrong
about the state of India. People talk about political assassi-
nations as defeating its own end, but that is nonsense, it is
just the shock needed to convince selfish rulers that selfish-
ness has its limits of imprudence. It is like that other fiction
that England never 3delds to threats. My experience is that
when England has her face well slapped she apologises, not
before.” ^ Blunt further wrote in his Diaries that no Christian</p>
<p>^ W. S. Blunt, My Diaries, Part II p. 276.</p>
<p>THE STORM BREAKS 57</p>
<p>marlyr ever faced his judges more fearlesdy or with greater
dignity and remarked that the day of Dhingra’s execution
would be regarded as one of martyrdom in India for
generations.^</p>
<p>Lloyd George expressed to Winston Churchill his highest
admiration of Dhingra’s attitude as a patriot. Chiuchill shared
the same views and quoted with admiration Dhingra’s last
words as the finest ever made in the name of patriotism.
They compared Dhingra with Plutarch’s immortal heroes.*
Lala Hardayal wrote in the first issue of the Bande Mataram,
started by Madame Cama ; “ In times to come, when the
British Empire in India shall have been reduced to dust and
ashes, Dhingra’s monuments will adorn the squares of otu:
chief towns, recalling to the memory of our children the noble
life and noble death of one who laid down his life in a far-off
land for the cause he loved so well.”</p>
<p>And what kind of Swaraj was Dhingra’s ideal for which
he sacrificed his life ? The Abhinava Bharat unequivocally
proclaimed times without number its ideal of Swaraj in these
words : “ India must be independent ; India must be united ;
India must be a republic ; India must have a common
language, and a common script. That script is Nagari, that
language is Hindi. That Repubhc is that national form of
Government in which the sovereign power — whether it be
exercised by a Monarch or by a President, matters not much
— crests ultimately and uncompromisingly in the hands of the
Indian people.” ® The leader of Abhinava Bharat always
repeated : “ Before you destroy anything you must know
what you are going to construct in its place.” He had fully
dwelt on the constitutional problem in his speeches and writ-
ings. His study in political science and constitutional law was
far advanced.</p>
<p>In his famous leaflet addressed to the Indian Princes under
the title, ‘ Choose O Indian Princes ! ’ he states : “ Whether
the head of the Imperial Government of the Indian Nation
be a President or a King depends upon how the revolution
develops itself. . . . The Mother must be free, must be one and</p>
<p>1 W. S. Blunt, My Diaries, Part JI, p. 288.</p>
<p>3 Ibid., p. 288.</p>
<p>® Chitra Gupta, Life of Barrister Savarkar, p. 68.</p>
<p>58 SAVARRAR AND HIS TIMES</p>
<p>United, must make her will supreme.” The leaflet voices a
Warning to the Princes that the newly bom nation would call
them to accoimt for their deeds and misdeeds and swearing
by the blood of Dhingra, it thunders : “ Choose whether you
shall be the first of the nation’s fathers or the last of the
nation’s tyrants.” And the leaflet concludes with a threat :
“When the mightiest of empires is trembling at the very
birth-pangs of this revolution, you, weak as you are, cannot
hinder its onward march or smother its birth any more than
you can change the force of gravitation or the rotundity of
the earth.” ^ ,</p>
<p>It was a year before this momentous period that the leader
of the Abhinava Bharat had tried to contact the Prime
Minister of Nepal, then in London, and had appealed to him
in a letter written in Dhingra’s blood to play the Victor
Emmanuel. Next day the representative of the Prime
Minister sent his message to the representative of the Abhi-
nava Bharat that “ God’s will shall prevail ! ”</p>
<p>n</p>
<p>In Savarkar one finds the unique combination of the bravery
of Arjun and the poetry of Vyas. His pen was as powerful
as his tongue. He was the leader of a revolutionary move-
ment and a great literary power as well. He wielded both
pen and pistol with equal command. Scarcely did a leader of
any other revolutionary movement strike terror into the
hearts of his enemies with his pen and pistol as he did. It
is no wonder that his writings and ballads impressed effec-
tively his personality on the Indian Revolution and inspired
soldiers and patriots to fight the cause of freedom — from Rajaji
to Roy, from Hardayal to Bhagat Singh, from Rajan to Kher,
from Kanhere to Gogate and from the Ghadr to the I.N.A. !</p>
<p>It will, therefore, be appropriate to narrate the history of
his inspiring books and writings at this jimctime. During the
first six months of his London life, Savarkar translated the
autobiography of Mazzini into Marathi. This was the first
book to enjoy an uncommon popularity in Maharashtra. It
was so dearly loved that leading papers and leading men in</p>
<p>1 Quoted in S. L. Karandikar’s Savarkar-Charitra, pp. 317-18.</p>
<p>THESTORMEREAKS 59</p>
<p>Maharashtra extolled it to the skies and it was taken out- in
procession by young and old devotees. Even Sir Valentine
Chirol described this book as the Nationalist Textbook.^
Savarkar’s Mazzini natxirally was the first victim of the Indian
Press Act. The book was mostly loved for the introduction
of the Indian Mazzini, expounding the great mission of the
Italian patriot. The fiery propaganda and the burning
patriotism of this immortal introduction captivated the minds
of the people so much that, though it was suppressed by the
Government, patriotic youths learnt it by heart and repeated
the twenty-five pages c&gt;f its inspiring introduction word by
word ! The book was restored in 1946 after having suffered
proscription for forty years.</p>
<p>The Sikh front also absorbed Savarkar’s mind. He learnt
Gurumukhi, read all the religious and important original
writings such as the Acli Granth, the Panth Prakash, the Surya
Prakash, Vichitra Natak by the Gurus and other works on
Sikhism, and issued many pamphlets. His pamphlet, named
“ Khalsa ” and many others issued in Gurumukhi rained into
the hands of Sikh soldiers, making them conscious of their
duty and of the coming storm, and educating them for the
cause of Freedom. This did not escape the notice of the Gov-
ernment of India.</p>
<p>Savarkar was a great pamphleteer. His brilliant leaflet ‘ O
Martyrs’ stirred the sleeping embers of patriotism in the
hearts of both soldiers and patriots. He wrote in a moving
tone : “ For the war of 1857 shall not cease till the revolution
arrives, striking slavery into dust, elevating liberty to the
throne. . . . No, a revolutionary war knows no truce, save
liberty or death ! . . . But, O glorious Martyrs, in this pious
struggle of your sons, help ! . . . Whisper unto us the nobility
of such an alliance of Religion and Patriotism, the true religion
which is ever on the side of patriotism, the true patriotism
which secures the freedom of religion ! . . . With limited
means you sustained a war, not against tyranny alone, but
against tyranny and treachery together.” -</p>
<p>After describing the noble war of Italian Independence in
Etirope, Savarkar invoked the warriors of 1857 to deliver his</p>

</ul>
<p>2 Quoted in S. L. Karandikar’s Savarkar-Charitra, pp. 213-15.</p>
<p>60 SAVAREAR AND HIS TIMES</p>
<p>message through their own mighty words and mighty deeds.
His aim in writing his book on 1857 was to in^ire his people
with a biuning desire to rise again and wage a second success-
ful war for the liberation of their Motherland. For achieving
that goal, he always stressed the need for carrying politics and
patriotism into the military forces of India.</p>
<p>Savarkar read at the India House heaps of original letters,
numerous documents and several hxmdred books and all
important references in the British Museum regarding 1857.
He also read Rajanikant’s Sepoys^ Mutiny in the Bengali
language. After incessant study and industry, he wrote in
Marathi his famous work. The First Indian War oj Indepen-
dence of 1857. The manuscript came to India and went back
to Paris, for no press dared publish it in India. The C.I.D.
carried simultaneous surprise raids on several printing
houses in Maharashtra for the manuscript, but failed. As the
publication of his book in Marathi became difficult, some
brilliant members of the Abhinava Bharat in London trans-
lated the manuscript into English. The agents of Scotland
Yard succeeded in smuggling away through their agent a
chapter of the original manuscript and thus the British and
Indian Governments came to know of the coming book. The
British C.I.D. .slyly described the book as revolutionary,
explosive and seditious. The two Governments were so much
terror-stricken and became so much nervous that they
proscribed the book hurriedly which they admitted Wcis not
even published ! This book of Savarkar was the first book
of its kind in the treasury of world literature that was pro-
scribed before it saw the light of day ! Unique honour to the
author who stands unparalleled in this respect in the domain
of the literary world. Savarkar took up the challenge and
held the two Governments to caustic ridicule in the British,
American and European Press ! Even some of the British
papers resented the shameless attitude of their Government.</p>
<p>There was after this a hot pursuit and intellectual fight
for some time between Scotland Yard and the London Abhi-
nava Bharat for preventing the publication on one side and
accomplishing its publication on the other. At last Savarkar
eluded the police and the C.I.D., and succeeded in getting the</p>
<p>THE STOBM BREAKS 61</p>
<p>book printed in Holland in 1909, though the British C.I.D.
Intervened in this afiair in France and Germany.</p>
<p>Equally romantic was the history of its distribution and
circulation ! The book reached India, America, Japan and
China wrapped in specially printed covers bearing fictitious
names such as ‘ Pickwick Papers ’ and ‘ Scott’s Works ’ and was
sold at a fabulous price at times of Rs. 300 for a copy. English-
men distributed copies of the book among their friends as a
rare gift ! Mr. Mahomed Ali obtained it on loan from
Sir Charles Cleveland ! European authors and historians
read the work with great interest. The work became the talk
of the world and since then it has gone through several
editions in various languages.</p>
<p>Echoes and effects of tlie great work were visible in 1914.
It inspired the second war of Indian Independence in 1914.
All the leaders of the Ghadr party who had launched the
Komagatamaru RebeUion had read the book with a religious
zeal, and had drawn undying inspiration from the work. More
tremendously did it influence the third war of Independence
imder the lead of Netaji Subhas Bose in 1943. The names of
the battalions and divisions, songs and slogans, spirit and
inspiration of the I.N.A. were derived from this holy book of
Savarkar. Mr. K. F. Nariman wrote in “ The Savarkar
Special ” of the Free Hindusthan Weekly, Bombay : “ The</p>
<p>idea of the I.N.A. and particularly the Rani of Jhansi Regi-
ment seems to have originated from Veer Savarkar’s proscrib-
ed publication on the great 1857 Revolution and Mutiny.”
Writing about it in the same number of the Free Hindvsthan,
Sri G. V. Subbarao, editor of Goshti, Bezawada, said : “ If</p>
<p>Savarkar had not intervened between 1857 and 1943, I am
sure that the recent efforts of the I.N.A. would have been
again dubbed as an ignoble mutiny effectively crushed by
the valiant British-ciun-Congress arms and armlessness ! But
thanks to Savarkar’s book, Indian sense of a * Mutiny ’ has
been itself revolutionised. And not even Lord Wavell, I
suppose, can now call the Bose effort a Mutiny ! The chief
credit for this change of values must go to Savarkar and to
him alone. And that is why I call him the sun of our Indian
firmament.” In between these two wars of Independence the
book has inspired innumerable martyrs and patriots who</p>
<p>62 SAVARKAR AND HIS TIMES</p>
<p>called it the Gita of the revolutionaries. Sardar Bhagat Singh
published this Gita in India for funds and propaganda. It
was also published in the German language in 1942 by the
Friends of India Society in Germany.</p>
<p>A great book is always bom of the brain and heart of a
great author and its greatness depends on the personality
which gives life to it. In this respect Savai&rsquo;kar belongs to the
line of Rousseau, Voltaire and Mazzini. They are master-
minds. Their type forms a dififerent category. They are gi&rsquo;eat
precursors of the coming storm, proclaimers of a new age and
originators of a revolution. To them literature is not a mere
ornament or entertainment for court life. Their literature
bums with a mission for making free citizens out of virtual
slaves. Their books are more dangerous than bombs. Their
books are as decisive as battles ! Rousseau’s Emile was burnt,
princes and potentates quailed before Voltaire and the Gov-
ernments of two countries suppressed Savarkar’s book even
before it had been published ! Rousseau, Voltaire and
Savarkar are not to be measured along with common authors !</p>
<p>This world-famous brilliant and moving work is a story of
hvunan emotions, passions and aspirations. The sweep of the
author’s narration is vivid and irresistible. The work reveals
the author’s rare gift as a poet-historian in action. ’Writing
about this book of Savarkeu&quot;, Sir Valentine Chirol in his
Indian Unrest has commented that it is “ a very remarkable
history of the Mutiny combining considerable research with
the grossest pei-version of facts and great literary power with
most savage hatred ! ” ^ Deduct Chirol’s venomous poison
and the uncommon beauty and grandeur of the book will glow
in its splendour ! That is why Sir Valentine Chirol in his
India Old and Neto depicts Savarkar with a loving hatred :</p>
<p>“ Savarkar, one of the most brilliant apostles of a later school
of revolt.” ^ Reviewing the great work, Sri P. K. Atre, a
typical Maharashtrian author and journalist opined that Maha-
rashtra did not produce a greater genius than Savarkar ever
since the great Dnyaneshwar.</p>
<p>The book continued to be proscribed for thirty-eight years.
Owing to the pressure of public opinion the Congress</p>

<p>THE STOBM BREAKS 63</p>
<p>Government released the book for publication when its mission
was almost fulfilled. The romantic story of the book is not,
however, yet complete. The original manuscript of this book
was in those stormy days of its birth sent to safe custody.
Mr. D. Y. Coutchino, a staxmch member of the Abhinava
Bharat, escaped to Portugal during those hectic days with the
manuscript through his influence at the Portuguese Embassy
and thence to America. Facing great difficulties and dangers
as an Indian revolutionary, he treasured it as a monumental
document for over thirty-eight years in Washington where
he is a professor in a college, and returned it to Savarkar
after India became free and independent. India lost another
great book by Savarkar. That is the History of the Sikhs
which Savarkar had finished in 1909. The manuscript of the
book was sent to India for publication but was gulped down
by the Indian Post Office in the transmission. It will be a
great deed of national importance, if the Government of India
or the Bombay Government, whichever may be in charge of
the book, restores the manuscript. The reason why Savarkar’s
books were proscribed or gulped down was that Savarkar was
to the British Government what Krishna was to Kaunsa or
Shivaji to Aurangzeb. The Government’s one obsession was
to crush ruthlessly whatever emanated from Savarkar’s brain.
“ Savarkar ” had become synonymous with “ sedition ”. The
British Government of India must have, however, found that
the Ganges was Savarkar’s inspiration, martyr’s blood was
his ink and bones of heroes were his pen ! The Ganges swept
away the British-make dams, the ink reddened the pages of
history and the pen immortalized the names of martyrs and
patriots, and damned the traitors for ever !</p>
<p>m</p>
<p>After Dhingra’s martyrdom threats grew louder. Clouds
hung heavier. Winds blew with a terrific speed. The storm
was coming on. Due to over-exertion, Savarkar’s health was
visibly impaired. Friends prevailed upon him to take rest in
Paris where he was ultimately taken for a change sometime
in January 1910. In Hindusthan his followers, comrades and
relations were persecuted, prosecuted, executed or exiled into</p>
<p>64 SAVASKAR AND HZS TIMES</p>
<p>the darkest Andamans. His elder brother was sent^ced to
transportation for life. His terrific transportation was avenged
by a spirited and lion*hearted youth named Anant Elanhere.
He shot dead Mr. A. M. T. Jackson, the then Collector of
Nasik, in the Vijayanand theatre of Nasik. Kanhere died on
the gallows with his two fearless comrades Deshpande and
Karve on the last day of the year 1909.</p>
<p>At this juncture an attempt was made on the life of the
Viceroy, Lord Minto, at Ahmedabad where a bomb was
thrown by someone from the revolutionary party. As a
result of the proceedings arisen out of this, Savarkar’s younger
brother Narayanrao Savarkar was arrested. All this news
fell heavily on Savarkar. He now prepared himself to stand
at the scene and save their persecution. Friends in Paris
entreated him not to return to London as news had filtered
into their ears that a warrant for his arrest was awaiting him
in London. His friends said to him, “As a general, you
must remain behind to lead. The danger is around you.” But
“ No,” said Savarkar, “ I cannot see the persecution of my
colleagues and followers. As a leader, I must face the music.”
To preach with life and not with mere lips, Savarkar left
Paris. He started to save his soul and lose his life. He loved
the former better. He was made of the stuff of mart 5 rrs. And
martyrdom can be a religion only with a few and not with the
whole party. His decision was as courageous as Shivaji’s
to go to Agra. And Shivaji started for Agra again !</p>
<p>It was Sunday, the 13th of March 1910. The train reached
Victoria station, London. Here had come the much dreaded
Savarkar at last, thought the London Police. The long
accumulated fury burst on him. No sooner did he step out
of the train than the policemen cried out : “ Here he is ! Here
he is ! ” And they arrested him. Perinben Captain, who
accompanied him, was let alone. The shadow of death was
galloping after him. In the eyes of the policemen he read
ruin. The day of his glory had come. The end also had
come with a crash. But who knew then that his end was
the beginning of the end of the British Empire ?</p>
<p>Savarkar was arrested imder a telegraphic warrant from
the Bombay Government under the Fugitive Offenders Act
of 1881. The warrant was granted by the Bow Street Court</p>
<p>THBSTOBUBRBAKS 65</p>
<p>on February 22, 1910. The charges against birn were as
under : —</p>
<p>(1) Waging Mrar or abetting the waging of war against His
Majesty the King Emperor pf India ;</p>
<p>(2) Conspiring to deprive His Majesty the King of the
sovereignty of British India or a part of it ;</p>
<p>(3) Procuring and distributing arms and abetting the
murder of Jackson ;</p>
<p>(4) Procvu-ing and distributing arms in London and waging
war from London ;</p>
<p>(5) Delivering seditious speeclies in India from January to
March 1906 and in London from 1908 to 1909.” ^</p>
<p>An Empire’s laws and system of justice are always soiled
by the blood of the martyrs. Savarkar went to England for
study under a regular passport from the Indian Government
and now he was arrested as a fugitive offender ! In 1910 he
was arrested in England for the speeches he made in India
in 1906 ! What a marvel this British process of law !</p>
<p>England has been the Mother of exiles. The knights-errant
of hberty have foimd shelter in England. Here is an impres-
sive roU-call : Mazzini, Marx, Garibaldi, Kossuth and Lenin.
If Savarkar had been content to conceal his unbounded hatred
of slavery and to pass as a reveller and degree-seeker, there
would have been ample scope for his brilliant genius and
flight of imagination. But no such pretension was possible
for him. So the mother of exiles did not receive him well.
The boast that England was the training ground for the
patriots of the world was reduced to a farce. It was true only
in the sense that England sheltered patriots only of those
coimtries over which their Balance of Power politics hung.
It was not a shelter for fearless freedom-loving Indian patriots
whose coimtry’s fate England had sealed ! The British took
Savarkar to be a Nanasahib sworn to overthrow their yoke,
a Guru Govind Singh in disguise or a Shivaji ready to foster
a rebeUion. So his life was a peril to the imperialists !</p>
<p>Gallows now stared Savarkar in the face. A terrible
vengeance was let loose on his followers. These ardent
patriots said they had come out to set their cotmtry free. And</p>
<ul>

</ul>
<p>5</p>
<p>^ SAVARKAR AND HIS TIMES</p>
<p>their leader in a befitting manner stood up at the peril of his
life to practise what he preached.</p>
<p>After the arrest Savarkar was taken into Bow Street Police
custody. He was now certain about the terrible fate that
would befall his family. In order to soften the severe blow
he wrote his last will and testament and sent it through his
solicitors to his noble sister-in-law, Shrimati Yashodabai,
Babarao’s wife, whom he had no chance to meet this side of
the grave. The testament represents the enormous stress of
emotion under which he was reeling. His family was plunged
in an irretrievable sorrow. His little son had just passed
away ! The eldest brother Babarao was sentenced to trans-
portation for life, the younger brother was in jail and he him-
self in the Brixton jail. So liis memory to the family was
fragrant. His glorious promise and the sudden separation
became the theme of their sorrow. This touched him to the
core. He expounded in his poetic will the noble and sublime
ideal for which the family had fallen. He reminded liis
sister ; —</p>
<p>“We will work and die in defence of Righteousness ;
thus had we pledged our words. Behold, the test has
come, we enter the flames. We have kept our word. . . .
We dedicated to Thee (Motherland) our thoughts ; our
speech and our eloquence we dedicated to Thee, O
Mother ! My lyre sang of Thee alone, my pen wrote of
Thee alone. . . . Thy cause is holy ! Thy cause I believed
to be the cause of God ! and in serving it I knew I served
the Lord ! . . . These are thy ideals ! Thou art hero’s
better half ! be thy life as supremely heroic. . . . Good-
bye, dear Vahini, Good-bye. . . . Convey my best love to
my wife and this : —</p>
<p>That it was certainly not blindness that goaded us on
to this path ! No ! we entered it under the full blaze of
the searching light of Logic, History and Human Nature :
knowing full well that a Pilgrim’s Progress leads through
the valley of Death, we took up our Cross and deliberately
followed Him,”</p>
<p>Savarkar was produced at the Bow Street Police Court on
March 14, 1910. After some postponements, on April 20, the</p>
<p>XHB STORM BBSAKS 67</p>
<p>Magistrate refused to release him on baiL Upon this Savarkar
was transferred from Bow Street Police Custody to Brixton
jail, wherein he had a famous friend. There an Englishman
by name Guy A. Aldred was also undergoing imprisonment
for having published Shyamji Krishna Varma’s fiery paper,
Indian Sociologist, suppressed by the British Government.
Aldred was the first Briton to suffer imprisonment for the
cause of India’s freedom ! Strangely enough, he had appeared
in the same dock, in the same court, before the same
Magistrate and had faced the same Chief Inspector of Police,
Mr. McArthy, and Mr. S. A. T. Rowlatt, Junior Counsel to the
Treasury, who later achieved notoriety in India. Savarkar’s
comrades saw him in the Brixton jail. Writing about his last
meeting with Savarkar in Brixton jail, Niranjan Pal states :
“ I asked Savarkar why he ignored our warnings and pleadings
and left Paris knowing full well that a former comrade had
turned an approver and a warrant for his arrest was awaiting
in London.” Pal adds ; “ Therefore, had Savarkar wished
it, he could easily have remained in safety and comfort in
the French Capital as other Indian revolutionists were doing
in those days. Instead he came to London to be arrested,
because, he told me, standing behind the iron-bars of Brixton
Prison, his shoulders were broad enough to bear the conse-
quences. He had the courage of his conviction.” ^</p>
<p>On May 12 the Magistrate gave his decision that Savarkar
should be sent to India for trial. Mr. Vaughan, counsel for
Savarkar made an application for a writ of Habeas Corpus.
The appeal made against the decision of the Bow Street Court
and this Habeas Corpus application were discussed on June
2 and 3 before the Divisional Court. The Chief Justice upheld
the decision of the Bow Street Court. Once again an appeal
was made against this decision to the Coiut of Appeal. But
the Chief Justice Vaughan Williams upheld the decision of the
Divisional Court and sympathetically handed Savarkar over
to the Indian Government which imder a special ordinance
had created a Special Tribunal in India for Savarkar’s trial.
Mr. Justice Coleridge dissented from sending Savarkar to
India but his decision was waived as a minority view.</p>
<p>1 Niranjan Pal, The Mahratta, dated 27-5-1938.</p>
<p>68 SAVARKAR AND HIS TIMES</p>
<p>In the meanwhile, somewhere in May 1910 Irish and Indian
revolutionaries also attempted at rescuing Savarkar while he
was an imdertrial prisoner. They lay in ambush awaiting
the police van which carried the illustrious prisoner to the
Court and back to the Prison. But it seems that the plan
leaked out and the police van which they waylaid turned out
to be a vacant one ! For Savarkar had been taken by a
different route. Savarkar’s other comrades also struggled
heroically for his release. Someone had thought out a plan
of impersonating Savarkar in his cell, but failed. They paid
their loyal homage to their leader. Savarkar was now on the
eve of being extradited to India. Therefore he thought it his
loving duty to bid farewell to his comrades in England and on
the Continent. This farewell is a masterpiece of patriotism,
humanism and duty ! It is an illustration of great poetry,
great ideas, great vision and great life ! It is as follows : —</p>
<p>The Farewell</p>
<p>“ Whose heart to heai t by silken ties is knit
Of friendship sweet, that sweeter grows by far,
Partaking of Godly Sacrament of Mother’s creed divine :
Oh friends ! Farewell ! as tender and fresh
As the morning dew that wakes the fragrance
Friends adieu ! adieu ! !</p>
<p>God-appointed Duty</p>
<p>We part to play our God-appointed parts
Now pent and nailed to burning Rocks, now tossed
On surging waves of Fame ; now seen now lost
Or humble or exalted — ^wherever posted by the Lord
Of Hosts, yet posted best, as if alone it was
The mission of our life thus there to act.</p>
<p>Historic Stage</p>
<p>As in some oriental play sublime.</p>
<p>All characters, the dead as well as living
In Epilogue they meet</p>
<p>Thus actors we innumerable all once more shall meet</p>
<p>THE STORM BREAKS</p>
<p>69</p>
<p>On History’s copious stage before the great
Applauding audience of Hmnanity
That would with grateful cheer fill hill and dale
Till then Oh loving friends, Farewell ! Farewell !</p>
<p>Humaotty to Guide</p>
<p>Wherever may my humble ashes lie
In the Andaman’s sad brook whose weeping course
Add to its dreariness a tongue or stored by Ganga’s
Sacred crystal stream in which the stars
Their midnight measures dance —</p>
<p>They will be stirred with fire and glow
When Victory’s trumpet, blasts proclaiming
‘ Shree Ram has crowned his chosen people’s brow
With laurels golden green ! The evil spirit is cast
Away and chased back to the deep from whence
It first arose ! and Lo ! She lordly stands,</p>
<p>Our Mother Ind, a beacon light Humanity to guide.
Oh martyred saints and soldiers, do awake !</p>
<p>The battle is won which you fought and fell !!</p>
<p>Till then Oh loving friends, farewell ! farewell !</p>
<p>Sacrifice a Law</p>
<p>Watch sleeplessly the progress of our mother
And learn to count it, not by so much work
Done or tried, but by how much they suffered.</p>
<p>What sacrifice our people could sustain !</p>
<p>For work is chance but sacrifice a law ;</p>
<p>Foundation firm to rear a mighty Dome
Of Kingdoms new and great !</p>
<p>But only great if their roots be in martyr’s ashes laid
Thus work for Mother’s glory till God’s breath
Be rendered back, the Godly mission done —</p>
<p>A martyr’s wreath or victor’s crown be won ! ! ” ^</p>
<p>The British Government thus gave a sigh of relief, like the
ferocious Aurangzeb, at having trapped Shivaji at last ; and
they shipped him off.</p>
