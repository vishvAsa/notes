      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bajirao&#34;&gt;bAji rAva&lt;/a&gt; pEshvA (= vishvanAtha after the grandpa = vishAji), son of peshva bAlAji vishvanAtha, excellent general, who vowed to fly the bhagva flag at aTTak, rescuer of chatrsAl, husband of &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastani&#34;&gt;mastAni&lt;/a&gt; (one wife too many), an alpha male. Died at age 40.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Legend has it that, standing tall, poised and confident before Shahu Maharaj and his court, the young new Peshwa Bajirao is said to have thundered:&lt;br&gt;&#xA;‘Let us transcend the barren Deccan and conquer central India. The Mughals have become weak indolent womanizers and opium-addicts. The accumulated wealth of centuries in the vaults of the north can be ours. It is time to drive from the holy land of Bharatvarsha the outcaste and the barbarian. Let us throw them back over the Himalayas, back to where they came from. The Maratha flag must fly from the Krishna to the Indus. Hindustan is ours..’ .&lt;br&gt;&#xA;R.C Majumdar “The History and Culture of the Indian People: The Maratha supremacy”&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;An able but hard to control general, whose initial impetuosity was tamed by bAji-rAv. He served under several successive peshvas - right up to mAdhavrAv - and was the major arm of the marATha-s in north India.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;An encounter with mAdhavrAv:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Just as he prepared to charge, Malharrao Holkar came up fleeing from the battle. He tried to dissuade Madhavrao and urged him to seek in Poona safety and a throne. The young prince turned on him on like a wounded tiger. &amp;ldquo;Then it is true&amp;rdquo; he said, &amp;ldquo;that you left Sadashivrao to die at Panipat?&amp;rdquo; Malharrao, stung to the quick, could but join his prince, and as the Mogol army advanced in the disorder of success, Madhavrao&amp;rsquo;s cavalry burst on them stabbing, sabring, trampling down all resistance. Few troops then in India could have stood that furious onset and the Mogol army, that but a moment before had had victory in their grasp, were hurled headlong into the Godavari. Twenty-one guns and 15 elephants were captured on the field of battle, and Naldurg fort and territory yielding 82 lakhs of rupees were paid by the Nizam as the price of peace. - Tale of the Tulsi Plant and Other Studies By C.A.
