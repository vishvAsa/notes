Nana's final advice to Raghoba, after pAnIpaT.

"Do not abandon the righteous path or ethical conduct. If Marathas or Muslims behave as per the traditions of their caste or community, do not discriminate against them. The Kingdom should not discriminate on the basis of the person's faith or his deity"
