  <meta property="og:description" content="GIVE up my Jhansi? I will not. Let him try to take who dares!&#34; With this challenge the heroic Ranee of Jhansi rose against the British and as it is recorded in previous parts of this History she assumed the leadership of the Revolution, drove the English and began to rule at Jhansi as the Queen of the province. The forces of the Revolution had wreaked a bloody vengeance on the English people and army and left not a trace of their rule at Sagar. Naogaon, Banda, Banapur, Shahgarh and Karki. The people everywhere hailed the Queen as their own. She then busied herself - in restoring order and peace in her liberated province. The Ranee’s daily life at this period has been described as follows :- “The Bai got up at five in the morning and took a bath with fragrant attar. After dressing - and she generally wore a Chanderi Saree of faultless white - she would sit for her daily prayers. First, she dropped the necessary water as a prayaschitta for keeping hair on her head after her husband’s death; then, she used to worship the Tulsi in the Tulsi grove. Then began the Parthiva Puja at which the Durbar musicians would sing in choir. Puraniks would then start reading the Puran. Then, Sirdars and dependants came and she returned their usual salutes. Being very keen of memory, even if a single man among the seven hundred and fifty who paid their respects to her in the morning was not present, the very next day, the Bai would not fail to inquire why he did not come the previous day. After the worship of God began the dinner. After dinner, she would take an hour’s siesta unless there was urgent work to do. Then she would order the presents of the morning to be brought before her, which was done on silver trays covered over with silk cloths. Those things that she liked, she accepted; the others were given over to the Kothiwalla (minister of the presents department) for distribution amongst her servants. At three she went to the Durbar, when she usually put on male attire. She wore a pyjama, a coat of dark blue, a cap on the heat, and a beautiful turban on the top of it, a dupeta of embroidered cloth round the slender waist, and the sword decked with gems by her side. Attired in this wise, this fair woman looked like Gauri herself. Sometimes, she wore the female dress. After her husband’s death, she never wore nath or similar ornaments. Her hands had round them bangles of diamond; she wore a small necklace of pearls round her neck and a diamond ring on her little finger. These were the only jewels worn by the Bai Sahib. Her hair was gathered up together behind. She wore a white saree and a plain white bodice. Thus, sometimes in male attire and sometimes in female, the Bai Sahib used to honour the Durbar by her presence. Those assembled in Durbar never used to see her person. For the room in which she sat was separate from, and only opened into, the Durbar hall. Gold carving adorned the doors, and over these fell gracefully the chintz curtain, embroidered with gold cloths. In this room sat the Bai Sahib on a gadi of soft down, leaning on a soft pillow. Outside the door, two pages with maces of silver and sold always attended. Opposite the room, Lakshman Rao Dewanji stood with a bundle of important documents in his hand, and beyond him sat the Registrars of the Durbar. Being very keen and intelligent, the Bai quickly grasped every matter brought before her, and her orders were clear and definite and to the point. Sometimes she wrote her orders out herself. She was very careful in affairs of justice, and decided civil and criminal cases alike with great ability. Ranee Sahib worshipped Mahalakshmi devoutly. The temple of that Goddess was situated on the banks of a lake filled with lotus flowers, and every Friday and Tuesday the Bai visited the temple. One day, it so happened that after the Bai had returned from the temple and was passing through the south gate, she was thousands of beggars blocking the passage and creating a disturbance. So, she inquired of the Minister, Lakshman Rao Pande, the reason of this. He inquired and informed her that the people were very poor, and that they suffered immensely on account of excessive cold, and that, therefore, they requested that the Bai would kindly consider their condition. The Bai left very grieved for these poor people, and she at once issued orders - kind-hearted that she was - that, on the fourth day from thence, a gathering of beggars should take place, where every one should be provided with a thick coat and a cap and a blanket either white or black. The very next day, all the tailors of the town were given orders to make caps and coats. On the day appointed it was proclaimed that all the beggars were to gather in front of the palace. Poor people, too, had been included in his gathering. All were given clothes by the Bai and they went away satisfied In the fight with Nathe Khan when the wounded men were brought into the city, the Bai herself would insist on being present when their wounds were being dressed. Her very presence soothed their pain, and they felt themselves sufficiently rewarded by the kind and sympathetic interest she took in their well-being. The Ranee grieved at their grief, gave them ornaments and medals, patted them, and showed such sympathy that others, instead of being disheartened at the sight of these wounded soldiers, felt that they could even give up their lives for the sake of the Ranee. The grandeur of the Bai’s processions passes description. On the occassions of the visits to the temple of Mahalakshmi, she started sometimes in a palanquin, and sometimes on horseback. When in the palanquin, the palanquin would be covered with curtains of gold and embroidered cloths tied with golden ribbon. When she was on horseback, in male attire, the end of a thin and beautiful batti floated on her back and it fitted her admirably. The national flag of freedom was carried before her, with the band playing military music. Two hundred Europeans followed the flag and a hundred horsemen rode before and behind her. With the palanquin came the karbharis, ministers, feudatories, and other officers like Bhayya Sahib Upasane; and others either rode or followed on foot. Sometimes troops accompanied the procession. When the Bai started from the palace, the choughada on the fort made sweet music. The choughada of the nagarkhana of Mahalakshmi started at the same time.“54 And thus, from the Vindhyas to the Jumna, there was not a vestige of British authority left, Brahmins, Moulvies, Sirdars, Dorkdars, Sepoys, the police, Rajas, Raos, bankers, villagers - all were desirous fighting for only one thing, and that was Independence! And to unite together these thousand voices in one harmonious whole, the Lakshmi of Jhansi declared with her sweet but firm voice “None can have my Jhansi; he who dares may try!” Very rarely had the world heard such a firm “No!” Generous and liberal to a fault India has always been pronouncing and swearing by “I shall give!”, “I shall give!”, so far. But here was a strange phenomenon to-day - a set face and a stern voice which said, “I will not give! I will not give up my Jhansi!” Would to heaven, O Mother, that every one of thy sons and daughters had said the same! The Feringhi was taken aback at this unexpected assertion; and Sir Hugh Rose was sent, with five thousand armed men and a considerable number of guns, to gauge the extent of the disturbance and to quell it. In the beginning of 1858, the English had drawn up a complete military plan for the reconquest of all the territory, from the Himalayas to the Vindhyas, which was under the Revolutionaries. The whole territory was divided into two portions, and to each of them a huge army was sent to subdue it. We have in an earlier chapter described how commander-in- chief Sir Colin Campbell marched upwards from Allahabad to the north of the Ganges and the Jumna and, with his big army, conquered the Doab, and crossed the Ganges and marches on Lucknow; how, after destroying Lucknow, he extinguished the flames of insurrection ranging in Behar, in Benares and round if, and in Oudh; how he forced all the Revolutionaries 54 D.B.Parasnis’s Life of Lakshmi Bai, paged 147-151. into Rohilkhand, where the final engagement took place, and how, thus, the northern portion of the territory which was in the hands of the Revolutionaries was reconquered by the English. While Sir Colin was advancing from the north of the Jumna towards the Himalayas, Sir Hugh Rose advanced to conquer the southern portion lying between the Jumna and the Vindhyas. In the north, the Sikhs, the Gurkhas, and other Indian troops and feudatories had joined Sir Colin; so also in the south, Sir Hugh Rose had on his side the help of the princes of Hyderabad, Bhopal, and other states. He had, in addition, got the valuable assistance of the troops of Madras and Bombay and the Hyderabad contingent. To mention specially that the Indian troops had joined Sir Hugh Rose is unnecessary. For, to mention that Sir Hugh Rose was successful would imply the first proposition. For the English to obtain a victory, of themselves, is as impossible as the most impossible thing in the world. The traitorous Indian troops thus collected together for conquering the southern parts were divided into two divisions. One was under the command of Brigadier Whitlock who was to start from Jubbulpore and, subduing the provinces on the way, was eventually to join Sir Hugh Rose. The other was under Sir Huge Rose himself. As soon as Whitlock started from Jubbulpore, Sir Hugh was also to start from Mhow; he was to advance through Jhansi on Kalpi. According to the plan of campaign, Sir Huge started from Mhow on the 6th of January 1858 and, after a fight, he captured the fort of Rajgarh. From thence, he advanced to Sagar, released the prisoners kept there by the Revolutionaries, advanced further south, reducing various positions of the enemy on the way, captured Banapur on the 10th of March, and reconquered the famous fort of Chanderi. On the 20th of March, the triumphant English army encamped about fourteen miles from Jhansi. By these many struggles, bands of Revolutionaries distributed all over the country from the banks of the Narbada upwards, now crowded into Jhansi; and that is why Sir Hugh advanced with great dispatch on Jhansi to reduce this stronghold of the Revolutionaries. But Lord Canning and Sir Colin both issued orders to Sir Hugh first to relieve the Raja of Charkhari who was being besieged by Tatia. This order, if he obeyed it, would have spoiled Sir Hugh’s plan of reducing Jhansi. What was he to do? He could neither disobey nor find his way to obey the orders. As, in these trying circumstances, the best interests of the British government lay in advancing on Jhansi, Sir Robert Hamilton took upon himself the whole responsibility of disobeying the orders of the two highest authorities in Hindusthan; and the British army, emboldened by a high national feeling, advanced towards Jhansi, hopeful of victory. But the English army suffered enormously as soon as they set foot on the soil of Jhansi. For they found, to their great surprise, that all the tract of land surrounding Jhansi had been laid waste by order of the Queen in orderthat the enemy should have no supplies of any sort. Not a blade of corn in the fields, not a vestige of grass on the meadows, not a tree which could afford shelter; So had William of Orange, when there appeared to be a possibility of the Netherlands falling into the hands of the Spanish tyrant and invader, ordered that the dykes be opened and the sea let in, rather than that the country should fall in the hands of the enemy. And this day Jhansi had adopted a similar course. The same terrible thunder is in her voice; her eyes are spouting forth the red flames of anger! Mardan Singh, Raja of Banapur, the enraged chief of Shahagarh, the brave Thakurs, with their lives in their hands, Sirdars of Bundelkhand, resolute as ever, with their many followers - all these hot incendiary elements in the interior of Jhansi are burning and flame-red. The flames leap up even as the Jaripatka; and look, the central figure of the whole fight is there, shining above all! Aye, she is the central idea, the flashing impersonation of Swaraj! She is the inspiration, she is the incarnation of Liberty! In spite of the barrenness of the country around, the English approached Jhansi. For, thanks to the loyalty of the Scindia and the Raja of Tehri, the force was throughout the operations abundantly supplied with grass, firewood, and vegetables.55 As the Scindia and the Raja of Tehri are helping the Feringhis, surrounded as you are by treachery and disloyalty, betrayed by relations as by strangers, you have not the slightest hope of success. Why not then avoid extinction by surrendering to the English? But, surrender? And for the Ranee of Jhansi? Dewan Lakshman Rao, Moro Punt Tambe, brave Thakurs and Sirdars, all heroes of Liberty, if you surrender, you will be saved; if you fight, you will die. Which will you choose? Jhansi answered from her thousand mouths, sternly, in the words of the Scripture, “As everyone who is born must die, why sully fair fame uselessly?” So, it was determined to give battle to the English for the honour of the country. And Jhansi was busy by night and by day preparing for the fight. Brave men, there were many in her army; but trained men, there were very few. Want of discipline was very apparent. The queen herself, however, let the whole army. On every rampart and every gate, she was moving about actively; she was standing where guns were being planted and moved into position; she was budy selecting clever gunners; and she was to be found everywhere inspiring heroism even in the coldest hearts. The learned Brahmins of Jhansi were praying for the success of the country. Its temples blessed the soldier who went to the field, and tended the wounded who returned from battle; its workmen were busy preparing ammunition and other necessary for war. The men of Jhansi manned their guns, loaded the muskets; its women carried ammunition, built Top Khanas, supplied provisions.56 When the night of the 23rd fell, sounds of battle- drums were heard throughout the town and lighted torches shone forth at frequent intervals from the fort. The guards fired a few shots too. The 55 Malleson’s Indian Mutiny, Vol. V, page 110. 56 “The women were seen working in the batteries and carrying ammunition, etc.”- Sir Hugh Rose. morning of the 24th approached. No more delay now! The Ghanagarj (thunder-clap) gun began its work. The noise made by that gun was terrific. We shall quote an eye witness’s account of the early stages of the siege. “From the 25th, the engagement began in right earnest. The enemy poured in a heavy fire all day and night. In the night came cannon- balls on the forst and the city. The sight was terrible to see. A cannon-ball of fifty or sixty pounds weight would look as small as a tennis ball but red like live charcoal. During the day one would not see these balls clearly for daylight, but in the night, they were clearly visible and gave a weird appearance to the night. On the 26th, at midday, the English silenced the guns on the southern gate, and not a man could make a stand there. All men in the field were nearly disheartened at this. Then, the gunner on the western gate moved the gun round and fired at the enemy; the third shot killed the best gunner in the English army, and the English gun was silenced, in its turn. At this, the Bai Sahib was very pleased and presented the gunner with a silver anklet. The name of the brave gunner was Gulam Ghose Khan. He had displayed similar skill in the engagement with Nathe Khan also. “On the fifty or the sixth day, the same sort of engagement took place. For four or five hours, the Bai’s guns were working wonders and the English lost heavily. Many of their guns, too, were silenced for some time. Then again, the English guns would be more vigorous, and the Jhansi troops would be disheartened and their guns silenced. On the seventh day, at sunset, the gun to the left was disabled. None could stand there. The battlement was destroyed owing to the enemy’s fire. But in the night, eleven masons were brought under cover of blankets to the walls of the fort, and the work was completed before the day dawned. Thus, the battlement was repaired, and the English, to their great surprise, found the Jhansi gun in working order. At this time, the English were careless. They suffered considerably and their guns were disabled for quite a long time. “On the morning of the eighth day, the English army went for Shankar Killa. The English had very expensive and modern telescopes and, with their aid, they began to pour a heavy fire on the reservoir of water within the fort. Of the six or seven who approached near for taking water, four were killed: the others ran leaving their vessels there. As they could not get water for nearly four hours, even baths and other ordinary functions could not be carried on. Now, the gunners on the western and southern gates stopped the guns of the English attacking the Shankar Killa, by a continued fire on them. Then it became possible to get water from the reservoir for bath and dinner. There was a powder factory in the tamarind grove. As soon as two maunds of powder was prepared, it was taken to the sellers to be stocked. A cannon- ball fell on the factory, and thirty men and eight women were killed. On the same day, there was a great turmoil. There was a terrible fight. The fighters were shouting loudly. There was a terrific noise from muskets, and guns firing heavily. Trumpets and bugles were sounding everywhere. Dust and smoke filled the air. Many gunners on the ramparts and a number of Sepoys were killed. Others were appointed in their place. The Bai Sahib was working very hard. She looked to everything, issued the necessary orders, and repaired every point of weakness. By this, the men in the army were very much encouraged and fought continually. On account of this determined resistance, the English, in spite of all their powder and ammunition, could not enter the fort till the 31st of March.“57 But pressed as she is by this constant succession of disasters, why is Queen Lakshmi looking so earnestly in that particular direction? And see, she is smiling too! Be ready now and fire your salutes; let triumphal drums beat loudly; let war-cries rend the air! For there is Tatia Tope advancing with his army to aid Jhansi! 57 D.B.Parasnis’s Life of Lakshmi Bai, pages 187-193. with his twenty-two thousand troops. While playing as children, people hardly noticed them; to-day, the whole world is looking on their game! Tatia Tope has come with his army to dishearten the English army and to give courage to Jhansi. After the defeat of Wyndham at Cawnpore and Sir Colin’s victory, Tatia crossed the Ganges and joined Shrimant Nana. Then, leaving Nana, he crossed the Jumna near Kalpi. As the Raja of Charkhari refused to help in the war for the country started by the Peshwa, Tatia, as representative of the Peshwa, attacked his capital, punished the traitor well, captured twenty-four of his guns, and took from him a contribution of three lacs of Rupees. And then Tatia turned towards Kalpi. There, he received a letter from Ranee Lakshmi Bai requesting him to come to Jhansi and relieve the siege. He sent the note to the Rao Sahib Peshwa, the chief in authority; and, as soon as he got the orders, he charged the rear of the English army. It is on seeing him that a smile of hope has come to the lips of Lakshmi. These two had played together as children in the palace at Brahmavarta, without anyone noticing them particularly. To- day they are playing on the battle-field; the one, on the fortifications of Jhansi, is standing amidst rings of flaming fire, the other is approaching close to the Betwa, with his twenty-two thousand troops. While playing as children, people hardly noticed them; to-day, the whole world is looking on their game! Tatia had under him, now, the largest number of troops he ever had, and hence the English were not a little disconcerted. They would have been completely so in the battle too, handful as they were. For, in front of them was the Ranee Lakshmi Bai; behind them was this Mahratta tiger, with his twenty-two thousand claws. Why should he not, then, tear Sir Hugh to pieces and eat him up? He advanced to do this, but his twenty-two thousand claws seemed all of a sudden disabled, they could hardly be lifted. And what could even a tiger do without his claws? Alas! A most shameful poltroonish cowardice was exhibited by the Revolutionary troops on the river Betwa. The army of Jhansi was to attack the rear, and Tatia was to attack the front; the plan was admirable. But the English, with the dash of despair, advanced on Tatia and opened fire on Jhansi. This nullified the two attacks of the aggressive party. One determined attack, like that of the Mawalas of Shivaji or the select band of Kumar, and vultures had fed upon the Union Jack and its followers. But, the English charged straight on the enemy. The cowards did not even offer fight, and - was it treachery or terror - not a cannon-shot from Jhansi was heard. So, the army and its commander were routed and ran away. Plentiful military supplies were captured by the English, Tatia’s guns fell into their hands, and one thousand and five hundred of the Revolutionaries were killed in the pursuit. Fifteen hundred people killed in the flight! Mad men and fools! Instead of dying the death of cowards while fleeing, if you had only attacked Sir Huge Rose, you would have died the death of the Ghazis of Bareillyk, you would have destroyed the whole army with Sir Hugh Rose, and your name would have lived for ever! Yet God forgive you! If not our respect, you deserve at least our sympathy. For, howsoever you died, you died for the liberty of your country! May my country learn from your death at least the lesson that soldiers who fly to live, die, and that those who fight to die, live! And for death was Ranee Lakshmi Bai fighting! Why, then, this hopelessness on the part of Sirdars, Thakurs, and Sepoys? For nine days and nine nights, you stood the deadly charge of gun-fire in the hope that Tatia Tope would soon come to your aid. When he came, you shouted for delight; by the defeat of Tatia on the 1st of April, not only that joy but the very hope of victory is dashed to pieces; and those supplies, to deprive the enemy of which thousands of lives had been sacrificed, have fallen with ease into the enemy’s hands. Tatia’s ammunition and guns also have fallen into their hands. All this is certainly true. But, why this despair? The enemy may render it impossible for you to live victorious, but he cannot deprive you of a death of glory. There is nothing to despair for, then! And stop, hear the steady, firm, courageous voice of Ranee Lakshmi. “It was not relying on the Peshwa that Jhansi fought so long nor does she require his help to continue her fight in the future. So far, your bravery have been exhibited by you most admirably. I urge to do the same now and to fight with courage and desperation.” Aye, fight with desperation, be ready, let the battle-drums beat, and the trumpets sound! Let was-cries rend the air and let big guns thunder forth! The 3rd of April has dawned and the last assault of the English on Jhansi has begun. They are coming from all sides and pressing hard. Start, then, in right, good, deadly earnest! See how the goddess of war has taken the sword and see how she is making her way through the troops. She is moving about with lightning rapidity, presenting some with golden bracelets, some with dresses; some she is touching with her sacred touch to pat, to some she is offering her sweet smile; others she is encouraging with her heroic words. So now! Gulam Ghose Khan and Kuar Khuda Bhaksh, let the fire be most deadly! The enemy is storming the main gate and the fortifications, ladders have been planted at eight different places. “Har, Har, Mahadev!” From the fort, from ramparts, and from houses came a perfect shower of bullets, a constant succession of shots. The deep-mouthed cannon are vomiting forth burning red-hot balls. “Maro Feringhiko!” Lieutenant Dick and Lieutenant Meiklejohn have mounted the ladders and are calling upon their men to follow them. Boom, boom! Instantly, the daring Englishmen fell in the jaws of death! Anyone coming behind? Lieutenant Bonus and heroic Lieutenant Fox, you seem anxious for death - your desire shall be accomplished; - die, then! Seeing these four heroes who had scaled with the greatest difficulty shot down, the ladders trembled. They swayed and broke under the weight of the English troops. The English sounded the bugle to retire; the army began to go back - it went back, the soldiers concealing themselves behind every stray stone!58 58 “No sooner did we turn into the road leading towards the gate, than the enemy’s bugle sounded, and a fire of indescribabl e fierceness opened upon us from the whole line of the walls and from the tower of the fort overlooking this site. For a time it appeared like a sheet of fire, A strong defence was thus offered at the principal gate. But who is giving forth that tragic wail near the southern ramparts? May it be that mean treachery had lost the Morcha gate? Yes, unfortunately yes; the English have captured the gate, with the air of treachery - so it is said - and they have mounted the ramparts, and are advancing rapidly on. There was no other thought that day but to kill or be killed! Once within the city, the English gave no quarter and streams of blood flowed freely. The English, taking one position after another, massacring, firing, destroying - came right up to the palace. As soon as the palace was forced, thousands of Rupees were looted, guards were massacred, and buildings were destroyed. At last, alas! Jhansi had fallen into the enemy’s hands! Standing on the rampartrs, the Ranee looked back for one moment at Jhansi. Before her rose the hideous picture of the terrible disaster that had happened near the south gate. The enemy had, after all, defiled her Jhansi! Her eyes were ablaze with anger; she was almost mad with rage. She took up her sword and, with her small force of a thousand or fifteen hundred men, she marched down the fort. The tigress to avenge her cubs runs not so fleetingly. As soon as she saw the white troops near the southern gate, she rushed for them, and then, “swords crossed, the two armies were mixed up before you could count even fifty; swords flourished and dealt heard blows. Many Englishmen were killed. The rest ran towards the town and began to fire shots from under cover!” By this sight of Feringhi blood, the anger of this Kali was a little appeased, and now she saw that it was foolhardy to fight alone so far from the fort. But echoes of such daring heroism were now to be heard in every street in the city. Fifty stablemen in the palace, while the whole town and the palace itself was bathed in blood shed by English out of which burst a store of bullets, round shots, and rockets destined for our annihilation…… But the fire of the enemy waxed stronger, and amidst the chaos of sounds, of volleys of musketry and roaring of cannon, hissing and bursting rockets, stink-pots, infernal machines, huge stones, blocks of wood, and trees, all hurled upon our heads, it seemed as though Pluto and the Furies had been loosened upon us, carrying death amongst us fast. At this instant a bugle sounded on our right for the Europeans to retire.” – Lowe’s Central India, page 254. swords, refused to give up the stables! “Surrender” was a word not to be found in their dictionary. Everyone of these men cut down the enemy as hard as he could, and it was only when everyone of them was killed that the paga fell into the enemy’s hands! The English had, by now, rendered the whole town desolate. Everyone who fell into their hands, from children of five to old men of eighty, were massacred; the whole city was set fire to; wailings from the wounded and the dying, and the cries of those who killed, filled the air. A huge wail rose from the whole town! When the Queen stood on the walls of the fortress (which the enemy had decided to storm only the next day on account of its strength), looking at this sad, sad picture, she was smitten with grief and tears started to her eyes! The Queen of Jhansi wept! Those beautiful eyes were red with weeping! Her Jhansi to be reduced to this! Then she looked up and saw the flag of the Feringhi flying over the walls of Jhansi, and a strange fire shone from those weeping eyes! All glory to her courage! But why is this messenger running hard towards her? He said, “Your Majesty, the pre- eminently brave Sirdar who guarded the chief gate of the fort, Sirdar Kuar Khuda Buksh, and Gulam Ghose Khan, the chief gunner of the artillery, have both been shot down by the English!” What a blow this to the already afflicted Queen! What a succession of disasters this! What is your next plan, then, Queen? Aye, one and one alone! She said to the messenger, who was no other than an old Sirdar, &#34; I have determined to blow myself up with the fort, setting fire to the ammunition with my own hands.” With her Jaripatka she must be - if not on the throne, at least on the pyre! Hearing this, the old Sirdar calmly replied, “Your Majesty, as it is not safe to be in this neighbourhood now, your Majesty should leave the fort to-night breaking through the enemy’s camp and should join the Peshwa’s forces. If death comes on the way, the conquest of heaven by a dip in the sacred waters of the battle-field is always at hand!” Lakshmi said, “I should choose to die on the battle-field, but, being a woman, I fear that the enemy might insult my person!” To this the whole Durbar answered with one voice: “Insult! So long as there is life in the body of the least among us, our sword shall cut to pieces the enemy who woulod dare so much as touch your sacred person!” Well then, the night had fallen; Lakshmi greeted all her dear subjects and gave them her blessings for the last time! Her subjects were full of tears at the thought that she was leaving Jhansi, perhaps for ever. She took a selected number of horsemen with her. An elephant with jewels on him was placed in the middle and Ranee Lakshmi descended the fort amidst cries of “Har, Har, Mahadev!” She put on male apparel; a steel armour covered her person, a Jammia was in her girdle; a fine sword hung from her belt, a silver cup was in her Pudder, and her adopted child Damodar was on her back, tied in silk Dhoti. Thus accoutred, riding on a noble white steed, this queen, Lakshmi, looked like the goddess of war. When the north gate came, the sentry who belonged to the traitor army of the Tehri State asked, “Who goes there?” “The army of Tehri is going to the aid of Sir Huge Rose,” was the answer. The sentry was satisfied and Ranee advanced, evading the English sentry too in a similar manner. One maid, one bargeer, and ten or fifteen horsemen formed her body-guard, and marched through the camp of the enemy. But her other horsemen were stopped by the English on suspicion and had to fight hard. Moro Punt Tambe, wounded though he was, was able to run as far as Datia. But the traitor Dewan of that State captured him and gave him over to the English, who later on hanged him. But, Lakshmi, put your horse now in a gallop. For Lieutenant Bowker is galloping behind, followed by select horsemen, in order to capture you. And you, O horse, fortunate on account of the sacred treasure you carry, gallop on! Let the men of Bharata be traitors, but, ye animals, ye at least be faithful! O Night, drop the curtain of darkness between Queen Lakshmi and her enemies ! O horse, fleeting as you are, quicker than the wind, balance Lakshmi lightly! Ye paths, do not obstruct the horse’s onward march! O ye stars, shine not for the enemy, but just shine so that this tender beauty, delicate as a flower, should be encouraged on the way by your rays, cool as nectar! The dawn has now broken; so, heroic Queen, flying all night on the wings of the wind, rest thee near the village of Bhandeir. The Mahalkuree of the village will feed your darling Damodar. As soon as breakfast was over, she again started on her journey on the Kalpi road. But what is this dust behind? Spur your horses on! Lakshmi, keep Damodar safe on the back and gallop on. Tak our your sword! There, Bowker is pressing close! Here is the reward for your wicked pursuit! Dare you hold back the lightning? A long sweep of her sword, and Bowker was violently thrown off his horse. A deadly fight took place between her fifteen or twenty horsemen and the English pursuers; those who were alive advanced forward to protect Lakshmi Bai. Wounded Bowker and his handful of men gave up the pursuit. The sword of the Mother advanced triumphant, shining. The sun in the heaven above, Ranee Lakshmi Bai on earth - both were marching forward. Morning was gone and mid-day came, but the Ranee did not stop. Afternoon came, the shades of evening began to fall, the sun went down the horizon - but the Ranee still would not stop. The stars rose. They saw her just as they had seen her the night before - marching, marching in hot haste. At last, at midnight, Ranee Lakshmi entered Kalpi. A ride of a hundred and two miles she accomplished, and that, fighting with Lieutenant Bowker and his soldiers and with the burden of a child on her back. That horse just lived, it so seemed, to carry her to Kalpi. For, as soon as he saw the rider safe in Kalpi, he fell down on the ground all in a heap. Six men were immediately ordered to attend to the horse. The Ranee loved the horse very much. A horse which carried safe such a person with such faithfulness deserves to be remembered, and his memory will be loved for all time. The Ranee slept till dawn. In the morning, the touching meeting between the Ranee and Shri Rao Sahib Peshwa took place. Both remembered their ancestors - the thought that they were descended from those who had done such seemingly impossible deeds inspired them both. They realised that the flag of the Mahratta empire waved as far as Attock because men like the Scindia and the Holkar, the Gaekwar and Bundela and Patwardhan were ready to give up their lives for Swaraj. And for that very flag, for that very Swaraj for which their fathers and grandfathers had bled, they resolved to continue uninterrupted, to the very last breath of their lives, the war already begun against those who attempted to enslave their motherland. So, they resolved to carry on the war as vigorously as ever. And again did Lakshmi Bai and the brave Tatia Tope begin to make preparations for the coming deadly fight. While these arrangements are going on there, we shall take a rapid glance at the activities of Brigadier Whitlock whom we had left sometime back. To reconquer the tract between the Narbada and the Ganes and the Jumna, two armies had started and, of these, the one under Sir Hugh Rose, as we had already seen, had taken Jhansi. When Jhansi was taken, the British indulged in a wholesale looting such as Nadir Shah alone had accomplished before, defiling of temples and polluting of images, and massacring terribly all alike. That finished, the army continued the campaign. The last part of the campaign had been appointed for Brigadier Whitlock to accomplish. Accordingly, Brigadier Whitlock started on the 17th of February from Jubbulpore, with all his army - European regiments, Indian regiments from Madras, “black” and white cavalry, and splendid artillery. He entered Sagar in triumph, where the loyal Raja of Oorcha joined him. The, the English army began to advance on the Nabob of Banda, the chief leader of the Revolutionaries in that province. In the beginning of the Revolution at Jhansi, Sagar, and other places, cruel massacres had taken place and the Europeans from those places ran wherever they could to save their lives. The Nabob had brought them to his palace and was looking after them well. But, at the same time, he was as busy in trying to throw off the British yoke already tottering through the shocks of the Revolution as he was in saving the lives of these Enbglishmen. From the very beginning, the symbols of slavery in his kingdom had been smashed and he was runing as an independent prince. Seeing the English army coming to deprive him of his liberty, the Nabob, urged and aided by the whole populace, was ready for battle. Several engagements took place between the two parties, but, being defeated in them, the Nabob started for Kalpi with his army, and Whitlock entered Banda in triumph on the 19th of April. The next march was to be on the Rao of Kirwi. Rao Madhav Rao of Kirwi was a child of ten and his guardianship was in the hands of the English. The Rao of Kirwi was a near relation of Baji Rao Peshwa. In 1827, Anant Rao, the then ruler of Kirwi, deposited two lakhs of Rupees with the English Government for some charities in connection with the temples of Benares. As soon as he died, the English swallowed the whole amount. More than that, they took unlawful possession of a further sum of several lakhs of Rupees foolishly deposited with them by Anant Rao’s son, Vinayak Rao, in spite of the lesson he had already received. This was soon after Vinayak Rao’s death. Rao Madhav, the adopted son of Vinayak Rao, being a minor, as the supervision of the whole state was in the hands of the English, and Ramachandra Rao, the chief Karbhari, had been appointed by the English, there was every reason to suppose that there would not be much fear of revolt in the Kirwi State. But, in 1857, whatever the Raos and Maharaos did was not quietly acquiesced in by the people. Sometimes obsecurely and sometimes clearly, the power of the people, the strength of the real nation, was slowly struggling into prominence. The Zemindars, the priests, the merchants of Kirwi, nay, even the common people, inspired by the strong ideal of liberty, hailed with joy the news which one day proclaimed Delhi free and the next day Lucknow and the third that Jhansi had uprooted the flags of the Feringhi. Encouraged by these hopeful incidents, they proclaimed the independence of Kirwi and the destruction of the alien yoke, not waiting for the opinion of the Rao or the sanction of his ministers. Now, while this proclamation was being loudly celebrated by the populace, the Rao, a boy of nine or ten, had not done even a single thing against the English! Nay, when the English army returned to Bundelkhand, he went forward to receive them and invited them into the city. According to his invitation, the English army entered the city silently, but they entered to imprison this little Rao, to destroy his capital and to pull down his palace! Dreadful looting,59 wholesale burning, and a vengeance of wickedness took place. And the State was annexed. Whitlock now encamped at Mahoba, in order to ‘pacify’ the conquered provinces. As a matter of fact, he had now completed his campaign. He had conquered all the eastern part of Bundelkhand and he had sent small expeditions to ‘pacify’ one or two places. So now, leaving Whitlock, let us again follow the sacred steps of the gallant Queen of Jhansi. The Ranee, now again full of hope, made an advance on Kunchgaon, forty-two miles from Kalpi, with the army of te Peshwa. But the Rao Sahib, if would appear, had not arranged the forces as she would have liked him to. It must be borne in mind, however, that it was not possible to make effective arrangements, either for Rao Sahib or Tatia Tope. Though in that place, the Nabob of Banda, the Raja of Shahgarh, and the Raja of Banapur had all gathered together under the same flat, they had not gathered together as the organised and disciplined parts of a grand military force, moved by oneness of heart, with a unity of plan and constitution, sustained by strict military discipline and subordination. No one could get his ideas carried out. But, in the opposing army, there was no such conflict amongst leaders. It seemed that the whole organisation was perfect and wellcontrolled. Before Sir Hugh Rose was appointed commander, there was heated discussion and difference of opinion; but, once he was the 59 “With regard to this injustice done to Rao, Malleson has to confess : “Not a shot had been fired against him (Whitlock), but he resolved nevertheless to treat the young Rao as though he had actually opposed the British forces. The reason for this perversion of honest dealing lay in the fact that in the palace of Kirwi was stored the wherewithal to compensate soldiers for many a hard fight and many a broiling sun. In its vaults and strong rooms were specie, jewels, and diamonds of priceless value….. The wealth was coveted.” – Kaye and Malleson’s Indian Mutiny, Vol. V, pages 140,141. commander, his opinion was the opinion of all. Whatever orders he issued were right; and, even if they were not right, they must be obeyed. And even mistaken orders of a weak general carried out by the obedient and unanimous bravery of the troops under him, become successful – are bound to become successful. On the other hand, even well-planned orders of a capable general lead to disaster and defeat, through the self-willed behaviour of the troops and the lack of oneness in command and proper subordination. Otherwise the rout at Kunchgaon could never have been place. As soon as Sir Hugh Road came from Jhansi, the Revolutionaries met him at Kunchgaon. Knowing that the mid-day sun was unbearable to the English, the Revolutionaries had ordered in one of their commands, “None should engage in a fight with the Feringhis before ten in the morning. The fight should begin always after ten.” This very clever rule was put into practice this day. Much havoc was thereby created in the English army as happened on many other occasions where the fight took place after ten. But, in spite of this, the Revolutionaries were defeated at Kunchgaon and retired towards Kalpi. The admirable way in which they retired, the organised manner in which they fell back has been praised very much even by the enemy.60 But then this excellent organisation came after and not before the engagement. 60 “Then was witnessed action on the part of the rebels which impelled admiration from their enemies. The manner in which they conducted their retreat could not be surpassed. They remembered the lessons which the European officers had well taught them. There was no hurry, no disorder, no rushing to the rear. All was orderly as on a field-day. Though their line of skirmishers was two miles in length, it never wavered in a single point. The men fired, then ran behind the relieving men, and loaded. The relieving men then fired, and ran back in their turn. They even attempted, when they thought the pursuit was too rash, to take up a position, so as to bring on it an enfilading fire.” - Malleson’s Indian Mutiny, Vol. V, page 124. With this defeat, the Revolutionaries came on to Kalpi. There, they began to make up for the defeat by wrangling against and abusing one another, - the infantry laid the defeat at the door of the cavalry, the cavalry blamed the Jhansi troops, and all together blamed the general, Tatia. But, Tatia Tope is not going to come any more to Kalpi to hear these wranglings. He has gone at present to the village of Charkhi, near Jalwan, to see his father. No one knows definitely where he is going after that, or whether he is going there at all. Let us remember that Gwalior lies in the direction of his road ! May the meeting between this extraordinary son and his fortunate father be full of love! And after that loving visit, may this great messenger of the Revolution go with despatch to carry out whatever designs he might have set his heart on! While Tatia was going on this journey, Ranee Lakshmi went to the royal tent of the Peshwa. The heroic Lakshmi relieved him of his dejection after the defeat of Kunchgaon and said to him that, if the army was properly organised, the enemy should never again be victorious. The Nabob of Banda was inspired by her speech. Proclamations in spirited language were again published in the Revolutionary army. And to-day, on the banks of the Jumna, crowds are gathering. Swords and guns, angry Sepoys invoking the Jumna to bless the cause of the indedpendence of their soil - such a Revolutionary pilgrimage the banks of the Jumna had probably never before seen. These banks are simply echoing forth the triumphant cries for the Mother and for Dharma!” Jai Jumna! With this thy sacred water in our hands, we swear that the Feringhis shall be extinct, that Swadesh shall be independent, and that Swadharma shall be re-established! Jai Jumna! If all this is accomplished, then alone we will live. If not, we will die this day on the field of battle. We swear, by thee, O Kalindi, three times!” Heroes, thrice bound by this oath, come on then to the field. Rao Sahib will lead the whole army. Drive away this 25th infantry under Sir Hugh Rose. They are all Indians - drive these traitors before you! Major Orr advances - make him share the same defeat! In this maidan before Kalpi, our position - with this undulatory part to cover - is almost impregnable. But look, the vanguard is falling back! It went too far, and being not well covered, has had to retreat. Run then, Lakshmi, run to protect them. She rushed forward sword in her hand with lightning-like rapidity, and fell on the right wing of the English, with her red-uniformed cavalry. The triumphant right stopped dead, so sudden was the attack; stopped dead, and then retired back helpless. This rapid onslaught of the girl of twenty-one, her horse at full speed, her sword cutting men down to the right and to the left, - seeing this, who would not fight for her? Who would not be inspired by her? All the Revolutionaries were inspired by her strength; the battle raged bloody and hot. The Feringhi gunners of the light field artillery began to die one after another. The Ranee and her cavalry, then, advanced right on the guns which were spitting deadly fire, and attacked the artillery. English gunners left the guns; the horse artillery was routed; the heroes of the Revolution advanced on and on, from all sides, overjoyed at the prospect of crushing the Feringhis who had so long escaped them; and before them all fought Lakshmi! This praise by the enemy does credit to the Panday party. Sir Hugh Rose, taken aback by this terrible onslaught, then advanced with his reserve camels, and the English saved their own lives, simply because of the camels. An English writter says, “Fifteen minutes more, and the mutineers would have cut us down! Fresh camels, one hundred and fifty in number, changed the fortunes of the day. Ever since that day, I have looked on the camel with eyes of affection.” By the strength of the camelmen alone, on the 22nd of May, the Feringhis succeeded in forcing the Peshwa’s army to retire towards Kalpi. After another complete defeat of the Peshwa’s troops and after a few skirmishes, Sir Hugh entered Kalpi on the 24th May. In the fort of Kalpi, the English captured a very considerable amount of military supplies which Shri Rao Sahib Peshwa and Tatia Tope had, with great trouble, gathered together in one year. Sixty thousand pounds of gunpowder were found buried under the ground; muskets beautifully made, brass balls of the latest type for the guns, factories for making and repairing cannon-balls, heaps of military uniforms, flags, drums, French trumpets, Howitzer guns manufactured in Europe, and arms of various kind - such was the very useful find that the English army came upon! What they did not capture was the brave and ever-memorable leaders of the Revolutionaries. For, when Kalpi fell after a week, Rao Sahib, the Nabob of Banda, Ranee Lakshmi Bai, and other leaders had left Kalpi and gone - nobody knew where. But now these unfortunate, helpless people, without an army and without arms, could do nothing beyond falling into the jaws of death, either by privations, or ny capture, or ny suicide! Thus Sir Colin had begun the reconquest from the northern bank of the Jumna, and went on conquering as far as the Himalayas. Sir Hugh Rose and Whitlock be.gan from the Narbada, and conquered all the country as far as the South bank of the Jumna. The English had now every reason to congratulate themselves that they had destroyed the Revolution completely. Sir Hugh Rose congratulated his army in these eloquent words :- “Soldiers, you have marched one thousand miles, captured one hundred guns, swam rivers, crossed mountains, marched through jungles, defeated big armies, reconquered extensive tracts, and reestablished the glory of your country! Brave you are; and you have also observed the strictest discipline; for courage without discipline is nought. In the midst of difficulties, temptations, and trouble, you have obeyed strictly the orders of your general, and have never showed even a single sign of insubordination. From the waters of the Narbada to the waters of the Jumna, this, your success, has come to you through your splendid discipline!” After publishing this glorifying proclamation, Sir Hugh resigned his charge for the sake of his health. And the triumphant English army, having destroyed the enemy completely, sighed the sigh of relief and wished to rest. But how dare you rest yet? While Tatia and Ranee Lakshmi Bai are alive, there is no rest possible for the British troops. Come, stand up! And if you would not stand of your own accord, here is the whole force of Gwalior, ready to goad you on! After escaping from Kalpi, the Revolutionary leaders went to Gopalpur to discuss their future plans. Practically, at this time, there was not a sign of hope. From the Narbada to the Jumna, and from Jumna to the Himalayas, the English had conquered back the whole territory. The Revolutionaries were without an army, without a fort, without any hope of getting fresh forces - defeated as they were again and again. But Tatia Tope was still alive, and that was enough! Tatia, too, had returned to Gopalpur. People say he had returned after visiting his father. Whatever people say, history does not say so. It was when Sir Hugh tried his deep-laid game at Kalpi that Tatia had a sudden fit of fondness for his father - a fondness, by -the-bye, which seemed to exceed even his fondness for fight; and, no longer able to control his filial feelings, he want to Charkhi to see his father. What was the secret of this sudden passion? The secret was that, as soon as Kalpi fell, it was absolutely necessary to get hold of some other strong position, some strong fortress, and some new army. And, therefore, this Messenger of the Revolution had escaped from Kalpi secretly to enter Gwalior, and see how the Revolutionary idea was progressing there! He accepted the promises of the chief officers of the army and created a new army for the Revolution, by secretly winning over the Durbar functionaries, Sirdars, and others. They promised to give him all the aid they could, and in one month he had the whole of Gwalior in the hollow of his hand. He then collected every information about the military position of Gwalior and, thus, after undermining the throne of the Scindia, Tatia returned to Rao Sahib at Gopalpur. He had ‘seen his father’! Learning the glad news, that Tatia had come back from Gwalior having successfully won over the people to the sided of the Revolution, Ranee Lakshmi urged the Peshwa to advance straight towards Gwalior. On the 28th of May, the Revolutionaries came to Amin Mahal. The Mahalkars tried to stop them. They were answered, “Who are you to obstruct us? We are the Peshwa and his forces and we are fighting for Swaraj and Swadharma.” These words of Rao Sahib silenced the cowards, and thousands of patriots in that part welcomes the Revolutionaries heartily, and thus the army of the Peshwa pressed right on the walls of the city of Gwalior. They had written to the Scindia, “We are coming to you in a friendly spirit. Remember our former relations. We expect help from you, so that we shall be enabled to proceed towards the south.” But this ungrateful man had forgotten the former relations. Well then, remember the former and the present relations too! “The ancestors of the Scindia were our servants, our Hujres - that was the former relation. And, the present relation? The whole army of the present Scindia has joined us. Tatia had gone to Gwalior, seen the leaders, and gained all necessary information!” But still, forgetting all this the Scindia, with all his army and all his guns, advanced on the Peshwa on the 1st of June, near Gwalior. The Shrimant who deserves the respect of the whole country thought for a moment that the Scindia had repented and was coming forward to salute the flag of Swadesh. But, Lakshmi said that he was coming, not to salute, but to smash that golden flag. She came forward with her three hundred horsemen and advanced right on the guns of the Scindia. Soon, she caught the view of Jayaji Rao Scindia and his personal guard the brave “Bhaleghate” troops. The cobra shows not such rage when it is trodden upon as Lakshmi showed at the sight of this traitor! Like an arrow she dashed at his troops. Behold, you Bahadur - descendant of Mahadaji, this helpless girl of twenty-two, brought up in the Zenana, is inving you for a trial of strength of the sword! Let us all see now how much of the prowess of Mahadaji, the devoted lover of his country, has descended upon this Jayaji the devoted slave of the Feringhi! As soon as this angry lightning struck him hard on the front, his personal guards wavered and the Scindia, with all his “Bhaleghate” troops,was routed. But, at least, there was hope that his huge army and terrible artillery would do their best - and they did do their best! As soon as they saw Tatia, these troops which had been bound over by secret oaths to Tatia refused, point-blank, to fight against the Peshwa. As previously arranged, they joined the Peshwa with all their officers; the guns were silent and everyone in Gwalior honoured the flag of the Peshwa. The throne of the Scindia thus crumbled to pieces at the touch of the Revolutionary magician. And so, Jayaji Rao Scindia, coward as he was, and his minister, Dinkar Rao, fled, not only from the field, but from Gwalior itself, and ran to Agra! Gwalior, was now mad with joy. The army fired salutes in honour of the Shrimant. The Finance Minister, Amar Chand Bhatia, surrendered the whole treasury of the Scindia, to the last pie, to Shrimant. Those few patriots who were in prison under the old regime for having shown sympathy with the Revolutionaries were released from their prisons amidstthe joyous cries of the populace. The traitors who had advised the Scindia to join the English had fled, but their mansions and their property were destroyed so that not a vestige of them remained. The black charge that the Asiatics do not understand the true relation between a ruler and his subjects, was washed away completely by Gwalior. For, how can he who goes against his own country and against his own Dharma be a ruler? Poona had been in 1818 guilty of being a traitor to the motherland is not having dragged Rao Baji from his Peshwai in right time. Gwalior was not guilty of that! And therefore, this Revolution of 1857 must be recorded in history as the first indication in modern India of the omnipotence of the vox populi, the power of the people. If Scindia joins not his country, the country shall not aid him either. Swords and guns, infantry and cavalry, Durbar and Sirdars, Mankarees and citizens, temples and images - all are for the country, alone; and if the Scindia is not for the country, drag him down from his throne; and outside the palace, outside the capital, outside the borders of the kingdom let him be driven out! Hereafter, according to the Scriptures, “The King receives his power only by pleasing the people!” And now, we must not let this auspicious day, the 3rd of June, slip by uselessly. And so “a big Durbar was held in Phul Bagh. All Sirdars, statesmen noblemen, Shiledars, and cavalry officers, who had joined the Shrimant, took their seats according to their rank. Tatia Tope and the Arabs, Rohillas, Pathans, Rajputs, Rangdes, Pardeshis, and others under him came to the Durbar in their military uniform and with swords by their side. The Shrimant himself was dressed in the Peshwa’s uniform Shirpana and Kalgitura on head, pearls in his ears, and pearl and diamond necklaces, round his neck. Thus, with all the paraphernalia of the Peshwai, Bhaldars and Chobdars making way for him, and Mourchas flying, the Shrimant came to the Durbar. Then, as usual, all stood up in reverence, salutes were received, and the Shrimant ascended the throne. With tears of joy in his eyes, he congratulated all the noblemen with great eloquence. Ram Rao Govind was appointed Chief Minister. Tatia Tope was made general and a sword studded with precious stones was presented to him. The eight ministers were elected. Twenty lakhs of Rupees were distributed to the army. The Durbar was a complete success. Joy was on every face and salutes of guns were fired.“61 Shrimant Rao Sahib, representative of Nana Sahib Peshwa, had thus established a new throne, infusing a new hope and a new life into the Revolutionary party, and had created a centre, a basis, round which might be attracted the scattered forces of the Revolution. Tatia Tope was not mad in busying himself with this coronation and giving salutes after salutes just 61 D.B.Parasnis’s Life of Lakshmi Bai, page 309. in a midst of the war. The whole world had seen the dead body of the Revolution which by this means alone he now lifted from the grave of despair. The world – some with pleasure and others with despair – had cried : “That is a dead body, there is no life in it!” But what wonderful magic this! Tatia took the dead earth at Gopalpur, he breathed on it thus, and – wonderful! – the whole world saw with the dumbness of surprise, a throne rising from the thimbleful of earth, jingling with lakhs of Rupees! Wonder of wonders! See the thousands of swordsmen advancing; hear the salutes thundering forth from the guns! A new army is up, new guns are up, Tatia has captured a new kingdom! Tatia has done all this not meely to strike the world dumb with his splendid triumph. He knew that the Revolutionaries who had spread far and wide would, on hearing the salutes proclaiming the Shrimant as a Peshwa of the Mahratta empire, get a concentrated inspiration, vigour, and hope. He knew that the sight of the triumphant flag of the nation, thus unfurled at Gwalior, would infuse an uncontrollable enthusiasm and dash. He knew that the lawlessness which had set in owing to the want of a rallying point, would now make way for discipline, through respect for the new-established throne. All this Tatia saw. And what he foresaw soon came to pass. For the body of the Panday party was soon instinct with life. While thus, on the one hand, his countrymen were encouraged, the English army, which just gave a sigh of relief, was, on the other hand, again disheartened. It was for this that the coronation was proclaimed loudly by Tatia and other leaders of the Revolution. Their deep- laid game was successful. For, by this very thunder of Tatia’s cannon, Sir Hugh Rose’s idea of rest was rudely shattered to pieces!62 62 Malleson, writing about the cleverness and diplomacy which Tatia and Lakshmi Bai showed in taking Gwalior, says :- “How the “Impossible” happened has been told …. He (Sir Hugh Rose) realised, moreover, the great danger which would inevitably be caused by delay. No one could foresee the extent of evil possible if Gwalior were not promptly wrested from rebel hands. Grant them delay, and Tatia Tope, with the immense acquisition of political and military strength secured by the possession of Gwalior, and with all its resources in men, So far so good; but once having shocked Sir Hugh Rose and disheartened him, woe betide him who listened not to the words of Ranee Lakshmi Bai! All other functions but the one great function of war must be stopped. But it seemed that, as ill-luck would have it, the intoxication of the Revolutionaries would make them blind to the necessity of heeping the army in complete readiness. They were all immersed in luxury, good dinners, and fatal dilatoriness – they thought, perhaps, that this was the sole end of Swaraj! They were onlo losing Swaraj. For, the surprised Sir Hugh Rose marched rapidly on Gwalior with his excellent army under him. He brought with him the renegade Scindia and proclaimed to all that the English were going to fight only for the Scindia’s sake! It was a trick to deceive the simple men of Gwalior, who had the slavish and discreditable merit of blind loyalty, and it was calculated to prevent these from fighting against the Scindia. But the old world had changed, giving place to the new. Tatia, so far successful in awakening the Revolutionaries, rushed forward to meet the English. The English had already defeated the Morar contingents. Now, with the shadow of defeat on them, there began some excited movements among the Revolutionary leaders. Rao Sahib was hastening towards the house of the Nabob of Banda and the Nabob of Banda was rushing towards the house of Rao Sahib. But, in the midst of all this confusion, the Ranee alone was calm and was ready. Her sword was out. What need she fear now? Hope as well as despair she had trampled under money and material at his disposal, would be able to form a new army on the fragments of that beaten at Kalpi, and to provoke a Mahratta rising throughout India. It might be possible for him, using the dexterity of which he was a master, to unfurl the Peshwa’s banner in the southern Mahratta districts. Those districts were denudedof troops, and a striking success in Central India would probably decide their inhabitants to pronounce in favour of the cause for which their fathers had fought and bled.” - Malleson’s Indian Mutiny, Vol. V, pages 149-150. foot; she treated with contempt the things on this earth; she had one aspiration alone, namely, that the flag of liberty should stand proudly erect until she gave up her last breath! Neither of them were to be in the dust; they were to lie in battle alone. So, she gave Rao Sahib a word of courage, rearranged the undisciplined troops as far as she could, and took upon herself the task of guarding the eastern gate. She only demanded, “I am ready with all my soul to do my duty; mind, you do yours!” She donned her usual military uniform, rode a noble steed, took out her gem-bestudded sword from the sheath, and ordered the army under her to march on. She made ready all the posts near Kotaki Serai which had been given to her care and, when the English army was in sight, everywhere, trumpets and pipes, drums and nagaras rent the air. If only she had an army, equal in courage and daring to herself! Even the insubordinate and hesitating felt heroic under her influence and, with them and her select band of horsemen, she charged hard the English army! Her two female friends, Mandar and Kashi, also fought bravely by her side. May the sweet memory of those two patriotic girls - beautiful in appearance, with male attire put on, taking pleasure in fight - live in history along with that of their mistress as long as history lives! A general like Smith was charging the Ranee’s army, but to-day the Ranee’s bravery and daring were a sight to see. Like lightning, she moved about all day. The English attacked the solid phalanx a number of times. One very occasion she maintained her hold firm. Her army occasionally felt enthusiastic and attacked the British and cut down many of them. At last, Smith was forced to retire; he gave up the attempt of breaking the mass and began to turn to another side, leaving the nest of the cobra alone! Thus closed the day and thus rose the 18th of the month! This day, the English had resolved to make desperate charges. From all directions, they advanced on the fort, and tried their utmost. General Smith, forced to retire the day before, was very determined to-day and, aided by re- inforcements, he charged the same Jhansi side he had gone for the day before. Sir Hugh Rose thought that his presence was also absolutely necessary and so he was personally present with the force attacking the Jhansi side. The Ranee too was ready for him with all her forces. “She was ready with all her soul to do her duty.” That day, she wore a Chanderi turban embroidered all over, a tamamee cloak, and pyjamas. A pearl necklace was round her neck. Her famous steed being tired that day, a new, fresh-looking horse was made ready for her, fully caparisoned. While her two beautiful maids were taking sherbet, news came that the English were advancing. Lakshmi immediately darted forwarded from her tent. The arrow flies not so rapidly, the lightning flashes not forth with such force from the clouds, a lioness leaves not her lair so quickly to fall upon the approaching elephant! She rode her horse, lifted her sword, and charged the enemy with her army. As English writer says, “Immediately the beautiful Ranee went over the field and made a firm stand against the array of Sir Hugh Rose. She led her troops to repeated and fierce attacks and, though her ranks were pierced through and were gradually becoming thinner and thinner, the Ranee was seen in the foremost rank, rallying her shattered troops and performing prodigies of valour. But all was of no avail. The camel corps, pushed up by Shri Huge Rose in person, broke her last line. Still the dauntless and heroic Ranee held her own.” But while her side was fighting with such unexampled bravery, she saw the English army advancing on her rear - for they had broken through the ranks of Revolutionaries who were holding the posts behind her! The artillery dumb, the main army routed, the victorious English army closing on her from all sides, with only fifteen or twenty horsemen with her, Ranee Lakshmi, accompanied by her maids, put her horse to a gallop, in order to break through the enemy, and to join her comrades on the other side. The Feringhi horsemen of the Hussars, who knew not so far where she was, fired shot after shot on her and pursued her like hounds. But the Queen, with unexampled courage, cleared her way with her sword and marched on. Suddenly was heard a cry, “I am dead, Bai Sahib, I am dead!” Alas, whose is this cry? Lakshmi turned round and found that it was her maid Mandar whom a white soldier had shot and killed! Angered, she attacked the Feringhi, and her blow felled him on the spot. She had avenged the death of fair Mandar! She then marched on. She came to a small rill. Now, one jump and Jhansi would have been out of the Feringhi’s clutches. But her horse would not take that jump! If only she had had her old horse! As if the fiery line of a magician was round him the horse moved in circles, round and round, but would not cross. Before you could say “one”, the English horsemen closed on her! Still not a word of surrender or fear! One sword against their several swords, - yet she closed on them. She crossed sword with sword with them all, but one of them hit her on the head from behind. With that blow, the right part of her head, and even her right eye came out - just then, another blow hit her on the chest. Oh Lakshmi, Lakshmi! The last drop of thy sacred blood is dripping and, therefore, now, Mother, take this last sacrifice for thee! Even at the point of death, she killed the British foe who had attacked her, and now the young Queen was breathing her last breath! A faithful servant, Ramchandra Rao Deshmukh, was near. He took her to a cottage near by. Ganga Das Bawa gave her cold water to drink to quench her thirst and a bed to lie down upon. Bathed in blood, this goddess of war reclined on the bed, and then her soul quietly fleeteed from her body to heaven! As soon as she was dead, Ramchandra Rao, in accordance with her dying instructions prepared a pile of grass unseen by the enemy; he put her on that pure and, before the touch of slavery could defile even her dead body, she was cremated. On the pyre, if not on the throne! But Lakshmi is still with her sweetheart Liberty! She has forced open the gates of death by falling in battle and has now entered the other world. Pursuit can no longer harm her. Wicked Pursuit must pass through those roaring flames before it can do so. Thus fought Lakshmi. She had achieved her purpose, fulfilled her ambition, carried out her resolve! One such life vindicates the whole existence of a nation! She was the concentrated essence of all virtues. A mere woman, hardly twenty-three yet, beautiful as rose, charming in her manners, pure of conduct, she had a power of organisation of her subjects, exhibited by very few, even among men. The flame of patriotism was always burning in her heart. And she proud of her country’s honour and pre- eminent in war! It is very rarely that a nation is so fortunate as to be able to claim such an angelic person, as a daughter and a queen. That honour has not yet fallen to the lot of England. In the Revolution of Italy, high ideals and heroism of the very highest type are to be found; yet, in all this period of glody, Italy could not give birth to Lakshmi! But, even our land could hardly have given birth to such a Queen but for this glorious War of Independence! The precious pearls in the ocean are not to be found on its surface. The Suryakanta jewel does not give out flames in the quiet of the night; nor does the flint give up its spark on soft cushions. They want resistance. Injustice must make the mind restless; really, not apparently, every drop of blood most actually boil; intense national feeling is thus set aflane in such a furnace, the particles of virtue begin to flow, the test goes on, the dross is eliminated, then, the concentrated essence of virtues begins to appear. In 1857, the heart of this our Motherland took fire; then, a terrible explosion which would deafen the world took place; - A spark at Meerut, and the whole country, which, under the roller of Dalhousie, had been reduced to the monotony of a dead level and seemed to be a heap of dust, proved to be a powder-magazine filled with the most inflammable material. Just as when a mighty rocket in a fireplay, fired in the air, explodes, arrows and trees and various other picturesque objects rise and rush and burn and die away, such was the case of this gigantic Revolutionary Rocket! Its length is from Meerut to the Vindhyas; its width from Peshawar to Dumdum;- and it was fired! Fire and flames raged in all directions. Blood coming down like rain, - sieges of Delhi, revenges of Plassey, massacres of Cawnpore, and the Sikandar Bagh of Lucknow! Thousands of heroes are fighting - and dying; cities are burning. Kumar Singh comes, struggles, falls; the Moulvie comes, struggles, and falls; the throne of Cawnpore, the throne of Lucknow, the throne of Delhi, the throne of Bareilly, the throne of Jagadishpur, the throne of Jhansi, the throne of Banda, the throne of Furrukabad, five thousand, ten thousand, fifty thousand, a lakh of swords, flags, banners, generals, horses, elephants - all are coming out out after another, move about in the turmoil of the raging fire! Some are ascending one flame, some another; they poise themselves a while, reel, fight, fall down unseen! Everywhere battle and thunder-storms! A veritable volcanic conflagration this! And the pyre, flaming near the cottage of Gangadas Bawa, is the last and the most lustrous flame of this raging volcanic conflagration of the War of Independence of 1857! END OF THE THIRD PART">

  <meta itemprop="name" content="10 RANI LAKSHMI BAI">
  <meta itemprop="description" content="GIVE up my Jhansi? I will not. Let him try to take who dares!&#34; With this challenge the heroic Ranee of Jhansi rose against the British and as it is recorded in previous parts of this History she assumed the leadership of the Revolution, drove the English and began to rule at Jhansi as the Queen of the province. The forces of the Revolution had wreaked a bloody vengeance on the English people and army and left not a trace of their rule at Sagar. Naogaon, Banda, Banapur, Shahgarh and Karki. The people everywhere hailed the Queen as their own. She then busied herself - in restoring order and peace in her liberated province. The Ranee’s daily life at this period has been described as follows :- “The Bai got up at five in the morning and took a bath with fragrant attar. After dressing - and she generally wore a Chanderi Saree of faultless white - she would sit for her daily prayers. First, she dropped the necessary water as a prayaschitta for keeping hair on her head after her husband’s death; then, she used to worship the Tulsi in the Tulsi grove. Then began the Parthiva Puja at which the Durbar musicians would sing in choir. Puraniks would then start reading the Puran. Then, Sirdars and dependants came and she returned their usual salutes. Being very keen of memory, even if a single man among the seven hundred and fifty who paid their respects to her in the morning was not present, the very next day, the Bai would not fail to inquire why he did not come the previous day. After the worship of God began the dinner. After dinner, she would take an hour’s siesta unless there was urgent work to do. Then she would order the presents of the morning to be brought before her, which was done on silver trays covered over with silk cloths. Those things that she liked, she accepted; the others were given over to the Kothiwalla (minister of the presents department) for distribution amongst her servants. At three she went to the Durbar, when she usually put on male attire. She wore a pyjama, a coat of dark blue, a cap on the heat, and a beautiful turban on the top of it, a dupeta of embroidered cloth round the slender waist, and the sword decked with gems by her side. Attired in this wise, this fair woman looked like Gauri herself. Sometimes, she wore the female dress. After her husband’s death, she never wore nath or similar ornaments. Her hands had round them bangles of diamond; she wore a small necklace of pearls round her neck and a diamond ring on her little finger. These were the only jewels worn by the Bai Sahib. Her hair was gathered up together behind. She wore a white saree and a plain white bodice. Thus, sometimes in male attire and sometimes in female, the Bai Sahib used to honour the Durbar by her presence. Those assembled in Durbar never used to see her person. For the room in which she sat was separate from, and only opened into, the Durbar hall. Gold carving adorned the doors, and over these fell gracefully the chintz curtain, embroidered with gold cloths. In this room sat the Bai Sahib on a gadi of soft down, leaning on a soft pillow. Outside the door, two pages with maces of silver and sold always attended. Opposite the room, Lakshman Rao Dewanji stood with a bundle of important documents in his hand, and beyond him sat the Registrars of the Durbar. Being very keen and intelligent, the Bai quickly grasped every matter brought before her, and her orders were clear and definite and to the point. Sometimes she wrote her orders out herself. She was very careful in affairs of justice, and decided civil and criminal cases alike with great ability. Ranee Sahib worshipped Mahalakshmi devoutly. The temple of that Goddess was situated on the banks of a lake filled with lotus flowers, and every Friday and Tuesday the Bai visited the temple. One day, it so happened that after the Bai had returned from the temple and was passing through the south gate, she was thousands of beggars blocking the passage and creating a disturbance. So, she inquired of the Minister, Lakshman Rao Pande, the reason of this. He inquired and informed her that the people were very poor, and that they suffered immensely on account of excessive cold, and that, therefore, they requested that the Bai would kindly consider their condition. The Bai left very grieved for these poor people, and she at once issued orders - kind-hearted that she was - that, on the fourth day from thence, a gathering of beggars should take place, where every one should be provided with a thick coat and a cap and a blanket either white or black. The very next day, all the tailors of the town were given orders to make caps and coats. On the day appointed it was proclaimed that all the beggars were to gather in front of the palace. Poor people, too, had been included in his gathering. All were given clothes by the Bai and they went away satisfied In the fight with Nathe Khan when the wounded men were brought into the city, the Bai herself would insist on being present when their wounds were being dressed. Her very presence soothed their pain, and they felt themselves sufficiently rewarded by the kind and sympathetic interest she took in their well-being. The Ranee grieved at their grief, gave them ornaments and medals, patted them, and showed such sympathy that others, instead of being disheartened at the sight of these wounded soldiers, felt that they could even give up their lives for the sake of the Ranee. The grandeur of the Bai’s processions passes description. On the occassions of the visits to the temple of Mahalakshmi, she started sometimes in a palanquin, and sometimes on horseback. When in the palanquin, the palanquin would be covered with curtains of gold and embroidered cloths tied with golden ribbon. When she was on horseback, in male attire, the end of a thin and beautiful batti floated on her back and it fitted her admirably. The national flag of freedom was carried before her, with the band playing military music. Two hundred Europeans followed the flag and a hundred horsemen rode before and behind her. With the palanquin came the karbharis, ministers, feudatories, and other officers like Bhayya Sahib Upasane; and others either rode or followed on foot. Sometimes troops accompanied the procession. When the Bai started from the palace, the choughada on the fort made sweet music. The choughada of the nagarkhana of Mahalakshmi started at the same time.“54 And thus, from the Vindhyas to the Jumna, there was not a vestige of British authority left, Brahmins, Moulvies, Sirdars, Dorkdars, Sepoys, the police, Rajas, Raos, bankers, villagers - all were desirous fighting for only one thing, and that was Independence! And to unite together these thousand voices in one harmonious whole, the Lakshmi of Jhansi declared with her sweet but firm voice “None can have my Jhansi; he who dares may try!” Very rarely had the world heard such a firm “No!” Generous and liberal to a fault India has always been pronouncing and swearing by “I shall give!”, “I shall give!”, so far. But here was a strange phenomenon to-day - a set face and a stern voice which said, “I will not give! I will not give up my Jhansi!” Would to heaven, O Mother, that every one of thy sons and daughters had said the same! The Feringhi was taken aback at this unexpected assertion; and Sir Hugh Rose was sent, with five thousand armed men and a considerable number of guns, to gauge the extent of the disturbance and to quell it. In the beginning of 1858, the English had drawn up a complete military plan for the reconquest of all the territory, from the Himalayas to the Vindhyas, which was under the Revolutionaries. The whole territory was divided into two portions, and to each of them a huge army was sent to subdue it. We have in an earlier chapter described how commander-in- chief Sir Colin Campbell marched upwards from Allahabad to the north of the Ganges and the Jumna and, with his big army, conquered the Doab, and crossed the Ganges and marches on Lucknow; how, after destroying Lucknow, he extinguished the flames of insurrection ranging in Behar, in Benares and round if, and in Oudh; how he forced all the Revolutionaries 54 D.B.Parasnis’s Life of Lakshmi Bai, paged 147-151. into Rohilkhand, where the final engagement took place, and how, thus, the northern portion of the territory which was in the hands of the Revolutionaries was reconquered by the English. While Sir Colin was advancing from the north of the Jumna towards the Himalayas, Sir Hugh Rose advanced to conquer the southern portion lying between the Jumna and the Vindhyas. In the north, the Sikhs, the Gurkhas, and other Indian troops and feudatories had joined Sir Colin; so also in the south, Sir Hugh Rose had on his side the help of the princes of Hyderabad, Bhopal, and other states. He had, in addition, got the valuable assistance of the troops of Madras and Bombay and the Hyderabad contingent. To mention specially that the Indian troops had joined Sir Hugh Rose is unnecessary. For, to mention that Sir Hugh Rose was successful would imply the first proposition. For the English to obtain a victory, of themselves, is as impossible as the most impossible thing in the world. The traitorous Indian troops thus collected together for conquering the southern parts were divided into two divisions. One was under the command of Brigadier Whitlock who was to start from Jubbulpore and, subduing the provinces on the way, was eventually to join Sir Hugh Rose. The other was under Sir Huge Rose himself. As soon as Whitlock started from Jubbulpore, Sir Hugh was also to start from Mhow; he was to advance through Jhansi on Kalpi. According to the plan of campaign, Sir Huge started from Mhow on the 6th of January 1858 and, after a fight, he captured the fort of Rajgarh. From thence, he advanced to Sagar, released the prisoners kept there by the Revolutionaries, advanced further south, reducing various positions of the enemy on the way, captured Banapur on the 10th of March, and reconquered the famous fort of Chanderi. On the 20th of March, the triumphant English army encamped about fourteen miles from Jhansi. By these many struggles, bands of Revolutionaries distributed all over the country from the banks of the Narbada upwards, now crowded into Jhansi; and that is why Sir Hugh advanced with great dispatch on Jhansi to reduce this stronghold of the Revolutionaries. But Lord Canning and Sir Colin both issued orders to Sir Hugh first to relieve the Raja of Charkhari who was being besieged by Tatia. This order, if he obeyed it, would have spoiled Sir Hugh’s plan of reducing Jhansi. What was he to do? He could neither disobey nor find his way to obey the orders. As, in these trying circumstances, the best interests of the British government lay in advancing on Jhansi, Sir Robert Hamilton took upon himself the whole responsibility of disobeying the orders of the two highest authorities in Hindusthan; and the British army, emboldened by a high national feeling, advanced towards Jhansi, hopeful of victory. But the English army suffered enormously as soon as they set foot on the soil of Jhansi. For they found, to their great surprise, that all the tract of land surrounding Jhansi had been laid waste by order of the Queen in orderthat the enemy should have no supplies of any sort. Not a blade of corn in the fields, not a vestige of grass on the meadows, not a tree which could afford shelter; So had William of Orange, when there appeared to be a possibility of the Netherlands falling into the hands of the Spanish tyrant and invader, ordered that the dykes be opened and the sea let in, rather than that the country should fall in the hands of the enemy. And this day Jhansi had adopted a similar course. The same terrible thunder is in her voice; her eyes are spouting forth the red flames of anger! Mardan Singh, Raja of Banapur, the enraged chief of Shahagarh, the brave Thakurs, with their lives in their hands, Sirdars of Bundelkhand, resolute as ever, with their many followers - all these hot incendiary elements in the interior of Jhansi are burning and flame-red. The flames leap up even as the Jaripatka; and look, the central figure of the whole fight is there, shining above all! Aye, she is the central idea, the flashing impersonation of Swaraj! She is the inspiration, she is the incarnation of Liberty! In spite of the barrenness of the country around, the English approached Jhansi. For, thanks to the loyalty of the Scindia and the Raja of Tehri, the force was throughout the operations abundantly supplied with grass, firewood, and vegetables.55 As the Scindia and the Raja of Tehri are helping the Feringhis, surrounded as you are by treachery and disloyalty, betrayed by relations as by strangers, you have not the slightest hope of success. Why not then avoid extinction by surrendering to the English? But, surrender? And for the Ranee of Jhansi? Dewan Lakshman Rao, Moro Punt Tambe, brave Thakurs and Sirdars, all heroes of Liberty, if you surrender, you will be saved; if you fight, you will die. Which will you choose? Jhansi answered from her thousand mouths, sternly, in the words of the Scripture, “As everyone who is born must die, why sully fair fame uselessly?” So, it was determined to give battle to the English for the honour of the country. And Jhansi was busy by night and by day preparing for the fight. Brave men, there were many in her army; but trained men, there were very few. Want of discipline was very apparent. The queen herself, however, let the whole army. On every rampart and every gate, she was moving about actively; she was standing where guns were being planted and moved into position; she was budy selecting clever gunners; and she was to be found everywhere inspiring heroism even in the coldest hearts. The learned Brahmins of Jhansi were praying for the success of the country. Its temples blessed the soldier who went to the field, and tended the wounded who returned from battle; its workmen were busy preparing ammunition and other necessary for war. The men of Jhansi manned their guns, loaded the muskets; its women carried ammunition, built Top Khanas, supplied provisions.56 When the night of the 23rd fell, sounds of battle- drums were heard throughout the town and lighted torches shone forth at frequent intervals from the fort. The guards fired a few shots too. The 55 Malleson’s Indian Mutiny, Vol. V, page 110. 56 “The women were seen working in the batteries and carrying ammunition, etc.”- Sir Hugh Rose. morning of the 24th approached. No more delay now! The Ghanagarj (thunder-clap) gun began its work. The noise made by that gun was terrific. We shall quote an eye witness’s account of the early stages of the siege. “From the 25th, the engagement began in right earnest. The enemy poured in a heavy fire all day and night. In the night came cannon- balls on the forst and the city. The sight was terrible to see. A cannon-ball of fifty or sixty pounds weight would look as small as a tennis ball but red like live charcoal. During the day one would not see these balls clearly for daylight, but in the night, they were clearly visible and gave a weird appearance to the night. On the 26th, at midday, the English silenced the guns on the southern gate, and not a man could make a stand there. All men in the field were nearly disheartened at this. Then, the gunner on the western gate moved the gun round and fired at the enemy; the third shot killed the best gunner in the English army, and the English gun was silenced, in its turn. At this, the Bai Sahib was very pleased and presented the gunner with a silver anklet. The name of the brave gunner was Gulam Ghose Khan. He had displayed similar skill in the engagement with Nathe Khan also. “On the fifty or the sixth day, the same sort of engagement took place. For four or five hours, the Bai’s guns were working wonders and the English lost heavily. Many of their guns, too, were silenced for some time. Then again, the English guns would be more vigorous, and the Jhansi troops would be disheartened and their guns silenced. On the seventh day, at sunset, the gun to the left was disabled. None could stand there. The battlement was destroyed owing to the enemy’s fire. But in the night, eleven masons were brought under cover of blankets to the walls of the fort, and the work was completed before the day dawned. Thus, the battlement was repaired, and the English, to their great surprise, found the Jhansi gun in working order. At this time, the English were careless. They suffered considerably and their guns were disabled for quite a long time. “On the morning of the eighth day, the English army went for Shankar Killa. The English had very expensive and modern telescopes and, with their aid, they began to pour a heavy fire on the reservoir of water within the fort. Of the six or seven who approached near for taking water, four were killed: the others ran leaving their vessels there. As they could not get water for nearly four hours, even baths and other ordinary functions could not be carried on. Now, the gunners on the western and southern gates stopped the guns of the English attacking the Shankar Killa, by a continued fire on them. Then it became possible to get water from the reservoir for bath and dinner. There was a powder factory in the tamarind grove. As soon as two maunds of powder was prepared, it was taken to the sellers to be stocked. A cannon- ball fell on the factory, and thirty men and eight women were killed. On the same day, there was a great turmoil. There was a terrible fight. The fighters were shouting loudly. There was a terrific noise from muskets, and guns firing heavily. Trumpets and bugles were sounding everywhere. Dust and smoke filled the air. Many gunners on the ramparts and a number of Sepoys were killed. Others were appointed in their place. The Bai Sahib was working very hard. She looked to everything, issued the necessary orders, and repaired every point of weakness. By this, the men in the army were very much encouraged and fought continually. On account of this determined resistance, the English, in spite of all their powder and ammunition, could not enter the fort till the 31st of March.“57 But pressed as she is by this constant succession of disasters, why is Queen Lakshmi looking so earnestly in that particular direction? And see, she is smiling too! Be ready now and fire your salutes; let triumphal drums beat loudly; let war-cries rend the air! For there is Tatia Tope advancing with his army to aid Jhansi! 57 D.B.Parasnis’s Life of Lakshmi Bai, pages 187-193. with his twenty-two thousand troops. While playing as children, people hardly noticed them; to-day, the whole world is looking on their game! Tatia Tope has come with his army to dishearten the English army and to give courage to Jhansi. After the defeat of Wyndham at Cawnpore and Sir Colin’s victory, Tatia crossed the Ganges and joined Shrimant Nana. Then, leaving Nana, he crossed the Jumna near Kalpi. As the Raja of Charkhari refused to help in the war for the country started by the Peshwa, Tatia, as representative of the Peshwa, attacked his capital, punished the traitor well, captured twenty-four of his guns, and took from him a contribution of three lacs of Rupees. And then Tatia turned towards Kalpi. There, he received a letter from Ranee Lakshmi Bai requesting him to come to Jhansi and relieve the siege. He sent the note to the Rao Sahib Peshwa, the chief in authority; and, as soon as he got the orders, he charged the rear of the English army. It is on seeing him that a smile of hope has come to the lips of Lakshmi. These two had played together as children in the palace at Brahmavarta, without anyone noticing them particularly. To- day they are playing on the battle-field; the one, on the fortifications of Jhansi, is standing amidst rings of flaming fire, the other is approaching close to the Betwa, with his twenty-two thousand troops. While playing as children, people hardly noticed them; to-day, the whole world is looking on their game! Tatia had under him, now, the largest number of troops he ever had, and hence the English were not a little disconcerted. They would have been completely so in the battle too, handful as they were. For, in front of them was the Ranee Lakshmi Bai; behind them was this Mahratta tiger, with his twenty-two thousand claws. Why should he not, then, tear Sir Hugh to pieces and eat him up? He advanced to do this, but his twenty-two thousand claws seemed all of a sudden disabled, they could hardly be lifted. And what could even a tiger do without his claws? Alas! A most shameful poltroonish cowardice was exhibited by the Revolutionary troops on the river Betwa. The army of Jhansi was to attack the rear, and Tatia was to attack the front; the plan was admirable. But the English, with the dash of despair, advanced on Tatia and opened fire on Jhansi. This nullified the two attacks of the aggressive party. One determined attack, like that of the Mawalas of Shivaji or the select band of Kumar, and vultures had fed upon the Union Jack and its followers. But, the English charged straight on the enemy. The cowards did not even offer fight, and - was it treachery or terror - not a cannon-shot from Jhansi was heard. So, the army and its commander were routed and ran away. Plentiful military supplies were captured by the English, Tatia’s guns fell into their hands, and one thousand and five hundred of the Revolutionaries were killed in the pursuit. Fifteen hundred people killed in the flight! Mad men and fools! Instead of dying the death of cowards while fleeing, if you had only attacked Sir Huge Rose, you would have died the death of the Ghazis of Bareillyk, you would have destroyed the whole army with Sir Hugh Rose, and your name would have lived for ever! Yet God forgive you! If not our respect, you deserve at least our sympathy. For, howsoever you died, you died for the liberty of your country! May my country learn from your death at least the lesson that soldiers who fly to live, die, and that those who fight to die, live! And for death was Ranee Lakshmi Bai fighting! Why, then, this hopelessness on the part of Sirdars, Thakurs, and Sepoys? For nine days and nine nights, you stood the deadly charge of gun-fire in the hope that Tatia Tope would soon come to your aid. When he came, you shouted for delight; by the defeat of Tatia on the 1st of April, not only that joy but the very hope of victory is dashed to pieces; and those supplies, to deprive the enemy of which thousands of lives had been sacrificed, have fallen with ease into the enemy’s hands. Tatia’s ammunition and guns also have fallen into their hands. All this is certainly true. But, why this despair? The enemy may render it impossible for you to live victorious, but he cannot deprive you of a death of glory. There is nothing to despair for, then! And stop, hear the steady, firm, courageous voice of Ranee Lakshmi. “It was not relying on the Peshwa that Jhansi fought so long nor does she require his help to continue her fight in the future. So far, your bravery have been exhibited by you most admirably. I urge to do the same now and to fight with courage and desperation.” Aye, fight with desperation, be ready, let the battle-drums beat, and the trumpets sound! Let was-cries rend the air and let big guns thunder forth! The 3rd of April has dawned and the last assault of the English on Jhansi has begun. They are coming from all sides and pressing hard. Start, then, in right, good, deadly earnest! See how the goddess of war has taken the sword and see how she is making her way through the troops. She is moving about with lightning rapidity, presenting some with golden bracelets, some with dresses; some she is touching with her sacred touch to pat, to some she is offering her sweet smile; others she is encouraging with her heroic words. So now! Gulam Ghose Khan and Kuar Khuda Bhaksh, let the fire be most deadly! The enemy is storming the main gate and the fortifications, ladders have been planted at eight different places. “Har, Har, Mahadev!” From the fort, from ramparts, and from houses came a perfect shower of bullets, a constant succession of shots. The deep-mouthed cannon are vomiting forth burning red-hot balls. “Maro Feringhiko!” Lieutenant Dick and Lieutenant Meiklejohn have mounted the ladders and are calling upon their men to follow them. Boom, boom! Instantly, the daring Englishmen fell in the jaws of death! Anyone coming behind? Lieutenant Bonus and heroic Lieutenant Fox, you seem anxious for death - your desire shall be accomplished; - die, then! Seeing these four heroes who had scaled with the greatest difficulty shot down, the ladders trembled. They swayed and broke under the weight of the English troops. The English sounded the bugle to retire; the army began to go back - it went back, the soldiers concealing themselves behind every stray stone!58 58 “No sooner did we turn into the road leading towards the gate, than the enemy’s bugle sounded, and a fire of indescribabl e fierceness opened upon us from the whole line of the walls and from the tower of the fort overlooking this site. For a time it appeared like a sheet of fire, A strong defence was thus offered at the principal gate. But who is giving forth that tragic wail near the southern ramparts? May it be that mean treachery had lost the Morcha gate? Yes, unfortunately yes; the English have captured the gate, with the air of treachery - so it is said - and they have mounted the ramparts, and are advancing rapidly on. There was no other thought that day but to kill or be killed! Once within the city, the English gave no quarter and streams of blood flowed freely. The English, taking one position after another, massacring, firing, destroying - came right up to the palace. As soon as the palace was forced, thousands of Rupees were looted, guards were massacred, and buildings were destroyed. At last, alas! Jhansi had fallen into the enemy’s hands! Standing on the rampartrs, the Ranee looked back for one moment at Jhansi. Before her rose the hideous picture of the terrible disaster that had happened near the south gate. The enemy had, after all, defiled her Jhansi! Her eyes were ablaze with anger; she was almost mad with rage. She took up her sword and, with her small force of a thousand or fifteen hundred men, she marched down the fort. The tigress to avenge her cubs runs not so fleetingly. As soon as she saw the white troops near the southern gate, she rushed for them, and then, “swords crossed, the two armies were mixed up before you could count even fifty; swords flourished and dealt heard blows. Many Englishmen were killed. The rest ran towards the town and began to fire shots from under cover!” By this sight of Feringhi blood, the anger of this Kali was a little appeased, and now she saw that it was foolhardy to fight alone so far from the fort. But echoes of such daring heroism were now to be heard in every street in the city. Fifty stablemen in the palace, while the whole town and the palace itself was bathed in blood shed by English out of which burst a store of bullets, round shots, and rockets destined for our annihilation…… But the fire of the enemy waxed stronger, and amidst the chaos of sounds, of volleys of musketry and roaring of cannon, hissing and bursting rockets, stink-pots, infernal machines, huge stones, blocks of wood, and trees, all hurled upon our heads, it seemed as though Pluto and the Furies had been loosened upon us, carrying death amongst us fast. At this instant a bugle sounded on our right for the Europeans to retire.” – Lowe’s Central India, page 254. swords, refused to give up the stables! “Surrender” was a word not to be found in their dictionary. Everyone of these men cut down the enemy as hard as he could, and it was only when everyone of them was killed that the paga fell into the enemy’s hands! The English had, by now, rendered the whole town desolate. Everyone who fell into their hands, from children of five to old men of eighty, were massacred; the whole city was set fire to; wailings from the wounded and the dying, and the cries of those who killed, filled the air. A huge wail rose from the whole town! When the Queen stood on the walls of the fortress (which the enemy had decided to storm only the next day on account of its strength), looking at this sad, sad picture, she was smitten with grief and tears started to her eyes! The Queen of Jhansi wept! Those beautiful eyes were red with weeping! Her Jhansi to be reduced to this! Then she looked up and saw the flag of the Feringhi flying over the walls of Jhansi, and a strange fire shone from those weeping eyes! All glory to her courage! But why is this messenger running hard towards her? He said, “Your Majesty, the pre- eminently brave Sirdar who guarded the chief gate of the fort, Sirdar Kuar Khuda Buksh, and Gulam Ghose Khan, the chief gunner of the artillery, have both been shot down by the English!” What a blow this to the already afflicted Queen! What a succession of disasters this! What is your next plan, then, Queen? Aye, one and one alone! She said to the messenger, who was no other than an old Sirdar, &#34; I have determined to blow myself up with the fort, setting fire to the ammunition with my own hands.” With her Jaripatka she must be - if not on the throne, at least on the pyre! Hearing this, the old Sirdar calmly replied, “Your Majesty, as it is not safe to be in this neighbourhood now, your Majesty should leave the fort to-night breaking through the enemy’s camp and should join the Peshwa’s forces. If death comes on the way, the conquest of heaven by a dip in the sacred waters of the battle-field is always at hand!” Lakshmi said, “I should choose to die on the battle-field, but, being a woman, I fear that the enemy might insult my person!” To this the whole Durbar answered with one voice: “Insult! So long as there is life in the body of the least among us, our sword shall cut to pieces the enemy who woulod dare so much as touch your sacred person!” Well then, the night had fallen; Lakshmi greeted all her dear subjects and gave them her blessings for the last time! Her subjects were full of tears at the thought that she was leaving Jhansi, perhaps for ever. She took a selected number of horsemen with her. An elephant with jewels on him was placed in the middle and Ranee Lakshmi descended the fort amidst cries of “Har, Har, Mahadev!” She put on male apparel; a steel armour covered her person, a Jammia was in her girdle; a fine sword hung from her belt, a silver cup was in her Pudder, and her adopted child Damodar was on her back, tied in silk Dhoti. Thus accoutred, riding on a noble white steed, this queen, Lakshmi, looked like the goddess of war. When the north gate came, the sentry who belonged to the traitor army of the Tehri State asked, “Who goes there?” “The army of Tehri is going to the aid of Sir Huge Rose,” was the answer. The sentry was satisfied and Ranee advanced, evading the English sentry too in a similar manner. One maid, one bargeer, and ten or fifteen horsemen formed her body-guard, and marched through the camp of the enemy. But her other horsemen were stopped by the English on suspicion and had to fight hard. Moro Punt Tambe, wounded though he was, was able to run as far as Datia. But the traitor Dewan of that State captured him and gave him over to the English, who later on hanged him. But, Lakshmi, put your horse now in a gallop. For Lieutenant Bowker is galloping behind, followed by select horsemen, in order to capture you. And you, O horse, fortunate on account of the sacred treasure you carry, gallop on! Let the men of Bharata be traitors, but, ye animals, ye at least be faithful! O Night, drop the curtain of darkness between Queen Lakshmi and her enemies ! O horse, fleeting as you are, quicker than the wind, balance Lakshmi lightly! Ye paths, do not obstruct the horse’s onward march! O ye stars, shine not for the enemy, but just shine so that this tender beauty, delicate as a flower, should be encouraged on the way by your rays, cool as nectar! The dawn has now broken; so, heroic Queen, flying all night on the wings of the wind, rest thee near the village of Bhandeir. The Mahalkuree of the village will feed your darling Damodar. As soon as breakfast was over, she again started on her journey on the Kalpi road. But what is this dust behind? Spur your horses on! Lakshmi, keep Damodar safe on the back and gallop on. Tak our your sword! There, Bowker is pressing close! Here is the reward for your wicked pursuit! Dare you hold back the lightning? A long sweep of her sword, and Bowker was violently thrown off his horse. A deadly fight took place between her fifteen or twenty horsemen and the English pursuers; those who were alive advanced forward to protect Lakshmi Bai. Wounded Bowker and his handful of men gave up the pursuit. The sword of the Mother advanced triumphant, shining. The sun in the heaven above, Ranee Lakshmi Bai on earth - both were marching forward. Morning was gone and mid-day came, but the Ranee did not stop. Afternoon came, the shades of evening began to fall, the sun went down the horizon - but the Ranee still would not stop. The stars rose. They saw her just as they had seen her the night before - marching, marching in hot haste. At last, at midnight, Ranee Lakshmi entered Kalpi. A ride of a hundred and two miles she accomplished, and that, fighting with Lieutenant Bowker and his soldiers and with the burden of a child on her back. That horse just lived, it so seemed, to carry her to Kalpi. For, as soon as he saw the rider safe in Kalpi, he fell down on the ground all in a heap. Six men were immediately ordered to attend to the horse. The Ranee loved the horse very much. A horse which carried safe such a person with such faithfulness deserves to be remembered, and his memory will be loved for all time. The Ranee slept till dawn. In the morning, the touching meeting between the Ranee and Shri Rao Sahib Peshwa took place. Both remembered their ancestors - the thought that they were descended from those who had done such seemingly impossible deeds inspired them both. They realised that the flag of the Mahratta empire waved as far as Attock because men like the Scindia and the Holkar, the Gaekwar and Bundela and Patwardhan were ready to give up their lives for Swaraj. And for that very flag, for that very Swaraj for which their fathers and grandfathers had bled, they resolved to continue uninterrupted, to the very last breath of their lives, the war already begun against those who attempted to enslave their motherland. So, they resolved to carry on the war as vigorously as ever. And again did Lakshmi Bai and the brave Tatia Tope begin to make preparations for the coming deadly fight. While these arrangements are going on there, we shall take a rapid glance at the activities of Brigadier Whitlock whom we had left sometime back. To reconquer the tract between the Narbada and the Ganes and the Jumna, two armies had started and, of these, the one under Sir Hugh Rose, as we had already seen, had taken Jhansi. When Jhansi was taken, the British indulged in a wholesale looting such as Nadir Shah alone had accomplished before, defiling of temples and polluting of images, and massacring terribly all alike. That finished, the army continued the campaign. The last part of the campaign had been appointed for Brigadier Whitlock to accomplish. Accordingly, Brigadier Whitlock started on the 17th of February from Jubbulpore, with all his army - European regiments, Indian regiments from Madras, “black” and white cavalry, and splendid artillery. He entered Sagar in triumph, where the loyal Raja of Oorcha joined him. The, the English army began to advance on the Nabob of Banda, the chief leader of the Revolutionaries in that province. In the beginning of the Revolution at Jhansi, Sagar, and other places, cruel massacres had taken place and the Europeans from those places ran wherever they could to save their lives. The Nabob had brought them to his palace and was looking after them well. But, at the same time, he was as busy in trying to throw off the British yoke already tottering through the shocks of the Revolution as he was in saving the lives of these Enbglishmen. From the very beginning, the symbols of slavery in his kingdom had been smashed and he was runing as an independent prince. Seeing the English army coming to deprive him of his liberty, the Nabob, urged and aided by the whole populace, was ready for battle. Several engagements took place between the two parties, but, being defeated in them, the Nabob started for Kalpi with his army, and Whitlock entered Banda in triumph on the 19th of April. The next march was to be on the Rao of Kirwi. Rao Madhav Rao of Kirwi was a child of ten and his guardianship was in the hands of the English. The Rao of Kirwi was a near relation of Baji Rao Peshwa. In 1827, Anant Rao, the then ruler of Kirwi, deposited two lakhs of Rupees with the English Government for some charities in connection with the temples of Benares. As soon as he died, the English swallowed the whole amount. More than that, they took unlawful possession of a further sum of several lakhs of Rupees foolishly deposited with them by Anant Rao’s son, Vinayak Rao, in spite of the lesson he had already received. This was soon after Vinayak Rao’s death. Rao Madhav, the adopted son of Vinayak Rao, being a minor, as the supervision of the whole state was in the hands of the English, and Ramachandra Rao, the chief Karbhari, had been appointed by the English, there was every reason to suppose that there would not be much fear of revolt in the Kirwi State. But, in 1857, whatever the Raos and Maharaos did was not quietly acquiesced in by the people. Sometimes obsecurely and sometimes clearly, the power of the people, the strength of the real nation, was slowly struggling into prominence. The Zemindars, the priests, the merchants of Kirwi, nay, even the common people, inspired by the strong ideal of liberty, hailed with joy the news which one day proclaimed Delhi free and the next day Lucknow and the third that Jhansi had uprooted the flags of the Feringhi. Encouraged by these hopeful incidents, they proclaimed the independence of Kirwi and the destruction of the alien yoke, not waiting for the opinion of the Rao or the sanction of his ministers. Now, while this proclamation was being loudly celebrated by the populace, the Rao, a boy of nine or ten, had not done even a single thing against the English! Nay, when the English army returned to Bundelkhand, he went forward to receive them and invited them into the city. According to his invitation, the English army entered the city silently, but they entered to imprison this little Rao, to destroy his capital and to pull down his palace! Dreadful looting,59 wholesale burning, and a vengeance of wickedness took place. And the State was annexed. Whitlock now encamped at Mahoba, in order to ‘pacify’ the conquered provinces. As a matter of fact, he had now completed his campaign. He had conquered all the eastern part of Bundelkhand and he had sent small expeditions to ‘pacify’ one or two places. So now, leaving Whitlock, let us again follow the sacred steps of the gallant Queen of Jhansi. The Ranee, now again full of hope, made an advance on Kunchgaon, forty-two miles from Kalpi, with the army of te Peshwa. But the Rao Sahib, if would appear, had not arranged the forces as she would have liked him to. It must be borne in mind, however, that it was not possible to make effective arrangements, either for Rao Sahib or Tatia Tope. Though in that place, the Nabob of Banda, the Raja of Shahgarh, and the Raja of Banapur had all gathered together under the same flat, they had not gathered together as the organised and disciplined parts of a grand military force, moved by oneness of heart, with a unity of plan and constitution, sustained by strict military discipline and subordination. No one could get his ideas carried out. But, in the opposing army, there was no such conflict amongst leaders. It seemed that the whole organisation was perfect and wellcontrolled. Before Sir Hugh Rose was appointed commander, there was heated discussion and difference of opinion; but, once he was the 59 “With regard to this injustice done to Rao, Malleson has to confess : “Not a shot had been fired against him (Whitlock), but he resolved nevertheless to treat the young Rao as though he had actually opposed the British forces. The reason for this perversion of honest dealing lay in the fact that in the palace of Kirwi was stored the wherewithal to compensate soldiers for many a hard fight and many a broiling sun. In its vaults and strong rooms were specie, jewels, and diamonds of priceless value….. The wealth was coveted.” – Kaye and Malleson’s Indian Mutiny, Vol. V, pages 140,141. commander, his opinion was the opinion of all. Whatever orders he issued were right; and, even if they were not right, they must be obeyed. And even mistaken orders of a weak general carried out by the obedient and unanimous bravery of the troops under him, become successful – are bound to become successful. On the other hand, even well-planned orders of a capable general lead to disaster and defeat, through the self-willed behaviour of the troops and the lack of oneness in command and proper subordination. Otherwise the rout at Kunchgaon could never have been place. As soon as Sir Hugh Road came from Jhansi, the Revolutionaries met him at Kunchgaon. Knowing that the mid-day sun was unbearable to the English, the Revolutionaries had ordered in one of their commands, “None should engage in a fight with the Feringhis before ten in the morning. The fight should begin always after ten.” This very clever rule was put into practice this day. Much havoc was thereby created in the English army as happened on many other occasions where the fight took place after ten. But, in spite of this, the Revolutionaries were defeated at Kunchgaon and retired towards Kalpi. The admirable way in which they retired, the organised manner in which they fell back has been praised very much even by the enemy.60 But then this excellent organisation came after and not before the engagement. 60 “Then was witnessed action on the part of the rebels which impelled admiration from their enemies. The manner in which they conducted their retreat could not be surpassed. They remembered the lessons which the European officers had well taught them. There was no hurry, no disorder, no rushing to the rear. All was orderly as on a field-day. Though their line of skirmishers was two miles in length, it never wavered in a single point. The men fired, then ran behind the relieving men, and loaded. The relieving men then fired, and ran back in their turn. They even attempted, when they thought the pursuit was too rash, to take up a position, so as to bring on it an enfilading fire.” - Malleson’s Indian Mutiny, Vol. V, page 124. With this defeat, the Revolutionaries came on to Kalpi. There, they began to make up for the defeat by wrangling against and abusing one another, - the infantry laid the defeat at the door of the cavalry, the cavalry blamed the Jhansi troops, and all together blamed the general, Tatia. But, Tatia Tope is not going to come any more to Kalpi to hear these wranglings. He has gone at present to the village of Charkhi, near Jalwan, to see his father. No one knows definitely where he is going after that, or whether he is going there at all. Let us remember that Gwalior lies in the direction of his road ! May the meeting between this extraordinary son and his fortunate father be full of love! And after that loving visit, may this great messenger of the Revolution go with despatch to carry out whatever designs he might have set his heart on! While Tatia was going on this journey, Ranee Lakshmi went to the royal tent of the Peshwa. The heroic Lakshmi relieved him of his dejection after the defeat of Kunchgaon and said to him that, if the army was properly organised, the enemy should never again be victorious. The Nabob of Banda was inspired by her speech. Proclamations in spirited language were again published in the Revolutionary army. And to-day, on the banks of the Jumna, crowds are gathering. Swords and guns, angry Sepoys invoking the Jumna to bless the cause of the indedpendence of their soil - such a Revolutionary pilgrimage the banks of the Jumna had probably never before seen. These banks are simply echoing forth the triumphant cries for the Mother and for Dharma!” Jai Jumna! With this thy sacred water in our hands, we swear that the Feringhis shall be extinct, that Swadesh shall be independent, and that Swadharma shall be re-established! Jai Jumna! If all this is accomplished, then alone we will live. If not, we will die this day on the field of battle. We swear, by thee, O Kalindi, three times!” Heroes, thrice bound by this oath, come on then to the field. Rao Sahib will lead the whole army. Drive away this 25th infantry under Sir Hugh Rose. They are all Indians - drive these traitors before you! Major Orr advances - make him share the same defeat! In this maidan before Kalpi, our position - with this undulatory part to cover - is almost impregnable. But look, the vanguard is falling back! It went too far, and being not well covered, has had to retreat. Run then, Lakshmi, run to protect them. She rushed forward sword in her hand with lightning-like rapidity, and fell on the right wing of the English, with her red-uniformed cavalry. The triumphant right stopped dead, so sudden was the attack; stopped dead, and then retired back helpless. This rapid onslaught of the girl of twenty-one, her horse at full speed, her sword cutting men down to the right and to the left, - seeing this, who would not fight for her? Who would not be inspired by her? All the Revolutionaries were inspired by her strength; the battle raged bloody and hot. The Feringhi gunners of the light field artillery began to die one after another. The Ranee and her cavalry, then, advanced right on the guns which were spitting deadly fire, and attacked the artillery. English gunners left the guns; the horse artillery was routed; the heroes of the Revolution advanced on and on, from all sides, overjoyed at the prospect of crushing the Feringhis who had so long escaped them; and before them all fought Lakshmi! This praise by the enemy does credit to the Panday party. Sir Hugh Rose, taken aback by this terrible onslaught, then advanced with his reserve camels, and the English saved their own lives, simply because of the camels. An English writter says, “Fifteen minutes more, and the mutineers would have cut us down! Fresh camels, one hundred and fifty in number, changed the fortunes of the day. Ever since that day, I have looked on the camel with eyes of affection.” By the strength of the camelmen alone, on the 22nd of May, the Feringhis succeeded in forcing the Peshwa’s army to retire towards Kalpi. After another complete defeat of the Peshwa’s troops and after a few skirmishes, Sir Hugh entered Kalpi on the 24th May. In the fort of Kalpi, the English captured a very considerable amount of military supplies which Shri Rao Sahib Peshwa and Tatia Tope had, with great trouble, gathered together in one year. Sixty thousand pounds of gunpowder were found buried under the ground; muskets beautifully made, brass balls of the latest type for the guns, factories for making and repairing cannon-balls, heaps of military uniforms, flags, drums, French trumpets, Howitzer guns manufactured in Europe, and arms of various kind - such was the very useful find that the English army came upon! What they did not capture was the brave and ever-memorable leaders of the Revolutionaries. For, when Kalpi fell after a week, Rao Sahib, the Nabob of Banda, Ranee Lakshmi Bai, and other leaders had left Kalpi and gone - nobody knew where. But now these unfortunate, helpless people, without an army and without arms, could do nothing beyond falling into the jaws of death, either by privations, or ny capture, or ny suicide! Thus Sir Colin had begun the reconquest from the northern bank of the Jumna, and went on conquering as far as the Himalayas. Sir Hugh Rose and Whitlock be.gan from the Narbada, and conquered all the country as far as the South bank of the Jumna. The English had now every reason to congratulate themselves that they had destroyed the Revolution completely. Sir Hugh Rose congratulated his army in these eloquent words :- “Soldiers, you have marched one thousand miles, captured one hundred guns, swam rivers, crossed mountains, marched through jungles, defeated big armies, reconquered extensive tracts, and reestablished the glory of your country! Brave you are; and you have also observed the strictest discipline; for courage without discipline is nought. In the midst of difficulties, temptations, and trouble, you have obeyed strictly the orders of your general, and have never showed even a single sign of insubordination. From the waters of the Narbada to the waters of the Jumna, this, your success, has come to you through your splendid discipline!” After publishing this glorifying proclamation, Sir Hugh resigned his charge for the sake of his health. And the triumphant English army, having destroyed the enemy completely, sighed the sigh of relief and wished to rest. But how dare you rest yet? While Tatia and Ranee Lakshmi Bai are alive, there is no rest possible for the British troops. Come, stand up! And if you would not stand of your own accord, here is the whole force of Gwalior, ready to goad you on! After escaping from Kalpi, the Revolutionary leaders went to Gopalpur to discuss their future plans. Practically, at this time, there was not a sign of hope. From the Narbada to the Jumna, and from Jumna to the Himalayas, the English had conquered back the whole territory. The Revolutionaries were without an army, without a fort, without any hope of getting fresh forces - defeated as they were again and again. But Tatia Tope was still alive, and that was enough! Tatia, too, had returned to Gopalpur. People say he had returned after visiting his father. Whatever people say, history does not say so. It was when Sir Hugh tried his deep-laid game at Kalpi that Tatia had a sudden fit of fondness for his father - a fondness, by -the-bye, which seemed to exceed even his fondness for fight; and, no longer able to control his filial feelings, he want to Charkhi to see his father. What was the secret of this sudden passion? The secret was that, as soon as Kalpi fell, it was absolutely necessary to get hold of some other strong position, some strong fortress, and some new army. And, therefore, this Messenger of the Revolution had escaped from Kalpi secretly to enter Gwalior, and see how the Revolutionary idea was progressing there! He accepted the promises of the chief officers of the army and created a new army for the Revolution, by secretly winning over the Durbar functionaries, Sirdars, and others. They promised to give him all the aid they could, and in one month he had the whole of Gwalior in the hollow of his hand. He then collected every information about the military position of Gwalior and, thus, after undermining the throne of the Scindia, Tatia returned to Rao Sahib at Gopalpur. He had ‘seen his father’! Learning the glad news, that Tatia had come back from Gwalior having successfully won over the people to the sided of the Revolution, Ranee Lakshmi urged the Peshwa to advance straight towards Gwalior. On the 28th of May, the Revolutionaries came to Amin Mahal. The Mahalkars tried to stop them. They were answered, “Who are you to obstruct us? We are the Peshwa and his forces and we are fighting for Swaraj and Swadharma.” These words of Rao Sahib silenced the cowards, and thousands of patriots in that part welcomes the Revolutionaries heartily, and thus the army of the Peshwa pressed right on the walls of the city of Gwalior. They had written to the Scindia, “We are coming to you in a friendly spirit. Remember our former relations. We expect help from you, so that we shall be enabled to proceed towards the south.” But this ungrateful man had forgotten the former relations. Well then, remember the former and the present relations too! “The ancestors of the Scindia were our servants, our Hujres - that was the former relation. And, the present relation? The whole army of the present Scindia has joined us. Tatia had gone to Gwalior, seen the leaders, and gained all necessary information!” But still, forgetting all this the Scindia, with all his army and all his guns, advanced on the Peshwa on the 1st of June, near Gwalior. The Shrimant who deserves the respect of the whole country thought for a moment that the Scindia had repented and was coming forward to salute the flag of Swadesh. But, Lakshmi said that he was coming, not to salute, but to smash that golden flag. She came forward with her three hundred horsemen and advanced right on the guns of the Scindia. Soon, she caught the view of Jayaji Rao Scindia and his personal guard the brave “Bhaleghate” troops. The cobra shows not such rage when it is trodden upon as Lakshmi showed at the sight of this traitor! Like an arrow she dashed at his troops. Behold, you Bahadur - descendant of Mahadaji, this helpless girl of twenty-two, brought up in the Zenana, is inving you for a trial of strength of the sword! Let us all see now how much of the prowess of Mahadaji, the devoted lover of his country, has descended upon this Jayaji the devoted slave of the Feringhi! As soon as this angry lightning struck him hard on the front, his personal guards wavered and the Scindia, with all his “Bhaleghate” troops,was routed. But, at least, there was hope that his huge army and terrible artillery would do their best - and they did do their best! As soon as they saw Tatia, these troops which had been bound over by secret oaths to Tatia refused, point-blank, to fight against the Peshwa. As previously arranged, they joined the Peshwa with all their officers; the guns were silent and everyone in Gwalior honoured the flag of the Peshwa. The throne of the Scindia thus crumbled to pieces at the touch of the Revolutionary magician. And so, Jayaji Rao Scindia, coward as he was, and his minister, Dinkar Rao, fled, not only from the field, but from Gwalior itself, and ran to Agra! Gwalior, was now mad with joy. The army fired salutes in honour of the Shrimant. The Finance Minister, Amar Chand Bhatia, surrendered the whole treasury of the Scindia, to the last pie, to Shrimant. Those few patriots who were in prison under the old regime for having shown sympathy with the Revolutionaries were released from their prisons amidstthe joyous cries of the populace. The traitors who had advised the Scindia to join the English had fled, but their mansions and their property were destroyed so that not a vestige of them remained. The black charge that the Asiatics do not understand the true relation between a ruler and his subjects, was washed away completely by Gwalior. For, how can he who goes against his own country and against his own Dharma be a ruler? Poona had been in 1818 guilty of being a traitor to the motherland is not having dragged Rao Baji from his Peshwai in right time. Gwalior was not guilty of that! And therefore, this Revolution of 1857 must be recorded in history as the first indication in modern India of the omnipotence of the vox populi, the power of the people. If Scindia joins not his country, the country shall not aid him either. Swords and guns, infantry and cavalry, Durbar and Sirdars, Mankarees and citizens, temples and images - all are for the country, alone; and if the Scindia is not for the country, drag him down from his throne; and outside the palace, outside the capital, outside the borders of the kingdom let him be driven out! Hereafter, according to the Scriptures, “The King receives his power only by pleasing the people!” And now, we must not let this auspicious day, the 3rd of June, slip by uselessly. And so “a big Durbar was held in Phul Bagh. All Sirdars, statesmen noblemen, Shiledars, and cavalry officers, who had joined the Shrimant, took their seats according to their rank. Tatia Tope and the Arabs, Rohillas, Pathans, Rajputs, Rangdes, Pardeshis, and others under him came to the Durbar in their military uniform and with swords by their side. The Shrimant himself was dressed in the Peshwa’s uniform Shirpana and Kalgitura on head, pearls in his ears, and pearl and diamond necklaces, round his neck. Thus, with all the paraphernalia of the Peshwai, Bhaldars and Chobdars making way for him, and Mourchas flying, the Shrimant came to the Durbar. Then, as usual, all stood up in reverence, salutes were received, and the Shrimant ascended the throne. With tears of joy in his eyes, he congratulated all the noblemen with great eloquence. Ram Rao Govind was appointed Chief Minister. Tatia Tope was made general and a sword studded with precious stones was presented to him. The eight ministers were elected. Twenty lakhs of Rupees were distributed to the army. The Durbar was a complete success. Joy was on every face and salutes of guns were fired.“61 Shrimant Rao Sahib, representative of Nana Sahib Peshwa, had thus established a new throne, infusing a new hope and a new life into the Revolutionary party, and had created a centre, a basis, round which might be attracted the scattered forces of the Revolution. Tatia Tope was not mad in busying himself with this coronation and giving salutes after salutes just 61 D.B.Parasnis’s Life of Lakshmi Bai, page 309. in a midst of the war. The whole world had seen the dead body of the Revolution which by this means alone he now lifted from the grave of despair. The world – some with pleasure and others with despair – had cried : “That is a dead body, there is no life in it!” But what wonderful magic this! Tatia took the dead earth at Gopalpur, he breathed on it thus, and – wonderful! – the whole world saw with the dumbness of surprise, a throne rising from the thimbleful of earth, jingling with lakhs of Rupees! Wonder of wonders! See the thousands of swordsmen advancing; hear the salutes thundering forth from the guns! A new army is up, new guns are up, Tatia has captured a new kingdom! Tatia has done all this not meely to strike the world dumb with his splendid triumph. He knew that the Revolutionaries who had spread far and wide would, on hearing the salutes proclaiming the Shrimant as a Peshwa of the Mahratta empire, get a concentrated inspiration, vigour, and hope. He knew that the sight of the triumphant flag of the nation, thus unfurled at Gwalior, would infuse an uncontrollable enthusiasm and dash. He knew that the lawlessness which had set in owing to the want of a rallying point, would now make way for discipline, through respect for the new-established throne. All this Tatia saw. And what he foresaw soon came to pass. For the body of the Panday party was soon instinct with life. While thus, on the one hand, his countrymen were encouraged, the English army, which just gave a sigh of relief, was, on the other hand, again disheartened. It was for this that the coronation was proclaimed loudly by Tatia and other leaders of the Revolution. Their deep- laid game was successful. For, by this very thunder of Tatia’s cannon, Sir Hugh Rose’s idea of rest was rudely shattered to pieces!62 62 Malleson, writing about the cleverness and diplomacy which Tatia and Lakshmi Bai showed in taking Gwalior, says :- “How the “Impossible” happened has been told …. He (Sir Hugh Rose) realised, moreover, the great danger which would inevitably be caused by delay. No one could foresee the extent of evil possible if Gwalior were not promptly wrested from rebel hands. Grant them delay, and Tatia Tope, with the immense acquisition of political and military strength secured by the possession of Gwalior, and with all its resources in men, So far so good; but once having shocked Sir Hugh Rose and disheartened him, woe betide him who listened not to the words of Ranee Lakshmi Bai! All other functions but the one great function of war must be stopped. But it seemed that, as ill-luck would have it, the intoxication of the Revolutionaries would make them blind to the necessity of heeping the army in complete readiness. They were all immersed in luxury, good dinners, and fatal dilatoriness – they thought, perhaps, that this was the sole end of Swaraj! They were onlo losing Swaraj. For, the surprised Sir Hugh Rose marched rapidly on Gwalior with his excellent army under him. He brought with him the renegade Scindia and proclaimed to all that the English were going to fight only for the Scindia’s sake! It was a trick to deceive the simple men of Gwalior, who had the slavish and discreditable merit of blind loyalty, and it was calculated to prevent these from fighting against the Scindia. But the old world had changed, giving place to the new. Tatia, so far successful in awakening the Revolutionaries, rushed forward to meet the English. The English had already defeated the Morar contingents. Now, with the shadow of defeat on them, there began some excited movements among the Revolutionary leaders. Rao Sahib was hastening towards the house of the Nabob of Banda and the Nabob of Banda was rushing towards the house of Rao Sahib. But, in the midst of all this confusion, the Ranee alone was calm and was ready. Her sword was out. What need she fear now? Hope as well as despair she had trampled under money and material at his disposal, would be able to form a new army on the fragments of that beaten at Kalpi, and to provoke a Mahratta rising throughout India. It might be possible for him, using the dexterity of which he was a master, to unfurl the Peshwa’s banner in the southern Mahratta districts. Those districts were denudedof troops, and a striking success in Central India would probably decide their inhabitants to pronounce in favour of the cause for which their fathers had fought and bled.” - Malleson’s Indian Mutiny, Vol. V, pages 149-150. foot; she treated with contempt the things on this earth; she had one aspiration alone, namely, that the flag of liberty should stand proudly erect until she gave up her last breath! Neither of them were to be in the dust; they were to lie in battle alone. So, she gave Rao Sahib a word of courage, rearranged the undisciplined troops as far as she could, and took upon herself the task of guarding the eastern gate. She only demanded, “I am ready with all my soul to do my duty; mind, you do yours!” She donned her usual military uniform, rode a noble steed, took out her gem-bestudded sword from the sheath, and ordered the army under her to march on. She made ready all the posts near Kotaki Serai which had been given to her care and, when the English army was in sight, everywhere, trumpets and pipes, drums and nagaras rent the air. If only she had an army, equal in courage and daring to herself! Even the insubordinate and hesitating felt heroic under her influence and, with them and her select band of horsemen, she charged hard the English army! Her two female friends, Mandar and Kashi, also fought bravely by her side. May the sweet memory of those two patriotic girls - beautiful in appearance, with male attire put on, taking pleasure in fight - live in history along with that of their mistress as long as history lives! A general like Smith was charging the Ranee’s army, but to-day the Ranee’s bravery and daring were a sight to see. Like lightning, she moved about all day. The English attacked the solid phalanx a number of times. One very occasion she maintained her hold firm. Her army occasionally felt enthusiastic and attacked the British and cut down many of them. At last, Smith was forced to retire; he gave up the attempt of breaking the mass and began to turn to another side, leaving the nest of the cobra alone! Thus closed the day and thus rose the 18th of the month! This day, the English had resolved to make desperate charges. From all directions, they advanced on the fort, and tried their utmost. General Smith, forced to retire the day before, was very determined to-day and, aided by re- inforcements, he charged the same Jhansi side he had gone for the day before. Sir Hugh Rose thought that his presence was also absolutely necessary and so he was personally present with the force attacking the Jhansi side. The Ranee too was ready for him with all her forces. “She was ready with all her soul to do her duty.” That day, she wore a Chanderi turban embroidered all over, a tamamee cloak, and pyjamas. A pearl necklace was round her neck. Her famous steed being tired that day, a new, fresh-looking horse was made ready for her, fully caparisoned. While her two beautiful maids were taking sherbet, news came that the English were advancing. Lakshmi immediately darted forwarded from her tent. The arrow flies not so rapidly, the lightning flashes not forth with such force from the clouds, a lioness leaves not her lair so quickly to fall upon the approaching elephant! She rode her horse, lifted her sword, and charged the enemy with her army. As English writer says, “Immediately the beautiful Ranee went over the field and made a firm stand against the array of Sir Hugh Rose. She led her troops to repeated and fierce attacks and, though her ranks were pierced through and were gradually becoming thinner and thinner, the Ranee was seen in the foremost rank, rallying her shattered troops and performing prodigies of valour. But all was of no avail. The camel corps, pushed up by Shri Huge Rose in person, broke her last line. Still the dauntless and heroic Ranee held her own.” But while her side was fighting with such unexampled bravery, she saw the English army advancing on her rear - for they had broken through the ranks of Revolutionaries who were holding the posts behind her! The artillery dumb, the main army routed, the victorious English army closing on her from all sides, with only fifteen or twenty horsemen with her, Ranee Lakshmi, accompanied by her maids, put her horse to a gallop, in order to break through the enemy, and to join her comrades on the other side. The Feringhi horsemen of the Hussars, who knew not so far where she was, fired shot after shot on her and pursued her like hounds. But the Queen, with unexampled courage, cleared her way with her sword and marched on. Suddenly was heard a cry, “I am dead, Bai Sahib, I am dead!” Alas, whose is this cry? Lakshmi turned round and found that it was her maid Mandar whom a white soldier had shot and killed! Angered, she attacked the Feringhi, and her blow felled him on the spot. She had avenged the death of fair Mandar! She then marched on. She came to a small rill. Now, one jump and Jhansi would have been out of the Feringhi’s clutches. But her horse would not take that jump! If only she had had her old horse! As if the fiery line of a magician was round him the horse moved in circles, round and round, but would not cross. Before you could say “one”, the English horsemen closed on her! Still not a word of surrender or fear! One sword against their several swords, - yet she closed on them. She crossed sword with sword with them all, but one of them hit her on the head from behind. With that blow, the right part of her head, and even her right eye came out - just then, another blow hit her on the chest. Oh Lakshmi, Lakshmi! The last drop of thy sacred blood is dripping and, therefore, now, Mother, take this last sacrifice for thee! Even at the point of death, she killed the British foe who had attacked her, and now the young Queen was breathing her last breath! A faithful servant, Ramchandra Rao Deshmukh, was near. He took her to a cottage near by. Ganga Das Bawa gave her cold water to drink to quench her thirst and a bed to lie down upon. Bathed in blood, this goddess of war reclined on the bed, and then her soul quietly fleeteed from her body to heaven! As soon as she was dead, Ramchandra Rao, in accordance with her dying instructions prepared a pile of grass unseen by the enemy; he put her on that pure and, before the touch of slavery could defile even her dead body, she was cremated. On the pyre, if not on the throne! But Lakshmi is still with her sweetheart Liberty! She has forced open the gates of death by falling in battle and has now entered the other world. Pursuit can no longer harm her. Wicked Pursuit must pass through those roaring flames before it can do so. Thus fought Lakshmi. She had achieved her purpose, fulfilled her ambition, carried out her resolve! One such life vindicates the whole existence of a nation! She was the concentrated essence of all virtues. A mere woman, hardly twenty-three yet, beautiful as rose, charming in her manners, pure of conduct, she had a power of organisation of her subjects, exhibited by very few, even among men. The flame of patriotism was always burning in her heart. And she proud of her country’s honour and pre- eminent in war! It is very rarely that a nation is so fortunate as to be able to claim such an angelic person, as a daughter and a queen. That honour has not yet fallen to the lot of England. In the Revolution of Italy, high ideals and heroism of the very highest type are to be found; yet, in all this period of glody, Italy could not give birth to Lakshmi! But, even our land could hardly have given birth to such a Queen but for this glorious War of Independence! The precious pearls in the ocean are not to be found on its surface. The Suryakanta jewel does not give out flames in the quiet of the night; nor does the flint give up its spark on soft cushions. They want resistance. Injustice must make the mind restless; really, not apparently, every drop of blood most actually boil; intense national feeling is thus set aflane in such a furnace, the particles of virtue begin to flow, the test goes on, the dross is eliminated, then, the concentrated essence of virtues begins to appear. In 1857, the heart of this our Motherland took fire; then, a terrible explosion which would deafen the world took place; - A spark at Meerut, and the whole country, which, under the roller of Dalhousie, had been reduced to the monotony of a dead level and seemed to be a heap of dust, proved to be a powder-magazine filled with the most inflammable material. Just as when a mighty rocket in a fireplay, fired in the air, explodes, arrows and trees and various other picturesque objects rise and rush and burn and die away, such was the case of this gigantic Revolutionary Rocket! Its length is from Meerut to the Vindhyas; its width from Peshawar to Dumdum;- and it was fired! Fire and flames raged in all directions. Blood coming down like rain, - sieges of Delhi, revenges of Plassey, massacres of Cawnpore, and the Sikandar Bagh of Lucknow! Thousands of heroes are fighting - and dying; cities are burning. Kumar Singh comes, struggles, falls; the Moulvie comes, struggles, and falls; the throne of Cawnpore, the throne of Lucknow, the throne of Delhi, the throne of Bareilly, the throne of Jagadishpur, the throne of Jhansi, the throne of Banda, the throne of Furrukabad, five thousand, ten thousand, fifty thousand, a lakh of swords, flags, banners, generals, horses, elephants - all are coming out out after another, move about in the turmoil of the raging fire! Some are ascending one flame, some another; they poise themselves a while, reel, fight, fall down unseen! Everywhere battle and thunder-storms! A veritable volcanic conflagration this! And the pyre, flaming near the cottage of Gangadas Bawa, is the last and the most lustrous flame of this raging volcanic conflagration of the War of Independence of 1857! END OF THE THIRD PART">

  <meta name="twitter:title" content="10 RANI LAKSHMI BAI">
  <meta name="twitter:description" content="GIVE up my Jhansi? I will not. Let him try to take who dares!&#34; With this challenge the heroic Ranee of Jhansi rose against the British and as it is recorded in previous parts of this History she assumed the leadership of the Revolution, drove the English and began to rule at Jhansi as the Queen of the province. The forces of the Revolution had wreaked a bloody vengeance on the English people and army and left not a trace of their rule at Sagar. Naogaon, Banda, Banapur, Shahgarh and Karki. The people everywhere hailed the Queen as their own. She then busied herself - in restoring order and peace in her liberated province. The Ranee’s daily life at this period has been described as follows :- “The Bai got up at five in the morning and took a bath with fragrant attar. After dressing - and she generally wore a Chanderi Saree of faultless white - she would sit for her daily prayers. First, she dropped the necessary water as a prayaschitta for keeping hair on her head after her husband’s death; then, she used to worship the Tulsi in the Tulsi grove. Then began the Parthiva Puja at which the Durbar musicians would sing in choir. Puraniks would then start reading the Puran. Then, Sirdars and dependants came and she returned their usual salutes. Being very keen of memory, even if a single man among the seven hundred and fifty who paid their respects to her in the morning was not present, the very next day, the Bai would not fail to inquire why he did not come the previous day. After the worship of God began the dinner. After dinner, she would take an hour’s siesta unless there was urgent work to do. Then she would order the presents of the morning to be brought before her, which was done on silver trays covered over with silk cloths. Those things that she liked, she accepted; the others were given over to the Kothiwalla (minister of the presents department) for distribution amongst her servants. At three she went to the Durbar, when she usually put on male attire. She wore a pyjama, a coat of dark blue, a cap on the heat, and a beautiful turban on the top of it, a dupeta of embroidered cloth round the slender waist, and the sword decked with gems by her side. Attired in this wise, this fair woman looked like Gauri herself. Sometimes, she wore the female dress. After her husband’s death, she never wore nath or similar ornaments. Her hands had round them bangles of diamond; she wore a small necklace of pearls round her neck and a diamond ring on her little finger. These were the only jewels worn by the Bai Sahib. Her hair was gathered up together behind. She wore a white saree and a plain white bodice. Thus, sometimes in male attire and sometimes in female, the Bai Sahib used to honour the Durbar by her presence. Those assembled in Durbar never used to see her person. For the room in which she sat was separate from, and only opened into, the Durbar hall. Gold carving adorned the doors, and over these fell gracefully the chintz curtain, embroidered with gold cloths. In this room sat the Bai Sahib on a gadi of soft down, leaning on a soft pillow. Outside the door, two pages with maces of silver and sold always attended. Opposite the room, Lakshman Rao Dewanji stood with a bundle of important documents in his hand, and beyond him sat the Registrars of the Durbar. Being very keen and intelligent, the Bai quickly grasped every matter brought before her, and her orders were clear and definite and to the point. Sometimes she wrote her orders out herself. She was very careful in affairs of justice, and decided civil and criminal cases alike with great ability. Ranee Sahib worshipped Mahalakshmi devoutly. The temple of that Goddess was situated on the banks of a lake filled with lotus flowers, and every Friday and Tuesday the Bai visited the temple. One day, it so happened that after the Bai had returned from the temple and was passing through the south gate, she was thousands of beggars blocking the passage and creating a disturbance. So, she inquired of the Minister, Lakshman Rao Pande, the reason of this. He inquired and informed her that the people were very poor, and that they suffered immensely on account of excessive cold, and that, therefore, they requested that the Bai would kindly consider their condition. The Bai left very grieved for these poor people, and she at once issued orders - kind-hearted that she was - that, on the fourth day from thence, a gathering of beggars should take place, where every one should be provided with a thick coat and a cap and a blanket either white or black. The very next day, all the tailors of the town were given orders to make caps and coats. On the day appointed it was proclaimed that all the beggars were to gather in front of the palace. Poor people, too, had been included in his gathering. All were given clothes by the Bai and they went away satisfied In the fight with Nathe Khan when the wounded men were brought into the city, the Bai herself would insist on being present when their wounds were being dressed. Her very presence soothed their pain, and they felt themselves sufficiently rewarded by the kind and sympathetic interest she took in their well-being. The Ranee grieved at their grief, gave them ornaments and medals, patted them, and showed such sympathy that others, instead of being disheartened at the sight of these wounded soldiers, felt that they could even give up their lives for the sake of the Ranee. The grandeur of the Bai’s processions passes description. On the occassions of the visits to the temple of Mahalakshmi, she started sometimes in a palanquin, and sometimes on horseback. When in the palanquin, the palanquin would be covered with curtains of gold and embroidered cloths tied with golden ribbon. When she was on horseback, in male attire, the end of a thin and beautiful batti floated on her back and it fitted her admirably. The national flag of freedom was carried before her, with the band playing military music. Two hundred Europeans followed the flag and a hundred horsemen rode before and behind her. With the palanquin came the karbharis, ministers, feudatories, and other officers like Bhayya Sahib Upasane; and others either rode or followed on foot. Sometimes troops accompanied the procession. When the Bai started from the palace, the choughada on the fort made sweet music. The choughada of the nagarkhana of Mahalakshmi started at the same time.“54 And thus, from the Vindhyas to the Jumna, there was not a vestige of British authority left, Brahmins, Moulvies, Sirdars, Dorkdars, Sepoys, the police, Rajas, Raos, bankers, villagers - all were desirous fighting for only one thing, and that was Independence! And to unite together these thousand voices in one harmonious whole, the Lakshmi of Jhansi declared with her sweet but firm voice “None can have my Jhansi; he who dares may try!” Very rarely had the world heard such a firm “No!” Generous and liberal to a fault India has always been pronouncing and swearing by “I shall give!”, “I shall give!”, so far. But here was a strange phenomenon to-day - a set face and a stern voice which said, “I will not give! I will not give up my Jhansi!” Would to heaven, O Mother, that every one of thy sons and daughters had said the same! The Feringhi was taken aback at this unexpected assertion; and Sir Hugh Rose was sent, with five thousand armed men and a considerable number of guns, to gauge the extent of the disturbance and to quell it. In the beginning of 1858, the English had drawn up a complete military plan for the reconquest of all the territory, from the Himalayas to the Vindhyas, which was under the Revolutionaries. The whole territory was divided into two portions, and to each of them a huge army was sent to subdue it. We have in an earlier chapter described how commander-in- chief Sir Colin Campbell marched upwards from Allahabad to the north of the Ganges and the Jumna and, with his big army, conquered the Doab, and crossed the Ganges and marches on Lucknow; how, after destroying Lucknow, he extinguished the flames of insurrection ranging in Behar, in Benares and round if, and in Oudh; how he forced all the Revolutionaries 54 D.B.Parasnis’s Life of Lakshmi Bai, paged 147-151. into Rohilkhand, where the final engagement took place, and how, thus, the northern portion of the territory which was in the hands of the Revolutionaries was reconquered by the English. While Sir Colin was advancing from the north of the Jumna towards the Himalayas, Sir Hugh Rose advanced to conquer the southern portion lying between the Jumna and the Vindhyas. In the north, the Sikhs, the Gurkhas, and other Indian troops and feudatories had joined Sir Colin; so also in the south, Sir Hugh Rose had on his side the help of the princes of Hyderabad, Bhopal, and other states. He had, in addition, got the valuable assistance of the troops of Madras and Bombay and the Hyderabad contingent. To mention specially that the Indian troops had joined Sir Hugh Rose is unnecessary. For, to mention that Sir Hugh Rose was successful would imply the first proposition. For the English to obtain a victory, of themselves, is as impossible as the most impossible thing in the world. The traitorous Indian troops thus collected together for conquering the southern parts were divided into two divisions. One was under the command of Brigadier Whitlock who was to start from Jubbulpore and, subduing the provinces on the way, was eventually to join Sir Hugh Rose. The other was under Sir Huge Rose himself. As soon as Whitlock started from Jubbulpore, Sir Hugh was also to start from Mhow; he was to advance through Jhansi on Kalpi. According to the plan of campaign, Sir Huge started from Mhow on the 6th of January 1858 and, after a fight, he captured the fort of Rajgarh. From thence, he advanced to Sagar, released the prisoners kept there by the Revolutionaries, advanced further south, reducing various positions of the enemy on the way, captured Banapur on the 10th of March, and reconquered the famous fort of Chanderi. On the 20th of March, the triumphant English army encamped about fourteen miles from Jhansi. By these many struggles, bands of Revolutionaries distributed all over the country from the banks of the Narbada upwards, now crowded into Jhansi; and that is why Sir Hugh advanced with great dispatch on Jhansi to reduce this stronghold of the Revolutionaries. But Lord Canning and Sir Colin both issued orders to Sir Hugh first to relieve the Raja of Charkhari who was being besieged by Tatia. This order, if he obeyed it, would have spoiled Sir Hugh’s plan of reducing Jhansi. What was he to do? He could neither disobey nor find his way to obey the orders. As, in these trying circumstances, the best interests of the British government lay in advancing on Jhansi, Sir Robert Hamilton took upon himself the whole responsibility of disobeying the orders of the two highest authorities in Hindusthan; and the British army, emboldened by a high national feeling, advanced towards Jhansi, hopeful of victory. But the English army suffered enormously as soon as they set foot on the soil of Jhansi. For they found, to their great surprise, that all the tract of land surrounding Jhansi had been laid waste by order of the Queen in orderthat the enemy should have no supplies of any sort. Not a blade of corn in the fields, not a vestige of grass on the meadows, not a tree which could afford shelter; So had William of Orange, when there appeared to be a possibility of the Netherlands falling into the hands of the Spanish tyrant and invader, ordered that the dykes be opened and the sea let in, rather than that the country should fall in the hands of the enemy. And this day Jhansi had adopted a similar course. The same terrible thunder is in her voice; her eyes are spouting forth the red flames of anger! Mardan Singh, Raja of Banapur, the enraged chief of Shahagarh, the brave Thakurs, with their lives in their hands, Sirdars of Bundelkhand, resolute as ever, with their many followers - all these hot incendiary elements in the interior of Jhansi are burning and flame-red. The flames leap up even as the Jaripatka; and look, the central figure of the whole fight is there, shining above all! Aye, she is the central idea, the flashing impersonation of Swaraj! She is the inspiration, she is the incarnation of Liberty! In spite of the barrenness of the country around, the English approached Jhansi. For, thanks to the loyalty of the Scindia and the Raja of Tehri, the force was throughout the operations abundantly supplied with grass, firewood, and vegetables.55 As the Scindia and the Raja of Tehri are helping the Feringhis, surrounded as you are by treachery and disloyalty, betrayed by relations as by strangers, you have not the slightest hope of success. Why not then avoid extinction by surrendering to the English? But, surrender? And for the Ranee of Jhansi? Dewan Lakshman Rao, Moro Punt Tambe, brave Thakurs and Sirdars, all heroes of Liberty, if you surrender, you will be saved; if you fight, you will die. Which will you choose? Jhansi answered from her thousand mouths, sternly, in the words of the Scripture, “As everyone who is born must die, why sully fair fame uselessly?” So, it was determined to give battle to the English for the honour of the country. And Jhansi was busy by night and by day preparing for the fight. Brave men, there were many in her army; but trained men, there were very few. Want of discipline was very apparent. The queen herself, however, let the whole army. On every rampart and every gate, she was moving about actively; she was standing where guns were being planted and moved into position; she was budy selecting clever gunners; and she was to be found everywhere inspiring heroism even in the coldest hearts. The learned Brahmins of Jhansi were praying for the success of the country. Its temples blessed the soldier who went to the field, and tended the wounded who returned from battle; its workmen were busy preparing ammunition and other necessary for war. The men of Jhansi manned their guns, loaded the muskets; its women carried ammunition, built Top Khanas, supplied provisions.56 When the night of the 23rd fell, sounds of battle- drums were heard throughout the town and lighted torches shone forth at frequent intervals from the fort. The guards fired a few shots too. The 55 Malleson’s Indian Mutiny, Vol. V, page 110. 56 “The women were seen working in the batteries and carrying ammunition, etc.”- Sir Hugh Rose. morning of the 24th approached. No more delay now! The Ghanagarj (thunder-clap) gun began its work. The noise made by that gun was terrific. We shall quote an eye witness’s account of the early stages of the siege. “From the 25th, the engagement began in right earnest. The enemy poured in a heavy fire all day and night. In the night came cannon- balls on the forst and the city. The sight was terrible to see. A cannon-ball of fifty or sixty pounds weight would look as small as a tennis ball but red like live charcoal. During the day one would not see these balls clearly for daylight, but in the night, they were clearly visible and gave a weird appearance to the night. On the 26th, at midday, the English silenced the guns on the southern gate, and not a man could make a stand there. All men in the field were nearly disheartened at this. Then, the gunner on the western gate moved the gun round and fired at the enemy; the third shot killed the best gunner in the English army, and the English gun was silenced, in its turn. At this, the Bai Sahib was very pleased and presented the gunner with a silver anklet. The name of the brave gunner was Gulam Ghose Khan. He had displayed similar skill in the engagement with Nathe Khan also. “On the fifty or the sixth day, the same sort of engagement took place. For four or five hours, the Bai’s guns were working wonders and the English lost heavily. Many of their guns, too, were silenced for some time. Then again, the English guns would be more vigorous, and the Jhansi troops would be disheartened and their guns silenced. On the seventh day, at sunset, the gun to the left was disabled. None could stand there. The battlement was destroyed owing to the enemy’s fire. But in the night, eleven masons were brought under cover of blankets to the walls of the fort, and the work was completed before the day dawned. Thus, the battlement was repaired, and the English, to their great surprise, found the Jhansi gun in working order. At this time, the English were careless. They suffered considerably and their guns were disabled for quite a long time. “On the morning of the eighth day, the English army went for Shankar Killa. The English had very expensive and modern telescopes and, with their aid, they began to pour a heavy fire on the reservoir of water within the fort. Of the six or seven who approached near for taking water, four were killed: the others ran leaving their vessels there. As they could not get water for nearly four hours, even baths and other ordinary functions could not be carried on. Now, the gunners on the western and southern gates stopped the guns of the English attacking the Shankar Killa, by a continued fire on them. Then it became possible to get water from the reservoir for bath and dinner. There was a powder factory in the tamarind grove. As soon as two maunds of powder was prepared, it was taken to the sellers to be stocked. A cannon- ball fell on the factory, and thirty men and eight women were killed. On the same day, there was a great turmoil. There was a terrible fight. The fighters were shouting loudly. There was a terrific noise from muskets, and guns firing heavily. Trumpets and bugles were sounding everywhere. Dust and smoke filled the air. Many gunners on the ramparts and a number of Sepoys were killed. Others were appointed in their place. The Bai Sahib was working very hard. She looked to everything, issued the necessary orders, and repaired every point of weakness. By this, the men in the army were very much encouraged and fought continually. On account of this determined resistance, the English, in spite of all their powder and ammunition, could not enter the fort till the 31st of March.“57 But pressed as she is by this constant succession of disasters, why is Queen Lakshmi looking so earnestly in that particular direction? And see, she is smiling too! Be ready now and fire your salutes; let triumphal drums beat loudly; let war-cries rend the air! For there is Tatia Tope advancing with his army to aid Jhansi! 57 D.B.Parasnis’s Life of Lakshmi Bai, pages 187-193. with his twenty-two thousand troops. While playing as children, people hardly noticed them; to-day, the whole world is looking on their game! Tatia Tope has come with his army to dishearten the English army and to give courage to Jhansi. After the defeat of Wyndham at Cawnpore and Sir Colin’s victory, Tatia crossed the Ganges and joined Shrimant Nana. Then, leaving Nana, he crossed the Jumna near Kalpi. As the Raja of Charkhari refused to help in the war for the country started by the Peshwa, Tatia, as representative of the Peshwa, attacked his capital, punished the traitor well, captured twenty-four of his guns, and took from him a contribution of three lacs of Rupees. And then Tatia turned towards Kalpi. There, he received a letter from Ranee Lakshmi Bai requesting him to come to Jhansi and relieve the siege. He sent the note to the Rao Sahib Peshwa, the chief in authority; and, as soon as he got the orders, he charged the rear of the English army. It is on seeing him that a smile of hope has come to the lips of Lakshmi. These two had played together as children in the palace at Brahmavarta, without anyone noticing them particularly. To- day they are playing on the battle-field; the one, on the fortifications of Jhansi, is standing amidst rings of flaming fire, the other is approaching close to the Betwa, with his twenty-two thousand troops. While playing as children, people hardly noticed them; to-day, the whole world is looking on their game! Tatia had under him, now, the largest number of troops he ever had, and hence the English were not a little disconcerted. They would have been completely so in the battle too, handful as they were. For, in front of them was the Ranee Lakshmi Bai; behind them was this Mahratta tiger, with his twenty-two thousand claws. Why should he not, then, tear Sir Hugh to pieces and eat him up? He advanced to do this, but his twenty-two thousand claws seemed all of a sudden disabled, they could hardly be lifted. And what could even a tiger do without his claws? Alas! A most shameful poltroonish cowardice was exhibited by the Revolutionary troops on the river Betwa. The army of Jhansi was to attack the rear, and Tatia was to attack the front; the plan was admirable. But the English, with the dash of despair, advanced on Tatia and opened fire on Jhansi. This nullified the two attacks of the aggressive party. One determined attack, like that of the Mawalas of Shivaji or the select band of Kumar, and vultures had fed upon the Union Jack and its followers. But, the English charged straight on the enemy. The cowards did not even offer fight, and - was it treachery or terror - not a cannon-shot from Jhansi was heard. So, the army and its commander were routed and ran away. Plentiful military supplies were captured by the English, Tatia’s guns fell into their hands, and one thousand and five hundred of the Revolutionaries were killed in the pursuit. Fifteen hundred people killed in the flight! Mad men and fools! Instead of dying the death of cowards while fleeing, if you had only attacked Sir Huge Rose, you would have died the death of the Ghazis of Bareillyk, you would have destroyed the whole army with Sir Hugh Rose, and your name would have lived for ever! Yet God forgive you! If not our respect, you deserve at least our sympathy. For, howsoever you died, you died for the liberty of your country! May my country learn from your death at least the lesson that soldiers who fly to live, die, and that those who fight to die, live! And for death was Ranee Lakshmi Bai fighting! Why, then, this hopelessness on the part of Sirdars, Thakurs, and Sepoys? For nine days and nine nights, you stood the deadly charge of gun-fire in the hope that Tatia Tope would soon come to your aid. When he came, you shouted for delight; by the defeat of Tatia on the 1st of April, not only that joy but the very hope of victory is dashed to pieces; and those supplies, to deprive the enemy of which thousands of lives had been sacrificed, have fallen with ease into the enemy’s hands. Tatia’s ammunition and guns also have fallen into their hands. All this is certainly true. But, why this despair? The enemy may render it impossible for you to live victorious, but he cannot deprive you of a death of glory. There is nothing to despair for, then! And stop, hear the steady, firm, courageous voice of Ranee Lakshmi. “It was not relying on the Peshwa that Jhansi fought so long nor does she require his help to continue her fight in the future. So far, your bravery have been exhibited by you most admirably. I urge to do the same now and to fight with courage and desperation.” Aye, fight with desperation, be ready, let the battle-drums beat, and the trumpets sound! Let was-cries rend the air and let big guns thunder forth! The 3rd of April has dawned and the last assault of the English on Jhansi has begun. They are coming from all sides and pressing hard. Start, then, in right, good, deadly earnest! See how the goddess of war has taken the sword and see how she is making her way through the troops. She is moving about with lightning rapidity, presenting some with golden bracelets, some with dresses; some she is touching with her sacred touch to pat, to some she is offering her sweet smile; others she is encouraging with her heroic words. So now! Gulam Ghose Khan and Kuar Khuda Bhaksh, let the fire be most deadly! The enemy is storming the main gate and the fortifications, ladders have been planted at eight different places. “Har, Har, Mahadev!” From the fort, from ramparts, and from houses came a perfect shower of bullets, a constant succession of shots. The deep-mouthed cannon are vomiting forth burning red-hot balls. “Maro Feringhiko!” Lieutenant Dick and Lieutenant Meiklejohn have mounted the ladders and are calling upon their men to follow them. Boom, boom! Instantly, the daring Englishmen fell in the jaws of death! Anyone coming behind? Lieutenant Bonus and heroic Lieutenant Fox, you seem anxious for death - your desire shall be accomplished; - die, then! Seeing these four heroes who had scaled with the greatest difficulty shot down, the ladders trembled. They swayed and broke under the weight of the English troops. The English sounded the bugle to retire; the army began to go back - it went back, the soldiers concealing themselves behind every stray stone!58 58 “No sooner did we turn into the road leading towards the gate, than the enemy’s bugle sounded, and a fire of indescribabl e fierceness opened upon us from the whole line of the walls and from the tower of the fort overlooking this site. For a time it appeared like a sheet of fire, A strong defence was thus offered at the principal gate. But who is giving forth that tragic wail near the southern ramparts? May it be that mean treachery had lost the Morcha gate? Yes, unfortunately yes; the English have captured the gate, with the air of treachery - so it is said - and they have mounted the ramparts, and are advancing rapidly on. There was no other thought that day but to kill or be killed! Once within the city, the English gave no quarter and streams of blood flowed freely. The English, taking one position after another, massacring, firing, destroying - came right up to the palace. As soon as the palace was forced, thousands of Rupees were looted, guards were massacred, and buildings were destroyed. At last, alas! Jhansi had fallen into the enemy’s hands! Standing on the rampartrs, the Ranee looked back for one moment at Jhansi. Before her rose the hideous picture of the terrible disaster that had happened near the south gate. The enemy had, after all, defiled her Jhansi! Her eyes were ablaze with anger; she was almost mad with rage. She took up her sword and, with her small force of a thousand or fifteen hundred men, she marched down the fort. The tigress to avenge her cubs runs not so fleetingly. As soon as she saw the white troops near the southern gate, she rushed for them, and then, “swords crossed, the two armies were mixed up before you could count even fifty; swords flourished and dealt heard blows. Many Englishmen were killed. The rest ran towards the town and began to fire shots from under cover!” By this sight of Feringhi blood, the anger of this Kali was a little appeased, and now she saw that it was foolhardy to fight alone so far from the fort. But echoes of such daring heroism were now to be heard in every street in the city. Fifty stablemen in the palace, while the whole town and the palace itself was bathed in blood shed by English out of which burst a store of bullets, round shots, and rockets destined for our annihilation…… But the fire of the enemy waxed stronger, and amidst the chaos of sounds, of volleys of musketry and roaring of cannon, hissing and bursting rockets, stink-pots, infernal machines, huge stones, blocks of wood, and trees, all hurled upon our heads, it seemed as though Pluto and the Furies had been loosened upon us, carrying death amongst us fast. At this instant a bugle sounded on our right for the Europeans to retire.” – Lowe’s Central India, page 254. swords, refused to give up the stables! “Surrender” was a word not to be found in their dictionary. Everyone of these men cut down the enemy as hard as he could, and it was only when everyone of them was killed that the paga fell into the enemy’s hands! The English had, by now, rendered the whole town desolate. Everyone who fell into their hands, from children of five to old men of eighty, were massacred; the whole city was set fire to; wailings from the wounded and the dying, and the cries of those who killed, filled the air. A huge wail rose from the whole town! When the Queen stood on the walls of the fortress (which the enemy had decided to storm only the next day on account of its strength), looking at this sad, sad picture, she was smitten with grief and tears started to her eyes! The Queen of Jhansi wept! Those beautiful eyes were red with weeping! Her Jhansi to be reduced to this! Then she looked up and saw the flag of the Feringhi flying over the walls of Jhansi, and a strange fire shone from those weeping eyes! All glory to her courage! But why is this messenger running hard towards her? He said, “Your Majesty, the pre- eminently brave Sirdar who guarded the chief gate of the fort, Sirdar Kuar Khuda Buksh, and Gulam Ghose Khan, the chief gunner of the artillery, have both been shot down by the English!” What a blow this to the already afflicted Queen! What a succession of disasters this! What is your next plan, then, Queen? Aye, one and one alone! She said to the messenger, who was no other than an old Sirdar, &#34; I have determined to blow myself up with the fort, setting fire to the ammunition with my own hands.” With her Jaripatka she must be - if not on the throne, at least on the pyre! Hearing this, the old Sirdar calmly replied, “Your Majesty, as it is not safe to be in this neighbourhood now, your Majesty should leave the fort to-night breaking through the enemy’s camp and should join the Peshwa’s forces. If death comes on the way, the conquest of heaven by a dip in the sacred waters of the battle-field is always at hand!” Lakshmi said, “I should choose to die on the battle-field, but, being a woman, I fear that the enemy might insult my person!” To this the whole Durbar answered with one voice: “Insult! So long as there is life in the body of the least among us, our sword shall cut to pieces the enemy who woulod dare so much as touch your sacred person!” Well then, the night had fallen; Lakshmi greeted all her dear subjects and gave them her blessings for the last time! Her subjects were full of tears at the thought that she was leaving Jhansi, perhaps for ever. She took a selected number of horsemen with her. An elephant with jewels on him was placed in the middle and Ranee Lakshmi descended the fort amidst cries of “Har, Har, Mahadev!” She put on male apparel; a steel armour covered her person, a Jammia was in her girdle; a fine sword hung from her belt, a silver cup was in her Pudder, and her adopted child Damodar was on her back, tied in silk Dhoti. Thus accoutred, riding on a noble white steed, this queen, Lakshmi, looked like the goddess of war. When the north gate came, the sentry who belonged to the traitor army of the Tehri State asked, “Who goes there?” “The army of Tehri is going to the aid of Sir Huge Rose,” was the answer. The sentry was satisfied and Ranee advanced, evading the English sentry too in a similar manner. One maid, one bargeer, and ten or fifteen horsemen formed her body-guard, and marched through the camp of the enemy. But her other horsemen were stopped by the English on suspicion and had to fight hard. Moro Punt Tambe, wounded though he was, was able to run as far as Datia. But the traitor Dewan of that State captured him and gave him over to the English, who later on hanged him. But, Lakshmi, put your horse now in a gallop. For Lieutenant Bowker is galloping behind, followed by select horsemen, in order to capture you. And you, O horse, fortunate on account of the sacred treasure you carry, gallop on! Let the men of Bharata be traitors, but, ye animals, ye at least be faithful! O Night, drop the curtain of darkness between Queen Lakshmi and her enemies ! O horse, fleeting as you are, quicker than the wind, balance Lakshmi lightly! Ye paths, do not obstruct the horse’s onward march! O ye stars, shine not for the enemy, but just shine so that this tender beauty, delicate as a flower, should be encouraged on the way by your rays, cool as nectar! The dawn has now broken; so, heroic Queen, flying all night on the wings of the wind, rest thee near the village of Bhandeir. The Mahalkuree of the village will feed your darling Damodar. As soon as breakfast was over, she again started on her journey on the Kalpi road. But what is this dust behind? Spur your horses on! Lakshmi, keep Damodar safe on the back and gallop on. Tak our your sword! There, Bowker is pressing close! Here is the reward for your wicked pursuit! Dare you hold back the lightning? A long sweep of her sword, and Bowker was violently thrown off his horse. A deadly fight took place between her fifteen or twenty horsemen and the English pursuers; those who were alive advanced forward to protect Lakshmi Bai. Wounded Bowker and his handful of men gave up the pursuit. The sword of the Mother advanced triumphant, shining. The sun in the heaven above, Ranee Lakshmi Bai on earth - both were marching forward. Morning was gone and mid-day came, but the Ranee did not stop. Afternoon came, the shades of evening began to fall, the sun went down the horizon - but the Ranee still would not stop. The stars rose. They saw her just as they had seen her the night before - marching, marching in hot haste. At last, at midnight, Ranee Lakshmi entered Kalpi. A ride of a hundred and two miles she accomplished, and that, fighting with Lieutenant Bowker and his soldiers and with the burden of a child on her back. That horse just lived, it so seemed, to carry her to Kalpi. For, as soon as he saw the rider safe in Kalpi, he fell down on the ground all in a heap. Six men were immediately ordered to attend to the horse. The Ranee loved the horse very much. A horse which carried safe such a person with such faithfulness deserves to be remembered, and his memory will be loved for all time. The Ranee slept till dawn. In the morning, the touching meeting between the Ranee and Shri Rao Sahib Peshwa took place. Both remembered their ancestors - the thought that they were descended from those who had done such seemingly impossible deeds inspired them both. They realised that the flag of the Mahratta empire waved as far as Attock because men like the Scindia and the Holkar, the Gaekwar and Bundela and Patwardhan were ready to give up their lives for Swaraj. And for that very flag, for that very Swaraj for which their fathers and grandfathers had bled, they resolved to continue uninterrupted, to the very last breath of their lives, the war already begun against those who attempted to enslave their motherland. So, they resolved to carry on the war as vigorously as ever. And again did Lakshmi Bai and the brave Tatia Tope begin to make preparations for the coming deadly fight. While these arrangements are going on there, we shall take a rapid glance at the activities of Brigadier Whitlock whom we had left sometime back. To reconquer the tract between the Narbada and the Ganes and the Jumna, two armies had started and, of these, the one under Sir Hugh Rose, as we had already seen, had taken Jhansi. When Jhansi was taken, the British indulged in a wholesale looting such as Nadir Shah alone had accomplished before, defiling of temples and polluting of images, and massacring terribly all alike. That finished, the army continued the campaign. The last part of the campaign had been appointed for Brigadier Whitlock to accomplish. Accordingly, Brigadier Whitlock started on the 17th of February from Jubbulpore, with all his army - European regiments, Indian regiments from Madras, “black” and white cavalry, and splendid artillery. He entered Sagar in triumph, where the loyal Raja of Oorcha joined him. The, the English army began to advance on the Nabob of Banda, the chief leader of the Revolutionaries in that province. In the beginning of the Revolution at Jhansi, Sagar, and other places, cruel massacres had taken place and the Europeans from those places ran wherever they could to save their lives. The Nabob had brought them to his palace and was looking after them well. But, at the same time, he was as busy in trying to throw off the British yoke already tottering through the shocks of the Revolution as he was in saving the lives of these Enbglishmen. From the very beginning, the symbols of slavery in his kingdom had been smashed and he was runing as an independent prince. Seeing the English army coming to deprive him of his liberty, the Nabob, urged and aided by the whole populace, was ready for battle. Several engagements took place between the two parties, but, being defeated in them, the Nabob started for Kalpi with his army, and Whitlock entered Banda in triumph on the 19th of April. The next march was to be on the Rao of Kirwi. Rao Madhav Rao of Kirwi was a child of ten and his guardianship was in the hands of the English. The Rao of Kirwi was a near relation of Baji Rao Peshwa. In 1827, Anant Rao, the then ruler of Kirwi, deposited two lakhs of Rupees with the English Government for some charities in connection with the temples of Benares. As soon as he died, the English swallowed the whole amount. More than that, they took unlawful possession of a further sum of several lakhs of Rupees foolishly deposited with them by Anant Rao’s son, Vinayak Rao, in spite of the lesson he had already received. This was soon after Vinayak Rao’s death. Rao Madhav, the adopted son of Vinayak Rao, being a minor, as the supervision of the whole state was in the hands of the English, and Ramachandra Rao, the chief Karbhari, had been appointed by the English, there was every reason to suppose that there would not be much fear of revolt in the Kirwi State. But, in 1857, whatever the Raos and Maharaos did was not quietly acquiesced in by the people. Sometimes obsecurely and sometimes clearly, the power of the people, the strength of the real nation, was slowly struggling into prominence. The Zemindars, the priests, the merchants of Kirwi, nay, even the common people, inspired by the strong ideal of liberty, hailed with joy the news which one day proclaimed Delhi free and the next day Lucknow and the third that Jhansi had uprooted the flags of the Feringhi. Encouraged by these hopeful incidents, they proclaimed the independence of Kirwi and the destruction of the alien yoke, not waiting for the opinion of the Rao or the sanction of his ministers. Now, while this proclamation was being loudly celebrated by the populace, the Rao, a boy of nine or ten, had not done even a single thing against the English! Nay, when the English army returned to Bundelkhand, he went forward to receive them and invited them into the city. According to his invitation, the English army entered the city silently, but they entered to imprison this little Rao, to destroy his capital and to pull down his palace! Dreadful looting,59 wholesale burning, and a vengeance of wickedness took place. And the State was annexed. Whitlock now encamped at Mahoba, in order to ‘pacify’ the conquered provinces. As a matter of fact, he had now completed his campaign. He had conquered all the eastern part of Bundelkhand and he had sent small expeditions to ‘pacify’ one or two places. So now, leaving Whitlock, let us again follow the sacred steps of the gallant Queen of Jhansi. The Ranee, now again full of hope, made an advance on Kunchgaon, forty-two miles from Kalpi, with the army of te Peshwa. But the Rao Sahib, if would appear, had not arranged the forces as she would have liked him to. It must be borne in mind, however, that it was not possible to make effective arrangements, either for Rao Sahib or Tatia Tope. Though in that place, the Nabob of Banda, the Raja of Shahgarh, and the Raja of Banapur had all gathered together under the same flat, they had not gathered together as the organised and disciplined parts of a grand military force, moved by oneness of heart, with a unity of plan and constitution, sustained by strict military discipline and subordination. No one could get his ideas carried out. But, in the opposing army, there was no such conflict amongst leaders. It seemed that the whole organisation was perfect and wellcontrolled. Before Sir Hugh Rose was appointed commander, there was heated discussion and difference of opinion; but, once he was the 59 “With regard to this injustice done to Rao, Malleson has to confess : “Not a shot had been fired against him (Whitlock), but he resolved nevertheless to treat the young Rao as though he had actually opposed the British forces. The reason for this perversion of honest dealing lay in the fact that in the palace of Kirwi was stored the wherewithal to compensate soldiers for many a hard fight and many a broiling sun. In its vaults and strong rooms were specie, jewels, and diamonds of priceless value….. The wealth was coveted.” – Kaye and Malleson’s Indian Mutiny, Vol. V, pages 140,141. commander, his opinion was the opinion of all. Whatever orders he issued were right; and, even if they were not right, they must be obeyed. And even mistaken orders of a weak general carried out by the obedient and unanimous bravery of the troops under him, become successful – are bound to become successful. On the other hand, even well-planned orders of a capable general lead to disaster and defeat, through the self-willed behaviour of the troops and the lack of oneness in command and proper subordination. Otherwise the rout at Kunchgaon could never have been place. As soon as Sir Hugh Road came from Jhansi, the Revolutionaries met him at Kunchgaon. Knowing that the mid-day sun was unbearable to the English, the Revolutionaries had ordered in one of their commands, “None should engage in a fight with the Feringhis before ten in the morning. The fight should begin always after ten.” This very clever rule was put into practice this day. Much havoc was thereby created in the English army as happened on many other occasions where the fight took place after ten. But, in spite of this, the Revolutionaries were defeated at Kunchgaon and retired towards Kalpi. The admirable way in which they retired, the organised manner in which they fell back has been praised very much even by the enemy.60 But then this excellent organisation came after and not before the engagement. 60 “Then was witnessed action on the part of the rebels which impelled admiration from their enemies. The manner in which they conducted their retreat could not be surpassed. They remembered the lessons which the European officers had well taught them. There was no hurry, no disorder, no rushing to the rear. All was orderly as on a field-day. Though their line of skirmishers was two miles in length, it never wavered in a single point. The men fired, then ran behind the relieving men, and loaded. The relieving men then fired, and ran back in their turn. They even attempted, when they thought the pursuit was too rash, to take up a position, so as to bring on it an enfilading fire.” - Malleson’s Indian Mutiny, Vol. V, page 124. With this defeat, the Revolutionaries came on to Kalpi. There, they began to make up for the defeat by wrangling against and abusing one another, - the infantry laid the defeat at the door of the cavalry, the cavalry blamed the Jhansi troops, and all together blamed the general, Tatia. But, Tatia Tope is not going to come any more to Kalpi to hear these wranglings. He has gone at present to the village of Charkhi, near Jalwan, to see his father. No one knows definitely where he is going after that, or whether he is going there at all. Let us remember that Gwalior lies in the direction of his road ! May the meeting between this extraordinary son and his fortunate father be full of love! And after that loving visit, may this great messenger of the Revolution go with despatch to carry out whatever designs he might have set his heart on! While Tatia was going on this journey, Ranee Lakshmi went to the royal tent of the Peshwa. The heroic Lakshmi relieved him of his dejection after the defeat of Kunchgaon and said to him that, if the army was properly organised, the enemy should never again be victorious. The Nabob of Banda was inspired by her speech. Proclamations in spirited language were again published in the Revolutionary army. And to-day, on the banks of the Jumna, crowds are gathering. Swords and guns, angry Sepoys invoking the Jumna to bless the cause of the indedpendence of their soil - such a Revolutionary pilgrimage the banks of the Jumna had probably never before seen. These banks are simply echoing forth the triumphant cries for the Mother and for Dharma!” Jai Jumna! With this thy sacred water in our hands, we swear that the Feringhis shall be extinct, that Swadesh shall be independent, and that Swadharma shall be re-established! Jai Jumna! If all this is accomplished, then alone we will live. If not, we will die this day on the field of battle. We swear, by thee, O Kalindi, three times!” Heroes, thrice bound by this oath, come on then to the field. Rao Sahib will lead the whole army. Drive away this 25th infantry under Sir Hugh Rose. They are all Indians - drive these traitors before you! Major Orr advances - make him share the same defeat! In this maidan before Kalpi, our position - with this undulatory part to cover - is almost impregnable. But look, the vanguard is falling back! It went too far, and being not well covered, has had to retreat. Run then, Lakshmi, run to protect them. She rushed forward sword in her hand with lightning-like rapidity, and fell on the right wing of the English, with her red-uniformed cavalry. The triumphant right stopped dead, so sudden was the attack; stopped dead, and then retired back helpless. This rapid onslaught of the girl of twenty-one, her horse at full speed, her sword cutting men down to the right and to the left, - seeing this, who would not fight for her? Who would not be inspired by her? All the Revolutionaries were inspired by her strength; the battle raged bloody and hot. The Feringhi gunners of the light field artillery began to die one after another. The Ranee and her cavalry, then, advanced right on the guns which were spitting deadly fire, and attacked the artillery. English gunners left the guns; the horse artillery was routed; the heroes of the Revolution advanced on and on, from all sides, overjoyed at the prospect of crushing the Feringhis who had so long escaped them; and before them all fought Lakshmi! This praise by the enemy does credit to the Panday party. Sir Hugh Rose, taken aback by this terrible onslaught, then advanced with his reserve camels, and the English saved their own lives, simply because of the camels. An English writter says, “Fifteen minutes more, and the mutineers would have cut us down! Fresh camels, one hundred and fifty in number, changed the fortunes of the day. Ever since that day, I have looked on the camel with eyes of affection.” By the strength of the camelmen alone, on the 22nd of May, the Feringhis succeeded in forcing the Peshwa’s army to retire towards Kalpi. After another complete defeat of the Peshwa’s troops and after a few skirmishes, Sir Hugh entered Kalpi on the 24th May. In the fort of Kalpi, the English captured a very considerable amount of military supplies which Shri Rao Sahib Peshwa and Tatia Tope had, with great trouble, gathered together in one year. Sixty thousand pounds of gunpowder were found buried under the ground; muskets beautifully made, brass balls of the latest type for the guns, factories for making and repairing cannon-balls, heaps of military uniforms, flags, drums, French trumpets, Howitzer guns manufactured in Europe, and arms of various kind - such was the very useful find that the English army came upon! What they did not capture was the brave and ever-memorable leaders of the Revolutionaries. For, when Kalpi fell after a week, Rao Sahib, the Nabob of Banda, Ranee Lakshmi Bai, and other leaders had left Kalpi and gone - nobody knew where. But now these unfortunate, helpless people, without an army and without arms, could do nothing beyond falling into the jaws of death, either by privations, or ny capture, or ny suicide! Thus Sir Colin had begun the reconquest from the northern bank of the Jumna, and went on conquering as far as the Himalayas. Sir Hugh Rose and Whitlock be.gan from the Narbada, and conquered all the country as far as the South bank of the Jumna. The English had now every reason to congratulate themselves that they had destroyed the Revolution completely. Sir Hugh Rose congratulated his army in these eloquent words :- “Soldiers, you have marched one thousand miles, captured one hundred guns, swam rivers, crossed mountains, marched through jungles, defeated big armies, reconquered extensive tracts, and reestablished the glory of your country! Brave you are; and you have also observed the strictest discipline; for courage without discipline is nought. In the midst of difficulties, temptations, and trouble, you have obeyed strictly the orders of your general, and have never showed even a single sign of insubordination. From the waters of the Narbada to the waters of the Jumna, this, your success, has come to you through your splendid discipline!” After publishing this glorifying proclamation, Sir Hugh resigned his charge for the sake of his health. And the triumphant English army, having destroyed the enemy completely, sighed the sigh of relief and wished to rest. But how dare you rest yet? While Tatia and Ranee Lakshmi Bai are alive, there is no rest possible for the British troops. Come, stand up! And if you would not stand of your own accord, here is the whole force of Gwalior, ready to goad you on! After escaping from Kalpi, the Revolutionary leaders went to Gopalpur to discuss their future plans. Practically, at this time, there was not a sign of hope. From the Narbada to the Jumna, and from Jumna to the Himalayas, the English had conquered back the whole territory. The Revolutionaries were without an army, without a fort, without any hope of getting fresh forces - defeated as they were again and again. But Tatia Tope was still alive, and that was enough! Tatia, too, had returned to Gopalpur. People say he had returned after visiting his father. Whatever people say, history does not say so. It was when Sir Hugh tried his deep-laid game at Kalpi that Tatia had a sudden fit of fondness for his father - a fondness, by -the-bye, which seemed to exceed even his fondness for fight; and, no longer able to control his filial feelings, he want to Charkhi to see his father. What was the secret of this sudden passion? The secret was that, as soon as Kalpi fell, it was absolutely necessary to get hold of some other strong position, some strong fortress, and some new army. And, therefore, this Messenger of the Revolution had escaped from Kalpi secretly to enter Gwalior, and see how the Revolutionary idea was progressing there! He accepted the promises of the chief officers of the army and created a new army for the Revolution, by secretly winning over the Durbar functionaries, Sirdars, and others. They promised to give him all the aid they could, and in one month he had the whole of Gwalior in the hollow of his hand. He then collected every information about the military position of Gwalior and, thus, after undermining the throne of the Scindia, Tatia returned to Rao Sahib at Gopalpur. He had ‘seen his father’! Learning the glad news, that Tatia had come back from Gwalior having successfully won over the people to the sided of the Revolution, Ranee Lakshmi urged the Peshwa to advance straight towards Gwalior. On the 28th of May, the Revolutionaries came to Amin Mahal. The Mahalkars tried to stop them. They were answered, “Who are you to obstruct us? We are the Peshwa and his forces and we are fighting for Swaraj and Swadharma.” These words of Rao Sahib silenced the cowards, and thousands of patriots in that part welcomes the Revolutionaries heartily, and thus the army of the Peshwa pressed right on the walls of the city of Gwalior. They had written to the Scindia, “We are coming to you in a friendly spirit. Remember our former relations. We expect help from you, so that we shall be enabled to proceed towards the south.” But this ungrateful man had forgotten the former relations. Well then, remember the former and the present relations too! “The ancestors of the Scindia were our servants, our Hujres - that was the former relation. And, the present relation? The whole army of the present Scindia has joined us. Tatia had gone to Gwalior, seen the leaders, and gained all necessary information!” But still, forgetting all this the Scindia, with all his army and all his guns, advanced on the Peshwa on the 1st of June, near Gwalior. The Shrimant who deserves the respect of the whole country thought for a moment that the Scindia had repented and was coming forward to salute the flag of Swadesh. But, Lakshmi said that he was coming, not to salute, but to smash that golden flag. She came forward with her three hundred horsemen and advanced right on the guns of the Scindia. Soon, she caught the view of Jayaji Rao Scindia and his personal guard the brave “Bhaleghate” troops. The cobra shows not such rage when it is trodden upon as Lakshmi showed at the sight of this traitor! Like an arrow she dashed at his troops. Behold, you Bahadur - descendant of Mahadaji, this helpless girl of twenty-two, brought up in the Zenana, is inving you for a trial of strength of the sword! Let us all see now how much of the prowess of Mahadaji, the devoted lover of his country, has descended upon this Jayaji the devoted slave of the Feringhi! As soon as this angry lightning struck him hard on the front, his personal guards wavered and the Scindia, with all his “Bhaleghate” troops,was routed. But, at least, there was hope that his huge army and terrible artillery would do their best - and they did do their best! As soon as they saw Tatia, these troops which had been bound over by secret oaths to Tatia refused, point-blank, to fight against the Peshwa. As previously arranged, they joined the Peshwa with all their officers; the guns were silent and everyone in Gwalior honoured the flag of the Peshwa. The throne of the Scindia thus crumbled to pieces at the touch of the Revolutionary magician. And so, Jayaji Rao Scindia, coward as he was, and his minister, Dinkar Rao, fled, not only from the field, but from Gwalior itself, and ran to Agra! Gwalior, was now mad with joy. The army fired salutes in honour of the Shrimant. The Finance Minister, Amar Chand Bhatia, surrendered the whole treasury of the Scindia, to the last pie, to Shrimant. Those few patriots who were in prison under the old regime for having shown sympathy with the Revolutionaries were released from their prisons amidstthe joyous cries of the populace. The traitors who had advised the Scindia to join the English had fled, but their mansions and their property were destroyed so that not a vestige of them remained. The black charge that the Asiatics do not understand the true relation between a ruler and his subjects, was washed away completely by Gwalior. For, how can he who goes against his own country and against his own Dharma be a ruler? Poona had been in 1818 guilty of being a traitor to the motherland is not having dragged Rao Baji from his Peshwai in right time. Gwalior was not guilty of that! And therefore, this Revolution of 1857 must be recorded in history as the first indication in modern India of the omnipotence of the vox populi, the power of the people. If Scindia joins not his country, the country shall not aid him either. Swords and guns, infantry and cavalry, Durbar and Sirdars, Mankarees and citizens, temples and images - all are for the country, alone; and if the Scindia is not for the country, drag him down from his throne; and outside the palace, outside the capital, outside the borders of the kingdom let him be driven out! Hereafter, according to the Scriptures, “The King receives his power only by pleasing the people!” And now, we must not let this auspicious day, the 3rd of June, slip by uselessly. And so “a big Durbar was held in Phul Bagh. All Sirdars, statesmen noblemen, Shiledars, and cavalry officers, who had joined the Shrimant, took their seats according to their rank. Tatia Tope and the Arabs, Rohillas, Pathans, Rajputs, Rangdes, Pardeshis, and others under him came to the Durbar in their military uniform and with swords by their side. The Shrimant himself was dressed in the Peshwa’s uniform Shirpana and Kalgitura on head, pearls in his ears, and pearl and diamond necklaces, round his neck. Thus, with all the paraphernalia of the Peshwai, Bhaldars and Chobdars making way for him, and Mourchas flying, the Shrimant came to the Durbar. Then, as usual, all stood up in reverence, salutes were received, and the Shrimant ascended the throne. With tears of joy in his eyes, he congratulated all the noblemen with great eloquence. Ram Rao Govind was appointed Chief Minister. Tatia Tope was made general and a sword studded with precious stones was presented to him. The eight ministers were elected. Twenty lakhs of Rupees were distributed to the army. The Durbar was a complete success. Joy was on every face and salutes of guns were fired.“61 Shrimant Rao Sahib, representative of Nana Sahib Peshwa, had thus established a new throne, infusing a new hope and a new life into the Revolutionary party, and had created a centre, a basis, round which might be attracted the scattered forces of the Revolution. Tatia Tope was not mad in busying himself with this coronation and giving salutes after salutes just 61 D.B.Parasnis’s Life of Lakshmi Bai, page 309. in a midst of the war. The whole world had seen the dead body of the Revolution which by this means alone he now lifted from the grave of despair. The world – some with pleasure and others with despair – had cried : “That is a dead body, there is no life in it!” But what wonderful magic this! Tatia took the dead earth at Gopalpur, he breathed on it thus, and – wonderful! – the whole world saw with the dumbness of surprise, a throne rising from the thimbleful of earth, jingling with lakhs of Rupees! Wonder of wonders! See the thousands of swordsmen advancing; hear the salutes thundering forth from the guns! A new army is up, new guns are up, Tatia has captured a new kingdom! Tatia has done all this not meely to strike the world dumb with his splendid triumph. He knew that the Revolutionaries who had spread far and wide would, on hearing the salutes proclaiming the Shrimant as a Peshwa of the Mahratta empire, get a concentrated inspiration, vigour, and hope. He knew that the sight of the triumphant flag of the nation, thus unfurled at Gwalior, would infuse an uncontrollable enthusiasm and dash. He knew that the lawlessness which had set in owing to the want of a rallying point, would now make way for discipline, through respect for the new-established throne. All this Tatia saw. And what he foresaw soon came to pass. For the body of the Panday party was soon instinct with life. While thus, on the one hand, his countrymen were encouraged, the English army, which just gave a sigh of relief, was, on the other hand, again disheartened. It was for this that the coronation was proclaimed loudly by Tatia and other leaders of the Revolution. Their deep- laid game was successful. For, by this very thunder of Tatia’s cannon, Sir Hugh Rose’s idea of rest was rudely shattered to pieces!62 62 Malleson, writing about the cleverness and diplomacy which Tatia and Lakshmi Bai showed in taking Gwalior, says :- “How the “Impossible” happened has been told …. He (Sir Hugh Rose) realised, moreover, the great danger which would inevitably be caused by delay. No one could foresee the extent of evil possible if Gwalior were not promptly wrested from rebel hands. Grant them delay, and Tatia Tope, with the immense acquisition of political and military strength secured by the possession of Gwalior, and with all its resources in men, So far so good; but once having shocked Sir Hugh Rose and disheartened him, woe betide him who listened not to the words of Ranee Lakshmi Bai! All other functions but the one great function of war must be stopped. But it seemed that, as ill-luck would have it, the intoxication of the Revolutionaries would make them blind to the necessity of heeping the army in complete readiness. They were all immersed in luxury, good dinners, and fatal dilatoriness – they thought, perhaps, that this was the sole end of Swaraj! They were onlo losing Swaraj. For, the surprised Sir Hugh Rose marched rapidly on Gwalior with his excellent army under him. He brought with him the renegade Scindia and proclaimed to all that the English were going to fight only for the Scindia’s sake! It was a trick to deceive the simple men of Gwalior, who had the slavish and discreditable merit of blind loyalty, and it was calculated to prevent these from fighting against the Scindia. But the old world had changed, giving place to the new. Tatia, so far successful in awakening the Revolutionaries, rushed forward to meet the English. The English had already defeated the Morar contingents. Now, with the shadow of defeat on them, there began some excited movements among the Revolutionary leaders. Rao Sahib was hastening towards the house of the Nabob of Banda and the Nabob of Banda was rushing towards the house of Rao Sahib. But, in the midst of all this confusion, the Ranee alone was calm and was ready. Her sword was out. What need she fear now? Hope as well as despair she had trampled under money and material at his disposal, would be able to form a new army on the fragments of that beaten at Kalpi, and to provoke a Mahratta rising throughout India. It might be possible for him, using the dexterity of which he was a master, to unfurl the Peshwa’s banner in the southern Mahratta districts. Those districts were denudedof troops, and a striking success in Central India would probably decide their inhabitants to pronounce in favour of the cause for which their fathers had fought and bled.” - Malleson’s Indian Mutiny, Vol. V, pages 149-150. foot; she treated with contempt the things on this earth; she had one aspiration alone, namely, that the flag of liberty should stand proudly erect until she gave up her last breath! Neither of them were to be in the dust; they were to lie in battle alone. So, she gave Rao Sahib a word of courage, rearranged the undisciplined troops as far as she could, and took upon herself the task of guarding the eastern gate. She only demanded, “I am ready with all my soul to do my duty; mind, you do yours!” She donned her usual military uniform, rode a noble steed, took out her gem-bestudded sword from the sheath, and ordered the army under her to march on. She made ready all the posts near Kotaki Serai which had been given to her care and, when the English army was in sight, everywhere, trumpets and pipes, drums and nagaras rent the air. If only she had an army, equal in courage and daring to herself! Even the insubordinate and hesitating felt heroic under her influence and, with them and her select band of horsemen, she charged hard the English army! Her two female friends, Mandar and Kashi, also fought bravely by her side. May the sweet memory of those two patriotic girls - beautiful in appearance, with male attire put on, taking pleasure in fight - live in history along with that of their mistress as long as history lives! A general like Smith was charging the Ranee’s army, but to-day the Ranee’s bravery and daring were a sight to see. Like lightning, she moved about all day. The English attacked the solid phalanx a number of times. One very occasion she maintained her hold firm. Her army occasionally felt enthusiastic and attacked the British and cut down many of them. At last, Smith was forced to retire; he gave up the attempt of breaking the mass and began to turn to another side, leaving the nest of the cobra alone! Thus closed the day and thus rose the 18th of the month! This day, the English had resolved to make desperate charges. From all directions, they advanced on the fort, and tried their utmost. General Smith, forced to retire the day before, was very determined to-day and, aided by re- inforcements, he charged the same Jhansi side he had gone for the day before. Sir Hugh Rose thought that his presence was also absolutely necessary and so he was personally present with the force attacking the Jhansi side. The Ranee too was ready for him with all her forces. “She was ready with all her soul to do her duty.” That day, she wore a Chanderi turban embroidered all over, a tamamee cloak, and pyjamas. A pearl necklace was round her neck. Her famous steed being tired that day, a new, fresh-looking horse was made ready for her, fully caparisoned. While her two beautiful maids were taking sherbet, news came that the English were advancing. Lakshmi immediately darted forwarded from her tent. The arrow flies not so rapidly, the lightning flashes not forth with such force from the clouds, a lioness leaves not her lair so quickly to fall upon the approaching elephant! She rode her horse, lifted her sword, and charged the enemy with her army. As English writer says, “Immediately the beautiful Ranee went over the field and made a firm stand against the array of Sir Hugh Rose. She led her troops to repeated and fierce attacks and, though her ranks were pierced through and were gradually becoming thinner and thinner, the Ranee was seen in the foremost rank, rallying her shattered troops and performing prodigies of valour. But all was of no avail. The camel corps, pushed up by Shri Huge Rose in person, broke her last line. Still the dauntless and heroic Ranee held her own.” But while her side was fighting with such unexampled bravery, she saw the English army advancing on her rear - for they had broken through the ranks of Revolutionaries who were holding the posts behind her! The artillery dumb, the main army routed, the victorious English army closing on her from all sides, with only fifteen or twenty horsemen with her, Ranee Lakshmi, accompanied by her maids, put her horse to a gallop, in order to break through the enemy, and to join her comrades on the other side. The Feringhi horsemen of the Hussars, who knew not so far where she was, fired shot after shot on her and pursued her like hounds. But the Queen, with unexampled courage, cleared her way with her sword and marched on. Suddenly was heard a cry, “I am dead, Bai Sahib, I am dead!” Alas, whose is this cry? Lakshmi turned round and found that it was her maid Mandar whom a white soldier had shot and killed! Angered, she attacked the Feringhi, and her blow felled him on the spot. She had avenged the death of fair Mandar! She then marched on. She came to a small rill. Now, one jump and Jhansi would have been out of the Feringhi’s clutches. But her horse would not take that jump! If only she had had her old horse! As if the fiery line of a magician was round him the horse moved in circles, round and round, but would not cross. Before you could say “one”, the English horsemen closed on her! Still not a word of surrender or fear! One sword against their several swords, - yet she closed on them. She crossed sword with sword with them all, but one of them hit her on the head from behind. With that blow, the right part of her head, and even her right eye came out - just then, another blow hit her on the chest. Oh Lakshmi, Lakshmi! The last drop of thy sacred blood is dripping and, therefore, now, Mother, take this last sacrifice for thee! Even at the point of death, she killed the British foe who had attacked her, and now the young Queen was breathing her last breath! A faithful servant, Ramchandra Rao Deshmukh, was near. He took her to a cottage near by. Ganga Das Bawa gave her cold water to drink to quench her thirst and a bed to lie down upon. Bathed in blood, this goddess of war reclined on the bed, and then her soul quietly fleeteed from her body to heaven! As soon as she was dead, Ramchandra Rao, in accordance with her dying instructions prepared a pile of grass unseen by the enemy; he put her on that pure and, before the touch of slavery could defile even her dead body, she was cremated. On the pyre, if not on the throne! But Lakshmi is still with her sweetheart Liberty! She has forced open the gates of death by falling in battle and has now entered the other world. Pursuit can no longer harm her. Wicked Pursuit must pass through those roaring flames before it can do so. Thus fought Lakshmi. She had achieved her purpose, fulfilled her ambition, carried out her resolve! One such life vindicates the whole existence of a nation! She was the concentrated essence of all virtues. A mere woman, hardly twenty-three yet, beautiful as rose, charming in her manners, pure of conduct, she had a power of organisation of her subjects, exhibited by very few, even among men. The flame of patriotism was always burning in her heart. And she proud of her country’s honour and pre- eminent in war! It is very rarely that a nation is so fortunate as to be able to claim such an angelic person, as a daughter and a queen. That honour has not yet fallen to the lot of England. In the Revolution of Italy, high ideals and heroism of the very highest type are to be found; yet, in all this period of glody, Italy could not give birth to Lakshmi! But, even our land could hardly have given birth to such a Queen but for this glorious War of Independence! The precious pearls in the ocean are not to be found on its surface. The Suryakanta jewel does not give out flames in the quiet of the night; nor does the flint give up its spark on soft cushions. They want resistance. Injustice must make the mind restless; really, not apparently, every drop of blood most actually boil; intense national feeling is thus set aflane in such a furnace, the particles of virtue begin to flow, the test goes on, the dross is eliminated, then, the concentrated essence of virtues begins to appear. In 1857, the heart of this our Motherland took fire; then, a terrible explosion which would deafen the world took place; - A spark at Meerut, and the whole country, which, under the roller of Dalhousie, had been reduced to the monotony of a dead level and seemed to be a heap of dust, proved to be a powder-magazine filled with the most inflammable material. Just as when a mighty rocket in a fireplay, fired in the air, explodes, arrows and trees and various other picturesque objects rise and rush and burn and die away, such was the case of this gigantic Revolutionary Rocket! Its length is from Meerut to the Vindhyas; its width from Peshawar to Dumdum;- and it was fired! Fire and flames raged in all directions. Blood coming down like rain, - sieges of Delhi, revenges of Plassey, massacres of Cawnpore, and the Sikandar Bagh of Lucknow! Thousands of heroes are fighting - and dying; cities are burning. Kumar Singh comes, struggles, falls; the Moulvie comes, struggles, and falls; the throne of Cawnpore, the throne of Lucknow, the throne of Delhi, the throne of Bareilly, the throne of Jagadishpur, the throne of Jhansi, the throne of Banda, the throne of Furrukabad, five thousand, ten thousand, fifty thousand, a lakh of swords, flags, banners, generals, horses, elephants - all are coming out out after another, move about in the turmoil of the raging fire! Some are ascending one flame, some another; they poise themselves a while, reel, fight, fall down unseen! Everywhere battle and thunder-storms! A veritable volcanic conflagration this! And the pyre, flaming near the cottage of Gangadas Bawa, is the last and the most lustrous flame of this raging volcanic conflagration of the War of Independence of 1857! END OF THE THIRD PART">

  <p>GIVE up my Jhansi? I will not. Let him try to take who dares!&quot; With this challenge the heroic Ranee of Jhansi rose against the British and as it is recorded in previous parts of this History she assumed the leadership of the Revolution, drove the English and began to rule at Jhansi as the Queen of the province. The forces of the Revolution had wreaked a bloody vengeance on the English people and army and left not a trace of their rule at Sagar. Naogaon, Banda, Banapur, Shahgarh and Karki. The people everywhere hailed the Queen as their own. She then busied herself - in restoring order and peace in her liberated province.
The Ranee&rsquo;s daily life at this period has been described as follows :- &ldquo;The Bai got up at five in the morning and took a bath with fragrant attar. After dressing - and she generally wore a Chanderi Saree of faultless white - she would sit for her daily prayers. First, she dropped the necessary water as a prayaschitta for keeping hair on her head after her husband&rsquo;s death; then, she used to worship the Tulsi in the Tulsi grove. Then began the Parthiva Puja at which the Durbar musicians would sing in choir. Puraniks would then start reading the Puran. Then, Sirdars and dependants came and she returned their usual salutes. Being very keen of memory, even if a single man among the seven hundred and fifty who paid their respects to her in the morning was not present, the very next day, the Bai would not fail to inquire why he did not come the previous day. After the worship of God began the dinner. After dinner, she would take an hour&rsquo;s siesta unless there was urgent work to do. Then she would order the presents of the morning to be brought before her, which was done on silver trays covered over with silk cloths. Those things that she liked, she accepted; the others were given over to the Kothiwalla (minister of the presents department) for distribution
amongst her servants. At three she went to the Durbar, when she usually put on male attire. She wore a pyjama, a coat of dark blue, a cap on the heat, and a beautiful turban on the top of it, a dupeta of embroidered cloth round the slender waist, and the sword decked with gems by her side. Attired in this wise, this fair woman looked like Gauri herself. Sometimes, she wore the female dress. After her husband&rsquo;s death, she never wore nath or similar ornaments. Her hands had round them bangles of diamond; she wore a small necklace of pearls round her neck and a diamond ring on her little finger. These were the only jewels worn by the Bai Sahib. Her hair was gathered up together behind. She wore a white saree and a plain white bodice. Thus, sometimes in male attire and sometimes in female, the Bai Sahib used to honour the Durbar by her presence. Those assembled in Durbar never used to see her person. For the room in which she sat was separate from, and only opened into, the Durbar hall. Gold carving adorned the doors, and over these fell gracefully the chintz curtain, embroidered with gold cloths. In this room sat the Bai Sahib on a gadi of soft down, leaning on a soft pillow. Outside the door, two pages with maces of silver and sold always attended. Opposite the room, Lakshman Rao Dewanji stood with a bundle of important documents in his hand, and beyond him sat the Registrars of the Durbar. Being very keen and intelligent, the Bai quickly grasped every matter brought before her, and her orders were clear and definite and to the point. Sometimes she wrote her orders out herself. She was very careful in affairs of justice, and decided civil and criminal cases alike with great ability. Ranee Sahib worshipped Mahalakshmi devoutly. The temple of that Goddess was situated on the banks of a lake filled with lotus flowers, and every Friday and Tuesday the Bai visited the temple. One day, it so happened that after the
Bai had returned from the temple and was passing through the south gate, she was thousands of beggars blocking the passage and creating a disturbance. So, she inquired of the Minister, Lakshman Rao Pande, the reason of this. He inquired and informed her that the people were very poor,
and that they suffered immensely on account of excessive cold, and that, therefore, they requested that the Bai would kindly consider their condition. The Bai left very grieved for these poor people, and she at once issued orders - kind-hearted that she was - that, on the fourth day from thence, a gathering of beggars should take place, where every one should be provided with a thick coat and a cap and a blanket either white or black. The very next day, all the tailors of the town were given orders to make caps and coats. On the day appointed it was proclaimed that all the beggars were to gather in front of the palace. Poor people, too, had been included in his gathering. All were given clothes by the Bai and they went away satisfied In the fight with Nathe Khan when the wounded men were brought into the city, the Bai herself would insist on being present when their wounds were being dressed. Her very presence soothed their pain, and they felt themselves sufficiently rewarded by the kind and sympathetic interest she took in their well-being. The Ranee grieved at their grief, gave them ornaments and medals, patted them, and showed such sympathy that others, instead of being disheartened at the sight of these wounded soldiers, felt that they could even give up their lives for the sake of the Ranee. The grandeur of the Bai&rsquo;s processions passes description. On the occassions of the visits to the temple of Mahalakshmi, she started sometimes in a palanquin, and sometimes on horseback. When in the palanquin, the palanquin would be covered with curtains of gold and embroidered cloths tied with golden ribbon. When she was on horseback, in male attire, the end of a thin and beautiful batti floated on her back and it fitted her admirably. The national flag of freedom was carried before her, with the band playing military music. Two hundred Europeans followed the flag and a hundred horsemen rode before and behind her. With the palanquin came the karbharis, ministers, feudatories, and other officers like Bhayya Sahib Upasane; and others either rode or followed on foot. Sometimes troops accompanied the procession. When the Bai started from the palace, the choughada on the fort
made sweet music. The choughada of the nagarkhana of Mahalakshmi started at the same time.&ldquo;54
And thus, from the Vindhyas to the Jumna, there was not a vestige of British authority left, Brahmins, Moulvies, Sirdars, Dorkdars, Sepoys, the police, Rajas, Raos, bankers, villagers - all were desirous fighting for only one thing, and that was Independence! And to unite together these thousand voices in one harmonious whole, the Lakshmi of Jhansi declared with her sweet but firm voice &ldquo;None can have my Jhansi; he who dares may try!&rdquo;
Very rarely had the world heard such a firm &ldquo;No!&rdquo; Generous and liberal to a fault India has always been pronouncing and swearing by &ldquo;I shall give!&rdquo;, &ldquo;I shall give!&rdquo;, so far. But here was a strange phenomenon to-day - a set face and a stern voice which said, &ldquo;I will not give! I will not give up my Jhansi!&rdquo; Would to heaven, O Mother, that every one of thy sons and daughters had said the same! The Feringhi was taken aback at this unexpected assertion; and Sir Hugh Rose was sent, with five thousand armed men and a considerable number of guns, to gauge the extent of the disturbance and to quell it.
In the beginning of 1858, the English had drawn up a complete military plan for the reconquest of all the territory, from the Himalayas to the Vindhyas, which was under the Revolutionaries. The whole territory was divided into two portions, and to each of them a huge army was sent to subdue it. We have in an earlier chapter described how commander-in- chief Sir Colin Campbell marched upwards from Allahabad to the north of the Ganges and the Jumna and, with his big army, conquered the Doab, and crossed the Ganges and marches on Lucknow; how, after destroying Lucknow, he extinguished the flames of insurrection ranging in Behar, in Benares and round if, and in Oudh; how he forced all the Revolutionaries
54 D.B.Parasnis&rsquo;s Life of Lakshmi Bai, paged 147-151. into Rohilkhand, where the final engagement took place, and how, thus, the northern portion of the territory which was in the hands of the Revolutionaries was reconquered by the English. While Sir Colin was advancing from the north of the Jumna towards the Himalayas, Sir Hugh Rose advanced to conquer the southern portion lying between the Jumna and the Vindhyas. In the north, the Sikhs, the Gurkhas, and other Indian troops and feudatories had joined Sir Colin; so also in the south, Sir Hugh Rose had on his side the help of the princes of Hyderabad, Bhopal, and other states. He had, in addition, got the valuable assistance of the troops of Madras and Bombay and the Hyderabad contingent. To mention specially that the Indian troops had joined Sir Hugh Rose is unnecessary. For, to mention that Sir Hugh Rose was successful would imply the first proposition. For the English to obtain a victory, of themselves, is as impossible as the most impossible thing in the world. The traitorous Indian troops thus collected together for conquering the southern parts were divided into two divisions. One was under the command of Brigadier Whitlock who was to start from Jubbulpore and, subduing the provinces on the way, was eventually to join Sir Hugh Rose. The other was under Sir Huge Rose himself. As soon as Whitlock started from Jubbulpore, Sir Hugh was also to start from Mhow; he was to advance through Jhansi on Kalpi. According to the plan of campaign, Sir Huge started from Mhow on the 6th of January 1858 and, after a fight, he captured the fort of Rajgarh. From thence, he advanced to Sagar, released the prisoners kept there by the Revolutionaries, advanced further south, reducing various positions of the enemy on the way, captured Banapur on the 10th of March, and reconquered the famous fort of Chanderi. On the 20th of March, the triumphant English army encamped about fourteen miles from Jhansi. By these many struggles, bands of Revolutionaries distributed all over the country from the banks of the Narbada upwards, now crowded into Jhansi; and that is why Sir Hugh advanced with great dispatch on Jhansi to reduce this stronghold of the Revolutionaries. But Lord Canning and Sir Colin both issued orders to Sir Hugh first to relieve the Raja of Charkhari who was being besieged by
Tatia. This order, if he obeyed it, would have spoiled Sir Hugh&rsquo;s plan of reducing Jhansi. What was he to do? He could neither disobey nor find his way to obey the orders. As, in these trying circumstances, the best interests of the British government lay in advancing on Jhansi, Sir Robert Hamilton took upon himself the whole responsibility of disobeying the orders of the two highest authorities in Hindusthan; and the British army, emboldened by a high national feeling, advanced towards Jhansi, hopeful of victory. But the English army suffered enormously as soon as they set foot on the soil of Jhansi. For they found, to their great surprise, that all the tract of land surrounding Jhansi had been laid waste by order of the Queen in orderthat the enemy should have no supplies of any sort. Not a blade of corn in the fields, not a vestige of grass on the meadows, not a tree which could afford shelter; So had William of Orange, when there appeared to be a possibility of the Netherlands falling into the hands of the Spanish tyrant and invader, ordered that the dykes be opened and the sea let in, rather than that the country should fall in the hands of the enemy. And this day Jhansi had adopted a similar course.
The same terrible thunder is in her voice; her eyes are spouting forth the red flames of anger! Mardan Singh, Raja of Banapur, the enraged chief of Shahagarh, the brave Thakurs, with their lives in their hands, Sirdars of Bundelkhand, resolute as ever, with their many followers - all these hot incendiary elements in the interior of Jhansi are burning and flame-red. The flames leap up even as the Jaripatka; and look, the central figure of the whole fight is there, shining above all! Aye, she is the central idea, the flashing impersonation of Swaraj! She is the inspiration, she is the incarnation of Liberty!
In spite of the barrenness of the country around, the English approached Jhansi. For, thanks to the loyalty of the Scindia and the Raja of Tehri, the force was throughout the operations abundantly supplied with
grass, firewood, and vegetables.55 As the Scindia and the Raja of Tehri are helping the Feringhis, surrounded as you are by treachery and disloyalty, betrayed by relations as by strangers, you have not the slightest hope of success. Why not then avoid extinction by surrendering to the English? But, surrender? And for the Ranee of Jhansi? Dewan Lakshman Rao, Moro Punt Tambe, brave Thakurs and Sirdars, all heroes of Liberty, if you surrender, you will be saved; if you fight, you will die. Which will you choose?
Jhansi answered from her thousand mouths, sternly, in the words of the Scripture, &ldquo;As everyone who is born must die, why sully fair fame uselessly?&rdquo;
So, it was determined to give battle to the English for the honour of the country. And Jhansi was busy by night and by day preparing for the fight. Brave men, there were many in her army; but trained men, there were very few. Want of discipline was very apparent. The queen herself, however, let the whole army. On every rampart and every gate, she was moving about actively; she was standing where guns were being planted and moved into position; she was budy selecting clever gunners; and she was to be found everywhere inspiring heroism even in the coldest hearts. The learned Brahmins of Jhansi were praying for the success of the country. Its temples blessed the soldier who went to the field, and tended the wounded who returned from battle; its workmen were busy preparing ammunition and other necessary for war. The men of Jhansi manned their guns, loaded the muskets; its women carried ammunition, built Top Khanas, supplied provisions.56 When the night of the 23rd fell, sounds of battle- drums were heard throughout the town and lighted torches shone forth at frequent intervals from the fort. The guards fired a few shots too. The
55 Malleson&rsquo;s Indian Mutiny, Vol. V, page 110.
56 “The women were seen working in the batteries and carrying ammunition, etc.”- Sir Hugh Rose.
morning of the 24th approached. No more delay now! The Ghanagarj (thunder-clap) gun began its work. The noise made by that gun was terrific.
We shall quote an eye witness’s account of the early stages of the siege.
&ldquo;From the 25th, the engagement began in right earnest. The enemy poured in a heavy fire all day and night. In the night came cannon- balls on the forst and the city. The sight was terrible to see. A cannon-ball of fifty or sixty pounds weight would look as small as a tennis ball but red like live charcoal. During the day one would not see these balls clearly for daylight, but in the night, they were clearly visible and gave a weird appearance to the night. On the 26th, at midday, the English silenced the guns on the southern gate, and not a man could make a stand there. All men in the field were nearly disheartened at this. Then, the gunner on the western gate moved the gun round and fired at the enemy; the third shot killed the best gunner in the English army, and the English gun was silenced, in its turn. At this, the Bai Sahib was very pleased and presented the gunner with a silver anklet. The name of the brave gunner was Gulam Ghose Khan. He had displayed similar skill in the engagement with Nathe Khan also.
&ldquo;On the fifty or the sixth day, the same sort of engagement took place. For four or five hours, the Bai&rsquo;s guns were working wonders and the English lost heavily. Many of their guns, too, were silenced for some time. Then again, the English guns would be more vigorous, and the Jhansi troops would be disheartened and their guns silenced. On the seventh day, at sunset,
the gun to the left was disabled. None could stand there. The battlement was destroyed owing to the enemy’s fire. But in the night, eleven masons were brought under cover of blankets to the walls of the fort, and the work was completed before the day dawned. Thus, the battlement was repaired, and the English, to their great surprise, found the Jhansi gun in working order.
At this time, the English were careless. They suffered considerably and their guns were disabled for quite a long time.
“On the morning of the eighth day, the English army went for Shankar Killa. The English had very expensive and modern telescopes and, with their aid, they began to pour a heavy fire on the reservoir of water within the fort. Of the six or seven who approached near for taking water, four were killed: the others ran leaving their vessels there. As they could not get water for nearly four hours, even baths and other ordinary functions could not be carried on. Now, the gunners on the western and southern gates stopped the guns of the English attacking the Shankar Killa, by a continued fire on them. Then it became possible to get water from the reservoir for bath and dinner. There was a powder factory in the tamarind grove. As soon as two maunds of powder was prepared, it was taken to the sellers to be stocked. A cannon- ball fell on the factory, and thirty men and eight women were killed. On the same day, there was a great turmoil. There was a terrible fight. The fighters were shouting loudly. There was a terrific noise from muskets, and guns firing heavily. Trumpets and bugles were sounding everywhere. Dust and smoke filled the air. Many gunners on the ramparts and a number of Sepoys were killed. Others were appointed in their place. The Bai Sahib was working very hard. She looked to everything, issued the necessary orders, and repaired every point of weakness. By this, the men in the army were very much encouraged and fought continually. On account of this determined resistance, the English, in spite of all their powder and ammunition, could not enter the fort till the 31st of March.&ldquo;57
But pressed as she is by this constant succession of disasters, why is Queen Lakshmi looking so earnestly in that particular direction? And see, she is smiling too! Be ready now and fire your salutes; let triumphal drums beat loudly; let war-cries rend the air! For there is Tatia Tope advancing with his army to aid Jhansi!
57 D.B.Parasnis&rsquo;s Life of Lakshmi Bai, pages 187-193.
with his twenty-two thousand troops. While playing as children, people hardly noticed them; to-day, the whole world is looking on their game!
Tatia Tope has come with his army to dishearten the English army and to give courage to Jhansi. After the defeat of Wyndham at Cawnpore and Sir Colin’s victory, Tatia crossed the Ganges and joined Shrimant Nana. Then, leaving Nana, he crossed the Jumna near Kalpi. As the Raja of Charkhari refused to help in the war for the country started by the Peshwa, Tatia, as representative of the Peshwa, attacked his capital, punished the traitor well, captured twenty-four of his guns, and took from him a contribution of three lacs of Rupees. And then Tatia turned towards Kalpi. There, he received a letter from Ranee Lakshmi Bai requesting him to come to Jhansi and relieve the siege. He sent the note to the Rao Sahib Peshwa, the chief in authority; and, as soon as he got the orders, he charged the rear of the English army. It is on seeing him that a smile of hope has come to the lips of Lakshmi. These two had played together as children in the palace at Brahmavarta, without anyone noticing them particularly. To- day they are playing on the battle-field; the one, on the fortifications of Jhansi, is standing amidst rings of flaming fire, the other is approaching close to the Betwa, with his twenty-two thousand troops. While playing as children, people hardly noticed them; to-day, the whole world is looking on their game!
Tatia had under him, now, the largest number of troops he ever had, and hence the English were not a little disconcerted. They would have been completely so in the battle too, handful as they were. For, in front of them was the Ranee Lakshmi Bai; behind them was this Mahratta tiger, with his twenty-two thousand claws. Why should he not, then, tear Sir Hugh to pieces and eat him up? He advanced to do this, but his twenty-two thousand claws seemed all of a sudden disabled, they could hardly be lifted. And what could even a tiger do without his claws? Alas! A most shameful poltroonish cowardice was exhibited by the Revolutionary troops on the river Betwa.
The army of Jhansi was to attack the rear, and Tatia was to attack the front; the plan was admirable. But the English, with the dash of despair, advanced on Tatia and opened fire on Jhansi. This nullified the two attacks of the aggressive party. One determined attack, like that of the Mawalas of Shivaji or the select band of Kumar, and vultures had fed upon the Union Jack and its followers. But, the English charged straight on the enemy. The cowards did not even offer fight, and - was it treachery or terror - not a cannon-shot from Jhansi was heard. So, the army and its commander were routed and ran away. Plentiful military supplies were captured by the English, Tatia&rsquo;s guns fell into their hands, and one thousand and five hundred of the Revolutionaries were killed in the pursuit. Fifteen hundred people killed in the flight! Mad men and fools! Instead of dying the death of cowards while fleeing, if you had only attacked Sir Huge Rose, you would have died the death of the Ghazis of Bareillyk, you would have destroyed the whole army with Sir Hugh Rose, and your name would have lived for ever! Yet God forgive you! If not our respect, you deserve at least our sympathy. For, howsoever you died, you died for the liberty of your country! May my country learn from your death at least the lesson that soldiers who fly to live, die, and that those who fight to die, live!
And for death was Ranee Lakshmi Bai fighting! Why, then, this hopelessness on the part of Sirdars, Thakurs, and Sepoys? For nine days and nine nights, you stood the deadly charge of gun-fire in the hope that Tatia Tope would soon come to your aid. When he came, you shouted for delight; by the defeat of Tatia on the 1st of April, not only that joy but the very hope of victory is dashed to pieces; and those supplies, to deprive the enemy of which thousands of lives had been sacrificed, have fallen with ease into the enemy&rsquo;s hands. Tatia&rsquo;s ammunition and guns also have fallen into their hands. All this is certainly true. But, why this despair? The enemy may render it impossible for you to live victorious, but he cannot deprive you of a death of glory. There is nothing to despair for, then! And stop, hear the steady, firm, courageous voice of Ranee Lakshmi.
&ldquo;It was not relying on the Peshwa that Jhansi fought so long nor does she require his help to continue her fight in the future. So far, your bravery have been exhibited by you most admirably. I urge to do the same now and to fight with courage and desperation.&rdquo;
Aye, fight with desperation, be ready, let the battle-drums beat, and the trumpets sound! Let was-cries rend the air and let big guns thunder forth! The 3rd of April has dawned and the last assault of the English on Jhansi has begun. They are coming from all sides and pressing hard. Start, then, in right, good, deadly earnest! See how the goddess of war has taken the sword and see how she is making her way through the troops. She is moving about with lightning rapidity, presenting some with golden bracelets, some with dresses; some she is touching with her sacred touch to pat, to some she is offering her sweet smile; others she is encouraging with her heroic words. So now! Gulam Ghose Khan and Kuar Khuda Bhaksh, let the fire be most deadly! The enemy is storming the main gate and the fortifications, ladders have been planted at eight different places. &ldquo;Har, Har, Mahadev!&rdquo; From the fort, from ramparts, and from houses came a perfect shower of bullets, a constant succession of shots. The deep-mouthed cannon are vomiting forth burning red-hot balls. &ldquo;Maro Feringhiko!&rdquo; Lieutenant Dick and Lieutenant Meiklejohn have mounted the ladders and are calling upon their men to follow them. Boom, boom! Instantly, the daring Englishmen fell in the jaws of death! Anyone coming behind? Lieutenant Bonus and heroic Lieutenant Fox, you seem anxious for death - your desire shall be accomplished; - die, then! Seeing these four heroes who had scaled with the greatest difficulty shot down, the ladders trembled. They swayed and broke under the weight of the English troops. The English sounded the bugle to retire; the army began to go back - it went back, the soldiers concealing themselves behind every stray stone!58
58 “No sooner did we turn into the road leading towards the gate, than the enemy’s bugle sounded, and a fire of indescribabl e fierceness opened upon us from the whole line of the walls and from the tower of the fort overlooking this site. For a time it appeared like a sheet of fire,
A strong defence was thus offered at the principal gate. But who is giving forth that tragic wail near the southern ramparts? May it be that mean treachery had lost the Morcha gate? Yes, unfortunately yes; the English have captured the gate, with the air of treachery - so it is said - and they have mounted the ramparts, and are advancing rapidly on. There was no other thought that day but to kill or be killed! Once within the city, the English gave no quarter and streams of blood flowed freely. The English, taking one position after another, massacring, firing, destroying - came right up to the palace. As soon as the palace was forced, thousands of Rupees were looted, guards were massacred, and buildings were destroyed. At last, alas! Jhansi had fallen into the enemy&rsquo;s hands!
Standing on the rampartrs, the Ranee looked back for one moment at Jhansi. Before her rose the hideous picture of the terrible disaster that had happened near the south gate. The enemy had, after all, defiled her Jhansi! Her eyes were ablaze with anger; she was almost mad with rage. She took up her sword and, with her small force of a thousand or fifteen hundred men, she marched down the fort. The tigress to avenge her cubs runs not so fleetingly. As soon as she saw the white troops near the southern gate, she rushed for them, and then, “swords crossed, the two armies were mixed up before you could count even fifty; swords flourished and dealt heard blows. Many Englishmen were killed. The rest ran towards the town and began to fire shots from under cover!” By this sight of Feringhi blood, the anger of this Kali was a little appeased, and now she saw that it was foolhardy to fight alone so far from the fort. But echoes of such daring heroism were now to be heard in every street in the city. Fifty stablemen in the palace, while the whole town and the palace itself was bathed in blood shed by English
out of which burst a store of bullets, round shots, and rockets destined for our annihilation&hellip;&hellip; But the fire of the enemy waxed stronger, and amidst the chaos of sounds, of volleys of musketry and roaring of cannon, hissing and bursting rockets, stink-pots, infernal machines, huge stones, blocks of wood, and trees, all hurled upon our heads, it seemed as though Pluto and the Furies
had been loosened upon us, carrying death amongst us fast. At this instant a bugle sounded on our right
for the Europeans to retire.” – Lowe’s Central India, page 254.
swords, refused to give up the stables! “Surrender” was a word not to be found in their dictionary. Everyone of these men cut down the enemy as hard as he could, and it was only when everyone of them was killed that the paga fell into the enemy’s hands! The English had, by now, rendered the whole town desolate. Everyone who fell into their hands, from children of five to old men of eighty, were massacred; the whole city was set fire to; wailings from the wounded and the dying, and the cries of those who killed, filled the air. A huge wail rose from the whole town!
When the Queen stood on the walls of the fortress (which the enemy had decided to storm only the next day on account of its strength), looking at this sad, sad picture, she was smitten with grief and tears started to her eyes! The Queen of Jhansi wept! Those beautiful eyes were red with weeping! Her Jhansi to be reduced to this! Then she looked up and saw the flag of the Feringhi flying over the walls of Jhansi, and a strange fire shone from those weeping eyes! All glory to her courage! But why is this messenger running hard towards her? He said, &ldquo;Your Majesty, the pre- eminently brave Sirdar who guarded the chief gate of the fort, Sirdar Kuar Khuda Buksh, and Gulam Ghose Khan, the chief gunner of the artillery, have both been shot down by the English!&rdquo; What a blow this to the already afflicted Queen! What a succession of disasters this! What is your next plan, then, Queen? Aye, one and one alone! She said to the messenger, who was no other than an old Sirdar, &quot; I have determined to blow myself up with the fort, setting fire to the ammunition with my own hands.&rdquo; With her Jaripatka she must be - if not on the throne, at least on the pyre!
Hearing this, the old Sirdar calmly replied, &ldquo;Your Majesty, as it is not safe to be in this neighbourhood now, your Majesty should leave the fort to-night breaking through the enemy&rsquo;s camp and should join the Peshwa&rsquo;s forces. If death comes on the way, the conquest of heaven by a dip in the sacred waters of the battle-field is always at hand!&rdquo; Lakshmi said, &ldquo;I should choose to die on the battle-field, but, being a woman, I fear that the enemy might insult my person!&rdquo; To this the whole Durbar answered with one voice: &ldquo;Insult! So long as there is life in the body of the least among us, our sword shall cut to pieces the enemy who woulod dare so much as touch your sacred person!&rdquo;
Well then, the night had fallen; Lakshmi greeted all her dear subjects and gave them her blessings for the last time! Her subjects were full of tears at the thought that she was leaving Jhansi, perhaps for ever. She took a selected number of horsemen with her. An elephant with jewels on him was placed in the middle and Ranee Lakshmi descended the fort amidst cries of &ldquo;Har, Har, Mahadev!&rdquo; She put on male apparel; a steel armour covered her person, a Jammia was in her girdle; a fine sword hung from her belt, a silver cup was in her Pudder, and her adopted child Damodar was on her back, tied in silk Dhoti. Thus accoutred, riding on a noble white steed, this queen, Lakshmi, looked like the goddess of war. When the north gate came, the sentry who belonged to the traitor army of the Tehri State asked, &ldquo;Who goes there?&rdquo; &ldquo;The army of Tehri is going to the aid of Sir Huge Rose,&rdquo; was the answer. The sentry was satisfied and Ranee advanced, evading the English sentry too in a similar manner. One maid, one bargeer, and ten or fifteen horsemen formed her body-guard, and marched through the camp of the enemy. But her other horsemen were stopped by the English on suspicion and had to fight hard. Moro Punt Tambe, wounded though he was, was able to run as far as Datia. But the traitor Dewan of that State captured him and gave him over to the English, who later on hanged him.
But, Lakshmi, put your horse now in a gallop. For Lieutenant Bowker is galloping behind, followed by select horsemen, in order to capture you. And you, O horse, fortunate on account of the sacred treasure you carry, gallop on! Let the men of Bharata be traitors, but, ye animals, ye at least be faithful! O Night, drop the curtain of darkness between Queen Lakshmi and her enemies ! O horse, fleeting as you are, quicker than the wind, balance Lakshmi lightly! Ye paths, do not obstruct the horse&rsquo;s onward march! O ye stars, shine not for the enemy, but just shine so that this tender beauty, delicate as a flower, should be encouraged on the way by your rays,
cool as nectar! The dawn has now broken; so, heroic Queen, flying all night on the wings of the wind, rest thee near the village of Bhandeir. The Mahalkuree of the village will feed your darling Damodar.
As soon as breakfast was over, she again started on her journey on the Kalpi road. But what is this dust behind? Spur your horses on! Lakshmi, keep Damodar safe on the back and gallop on. Tak our your sword! There, Bowker is pressing close! Here is the reward for your wicked pursuit! Dare you hold back the lightning? A long sweep of her sword, and Bowker was violently thrown off his horse. A deadly fight took place between her fifteen or twenty horsemen and the English pursuers; those who were alive advanced forward to protect Lakshmi Bai. Wounded Bowker and his handful of men gave up the pursuit. The sword of the Mother advanced triumphant, shining. The sun in the heaven above, Ranee Lakshmi Bai on earth - both were marching forward. Morning was gone and mid-day came, but the Ranee did not stop. Afternoon came, the shades of evening began to fall, the sun went down the horizon - but the Ranee still would not stop. The stars rose. They saw her just as they had seen her the night before - marching, marching in hot haste. At last, at midnight, Ranee Lakshmi entered Kalpi. A ride of a hundred and two miles she accomplished, and that, fighting with Lieutenant Bowker and his soldiers and with the burden of a child on her back. That horse just lived, it so seemed, to carry her to Kalpi. For, as soon as he saw the rider safe in Kalpi, he fell down on the ground all in a heap. Six men were immediately ordered to attend to the horse. The Ranee loved the horse very much. A horse which carried safe such a person with such faithfulness deserves to be remembered, and his memory will be loved for all time.
The Ranee slept till dawn. In the morning, the touching meeting between the Ranee and Shri Rao Sahib Peshwa took place. Both remembered their ancestors - the thought that they were descended from those who had done such seemingly impossible deeds inspired them both. They realised that the flag of the Mahratta empire waved as far as Attock
because men like the Scindia and the Holkar, the Gaekwar and Bundela and Patwardhan were ready to give up their lives for Swaraj. And for that very flag, for that very Swaraj for which their fathers and grandfathers had bled, they resolved to continue uninterrupted, to the very last breath of their lives, the war already begun against those who attempted to enslave their motherland. So, they resolved to carry on the war as vigorously as ever. And again did Lakshmi Bai and the brave Tatia Tope begin to make preparations for the coming deadly fight.
While these arrangements are going on there, we shall take a rapid glance at the activities of Brigadier Whitlock whom we had left sometime back. To reconquer the tract between the Narbada and the Ganes and the Jumna, two armies had started and, of these, the one under Sir Hugh Rose, as we had already seen, had taken Jhansi. When Jhansi was taken, the British indulged in a wholesale looting such as Nadir Shah alone had accomplished before, defiling of temples and polluting of images, and massacring terribly all alike. That finished, the army continued the campaign. The last part of the campaign had been appointed for Brigadier Whitlock to accomplish. Accordingly, Brigadier Whitlock started on the 17th of February from Jubbulpore, with all his army - European regiments, Indian regiments from Madras, &ldquo;black&rdquo; and white cavalry, and splendid artillery. He entered Sagar in triumph, where the loyal Raja of Oorcha joined him. The, the English army began to advance on the Nabob of Banda, the chief leader of the Revolutionaries in that province. In the beginning of the Revolution at Jhansi, Sagar, and other places, cruel massacres had taken place and the Europeans from those places ran wherever they could to save their lives. The Nabob had brought them to his palace and was looking after them well. But, at the same time, he was as busy in trying to throw off the British yoke already tottering through the shocks of the Revolution as he was in saving the lives of these Enbglishmen. From the very beginning, the symbols of slavery in his kingdom had been smashed and he was runing as
an independent prince. Seeing the English army coming to deprive him of his liberty, the Nabob, urged and aided by the whole populace, was ready for battle. Several engagements took place between the two parties, but, being defeated in them, the Nabob started for Kalpi with his army, and Whitlock entered Banda in triumph on the 19th of April. The next march was to be on the Rao of Kirwi.
Rao Madhav Rao of Kirwi was a child of ten and his guardianship was in the hands of the English. The Rao of Kirwi was a near relation of Baji Rao Peshwa. In 1827, Anant Rao, the then ruler of Kirwi, deposited two lakhs of Rupees with the English Government for some charities in connection with the temples of Benares. As soon as he died, the English swallowed the whole amount. More than that, they took unlawful possession of a further sum of several lakhs of Rupees foolishly deposited with them by Anant Rao&rsquo;s son, Vinayak Rao, in spite of the lesson he had already received. This was soon after Vinayak Rao&rsquo;s death. Rao Madhav, the adopted son of Vinayak Rao, being a minor, as the supervision of the whole state was in the hands of the English, and Ramachandra Rao, the chief Karbhari, had been appointed by the English, there was every reason to suppose that there would not be much fear of revolt in the Kirwi State. But, in 1857, whatever the Raos and Maharaos did was not quietly acquiesced in by the people. Sometimes obsecurely and sometimes clearly, the power of the people, the strength of the real nation, was slowly struggling into prominence. The Zemindars, the priests, the merchants of Kirwi, nay, even the common people, inspired by the strong ideal of liberty, hailed with joy the news which one day proclaimed Delhi free and the next day Lucknow and the third that Jhansi had uprooted the flags of the Feringhi. Encouraged by these hopeful incidents, they proclaimed the independence of Kirwi and the destruction of the alien yoke, not waiting for the opinion of the Rao or the sanction of his ministers. Now, while this proclamation was being loudly celebrated by the populace, the Rao, a boy of nine or ten, had not done even a single thing against the English! Nay, when the English army returned to
Bundelkhand, he went forward to receive them and invited them into the city. According to his invitation, the English army entered the city silently, but they entered to imprison this little Rao, to destroy his capital and to pull down his palace! Dreadful looting,59 wholesale burning, and a vengeance of wickedness took place. And the State was annexed.
Whitlock now encamped at Mahoba, in order to &lsquo;pacify&rsquo; the conquered provinces. As a matter of fact, he had now completed his campaign. He had conquered all the eastern part of Bundelkhand and he had sent small expeditions to &lsquo;pacify&rsquo; one or two places. So now, leaving Whitlock, let us again follow the sacred steps of the gallant Queen of Jhansi.
The Ranee, now again full of hope, made an advance on Kunchgaon, forty-two miles from Kalpi, with the army of te Peshwa. But the Rao Sahib, if would appear, had not arranged the forces as she would have liked him to. It must be borne in mind, however, that it was not possible to make effective arrangements, either for Rao Sahib or Tatia Tope. Though in that place, the Nabob of Banda, the Raja of Shahgarh, and the Raja of Banapur had all gathered together under the same flat, they had not gathered together as the organised and disciplined parts of a grand military force, moved by oneness of heart, with a unity of plan and constitution, sustained by strict military discipline and subordination. No one could get his ideas carried out. But, in the opposing army, there was no such conflict amongst leaders. It seemed that the whole organisation was perfect and wellcontrolled. Before Sir Hugh Rose was appointed commander, there was heated discussion and difference of opinion; but, once he was the
59 “With regard to this injustice done to Rao, Malleson has to confess : “Not a shot had been fired against him (Whitlock), but he resolved nevertheless to treat the young Rao as though he had actually opposed the British forces. The reason for this perversion of honest dealing lay in the fact that in the palace of Kirwi was stored the wherewithal to compensate soldiers for many a hard fight and many a broiling sun. In its vaults and strong rooms were specie, jewels, and diamonds of priceless value&hellip;.. The wealth was coveted.” – Kaye and Malleson’s Indian Mutiny, Vol. V, pages 140,141.
commander, his opinion was the opinion of all. Whatever orders he issued were
right; and, even if they were not right, they must be obeyed. And even mistaken orders of a weak general carried out by the obedient and unanimous bravery of the troops under him, become successful – are bound to become successful. On the other hand, even well-planned orders of a capable general lead to disaster and defeat, through the self-willed behaviour of the troops and the lack of oneness in command and proper subordination.
Otherwise the rout at Kunchgaon could never have been place. As soon as Sir Hugh Road came from Jhansi, the Revolutionaries met him at Kunchgaon. Knowing that the mid-day sun was unbearable to the English, the Revolutionaries had ordered in one of their commands, “None should engage in a fight with the Feringhis before ten in the morning. The fight should begin always after ten.” This very clever rule was put into practice this day. Much havoc was thereby created in the English army as happened on many other occasions where the fight took place after ten. But, in spite of this, the Revolutionaries were defeated at Kunchgaon and retired towards Kalpi. The admirable way in which they retired, the organised manner in which they fell back has been praised very much even by the enemy.60 But then this excellent organisation came after and not before the engagement.
60 &ldquo;Then was witnessed action on the part of the rebels which impelled admiration from their
enemies. The manner in which they conducted their retreat could not be surpassed. They
remembered the lessons which the European officers had well taught them. There was no
hurry, no disorder, no rushing to the rear. All was orderly as on a field-day. Though their line
of skirmishers was two miles in length, it never wavered in a single point. The men fired, then
ran behind the relieving men, and loaded. The relieving men then fired, and ran back in their
turn. They even attempted, when they thought the pursuit was too rash, to take up a position,
so as to bring on it an enfilading fire.&rdquo; - Malleson&rsquo;s Indian Mutiny, Vol. V, page 124.
With this defeat, the Revolutionaries came on to Kalpi. There, they began to make up for the defeat by wrangling against and abusing one another, - the infantry laid the defeat at the door of the cavalry, the cavalry blamed the Jhansi troops, and all together blamed the general, Tatia.
But, Tatia Tope is not going to come any more to Kalpi to hear these wranglings. He has gone at present to the village of Charkhi, near Jalwan, to see his father. No one knows definitely where he is going after that, or whether he is going there at all. Let us remember that Gwalior lies in the direction of his road ! May the meeting between this extraordinary son and his fortunate father be full of love! And after that loving visit, may this great messenger of the Revolution go with despatch to carry out whatever designs he might have set his heart on!
While Tatia was going on this journey, Ranee Lakshmi went to the royal tent of the Peshwa. The heroic Lakshmi relieved him of his dejection after the defeat of Kunchgaon and said to him that, if the army was properly organised, the enemy should never again be victorious. The Nabob of Banda was inspired by her speech. Proclamations in spirited language were again published in the Revolutionary army. And to-day, on the banks of the Jumna, crowds are gathering. Swords and guns, angry Sepoys invoking the Jumna to bless the cause of the indedpendence of their soil - such a Revolutionary pilgrimage the banks of the Jumna had probably never before seen. These banks are simply echoing forth the triumphant cries for the Mother and for Dharma!&rdquo; Jai Jumna! With this thy sacred water in our hands, we swear that the Feringhis shall be extinct, that Swadesh shall be independent, and that Swadharma shall be re-established! Jai Jumna! If all this is accomplished, then alone we will live. If not, we will die this day on the field of battle. We swear, by thee, O Kalindi, three times!&rdquo;
Heroes, thrice bound by this oath, come on then to the field. Rao Sahib will lead the whole army. Drive away this 25th infantry under Sir
Hugh Rose. They are all Indians - drive these traitors before you! Major Orr advances - make him share the same defeat! In this maidan before Kalpi, our position - with this undulatory part to cover - is almost impregnable. But look, the vanguard is falling back! It went too far, and being not well covered, has had to retreat. Run then, Lakshmi, run to protect them. She rushed forward sword in her hand with lightning-like rapidity, and fell on the right wing of the English, with her red-uniformed cavalry. The triumphant right stopped dead, so sudden was the attack; stopped dead, and then retired back helpless. This rapid onslaught of the girl of twenty-one, her horse at full speed, her sword cutting men down to the right and to the left, - seeing this, who would not fight for her? Who would not be inspired by her? All the Revolutionaries were inspired by her strength; the battle raged bloody and hot. The Feringhi gunners of the light field artillery began to die one after another. The Ranee and her cavalry, then, advanced right on the guns which were spitting deadly fire, and attacked the artillery. English gunners left the guns; the horse artillery was routed; the heroes of the Revolution advanced on and on, from all sides, overjoyed at the prospect of crushing the Feringhis who had so long escaped them; and before them all fought Lakshmi!
This praise by the enemy does credit to the Panday party.
Sir Hugh Rose, taken aback by this terrible onslaught, then advanced with his reserve camels, and the English saved their own lives, simply because of the camels. An English writter says, “Fifteen minutes more, and the mutineers would have cut us down! Fresh camels, one hundred and fifty in number, changed the fortunes of the day. Ever since that day, I have looked on the camel with eyes of affection.” By the strength of the camelmen alone, on the 22nd of May, the Feringhis succeeded in forcing the Peshwa’s army to retire towards Kalpi. After another complete defeat of the Peshwa’s troops and after a few skirmishes, Sir Hugh entered Kalpi on the 24th May. In the fort of Kalpi, the English captured a very considerable amount of military supplies which Shri Rao Sahib Peshwa and
Tatia Tope had, with great trouble, gathered together in one year. Sixty thousand pounds of gunpowder were found buried under the ground; muskets beautifully made, brass balls of the latest type for the guns, factories for making and repairing cannon-balls, heaps of military uniforms, flags, drums, French trumpets, Howitzer guns manufactured in Europe, and arms of various kind - such was the very useful find that the English army came upon! What they did not capture was the brave and ever-memorable leaders of the Revolutionaries. For, when Kalpi fell after a week, Rao Sahib, the Nabob of Banda, Ranee Lakshmi Bai, and other leaders had left Kalpi and gone - nobody knew where. But now these unfortunate, helpless people, without an army and without arms, could do nothing beyond falling into the jaws of death, either by privations, or ny capture, or ny suicide!
Thus Sir Colin had begun the reconquest from the northern bank of the Jumna, and went on conquering as far as the Himalayas. Sir Hugh Rose and Whitlock be.gan from the Narbada, and conquered all the country as far as the South bank of the Jumna. The English had now every reason to congratulate themselves that they had destroyed the Revolution completely. Sir Hugh Rose congratulated his army in these eloquent words :- &ldquo;Soldiers, you have marched one thousand miles, captured one hundred guns, swam rivers, crossed mountains, marched through jungles, defeated big armies, reconquered extensive tracts, and reestablished the glory of your country! Brave you are; and you have also observed the strictest discipline; for courage without discipline is nought. In the midst of difficulties, temptations, and trouble, you have obeyed strictly the orders of your general, and have never showed even a single sign of insubordination. From the waters of the Narbada to the waters of the Jumna, this, your success, has come to you through your splendid discipline!&rdquo;
After publishing this glorifying proclamation, Sir Hugh resigned his charge for the sake of his health. And the triumphant English army,
having destroyed the enemy completely, sighed the sigh of relief and wished to rest.
But how dare you rest yet? While Tatia and Ranee Lakshmi Bai are alive, there is no rest possible for the British troops. Come, stand up! And if you would not stand of your own accord, here is the whole force of Gwalior, ready to goad you on! After escaping from Kalpi, the Revolutionary leaders went to Gopalpur to discuss their future plans. Practically, at this time, there was not a sign of hope. From the Narbada to the Jumna, and from Jumna to the Himalayas, the English had conquered back the whole territory. The Revolutionaries were without an army, without a fort, without any hope of getting fresh forces - defeated as they were again and again. But Tatia Tope was still alive, and that was enough! Tatia, too, had returned to Gopalpur. People say he had returned after visiting his father. Whatever people say, history does not say so. It was when Sir Hugh tried his deep-laid game at Kalpi that Tatia had a sudden fit of fondness for his father - a fondness, by -the-bye, which seemed to exceed even his fondness for fight; and, no longer able to control his filial feelings, he want to Charkhi to see his father. What was the secret of this sudden passion? The secret was that, as soon as Kalpi fell, it was absolutely necessary to get hold of some other strong position, some strong fortress, and some new army. And, therefore, this Messenger of the Revolution had escaped from Kalpi secretly to enter Gwalior, and see how the Revolutionary idea was progressing there! He accepted the promises of the chief officers of the army and created a new army for the Revolution, by secretly winning over the Durbar functionaries, Sirdars, and others. They promised to give him all the aid they could, and in one month he had the whole of Gwalior in the hollow of his hand. He then collected every information about the military position of Gwalior and, thus, after undermining the throne of the Scindia, Tatia returned to Rao Sahib at Gopalpur. He had &lsquo;seen his father&rsquo;! Learning the glad news, that Tatia had come back from Gwalior having successfully won over the people to the sided of the Revolution, Ranee Lakshmi urged the Peshwa to advance straight towards Gwalior. On the 28th of May, the Revolutionaries came to Amin Mahal. The Mahalkars tried to stop them. They were answered, &ldquo;Who are you to obstruct us? We are the Peshwa and his forces and we are fighting for Swaraj and Swadharma.&rdquo; These words of Rao Sahib silenced the cowards, and thousands of patriots in that part welcomes the Revolutionaries heartily, and thus the army of the Peshwa pressed right on the walls of the city of Gwalior. They had written to the Scindia, &ldquo;We are coming to you in a friendly spirit. Remember our former relations. We expect help from you, so that we shall be enabled to proceed towards the south.&rdquo; But this ungrateful man had forgotten the former relations. Well then, remember the former and the present relations too! &ldquo;The ancestors of the Scindia were our servants, our Hujres - that was the former relation. And, the present relation? The whole army of the present Scindia has joined us. Tatia had gone to Gwalior, seen the leaders, and gained all necessary information!&rdquo; But still, forgetting all this the Scindia, with all his army and all his guns, advanced on the Peshwa on the 1st of June, near Gwalior. The Shrimant who deserves the respect of the whole country thought for a moment that the Scindia had repented and was coming forward to salute the flag of Swadesh. But, Lakshmi said that he was coming, not to salute, but to smash that golden flag. She came forward with her three hundred horsemen and advanced right on the guns of the Scindia. Soon, she caught the view of Jayaji Rao Scindia and his personal guard the brave
&ldquo;Bhaleghate&rdquo; troops. The cobra shows not such rage when it is trodden upon as Lakshmi showed at the sight of this traitor! Like an arrow she dashed at his troops. Behold, you Bahadur - descendant of Mahadaji, this helpless girl of twenty-two, brought up in the Zenana, is inving you for a trial of strength of the sword! Let us all see now how much of the prowess of Mahadaji, the
devoted lover of his country, has descended upon this Jayaji the devoted slave of the Feringhi! As soon as this angry lightning struck him hard on the front, his personal guards wavered and the Scindia, with all his &ldquo;Bhaleghate&rdquo; troops,was routed. But, at least, there was hope that his huge army and terrible artillery would do their best - and they did do their best! As soon as they saw Tatia, these troops which had been bound over by secret oaths to Tatia refused, point-blank, to fight against the Peshwa. As previously arranged, they joined the Peshwa with all their officers; the guns were silent and everyone in Gwalior honoured the flag of the Peshwa. The throne of the Scindia thus crumbled to pieces at the touch of the Revolutionary magician.
And so, Jayaji Rao Scindia, coward as he was, and his minister, Dinkar Rao, fled, not only from the field, but from Gwalior itself, and ran to Agra!
Gwalior, was now mad with joy. The army fired salutes in honour of the Shrimant. The Finance Minister, Amar Chand Bhatia, surrendered the whole treasury of the Scindia, to the last pie, to Shrimant. Those few patriots who were in prison under the old regime for having shown sympathy with the Revolutionaries were released from their prisons amidstthe joyous cries of the populace. The traitors who had advised the Scindia to join the English had fled, but their mansions and their property were destroyed so that not a vestige of them remained. The black charge that the Asiatics do not understand the true relation between a ruler and his subjects, was washed away completely by Gwalior. For, how can he who goes against his own country and against his own Dharma be a ruler? Poona had been in 1818 guilty of being a traitor to the motherland is not having dragged Rao Baji from his Peshwai in right time. Gwalior was not guilty of that! And therefore, this Revolution of 1857 must be recorded in history as the first indication in modern India of the omnipotence of the vox populi, the power of the people. If Scindia joins not his country, the country shall not aid him either. Swords and guns, infantry and cavalry, Durbar and Sirdars, Mankarees and citizens, temples and images - all are for the
country, alone; and if the Scindia is not for the country, drag him down from his throne; and outside the palace, outside the capital, outside the borders of the kingdom let him be driven out! Hereafter, according to the Scriptures, &ldquo;The King receives his power only by pleasing the people!&rdquo;
And now, we must not let this auspicious day, the 3rd of June, slip by uselessly. And so &ldquo;a big Durbar was held in Phul Bagh. All Sirdars, statesmen noblemen, Shiledars, and cavalry officers, who had joined the Shrimant, took their seats according to their rank. Tatia Tope and the Arabs, Rohillas, Pathans, Rajputs, Rangdes, Pardeshis, and others under him came to the Durbar in their military uniform and with swords by their side. The Shrimant himself was dressed in the Peshwa&rsquo;s uniform Shirpana and Kalgitura on head, pearls in his ears, and pearl and diamond necklaces, round his neck. Thus, with all the paraphernalia of the Peshwai, Bhaldars and Chobdars making way for him, and Mourchas flying, the Shrimant came to the Durbar. Then, as usual, all stood up in reverence, salutes were received, and the Shrimant ascended the throne. With tears of joy in his eyes, he congratulated all the noblemen with great eloquence. Ram Rao Govind was appointed Chief Minister. Tatia Tope was made general and a sword studded with precious stones was presented to him. The eight ministers were elected. Twenty lakhs of Rupees were distributed to the army. The Durbar was a complete success. Joy was on every face and salutes of guns were fired.&ldquo;61
Shrimant Rao Sahib, representative of Nana Sahib Peshwa, had thus established a new throne, infusing a new hope and a new life into the Revolutionary party, and had created a centre, a basis, round which might be attracted the scattered forces of the Revolution. Tatia Tope was not mad in busying himself with this coronation and giving salutes after salutes just

in a midst of the war. The whole world had seen the dead body of the Revolution which by this means alone he now lifted from the grave of despair. The world – some with pleasure and others with despair – had cried : “That is a dead body, there is no life in it!” But what wonderful magic this! Tatia took the dead earth at Gopalpur, he breathed on it thus, and – wonderful! – the whole world saw with the dumbness of surprise, a throne rising from the thimbleful of earth, jingling with lakhs of Rupees! Wonder of wonders! See the thousands of swordsmen advancing; hear the salutes thundering forth from the guns! A new army is up, new guns are up, Tatia has captured a new kingdom! Tatia has done all this not meely to strike the world dumb with his splendid triumph. He knew that the Revolutionaries who had spread far and wide would, on hearing the salutes proclaiming the Shrimant as a Peshwa of the Mahratta empire, get a concentrated inspiration, vigour, and hope. He knew that the sight of the triumphant flag of the nation, thus unfurled at Gwalior, would infuse an uncontrollable enthusiasm and dash. He knew that the lawlessness which had set in owing to the want of a rallying point, would now make way for discipline, through respect for the new-established throne. All this Tatia saw. And what he foresaw soon came to pass. For the body of the Panday party was soon instinct with life. While thus, on the one hand, his countrymen were encouraged, the English army, which just gave a sigh of relief, was, on the other hand, again disheartened. It was for this that the coronation was proclaimed loudly by Tatia and other leaders of the Revolution. Their deep- laid game was successful. For, by this very thunder of Tatia&rsquo;s cannon, Sir Hugh Rose&rsquo;s idea of rest was rudely shattered to pieces!62
62 Malleson, writing about the cleverness and diplomacy which Tatia and Lakshmi Bai showed in taking Gwalior, says :- &ldquo;How the &ldquo;Impossible&rdquo; happened has been told &hellip;. He
(Sir Hugh Rose) realised, moreover, the great danger which would inevitably be caused by
delay. No one could foresee the extent of evil possible if Gwalior were not promptly wrested
from rebel hands. Grant them delay, and Tatia Tope, with the immense acquisition of political
and military strength secured by the possession of Gwalior, and with all its resources in men,
So far so good; but once having shocked Sir Hugh Rose and disheartened him, woe betide him who listened not to the words of Ranee Lakshmi Bai! All other functions but the one great function of war must be stopped. But it seemed that, as ill-luck would have it, the intoxication of the Revolutionaries would make them blind to the necessity of heeping the army in complete readiness. They were all immersed in luxury, good dinners, and fatal dilatoriness – they thought, perhaps, that this was the sole end of Swaraj!
They were onlo losing Swaraj. For, the surprised Sir Hugh Rose marched rapidly on Gwalior with his excellent army under him. He brought with him the renegade Scindia and proclaimed to all that the English were going to fight only for the Scindia’s sake! It was a trick to deceive the simple men of Gwalior, who had the slavish and discreditable merit of blind loyalty, and it was calculated to prevent these from fighting against the Scindia. But the old world had changed, giving place to the new. Tatia, so far successful in awakening the Revolutionaries,
rushed forward to meet the English. The English had already defeated the Morar contingents. Now, with the shadow of defeat on them, there began some excited movements among the Revolutionary leaders. Rao Sahib was hastening towards the house of the Nabob of Banda and the Nabob of Banda was rushing towards the house of Rao Sahib. But, in the midst of all this confusion, the Ranee alone was calm and was ready. Her sword was out. What need she fear now? Hope as well as despair she had trampled under
money and material at his disposal, would be able to form a new army on the fragments of that
beaten at Kalpi, and to provoke a Mahratta rising throughout India. It might be possible for
him, using the dexterity of which he was a master, to unfurl the Peshwa&rsquo;s banner in the
southern Mahratta districts. Those districts were denudedof troops, and a striking success in
Central India would probably decide their inhabitants to pronounce in favour of the cause for
which their fathers had fought and bled.&rdquo; - Malleson&rsquo;s Indian Mutiny, Vol. V, pages 149-150.
foot; she treated with contempt the things on this earth; she had one aspiration alone, namely, that the flag of liberty should stand proudly erect until she gave up her last breath! Neither of them were to be in the dust; they were to lie in battle alone. So, she gave Rao Sahib a word of courage, rearranged the undisciplined troops as far as she could, and took upon herself the task of guarding the eastern gate. She only demanded, &ldquo;I am ready with all my soul to do my duty; mind, you do yours!&rdquo;
She donned her usual military uniform, rode a noble steed, took out her gem-bestudded sword from the sheath, and ordered the army under her to march on. She made ready all the posts near Kotaki Serai which had been given to her care and, when the English army was in sight, everywhere, trumpets and pipes, drums and nagaras rent the air. If only she had an army, equal in courage and daring to herself! Even the insubordinate and hesitating felt heroic under her influence and, with them and her select band of horsemen, she charged hard the English army! Her two female friends, Mandar and Kashi, also fought bravely by her side. May the sweet memory of those two patriotic girls - beautiful in appearance, with male attire put on, taking pleasure in fight - live in history along with that of their mistress as long as history lives! A general like Smith was charging the Ranee&rsquo;s army, but to-day the Ranee&rsquo;s bravery and daring were a sight to see. Like lightning, she moved about all day. The English attacked the solid phalanx a number of times. One very occasion she maintained her hold firm. Her army occasionally felt enthusiastic and attacked the British and cut down many of them. At last, Smith was forced to retire; he gave up the attempt of breaking the mass and began to turn to another side, leaving the nest of the cobra alone!
Thus closed the day and thus rose the 18th of the month! This day, the English had resolved to make desperate charges. From all directions, they advanced on the fort, and tried their utmost. General Smith, forced to retire the day before, was very determined to-day and, aided by re- inforcements, he charged the same Jhansi side he had gone for the day
before. Sir Hugh Rose thought that his presence was also absolutely necessary and so he was personally present with the force attacking the Jhansi side. The Ranee too was ready for him with all her forces. &ldquo;She
was ready with all her soul to do her duty.&rdquo; That day, she wore a Chanderi turban embroidered all over, a tamamee cloak, and pyjamas. A pearl necklace was round her neck. Her famous steed being tired that day, a new, fresh-looking horse was made ready for her, fully caparisoned. While her two beautiful maids were taking sherbet, news came that the English were advancing. Lakshmi immediately darted forwarded from her tent. The arrow flies not so rapidly, the lightning flashes not forth with such force from the clouds, a lioness leaves not her lair so quickly to fall upon the approaching elephant! She rode her horse, lifted her sword, and charged the enemy with her army. As English writer says, &ldquo;Immediately the beautiful Ranee went over the field and made a firm stand against the array of Sir Hugh Rose. She led her troops to repeated and fierce attacks and, though her ranks were pierced through and were gradually becoming thinner and thinner, the Ranee was seen in the foremost rank, rallying her shattered troops and performing prodigies of valour. But all was of no avail. The camel corps, pushed up by Shri Huge Rose in person, broke her last line. Still the dauntless and heroic Ranee held her own.&rdquo;
But while her side was fighting with such unexampled bravery, she saw the English army advancing on her rear - for they had broken through the ranks of Revolutionaries who were holding the posts behind her!
The artillery dumb, the main army routed, the victorious English army closing on her from all sides, with only fifteen or twenty horsemen with her, Ranee Lakshmi, accompanied by her maids, put her horse to a gallop, in order to break through the enemy, and to join her comrades on the other side. The Feringhi horsemen of the Hussars, who knew not so far where she was, fired shot after shot on her and pursued her like hounds. But the Queen, with unexampled courage, cleared her way with her sword and
marched on. Suddenly was heard a cry, &ldquo;I am dead, Bai Sahib, I am dead!&rdquo; Alas, whose is this cry? Lakshmi turned round and found that it was her maid Mandar whom a white soldier had shot and killed! Angered, she attacked the Feringhi, and her blow felled him on the spot. She had avenged the death of fair Mandar! She then marched on. She came to a small rill. Now, one jump and Jhansi would have been out of the Feringhi&rsquo;s clutches. But her horse would not take that jump! If only she had had her old horse! As if the fiery line of a magician was round him the horse moved in circles, round and round, but would not cross. Before you could say &ldquo;one&rdquo;, the English horsemen closed on her! Still not a word of surrender or fear! One sword against their several swords, - yet she closed on them. She crossed sword with sword with them all, but one of them hit her on the head from behind. With that blow, the right part of her head, and even her
right eye came out - just then, another blow hit her on the chest. Oh Lakshmi, Lakshmi! The last drop of thy sacred blood is dripping and, therefore, now, Mother, take this last sacrifice for thee! Even at the point of death, she killed the British foe who had attacked her, and now the young Queen was breathing her last breath! A faithful servant, Ramchandra Rao Deshmukh, was near. He took her to a cottage near by. Ganga Das Bawa gave her cold water to drink to quench her thirst and a bed to lie down upon. Bathed in blood, this goddess of war reclined on the bed, and then her soul quietly fleeteed from her body to heaven! As soon as she was dead, Ramchandra Rao, in accordance with her dying instructions prepared a pile of grass unseen by the enemy; he put her on that pure and, before the touch of slavery could defile even her dead body, she was cremated.
On the pyre, if not on the throne! But Lakshmi is still with her sweetheart Liberty! She has forced open the gates of death by falling in battle and has now entered the other world. Pursuit can no longer harm her. Wicked Pursuit must pass through those roaring flames before it can do so.
Thus fought Lakshmi. She had achieved her purpose, fulfilled her ambition, carried out her resolve! One such life vindicates the whole existence of a nation! She was the concentrated essence of all virtues. A mere woman, hardly twenty-three yet, beautiful as rose, charming in her manners, pure of conduct, she had a power of organisation of her subjects, exhibited by very few, even among men. The flame of patriotism was always burning in her heart. And she proud of her country&rsquo;s honour and pre- eminent in war! It is very rarely that a nation is so fortunate as to be able to claim such an angelic person, as a daughter and a queen. That honour has not yet fallen to the lot of England. In the Revolution of Italy, high ideals and heroism of the very highest type are to be found; yet, in all this period of glody, Italy could not give birth to Lakshmi!
But, even our land could hardly have given birth to such a Queen but for this glorious War of Independence! The precious pearls in the ocean are not to be found on its surface. The Suryakanta jewel does not give out flames in the quiet of the night; nor does the flint give up its spark on soft cushions. They want resistance. Injustice must make the mind restless; really, not apparently, every drop of blood most actually boil; intense national feeling is thus set aflane in such a furnace, the particles of virtue begin to flow, the test goes on, the dross is eliminated, then, the concentrated essence of virtues begins to appear. In 1857, the heart of this our Motherland took fire; then, a terrible explosion which would deafen the world took place; - A spark at Meerut, and the whole country, which, under the roller of Dalhousie, had been reduced to the monotony of a dead level and seemed to be a heap of dust, proved to be a powder-magazine filled with the most inflammable material. Just as when a mighty rocket in a fireplay, fired in the air, explodes, arrows and trees and various other picturesque objects rise and rush and burn and die away, such was the case of this gigantic Revolutionary Rocket! Its length is from Meerut to the Vindhyas; its width from Peshawar to Dumdum;- and it was fired! Fire and flames raged in all directions. Blood coming down like rain, - sieges of Delhi,
revenges of Plassey, massacres of Cawnpore, and the Sikandar Bagh of Lucknow! Thousands of heroes are fighting - and dying; cities are burning. Kumar Singh comes, struggles, falls; the Moulvie comes, struggles, and falls; the throne of Cawnpore, the throne of Lucknow, the throne of Delhi, the throne of Bareilly, the throne of Jagadishpur, the throne of Jhansi, the throne of Banda, the throne of Furrukabad, five thousand, ten thousand, fifty thousand, a lakh of swords, flags, banners, generals, horses, elephants - all are coming out out after another, move about in the turmoil of the raging fire! Some are ascending one flame, some another; they poise themselves a while, reel, fight, fall down unseen! Everywhere battle and thunder-storms! A veritable volcanic conflagration this! And the pyre, flaming near the cottage of Gangadas Bawa, is the last and the most lustrous flame of this raging volcanic conflagration of the War of Independence of 1857!
