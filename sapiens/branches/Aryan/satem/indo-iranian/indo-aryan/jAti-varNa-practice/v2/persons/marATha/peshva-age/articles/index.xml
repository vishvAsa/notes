      <description>&lt;details&gt;&lt;summary&gt;विस्तारः (द्रष्टुं नोद्यम्)&lt;/summary&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Even in 1770s, bandits and crime ran rife in Bengal subah. Zamindars actively colluded with them.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;These are the same pindaries that ravaged territory when Raghuji Bhonsle marched in.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/details&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The system of police as we have described it was broken down before the English came into power in the districts of Bengal. Nothing can be more eloquent or more convincing than the fact that the gang-robbers, of whom the English had a terrible experience, were marauders, not by individual choice or necessity, but by ancestral calling.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Source: Kal_Chiron&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There is a story associated with Madhavrao Peshwa. He was 16, had just became Peshwa of a pan Indian empire in peril. He had just lost his elder brother (Vishwas Rao), his uncle (Sadashivrao Bhau) on Panipat. Had lost his father (Balaji Bajirao). Story happens in this backdrop&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Once he was returning to his residence from the court. There was a servant (from household of Peshwa family - one who’s job was to carry water from the wells to fill all the residential water tanks of shanivar vaDa - called पाणक्या in Marathi, dunno English/Hindi name) around. So while young Peshwa was on his way to his home from court, this “पाणक्या” stops him and tells the Peshwa (with all due respect etc), that his pagDi is not straight but tilted. He then (unasked for) straightens the pagDi of Peshwa and says to him - now it looks good.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

In 1754, in the civil war safdarjung was ousted as wazir and ejected from delhi by ahmad shah relying on rohilla and maratha armies.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Writing in the 1870s, Tukoji Rao Holkar II of Indore declared that India had been &amp;lsquo;a vast heap of stones&amp;rsquo; till the British put each piece &amp;lsquo;in the right place&amp;rsquo;&amp;rsquo;. On the face of it this was slavish language, and yet.. in internal correspondence, Raj officials described Holkar as a man of &amp;rsquo;notorious&amp;rsquo; disloyalty who &amp;lsquo;in every possible manner&amp;rsquo; gave them &amp;lsquo;persistent opposition&amp;rsquo;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Some of this stemmed from his air of grandeur: a newspaper wrote of how he &amp;lsquo;swagger(ed)&amp;rsquo; about was &amp;rsquo;lost in his own greatness&amp;rsquo;, and was full of &amp;lsquo;pride &amp;amp; self appreciation&amp;rsquo;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
