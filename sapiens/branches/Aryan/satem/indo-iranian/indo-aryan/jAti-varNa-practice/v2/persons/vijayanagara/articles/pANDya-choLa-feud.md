Another story. When Krishna Raya was ruling, the Chola country was ruled by Virashekhara Chola and Pandya country was ruled by Chandrashekhara Pandya. But, Virashekhara invaded Pandya country and ejected the Pandya out. The Pandya went to Vijayanagara and petitioned Krishna Raya. Krishna Raya chastised Nagama Nayaka as the Tamil Country was under his mandate, how did things go this bad? And he asked Nagama Nayaka to take an army personally and fix the things. He told that the Chola country will have to be annexed into the royal territory and order should be restored in the Pandya country. 

Nagama Nayaka went, defeated the Chola and chased him away, removed the Chola garrisons in the Pandya country and while he was restoring order, Chandrashekhara Pandya went to Krishna Raya again saying "while you ordered Nagama Nayaka to seize Chola country to the royal lands, he occupied both Chola and Pandya countries and is keeping them to himself". The Raya was angry. He sent a note, "I sent you to the Pandya country to restore order and not for you to become the king. Install the Pandya on the throne and return".

With this, Nagama Nayaka went ballistic. His reply reads thus.

> "I spent too much trying to restore order in these villages. This Pandya even after fully knowing he can't restore order in these places never came to you. But now, he saw not just destruction of the Chola but also restoration of order in his lands. He always said you keep everything, just give me some food and clothes to you. Now, he sees an opportunity and is greedy. Even so, what happens? If the kingdom is given to him, you don't even get your tribute.
>
> On the other hand, calling him a Pandya itself is a shame to the word Pandya. He is of low caste. Born to a servant. Because he doesn't deserve the kingdom, the Chola chased him away. 
> 
> Because we are afar, we didn't know all these things. I served you for a very long time. What's my mistake in asking for a few days of rest? That besides, I spent vast amounts of money to bring the province under control. I am not going to come till I am able to recover my money back."

An angry Krishna Raya asked, who is ready to go and chastise Nagama Nayaka. Nagama Nayaka's son Vishwanatha, the Emperor's betel bearer stood up. 

Krishna Raya: Are you taking my permission to go and join your father?  
Vishwanatha Nayaka: I am living on your money. The work of the master is more important than father.  
Krishna Raya sent him with 2000 horse and 6000 infantry on Madura. Vishwanatha Nayaka sent a word to his father, "the Raya asked me to bring your head. Don't bother. If you surrender Pandya country even now, I will get you pardoned."

Nagama Nayaka replied, 

> "Both of us conquered many kingdoms for the Raya. Not just that I restored areas which were lost two to three times. How much ever you try, that credit should go to me. For the Raya, how does it matter to him if the son of a servant didn't enjoy the Pandya country and how does it matter if we enjoyed it? You were born after praying to many gods. You are my only son. Why do you want to fight me for no reason? And more importantly, what I did is only for you".

Vishwanatha Nayaka's response was thus.

> "Because you betrayed your king, neither are you my father nor am I your son. The kingdom which you worked hard, I don't even want that. If you capitulate, I will take you to the king and ask for a pardon. And if you want to fight me, the god won't give you strength to win. I have promised myself that I will place you before the Raya come what may. I won't even think you are my father.

Nagama Nayaka was sad.

> "I prayed hard to Lord Vishwanatha to give me a son and I get a son who is ready to fight with me. Whether he lives or dies, this son he decided to come to fight with all his strength."

A severe battle happened and Nagama Nayaka was captured. Vishwanatha Nayaka was relieved. "My prayers are fulfilled that you are captured alive." He placed his father on his own howdah and sent a message to Krishna Raya.

> "Maharaja, didn't you tell, attacking Nagama Nayaka is an impossibility, and anyone who does will only die? But didn't you see Vishwanatha Nayaka achieve the impossible?"

Hearing of this, the Raya and the court was happy. After ten days, Vishwanatha Nayaka reached Vijayanagara.

When Krishna Raya asked Nagama Nayaka why did you betray me, Nagama Nayaka replied,

> "Your father assigned the Pandya Country to my domain and from then on, we were always in losses. Not just that, when you asked me to defeat the Chola king and restore the Pandya lands, we lost even more money. And when I worked hard to defeat the Chola and was about to make the Pandya the ruler, the Pandya said, 
> 
> > "Had it not been for you, we would never have defeated the Chola. Order wouldn't have been restored for ever. Even now, there is complete anarchy - everyone enjoys his villages not heeding me. While it is true that the Chola seized my lands, the reality is that even he wasn't able to restore order. You defeated my enemy. That is more than enough for me. 
> >
> > That besides, I didn't have any successors. All the sons I have are born to concubines. Till I am alive, give me the respect for my position and give me food and clothes, and rule the kingdom but don't give it to the Chola." 
> 
> At that time, these lands were in complete anarchy. I spent heavily to restore order. And seeing things restored, he comes to you complaining."

And then, he told the effort which he put in, and details of the money he spent. The Raya summoned the Pandya and said to him, 

> "You are respected and aged, we believed your words and sent an army. Is Nagama Nayaka telling the truth?" 

The Pandya replied in affirmative.  
The Raya was angry but Vishwanatha Nayaka restrained him. Then, the Pandya said, 

> "I appointed Vishwanatha Nayaka as my successor and I am not going back on that word. If you make Vishwanatha Nayaka the ruler of the area, I am happy."

The Raya said to Vishwanatha Nayaka, "Without caring for your father, you attacked him and brought him back as a prisoner, for your loyalty, I will pardon your father". 

Vishwanatha Nayaka took his father back home, apologized to him and both were reconciled.
Nagama Nayaka said to his son,

> "I wanted to see you on a throne ruling your own country - that's why I accepted what the Pandya said, and not for any other purpose. My work here is done and I will spend my time praying. What else do I need? By the way, take all the money I earned. The Raya will anyways give you the Pandya country. Rule it wisely."

Vishwanatha said, I don't want the money you earned. Spend it on charity. Nagama Nayaka said, 

> "I prayed that long and hard to gods to get you, this is the minimum I can do for you." 

And then showed to his son, what he earned. A shocked Vishwanatha Nayaka said he didn't understand how you earned that much.

Nagama Nayaka said to his son, "In Madura, in the Pandya country is the shrine of Meenakshi Sundareshwara. She is a live deity and came to me in a dream one night and said, "Your son Vishwanatha Nayaka is the most eligible one to stay in Madura and rule this country."

Then he said to his son to take the money and renovate the temples in the Pandya country and spend money on charity in his name.
After some time, the Raya summoned Vishwanatha Nayaka and the Pandya and said to the Pandya, 

> "You have one son from a keep but not a successor. You have given in writing that it is fine for Vishwanatha Nayaka to succeed you. do you still stand by that?"

The Pandya said, 

> "I don't want that country. Even if I ask for the country, the Chola will not allow me to live. Not just that. The Pandyan lines which emerged out of keeps and concubines are still ruling from Srivilliputtur, Tenkasi and Rajapalyam. They won't allow me into their domains. Nagama Nayaka subdued every place but five - the rulers of their place are the Pancha Pandyas. They were enemies to me and if you don't give the kingdom to the Chola and the Pancha Pandyas, and if Vishwanatha Nayaka rules the lands, I am more than happy. He is like my father now in protection. For my entry to Swarga, he is like my son".

And then, the Raya sent Vishwanatha Nayaka to the Pandya Country as it's ruler.
