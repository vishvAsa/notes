Sir Jadunath Sarkar lived to 88 and had a very prolific life as a historian. 

He wrote 21 books (some with multiple vols), ~425 papers, 100+ magazine articles, besides several obscure Persian manuscripts that he published — in addition to many collaborative/co-authored/forwarded works where he helped other historians.

A stickler to punctuality, routine and  discipline, he used to wake up early and was in the habit of finishing large part of his writing before dawn. 

He never drank alcohol nor did he smoke. He did not even take tea or coffee, except occasionally.

He was also a strict vegetarian. Despite most of his family being non-vegetarian, he made it a point to not eat fish or meat.

He regularly exercised too. In his Bengali self-reflection ‘Smṛti o Anubhava’ he says - শরীরের উপরে নিয়ন্ত্রণ থাকা উচিত - one must maintain control over the body.

He made a policy not to comment publicly on contemporary politics, and not get close to politicians. In private he was certainly critical of Gandhi/Nehru as well as Bose. In a letter to RC Majumdar he says tellingly on what he thought of these people and where they would take India. 

Towards the end of his days, he was very troubled mentally and financially because of untimely tragic deaths of his two sons, one daughter and two sons-in-law — all in quick succession. In advanced age of 80+ he and his wife were caring for their many parent-less grandchildren.
