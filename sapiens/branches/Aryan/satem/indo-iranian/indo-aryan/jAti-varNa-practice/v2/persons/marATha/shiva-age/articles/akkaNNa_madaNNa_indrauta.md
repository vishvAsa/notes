In what can be earliest nationalist criticism of Muslims for possessing dual loyalties; Akkanna, one of the Brahmin brothers who rose to power in the Qutbshahi Sultanate, bashes the Afaqi & Dakhani nobility of Golkonda for always seeking lands they consider Holy or their home. Akkanna's accusation came during his interview with a Dutch East India official, after the brothers found about the sultan and the Persian envoy's plan to help the rebellious prince Akbar, instigated by the Marwari Rajputs, with money and transportation to Iran.

Madanna and Akkanna started their career in Hyderabad, working for Sayyid Muzaffar, until the latter was put under house arrest by the newly enthroned Abu'l Hasan Tana Shah. Madanna soon replaced Sayyid Muzaffar and became the sultan's main representative. Madanna quickly rose to power due to his ability to set the declining state's finances in order; though never holding the title of Peshwa, he managed to gain control over the affairs of the state and the sultan himself. Over time they grew so powerful, the king was pensioned off.

Under the tenure of Madanna-Akkanna, Brahmins gradually replaced Muslims from the bureaucracy; though the main point of contention between the two factions was their attitude towards war with the Timurids. The Brahmin lobby believed in paying them off instead of fighting.


Huge amount of money was sent to Aurangzeb in order to avert an inevitable war. Akkanna was even appointed as general, to crush any pro-war sentiments, though Akkanna had "never seen a battle except in painting." A cousin, Rustam Rao, too was appointed to high position in army. The policy didn't work as when the Timurid army under Aurangzeb's son Mirza Mu'azzam besieged Golkonda, the brothers fled to a fortress, where they were killed by some slaves under the orders of the previous sultan 'Abd Allah's wives.


The day they were killed, riots broke out, targetting Brahmins associated with the govt. The violence was finally put to an end by Abu'l Hasan. Interestingly, the brothers weren't entirely hostile to Muslims, as they enlisted the support of Dakhani Muslims against the foreigners.


Also, it seems Madanna-Akkanna weren't Telugu, but Marathiâ€”& most probably Deshastha Brahmins; which isn't surprising given their stronghold over the bureaucracy of SI kingdoms. Purniah, the diwan and close associate of Hyder Ali and then Tipu Sultan was a Desh Brahmin. Under Purniah, Deshasthas monopolised Mysore's bureaucracy. The former continued to exercise significant power even after Tipu's death; locked in struggle with the restored Wodeyars, provoking rebellions. After his death, Deshasthas were gradually replaced in favour of Tambrahms.
