> Tamilians owe a special thanks to Chhatrapati Shivaji. When he learnt that the famous Shiva temple at Tiruvannamalai had been demolished and a mosque built over it, he went over and promptly demolished the mosque and restored the temple to its full glory.

Thanks to Marathas many temples in the Chola belt were saved from plunder and invasions.  

Chatrapati Sivaji Maharaj’s descendants protected many ancient Chola temples including the Sri Brahadeeswara temple and Sri Thiagaraja Swamy Temple, Tiruvarur.  Chidambaram Sri Nataraja was taken to Tiruvarur Temple for protection and remained there for decades. 🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼
   

The solid Gold Kamakshi who came with Kanchi Sankarachariar to Thanjavur was enshrined in a new temple by Maratha King Shri Pratap Singh Bonsele in 1760 CE. The Kanchi Mutt later moved to Kumbakonam and remained there till it relocated back in Kanchipuram.
