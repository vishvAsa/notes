## Aundh
This dvivarna controversy was actually rooted in the fight between kolhapur darbar and pant pratinidhi of aundh darbar. Former even killed one of the latters rulers in the past. They claimed that Aundh were not even proper broms. Aundh retaliated by claiming that kolhapur rulers were not kshatriya. Personal feud led to this rift between Brahmins and kshatriyas of MH.

## shivAjI Coronation
Nothing in early maratha bakhars show any such opposition to shivAjI's coronation by brahmins. In fact some of the marathas who were with sultanates opposed his claim. Brahmins were ok with sacchudra kings. Nayakas were very much supported by Brahmins and vice versa. Same with reddy kings.
