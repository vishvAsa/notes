## INTRODUCTION. 
The following work is a History of ie Family of the Mysore Pradhans. It has be repared out manuscript histories of the times written about the beginning this century and earlier, and private documents and letters in e possession of the family. Such of the documents as have an portant bearing on the history herein narrated are printed in e form of an appendix. 

M. A. SREENIVASACH.  
M. A. N. VAYANG 

It cannot be ascertained with any degree of certainty at what period of the Christian era the family of the Mysore Pradhans settled in the Karnata country, or whence they came there. At any rate this much is certain, that Ananthachar, son of Keshavachar, from whom the Mysore Pradhans trace their descent, was born in the year 1053 A. D. in the village of Kirangur, situated at a distance of about two miles to the north-east of the present site of Seringapatam. 

### Ballala
In the year 1117 A. D, in commemoration of his conversion to the faith of Vishnu, king Ballala Vishnu Vardhana Raya of Yadavapuri, the modern Thondanur in the Seringapatam Taluk, conferred upon Anantachar and other Brahmins a Jaghir of eight townships on the banks of the Cauvery (Astagram). 

The demolition of the Ballala capital of Dwarasamudra in the year 1326 completely crippled the power of the Ballala kings, and hence the Jaghirs given by king Vishnuvardhana were occupied by the Poligars of the neighbourhood. 

### Sreerangaroy
About 1380, Sreerangaroy, a relation of the king of Vijayanagar occupied the fortress of Seringapatam, and ruled there as the Viceroy of the Karnata Province of jayanagar. Shortly after, the King of Vijayanagar conferred twentyone villages in the Mandya and Attikuṛ l'aluks in Jaghir on Govinda raja Wadayar, a descendat of Anantachar. The Wadayar, in ... of time became the Guru of the Viceroy. 

After Govindaraja Wadayar, his brother Tirumaliengaria succeeded him as Guru to the Viceroy. In the year 1420, the Viceroy Tirumalroy, grandson of Srirangaroy, was forced to abandon his territories and fly for his safety, on account of war and internal dissensions. 

The Guru Tirumaliengaria then exerted his best to protect the interests of Vijayanagar as far as possible, and finding the flight of the Viceroy inevitable in the then condition of affairs, offered the viceroyalty to the neighbouring Wadayar of Mysore on certain conditions, and placed him in possession of Seringapatam in the year Plava Chaitra Suddha, corresponding to 1421 A. D. 

The Guru then left for Vijayanagar with the Viceroy Tirumalroy, got the nomination of the Mysore Wadayar ratified by the Maharajah of Vijayanagar, returned to Seringapatam, and handed over the Khilats and Sannad of the Maharajah to the Wadayar. The Wadayar, in appreciation of these important services of Tirumaliengaria conferred upon him several Jaghirs. 

In course of time, owing to the decay of the power of Vijayanagar, the Jaghirs granted to Govindaraja Wadayar and Tirumaliengaria were occupied by others. 


In the year 1516, Govindaraja Wadayar Junior, a descendant of Govindaraja Wadayar Senior, became the Guru of Krishnaroy, the Maharajah of Vijayanagar, and obtained from him in Jaghir five villages, including Mandya. 

### Raja Wadayar
In the year 1608, Raja Wadayar, the ruler of Mysore, occupied the Fort of Seringapatam, and found it expedient to obtain the sanction of the Maharajah of Vijayanagar to continue to rule over the fortress. Tirumaliengar Junior, a descendant of Govindaraja Wadayar procured for him this sanction; and in appreciation of this service, the Rajah conferred upon him a Jaghir and appointed him his Pradhan, (a sort of privy Counsellor placed near the person of the Rajah for the general purposes of the Government.) 

### Kantirava Narasaraja Wadayar
In the year 1659, Kantirava Narasaraja Wadayar, the ruler of Mysore, died without issue. A Council of the officers of the state was held at Seringapatam to nominate a successor. 

Pradhan Appajiah, alias Govindarajiah, son of Pradhan Tirumaliengar, supported the cause of Doddadevaraja Wadayar, cousin to the preceeding Rajah, and used his influence to such advantage as to procure his nomination. From this time forwards, the Pradhans grew to gain in influence and power even more than before. 

## Chikadevaraja Wadayar
In the year 1672, Doddadevaraja Wadayar was [[8]] succeeded by his son Chikadevaraja Wadayar, who had for his minister Vishalaksha Pundit. The Pundit having been murdered by the Lingayats in the year 1686, the Raja offered the ministership to Pradhan Appajiah. But the Pradhan thought fit to recommend his daughter's son Tirumaliengar to the post, and got him nominated. 

Tirumaliengar was a man of rare talents and ability, and during his time the kingdom of Mysore reached the summit of its prosperity. The king while on his deathbed entrusted his infant son Kantirava Narasaraja Wadayar who was deaf and dumb to the care of his Minister Tirumaliengar and his Pradhan Appajiah, and breathed his last in 1704. 

The Pradhan and the Minister placed Kantirava Narasaraja Wadayar on the throne, and administered the state in his name for a period of five years thereafter, within which they both died. 

## Immadi Krishnaraja Wadayar
In the year 1759, Puttammanny, the wife of Immadi Krishnaraja Wadayar died. Pradhan Govindarajiah, the grandson of Pradhan Appajiah, arranged the king's marriage with Lakshmammanny and Devajammanny, which was duly celebrated. 

## Hyder
In the year 1762, Jyeshta Bahula 3rd of Vishu, Hyder, an adventurer of low rank and great ability, who was rising by degrees in power and influence in the state, completely usurped his master's kingdom. 

In 1765, the reputed wealth of the family of Pradhan Govindarajiah attracted the attention of the usurper. Hyder sent his men to plunder the Pradhan of his wealth. The Pradhan who had it all secretly buried, refused to give it up. In the persecution that followed, the Pradhan was strangled to death. He left behind him two sons Tirumal Row and Narayan Row. 

## Lakshmammanny & Peshva
Shortly after, Immadi Krishnaraja Wadayar, the king, also breathed his last. Maharanee Lakshmammanny, a very able and intelligent lady that she was, could not reconcile herself to the fallen condition of the Rajahs and the usurpation of Hyder. She, in union with her friends and adherents like the Pradhans, set about concerting plans to get rid of the Mahamadan usurper and regain her kingdom. A secret embassy was sent to Peshwa Madhava Row in 1771 for this purpose. 

## Kadapa
Hyder suspected Pradhan Tirumal Row to have been privy to it. He therefore arrested and imprisoned him in 1772. When he led an expedi tion towards Bellary and Gooty in 1775, he released Tirumal Row from prison and took him along with his camp, lest Tirumal Row should do any mischief to his cause if left in his absence in Seringapatam. Hyder then made Tirumal Row Resident at the Court of Abdul Halim, the Nawab of Kadapa, and left him there. 

## Lakshmammanny and English
In 1776, Maharanee Lakshmammanny again attempted the overthrow of Hyder, and this time turned to seek the assistance of the English to carry out her purpose. As early as 1760, she had sent Rayadurg Srinivasa Row on an embassy to Lord Pigot, Governor of Madras, requesting him to aid her in the overthrow of Hyder, and the Governor had promised his assistance. But owing to the machinations of Mahamad Ali, the Nabob of the Karnatic, the English had done nothing further in the matter. 

The Maharanee learning that Lord Pigot had again returned to Madras as Governor and restored Tanjore to its native ruler, deputed her Pradhans Tirumal Row and Narayan Row on an embassy to the English for the purpose of procuring their help. The Pradhans after the most solemn promises of ample reward for their services from the Maharanee embarked on this difficult and dangerous mission and left the Province for Madras. On communicating with Lord Pigot, they regretted to find that he was then under custody on a false charge of insanity. But he expected to be released and restored to his office as Governor in the course of a year. And meantime he requested them to go to Tanjore, and there await his reinstatement to office. He also wrote to the Rajah of Tanjore recommending the Pradhans to his special care and protection. 

They then went to Tanjore and after a few months learnt to their great disappointment of the death of Lord Pigot at St. Thomas Mount. They communicated to Maharanee Lakshmammanny their failure so far in effecting anything, but were determined to wait their opportunity for negotiating their business with the English. They continued to reside in Tanjore and enlisted the sympathies of the Tanjore Maharajah in their behalf. 

### 1782 treaty
In 1780-81, Hyder invaded the Karnatic, and the first Mysore war with the English commenced. Lord Macartney assumed charge of the Government of Fort. St. George on the 22nd June 1781, and sent John Sullivan as Resident in the court of Tanjore. Through the influence of the Rajah and the Rev. Schwartz, a celebrated Danish Missionary, and one William Burke, the Pradhans introduced themselves to John Sullivan and through him communicated their business to Lord Macartney. They worked so successfully that an engagement was come to between them and John Sullivan, the terms of which were embodied in a treaty dated 18th October 1782. (Vide app. A.) They required in addition certain guarantees from the Governor of Madras (Vide app. B.) which was accordingly given (Vide app. C.) Lord Macartney also wrote a letter to Maharanee Lakshmammanny assuring her of the restoration of her kingdom (Vide app. D.) in reply to a letter of hers delivered to the Governor by Pradhan Narayan Row. 

After the conclusion of the treaty, in order to guide the English army in its march upon Seringapatam, through the Gajjalhatty pass, the Pradhans collected 300 horse, and went with Col. Lang and his army towards Karoor. Karoor was captured on the 2nd April 1783, Vijayamangalam fell on the 6th April, and Dindigal surrendered on the 4th May. Col. Lang gave place to Col. Fullarton, who captured Palghat, Dharapuram and Coimbatore. 

### Conspiracy
About this time, the Pradhans while trying to get the British army to march on Seringapatam,had also arranged with their friends there a conspiracy which had for its object the overthrow of Tippu's Government. Subraj Urs and Narsing Row directed the conspiracy in Seringapatam, and with the aid of 3000 Jetties, Mahrattas &c who were for the Rajah's cause, it was arranged that they should occupy the Fort, seize the treasury and capture every Mahamadan. The 28th July 1783 was fixed for this purpose. Anche Shamiah undertook to destroy Tippu and his men who were at Mangalore at the time. 

Just while the conspirators were getting ready for the attack on the night of the 28th July, Killedar Syed Mahamad who commanded the [[6]] Fort discovered the conspiracy, arrested some of the conspirators including Subraj, and put them to death. 

The Killedar at once reported every thing to Tippu. Tippu had also meantime ascertained the open alliance and active service of the Pradhans with the English army. He therefore ordered the arrest and imprisonment of all the relations of the Pradhans and Subraj Urs &c., including men, women and children to the extent of 700 families.

700 persons as per other accounts. Includes Subraj Urs's relations - so not just brAhmaNas.

They were chained with heavy irons and thrust into the dungeons of Seringapatam. Pradhan Narayan Row was also captured and imprisoned, but he soon managed to escape and join his brother. 

Tippu on his return to the capital ordered a wholesale massacre of these 700 families, and had them mercilessly put to death by one means or another. He also confiscated the Jaghirs and other property enjoyed by the Pradhans and their relations. 

### Retreat to Tanjore
The English were obliged to make peace with Tippu, and the treaty of Mangalore was concluded, 11th March 1784. Sullivan and Lord Macartney regretting such a termination of the war, however promised their support to the cause of the Pradhans at a more convenient opportunity. The Pradhans retired to Tanjore to watch the course of events. The English conferred a pension of twenty pagodas per mensem upon the Pradhans, in conformity to the 12th article of their treaty with them. John Huddlestone, who succeeded John Sullivan as Resident in the Court of Tanjore, considered the pension quite inadequate, and placed on record his regret at his inability to get it increased. (Vide app. E.) 

At Tanjore, Tippu tried to capture Tirumal Row clandestinely. Tirumal Row secretly fled to Travancore and sought and received protection at the hands of its king. After a stay of two years there, he returned to Tanjore and lived with his brother. 

In 1789, Tippu invaded the kingdom of Travancore, a state in alliance with the English, and thus broke the peace as agreed to in the last treaty. The English prepared for war against Tippu in consequence. The Pradhans saw their opportunity again. They offered their services to the English in the campaign, provided the English agreed to rostore the kingdom to the Hindu Rajah in the event of Tippu's defeat. They got the Rajahs of Tanjore and Travancore to recommend their cause to the English. 

They also wrote to Sullivan and Lord Macartney in England, requesting their promised support. Genl. Meadows, whose sympathy in the cause of the Pradhans was enlisted by Lord Macartney and other English officers arrived at Madras and assumed charge of the offices of the Governor and Cominanderin-chief on the 20th February 1790. 

Shortly after, he went to Tanjore where the Pradhans paid him a visit. They were received with great respect and guns were fired in their honour. The Pradhans represented to him their cause, presented to him a letter from their Maharanee, and requested him to enter into treaty with them. 

### Coimbettore
The General assured them that he would do everything in his power to advance the interest of their Maharanee in the ensuing war, but regretted he could not enter into any direct treaty with them, as he had to consult the Nizam and the Mahrattas who were his allies in the war. He also wrote a letter to Maharanee Lakshmammanny promising her his best assistance and handed it to the Pradhans for delivery to her (Vide app. F). The Pradhans, satisfied with these assurances of General Meadows, agreed to serve under him in the campaign. 

Accordingly they collected a force of 100 horse and 2000 foot, and accompanied the General. The General, in company with the Pradhans who were with him supplying provisions for his army, marched towards Karoor and captured it on the 15th April. He next occupied Vijayamangalam and took Dharapuram, 10th July, Tippu hearing of the arrival of General Meadows retreated with his army to Seringapatam, previously destroying the fort of Coimbatore and driving the inhabitants of the District with their cattle to the hills and forests around. 

Meadows occupied the deserted town on the 21st July, and found it necessary to repeople the country and get the lands brought under cultivation, as the conquest would otherwise yield no revenue to him. Meadows forced upon Tirumal Row the office of Amildar and Manager of the District to do the needful in the matter immediately, until a Collector could be got from Madras. Tirumal Row whose only object was to march with the army against Seringapatam did not want the place. But the General would take no refusal from him. 

Tirumal Row with his characteristic zeal and ability soon got together some officials, opened a cutcherry at Coimbatore, and recalled and repeopled the country. He advanced large sums out of his private funds to the ryots in order to induce them to settle and cultivate their lands, as they had been thoroughly impoverished by the plunders of Tippu. 

Coimbatore was again fortified and garrisoned, a hospital opened for the accommodation of the army, and large supplies collected. Tirumal Row rendered himself useful to the English in other ways as well by supplying spies &c,. (Vide app. G). In appreciation of these services of his, General Meadows conferred upon Tirumal Row an allowance of 100 pagodas per mensem for his particular expenses, 

Meanwhile the Pradhans ascertained that Tippu descended the Gajjalhatty pass with 20,000 horse and 40,000 foot, with intent to seize the English detachment under Colonel Floyd at Sathiamangalam. They reported this to the General, who at once wrote to the Colonel of it, asking him to be ready to receive Tippu, and telling him that he would also march for his relief. 

The General went to Vellady and there learnt that engagements had already taken place between the Colonel's detachment and Tippu's army on the 13th and 14th September which had resulted in the defeat of Tippu with 4000 of his men killed and several thousands wounded. The wounded among the English were sent to the hospital recently opened in Coimbatore, and the Pradhans did everything in their power to relieve their sufferings. 


Tippu next marched towards Trichinopoly through Karoor intending to cut off the supplies to the English which he learnt they were receiving from there. The General pursued him. Tippu therefore changed his course and marched towards Dharapuram, which he captured on the 8th October. The General covering the supplies from Trichinopoly did not return to Coimbatore till two weeks longer. 

Meanwhile Tippu learning at Dharapuram that Tirumal Row was at Coimbatore, marched towards the place with his immense army with intent to seize him. He sent a spy, Singree by name,to ascertain the strength of the garrison of the Fort. Singres entered the Fort in disguise, noted all he wanted to know, and reported to Tippu that there was only one officer with 100 troops, that there were 2200 men with Tirumal Row under his own staff, and that they had no ammunition. 

### Battle at Coimettore
Tippu highly pleased to find that Tirumal Row was within his easy grasp hastened towards the place and arrived at Sukkara Krishnapuram in the neighbourhood, The inhabitants of Coimbatore ran away to the hills and jungles at the approach of Tippu's army. The Pradhans resigning themselves to the will of the Almighty prepared for a brave defence, in the face of Tippu's whole army. By the grace of God a heavy downpour of rain began to fall and continued for three days unintermittently. Notwithstanding, Tippu did not abandon his project, but waited for the rain to stop. 

Meantime a detachment of 2000 troops stationed at Nanjnad, and whom the General had ordered at the commencement of hostilities to go to Coimbatore, arrived in the vicinity in the heavy rain. The Officers Colonel Wahab and Captain Knox finding to their dismay Tippu encamped close by with his whole army, and not meeting their General, asked Tirumal Row to suggest what to do. Tirumal Row regarding the arrival of the English Troops as a godsend, represented to the officers that Coimbatore was a safe and strong place and that he had abundant provisions there, and asked them to go to the Fort and there await the arrival of the General, which they accordingly did. Tippu hearing of the arrival of reinforcements to Coimbatore, gave up his intentions against Tirumal Row and marched against Maxwell towards Cauverypuram. 

The General soon after returned to Coimbatore escorting provisions from Trichinopoly, and learning of the state of affairs marched towards Cauverypuram for the relief of Maxwell, Tirumal Row and his men accompanied him leaving one Puttiah to act as Amildar at Coimbatore till he would be relieved by a Collector from Madras. The General joined Maxwell on the 17th November. Tippu retreated towards Srirangam. The General pursued him, and arrived at Mannachanallur on the opposite bank of the Cauvery.[[10]] 

Meantime Corbett had been sent from Madras as Collector to Coimbatore. On assuming charge of his office, he found it necessary to procure the assistance of Tirumal Row to manage the affairs of the District. He therefore wrote to him to the General's Camp requesting him to return to Coimbatore. Tirumal Row consulted the General as to whether he should go back leaving the army. The General told Tirumal Row to go and assist Corbett, and also instructed him to collect large supplies and take them to Seringapatam, where, he said, he would soon go with Lord Cornwallis, the Governor-General, who had just arrived at Madras to assume the direct command of the army. 

### Corruption
TirumalRow left the camp and joined Corbett at Coimbatore, in January 1791, who thereon carried on the management of the District in conjunction with Tirumal Row. 

In the course of the inspection of accounts Tirumal Row found 10,000 pagodas missing from the treasury. He traced it to Puttiah's dishonesty, and got him arrested and placed in custody pending his trial therefor. As Puttiah was very intimats with Corbett, the latter released and took him to office, and put Tirumal Row in prison on the same charge in June 1791. 

The Collector held Tirumal Row responsible for a defalcation which occurred during his absence from the place while Puttiah was in charge of the District. Puttiah deeply resenting Tirumal Row's conduct in having exposed him exerted his best to crush hip. 

Pradhan Narayan Row at once proceeded to Madras to petition the Board of Revenue on the unjust treatment accorded to his brother, and procure redress. He wrote two petitions to the Board in June and July 1791. 

Meantime Tippu's army descended the pass of Gajjalhatty on the 16th July with four guns, and all the inhabitants of the Coimbatore District ran to the hills at its approach. Corbett made ready to leave the Fort, but insisted on leaving Tirumal Row there in custody. Puttiah was bent on getting Tippu's horse into Coimbatore in order to hand over Tirumal Row to them. Tirumal Row already in prison on a false charge was thus in imminent danger of being made over to Tippu who sought his life at every opportunity. Narayan Row again petitioned to the Board for succour [[11]] to save Tirumal Row, especially as Tirumal Row was commissioned to procure supplies for the army and was otherwise materially useful to the Company. (Vide app. H.) The Board ordered Tirumal Row's immediate release and asked him to be sent with an escort to Madras. Puttiah got Tippu's horse to lay in wait on the road to capture Tirumal Row. Tirumal Row by taking a different aud circuitous path escaped from Tippu's men. Tippu's horse soon after attacked Coimbatore and captured the Fort. Lt. Chalmers who was there was taken prisoner and sent to Seringapatam. Later, Tirumal Row was honourably acquitted of this baseless charge against him. 

### 1792 teaty
Lord Cornwallis laid siege to Seringapatam in 1792, in company with his allies the Nizam and the Mahrattas. Tippu sued for peace feeling himself beaten at every point. Cornwallis agreed to enter into treaty with him. General Meadows who had all along the course of the war the cause of the Mysore Rajahs at heart protested against this with the (overnor-General, and wanted to capture the Fort and restore the old and legitimate Rajahs of Mysore to their kingdom which had been usurped by Hyder. (Vide app. I.) The Governor-General would not listen to him, and peace was made with Tippu, 19th March 1792. General Meadows retired to his tent highly grieving and disappointed. 

We cannot refrain from mentioning an incident in this connection which shows how deeply the General had espoused the canse of our Rajahs and hated the treaty with Tippu. He was ordered to receive Tippu's sons who would come as hostages to the camp. He did not obey. An altercation ensued between him and the Governor-General. General Meadows shot himself with his pistol and fell fainting. Colonels Harris and Floyd wrested the pistol from his hand, medical assistance was procured, the wound which was not very serious was dressed up, and the General soon recovered. 

Shortly after, Meadows returned to Madras. Tirumal Row paid him a visit at Poonamallee. The General was highly pleased to meet him again, enquired about his health, and recounted to him how he had fought for his cause with the Governor General, how the latter would not hear of it; how he had shot [[12]] himself in anger, how he regretted he was unable to advance the interests of the Maharanee whom he had assured of his best support and who depended entirely on him &c. &c., and with at sigh the noble General showed Tirumal Row the scar on his body left by the wound of his pistol-shot. 


Tirumal Row moved to tears on hearing the General thus express himself replied, 

> "If the blessing of God had been upon us, why should the Kingdom of our sovereign have gone to the hands of the Mahamadans? Leaving the land of my birth and the possessions of my forefathers, to support the cause of our legitimate sovereign, I have been reduced to the condition of a wandering beggar on the face of the earth. All my relations have been murdered and I am plunged in an ocean of sorrow. 
> 
> But when I think of how you went to the extent of well-nigh killing yourself in support of our cause, and your recovery from so much danger to your life, I esteem my self most fortunate in this world. If you continue to cherish the same feelings of goodwill towards us, we shall rest assured that in times to come at least you will restore our kingdom to our sovereign." 

Meadows said in reply 

> “ You need not be sorry. I shall even if I retire fight for you before the authorities in England, and get your object fulfilled.” 

Shortly after Meadows returned to England, and was there raised to the Peerage as Lord Meadows, for his services in India. 

### Hobart
On the 7th September 1794 Lord Hobart arrived in Madras as Governor. He had previously heard of the Mysore Rajahs and their Pradhans from Lord Meadows and other friends of theirs in England. Soon after his arrival, he therefore sent for Tirumal Row, promised him his support, and asked him to keep communicating with his Secretary Webbe everything he could learn of Tippu and his affairs from Seringapatam. He also offered to pay Tirumal Row any expenses he would incur in keeping up the secret communication with Seringapatam. But Tirumal Row, while promising to do everything in his power to watch over Tippu's movements and report to him, refused to receive any remuneration for such services, but required the restoration of the Rajahs to their ancient throne. Tirumal Row was keeping up a secret correspondence with Maharanee [[13]]Lakshmammanny ever since he left Seringapatam and could therefore learn everything of Tippu's affairs even to the minutest details from a lady at once distinguished for her talents, ability and zeal in her cause. Tirumal Row in compliance with the wishes of the Governor used to communicate every informatian he gathered to Secretary Webbe. 

In 1796 Maharanee Lakshmammanny traced Tippu's intrigues with the French, and sent Tirumal Row a copy of his proposals to the French together with an interesting letter of (Vide app. J.). Tirumal Row informed Lord Hobart of Tippus proceedings, who reported the matter to the Governor General.  

The pension of twenty pagodas enjoyed by the Pradhans was deemed very inadequate from the beginning and John Huddlestone, Resident of Tanjore, it has already appeared, placed on record his regret that he could not get it increased. In May 1796 the English found it feasible to enhance the pension, and accordingly raised it by 100 pagodas per mensem to better support the Pradhans as per terms of the twelfth article of their treaty with the English entered into in the year 1782. 

Early in 1797 Tippu again began to intrigue with the French, and this time sent an embassy to the Isle of France along with a French sailor Ripaud, with the intention of procuring a large French army to drive the English out of India. Tirumal Row reported this to Lord Hobart'who wrote to England about it. Lord Mornington was appointed Governor-General of India and left England on the 17th November 1797. He arrived at the Cape of Good Hope in February 1798. He there met Lords Macartney and Hobart who recommended to him the Mysore Pradhans and their cause. He next arrived at Madras on the 26th April 1798. He sent for Tirumal Row. 

As the Pradhan's wife had just died, he was not able to go. Messrs. Webbe and Close were therefore sent to him at his home. They explained to him that the new Governor-General was come there fully prepared to cripple Tippu, and consulted with him on his latest reports from Seringapatam.

After performing his wife's obsequies, Tirumal Row also paid a visit to the Governor-General.[[14]] 

On the 26th April 1798, the day on which the Governor General landed in Madras, Tippu's ambassadors to the Isle of France also returned and landed at Mangalore with 99 Frenchmen. They were welcomed to Seringapatam, where the Frenchmen founded a Jocobin Club, planted the tree of Liberty, surmounted with the cap of Equality, and on the public parade hailed the Sultan as citizen Tippu. In these republican forms the Sultan cordially concurred. 

These proceedings were fully communicated to the Governor-General. He at once prepared for war against Tippu. The Governor-General also arrived in Madras on the 31s Dec. 1798 to superintend the equipment of the army personally. 

Tirumal Row had been for years past urging his claims for the arrears of his monthly allowance of 100 pagodas which had been discontinued between 1791 and 1796, as well as for the expenses he had incurred in supplying provisions for the army during the last war. The claims of Tirumal Row were referred to General Harris for his opinion, as he had a personal knowledge of Tirumal Row's services. The General wrote to the Board of Revenue strongly recommending the claims of Tirumal Row in a letter dated the 22nd Jan. 1799 ( Vide app. K) which the Board duly approved and sanctioned on the 25th January 1799. (Vide app. L). 

## Victory
General Harris marched against Seringapatam from Vellore on the 11th February 1799. On the 4th May, he captured the Fort by assault, when Tippu was killed. Thus ended n usurpation founded in treachery, supported by violence and destroyed by folly. 

Maharanee Lakshmammanny had as early as the beginning of the campaign written to Lords Mornington and Clive, the new Governor of Madras, requesting the restoration of her kingdom, (Vide app. M.) and had her letter duly presented them by Pradhan Tirumal Row. On the 16th April Webbe had replied to her letter addressed to the Lords (Vide app. N.). As has already appeared, through the exertions of the Mysore Pradhans, “between the British Government and the Royal Family of Mysore, an intercourse of friendship and kindness had subsisted [[15]] "*in the most desperate crisis of their adverse fortunes," and "the restoration of the Family was a subject of serious political consideration in every war in which the English had been engaged with Hyder Ali or his son." $ 

And hence, the Governor General had made up his mind as to how he should deal with Seringapatam in the event of its conquest. And as soon as he heard of the capture of Seringapatam, and the death of Tippu, the Governor-General sent for Tirumal Row, communicated to him the glorious result of the campaign, and told him he would restore the kingdom to his legitimate sovereign, and appoint him Minister of the State. 

The Pradhan finding his exertions for the restoration of the Royal Family and the overthrow of a tyranny which had baffled the strength of the greatest European power for the last thirty years, bear fruit at last, could not contain his unbounded joy. The Pradhan thanked the Governor-General in the highest terms on behalf of his Maharanee, and complimented the English nation on their heroism, sense of justice and generosity. 

The Pradhans next proclaimed the victory by beat of drums in Madras, and distributed sugar in cart-loads to the inhabitants. The next day Lord Clive in an interview with Tirumal Row told him that the Kingdom would be restored and himself made Prime-minister, and asked Tirumal Row to meet him and Lord Mornington at Krishnagiry in a few days, prepared to proceed thence to Seringapatam with the Governor General. 

\* Wellesley's Despatches. Vol. II. page 81. ŞA Review of the last Mysore war, with a Dedication to Henry Dundas by Colonel M. Wood H. r., printed in 1800 in London, page 26.

Tirumal Row at once proceeded to Krishnagiry. He thence wrote to Maharanee Lakshmammanny informing her that the Kingdom would be restored to her heirs and that he would be made Prime-minister. The old Maharanee was full of gratitude to her Pradhans, who had thus brought to such a successful termination their arduous mission of twenty-four years' duration She was highly delighted to hear of the intended restoration [[16]] after all her sufferings for so long. She wrote to Tirumal Row thanking him in the most complimentary terms for all his services, and asking him to go to Seringapatam at once ( Vide app. 0). While Tirumal Row was waiting at Krishnagiry, the Governor-General abandoned the idea of going to Seringapatam. Webbe wrote to Tirumal Row informing him of it, and asking him to go and present himself before the Commission appointed at Seringapatam for the settlement of Mysore. He also sent Tirumal Row a letter addressed to General Harris which he desired Tirumal Row to present to the General, and upon which, he said, the General would confer upon him the Ministership. 

Tirumal Row left Krishnagiry and arrived at the British Camp outside the Fort of Seringapatam twenty days thereafter. He delivered Mr. Webbe's note to the General. The General asked Tirumal Row to stay in his Camp till he would settle his affairs. 

## No prime-ministership
The case of Tirumal Row was placed before the Commission and was fully considered by them. Meantime the early disclosure by Maharanee Lakshmammanny of the intended restoration of her grandson and the nomination of Tirumal Row to the post of Prime-minister had put the officers of Tippu on the alert to ingratiate themselves into the favour of some of the officers of the Commission, and to promise to serve the new Government faithfully to their satisfaction. And hence, while they 

> "admitted Tirumal Row's right under his treaties with the Maharanee and his engagements with the English to be appointed Prime-Minister, they deemed it inexpedient to nominate him just then. They told him that having been long absent from the Mysore country, he might not possess that thorough and practical knowledge of the present state of its local resources and other minute particulars,  
> which Purniah had been presumed to command in consequence of his long and unremitting residence in the country, and his having held offices of importance under Tippu Sultan and his father;  
> that the disorganized and unsettled condition of the country then newly conquered rendered that knowledge, though otherwise of secondary consequence, an indispensable qualification in any one [[17]] who should be placed at the head of its affairs at that crisis; that inasmuch as it was believed that the early tranquillisation of the country chiefly depended upon the said knowledge, they wished he would unite with them in promoting the peace and order of his country from the administration of whose affairs he was not however to consider himself as either totally or long excluded; that in the meantine they would recommend to superior authorities to make a handsome provision for him besides the grant of some present (meaning a Jaghir)." 

Under the above circumstances, Tirumal Row was requested to return to Madras. He agreed to do so, but asked for permission to pay his respects to the Maharanee who was inside the Fort, before leaving. It was however deemed necessary that he should not visit the Maharanee and the permission was not granted. He then wrote to Her Highness of his having to return to Madras and of his regret at his having been unable to take leave of her in person. 

Just about this time the Commissioners wanted the Maharanee to remove to Mysore with her grandson Krishnaraja Wadayar, where they wanted to install the infant Rajah. For three days the Maharanee did not leave the Fort grieving that she could not even see her favourite Pradhan who had worked so zealously for her and was close by. The Pradhan hearing of this and fearing further delay on her part might endanger the interest of his Sovereign, at once wrote to the Maharanee asking her to comply immediately with the request of the Commissioners. On receipt of this she replied to Tirumal Row sending him a letter addressed to Lords Clive and Mornington in which she protested against the appointment of Purniah and wanted Tirumal Row for the Dewanship instead (Vide app. P.). 

Tirumal Row thereafter returned to Madras, his conduct on this occasion receiving even greater commendation than all his past services at the hands of his old friend Mr. Sullivan, the retired Resident of Tanjore (Vide app. Q.). 

The Maharanee soon after receiving Tirumal Row's last letter left for Mysore with her grandson where he was installed as Maharajah Krishnaraja Wadayar on the throne of his18 ancestors on the 30th June to the immense delight of the people of Mysore. 

After his return to Madras, Tirumal Row petitioned to Lord Mornington in respect of his claims on the Mysore Government. The Governor-General recommended his services to the Court of Directors in England (Vide app. R.), who placed him in point of allowance on an equal footing with the officers of the late Tippu Sultan, distinguished by the title of Meer Meeran, paying him 3,500 pagodas per annum from the Mysore Treasury, in addition to his other pensions of 120 pagodas per mensem (Vide app. S.). 

The Maharanee who had yet hopes of seeing Tirumal Row return to Mysore, also wrote to Webbe asking him to intercede in Tirumal Row's behalf. He however regretted he could do nothing in the matter, and exhorted her to yield to necessity (Vide app. T.). 

## Deaths
Narayan Row breathed his last in the year 1811 and with the death of Tirumal Row in 1815, the pensions drawn by the family from the British Government as well as from the Mysore State were discontinued. 

During the minority of Maharaja Krishnaraja Wadayar, Tirumal Row, son of Pradhan Narayan Row, found it expedient to serve the British Government, and held the post of Head Sheristadar in the Collectorate of Trichinopoly. In the year 1815, Maharaja Krishnaraja Wadayar sent for him, appointing him Dewan of his Kingdom. Accordingly he arrived at Mysore, but before assuming charge of his office, was poisoned to death. +++(5)+++

The important services rendered by the family of the Pradhans to the kingdom of Mysore from 1421 to 1799 a. d. have thus far been traced, and especially the work of Pradhans Tirumal Row and Narayan Row, which involved a sacrifice worthy of being recorded by Huddlestone, Resident of Tanjore, (Vide app. E.), and Lord Mornington, Governor-General of India, (Vide app. R.), and elicited the special commendation of Maharanoe Lakshmammauny (Vide app. O.). 

Nevertheless from untoward circumstances such as the disappointed retirement of [[19]] Pradhan Tirumal Row from Seringapatam in 1799, the unfortunate and abrupt demise of his nephew Tirumal Row in Mysore in 1815, &c., the noble achievements of the family have faded out of the popular memory, and its later history is such as deserves no special mention in a brief sketch like the present.

Hyder Naik has usurped all our master's country, and killed him and his two sons, putting their families in confinement. This is the way he has acted treacherously. The British know well that Hyder was only a servant of our master. If the British will defeat the usurper and restore our kingdom to our master, we will enter into the following conditions.

12\. If the English should fail to defeat Hyder Naik and his troops or make peace with him, the Company then ought to maintain and provide for us, as well as our families in perpetuity, and also protect all people who may join with us. The Company should also return to us such moneys as might then have been advanced by us on account of our Ranee for the purposes before mentioned.

(Abstract Translation from a copy of a letter addressed to John Sullivan by the Pradhans.) 

TO ME. JOHN Sullivan,  
We, Mysore Tirumal Row and Narayan Row, state as follows,-Yourself and His Highness Tuljamaharajah were good enough to negotiate with Lord Macartney a treaty on our behalf for the overthrow of Hyder, and the restoration of our kingdom as before. You now desire us to accompany the English army, get the countries captured, and render such other assistance as may be needed for the army. It is now six years since we left our country, and already we have spent out of our private funds 35,000 pagodas. If we accompany the army, we shall also have to retain a force, and spend a lot of money. Our sovereign is in prison and we cannot expect any help from that quarter. If the Governor of Madras execute a treaty with us promising not to interfere with the administration of the kingdom after restoration, or with any grants the Ranee might give, we shall freely spend out of our pocket without demanding any pecuniary assistance from the Company, and serve the Company to the utmost of our ability standing in open hostility to the enemy (Hyder). You should help us in bringing about the fulfilment of the three promises of the Mysore Maharanee, without any interference on the part of the English, viz, the recoupment of all our expenses, the grant of a commission of 10 per cent on the revenues of the State, and the conferring the Ministership upon us and our descendants in perpetuity.

COMPANY'S SEAL.  
Tirumal Row and Narayan Row, Vakeels to Her Highness Lakshmammanny, Ranee of Mysore Narapatikartar, having [[23]] applied to Mr. Sullivan for recovering possession of the country usurped by Hyder Ali, a servant of the Ranee, he was, after looking into the papers and documents produced by the Vakeels, satisfied that the Ranee and her partisans would assist the British in their undertaking to confer peace upon the country usurped by Hyder. As Hyder is giving much trouble to the Company and their allies, it is resolved to invade the country on all sides and to get the Taluks restored to the rightful owners. As a guarantee that the Taluks thus recovered will not be occupied by the Company, the members of the same communicate through their representatives their following resolutions in this case. In the event of the British taking possession of the country or any part thereof with the assistance or co-operation of the Ranee or her partisans, the same will be given away to the Ranee or the rightful owners, and all the expenses which the British Government will be put to for employing the necessary force to recover the country and such further charges as might be necessary for the Ranee in maintaining a subsidiary force for the protection of the country, should be borne by the Ranee; no presents whatever being accepted by any officer in the civil or military employ. In case it is found necessary to make peace with Hyder, the Company will, on no account, deliver to the Sultan the Vakeels, Poligars and those who join the British in this undertaking, and, on the other hand, they will have the protection of the Company in the Company's Taluks. If Hyder continues to rule over the Mysore Kingdom, the Company will return to the Vakeels, Gumastas or the Ranee whatever money they might advance to the Company for the expenses of the war. Mr. Sullivan has received instructions to transact the business of the Company in the South and is instructed to arrange these matters with the aforesaid Vakeels. He informed us of the execution of the treaty dated 28th October 1782, drawn according to the representation of these Vakeels and witnessed by Mr. Schwartz, and we have approved of the said treaty subject to the confirmation of the Governor of Bengal in Council.

(Abstract translation of an original Persian and Muhratta letter from Lord Macartney to Maharanee Lakshmammunny.) TO HER HIGHNESS The MahaRANEE, 

God bless you. I received the letter you sent with Narayan Row, and have noted its contents with pleasure. I have been always anxious to serve your interests. The ingratitude and injustice of Hyder to your Royal family are publicly known to everybody. It has become a matter of necessity not only for us, but for others also, to punish him for his misdeeds. I write this in accordance with the treaty with you. If God blesses the efforts of the Company, it will be seen how your rights will be respected. We also count much upon the services of Tirumal Row and other such intelligent noblemen on your behalf. And hencə you may rest assured your Kingdom will be restored to you. Hyder has declared war against us and our allies through enmity. We shall therefore necessarily invade his territories from all quarters. And by the grace of God we will restore to the rightful owners those territories which Hyder has occupied by fraud and force. The English and the Company will see to this with special care. And we shall always do what is just and upright. The Ranee and her partisans should join the Company in this noble work. And there is no doubt that good will result in every way.

Among the disbursements I find a charge of twenty pagodas per month for subsisting the family of Tirumal Row the agent of the Rana of Mysore, who on behalf of his mistress made a treaty with Mr. Sullivan during the late war which was approved and ratified by Government. The twelfth article of [[25]] the treaty stipulates that "should it so happen that the Company may not be able to subdue Hyder Naik, but on the contrary that they should be obliged to make peace with him, in that event the Company must take us and all the people who may join with us under their protection, and continue the same to us and our families for ever, and further they must engage to pay back whatever money may be advanced to them on account of our Rana for the purpose before mentioned." The public faith has thus been pledged to the man, and he has sacrificed everything to his hope of subverting the present Mysore Government. * * * Were the Company's affairs in a more prosperous condition, I should not hesitate to recommend an increase of 
allowance. *

The repeated greetings of General Meadows, Governor of Channapatna;-Your letter was duly delivered by your Ambassador Tirumal Row, and I understood the contents thereof. God knows when Tippu may die and leave the country. Victory is God's grace. If he will enable us to restore the kingdom to the rightful rulers, we will indeed be very happy. We cannot now discuss about the distribution of territories. the Nizam and the Mahrattas are our allies, we cannot settle the point ourselves. It is right that you should bear the cost of the war, and it is also very good that you promise to pay prize

### J. tirumala to Lakshmammanny
(Abstract translation of a copy of a Kanarese letter written to Tirumal Row by Maharanee Lakshmammanny about the year 1796.) 

We have been writing to you of our affairs from time to time. It is twenty-two years since you left the Province. We are daily being persecuted by Tippu. We cannot say at what moment he may send assassins and get us murdered. 

And for the restoration of our kingdom you have been exerting your best, winning the sympathies of English Sirdars in our favour, entering into treaties with them, &c. and at what an amount of sacrifice and suffering! For our sake 700 families - your kith and kin have been allowed to be ruthlessly murdered, all your immense wealth has been spent and you are a ruined person. 

And all along it has also been our greatest anxiety to see our kingdom justly administered, with you as our right hand in Seringapatam, and our pious gifts to Brahmins and Temples rightly upheld, and thus leading a holy life under the sacred influence of God Sreeranga, end our days in quietness and peace. But while we note the projects of the Mahamadan tyrant, we despair of our life. 

For we now learn that the French Vakeel at the Court of Tippu has been strongly advising him to put us all to death, as we may possibly one day be the cause of his ruin. We have now sent along with this a copy of the treaty which Tippu has lately made with the French. If you show this to the Governor of Madras and get him to invade the country with a large army before the arrival of French assistance to Tippu, it will save not only us, but the English also. But if on the contrary there be any vacillation as on the two or three previous occassions, Tippu and the French will unite like fire and air, and the whole country will be ruined. Please to tell the Governor and the English there that if they may not care for us, at least in pure self-defence in order to preserve their own safety, they must put down Tippu at once before he gets French aid, 
30 

Under the circumstances, you will see, our life is quite uncertain, and even if we are no more, as you are the best wellwisher of the state you should keep exerting your best, see Tippu destroyed, and get a member of the Royal Family placed on the throne, and administer the country without infringing in the least the wishes of the English and always with an eye to justice and truth, and maintain our pious and charitable institutions, taking your own share of the revenues as per our treaty with you, and acting justly in a manner that our soul may rest with satisfaction in the other world. 

If however it should happen by God's grace that we should also be alive, and the English conquer Tippu and restore us our kingdom, we shall pay the expenses of the English army to the extent of one crore of Pagodas. And for this they must abide by the terms of our old treaty with Sullivan and Macartney. You should communicate all this to the English and get the army to march at once. And it cannot be timed to arrive here at a more opportune moment. 

For Tippu is acting here in the most foolish manner. He does not know who are bis best friends, and who his worst enemies. And hence he has lost control even over his own army. He has no good military officers. And every body here is wishing for his discomfiture, and he is very unpopular. By whatever way the army may come now, it can have ample supplies and good water. 

If you will therefore exert your best now without delay with your usual zeal, ability and intelligence, I have no doubt that God will second your efforts and give us victory this time. Please reply to this immediately. Day and night we have been thinking of you alone. As for further particulars, the Brahmin bearers of this will explain.

### K. Harris minute
(Copy of a minute of Lieutenant General Harris, dated the 
22nd January, 1799.) 

I have perused the several papers referred to me on the subject of Tirumal Row's demand on the Company and 
81 
although I am strongly disposed in favour of this person on account of the public benefit derived from his services in the Coimbatore country at the commencement of the war in 1790, I shall not attempt to elucidate a mass of accounts and papers of accusation and defence which the Revenue Board, after an investigation of years, was obliged to pronounce to be inexplicable. It was originally imagined that Tirumal Row from his talents, his knowledge of the Mysore country, his connection with the ancient family of Mysore and the negotiations which he had conducted on their behalf with this Government, might have the means of being useful if he proceeded with the Army in the field; and under this idea, he was brought to Camp when the troops commenced hostilities by entering the Coimbatore country in June 1790. When the Army reached Coimbatore, they found the place had been recently evacuated and the inhabitants of the Pettah and surrounding districts driven off with their cattle and property to the neighbouring hills. As supplies of grain and cattle were wanted for the troops and followers, and proceeding to obtain them by means of plunder, would not only have been ruinous in the end, but might have in great part failed of success, the measure of putting Tirumal Row in charge of the Country as manager on the part of Government with a fixed salary appeared the most eligible that could be adopted. He was therefore consulted on the subject. His wish was to proceed on with the army. The appointment however was conferred on him in a temporary manner, and Government requested to appoint a Collector to relieve him as soon as circumstances would permit. In entering upon the charge, his first care was to recall as soon as possible the principal revenue servants who had been recently in Tippu'« employ. After some enquiry he succeeded in opening a communication with Puttiah, who when hostilities commenced, had been a Peshcar in the Revenue Department at Coimbatore. By means of this person and some others whom he managed to conciliate, Tirumal Row soon re-established a regular Cutcherry at Coimbatore, in consequence of which the inhabitants returned from the hills to their houses, the business of cultivation was recommenced, and supplies of cattle and grain were collected in 
32 
abundance for the use of the troops. It was now determined to occupy Coimbatore, which was accordingly garrisoned, and a general hospital established in it for the accommodation of the Army. Part of the troops proceeded shortly after against Dindigul and Palghautcherry, whilst other detachments were employed in forwarding supplies along the Cauvery to Sathiamangalum. At this time Tippu doscended into the Coimbatore country, and as in October the army had occasion to pursue into the Baramahal, Tirumal Row was permitted at his earnest solicitation to accompany the troops, having left Puttiah at Coimbatore as renter of the several districts. The army never returned to Coimbatore, but during its absence in the course of the year, on the banks of the Cauvery and in the Baramahal, the garrison was well supplied, and Colonel Wahab who commanded the place, obtained supplies of cash from Puttiah sufficient to answer all his demands. In December 1790 Mr. Corbett arrived at Coimbatore as Collector of the Province, under the appointment of Government. He was desirous of being joined by Tirumal Row that he might inspect his accounts and have the benefit of his assistance, and Tirumal Row accordingly quitted the army and repaired to Coimbatore. 

The transactions which afterwards passed between the two parties are set forth (but not without difference) in the several papers which have been submitted to Government. Tirumal Row certainly showed no reluctance to join Mr. Corbett for the purpose of giving an account of his management, and it is much to be lamented that on his arrival at Coimbatore, Mr. Corbett did not refrain from employing him in any situation of trust, until he should have satisfactorily closed his accounts, and still more, that Mr. Corbett should have confounded Tirumal Row's management with that of Puttiah, and espoused the cause of this person on a matter at issue between the two parties. Had Mr. Corbett stood as an examiner between both, and keeping their accounts distinct and apart held each responsible according to their separate trusts, that inexplicable confusion which has been the occasion of so much trouble would in great measure have been avoided. 
33 
Under the extreme perplexity which has occurred, it appears to me that Mr. Corbett's charges against Tirumal Row are vague and futile in the extreme. Although the latter cannot be entirely excused in not having kept more accurate accounts, much will occur in his behalf, on adverting to the circumstances under which he entered on the employ. The nature of the conjuncture was such as not to allow of his receiving particular instructions for his guidance. When he joined the army, he could not have formed any idea of his being employed as manager. When he took charge, the country was almost totally deserted. He had brought no revenue servants along with him. He was not only obliged to depend on strangers, but had to court their assistance, and detach them from an interest that was decidedly hostile. His management did not last three months. Some part of the interval necessarily elapsed before he could establish au office or enter upon the business of his appointment, and from the day that he was nominated, the situation which he held was difficult and invidious. 

I have already said that i cannot pretend to examine into the merits of Tirumal Row's demand involved as it has been in matter that is scarcely to be unravelled. His exertions, however, were particularly useful to the public cause while the army continued in the province of Coimbatore. By his means the inhabitants were restored to their homes, their property secured, and the troops amply supplied. As I have ever viewed him as a person of respectable character and talents, as he has been subjected to much fexation and expense in vindicating his conduct against numberless unfounded accusations, and as from motives of interest also he must be firmly attached to the Company's Governmen 

I would recommend that he should receive the arrears of his allowance of 100 pagodas per month which was discontinued in 1791, and such further compensation as Government may think he deserves.

### L. Harris minute
(Copy of an extract from the minutes of consultation in the Revenue Department of Government dated the 25th January 1799.) Read the following minute of Lieutenant General Harris, 
(quoted above as appendix K.) 
The Board concur in the sentiments of Lieutenant General Harris upon the case of Tirumal Row, and it is accordingly resolved that the arrears of his allowance at the rate of 100 pagodas per month be paid from the month of June 1791 when it was suspended until the 6th of May 1796 on which it was restored. 
In regard to the compensation which is recommended for the loss sustained by Tirumal Row, the inexplicable confusion of the accounts leaves the Board no criterion by which to fix the amount; but as they are fully convinced that some loss was sustained, that the treatment he received from the Collector of Coimbatore was most unmerited and unjust, and that his exertions for the public service at an important period of the war entitle bim to the further favour of the Company, 
Resolved that it be recommended to the Honourable Court of Directors to grant him a sum not less than 3,000 pagodas in lieu of all demands whatever.

### M. Lakshmammanny to Clive
(Abstract translation from a copy of a Kanarese letter written by Maharanee Lakshmammanny to Lords. Mornington and Clive.) 
TO THEIR EXcellencies LORDS MORNINGTON AND CLIVE, ORNAMENTED WITH EVERY NOBLE QUALIFICATION, SALLAM OF LAKSHMAM
MANNY,

In times of yore, providence bestowed upon our elders the Raj of Mysore, and got it administered by us with justice and wisdom. Of late our servant Hyder Naik growing in power usurped our territories, and put to death our Lord [[35]] Consort, our childreu, our relations and all our dependents. He plundered our palace four several times, and with the help of the wealth thereby acquired conquered other countries, and committed ravages throughout slaying mercilessly and without cause ryots, poligars and other persons by thousands. Finding it impossible to bear his oppressions any longer, and considering the English nation highly virtuous and upright, and as such their friendship very much to be coveted, and sure to yield much good in future, we sent an embassay to the then Governor of Madras through Mahamad Ali Khan (Nabob of the Karnatic) in the year Pramathi (1760. a. D. ) Certain negotiations followed, as recorded in our letter to the then Governor. Later in the year Durmukhi (1776. a. D.), relying on the promises of the illustrious Lord Pigot, we sent our Pradhan Tirumal Row. 

Unfortunately the Governor could do nothing, as he was himself involved in trouble. And in the year Subhakritu,(1782) Lord Macartney gave us ample assurance of our restoration, and hence we got together many of our adherents. 

Just on the eve of our capturing Tippu and recovering our kingdom, our object was disclosed to Tippu, and consequently he put to death 700 families from amongst our relations as well as those of Tirumal Row, including men, women and children. 

You are also aware of the events that transpired in the year Sadharana (1790) in the times of General Meadows and Lord Cornwallis. After the late treaty, under the advice of the French, Tippu has caused the death of the Rajah, plundered the palace, and placed us in rigorous custody in a separate house. While in this state, we learn that you have been sent to this land specially to restore us our kingdom. Besides we have also heard of your great nobility of character, and purity of heart, and placing implicit faith in you seek your protection and aid. And hence with your usual goodness, considering the claims of justice, and with an eye to God and everlasting fame, you should root out the enemy, and restore us our kingdom, according to the conditions of our last treaty with you. We shall pay you a crore of star-pagodas for the expenses of the war. We have also written to our Pradhan Tirumal Row in greater detail, and he will tell\* 36 you everything. As he is our best friend, whatever is said or done by him on our behalf shall have our fullest approval, and you may consider them as completely ratified by us. 

As we are in the hands of the enemy, we cannot count upon our life. Should it so happen that we are no more, with the assistance of this our Pradhan Tirumal Row, we request you to establish the Raj with justice, and acquire fame for all times to come. Requesting the pleasure of your valued reply &c.

WITH COMPLIMENTS FROM J. WEBBE TO MAHARANEE 

Narapati MatHOSRI RANA SAHIB, 
The three letters you seut, one to me, one to His Lordship of Bengal, and one to His Lordship here, your Pradhan Tirumal Row delivered, which gave us much pleasure. 
Your Pradhan Tirumal Row has for a long period continued to give us every information respecting you, and their Lordships solemnly promised to serve you, which your Pradhan must have mentioned to you; you may rest assured that there will be no end to our friendship. We have now declared war against Tippu. But we know not what will be the result. God only knows it. I cannot write much in that head, and after it be over they will without doubt attend to your business.

Respects to ouR TIRUMALACHAR,— 
By the blessing of God and the Brahmins, we have been doing quite well up to date, the 2nd of Jyeshta Suddba. (the 3rd June 1799.) Please to keep us informing of your welfare from time to time.

We have understood everything from your letter sent with Jatavallabha Singriengar. Your efforts so far, living in a foreign land for 24 years, and suffering so much on our account, all for the sake of justice and patriotism, have now borne fruit. To such a wise man and great friend of ours as you are what inore are we say in a letter like this? Even the services of Tirumaliengariah in times of yore cannot hear comparison to what you have done now. The great good you have done to the state now has brought you everlasting fame, which will last as long as the sun and moon endure. And in future, we shall only abide by your acts, and shall have nothing to say against them. It is impossible for us to express the fulness of our gratitude for your invaluable services by means of any letters. It shall only be after we meet personally and talk to each other that we shall be fully pleased and yourself made to understand everything completely.

### P. Lakshmammanny to Lords Clive and Mornington
Abstract translation of a copy of a Kanarese letter written by Maharanee Lakshmammanny to Lords Clive and Mornington.) 
You are already aware of all our affairs through our Pradhan Tirumal Row. Being unable to put up with the tyranny of the Mahamadan usurpers, and hearing of the nobility and prowess of the English Company, and of the fame of their extending their protection to many a Principality, we sent our Tirumal Row to Channapatua twenty-four years ago. You know perfectly well of every thing that transpired from that time up to date as to our negotiations with you, and the promises of restoration made by the Governors and other English Sirdars. You have now overthrown the tyrant Tippu by the strength of your virtue and heroism, conquered the country, and extended the glory of your achievement throughout the length and breadth of the land. As you always espouse the cause of justice and truth, you have been pleased to favour us, and order your Sirdars here to restore us our kingdom. To thank you for this*38 act of yours, and express our gratitude to you, words will not suffice. Our gratitude to you for what you have done for us now cannot be forgotton even after death. 
And now your Sirdars here have made up their minds to entrust the conduct of the administration to the officers of the late Government, and hence we urge the following to your Excellencies' consideration. We had in the very beginning promised to confer the Ministership upon our Tirumal Row, and on the faith of this our promise his strenuous exertions with the Company for the past 24 years are well known to you. We never paid him even a single pie for his expenses. And in addition many dependents working on our behalf under the late tyranny were completely ruined, and reduced to poverty and misery. And you will grant it is but fair and just that we should provide for them. 
And hence as you have been good enough to restore us our kingdom, please to allow us also to administer it in the manner that suits us best. We have already promised this our Tirumal Row to appoint him and his heirs our Ministers in hereditary succession, to grant him 10 per cent of the revenues of the state, and also to pay up all his expenses It is therefore our request that you will be pleased to permit ns to keep our promise.

### Q. Sullivan to Tirumal

(An original English letter written by John Sullivan to 
TRIMUL ROW, 
Tirumal Row.) 
CHESTERFIELD STREET, LONDON, 
8TH MARCH 1800 

I have received your letter of the 31st July 1799 and am very thankful to you for doing me the justice to consider me as your sincere friend. I have read with a great deal of attention the recital you make in that letter of your proceedings from the first opening of the negotiation with me at Tanjore until 
39 
your return from Seringapatam in July last, and I have grea satisfaction in assuring you that your conduct appears to me to have been uniformly regulated by the warmest zeal for the interest of your Mistress the Rana and by good faith and attachment to the English Government. 
It would have given me the greatest pleasure to have heard that your long and faithful services had been recompensed by your having been placed under your Rana in the situation that would have been most agreeable to you. But as circumstances with which I am not acquainted have opposed such an arrangement immediately upon the restoration of the Rajah's Government, you have had an additional opportunity, of proving your attachment by retiring from the scene, and of showing your judgment by relying on the justice of the English Government. 

I most earnestly recommend to you to continue in the same judicious course, and to place your whole confidence in Mr. Webbe and in Col. Close, whose honour, judgment and abilities are held in the highest consideration and for whom I feel a respect-equal to that which I bear towards my own brother, who is also your friend, and who will always give you the most honorable and candid opinion. 

You may firmly rely upon any service it may be in my power to render you. But as the Governor-General has the direction of all things, and as Mr. Webbe and Colonel Close have most deservedly the confidence of Lord Wellesley and of Lord Clive, you can derive material service only through their just representations ff your merits. Let me hear frequently of your welfare. What can I say more than that I am your true friend.

### R. Mornington on Tirumal Row
(Extract from a copy of the minutes of Lord Mornington, Governor-General of India, about Tirumal Row.) 

5753\. In the course of my correspondence with the commissioners for the affairs of Mysore, the Board will have observed the name of Mysore Tirumal Row. This person is well known to the Comany's Government in this part of India, and is 
40 
distinguished as well by his zealous and faithful attachment to the Family now elevated to the Musnud, as by the misfortunes which his negotiations on their behalf have brought on himself and his family. 
I lay before the Board an address from Tirumal Row from which the Board will observe that he has strong claims on the family of Mysore; and I accordingly propose that he be placed on a footing of entire equality in point of allowance with the officers of the late Government distinguished by the Title of Meer Meeran, and that his allowance be secured by the Company.

I am directed to inform you that the resolution of this Government for placing you in point of allowance on an equal footing with the officers of the late Tippu Sultan, distinguished by the title of Meer Meeran and who were promised under the treaty of Seringapatam, has received the entire approbation of the Honorable the Court of Directors, and that in addition to your allowance under that arrangement and to the monthly stipend which you will continue to receive from the Company, the Honorable Court has been pleased to direct the sum of 4,000 Pagodas to be presented to you as a compensation for all your demands on the Company, and as a recompense for your past 
exertions and services. 

As soon as the Governor in Council shall have been made acquainted with your acceptance of this gratuity, an order for its payment will be issued to the Treasury.

### T. Webbe to Lakshmammanny
(Abstract translation of an original Mahratta letter written by J. Webbe to Maharanee Lakshmammanny.) 
TO HER HIGHNESS SREE LAKShmammanny Sahib, Mother of 

Mysore Narapati Karthar, Mr. WebBE'S SALLAM, 
Your letter of 3rd Suddha Bhadrapatha, duly to hand, and I have noted the contents fully. We are very sorry to learm therefrom of the two sources of your grief. As you are very wise, you are perfectly aware that we will not succeed in all we attempt even in our ordinary affairs. It being so, in the multifarious affairs of a kingdom, we must perforce submit to necessity sometimes. 

After the overthrow of Tippu, the country was restored in consideration of our treaty with you. On account of your most unmerited sufferings at the hands of the late Tippu, you are all the more endeared to the two Lords, and they are anxious to treat you with the utmost consideration, and respect, for all times to come. I have fully recommended your views to Col. Close, and you may rest assured that he will do everything in his power to support them. I am also anxious to serve you as far as possible. You will have understood further particulars from Tirumal Row.
