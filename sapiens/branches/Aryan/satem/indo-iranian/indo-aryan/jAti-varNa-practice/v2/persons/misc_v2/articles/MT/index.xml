      <description>&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&#34;https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2004/03/09/the-brave-pancholi/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Ajayamerupura (known today as Ajmer) had always been a key center for the dominance of Hindustan. It was the home of one of the most famous Indian Vedic universities in north India during the reign of the Chahamanas. It was also the center of the famous temple of Brahma near the Pushkara Tirtha. After the death of Prithiviraja Chahamana at the hands of Shihabuddin Ghori, Ajayamerupura was attacked by the Mohammedans, and finally wrested by Qutub-ud-din. Having demolished the Vedic university and a series of Hindu temples he erected a grotesque structure termed the Adai Din Ka Jhopda- the shed constructed in 2 1/2 days. This was used as a mosque for the namaz of the Moslem conquerors. Since then it remained under Mohammedan control.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
