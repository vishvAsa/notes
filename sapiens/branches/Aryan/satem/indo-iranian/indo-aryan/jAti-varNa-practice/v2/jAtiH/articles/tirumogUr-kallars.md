When Yusuf Khan, also known as Marudu Nayagam, was in the service of the English, he and Colonel Heron undertook a southern expedition to collect taxes from the polygars. Kumaravadi polygar Lakshmi Nayak refused to pay the tax, following which British forces launched an attack. The local governor, Mayana, fled to the Thirumbur temple (present-day Thirumogur).

Yusuf Khan pursued him, but upon receiving news of Yusuf Khan’s approach, Mayana escaped from the temple. Colonel Heron, however, remained unconvinced. He, along with Yusuf Khan, proceeded to attack the temple. The temple gates were burned down, and the shrine was plundered. All the idols were taken away. The Kallars, who were the worshippers and protectors of the temple, were enraged by this act. 

When they demanded the return of the idols, a ransom of 5,000 rupees was demanded. Unable to raise the amount, they watched helplessly as the English troops departed with the idols. Yusuf Khan later claimed that he himself had burned down the temple.

The Kallars then regrouped and waited for an opportunity to retaliate. When Colonel Heron was returning from the expedition at a later date, the Kallars planned an attack on his garrison. 

Although the news reached Heron and he attempted to counter it by splitting his forces and sending them through the Natham Pass, the Kallars launched a determined assault, routed the troops, recovered all the idols, and reinstalled them in the temple.

Thus, they not only defeated the British forces but also restored Dharma by re-establishing worship at the temple. It is therefore entirely fitting that a memorial be constructed in honour of such selfless warriors.
