<p>We have undertaken this work of popular education with the
firmest conviction and belief that, of all agents of human civili###sation, education is the only one that brings about material,
moral and religious regeneration of fallen countries and raises
them up to the level of most advanced Nations by slow and
peaceful revolutions : and in order that this should be so, it
must be ultimately in the hands of the people themselves.</p>
<p>From the Statement of V. S Apte before the Hunter Com###mission (1882)</p></blockquote>
<p>Man&rsquo;s outlook of the world is necessarily dependent
upon his environments. Howsoever indomitable be
the individual will, it fails not to realise its limitations and
has to shape its course accordingly. Gifted though he
was with extraordinary ability, superabundent enthu###siasm and magnificent courage, the only outlet Mr.
Tilak found for his energies was the comparitively mo###dest field of education. He and his colleagues clearly re*
alised the complete hold which the alien rulers had ob###tained over the length and breadth of this vast country.
Howsoever much the British Imperialists might boast of
India&rsquo;s conquest by the sword, it has been fully and
freely admitted by Seely that in the willing acquiesence
of Indians in the British Suzerainty alone lay the great-</p>
<p>THE SCHOOL AND THE COLLEGE 2^</p>
<p>€St permancy of that rule ; and the Educational system
introduced into this country by the new rulers sought to
secure this acquiescence by capturing the will, the in###tellect and the imagination of the people. Educa###tion, thus is an instrument by means of which the Gov###ernment has sought to consolidate its power and perpe###tuate its authority. In self-governing countries where
the interests of the rulers and of the ruled are identical,
the education that is imparted is necessarily of a highly
ennobling kind. It kindles patriotism, refines senti###ments, strengthens moral sense and stimulates all the
latent powers of the soul. But the education, which
India has received during the last hundred years and
more has been quite of a different nature. It has
taught us to disbelieve our religion, disrespect our
social order and even to disobey our parents. It has
perverted our patriotism, has made materialistic our
outlook of life and by causing us to neglect our ancient
history and culture weakened our moral stamina and
all but broken our national back-bone. But this is not
all. The medium of the English language has put a
crushing biurden on our students. Add to this the men###tal isolation of those, who were appointed to fix the
curriculum and one can easily understand how the
hobby-horses of various Directors and Senators have
mined the youths of this country. Education, to be
useful must be in the hands of the Nation&rsquo;s chosen
leaders. Alien Bureaucrats and uns3mipathetic Mission
aries have no right to shape our mental and moral equip###ment. They would, no doubt encourage the produc###tion of a class of well-trained clerks, obedient, loyal,
■quiet, submissive and single-minded in the discharge o£</p>
<p>30 LOKAMANYA TILAK</p>
<p>appointed duties. But they would try their best to
discourage manliness, virihty and patriotism.</p>
<p>If these statements are not now regarded as parado###xical the credit is due, among others to Mr. Tilak and
his colleagues who started the New English School
Poona, on January ist, 1880. On the opening day,
only 19 students were enrolled. Within a couple of
months the school stood fairly on its legs and by the
end of the year the number rose to 336. By the end
of 1881, it was above 600 and in January 1884, it stood
at 858. The mangers of the school astonished the pub###lic by taking the very modest salary of Rs. 30 p. m.
though every one of them was competent enough, in
some other walk of life, to draw ten times as much.
Dr. Hunter, President of the Education Commission was
supremely satisfied with the wonderful spirit and solid
improvements introduced by Mr. Tilak and others and
has recorded (1882) his unreserved admiration in the
following words : —</p>
<p>&quot; Throughout the whole of India, I have not yet wit###nessed a single institution which can be compared with
this establishment. ^ * * This institution * * can
rival and compete with success not only with the Gov###ernment High Schools in the country, but may favour###ably compare with the schools of other countries also.&quot;</p>
<p>The question has been sometimes asked : ** How is it,
that in his attempts to nationahse education, Mr. Tilak
did not disdain to take Government grant ?&quot; The
answer is twofold. In the first place, Mr. Tilak did not
surrender any of his principles in availing himself of the
tax-payers* money through the Government. He did
not bend his knees before the high-handed conduct of</p>
<p>THE SCHOOL AND THE COLLEGE. 3 1</p>
<p>educational authorities*. He was not called upon to
obey Risley Circulars. Secondly, the difference between
the circumstances of those times and the environments
of to-day ought to be taken into consideration. To-day,
you must either submit to the whims or caprices of the
educational authorities or sever your connection with
them altogether. But in the early eighties Mr. Tilak
started his career with the hope of inducing the Govern###ment to transfer the whole of secondary education {and
College education, if possible) to popular control. He
regarded the spread of education as a preparation for
the national struggle. He saw that though the Bureau^
crats were not willing to entrust to the children of the
soil an iota of real political or military power, still they
could be persuaded to part with educational control if
we were persistent and enterprising enough. They
pretended to hold over political rights only because we
were not sufficiently educated. If pressed to educate us
quickly, they pleaded the wish but regretted the inabi###lity to do so on account of shortage of money. It was
the ambition of Mr. Tilak and his colleagues to so
cheapen, spread and improve education that the Govern###ment could not, without going back on their own words
reasonably refuse the transfer of secondary and col-</p>
<ul>
<li>In the critical days of 1897-8, the Deccan Education Society
had the misfortune of incurring the displeasure of the Bureau###cracy and had to submit to arbitrary orders of the Government.
This is not perhaps the only occassion when the Society felt
constrained to consider discretion the better part of valour
In justice, we may add that latterly, under the distinguished
Principalship of the Hon. Mr. Paranjpye, the D. E. Society has
shown admirable firmness on more than one occassion and has
refused to act against its conscience, merely to please ofiScial
vrhims.</li>
</ul>
<p>32 LOKAMANYA TILAK</p>
<p>legiate education to the people. This will explain why
he and his associates accepted such a low salary ; this
also will explain why he accepted the Government
grant. For some time, negotiations, informal no doubt,
were actually going on regarding the transfer of the
Deccan College to Mr. Tilak ai d his colleagues. But
the reactionary element in the Government at last pre###vailed and Mr. Tilak&rsquo;s hopes were completely shattered.</p>
<p>It is not to be supposed that the success achieved by
the New English School in an incredibly short time was
due to any accidental combination of favourable cir###cumstances. Far from this being the case, enormous
difficulties met Mr. Tilak on every side. The vested
interests that suffered raised a storm of abuse and mis###representation. The lack of public spirit made the
work of collecting funds very difficult. Money came
not in torrents but in dribblets. More formidable than
the scarcity of money, was the difficulty of getting
suitable men, willing to accept the work in true Jesuiti###cal spirit. The Kolhapur Defamation case, the sudden
death of Chiploonkar, the incarceration of Tilak and
Agarkar added to the difficulties. The patriotic fervour
of Tilak, Agarkar and Chiploonkar greatly impressed
even the green-eyed Times of India, which while recog###nising that the ambition of the founders of the New
English School was legitimate, was somewhat afraid
that this ambition was &quot; destined to have momentous
efiects on the future of India.&quot;</p>
<p>Mr. Tilak was the soul of this devoted band. Modest
and unassuming, he never loved lime-light. Though
most of the work of organisation fell on his puissant
shoulders still he never cared to figure as the Head.</p>
<p>THE SCHOOL AND THE COLLEGE 33</p>
<p>That honour he delegated to others. &quot; I Hke to work *&rsquo;
he said &quot; and never think of honours.&quot;</p>
<p>In school, he taught Mathematics and sometimes
English. His greatest difficulty was that he never found
it easy to adopt his teaching to the capacity of his pupils.
In this point Apte and Agarkar easily beat him.</p>
<p>Another pecuharity which distinguished him from
his colleagues was his supreme isolation from the lighter
moods of his students. Generally the most popular
teacher is he, who would occasionally find time to in###dulge in those digressions on current topics
which are the delight of students. Apte, Agarkar,
Gokhale, Bhanu and Gole, — all sometimes gave them###selves up to &quot; fun and frohc.&quot; Mr. Tilak however was
severely regardful of his lesson. Students could never
draw him out. Indeed, the attempt even was never
made by them.</p>
<p>And yet he was, not perhaps the most popular, but
certainly the most revered teacher. For him boys felt
that mysterious regard which genius and greatness
always evoke.</p>
<p>With teachers of first-rate qualifications and capa###city like Tilak, Apte and Agarkar, it is no wonder that
the results of the New English School at the Matricu###lation were exceedingly bright. The admiring citizens
of Poona were proud of these young Uons and felt bound###less confidence in them. Indeed, the New English
School began to be considered as the new centre of
public life and inspiration in Maharashtra. The school
of thought led by Ranade began to dwindle and its
brightness paled before the lustre shed by the heroes of
the New English School. No prophet was required to
3</p>
<p>34 LOKAMANYA TILAK</p>
<p>foretell that before the avalanche of these activities
Ranade&rsquo;s followers would be swept away.</p>
<p>It is not necessary to go into the various improve###ments made in the system of education by the founders
of the New English School. The utility and efhcacy of
these improvements has been tested by time. Before
1880, the distribution of History, Geography, Mathe###matics and Science over the different standards of
schools was arbitrary, unsystematic and unsuited to
young boys. Tilak, Apte and Agarkar made the neces###sary adjustment, which at that time provoked much
comment. They also insisted on the vernacular being
made the medium of instruction ; they discouraged the
use of English as much as possible. Special attention
was paid to the equipment which the students brought
to the lowest English class and as this equipment was
found to be very much below the normal — it is the
same even now — a Vernacular school was started with
the object of providing better intellectual material to
the English school and every care was taken to make
the instruction in the Vernacular school animated, more
systematic and less rigid. An idea of the crude educa###tional methods of those times can be had from the fact
that, when what is known as the &ldquo;Subjects System/&rsquo;
was introduced in place of the old system, it
was received in no friendly spirit and a storm of opposi###tion and criticism awaited an improvement which no
man in his senses thinks of condemning now.</p>
<p>It was impossible for Mr. Tilak and his colleagues to
rest content with the establishment of a successful
High School. Since the very foundation of the New
English School, Mr. Tilak had cherished the ambition</p>
<p>THE SCHOOL AND THE COLLEGE 35</p>
<p>of starting a College. Besides, he believed that the
establishment of a College would enable him to get
from its alumni the right sort of men, properly imbued
with the spirit of sacrifice and anxious like himself to
cover the Presidency with a net-work of educational
institutions. A preliminary meeting of the well-wishers
of the New English School was held and on 24th Octo###ber 18S4 the Deccan Education Society was formed
and an application to the University for permission to
start an Arts College was made. It is needless to
trace the slow developments of the College till 1890
when Mr. Tilak after eleven years of hard work had
to leave the Society. Suffice it to say, that most of the
work of organisation, collection of funds etc. was done
by him and Namjoshi. He was the guiding spirit of
the institution and can claim a handsome share of
the credit of having made it a success.</p>
<p>As a professor, Mr. Tilak maintained an exceptionally
high level. He was a specialist in Mathematics and
Sanskrit ; and he was occasionally required to take
Science also. His teaching was always thorough and
satisfied the cleverest of students. It was marked by
rapidity, profundity and originality which frequently
was the despair of average students.</p>
<p>The causes which compelled Mr. Tilak to sever his
connection from the Society had their germs in the
very initial stages of the progress of the New English
School. They rapidly accumulated since 1885, result
ing in greater and greater acrimony. It would have
been better for the peace and harmony of the infant
School and the infant College had more care and rigid###ity been observed with respect to the admission of new</p>
<p>36 LOKAMANYA TILAK</p>
<p>life-members, had the basic principles of the body been
put down as articles of faith and had members joining
the Society been required to observe them or withdraw
from the body. As a result of this laxity, different tem###peraments could not harmoniously be blended by
solemn obligations ; this want of harmony inevitably
resulted in incompatibility of views, which, in its turn.
Increased bitterness and finally brought about rupture###in 1890. Mr. Tilak and his associates started their
career for the cheapening and facilitating of education.
They placed before themselves the aim of establishing
an Indian Educational Mission, forming a network of
schools throughout Maharashtra on the Jesuitical idea of
poverty and self-denial. In the discussions which Mr.
Tilak had with Mr. Agarkar in 1879 this ideal was fuUy
accepted. It was over and over repeated on each and
every public occasion which they and their associates
could get. It was repeated when Mr. Apte gave, on
behalf of his colleagues, evidence before the Hunter
Commission in 1882 ; it was repeated on the occasion
of the visit to the institution of Sir James Fergusson,
then Governor of Bombay (Feb. 1884). If Mr. Tilak&rsquo;s
colleagues, later on found this oft-repeated pledge in###convenient, if by continuous and sometimes devious
tactics they sought to temper its rigour, if regarding
him as aknost an obstacle in the way they harassed
him by magnifying his faults, questioning even his
capacity, taxing him with self-assertion and self-glorifi###cation under the cloak of Divine disinterestedness and
stoicism and by going to the length of passing a vote of
censure upon him, surely it was no fault of Mr. Tilak
that he felt himself obliged to resign.</p>
<p>THE SCHOOL AND THE COLLEGE 37</p>
<p>The first three years of the school were spent in the
struggle of asserting its existence. When the school
and the newspapers became accomplished facts, inspite
of desertion, death, incarceration and disappointed ma###lice the next three years were spent in organizing the
institutions. By the end of this period, the constitution
of the D. E. Society was formed and the bye-laws of
the managing board were passed on the model of the
regulations of Missionary bodies. All life-members
were to receive equal pay and had equal rights. As the
monthly pay fixed was not very high, it was provided
that under special circumstances gratuities might be
granted in addition to monthly salaries. A further
provision for accidents etc., was made by assuring the
life of every member for Rs. 3,000 and Mr. Tilak who
did the whole of this business thought that this arrange###ment would leave no motive for anybody to seek work
outside the body and thus divert his energies in a
different channel.</p>
<p>When, however, the struggles and cares of establish###ment and organisation were over, some members began
to long for more and began to talk of the growing needs
of their families. The cry was catching and when the
lead was taken by some of the elders newly admitted
members who had but a dim perception of why and
how the principle of sacrifice was adopted naturally
joined in it and every excuse was pleaded to discover a
loophole and break through the original understanding.
&lsquo;■•J The first attempt in this direction was made in 1885.
It sought to remove the inequahties of payment receiv###ed by members. In the beginning (18S0) some mem###bers had taken no payment while others were allowed</p>
<p>38 LOKAMANYA TILAK</p>
<p>to draw more, even in after years in consideration of
their special wants. It was proposed to remove these
inequalities with effect from 1880, by making up the
account of each life member since 1880, excluding the
special gratuities in each case and the accounts were
so adjusted as to make the sum drawn by each propor###tionate to the period of service.</p>
<p>It was unfortunate that the conduct of the Kesari and
Mahratta was combined with that of the School and the
College. The financial position of the school improved
earlier while the newspapers were not paying concerns
at all. The writers did not get any profit from
their work. As long as the whole body were working
zealously for the joint concerns no difficulty arose.
But when members began to count the market###value of their energy and ability, it so happened that
while some ceased to write to the papers and devo###ted themselves to more paying pursuits, others had
to devote the whole of their time to the Press without
receiving anything.</p>
<p>This brings us to the main question, &quot; Whether or
not a member of the Society could do some outside work
for his private gain.&rdquo; In the initial stages of the school
some members were paid extra gratuity for their
special wants, because no member was to work in his
private time for personal end. From 1885, however,
the principle of equal pay and equal work began to be
preached and it was urged that if any member had any
special wants he should meet them by private work
and that the duty of each and every member was to
teach in the school for 4 hours and that, beyond that
every individual was free to do what he liked. The</p>
<p>THE SCHOOL AND THE COLLEGE 39</p>
<p>result of this was that the membership of the D. E.
Society began to be considered as a good start for a
beginner in Poona and that if he had any energy and
ambition, he could use it as a stepping stone for personal
distinction. The scale of the salaries of the members of
the Society was first increased to give them free time
and energy to work for the common object and then
the theory of four-hours&rsquo; service v/as propagated to
satisfy the financial ambitions of individual members,
who priding themselves on the name of Indian Jesuits,
were not willing to imitate the singleminded devotion
of the European Jesuits. Mr. Tilak, therefore rightly
insisted that either the outside work should be stopped
or that, a rule should be made that the profits of the
extra work should go to the common fund as in the case
of Missionary Societies.* It was with this view that a
resolution was passed, in February 1888, that if any
special book was required for the school, it should be
prepared by open competition and its copyright pur###chased by the Managing Board. The very first case,
however that came for consideration, was decided on a
contrary principle. Mr. Gokhale, who was given Arith-</p>
<ul>
<li>Mr. Gokhale, who in these controversies had uniformly op###posed Mr. Tilak has himself framed the following rule for his
Servants of India Society : —</li>
</ul>
<p>(Rule IX d) That he (a member of the Society) will be con###tent with such provision for himself and his family, if he has any,
as the Society may be able to make. He will devote no part
of his energies to earning money for himself.</p>
<p>What Mr. Tilak insisted upon, in all the acrimonious contro###versies which his opponents in the D. E, Society thought fit to
indulge in, was only this that a Life-Member of the Institution
will devoie no part of his energies to earning money for himself.</p>
<p>40 lOKAMANYA TILAK</p>
<p>metics of Standard VII discovered that a suitable text###book was wanting and the Board resolved to make his
book a text-book for 1889, before it was published.</p>
<p>About this very time Mr. Gokhale, who had been for
some time working for the Sarvajanik Sabha journal
now thought of accepting the post of the Secretary of
that association with 2 or 3 hours&rsquo; regular work every
day. Mr. Tilak objected to such a diversion of mem###bers&rsquo; energies. He declared that it would be carrying
the privilege of private work too far to allow members
to contract such definite engagements outside the body.
The Secretaryship had been offered to him before, but
he had declined to accept it for the above reason.</p>
<p>In February 1887, Mr. Agarkar found himself in
money difficulties. Under ordinary circumstances, he
should have put in an application for gratuity. But,
while advocating members&rsquo; right to earn extra money
by doing extra work he had been chiefly instrumental
in passing a resolution that the occasions for gratuities
should be rare. He therefore brought before the Board
a proposition to increase the monthly salary of all the
life members. The only reason given for the proposed
change was that the financial condition of the school
permitted it. Mr. Tilak urged that if necessary to
Mr. Agarkar, a gratuity might be given to him but the
supposed prosperity of the finance was no ground for
increasing salary, at least so long as the Society was
not properly endowed.</p>
<p>These and like discussions, frequently held, created a
lot of irritation which left behind it a trail of bitterness
and even rancour. Questions of general policy, of
starting a Boarding House and a Technical school, of</p>
<p>THE SCHOOL AND THE COLLEGE 4!</p>
<p>accepting a European professor helped to widen the
breach. Mr. Tilak steadfastly tried to remain loyal to
the original ideals while others were equally determined
to give way to circumstances. Finding the situation
hopeless, Mr. Tilak took leave (June 1889) for one term
with the object of ultimately withdrawing from the
body. A compromise was then effected on the ques###tion of outside work, salaries and internal relations and
then Mr. Tilak rejoined the school. But like previous
arrangements, this too proved nothing more than a
paper arrangement. So for the peace and harmony
of the institution he loved most, Mr. Tilak, after a very
painful struggle severed his connection from the D. E.
Society (Dec. 1890).</p>
<p>When Mr. Tilak has detailed these reasons in his
memorable resignation, when the records of the D. E.
Society bear witness to the incessant struggles between
his lofty idealism and the continued efforts of some of
his colleagues to improve their financial position at the
cost of the great principle of self-sacrifice, is it not rather
strange that those v/ho, though not eye-witnesses to the
events culminating in Mr. Tilak&rsquo;s resignation have at
least ready access to the documents of the Society,
should have come forward to anyhow discredit Mr.
Tilak in the eyes of the general public ? The Hon. Mr.
Paranjpye, in one of his gratuitous attacks on Mr. Tilak
has attempted to discover the causes of Mr. Tilak&rsquo;s dis###agreement with his colleagues. But he has not a word
to say about the sordid considerations and disputes
which disfigured the Society&rsquo;s Proceedings Book for a
number of years. All these controversies he conveni###ently ignores and rushes to his own pet theories which.</p>
<p>42 LOKAMANYA TILAK</p>
<p>unsupported by evidence and having no foundation in
facts should never have been propounded. According
to Mr. Paranjpye, Mr. Tilak had two unpardonable
faults. He never learned the simple lesson that two
persons could differ on some points while agreeing on
many others ; and worse still, Mr. Tilak was such a
masterful personality that he could never work with an
equal. The inevitable consequence followed. Mr. Tilak,
unable to tolerate differences of opinions in his col###leagues became more and more overbearing in his deal###ings with them ; and jealousy completed the breach thus
created by intolerance.</p>
<p>Is there any shred of truth in these accusations ?
Have they been supported by any evidence, real or
imaginary ? The answer is no. That Mr. Tilak held
strong views on many important problems of the day is
well-known ; but that differences in opinions created
the breach in the D. E. Society has yet to be established;
and that Mr. Tilak allowed these differences so to over###power him as to influence his conduct with those in###terested in the work of the Society is indeed a large
assumption. Why, we can enunciate just the contrary
proposition and undertake to prove it from manifold in###stances on record. Unlike Messrs Apte and Agarkar —
his principal opponents in the Society — Mr. Tilak was
essentially a man of action ; and being a man of action
he never hesitated to co-operate even with his oppon###ents. Times without number, Mr. Tilak had occasion
to crosss words with Dr. Bhandarkar; but in the picket###ing campaign of 1908, Dr. Bhandarkar was his friend
and ally. Times without number, Mr. Tilak had occa###sions to condemn the public conduct of Dr. Bhatavdekar;</p>
<p>THE SCHOOL AND THE COLLEGE 43</p>
<p>but in the astronomical conferences held in Maharashtra
to improve the old calenders, Dr. Bhatavadkar was
alwaj^s by his side. In the plague of 1897, Mr. Tilak
co-operated even with the Government. In the famous
Home Rule agitation, he joined hands with Mrs. Besant.
There have been occasions when Mr. Tilak has co###operated with Mr. Paranjp3&rsquo;e himself. If Mr. Tilak
could co-operate with the missionaries, with the Govern###ment, with persons of the type of Dr. Bhandarkar, Dr.
Bhatavadekar, Mrs. Besant and Mr. Paranjpye, surely
the charge of intolerance falls to the ground and
cannot by any stretch of logic or rhetoric be sustained
against one, who of all others was chiefly instrumental
in securing for the D. E. Society the patronage of
Ranade, Bhandarkar, Telang, Mandlik, Wordsworth
and many others.</p>
<p>Mr. Tilak jealous ! Mr. TUak unable to work with</p>
<p>his equals Mr. Tilak, who during eleven years of his</p>
<p>life in the D. E. Society never once cared to accept the
post of a Principal, Head-Master or Superintendent !
And prey, jealous of whom ? Not of Ranade or Telang
— his intellectual peers ; but of Apte, Agarkar and
Gokhale ! ! &quot; Mr. Tilak saw soon after Gokhale&rsquo;s ad###mission to the society that here was a man likely to be
his formidable rival.&quot; Mr. Paranjpye is here speaking
of the Gokhale, not of 1905 or 1908, no, not even of
1897 ; the Gokhale of 1885 or 1887 was, according to
his own biographers, regarded by his own friends and
Mr. Tilak&rsquo;s opponents as nothing better than a clever
college student. Apte was a Sanskritist and nothing
more ; Mr. Tilak&rsquo;s versatile genius could beat Apte on
his own ground. As regards Agarkar, his title to fame</p>
<p>44 LOKAMANYA TILAK</p>
<p>rests more on his great sacrifice, his championship ot
every kind of reform and his eloquent style, rather
than on his genius and learning. In point of intellec###tual equipment, Mr. Tilak far surpassed all his collea###gues ; and if there was any jealousy at work, it must
have been rather in the minds of those who, accustom###ed to regard Mr. Tilak as an equal ever since the
college days, could not now bear with equanimity his
enormous superiority.</p>
<p>Whether Mr. Tilak should have so much valued the
principle of self-sacrifice as to endanger unity and good###will might leave room for difference of opinion. But
from the foregoing account it must be abundantly clear
that, not jealousy or intolerance but the great principle
of self-sacrifice on which Mr. Tilak would brook no
compromise was responsible for Mr. Tilak&rsquo;s separation
from his colleagues. The incident, however deplorable
or painful brought happy results ; for the loss of the
D. E. Society was the gain of India. One need never
lament the day — howsoever unpleasant the circumstan###ces attending the event — when Mr. Tilak decided to give
that to this country which he had so unselfishly and
ungrudgingly given to the school and the college. Our
only regret is that he did not leave the D. E. Society a
few years earlier.</p>
