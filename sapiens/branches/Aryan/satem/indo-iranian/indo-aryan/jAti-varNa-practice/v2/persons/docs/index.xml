      <description>&lt;p&gt;Source: Tarikh-I-Mubarak Shah by Yahya bin Ahmad Sirhindi via &lt;a href=&#34;https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1275448660566740992.html&#34;&gt;jayant20&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Delhi sultanate rulers were well known for their oppressive policies towards the local Hindus. From jizya, to destruction of temples, Hindus of India had to go through a dark&#xA;period during the regime of the five dynasties that ruled from Delhi and are collectively referred to as the &amp;ldquo;Delhi Sultanate.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This was during the reign of Mubarak Shah, the second ruler of the dynasty. His entire reign was marked by internal disputes and chaos. Moreover, his policies towards the Hindus were as oppressive as the kings before him. At such situations, Two Hindu Khatri (Kshatriya) commanders in his army, Singharan (also Sadharan in some sources) and Sidhu Pal (also Sidhi Pal in some sources) planned to dethrone the Sultan.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
