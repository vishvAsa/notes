      <description>&lt;p&gt;who prescribed medicine to the patients of malaria, influenza etc. in Barind region of Malda, founded the &amp;ldquo;satyam shivam&amp;rdquo; cult among the santal-s,  {&lt;a href=&#34;http://shodhganga.inflibnet.ac.in/bitstream/10603/149149/12/12_chapter_04.pdf&#34;&gt;SG&lt;/a&gt;}&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;Kashishwar made a deep impression on the santals and a large number of them embraced Hinduism. They gave up eating pigs, fowls and other food considered obnoxious by the Hindus. It needs to be mentioned here that there was a similarity in observances and tenets between the Sapha Hor of Santal Parganas and the Satyam Shibam of Malda. The followers of the Sapha Hor also did not take pigs or fowls nor did they drink toddy or pachwai. While the Sapha Hor was santals and half way to Hinduism, the Satyam Shibams were full-fledged Hindus. Both these sects had adopted the principles of pollution and purification of the Hindus. Kashishwar Chakraborty selected his favourite disciples from every village and conferred him with the title sardar. Every sardar received the particular cloth, turban and a piece of silver, in which the words &amp;quot; Satyam Shibam Sundaram&amp;rdquo; were inscribed. Sardars had to look after the practice of social norms and customs of their villages. The title sardar was a prestigious one and disciples rendered a habitual obedience to them. At every village there was a &amp;ldquo;Kalithan&amp;rdquo; where on every Tuesday evening disciples used to pray, worship and sing.&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;the unfortunately anglicized engineer from maisuuru, builder of large public works in nAsik, hyderAbAd, maisuuru. Later diivaan of the maisuuru raaja [&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1LbPgeTekw&#34;&gt;YT&lt;/a&gt;] before resigning due to being overruled by kRShNarAja vaDiyAr who favored Miller committee report which recommended caste-based reservations {&lt;a href=&#34;http://roundtableindia.co.in/index.php?option=com_content&amp;amp;view=article&amp;amp;id=8894:miller-committee-report-1919&amp;amp;catid=115:dalitbahujan-renaissance&amp;amp;Itemid=127&#34;&gt;RTI&lt;/a&gt;}. Led a very disciplined 100+ year life, continued to be surprisingly spry.&#xA;- spoke better gujarAti &amp;amp; marAThi than kannaDa and telugu! The man in many ways was a japanese (minus the geopolitical and spiritual genius) among us Indians.&#xA;- He could not correctly grasp the low quality of our human resources and our existential struggle even as he repeatedly expressed disappointment about our pauruSha and focus on conservative brAhma.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
