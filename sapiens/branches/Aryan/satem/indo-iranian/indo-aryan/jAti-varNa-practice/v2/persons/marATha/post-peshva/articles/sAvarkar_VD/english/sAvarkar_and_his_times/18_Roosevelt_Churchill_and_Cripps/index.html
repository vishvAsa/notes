  <p>I</p>
<p>Meantime, there was a move in tlie Liberal Circles to solve
the deadlock in their way. They held a Non-Party</p>
<p>Conference in March 1941 at the Taj Malial Hotel, Bombay.
The Convener of the Conference was the late Sir Tej Bahadur
Sapru. It may be noted here that a few days before this
Gandhiji had called on the ailing knight at his residence in
Allahabad. Sir Tej was also in coi&rsquo;respondence with Gandhiji,
and Dr. Jayakar had seen Savarkar in the preceding month.
Intellectual and legal luminaries of India attended the
Conference. Prominent among those who attended the
Conference weie Sir Jagdish Prasad, Sir Nripendranath
Sirkar, Sir Chimanlal Setalvad, Loknayak Aney, Dr. Moonje,
Pandit Kunzru, Dr. Jayakar, Savarkar and Dr. Mookerjee.</p>
<p>The Conference was about to break up since some of the
leaders were nervous about the representative character
of the Conference. At such a crucial moment Sir Tej
requested Savarkar to speak on the point. Addressing the
Conference, Savarkar said that they had struck a note in the
political history of the country. They had proved that the
various parties in India could meet on the basis of a common
programme though they had allegiance to different ideologies.
As the President of the Hindu Mahasabha, he asserted his
belief in India’s right to absolute political independence ; but
although some of them in the Conference were not prepared
to go so far with him, he did not see why they should not
travel together so long as they had a common journey. Thus
by his calm and convincing arguments he gave a turn to the
Conference.</p>
<p>The Conference then set to work and demanded Provisional
National Government for India. At the conclusion of the
Conference Sir Tej expressed openly his gratitude to Savarkar
and acknowledged that Savarkar’s valuable guidance and</p>
<p>270 SAVARKAR AND HIS TIMI^S</p>
<p>spirit saved the Conference from a fiasco. It was at this
Conference that the Liberal leaders were indelibly impressed
by Savarkar’s intellectual and persuasive powers and rational
and realistic approach to the political problems. Sri Srinivas
Sastri happened to meet Savarkar at this juncture. Later on,
while speaking at the twenty-third Session of the National
Liberal Federation held at Madras, Sastri referred to a meeting
with Savarkar at Bombay and said that the speaker was not
well acquainted with Mr. Savimkar and had met him only once
at one of those infructuous, pacificatory teas, organized
by Sir Chiinanlal Setalvad. On that occasion the speaker had
expected to see a gentleman perverse, obstinate and loud, but
found a thin looking, quiet Maharashtra chap, speaking slowly
and deliberately, seldom raising his voice and always
apparently in full possession of his mind and knowing exactly</p>
<p>what he wanted Sastri further said that he at once</p>
<p>conceived a great admiration for the man. Thus at one more
political rally Savarkar captivated the intellectual luminaries
and lofty brains of India by his reason, intellect and the
uncommon range and quality of his mental and argumentative
powers.</p>
<p>The reaction of Mr. Jinnah to this Non-Party Conference
was notable. From Bangalore he declared that the Conference
was engineered by the agents of the Congress and the Hindu
Mahasabha. Mr, L. S. Amery, the Secretary of State for
India, referred to the Bombay Non-Party Conference in his
speech in the House of Commons in April 1941, and said that
the Conference had not been able to secure any kind of
agreement on the scheme. Replying to the charges levelled
by Mr. Jinnah and Mr. Amery, in a statement Sir Tej stated
that in his political life he had never been trapped by anybody
and said : “ I was more than gratified that men like</p>
<p>Mr. Savarkar and Dr. Moonje, who were present at the
Conference, played the game and accepted the resolution.
They were men of strong party convictions and yet, for the
sake of settlement, they subordinated their party feelings to
the common goal we had in view.’&rsquo; ’ Sapru soon saw the
Viceroy and was then “ thinking, according to the Nainital
correspondent of the Statesman, of a joint meeting of Gandhi ji,</p>
<p>^ The Mdhratta, dated 2-5-1941.</p>
<p>ROOSEVELT, CHURCHILL AND CRIPPS 271</p>
<p>Mr. Savarkar and Mr. Jinnah or a small Conference including
these three leaders, convened by some persons of influence
outside the League and the Congress.’’ ‘</p>
<p>Then came the first breach in the stronghold of the Central
citadel of the British Bureaucracy. Lord Linlithgow, the
Viceroy of India, reshuffled his Executive Council on July 21,
1941, making appointments of seven Indians. Savarkar opined
that the change was a step in the right direction if it was to
pave the way for further and rapid development of constitu-
tional progress, and stated that the bitterness felt by patriotic
parties in India could not be dissipated unless Britain granted
India, if not full independence, at least equal partnership in
the Irido-British Commonwealth.</p>
<p>In the wake of these political changes, a second Session of
the Sapru Conference was again held at Poona on Jul^^ 26,
1941, wherein Savarkar got the United India resolution passed
by the Conference. At the morning sitting of the Session on
that day Sir Mirza Ismail was present, but he was conspicu-
ously absent when the United India resolution came up for
discussion in the evening. Savarkar, therefore, pertinently
inquired of Sir Tej the whereabouts of his trusted Ismail and
Sir Tej with a smile replied that it was true that Sir Mirza
Ismail had not turned up as promised. Was the absence of
a nationalist Muslim inexplicable at the time of such an
important resolution ?</p>
<p>It did not escape the alert eyes of Savarkar that the Viceroy
had not done justice to the claims of the Sikhs and the
Depressed Classes and therefore he wired to the Viceroy
urging him to nominate a Sikh leader on the Executive
Council. The non-inclusion of a Depressed Class repiesenla-
tive in the Executive Council was rightly resented by
Dr. Ambedkar. Savarkar immediately supported the strong
protest which Dr. Ambedkar had made in claiming a seat on
the Viceregal Executive Council and the Mahasabha President
said in his wire to the Viceroy that “ the British Government
could find no more capable a gentleman to fill that post than
Dr. Ambedkar himself.”</p>
<p>Savarkar believed that no nation had entered the
World War with any idealistic motives and U.S.A. would not</p>
<ul>
<li>The Mahrattay dated 9-5-1941.</li>
</ul>
<p>272 SAVAEKAR AND HIS TIMES</p>
<p>translate her slogans of democracy into action by forcing a
democratic rule in India. To underline this truth Savarkar
sent a cable on August 20, 1941, to the American President,
Mr. Franklin D. Roosevelt, urging him to declare explicitly
whether the Atlantic Charter which was announced by
Mr. Churchill and Mr. Roosevelt on August 14, 1941, covered
the case of India or not and whether America guaranteed the
full political freedom of India within a year after the end of
the war. Savarkar further asked President Roosevelt : “ If
America fails to do that, India cannot but construe this decla-
ration as another stunt like the War aims of the last Anglo-
German War, meant only to camouflage the Imperialistic
aggressions of those who have empires against those who have
them not or are out to win them ! ”</p>
<p>This cable was broadcast throughout the world, especially
in Britain, America, Germany, India, and other belligerent
nations. Its implied assertion was fully exploited by Hitler’s
German propaganda to expose the hollowness of the allied
professions of love for democracy ! Mr. Churchill, the
War-time Prime Minister of Britain, was in the end compelled
to tear off with his own hand the mask of vague platitudes.
Mr. Churchill declared with his usual blunt candour that the
Atlantic Charter applied only to those countries which were
then under the Nazi yoke. Savarkar did not leave the matter
there. He again cabled to President Roosevelt on September
22, 1941, and asked the President of the great Republic
whether he dared contradict Mr. Chui’chill’s interpretation or
played a second fiddle to Churchill’s dictation by words or
silence. President Roosevelt in fact kept silence over
Savarkar’s pointed question. It was a straight hit that
exposed the altruistic motives of the Allies. This Savarkarian
trap for the American President was described by the Modem
Review as a statecraft.</p>
<p>A similar cable Savarkar had sent on April 23, 1939, to
President Roosevelt, who had sent forth an appeal to Herr
Hitler to wai’d off the impending colossal danger to the
civilization of humanity. In this cable Savarkar had appealed
to the American President : “ If your note to Hitler is actuated
by disinterested human anxiety for safeguarding freedom and
democracy from military aggression, pray ask Britain too to</p>
<p>ROOSEVELT, CHURCHILL AND CRIPPS 273</p>
<p>withdraw the amied domination over Hindusthan and let
her have a free and self-determined Constitution. A great
nation like Hindusthan can surely claim at least as much
International Justice as small nations do.”</p>
<p>This cable underlined Savarkar’s conviction that so far as
war was concerned, India need not base her hopes on the
professed war aims of the Allies. The Germans flashed this
retort of Savarkar to the American President all over
Germany as they had broadcast throughout their nation
Savarkar s speeches on foreign politics. The frank exposition
of this truth was very much appreciated by many candid
American politicians one of whom Mr. M. M. Gross wrote to
Savarkar from the U.S.A. appreciating his cable to President
Roosevelt : “ Although there are many who believe as you
and I, very few have the courage to voice their feelings as you
did. Keep up the work, there will be an international day of
peace.” Another American of note promised co-operation in
publishing Savarkar’s viewpoint before the American people.</p>
<p>The popularity and influence of the Hindu Mahasabha was
rising and the Hindu Mahasabha was now a force to be
reckoned with. Noted politicians, authors and constitutional
experts from abroad now interviewed Savarkar at his house
at Shivaji Park, Bombay. Towards the end of 1941,
Mr. Hudson, the Reforms Commissioner, then officially
travelling in India to collect data for the future constitution
of India, had an interview with Savarkar. Prof. Reginald
Coupland of the Oxford University, who visited India for
studying the political constitution of India, met Savarkar along
with the Secretary to the Governor of Bombay on January 15,
1942. Mr. T. A. Raman, special correspondent of the North
American News Papers Alliance, saw Savarkar during the
same month. Mr. John H. Magruder, representative of the
New York Times, who was on active Naval service in Egypt,
had come to India to join the American Navy. He saw
Savarkar and discussed the Indian political situation with
him. Sir Evelyn Wrench, a representative of the Spectator,
London, who was on a political survey in India, interviewed
Savarkar to acquaint himself with the Mahasabha view on
the war situation and the Pakistan scheme.</p>
<p>At this jimcture there was a grave crisis in the war situation</p>
<p>18</p>
<p>274 SAVARKAR AND HIS TIMES</p>
<p>for the Allies in the East as well as in the West. On February
11, 1942, Generalissimo Chiang Kai Shek of China paid a
meteoric visit to India. He was the President of the Chinese
Republic and it was said he had come to discuss with the
Viceroy of India the war situation in the context of the
political situation in India and if possible to persuade the Indian
political forces to help the Allies unconditionally in the war.
Savarkar greeted the Chinese leader on behalf of the Hindu
Nation. In reply the Chinese leader and his wife thanked
Savarkar for the good wishes.</p>
<p>Singapore fell shortly afterwards to Japanese forces. Wiih
the fall of Singapore and the destruction of the British
warships, the Repulse and the Prince of Wales, it seemed that
Japan would smash the allied forces in the East. At this
psychological moment Savarkar issued a statement in which
he reiterated : “ Nothing now can rouse the Indian people
with a war-like spirit to fight to a finish, but a bold and
unambiguous proclamation on the part of the British Govern-
ment that India is guaranteed forthwith a co-partnership in
an Indo-British Commonwealth with other self-governing
constituents including Great Britain herself. Every functional
step to nationalise the Government in India and to materialise
this proclamation must also be immediately and actually
taken.” Savarkar also warned the British Government : “ If
Japan is allowed to forestall the British Government in this
case and to proclaim as soon as and if her invading forces
reach the borders of India that their immediate objective is
to free and guarantee the Independence of India, such a
Proclamation on their part cannot but capture the imagination
of the Indian people by storm and usher in incalculable
poUtical compUcations.” ^ This statement was not a veiled
threat. It was the outcome of the rare insight and poUtical
wisdom that was soon largely borne out by events.</p>
<p>II</p>
<p>Since 1940, the fissiparous tendencies in Indian poUtics had
begun to assume a threatening aspect. In the first week of
March 1942, Sri Rajagopalachari styled the MusUm demand</p>
<p>^ Statement dated 17-2-1942.</p>
<p>ROOSEVELT, CHURCHILL AND CRIPPS 275</p>
<p>for vivisection of India into a brood of Pakistani States as a
‘ just and fair share in real power and stated that no Indian
politician was interested in denying this.’ Savarkar could
not let this outrageous assumption go unchallenged. He
condemned Rajaji’s statement and said ; “ Rajaji’s officiousness
is only equalled by his audacity in presuming that he was
entitled to play the role of a self-appointed spokesman of all
politicians in India and secondly that all Indians who did not
think the demands of the Moslem League ‘ fair and just ’ were
not politicians at all. The League demands that India should
be vivisected into a brood of Pakistans. Does that amount
only to a desire to have a ‘ fair and just ’ share in real power ? ”
Savarkar warned the British Government that such com-
promises made by Congressmen were not binding on the
Hindu Mahasabha.</p>
<p>On March 7, 1942, Savarkar cabled to the British Premier,
Mr. Churchill, urging him “ to make a proclamation of the
Indian Independence with co-partnership equal with Britain
in an Indo-British Commonwealth ” and demanded “ imme-
diate nationalisation of the Indian Government.” The Premier
of Britain acknowledged the cable through the Viceroy and
thanked Savarkar. About this time there was some talk of a
Congress-League pact in which Sir Sikandar Hyat Khan,
Prime Minister of the Punjab, figured prominently. Savarkar
warned Sir Sikandar Hyat Khan that “ any Congress-League
pact would not be binding on the Hindus. If it was detrimental
to the Hindu rights, it would be opposed by the Hindu
Mahasabha.”</p>
<p>By now the war situation was worsening for the Allies.
Threatened with a grave crisis in war created by the lightning
successes of Japan in March 1942, and with a view to
impressing the American people with the genuine sincerity
of British aims about India, the British Cabinet sent one of
their Ministers, Sir Stafford Cripps, to India on March 23,
1942, with a Cabinet proposal. The proposal was a mischievous
scheme for the Indian nationalists. The proposal envisaged
the creation of a new Indian Union which would constitute
a Dominion associated with the United Kingdom immediately
after the cessation of hostilities. Secondly the proposal
granted the right to any province in British India that was not</p>
<p>276 SAVARKAR AND HIS TIMES</p>
<p>prepared to accept the new constitution framed by the
constitution-making body, to retain ite then constitutional
position, provision being made for its subsequent accession, if
it so desired.</p>
<p>Cripps interviewed important Indian leaders of public
opinion and discussed his scheme with them. Accompanied
by Dr. Moonje, Dr. Shyama Prasad Mookerjee, Sir Jwala-
prasad Srivastava and Lala Ganpat Rai, Savarkar had a
memorable interview with Cripps. Though the first part of
the Cripps Scheme was acceptable to Savarkar, he roundly
condemned in the interview the second part of the scheme
which virtually conceded Pakistan by granting the right of
secession to the provinces under the sweet name of
self-determination. During the course of the discussion
Cripps, the one-time Advocate-General of Britain, opined that
the right of self-determination was not new in politics and
was given to every unit in Canada before the formation of
her federation. To support his case Cripps also cited examples
from South Africa and other countries. Savarkar thereupon
turned those arguments upon Cripps himself by telling the
British Minister that the Canadian States were already quite
separate entities before they were called together to say
whether they liked to form themselves into an organic State,
Federal or otherwise. But here in India, continued Savarkar,
unlike the Canadian States, the provinces were already
welded into one Central unit and so there was no similarity
between the two cases. Savarkar further said to Cripps :</p>
<p>“ The question before us today is not to form out of separate
and independent States or constituents a new nation, or a
federation or a confederation. India is already a Unitarian
State.”</p>
<p>Cripps replied that India was never a Unitarian nation.
Thereupon Savarkar answered back : “ To the Hindus, it is
an article of faith that India, their Motherland and Holyland,
is a cultural and national unit undivided and indivisible. Let
alone the cultiural unity which you may not grasp during this
short period of the interview, but you wiU agree that
politically and administratively the British Government
admits it and calls the Government of India the Indian
Government, the Army and Navy are called the Indian Army</p>
<p>ROOSEVELT, CHURCHILL AND CRIPPS 277</p>
<p>and Indian Navy, and Bombay and Bengal are called the
provinces. All these factors prove that India is an undivided
centralised nation and a State. And as for the principle of
self-determination, it is a right to be given to a nation as a
whole and not io a part thereof.”</p>
<p>Savaikar’s arguments were irrefutable. The effect was
powerful. Caught in his own trap for the first time while
conducting political negotiations with Indian leaders, Cripps
who set Russia against Cermany and enticed many Indian
leaders like Pandit Nehrif nm his snare, hung down his head
in silence. The suavity of his manners and sweetness of his
tongue faded ! In his silence he accepted a defeat at the
hands of Savarkar. The interview terminated and Savarkar
came out with his face flushed, and he remarked to the
pressmen : “ We shall fight out Pakistan to the last.” So
crushing and complete was the defeat inflicted on Sir Stafford
Cripps by Savarkar that this interview became a topic among
political circles at Delhi for many days. Even the National
Herald, Pandit Nehru’s mouthpiece, referred to this interview
in its comments on the proposed retirement of Savarkar from
the Presidentship of the Hindu Mahasabha. The National
Herald remarked : ^ “ Profoundly as we disagree with</p>
<p>Savarkar’s politics, we freely admit that he is one of the few
men of our age who have made history and contributed to a
reawakening of oiir people. . . . He showed the old fire in him,
when he took up the thoughtless challenge thrown to the
Hindu Mahasabha by the Government of Bihar, and obtained
a resounding victory at Bhagalpur. With Sir Stafford Cripps
he crossed swords which the former will never forget.” And
indeed the voice of Savarkar will ring in the ears of Cripps
for many years to come.</p>
<p>Savarkar advised the Working Committee of the Hindu
Mahasabha to reject the Cabinet proposal in toto as it was to
be accepted or rejected in toto, and he left Delhi for Bombay
immediately. The Hindu Mahasabha was the first political
organisation that rejected the Cabinet proposal entirely.
Cripps wanted to have a talk with Savarkar a second time,
but Savarkar felt that it was futile to see him and discuss the
scheme while the secession clause stood there. Yet Savarkar</p>
<p>1 Quoted in The Mahratta, dated 28-8-1942.</p>
<p>278 SAVARKAR AND HIS TIMES</p>
<p>was interviewed again at the Bombay Secretariat by H.E. the
Governor of Bombay when Savarkar expressed his view that
the Hindu Mahasabha would join the National Government if
the secession clause was not binding.</p>
<p>The Muslim League rejected the Cabinet proposal as the
freedom of separation was neither full nor clear. The Sikh
All-Party Conference rejected it protesting against the
principle of provincial self-determination. The Congress
party was willing to accept the scheme. Be it noted that in
spite of the secession clause which it swallowed, after
prolonged negotiations the Congress strained at the gnat of
the Defence Portfolio which was to remain in the hands of
the British representative during the operation of war, and
at last rejected the scheme. Thus it was Savarkar who first
opened the Pandora’s box brought by the wily, crafty and
subtle Cripps full of artificial laugh, while the new expression
self-determination had bewitched some men of Savarkar’s
camp, had accelerated the brainwave of the cool and
calculating Sapru-type Liberals, and had visibly affected the
spinal chord of the Indian National Congress. The Indian
leaders were so thoroughly captivated that they quoted Cripps
to silence their opponents !</p>
<p>It is worth mentioning here that eminent Liberal leaders
like Sri Srinivas Sastri, Sir V. N. Chandavarkar and veteran
statesmen like Sir C. P. Ramaswami Aiyar and Sri Ramananda
Chatterjee had sensed the danger to the integrity of India
through the suicidal policy of the Congress. Ramananda
Chatterjee who presided over a public meeting at the
University Institute Hall, Calcutta, on August 22, 1941, said ;
“I am sure, if we are true sons and daughters of India, it
shall never be divided.” Speaking at a meeting at the
Blavatsky Lodge Hall, Bombay, on the next day of Savarkar’s
historic interview with Sir Stafford Cripps, Sri Srimvas Sastri
appealed to the coimtry to support the Hindu Mahasabha and
said : “ We all cherish the unity of India and we will all resist
any attempt to break up what we take so much pride in. . . .
Hindus whether they belong to the Congress, the Liberal
Federation, or any other organization will express their
sympathy with the Hindu Mahasabha. They should not only
rest content with mere sympathy, but also go to the extent</p>
<p>ROOSEVELT, CHURCHILL AND CRIPPS 279</p>
<p>of extending their active political support to the Hindu
Mahasabha.” ^</p>
<p>This is a great tribute to the invincible stand taken by
Savarkar in regard to the integrity of India and this fervent
appeal made by Sastri to all the Hindus for supporting the
Hindu Mahasabha clearly meant that Sastri believed that the
integrity of India was safer in the hands of Savarkar than in
those of the Congress leaders.</p>
<p>And what did the Congress leaders do ?</p>
<p>Mesmerised by the false ideas of the principle of self-
determination and impelled by the craftiness of its President,
Maulana Azad, the Congress High Command thrust the
poisonous pill of Provinciial self-determination down the throat
of the Indian National Congress, the erstwhile protagonist of
India’s unity and indivisibility. The Working Committee of
the Indian National Congress proclaimed emphatically by a
resolution at Delhi in April 1942, “ that the Congress could
not think in terms of compelling the people of any territorial
unit to join the Indian Union against their declared and
established will.”</p>
<p>This historic resolution brought into bold relief the fact that
the Congress favoured the provinces with the right of self-
determination or secession and such secession was called by
the Muslims ‘ Pakistan ’. Dealing with the Congress resolution
four years after. Dr. Pattabhi Sitaramayya had to admit : “ It
is evident that the passage concedes the division of India into
more than one State and gives the go-by to the xmity and
integrity of India.” ^ Is any confession more sinful than this
of Pattabhi ? People of the Congress persuasion hoped that
Pandit Nehru would oppose the principle of provincial self-
determination. But self-determination was a new current of
thought in Indian politics and Nehru who was ever on his
wings to march with new ideas must fall in line with the
provincial self-determination ! It was the shape of things to
come and Nehru honestly fitted himself into it !</p>
<p>When this .historic resolution of the Congress was out,</p>
<p>^ Quoted in The Mahratta, dated 3-4-1942.</p>
<p>^Dr. Pattabhi Sitaramayya, History of the Indian National Congress,
Vol. n. p. 635.</p>
<p>3 Ibid.</p>
<p>280 SAVARKAR AND HIS TIMES</p>
<p>Savarkar came out with a statement in which he said : “ For
the last three years or so I have been publicly warning the
Hindus that there was every likelihood that the Congress
would servilely surrender to the Moslems on the issue of
Pakistan even as it did on the issue of Communal Award
and would even have the crazy audacity of parading this
treacherous act itself as an acid test of Indian patriotism. The
Congressite Hindus continued to challenge and a large section
of the non-Congress Hindus also used to doubt the accuracy
of these assertions on my part. They wanted evidence to
prove my assertions. Now here comes the evidence with a
vengeance. Here is an authoritative declaration by the
Congress framed in a resolution which they have passed,
signed, sealed and delivered to the envoy of the British War
Cabinet that they admitted the right on the part of the Muslim
Provinces, nay, for the matter of that any provinces whatever,
to cut themselves off from Hindusthan and create Independent
States of Pakistans or any other Sthans they choose.” Telling
the people to note the dangerous admission on the part of the
Congress and its far-reaching treacherous implications, he
declared : “ The Congress which calls itself ‘ Indian National
Congress ’ has in these few lines stabbed at a stroke the unity
and integrity of the Indian Nation itself in the back.” ^</p>
<p>For a while there was a tug-of-war between the righteous
and unrighteous flanks of the Congress over the anti-national
resolution of the Congress. National honesty about the inte-
grity and indivisibility of Hindusthan seemed to move towards
the righteous side. In Allahabad at the Session of the All-India
Congress Committee on May 2, 1942, the erstwhile Hindu-
sabhaite, Babu Jagat Narayan, moved his Akhand Hindusthan
resolution, and it was passed with an overwhelming majority.
The A.I.C.C. declared : “ That any proposal to disintegrate
India by giving liberty to any component State or territorial
imit to secede from the Indian Union or Federation will be
highly detrimental to the best interests of the people of
different States and provinces and the country as a whole and
the Congress therefore cannot agree to any such proposal.”</p>
<p>Mkirk the pledged word to Mother India. Mark the holy
promise of national honesty and national integrity. But the</p>
<p>1 Statement, dated 21-4-1942.</p>
<p>ROOSEVELT, CHURCHILL AND CRIPPS 281</p>
<p>Hindu defender of Pakistan in Rajaji would not let the
Akhand Hindusthan resolution go unchallenged. He resigned
the membership of the Congress Working Committee and
moved a counter resolution recognizing the right of separation
of certain areas from United India after ascertaining the
wishes of the people of such areas. But this Pakistan
resolution moved by Rajaji was thrown out on the same day
by the A.I.C.C. by 120 votes against 15.</p>
<p>Another factor to remembered about Babu Jagat
Narayan’s Akhand Hin lusthan resolution is that all the
so-called Nationalist Mu.s.ir. members of the A.I.C.C. opposed
it in the A.I.C.C. session, and declared this brave act of theirs
in a special statement. Yet the dishonest role of the self-
styled saviours of India persisted in its vainglorious platitudes,
high sounding words, knavery and hallucinations. When asked
by Dr. Abdul Latif of Hyderabad, Maulana Azad and Pandit
Nehru replied that the Delhi resolution conceding the right of
self-determination to the provinces was not affected by the
Akhand Hindusthan resolution ! ^ Had there been five honest,
fearless and determined leaders in the A.I.C.C., they could
have raised a voice of truth, a cry of righteousness against
this violation of the Akhand Hindusthan resolution. This
dubious role of the Congress was not a whit less equivocal
than the role played by it in regard to the Communal Award.
Indeed, History was thus repeated once more in a worse form !</p>
<p>Savarkar could not tolerate the sight of the poisonous
dagger of provincial secession aimed at the heart of
Hindusthan. He was perturbed at the tragedy that was being
enacted on the political platform of India. To Savarkar, unity
and integrity of his Motherland and Holyland was an article
of faith, a pious and precious sentiment. The Liberal leaders
like Sri Srinivas Sastri and Sir V. N. Chandavarkar and many
other straightforward men, who perceived the danger to the
National integrity, fuUy supported Savarkar and sounded
a note of caution to the country. It was clear nov^ that the
goal of the Congress was the independence of a Divided India
and the goal of the Hindu Mahasabha and Savarkar was the
independence of India and the integrity of India.</p>
<p>Savarkar was restless. He was striving to avert the tragedy.</p>
<p>1 Hindusthan Standard, dated 8-8-1942.</p>
<p>282 SAVARKAR AND HIS TIMES</p>
<p>He even tried to focus world attention on the dreadful
tragedy that was being enacted in India. The outside world
expressed surprise at the Mahasabha opposition to the Cripps
proposal. Savarkar, therefore, cabled to the editor, New York
Times, to acquaint the outside world with the righteous stand
of the Hindu Mahasabha that “The Hindu Mahasabha
partially accepted the Cripps proposal and welcomed the
promised grant of equal co-partnership with Britain ; but the
scheme made it all conditional on granting freedom to
provinces to secede and break up India into a number of
independent States with no central Indian Government.”
Savarkar concluded : “ Americans in particulai*, who went to
w^ar even with their kith and kin on the question of secession
and saved the integrity of their union, cannot fail to appreciate
and uphold the Hindu opposition to the vivisection of India.
Hindus are prepared to guarantee legitimate safeguards to the
minorities, but can never tolerate their efforts to create a State
within a State as the League of Nations put it.” Savarkar
also warned Sir Stafford Cripps not to depend upon any
Congress-League pact as it would not be binding on the Hindu
Mahasabha.</p>
