Bhagwan Jhulelal Ji is Sindhis Ishta Devata. HE is Avatar of Sri Varun Dev Ji who took avatar in Sindh to save Hindus from tyranny of MirkShah who has threatened Hindus either convert to Isl_m or die. His took avatar on the 1st day of Chaitra month, celebrated as चेट्रीचंड्र.

Hindus when asked to convert, ask MirkShah to give them 40 days time to think. For 40 days, Sindhis did tapasya on banks of river Sindh. On 40th day, Akshavani was heard " Fear not, I shall save you from the wicked Mirkshah." After this revelation, Hindus went to MirkShah and told them about Akashvani. He challenged Hindus that Bhagwan is not gonna come down to earth but he would wait till birth of Jhulelal Ji and then would kill all the Hindus.

On the 1st day of Chaitra, Hindus got good news that Bhagwan has taken birth. On the day of Jhulelal Ji birth, clouds welcome the birth by torrential rains. When infant kid opened his moth, they saw Sindhu river flowing and Bhagwan Jhulelal Ji sitting on pallav fish. When MikShah come to know of kid birth, he send his men to kill the kid. His men arrived at home of Jhulelal Ji, with poison rose to kill the kid, kid blew the flower and showed the full roop to MirkShah men. He got freighted & run away from the home.

Mirkshah men narrated him whol story what happened at Jhulelal Ji home. MirkShah got freighted and adopted the strategy of wait and watch. He abandoned his plans of Killing Hindus for timebeing.

One of the folk story connected with Bhagwan Jhuelal Ji is that as a Kid , his father Ratanchand Ji took the kid to Guru Gorakhnath Ji to make Jhulelal Ji as His shisya.

After sometime, Mirkshah under the pressure of Maulvis waged a war against Jhuelal Ji. Battlefield was Sindhu river banks. When Mirkshah reached Sindhu river bank, he saw army coming out of river. He got frightened and surrendered. This is image which Mirkshah saw.

We worship Jhulelal Ji in form of Jal and Jyoti.

We call this thal as Behrana Sahib, in this thaal there is a Aate ka Diya with five wicks , fruits and flowers. This decorated thaal is then taken to temple with people dancing and singing bhajans all the way.This is known as CHEJ.

The contents of this thaal are then immersed in the water,which is considered as our humble offering to Jhulelal Ji. Before immersion, prayers( pallav) are done to Jhulelal Ji.
