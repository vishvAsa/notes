<p>My position among the people entirely depends upon my
character ; and if I am cowed down by the prosecution,<br>
living in Maharashtra is as good as living in the Andamans.<br>
We are incapable of nourishing any sinster feeling against the
British Rule and it is thus impossible for any of us to be convicted of such a heinous charge as sedition. Such risks however,
we must take * * They are the risks of our profession * * Their
(the Government&rsquo;s) object is to humiliate the Poona leaders,
and I think in me they will not find a &quot; kutchha reed &ldquo;. . .
Then you must remember that beyond a certain stage we are
all servants of the people. You will be betraying and disap###pointing them, if you show a lamentable want of courage at a
critical time.</p>
<p>B. G. Tilak to Motilal Ghose.</p></blockquote>
<p>^T^HE cruel murder of Mr. Rand and Lieut. Ayerst
threw the Anglo-Indian community.into a state of
panic. The psychological day of the Jubilee selected by
the murderer for his deed, raised suspicion in the Anglo###Indian mind that the murder was the result of a deep###laid plot by the Poona Brahmins. When the murderer
made good his escape, the Anglo-Indians vented their
feelings of revenge in an attack on the Indian press
which, by its &quot; seditious writings, &quot; was considered to
have fanned the people into frenzy. They clamoured for
a very wide use of Sec. 124A of the Penal Code.
They declared their misgivings about the suitability</p>
<p>THE LOKAMANYA 95;</p>
<p>of that section for trying subtle writers and speaker###and called for a mere stringent definition of sedition.
They fell foul of Lord Sandhurst for not having vetoed
the very recent election of Mr. Tilak to the Legislative
Council. They feared* &quot; lest in proclaiming that dis###loyalty is no disqualification for nomination by Govern###ment, to places of honour. Government themselves
should make good citizenship at a discount.&rdquo; Extracts
from the Poona press were published and though the
Anglo-Indian papers modestly said that it was for them
to * &quot; establish a direct connection between this wild
teaching and that deplorable event&quot; still, *&quot; the atmos###phere which such teaching must have created is pre###cisely the atomsphere in which violence to individuals,
hatred of Government and widespread contempt for
law and authority would necessarily grow as in a
forcing house.&quot;</p>
<p>The position of Mr. Tilak in the months immediately
preceding the murder of Messrs. Rand and Ayerst was
unenviable. His co-operation with the Bureaucracy
had been bringing him slings from the vernacular papers
belonging to the party led by Ranade and Gokhale.
At the same time, every word of his speeches and wri###tings was sifted and translated by an ever-watchful
Government and the malicious Anglo-Indian Press.
Some of his simplest and most innocent remarks excited
undeserving suspicion. When on the occassion of the
Shivaji Festival, he had simply defended Afzulkhan&rsquo;s
assassination by Shivaji, he was considered to have
preached political murder. When he said &quot; No
copper plate was given to Mlenchhas (Mahomedans) to</p>
<ul>
<li>From the Times of India,</li>
</ul>
<p>^4 LOKAMANYA TILAK</p>
<p>rule over Hindustan, one &ldquo;Justice/&rsquo; who presumably
was a &rsquo; Native &rsquo; and whose ignorance of Marathi was
therefore unpardonable, quoted this sentence in the
Times of India mistranslating it to apply to the Maho###medans and Christians as well and asked whether it
did not amount to an incitement to sedition against the
Govenment. When Mr. Tilak drew the attenton of
the leaders of Poona to the &quot; futility of mere clamour
against the high-handedness of the authorities &quot; and
suggested that the best course for the Poona leaders
was to have remained in the city (Poona) and formed
vigilance-committees for each street and afforded pecu###niary help to the private plague hospital, the Times of
India quoting the remark after the murder said &quot; Though
we do not offer any suggestions as to the view that a
Jury might be persuaded to take of the Hon. Mr. Tilak&rsquo;s
discourse on the * futility of mere clamour &rsquo; against
Mr. Rand and his assistants, still some one with a
pistol in his hand seems to have been in hearty agree###ment with the Honourable Member&rsquo;s distrust in the
efficacy of &rsquo; mere clamour &lsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The sequence of dates also was considered to be sig###nificant. On May iith 1897, Mr. Tilak published the doc###trine of the &quot; futility of mere clamour.&quot; On June 12th
he supplemented it by justifying Shivaji&rsquo;s murder of
Afzulkhan. At the same time he declared that &quot; no
copperplate has been given to the Mlenchhas (applicable
equally to Mahomedans and Christians) by God to rule
over India.&rsquo;* If all these statements be put together,
&quot; do they not&quot; said the average x\nglo-Indian, &ldquo;amount
clearly to a plea of pohtical murder ?&rdquo; Lord Sandhurst
was however saner. He did not tliink so. That is why</p>
<p>THE LOKAMANYA 95</p>
<p>after the murders of Rand and Ayerst he sanctioned
the election of Mr. Tilak to the Legislative Council.
But &quot; the unreasoning panic into which the Anglo###Indian community was driven by such malicious at###tacks and its unfortunate success in inflaming the
English people, forced the hands of the Secretary of
State and Lord Sandhurst had to take measures which,
it is beheved, he would never have sanctioned, if he
had remained a free agent.*&quot;</p>
<p>So excited were the feelings of the Anglo-Indian com###munity that even &quot; on the brink of a gaping grave
giving a peep into the eternity &quot; &quot; the pride of the
Europeans left no room in their hearts for better emo###tions &quot; and persons like Dr. Cawasji Jehangir, once
Sheriff of Bombay, were on the occassion of Mr. Rand&rsquo;s
burial insulted and refused admission by the police at
the cemetery. A Parsi lady who had attended the
cemetery for the purpose of putting a wreath on the
cof&amp;n of Mr. Rand was also not admitted. The threat###ening speech of Mr. Lamb, the then Collector of Poona,
foretelling that people would &quot; find themselves under###going an experience to which they had not been accus###tomed &quot; was another straw indicative of the direction
of the wind. A punitive police was imposed on the
Poona Municipality. Prof. Gokhale, immediately on
his return from England and while yet ashore, had to
concede &quot; the best part of his attention &quot; to the head
of the Bombay Police — the result being a humiliating
apology tendered by him to Lord Sandhurst, the Plague
Committee and the British Soldiers. Mr. Tilak as the</p>

</ul>
<p>96 LOKAMANYA TILAK</p>
<p>editor of Kesari was arrested on 27th July 1897 at
Bombay where he had gone to seek legal redress
against the reckless statements made against him
by the Times of India. The printer of the Kesari
was also arrested. The Editors of the Poona
Vaihhav, the Modavritta, the Pratod were also arrest###ed. The Editors of the Dnyanprakash and Sudharak
bent their knees and saved themselves from pro###secution. The Natu Brothers were deported under
the notorious regulations of 18 18. Altogether it
appeared that a &lsquo;reign of terror &rsquo; had been fully
established at Poona and that the Collector&rsquo;s threat
had been literally carried out.</p>
<p>After a series of preliminary proceedings Mr. Tilak
was set free on bail by Mr. Justice Tyabji on August
4th. The conclusion his Lordship arrived at was that
*&rsquo; the articles in question, * * about which he desired to
say clearly * * that he gave no positive opinion one way
or the other, were not necessarily of such a character as
to lead one to the irresistible conclusion that the man
responsible for such articles must be convicted upon
them.&quot; One of the incriminating articles was a poem
— the production of a poetaster — supposed to be ad###dressed by Shivaji to the Mahrattas exhorting them to
be up and doing and the other was the report of Mr.
Tilak&rsquo;s speech at the close of the Shivaji Festival de###fending Shivaji&rsquo;s murder of Afzulkhan . On this slen###der foundation was the edifice of the prosecution con###structed — a rhetorical piece in poetry from some obs###cure poet and a report of a speech defending Shivaji&rsquo;s
greatness and insisting upon his claim to be recognised
as a national hero.</p>
<p>THE LOKAMANYA 97</p>
<p>At the Bombay High Court, the trial commenced on
August 8th, 1897 before Mr. Justice Strachey and a
Special Jury of nine of whom six were Europeans,
unacquainted with the Marathi language, &quot; What with
the tendencies of the times, th e present temper of the
European community in India, the prejudice excited
against the Mahrattas of Poona since the murders of
Mr. Rand and Lieut. Ayerst &ldquo;* the verdict was prac###tically a foregone conclusion. &quot; The case was one of
the greatest importance and involved the settlement
of grave issues. It was too much to expect so young
and inexperienced a judge as Mr. Arthur Strachey to
rise equal to the importance of the issues before him &ldquo;*.
Had the trial been held at Poona both the Judge and
the Jury could have acquitted themselves better on
account of their intimate knowledge of the Vernacular.
In vain did Mr. Tilak protest that the translations of
the incriminating articles were incorrect ; in vain
did Mr. Pugh, his Counsel point to Mr. Tilak &rsquo;s fair cri###ticism of the Government during the Plague adminis###tration, his complimentary language with respect to
Lord Sandhurst which showed that he {Mr. Tilak) could
have had no animus against the Government. Though
Mr. Lang, the Advocate-General, was scrupulously
fair, the Judge dehvered a strongly prejudiced charge
to the Jury. &quot; It seemed that the Judge and the
Advocate-General had interchanged places.&rdquo; &quot; Mr.
Justice Strachey freely referred to the famine and the
plague * * told about the employment of British troops
not being liked by the people * * passed on to
the Poona murders &quot; and &quot; without the least hesita-</p>
<ul>

</ul>
<p>7</p>
<p>98 LOKAMANYA TILAK</p>
<p>tion &quot; declared that &ldquo;the inevitable result was friction
and such a state of tension and excited feeling that»
no wonder it ultimately culminated in the mur###ders of Mr. Rand and Lieut. Ayerst.&rdquo; Of course he
did not mean to suggest in any way that there was re###lation of cause and effect between &quot; either of these
articles and those abominable murders.&rdquo; Still the
charge of the Judge tended to create strong prejudice
against the accused, who was pronounced by 6 jurors
to have committed sedition ; and the Judge after
complimenting the accused on his remarkable ability
and influence, sentenced him (14th September 1897), to
rigorous imprisonment for i8th months. A special appeal
was made to the Privy Council, but it was fruitless ;
and in the meantime Mr. Tilak was serving his sentence
in the Yeravda gaol.</p>
<p>Such was the result of the conflict — the first of its
kind in India — between the mighty Government of
Bombay with its immense resources and a solitary citi###zen with nothing but truth, courage and a nation&rsquo;s
sympathy to support him. Apparently it was a blow
to Mr. Tilak. Since this time his relations with Gov###ernment were uniformly unfriendly and as a conse###quence even those who should have stood by him,
generally kept him at an arm&rsquo;s length ; from this time
the influential clique that guided the course of the
Congress tried their best to put Mr. Tilak down.
Of course, there were leaders like the Hon. Mr. (now
Sir) Surendranath, whose relations with Mr. Tilak
stood the shock of this prosecution and conviction.
But the generality of the Moderate element shrank
from any further co-operation with him.</p>
<p>THE LOKAMANYA 99</p>
<p>But while in one direction Mr. Tilak lost much of
&ldquo;that influence which went with moderatism, there was an
immense accession of purity, strength and purpose to
the National cause. Patriotism was, by his example
and suffering lifted up from weak-kneed opportunism
and humble mendicity to the high level of religion.
Mr. Tilak&rsquo;s attitude was an object lesson to the people
in manly fight and courage and suffering came to be
recognised as the necessary qualities of a leader. The
political leadership was, up to this time, the property
of wealth, social position. Government patronage and
oratorical powers. Now came the demand for leadership
which would reveal tremendous powers of suffering
for the cause. Evidently Mr. Tilak gave a deathblow
to all conceptions of easy-going arm-chair leadership.
He no longer basked in official sunshine. He was now
no longer &lsquo;* Honourable &quot; — Rajamanya. He, however,
became, what was infinitely greater, the &quot; Lokamanya *&rsquo;
— the Honoured of the people.</p>
<p>The gravest feature of this prosecution was Mr.
Strachey&rsquo;s wholly untenable definition of &rsquo; sedition.*
According to him &rsquo; disaffection &rsquo; did not mean any posi###tive feeling of hatred etc. towards the Government. It
simply meant * want of affection.* Regarding this
and another aspect of the case, the Daily Chronicle
said : —</p>
<p>*&rsquo; Wildness, discontent, mischievous rubbish there
may be in plenty. But we have got on with it and we
shall get on with it again. Prove real sedition — above
all, conclusively connect it with crime — and we should
all favour sharp, stern punishment. But when it comes
to overhauling poems and constructing elaborated in-</p>
<p>100 LOKAMANYA TILAK</p>
<p>nuendoes from eulogies of picturesque and popular
bandits (?)&hellip; one feels that the Government are on.
perilous path.</p>
<p>&quot; There is one aspect of the &quot; sedition &quot; trials in
India which must not be lost sight of. And that is, the
new definition of &rsquo; disaffection &rsquo; enunciated by Mr.
Justice Strachey * * * According to him * disaffection*
may be seditious even though it be simply strong dis###approval of some omission on the part of Government.
We feel confident that such an interpretation of the law
would not be tolerated in England and if not speedily
over-ruled, may produce grave mischief in India.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was the considered opinion of an English news###paper and it amounts to a declaration that Mr. Tilak
was unjustly convicted by an incorrect, arbitrary and
novel interpretation of Sec. 124-A of the Penal Code.
Far from over-ruling this interpretation, the Imperial
Legislative Council gave legal status to it by amending
on i8th February 1898 the notorious section in the
teeth of Indian opposition.</p>
<p>In the chorus of sympathy that rang the air, the
scene at the National Congress is most significant.
When the favourite orator of India said in thundering
accents : —</p>
<p>&quot; I declare on my behalf and on behalf of the entire
Native Press that in our heart of hearts we believe Mr.
Tilak to be innocent of the charge brought against him.
The ends of technical justice may have been satisfied
but substantial justice has grievously failed.
My sympathy goes forth towards Mr. Tilak in
his prison home for whom the Nation is in tears — &ldquo;.
The whole assembly rose to their feet and expressed.</p>
<p>THE LOKAMANYA lOI</p>
<p>its feelings by cheering Mr. Tilak vociferously for seve###ral minutes, &quot; It was a unique and unprecedented de###-anonstration which ushered the advent of a new force in
Indian Politics.</p>
<p>Mr. Tilak was a guest of Her Majesty&rsquo;s gaol at
Yeravda till 6th September 1898, when he was released,
nearly six months prior to the termination of the pres###cribed period of eighteen months. This belated grace
was accelerated by the influentially signed petition pre###sented by the late Prof. Max Muller to H. M. the Queen
Victoria. Prof. Max Muller knew Mr. Tilak as the
author of the &rsquo; Orion &rsquo; and it was largely due to his
efforts that the sense of justice of Lord Sandhurst was
at last awakend. There was still a display of petty###mindedness in insisting upon an application for cle###mency from Mr. Tilak himself. But Mr. Tilak, who
had manfully rejected such a humiliating offer before
-he was convicted, was not the man to yield now.</p>
<p>Prof. Max Muller&rsquo;s interest in Mr. Tilak enabled the
latter to spend much of his enforced leisure profitably.
Mr. Tilak was allowed the use of candles for a couple
of hours at night and he utilized this opportunity to
push on his researches into Vedic antiquities. The gaol###diet reduced his weight from 135 lbs. to 104. A slight
improvement in his food again increased it to ii3lbs.
This diet was also responsible for diabetes which he
soon contracted and which more or less tormented him
to the end of his life. He was required to do hard work
indoors. It is really sad to contemplate the author of
the &quot; Arctic Home in the Vedas &quot; caning chairs and
painting walls. To Mr. Tilak, all work was equally in###teresting and he is said to have surprised the gaoler by</p>
<p>102 LOKAMANYA TILAK</p>
<p>his improvements in the mixing up of several colours^
The dull monotony of prison-life would have broken a*,
less ardent spirit. But like a Yogi, Mr. Tilak had with###drawn all thoughts from the living present and had;
concentrated them on the vicissitudes of the ancient
Aryans. His happiest moments were those when ob###scure Vedic passages yielded their meaning to his
searching intellect, and when he could correctly inter###pret the verse commencing with <em>Taneedahani hahulafi&rsquo;</em>
yasan in the Rig Veda (VII, 76, 3) he could not sleep
for joy. Mr. Tilak&rsquo;s prison-life shows that he was pos###sessed not only of the qualities of the soldier and the
scholar but also those of the sage, who has transcended^
pleasure and plain, happiness and misery and looks at
the petty struggles of the world from the sublime
heights of his controlled mind.</p>
<p>The sudden and unexpected release of Mr. Tilak sent
a thrill of joy throughout the country. He came out
of the gaol a broken man — broken physically,
never mentall3^ or morally. Old age put its inefface###able marks upon his face. His first duty, therefore;.,
was to recoup his health. He spent a few months at.
his favourite sanitorium, the Sinhgad, hallowed by the
exploits of Shivaji. Then he attended the Congress###(Dec. 1898) at Madras ; thence he went to Ceylon and)
returned Poona in February 1899. During his tours in
Ceylon, he pushed on his study of the Buddhistic cul-###ture and philisophy, commenced as early as 1890.</p>
<p>Though the excitement of the Anglo-Indian mind
had much to do with the troubles of Mr, Tilak, stil!
when the case was going on, the Advocate-General had</p>
<ul>
<li>Vide P. 8^ {The Arctic Home in the Vedas).</li>
</ul>
<p>THE LOKAMANYA I03</p>
<p>distinctly admitted that the charge against Mr. Tilak
had nothing to do with the Poona murders. In spite
of this clear admission, the notorious Globe had the
effrontery to remark that &quot; Tilak &quot; — mark the omission
of Mr. — had directed, if not organised, the campaign
of murder and that the Western Presidency had been
permeated by seditious conspiracies of a most
dangerous character with the arch-plotter Tilak as the
head. The Times of India published these remarks ;
but when hauled up before the Magistrate for defama###tion, made suitable amends by tendering a graceful
apology which was as gracefully accepted. A suit
was filed against the Globe in England, and the paper
which had reviled this Poona Brahmin to eat its own
words and tender an unreserved apology.</p>
<p>It was reserved for Sir Valentine Chirol to hold Mr.
Tilak morally responsible for the Poona murders ; and
though Mr. Tilak failed in his attempts to legally dis###prove the subtle accusation, still all India holds him
morally innocent of the charge. Directly or indirectly
morally or actually, Mr. Tilak had nothing to do with
murders ; and the only murder he ever talked about was
that of Afzulkhan, in connection with the Shivaji Festi###val. Mr. Tilak&rsquo;s life was an open book, on which the
word * patriotism &rsquo; was writ large ; and if the courts of
justice made the mistake of confounding patriotism
with sedition — well, he was prepared to pay the price.
As for murder — political or otherwise — it was absolu###tely foreign to his nature.</p>
