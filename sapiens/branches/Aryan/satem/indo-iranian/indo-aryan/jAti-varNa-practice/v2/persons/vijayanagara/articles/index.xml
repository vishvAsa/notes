When Krishna Raya was ruling, the Chola country was ruled by Virashekhara Chola and Pandya country was ruled by Chandrashekhara Pandya. But, Virashekhara invaded Pandya country and ejected the Pandya out. The Pandya went to Vijayanagara and petitioned Krishna Raya. Krishna Raya chastised Nagama Nayaka as the Tamil Country was under his mandate, how did things go this bad? And he asked Nagama Nayaka to take an army personally and fix the things. He told that the Chola country will have to be annexed into the royal territory and order should be restored in the Pandya country.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;458 years ago, on 26th January 1565 CE,+++(Isn&amp;rsquo;t it 23rd??)+++ Battle of Talikota was lost by the Vijayanagar army under Aliya Rama Raya. We shall look back on the last decades of the great city which was destroyed by barbarians after this defeat.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Emperor Achyuta Deva Raya died in 1542CE. His son, a minor, became the emperor with his uncle Salakaraju Chinna Tirumala as regent. Regent was not content with his position. He usurped the throne by killing his sister and her son, the emperor. Salakaraju killed the younger brother of Achyuta as well as his entire family. Only one young boy, Sadashiva Raya, escaped this massacre as he was at Gutti with Aliya Rama Raya (son-in-law of Krishna Deva Raya) and the widows of Krishna Deva Raya. Rama Raya and his mothers-in-law were aghast with this barbarity of Salakaraju. Many nobles also opposed the tyrant usurper. Salakaraju invited Bijapur Sultan and declared the empire as vassal of the Sultan. He made the Sultan sit on the throne of the Empire.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
