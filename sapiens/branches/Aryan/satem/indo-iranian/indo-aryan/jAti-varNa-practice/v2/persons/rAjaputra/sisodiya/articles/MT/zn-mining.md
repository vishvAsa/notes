The sAmoli inscription from ~646CE mentions the guhila king shIlAditya and a band of rich V3s led by jentaka shreShThin had settled in his kingdom. They started a mine at araNayakUpagiri. It is not clear what they were mining, but based on the geology they were probably mining Zn (/&Pb). The said V3 is mentioned as having built a temple to vanadurgA in the region, a deity who continued to be worshiped in Mewar
