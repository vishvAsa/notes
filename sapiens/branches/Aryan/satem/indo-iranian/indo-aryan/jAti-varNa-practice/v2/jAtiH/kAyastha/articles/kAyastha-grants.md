## Grants
This brings us to the point that Kayasthas were also the benefactor of these grants themselves. For instance, members of the family of Suhadadeva enjoyed multiple village-grants for several generations beginning with his ancestor Thakur Jajuka in the 10th century. Grants to these families were in lieu of military and bureaucratic services. Such hereditary land grants were also given to Kayastha families by other dynasties too. We will document major families of such grants in separate  threads.

Curiously enough, we also see instances of Brahmadeya type land grants given to Kayasthas during this period, for purely religious reasons. Such gifts to non-brahmins were rare, perhaps non-existent. Kayasthas seem to be the only non-Brahmin group to have benefited from grants of this nature. Notably, a king of the Kachhapaghata dynasty of Gwalior named Bhuvanapala has been described as "कायस्थ-वंश-विपिन-अंबुधर" or "the rain cloud to the forest of the Kayastha race;" in other words, the cherisher of Kayasthas.

Based on all of the evidence presented thus far, Chitrarekha Gupta remarks that medieval kings established "Kayastha-colonies" along the lines of Brahmana-agraharas.
