- Before the muslim invasion, the kShatriya varNa was widespread - even in south India.
- vIra ballALa the hoysala, famously told malik kafur that he is willing to give up everything except his sacred thread.
- chulavamsha clearly describes the buddhist sinhalese king parAkrama bAhu of lanka undergoing upanayanam ([MT](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2012/05/30/some-inquiries-into-the-shrilankan-past/), [GB](https://books.google.com/books?id=RvuDlhpvvHwC&pg=PA37&lpg=PA37&dq=parakramabahu+upanayana&source=bl&ots=b1ZnfUhpYj&sig=qrqioDBgT8uwLOa0r3fSlLdGNfk&hl=sa&sa=X&ved=0CB0Q6AEwAGoVChMIwOD90rn5xgIViTOICh1PkwWv#v=onepage&q=parakramabahu%20upanayana&f=false)).
- the kadamba-s of karNATaka were famously brAhmaNa-s converted to kShatriya-s.
- Many dynasties of India, including south Indian ones such as chAlukya, pANDya and choLa kings conducted vedic yAga-s allowed for kShatriya-s such as rAjasUya and ashvamedha.
    - Some images, supposedly of these kings, show a yajJNOpavIta ([NVP_F](http://www.frontline.in/static/html/fl2819/stories/20110923281908400.htm), [IMG](http://i.imgur.com/Fk8LeLT.jpg)), while others don't (simhaviShNu-pallava [IMG](http://i.imgur.com/OJZIvJ8.jpg), [IMG2](http://i.imgur.com/IHak7fl.jpg)).
- It is quite possible that the vijayanagara kings were not invested with the yajnopavIta - they're not known to have performed the vedic sacrifices. (This despite their great scholarship in sanskrit, patronage of temples etc..)
- Names ending with "varma" try to claim ceremonial (not just de-facto) kShatriya status - that suffix is prescribed by the dharmashAstra-s for kShatriya-s. mArtANDa-varma, narasimhavarma pallava etc..
