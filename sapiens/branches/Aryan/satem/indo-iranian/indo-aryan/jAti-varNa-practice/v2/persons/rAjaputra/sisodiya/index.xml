      <description>&lt;p&gt;Fateh Singh of Mewar was the only Maharaja to not attend the Delhi Durbar, both of 1903 and 1911. Then in 1921, when Edward, Prince of Wales, son of King George V and Queen Mary, visited Udaipur, he refused to receive him, citing illness and instead sent his son. This left him at odds with the British, thereafter, under the garb of ignoring a social unrest in Mewar, on 28 July 1921, his powers were curtailed and he was formally deposed, he was however allowed to retain his title, the effective power was handed to his son and heir, Bhupal Singh.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

On his deathbed, Udai Singh II named Jagmal Singh as the next Maharana. Jagmal was to be crowned as Maharana of Udaipur in 1572; however, the nobles of the court instead crowned Maharana Pratap. Jagmal left Mewar and went into the service of the Mughal Subedar in Ajmer, who gave him shelter. Later he met Akbar and was given the jagir of Jahazpur as a gift. Sometime before 1581, he married the daughter of Maharao Man Singh II of Sirohi and became the co-ruler of Sirohi in 1581.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
