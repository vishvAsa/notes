Kshatriyas of Kerala belonged to Vishvamitra Gotra, so Kshatriya men and women never married each other as it will be sagotra union. Hence, Kshatriya women always married  Brahmins (non-Vishvamitra) and Kshatriya men including Maharajas married aristocratic Nair women. While the Kshatriya men could visit their Nair wives in their Tharavad, the Brahmin husbands of Kshatriya women stayed in their wife's royal household since the wife had no place in husband's Illam in matrilineal setup.
