The arbuda, Ranpur and Kumbhalgarh inscriptions mention a guhila king choDa/choDasiMha who ruled ~1127-1138 CE. Me and a friend had a discussion about the origin of his name. It depends on whether you take it to be tatpuruSha or bahuvrIhi (sic). 

One possibility is that he was lion to the chora-s (thieves).  
The other possibility is that he was a lion of the choDa-s i.e., the choLa-s. In favor of this in the mount arbuda inscription his name is just choDa. This would then be a case of the fame of the choLa-s reaching the north to become a personal name. From 980-1070 was the 90 year acme of the choLa empire. It is conceivable that the memory of their great kings like rAjarAja, rAjendra and rAjAdhirAja was behind the epithet, the lion of the choDa-s. Much later a marAThA ghorpaDa bahAdur was also named choLarAja. They were distant relatives of mahArAja shivAjI.
