Revision in the chronology of First Pandyan Empire rulers

Identifying the exact dates of Tamil rulers of ancient and early medieval period is always fraught with multiple problems. Most of the inscriptions do not give the exact dates but merely mention the regnal year of the ruler. Some of the rulers have not left us with inscriptions and are known only from inscriptions/copper plates of later period. We do not have any records of Kadungon, the founder of the post-Kalabhran Pandyan Dynasty. His achievements are known only from Velvikkudi copper plates which were inscribed more than a century after his death. 

The dates presumed for various rulers of First Pandyan Empire in post-Kadungon era have been based on certain assumptions and biases of the scholars who have written on their reigns. We are concerned with the dates of the following rulers: 



1. Arikesari Parankusa Maravarman
2. Kochadaiyan Ranadhiran
3. Maravarman Rajasimhan (Rajasimha I)
4. Jatila Parantaka (Parantaka Nedunjadaiyan - Varaguna I)
5. Srimaran Srivallabhan

Dr Nagasamy gives the date of Arikesari Parankusa Maravarman as 650-700 CE, Ranadhiran as 700-730CE and Maravarman Rajasimhan as 730-768CE[^1]. These dates are also based on certain assumptions about the Nayanmars’ period (especially Sambandar and Appar) and the same being used to arrive at the date of Arikesari Parankusa Maravarman. Other scholars also tend to place Arikesari in the second half of 7<sup>th</sup> century CE. We shall see that certain direct evidences from the available copper plate and stone inscriptions have been ignored by these scholars. Also, more emphasis has been placed on hagiographical tales from 12<sup>th</sup> century CE and less importance has been given to the historical references found in the literature of the Nayanmars and Azhvars – which is patently unwarranted. We shall start with the date of Arikesari Parankusa Maravarman.

Arikesari Parankusa Maravarman

There are two stone inscriptions and one copper plate inscription available from his reign. He is famed for his grand victory in Battle of Nelveli. Sundarar refers to him as Nelveli Venra Ninra Seer Nedumaran (Nedumaran referring to his title as Maravarman). His Ilayanputhur copper plate does not talk about Nelveli victory[^2]. This sole copper plate from his reign was issued in his 36<sup>th</sup> year of reign and refers to his having won several victories (no mention of battle names) and his having built several temples for Siva (named after the ruler as Arikesari Isvaram) apart from his having performed Hiranyagarbha and Tulabharam ceremonies[^3]. 

Enadi stone inscription of his reign mentions Nelveli and Puliyur battles by name[^4]. It also states that the king did Hiranyagarbha twice and Tulabharam once[^5]. His Madurai Vaigai bed stone inscription[^6] [^7] simply mentions that he defeated enemies, donated several agraharams to Brahmanas and gave mahadanas like Hiranyagarbha, Gosahasra and Tulabharam. It refers that a sluice in Vaigai was set up by the king and named Arikesari (after himself). 

No additional information regarding his reign or battles are available from inscriptions of his era. But 2 copper plate grants by later Pandya rulers give valuable information about his reign which may help us in identifying his period more firmly. 

The Velvikkudi Copper plates[^8] give following information about Arikesari Parankusa Maravarman[^9]:



1. Attained victory in the Battle of Pazhi
2. Defeated Vilveli’s sea like army in the Battle of Nelveli 
3. Defeated Paravars (Fishermen of Southern Tamil Nadu Coast) and people of Kurunadu
4. Attained victory in the Battle of Sennilam (it may also simply mean land with red soil, a generic reference to battlefield where blood soaked soil turns red)
5. Defeated Kerala ruler multiple times
6. Captured Kerala ruler’s fortified city, Puliyur, within one day
7. Gave donations to Brahmanas and the poor through several Hiranyagarbhas and Tulabharams

Of these, the Enadi inscription refers to the battles of Nelveli and Puliyur. His donations are praised in every inscription. 

Larger Sinnamanur Copper plates of Rajasimha II give following information about our ruler[^10]:



1. Defeated Villavan in Nelveli 
2. Defeated Pallavan at Sankaramangai

Some scholars claim that the victor of Nelveli called as Parankusa in this copper plate is Rajasimha I. This is a baseless claim and we shall see why this claim ought to be rejected in later paragraphs. What ought to be noted is that  a Parankusa is identified as victor of Nelveli battle in both copper plates. No other Pandya is called as Parankusa in the first Pandyan Empire period except Arikesari Parankusa Maravarman. This Parankusa had defeated Pallavas in a battle at Sankaramangai. It must be noted that these battles of Nelveli and Sankaramangai are mentioned in Pallava copper plates as well. A comparison of information in the Pandyan and Pallava copper plates enable us to arrive at a proper period for the reign of Arikesari Parankusa Maravarman. 

Let us now look at what the Pallava Copper plates state about these battles. Udayendiram Plates[^11] give details about the Nelveli and Sankaramangai battles from Pallava perspective. The plates mention about the services rendered by Udayachandra, a Pallava general who ruled the Vilvala on the banks of Vegavati River (near Kanchipuram – modern Villivalam). Udayachandra claims to have defeated the enemies of Pallavamalla Nandivarma Pallava in various battles at Nandipura, Nimbavana, Chutavana, Sankaragrama, Nellore, Nelveli, Suravarundur and many other places[^12]. It is specifically mentioned that a Sabara King Udayana was killed by Udayachandra in Nelveli battle and that this was a terrible battle ‘which could hardly be entered by a common man’. Thus, the grant indirectly concedes that the Nelveli battle did not go completely in favour of the Pallava despite Udayachandra managing to kill one of the leaders in the opposing army. It also states that Pandyas were defeated at Mannikudi (we shall come across this later). It must be noted that Udayachandra was the lord of Vilvala town – which might have made him to be called ‘Vilveli’ in the Pandyan Velvikkudi grant. Sankaramangai of Pandyan Larger Sinnamanur grant is mentioned as Sankaragrama in this Pallava grant. Thus, towards the end of his reign, Arikesari Parankusa Maravarman fought against Nandivarman I Pallavamalla. The only copper plate grant of Arikesari is from his 36<sup>th</sup> year of reign. Said plates do not mention about Nelveli victory and this can be taken to mean that this battle must have been fought in the final years of his reign. Since this battle has been the defining moment of his career as seen from all later records about this ruler (be it in royal charters or in bhakti literature), the silence of the Ilayanputhur grant about this battle can be taken as evidence for the battle having been fought after the 36<sup>th</sup> year of his reign. Saiva hagiography also suggests that the battle was fought when he was elderly – since Sambandar is said to have cured him of hunched back before this battle.

Given that Pallavamalla had reigned from 731CE to 796CE, we may tentatively place the reign of Arikesari Parankusa Maravarman between 690-740CE spanning five decades. Next in line comes his son, Kochadaiyan Ranadhiran.

Kochadaiyan Ranadhiran

Velvikkudi plates mention the following achievements of Kochadaiyan Ranadhiran[^13]:



1. Won victories in Marudur, Senkodi and Puthancode battles. 
2. Defeated maharathas in the battle of Mangalapuram (Mangalore)
3. Became ruler of all 3 Tamil kingdoms (made Cheras and Chozhas as his vassals) – inscribed the emblems of these 3 Tamil kingdoms in faraway lands (like Mangalore?)
4. Held titles like Vanavan (Chera title), Sembiyan Chozhan (Chozha title), Madhura Karunadakan (ruled parts of Karnata country) and Kongar Koman (Ruler of Kongu country). 

Thus, we can say that Ranadhira had occupied vast tracts of present-day Tamil Nadu and Kerala apart from parts of Southern Karnataka. Chozha land was under the rule/suzerainty of Pallavas since the time of Simhavishnu and Mahendravarman I. Had Ranadhira reigned during 700-730CE as assumed by Nagasamy and many other scholars, then we would have to presume that he conquered Chozha territory from Rajasimha Pallava and that he managed to expand his influence into Kongu lands as well as southern Karnataka without Rajasimha Pallava checking his ambitions. There is no evidence for Rajasimha Pallava having lost territories to Pandyas or any other rulers. Hence, the theory that Ranadhira ruled as a contemporary of Rajasimha Pallava must be discarded. We may presume that Ranadhira ruled between 740-744CE or thereabouts. He could have ruled as joint ruler with his father, Arikesari Parankusa Maravarman, as well for some time prior to 740CE. Utilizing the weakened nature of Pallava monarch in the post Rajasimha era, Arikesari Maravarman and Ranadhira had expanded the territories of Pandyan Empire by encroaching into Pallava territories. 

There are reasons to believe that Pandyas must have supported the rival Pallava throne claimant, Chitramaya, against Nandivarman I Pallavamalla. Udayachandra had killed this rival to the throne and safeguarded the right of Nandivarma Pallavamalla. That Nandivarma Pallava and his general, Udayachandra, had to face 4 generations of Pandyan rulers is clear from the large number of battles that they had to fight against the Pandyas throughout Pallavamalla’s reign. The last of these 4 Pandyan rulers outlived Pallavamalla by almost 2 decades. Both Arikesari Parankusa as well as his son, Ranadhira, must have been beyond their prime by the time Pallavamalla sat on the throne in 731CE. Whereas Pallavamalla was a mere 12-year-old boy in 731CE and reigned for 65 years till 796CE. Hence, we see that he fought against 4 generations of Pandyan rulers. 

Maravarman Rajasimhan

Maravarman Rajasimhan was the son of Ranadhiran. It is presumed that he could be a grandson of Rajasimha Pallava and that he was named after his maternal grandfather. He also held the title Ter-Maran which was used by his paternal grandfather, Arikesari Parankusa Maravarman as seen from his Ilayanputhur grant. 

Velvikkudi copper plates[^14] mention the following achievements of this ruler:



1. Won victories in Neduvayal, Kurumadai, Mannikurichi (mentioned as Mannaikudi in Udayendiram Plates as per which Pallavas won victory over Pandyas here – most probably a stalemate battle), Tirumangai, Poovaloor and Kodumbalur
2. Defeated Pallava at Kuzhumbur
3. Defeated enemies at Periyalur and conquered Mazhakongam territory across the Kaveri
4. Worshipped Siva at the temple in Pandikkodumudi (to the north-west of Karur-Vanchi) and offered gold as well as precious stones to the Lord there
5. Established marital alliance with the Ganga ruler
6. Offered donations through rituals of Gosahasra, Hiranyagarbha and Tulabharam
7. Repaired and renovated the fortifications of Madurai (Koodal), Karur (Vanchi) and Trichy (Uraiyur – Kozhi)

Maravarman Rajasimha seems to have consolidated the victories earned by his father. That he renovated the fortifications of the capitals of all 3 Tamil kingdoms shows that he had control over these places. Kodumudi is in Chera’s Kongu territory and is to the northwest of Karur-Vanchi. The town must have gained the name of Pandik-Kodumudi after Rajasimha worshipped at the Siva temple of that town by offering lots of gold and precious stones. Otherwise, there is no reason why a town in Chera territory will be named after Pandyas.

Of the battles mentioned here, Mannaikurichi is mentioned in Udayendiram Copper plates of Pallavas as mentioned above. Tirumangai Azhwar has sung about the prowess of Nandivarman I Pallavamalla in his song on Vaikuntha Perumal temple of Kanchipuram (Tirup-parameccura-vinnagaram). In the third stanza, he refers to the battle of Mannai as well. In the second stanza, he claims that Pallavamalla defeated ‘ter-mannu-tennavan’ which seems to refer to the title Ter-Maran of the Pandyan ruler (tennavan). This might be a reference to Arikesari Parankusa or most probably his grandson, Maravarman Rajasimha.

Udayendiram Grant was issued around 752CE and by that time, Pallavamalla’s hold on his throne was well established since his rival claimant had been killed already. In the very next year, we find that Pallavamalla issued a grant at Kasakudi near Karaikal – which shows that he had managed to regain Chozha lands by then. We find inscriptions of Dantivarman, son of Pallavamalla, at Thiruvellarai and Pudukkottai[^15] which confirm that the Chozha lands largely continued to be under Pallava rule even after Pallavamalla’s reign despite a few reverses on some occasions. Rajasimha must have renovated the fortifications of Uraiyur before 752CE as a part of his preparations against Pallavamalla. From the Udayendiram plates, we come to know that the Tamil rulers had jointly besieged Pallavamalla at Nandipura. Thus, under Pandya suzerainty, the other two rulers seem to have fought against the Pallavas. Pandyas gained Chera-Kongu and parts of Southern Chozha lands (to the south of Kaveri) after the end of this prolonged war against the Pallavas. Rajasimha ruled till 768CE. Next ruler is perhaps the greatest of the monarchs of First Pandyan Empire, Jatila Parantaka aka Parantaka Nedunjadaiyan.

Jatila Parantaka (Parantaka Nedunjadaiyan / Varaguna I)

Jatila Parantaka is the donor of Velvikkudi Copper Plate grant which was issued in the third year of his reign. He had also issued 2 other copper plate grants viz. Srivaramangalam Plates (Madras Museum Plates) and Smaller Sinnamanur Plates. His reign began in 768CE as evidenced from certain stone inscription of his era in Tirupparankundram[^16]. Velvikkudi plates provide the following information about him[^17]:



1. Drove away the Pallava king and won the battle of Pennagadam
2. Defeated Ay ruler and Kurumbars

Srivaramangala plates give further information about him as follows[^18]:



1. Won battles at Vellur, Vinnam and Sezhiyakkudi
2. Defeated Atiyan (ruler of Tagadur aka Dharmapuri) in the battles of Ayiraveli Ayirur and Pugazhiyur
3. Defeated Kerala and Pallava rulers who came in support of Atiyan
4. Defeated and imprisoned the King of Kongu country
5. Conquered territories upto Ganga kingdom (Southern Karnataka)
6. Built a huge temple for Vishnu at Perur 
7. Captured Vizhinjam from Ay ruler
8. Built a huge fort at Karavandapuram
9. He was a Parama-Vaishnava
10. Srivaramangalam village was given as brahmadeya by him to a Brahmana named Sujjata Bhatta from Magadha desha in the 17<sup>th</sup> year of his reign (785 CE)

Several inscriptions of this rulers call him as Maranjadaiyan (Jadaiyan, son of Maran – Jatila Parantaka, the son of Maravarman Rajasimha). The Manur Inscription[^19] of this ruler gives a high regnal year of 36 years. The Eruvadi inscription[^20] gives the highest regnal year of the ruler found till now – 43 years. Thus, he had ruled till 811CE at the very least and perhaps some more years. Sri Nilakantha Sastri surmises that he must have ruled till 815CE[^21]. He was succeeded by his son, Srimaran Srivallabhan.

Srimaran Srivallabhan

There are some scholars who prefer to insert a Rajasimha and a Varaguna Pandya in between Jatila Parantakan and Srimaran Srivallabhan. But such assumptions are baseless and proved wrong by Dalavaypuram copper plates. Dalavaypuram grant calls Srimaran Srivallabhan as the son of Parantaka[^22]. It also calls the father of Srimaran as Sri Parantakan Kochadaiyan (Jatila Parantaka – Parantaka Nedunjadaiyan) who fought against Pallava ruler in Karur with his elephant corps[^23]. That there was a battle between Pandya ruler and Nandivarman II Pallavamalla is recorded by Tirumangai Azhvar as well[^24]. Thus, Srimaran was the son of Jatila Parantaka who is also called as Varaguna in Larger Sinnamanur plates (Velvikkudi and Srivaramangalam plates give him the title Srivara which must have expanded to Sri Varaguna). 

Srimara Srivallabhan was a military genius who won several victories against various enemies during his reign. Dalavaypuram grant gives following information about him[^25] :



1. He won the battle of Kunnoor
2. He conquered Lanka
3. Defeated and killed Chera king at Vizhinjam
4. Defeated Pallava king at Kadalanur (Cuddalore?)
5. Defeated Chera, Chozha, Kupaka and northern forces in the battle of Kudandhai (Kumbhakonam)

Larger Sinnamanur Plates give following information[^26]



1. He defeated Mayapandya (a rival claimant to Pandya throne), Kerala (Chera), Sinhalan (Lanka), Pallava and Vallabha (Chalukya) rulers. 
2. Defeated Ganga, Pallava, Chozha, Kalinga and Magadha in the battle of Kumbhakonam

His son, Varaguna Pandyan (Varaguna II) started his reign in 862CE. Hence, we may presume that Srimaran Srivallabhan ruled till 862CE and was succeeded by his son in that year[^27].

Varaguna Pandyan (Varaguna II)

From the era of Varaguna Pandyan, we see the gradual fall of Pandyan Empire due to a coalition between Pallavas, Chozhas and Gangas among others. Initially, there seems to have been a peaceful relationship between Varaguna Pandyan and Nandivarma III of the Pallava dynasty as evidenced from the inscription in Lalgudi[^28] which is dated to the 5<sup>th</sup> regnal year of Varaguna’s reign (867CE). Sri KV Subrahmanya Aiyer had dated a related Lalgudi inscription to 824 CE[^29] based on his assumption that there were 2 rulers named Rajasimha and Varaguna between the reigns of Jatila Parantaka and Srimaran. But we have shown above that such assumption is wrong since Dalavaypuram plates clearly convey that Srimaran was the son of Jatila Parantakan and that he succeeded Jatila Parantakan. Moreover, Nandivarman III reigned only after 847 CE whereas Sri KV Subrahmanya Aiyer has wrongly presumed the dates of all Pallava rulers from Nandivarman II Pallavamalla (whose reign is wrongly dated to 696-761CE by him)[^30]. Hence, we may ignore this date. The calendrical details mentioned in this inscription matches with Dec 6, 875CE as well which indeed falls in the 13<sup>th</sup> year of the reign of this king. 

Post Nandivarman III’s death circa 869CE, Varaguna II seems to have invaded the Pallava territories and had occupied large parts of its southern districts. There are reasons to believe that Varaguna II had invaded Pallava territories in support of Nripatungavarman who was one of the contestants for the throne of the Pallava empire, but he was eventually defeated at Sripurambiyam by a coalition of Aparajita Pallava, Ganga King Prithvipati and Aditya Chozha between 880CE and 890 CE[^31]. Ganga Prithvipati lost his life in this battle and later by 890CE, Aparajita Pallava was defeated and killed by Aditya Chozha which led to the setting of the Pallava empire and the rise of Chozha empire[^32]. 

Post the crushing defeat in Sripurambiyam, Varaguna seems to have retreated from active rule and his brother, Parantaka Viranarayana started ruling from the Pandyan throne. Parantaka Viranarayana tried to revive the fortunes of Pandyan empire by defeating various enemies on his frontiers and some rebels within the empire. But his son, Maravarman Rajasimhan II was thoroughly defeated by Parantaka Chozha I and the sun set on the First Pandyan Empire with this catastrophic defeat. 

Dates of Nayanmars:

Some scholars may oppose the chronology proposed here by referring to the popular dates assigned to some of the Nayanmars (Sambandar, Appar, Sundarar and Siruthondar). Appar is generally considered as a contemporary of Mahendravarman I (600-630CE). Sambandar and Siruthondar are considered to be contemporaries of Narasimhavarman I (630-668CE). This is generally taken as evidence for Arikesari Parankusa (Nelveli vendra ninra seer Nedumaran aka Kun Pandyan) to have reigned in later half of seventh century. The entire chronology of these Nayanmars is based on certain hagiographies in Periya Puranam and interpretation of one inscription from Tiruchirappalli. We shall look at this ‘evidence’ as well. Since the hagiography was written centuries later, such text cannot be taken at face value. A more scholarly approach would be to analyse the available literature of these saints (the first 7 Tirumurais) and identify such historical information which may be used to date their period. Hagiographies can be useful only to the extent where they do not contradict direct evidence.

Tirujnanasambandar

We shall begin with Sambandar. Sambandar does not refer to any Pallava monarch. But he does mention that the three crowned rulers of Tamil lands (Chera, Chozha and Pandya) together worshipped Shiva in the temples of Tirumookkeeccharam (Uraiyur in Trichy – in Tevaram 2-120) and Tiruppoovanam (near Madurai – in Tevaram 1-64). This suggests a period when the three crowned rulers of Tamil lands were in alliance. In his verses on Thiru-Alavay (Madurai – Tevaram 3-39-4&6), Sambandar refers to 11 Jaina ascetics by name – Candusenan, Indusenan, Dharmasenan, Kandusenan, Kanaksenan, Kanakanandi, Pushpanandi, Pavananandi, Kumanama-sunakanandi, Gunakanandi and Divananandi. Of these Pushpanandi[^33], Kanankanandi[^34][^35], Pavanandi (Pavananandi of the Tevaram?)[^36]and Gunanandi (Gunakanandi of the Tevaram?)[^37] are mentioned in the Kalugumalai Jain bed inscriptions which are dated to the second half of 8<sup>th</sup> century. During the early decades of the reign of Nandivarma II Pallavamalla, we see that the three crowned Tamil rulers acted as a coalition and besieged Pallavamalla in Nandipura (see endnote xii). Kochadaiyan Ranadhiran has been praised as ruler of the three kingdoms while his son, Maravarman Rajasimha, had renovated and refurbished the fortifications of the three capital cities (Uraiyur, Madurai and Karur-Vanji) in Velvikkudi plates. Thus, we may safely conclude that Sambandar belonged to circa 730-746 CE when the Pandyas had united the three kingdoms against Pallavas and were leading wars against the new monarch on Pallava throne, Pallavamalla. That some of the Jain ascetics mentioned by Sambandar are recorded in the inscriptions of Kalugumalai from second half of 8<sup>th</sup> century also supports this hypothesis. 

Moreover, we had seen earlier how Kodumudi must have gained the name Pandik-kodumudi after Maravarman Rajasimhan had worshipped at the place and offered gifts – as mentioned in Velvikkudi plates. It must be noted that Sambandar calls Kodumudi as Pandi-kodumudi in Tevaram 2.69. There is no reason as to why this town in Chera-Kongu territory would have been called Pandik-kodumudi in the mid-7th century. From the available works of Sambandar, we can see that there are reasons to consider him as belonging to mid-8<sup>th</sup> century CE. There is nothing in his works which forces us to give him a date of mid-7<sup>th</sup> century CE.

Appar aka Thirunavukkarasar

Much is made of the Tiruchirappalli inscription of Mahendravarman I where it is interpreted that Mahendra records his conversion to Shaivism from some other faith. Despite what Dr Nagasamy tries to claim[^38], the inscription does not refer to the conversion of the king directly. What the verse can be taken to mean is as follows:

“In the reign of the ruler named Gunabhara who is a worshipper of Linga, let the knowledge - which has turned back from hostile behaviour/conduct – be spread for a long time in the world through the Linga (established in that temple)”. 

The translation by Mr E Hultzsch[^39] is most proper. We may say that Mahendravarman aimed to turn the world to proper conduct/knowledge which may mean Shaiva religion or dharma in general. But this inscription certainly does not prove or state his conversion from Jainism to Shaivism as mentioned by Dr Nagasamy.  

Scholars have based themselves on the hagiography as mentioned in Periya-Puranam with a healthy amount of ‘assumptions’ and ‘interpretations’ to arrive at their conclusion that Mahendravarman I must be the king who was reconverted by Appar. Periya Puranam gives the story as follows:



* Appar (originally named Marunikkiyar) became the head of Patalipura monastery (in Cuddalore) with the title Dharmasena
* Due to efforts of his sister Tilakavati and divine interference, he re-converted back to Shaivism
* Jainas complained to the Kadava (Pallava) ruler who persecuted the apostate
* Appar was saved from the persecutions due to divine intervention
* The Kadava gave up Jaina faith and embraced Shaivism as the true faith
* The ruler destroyed Jaina monastery in Patalipura (Cuddalore) and used the stones to build a Siva temple named ‘Gunadharavicharam’ in Tiruvadigai (in recent editions, this is changed as ‘Gunabharavicharam’ to match with the Tiruchirappalli inscription’s title for Mahendravarman I)

It is claimed that the Pallava used materials of the destroyed monasteries to build a Siva temple named Gunadharavicharam at Tiruvadi. This is not possible in Mahendravarman’s era because stone structures were not built in that period. Materials from destroyed brick structure cannot be reused either. One may ask several questions based on the hagiography in Periya Puranam which will prove that the ruler cannot be Mahendravarman I. Appar is said to have been a very young boy when his sister’s fiancée died battling northern invaders. This can be taken as referring to invasion by Chalukya Pulikesi II. In that case, Appar would not have crossed even 20 years of age by the time of Mahendravarman’s death since the Chalukya invasion is considered to have occurred around 618-619CE[^40]. Thus, going by the hagiographic claims, Appar could not have converted Mahendravarman I in the early years of his reign. But we need not base all the arguments on the hagiographic claims. Rather, as stated earlier, we shall look at the literary works of Appar to arrive at an informed conclusion regarding his era. 

Appar uses the adjective/title ‘Rajasimha’ for Siva in Tevaram 4-15-7. One of the Azhvars, Tirumazhisai, refers to Vishnu as Gunapparan (Gunabharan) in his work, Nanmukan Tiruvantati (93) and it is taken as evidence for the Azhvar being a contemporary of Mahendravarman I who had the title Gunabhara[^41]. Applying this logic, Appar must be dated as belonging to the 8<sup>th</sup> century in which Rajasimha Pallava and Maravarman Rajasimhan ruled. Moreover, in Tevaram 5-81, he refers to Kodumudi as Tirup-pandik-kodumudi 4 times and once as Tiruk-kodumudi. As seen earlier, the temple town must have gained that name only after the town was conquered and endowed by Maravarman Rajasimha Pandya. Since Maravarman ruled in the middle of the 8<sup>th</sup> century, Appar must have lived till such time. 

As per hagiography, Appar was elderly in age when Sambandar had his upanayanam (sacred thread ceremony). Sambandar is dated to circa 730-746CE. Appar’s birth would have been circa 670CE. Such date would also explain the hagiography claim about a northern invasion when he was a boy. In 674CE, Vikramaditya I Chalukya had invaded Pallava empire and had reached the banks of Kaveri after conquering Kanchi. As for the Pallava who supposedly tried to persecute Appar, it must have been a vassal named Gunadhara from a collateral branch who ruled Cuddalore region. 

Siruthondar

Periya Puranam claims that Siruthondar was originally named Paranjothi. It is claimed that he was a great warrior who went on an expedition to Vatapi. It is generally presumed that Paranjothi must have accompanied Narasimhavarman I on his expedition to Vatapi in 642CE. Since Siruthondar, Appar and Sambandar met each other, scholars try to date Appar and Sambandar to mid-7<sup>th</sup> century. There was another expedition to Vatapi in the reign of Paramesvaraman I Pallava which must have occurred in the last decade of the 7<sup>th</sup> century CE. That Paramesvaraman I captured/destroyed Vatapi is mentioned by his son, Rajasimha Pallava, in Kailasanatha temple inscriptions where he is called Ranarasika pura (Vatapi – the capital city of Ranarasika aka Vikramaditya I Chalukya) mardana[^42]. Hence, Siruthondar must have been a contemporary of Appar and Sambandar. 

As we can see, there is no reason to invent a seventh century date for Arikesari Parankusa based on Saiva hagiography since the literary works of the Nayanmars support the 8<sup>th</sup> century date suggested by us. If Ranadhira is taken to have reigned during 700-730CE, then we cannot explain how he could claim to be the ruler of Chozha lands since he would have been a contemporary of Rajasimha Pallava who certainly did not lose any territory. On the other hand, if Ranadhira is dated to the early years of Pallavamalla, it makes much better sense. Ranadhira must have launched a swift invasion of Chozha and Chera-Kongu territories subjugating them and making their rulers as his allies against Pallavas. This alliance was continued by his son, Maravarman Rajasimhan who is praised as Pallavabhanjana in the Srivaramangalam Copper Plates[^43]. 

In brief, based on the available Pandyan and Pallava records, we may conclude that 4 generations of Pandyan rulers battled against Pallavamalla I.  

Revised Chronology of the Pandyan rulers:

We arrive at the following revised chronology for the Pandyan rulers of the First Empire:


    Arikesari Parankusa Maravarman	690 to 740 CE


    Kochadaiyan Ranadhiran		740 to 744 CE


    Maravarman Rajasimhan		744 to 768 CE


    Jatila Parantaka aka Varaguna I		768 to 811/15 CE


    Srimaran Srivallabhan			811/15 to 862 CE
