  <p>In the meanwhile, attempts were made by leading pro-
Pakistani Hindus, who were outside the jails, to capture the
Hindu Mahasabha by r. /p d^ciat and make it accept the
Pakistan scheme at least ]vrinciple so that the Hindu Maha-
sabha could be a handmaid Lo the Congress in supporting the
latter’s anti-national surrender to the Pakistani forces. Sri K.
M. Munshi had even attended a meeting of the Working
Committee of the Hindu Mahasabha and Rajaji had almost
captivated Dr. Mookerjee and Raja Maheshwar Dayal. In
order to ward off that danger, expose and frustrate the
conspiracy, Savarkar resolved not only not to resign as already
announced by him, but also to contest the election to the
Presidentship of the Hindu Mahasabha at the annual Session
of the Mahasabha in 1942. This was the only time when
Savarkar actually contested the election to the Presidentship
of the Hindu Mahasabha ; and backed by the wisdom and
overwhelming confidence of its electorates, Savarkar was
almost unanimously elected to the Presidentship. The annual
Session was held at Cawnpore in the last week of December
1942.</p>
<p>In the Presidential Address, Savarkar fully dealt with the
pros and cons of the self-determination issue, and, refuting the
arguments put forth in its support, resolved all doubts. He
said he stood for provincial re-distribution, but not for
provincial self-determination. The grant of self-determination,
he stated, to provinces to secede from the Central State would
blow up the Central State. Savarkar further observed that
the proposed Pakistan State would be militarily dangerous and
hence it would be suicidal to hand over the natural frontiers
to a hostile group. He warned that economically and
financially the Pakistan Muslims would not starve as the cold
and calculating pro-Pakistani Hindus guessed, but they would
pounce upon the neighbouring Hindu territories with fire and
fanaticism. Did not the fate of Kashmir prove this truth ?</p>
<p>304 SAVABKAR AND HIS TIMES</p>
<p>Some of the pro-Pakistani Hindus whispered to Savarkar that
after the liquidation of the foreign power, Pakistan would be
browbeaten into submission, and, therefore, as a stroke of
statesmanship Pakistan should be granted. Savarkar replied
that even without a State the Muslims had grown into such
a threat ; then with a State they would be better organized
and prepared and the wishes of the pro-Pakistani Hindus
would thus prove to be the beggars’ horses ! Therefore he
asked the statesmen and politicians to draw a line and say ‘ thus
far and no further ’ at that very stage. Some, he said, foolishly
argued that the question of Pakistan was just like the Ulster
phase in Ireland. Replying to this argument, Savarkar said
that Ireland had never recognized the principle of pro\nncial
self-determination, and he declared : “ Hindusthan shall and
must remain an integral and powerful nation and a Central
State from the Indus to the Seas. Any movement to under-
mine her integrity, cohesion and unity would be treated as
treacherous and would be suppressed as any movement for
Negrostan would be punished in the U.S.A.”</p>
<p>An uncompromising and strongly worded resolution against
the Pakistan scheme was passed at the Session. The
frustration of the outsiders, who expected Mahasabha consent
to Pakistan, at this was so great that the Hyde in Gandhlji
bewailed through Rajaji : “ Even those few leaders of the</p>
<p>Hindu Mahasabha, who more or less sympathized with my
formula regarding the Hindu-Muslim Unity, feU a prey to
crowd psychology at Cawnpore.” Mahasabhaites wondered
who these leaders were who sympathized with Rajaji’s
Pakistani formula. But there was no answer. When asked
by some bold Poona youths about it. Dr. Mookerjee said that
Rajaji might have referred to Raja Maheshwar Dayal, and in
his turn the Raja said that it might be Dr. Mookerjee ! But
Rajaji had referred to “ leaders ” and not to a single leader !
Is the answer not clear ? Thus did Savarkar prove to be the
despair of the hybrid pro-Pakistani Hindus and a disappoint-
ment to statesmanly Hindu politicians, who were prepared to
accept the principle of provincial self-determination.</p>
<p>Besides the Hindu Mahasabha Session, December 1942
witnessed two other important events. In his speech before
the Federated Chambers of Conunerce at Calcutta, Lord</p>
<p>THE WRITING ON THE WALL 305</p>
<p>Linlithgow stressed the need for maintaining the geographical
unity of India. Sri Meherchanda Khanna represented the
Hindu Mahasabha opposition to the vivisection of India at the
Pan-Pacific Conference in Arr rica where he was sent as the
Indian representative by the wernment of India.</p>
<p>On February 1, 1943, Sava: .ar visited Shirdhon, the birth-
place of the Indian rebel lea ler, Wasudeo Balwant Phadke,
who rose in an armed revoh a 1879 in Maharashtra and who
breathed his last in the jail at .\den longing for the rise of a
great Indian Republic. It was an appealing, thrilling and
romantic sight to see the world-famous revolutionary leader
in Savarkar paying homage to his brilliant precursor.</p>
<p>Much water had flown under the bridges since then. The
Congressites had travelled from a path of jail-seeking to a
jail-breaking programme. The misplanned, ill-ordered August
Revolution almost came to an end after a few weeks of violent
disorders, mass lawlessness and mob violence. Sri Jai Prakash
Narayan, its brilliant leader of action, admitted in his secret
circular of January 1943, entitled “To ALL Fighters For
Freedom the failure of the Open Rebellion. Therein he
ascribed the failure to the absence of efficient organization of
the national revolutionary forces and the absence of further
programme before the people. And when it was too late,
Jai Prakash realized and remembered “ there was our work
in the Indian Army and in the services ! ” ^ After frustration
there came the revelation and realization for which Savarkar
had clamoured in 1942. Had the Congress leaders supported
militarization and enlistment of patriotic youths in the forces ?
Who was right, Savarkar or the Congress leaders ? Now
realizing the magnitude of the fiasco and failure of his move-
ment, Gandhiji began on February 10, 1943, his 21-day fast
which was nothing less than a tactical move to force his release
from the Aga Khan Palace.</p>
<p>The whole nation was rocked. In the Indian political sky
huge cries of ‘ Release Congress leaders &rsquo; arose. But the
British Government remained adamant on the issue of
Gandhiji’s release. The Non-Party leaders assembled on
February 19, 1943, to consider the situation which arose out</p>
<p>^ Government of India Publication, Congress Responsibility for the
Disturbances^ 1942-43, p. 74.</p>
<p>20</p>
<p>306 SAVARKAS AND HIS TIMES</p>
<p>of Gandhiji’s fast at the Aga Khan Palace, Poona. Savarkar’s
attitude to Gandhiji, who differed from him in political matters,
was charitable. He wired to Sir Tej Bahadur Sapru, the
President of the Non-Party Conference, on the 20th February
“ to issue a national appeal to Gandhiji himself to break his
fast in the interest of the nation.” In the statement issued
on the same day Savarkar said : “ We must all turn our faces</p>
<p>from the alien and unsympathetic doors of the Viceregal Lodge
to the bedside of Gandhiji, and entreat him to break his fast
in the national interest to serve which he must have under-
taken it. . . . No appeals, resignations or resolutions addressed
to the Government can secure Gandhiji’s release. . . . This
national appeal should be communicated^ to him without the
loss of a single minute through any one of them who are
allowed to visit him. His life, Gandhiji himself may realize
by such a national appeal, is not so much his own as it is a
national asset, a national property.”</p>
<p>At Delhi, the Working Committee of the Hindu Mahasabha
passed a resolution regarding Gandhiji’s fast wishing prayer-
fully that Gandhiji’s spiritual strength would enable him to
survive the ordeal, but warned those concerned not to exploit
the fast for political ends for bringing about constitutional
changes and ending the deadlock without consulting the Hindu
Mahasabha which would resist any encroachment upon Hindu
rights or any scheme undermining India’s integrity. Savarkar
correctly sensed that if the fast was applied to resolving the
political deadlock, it would result in a threat to the integrity
of India. It was an historic reading of Gandhiji’s mind. And
a year later India was stunned when Hajaji came out with his
formula and declared that Gandhiji had fathered it actually
during this very fast at the Aga Khan Palace, a year before,
and had authorized him to approach Mr. Jinnah for a
compromise on that basis !</p>
<p>Now interested groups brought pressure on the members of
the Executive Council of the Viceroy for tendering their
resignations as a protest against the policy of Government in
keeping Gandhiji in internment. Savarkar was of the opinion
that the Members of the Executive Council should not resign
on this issue. Dr. Ambedkar and Sir J. P. Srivastava with-
stood many hysterical appeals. But what about Aney and</p>
<p>THE WRITING ON THE WALL 307</p>
<p>others ? Sri Aney, Sir Homi Modi, and Sri N. R. Sarkar,
resigned, but one of them surprised all with his worldly wisdom
full of carking anxieties for his political future ! And yet he
was the very politician who had in a responsive manner not
hesitated at all to concur with his colleagues in their decision
regarding the arrest of all the national leaders including
Gandhiji, six months earlier. It is indeed an uncommon art
to be able to butter both sides of one&rsquo;s bread ! This partial
evacuation of the Executi^ Council created a faint smile on
the face of Gandhiji f astir. ’ ii. the Aga Khan Palace.</p>
<p>At this juncture the Muslim League was pushing the
Pakistan proposal ahead. Its Sind League Ministry passed
the Pakistan resolution inside the legislature. The Hindu
Ministers of the Mahasabha persuasion opposed the resolution.
It is worthy of note that Mr. Alla Bux, the nationahst Muslim
leader, who was murdered a few days after this event for his
— it was said — ^pro-Congress views, had no heart or guts even
to attend the Sind Assembly Session and oppose the Pakistan
resolution. Referring to this development, Savarkar warned
the country against the impending peril in these memorable
words : Now the features of Pakistan delineated on the wall</p>
<p>are so bold that even he who runs may read them. Only the
blind and cowardly can still indulge in believing that the
deadly serpent may yet prove to be a coil of rope.&quot; ^ Savarkar
also pointed out the difference between those members who
were of Mahasabha persuasion and those elected on the
Congress tickets in regard to their political stand. The former
opposed any anti-national scheme and proposals boldly and
bravely, while the latter kept culpable silence at the time of
solving any crucial and vital problem affecting the destiny
of the nation such as the one mentioned above. But the
short-sighted lead of the Congress, lacking as it was in
historical perspective, failed to read the writing on the wall.</p>
<p>During the same month the Leaders&rsquo; Conference was held
in Bombay at the residence of Dr. Jayakar to explore the
possibilities of Gajndhiji&rsquo;s release. Prominent among those
who attended the Conference were K. M. Munshi, Rajaji,
Bhulabhai Desai, Alla Bux and Devidas Gandhi. It was
through the personal pressure of Dr. Jayakar and Sir Tej</p>
<p>^ Statement dated 10-3-1943.</p>
<p>308 SAVABKAH AND HIS TIMES</p>
<p>Bahadur Sapru, who told Savarkar that something must be
done to undo the injustice to the Hindu cause, that Savarkar
attended the Conference on March 9, 1943. When Savarkar
entered the residence of Dr. Jayakar, he saw leaders sitting
in groups and talking among themselves. He found that there
was no such question as Hindu interest or Hindu cause and the
burden of the talks and discussion was the release of Gandhiji.
When Jayakar and Sapru requested Savarkar to speak on the
point of Gandhiji’s release, Savarkar insisted that not only
the release of Gandhiji, but also the release of all political
leaders including Sri Sarat Bose should be demanded. He
further said that the British Government should be urged
either to release all those patriots or put them on trial.</p>
<p>Those were the days when the Liberals felt very uneasy to
approach the Viceroy. So they earnestly requested Savarkar
to approach the Viceroy with whom he really had great
influence, and press for the release of Gandhiji. Next day,
Savarkar could not attend the Conference owing to toothache
and a previous engagement with Mr. William Phillips,
President Roosevelt’s personal envoy, then travelling in India.
The interview covered a wide range of topics from the
political situation in India to the future relations between
India and the U.S.A. In the meanwhile, it was given out in
the press that Savarkar had signed the appeal for Gandhiji’s
release which Savarkar contradicted to the leaders’ great
disappointment by a statement declaring that he was not
present at the Conference on the 10th of March when the
appeal was drafted and signed by its signatories.</p>
<p>Just then Mr. Jinnah, who was expecting a letter from
Gandhiji in the Aga Khan Palace, thundered that terrible
consequences would follow if the Government meddled with
his post. Savarkar said that the threat of Mr. Jinnah was
more amusing than alarming, and wondered why the League
Fuehrer did not capture the Viceroy and proclaim Pakistan
at once !</p>
<p>By now, the Hiu* rebellion was ruthlessly suppressed by the
Government and its ring leader, Pir Pagaro, was hanged. The
Muslim League demanded that his property should constitute
a religious trust. Upon this Savarkar came out with a state-
ment on May 4, appealing to the Government to compensate</p>
<p>THE WRITING ON THE WALL 309</p>
<p>the Hindus for the losses they had suffered, from the proceeds
of Pir Pagaro’s property, which had been extorted in the main
from the Hindus whom the armed gangs of the Hurs had
looted and harassed.</p>
<p>There was a change in the Executive Council of the Viceroy.
The Viceroy appointed Dr. N. B. Khare Member of the
Executive Council in place of Aney. Savarkar appreciated
the nomination of Dr. Khare. Dr. Khare was a staunch
supporter of the militarization policy, a fearless patriot and a
politician of hard stuff, who cared more for his conscience than
for his career and who never changed his opinion for seciming
a post or for future success. And Dr. Khare proved his worth
when in the capacity of Commonwealth Relations Member he
patriotically and with his characteristic fearlessness attacked
the Segregation Bill proposed by the South African Govern-
ment. The Segregation Bill had engaged the attention of the
world and especially of the Indian leaders. Savarkar
condemned it as an “ anti-Indian, unjust and oppressive
measure,” and appealed to Britain and America “ to protest
against the most callous and insulting Bill, which cut at the
very root of the high-sounding aims of Britain and America
which stood for the vindication of freedom and equal treat-
ment for the depressed nationalities of the world.”</p>
<p>II</p>
<p>On the 28th of May 1943, Savarkar’s Diamond Jubilee was
celebrated all over India with great eclat and enthusiasm on
a magnificent scale. Savarkar’s birthday is an occasion for
national celebration and jubilation every year to the Hindu
Sanghatanists in Hindusthan. It was natural therefore that
on his happy and romantic sixty-first birthday, which dawned
after Savarkar had faced bullets, chains, cells, and years of
internment, the Hindus should display their nation-wide
rejoicings with special enthusiasm and added vigour. Opportu-
nists, careerists and arm-chair politicians do reach in the
natural course the day of their Diamond Jubilee ; but it is
a freak of fate, a fit of destiny, if a De Valera, a Mazzini, a
Garibaldi or a Savarkar reaches the day of his Diamond
Jubilee. India’s greatest patriot of his generation, Savarkar</p>
<p>310 SAVARKAR AND HIS TIMES</p>
<p>was to rot in a cell of the Andamans till his seventy-severth
birthday and was to be released at the end of the year 19()],
if he survived !</p>
<p>Therefore on this unique day mass meetings were held in
the capital cities of all provinces and were addressed by
eminent and prominent personalities. Big functions were held
in the District and Taluka tovras ; various public, social,
literary and religious institutions passed resolutions in
appreciation of Savarkar’s great patriotic, literary and social
services. He was also presented with purses and public
addresses as a token of gratitude and in appreciation of his
great services in the cause of Freedom.</p>
<p>On the evening of May 28, 1943, before a mammoth
congregation at Poona, Savarkar was presented with a purse
of rupees one lakh and twenty-thousand by the Savarkar
Reception Committee, Poona, under the presidency of Sri N.
C. Kelkar. Savarkar was touched with the boundless love his
countrymen bore to him and the gratitude they showered on a
nation-wide scale on the day. He said amidst pin-drop silence
to the vast multitude : I am really overwhelmed with the</p>
<p>feelings of love and gratitude you have showered upon me
which I cannot adequately express in words. Some sentiments
are too delicate for words. It is a forgetful fit of destiny that
I am amongst you loday. Nobody could have predicted that
I could survive the two transportations the severity of which
on more than one occasion drove me to the thought of suicide !
We lived in our veritable grave. Through fire and water we
have stood by our noble resolve. And when I came out I
was not my personal self. I was but a shriek of the distressed
Hindutva.’’ Next day, the Poona Municipality gave him an
address of welcome. He told the meeting on the occasion that
life for a century was no fascination for him. Striving terribly
for the goal alone had given him the supreme joy of life. He
wished that soldiers fighting for national independence should
march over the bridges of the dead bodies of his colleagues
and his own, and win the goal.</p>
<p>At Poona, on the same day, great ones of Marathi literature
honoured Savarkar as a literary genius. The address
solemnly stated : “ It required Lord Krishna to say the Gita</p>
<p>to inspire Arjun with the spirit of fighting. The Gita has been</p>
<p>THE WRITING ON THE WALL 311</p>
<p>since then the guiding pole-star and the beacon-light to the
anxious world. Your place is among such authors of
immortal fame. Unflagging is the pursuit of your ideal and
conquering is your mission.”</p>
<p>A similar function was held in his honour in Bombay at
the Gowalia Tank Maidan on the 6th of June on a grand scale,
under the presidentship of Sir R. P. Paran 3 pe, a former
Principal of the Fergusson College from which Savarkar
graduated. Speaking on the occasion, Paranjpe appreciated
the great services of Savarkar to the country, marvelled at
Savarkar ’s unabated persistence in the national struggle and
at his mental and bodily vigour even after such a dreadful
incarceration and a long internment. The eminent Liberal
leader then asserted that Savarkar’s militarization policy was
dictated by sound political realism, and appreciated Savarkar’s
great work of Hindu consolidation and his valuable work for
the uplift of the Depressed Classes. Paranjpe blamed
Gandhiji for admixing religion with politics. He said that he
could understand Savarkar’s legitimate opposition to Gandhiji’s
policy of appeasement at all costs and reminded the country
of the fate of Chamberlain at the hands of Hitler.</p>
<p>Mr. K. F. Nariman, Sri Jamnadas Mehta and Sri Chandra-
gupta Vedalankar were the other principal speakers on the
occasion. Then a purse and a silver replica of the s.s. Morea,
from which Savarkar had escaped at Marseilles, were
presented to Savarkar on behalf of the public of Bombay. In
reply to the great honour done to him, Savarkar reiterated
his behef that nationalism itself was a step to a Human
Government, that the Hindus were the national majority of
Hindusthan, and that there should be an Indian State based
on the principal of ‘ one man one vote ’ in Hindusthan.</p>
<p>On behalf of the people of Berar Savarkar’s Diamond
Jubilee was celebrated on August 1, 1943, at Amraoti with
great eclat under the Presidentship of Sx’i Babarao Khaparde.
Savarkar was presented with a purse. In reply to the great
honour paid to him Savarkar explained how he was fulfilling
the mission of Tilak. Nagpur, too, celebrated the Diamond
Jubilee of Savarkar and presented a purse to Savarkar at a
grand function. Dr. Varadarajalu Naidu was the main
speaker on the occasion. Dr. Moonje presided over the</p>
<p>312 SAVARKAR AND HIS TIMES</p>
<p>celebration. On this great occasion the Nagpur University
conferred upon Savarkar a Doctorate of Letters in appreciation
of Savarkar’s great literary powers. What a contrast to the
attitude of the Bombay University ! It not only failed to show
any gratitude for or recognition of Savarkar’s services to the
nation and literature by conferring any special Degree on him,
but also did not care to recognize and restore Savarkar’s B.A.
Degree so unjustly wrested from him when he was fighting
for Indian Independence. Oh ingratitude ! is thy name
political animosity of men in power in India ?</p>
<p>A purse on behalf of the public of Ahmedabad was at a
later stage presented to Savarkar at Ahmedabad on August
22, 1945. The purse had been subscribed on the occasion of
Savarkar’s Diamond Jubilee, but owing to the recurrent illness
of Savarkar the celebration had to be postponed.</p>
<p>Excepting Tilak no other leader was similarly honoured in
Maharashtra and the services of no Indian Leader except
Gandhiji upto that day were publicly appreciated on such a
nation-wide scale.</p>
<p>The main feature of the purses presented to Savarkar was
an unequivocal declaration by the organizers, promoters and
workers that they were offered unconditionally for his
personal use as a token of nation’s gratitude to Savarkar for
his untold sacrifices, unparalleled sufferings and unequalled
services to the country. Still some politicians like Dr. Pattabhi
Sitaramayya, who were not perturbed at the mismanagement
of the Tilak Swaraj Fund, grew critical about the utility of
Savarkar’s purse. And all this when Congressmen as a group
had boycotted the purse. If they were unconcerned with it,
why could they not purse up their aspersions within their
lips ?</p>
<p>In a special statement Savarkar acknowledged his debt to
the gratitude shown by the whole nation for patriotic work,
sufferings and sacrifice and said with a moving heart : “ Still,</p>
<p>even while I was moving on, loaded with garlands, through
the pressing and cheering crowds on my 61st birthday, I
continued to feel in a mood of aloofness that it was but a
romantic accident on the path of life and I must be prepared
to face a counter-transfer scene at any moment when all this</p>
<p>THE WRITING ON THE WALL 313</p>
<p>blossom, silver and gold might once again get transformed and
hardened into iron and steel and fiery ordeal.”</p>
<p>Ill</p>
<p>Savarkar’s insistence on constitutional means inside and
revolutionary methods outside the Indian nation, was revealed
once more on July 27, 1943, when Mr. Jinnah was attacked
hy a Muslim youth with a knife. He had a narrow escape
from the murderous attack. Though Jinnah belonged to the
rival political party, Savarkar came out with a statement and
condemned the act saying that “ such internecine, unprovoked
murderous assaults — even if the motive be political or fanatical
— constituted a stain on the public and civic life and should
be strongly condemned.” Savarkar’s candid regard for purity
of civic life was appreciated by Mr. Jinnah himself, who wrote
to Sri Bhide Guruji, Savarkar’s Secretary, thanking Savarkar
for his good wishes. That was the first and last occasion when
a letter passed between these two great leaders.</p>
<p>The Mahasabha having now firmly held to its anti-Pakistan
resolve, Savarkar resigned at the end of July 1943, the
Presidentship of the Hindu Mahasabha for the third time.
This time, too, his resignation was not accepted, statesmen
like Dr. Moonje being unwilling to change the horse in
midstream.</p>
<p>But in spite of indifferent health, Savarkar’s vigilant eyes
were surveying the moves of the Pakistanis. A difficult
situation was arising in Assam. Long before, Savarkar had
warned the Assam Hindus of the impending danger. This time
also Savarkar invited the attention of the Hindus to the
imminent dangerous fate Assam would sufifer at the hands of
the homeless hungry hordes of Muslims from Bengal and
Orissa immigrating into Assam with a veiled plan of under-
mining the overwhelming majority of the Hindus in Assam
and turning it into a part of their proposed Pakistan. Hindu
leaders in the Congress party could not gauge the danger.
Though their leadership and nationalism depended for their
life upon the strength of the Hindus, yet they pooh-poohed the
calamity and ejaculated that it mattered not to them if there
was a Muslim majority or a Hindu one in Assam. Savarkar</p>
<p>314 SAVARKAH AND HIS TIMES</p>
<p>bewailed the lack of foresight on the part of the Congress
leaders, who failed to see that “ that very difference measures
the distance between Akhand Hindusthan and Pakistan. It is
the self-forgetting and suicidal mentality, which has smitten
the Hindu race like a national curse and has been responsible
in the main for the ills the Hindus are subjected to.”</p>
<p>At this period an event of historical importance took place.
In the month of June 1943, the League Ministry in Sind
banned Chapter XIV of the Satyartha Prakash, the
Bible of the Arya Samaj. None was affected more deeply than
Savarkar and he came forward to defend the religious liberty
of the Arya Samaj. In an appeal to the Viceroy he stated :</p>
<p>“ I emphatically draw your Excellency’s attention to the
contemplated action against the Satyartha Prakash by the
Sind Ministry. That book is the scripture of the Arya
Samajists and is revered by the Hindus in general. Every
scripture including the Bible has something to say against
other sects or religions. But no Hindu Ministry ever
contemplated any action against non-Hindu scriptures.”
Savarkar was the only great leader who strongly and boldly
protested against the unjust ban on the Satyartha Prakash.
And that is why the Arya Samaj leader, Sri Ghanashyam Das
Gupta, sought his guidance in the matter.</p>
<p>Neither the Congress press nor their leaders raised even
their little finger against this, for they feared as usual that
their Muslim brothers’ sentiments would be hurt. It was a
religious matter and that too concerning the Hindus ! The
Congress leaders were progressive men. And yet they were
intelligent and progressive enough to struggle for restoring the
Khilafat to Turkastan which she herself had banished ! And
this is not at all strange. Congressmen, who always walked
on the tips of their toes to search for a Muslim grievance and
to defend and appease it at the cost of Hindu interests and
could later on move an adjournment motion in the Central
Assembly over the execution of Pir Pagaro, did not feel an
iota of sympathy with the Hindus for the unjust ban on their
legitimate right of freedom of conscience. There was this
method in their Muslim mania. They kept neutral over any
problem affecting Hindu interests and their motto was either
to keep mum over Muslim demands or to support them. And</p>
<p>the writing on the wall 315</p>
<p>for this lack of sympathy and support on the part of the
Congressmen to the cause of the Arya Samaj, the Arya
Samajists themselves were in no small measure responsible.</p>
<p>A multitude of the followers of the Arya Samaj had changed
their holy faith for Gandhism for all practical purposes and
adopted Gandhiji as their godfather, who openly attributed
narrow-mindedness to their prophet.</p>
<p>Then came the famine that smote Bengal, taking an
unparalleled toll of human lives and reducing human beings
and houses to dust. The Muslims tried to utilize the appalling
situation for their worldly benefit. An organized Muslim
campaign to convert hundreds of starving Hindu women and
children to Islamic faith was reported to have been carried
on during this man-made famine — a famine set in by a dark
fanatic regime of the Muslim League Ministry. Savarkar
attacked these nefarious active proselytizing designs of the
Moslems. He shouted that the Muslims spent their funds on
Muslim famine-stricken population alone. While as usual
nationalist leaders like Devi Sarojini Naidu sent a cheque
earmarked for the Muslim sufferers, the Hindu funds and
trainloads of foodstuff were distributed amongst all the
sufferers in a cosmopolitan way. Savarkar said that the
Muslims were not only fed doubly, but they also used their
surplus for dragging Hindu children and women into their
fold. So Savarkar urged upon the Hindu leaders and
organizations to help, rescue, feed, clothe and shelter Hindu
sufferers alone, and warned them publicly : “ Let the Hindus</p>
<p>remember that suicide is no humanity. Humanity that allows
itself to be abused to encourage inhuman activities, is no virtue
but a crime.” Some sordid journalists of false cosmopolitan
view and hue honestly decried this realistic attitude of
Savarkar ; but slurred over the point whether the basis of
Savarkar’s advice was real or not.</p>
<p>About this time the official Vatican Organ, Observators
Romano, had declared : “ The Christian light shines already</p>
<p>in the subcontinent of India. We hope one day it will blaze
forth in full splendour.” Savarkar was amused at this
mistaken belief of the Pope and cabled a statement to the
United Press of America, Washington, retorting squarely :
“ Surely the Vatican could not have chosen more absurdly</p>
<p>316 SAVARKAR AND HIS TIMES</p>
<p>ridiculous a moment to wish India to blaze forth with
Christianity than this one, when Hitler, Mussolini, Churchill
Roosevelt and the other leaders of almost all Christian
nations are vowing vengeance against each other and singing
hallelujahs to Moloch in churches meant for Christ and when
the Vatican, the capital of the High Priest of the Prince of
Peace itself which was only yesterday honouring Mussolini,
is today blazing forth in full splendour under the bombard-
ment from air and praying through the mouth of cannon to
save itself ! ” Savarkar hit the nail on the head when he
further said, “ Physician heal thyself,” and pointed out to the
Pope that “ his clock was behind time ; the Christian light had
come to shine dimmer ever since the Shuddhi and Sanghatan
movement had set in belying the hopes of Macaulay, who
wished India to pulsate with Christianity, with the result that
thousands of Hindus, who had embraced Christianity, were
now repudiating it and re-embracing the Hindu fold and
getting re-assimilated into the Hindu Nation not only
religiously but also culturally, politically and socially.” This
view of Savarkar was highly appreciated by the Jews in India
and particularly their spokesmen at Madras.</p>
<p>In November 1943, a memorable event in the social history
of Maharashtra took place. It was the centenary celebration
of the Marathi Stage. Savarkar was elected President and
he presided over the functions at Sangli in the first week of
November. It was a unique honour for a unique personality.
The stage and screen luminaries, playwrights and litterateurs
of Maharashtra did well in paying this unique honour to
Savarkar, their foremost man of letters, poet and dramatist.
Savarkar presided over several literary conferences and
fimctions but none so memorable !</p>
<p>During the same week the second millenary of Vikramaditya
the Great was celebrated at Sangli by the Maharashtra
Provincial Hindu Sabha. Savarkar addressed a memorable
mammoth pubhc meeting on the bank of the river Krishna at
Sangli and spoke on the great epoch-maker. He told the vast
multitude that Vikramaditya the Great lived for two thousand
years in the memory of his race, not because he was merely
a great king in whose peaceful reign, life and literature, art
and learning prospered, but because he defeated, demolished,</p>
<p>the whiting on the wall 317</p>
<p>and drove out the Shaks and the Huns, the alien and non-
Hindu invaders, and liberated the Bharat Varsha. The whole
of Hindusthan felt enthused, inspired and animated, said
Savarkar, at the mention of the name of Vikramaditya as the
Shakari and Hunari, the conqueror of the Shaks and the
Huns.</p>
<p>December came and Savarkar was again elected for the
seventh successive time President of the Hindu Mahasabha
Session to be held at Amritsar, despite his resignation pending
before the Working Commitli&rsquo;o of the Hindu Mahasabha and
his repeated requests to the contrary. But owing to a severe
attack of bronchitis he was confined to bed and Dr. Mookerjee
officiated in his place.</p>
<p>The political deadlock was still unsolved. The British
Government was busy with the operations of the war, and was
not in a mood to discuss the deadlock. But efforts were made
by some Liberal leaders in that direction. Sir Maharaj Kumar
of Vijay Nagar expressed a desire to know the views of
Savarkar on the All-Party Conference to be convened shortly
thereafter to solve the deadlock. Savarkar replied to him
that there was no harm in trying again. Sir Jagdish Prasad
had an interview with Savarkar at Savarkar Sadan on
February 24, 1944, and discussed current political problems.
Early in the month, the Sub-Consul of the U.S.A. interviewed
Savarkar to ascertain Savarkar’s views on War and the Indian
political situation.</p>
<p>In February 1944, Mrs. Kasturba Gandhi died a glorious
death befitting an Aryan lady in the Aga Khan Palace at
Poona. Savarkar’s political differences with her husband
were quite well known. Yet the personal loss of Gandhiji had
his condolences and sympathies. In a telegraphic condolence
message to Gandhiji, Savarkar said : “ With a heavy heart I</p>
<p>mourn the death of Kastiu-ba. A faithful wife, and an
affectionate mother, she died a noble death in the service of
God and Man. Your grief is shared by a whole nation.” Such
noble feelings could come only from a heart devoid of any
spite against Gandhiji as a private man.</p>
<p>But the disciples of Gandhiji afterwards dragged the
deceased lady’s name into an appeal for a fund in her name.
It was not a fund which all part 3 nnen were to expend on a</p>
<p>318 SAVARKAR AND HIS TIMES</p>
<p>national cause in its truest sense. Again the nationalism of
its trustees was likely to be the same for which the Tilak
Swaraj Fund was utilized. Savarkar could not tolerate this
politics in the good name of Kasturba especially as it was
feared that the Fund was likely to be used for anti-Hindu
purposes. So Savarkar asked the Hindu Sanghatanist public
not to contribute even a pie to the Kasturba Fund and to
supply the sinews for the propagandistic struggle of the
Congress to be used against the Hindu Mahasabha. He
reminded the Hindu Sanghatanists how the Tilak Swaraj Fund
was utilized to kill the spirit of the Tilakites, the policy of
Tilak and his party, and to aid the Khilafatists.</p>
<p>As for the idea of a memorial to the good patriotic lady, he
appreciated it, but asked Congressmen whether they had ever
cared for the thousand and one widows of the revolutionary
martyred heroes, who had pined away in miserable widow-
hood ! What Savarkar suggested to the people was that if at
all they wanted to erect any memorial to Kasturba, they should
also do so to the memory of the patriotic and pious souls like
Madame Cama, Gopikabai Phadke, Satyabhamabai Tilak —
who died while Tilak was at Mandalay — , Yashodabai
Savarkar, ladies from the Parmananda family and numerous,
other ladies who were as patriotic as Kasturba. Savarkar also
emphasized that the Kasturba Fund being a party Fund might
be used by Gandhiji at his sweet wiU for the propaganda of
his ideals which Savarkar believed to be detrimental to the
ultimate interests and the integrity of Hindusthan. The good
name of Kasturba which Savarkar honoured with due respect
had nothing to do with the political propaganda of Gandhiji.
The history of the Kasturba Fund afterwards was not in any
way encouraging from the point of Hindu interests and
the integrity of Hindusthan and Savarkar’s stand proved to
be quite correct. But the Congress press and some lackeys
with malicious pens indulged in anti-Savarkar outbursts
totally unjustified.</p>
<p>In March 1944, the Congressmen, who were freshly filtered
out of the jails after the abrupt failure of their Quit India
Movement, began to realize the frustration of their boycott
of the Central Assembly. They now attended the Assembly
and outvoted the Finance Bill in collaboration with the Muslim</p>
<p>the writing on the wall 319</p>
<p>League. Here was a combination of the August protagonists
and their August antagonists. The Muslim Leaguers wLo
were smarting under the Viceroy’s stress in his announcement
on the geographical, political, military and economic unity of
India, seized the opportunity of browbeating the Viceroy and
so they used the Congress Assembly members as a cat’s paw
to serve tbeir ends by throwing the Bill out. Savarkar’s
untaibng insigbt saw the danger in this event. So he endorsed
the view taken by the Mahasabha M.L.As in the Central
Assembly led by Sri Jamnadas Mebta who did not support
the League-Congress unholy alliance. The Congress party
and papers severely criticised this non-co-operation on the
part of the Assembly Members of the Hindu Mahasabha as
a pro-British attitude. The stand taken by Savarkar in regard
to this alliance was vindicated, as will be seen in the next
chapter, with a vengeance by the disclosure of the Bhulabhai-
Liaqat Ali Khan pact which was mooted by this alliance. The
Congress party hailed the pyrrhic victory won by the alliance
as a feather in their white caps. Sir Tej Bahadur Sapru
characterised the white-feathered victory with his failing sight
as the first rung of the ladder ; but he must have soon
discovered that the ladder was one that led to Pakistan.</p>
<p>Soon after this Gandhiji was released on May 6, 1944,
because of his bad health. Speaking of this event, Savarkar
said that this action on the part of the British Government
was a humane one. He also wished Gandhiji speedy recovery
and urged the Government to release Pandit Nehru and other
leaders as well. What a patriotic sympathy for the
compatriots ! Had an iota of this sympathy been felt by
Pandit Nehru and others for Savarkar, it would have added
lustre to their patriotic selflessness. But they never did it nor
did they show any inclination to do so even when Savarkar
lay in the hospital or was bed-ridden, not to speak of
Savarkar’s arrest at Gaya in 1941 when Nehru and his Civil
Liberties Union kept mum !</p>
<p>Shortly afterwards Savarkar had to issue a statement in
reply to a speech made by Mr. Jinnah at Sialkot. In his
speech at Sialkot, Jinnah referred to a statement of Savarkar
and told the Muslims that Savarkar and Moonje had
instructed the Punjab Hindus to join the Muslim League in</p>
<p>320 SAVARKAR AND HIS TIMES</p>
<p>forming coalitions ‘ when it was inevitable to do so.’ So
Jinnah advised the Moslems to make it inevitable for the
Hindus to co-operate with the League in forming the ministry.
Upon this Savarkar replied that the report of his instructions
as quoted by Mr. Jinnah was meagre and misleading ; and if
Mr. Jinnah construed it as an instrument to bend the Hindus
to his wUl, then, he said, he should rest assured that the
Hindus would never bend to the dictates of the League.
Mr. Jinnah wanted in those days a Hindu leader to support
his demands and his wish was father to the thought. What
Savarkar in fact was driving at was that he was prepared to
discuss any sensible, honourable and workable proposal for
the Hindu-Muslim unity. One does not see in this any harm
to national interests and one wonders why Dr. Pattabhi
Sitaramayya should have twisted the statement of Savarkar
in his propagandist history of the Indian National Congress !
Savarkar had advised the Hindu leaders in the Muslim majo-
rity provinces to join ministries formed by the Muslim
League wdthout committing themselves to any scheme detri-
mental .to the interests and to the integrity of Hindusthan.
In criticizing this stand, Dr. Pattabhi Sitaramayya, in fact,
blamed Savarkar for having tried to apply a check to the
Leaguers who were running amuck in those provinces. Such
a move could not but be a wrong strategy in the eyes of
Gandhian politics in which Dr. Pattabhi had been steeped for
two decades !</p>
<p>In the second week of June 1944, Sri M. N. Roy paid a
visit to Savarkar Sadan with his wife, Mrs. Ellen Roy, as a
courtesy call. Savarkar was then unwell. Yet the talk
between the two leaders became very interesting when it
touched the Muslim problem in its rational and realistic
aspect. Two giants well known for their rationalism crossed
swords with each other, and the great theorist in Roy had
to face hard realities respecting the Muslim problem from all
points. During this month the Government of India appointed
Sir R. P. Paranjpe High Commissioner for Australia. He
was the first Indian to be the High Conunissioner for Australia.
Savarkar expressed satisfaction at this appointment.</p>
<p>In the meanwhile a crisis was coming to a head in the
Jaipur State. As foretold by Savarkar, Sir Mirza Ismail in</p>
<p>thjb writing on the wall 321</p>
<p>fact persisted in his pro-MusUm policy in Jaipur. He was
stated to have stifled Hindi and the Nagari script, supported
Urdu and demolished temples that came in the way of
his town-planning, but left mosques untouched. There was
a strong agilalion in the State against his holding the offlee
any longer, bandit ^amehandta Shatma, a Wdex m
State, res^orted to a last ‘\n YieWn, protesVmg against the anti-
Hindu rule of Sir Mirza Ismail. Savarkar upheld Pandit
Sharma’s demands and desired him to break his fast. After
fifty-four days Sharma broke his fast with no small amount
of success. For facts, figures and fairness had motivated his
fast and they exposed the real state of affairs in Jaipur.</p>
<p>In the third week of June 1944, Savarkar had again an
important interview with a personal representative of
President Roosevelt, Mr. Lampton Berry. During the two-
hour talk Mr. Lampton Berry discussed with Savarkar his
views and policy towards the future Indo- American relations !</p>
<p>Towards the end of June the Bombay Government put a
ban on the pilgrimage of the Hindus to Pandharpur and
Savarkar successfully directed an agitation of the Hindu
Sanghatanists for securing the religious freedom of the people.</p>
