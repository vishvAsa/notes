They were probably remnant mauryan-s who remained behind in the drAviDa country from the days of the mauryan conquest of parts of the land. The tunnel built by the mauryans through the mountains during the invasion of the drAviDa country is spoken of with amazement in one of the earliest tamiL texts, the puranAnUru. 

There were remnant mauryans in other parts of the country too. 

- One of their outposts was the konkans where chandrarav had a stronghold in Javli and still retained the name of the founder of his clan in pATalIputra. Thus, one could say that the mauryan dynasty was finally ended by shivAjI when his strike killed chandrarAv. 
- In the north central domain, the mauryans briefly reemerged under yashovarman as the shortly neo-mauryan empire with its capital at kAnyakubja, ruling from the panjab to va~Nga. It was destroyed by the Kashmirian emperor lalitAditya.
