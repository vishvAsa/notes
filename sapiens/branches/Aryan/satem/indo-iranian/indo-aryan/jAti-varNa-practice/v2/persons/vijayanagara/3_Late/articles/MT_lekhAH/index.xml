Some proud and mighty Moslem kings killed by you in battle have arrived in svarga [1]. Here they caused the devas to smile in amusement by their salaaming and addressing bR^ihaspati as pIr, indra as suratrANa, and indrANi as bIbI.”&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&#34;https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2004/11/23/the-post-talikota-struggle/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;After the fall of Vijayanagar some historians believe that Tirumala, the brother of Ramaraya made an attempt to revive the city but failed. It is believed that there was a conflict between him and his nephew Pedda Tirumala over the control of the city and hence he decided to abandon it.+++(4)+++ With the Vijayanagar army in shambles, Ramaraya’s nepotism at the expense of traditional Hindu civil officers left the whole kingdom in a state of chaos. Moslem horsemen roved over the countryside extorting money and goods from the people. There was also a profusion of robberies and plundering operations by gangs of warlords in the Telugu country. In the Tamil country Nayakas of Madurai, Tanjavur and Gingee established independent kingdoms, which to a great extant restored local stability in these regions. It took Tirumala a whole six years to restore civil administration and rebuild an army. He attacked Portuguese horse traders and seized horses from them to raise a cavalry. He made Penukonda his capital and started heavily fortifying it to prepare for a major defensive war.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The reign of Ramaraya and the battle of Talikota.</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&#34;https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2004/11/07/the-reign-of-ramaraya-and-the-battle-of-talikota/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One of the most fateful events in Hindu history was the battle of&#xA;Talikota that occurred during the time of Ramaraya who was the de facto&#xA;ruler of Vijayanagar. Several attempts have been made by secularist&#xA;writers to paint Ramaraya as a villain and downplay his eventful reign.&#xA;He did commit miscalculations in different directions: 1) He killed many&#xA;of Hindu Nayakas and replaced them by his own clansmen resulting in&#xA;considerable discontent amongst the Hindu elite. He seized power through&#xA;intrigue from the clan of Krishnadeva Raya and made himself the&#xA;principal ruler of the Vijayaganagar Empire, displeasing many of the&#xA;chiefs. 2) In a manner similar to the modern Indian state, he went&#xA;against the age-old policy of the Vijayanagara state in recruiting&#xA;Moslem soldiers indiscriminately in his army. 3) He dismissed the&#xA;traditional Hindu civil service officials to place his own favorites and&#xA;henchmen in their place. But he was by no means a slouch when it came to&#xA;defending the Hindu Dharma at a very critical junction.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
