With the shots fired by Nathuram Vinayak Godse
disappeared one of the greatest political figures from the stage
of world politics. The act was committed in broad daylight,
in a public place, in the sight of a multitude by a man dressed
in khaki bush jacket and blue trousers. The newspapers
described him as a batchelor of thirty-seven with medium
height, fair skin, square jaws, a resolute and sober face, serious
flickering eyes, a high forehead, close-cropped hair, all giving
the appearance of a man of serious purpose.

The news of the assassination of Gandhi ji spread like wild
fire. It was indeed tragic, tearing and terrific. A wave of
shock and grief passed over the whole country like an earth-
quake. Shops were slammed in, flags lowered, cinema shows
cancelled. Vivisected and broken-hearted Mother India shed
piteous tears for her great son, as does a mother for her son
despite her own malady.

Depressed looked the vrhole world for a while. With wide
mouth it paid its fitting tributes to the memory of the great
man. The Indian minorities were distressed. The Muslims
said they were orphaned. The Anglo-Indians bemoaned the
loss as never before. The Bohra head priest grieved, and the
Afghan Sai'dars were moved.

The reaction of this terrific act on the Hindu Mahasabha
and the R.S.S. was too severe and drastic. In his early youth
Godse was a worker of the R.S.S. and later, he was a
prominent member of the All-India Committee of the Hindu
Mahasabha. He was a well-known journalist in Maharashtra
and the editor of a Marathi Daily, the Agrani , — the Leader —
changed to a new name, the Hindu Rashtra at a later stage.
Better known as Pandit Nathuram Godse, this editor was a
staunch Savarkarite, and was fairly known as the vanguard
and lieutenant of Savarkar. But when the vivisection of
Mother India was declared as a settled fact, in his
extreme love for the Hindu Nation, Nathuram Godse



RED FORT ORDEAL AND AFTER 369

repudiated even the saner leadership of Savarkar. Naturally,
the attention of the hooligans was riveted upon men and institu-
tions of his erstwhile association in Maharashtra. Furious
crowds pulled down and burnt Hindu Sabha flags, destroyed
Local and District Hindu Sabha offices, burnt printing houses
and studios belonging to the Hindu Sabha leaders, attacked
persons of Hindu Sabha persuasion and particularly persons
from the clan of Godse ; shops and houses of the Hindu
Sanghatanists were in flames and at some places even personal
and party enmity under ihis plea or that pretext Was vented
on men, women and chiidren. And all this in the name of
Gandhiji whom they worshipped as the embodiment of peace,
mercy, truth and non-violence !

Men of lesser mettle promptly declared their disassociation
from the Hindu Mahasabha. Some office-bearers of Local or
District Hindu Sabhas resigned and severed their connections
with the Hindu Mahasabha. A dusk to dawn curfew was
enforced in Poona, the city from which Nathuram Godse
hailed. Wrath was on its round, malice on its wings, and
political revenge on its prowl. In the Deccan States the long-
awaiting disgruntled souls of some non-Brahmins saw their
opportunity, and they poured out the vials of their vengeance
in the name of Gandhiji on Brahmins in particular and the
Hindu Sanghatanists in general, who happened to be
sympathizers, workers or leaders of the Hindu Mahasabha.
There was trouble and tension in a few cities between the Hindu
Sabhaites and the R.S.S. on one side and the violent crowds
of Gandhian persuasion on the other ; but the havoc wrought
by the assaults committed by interested or incited gangs
especially in the States of Kolhapur, Sangli and Miraj was
terrific, unprecedented and unparalleled. There was hardly
any bloodshed or burning incident in other Provinces, but
the massacre of a whole family consisting of an old man, his
son and his grandson for the fault of bearing the same
surname as Godse and the atrocities, arson and looting
committed in the name of Gandhiji in Maharashtra were so
dastardly and ghastly that these dark deeds of the so-called
followers of Gandhiji would put the inhuman crimes
committed by the furious followers of Robespierre into the
shade. Had it not been for the stern and efficient handling of
24



370 SAVARKAR AND HIS TIMES

the situation by Sri Morarji Desai, the Home Minister,
Government of Bombay, the rioters and looters would have
turned Maharashtra into a veritable graveyard.

And what about the first and foremost Hindu Sabhaite,
Savarkar ? On the morning of Saturday, January 31, 1948,
at about 10, fury was let loose in many parts of the city of
Bombay, which destroyed Hindu Sabha offices, burnt their
property, attacked the residences of the Hindu Sabha leaders
and workers, and stormed and attacked the house of Savarkar
known as Savarkar Sadan. The ringleaders of this furious
mob of about 500 strong broke into Savarkar’s house through
a door on the rear side. They swept down into the compart-
ments on the ground floor occupied by Bhide Guruji, a former
Secretary to Savarkar, a Hindu Sabha leader of note, and
editor of an English Weekly, the Free Hindusthan. This was
the left-hand side block on the ground floor of the one-storeyed
house of Savarkar. Savarkar was in his bedroom on the first
floor. He knew what the mob meant towards him. In his
youth, he had faced such wild drunken mobs in London streets
when he was agitating for Indian Independence. The ring-
leaders of the mob were running amuck on the ground floor.
But the presence of mind of a Savarkarite, who was present
at the moment, hoodwinked them and in the meantime the
police arrived on the scene and a bloody scene was averted.

But what was the state on the first floor during this hour of
attack ? It is characteristic of Savarkar that he keeps quiet,
cool and collected in times of grave dangers. His courage
rises with difficulties. Armed with courage and available
legitimate weapons in his hands, Savarkar stood in his bed-
room, his wife standing by his side. He asked his son Vishwas
to seek safety somewhere while he defended the house. But
true to his blood the young boy refused to run away from the
scene and save his life. This was the time for Vishwas to
show his mettle. In front of his father, on the threshold of
the bedroom stood the young boy prepared to face the mob,
determined to protect his father and to die in the action if
necessary. Had Savarkar’s bodyguard Appa Kassar been
present on the scene, crimson would have been the compound
of Savarkar’s house. But he was already arrested along with
Gajananrao Damle, personal secretary to Savarkar, in the



RED FORT ORDEAL AND AFTER 371

early hours of Saturday, eight hours after the assassination of
Gandhiji.

Defeated in its bloodthirsty designs, the mob set upon the
residence of Dr. Narayanrao Savarkar in the same locality.
Dr. Savarkar was stoned till he fell down in a pool of blood.
He suffered severe head injuries and was admitted to hospital,
and his family was removed to a distant place.

Nathuram Godse’s lieutenantship was bound to recoil upon
Savarkar. A thorough search was made of Savarkar’s house
on January 31. Savarkai kept himself in his bedroom and
the police minutely seari he<{ his residence. A police officer
asked Savarkar to accompany him to a place of safety.
Savarkar flatly refused to do so and told the officer that his
person would carry unrest and agitation wherever he went.
He told the police officer that he would not move an inch, and
added that two armed guards were enough to scare away the
mob ; but if the pohce did not want to do so, then, said he, he
was ready to lay down his life for his principles. Savarkar
also issued a statement on January 31, in which he said that
the news of the assassination of Mahatma Gandhi was too
shocking and sudden and he appealed to the people to stand
by the Central Government of Free India and maintain order
in the country.

From February 1 to February 5 throughout the country
there was a general round-up of the Hindu Sabha leaders and
workers. The R.S.S. was outlawed and its leaders and workers
were also arrested. Even Sri R. K. Tatnis, the famous editor
of the well-known Marathi Weekly, the Vividhavritta,
Sri Jamnadas Mehta and Sri K. N. Dharap were put behind
the bars though they had no active connection with the Hindu
Mahasabha or the R.S.S. But Tatnis and Mehta had fearlessly
opposed Gandhiji and the Congress on the question of
Pakistan, and Dharap was a legal celebrity of Mahasabha
persuasion. All the three were, however, set at liberty by the
High Court of Bombay on Habeas Corpus apphcations on
their behalf. Excepting L. B. Bhopatkar, President of the All-
India Hindu Mahasabha, Sri G. V. Ketkar, Editor Kesari and
Mahratta, Poona, and Sri R. N. Mandlik, President of the
Maharashtra Provincial Hindu Sabha and Member of the
Bombay Legislative Council, all prominent Maiharashtrian



S^VAaKAR AND HIS TIMES


372

Badu SsJoSaa kadeis were put in jail. The total number of
pwsons attested in this general round-up in aU the Provinces
and the States was said to have exceeded 25 , 000 . Such a
huge round-up for a single act was never witnessed in India
at any other time in her history !

On the night of February 4, the police officers got Savarkar
medically examined. The doctor declared that Savarkar was
keeping dt, though Savarkar had been suffering throughout
the previous year from low fever and heart-ailment, and was
even at that time running temperature. A few hours after
this, in the early hours of February 5, came a police van to
Savarkar Sadan. Savarkar was told that he was placed under
arrest under the Bombay Public Security Measures Act. He
nodded assent and said that before entering the van he desired
to go to the lavatory. The officers hesitated. Savarkar smiled
and said ; “ Do not be afraid. I am now an old man and

you should not fear a repetition of Marseilles, nor is there any
occasion for it.” The officer inspected the W.C. after Savarkar
came out of it, but could find nothing.

All sensible persons condemned the act of assassination. And
a few hours before his arrest, Savarkar too had issued another
statement endorsing the joint statement of Bhopatkar and
some other Members of the Working Committee of the Hindu
Mahasabha regarding ‘ the gruesome assassination of Mahatma
Gandhi ’ and said, “ I, too, as one of the Vice-Presidents of the
Hindu Mahasabha subscribe to their feeling and condemn
unequivocally such fatricidal crimes whether they are
perpetrated by the individual frenzy or mob fury.” Savarkar
concluded his statement with a warning : “ Let every

patriotic citizen set to his heart the stem warning which
History utters that a successful national revolution and a
newly-bom national State can have no worse enemy than a
fatricidal civil war, especially so when it is encompassed from
outside by alien hostility.”

Savarkar was lodged in the Arthur Road Jail, Bombay.
Now some of the local Congress-minded papers assumed the
role of justice, usurped the rights of the Court and wickedly
enough described Savarkar as the brain behind the murder of
Gandhiji. Some openly flashed the news that Damle and
Kasar had a hand in the plot. And all this when the whole



RED FORT ORDEAL AND AFTER


373


affair as to how far Savarkar was the brain, Apie the brawn,

and Godse the heart and hand was being investigated by the

police.

Tlie police officers led a blitz in a group on Savarkar, their
combined wily and wild genius being at grips with the genius
of Savarkar. Savarkar was calm and collected. XAke IDe V aVera,
the country for the independence of which, he had striven and
sacrificed his life for fifty long years, threw ham into \aiV
after the birth of a Free State. Savarkar was naturally over-
whelmed with these feelings He declined to avail himself of
the facility of home food. No interview with him was allowed
to his wife or his only son till March 23, and nothing was
heard or known about him by the public except the volcano
of obloquy let loose by hostile journals of Congress persuasion.

One man with intrepid courage and devotional vigilance
devoted himself to the defence of Savarkar amidst the all-
round erupting volcano. That man was Sri S. V. Deodhar,
a local advocate of Bombay. He interviewed Savarkar on
February 6 and took his instructions. For a long time
Savarkar was not charged with any speciftc offence. But on
March 11, 1948, Savarkar was again placed under arrest in
the Arthur Road Jail by the Delhi Police under a warrant
from the Delhi Presidency Magistrate on a charge of being
one of the conspirators in the a.ssassination of Gandhiji. When
Savarkar was produced before the Chief Presidency
Magistrate, Bombay, for a further remand, the daring advocate
moved an application for bail, but it was refused. Deodhar,
however, secured permission for Savarkar’s wife and son to
interview him, and accordingly they saw him in jail for the
first time on March 24. It was through the efforts of Deodhar
that Savarkar could execute a general power of attorney in
favour of his son, thus facilitating the arrangement of funds
for his household affairs and for his defence. Savarkar was
now in full control of every nerve. On May 18 he made an
important affidavit before the Chief Presidency Magistrate,
Bombay, regarding a group photograph that was taken by the
police with Savarkar in the centre and Godse and Apte on
either side together with the other alleged conspirators who
had been arrested on different dates in the first half of
February and brought to Bombay for investigation purposes.



374 SAVARKAR AND HIS TIMES

By now tho Icsdcr and famous advocate in Bhopatkar was
on the move with all his legal acumen and with all his moral
courage. Sri Mandlik also was bringing the issue of Savarkar^s
arrest to the forefront. At the time of the passing of the Budget,
Mandlik severely criticized the Bombay Government in the
Bombay Legislative Council for denying Savarkar even the
freedom of interview with his family and legal counsels. On
April 3 Mandlik asked the Home Minister, Sri Morarji Desai,
as to why the confiscated property of the Savarkars was not
returned to Savarkar in appreciation of his past services in
the cause of Indian Independence, as was done in the case of
other patriotic sufferers of Congress persuasion of even
recent period. The Home Minister replied that the Govern-
ment did not propose to return the property to Savarkar and
on a supplementary question, he added sarcastically, though
Savarkar’s case was now sub jiidice, that Savarkar’s present
disservice was more than his past service. Upon this Mandlik
sprang up and asked the Home Minister to define Savarkar’s
‘ present ’ disservice to which the Home Minister had referred ;
but there was no reply. Savarkar’s must be a rare case, a
case of one of the greatest patriots under the sun wherein the
property confiscated for his struggle for national freedom was
not returned to the patriot even after the nation had become
free. Men of lesser patriotism and later-day struggle were
given back their confiscated properties by the Congress
Ministries ; but it seemed as if the Congressmen in the
Ministry, who were themselves not politically born nor were
the makers of their Ministries out of their swaddling clothes
when Savarkar stamped the pages of world history with the
cry of Indian Independence, were not even desirous of doing
Savarkar bare justice, let alone honouring the greatest patriot
of our day.


II

In the meantime, news appeared in the Times of India,
Bombay, that Government were weighing the evidence
regarding Savarkar’s complicity in the plot. After three
months and a half, the preliminaries were completed. And
at last, for want of proper legal opinion, the Government of



RED FORT ORDEAL AND AFTF. R 375

India were led to rope in Savarkar, one of the greatest political
figures for all times, with the other alleged conspirators. A
notification in the Gazette of India Extraordinary dated May
15, 1948, declared the names of the nine accused among whom
flashed the name of Savarkar as the eighth accused. The
notification also announced that Sri Atma Charan, I.C.S. was
appointed a Special Judge to try the case in the historic Red
Fort at Delhi. The trial was expected to begin towards the
end of May 1948.

The tide of mob violence almost ebbed in April 1948. But
the atmosphere was still full of dread. The Public Security
Measures Act held its sway all over the Province. The defence
of Savarkar was the uppermost thought for his family and
the Mahasabha leaders of Maharashtra. The nerve of the Hindu
Mahasabha leaders in Maharashtra did not give way. History
has witnessed that in a great crisis, Maharashtrian leadership
keeps its nerve and mind. So was it proved during the historic
days of Rajarara and post-Panipat period. Bhopatkar,
Ketkar and Mandlik rose to keep up the traditional spirit.
Sri Jamnadas Mehta, who had played an important role in
effecting Savarkar ’s release in 1937, rose to the occasion and
played a very effective role in this trial also ! The part
Sri Gajananrao Ketkar played with his colleagues in .solving
the deadlock regarding Savarkar’s defence was as skilful and
courageous as it was spirited and masterly. It was through
his qualities of head and heart that the issue of the Defence
Fund was brought to the forefront so that the Defence
Fund was volunteered even by farmers, villagers and students
in instalments of rupee one or two amounting to a lakh in
the end. Hindu Sanghatanists in Bengal, Punjab, Madras and
other Provinces, too, at a later stage joined the Defence Com-
mittee in collecting the Defence Fund as a token of moral
support.

Just before the commencement of the trial, all the accused,
who were then in Bombay, were taken to Delhi on May 24.
Savarkar was alone taken to Delhi the next day by air,
accompanied by two medical experts and oxygen tubes. All
the accused were lodged in a specially selected part of the
Red Fort and it was declared to be a prison. It was also
declared that the Court would hold its sittings in a hall in the



376 SAVARKAR AND HIS TIMES

upper storey of a building in the Red Fort, the famous Fort
where the Moguls held trials and where recently the I.N.A.
leaders were tried. The Court was well furnished and
arrangements for accommodation of the Court visitors and for
the accused were .specially made. The Court room was fitted
with microphones for making the proceedings audible.
Admission to the court was regulated by pa.s.ses available on
production of a certificate of fitness from a Magistrate or a
Gazetted Officer. Passes were valid for one daj' only and
visitors and even counsels were liable to be searched at the
gate. The Court and its surroundings wei'e guarded by police
and military force.

The trial opened at 10 a.m. on May 27, 1948, the day on
which Savarkar completed his fateful sixty-fifth year ! Sri C.
K. Daphtary, Advocate-General, Bombay, led the prosecution
and was assisted by four other counsels. Sri L. B. Bhopatkar,
President of the All-India Hindu Mahasabha, an eminent
author of many Law Books and a legal celebrity, led the
Defence and represented Savarkar, accused No. 8. The
principal accused, Nathuram Vinayak Godse, was represented
by Sri V. V. Oak, Bar-at-law, Bombay ; Narayan D. Apte
was represented by K. H. Mengle ; Vishnu R. Karkare by N.
D. Dange, Bombay ; Madanlal K. Pahwa by B. B. Banerji,
Delhi, Shankar Kistaya by H. R. Metha (Government) ; Gopal
Godse by M. B. Maniar and Dr. Parchiure by P. L. Inamdar,
Gwalior. Sri G. K. Dua and Sri M. B. Maniar helped Dange
and Inamdar and Sri Jamnadas Mehta, Lala Ganpat Rai,
Delhi, Sri K. L. Bhopatkar, Poona, Sri J. P. Mitter, Calcutta,
and Sri N. P. Aiyar, Madras, assisted Bhopatkar during the
trial in the defence of Savarkar, and at the time of arguments
Sri P. R. Das, brother of Deshbandhu Das, and a retired
High Court Judge, Patna, argued the case for Savarkar. The
President of the Hindu Mahasabha was defending its former
President Savarkar. Bhopatkar was then seventy and had
to forego a lucrative practice at the Poona Bar for months.
Political reactions to his brave defence of Savarkar were not
without strain. A lesser man would have gone down in
standing for such a daring defence which was nothing less
than an opposition and resistance to a powerful unfavourable
current then in its meridian in the country.



RED FORT ORDEAL AND AFTER 377

Out of the twelve persons cited in the charge sheet, the first
nine were produced on the first day, the remaining three,
Gangadhar Dandvate, Gangadhar Jadhav and Suryadeo
Sharnia were stated to have absconded. When the trial
opened, Savarkar looked sober, self-collected, but pale and
physically pulled down ; Godse, the central figure, wore a
scowl ; Apte, Karkare, Mandanlal, Badge, Gopal Godse,
Kistaya and Dr. Parchure were in good spirits and freely
talked with each other in il •, dock. On the first day the Court
acceded to the Chief Defer;',e Counsel's request for a chair to
be provided for Savarkar in the dock. Then deciding a legal
point raised by Bhopatkar, the judge said that the trial would
be treated as if the accused had already been committed to
Sessions. The Court met again on June 3 to consider the
timings of the sittings, the language of the proceedings, etc.,
and adjourned to June 22, 1948.

In the meanwhile, the Bombay Public Security Measures
Act was made applicable by the Central Government to the
Province of Delhi on June 2, 1948, under the provisions of the
Delhi Laws Act of 1912 and came into force with effect from
June 13, 1947. It was declared on June 14, 1948, that the
Special Court at Delhi constituted under sections 10 and 11 of
the Bombay Public Security Measures Act as extended to the
Province of Delhi was empowered to tender pardon to an
accused under a special ordinance XIV of 1948. Accordingly
Digambar Badge was tendered the King’s pardon on June 21,
and Badge turned approver in the case.

On June 22 the trial resumed hearing in the Red Fort. The
Chief Prosecution Counsel, Sri Daphtary, in his opening
speech charged all the eight accused in the dock with
conspiracy, murder and offences under the Arms Act and
Explosive Substances Act. The story of the prosecution was
that Nathuram Godse was the tool, Apte the brain and
Savarkar was the Guru and guide behind the murder of
Gandhiji. The prosecution stated that Savarkar was a very
well-known name, a leader of a particular line of thought and
President for a considerable period of the Hindu Mahasabha.
The prosecution further said that his books were numerous
and vigorous and were the text books for persons of certain
views and thought and some of those books were published



378 SAVABKAR AND HIS TIMES

by Nathuram Godse and Apte. The Prosecution Chief added :
“ It has been well known that he has been no lover, to put it
mildly, of either non-violence or of any policy of favouring
the Muslim Party.” The Chief of the Prosecution concluded :
“ Evidence is sufficient to prove not only that he had
knowledge of what was going to be done, but that it could not
have been done except with his complicity.”

After the charges were read out and explained to the
accused, all the accused pleaded ‘ not guilty ’ and claimed to
be tried.

The recording of the prosecution evidence began on June
24, and continued till November 6. During the course of his
deposition the approver Badge told the court that he had
accompanied Apte and Godse to Savarkar Sadan, Bombay,
on 14 January 1948, that Godse and Apte went inside with a
bag containing the stuff leaving him outside the compound,
and returned 5-10 minutes later with the bag containing the
stuff. The approver further said in his evidence that on
January 15, 1948, Apte asked him in the compound of Dixitji
Maharaj, Bombay, whether he was prepared to accompany
him (Apte) to Delhi and told the approver that Tatyarao
(Savarkar) had decided that Gandhiji, Nehru and Suhrawardy
should be finished and had entrusted that work to them. The
approver also told the Court that on a suggestion from
Nathuram Godse, Godse, Apte and Badge had been to
Savarkar Sadan on January 17, 1948, to take the last Darshun
of Savarkar and while be was sitting in the room on the
ground floor of the house, he heard Savarkar saying to Godse
and Apte who were coming downstairs, “ Be successful and
come.” On their way back, Apte told the approver, so
went the story of the approver, that (Tatyarao) Savarkar had
predicted that Gandhiji’s hundred years were over and that
there was no doubt that their work would be successfully
finished. The approver said that he accompanied Apte and
Godse to Delhi because Apte told him that it was Savarkar’s
command. It seemed this was all the prosecution evidence
against Savarkar. Badge was subjected to a gruelling cross-
examination by Sri L. B. Bhopatkar when the approver said
that he regarded Savarkar not only as the leader of the
Hindus, but also God incarnate (Devata). He also said that



RED FORT ORDEAL AND AFTER 379

Savarkar’s birthday was celebrated every year as Jayanti Day
like Shiva Jayanti and Krishna Jayanti and that he had seen
Savarkar only once in 1943. Badge admitted that Bhide
Guruji and Gajananrao Damle also resided on the ground
floor of Savarkar Sadan.

Out of the few other prosecution witnesses produced to
prove Savarkar’s complicity m the plot, Miss Shantabai B.
Modak, Maharashtrian ire.ss, who had given a lift to
Nathuram Godse and Nara n Apte and dropped them near
by Savarkar Sadan, on January 14, admitted when cross-
examined by Sri Oak that she did not see Apte and Godse
entering the compound of Savarkar Sadan. The story of
another prosecution witness. Prof. J. C. Jain, Bombay, was
that Madanlal Pahwa, who met the professor before the
assassination of Gandhiji, had told the Professor that Savarkar
had patted him on the back for his work in the Refugee Camp
and said ‘ carry on ’. The Home Minister of Bombay,
Sri Morarji Desai, and one Angad Singh told the story as
related to them by Prof. Jain. As far as Savarkar was
concerned, there was no evidence against him except the
alleged uncorroborated talk of this Madanlal with Savarkar
in all these three depositions. The taxi-driver said in his
evidence that he had taken Godse, Apte, Badge and Kistaya
to Shivaji Park, Dadar, but he did not know the name of the
owner of the house into which Godse, Apte and Badge went.
The story of the trunk-phone call from the Hindu Mahasabha
Bhavan, New Delhi, to Savarkar Sadan, Bombay, was also
narrated by prosecution witnesses. But the call was not
meant for the inmates of Savarkar Sadan and so that point
was also a failure.


Ill

After the examination and cross-examination of 149 prosecu-
tion witnesses in all, the statements of the accused were heard.
On November 8 Nathuram Godse submitted his state-
ment in which he frankly admitted that he fired three shots
at Gandhiji whom he considered to be the father of Pakistan.
Godse and Apte both denied that they had either seen
Savarkar or entered the compound of his house as alleged by



380 SAVARKAR AND HIS TIMES

the prosecution. Immediately, on the next day, Godse’s
92-page statement was banned by the Central Government.
Madanlal denied having seen Savarkar at all as alleged by the
prosecution. Kistaya also stated that it was true that
Nathuram Godse, Apte and Badge had been to a certain
house in Shivaji Park locality, but he added that he did not
know to whom the house belonged, nor was it true what the
approver told that he (Kistaya) accompanied them to that
house ; as in fact he did not alight from the car when Badge
and others got down and went somewhere in the locality.

On November 20 Savarkar read his 52-page statement in
which he said he did not commit any of the offences with
which he was charged, nor had he any reason to do so. He
solemnly asserted that he was never a party to any agreement
or conspiracy as alleged by the prosecution, nor had he any
knowledge of any such criminal design.

Savarkar proceeded : “ Badge, the approver, alleges that

I (Savarkar) had decided that Gandhiji, Nehru and
Suhrawardy .should be finished. Apte and Godse both deny
that they ever told it to Badge and they were never told by
me any such things as alleged. There is absolutely no
evidence to corroborate Badge’s allegation. The first allega-
tion of Badge is thus not only a hearsay, but an uncorrobo-
rated hearsay.”

Savarkar added that as regards the second sentence which
Badge said he had personally heard him (Savarkar) saying
to Apte and Godse, “ be successful and come back,” it was
only an inference that it might have been in connection with
the conspiracy. Moreover, Apte and Godse, continued
Savarkar, both asserted that the story of the visit of the three
to his house and the allegation of his having uttered that
sentence was but a fabrication and totally false. “ Taking for
granted,” stated Savarkar, “ that Badge himself is telling the
truth when he says Apte told him that sentence, the question
still remains whether what Apte told Badge was true or false.
There was no evidence to show that I had ever told Apte to
finish Gandhiji, Nehru and Suhrawardy. Apte might have
invented this wicked lie to exploit my moral influence on
Hindu Sanghatanists for his own purpose.” Savarkar further



RED FORT ORDEAL AND AFTER 381

said that he had never predicted that Gandhiji's hundred years
were over, to Apte or to anyone else.

Detailing his personal life and political line of thought
since 1908, he narrated his association with Gandhiji since
1908 and he read pertinent extracts from his public statements
issued from time to time on the arrest of Gandliiji and Nehru,
regarding the murderous attack on Jinnah and pertaining to
the sad death of Mrs. Kasturba Gandhi. He also briefly
outlined the object of the Hindu Mahasabha of which he was
President successively for seven years.

He then referred to the fateful events in 1947 and said : “ I

had been foremost in leading the movement against the vivi*-
section of India. But in the year 1947 our Motherland was
at last divided. However, although Pakistan came into
existence yet to counterbalance that loss, by far the larger
part of Hindusthan succeeded in achieving its freedom from
foreign domination.” And when Savarkar came to the point
of the vivisection of his Motherland, tears rolled down his
cheeks and his voice was choked as he finished the sentence :
“The fight for political independence in which as a soldier I
too had fought, suffered and sacrificed for the last fifty years
in no measure less than any other patriotic leader in my
generation, was at last won and a free and independent State
was born. I felt myself blessed to have survived to see my
country free.” He wiped his tears with his handkerchief and
continued to read his statement in a low voice. The news-
papers flashed the moving atmosphere of the court in these
words : “ Every one in the court seemed to share the emotions
that overwhelmed the Hindu Sabha leader. The whole court
was in pin-drop silence.”

Savarkar then defined his attitude towards the Central
Government. He observed : “ No doubt a part of the Mission
remained unaccomplished, but we had not renounced our
ambition to restore once more the integrity of our Motherland
from the Indus to the Seas. For the realization of this
ambition too it was imperative to consolidate that which we
had already won. With this end in view I tried to impress
on the public mind that first of all the Central Government
must be rendered strong whatever party may happen to lead
it. Any change in that lead however desirahle^ should be



382 SAVARKAR AND HIS TIMES

effected by constitutional means alone, for any act of violence
or civil strife inside our camp was bound to endanger the
state. Revolutionary mentality, which was inevitable and
justifiable while we were struggling against an alien and
armed oppression, must be instantly changed into a constitu-
tional one if we wanted to save our State from dangerous
party-strifes and civil wars. With this motto I wished that
the two leading organizations, the Congress and the Maha-
sabha, which were in fact coming very close to each other,
should form a common front and strengthen the hands of the
Central Government of our State. To that end I accepted the
new National Flag. Though ill, I went to preside over the
All-Party Hindu Conference at Delhi and attended the
Mahasabha Working Committee. The majority of the veteran
leaders of the Mahasabha as well as some foremost Congressite
leaders had also been striving to form such a common front
in co-operation with me. The Mahasabha Working Committee
passed a resolution to back up the Central Government.
Dr, S. P. Mookerji, the Mahasabha leader, was already
included in the Central Ministry and the step was appreciated
by all of us.”

As regcirds the deposition of other witnesses in reference
to him, Savarkar said that he did not know Madanlal, neither
had he met him, nor had he any conversation with him at any
time whatsoever, and since the evidence of Professor Jain,
Angad Singh and Sri Morarji Desai was hearsay testimony,
he pleaded that it should be excluded entirely from considera-
tion. He pointed out that Nathuram Godse and Narayan Apte
were men of independent nature as was revealed by the
approver and they were not to be led by the nose. He also
respectfully stated before the court : “ Does it not often

happen that some of the followers who actually try to exploit
the moral influence of the leaders to further their activities
which the leader had never sanctioned ? In 1942, in the
‘ Quit India Movement ’ some leading workers, who had been
close associates of Gandhiji as Congressmen and respected
him, resorted to underground violence. I am not concerned
here with the question whether such an underground move-
ment against a foreign domination was or was not justifled.
It is enough to say that Mahatma Gandhi condemned all



383


red fort ordeal and after

underground violence. But masses resorted under the lead of
those workers to arson, sabotage and bloodshed, shouting all
the while ‘ Mahatma Gandhi ki Jai ^ But even the British
Government did not put Gandhiji in the dock for their crime
simply because the masses respected him and were doing those
very criminal acts and shouting ‘ Gandhiji ki Jai ’ and there-
fore they must have had consulted him/’

In the end, Savarkar pleaded that since not a word had been
found to incriminate him in the 10,000 letters which the prose-
cution had seized from his liouse and since Badge’s allegations
were uncorroborated hearsay and uncorroborated inference,
he prayed the judge to acquit him without the least blemish
on his character and order him to be released forthwith.

The accused were then asked whether they meant to adduce
evidence in defence. All of them declined to adduce evidence
in rebuttal of the prosecution evidence or in support of the
statements made by them.

After the statements of the eight accused were recorded, the
counsels’ arguments were heard from December 1 to Decem-
ber 30, 1948. Nathuram Godse argued his case himself for
about three days and laid stress on the point that it was a
cold-blooded act of his own and was committed not in con-
sultation or in conspiracy with anybody else and as he had
shown no mercy to the man whom he had killed, he concluded,
he did not want the court to show any mercy to himself.
Sri Mengle argued the case on behalf of Apte, Dange for
Karkare, B. Banerji for Madanlal, Mehta for Kistaya and
Inamdar for Gopal Godse and Dr. Parchure. Sri P. R. Das,
a retired High Court Judge from Patna and brother of
Deshbandhu C. R. Das, volunteered his services for the defence
of Savarkar and argued the case in a powerful and masterful
manner for Savarkar in particular and as regards the point
of conspiracy in general. Sure of ultimate success. Das con-
cluded that he did not doubt as to what would be the decision
of the court regarding his client. He emphasized that he ex-
pected a clean acquittal for Savarkar without blemish on his
character. It was a tribute to the broad-mindedness of Sri
L. B. Bhopatkar, the Chief Defence Counsel, that although
in no way unequal to the occasion in his legal acumen, he
made sure of the acquittal of Savarkar, the only object of his



384 SAVARKAR AND HIS TIMES

heart and pride by adding strength and influence to the
defence of Savarkar through his masterly and thorough cross-
examination of the prosecution witnesses and then by putting
forth the arguments through the legal genius of Sri P. R. Das.

At last after eighty-four sittings spread over seven long
months, the day of judgment dawned on February 10, 1949.
Exactly at 11 a.m. the Special Judge, Sri Atma Charan, com-
menced to deliver his judgment. . In the course of the judg-
ment, Sri Atma Charan said : “ Vinayak Damodar Savarkar

in his statement says that he had no hand in the conspiracy,
if any, and had no control whatsoever over Nathuram Godse
and Narayan D. Apte. It has been mentioned above that the
prosecution case against Vinayak D. Savarkar rests on the
evidence of the approver and approver alone. It has further
been mentioned earlier that it would be unsafe to base any
conclusion on the evidence of the approver as against Vinayak
D. Savarkar. There is thus no reason to suppose that
Vinayak Damodar had any hand in what took place at Delhi
on 20-1-1948 and 30-1-1948.”

The learned judge concluded : “ Vinayak D. Savarkar : He
is found not guilty of the offences as specified in the charge,
and is acquitted thereunder. He is in custody and be released
forthwith unless required otherwise.”

Nathuram Godse was sentenced to death for his deliberate
and calculated act. Narayan D. Apte was also sentenced to
death as the real brain behind the murder, and the other
five accused, Vishnu Karkare, Madanlal Pahwa, Gopal V.
Godse, Shankar Kistaya and Dr. Dattatraya Parchure, who
were found guilty of conspiracy and abetment, were sen-
tenced each to transportation for life. As soon as the judge
rose to depart, all the prisoners fell at the feet of Savarkar
in the dock and raised shouts of ‘ Akhand Hindusthan Amar
Rahe ; Hindu-Hindi Hindusthan, Kabi Na Honga Pakistan
It may be mentioned here that later, on June 21, 1949, Shankar
Kistaya and Dr. Parchure were both acquitted by the Pun-
jab High Coxart in an appeal as it was believed that Kistaya
did no more than carry out his master’s orders and the con-
fession of Dr. Parchure on which his conviction was based,
was found to be unreliable and vmsatisfactory by the Appeal
Court. The appeal of Godse, who again argued his own case



red fort ordeal and after 385

on the point of conspiracy and the appeals of Apte, Madanlal
and Gopal Godse, were not granted and eventually Nathuram
Godse and Narayan Apte died unrepentantly on the gallows
on the morning of November 15, 1949, in the Ambala Prison
vivtb the BKogauat Gita in their hands.

Savarkar did not enjoy the trial as he had enjoyed the
Nasik Trial thirty years ago. At the fag end of his life he
was put into a fiery ordeal. So he had to control every nerve,
every muscle and every drop of his blood with his uncommon
will power to outlive the obloquy and the ordeal. Like a
yogin, he wrote his plain letters to his son asking him to be
self-supporting and consoling his wife that after the greatest
catastrophe they had passed nearly twenty-five years in
happiness. He himself had to suffer unparalleled mental tor-
ments and agonies and he felt all the while a year and a week
the ingratitude on the part of his countrymen, who aimed
at damning him in the eyes of the world. That was a burn-
ing ordeal. It was therefore quite natural for such a man
of great will power and the burning emblem of sacrifice that
not a muscle on his face moved as he heard the decision of
the Court in the Red Fort.

Savarkar’s acquittal was a thunderbolt to his ill-wishers.
What a shame ! To Savarkarites and Hindu Sanghatanists
all over India, his release therefore was an occasion for great
rejoicings. Telegrams and letters of congratulations were
showered on him from all parts of India and from abroad.
Almost all Maharashtrian leading newspapers gave a sigh of
relief at the acquittal of Savarkar. So did the Hindu
Sanghatanists and other unbiased straightforward newspapers
all over India.

But no sooner was the acquittal of Savarkar pronounced,
than he was served with a notice under an order of the
Delhi Magistrate prohibiting him from leaving the Red Fort
area. It was a keen disappointment for the vast crowds that
had gathered outside the Red Fort to give an ovation to
, Savarkar whom they wanted to take out in a procession. A
few hours later, by another order under the Punjab Public
Security Measures Act, Savarkar was externed and was pro-
hibited from entering the Delhi area for a period of three
months and was escorted under police protection to his house

2S



386 SAVARKAR AND HIS TIMES

at Shivaji Park, Bombay. The train carjying him reached
Dadar, Bombay, at about 10-30 a.m. on February 12, 1919.
The news of his departure from Delhi was kept a secret. Yet
hundreds of Hindu Sanghatanist workers and leaders greeted
Savarkar at the station. Savarkar was put by the police
officer, who escorted him from Delhi, in a motor car waiting
outside the station, and was driven to Savarkar Sadan. At
his house his wife and some ladies waved auspicious lighted
wicks around his face in the traditional Hindu fashion and
thus ended the Red Fort ordeal !

After taking rest for about a month at Bombay, Savarkar
went to Bangalore for a few days for a change. On his way
back, he heard the news about the accident to the aeroplane
in which Sardar Patel was travelling and about his miracu-
lous escape in the neighbourhood of Jaipur. On reaching
Bombay, Savarkar immediately congratulated Sardar Patel
on his safety and said in the course of the congratulatory
telegram that “ the Sardar ’s life constituted a national asset and
his grasp of the realities and his firm hold on the helm had
steered the ship of the newly-born Bharatiya State clear of
many a rock and shoal.” On May 28 Savarkar’s birthday
was celebrated as usual by ail the District and Provincial
Hindu Sabhas all over India and some public meetings
passed resolutions demanding that Government should insti-
tute an inquiry into the causes that led to the prosecution of
Savarkar without the least clear evidence against him.
Savarkar, however, wanted the fire of acrimony enkindled by
his prosecution to be extinguished and so he communi-
cated to the Bombay Government his desire that a curtain
be dropped on the whole affair.

Towards the end of May 1949, the Constituent Assembly
passed one important article abolishing the separate electo-
rates, reservations and weightages which were based on the
invidious racial and religious discriminations. Upon this
Savarkar, who was the first nationalist leader to demand this
very thing years ago, sent a telegram to Sardar Patel con-
gratulating him for having thus vindicated ‘ the genuine



hed fort ordeal and after 387

national clvaracter ol our Bharatiya State ’ and hoped ‘ that
the adtniiustration would boldly carry it into effect in letter
and in spirit.’ Thanking Savarkar in return, Sardar Patel
said in his reply of June 2, that ‘ Government was already
doing and would continue to do its best to act accordin^y.’

In the middle of July 1949, Savarkar sent a telegram to
Sri M. S. Golwalkar, Chief of the R.S.S., extending his felici-
tations on the withdrawal of the ban on the R.S.S. and on the
release of the R.S.S. leader himself.

The Constituent Assembly had by now far advanced in the
framing of the constitution and now the question of the
appellation of the country, the choice of the script and the
Lingua Franca were being hotly discussed in the Assembly
and outside. Savarkar wired to the President of the Consti-
tuent Assembly his views on the subject. He said : “ I am
voicing the sense and sentiment of millions of our country-
men when I beseech the Constituent Assembly to adopt
Bharat, as the name of our nation, Hindi as the national lan-
guage and Nagari as the national script.” All the three were
subsequently incorporated into the Constitution by the Consti-
tuent Assembly for the Bharatiya Republic.

Just then Master Tara Singh, who was interned since some
months, was released. Savarkar offered him felicitations on
his release as he considered that “ Master Tara Singh was one
of the few leaders who kept up the heroic spirit of our people
of the Punjab in the dark days of the partition and saved the
East Punjab at any rate for us.”

In the same month Savarkar’s younger brother Dr.
Narayanrao Savarkar, passed away at the age of 61 on October
19, after remaining in an unconscious state for a fortnight from
an attack of paralysis. His illness and mental agony dated
back to January 1948 when he was murderously attacked by a
riotous mob of goondas inunediately after the assassination of
Gandhiji and from which he never recovered completely
afterwards. Next to none in national service, patriotic sacri-
fice, courage and intelligence, this silver-tongued orator of
Maharashtra, who had been during the British regime a symbol
of sedition, sacrifice, revolt and terror while his brothers were
rotting in the Andamans, died with an uncomproifiising
opposition to the anti-Hindu and un-Hindu forces. It was a



38ft SAVARKAH ANO HIS TIMES

cruel misfortune that Savarkar should witness the last of his
brothers consumed by fire.

In the meanwhile, the scattered forces of the Hindu
Sabhaites were preparing to hold the annual Session of the
Hindu Mahasabha at Calcutta. After a pressing and fervent
request from the veteran revolutionary leader, Sri Upendra-
nath Banerjee, who was a co-sufferer with Savarkar in the
Andamans and was a Congressman for a long time, and
had turned a Hindu Sabhaite after the Hindu Bengal had
reaped the fruits of partition, and ardent appeals from Sri
Ashutosh Lahiri, Savarkar decided to go to Calcutta, and
started on December 21, 1949, to attend the annual Session
of the Hindu Mahasabha. Almost throughout the journey,
Savarkar had to make brief speeches at several stations to
respond to the greetings of the crowds that awaited his arrival.
In Calcutta Savarkar was taken out in a huge procession along
with Dr. Khare, the President-elect, and Sri L. B. Bhopatkar,
the retiring President. Thousands of people participated in the
procession. In the Session, too, all attention was centred on
Savarkar. His acquittal in the Red Fort Trial had now added
colour and a further romance to his already romantic life.
Hindu Sanghatanists from all parts of the country gathered
in thousands at Calcutta to declare to the whole world that
their saviour had at last come back to guide them.

When Savarkar entered the Pandal, the huge congregation
stood up as if electrified with his darshan. It became hilarious
while shouting ‘ Veer Savarkar ki Jai ’ when Savarkar stood
before the mike with his palms characteristically resting on
the handle of his umbrella and wearing his brimless black
round cap. In his ninety-minute inaugural address to the
Session, Savarkar stressed first the point that the Indepen-
dence of India was a victory and not a political gift from the
British. He asserted that the independence was not accom-
plished by. the Congress alone, or the revolutionaries alone ;
it was, he said, the sxunmation of the struggle, sacrifice and
sufferings of thousands of patriots from 1857 to 1947 inside
and outside India. He ai&med that India was after all now
a Hindu State established under a Hindu Flag with the
Dharma-Chakra of the Hindu Race as its State Symbol. He
then stressed the need for continuing the Hindu Mahasabha

and exhorted the Hindu youths to join the Indian army, navy
and air forces in thousands. He also pleaded for the adopUon
of constitutional and democratic legal means for the fulfilment
of their objectives and appealed to the Hindus not to take the
law into their own hands. He suggested that there should be
a policy of tit for tat in our dealings with Pakistan and de-
clared : “It is the duty of our people to consolidate our posi-
tion first, and if we are true to our Mother and Soul, by ten
years’ time we can restore the territories that have been torn
away.”

The President, Dr. Khare, proclaimed in his usual fearless-
ness the re-entry of the Hindu Mahasabha into the field of
politics with the ideology of a cultural State and the Hindu
Rashtra as its guiding stars and affirmed that “ but for the
pressure increasingly applied by the Hindu Mahasabha, the
Congress could not have abandoned separate electorates or
adopted Hindi with Devanagari script as the Rashtra Bhasha.”

On January 26, 1950, was inaugurated the Sovereign Demo-
cratic Bharatiya Republic imder the Presidentship of Dr.
Rajendra Prasad. Savarkar issued a statement to the nation
on this occasion to commemorate the emancipation of our
Motherland from the British bondage. He also congratulated
Dr. Rajendra Prasad on his becoming the first President of
the Republic. In his congratulatory telegram, he ‘ placed his
services entirely at the disposal of the Republic in any
national undertaking and hoped that the foremost task of
creating the strongest possible Bharatiya army, navy and air
forces to defend our new-born Republic would receive his
immediate attention.’ Savarkar ended his congratulatory
message with the words ‘ Long live Akhand Bharat.*

In March 1950, the East Bengal burst into a conflagration.
The Noakhali tragedies were ruthlessly repeated. As fore-
told by Savarkar, the birth of Pakistan endangered the peace
and prosperity of Hindusthan, led the Indians to agony,
misery and sufferings, and Pakistan ‘ sought every opportu-
nity for expansion.* Moved by these tragedies in the £!ast
Bengal, even leaders like Sri Jai Prakash Narayan suggested
that our forces should be sent to the disturbed areas if
nothing else could stop the carnage. The general opinion in
the press and the platform seemed to favour the adoption of
some such drastic step. At this juncture, it was declared that

390 SAVARKAR AND HIS TIMES

Savarkar was going to attend the East Punjab Hindu Confer-
ence at Rohatak in the second week of April. Savarkar was
to break his journey at Delhi where the people had planned
to accord him an imposing reception.

About this time Pandit Nehru in good faith thought it fit
to try his method of negotiations to solve the Bengal problem
and invited Mr. Liaqat Ali Khan, the Premier of Pakistan,
to Delhi for a parley. The Premier of Pakistan at Karachi
in his speech before his Parliament levelled an attack against
the Hindu Mahasabha and attributed the East Bengal trage-
dies to its propaganda and to a Calcutta speech of Sardar
Patel in February 1950. And as if to create a calm and quiet
atmosphere for his delicate negotiations with the Pakistani
Premier, Savarkar who was out of active politics and who
had placed his services at the disposal of the Bharatiya Re-
public, was arrested at Bombay in the early morning of April
4, 1950, under the Preventive Detention Act, hundreds of
miles away from Delhi where the delicate negotiations were
being spun and was put into the Belgaum District Jail. Sri L.
B. Bhopatkar, Sri G. V. Ketkar, Sri Mamarao Date, Sri K. B.
Limaye, Sri G. M. Nalavade, and others were also thrown into
prison. This action on the part of the Govermnent was re-
sented and condemned by almost the entire press, political
leaders, and freedom-loving organizations like the Civil
Liberties Union of Bombay. Condemning this action, the
Free Press Journal, which had never shown even an iota of
sympathy with the Hindu Mahasabha, observed : “ The

offensive against the Hindu Mahasabha and the R.S.S. leaders
and workers has only one implication. That is, that, Premier
Nehru has elected to appease Pakistan and imperil the integ-
rity and the independence of India. The offensive against the
Hindu Mahasabha and the R.S.S. has a two-fold purpose ; one
is to divert India’s attention from the policy of appeasement ;
the other is to create a panic that there is a Hindu conspiracy
to rally the progressive elements in support of the policy of
appeasement of Pakistan.” ^ And all this took place in a
democratic India where the fundamental rights of the freedom
of speech and of association are guaranteed by the Constitu-
tion itself ! How long is Free India going to be deprived of
Savarkar’s nation-building co-operation and powers ?
