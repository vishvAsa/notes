## Intro
- Many a ruler aspired to act and be treated like a kShatriya, whether or not he could reliably trace his lineage to an ancient kShatriya line descending from the sun, moon or fire.
  - Examples of acquisition of kShatriya-status : see social fluidity section.
- As a parable, consider this story from the animal kingdom: [MT](https://agnimaan.wordpress.com/2015/06/02/the-parable-of-the-kshatriya-s/).

## Acquisition of kShatriya status
- See the 'changing varNa-s' bullet in the [varNa change theory page](AgamaH/varna-theory/varNa-change).

### Popular routes
