      <description>&lt;p&gt;THE chief scenes in the War of 1857 being in Northern India, we had so long to dilate upon the warlike events in that region alone. But, in order to grasp even the general tenor of the War, it is necessary to see its manifestations in other provinces also. Therefore, while the tongues of fire of that tremendous conflagration are dancing up to the skies there, we must also case a passing glance at the sparks in other regions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;ON the 20th of June, 1858, in the fierce fight on the maidan at Gwalior, Ranee Lakshmi Bai of Jhansi fell. But though one inveterate enemy of the English was thus taken away from the scene, the other, equally inveterate and, perhaps, more skilful in the tactics of war, had effected a clever retreat. He disappeared from Gwalior on the 20th, he disappeared, also, from the field of Jaura Alipur on the 22nd, and away he went out to the reach of the English – but where? In a few days, all over central India, forests, cities, caves, villages, mountains, and rivers, reverberated with a terrible war-cry, and jubiliant shouts of “Tatia Tope, Tatia Tope!”&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;NOW that the volcano has temporarily subsided, renders might, however, ask what became of Feroze Shah and Rao Sahib?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;After leaving Tatia, Rao Sahib fought desperately for a month and at last retired to the forests in disguise. At the end of about three years, he was also caught and was handed at Cawnpore on the 20th of August, 1862. Feroze Shah was also roaming about in disguise, but, fortunately, in the end, he got out of India and stayed at Kerbela in Persia.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
