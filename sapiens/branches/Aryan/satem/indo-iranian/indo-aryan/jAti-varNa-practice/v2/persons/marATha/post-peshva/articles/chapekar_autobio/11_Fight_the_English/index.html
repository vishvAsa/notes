  <h2 id="our-hatred-of-the-english">OUR HATRED OF THE ENGLISH</h2>
<p>In the meanwhile we again tried to get ourselves enlisted in a regiment, but failed. This was
the last disappointment suffered by us and we strongly reviled the English as follows : &quot; A system of
administration so cruel as that of the English cannot, if search be made, be found, in any region of
this globe. Far better were the tyrannical Yavan kings, who, with sword in hand, actually cut the
throats of men as if they were so many goats. But the English are perfidious and I positively declare
that no other people can be found on this earth who are as villainous as they and who like them ruin
others by a show of kindness. As god has given men different features, so He has endowed them
with different temperaments. Men&rsquo;s desires necessarily vary according to their temperaments. The
three principles of sattva (goodness or excellence), raja (passion of foulness) and tama (darkness or
ignorance) exist in a greater or less proportion in all men and are the cause of the difference
between their respective bent of mind as manifested in their conduct. If a sovereign were to act in
opposition to human disposition or inclinations implanted by God, would not that be tantamount to
ordering an innocent man, on the strength of authority, to do a particular act against his will or, in
other words, to sentencing him to rigorous imprisonment ? If he be found to entertain any immoral
desire it would be right to check him. But our request though legal, was refused. Who will call him
king who exercises such arbitrary powers ? Hitherto there have been many cruel Yavan kings in
India, but they made no rules for excluding Hindus from particular appointments or for limiting the
number of those open to them. It is a fact well-known in history that our people have even
discharged the duties of a premier requiring tact and trust worthiness. It is also possible even now to
point out the descendants of persons who served in the army and obtained jahgirs by performing
deeds of valour.&quot;</p>
<p>These thoughts created in our minds a violent prejudice against the English and
we resolved to persecute them in future. We knew only one or two on our side, while those against
whom
we were only to commence hostilities were far more powerful than ourselves. The difference
between them and our selves was as great as that between the sky and the regions under the earth.
Many people will ask why we formed such an absurd design as the above in the face of the rule, &quot; In
marriage, enmity and love the parties must be each other&rsquo;s equals.&quot; But, friends I interpret the
above (rule of the) Shastra in a manner very different from yours. The meaning of the rule &quot; We
should form (an alliance by) marriage with one who is our equal&quot; is as follows : We should form it
with one who like us is highborn of a generous heart and possessed of innate good qualities,
irrespectively of his outward riches. Accordingly, I have seen several great men give their daughters
in marriage to poor but (otherwise) eligible persons and also make over their riches to them. So
also, love and enmity depend on greatness of mind. What does it matter if a man be not fortunate
enough to have riches ? He whose mind is great (Under any circumstances). Though he may have
no riches, that does not in the least detract from his greatness of mind. The wise must not forget
this. Though we are destitute of wealth, we feel proud to say that our family is noble. Our parents
are high-born, possessed of greatness of mind, generous and virtuous and we owe our origin to
them.</p>
<p>Friends, there being at present a lack of discerning men capable of properly appreciating the
merits of our parents and ourselves, and my end having approached, I am compelled to indulge in
sell-glorification, for which I beg my Aryan brethren to excuse me. (In forming an estimate of our
merits) my friends must not confine their attention only to the fact that our father used to perform
kirtans and we used to beat tall behind him. If they make careful inquiries about the innate
disposition and outward conduct of our parents and ourselves, they will come to know the truth. In
short, though we have neither an army, nor territory, nor money, we still possess greatness of mind
and are therefore competent to pit ourselves against any being except God.+++(5)+++ Success or failure
depends upon chance and has no connection whatever with greatness.</p>
<h2 id="we-determine-to-fight-the-english">WE DETERMINE TO FIGHT THE ENGLISH</h2>
<p>Taking this view, we girded up our loins to enter upon a struggle with the English. We began
to consider to what undertaking we should first put our hand. It must be a very grave one and of
such a nature that our success in accomplishing it might be the talk of all, rejoice our Aryan
brethern, fill the English with sorrow, and put upon us the indelible brand of treason. While
pondering over this, we were inspired with the following idea : There is a statue of the Queen of
England situated at a certain crossing off our roads in the Fort in Bombay. This place is an important
one. This woman, after the Mutiny of 1857, acquired the universal sovereignty of India by making
fair but deceitful promises. She alone is the real enemy of our people. Other white men are our
enemies only in so far as they are her subjects. We should, therefore, begin at this place. Other acts
(should be done) afterwards.</p>
<p>Had she been in India we would have tried to wreck vengeance upon
herself even at the risk of losing our lives. We would not have cared for other less eminent people. It
is, however, to be deeply regretted that owing to our misfortune she is not here and it is not likely
that she will ever come to this country. We, therefore, resolved to make an auspicious beginning by
first dealing with her stone image, and proceeded to make the necessary arrangements.</p>
<h2 id="we-smeared-damar-to-the-queens-statue">WE SMEARED DAMAR TO THE QUEEN&rsquo;S STATUE</h2>
<p>We at first carefully examined the spot and thought over all the conveniences and
inconveniences, and considered in what way we should deal with the statue. Our first thought was
to break its head into small pieces by
means of a large hammer with a long handle. But on mature consideration we thought it difficult to
do this in a short time and therefore resolved only to disfigure it. Considering that &quot; He who does not
act up to his professions gets his face blackened &quot; we resolved to inflict the same punishment on
her. Proceeding to make arrangements for the execution of our design, we decided to put round the
neck of the statue a string of precious gems in the form of shoes as a token of our devotion. But
whence were the gems to be brought ? We wanted small ones and began to look for them.
Moreover, it was necessary that the shoes should be old. The older they were, the better would they
suit our purpose. How were these conditions to be fulfilled ? As these could not be purchased with
money in the market, we searched many rubbish-heaps, but could not obtain any such gems there.
But as our devotion is genuine, God help us. While in Bombay, I used to go to a large house in
Kandewadi belonging to a gentleman by name Wagle, for the purpose of bathing, performing
sandhya and making prostrations (to the sun). While searching there for these gems I found them in
a basket lying in disorder under a staircase among other things. I stole them with great dexterity and
formed them into a necklace, in the middle of which we attached tassels of a very filthy substance. I
cannot mention that substance here. The shoes forming the necklace were of three or four sorts.</p>
<p>Having finished the necklace, we intended to execute our design on the (auspicious) day of Dasara
because on that day our ancestors used to set out for the purpose of overpowering their enemies. In
accordance with this our ancient custom we decided to make a beginning (on the said day). On
consulting astrological works we found two very auspicious periods, one occurring at dawn on the
Dasara day and the other at 2 p.m. on the second day after Dasara. As our object was to carry out
our design in the manner enjoined by the Shastras, we resolved to execute it on the day fixed (as
above). We bought six annas worth of dammar. It was very liquid. In order to make it into a very
hard plaster we mixed with it some gram-flour and the filthy substance above referred to. Having
thus prepared the mixture we kept it in a long tube of zinc and awaited the arrival of the appointed
auspicious hour. On the approach of the Dasara day we devoutly prayed to God to give us success
in our undertaking and resolved to get up at the earliest dawn. But as we awoke from sleep at a late
hour on that day, our whole plan failed. We, therefore, resolved not to fail (to execute our design) at
the second auspicious hour. That night we kept awake praying to God all the time. Soon after 8
O&rsquo;clock at night, we took the tube containing dammer and the necklace of shoes to a certain spot
marked by us. Just before 2 O&rsquo;clock we remembered Gajanan and started from our residence. At
that time there was bright moon-light. The Police were standing motionless at various places on the
road. I carried in my hand a stick long enough to reach my ears and was walking at a distance (from
my brother). My brother carried an iron pipe in his hand. We were walking at a distance from each
other. Instead of going by the metalled road, we passed through the open space adjoining the
Marine Battalion (Lines), and after reaching the back part of the Police station near the Queen&rsquo;s
statue went a little further. We stopped for a while at a certain spot, and my brother went near the
statue and came back. We then decided that one of us should worship the statue and the other
should defend him (if necessary). Though any obstacle were to arise the worshipper was to finish
his task quietly, while the guard was to silently remove the obstacle by the use of the last expedient,
viz., violence.</p>
<p>Accordingly, I undertook to act as a guard, while my brother undertook the worship
and both of us started. My brother crossed the railing on the right of the statue and entered the
compound, while, fully equipped, stood on the (left) side of the statue towards the Police station. At
that time the light in the lantern at the Police station was dimly burning. One or two peons were
indistinctly observed in the dark to be smoking cigarettes. From the spot
where I stood I could distinctly see the statue as well as perceive any movement on the part of the
men in the Police station. A little while before my brother climbed the statue a man went by the road
which passses the Police station. In our opinion this man was a Police Havaldar or Jamadar. I
thought that the man might happen to see what we were doing and that I might have to discharge
my duty. But nothing of the sort took place and the man went on without stopping. In the meantime
my brother had finished the worship (of the statue). When the necklace was thrown round the neck
(of the statue) it struck its chest and made a sound which, however, failed to draw the attention of
the (Police) sepoy. My brother got out of the compound by leaping over the railing and then I too
joined him on the road. By way of precaution we had previously seen some other roads by which we
might return home in case of necessity. But no such necessity having arisen, we returned home by
the high road.</p>
<p>On our return home, we as usual, praised God by reciting hymns and then retired.
When next morning we went to see the statue, we saw many Hindus, Parsis, Muham-madans and
Europeans assembled there. All except the Europeans appeared to be delighted. The Police also
had gathered there. They removed the necklace from the statue and kept it at the Police station and
tried to remove the dammar by a powerful jet of water. Just then a prohibitory order was received
from the Police authorities for stopping the use of all remedies for the present. Seeing this we
returned home. At about 12 O&rsquo;clock the news spread over the town, while at night it became the
subject of general talk. All began to admire the daring of the author of the deed. Many columns of
newspapers edited by Europeans were devoted to this topic. The (editors of) Marathi papers were
inwardly delighted, but outwardly they said that the bad character (who had perpetrated the deed)
ought to be arrested and punished. Speculation was rife. Some said that the deed was done not by
any Hindu or Muhammadan, but by a European. Others said that a Muham-madan had done it.
Every one said that such a daring deed could not have been done by a Hindu.+++(5)+++ We were highly
offended to hear such disagreeable words uttered by any one. With a view to make it generally
known that a Hindu had done the deed, we had already written a letter and placed it on the statue.
We were hitherto in doubt as to whether the Police had got it or not. I now learn that they did not get
it. It, therefore, seems that it was blown away by the wind. The Times (of India) gave a full
description of the occurrence, with the exception of the tassels attached to the necklace and the
letter. We, therefore, thought of writing a letter to that paper. As, however, we do not know English,
we had recourse to the following artifice : As the tenor of our letter made it desirable that it should
be posted at Thana, we addressed the following anonymous letter written in Marathi to the editor of
the Suryodaya, a newspaper published in that town :—</p>
<h3 id="the-dandapani">THE DANDAPANI</h3>
<p>&quot; We have formed an association called Dandapani. Our fixed determination is to die
and kill (others) for the sake of our religion. The association was formed on the recent
auspicious day of Dasara. Its first achievement was the blackening of the face of (the statue
of) the Queen of England who made a distinction between Natives and Europeans. Having
done this the association informs the public as follows : This Dandapani Association will not
be overawed by any one. Any one who encourages immorality, whether the Queen or some
one superior to her, is the enemy of this association. This detailed statement will certainly
enable all to comprehend its object. It is for all our Aryan brethren to aid it directly or indirectly.
We, therefore, request you to take the trouble of forwarding an English version of this letter to
the Times (of India). You will thereby earn credit for having assisted the said association,</p>
<p>The purport of the letter was only that. That letter is with my friend Mr. Brewin, and I am of the
opinion that it should be published. We sent the above letter to the editor of the Suryodaya. But as it
was not published in the Times (of India) we concluded that the editor (of the Suryodaya) had not
forwarded it to the Times (of India). I, however, now learn that he had forwarded it. In this manner
our first undertaking, viz., this affair of the Queen&rsquo;s statue, was successfully accomplished. The
people, however, continue to talk about the matter more or less till recently. In the course of that
talk, they gave utterance to some very amusing things, not even a hundredth part of which I can
mention here for fear of prolixity.</p>
<h2 id="outbreak-of-plague">OUTBREAK OF PLAGUE</h2>
<p>At that time the bubonic plague was on the increase. All began to complain loudly of the
increasing oppression on the part of the Government. People began to leave Bombay for the
districts through fear (of the plague), while those in the mofussil ceased to go to Bombay owing to
the same cause.</p>
<h2 id="we-set-the-mandap-on-fire">WE SET THE MANDAP ON FIRE</h2>
<p>In the meantime the date of the Matriculation Examination was drawing near. As usual a fine
mandap was put up near Colaba for the said examination. As the plague was increasing every
moment, people from all parts (of the Presidency) petitioned the authorities concerned for a
postponement of the examination. The people of Poona made strenuous efforts in the matter. As,
however, the authorities were inexorable, we resolved to take up the matter into our hands, being
satisfied that we might settle it in a manner that would procure us popular applause. Besides, we
are dead against (higher) education, which has a bad effect on the boys. We are of opinion that the
loss of our physical strength is partly to be laid at the door of this Mlenchha learning.</p>
<p>The entire
society has devoted itself to education and become too much thoughtful, and thereby has lost
manliness. At present (such is our condition that) if any one were to kick and cuff us soundly, we
shall only weary ourselves by holding meetings, making petitions and discussing the matter. Though
we have already lost so much by education, our educated men complain that Government does not
give us higher education. A vicious but poor man, in order to gratify his evil inclination, at first
spends his own money to seduce some rich man&rsquo;s son into an evil habit, but when the latter has
become a slave to the habit, withholds his own money and leads a life of pleasure and ease (at his
expense and) in his company so long as he has any money with him.</p>
<p>In like manner when the
English assumed the administration of India, they thought it necessary to extinguish the spirit of the
Hindus by making them addicted to the vice of education. They, therefore, spent their own money at
first.+++(4)+++ Seeing that the people have become pretty well addicted to it, they are now withholding their
own money. The more they do so, the more our people think that they are unwilling to give us
education, because it is the only means of securing our good. They, therefore, devote themselves to
education with still greater enthusiasm.</p>
<p>But my brethren, you commit a mistake in thinking so. They
will not lose, but gain by giving you education. They wish to close the schools and colleges, not for
stopping education, but for reducing expenditure. They know that if they were to sever all
connection with education, the people being enthusiatically &ldquo;attached to it will pay constant visits to
them at their bungalows and invite them to pan-supari in order to obtain permission to open schools
and colleges at their own expenses. This is actually the case at present.</p>
<p>If they are (really) unwilling
to educate people, why are they so anxious to educate
women ? They always endeavour to educate the lower orders because they wish to make those
castes addicted to it which are now free from it and then to enjoy the fun. The Marathas, &amp;c, have
lately begun to complain as follows : — &quot; We do not receive education. Only the Brahmins become
educated. Even in former times they, with like selfishness, educated themselves, but kept us in
ignorance. We, therefore, pray that the paternal Government will be graciously pleased to give us
education.&rdquo; They repeatedly make such petitions (to Government). But they fail to understand that it
was by receiving education that the Brahmins destroyed their religious observances, caste, families,
morality and immorality, manliness and impotence. If in spite of the above results of that baleful
education the Marathas, &amp;c, wish to acquire it, let them do so by all means and become effeminate.</p>
<p>Many people, on reading these our opinions which are quite opposed to education, will call us fools.
Poor things, let them do so. In a village inhabited by naked persons, a person wearing a dhotar is
sure to be called a downright fool. But he alone will be called wise by discerning persons. I can write
much on this topic, but refrain from doing so with a view to avoid prolixity.</p>
<p>To be brief, as the
University was acting in opposition to (the wishes of) the people and was not also liked by us, we
thought of inflicting some damage on that body and accordingly began to make inquiries about the
mandap referred to above. We saw the mandap which was being put up near Colaba. Our intention
was to set fire to it only one day before the date of the examination, because in that case no new
mandap could be put up before the time of the examination, which, therefore, would be necessarily
postponed. But afterwards it occurred to us that if we did not find any opportunity on the previous
day, the examination would begin on the next day. We, therefore, thought that there was no
objection to setting fire to it one or two days before (the examination day). On examining the
mandap, we considered on what side it would be convenient to set it on fire, and proceeded to make
the necessary arrangements. Knowing that it would be difficult to go a long way in the latter part of
the night we resolved to do the business before 9 o&rsquo;clock. The mandap was to be set on fire on the
side towards the railway compound. The materials and the method employed were similar to those
employed in setting fire to the upper story of the building belonging to Messrs. Phillips &amp; Co.,
Bhudwar Peth, Poona, which had been occupied by a certain missionary. After setting fire to the
mandap we got out of the compound by leaping (over the fence), walked along the seashore as far
as the Churney Road Station and thence got home. After we had walked over a considerable
distance, we could see the glare of the fire. By the time we got home, the fire (had attained such
dimensions that it) could be easily seen from our chawl. But the people (in our chawl) did not know
that the mandap was on fire. All of them had assembled in the upper gallery to see the fire and
wondered where it had occurred. We also stood among them. They were in doubt (as to the origin
of the fire). Though we had no doubt whatever (on that point), we did not disclose the true facts to
them, but looked on with them in (feigned) astonishment.</p>
<p>The next day the people knew for certain
that the mandap had been burnt down. The educated people in particular were much delighted to
hear this. The police shifted their own responsibility by giving out that the fire had been caused by a
spark from the engine of a railway train. There was, however, a very general rumour among the
people that the fire had been caused by some Poonaite. A similar suspicion of the Poonaites had
been expressed in papers edited by Englishmen, in connection with, the blackening of the face of
the Queen&rsquo;s statute, though it cannot be known on what grounds they thought so. As, however, we
are very proud of Poona, once the capital of the Peshwas, we were delighted to hear the above
reports. The mandap being thus consumed by fire like an offering, the authorities were compelled to
postpone the examination, in consequence of which the people highly praised
the authors of the said deed. We were greatly delighted, to hear ourselves thus praised.</p>
<p>A few days
after this we returned to Poona with our family. On our return we began to look out for some serious
enterprise, but could not soon find any. As, however, we had made it our vocation to persecute the
irreligious and glorify the religious, we could not feel easy at heart unless we did something towards
the accomplishment of our object. We were always absorbed in thinking what we should do and
how we should do it. The good or evil acts of the irreligious did not remain hidden from our keen
observation.</p>
<p>Our wrath was specially directed against the Sudharak and Dnyan Chakshu
newspapers. We had obtained full information about the editors and proprietors of both these
newspapers. My readers must be aware of the fact that one of the editors of the Sudharak was
some time ago first lightly punished and then even a letter of warning was sent to him; but I am very
sorry to observe that he heeded our warning only in the first issue of the paper published after it was
given, but thereafter he reverted to his old practices and thus treated us with contempt. As we could
not put up with this, we resolved to cut off the head of this Devdhar (the said editor) and thus show
to the world what severe punishment is deserved by persons for the great sin (committed by them)
of vilifying their own religion. But on mature consideration it was resolved to kill an offending
European in the first place and then, after warning these brutes in human form to the effect that
those on whom they rely so much were dealt with by us in this manner, to ask them once more to
beware. Having resolved that, if even after such warning these men should fail to mend their ways,
they were to be mercilessly killed without delay. After this we ceased to give any further thought to
these educated blockheads.</p>
<h2 id="we-punish-thorat">WE PUNISH THORAT</h2>
<p>In the meantime, our dear friend, Bhuskute, reported (to us) that Mr. Thorat, a teacher in
Bhave&rsquo;s School, was a very bad man, being addicted to the vice of sodomy. This educated teacher
was in the habit of showing favour and giving higher rank to those boys only who were handsome
and young. We had already known Mr. Thorat to be a man of such character. We used to keep a
register of all ill-behaved men.+++(5)+++ There are in our register (the names of) many men who are very vile
and whose conduct is disgusting. All of them were to suffer at our hands one after another, but the
Almighty does not seem inclined to get this service done by us. God&rsquo;s will prevails.</p>
<p>The educated
are invariably addicted to vice. This may probably be the effect of a liberal education. Let us
proceed. We had many a time sent anonymous letters to Mr. Bhave of the Bhave School
representing that the conduct of Thorat was such that it was not advisable to retain him in the school
as the boys might contract evil habits, and that it would be to his (Bhave&rsquo;s) interest to dismiss him
from the school; but no satisfactory arrangements were made. Later on, when we came to know of
many of his other vices, viz., eating flesh, drinking wine, vilifying the gods and the (Hindu) religion,
&amp;c, Bhuskute was strongly of opinion that he should receive chastisement at our hands. It was
resolved to get this done by Bhuskute in order to inspire him with courage, and we made careful
inspection of the place where he resided. He used to live on the first floor of Mantri&rsquo;s Wada in a
room overlooking the street. When my brother and Bhuskute entered the room through a small
window over looking the road, they perceived that he was awake. He was sleeping in a cloth-
partitioned room. When, on hearing footsteps, he repeatedly asked in a low voice &quot; Who is there ?
Who is there ? &quot; my brother told (Bhuskute) to strike him and he struck him one blow ; but the blow
was feeble as Bhuskute was in a state of nervous excitement and he (Thorat) raised an alarm.
Thereupon,
my brother gave him a heavier blow and both then swiftly jumped out of the window and escaped.
The two pieces of iron piping (carried by them) in their hands remained on the floor while jumping
down, and were taken charge of by the Police. The next day this circumstance was much talked of
in the town, but our object was not accomplished. The people said that some thieves had come, but
not being able to steal anything went away. As he was, however, not a well-known man, no one said
anything about his vices. We did not derive any great satisfaction from this affair as our pride for
(our) religion did not come to light.</p>
<p>After this, with the intention of doing something, we one night
took off the sign-board at the office of the Sudharak and placed it on Khasgiwale&rsquo;s privy which faced
the high road, and having filled an earthen jar with the ordure in that privy suspended it from the
door chain of the office of the Sudharak, and wrote on that jar the words &quot; Remove our excrements.&quot;
Having done this during the night, we went in the morning to the spot (Sudharak&rsquo;s office) to see the
fun ; but as this state of things did not last for a long time, the people could not enjoy the fun to their
hearts content. The matter, however, was to some extent talked about in the city.</p>
<h2 id="we-broke-an-european-show">WE BROKE AN EUROPEAN SHOW</h2>
<p>Some days after this incident a Europeon brought down some kind of show to the new
Market. Its big apparatus had already arrived there two days before. On seeing the apparatus we
could not make out what wonderful show it was. But all our doubts were removed when he (the
European) set up the show by arranging its several parts. It is necessary to place before the reader
a description of this show.</p>
<p>Friends, this show was not so very wonderful. It is, however, the
ignorance of our people which is unparalleled. In this India of ours, I have seen this show set up by
the poor people at their fairs and gatherings. A big pillar is set up on the ground and on the top of it
a canopy, to which (wooden) horses and camels are attached, is made to turn round. On payment
of one pice, a ride on these (wooden animals) is allowed. Generally, boys and country-people take a
ride on these wooden horses, but gentlemen never do so. In short, a show similar to that which we
consider to be so very vulgar was brought into the Market, the only difference being that it was of an
improved type. It consisted of two divisions ; the upper division was in a manner decorated and
couches were placed therein at intervals. The canopy was over decorated with tinsel. Some sort of
music was played while the canopy turned round. At night it glittered with lamps. The proprietor of
the show had fixed two rates of admission, namely, two annas for (a seat on) the lower division and
four annas for (a seat on) the upper one. While whirling round, this show afforded the same
pleasure as is derived from our country merry-go-rounds. But as it was brought there by a
European, our wiseacres flocked to see it like ghosts.+++(4)+++ The show for which our poor people charge
only one pice a head and thus earn their livelihood, is not patronized by our people professing
themselves to be refined. But as soon as they see that a European (has brought one), they forgetful
of their position, over and over again visit it like boys, paying four annas a head each time. I,
therefore, am at a loss to know how to characterise these wiseacres.</p>
<p>Many reformers used to visit
the show with their wives. This class or reformers had stigmatised us by being born amongst us.
These fools have no idea of patriotism. We two brothers shall never admire, or derive any pleasure
from, any invention of the English, though it might show the highest inventive skill. Though many
admirable amusements like the phonograph have hitherto been introduced into India, our
patriotism has never permitted us to see them even though people persuaded us to do so and were
prepared to pay for us. If we have at all seen any,
we have never in consequence of our patriotic feeling been inspired with admiration for them. We
have not starved for not having seen the extraordinary novelties introduced by foreigners, nor do the
unpatriotic reformers seem to have grown fat for having seen them. It is the foreigners who fill their
own coffers by plundering us and then bid good-bye to the country. We used to feel greatly
exasperated at these things, but what could we do ? How were we to expostulate with these idiots
(though they call themselves learned, I reckon them among perfect idiots) ? Thinking that the best
course would be to get rid of that apparently seductive show, we resolved to set fire to it.</p>
<p>We
accordingly procured phosphorus, and having made it into tablets, stuck pins into them to be handy
for use. We then arranged that Bhuskute and my brother, Bapurao, should go info the upper division
(of the show) and make use of (some of) them (to set fire to it), while I should use others in (setting
fire to) the private tent (of the proprietor) that was pitched on the ground, so that both the (merry-go
round and the) tent should be ablaze simultaneously. Accordingly, my brother went into the upper
division of the show, and when he was about to come down, I on my part, set fire below, and
immediately the tent on the ground was ablaze.</p>
<p>Thereupon, all the spectators came down to
extinguish the fire. We were waiting to see the show also in a similar condition, but through some
inexplicable cause it did not catch fire. The fire-engine having come to the spot put down the fire.
The proprietor of the show suffered a good deal of loss. The next day the Police came there to keep
order, but we having showered stones upon them they could not do anything. On the third day, a
larger number of Police came to the assistance (of the showman). In spite of them, however, we
again attacked the show and some of the lamps and (wooden) horses and camels having been
broken on the occasion, the showman was subjected to considerable loss. At last that European got
disgusted and removed his show to a place near the (railway) station. We then let him alone. We did
not derive any great pleasure from this performance, but only felt that we had not wasted our hours
of leisure.</p>
<h2 id="plague-in-poona">PLAGUE IN POONA</h2>
<p>In the meanwhile rumours about the increase of the bubonic plague in the city began to
spread, and people began to say that Government intended to make effective arrangements
regarding it. They also said that the arrangements (here) would be similar to those in Bombay. But
as we were not in the least satisfied with the preventive measures adopted in Bombay, we
determined to make an attempt to oppose the measures if the oppression practised in Bombay were
repeated here.</p>
<h2 id="we-set-our-eye-on-rand">WE SET OUR EYE ON RAND</h2>
<p>While we were thus considering the matter, that very system was gradually put into operation,
and after a few days we heard that one Mr. Rand was appointed to give effect to it. On inquiry we
learnt that he was the same Mr. Rand who had sentenced (some) respectable gentlemen of Wai to
imprisonment. We, therefore, resolved not to trouble the other officers of the (Plague) Committee,
least they might get alarmed, but to punish the principal officer alone.</p>
<p>We then made careful
inquiries (to find out) whether Mr. Rand was a good or a bad man.+++(4)+++ It was rumoured, in the city that
he was wicked man. His notorious (in) justice at Wai was the index of his perversity. We had,
however, a great desire to witness personally his iniquitous practices in our own city. As soon as we
heard of Mr. Rand&rsquo;s appointment, we three, viz., we two brothers and Bhuskute, began to look for
him. But he could not be seen anywhere. Some said he had not yet arrived, while others said he
had. Such
were the conflicting rumours that flew about in the city. Every day we went into the Cantonment, but
his bungalow could not be found. Many a time did we go to (office of the Plague) Committee. There
we saw Beveridge of Hongkong, Colonel Philips, Dr. Jones and other Europeans. We had mistaken
Colonel Philips for Mr. Rand, but one day that illusion was dispelled unmistakably.</p>
<p>How to learn his
identity was then our sole anxiety. We could not openly question anybody on the point for fear of
exciting suspicion. Thus we spent several days in simply trying to have a look at Mr. Rand. But he
had not arrived till then. The rumours that he had come and taken over charge of his duties were
groundless. We think that he took charge of his duties long after (this time). We had a full view of
this individual on the day the inspection commenced ; but still we took care to ascertain his identity
from many persons. We then saw his carriage, and, on inquiry of the coachman through Bhuskute
as to where Mr. Rand had put up, we learnt that he was staying at the Club. We then paid frequent
visits to the Club premises, but could get no inkling of his where abouts. We all three then ceased to
visit the Cantonment and took to visiting the Municipal (office) where we could see him in the
mornings as well as in the evenings.</p>
<p>Ever since the commencement of the house-to-house
visitation, he used to come to Bhudhwar (Peth) every morning and thence proceed to the places
where the inspection was to take place. Many people used to collect together in Budhwar (Peth) in
order to see him when he came there. On the first day, the work of inspection began in Budhwar
and the sight was an unprecedented one. The people being unused to such inspections were off
their guard.</p>
<h2 id="the-atrocities-of-the-plague-officers">THE ATROCITIES OF THE PLAGUE OFFICERS</h2>
<p>Had they known that this inspection meant only spoliation ; that the white men carrying on
that work were marauders with Colonel Phillips, Lewis and other white men as their ringleaders ;
that Mr. Rand was the chief in command over them ; that it was merely for the sake of carrying on
this premediatated and extensive loot that one Dr. Jones was appointed before hand ; that as a
preliminary step these English marauders had caused him to make large openings in the houses of
the rich as well as of the poor with the only object of rendering visible, while on their raid in broad
daylight, the treasury boxes and other articles placed in the dark +++(4)+++; that like the Ramoshi dacoits of
our own country, who first make careful inquiries (about the belongings of their victims) to enable
them to commit dacoities during night, Dr. Jones had, at the outset, by means of a general inquiry
prepared a list of the rich as well as the poor people of the city and had handed it over to those
marauders at the commencement (of the operations) ; and that those marauders taking advantage
of the mildness of the Hindus, were about to commence their pillage under the guise of law ; (in
short), if the rayats had known before hand that their paternal Government was about to cut the
throats of their own subjects in the above manner, they would have, to save themselves, migrated to
some other place with all their belongings. But as they failed to perceive this state of things before
hand they remained in their homes (confident of their) security.</p>
<p>Meanwhile a band of these
marauders paid their first visit to Budhwar (peth). Immediately on their arrival, they stationed guards
at the corner of the street and began to break open shops by picking the locks. Oh ! what a
spectacle it was. Indeed, neither history nor tradition can show such treatment accorded to a subject
people by their rulers. One can understand an army raised to meet an enemy being used in
repelling an invading foe ; but here we see our valiant Englishmen (utilising) their brave and well
equipped forces in swooping down upon moribund victims of the plague and packing them off to
hospitals. How very brave of them. Would (any other) ruler on the face of the globe use his forces in
such a fashion ? Our English (rulers), however, appear to think that valour consists not in striking
down a man in full possession of his powers, which any one can, do, but in capturing those who are
stricken with illness and are unable to move an inch. It is for this reason that they employed their
well-drilled soldiers on such operations. In this way did these plunderers commence their
depredations. We always followed (the parties which carried on) this plunder, with the object of
seeing with our own eyes their high-handed proceedings. I prefer to call these operations a loot
rather than inspection.</p>
<p>While this loot was going on, high officers of Government with Mr. Rand at
their head paraded in the streets and supervised the breaking of locks, the making away with
furniture and (other) lawless proceedings and also saw that all these operations were duly carried
on. They were at this time (so much) blinded (with authority) that they cared not for any Hindu
gentleman (however high his position might be). Nothing but burning, demolition, wreckage and
arrests were to be seen in those parts which this band of raiders visited. I do not think that those
who have seen such slights would characterise these vilest men otherwise than as marauders.</p>
<p>Rules were framed for regulating the manner in which this pillage was to be carried on. The rules
which were reduced to writing were in themselves mild in a large measure, but the manner in which
they were carried out appeared to be quite the reverse. It was expressly laid down in the rules that
no one should so act as to wound the religious susceptibilities of any one. But these white men
purposely acted in such a way as to exasperate us, and Mr. Rand witnessed this spectacle with
great satisfaction.</p>
<h2 id="we-resolve-to-kill-rand">WE RESOLVE TO KILL RAND</h2>
<p>I am unable to describe how exasperated we felt on such occasions. We resolved to take his
(Mr. Rand&rsquo;s) life at all risks. Having formed this resolve we set to work. We possessed swords only.
We had two pistols but had no gunpowder and hence they were useless. A pistol was, of course,
the most convenient weapon for a swift action, but what was to be done ? Whence was the
ammunition to be procured ? We, therefore, resolved to perpetrate the deed with swords alone. We
selected two of the best we possessed and attached to them straps of tape to sling them from our
shoulders. The sheaths which were of black (leather) were wrapped in pieces of white turban and
thus made to appear white. Having made these preparations, we began to look out for a suitable
spot (to execute our design), but did not succeed in fixing upon any. We, therefore, determined to
perpetrate the deed near the (Municipal) Committee&rsquo;s office, the only restriction being that it was to
be executed not earlier than 8 o&rsquo;clock in the evening. The idlers in the city had, however, put Mr.
Rand on his guard by sending intimidatory anonymous letters to him. This put us to a great deal of
trouble. He would not remain in the city after nightfall, and began to take with him an escort of
sowars on his way (to the Municipal office) and back.</p>
<p>We, however, did not allow ourselves to be
discouraged in the least. We resolved to kill both (Mr. Rand and the sowars). But we could not move
out with swords except at night-time, while he (Mr. Rand) would not allow nightfall to overtake him
(in the city). Several days elapsed in this manner. Oppression as well as the plague increased in
the city (and) it was wholly abandoned by its inhabitants. Our father received invitations from distant
places to go there as the plague was raging (in Poona) and he made preparations to go to a distant
place, and, therefore, began to put impediments in the way of his going. When, however, we saw
that he very much wished to leave Poona, we decided that it would be more convenient (for us) to
go to our house at Chinchwad than to any distant place. Chinchwad being (only) ten miles distant
from Poona, we thought that, in case we went to that place, we could come here any day and
execute our design. Accordingly,
we proposed to go to Chinchwad, and our father, having approved of the proposal, wrote about it to
our uncle at the place ; but the latter raised many objections (to our proposal) and wrote back to say
that it was not advisable for us to remove there. Thus did he manifest his brotherly feeling.</p>
<p>As we
could not secure any other place in the vicinity of Poona, we made a request to our vyahi, Mr.
Paranjpe, in the matter and obtained his permission to remove to his garden at Kirkee. We found
this place more convenient than Chinchwad and shifted there on an auspicious (day).
We took great care not to allow any one even to suspect that we three were bent upon the
perpetration of a terrible deed. While at Kirkee, we formed the acquaintance of one R. Jones, a
missionary, living in the Kirkee bazar. We asked for and obtained 25 to 30 percussion caps from
him, but gunpowder could not be obtained anywhere. Being, however, informed by Bhuskute that
we would be able to procure gunpowder at the house of Kachare, a mali in a garden at Kothrud, we
three proceeded thither one night as if for pleasure and made away with some gunpowder and small
shot.</p>
<p>(In the meanwhile) Mr. Rand had carried his oppression to the highest pitch. The people talked
about (the advisability of) taking his life and lamented that there was no religious enthusiast
amongst them who could do that work. The people of other places scoffed at the Poonaites, and the
newspapers wrote in derision about the city, calling it garrulous and nothing more. Every day saw
new modes of oppression. Temples were desecrated in one part of the city, in another women were
outraged and idols broken.+++(5)+++ The poor and the helpless were the greatest sufferers at the hands of
these marauders. While this state of things was going on, we every day came to Poona from Kirkee
and returned home in the evening. Our father did not like to see us go to and return from Poona in
the noon-day sun. He pointed out to us in various ways that the course we were following would be
deleterious to our health, but as we were bent upon the execution of our object we persisted in
paying stealthy visits to Poona. When our father came to know of this, he got angry with us and
moved back to Poona, and we too with all the members of our family followed suit. The bubonic
plague was raging in the city at this time, but we had the consolation that it would now be easy for
us to make an attempt to carry out our plan.</p>
<h2 id="bhuskute-falls-prey-to-the-plague">BHUSKUTE FALLS PREY TO THE PLAGUE</h2>
<p>In the meanwhile, our dear friend, Dattatraya Bhuskute, was seized with this deadly fever. On
the day he fell ill, he came and told us about it. He, however, said that as the fever was of an
ordinary type we need not entertain any fears on that score. After this he went home and we never
saw him again. As no member of his family knew that we were his friends, we could not call at his
house to inquire after his health. I, however, sent my youngest brother on this mission, but
everybody being apprehensive of these marauders, none would admit that Bhuskute was ill.</p>
<p>Great
God. Where (art) thou. To what depths of dependence have we Hindus sunk. As we could not hear
any news about Bhuskute&rsquo;s health, we resolved that he should, while yet on his sick-bed, hear that
the wretch (Mr. Rand) had been punished. With this object in view we strained every nerve for the
execution of our design, but instead of a favourable opportunity offering itself for the perpetration of
the deed the evil news that Bhuskute had departed this life fell on our ears. Our grief knew no
bounds when we received this news. It is easy to imagine how difficult it is to find a bosom friend
who will co-operate with one in such work as we had undertaken. Unfortunately for us, our friend
was not spared to us.</p>
<p>We went outside the city, and stretching out our hands towards heaven
uttered the following words with upturned faces : — &quot; Friend, you have strenuously exerted yourself
along with us in the interest of our
religion. May God grant you eternal happiness. That wretch will shortly be despatched to the world
of Pluto. You need not entertain any anxiety on that score. That is the only way by which we can
fulfil your desires.&quot; Having addressed these words to (the spirit of) Bhuskute, we retraced our way to
the town, meditating on the transitoriness of our material existence. The fate of our friend filled us
with utter despondence as regards this world, and thinking that God might one day snatch us away
in a similar manner we made up our mind that, come what might, we must execute our design even
in broad daylight if we could not find a suitable opportunity at night. So the death of our friend,
instead of disheartening us, spurred us on to set about our undertaking with greater vigour. As far
as possible we were resolved not to run any personal risk in our attempt, but if that was not found
possible, we were determined to carry out our plan even at the sacrifice of our lives. Whenever a
gang of the marauders visited our Peth, they found us fully prepared (to meet them). We were
determined fo make the European (soldiers) pay with their lives in case they misconducted
themselves in our house. At the same time we thought the killing of those worthless soldiers too
trivial an affair, and therefore with a view not to allow Mr. Rand to escape unscathed, one of us kept
an eye on the spot where he took his stand. Our object was that the moment the soldiers
misconducted themselves in our house I was to strike them down, while my brother was to deal
similarly with Mr. Rand. We were prepared every day to act in this manner. Fortunately, however,
the soldiers did not act against our wishes in our house.</p>
<p>Once it so happened that my brother was
rather indisposed at the time these marauders visited our house, but even on that occasion we took
care to be ready with our arms to impress upon the minds of the marauders that we at all events
were men of self-respect in the town. In our house we used to take these marauders only into my
brother&rsquo;s room and to the storey of our house occupied by our father, but did not allow the brutes to
trespass into the god-house, nor into the kitchen, nor into the women&rsquo;s apartments. Our she-buffalo,
which was tethered in the back yard of our house, used to fiercely rush at the European (soldiers)
whenever it saw them. They, therefore, being terrified at its fierce look, did not venture into that part
of the house. We are very proud of the fact that even our she-buffalo was such a fierce animal. As
we used to be in such a state of preparedness, God took care of us.</p>
<p>The Europeans acted in
accordance with our wishes in our house. One day, however, a European insisted upon entering our
house, but when we both of us told him in an indignant tone that it was impossible for him to do so,
he being inspired by God in some unknown manner quietly went away. Though I personally
witnessed outrages committed at other places, nothing calculated to provoke us occurred in our own
house and consequently we were calmly maturing our plans concerning Mr. Rand. Many a trivial
quarrel took place between the soldiers and ourselves on the road, but all this originated in our own
tricks.</p>
<h2 id="our-preparations-for-revenge">OUR PREPARATIONS FOR REVENGE</h2>
<p>The epidemic of fever and tyranny having increased in the above manner, now began to
abate by the will of God. After some days house-to-house visitation was discontinued, but the police
stations established at the cemeteries were retained. Each of these stations had two armed sentries
and we became fired with a desire to make away with their guns. With that object in view we
examined all the stations and found The one located on Lakdipul to be the most convenient one (for
our purposes). I then went there four or five times disguised as a pujari, and on one occasion having
made my prostrations to Balbhima, snatched away with his permission two Henri-Martinis and one
sword and took them to our house. This was a source of extreme delight to us both. I cannot
describe how joyful we felt. We now
felt confident enough to face even an army. Our ill-luck, however, did not show us that day, nor is
there any prospect of our ever seeing it hereafter. We had procured the guns but where were
cartridges to be found ? It was our intention to attempt to procure them later on. On the following
day the news of the theft of the guns spread in the city, and in very flattering terms did the people
speak of the discipline and bravery of the soldiers concerned. The people (however) were wonder-
struck at the (boldness of the) person who had stolen the guns. This circumstance delighted us the
most. But as there was no possibility of the guns being of any use to us in our undertaking in the
absence of cartridges, we stowed them away with great care.</p>
<p>Since the house-to-house visitation
system was discontinued, Mr. Rand was not very punctual in coming to and going from the city. He
came and went at any time he liked. Consequently, our intention of accomplishing our design in the
city fell through. Then we began visiting the Club in the Cantonment in order to find out his room.
Having found it out, we went to the Cantonment every evening and watched the movements of Mr.
Rand. Every Wednesday and Sunday he was in the habit of going to St. Mary&rsquo;s Church for evening
service. Five or seven times did we lie in wait for him at this place, but could not succeed in our
object. While there, we once happened to enter into conversation with a European constable. We
also went to the Club three or four times in different disguises. Then we visited the Gymkhana eight
or ten times, and in the course of our visits to that place we came into collision with a European
constable. It would be wearisome if I entered into full details about the various attempts made by us
as stated above. I would, therefore, content myself by giving here only a resume of what we did and
then conclude. The adage &quot; God helps those who help themselves&quot; is not untrue. We were
unremitting in our efforts, but the time of our departure for Bombay having approached, we were
filled with anxiety as to how God would enable us to commit the deed. We prayed to God repeatedly
to make us His instruments in committing the deed, and thus enable us to do some service to our
religion. Whenever we heard the utterances of the people about the oppression which they were
suffering, we imagined that they were laying their grievances before us just as people seek redress
from a king.+++(5)+++ We thought that we owed these people a debt which would remain undischarged if the
deed were not perpetrated, and then we would be ashamed to show our face to the public. We,
therefore, often prayed to Shri Gajanan to save us from such disgrace. As time passed on, the
Jubilee day approached. The newspapers began to be filled with descriptions of the manner in
which this grand festival was to be celebrated, and we believed that Europeans of all ranks would
go to the Government House at Ganesh Khind on that occasion. Thinking, therefore, that would be
a fitting time for us, both of us started to reconnoitre that part of the country and inspected all the
large and small roads in the vicinity thereof. After examining all the places, we resolved to cross the
Lakdi Bridge and the canal flowing past the yellow bungalow situated on this side of the spot where
the pandal of the National Congress was erected and then to debouch on the high road leading to
Ganesh Khind at a point where it passes the yellow bungalow and there execute our commendable
deed and then return. We had (also) fixed upon certain unoccupied bungalows in the
neighbourhood for the purpose of taking shelter therein in case it should rain at the time. While
crossing the canal in the course of our inspection of the places, we needlessly remonstrated with
certain European girls who were paddling in the water near the yellow bungalow and then
proceeded to do our homage to the goddess Chatursingi, the mother of the universe.</p>
<p>There we
prayed to her by reciting the following song :—</p>
<p>Pad.</p>
<p>On mother of the universe, we are about to perform a commendable deed; vouchsafe success to us.
Confer on us, Oh mother Bhavani, the blessing of subduing the enemy;<br>
Oh mother, etc.
We have no other supporter in (this) world except thyself.<br>
Rand has completely
destroyed the (Hindu) religion in the holy city (Poona).<br>
(That) wretch has ruined all.<br>
Oh mother give us firmness and daring in killing that inconsiderate man with our own hands ;
Oh mother of the universe.</p>
<p>Having invoked her in this way we came back. On our return home we began our devotions to the
Almighty. The Lord of the universe alone knows how devoutly we prayed to Gajanan, offering him
our bodies, our minds and our belongings. We believe that Gajanan answered our prayer. Our first
consideration was what weapons we should take with us, (and) we resolved that each of us should
arm himself with a sword and a pistol. My brother Bapurao, determined to take with him a hatchet in
addition. He intended to use these arms according to the exigencies of the occasion. My leaders will
remember that we had already kept the sword ready (for use). The pistol which I had chosen to take
with me was out of order. Only one of its chambers could be used. That of Bapurao had a single
barrel, but it was of large bore. Having determined to arm ourselves with these weapons, we waited
for the occasion. We spent the whole day in offering prayers to the Almighty. As we were quite
uncertain as to the success or failure of this undertaking, we were altogether unmindful of our
domestic concerns. But one thing remains to be described. Government wished that the Jubilee
festival should be celebrated by the rayats. Accordingly, in the city (Poona), nay, in the whole of
India, that festival was most loyally observed even by Princes, and Chiefs. Viewed in a proper light
this was not a time for rejoicing.</p>
<h2 id="the-queens-jubilee">THE QUEEN&rsquo;S JUBILEE</h2>
<p>There was plague in the Bombay Presidency, earthquakes on the Calcutta side and a terrible
famine all over India. How (un) generous it was (for the Queen of England) to cause the rayats,
already beset with three such formidable calamities, to celebrate the sixtieth year of her reign at
such a critical juncture instead of relieving them from those calamities. This behoves only the Queen
of England. According to our Shastras, a king and his subjects are in the same relationship as a
father and son. On this principle, the Queen is the mother of her subjects. But judging from her
actions there is no reason why, instead of being styled a subject-protecting mother, she should not
be called a female fiend who devours her own progeny. Had the Queen a generous heart, she
would have on the said joyful occasion earned the blessings of her subjects by feeding them. But as
we saw nothing of that sort, we did not like the festival at all and thought that it was the duty of every
true Aryan to show his indifference rather than to take part in rejoicings. We do not at all like to
make a false display of loyalty by means of hypocritical newspaper articles or speeches.</p>
<p>India is, at
this moment, full of such imbeciles. Though these good-for-nothing people do not at all like the
policy of the British Government, they make a great show of their loyalty in their newspapers and
speeches. Some shower upon the Queen covert ridicule in a variety of ways, but when charged
under section 124 defend their writings by asserting that they did not mean what is alleged of them.
Thinking that it was a thousand times better to openly spurn the English people, their authority and
their Queen, and to bring them into disgrace, we exerted ourselves in that direction. Our people
being conscious of the truth of the
adage &quot; Wisdom prevails not against authority &quot; were celebrating the Jubilee Festival in a half-
hearted manner, though they were unwilling to take part in the rejoicings. We however, do not
consider curselves to be her loyal subjects, and therefore, with a view to mar the rejoicings, instead
of joining in them we resolved to set up an image of the Queen of England at some conspicuous
and central spot in the Budhawar street on the morning of the Jubilee day. We laboriously searched
many rubbish heaps and procured with great difficulty some extremely old and tattered shoes. We
could get only six of them and no more. We set up these shoes on the main Budhawar road, with a
picture of the Queen stuck to the sole of each of them</p>
<p>With regard to this, our educated brethren
would taunt us by saying that we did this stealthily and not openly, yes, friends, yes ; though we did
it stealthily at that time, we knew full well that some day we would have to come forward and that
we would do so with great pride. That blessed day has now fortunately dawned upon me, for which I
thank Gajanan. Having done this in the morning we prepared ourselves to go to the Ganesh Khind
as soon as it was dusk. At the time of our departure we relinquished all hopes of our home, wives,
children, parents, friends and relatives. When leaving our house, we devoutly made obeisance to
Shri Mangalmurti, and muttering his name made a mental obeisance to our parents and bid adieu in
our minds to all, young and old, nay, we even touched our extremely favourite she-buffalo and took
leave of them all. Similarly, with the words &quot; Dear brethren. May the merits of you all help us in the
attainment of success.&quot; we left the house. We even took with us our sacred scripture, the Gita.</p>
<h2 id="we-do-it">WE DO IT</h2>
<p>It was about 7 or 7-30 o&rsquo;clock and the sun had just set. Darkness was increasing every
moment. After we had gone out of the city, we recited the above-mentioned verses in praise of the
Chatursingi Bhavani. and taking the appointed route soon reached Ganesh Khind. As soon as we
arrived there we saw Mr. Rand&rsquo;s carriage pass by, but not being quite sure that it was his, we
postponed the execution of the deed till the time of his return (from the Government House). A large
concourse of people had gathered there to witness the spectacle, but there were very few Brahmins
among them. Owing to the bonfires on the hill tops and the crowd of spectators, it became difficult
for us to walk about with our swords. Wo, therefore, deposited the two swords and one hatchet
under the stone culvert situated in the vicinity of the bungalow in such a way as to easily reach them
in case of need. This enabled us to move about with the greatest ease.</p>
<p>For fear of coming across
any acquaintance, we, instead of walking about on the public road, betook ourselves to a field in the
dark and there leisurely devoted ourselves to divine contemplation. When (I saw that) no more
carriages were coming from the city and those which had already gone there (Government House)
had begun to return, I proceeded to the gate and took my stand near it. It was arranged between
ourselves that I was to run after the carriage (of Mr. Rand) and my brother was to come to my
assistance near the yellow bungalow in the execution of the deed, and that While running after the
carriage I was to call out &quot; Gondya &quot; as a signal to him, so that he might understand that the
carriage was coming and prepare himself for action. Having made this arrangement I approached
the gate. The carriage in question came up after many others had preceded it, and having fully
identified it I gave it chase, running at a distance of some 10 or 15 paces behind. As the carriage
neared the yellow bungalow. I made up the distance (between it and myself) and called our &quot;
Gondya&quot;. My brother came up to me directly. I undid the button of the flap of the carriage, raised it and fired from a distance of about a span. Our original plan was to empty both
the pistols at Mr. Hand so as to leave no room for doubt about his death. But as my brother lagged
behind, the charge from my pistol (alone) hit Mr. Rand and his carriage rolled onwards. My brother,
suspecting that the occupants of tte carriage behind were, on seeing us, whispering to each other,
aimed his pistol at the head of (one of them) from behind the carriage and fired a bullet.</p>
<h2 id="we-escape-unnoticed">WE ESCAPE UNNOTICED</h2>
<p>We then went away with speed by the pre-arranged route. We intended to take away the
swords on the following day. On our return home we offered fervent prayers to the Almighty. We
could not sleep that night owing to excess of delight. Having bathed early in the morning we went
out and passed the Faraskhana and the Municipal Office to see if there was any excitement in the
city over the matter. But people appeared to know nothing about the incident. The news began to
spread in the city at about 10 or 11 a.m. By evening the incident was everywhere talked about and
every one was overjoyed. All Hindus and Muhammadans, whether rich or poor, young or old,
reformers or non-reformers, shared equally this feeling of extreme delight, and every one distributed
according to his means either sugar-candy or sweetmeats.</p>
<p>I leave it to my readers to imagine what
gratification we must have felt when the universal feeling of joy was so great. We were delighted
because the people were delighted ; otherwise, we had no ill-feeling against Mr. Rand.
Had he been careful not to interfere with our religion, that is to say, had he taken notice of the
lawless conduct of the soldiery, we would not have been compelled to perpetrate the deed we had
been following Mr. Rand&rsquo;s movements for nearly three months and a half, and during that period we
came to entertain a very good opinion of him. He was a proud man like ourselves and we believe
that he was not addicted to any vice. There was no meanness in his character. We had seen him
playing lawn-tennis at the Gymkhana. He would never play with ladies, and from this (we inferred)
that he disliked associating with the wives of others. We had marked this and many other traits in
his character. But of what avail was all this ? As he made himself an enemy of our religion, we
deemed it necessary to take revenge upon him. We could not help it.</p>
<p>This incident threw the Police
into a great commotion, and innumerable were the rumours that circulated in the city. Some said
that they were going to search all the houses for weapons. As we had to remove to Bombay, we
thought it undesirable to leave our weapons behind. We, therefore, tried them up in a bundle and
threw them in a well appertaining to the house of Londhe. Having learnt that the swords which we
had left underneath the culvert had been taken away by the Police to the Faraskhana, we did not go
there. But we went to pay a visit to Jagadamba and having filled the lap of that deity with a khan and
a cocoanut returned home. The next day we left for Bombay with all the members of our family by
the 1-30 p.m. train. On our way to the railway station some members of the Bombay Police Force
passed by us in a carriage, and we at once recognized them. We desired to be in Poona at this
time, but it was just as well that our wish was not fulfilled, for had we remained there we might have
been tempted to do something. We were thus a prey to alternate feelings of relief and sorrow. In this
state we arrived in Bombay. The troubles which the English as well as the natives had to undergo in
consequence of this act of ours (if narrated) would fill a big volume. I do not, therefore, think it
desirable to narrate them.</p>
