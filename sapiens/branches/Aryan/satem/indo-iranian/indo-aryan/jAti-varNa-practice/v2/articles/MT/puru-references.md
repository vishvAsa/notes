The pUru-s as per the mahAbhArata were the preeminent yayAtian clan who established the dynastic seat to which the bharata-s & their successors the kuru-s & pa~nchAla-s ascended. 

In the R^igveda the pUru-s are one of the most prominent clans. They mentioned at least 21 times as a clan.  
Of those 16 are what may be termed positive mentioned -- i.e., the gods help them win.  
3 are negative -- where the gods cause them to lose or crush them.  
3 are neutral mentions. 

2 of the 3 negative mentions are by vasiShTha. They stand out against the backdrop of positive mentions.  
The other negative mention is by the royal sage paruchChepa. 

Both vasiShTha & paruChepa also mention them positively. I have not been able to fully understand this ambivalence, though some have claimed to resolve it. One possibility is that the positive pUru-s were the old rulers whose role in the religion is acknowledged; the negative ones were probably contemporaneous members of the clan, who were enemies of paruchChepa and sudAs
