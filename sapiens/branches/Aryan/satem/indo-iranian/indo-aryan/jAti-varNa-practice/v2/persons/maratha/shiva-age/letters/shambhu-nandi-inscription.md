Here is the Sanskrit inscription by Chattrapati Shambhuji Maharaja at Yoga Nandeeshwara Temple, atop Nandi hills in Bengaluru.


According to this Inscription, Chattrapati Shambhuji Maharaja was residing peacefully in Chikkaballapura in 1680. This epigraph also implies that Chattrapati Shambhuji Maharaja renovated Nandi Hills as his summer resort like his grandfather Shahajiraje Bhonsale used to. The Muslim Mleccha invader who came to desecrate Nandi Hills was none other than Dilir Khan, the infamous Mughal Commander of Aurangzeb.

## Translation
Obeisance to Nandishwara.

To the east of the Karnataka country is the mountain named Nandi, very lofty and impregnable, with only one path, filled with Champaka, asvatha (trees).

At the very top the huge cliff is adorned with a temple.

In the Ballapura kingdom, the great mountain was made a hill fort, being reckoned a secure protection from the fear of enemies.

In order to seize the hillfort, a Mleccha came with a great force but at length was beaten off greatly distressed.

(On the date specified, mostly 21 July 1680), Shiva-Chattrapati’s son Shambhujiraje is ruling here in peace.

And the Durgadhikari (or governor of hillfort) Balaji Krishna, governing the Jagadeva hillforts, here, in pursuance of Raghunath Pandit’s orders, took over the command (or possession) of this fine hillfort.
