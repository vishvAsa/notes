The matrilineal Nayars of Kerala in southwest India constitute a populous caste, which
contains within it a large number of subdivisions. In contrasto the ideal model, on which
most standard descriptions appear to be based, these subdivisions fall into several analytically
distinguishable categories. There is a core of a few large, stable subdivisions and afringe of
many small, unstable subdivisions. The latter are created and eliminated by several processes,
one of which, treated in detail, is connected to the famous, hypergamous marriage system of
the Nayars. The statuses of tali-tiers and sambandham partners act as diacritical markers
of a subdivision's status. Modern changes in the subdivision system are briefly considered A
distinction between stable and unstable statuses in the caste system is introduced, and doubt is
raised about Dumont's and Pocock's theories of caste.

SOME YEARS AGO, Pocock (1957) drew attention to a number of the
sociological problems posed by a populous and widely distributed caste
like the Patidar of Gujarat. In this respect, the Nayars of Kerala, whose
estimated population in 1968 was around 2.9 million, or 14.5% of
Kerala's total population (Govt. of Kerala 1971: App. xviii), closely
resemble the Patidars. The Patidars, however, differ from the Nayars in
having but few named subdivisions (Pocock 1972:56). The Nayars'
marriage system has made them one of the most famous of all
communities in anthropological circles.

This paper attempts to analyze the internal structure of the Nayar
caste. It does not set out to analyze the Nayars' marriage system per se,
although it does try to show how the famed cross-caste hypergamy of
the high-ranking Nayars-involving Brahmans, Kshatriyas, and Samantans-was linked to the subdivision system within the Nayar caste.

## INTRODUCTION
Before Indian Independence, the region which now forms the
mainly Malayalam-speaking state of Kerala, in southwest India, was
divided into three parts: Malabar District, under direct British rule, in
the north; Travancore, a "Native State" ruled by its own maharaja, in
the south; and Cochin, another "Native State," a tiny kingdom
sandwiched between the two much larger units, in the center. North
Malabar, the region to the north of Calicut and the Kora River referred
to by Gough (1961:305) as "North Kerala," is not discussed in any
detail in this paper. The Nayars in that area had a kinship and
marriage system significantly different from that of their caste-fellows to
the south, and the internal structure of the caste in the north, so far as
we can judge from the scanty data on it, also differed markedly from
that found further south.

South Malabar and Cochin, which Gough (1961) called "Central
Kerala," is the region about which we know most. Here, the Nayars
lived in large matrilineal joint families known as taravads. Marriage, as it
is commonly understood, was not found among them. Before puberty,
girls underwent a ritual known as the talli-rite and, when they became
sexually mature, took one or more "lovers" in a relationship known as
sambandham. By these lovers, they bore children who were members of
their own taravad. The talli-rite and the sambandham union are discussed
later in more detail. Central Kerala is the region where the famed
"polyandry" was most prevalent, and it is there, too, that the
hypergamous system reached its fullest efflorescence. The extreme north
of Travancore (approximately equivalent to the northern part of the
modern Ernakulam District) should, I think, be included in Central
Kerala on cultural grounds, for the principal features of the Central
Kerala Nayars' social system seem to have been present in northern
Travancore too. The area lying south of this northerly part, and north
of a line drawn east-west across the center of Travancore, more or less
coincides with the region known locally as "Central Travancore." Here,
the main features of the Nayars' kinship and marriage system seem
to have been basically similar to those found in Central Kerala,
but partly because of the relative paucity of Brahmans-hypergamy was
probably neither so prevalent nor so spectacular. Compared with data
on Central Kerala, information on Central Travancore is sparse and
uneven in quality, although my own field experience in this region has
enabled me to make some sense out of some of it.

The data on southern Travancore are worst of all, and this is
particularly regrettable because it is almost certain that the kinship and
marriage system of the Nayars in this area differed substantially;


285
although Nayars belonged to matrilineal joint families, they had more
or less monogamous marriages with wives residing in their husbands'
taravads (Aiya 1906:358). But despite these major variations, the data on
subdivisions among the Travancore Nayars are nowhere (to my
knowledge) broken down by geographical area, but are presented as if
they applied to the entire state. This is unlikely to be true. Since I am so
unsure about the southern Travancore situation, I make no claim that
any of the remarks herein apply to southern Travancore, other than
extremely tentatively.

Virtually all of what is discussed in this paper is now part of history.
To summarize, during the nineteenth century the tali-rite became
progressively less and less important, and the sambandham union was
transformed into a more or less monogamous and permanent union of a
kind very similar to marriage elsewhere in India. Taravads, too, broke
up, and smaller family units became the norm. The process of change
occurred earlier and faster in Central Travancore than it did in Central
Kerala; in the former region, the tali-rite had virtually died out by 1900,
and by around 1925, practically all Nayars entered into monogamous
unions which were intended to be permanent. In the same period,
taravads were in an advanced state of disintegration, and by the 1940's,
the nuclear family had become the norm. By contrast, in Central
Kerala, the tali-rite persisted until the 1930's, and, even in the 1950's
and 1960's, a significant proportion of Nayars was still involved in
sambandham unions in which husbands did not live with their wives, but
only visited them. In this region, too, many taravads did not finally break
up until the 1950's. However, the direction of change is clear enough,
and it seems unlikely that it would halt at that point. In both regions,
Nambudiri Brahmans mostly stopped taking Nayar women as lovers in
the 1920's. As we shall see, these changes in the marriage system must
almost certainly have led to major changes in the subdivision system.
Consequently, the analysis of this system which I present must be taken
as applicable only to the past.

## NAYAR SUBDIVISIONS: PREFATORY REMARKS
One possible source of confusion, present in certain older sources
(e.g., Logan 1887:133-134), needs to be eliminated immediately. Each
male Nayar bears a caste title as his last name; examples include Nair
(the usual anglicized spelling in Kerala), Kurup, Menon, Pillai, and so
forth. In the past, it is said, these titles were conferred as marks of honor
by kings and chiefs, although some of them refer to specialized
occupations. The title could be granted to any Nayar, irrespective of his
subdivision, and thus give no indication of the latter. Further, there was


286
nothing to prevent Nayars awarding themselves these titles, as they
certainly used to and perhaps still do (C. A. Menon 1911:202).
Several Travancore census reports provided some information about
the Nayar subdivisions (vibhagam). The most detailed was that of 1901,
in which more than 130 subdivisions were discovered by the enumerators; these were compressed into 44 distinct subdivisions in the final
report (Census 1901b:321; cf. Census 1875:197-198; Census 1881:52-55;
Census 1891f:761; Census 1921b:106). The censuses of Cochin and
Madras (of which Malabar was one district) generally paid less
attention to subdivisions. An exception was the 1891 Census, which
recorded 55 subdivisions in Cochin (Census 1891a:111) and 138 in
Madras (Census 1891c:222). Some of the latter were subdivisions of
Nayars residing outside Malabar, for only 128 were enumerated in
Malabar itself (Census 1891e:380). The number of subdivisions is, as
Mencher (1966:159) remarks, strikingly high; for instance, in Malabar,
with a Nayar population of around 380,000 in 1891, the average
membership of each subdivision would have been around only 3,000.2
But an average of this sort is somewhat irrelevant, for, significantly (as
we shall see), subdivision populations were highly variable.

## THE IDEAL MODEL AND STANDARD DESCRIPTIONS

In a Malayalam text entitled the Jatinirnayam, which, as Iyer
(1912:15) explained, is a "work of some authority, which gives an
account of Malayali castes," eighteen Nayar subdivisions are listed
(with their traditional occupations) in order of rank: (1) Kiriyam; (2)
Illam; (3) Svarupam; (4) Padamangalam; (5) Tamil Padam; (6) Itasseri
(herdsmen); (7) Maran (drummers); (8) Chempukotti (coppersmiths);
(9) Otattu (tilemakers); (10) Pallicchan (palanquin-bearers); (11) Matavan or Puliyath (servants to Brahmans and Ambalavasis); (12) Kalamkotti or Anduran (potters); (13) Vattakkatan or Chakkala (oilmongers);
(14) Asthikkuracchi or Chitikan (funeral priests); (15) Chetti (traders);
(16) Chaliyan (weavers); (17) Veluttetan (washermen); and (18) Vilakkittalavan (barbers) (K. P. P. Menon 1933:192-195).3 The list bears a
striking resemblance to the standard descriptions given by Aiya
(1906:348-349) for Travancore, by Iyer (1912:14-18) for Cochin, and by
Innes (1908:116-120) for South Malabar. Hardly different is a modern

[^2] There is a distinct possibility that the censuses themselves promoted the proliferation of
subdivisions, as Nayars tried to claim higher status to the census enumerators; such attempts
were widespread in India (Srinivas 1966:94-100). It is improbable, though, that Nayars would have
invented so many subdivisions ex nihilo, and thus reasonable to assume that the subdivision
proliferation was already prominent before the censuses began.

[^3] Subdivision names have been standardized, generally in accordance with the spelling in
Hermann Gundert's Malayalam-English dictionary.


287
account, Gough's (1961:308-312). These various versions are presented
in Figure 1.
A few remarks about the information given in Figure 1 may be
made here. Except for the Jatinirnayam, each account distinguishes the
high-ranking subdivisions from those below, all of which are said to
have had traditional occupations. Only Nayars from the higher
subdivisions are said to have been soldiers. Kiriyam ranks highest
throughout Kerala, although (except in the far north) there are few
Kiriyam Nayars in Travancore. Aiya (1906) and Iyer (1912) both rank
Illam second to Kiriyam, whereas Innes (1908) states that Illam and the
two Charnavar subdivisions dispute for precedence in South Malabar;
Gough (1961), although she places Illam fifth, also indicates that
variations in ranking between districts did exist. The two Charnavar
subdivisions, mainly found in Malabar, are jointly equivalent to
Svarupam, which is absent in that region. Iyer, Innes, and Gough-but
not Aiya for Travancore-also separate from the other Nayars the lowest
three or four subdivisions, which are said to have formed a distinct
group whose touch polluted those above them. Although there are
undeniable discrepancies between these various descriptions, I hope the
reader will agree that the overall structure of the Nayar subdivision
system, as presented in Figure 1, is fairly clear and consistent.
This structure has an interesting feature, for it embodies, so to speak,
a caste system within a caste system. Except for high-ranking priests, the
Nayar subdivisions mirror all the main caste categories: high-status
aristocrats, military and landed; artisans and servants; and untouchables. But this point needs no further discussion because, as I shall now
argue, this structure is ideal rather than real.
The problem which obviously has to be considered now is how this
structure, on which the Jatinirnayam and our authors seem to agree, is to
be squared with the picture emerging from the census reports, which
recorded so many more subdivisions than are listed in Figure 1. The
problem deepens when one discovers that some of the subdivisions listed
in Figure 1 are not in the census reports at all, while others are given
with only tiny populations. For example, Chempukotti is missing from
the 138 Nayar subdivisions discovered in the Madras Presidency
(Census 1891e:69-70), from the 55 in Cochin (Census 1891b:i-vii)
-unless Chempukotti is the same as Chembottil, a distinct possibility, but it is a subdivision with a population of less than 100-and from
the 44 principal subdivisions in Travancore (Census 1901b:321).
Chaliyan, to take a second example, is also absent from the Cochin and
Travancore lists (loc. cit.); it was found in Madras-with a population of
169 (Census 1891c:223). One final example: Otattu had a membership
of less than 100 in both Travancore in 1901 and Cochin in 1891, and

less than 500 in Madras in 1891 (loc. cit.). There is, then, a double
discrepancy between the accounts summarized in Table 1 and the
census reports. Not only do many of the subdivisions listed in the latter
find no place in the standard descriptions; some of those listed in Table
1 are absent from the census reports.

The explanation for this paradox, I suggest, is that all the standard
descriptions stem ultimately from the Jatinirnayam, which embodied an
ideal model of the subdivision system. It resembled, in a localized
manner, the varna scheme and tended to be reproduced as an authentic
account of the system. That this suggestion is plausible is supported by
the role played by the varna scheme in descriptions of the Indian caste
system; as Srinivas (1962:63) has noted, "Varna has been the model to
which the observed facts have been fitted, and this is true not only of
educated Indians, but also of sociologists to some extent." Gough, like


290
the earlier authorities, is, I think, mistaken in presuming that the system
as she describes it ever accorded with the historical reality.

## AN ALTERNATIVE HYPOTHESIS
From the census figures presented in Table 1, it is clear that the
majority of Nayars belonged to the five higher-ranking subdivisions
(Kiriyam, Illam, Svarupam, Purattu Charna, and Akattu Charna) and,
of those that did not, most were included in the Itasseri and Chakkala
subdivisions (Travancore) or the Pallicchan, Vattakkatan, and Asthikkuracchi subdivisions (Cochin and Malabar). These few subdivisions
accounted for around 90% of all Nayars in each of the three provinces.
Most of the other subdivisions enumerated in the census reports had
very small populations. Many had less than a hundred members,
several had less than ten, and not a few had but one solitary
representative!
It follows fairly obviously from this that the Nayar subdivisions-at
least as they are recorded in the censuses-cannot all be groupings of a
single sociological type. An analysis which treats the Illam subdivision
(with a population of over 325,000) in Travancore as identical to the
Itattara subdivision (population 1) in the same state is clearly mistaken.
Although Gough has not proposed any notion as absurd as this, she has
stated in various places (e.g., 1959:28) that each of the aristocratic
Nayar lineages "tended to set itself up as a separate sub-caste." For this,
she has been taken to task by Dumont (1964:98):
Are the Nayar . . . a caste, and are their subdivisions really castes or
sub-castes? . . . we are confronted with an enormous conglomerate of
groups distinguished by their profession, social status. . . . Clearly these
conglomerates are not castes, although they may appear as such in certain
situations in relation to real outsider castes (Brahmans, Kshatriyas). . . . it
is clear that we have to do with populations, not with castes. . . . Among
the Nayar an exogamous lineage or cluster of lineages of a certain status
cannot be called a sub-caste. . . . All these are actually status groups which
may be absolutely (or practically) endogamous at the one end, and
exogamous at the other.
Dumont, then, argues that the Nayars constitute a "population,"
not a caste, and that their subdivisions should be regarded as "status
groups," not subcastes. A thorough discussion of Dumont's remarks
would necessitate a lengthy digression into the formulation of definitions, which is better avoided. Briefly, however, for me, the merit of
Dumont's criticism of Gough is that it deters us from labeling as
"subcastes" groups which lack certain characteristics normally regarded
as typical of castes, and thus forces us to consider more carefully the
nature of Nayar subdivisions. On the other hand, his criticism appears


291
to lead to an over-radical reinterpretation of the data in that he implies
that neither the Nayars as a whole, nor any subdivision within that
whole, forms a unit which can meaningfully be termed a caste. Given
that the Nayars live in a caste society, they must evidently fit into the
caste system at some level or another.
The key to the problem, I submit, is to recognize that there are a
number of analytically distinct categories within the system of Nayar
subdivisions. The first of these categories is made up of the handful of
populous subdivisions, such as Illam or Pallicchan. At the risk of
oversimplification, the subdivisions in this category can be visualized as
forming the stable "core" of the system. Around the core is a "fringe,"
comprised of a large number of relatively very much smaller subdivisions. The fringe is more volatile than the core, and the smaller
subdivisions are (or were) being created and eliminated by several social
processes, of which three may be analytically distinguished. The first of
these is the process by which lower-ranking groups-castes or sections of
them-are absorbed into the Nayar community as part of a process of
upward mobility. The second is the process in which exogamous
lineages are joined together to form localized subdivisions, which may
sometimes remain distinct subdivisions, or may sometimes coalesce with
larger subdivisions, thereby eliminating the previous smaller subdivisions. In the third type of process, relatively very small sections of the
community-exogamous lineages or sublineages-split off to create
subdivisions in the context of a "status game" played at the highestranking levels of the community. The latter, intimately associated with
the hypergamous marriage system, is the one which has attracted most
attention, and I shall look at it in more detail later.
An important question immediately looms: What precisely distinguishes the larger subdivisions from the others? No simple answer to this
can be given. Indeed, a completely satisfactory response is, I think,
impossible. A crucial aspect, however, is the stability to which I have
referred. The populous subdivisions are represented throughout large
regions of Kerala and have almost certainly existed for a very long time
(Mencher 1966:160). Further, their statuses are relatively stable and are
not a function of the fortunes of particular individuals, lineages, or
other small groups. By contrast, the smaller subdivisions, especially
those formed of a few lineages or even smaller kinship groupings, lack
such stable statuses. It is pertinent here that one of the crucial
characteristics of a caste is that its status is not subject to short-term
alterations in response to the changing fortunes of individual members
or small sections of the caste. Mencher (1966), arguing along similar
lines, concludes that the larger subdivisions can meaningfully be
regarded as subcastes. Her conclusion is evidently problematic, though


292
for my own part I am inclined to accept it. (Several other points about
the criteria distinguishing the larger subdivisions from the rest have also
been made by Mencher, but they are not strictly relevant here, and I
refer the reader to her paper.) The distinction between groups with
stable status and those with unstable status will be further developed in
my conclusion.

## SUBDIVISION CREATION AND ELIMINATION
The first process I isolated is that in which upwardly mobile,
low-status groups are absorbed into the Nayar community. Among
other features, the taking of the prestigious title "Nayar" may itself
serve this end (Dumont 1964:98). The process is perhaps most apparent
in the cases of the Veluttetan and Vilakkittalavan, and these two
subdivisions also well illustrate the ambiguity attached to upward
mobility. Nowadays, they are commonly referred to as "Veluttetathu
Nayar" and "Vilakkittala Nayar"-at least in Central Travancore
(where I worked) and in official publications. We have seen, too, that
the Jatinirnayam included them as Nayars; on the other hand, in early
census reports they were often enumerated as separate, non-Nayar
castes. It is still the case, despite their names, that many Nayars
belonging to higher-ranking subdivisions do not acknowledge the
Veluttetathu and Vilakkittala Nayars as "real" Nayars, and they never
intermarry with them. It is important to note that these ambiguities
cannot be eliminated by redefining categories; they are intrinsic to the
situation. Altering caste names with a view to raising status, and
thereby increasing the uncertainty of status attribution, is a fundamental feature of the caste system. A precise parallel comes from the
Patidars of Gujarat (Pocock 1972:54). In fact, it has to be conceded that
hard evidence that these two subdivisions, like some other low-status
ones such as Chakkala or Vattakkatan (oilmongers), have "risen to the
status of a low-ranking Nayar [subdivision] over a long period of time"
(Mencher 1966:160) is, as Mencher herself implies, scanty. Nevertheless,
from both indirect evidence and examples from elsewhere in India, it
does seem almost certain that such a process has occurred among the
Nayars. For some Tamil groups, the evidence of their transition to
Nayar subdivisions is quite plain (e.g., Iyer 1912:18).
It may be remarked here that hypergamy, in that it can lead to a
shortage of marriageable women for men on the lowest rungs in the
caste, promotes the absorption of lower-status groups into the larger
caste through marriage, and thus further expands the populous caste.
But the relevance of this formal property is questionable here, for the
evidence suggests that hypergamous sambandham relationships were
mainly confined to the upper levels of the caste, and were rare among


293
the lower-ranking Nayars. Statistically, the shortage of women at the
lower levels was probably insignificant.
The second process is the creation of localized subdivisions from a
number of exogamous lineages. Precisely how common such subdivisions are or were is impossible to say, for it does not emerge from census
reports or gazetteers, which also fail to describe how the subdivision
system functioned in any one locality. Unni's (1958:63-67) is the best
account of the process as it operated in one particular area. The
situation Unni describes is complex and hard to summarize. Very
briefly, however, in the two South Malabar villages which he studied,
Nayar taravads were linked by hereditary duties of a ceremonial or ritual
nature to Nambudiri families dominating the villages. By virtue of these
duties, the taravads gained a "reflected" prestige dependent on the status
of the Nambudiri family. A group of taravads with the same prestige,
usually those linked to one family in one village, would tend to become
endogamous, which means, in this context, that they would, for the
most part, exchange sambandham partners only with each other. Over
time, particularly if the group of taravads took a distinctive name, it
would effectively become a subdivision. Nayar taravads serving Nayar
chiefs, rather than Nambudiris, also formed similar groups, whose status
depended on that of their respective chiefs. Clearly, subdivisions formed
in this manner were highly localized, although they could expand by
contracting alliances with other taravads of equal status. In such a case,
the creation of a larger subdivision would simultaneously mean the
extinction of two or more smaller ones. Unni (1958) himself remarks
that his account does not do justice to the complexity of a situation in
which there was a great deal of diversity. Nonetheless, despite these gaps
in the evidence, there are, I think, sufficient data available for the
analytical isolation of this second process to be both justified and
useful.4

## SUBDIVISIONS AMONG HIGH-STATUS NAYARS
The third process I isolated was that in which small subdivisions
were formed as part of the status game played by high-status Nayars.
Most of the rest of this paper will be concerned with its description and
analysis.
4 The creation (ideally at least) of an endogamous caste subdivision from a number of
exogamous lineages is not unique to the Nayars (cf. Dumont 1970:123). In parts of North Malabar
(which is not treated in this paper, as it appears to be quite distinct from the region to the south in
many respects), very large subdivisions, such as Purattu and Akattu Charna in the Chirakkal and
Kottayam kingdoms, were said to be formed of groups of kulams, or exogamous clans. Innes
(1908:118-120) provides the fullest details on the North Malabar system. His text, however,
includes some mystifying details; for example, he implies that all kulams within a subdivision have
equal status, but then proceeds to describe the different ritual duties, titles, etc. of these kulams,
some of which even have different death pollution periods. Because I have been unable to resolve
these problems, I remain quite uncertain about the North Malabar subdivision system.


294
Like most other writers of his time, Stuart (Census 1891c), the
author of the 1891 Madras Census Report, viewed castes as rigidly
defined units. Nonetheless, he made a significant observation when he
remarked that some of the subdivision names "are only names of
families [taravads], and not of separate sub-castes. Some of the names
again are purely fanciful" (Census 1891c:222). Undoubtedly, the
fanciful names to which Stuart referred were ones like Karattakkanonarkkacharna or Sekkarivarma Rajavamsam-to be found in the list of
subdivision names given in the report (Census 1891e:69-70). That many
of these subdivisions were only single taravads ivirtually certain, for, as
I have mentioned, many subdivisions had minuscule populations. Some
were probably only sections of a taravad, and there were, in addition, the
single-member subdivisions-Nayars satisfying their vanity, I suppose,
through the medium of the census.
Almost certainly, this process of status raising occurred predominantly among the highest-ranking and most powerful or wealthy
Nayars. Thus, we can begin by looking at the Kshatriyas and
Samantans, the two castes to which the kings and chiefs claimed to
belong; however, most unbiased observers (Dumont [1961:27] is an
exception) have concluded that the Kshatriya and Samantan subdivisions should be treated merely as supereminent Nayar subdivisions.
(Such a view was not, of course, shared by the authors of publications
sponsored by the royal governments of Travancore and Cochin.)
Like the Nayars, the Kshatriyas and Samantans are matrilineal, and
they had the same marriage system. The Kshatriyas were split into two
principal subdivisions: Tambans (or Tamburans) and Tirumulpads.
Included among the former are the Cochin royal family and the
Cranganore chiefly family (Iyer 1912:151). In Travancore, the categorization differed slightly from that of Central Kerala; there, Tamburans
were divided into three categories of which only the highest-ranking-a
grouping made up of ten chiefly families and known as Koil Tamburans-were Kshatriyas. The second grouping, known as Rajas, comprised nine chiefly families (including the Travancore royal family) who
were Samantans, like the third grouping of ordinary Tamburans
(Mateer 1883:115, 118; Pillai 1940:850-853). In Central Kerala, there
were seven principal Samantan subdivisions: Eradi, Nedungadi, Vallodi, Unnitiri, Adiyodi, Tirumulpad, and Nambiyar. (Some of these
names, of course, are also employed as subdivision names or titles by
Kshatriyas and Nayars). Eradi is the subdivision to which the Zamorin
(king) of Calicut belonged; the raja of Walluvanad was a member of
Vallodi. The rajas of Chirakkal (and Travancore?) belonged to Unnitiri
(Census 1891c:229-231).[^5]

[^5]: I do not know whether there is a contradiction between the statements that the Travancore
royal family belonged to Unnitiri and that it belonged to the Raja Tamburans. The authors of


295
The raja of Travancore, however used to perform an extraordinary
ceremony known as hiranyagarbhan, "golden womb."[^6] The essential
feature of this ceremony was the casting of a hollow golden vessel
through which the raja passed. On emerging from the vessel, the raja's
caste status rose from Samantan to Kshatriya. Unfortunately for the
royal family, Kshatriya status so acquired was not hereditary, and thus
the ceremony had to be performed for each new raja. But the
misfortune of the royal house was a blessing for the Travancore
Brahmans, for when the ceremony was over, the golden vessel was cut
into pieces which the raja then distributed among the Brahmans. It has
been suggested (Drury 1890:188), although so far as I know without any
very sound evidence, that the Brahmans' lust for gold sometimes
tempted them to do away with ailing rajas, in the expectation that
another hiranyagarbhan would soon have to be performed. (For a
description of the ceremony, see Mateer 1871:169-175.)

Each Kshatriya and Samantan subdivision was minute.7 The Eradi
subdivision, to take one example, had a population of only 356 in 1891
(Census 1891c:320), and this is probably entirely accounted for by the
Zamorin's lineage. However, the significance of the Kshatriya and
Samantan subdivisions lay not in their numbers, but in the model they
provided for other Nayars involved in the status game-an example of
"imitation" (Pocock 1957:24) in the caste system. A Nayar taravad,
especially if it were wealthy or powerful, could attempt to transmute
itself into a new, separate subdivision. In such an endeavor, various
stratagems could be employed: for instance, the severance of all
connections with any demeaning occupation, the Sanskritization of
various customs, or the taking of a new name. But perhaps most crucial
of all was alteration of the taravad's marital connections-by finding men
of higher status to perform the tali-tying ceremony for the girls in the
taravad, and by beginning to accept only men of higher status as
sambandham partners for the women (cf. Mencher 1966:159). It is in the
construction of a hypergamous marriage system that the Kshatriyas and
Samantans supplied such an excellent prototype.

## NAYAR MARRIAGE
Before proceeding further, a brief outline of the Nayars' unique
works on Travancore have rarely made reference to Cochin and Malabar, or vice versa, and this on
occasion engenders confusion.
6 The precise connection between this ceremony and the golden egg (hiranyagarbhan), from
which the primeval creator, Prajapati, emerged in Hindu mythology, is unclear.
7 The Kshatriya and Samantan castes both had very small populations. In Travancore in
1931, the Kshatriya population was 3,673 (0.07% of the total population), and the Samantan
population was 97. In Cochin in 1931, the populations were, respectively, 2,128 (0.18%) and 571
(0.05%). In Malabar in 1931, the Kshatriya population was recorded as less than 0.1% of the total
population; for 1921, the Samantan population was given as 4,663 (0.15%). Sources: Census
1931d:153-163; Census 1931a:lxxii-lxxiv; Census 1931b:306-310; Census 1921a: 110-123.


296
marriage system is desirable. Much of the following will be familiar to
many readers, and some of them will be conversant too with the
theoretical debate about the implications of the system. Since this is not
an appropriate place to join that debate, however, I shall try to avoid
taking issue with other writers on the subject.
In South Malabar, Cochin, and the northern part of Travancore,
each Nayar girl underwent the talikettukalyanam (tali-rite) before
puberty. The rite incorporated a number of distinct rituals, but its only
absolutely indispensable element was the actual tying of the tall itself
(Menon 1911:192-193). (The tali is a leaf-shaped emblem, usually made
of gold or silver, which is worn on a string around the neck. For most
South Indian women, it indicates their status as married women and is
equivalent to our wedding ring.) Theoretically, although probably not
in practice, were a girl to reach menarche before the rite had been
performed, she would have been ejected from her family and outcasted.
Normally, each taravad held a tali-rite only once every ten years or so; on
this occasion, all the immature girls of the family, babies included,
would have their talis tied at the same time. In Kshatriya families,
however, tali-rites were held more often, and talis were only tied on girls
age ten to thirteen or so (Iyer 1912:152).
When a Nayar girl attained sexual maturity, she began to receive
lovers, thus inaugurating a relationship known as sambandham. Sambandham partners visited a woman at night in her room in the taravad
house, but they rarely stayed at her taravad during the day or ate there.
It was usual, although not universal, for a man to inaugurate the
sambandham by giving a piece of cloth to the woman, as well as
presenting her with other personal gifts at the three principal Malayali
festivals. Apart from exogamic restrictions (which barred a woman from
taking as a partner a member of her own matrilineal descent group or a
close patrilateral relative), there was only one restriction on the choice
of a woman's sambandham partners: that they belonged to a caste or
subdivision of equal or superior status to her own. However, the head of
the taravad, the karanavan, had to approve the partners taken by his
female dependents. The man who tied the girl's tali could, if he were of
a suitable category and so inclined, become one of her sambandham
partners, but he was not preferred over other men. Both men and
women could have several partners at once, and either party was free to
break the relationship, for any reason or for none, whenever they
wished. When a woman became pregnant, one or more of her partners
was expected to claim paternity; if none did, then it was assumed that
the woman had had sexual relations with a man of lower status. The
punishment for this crime, for herself and her baby, was outcasteing
followed by execution or sale into slavery.


297
Tying the tali around a girl's neck was a ritual recognition of her
right to receive men of appropriate status as sexual partners in the
sambandham relationship, and to bear by such men children who, if one
or more of these men claimed paternity, were legitimate-that is, in this
context, possessed of full rights in their mother's taravad and caste. It is, I
think, clear, as has been generally recognized, that this is the fundamental meaning of the tali-rite. The sambandham relationship gives rise to
only two important theoretical questions here: Why was there a
status-based restriction on a woman's choice of partner, and why was
there the insistence that a man of appropriate status claim paternity of
her children? The answer is surely that a caste is a bilateral grouping
and a child's place in the caste society cannot be determined by only
one parent. Further, the Indian system of status attribution, under most
circumstances, proscribes sexual relations between a woman and a man
of status lower than herself, and generally denies to any children born of
such a union membership of either parent's caste. For these reasons,
some recognition of paternity and an assurance that the genitor is of the
right status is necessary-even if it is only the minimal one of a man
asserting paternity.8
The analysis of Indian marriage has engendered a great deal of
controversy. Cumulatively, various writers have successfully shown that
Nayar marriage can be understood within its Indian context-that is, in
terms of purity and pollution, the natUre of caste, legitimacy and
affinity, etc. I have my disagreements with most of these writers
individually. However, to cut a swathe through the controversy, I think
it may be most sensible to regard Indian marriage, for a woman at least,
as divisible into two basic types, which may be labeled simply "first
marriage" and "second marriage" (cf. Iyer 1912:27-28; Dube 1953). (I
use these labels because I do not mean quite the same as Dumont when
he refers to "primary" and "secondary" marriages.)
In my opinion, the first marriage is primarily a rite of passage for the
girl, marking her progress, in a social sense, from girlhood to womanhood. It does not necessarily coincide with the physiological passage;
among the Nayars, for example, a girl's first menstruation was the
occasion for a rite (tirandukuli) which was quite separate from the
tali-rite (Iyer 1912:29-30). In the second marriage, a woman is linked as
a sexual partner to one or more men, by whom she is expected to bear
8 There are many sources on Nayar martiage. Descriptions may be found in Iyer
(1912:22-38), Thurston (1909:313-332), and Gough (1955, 1959). For the theoretical discussion,
see-in addition to the works of Gough (1952; 1955; 1959; 1961; 1965)-Dumont (1961;
1970:119-120), Leach (1961:Ch. 4), Yalman (1963; 1967:365-374), Mencher (1965), and Carter
(1974). I have discussed Nayar marriage, as well as modern changes in the Nayar kinship and
marriage system, at greater length in a book which I hope to have published in the not too distant
future.


298
children. The second marriage centers on the continuation of her or her
husband's line through the birth of legitimate children, while the first
marriage is principally concerned with the status of the woman herself.
In most Indian communities, the two types of marriage are not actually
separated, but are both embodied in one "ordinary" marriage, which is
thus a rite of passage for the woman as well as a rite concerned with the
progeniture of children. Hence, we can regard the tali-rite as a first
marriage, and the sambandham union as a second marriage. Although I
have completely ignored the important question of affinity, this short
summary of the ethnography and analysis of Nayar marriage will, I
hope, suffice for our present purposes.

## MARRIAGE AND THE STATUS OF SUBDIVISIONS
The elaboration of the tall-rite was closely correlated with the
wealth and prestige of the taravad for whose girls the rite was being
celebrated. But it was the status of the actual tali-tier-and the manner
in which he performed his role in certain instances-which were the
most significant aspects of the rite in relation to the status of the girl's
group. Conversely, for whom a man tied a tall could affect the status of
his group. The choice of sambandham partners was also significant in the
status game, very much more so for a woman than a man.
As I shall show later, the statuses of tali-tiers and sambandham
partners can be seen as diacritical markers of subdivision status. The
entire process can also be understood as one of "inclusion" and
"exclusion" (Pocock 1957:28); for instance, a girl's group attempts to
include itself with the higher-ranking tali-tier's or sambandham partner's
group, while excluding itself from those refused as tali-tiers or sambandham partners, and therefore accorded lower status. It is important to
note that among the higher-ranking Nayars (and Kshatriyas and
Samantans) in contradistinction to the "commoner" Nayars, no two
subdivisions admitted to equal status. Thus the relations set up by the
tall-rite and the sambandham union were always hypergamous.9 As
Gough (1959:28) phrases it, each high-status family acknowledged ritual
superiors and inferiors but acknowledged no peers.
Complete information on the statuses of tali-tiers and sambandham
partners is not available for all the high-ranking subdivisions, on which
the following account will concentrate; that which we do have is not

[^9]: The drawbacks of the term "hypergamy" have been discussed by Dumont (1964:86-90). He
points to the differences between the hypergamy of North Indian communities and that of the
Nayars. The introduction of a new term for the Nayar situation is, though, only likely to cause
further confusion, and so I follow conventional usage. Jonathan Parry, in fact, has suggested to me
that the differences between hypergamy in North and South India have been exaggerated, and
that the analytical distinction between them is overdrawn (cf. Tambiah 1973:218-223; Carter
1974:44-50).


299
always consistent. Nonetheless, the general principles underlying the
system can be ascertained.

The families of highest status were those in which only Nambudiri
Brahmans (the highest-ranking caste in Kerala) acted as tali-tiers and
only Nambudiris were accepted as sambandham partners by the women.
In Central Kerala, the sole family definitely practicing Nambudiri
exclusivism was the Cochin royal house, belonging to the Kshatriya
caste. A Nambudiri tied the tali for only one princess at a time, and he
was paid for his services (Iyer 1912:152; Census 1901a:145-146). Neither
Iyer nor the author of the census report makes it absolutely clear
whether other Kshatriya families, in particular the Cranganore chiefly
family, also employed Nambudiris to tie their girls' talis. Gough
(1955:49, 53; 1959:29; 1961:377) implies that Nambudiris tied girls' talis
in many aristocratic families but, apart from the Cochin royal family,
fails to specify which. On the other hand, Mencher and Goldberg
(1967:93-94), who have carried out fieldwork among the Nambudiris,
state flatly that in Central Kerala, except for the Cochin princesses,
Nambudiris never tied the tali for any girl of another caste. For a
number of reasons, I am inclined to believe that Mencher and Goldberg
are correct-principally because their assertion makes the most logical
sense in the context of what happened in other aristocratic families.
Of note is the fact that other Nambudiris considered the tali-tier for
even the Cochin princesses to have been polluted and degraded
(Mencher and Goldberg 1967). There was thus a kind of status
exchange operating here: the Nambudiri tier losing status as the Cochin
royal family gained it. I have been unable to find any concrete evidence
that such a status exchange was present in all tall-rites, so that a
higher-ranking tier always lost status when a lower-ranking group
employed him. If an exchange of this sort was general, however-and it
seems logical that it should have been-it has notable implications for
the analysis of Nayar marriage within its wider Indian context,
particularly in relation to the question of affinity (see, especially,
Dumont 1961). Germane to this would be the contrast with the
sambandham relationship in which, it appears, a status exchange either
did not operate or was only of minimal significance. In other words,
Nambudiri men, for example, lost nothing or very little by way of status
if they became sambandham partners of Nayar women.
In Kshatriya families of Central Kerala, apart from the Cochin
royal family, the tali-tier was an Aryapattar (a category of Tamil
Brahmans), and the women took as sambandham partners either Nambudiris, Tamil or South Kanara Brahmans, or Kshatriyas (Census 1901a:145-146; Iyer 1912:152). ("Foreign" Brahmans rank below Nambudiris in Kerala.) However, Iyer also notes, rather confusingly, that in


300
"Kshatriya houses of noble ancestry," only Nambudiris acted as
sambandham partners. A question arises because the identity of Kshatriya
families not of "noble ancestry" is obscure; the caste was small, and
many families-I would have suspected almost all-must have been
fairly closely related, through junior lines, to the royal families. (Stuart's
statement [Census 1891c:231] that in Kshatriya families, the tali-tier
was either a Nambudiri or a Kshatriya seems to me, in the light of other
evidence, implausible; his "Nambudiri" probably ought to refer to
other categories of Brahmans.)

According to Pillai (1940:851), among the ten families of Koil
Tamburan Kshatriyas in Travancore, the girls' talis were tied by
Aryapattars or, more frequently, by Nambudiris. However, these
Nambudiris were almost certainly relatively low-ranking, as none of the
highest-status Nambudiri families resided in Travancore (Mencher and
Goldberg 1967:90). Koil Tamburan women took only Nambudiris as
sambandham partners.

I shall now turn to the Samantans, continuing for the present in
Travancore. The talis of girls belonging to the nine Raja families were
tied by men from the Koil Tamburan families; in other Tamburan
families, the tali-tiers were Aryapattars (Pillai 1940:852-853). Pillai
provides no data on their sambandham partners, but according to Mateer
(1871:118, 171-172), Travancore princesses took only Koil Tamburan
men as partners.

For the Central Kerala Samantans, too, the data are incomplete,
but the overall picture is reasonably clear. In the Zamorin's family, that
is, the Eradi subdivision, talis were tied by Kshatriyas from the
Cranganore chief's family, which the Zamorin recognized as more
ancient and thus of higher rank. The talis of girls belonging to the
Walluvanad raja's family, equivalent to the Vallodi subdivision, were
tied by men of the higher-ranking Beypore chief's family (Iyer 1912:147;
Gough 1955:49). For other Samantan girls, the talis were usually tied by
Kshatriyas, although in poorer families they may have been tied by
Samantans of the Tirumulpad subdivision. In the latter case, the
Tirumulpad sometimes tied the talis of a number of girls at once
(Census 1891c:231; Iyer 1912:147), which is less prestigious than having
one tier for each girl. In the Zamorin's and other chiefly families, all
(idem.) or nearly all (Gough 1959:29) the women's sambandham partners
were Nambudiris, the possible exception being Kshatriya men from
ancient royal families.

Finally to the Nayars themselves: here, there is a great deal of
diversity. According to Iyer (1912:24-25), the tali-tier among Cochin
aristocratic families was usually a Tirumulpad, probably a Samantan
rather than a Kshatriya. Sometimes there was one Tirumulpad for each


301
girl; sometimes one tied the talis for all the girls at the ceremony. In
northern Travancore, girls in aristocratic Nayar families had their talis
tied either by Tirumulpads or Aryapattars (Census 1901b:329), although
Aiya (1906:353) believes that men from certain Ambalavasi (templeservant) castes, which were ranked between Samantans and Nayars,
could take this role. Again, there was sometimes one tier for each girl
and sometimes not. Data on the tali-rite among aristocratic Nayars are
sparse, and none of the older accounts explains exactly who these aristocratic Nayars were. According to Iyer (1912:23), Cochin aristocratic
families had to ask the raja's permission to hold a tall-rite, and make
a donation on the occasion. However, it would appear most likely that
the aristocratic Nayars were those belonging to small, high-ranking
subdivisions who were also usually district chiefs or village headmen
(Gough 1959:28). Their hypergamous marriage connections, which
distinguish them from commoner Nayars, are, of course, both a means
to, and an end of, their higher status.

Among the commoner Nayars of Central Kerala, the tali-tier was
normally an enangan, that is, a member of a lineage linked to that of the
girl by certain ritual duties, of which tali-tying was the most important.
The enangan lineages of commoner Nayars were of equal status and
belonged to the same subdivision; in the tali-rite, there was one tier for
each girl. In Travancore, enangans could also tie the tali, but in most of
the country except the extreme north, the tier more often belonged to
one of the macchampikkar families. There were three or four such families
in each village, and they were ancient Nayar families appointed as
tali-tiers by royal writ. Like tali-tiers from equal-status enangan lineages,
those from macchampikkar families only tied the tali on one girl at one
time (Aiya 1906:353). Unfortunately, I have been unable to find any
more data on the macchamppikkar families, making the obviously
relevant comparison with the enangan institution not feasible. In very
poor families, girls' talis were tied at a small ceremony held at the side
of a proper tall-rite, or in front of a temple, a Brahman's house, or a
chief's residence. The tier was not infrequently the girl's mother or aunt
(Government of Madras 1891:19; Census 1901a:159; Census 1901b:329;
Innes 1908:175; Iyer 1912:27). Although the situation is not absolutely
clear, it is, I think, best to regard these poor families as having been
forced to deviate from the norm by economic privation, rather than as
crucial exceptions to generalizations made with reference to the tali-rites
of the majority of Nayars.
Throughout South Malabar, Cochin, and the northern part of
Travancore, Nayar women-both aristocratic and commoner-accepted
men of any caste or Nayar subdivision of status equal or superior to
their own as sambandham partners. According to one source (Census


302
1901a:162), Nambudiris only took Nayar women as partners if the latter
were from aristocratic families. If this source is correct, then it would
imply (compare my earlier remarks) that there was a danger to a
Nambudiri's status in consorting with lower-status women; however, the
statement in the 1901 census report is widely contradicted elsewhere. In
spite of the permissibility of hypergamy, the "great majority" of
commoner women must, as Gough (1959:26) points out, have taken
commoner men as sambandham partners for demographic reasons. In the
remainder of Travancore, women very rarely took partners from
subdivisions other than their own; indeed, Aiya (1906:357) implies that
intra-subdivision unions were much more strongly preferred than they
were further north, although the exact difference between Travancore
and Central Kerala in this respect remains obscure.
Despite its unavoidable lacunae, my summary has, I hope, given
some indication of the way in which the statuses of those who tied the
talis for a group's girls, and of those who were sambandham partners to
members of the group, acted as diacritical markers of that group's
status. One family, and thus one subdivision, demonstrated its superiority over another by, say, having Kshatriya rather than Samantan
tali-tiers, or by accepting only Nambudiris, rather than men of any
Brahman community, as sambandham partners for its womenfolk. And,
conversely, although this appears rather less distinctly in the data, one
subdivision may have demonstrated its superiority over another by
refusing to supply talli-tiers to an allegedly lower-status group. Now,
clearly, such a demonstration of superiority is necessarily implied by
refusal. But what is unclear is strategy-whether or not subdivisions
would actually try to rise by refusing to act as talli-tiers to alleged
inferiors. Evidence from elsewhere in India suggests that they might
have done so. It should also be recalled that according to certain
classical texts, upward mobility is sometimes possible through repeated
isogamous marriages (Tambiah 1973:202). Forming isogamous, rather
than hypergamous, links at the tali-rite and through sambandham unions
might have been a route to higher status (as, perhaps, in the
subdivisions described by Unni [1958]). Again, evidence on whether
such a strategy was in fact adopted is not, to my knowledge, present.
I must briefly refer to the question of how many tiers were present at
the tall-rite. I have already indicated the prestige connotations of this,
but it has a wider theoretical implication as well. If there was only one
tier for several girls, this would imply equal status for all the girls and
their immediate matrilineal descendants. If each girl had her own tier,
however, this was not necessarily so, and thus the possibility of different
descent lines within the taravad having various statuses was opened up.
We have here the "parcelization" of status-the creation of minute


303
units, each with different status, which in turn increases the permutations of ranking within the caste, and the opportunities for mobility
within it.

In concluding this section, I would like to re-emphasize the
dynamism of this process whereby subdivisions, equivalent to taravads or
sections of them, were created and eliminated in the competition for
status. If a commoner taravad, probably after it had become wealthy or
otherwise powerful, wished to raise its status, it could try to form
hypergamous relations in place of its previous isogamous ones. It might
have begun by permitting only higher-status sambandham partners for its
womenfolk. As we have seen, the choice of a man's sambandham partners
did not really affect his taravad's status. Severing enangan ties was
probably more difficult, although severance would be an essential part
of the status-raising process, for, as we have seen, the tall-tier was always
of higher rank in aristocratic families. An aristocratic taravad whose
relations were already hypergamous could attempt to rise still further
by finding men of yet higher status to act as tall-tiers and sambandham
partners. An illustration of this comes from the Zamorin's family,
which, in the eighteenth century, began to accept only Nambudiri
partners for its women, whereas it had previously accepted certain
Kshatriya men as well (Gough 1955:47). But as taravads could rise, so too
could they fall if those who had acted as tall-tiers and sambandham
partners refused to continue, thus forcing the taravad to accept men of
status lower than their predecessors to perform these roles. Mobility was
no one-way process.

## MODERN CHANGE IN THE SUBDIVISION SYSTEM
Much of what has been discussed here has, of course, now
disappeared. A principal feature of the subdivision system has vanished
as a result of the decline in significance, and then the disappearance, of
the tali-rite, together with the transformation of sambandham into
monogamous marriage. Concrete data, as opposed to general impressions, are sparse on the subject of Nayar subdivisions in modern times,
and few generalizations applicable to all of Kerala can be hazarded.
However, I do have some data from my fieldwork in Central Travancore.10 This region, though, is almost certainly atypical because the
Nayar Service Society (N.S.S.), the caste association of the Nayars, was
founded in this area in 1914, and still has most of its support there.
Arguing that only as a united community could Nayars form a
powerful political force in the state, the N.S.S. has always campaigned
10 Fieldwork in Central Travancore was carried out between August 1971 and October
1972. It was financed by the United Kingdom Social Science Research Council and the Smuts
Memorial Fund, University of Cambridge, to whom I express my gratitude.


304
for the abolition of subdivisions among the Nayars. It has not only
encouraged intermarriage between subdivisions, but has asked Nayars
to refuse to reveal their subdivision membership to census enumerators.
Partly because of this campaign, the 1931 Travancore Census Report
(Census 1931c:364, 377) stated that the N.S.S. campaign to fuse the
subdivisions had been a success, and that there were now only two
subdivisions remaining. However, the author of the 1941 census report
was more cautious, noting that the "correctness" of the remarks made
ten years earlier "could not be vouched for" (Census 1941:131). His
caution was wise, for although there were commentators such as the
author of the Travancore State Manual who claimed that "even
intermarriages are now quite common and meet with the full approval
of society" (Pillai 1940:858), the validity of this claim is highly dubious.
Even today, in Central Travancore, intermarriages between subdivisions are very rare.
In the area where I worked, many Nayars see the persistence of
subdivisions within their community as a social and political problem,
and they tend to deny their existence when outsiders ask about them.
Only my frankest informants, once they realized that I had deduced
that subdivisions still existed, would discuss them with me. In Central
Travancore today, four Nayar subdivisions are found: Illam, Svarupam,
Itasseri, and Chakkala. There are also the Veluttetathu and Vilakkittala
Nayars, but these two are not regarded by other Nayars as "real"
Nayars at all, and they are ranked by most people-Nayars as well as
non-Nayars-considerably below "real" Nayars, being accorded a status
approximately equal to that of the artisan castes. Turning to the other
subdivisions, the reader will recall (see Table 1) that these four, together
with Kiriyam, were by far the largest subdivisions in Travancore in
1901, and that together they accounted for over 90% of all Nayars in the
state. Kiriyam, as I have mentioned, was mainly confined to the area of
Travancore bordering on Cochin.
There are two obvious hypotheses as to why Illam, Svarupam,
Itasseri, and Chakkala are, apparently, the only subdivisions currently
existing in Central Travancore. The first, and simpler, is that these four
are the only ones which have ever been represented in the region. The
second hypothesis is that other, smaller subdivisions have been absorbed
into the four larger ones. Although I know of no data which would
permit us to clinch either of these hypotheses, the first seems less likely
solely on the grounds that I can find no apparent reasons why there
should not have been many small subdivisions in this part of Travancore. Admittedly, this is an extremely weak argument, but without any
information bearing on the distribution of subdivisions within Travancore, it cannot be reinforced.


305
The second hypothesis is, in my estimation, more likely. Gough
(1961:308) and Mencher (1966:161) both refer to the current tendency
toward amalgamation of Nayar subdivisions, although they do not
produce much concrete evidence to support their statements. In Central
Travancore, there is the additional factor of the N.S.S.'s campaigns,
which may have led to the absorption of smaller subdivisions into the
larger ones, even though they have not succeeded in eliminating the
latter as well. But I must repeat: much of the above argument is
speculative, and further, the distinct possibility exists that the impression gained by Gough, Mencher, and myself-an impression shared by
many Nayars-that subdivisions have tended to amalgamate is false.

## CONCLUSION
In writing this paper, I have had a number of objectives in mind.
The first was to provide a more accurate empirical description of the
Nayar subdivision system than presently exists in the literature. Using
early census reports in particular, I hope to have shown that the system
does not consist of a relatively small number of clearly defined
subdivisions, but rather of a relatively large number of ill-defined
groupings (cf. Beck [1972:258], who argues similarly for subcastes
throughout India). These fall into four analytically distinguishable
categories. At one extreme, there is a small number of populous
subdivisions, incorporating the vast majority of Nayars, which can be
regarded as subcastes, whereas at the other extreme, there is a multitude
of tiny subdivisions-mainly high-status-which consist of exogamous
groups or sections of such groups. To describe these latter as subcastes
would be an abuse of the term for, perhaps most importantly, they lack
stable statuses.
I should draw the reader's attention to a factor which would, I
suspect, be of considerable importance in a comprehensive account, but
which I have been unable to treat in any detail; this factor is the
relation between subdivisions and territory. We have already seen that
the kinds of subdivisions described by Unni (1958) were confined to
particular localities; further, both Mencher (1966:160) and Miller
(1954:416-417) refer to the geographically limited distribution of
subdivisions. In particular, there was a contrast between the higher
subdivisions, which were represented over large areas (although members of different subdivisions were rarely all found in one village), and
the lower subdivisions, which tended not to be so widespread. In more
modern times, there has been a tendency toward greater mixing of
subdivisions within a particular locality. Comparative evidence from
elsewhere in India-for example, the Rajputs of Malwa (Mayer


306
1960:152-161) or the castes in Konku, Tamilnadu (Beck 1972:2, 66-78 &
passim), as well as Miller's paper (1954)-would suggest that the
relation between subdivisions and territory is of considerable significance. But, as I have mentioned, there is little useful information on
the geographical distribution of subdivisions, making it impossible to
discuss the issue in any detail.
The second objective has been an attempt to demonstrate how
Nayar marriage, especially in its hypergamous dimension, is connected
with the subdivision system. We have seen that hypergamy is a crucial
component of the status game at the top. The existence of this
connection has long been recognized, by Gough (1959:28-29), for
example, but I think I have been able to spell out the details more fully
than previous writers, for they have worked with an inaccurate picture
of the subdivision system. There has also been an understandable
tendency for discussions of Nayar marriage to focus on the conundrums
posed for theories of kinship, marriage, and the family. Without in any
way decrying the value of these discussions, I would suggest that they
have meant that the status implications involved in the choice of talitier and sambandham partner have been somewhat neglected. Further,
the attempt to fit the Nayars into Indian society on a wider level has
meant that the nature of the Nayar community itself has not received
the attention it deserves.
The latter remark brings me to the third objective, which has been
to ask again the question: What is the Nayar caste? Pocock, on the basis
of his work among the Patidars of Gujarat, was forced to pose an
identical question (1972:52). Some of the parallels between the Nayars
and the Patidars have already been mentioned, but further ones no
doubt exist. For instance, Pocock stresses the heterogeneity within the
Patidar community-there is no single set of beliefs or customs uniting
all Patidars, nor is there economic homogeneity within the caste-and
his remarks apply equally to the Nayars. In other words, the Nayars,
like the Patidars and indeed many other castes, cannot be seen as some
kind of solidary block incorporated into a stable system with a number
of similarly solidary castes. There is nothing original in this conclusion;
although many earlier writers did tend to see castes as blocks of this
kind, more modern research has demonstrated clearly enough that such
a picture is wrong.
However, there has been no simple or satisfactory replacement for
the old view. Dumont and Pocock represent two approaches to the
problem, and the issue between them revolves around the question of
whether or not there is only one kind of status principle operating in the
caste system. Briefly, Dumont contends that this is the case, whereas
Pocock proposes a distinction between the kind of status ordering


307
relations between castes and the kind of status appertaining within the
caste.
For Dumont, the old view of castes as solidary blocks was permeated
with the "substantialist fallacy."
Castes are not homogeneous status groups hierarchized from outside, an
ordered series of pigeon-holes. This is a substantialist fallacy. The
hierarchical principle does not stop at the outward boundary of each
particular caste-group, it permeates it, and the caste boundary is only one
more marked cleavage than others (Dumont 1964:83).
Later, he stressed the segmentary structure of the caste system. Rather
than try to identify or define a "caste" or "subcaste," one should focus
on the total system, defined according to a uniform principle of
hierarchy (1970:41-42, 61-64). But this directive poses its own problems.
It is, of course, a defining characteristic of a segmentary system that
each segment is structurally homologous with each other segment and
with the whole, and that the principle of segmentation is uniform at all
levels of the structure. This does not mean that each segment has
identical functions. But, in fact, it is not clear that structural homology
is always present in castes and their subdivisions.
Dumont discusses the case of yet another huge and heterogeneous
caste, the Sarjupari Brahmans of Uttar Pradesh, among whom localized
patrilineal groups bear titles which are indicative of a certain "status."
But, according to Dumont (1970:123), "The 'status' in question has no
effect outside the relation of intermarriage; one would therefore rather
speak of a certain consideration or prestige. . . ." Within the Sarjupari
Brahman, and also the Rajput and other populous castes, Dumont
(1970:123) emphasizes that "status is ascribed not only to endogamous
but also exogamous groups." Whether this fact would imply merely that
segments in this system are functionally differentiated, as one would
expect, or whether it implies that they are not structurally homologous,
and that some modification of the segmentary model of the caste system
is therefore required, is unclear. At this point, Dumont seems indecisive;
although uncomfortable and tempted toward historical speculation, he
avoids any direct confrontation with the issue.
Pocock, on the other hand, is explicit. For him, the caste boundary
does represent a real divide, and status within the caste is not identical
to status between castes:
It seems analytically necessary to speak of standing of a person, a family, or a
group of families within the caste as opposed to the status which they may
have in their relationship with other castes (Pocock 1972:65).
If one were to use the term "status" to describe the relation between,
say, two Patidars, it would imply that this relation was homologous to


308
that between castes, which, asserts Pocock, is absurd. But to my mind
anyway, Pocock fails to show why it is so absurd.
Nonetheless, Pocock is making an analytically significant and
probably ethnographically valid point. I, however, would like to
redefine his proposition somewhat; I would suggest that the essential
distinction which needs to be made is not between status within the
caste and status between castes, but that between relatively stable and
relatively unstable statuses. For short, let us refer simply to stable and
unstable status. In addition, I would insist that no hard and fast dividing
line between stable and unstable status can be drawn. Rather, they
represent poles of a continuum, and, further, the conversion of unstable
status to stable status is a fundamental element in the system. What I
am saying, in other words, is that the distinction between status and
standing is better expressed as one between stable and unstable status,
and that it should not be conceived of as a simple binary opposition.
No doubt my argument needs further explication. It is plain, I
think, that the status attached to a caste is normally more or less
constant over longish periods of time, and that it is not subject to
short-term fluctuations in the fortunes of members of the caste. The
status attached to a kinship group, a family, or, most extremely, an
individual, is, on the other hand, much less permanent, and, unlike
caste status (which is-ideologically anyway-defined by supposedly
immutable ritual criteria), it is subject to relatively short-term alterations in response to changing economic and political fortunes. This
dichotomous distinction gives rise to a series of points.
First, I want to make it clear that I am defining neither kind of
status in terms of economic or political variables. Normally, either kind
will be ideally conceived of as being independent of economics and
politics. Of course, they are not-but what is relevant here is not that
fact in itself, but the "lag": how long it takes for status to alter in
accordance with changes occurring outside its own domain. At the same
time, however, and this is my second point, the stable/unstable
distinction will often also refer to different sorts of status criteria; most
especially, stable status will tend to depend on ascribed ritual criteria
(purity and pollution), while unstable status will tend to be accorded on
the basis of achievements-successful marriages, occupation of eminent
offices, military valor, etc. The distinction thus implies a nonuniform set
of principles of status attribution. The third point, though, is that
despite this dichotomy, there is a continual striving toward the
conversion of unstable, achieved status into stable, ascribed status, and
this is one important aspect both of, say, an individual taravad's attempts
to contract higher-status marital connections, and of endeavors by castes
or sections of them to follow the classic path of Sanskritization.


309
I should further point out that my definitional distinction, in itself,
incorporates neither the intra-caste/inter-caste distinction, nor the
endogamous/exogamous group distinction. This point is particularly
relevant in the Nayar context for, as I tried to show, the handful of large
subdivisions had stable statuses; in other words, they had statuses
comparable in their stability to that of the caste as a whole. In this
respect, these large subdivisions differed from the many small, highranking Nayar (and Kshatriya and Samantan) subdivisions, whose
statuses were unstable and sensitive to changing economic and political
fortunes in the short-term. Within the caste, therefore, subdivisions
differed from each other in the kinds of status attaching to them. This
conclusion implies a rejection of Dumont's uniform segmentary model
and, at the same time, a rejection of Pocock's analysis, although the
latter did provide the catalyst for the argument I have developed.
To return to the question of what the Nayar caste is (or was): it is a
large, named social group (or, perhaps preferably, category) with a
stable status, vis-A-vis other castes in Kerala. It is not, however, a
solidary group, and, the efforts of the N.S.S. notwithstanding, it is never
likely to become one. It is internally divided into a number of different
types of group. First, the few large groupings, to which the overwhelming majority of Nayars belong, also have stable status. (It would, of
course, be foolish to repeat a mistake and conclude that the large
subdivisions represent some sort of solidary blocks. Obviously they do
not.) Second, there are (or rather were) many very small groups with
unstable status; these were lineage-based groupings engaged in a status
game at the highest levels of the caste. Third, there were subdivisions
consisting of either upwardly mobile groups or conglomerates of
lineage-based groupings, which had statuses less stable than the large
subcastes, but more stable than the small, high-ranking subdivisions.
Over time, this third type of subdivision would normally (though not
inevitably) gain increasingly stable status. This is hardly an exhaustive
definition of the Nayar caste, but it may perhaps be accounted a step
forward, and a contribution toward the understanding of those vast,
amorphous castes, distributed throughout India, which have arguably
received less attention than their numbers warrant.
