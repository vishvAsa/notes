      <description>&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&#34;https://x.com/blog_supplement/status/1990214533294514564&#34;&gt;TW&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;About 15 km west of the fort of udayagiri (Udgir) in Eastern Maharashtra (near which the marAThA-s won a decisive victory against the Nizam under sadAshiva rAv) lies the hamlet of Karadkhed, which today is mostly plowed and cultivated fields with hardly any sign of being a major civilizational center. People in the state are hardly aware that its name has a Dravidian origin: karaDikallu (in Tam/Kan: Bear-Rock).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It is not clear why that name came to be, as we see no bears and the eponymous rock is probably the abandoned hill in the outskirts of the village. However, several inscriptions point to the place having once had prominence in the heydays of the chAlukya-s and the raTTa-s.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
