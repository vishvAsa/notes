The situation which Mr. Tilak occupied towards the middle of 1920 was the most enviable any public man has occupied in India. He was the most success###ful and the most longlived of the band of self-sacrificing workers who started the New English School (1880), the Kesari and the Mahratta (1881). His opponents — Ranade, Telang, Mehta and Gokhale — were gathered to their fathers before the substantial achievement of their labours. He alone represented, not merely the youngest but the oldest generation living. Starting his life as an ’ opponent of Social Reform ’ he lived to count the staunchest reformers among his lieutenants. The branded ’ enemy of the Mahomedans ’ was the ambassador of Hindu-Moslem unity at Lucknow and his active co-operation was sought by and promised to the leaders of the Khilafat movement. The slogan of Swaraj, issuing from his pen in 1895 was echoed by the National Congress of 1906 and the Government of India Act of 1919. His no-rent campaign of 1896 forms one of the planks of the Non-co-operation programme.">

  <blockquote>
<p>Mr. Tilak is dead ! Long live Mr. Tilak !</p>
<p>The Tribune.</p></blockquote>
<p>The situation which Mr. Tilak occupied towards the
middle of 1920 was the most enviable any public
man has occupied in India. He was the most success###ful and the most longlived of the band of self-sacrificing
workers who started the New English School (1880),
the Kesari and the Mahratta (1881). His opponents —
Ranade, Telang, Mehta and Gokhale — were gathered
to their fathers before the substantial achievement of
their labours. He alone represented, not merely the
youngest but the oldest generation living. Starting
his life as an &rsquo; opponent of Social Reform &rsquo; he lived to
count the staunchest reformers among his lieutenants.
The branded &rsquo; enemy of the Mahomedans &rsquo; was the
ambassador of Hindu-Moslem unity at Lucknow and
his active co-operation was sought by and promised to
the leaders of the Khilafat movement. The slogan of
Swaraj, issuing from his pen in 1895 was echoed by the
National Congress of 1906 and the Government of India
Act of 1919. His no-rent campaign of 1896 forms one
of the planks of the Non-co-operation programme.</p>
<ul>
<li>The wrecker of the Congress&rsquo; was its greatest bulwark
and chosen President. Dreaded by the Government,
hated by Anglo-Indians, feared by the Moderates, he was</li>
</ul>
<p>THE END 305</p>
<p>the idol of the country, the living embodiment of all
its aspirations. Behind him lay the memories of an
uneven and almost single-handed struggle extending
over forty years. Ahead, there was a struggle still,
but a struggle where victory was certain, and the sinews
of war quite abundant. He was not only the Moses
but the Joshua of the Promised Land. He had won his
Austerlitz at Amritsar, and the future struggle, grim
as it promised to be, was in a sense far easier than
the one in which he was engaged ever since his entry
into the public life.</p>
<p>But, — alas ! the end was approaching. Ever since
his return from Amritsar, a sense of inexplicable fatigue
frequently haunted him. He would occasionally talk
of retiring from active hfe. PoUtics meant strain, phy###sical and mental and he did not feel himself up to it.
This was surely the whispering of Death.</p>
<p>After his sickly boyhood, Mr. Tilak enjoyed many
years of exuberant health and energy. Rarely, if
ever, he was HI. His digestion was exceptionally
nice. He had the glut of a giant for thought or action.
His powers of endurance were wonderful. His sleep
was short and sound and very often he could dispense
with it altogether. After a busy day, he usually read
far into the night and was up at the usual time. His
reading, deep and varied, lasting at a stretch for hours
together, was never known to weary him.</p>
<p>With the incarceration of 1897, there came a change.
He lost enormously in weight. His health was pulled
down ; his digestion was enfeebled. After his release
he spent a few months at Sinhgad in rest and in the
improvement of his health. To a certain extent it
20</p>
<p>306 LOKAMANYA TILAK</p>
<p>did improve. But he never fully recovered from the
blow.</p>
<p>Then came diabetes, the companion of the English###educated in India. Evidently it was the gift of the
Yeravda jail and it cast sUght shadows of old age on
his person.</p>
<p>For the last fifteen years of his life, this fell disease
was his companion. Bravely did Mr. Tilak fight with
it and so far was he successful that the disease did not
torment him with all its virulence. It was, however,
stni there, working insidiously, and slowly and silently
sapping his strength ! He held the fell disease in his
^p ; the disease too, did not loosen its hold.</p>
<p>Having studied all the existing medical Uterature on
the subject, he fixed a regimen for himself to which he
adhered with military rigour. When it was hot, he
usually lived at Sinhgad. Periods of hard work were
carefully followed by rest. When he rested, he kept
no books, he read no papers. He left instructions at
Poona regarding the disposal of correspondence. Only
the most important matters — private or public — whose
execution could not be delayed and particularly those
which required his instructions, were reported to him. His
morning walk, occasionally in the company of some
obscure villager, lasted for three or four hours and
was followed by an hour&rsquo;s plunge. This completed
the day&rsquo;s exercise.</p>
<p>His capacity to withdraw his mind from work, stood</p>
<p>him in good stead. Always optimistic, he never allowed</p>
<p>worries, small or great, to trouble him. His self-control</p>
<p>was wonderful and helped him considerably in improv-</p>
<p>ng his health. Storm after storm swept past him.</p>
<p>THE END 307</p>
<p>leaving him, calm and self-possessed. His private
life, lived in the full blaze of publicity, was a tower of
strength to him ;for virtue is the greatest tonic.</p>
<p>Call it the peace of a philosopher, the faith of the
hero, the light-heartedness of a child or the recklessness
of a soldier, his mental equanimity was the secret of
his health. The dread uncertainties of our pubUc hie
explain to a great extent why many a public worker
dies young. To work with despair and defeat writ
large on the wall is, indeed, a trial ; and to this trial
our spirited workers are being put these many years.
The longevity of a Dr. Bahandarkar, may not cause
wonder ; but the comparative longevity, which Mr.
Tilak reached, surprises those who consider his mental
sufferings, his extraordinary brain-work and the
vicissitudes of his life.</p>
<p>Chiplonker died in 1882, Apte in 1892, Agarkar,
Kelkar, and Namjoshi in 1895, all in the prime of hfe.
At one time Mr. Tilak thought that he too, would be sum###moned away early. Providence, however, had reserved
for him a longer career, to be written in letters of gold ;
and yet could he not have been spared a httle more ?</p>
<p>The organization of the Congress Democratic Party,
the welding of Mr. Gandhi&rsquo;s programme with his own.
an ultimatiun to the Bureaucracy, a vigorous foreign
propaganda, these were the thoughts that occupied his
waking and sleeping hours in the last month ( July
1920) of his Hfe. In the course of this month, he had
severe attacks of malaria. However, he completely re###covered, went to Bombay for his last fight in the Tai
Maharaj case, triumphed over his enemies and had
begun to think of recuperating his strength when</p>
<p>308 LOKAMANYA TILAK</p>
<p>an evening motor-drive brought him a chill whicS
soon developed into high fever. None, however, sus###pected the worst and congratulatory anniversary meet###i ngs were held (23rd July) in Bombay and elsewhere.
The fever, brought by the chill, subsided only to rec###tum soon. From Monday night (26th July), &quot; his###fever took a decidedly serious turn and it was found
that the base of his right lung was affected and the
fever developed signs of pneumonia. The whole of
Tuesday was a day of anxiety. There was no brain###complication and his consciousness was unimpaired.*&rsquo;
Still the situation was critical and his friends and rela###tives gathered to wait upon him. He chaffed his son
upon having run up to Bombay on this flimsy pretence
and his daughters upon being rather too fond of their
parents&rsquo; home. He disdained to leave any initructions
regarding his affairs, though pressed to do so. &ldquo;I
am not going to die, these five years,&rdquo; he said &quot; be sure
of that.&quot; Wednesday morning, the temperature was
normal and the pulse regular. This was a happy sign.
But in the afternoon &quot; again he got fever and again his
heart began to show signs of weakness. He lost all
consciousness and became delirious. He continued
more or less in the same state during the whole of
Wednesday and Thursday. On Wednesday, there was
a complication of the stomach which began to be dis###tended. With great difficulty, the doctors led him out
of the crisis. On Thursday at about 5 p.m., he had an
attack of angina pectoris which threatened to be serious
and fatal but, thanks to the timely efforts of the doctors,
he was pulled out of it. He had similar attacks, three
times afterwards, but they were weak in intensity. On</p>
<p>THE END 309</p>
<p>Friday and the whole of Saturday, he continued in the
same unconscious state of mind with uncertain and
irregular pulse and a weak heart. Suddenly at 10-30
P.M., his heart began to show signs of exhaustion and
his breathing became hard, and at last at 12-50 a.m.,
August 1st, 1920, the cruel hand of Death snatched him
away.&quot;</p>
<p>Anxious messages, distinguished callers, large, un###manageable crowds testified to the love and devotion
he inspired. During the sad week, the hearts of all
Indians, alternating with hopes and fears, must have
gone up to the Almighty in silent or vocal prayer. But
the hopes were dashed to the ground and the worst
fears proved true, when on August ist, the news of his
demise was flashed all over the country !</p>
<p>What a pity that he left us no parting message 1
True, his whole life was one long message, a source of
inspiration to all. When his feeble body was struggling
v/ith his departing soul, even then, he thought, not of
home and family, but of his God and his country. In
the earher stages of his unconsciousness, when a copy
of the Gita was shown to him, he uttered his favourite
verses : —</p>
<p>&quot; Whenever virtue subsides and vice prevails I come
down to protect the good, to destroy the wicked and to
establish Dharma.&quot; {Gita, Chapter 4, Verses y &amp;S).</p>
<p>These memorable words of Lord Krishna, uttered by</p>
<p>310 LOKAMANYA TILAK</p>
<p>Mr. Tilak in his unconscious state, reveal the back###^ound of his mind. He braved the terrors of gaol-Ufe,
he could Uve down all obloquy, persecution and misre###presentation on the strength of this Faith. All the
political battles fought by him were not waged for any
earthly reward but from a high sense of duty, based on
an unshakable faith that God was working through him.
During all the storms of his life, he never felt weak or
pessimistic because he knew that he was a mere pawn
employed by that Divinity which presided over the
destinies of India. A Tilak may come and go ; but His
work would never wait ; and when the ground is suffi###ciently prepared. He shall come down to estabhsh the
reign of Peace and Goodness.</p>
<p>Mr. Tilak&rsquo;s scattered and subdued utterances in deli###rium bespeak his love of the country. He frequently^
referred to the Calcutta Congress and asked &quot; Has the
Special been arranged ?&quot; *&rsquo; Have you wired to Mr.
Pat el ?&quot; Then there was the Punjab wrong to which
he occasionally referred. Sometimes, he would get
excited and talk wildly. In an outburst of passion he
cmce said &quot; 500 rupees to the editor; plus motor###aUowance ! What will these lord-lings do for the
country ?&quot; On the 28th, he frequently talked of 1818
&quot; 1818 — 1918 — one hundred years — what a Ufe of servi###tude !&quot; The last important words, reported to have
been uttered by him on July 29th at i p.m., were &quot; unless.
Swaraj is achieved, — India shall not prosper. It is
required for our very existence !&quot;</p>
<p>The funeral of the Lokamanya was as memorable as
his life. It has been thus graphically described by a
contemporary : —</p>
<p>THE END 3H</p>
<p>&quot; It was one o&rsquo;clock at midnight. All round was peace
and calmness. There was a little drizzle of rain and
men, not knowing the disaster that was to overtake
them on the morning of the next day, were having a
sound and sweet sleep. But the mysterious power,
&lsquo;which rules the world was wide awake, and stealing a
march on the subconscious man, carried away one of
the most honoured, respected and beloved of the
people- . . . .(When morning broke, people found that)
the vigilant watchman of India&rsquo;s cause had disappeared
from their midst. . . . The news of his death gave a
shock to the people, it stunned them, they looked at
each other with blank eyes and they knew not what
to do.</p>
<p>&quot; Never before in the history of Bombay, was such a
scene of universal grief witnessed. People had begun
to flock near Sirdar Griha from 7 in the morning and by
8a.m., there was no room for anybody to go up to catch
his last sight. The labourer had left the miU, the Mar###wari his account-book, the Bania his purse and every
man and woman was out to see the last of their be###loved leader. Musalmans, Parsees, Christians deserted
their homes to pay their respects to a man, who had
sacrificed his all at the altar of the country and suffered
heavily for bravely defending her cause. In his life###time, Mr. Tilak was the recipient of many popular de###monstrations of good-will but the triumphal march of
of dead Tilak through the streets on August ist, 1920
was more magnificent than any during his life-time.</p>
<p>&quot; The body of Lokamanya Tilak was brought out and
put on the balcony so that it could be witnessed by the
eager and expectant crowds. The crowd increased at</p>
<p>312 LOKAMANYA TILAK</p>
<p>every moment and it grew so tremendous that although
the funeral procession was timed to start at i p.m., it
could not be started till 2 p.m. The procession was
about a mile and a half and at a very conservative
estimate, about two lakhs of men took part in it.</p>
<p>*&rsquo; In the funeral procession were seen Mr. Gandhi,
Mr. Shaukat Ah, Dr. Kitchlew, Mr. Jamnadas, Mr.
Banker, and many other prominent citizens of Bombay.
Two special trains from Poona brought a number of
Mr. Tilak&rsquo;s friends and devoted followers. They claim###ed that Mr. Tilak&rsquo;s body should be cremated at Poona.
The people of Bombay insisted on getting the honour to
themselves and in the end they won and cremated him,
by special arrangements, on the sands of the Back Bay.
His body was seated in a palanquin and the pall-bearers
included Mr. Gandhi, Mr. Shaukat Ali, Dr. Kitchlew
and many others. On the route, the procession had to
stop at innumerable places, because a number of people
came out to offer flowers. At every step, most enthu###siastic ovations were received.</p>
<p>&quot; The body was gently placed on a pyre of sandal###wood, so lo\dngly and liberally supplies by the Parsi
traders ; and at sun-down, the last earthly remains of
the Sun of Maharashtra were reduced to ashes!&quot;</p>
<p>The unexpected death of a personality of the magni###tude of Lokamanya Tilak united, for a time, all parties,
and all India mourned for the eternal loss of her great
son. Even the Anglo-Indian Press, taken as a whole,
expressed appreciation of their life-long opponent.
Only the Government of Bombay refused to shed tears
with the nation ; and His Excellency Sir George Lloyd
orfeited a precious opportunity of winning the hearts</p>
<p>THE END 313</p>
<p>of the people by a tactful concession to the sentiments
of 17 non-official members of the Council, who, belong###ing to different political parties had united in desiring
that the Council should be closed in honour of Mr. Tilak
** a former member of this Council, a great Oriental
scholar and a prominent worker in the cause of the
country, held in high estimation by a large number of
the people of India.&quot; But the Bureaucracy was as
unwilling to forget its old grievances against Mr. Tilak
as the Times of India or the Statesman.</p>
<p>Thousands of memorials to the Lokamanya have
been suggested and raised in different parts of India.
But the grandest of them all is the one for which
Mahatma Gandhi moved from city to city and province
to province, collecting huge sums during the eventful
months of April, May and June 1921. As the Mahat###maji has said &quot; Truly to revere the memory of a person
is to achieve his life&rsquo;s purpose. Truly to revere the
Memory of Bal Gangadhar Tilak, whom India delighted
and still delights to call Lokamanya must be to esta###blish Swaraj and thus forever perpetuate his
memory.&quot; For this purpose, the Mahatma ji has col###lected the biggest fund ever raised by the people of
India during the last hundred years. &quot; The Tilak
Memorial Swaraj Fund &quot; will go down to posterity as
a unique event in the history of this country. It will
perpetuate not only the name of the Lokamanya but
also that of Mahatma Gandhi, who, in three short
months has accomplished a feat which Pandit M. M.
Malaviya has scarcely been able to perform in the
course of twelve years.</p>
<p>The amounts contributed by the various province</p>
<p>314</p>
<p>LOKAMANYA TILAK</p>
<p>are given below. The largest contribution that of</p>
<p>Rs. 3,00,000 ^has been made by Mr. A. B. Godrej^</p>

<p>&quot; May his soul rest in peace !&quot; How poor, how un###real do these words strike to the ear ! The soul of the
Lokamanya will never rest in peace unless and until Swaraj
is established. It will be bom again and again, if need
be, in this holy land of the rishis until its high purpose
is accomplished.</p>
