  <meta property="og:description" content="To me it (i e. The Arctic Home in the Vedas) is significant because it appeared in the midst of the author’s direst persecution when money reputation, influence and everything were at stake, and few men would have had the courage to spare a thought either for sacred books or Arctic Circles.
H. W. Nevinson.
The scholar in politics is either a remarkable failure or an extraordinary success. In the scholar’s temperament, hesitency, lack of strong will-power, im###patience and petulance usually form the chief mgrcdi###ents. His knowledge of men is limited ; his grasp of actualities is imperfect. He has no resourcefulness, very little courage or presence of mind. His personality is weak and he is very rarely a ruler of men. The failure as an administrator of M. Guizot, the celebrated philosopher-historian is a striking illustration of the danger of appointing men of letters at the helm of affairs. Mr. Tilak however was primarily a man of action. His wonderful and luminous scholarship and his versatile and comprehensive genius formed merely the back-ground of a strong-willed, fiery, masterful, soldierly personality. His scholarship illuminated his political leadership with a lustre as rare as it was dazzling ; his political leadership gave his scholarly work a prestige and a significance totally absent in the efforts of mere scholars. If a scholar in politics is a rarity, a scholar-politician finding his way to gaol is still more so; and that, such a man should have lifted his thoughts from the chilling atmosphere of gaol-life and the excru###ciating pain which inevitably attends it, up to the re###gions of ethics and philosophy is, verily a wonder of wonders !">

  <blockquote>
<p>To me it (i e. The Arctic Home in the Vedas) is significant
because it appeared in the midst of the author&rsquo;s direst persecution when money reputation, influence and everything were at stake, and few men would have had the courage to spare
a thought either for sacred books or Arctic Circles.</p>
<p>H. W. Nevinson.</p></blockquote>
<p>The scholar in politics is either a remarkable failure or an extraordinary success. In the scholar&rsquo;s
temperament, hesitency, lack of strong will-power, im###patience and petulance usually form the chief mgrcdi###ents. His knowledge of men is limited ; his grasp of
actualities is imperfect. He has no resourcefulness,
very little courage or presence of mind. His personality is weak and he is very rarely a ruler of men. The
failure as an administrator of M. Guizot, the celebrated
philosopher-historian is a striking illustration of the
danger of appointing men of letters at the helm of
affairs. Mr. Tilak however was primarily a man of
action. His wonderful and luminous scholarship and
his versatile and comprehensive genius formed merely
the back-ground of a strong-willed, fiery, masterful,
soldierly personality. His scholarship illuminated his
political leadership with a lustre as rare as it was dazzling ; his political leadership gave his scholarly work
a prestige and a significance totally absent in the efforts
of mere scholars. If a scholar in politics is a rarity, a
scholar-politician finding his way to gaol is still more so;
and that, such a man should have lifted his thoughts
from the chilling atmosphere of gaol-life and the excru###ciating pain which inevitably attends it, up to the re###gions of ethics and philosophy is, verily a wonder of
wonders !</p>
<p>But this was not the only wonder. Mr. Tilak&rsquo;s every###day life was hardly more favourable to literary pur###suits than his gaol-life. It was a life of storm and
stress. It is really surprizing that the din of political
controversies enabled him to concentrate his mind on
patient and laborious research. His first work, the
Orion was planned and written in the midst of Social
Reform controversies, the legacy of whose acrimony
still abides ; the Arctic Home in the Vedas was com###pleted and published when Mr. Tilak was in the throes
of a prosecution which was probably intended to strike
at the very basis of his political and social position.
It is this peace in the midst of storms and this serenity
amid misery and obloquy that proves Mr. Tilak&rsquo;s &quot; title
to something far higher and greater than the honour of
mere political leadership &quot; or scholarly \visdom. In
him we recognize &lsquo;* the stuff of which the saints and
seers of the race are made.&quot;</p>
<p>Originality and versatility were the characteristics of
Mr. Tilak&rsquo;s genius. Though he planned writing many
books, he actually wrote only three — (i) the Orion
(English) (2) the Arctic Home in the Vedas, (English)
and (3) The Gila-RaJiasya (Marathi). The theme of each
is new and arresting. The Orion takes the antiquity of
the Vedas back to 6000 B.C., a claim which Western</p>
<p>336 LOKAMANYA TILAK</p>
<p>scholars have at last grudgingly accepted. The Arctic
Home proves that the cradle of the Aryans was not the
Caucasus mountain, but the effulgent region of the North
Pole. Both these volumes have suggested new view###points and have compelled Sanskritists to revise their
estimates regarding the early history of the Aryan
race. Mr. Tilak&rsquo;s commentary on the Gita esta###blishes a new and convincing theory of Karma-yoga,
These books are not mere compilations. They strike
out a novel line of thought and research. The intellect
of Gokhale and Telang was merely assimilative ;
that of Tilak and Ranade was original and creative.
In the Arctic Home, for instance, Mr. Tilak has given
quite new and extremely convincing interpretations of
nearly 80 verses in the Rig-veda, besides throwing ample
light on more than twice the number. It should be
remembered that these verses had baffled students of
the Vedas from Sayana of the hoary past to the most
recent Sanskrit scholar of Europe or America. Nor
was this all. The Vedic Mythology, hitherto explained
from Yaska downwards on the Storm or Dawn theory,
had presented several knotty problems to the end of
the last century and it was reserved for Mr. Tilak to
establish the theory of &quot; cosmic circulation of serial
waters &quot; by means of which the legends of Indra and
Vritra, of Saptavadhri, of Aditi and her seven flourish###ing and one still born son, of Surya&rsquo;s wheel and of
Dirghatamas, became fully intelligible. These studies
filled his mind with a thousand and one new and inter###esting ideas regarding the evolution of the Hindu
Religion and Philosophy. He was eager to develop
these ideas and incorporate them in two or three</p>
<p>TILAK THE SCHOLAR 337</p>
<p>volumes, but he had no hope of being able to do so, un###less, as he humourously said &quot; Government was pleased
to send him back to Mandalay for another period of
six years. &quot;</p>
<p>Even the perfunctory and casual account he has given
in the Arctic Home and the Gita-Rahasya, of the progress
of the ancient Aryans in culture, shows that he was
gifted with an imagination of a very high order ; Mr.
Tilak&rsquo;s imagination was rather the solid, strong and
masculine imagination of a scientist or a philosopher
than the poet&rsquo;s which like &quot; a beautiful and ineffectual
angel &quot; beats &quot; in the void, his luminous wings.&quot; His
short but suggestive article on the &quot; Indian and the
Chaldean Vedas &quot; strikes out a new line of investigation
not only in comparative philology but in the history
of ancient Asia as well. In this article, Mr. Tilak
starts with a quotation from the Atharva-Veda wherein
he finds several words that look unsanskrit in origin,
traces them to the Chaldean Vedas and then gives his
arguments regarding inter-communication between India
and Chaldea.</p>
<p>Mr. Tilak&rsquo;s genius was at once comprehensive and
subtle. &lsquo;* In one swift gyre &quot; it surveyed the whole
extent of the subject in hand ; at the same time there
was nothing too minute for its ken. He developed
argument after argument, built up theory after theory,
with the same enjojmient with which he descended to the
exhaustive discussion of the grammatical and philological
peculiarities of a word ; after surveying with his intel###lectual teleoscope the rise and progress of philosophical
thoughts and systems, he did not disdain with micros###copic minuteness to trace a missing verse from a refer###22S</p>
<p>338 LOKAMANYA TILAK</p>
<p>ence book {e. g. Sankhya-Karikas) or fix the Sanskrit
definition of Hindu Epics. This subtlety of intellect
enabled him to emend and correctly interpret all the
verses of that knotty little book — the Vedanga-Jyotish.</p>
<p>The clarity of his ideas and the rapidity with which
he transmitted them to paper were really wonderful.
The Arctic Home contains references to nearly 500
learned volumes, and the Gita-Rahasya to nearly twice
that number. He spent days, months and years in
collecting and analyzing materials for his treatises.
But once the materials were fully digested and the
skeleton-notes prepared, he took very little time to write
or dictate the book. Thus he worked at the Orion for
nearly four years, at the Arctic Home for nearly nine,
and at the Gita-Rahasya for more than twenty years.
But the time he actually took to write these books was
incredibly small. The Orion was finished in less than
one month and the Arctic Home (about 450 Pages) in
about two months. His magnum opus, t^e Gita&quot;
Rahasya required only five months. It was written
in the winter of 1910-11 at Mandalay.</p>
<p>The Mahabharat (and especially the Gita) and the
Rig&rsquo;veda were Mr. Tilak&rsquo;s favourite books. While read###ing the Gita in 1889, it occurred to hun &quot; that impor###tant conclusions may be deduced from the statement of
Krishna that &rsquo; he was Margashirsha of the months&rsquo;.&quot;
This led him to inquire into the primitive Vedic Calen###dar and in 1892 Mr. Tilak sent an essay on this subject
to the Ninth Oriental Congress held in London and in
the next year (1893) he published in book-form the re###sults of his four years&rsquo; researches. In this book, Mr. Tilak
abandoned the purely linguistic method of research of</p>
<p>TILAK THE SCHOLAR 339</p>
<p>the Western scholars and adopted the astronomical one
about the utility of which those scholars were rather
doubtful. The book created a sensation and though it
was at first perused with scepticism, still subsequently
Max Mullec Weber Jacobi and other Sanskritists had
to accept Mr. Tilak&rsquo;s conclusions and re-adjust their own
in the light of Mr. Tilak&rsquo;s investigations. Dr. Bloom###field the celebrated Professor of Sanskrit, at the John
Hopkin&rsquo;s University referring to the Orion said (1894): —
&quot; But a literary event of even greater importance
has happened within the last two or three months — an
event which is certain to stir the world of science and
culture far more than the beatific reminiscences. Some
twelve weeks ago, I received from India a small duo###decimo volume, in the clumsy get-up and faulty typo###graphy of the native Anglo-Indian Press. It came
with the regards of the author, a person totally unknown
to fame. I had never heard his name. * * *. It wiU
be understood that the entry of the little volume upon
my horizon was not such as to prejudice me in its favour,
and secondly, I placed it where it might be reached,
without too much effort, in the drowsy after-dinner
hour, to be disposed of, along with much second-class
matter such as reaches a scholar through the channels
of the Postal Union. Nor was the preface ai all en###couraging. The author blandly informs us that the
age of the Rigveda, cannot be less than 4000 years before
Christ and that the express records of the Hindu anti###quity point back to 6000 before Christ. Having in
mind the boundless fancy of the Hindu through the
ages and his particularly fatal facility for * taking his
mouthful &rsquo; when it comes to a question of numbers.</p>
<p>340 LOKAMANYA TILAK</p>
<p>proposed to myself to continue to turn the leaves of
the book with the amused smile of orthodoxy befitting
the occassion. But soon the amused smile gave way
to an uneasy sense that something unusual had hap###pened. I was first impressed with something leonine in
the way in which the author controlled the Vedic lite###rature and the occidental works on the same ; my su###perficial reading was soon replaced by absorbed study,
and finally, having been prepared to scoff mildly, I con###fess that the author had convinced me in all the essen###tial points. The book is unquestionably the literary sen###sation of the year ; history, the chronic readjuster shall
have her hands uncommonly full to assimilate the result
of Tilak&rsquo;s discovery and arrange her paraphernalia in
the new perspective.&quot;</p>
<p>After the publication of the Orion, Mr. Tilak carried
on correspondence with Prof. Max Muller on various
philological and astronomical points. Like some chro###nic fever, the subject pursued him, despite the claims
which political work had upon his time and energy.
The years 1895-97 were, indeed, some of the busiest
years of his life ; but all the same, Vedic chronology
formed a strong undercurrent of his thoughts. This
was a peculiarity with Mr. Tilak. Frequently he could
so withdraw his mind from work, that only the lighter
moods occupied him. But when a subject &lsquo;possessed&rsquo;
him, it gave him no rest, it tormentated him even in
his sleep. Before such a powerful concentration it was###no wonder that Saraswati yielded the keys of her
treasures. Throughout the busy years of the Poona
Congress, the Famine, the Plague, the Councillorship
and the Press-prosecutions in the Bombay Presidency^</p>
<p>TILAK THE SCHOLAR 34I</p>
<p>the little leisure he could snatch was given to Vedic
•studies. In 1897, he was sentenced to rigorous impri###sonment ; and what time he could get in the Yeravda
Jail, was devoted to the continuation of his Vedic re###searches. The first manuscript of the Arctic Home
was written at the end of 1898, but Mr. Tilak hesitated
to publish the book for a long time &quot; because the hues
of investigation had ramified into many allied sciences
&ldquo;Such as geology, archaeology, comparative mythology
and so on &quot; and as Mr. Tilak thought himself to be a
layman in these, he felt some diffidence as to whether
he had &quot; correctly grasped the bearings of the latest re###searches in these siences.&rdquo; Unable in India to find a
University atmosphere where one could get all up-to###date information on any desired subject, the only course
open for Mr. Tilak was, in the words of Prof. Max Muller
&lsquo;* to step boldly out of his own domain and take an in###dependent survey &quot; of the aUied sciences like Geology,
€ven at the risk of being called &quot; an interloper, an
ignoramus, a mere dilettante.&quot; After completely satis###fying himself on all the different points, Mr. Tilak
published the book (1903) which was more favourably
received by Western scholars than the Orion.</p>
<p>Like the early editorial writing of Mr. Tilak, the
Orion was written in what may be called the scholar&rsquo;s
style. But the Arctic Home is a book which even the
lay reader can peruse with enjoyment. The style is
smooth, flowing, and extremely lucid, occasionally
rising to the heights of philosophical eloquence. The
treatment is at once interesting and methodical. After
stating the problem in brief, Mr. Tilak treats of the
Glacial Period and prores from geological evidence of</p>
<p>342 LOKAMANYA TILAK</p>
<p>fossil, fauna and flora that &quot; in the early geological
ages, when the Alps were low and the Himalayas not
yet upheaved, and when Asia and Africa were repre###sented only by a group of islands, * * * an equable
and uniform climate prevailed over the whole surface
of the globe as a result of these geographical conditions.&quot;
Mr. Tilak then describes the Polar and circumpolar cha*
racteristics. The former are : (i) the sun rises in the
South (2) the stars do not rise and set but revolve in
horizontal planes (3) the year consists only of one long
day and one long night of six months each (4) the sun
rises and sets only once a year but the twilight, whether
of the morning or of the evening lasts continuously for
about two mo7iths. The circum-polar characteristics
are (i) The sun will always be to the South of the zenith
of the observer. (2) A large number of stars are above
the horizon, during the entire period of their revolu###tion and hence, always visible. (3) The year is made
up of three parts (a) one long continuous night ; (b) one
long continuous day (c) a succession of ordinary days
and nights. (4) The dawn, at the close of the long
continuous night lasts for several days. Mr. Tilak;
says &quot; if a Vedic description or tradition discloses any
of the characteristics mentioned above, we may safely
infer that th6 tradition is polar or circum-polar in origin
and the phenomenon, if not actually witnessed by the
poet, was at least known to him by tradition faithfully
handed down from generation to generation.&quot; Mr.
Tilak then quotes many such passages and traditions
and proves the existence of the Arctic Home. He sup###ports his conclusions by studies in comparative mytho###logy and by quotations from the Avesta &ldquo;which express</p>
<p>TILAK THE SCHOLAR 343</p>
<p>ly tell us that the happy land of Airy ay a Vaejo or the
Aryan Paradise, was located in a region where the sun
shone but once a year, and that it was destroyed by the
invasion of snow and ice, which rendered its climate
inclement.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here is an Anglo-Indian estimate of Mr. Tilak&rsquo;s book.
Prof. Fraser, editor of the Indian Education thus writes
about the Arctic Home in the Vedas : —</p>
<p>** We regret we cannot enter into a critical review
of this book ; but we gladly assist to make it
known and pay a short tribute to the clear style
in which it is written throughout. All readers
will appreciate this; Indian students not least. It
is well and carefuUy printed and presented in an
attractive cover. Unfortunately^ the binding is
very weak and this a great pity in the case of a
book which has a permanent value. It is fast###ened with wire instead of being sewn ; this is a
feeble sort of binding in any case. In India, the
wire soon rusts and this causes the paper to rot
and leaves to become loose.&quot;
Apparently the Une of Addison&rsquo;s Tom Folio is not
yet extinct !</p>
<p>In the course of his Vedic studies Mr. Tilak found
that, in spite of the valuable initial help, which the
commentators give, it is on the whole better to carry
research work in ancient hterature, unfettered by the
occasionally wrong lead given by the so-called authori###ties. It was only when Mr. Tilak rejected Sayana on one
hand, and Prof. Max Muller on the other that he could
make valuable contribution to the interpretation of the
Vedas, He tried the same method with the Gita. Hq</p>
<p>344 LOKAMANYA TILAK</p>
<p>was first introduced to this book during his father&rsquo;s
last illness ; at that time Mr. Tilak was barely i6. In
the stillness of evening, he would sit by the lamp-side
and read out to his father the Gita and its Marathi
commentary. The sublime melody of the Gita charmed
him and since then he was a devoted student of the
Lord&rsquo;s Song. But, almost from the time of his first
perusal of the book, a doubt haunted his mind. The
great Shankaracharya has pronounced the Gita to have
preached Jnyana, unqualified by Karman. Can it be
so ? If yes, how are we to reconcile the fact that
Arjuna was moved, by the Lord&rsquo;s Message, to do that
Karman, which had repelled him ? The commenta###tors are silent. Indeed, most of them entirely neglect
the first chapter and start their commentaries from the
nth verse of chapter second. Wearied by the wrong
lead given by the commentators, Mr. Tilak read the
original repeatedly without the aid of any commentary,
till at last, be found that the Gita, far from being a book
of cold philosophy, was a guide for every day life, a
master-piece on Karmayoga Shastra. The more
did he discuss this subject with contemporary
scholars, the more was he convinced of the strength
of his contention, until at last he determined to
give his researches out to the public. But that
was not an easy matter. The anti-Partition agita###tion made Mr. Tilak the leader of All-India Party »
and all his time was swallowed up by Politics###He had given up the attempt as hopeless and when
in July 1908, he was sentenced to six years&rsquo; trans###portation, even the last lingering chance was
apparently lost, for no-body ever expected him to</p>
<p>TILAK THE SCHOLAR 345</p>
<p>■survive the dreary period. But the subsequent com###mutation of his sentence to one of simple imprisonment
together with the Hterary facihties afforded, en###abled him to undertake the enterprise and within less
than twenty months after he was &quot; well settled &quot; at
Mandalay, he wrote in a letter as follows : —</p>
<p>&quot; About the Gita, I have finished what I call Gita
Rahasya, an independent and original book investiga###ting the purpose of the Gita and showing how our reli###gious philosophy is applied therein to solution of the
ethical problem. For, my view of the Gita is, that
it is a work on Ethics — not Utilitarian, nor intuitional
but transcendental, somewhat on the lines followed in
the Green&rsquo;s &rsquo; Prolegomena to Ethics .&rsquo; I have com###pared, throughout, the Gita-philosophy with the West###em, both religious and ethical and have tried to show
that our system is, to say the least, not inferior to any
of the Western methods. This Rahasya is made up
of 15 chapters with an appendix devoted to a critical
examination of the ,Gita as part of the Mahabharat
and discussing its age etc. * * * j^ ^ill i think
fill about 300 or 350 pages. To this a translation of
the Gita, according to my view of it, is yet to be
appended and I am now engaged on this
translation, which, by the bye, is a light task. * * *
I believe it will be found to be an entirely
-original book like the &quot; Orion &ldquo;; for so far as
I am aware, no one has ventured on such a path
before in translating or commenting on the Gita,
though I have had this view of the Gita in mind
for about the last twenty years and more. I
have used all the books that I have here with me</p>
<p>346 LOKAMANYA TILAK</p>
<p>but there are references to works, not with me
here, and as these are quoted from memory, they will
have to be verified before publishing the book * * *
Kant&rsquo;s &rsquo; Critique of Pure Reason &rsquo; and * Green&rsquo;s Prole###gomena to Ethics &rsquo; are the main English authorities for
my book which is based on the Brahmasutras (Shankara###charya&rsquo;s Bhashya) and the Mahabharat * * * and
it treats in brief, the Hindu Philosophy of active life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The book — a ponderous volume of 854 closely-print###ed pages — was, published (1915) a few months after
Mr. Tilak was set free. The first edition — 6000 copies —
was sold off within a week. The second and third edi###tions were also soon exhausted. The book has been
translated into Gujarati, Hindi and Kanarese and Mr.
Tilak proposed to get it rendered into Bengali, Telgu,
Tamil and other leading vernaculars of India. It was
his intention to give out his researches to the Western
countries but as that was a work which could not con###veniently be left to mere translators, Mr. Tilak intend###ed to do it himself.</p>
<p>But that was not to be ; nor was this the only
literary project he left unfinished. With life and
leisure, he would have brought out treatises on
(i) The Differential and Integral Calculas (2) The
Hindu Law (3) and Politics. Regarding (i) he had
collected all the necessary materials and digested
them. A few months&rsquo; leisure and the book would
have been ready. The same remark holds good
about his intended book on Politics. His sudden
death was a loss not only to the PoUtical but
also to the Literary World. Even Mr. Tilak&rsquo;s
opponents will admit that during its life, the University</p>
<p>TILAK THE SCHOLAR 34/</p>
<p>of Bombay has not produced a more versatile or
original genius. Its semi-official character may not
have enabled it to honour itself by honouring Mr.
Tilak. India, however, gratefully recognises that the
literary recreation of Mr. Tilak has accomplished far
brighter and more enduring results than the works of
many a professional Sanskritist.</p>
