Meaning of Raja 

Many Lord-Tier (in European sensibility) Hindu Rulers used the title Raja.  
Its use has been mocked by many neech quibblers.  
Raja IS equated to the European Rex-King but note that it does NOT precisely mean that in Hindu Context.

## purANa-s
Our Shastras provide context.

> प्रजासु च **विरक्तासु**  
राज्यकामदुघासु वै ।
कृच्छ्रेणोपार्जितो **ऽपार्थो**  
राजशब्दो **भविष्यति** ॥

> Bereft of the attachment of the subjects (their presence as a key factor), the title Raja (thus in context, Delighter of Subjects) acquired with very great difficulty, shall become meaningless.

> प्रजानां रंजनाद् राजा  
येयं रूढिर् उपार्जिता ।
तस्यां रूढ्यां प्रनष्टायां  
राज्यमेव विनंक्ष्यति ॥

> A King is called Rājā as he makes the people delighted.
This is the conventional meaning acquired (by the word) and if that convention gets spoilt & lost, his very kingdom shall perish.

These 2 verses of Skanda Purana show that Raja is to be interpreted NOT merely as a land administrator but also a CELEBRITY.  
They infuse features like aesthetics, higher goals, ethos, etc. in otherwise detached plebeian masses.

Appreciated for wealth, & famous for being famous.

In Pauranik presentation of Sun as King in same Skanda Purana this is related -

> राजृ दीप्तौ स्मृतो धातू  
राजा राजति यः सदा ।
अधिकं सर्वभूतेभ्यस्  
तस्माद्राजा स उच्यते ॥

> It is again very clearly about aura, visuals, vibes, status, however one chooses to interpret in context.

That is why every single landholder was honoured with designation of Rajashri in Maratha letters.

Someone well regarded as being a Government stakeholder is also additionally designated Rajamanya.

These were not limited or pointless. Even Saints heading Ashramas held the title. There is further support in Purana Lore of Prithu as bearer of the title.

Ritual Status AND Public Consensus -

> महता राजराज्येन  
पृथुर्वेण्यः प्रतापवान् ।
सोऽभिषिक्तो महातेजा  
विधिवद् धर्म-कोविदैः ॥
पित्रा परञ्-जितास् तस्य  
प्रजास् तेनानुरञ्जिताः ।
अनुरागात ततस् तस्य  
नाम राजेत्यजायत ॥

> "The mighty Prithu, son of Vena, being thus invested in his dominion by priests soon removed grievances of people oppressed by his father, *and from winning their affections he derived the title of Raja.*

> अनुरागात ततस्तस्य नाम राजेत्यजायत ॥

Celebrityhood THROUGH leadership.

The Mahabharata relates the same but in more precise terms:

> पृथुं वैन्यं प्रजा दृष्ट्वा  
रक्ताः स्मेति यद् अब्रुवन् ।
ततो राजेति नामास्य  
अनुरागादजायत ॥

> Raja is formed of *attachment* or public legitimacy due to service of a family towards welfare of their subjects.

CELEBRITYHOOD.

## prAkRt texts
This isn't only in Sanskrit Hindu scriptures but carried over in Prakrit Buddhist texts like Maha Buddha Vansha appropriating Manu as a Bodhisattva with 3 epithets -

> "As he endeared himself to the people by observing upright kingly duties towards them, he won the third: Rājā."

Final assertion on this note is sanskritized form of -Rao titles as Rajas in Sanskrit biographies show there were multiple kings in Maharashtra & it was never considered a big deal.

Haibatrao (Haibatraja), Rautrao (Ravutaraja), Pratap (Prataparaja), Hambirrao (Hambirraja), etc.

## Divine representatives
To legitimize rule in small but defensible territory, many Kings ruled as custodians of Gods who were "real" Rajas.

Like Ekalingeshwar of Meda Pataka, Raireshwar of Rohida, Mahabaleshwar of Jayavalli, etc.

On any invasion, these chiefs would invoke religion for the "True King". 

If you have any territory, a seat (Masnad), flag, scepter, a sizeable family, you could claim "Raja-hood".

Simhasana, Chattra, Aftabgir (Sun shade), Morchal (Peacock-Feather whisk), Chavar (fly whisk), Nagada Naubat (royal drums), were more traditional elaborate paraphernalia.

## Mogol use
After Fall of Raigad, when 3 "sons" (1 legitimate, 2 doubtful) of Chattrapati Sambhaji Maharaj entered Mughal camp, ALL 3 were instantly bestowed title of Raja, not just Prince Shahu!

Same Aurangzeb who had refused to recognize the mighty King Shivaji Maharaja for so many years!

In order to give weight to this Title, Deshmukhi of 3-4 zones was given to Prince Shahu (Shivaji Sambhaji Bhonsale) & it was enough for Aurangzeb to declare that Bhonsale State was NOT "destroyed" by him, but rather nurtured by him against Chattrapati Rajaram Maharaja's "rebels"!

## Rump state survival
2-Bigha Zamindar jibe for royals using "Raja", "Maharaja", should NOT be tolerated.

Great Empires' dynasties get reduced to Rump State but survived.

Bhonsales entered Rump State 3 times.

1. Post Defeat by Baridshahi
2. Post Capture of Raigad by Aurangzeb
3. Invasion of British

The Territorial Expanse argument by Pauranik idealism is most common form of polemics by lowly trolls.  
However in critical influential scriptures like Shukra Niti, Economic angle (actually making use of territory) is raised.

This is conveniently ignored!
