[[Rājakārya-prasakta Dewan Bahadur Sir M N Krishna Rao - part 1	Source: [prekshaa](https://www.prekshaa.in/m-n-krishna-rao-part-1)]]







According to one set of friends, the letters “M N” in M N Krishna Rao’s name stand for *Maḍi* \[orthodoxy, purity, conservatism, discipline, ritualism\] and *Niyama* \[rule, principle, order, justice\]. It hints at Krishna Rao’s nature. In all dealings and in all aspects – rules, estimation, conviction, and principle – this was Krishna Rao’s specialty.  
One morning, around nine, I was sitting at a friend’s house in Basavanagudi. Let’s call him V. Beside his house lived another friend M. Though the houses were separate, the front yard was one large undivided area without partition. Hence, words spoken in the front yard were clearly audible in both houses.  
My friend M, dressed and ready to leave for office, came into the front yard. At the same time, another friend R appeared at the gate. Then, the following conversation took place –  
M: Hello Ayyangari, you are coming now! Where had you been?  
R: I had been to M N Krishna Rao’s house. Thought of seeing you too, and came here.  
M: Why do you trouble that *brāhmaṇa*?  
R: You know, that note I have received, saying that I will retire in three months? I’d been there to see if something could be done about it.  
M: Go tell that wall! If there is no blemish in your record, he will not put a spanner in the works. But if there is, he will not suppress it even if your grandfather comes back. What business do you have with such a person who upholds justice at all costs?”  
I became curious upon hearing this. I came out and looked at both of them. All three of us laughed together.  
What M said was an indirect assessment.

### *Nyāya-dṛṣṭi* – A Vision of Justice

Krishna Rao would not do anything that was less than appropriate to the situation nor anything more. His argument was: being more than fair to one would entail being less than fair to another. As far as I know, no one was intimate with Krishna Rao. Everyone had a love-and-respect-mixed fear of him. Like Kālidāsa says in the *Śākuntala* – ‘*abhyakta-snātam-iva*’ \[one who has been anointed with oil and bathed\] – just as an unclean person would feel in the presence of one who is clean[^(^(\[1\]))](#sdfootnote1sym). Thanks to my *puṇya* \[good fortune\] from a previous birth, I had gained some of his affection.

### Acquaintance

M N Krishna Rao and I were first introduced in 1909–10. A person by name Yogīśvara had camped in a house in Basavanagudi at that time. It seems he hailed from Tirupati; he was apparently an expert in Āyurvedic medicine and *mantra-śāstra*. I don’t remember why I had gone there. When I went there Chief Engineer K Krishna Iyengar and M N Krishna Rao were sitting there, chatting. Since I already knew Krishna Iyengar, we started talking and some topic came up. I quoted a *śloka* casually that I recollected from the *Nīlakaṇṭha-vijaya-campū*. Krishna Iyengar knew Sanskrit very well. His elder brother was a great paṇḍita. Krishna Rao said, “Recite the *śloka* again.” Krishna Rao was also a Sanskrit scholar. He liked the *śloka* I recited. Thus began our acquaintance.  
Even before I met him in person, I was aware of his fame. Even at that time, I considered his acquaintance a great fortune. Thanks to divine blessing, that fortune remained till the end.

### Brothers

Krishna Rao hailed from the town of Mysore. His elder brother was the famous Sanskrit *vidvān* Prof. M Hiriyanna. Krishna Rao’s younger brother N Seetharamiah worked as Assistant Secretary in the Government and also as a Magistrate. All the three learnt Sanskrit in the traditional system from Periyaswami Tirumalacharya. All three were experts in the English language too. All three had spotless character. Fate had granted me the affection of all three gentlemen[^(^(\[2\]))](#sdfootnote2sym).

### My Delhi Sojourn

Around 1924, I had the opportunity to go to Delhi. Treaties and covenants between Princely States and the Government of India, common practices that have evolved with them, special provisions regarding the country’s defence, and financial arrangements – to gain an understanding on these matters was the purpose of my visit to Delhi.  
I came to know that N Seetharamiah was in Delhi at that time. What is the modus operandi of the Indian Legislature in Delhi? Who will prepare the first draft of the bill? What procedures will the bill go through? How will the bill move from being a draft to law? – to study these details, the Mysore Government had deputed two officers to Delhi. N Seetharamiah was one of them; the other was Abdul Ghani *saheb*, who later became a Judge of the High Court.  
Since Seetharamiah was already in Delhi, I felt I could take his help. But I did not know his address in Delhi. I went to M N Krishna Rao’s house one day to get the same. A servant there informed me, “*Saheb* has gone for a walk at Lal Bagh along with the boss who has come from Mysore.” I too went for a walk near *Lal Bagh* and went to Krishna Rao’s house around seven-thirty or eight in the evening. The servant said, “*Saheb* is probably at dinner.” I said, “It’s alright. No need to trouble him now. After he comes from dinner, mention to him this name” (and I gave him my name).  
I was living in Shankarapuram then. It was probably around nine at night. I had sat down for my dinner. Both Prof. Hiriyanna and M N Krishna Rao graced my house with their presence. There were no electric lights then in my house. A kerosene lamp was burning in my room. The brothers sat down there. I completed my dinner, greeted both of them with folded hands, and conveyed my purpose. Both were pleased. Krishna Rao gave Seetharamiah’s address – something like ‘Ibsetson Circle, Paharganj.’  
We were chatting for some time after this. I remember putting a query to Prof. Hiriyanna on the topic of the eternity of the *Veda*s according to opinions of the adherents of the *Pūrva-mīmāṃsā* school and also remember his answer. From the point of view of the spirit of the *Veda*s, the permanence can be accepted but from a literal sense it is not so easy to accept – this statement of his struck my mind as being extremely pertinent. Further elaboration has faded from my memory. This was forty-four to forty-five years ago.

### Seetharamiah’s Hospitality

In the next week or ten days, I reached Delhi. Seetharamiah was waiting at the train station by the time the train reached. I asked him, “How did you know of my arrival?”  
He said, “I got it somehow. You have arrived now, have you not?”  
“Why did you come?”  
He answered, “To escort you.”  
I said, “I was thinking of some other arrangement.”  
“Let the other arrangement be kept aside. Please accept this arrangement now.”  
This friendly banter went on for some time. Seetharamiah sheltered me as a guest for two to two and a half months. I raised the question of expenses a couple of times. He said, “Let all that get settled in Bangalore. I have been ordered. I have to follow it. And you have to please cooperate.”  
He silenced me thus. Those were the days that Seetharamiah and I spent very happily. We used to travel together. With Kālidāsa’s *Megha-sandeśa* book in hand, we went to Ujjayinī \[Ujjain\] and visited Mahākāla *devālaya* and the environs of the Śiprā river. We both went to Kurukshetra and bathed at the Pāṇḍava Lake. We visited Gītā-mandira. We had a *darśana* of *Bhagavān* Śiva at Sthāneśvara \[Thanesar\]. We also went to the Durgā shrine nearby. On the way, we recounted several poetic references, recited the verses and enjoyed discussing their poetic nuances. Seetharamiah’s knowledge of English literature was excellent, too.

### At the *Legislative Council*

In 1927, I was a member of the \[Mysore\] *Legislative Council*. Those were the early days of the Dewanship of Sir Mirza Ismail. M N Krishna Rao was the Finance Minister then. At that time, in one of my speeches, I raised objections, alleging that the management of the treasury of the Mysore State was far from satisfactory. I said that the government was spending a lot of money but it lacked an adequate administrative audit system that examines the expense immediately and puts a stop to unwanted expenditure.  
While I was speaking, Krishna Rao’s face assumed a serious mode. As soon as I sat down, he stood up and said: “It appears this member has no idea of reality. In the government’s present system, there are sufficient control measures to keep the expenses under check and for investigating them.” I did not react, for I believed Krishna Rao’s words to be absolutely honest.  
That evening, an envelope reached the place where I was staying, from the minister’s office. It contained many *hukum*s and orders issued by the government regarding financial expenditure. I read all of them and I was impressed. The next day, after the *Council* met, I greeted Krishna Rao and asked him, “What is the guarantee that the work is going on in accordance with those orders?” He replied, “That is a constitutional matter. The government can consider it.”

### Estimation of Worth

That afternoon, during the lunch break after the Council session, Sri H C Dasappa came to me and said, “Of all the people, why did you have to raise objections against that *brāhmaṇa*?”  
I asked, “Why are you so kind to that particular *brāhmaṇa*?”  
Dasappa replied, “He is the only real *brāhmaṇa* I have met. Hence, my reverence for him; don’t trouble him!”  
This is an illustration that competence and integrity earn respect on their own.

### The Position of Dewan

In 1932, when Mirza *saheb* went to London to attend the *Round Table Conference*, M N Krishna Rao was appointed the acting Dewan. This was only for a few months. During this time, when I was going for a walk one morning, Krishna Rao was walking toward me. I greeted him.  
Krishna Rao exclaimed, “Hello, it’s been a long time since I saw you!”  
I replied, “You are under work pressure now. If I come to meet you, your time will be wasted and you may be inconvenienced!”  
“Why do you think so?”  
“Councillor’s work and Dewan’s responsibilities – both are put together. The load may have gone up,” I said.  
“I don’t see any such thing!”  
“You may have had to go on circuit.”  
“Why circuit?”  
I said, “Well, to meet people to consider their petitions and enquire about their hardships.”  
“Should I travel to enquire? Is it not enough to solve those that come here?”  
I asked, “Won’t the daily load double then?”  
Krishna Rao replied, “Our government was not formed today. It has a foundation of a hundred years. Rules and regulations have naturally evolved. There are no defects in that part. To implement those laws, there are responsible officers who earn one thousand to one thousand five hundred rupees. If they don’t do their work, there is nothing the government can do. If they do, there is not much work for the government. A difficult question might crop up once in a month or once in two months. That is the only work for the minister. Our main job is to make sure that various officers of the government are doing their job and are following rules and regulations.”  
He gave this kind of elaboration. It was natural for him to feel that the minister’s work was simple. I can think of three reasons for this:

#### 1. Experience

He was experienced in managing all departments. He started his career in the government’s Finance Department. Being directly or indirectly related to the Finance Department, every government department comes to the attention of the Treasurer. This may have given the idea to Krishna Rao that the government’s work is not difficult.

#### 2. Intellect

Krishna Rao’s intelligence was naturally sharp. He would quickly and comprehensively grasp the depth, extent, and essence of any thought that came to his mind. His natural way of thinking was extremely methodical. What was difficult for others was effortless for him.

#### 3. Integrity

Above all was his honesty. He would completely listen to his conscience and not pay attention to any other urge or advice. He would not give heed to any scheme, trick, cunning, or complex plans. His thoughts were always straightforward; his mind travelled in a straight line.  
Krishna Rao was faithful to his duty and work. He remained unfazed by people’s bouquets or brickbats.

## Rājakārya-prasakta Dewan Bahadur Sir M N Krishna Rao - part 3
[[Rājakārya-prasakta Dewan Bahadur Sir M N Krishna Rao - part 3	Source: [prekshaa](https://www.prekshaa.in/m-n-krishna-rao-part-3)]]







During the early days when Krishna Rao became the Dewan, the British Resident wrote him a letter informing about his visit to see the Dewan and sought a suitable time.  
Krishna Rao, in response, wrote “I am happy that you desire to see me. Salutations. I am at my office every day from eleven to five.” His conduct with people was appropriate; an apt response, behaving in a manner that was natural and never crossing bounds. That was Krishna Rao’s way.

### Disposing Petitions

This was true even when people came with petitions. As soon as the clerk informed him about someone or a group of people having come to meet him, he would say: “Bring them in.” He would stand up to welcome them. Sitting down after they were seated, he would ask: “What is the matter?” The leader \[of the congregation\] would say, “Sir, we have come from Hoskote. We have been requesting repairs to the lake for a long time…” Immediately Krishna Rao would summon his clerk.  
“Muthukumaraswami, send for the Chief Engineer and fetch those files.”  
The Chief Engineer would come with the file within ten minutes. Krishna Rao would ask the Chief Engineer: “These people have come from Hoskote. What is the status of their lake’s repair?” The Chief Engineer would give some explanation. Krishna Rao would ask: “When is the last letter in your file dated?”  
The engineer’s face would betray signs of embarrassment.  
Krishna Rao said, “Alright. When will the work start? Are there any impediments?”  
“There is some delay from the Finance Department,” said the Chief Engineer.  
“Fine. I will look at that note and make a decision. Anything else?”  
“I will get the work started within a month.”  
“Fine. You see, people are facing difficulties.”  
The Chief Engineer would depart. Krishna Rao would turn to the visitors and say, “The work will start in a month. If it doesn’t happen, please write to me.”  
The visitors would begin, “Sir, it has become very difficult. There is no water to drink for people and animals…” Krishna Rao would say: “All that is known. Is it not? Is there anything else?” Even before the visitors’ reply, Krishna Rao’s revolving chair would turn towards his table. There was no scope for any more conversation.  
M N Krishna Rao was not a man for small talk. He would not waste time saying the same things and listening to the same things again and again.

### Dependence on Citizens

Some of the petitioners to M N Krishna Rao would suggest: “The government can possibly do this, probably do that.” On such occasions, Krishna Rao would repeatedly say the following: “It is true that from one point of view, the government is all powerful and all independent. But there is another perspective. That too is extremely important. From that point of view, there is no organization weaker than the government. There is nothing that is more dependent on others. There is a government only if people make it work; where will it be if people are away from it? The government is dependent on people.”  
In this way, Krishna Rao had brought harmony between the administration’s arrogance and the affection it should show to the citizens.

### Fiscal Policy

In matters of treasury management, Krishna Rao’s principles and morals were strict. While he was Superintendent of the Government Treasury, he and Sir M Visvesvaraya clashed several times. The disagreement was intense on issues such as reserves, deficit budget, audit of expenditure, and means of expenditure control. Hence, the pace of Visvesvaraya’s programs would be impeded.  
In one instance, Visvesvaraya wrote: “We have to now raise loans for developmental projects. These projects will be beneficial in the future. Is this not for the government?”  
On this, Krishna Rao made notes:

1\. “It may be beneficial or it may not; will the State not suffer then?”  
2. “The benefits that accrue after fifty or hundred years will be for people in the future. To create wealth for the future generations, is it right to place the burden on people living now?”

In fact, I have read many such markings in the same tone by Lakshminarasimha Rao and more so by S Shamanna.  
Although there were such differences of opinion between M N Krishna Rao and Visvesvaraya it never came in the way of mutual courtesy and respect. Until the end, Krishna Rao was extolling in many ways Visvesvaraya’s selflessness, integrity, and enthusiasm for the nation’s well-being. I have heard Krishna Rao say: “Visvesvaraya is a great man, fit to be maharṣi.”  
In summary, Krishna Rao’s desire was that financial administration has to run with care and rigour so that the State’s expenditure was minimized. He never let it slacken.

### Altered Perspective

A difference could be noticed after he moved up to the title of Councillor from Financial Secretary. He had to then assume responsibility for managing the factory at Bhadravati. One day, the head of accounts Sri — came to Krishna Rao.  
Krishna Rao said, “You have raised several objections!”  
Sri — replied, “All these objections are based on the objections you had raised earlier.”  
Krishna Rao smiled and said, “The situation has changed. Earlier I used to look after only the financial responsibility. That was the view of just one department. Now I have to look after the welfare of the factory. In this, views of several departments have to be integrated. Now, my perspective is of the whole State. The salt merchant has to say there is no substance in the world that can equal salt. But the cook has to consider salt, sugar, and spice.”

### Restoration of Iron and Steel Factory

It can be said that M N Krishna Rao was the one who saved the Bhadravati factory \[*Mysore Iron and Steel Works*\]. During its loss-making days, the state of the factory had gone so bad that it was being considered if the factory had to be shut down. Some had opined that unless steel is produced and steel products are produced, it would not become profitable. A committee was constituted to get to the bottom of this and make recommendations. The committee recommended that steel must be manufactured and that rolling mill and machinery expansion has to take place. There were some conditions for the government to accept this. The minister Mathan was not supportive.  
In this manner, after it became a controversial topic, Mirza *saheb* gave Krishna Rao the responsibility to resolve it. Krishna Rao called for a meeting of all people connected to the issue. Sir Charles Todhunter also attended the meeting. He was in opposition then. He came up with a lot of hurdles. Krishna Rao said, “Presently, Bhadravati may appear to be making a loss. But we should not forget that it is a national industry, a people-oriented enterprise. None of us aspire for war. But due to some misfortune, if war were to break out in Europe, then it is the Bhadravati factory that will become the means of saving the British Empire. In the future, one will realize that the present loss is negligible and the profit at that time of crisis is a hundred times this loss.”  
These strong words from Krishna Rao were effective. It is a feather in the cap for Krishna Rao that the Bhadravati factory’s administration was viewed with compassion and strengthened.

### Five-year Plan

After Krishna Rao retired from the Government of Mysore, at the time of announcement of the first Five-year Plan of the Indian Government, he wrote me a private letter and expressed his disagreement. “I have learnt from experience how wasteful expenditure takes place and how money gets drained when it dawns on the officers of different departments that more money is available for spending. How officers rush to spend the money available to their departments during the last two months of the government (financial) year, has to be watched – special supervision is needed during those two months. If more and more money is available, more and more wastage will take place and a variety of afflictions will hamper the administration.” This was the summary of his letter.

### Sense of Generosity

Though Krishna Rao’s external appearance was conservative, he had liberal feelings inside. I am reminded of one instance. A bill on the *Workmen’s Compensation Act* was before the *Legislative Council*. In factories, due to any wrongful act of the management, if a worker gets injured or dies, the injured person or his heir(s) should get some form of financial compensation – this was the gist of the bill. This bill came up for discussion in the select committee. Krishna Rao was the President of the committee. It is only right that the injured worker or the deceased worker’s wife and children are provided financial compensation. *But if he has a mistress or a concubine, and if that mistress has children, will they be eligible for a portion of the compensation or not?* – this question came up during the discussion. Navaratna Rama Rao and I had misgivings about what the President’s opinion would be. Understanding our intention, Krishna Rao himself clearly stated: “The compensation amount will be owed to all those who had the person’s love and affection.”

### Personal Qualities

Like his elder brother \[Prof. M Hiriyanna\], Krishna Rao too used to donate anonymously to those in need. He helped many people. He had vowed that none of these donations would come to light.  
*Circa* 1923, Prof. Bellave Venkatanaranappa, T S Venkannayya, and I went to seek contribution for a public cause. Within ten minutes of our visit, he wrote a cheque and said, “I’m aware of everything. Good work. Keep this for now. If you need more, please ask me.”  
An eloquent elaboration can be made about his manner of speaking. Whether it was English or Kannada, his voice was deep. Without giving way to mistakes or extremes, it was tempered with caution. His words were filled with gravitas; they were virile and certain. He would leave no room for any doubts.

### Erudition

Krishna Rao was a true scholar and a well-read person. He had made a critical study of tens of treatises. As a college student, he had studied with great reverence, the articles of Thomas Carlyle, a famous English author. Carlyle was a spiritual enquirer. He would not touch frivolous topics. He did not write for fun. He critically examined serious life questions from a serious viewpoint.

### Scholarship

Once I was searching around for a book of lectures delivered by a German historian named Heinrich von Treitschke and for Arthur Berridale Keith’s three-volume book *Responsible Government*. My friend M Venkatanaranappa mentioned that both works may be available at the Controller’s Library[^(^(\[1\]))](#sdfootnote1sym). I asked what is the connection between Treitschke, Keith, and financial accounts. He said, “M N Krishna Rao himself is the connection.”

\~

Within a month after he retired, I met M N Krishna Rao in a friend’s house. The friend casually spoke in appreciation of a few speeches made by Krishna Rao in some places when he was the Dewan. “Those speeches were related to literature and such topics. Even then, due to their profound thoughts and elocution appropriate to the context, they were endearing to all.”  
Hearing his friend say this, a smiling Krishna Rao said, “You see, this only shows that it is enough if a political person has skimmed the surface here and there, that he need not know anything in-depth. He knows everything, understands nothing. He has to say things that everyone already knows. He cannot get into any profound topic. If he keeps saying things that everyone agrees upon, he will become famous.”

### Discipline and Integrity

In matters of *ācāra*[^(^(\[2\]))](#sdfootnote2sym) and *vyavahāra*[^(^(\[3\]))](#sdfootnote3sym), Krishna Rao followed rules and regulations. I’ve seen him at many tea parties. He never touched any food when away from home.  
When the Legislative Assembly was in session, Mirza *saheb* routinely invited some people for afternoon refreshments. There were fruits too. In a friendly manner Mathan tried to persuade Krishna Rao by saying, “Why don’t you take this?” Krishna Rao simply said, “How does one take something that is not wanted?”

### Spirituality

Krishna Rao was spiritual. On the day he retired, newspapers went to him and requested for a ‘message.’ Krishna Rao said, “You keep on chanting Rāma, Kṛṣṇa, Govinda. This is the message I have received.”  
In reality he spent his last days studying the *Upaniṣad*s. Though his body was weak and he was afflicted by disease, mentally he was at peace.  
One day, in the middle of a conversation, quoting a sentence from the Śāṅkara-bhāṣya[^(^(\[4\]))](#sdfootnote4sym), he said, “The practice of *śama* \[serenity of mind\] and *dama* \[control of sense organs\] are the means (or tools) to *mokṣa* \[liberation\] for a *sādhaka* \[seeker\] but are the very traits of a *siddha* \[perfected being\].”  
He used to often quote passages from the *Kaṭhopaniṣad*[^(^(\[5\]))](#sdfootnote5sym).  
Krishna Rao experienced pain in his personal life. He had seen in his life situations that would agitate human hearts. And so, he had clarity about the value of worldly things. Renunciation and worldly compassion had grown together in him.  
His was a principled and chaste life.
