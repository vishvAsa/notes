  <blockquote>
<p>Sons of India ! Let your sadness <br>
Turn to gladness ; <br>
For the long night of your sorrow <br>
Now has passed ; a glorious morrow<br>
Dawns upon you. Day is shining<br>
Cease repining.</p>
<p>C, F, Andrews,</p></blockquote>
<p>IN the darkest hour of Mr. Tilak&rsquo;s life, when neither
friend nor foe expected him to survive six long years
^f transportation, the Hon. Mr. Gokhale could not forget
his old grievances against him. But Mr. Tilak was
nothing if not chivalrous, and on hearing the unexpect###ed news of Mr. Gokhale&rsquo;s death, (19th February 19 15)
he motored down to Poona from Sinhgad to do honour
to the great Moderate. The funeral oration delivered
by him on this occassion is intensely passionate. Mr;
Tilak said : —</p>
<p>&quot; This is not a time for cheers. This is a time for
shedding tears. This diamond of India, this jewel of
Maharashtra, this prince of workers is laid to eternal
rest on the funeral ground. Look at him and try to
emulate him. * * * Every one of you should place
his life as model to be imitated, and should try to fill
up the gap caused by his death ; and if you will do your
level best to emulate him in this way, he will feel glad
even in the next world/.</p>
<p>224 LOKAMANYA TILAK</p>
<p>In the Provincial Conference (May 1915) in moving the
resolution of condolence to Mr. Gokhale&rsquo;s family Mr.
Tilak described how he was partially responsible###for introducingMr. Gokhale into the field of public life.
This chivalry towards his political opponents has been
markedly displayed by him on several occassions and
it reflects great credit on Mr. Tilak, whose heart, stern
and unbending though it was in political warfare, always
responded to every note of affliction. In November
1915 died Sir P. M. Mehta mourned by Mr. Tilak and the
country at large.</p>
<p>Towards the British Empire, in its hour of danger,
he was equally chivalrous. We have already seen how,
immediately on the outbreak of the great War (1914)^
Mr. Tilak publicly declared his willingness to co-operate
with the Government. He suggested the raising of a
citizen army. But, though even the most Moderate lea###ders enthusiastically favoured the idea, the Bureaucrats
rejected the spontaneous offer of help frcm educated
India. Of course, we were all patted on the back for
the &quot; fine Imperialistic instinct,&quot; but in this life-and###death struggle with Germany, instead of availing them###selves of help from whatever quarter it came, the powers
that be confined the work of raising recruits only to
those classes who were devoid of all patriotic conscious###ness. Had the attention of Mr. Asquith&rsquo;s Government
been drawn to India&rsquo;s eagerness to fight for the Empire,
America&rsquo;s help would have been superflous and conscrip###tion in England would nor have been necesssary. It
was only when Mr. Lloyd George became Premier
(December 1916) that the Cabinet called upon the
Viceroy to make special efforts to raise recruits in India*</p>
<p>THE GREAT HOME-RULER 22$</p>
<p>The Premier even went out of his way and suggested
that an attempt must be made to catch the imagination
of Indians and to stimulate their enthusiasm. But
Lord Chelmsford himself lacked that precious quality
of imagination and his associates wanted rather to
damp than rouse the enthusiasm of the people. Had
a Round-table Conference of India&rsquo;s trusted leaders
been convened and the necessity of supplying strong
contingents been explained to them, a few lakhs of
young Indians would have at once joined the colours. It is,
indeed, pitiable to find that the officials did not display
even a fraction of that enthusiasm in raising citizen sol###diers which they did in collecting the war-loan. A Defence
India Force of 6,000 was advertised for ; 6,000 in thirty
crores of people ! ! The necessary Bill was passed. No
assurance was given with regard to Home Rule, no assur###ance with regard to commissioned ranks to the Volun###teers ! Still the enthusiasm of the people knew
no bounds. Mr. Tilak led the agitation at Poona and
Bombay by powerful speeches, calling upon the youth,
as they valued their country&rsquo;s freedom to suspend
studies for a year or two and vindicate the fair name
of their country. &quot; If age and grey hair are no disqualifica###tions, I am prepared to stand in the fighting line.&quot; said he I
But it was to no purpose. Eight hundred men at
Bombay volunteered themselves on the spot. It seemed
as if the Bureaucrats did not want the help. They
signalized their appeal for the &quot; Defence of India Force &quot;
by a resort to the notorious &quot; Defence of India Act.&quot;! ! A
few hours before Mr. Tilak&rsquo;s powerful appeal to the
young men, he was served with an order from the
Punjab Government prohibiting him from entering the
15</p>
<p>226 LOKAMANYA TILAK</p>
<p>Punjab ! Surely, this was &quot; Co-operation &quot; with a
vengeance ! The satrap of the Punjab led the way !
The Delhi Commissioner followed suit ; and wonder of
wonders , Mr. Tilak had not even dreamt of going
over to the Punjab or to Delhi. When the Premier
wanted an appeal which would fire the imagination of
the Indians, here was an appeal of a very different
sort. But this was only the beginning. The Press
Deputation that waited on the Viceroy returned cruelly
disappointed. The Press Act must still disfigure the
Statute Book. Instead of promising substantial con###cessions to the people, the Government deprecated
in strong langauge political agitation. Coercion was
threatened. The threat was soon carried out and Mrs.
Besant, the tall Poplar of Indian Politics was intern###ed. These were some of the measures intended to
persuade the Indians to become soldiers of the Empire !
It is no wonder that the movement of a citizen army,
thus ushered into existence soon collapsed.</p>
<p>But Mr. Tilak did not like that matters should rest
here. He wanted to carry the case right up to the
British Democracy and explain to it the state of things
in India. He knew that if he could only convince the
British public that the military resources of India were
abundant and could well be availed of for the speedy
termination of the War, not only would India get the
military training denied to her these hundred years and
more, but the solution of the Politicial problem also
would be prompt and liberal. He tried his best to
finduce the Congress to send a Deputation to England^
When, at last that hope was gone, he led the Home
Rule League Deputation. As fates would have it, the</p>
<p>THE GREAT HOME-RULER 22/</p>
<p>War Cabinet refused to allow the Deputation to sail at
the last moment. In vain did Mr. Tilak appeal. Evi###&lsquo;dently the reactionary element in the Cabinet was
powerful and Mr. Tilak had to rest content with a cable
to the Premier suggesting that India could supply five
to ten millions of men, if our youths were made to feel
that they were not fighting to establish a principle
abroad which was not applied to them in own mother###land.</p>
<p>At the Delhi War Conference (April 1918) Mr. Tilak
was not even invited ; at the Bombay War Conference
(June 1918), though invited and asked to speak he was
not allowed to continue, but had to stop after speaking
only for a couple of minutes. Mr. Tilak wanted to
show how recruiting could be made popular ; but
as the Government had their own ideas in the
matter, the Home Rulers were invited to the
Conference only to hear an ill-advised homily deli###vered to them by His Excellency the Governor (Lord
Willingdon).</p>
<p>It will be thus seen that Mr. Tilak strenuously at###tempted to help the Government in their hour of need
and trial; but his well-meant efforts met only with fail###ure and even rebuffs. But the irony of it all was that
though Mr. Tilak had made attempts, which the blun###dering Bureaucracy frustrated, to encourager recruiting
he was (August 1918) served with an order prohibiting
him from lecturing without the previous permission
of the District Magistrate ; and what was the reason ?
Mr. Tilak, presiding at the annual Shivaji Festival
{22nd June 1918) spoke in a way &quot; calculated to dis###courage recruiting.&quot; Only a week before, Mr. Tilak had.</p>
<p>228 LOKAMANYA TILAK</p>
<p>publicly undertaken to enlist 5,000 recruits within six
months on receiving an assurance that the highest
military career without distinction of caste, creed or
colour would be thrown open to the recruits ; and as
guarantee of good faith, he had sent to Mahatma Gandhi
a Deposit Receipt for Rs. 50,000 the amount to be forfeited
as penalty if certain conditions were not fulfilled. Com###ment is superflous on these two pictures — Mr. Tilak
pledging his word and money in support of recruiting
and the Government of Bombay accusing him of &quot; dis###couraging recruiting.&quot;</p>
<p>Though Mr. Tilak was prepared to help the Govern###ment in every way to wage the war with success, he
was not wilhng to shelve the all-important question of
Home Rule. To those of the Bureaucrats who wanted
Indians not to press contentious questions upon their
attention, Mr, Tilak explained that Liberty is and ought
to be always a non-contentious topic. It was absolu###tely impossible, he said, for India to watch with folded
arms the stupendous conflict in Europe between Auto###cracy and Democracy. A vast intellectual revolution had
been brought about in India as a result of the World-war,
The moral, intellectual and political outlook of even the
most ignorant villagers had widened. Even they had
begun to take interest in the politics of their own country
and that of the world at large. The declarations of respon###sible ministers, interpreting this world-war as a war of
Liberty had considerably helped the national awaken###ing ; and under these circumstances, it was impossible
for Indians to keep quiet. Lord Willingdon had led the
way by asking Mr. Gokhale to make a statement of
post-war reforms. It was, therefore, in the interests</p>
<p>THE GREAT HOME-RULER 229</p>
<p>-of India and England alike, that this long-delayed set###tlement should be made.</p>
<p>During 1915 and 1916, Mr. Tilak worked assiduously
to organize his party. A strong party needs (i) a magnetic
leadership (2) a rallying point, and, (3) a war-cry. In
the personality of Mr. Tilak that first essential was found.
The National Congress would have been an ideal rally###ing point. But it was still in its inglorious and suicidal
isolation. The attempted compromise had failed (1914).
Mr. Tilak, therefore, decided to hold a Session of the Pro###vincial Conference, the machinery of which was still ia
the hands of the Nationalist Party. Under the able presi###dentship of Mr. Joseph Baptista, the Nationalists, more
than 1,000 in number met at Poona ; and this excep###tionally large number of delegates, together with the
enthusiasm which marked the proceedings conclusively
proved that the party was still powerful and had a
bright future before it. This conhdence was increased
by the Moderate Conference, which was held a couple
of months later and which, totally lacking in good at###tendence and enthusiasm, could seek consolation only
in the fact that Lord Willingdon had kindly paid it a
visit. The Belgaum Provincial Conference (1916), as
successful as the Poona one, strengthened the Nation###alist in the belief that the future was in their hands.
The success of the Poona and Belgaum Conferences
nerved the Nationalists to join the Congress even
though the concessions to their sentiments and self###respect were tardy and halting.</p>
<p>It was this Poona Conference which gave the Nation###alists, the necessary war-cry — Home Rule. When the
Moderates were busy only with the preparations of</p>
<p>^30 LOKAMANYA TILAK</p>
<p>schemes of political reform, Mr. Tilak gave his country*
men something more inspiring. Ever since his returm###from prison he had fixed his heart on a tremendous
agitation in favour of Home Rule ; knowing that the
Bureaucracy would question the legality of the move###ment with the object of resorting to repression, he in###tended to introduce a Bill in Parliament through the
good cfiices of Labour leaders and then concentrate all
his activities on a vast propaganda. The sudden ad###vent of the war came to his rescue. The Bureaucracy
with their armoury full of repressive legislation had to
keep quiet and bide their time. With the Indian army
sent away to France, repression was out of the question;
and so the Nationalists got the necessary respite to###mobilize their forces and they were not slow to take full
advantage of this opportunity.</p>
<p>During these days Mr. Tilak&rsquo;s dealings with the two
other parties were unexceptionable. Conscious of the grow###ing virilitj^ of the Naticnalists, he could afford, especially
in the larger interests of the country to be generous m&gt;
bis dealings with the Moderates. Mrs. Besant too, in
spite of occasicnal lapses was on the path of ccmplete
alliance wilh him. the felt that she was regarded as
an interloper by the leading Modeiales and was feared
and distiusted by them. Mr. Tilak&rsquo;s vision was so
much f cssessed with the future and its immense possi###bilities that he was in no meed to keep open the old
sores. He tried to placate the Moderates and did his
best to induce them to co-operate with him. The reso###lutions of the Pcona and Belgaum Conferences were
drawn up with a &lsquo;skill that silenced the ultra-Modera###tes ; and lor the sake of unity, Mr. Tilak defered his.</p>
<p>THE GREAT HOME-RULERj 231</p>
<p>full programme of activities in connection with Home###Rule.</p>
<p>A notable instance of Mr. Tilak&rsquo;s desire for unity can
be seen in his hearty acceptance of the &quot; Reform Memo###randum &quot; of the nineteen elected members of the
Imperial Legislative Council (October 1916). Left to
himself, Mr. Tilak would have made more radical
demands and we know some of his Bengal followers did
actually make them. But Mr. Tilak wanted complete
unanimity ; and so he was willing to take his stand on
the memorandum with its subsequent development, vix</p>
<p>— The Congress-League-Scheme.</p>
<p>The inauguration of the Indian Home Rule League
(23rd April 1916) was also a step in the same direction.
Mr. Tilak clearly reahsed that the Congress with the
small survivors of the Old Guard would not go in for the
radical propaganda he wished to concentrate upon.
If the co-operation of the leading Moderates was de###sired, the pace of our activities must be slowed down j
and this he was unwilling to do. He therefore started
the Indian Home Rule League where he and his enthu###siastic followers would have a free hand. As a conces###sion to the misgivings of the timid Moderates the Home
Rule League accepted the creed of the National Congress,
a thing which gratified the(Right) Hon. Mr. Shrinivasa
Shastri. But the Government was not so gratified.
They wanted to crush the Heme Rule Propaganda by
striking at the towering personality to whose organising
genius the League owed its birth.</p>
<p>This year (1916), the sixty-first anniversary of Mr.
Tilak&rsquo;s birth was celebrated in Maharashtra. It was
certainly a proud and glorious day. The harassments</p>
<p>232 LOKAMANYA TILAK</p>
<p>and persecutions that had fallen to Mr. Tilak&rsquo;s share
were simply innumerable. Only he could have emerged
unscathed out of such a terrific ordeal. More, he turned
seeming defeats to account and successfully enhanced
his prestige and honour from out of every reverse.
Since 1890, he had been steadily gaining in power and
popularity, while latterly the tide of his influence had
become irresitible. No wonder, that, not only those
who were associated with him in politics but many
others took part in the celebration. A large meeting
attended by over 8,000 persons was held (23rd July).
Friends and admirers from different parts of Maharashtra
read addresses and delivered congratulatory speeches.
A dress of honour, several individual presents and a huge
sum of one lakh of Rupees — testified to the feelings of
his admirers. Sitting heavily garlanded in the midst
of jubilant friends and well-wishers, Mr. Tilak thought
of the past ; &quot; Memories of storm and suffering &quot; said
he &quot; rather than those of comparative happiness rise
before my mind&rsquo;s eye.&quot; He was also saddened to find
that those with whom he started his career in the early
eightees — Chiplunkar, Dharap, Apte, Kelkar, Agarkar,
Namjoshi, Gokhale — had &quot; shuffled off their coil &quot; one
after the other. He alone remained to represent them.
&quot; Looking into the future &quot; said he &quot; after completing
sixty years, one&rsquo;s mind cannot but be filled with mis###givings ; and with declining strength one is apt to feel
less hopeful. But I devoutly hope that with your
support, I may be granted life and strength to add to
whatever work of public good I may have done.&quot;</p>
<p>When, under somewhat similar circumstances, Par###Bell was presented with an enormously big cheque, he</p>
<p>THE GREAT HOME-RULER 23J</p>
<p>&lt;quietly pocketed it and did not so much as thank his
iriends for their generosity. He took the present as a
matter of course. Mr. Tilak was made of a far finer
stuff. With simple modesty and characteristic gener###osity, he said : —</p>
<p>&quot; I do not know what I can do with the money. I
do not want it for my own sake nor would it be proper
for me to accept it for personal use. I can only accept
it in trust to spend it in a constitutional way for National
work after adding my own quota to it.&quot;</p>
<p>If the people brought their birth-day present to Mr.
Tilak, the Government, too, contributed their mite.
They, too, sent a birth-day present to Mr. Tilak in the
form of a notice calling upon him to show cause why he
should not be bound over for good behaviour for a
period of one year in a sum of Rupees 20,000 in his own
recognizance and in two securities of Rs. 10,000 each.
This is a striking illustration of how &quot; Mr. Tilak&rsquo;s public
life has been like a double-faced Janus — one face of it
expressing the enjoyment and the delight of public ap###preciation and the other, inseparable from the first,
expressing the toil of determined resistance to official
persecution.&quot;</p>
<p>The Government wanted to silence Mr. Tilak, not to
imprison him ; perhaps, the war came in the way.
They, therefore, picked up three of his speeches — the
^one delivered (ist May 1916) at Balgaum and the
other two at Ahmadnagar (31st May and ist June
1916). These speeches were models of sobriety and
moderation. &quot; Almost every alternate sentence pro###claimed the speaker&rsquo;s loyalty to the British connec###tion.&quot; Failing to find stronger exhibitions of Mr.</p>
<p>^34 LOKAMANYA TILAK</p>
<p>Tilak&rsquo;s disloyalty, the Government fixed on these Home
Rule speeches to launch their offensive against him.
Through their counsel, they took care to inform the
court and the world at large, that they took exception
to Mr. Tilak&rsquo;s lectures on Home Rule and not to Home
Rule itself. Mr. Binning in opening the case on 7th
May 1916 before the District Magistrate, Poona, did
not hesitate to call Mr. Tilak&rsquo;s declarations of loyalty as
a mere cloak to defend himself from the clutches of
law. He (Mr. Binning) questioned Mr. Tilak&rsquo;s bona
fdes, laid stress on isolated passages and pressed for
conviction. Mr. G. W. Hatch, District Magistrate
placed rehance on Mr. Justice Strachey&rsquo;s interpretation
(misinterpretation, we must now say) of the word dis###affection which was regarded as meaning &quot; absence of</p>
<p>ajffection.&quot; &quot; Looking at these speeches, as a whole,
fairly, freely and without giving undue weight to isola###ted passages &quot; the only impression produced on the###mind of the Magistrate was that &quot; Mr. Tilak wanted
to disaffect his audience towards the Government &quot; and
knowing that he could not interest his audience in his
arguments unless he illustrated them forcibly told them
&quot; that they were slaves, that their grievances remained
undressed and that the Government only considers its
interests, which are ahen to those of the Indians, and
intends to keep the people in slavery under the
excuse that Indians are not fit to rule themselves.&rsquo;&rsquo;
The Magistrate, therefore, under Section 108 of C. P.
Code, directed Mr. Tilak to enter into a bond in a sum of
Rs. 20,000, with two sureties each in the sum of Rs. io,ooa
to be of good behaviour for a period of one year.
The decision was, however, reversed (9th November</p>
<p>THE GREAT HOME-RULER 23$</p>
<ol start="1916">
<li>as it deserved to be, by Mr. Justice Batchelor
and Justice (Sir) Lallubhai Shah in their separate but
concurring judgments. (The Hon.) Mr. Jinnah ably
defended Mr. Tilak both in the lower and the revisional
court. But though Mr. Tilak triumphed, still his
main points were not satisfactorily solved. The main
feature of his speeches as the Times of India then re###marked was a distinction between the King and the
King&rsquo;s Government. This sage paper shrewdly re###marked that if Mr. Tilak wanted, by this subtle distinc###tion to evade a law, with the meaning of which he ought
to have been familiar, then &ldquo;he is far less astute than.
we thought him to be.&rdquo; This is not however a question
of the evasion of the law or of that astuteness of the
offender. Nor can it be set at rest by the opinions of
the two learned Judges, Mri Justice Batchelor and Mr.
Justice Shah. Mr, Tilak openly and sincerely professes
his loyalty to His Majesty the King Emperor and the
British Parliament which really are &quot; the Government
by law established in India.&quot; He claims full freedom
to criticize the administration of the country. But
Mr. Justice Batchelor holds that Government could act
only through hum.an agency ; and as the Civil Service is
admittedly the principal agency, where it is criticised
en blcc, in an intemperate language, hatred of the Civil
Service and consequently hatred or contempt of the
Government is likely to be the result. According to
this decision, it is purely a question of fact dependent on
the language used and not on the distinction on which
Mr. Tilak and his counsel relied. Regarding Mr. Tilak&rsquo;s
speeches, Mr. Justice Batchelor writes as follows : —
*&rsquo; Probably the fairest way to ascertain the effect i&amp;</li>
</ol>
<p>■236 LOKAMANYA TILAK</p>
<p>to read the three speeches from beginning to end,
quietly and attentively, remembering the arguments
and remembering the politically ignorant audience to
whom Mr. Tilak was addressing. I have so read these
speeches, not once, but several times, and the impres###sion left on the mind is that, on the whole, despite cer###tain passages which are rightly objected to by the
prosecution, the general effect would not probably and
naturally be to cause disaffection, that is hostility or</p>
<p>enmity or contempt &quot;</p>
<p>Mr. Tilak&rsquo;s triumph was the triumph of the Home
Kule cause. His enemies were crest-fallen. The Times
of India, which immediately after the decision of the
District Magistrate, had preached a homily to Mr. Tilak
and poured out its venom in the &quot; Politics in the
Deccan &quot; was compelled, knowing discretion to be the
better part of valour, to unreservedly withdraw the re###marks. An attempt was made within a fortnight of
the decision of the High Court to lure and terapt Mr.
Tilak to disobey the District Police Act. At Gadag,
•where Mr. Tilak had gone on private business, the Dis###trict Magistrate, finding that the people had assembled
to do hirq honour, served upon him an order prohibiting
him from delivering any harangue. This order was served
not at the eleventh hour, but at he twelfth
and a less astute or farsighted man than Mr. Tilak
would have felt tempted to test its legality by
breaking it. Mr. Tilak, however, refused to allow
the District Magistrate to regain the ground
which the Government had lost by their deba###cle in the Security Case. Ultimately, pansupari
^as given to Mr. Tilak at the meeting and the</p>
<p>THE GREAT HOME-RULER 237</p>
<p>proceedings ended without any hitch after Mr. Tilak had
made a short speech.</p>
<p>In October 19 16, Mr. Tilak attended the Ahmedabad
Provincial Conference under the presidency of Mr.
Jinnah. He received a grand reception from Gujarat
He exhorted the Conference to support the constitu###tional reforms suggested in the &quot; memorandum of 19 &quot;
In November he was elected a member of the All -India
Congress Committee.</p>
<p>It is pleasant to recall these days when he worked
band-in-hand with Mrs. Besant. The Home Rule Pro###poganda was in full swing. The Bureaucrats were
non-plussed, the Moderates were shaking their heads
with doubt and hesitation. The nation was drunk with
enthusiasm. In Europe, Autocracy was being shattered
to pieces. India&rsquo;s loyalty was clear as the sun. The
British Nation was grateful ; the reactionary element
was weak and helpless. The sky was resounding with
the cry of Reforms and though many an advanced
Moderate and valiant Nationalist did signal service to
the National Cause during this period, posterity will
justly give credit to the two mighty Lieutenants of the
Goddess of Liberty for having kept the flag flying —
Mr Tilak and Mrs. Besant,</p>
