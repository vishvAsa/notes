      <description>&lt;p&gt;Sournce &lt;a href=&#34;https://pragyata.com/chequered-brilliance-of-raja-man-singh-of-amer/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Chequered Brilliance of Raja Man Singh of Amer&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The often mischaracterised Raja Man Singh of Amer was a dharm-rakshak who only had the best Hindu interests at heart.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;July 13, 2021July 13, 2021 |  By: Yogendra Singh&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Quite often we see people, from a tremendously large array of the political and intellectual spectrum – from left to right wings, clever to dumb beings, all in their respective capacities, built out of ahistorical whims – issuing stern statements and godly judgements about Raja Man Singh of Amer (Jaipur). He is largely seen as a “traitor, a servant of Mughals and a daughter giver.” An assumption that is less analytical and more of a crude reductionist attempt at dismissal. His image has been tarnished to such an extent that, to be on a humorous ground[1], if we let the most absent-minded of men be plunged in his deepest reveries — give that man a pencil and a paper, set his hands agoing on Raja Man, he will infallibly turn him into a traitor.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Protected by Lord Viṣṇu&amp;hellip;he ruled like King Bhoja of the old.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;– Sūryamalla Miśra of Bundi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The comparison with Bhoja is quite accurate. Both men had very similar lives.&#xA;Polymath geniuses. Their activities in field of science, religion suggesting they were men of leisure but actually lived during the most turbulent time of the century.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
