      <description>&lt;p&gt;Cheap-ass director of cheap-ass movies, Pa Ranjith, &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/pRaDs_09/status/1137700431843418120&#34;&gt;insults&lt;/a&gt; our great king rAjarAja chOzha as a robber of dalit lands. There is zero evidence for this assertion.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On the contrary, although land was (and still is) recognized as belonging to the state, rAjarAja recognized the separate lands owned by paRaiyars (पऱैयर्-s), a caste well-recognized as dalit today and gave them tax-exemptions, along with Hindu temples &amp;amp; Jain monasteries; read on.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Here are two inscriptions from the great shiva temple of tanjAvUr (तञ्जावूर्), the बृहदीश्वर. The first one is from the second tier of the south wall. Will post original and translation; have even highlighted relevant portions. This is but a sample.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&#34;https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1099670616767049729.html&#34;&gt;TW&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We are often told that that the raids by chOzha emperor rAjendra I on the shrIvijaya-s were due to the latter&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;interference with trade&amp;rdquo;. Unfortunately, the exact nature of interference has been, for long, elusive to us.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It has been elusive for even the erudite nIlakaNTha shAstri as we had always relied on Indian documents. So what was this “interference”? An interesting (&amp;amp; rather hilarious) answer is found in the work of Tansen Sen &amp;amp; Noboru Karashima.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
