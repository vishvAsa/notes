## Intro
The guhila-s or the descendants of king guhadatta are probably one of the most remarkable dynasties of post-gupta India. While neither expansive in imperial terms nor widely remembered for their architectural splendors, they are perhaps foremost in representing the Hindu spirit of survival in face of the Islamic Jihads. Their heroic defense of the dharma inspired the later marAThA ruler shivAjI and the peshva bAjIrAv. How they came into being is somewhat shrouded in mystery, but they have consistently held themselves as a brahma-kShatra clan, i.e., brAhmaNa lineage with shaiva affiliations that took to the way of kShatriya-s.

## Base evidence
The first major genealogical inscription of theirs is the famous Atpur inscription of king shaktikumAra (~977 CE), which gives their lineage from their founder, guhadatta, to him. The other major genealogical inscriptions are the Chittor inscription (~1275 CE); the mount arbuda inscription (~1286 CE); the Ranpur inscription (1440 CE); the Kumbhalgarh inscription (1461 CE). In the Chittor, arbuda and Ranpur inscription, the founder is said to be (mahArAvala <- mahArAjakula) bAppA (Pkt: father) (rAvala) and the second ruler is said to be guhila= guhadatta. The Kumbhalgarh inscription, however, gives guhila as the founding mahArAja. The Kadmal copper plates also name guhadatta as the founder. The ekali~Nga inscription of king naravAhana, the successor of allaTa and predecessor of shaktikumAra, mentions bAppA as his ancestor without, however, specifying where exactly he comes in the lineage.

However, the Kumbhalgarh inscription mentions bAppA rAvala as the 5th king. This would be more consistent with the timeline where bAppA fought the Mohammedan ghAzI-s and conquered the fort of chitrakUTa (Chittor) from the maurya king mAna or manurAja. It seems prior to that, at least some of the guhila-s were vassals of the maurya-s. The Dabok inscription mentioned that a certain dhaNika guhilaputra (a collateral line to that leading to shaktikumAra) was a vassal of the maurya dhavala(appadeva). 

The chronicler of the Mogol tyrant Akbar, mullA Abu’l Fazal, mentions that the lineage of udayasiMha and pratApa whom his pAdishAh fought with much ferocity began about 800 years before their time. That brings us to around 760-770 CE, which would be closer to the inferred time of bAppA rAvala from Sanskrit mAhAtmya-s devoted to the ekali~Nga-kShetra. 

## kAlabhoja
Historians have tried to identify bAppA with the kings in the Atpur list, which is the oldest genealogical tradition of the guhila-s surviving to date. There are three kings who are often favored candidates: 

1. shIlAditya, the 5th king from guhadatta in that inscription; 
2. kAlabhoja, the 8thking in the list; 
3. khummANa-I the son of the former. 

There is the obscure inscription of mahArAvala pata (not sure if it was ever published), which mentions khummANa-I as the son of bAppA rAvala. This, together with khummANa-I being the son of kAlabhoja in the Atpur inscription, supports the idea of kAlabhoja being bAppA. 

The bardic accounts of the rAjaputra-s have similarities in describing the exploits of khummANa and bAppA, suggesting that there was some conflation of the deeds of the two by the time the old lay of khummANa (khummANa rAso) was recast at the time of mahArANA pratApa. Hence, we tend to favor the kAlabhoja identification for bAppA.

## Founder
This then leaves us with the question of who was the bAppA placed at the beginning of the list in some of the inscriptions. He was probably the brAhmaNa father of guhadatta, who was taken as the 0-point, and the founder of the dynasty, who was from a place called Anandapura. This is mentioned in the Chittor inscription. 

Consistent with that, the Atpur inscription mentions guhadatta to be a vipra-kula-nandana. As per Abu’l Fazal’s account of the clan, this Anandapura would be a place in Berar, Maharashtra. At some level, this founding father (i.e., the bAppA = father of guhadatta) has also been conflated with bAppA rAvala in the bardic tradition. It appears guhadatta married a paramAra princess facilitating the transition of the clan to kShatriya-s. 

They also seem to have developed an association with the predatory tribal bhilla-s who often served in their army down to the time of pratApa and amarasiMha. 

## Meta-lore
The genealogical telescoping and incomplete preservation seen in this famed dynasty from the common era are comparable with what is seen in the paurANika genealogies and the account of the Kashmirian rulers by kalhaNa. In the former case, we do not have the luxury of time-calibrated inscriptions but have some temporal markers from older Vedic texts. Hence, inferring history from the paurANika genealogies should be done with even greater caution.
