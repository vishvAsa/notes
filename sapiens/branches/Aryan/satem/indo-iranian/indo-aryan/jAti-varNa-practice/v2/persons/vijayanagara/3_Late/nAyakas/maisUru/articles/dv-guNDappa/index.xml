I did not approve of his means of work either. But, opinions and achievements are different; ability is different. I will presently write about Abbas Khan’s strengths. His dexterity, his nature of leading from the front, his cleverness in all-round thinking – no one can say these traits are useless in public. On the contrary, these are qualities which have gone missing in the public discourse in the last twenty years.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

It was born with the breaking up of India’s territory.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Consider this span of sixty years to be a meaningful segment in a human life-time, our people made it a tradition to celebrate the occasion with the festive ritual of &lt;em&gt;ṣaṣṭyābda-pūrti&lt;/em&gt;&#xA;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Seshadri Iyer was a native of Madras. He hailed from the region of Palghat (Palakkad). He wasn’t, in fact, someone the British authorities had summoned. I have heard that it was Rungacharlu who brought Seshadri Iyer into government service. When Rungacharlu was in the government service of the Madras Presidency, there were occasions when he had to visit places such as Coimbatore, Wayanad, and Palghat on government duty. On one such official trip, he got introduced to the family of Seshadri Iyer and came to realize that young Seshadri was a brilliant intellectual. Since he was in need of a competent, friendly, and loyal person to assist him, Rungacharlu selected Seshadri Iyer.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

It hints at Krishna Rao’s nature. In all dealings and in all aspects – rules, estimation, conviction, and principle – this was Krishna Rao’s specialty.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;One morning, around nine, I was sitting at a friend’s house in Basavanagudi. Let’s call him V. Beside his house lived another friend M. Though the houses were separate, the front yard was one large undivided area without partition. Hence, words spoken in the front yard were clearly audible in both houses.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;My friend M, dressed and ready to leave for office, came into the front yard. At the same time, another friend R appeared at the gate. Then, the following conversation took place –&lt;br&gt;&#xA;M: Hello Ayyangari, you are coming now! Where had you been?&lt;br&gt;&#xA;R: I had been to M N Krishna Rao’s house. Thought of seeing you too, and came here.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;M: Why do you trouble that &lt;em&gt;brāhmaṇa&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;br&gt;&#xA;R: You know, that note I have received, saying that I will retire in three months? I’d been there to see if something could be done about it.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;M: Go tell that wall! If there is no blemish in your record, he will not put a spanner in the works. But if there is, he will not suppress it even if your grandfather comes back. What business do you have with such a person who upholds justice at all costs?”&lt;br&gt;&#xA;I became curious upon hearing this. I came out and looked at both of them. All three of us laughed together.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;What M said was an indirect assessment.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Persian literature and culture had come to Mirza as a family trait. His ancestors had come to India from Persia as traders.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

It is a wheel of time spanning sixty years between 1880 and 1940.* The historical events after 1940 is not relevant to my present purpose.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;After Mirza &lt;em&gt;saheb&lt;/em&gt;, the person who assumed power as the Dewan was &lt;em&gt;Pradhāna Śiromaṇi&lt;/em&gt; Sir Nyapathi Madhava Rau. After him, &lt;em&gt;Dewan Bahadur&lt;/em&gt; Sir Arcot Ramasamy Mudaliar took charge. With his tenure, the position of ‘Dewan’ came to an end. Mudaliar came in as the Dewan, and later went on to become the first Chief Minister of the Responsible Government before retiring. During his administration, &lt;em&gt;Śrīmān&lt;/em&gt; Kyasamballi Chengalaraya Reddy had worked as his colleague for a few months. Thereafter, Reddy himself became the Chief Minister during the rule of the Responsible Government. Everybody knows the people who became the Chief Ministers after him. I believe I don&amp;rsquo;t have enough authority to talk about them. I am ancient, they are modern. If I am told that my mind is prejudiced, I cannot deny it. It might be a fact. I lack the courage to claim that I am the purest and that my mind is the most uncontaminated.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

He was the very first councillor from Mysuru.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;He was born and brought up in Mysuru.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I have heard from respectable people that he was scrupulously honest, sattvik and honourable.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;His son was Purna Raghavendra Rao. He was a preceptor to Maharaja Krishna Raja Wodeyar IV. Later, he was a huzur secretary. He was initially an excise commissioner during the time of Sir M. Visvesvaraya and later a councillor.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Madhava Rao, Thanjavur Ananda Rao came to power as the Diwan. He was rich by birth and also possessed all the great attributes that a wealthy person should have. His father, Raja Sir. T. Madhava Rao, had been the Diwan of Baroda (Vadodara) and Travancore; He was well known as a person of remarkable intellect and competence. ‘Raja’ and ‘Sir’ were the titles conferred on him by the British Government. Sir. T. Madhava Rao served as the president of the Reception Committee at the first ever Congress session held in Madras.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

He was a &lt;em&gt;smārta&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Deśastha brāhmaṇa&lt;/em&gt; from the Tanjore region. We could see a little bit of Sir K Seshadri Iyer’s mien in him. Employed by the Government of Mysore during Rungacharlu’s tenure as Dewan, Madhava Rao rose to prominence and became well known for his competence. He became successful as the Inspector General of Police. It was the period when the plague had struck for the first time. To prevent the disease, the government had made arrangements such as inoculation. A significant percentage of the population refused to accept these measures and protested. The reason for the refusal and resistance was fear. This new medical procedure of injecting a drug called ‘inoculation’ and the regulation to stay away from home had frightened people in multiple ways. In places like Ganjam and Seringapatam (Srirangapatna), the protests were spearheaded by wrestlers and strongmen. Stopping such an army from marching in became the responsibility of V P Madhava Rao, the then Chief of the Police Force. Apparently, he conducted his duty quite courageously and cleverly. Thus Madhava Rao’s success grew.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
