Rajah Jawahir Singh, unlike his father, had little control over his passions, no respect for antiquity and tradition, no catholicity of heart. At any rate, tradition, no doubt prejudiced to a great extent, associates his name with the despoilation of the relics of the Mughal imperial grandeur. He is said to have seated himself on the black marble throne of the Emperor Jahangir, a sacrilege which made the proud seat of the Great Mughal, to burst in pique as it were, leaving a crack which is still to be seen! 

It was perhaps during the regime of Jawahir Singh, the strongest and most vindictive among the Jat Rajahs that The Great Mosque of Agra was changed into a market: the grain merchants had order to expose their goods for sale there. 

The butchers' shops were closed. They [the Jats] made very severe prohibition of the slaughter of oxen, cows and also of kids [?]...

All public profession of the Muhammadan religion was interdicted under very harsh treatment. The muazins were ordered to cease their functions. One man gave the azan but the Government of Agra pulled his tongue out."* 

Though it is but human to retaliate, it was certainly unworthy of the son of Suraj Mal who had honoured the bones of a Muslim refugee,-Shamsher Bahadur, by building a mosque over it at Deeg. [Imad, 203.]
