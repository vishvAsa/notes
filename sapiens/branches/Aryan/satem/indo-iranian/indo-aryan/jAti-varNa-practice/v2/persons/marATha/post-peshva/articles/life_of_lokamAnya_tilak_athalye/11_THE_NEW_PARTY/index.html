<p>Bal Gangadhar Tilak is a Maratha Brahmin, thinker and
fighter in one. His is the brain that conceived, his is the pen
that expressed, his is the force that has directed the extra-ordi###nary movement against which the bureaucracy is now calling
up all its resources.</p>
<p>The Morning Leader in 1908.</p></blockquote>
<p>The year 1905 forms a land-mark in Indian History.
In that year was carried out the fatal Partition of
Bengal. The whole Province was thrown into a ferment. The Bengalis heartily disliked the odius measure.
Appeals were made, monster petitions were sent to the
Parliament. Then came the Bycott. It encouraged
Swadeshism. The Swadeshi movement quickly out###grew its economic or political nature and became a
movement for National Regeneration. The Nation
called for Swadeshism in dress, in diet, in habits, in life,
in arts, in literature, in science, in religion and philoso###phy. Swadeshism thus became an all-pervading spiri###ritual movement directed against the Western Civilisa###tion which the British Government represented and
symbolized. The Boycott bade fair to develop into a
movement of Passive Resistance. Young men enrolled
themselves as National Volunteers for peaceful partici###pation in public Hfe. The Government retaliated with
the Risley Circular and the Carlyle Circular. The-</p>
<p>THE NEW PARTY 13^</p>
<p>Nation demanded a National Course of Education,
Money flowed in like water ; the National University of
Bengal was established. These activities provoked the
official world. Repression, the favourite weapon of
despots, was resorted to. The leaders of the movement
were publicity humiliated ; meetings were dispersed
with regulation lathis. The path of repression is gene###rally perilous and slippery, and it is no wonder that
** the Bureaucracy marched from one repression to
another.&quot; The armoury of repressive measures was
replenished. The Deportation Act of 1818 was hunted
out and Lala Lajpat Rai and Sirdar A jit Singh were spi###rited away to Burma (1907). Mr. Tilak was tried for
sedition (1908) and transported. The Nationalist Party
was routed. Babu Ashvini Kumar and eight other
popular leaders were deported. A few crumbs of re###forms, niggardly given and avidly accepted, were the
reward of the surviving Party of Moderates who had
shown their loyalty by rallying round the Bureaucratic
banner. Eventually the Partition of Bengal was modi###fied in 1911.</p>
<p>The Partition of Bengal, hateful as it was, consoli=
dated that sense of Indian Nationality which common
serfdom, wesstern education and the National Congress
had done so much to foster. It is, however, remark###able that outside Bengal, those of the English-educated
Indians who had hitherto too much paraded their &quot; All
India view &quot; did the least to show in a practical way
their sympathy with Bengal. Mr. Tilak, on the con###trary, who owing to his Shivaji and Ganapati festivals,
was regarded to have encouraged a spirit of particula###rism, was to the forefront, anxious to do his &ldquo;little bit**^</p>
<p>1140 LOKAMANYA TILAK</p>
<p>ior lacerated Bengal. He had nothing but contempt
for those wise-acres, who were ready with their statis###tics and free-trade theories to throw cold water on popu###lar enthusiasm, who harped on the eternal theme of
our weakness and our want of organization and who
were afraid of the plentiful resources of the Government.
Mr. Tilak, while admitting the force of all reasonable
objections, declared that even an ineffectual struggle
in the face of tremendous odds was itself no mean
achievement. He could never subscribe to the theory
of &quot; learning to swim on land.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With the commencement of the anti-Partition agita###tion, Mr. Tilak emerges from his life of Provincial
Leadership and becomes the leader of the &quot; Newborn **
Nationalist Party in India. Till IQ05, our public life
could hardly be said to have been National. The Press
did indeed keep us from relapsing into our provincial
ruts, but even the Press or the Congress had not visibly
created that fellow-feeling with delights in mutual help,
support and encouragement. Most of the leaders in
the country were known only in their provinces. A bril###liant member of the Imperial Legislative Council, a
dominating leader in the National Congress or an un###bending fighter with the despotic bureaucracy did
indeed get a recognition which was something more
than provincial. But that free, swift interchange of
thought and that inter-dependence of policies and actions
which an organised National Life presupposes was
totally absent. The cruel wrong done to Bengal, the
solid agitation which the Bengalis started, together
•with the widespread discontent caused by the reaction###;ary policy of Lord Curzon, afforded Mr. Tilak the long-</p>
<p>THE NEW PARTY I4r</p>
<p>coveted opportunity of consolidating our feeling of
Indian Nationality by leading an All-India Movement
for the double purpose of righting the wrong and awa###kening and organizing the country.</p>
<p>This was a task for which he was pre-eminently quali###fied. In his own province, his immense popularity, due
to twenty-five years of courageous, self-sacrificing and
single-minded work enabled him to carry the message
of Swadeshi and Swaraj down to the most distant ham###lets. He had trained up a number of people in the
work of organization and agitation. Hundreds of his
students, scattered over the Presidency had received
incentive to public activities from his personal contact
and his weekly writings in the Kesari. His frequent
tours in Maharashtra had enabled him to organize his
province for National work and so successful was his
organization that no sooner did he sound the slogan of
Swadeshi and Boycott than the note was echoed and
re-echoed throughout the length and breadth of Western
India. Not a village in the province but had its
Swadeshi meetings ; not a town but had its swadeshi
shops.</p>
<p>But this was not the only work Mr. Tilak had to do
now. There is no work more difficult than of directing,
organizing and controlling movements in such distant
places as Bengal, the Punjab and Madras. The difii###culty lies in the fact that while the initiative in several
matters must be left to the leaders on the spot, the
whole movement must present a single idea and a single
purpose manifested in consistent and uniform activities.
The leader of the whole movement must needs be a man
who will command respect and obedience and whose</p>
<p>142 LOKAMANYA TILAK</p>
<p>instructions would be carried out in spirit. He must
act both as a stimulant and a sedative ; he must use
spurs or draw reins according to necessity. From all
the great Nationalist leaders — Messrs. Bepin Chunder
Pal, Arabindo Ghose, Lajpat Rai, G. S. Khaparde, G.
Subramanya Ayer — Mr. Tilak received that homage to
which his genius, sacrifices and long uninterrupted ser###vices of the country fully entitled him. The organiza###tion of the Nationalist Party also involved the work of
fighting with the Moderates both in and out of the
Congress. This was no easy thing ; for the Moderate
Party, moribund though it was, controlled most of the
National organisations of the day ; its leaders, with
their long record of public service, were capable beyond
question, learned beyond compare, resourceful and do###mineering. They were the last persons to allow them###selves to be swept away. It required all Mr. Tilak&rsquo;s
genius, aided of course by the powerful ability of his
political colleagues, to give a rub to the Moderates. In
the Congress he was the only man who could beard the
Bombay Lion ; and his consumate mastery of ail wea###pons of intellectual warfare enabled him to measure
swords with Sir Pherozeshah Mehta.</p>
<p>Mr. Tilak once said that every such movement ought
to be judged by a triple standard (i) The actual work
it does (2) the moral force it awakens and (3) by the in###tellectual revolution it brings about. The anti-Parti###tion movement soon lost its provincial character and
became a movement for National Regeneration and the
attainment of Swaraj. The swadeshi spirit stimulated
the establishment of several industries hitherto starving.
Swadeshi shops were opened everywhere ; Swadeshi</p>
<p>THE NEW PARTY I43</p>
<p>exhibitions were held to popularize the work of the new
industries. The Paisa fund, originally started by a
Mr. Kale, became under Mr. Tilak&rsquo;s guidance the most
popular means of collecting funds for starting suitable
industries. Spinning and weaving industries began to
thrive. Education and Temperance received a great
impetus. In short, the movement was on the right
lines and promised brilliant results.</p>
<p>But it is the misfortune of every infant democracy to
be called upon to do constructive work with one hand
while with the other it is engaged in a life-and-death
struggle with the powers that be.</p>
<p>|&gt;f.The moral force which the movement roused was
simply astonishing . We have seen, how under the re###actionary regime of Lord Curzon, disappointment and
a sense of humiliation hung like a pall over the country.
The swadeshi-hoycott movement dispelled all these
clouds. It created hope and enthusiasm in the minds
of Indians. *&rsquo; Self-reliance, no mendicancy &quot; became
the watchword of the people. The National self###respect was fully awakened. People refused to take
insults lying down. They refused to allow the foreign
Bureaucrats to be arbiters of our destinies. They were
willing to suffer for their convictions. They came
forward in their hundreds to go to gaol. Young men
worked as pickets or volunteers and received sound
elementary training in public life. A hopelessly dis###organized nation seriously began to organise itself. The
land of disunity was slowly closing up its ranks. Even
the &quot; depressed &quot; classes joined, heart and soul, the
movement and on two occassions, Mr. Tilak was the
recipient of their pan-supari. A spirit of unity and</p>
<p>144 LOKAMANYA TILAK</p>
<p>equality was abroad. Mr. Tilak was everywhere praised&rsquo;
for declaring, in a public lecture, that all castes are
equal and that graduation of castes is foreign to Hindu
religion and is unsupported by Vedic texts. Meetings
were held not in thousands but in hundreds of thousands.
Poets sang of patriotism. A truly National Literature
was born. The great revival promised to sweep away
all barriers and deluge the country.</p>
<p>The intellectual revolution produced by the move###ment was more remarkable still. When Lord Curzon
cut Bengal in twain with a stroke of pen, the centre of
gravity of all our activities changed from the Govern###ment to the people. It was Ranade who once said that
our petitions, though mainly drawn out for Government
were also intended to awaken the people. The Nation###alist party went a few steps further and declared that all
our writings and speeches were intended for the people ;
Government might, if they wanted, take note of them.</p>
<p>The boycott movement gave a deathblow to all the^
free- trade theories in which the generation represented
by the majority of the then leaders was trained up.
People clearly came to realize how England had stran###gled Indian Industries and they were determined, in
the absence of any protective tariff in the interest of
Indian manufactures, to boycott British goods.</p>
<p>But the greatest contribution made by the movement
to the political life of the country was the fixing of the
goal of all our endeavours. Ours is perhaps the first in###stance in the history of the vv^orld, where for a couple of
generations, the children of the soil did believe their con###querors to be their deliverers. Mr. Tilak was the first
to give a rub to this easy-going faith. His Shivaji</p>
<p>THE NEW PARTY 145</p>
<p>festival, with its inevitable suggestion of the ideal of
Swaraj was an eye-sore not only to the Anglo-Indians
but to the Moderates as well. The former openly called
it sedition, the latter probably thought pretty much in
the same way and refused to take part in it. It was re###served for the anti-partition agitation to place before
the country a definite ideal, freed from the confusing
verbiage that characterised our thought till 1905. Mr.
Tilak&rsquo;s ideal thus became the ideal of the country and it
was ** imposed &quot; upon the National Congress by no less
a personage than Dadabhai Naoroji. Neither Mr. Tilak
nor Mr. Naoroji preached anything beyond the colonial
form of self-government. But the bitter disappoint###ment caused by the Partition of Bengal, together with
the utter loss of faith of the people in the sincerity of the
rulers carried the ideal of self-government to the logical
length. If Mr. Tilak has on a few occasions defended
absolute autonomy as being a perfectly * legal &rsquo; ideal,
we should not forget that even Lord Morley has nothing
to say against it and that the Hon&rsquo;ble Mr. Gokhale has
in his Allahabad speech (1907) declared that he would
not put any limit to the aspirations of the people.</p>
<p>It was not so much the difference of opinion regarding
the ultimate ideal that gave birth to the two schools
of thought, — &rsquo; Moderate and Extremist &lsquo;. Ideals do
not so much affect every day work as ways and means.
In a word, the two parties were divided on * Boycott *,
The attitude of the Moderates was determined by three
things (i) They had not utterly lost their faith in the
British Government or the Indian bureaucracy. (2)
They had not the courage to go to the logical length of
propositions conceded by them. (3) They were oppressed</p>
<p>10</p>
<p>146 LOKAMANYA TILAK</p>
<p>with an undue sense of the power of the Government
and an inordinate consciousness of India&rsquo;s weakness.
Hr. Tilak thought otherwise. He said : —</p>
<p>&quot; We do not believe in philanthrophy in Politics.
There is no instance in history where a foreign nation
has ruled another without any expectations of profit.
We believe in Lord Morley and in the genuineness of his
professions as a philosopher. The old school thinks
that politics could be governed by the dictates of philo###sophy ; we hold that these are quite different things and
ought not to be mixed up together. The old school
thinks that concessions could be secured by logical per###suation.</p>
<p>&quot; Mr. Gokhale believe in sacrifice. He calls upon
the people to be up and doing. He accepts even pas###sive resistance as a constitutional weapon. He admits
that the Bureaucracy here is callous and the Democracy
at &rsquo; Home &rsquo; is indifferent. He allows that our efforts
have not yet borne sufficient fruit. He declares that
the situation is critical. In all this he is at one with
the New Party. But when it comes to action he will
say &rsquo; My friends, let us still wait a little. No use
flouting the Government. They will suppress us.&rsquo; It,
therefore, comes to this. Mr. Gokhale belongs in theory
to the New Party, and in practice to the old one.&quot;</p>
<p>One of the greatest defects of the Moderate leaders
has been their habit of clinging to unmeaning words and
phrases. One such was &quot; Constitutional agitation.&quot;
Mr. Tilak called upon the Moderate leaders to explain if
India had got any constitution. &quot; Can we prevent the
violation even of those common rights we have ? Can
,&ldquo;we punish these violations by holding the executive</p>
<p>IHE NEW PARTY I47</p>
<p>Government responsible ? The only &rsquo; constitution &rsquo; we
have is the Penal Code !&rdquo; Mr. Gokhale in his Allahabad
lecture admitted in one breath that every form of agita###tion from the non-payment of taxes down to the sending
of petitions is constitutional ; and in another he declar###ed that &ldquo;constitutional agitation is an agitation to bring
about changes in the administration through the consti&rsquo;
tuted authorities !&rdquo; This novel interpretation of a well###known phrase in constitutional law excludes such severe
forms of agitation as the non-payment of taxes !</p>
<p>Mr. Tilak held that though our agitation would be
law-abiding in the ordinary sense of the term, still it
all rested with the Government whether to make it
legal or illegal. A movement which was perfectly legal
to-day could by a fiat of the Bureaucracy be made
illegal to-morrow. We would certainly refrain from
rebellion, murder, arson, and the like. But barring this
well-understood limit, there was none other which we
could put to our endeavours. Our agitation could not be
constitutional because we have had no constitution worth
the name. It could not be exactly legal as the power of
making laws rested with those whose interests clashed
with ours. Therefore, said Mr. Tilak, justice, morality
and history must be our only guides.</p>
<p>En passant we may note that when last year the
question of changing the creed of the Congress came
before the chosen leaders of the people, Mahatma Gandhi
with his unerring sagacity, rejected both the words
** constitutional &quot; and &quot; legal &quot; and in their place put
in ** peaceful and legitimate methods,&quot; an unconscious
paraphrase of the triple limitations of justice, morality
and history put by Mr. Tilak,</p>
<p>148 LOKAMANYA TILAK</p>
<p>Many an admirer of Mr. Tilak has deplored his lack
of the gift of the gab. Persons are not wanting who
say &quot; Had Mr. Tilak been an orator, he would have
vanquished the Moderate party long before he actually
did.&quot;. .Though not an eloquent speaker, Mr. Tilak was
always an effective one. Even so fastidious a critic as
the Hon&rsquo;ble Mr. Chintamani has recorded his praise of
Mr. Tilak&rsquo;s speech (at the Calcutta Congress of 1896) on
Quinquinnial Provincial Contracts. Another Congress
speech of Mr. Tilak was pronounced, by a high authority
to have had &quot; a genuine Maratha ring about it.&quot; Mr.
Tilak&rsquo;s platform speeches, English or Marathi, always
produced profound impression on his hearers ; for, as
Lord Morley says *&rsquo; Political oratory is action not words;
action, character, will, conviction, purpose and person###ality.&quot; Mr. Tilak, deficient in words, had enough of
character and personality. These made him quite
irresistible.</p>
<p>The Indian Patriot describes Mr. Tilak&rsquo;s political
oratory in the following judicious words : —</p>
<p>• Of all political thinkers in India, Mr. Tilak has the
invaluable gift of shedding dry light on the subject of###his discourse, without converting his address into an
appeal to our emotions merely. Nor does he desire to
re*iterate commonplace observations and stale and super###ficial sentiments. On the other hand, it has been his&gt;
aim whenever he comes forward to make a public pro###nouncement, to convince the intellect of his hearers, to
overcome the doubts and difficulties of his audience,
and to take up the strongest position of his opponents^
and establish his own, in the light of reason and logic&gt;
as the more sustainable ground. &hellip; He does not give</p>
<p>THE NEW PARTY 14^</p>
<p>&lsquo;I3ie impression of one who has been hustled to take up
an attitude or who desires to hustle others into an opi###nion which he has ready for them. He argues out the
position logically and unflinchingly and leaves it to
others to judge whether his conclusions deserve their
assent or not. . .He dissects the position, as a biologist
would dissect an organism, and with cold conviction
explains the bearing of each dissected part to the rest
and is content if he is able to be plainly and unerringly
understood.&quot;</p>
<p>Another critic (The Indian People) is no less eulogis###tic : — &ldquo;As a speaker, Mr. Tilak has nothing of
the demagogue or the impassioned platform orator
about him. There are no high-sounding phrases, no
flights of rhetoric. His manner is subdued and free
from gesticulation. The sentences are terse ; the</p>
<p>language is simple and direct He appealed</p>
<p>to the intelligence of his audience and not to
their sentiment. The real power lay in the matter
of his speech and not in the manner. There were
no generalisations, no enunciation of abstract prin###ciples in flowery language. Every statement was clear
• and every point was driven home with a readiness
of illustration and power of antithesis that showed the
power of the speaker and the subtlety of his intellect.
Every issue was put plainly and uncompromisingly.
But there was no violence of language or denunciation,
not a trace of passion either in word or gesture. After
hearing him it was not difficult to understand that he
is the most powerful and the most influential leader of
the New Party, a party by no means confined to Ben###.gal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>150 LOKAMANYA TILAK</p>
<p>It is quite natural that when the Nation had, with
grim determination, undertaken to find its own salva###tion, the powers that be should try to put us down by
every means at their disposal. The Bureaucrats deter###mined to separate the Mahomedans from the Hindus,,
and the Moderates from the Extremists ; they resolved.
to replenish their armoury of repressive laws, to crush
the Extremists and break that solidarity which was
growing in various provinces. The Bureaucracy knew
that to placate Lord Morley they would have to give
their consent to the inauguration of a few political re###forms here and there ; so they practically entered into
a compact with the Liberal but too philosophical Secre###tary of State by means of which &rsquo; honest John * was to
acquiesce in their repression and they agreed to tole###rate political concessions. England had just concluded
an alliance with Japan ; our rulers had therefore noth###ing to fear from any complications abroad. They had
thus greater facilities to repress us than their succes###sors in 1914 and 1920, and so with ruthless severity
they tried the axe of repression on the tender plant of;
the National Movement.</p>
<p>The Swadeshi movement, with its watchwords of
self-help and self-government, powerfully affected the
imagination of the Indian student world. Students
became the greatest bulwark of the National agitation.
There were well-meaning persons who held that stu###dents ought to stand aloof from the public life of
the country. Even Mr. Gokhale, though willing to
allow students &quot; to take interests in what was going;
on around &quot; them was not in favour of allowing them to###take an active part even in the elementary work which.</p>
<p>THE NEW PARTY</p>
<p>151,3</p>
<p>neither breeds nor &quot; leads to dissension and disintegra###tion. &rsquo;&rsquo; Mr. Tilak, on the contrary emphatically held
that the &quot; students of to-day are the citizens of to###morrow &ldquo;and that it was their duty not only to study
public questions but to devote part of their leisure in
such work as was allotted to them by the trusted lea###ders of the country. Mr. Tilak said that though it was
convenient for the Bureaucracy to forget the part which
the youth of England played in the public life of
England, India must never neglect to train up her
youth in public spirit. If the Risley Circular was to
prevent free expression of thought in youth, if the Gov###ernment Servants&rsquo; Rules were to prohibit u? from
participating in public activities in manhood, and if the
Pensioners&rsquo; Code was to guide our actions in old-age^
when, indeed was a man independent ? Mr. Tilak
emphatically condemned the actions of those who, be###cause a particular student attended a swadeshi meeting,
fined him in the name of discipline ! If, he said, a severe
enforcement of false discipline be the price of our ac###ceptance of Government Grant or of the affiliation
with the University, why, in the name of patrio###tism and self-sacrifice should we not break off these
chains and declare our educational independence ?
He accepted the right of elders to guide the students.
But he refused to accept the right of any parent, much
less teacher, to cut off the light of knowledge and patri###otism from the school and college-going children ; and
when such a prohibition was made only because the
parent or teacher had not the courage to assert himself
before an unjustifiable fiat of the Bureaucracy, the stu###dents were, Mr. Tilak said, fully entitled to disobay.</p>
<p>j02 LOKAMANYA TILAK</p>
<p>The Students&rsquo; movement of 1905 was quite different
from the educational boycott of the Non-Co-operation
Propaganda of to-day. The Non-co-operator would
like to empty school and colleges, to mark his protest
against the ruinous system of administration. The
stimulus which the movement for National Education
received in the Anti-Partition days lay entirely in re###pression. In Bengal, where the student world was
harassed and persecuted, the movement of National
Education spread like wild fire, and within less than an
year since the movement was inaugurated, nearly
10,000 students enrolled their names in the National
Schools and colleges, directed by leaders of the Mode###rate Party like the late Dr. Rash Behari Ghose and the
late Sir Gurudas Banerjea. In Maharashtra, on the con###trary, repression being comparatively mild (1905-07),
there was less opportunity for National Education to
grow. The Samartha Vidyalaya established by Prof.
Bijapurkar and patronized by Mr. Tilak was a model
institution of its kind and would have shown very good
results had not the Government with one stroke of the
pen suppressed it (1910).</p>
<p>Mr. Tilak was immensely proud of the Mahomedans.
He was convinced that the community with its Impe###rialistic traditions had a great future before it. He was
certain that a combination of the Hindu intellect and
the Muslim valour (together with the Parsi enterprise)
would be irresistible and was bound to bring about the
downfall of the Bureaucracy. He was more afraid of
the Moslem inertia than of Moslem opposition. When,
therefore, Nabob Salli-Mulla Khan held (December
1906) an &quot; Educational Conference &quot; at Dacca and con-</p>
<p>THE NEW PARTY 153</p>
<p>verted it, at the eleventh hour into a Political League
to protest against the Boycott and Swadeshi move###ments, to uphold the Bengal Partition and to praise Sir
B. Fuller to the skies, Mr. Tilak was rather delighted
than vexed. He foretold that once the great Muslim
Community was aroused, it would outstrip the Hindus
in political demands. Of course, he severely con###demned the attitude of the Mahomedans on the occa###sion of the disturbances at Comilla and Jamalpur.
He fully approved of the Manifesto of fifteen Bengali
leaders including (the Hon&rsquo;ble Sir) Surendranath Ban###erjea which described how *&rsquo; Hindu shops have been
looted ; Hindu temples have been desecrated ; the
images of Hindu deities have been defiled ; the Cutche^
eries of Hindu Zemindars ransacked ; Hindu women
have been outraged &ldquo;; he condemned in scathing terms
officers and Mahomedans alike who were responsible for
this lawlessness. But he knew that a day would come
when the &quot; favourite wife of Sir B. Fuller &quot; would be
awakened to a full sense of her duty and would no
longer allow the Bureaucrats to &quot; Divide and Rule &rsquo;
us.</p>
<p>With the growing awakening in the Nation, the tide
of Repression began to rise. Lord Morley, from his
philosophical seat in the India Office was unable to
arrest either the one or the other. From his Presi###dential chair at Benares, Mr. Gokhale had told the
world how he &ldquo;felt towards Mr. Morley as towards a
Master &quot; and how his heart leapt &quot; with hope and fear &quot;
at the appointment of the Biographer of Gladstone to
India Office. Mr. Morley, so trusted and revered, did
SkOt hesitate in his budget Speech (June 1907) * reluc.</p>
<p>154 LOKAMANYA TILAK</p>
<p>/ tantly to call the Educated Indians as enemies. Tlic
student of Mill and Bright repeatedly declared &quot; so
long as my imagination could reach, India for a long
time to come, must continue to be the theatre of abso###lute and personal rule ;&rdquo; and yet the Moderates were
ready, nay, eager to welcome his reforms as being
&quot; generous and just !&rdquo;</p>
