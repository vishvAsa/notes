A man who is too ashamed to come&#xA;out of his room! Surely, one should feel sorry for any such creature and&#xA;pity his situation, right? But that doesn’t always happen. For empathy&#xA;is an emotion that is not absolute. It is relative and it corresponds to&#xA;what we know about that person, what he had done to evoke those pathos.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Shivaram Rajguru: The Lesser Known Of The Three Revolutionaries&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Snapshot&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The woman stood before the death row convict. The convict was a young man, dark complexioned, ordinary looking, bony faced and 5.5 feet tall. “Will you do one last favour to this sister?” she asked, her voice breaking. “Sure, sister, tell me!” he asked smiling. And she asked. “Will you show me those scars?”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Three revolutionaries became martyrs for Mother India, this very day in 1930. Of them Shivaram Rajguru is not as well known as Bhagat Singh. Of all the three, including Sukhdev Thapar, Bhagat Singh had charisma and one could say Rajguru had the least of it, physically. Yet this revolutionary was very different and his life at many places touches high poetry of sacrifice and inner strength.+++(5)+++&lt;/p&gt;</description>

He occupied Gaur or Lakhnaoti, the western capital of the Sena dynasty. He spent the next two years consolidating his new kingdom and divided it into several administrative units, each in charge of a Turk or Khilji commander. He built many mosques and madrasas and converted many Hindus to Islam.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Gandhi asked, &amp;ldquo;Why?&amp;rdquo; The woman said it was &amp;ldquo;against our religion.&amp;rdquo; Gandhi said, &amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t believe so.&amp;rdquo; The woman replied that we do not consider you worthy to order our religion. Gandhi said to take the vote of the people present there. &amp;ldquo;Can religion be determined by votes?&amp;rdquo; the woman asked. Gandhi responded, &amp;ldquo;You are hindering my religion.&amp;rdquo; The woman replied that he is illegally interfering in the religion of crores of Hindus. Gandhi said, &amp;ldquo;I listen to the Quran.&amp;rdquo; The woman said that she opposes it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Kshatriyas of Kerala belonged to Vishvamitra Gotra, so Kshatriya men and women never married each other as it will be sagotra union. Hence, Kshatriya women always married  Brahmins (non-Vishvamitra) and Kshatriya men including Maharajas married aristocratic Nair women. While the Kshatriya men could visit their Nair wives in their Tharavad, the Brahmin husbands of Kshatriya women stayed in their wife&amp;rsquo;s royal household since the wife had no place in husband&amp;rsquo;s Illam in matrilineal setup.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Deshpande S&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Indo-Iranian Journal 55 (2010)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Kṣatriyas in the Kali Age?&#xA;Gāgābhaṭṭa &amp;amp; His Opponents&#xA;Madhav M. Deshpande&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;abstract&#34;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This paper deals with the history of the disputes regarding the Kṣatriya status of the local ruler Shivāji and the Cāndrasenīya Kāyastha Prabhu (CKP) community of Maharashtra. The origin of these disputes lies in the wider dispute concerning whether there are any true Kṣatriyas in the Kali age. The CKPs of Maharashtra claimed to be Kṣatriyas and thus entitled for the rite of Upanayana, while the dominant regional Brahmin opinion was that they were śūdras and not entitled for the Upanayana. The dispute broke out a few years before Shivāji&amp;rsquo;s coronation, and to the discomfort of the local Brahmins, Gāgābhaṭṭa of Banaras settled it in favor of the Kāyasthas in his work, the Kāyasthadharmadipa. In decades after Shivāji&amp;rsquo;s death, the dispute broke out again, and within Maharashtra, gradually the Dharmaśāstric opinion shifted against the views of Gāgābhaṭṭa, and toward the end of the rule of the last Peshwa, this dispute was raised again by Nīlakaṇṭha śāstri Thatte in Pune against the Kāyasthas. I have traced the lineage of Nīlakaṇṭha Thatte, through his teacher Vaidyanātha Pāyagunde, to his teacher, the great Nāgeśabhaṭṭa of Banaras. Nāgeśabhaṭṭa produced his Vrātyatā-prāyascitta-nirṇaya at a śāstra-sabhā in Jaipur, where he argued that there were no pure Kṣatriyas surviving in the Kali age, and that the impure ones do not have the eligibility for Upanayana through some expiation. So the Kāyasthas could not claim to be genuine Kṣatriyas either. It was this opinion of Nāgeśabhaṭṭa, counter to the opinion of Gāgābhaṭṭa, that steadily gained popularity among the Pune Brahmins during the rule of the Peshwas, finally reflected in the activities of Nīlakaṇṭha Thatte.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&#34;https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1094442243333734400.html&#34;&gt;SK&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Greater India (which includes Pakistan and Bangladesh) is home to well over 1/5th of mankind. 23% of the world&amp;rsquo;s population. Yet this landmass does not hog as much attention of the world as it should. It remains an under-discussed, poorly understood region. Now the above tweet may raise two objections:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;a) Hey&amp;hellip;why do you think it is under-discussed? The word &amp;ldquo;India&amp;rdquo; gives 7.2B search results on Google&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;b) &amp;ldquo;Greater India&amp;rdquo;? Whatever is that? Isn&amp;rsquo;t that just a Hindu nationalist fantasy?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Let me address b. first. And then move to a. While &amp;ldquo;Greater India&amp;rdquo; is not an acceptable term in modern political discourse, it is not such a strange term if one takes a long view. The landmass bounded by Hindukush, Himalayas and the sea has always been viewed as &amp;ldquo;India&amp;rdquo; (NOT South Asia) for much of human history. A landmass that is not just geographically compact, but also culturally coherent. It is barely 7 decades ago that irreversible changes in religious demography at the edges caused a cleavage of this civilizational landmass into 2 and later 3 political units.&#xA;So having clarified b., Let&amp;rsquo;s move to a.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Maratha History as Polemic: Low Caste Ideology and Political Debate in Late Nineteenth-century&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Western India ROSALIND O&amp;rsquo;HANLON&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;University of Cambridge&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A STRIKING feature of Marathi vernacular literature towards the end of the nineteenth century lies in the sudden surge of interest in the Maratha warrior hero, Sivaji, and his feats of leadership in the great expansions of Maratha power that took place in the seventeenth century. Of all the work on Sivaji written at this time, the most familiar is probably Mahadev Govind Ranade&amp;rsquo;s Rise of the Maratha Power, published in 1900, in English. Besides this, there appeared in the last three decades of the century an unusually large number of Marathi works celebrating Sivaji&amp;rsquo;s exploits.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

This was ‘corroborated’ by a French translation book which says the temple was ‘demolished’ &amp;amp; converted into another place of worship, &amp;hellip;Thiruvannamalai is one of the big temples in TN &amp;amp; has kept records continuously. There was no record of such ‘demolishing’ &amp;amp; reconstruction. The architecture evidence also clearly points out that it is not the case. &amp;hellip;Does it mean the Durbar records quoted below is not true. I never said that. The entire thing is based on the assumption ‘Shonachalapathi’ is Thiruvannamalai main temple. That may not be true. There are many shrines around the Hill including a temple called as ‘Adi Annamalai’ temple.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Historian Manu Pillai revisits their legacy.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;stereotype&#34;&gt;Stereotype&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you look beyond the bejewelled figures, palaces and opulent courts, you&amp;rsquo;ll notice something telling about India&amp;rsquo;s maharajahs: that they have largely been scorned and mocked, or treated with voyeuristic curiosity.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Since all आदिशैव-s follow यजुर्वेद, their अब्राह्मण disciples will adopt the thread in line with the date of यजुर्वेद-उपाकर्मा (उपाकर्मा—annual renewal of one’s द्विजत्वम् &amp;amp; the commitment to what that entails; now often seen as mere changing of thread).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Internal Structure of the Nayar Caste&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Author(s): C. J. Fuller&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Source:, Vol. 31, No. 4 (Winter, 1975), pp. 283-312&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Published by: University of New Mexico&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Stable URL: &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.jstor.org/stable/3629883&#34;&gt;http://www.jstor.org/stable/3629883&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The matrilineal Nayars of Kerala in southwest India constitute a populous caste, which&#xA;contains within it a large number of subdivisions. In contrasto the ideal model, on which&#xA;most standard descriptions appear to be based, these subdivisions fall into several analytically&#xA;distinguishable categories. There is a core of a few large, stable subdivisions and afringe of&#xA;many small, unstable subdivisions. The latter are created and eliminated by several processes,&#xA;one of which, treated in detail, is connected to the famous, hypergamous marriage system of&#xA;the Nayars. The statuses of tali-tiers and sambandham partners act as diacritical markers&#xA;of a subdivision&amp;rsquo;s status. Modern changes in the subdivision system are briefly considered A&#xA;distinction between stable and unstable statuses in the caste system is introduced, and doubt is&#xA;raised about Dumont&amp;rsquo;s and Pocock&amp;rsquo;s theories of caste.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Meaning of Raja&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Many Lord-Tier (in European sensibility) Hindu Rulers used the title Raja.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Its use has been mocked by many neech quibblers.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Raja IS equated to the European Rex-King but note that it does NOT precisely mean that in Hindu Context.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;purana-s&#34;&gt;purANa-s&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Our Shastras provide context.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;प्रजासु च &lt;strong&gt;विरक्तासु&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;राज्यकामदुघासु वै ।&#xA;कृच्छ्रेणोपार्जितो &lt;strong&gt;ऽपार्थो&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;राजशब्दो &lt;strong&gt;भविष्यति&lt;/strong&gt; ॥&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Bereft of the attachment of the subjects (their presence as a key factor), the title Raja (thus in context, Delighter of Subjects) acquired with very great difficulty, shall become meaningless.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Author: Someone named rudrAgni on social media.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;summary&#34;&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My position on this whole thing is that Akbar, was an individual born with a tremendous vital &amp;amp; spiritual force, but being so full of life and power, he felt a tremendous dissatisfaction with the religious tradition that he was born in, as it was a religion that suppresses life instead of nurturing it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Whether it be destruction of beautiful idols &amp;amp; temples, that were created with skill, patience &amp;amp; hardwork, or killing and raping more accomplished and more beautiful people than oneself, Islam +++(he encountered)+++ is full of resentment against the healthy. It&amp;rsquo;s a mental disease that seeks to infect the mentally sane out of nothing but jealousy.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Some justifications are given for this invention including the &amp;lsquo;claim&amp;rsquo; that Jatila was not named Varaguna. It is claimed that a Rajasimha II was the son of Jatila Parantaka while a Varaguna I was son of Rajasimha II. Larger Sinnamanur Plates (LSP) are given as evidence for this. Let us look at the evidence in detail.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Source: &amp;ldquo;Mysore Modern: Rethinking the Region Under Princely Rule&amp;rdquo; by Janaki Nair&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Actual conversion took much longer. The 1675 inscription referred to earlier was composed by none other than Tirumalarya, the promi- nent poet of Chikkadevaraja&amp;rsquo;s reign, who encouraged this conversion. The Srimanmaharajara Vamshavali reports that under the influence of “Brahmin Pradhan Tirumala Iyengar” (Tirumalarya), the Ursu clan exc sively adopted the Vaishnava faith and attempted to repudiate all links when Saivism, which was associated with Sudras.&amp;quot; Thirteen upper-caste Ursu families took a pledge of allegiance to Vishnu and adopted the five acha- ras (types of conduct or behaviors) and related practices of Kshatriyas: &amp;ldquo;[Although we had] taken birth among the loftiest of kshatriyas, devotees of the Lotus Feet of the Lord, without understanding this faith, and out of ignorance abandoning our caste traditions, and in violation of the four varnashrama acharas [observance of caste customs], [we] became adher- ents of the religion of the Sudras, Saivism, [and] gave and took women in violation of caste norms.&amp;ldquo;12 Before long, the thirteen families pleaded that they be allowed to resume, alongside their new sectarian allegiance, the worship of their kula devatas (clan or family deities), whose neglect after their conversion had caused new hardships.13&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The establishment and maintenance of it depended heavily upon armed power, as violence is the ultimate denominator of power, especially in a place as unstable as the North Indian plain.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
