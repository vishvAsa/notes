While we know about the Satavahanas, Kakatiyas and Vijayanagara Empires, there have been other smaller, medium kingdoms in Telugu states of which not many have an idea. This thread takes a look at them. 

## Assaka
One of the more ancient Telugu dynasties, existing around 700–300 BCE. Considered to be one of the 16 Mahajanapadas, it was located in the region between Godavari and Manjeera rivers, and the only one South of Vindyas, it's capital is believed to be Bodhan in TG.

## Andhra Ikshavakus
Primarily located in the Krishna-Guntur-Nalgonda region, they were situated along the Godavari-Krishna rivers. Their capital was Vijayapuri, which is current day Nagarajunakonda. And it’s believed they were related to the fabled Ikshavakus dynasty. They ruled primarily around 2nd Century BCE.

## Ananda Gotrika

Ruled over Coastal Andhra, between 335–425 AD, from Kapotapuram, now currently in Guntur district.

## Shalankayanas

Ruled between 300 to 440 CE, from Vengi( currently Pedavegi near Eluru in West Godavari dt). They were Brahmins basically, and their gotra name refers to Nandi. It was during their time, that Telugu came up with a distinctive script.

## Vishnukundinas

This was one of the larger kingdoms, which existed between 420–624 AD, and it’s capital was at Eluru and later Amaravati. It came to an end with the conquest by Chalukyan ruler Pulakeshin II. Their greatest ruler was Madhava Varma II, under whom it expanded along entire Coastal Andhra, and he also conducted Asvamedha, Rajasuya yagnas. They had a very good administrative system, and were great patrons of art and architecture. The famous Undavalli caves near Vijayawada, were built during the reign of Vishnukundinas.

## Eastern Chalukyas

This was actually derived from the Badami Chalukyas, founded by Pulakesin’s brother Vishnuvardhana, who was the Governor of the Vengi reigon. They claimed to be of Chandravamsha descent and ruled between 624–1189 AD. They ruled from Vengi and later Rajamahendravaram( aka Rajahmundry). Again known for their administration and a Republican form of Government. Telugu literature came into it’s own during this period, with Nannaya writing the first part of Andhra Mahabharatamu. The famous Shaivite shrines at Draksharama and Bhimarama( Samalkot) were built during Eastern Chalukyas reign. As also the Biccavolu temples.

## Kota Vamsa

Ruled between 9th and 12th century AD, over the Guntur and Velanadu regions between the Krishna and Pennar rivers. Not much is really known of them.

## Chagis

Claiming to be Suryavanshi Kshatriyas, ruled primarily in South Coastal Andhra between Nellore and Krishna districts. They had capitals at Gudimetta (Prakasam), Vinukonda (Guntur) and ruled for nearly 350 years.

## Velanati Chodas
Ruled between 11th-13th century, vassals of the Cholas and Western Chalukyas. Primarily ruled over the Godavari-Krishna region. In a way they also influenced that region’s culture, and were great patrons of art and architecture.

## Musunuri Nayaks
They were basically the warrior chieftains in Kakatiya empire, and formed their own independent kingdom after the fall of the Kakatiyas. Their greatest ruler was Musunuri Kapayya Nayak who recaptured Warangal from the Tughlaqs and ruled over there. The Musunuri Nayaks were succeeded by Recharla Nayaks, who were dominant in Telangana during the 14th century. They ruled primarily from Devarakonda and Rachakonda in Nalgonda district. 

Initially they were allied with the Bahmani Sultans against the Reddy Rajulu of Coastal Andhra who were with the Vijayanagara Empire. However following a split, the Kondavidu Reddy Rulers allied with the Bahmanis, and the Recherlas switched to Vijayanagara Empire.

## Ravella Nayakas
Vassals of the Vijayanagara Empire, it was made up primarily of the Nayakas who served under Musunuri Kapeeneedu, and they were considered one of the finest warriors in the Vijayanagara Army.

## Sayapaneni Nayakas
One of the 37 Kamma Nayaka clans, they too served the Vijayanagara Kingdom, in 16th century. Ruling primarily from Dupatiseema, they went into decline after the fall of Vijayanagara.

## Pemmasani Nayakas
Ruling from the historic fort of Gandikota, they were one of the greatest warrior clans ever. Reigning between 14th and 17th centuries, they also controlled the forts of Gutthi and Yadaki. Known for their prowess on the battle field, they served consecutively as commanders to the Vijayanagara Empire. Their greatest leader was Pemmasani Ramalinga Nayaka who led the Vijayanagara Army to one of it’s greatest victories ever at Raichur under Sri Krishna Deva Raya.

## Suryadevara Nayakas
Ruling from Repalle in Guntur district, they were also noted for their prowess on the battle field. They served the Vijayanagar Kingdom and fought in various campaigns for it.

## Reddy Dynasty
One of the larger dynasties in Andhra, again not known much outside the Telugu states. Ruled between 1325–1448, it was founded by Prolaya Vema Reddy at Addanki in Prakasam district. They ruled primarily over Coastal Andhra and parts of Rayalaseema. At their zenith, it stretched from Cuttack in North to Kanchi down South and up to Srisailam. The capital was later moved to Kondavidu and Rajamahendravaram. They built two really impregnable forts at Kondavidu(Guntur dt) and Kondapalli( Krishna dt). They later came under the control of Vijayanagara, and were known for their generous grants to Brahmins and Vedic scholars. Prolaya Vema Reddy built a number of Agraharas for Brahmins all across Coastal Andhra. The famous Narasimha Temple at Ahobilam was built by them. It was one of the best periods for Telugu and Sanskrit literature. Most of the Reddy rulers themselves were distinguished authors and scholars.

## Great empires
Satavahana, Kakatiya and of course Vijayanagar being the 3 great empires of the Telugu states, would need a separate thread by themselves. This was on the smaller and not as well known kingdoms in Telugu states.
