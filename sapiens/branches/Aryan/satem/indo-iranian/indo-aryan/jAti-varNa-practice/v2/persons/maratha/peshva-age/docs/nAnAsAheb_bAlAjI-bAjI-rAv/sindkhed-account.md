Nana Purandare to Balwantrao Mehendale describing the battle of Sindkhed 29 December, 1757 (Gregorian)

The Mughal (Nizam) marched out with his vanguard. Baburao Fadnis was the Karbhari, but was unwell. He eventually left as he felt he could not be of use. The same day, the Mughal army was sighted. Our artillery batteries were in position, and we fired 5 to 7 volleys. Along with cannons, we also bombarded them with rockets. Gopalrao Patwardhan was on my right wing. Left wing was Malharrao Raste, and center was Mahipatrao Kavde.

At this point, the Mughal army made junction with Jadhavrao's army. Among our forces, Dattaji Shinde's Bhoite, Wable, and the Huzurat's Atole, Borge, were already at Sindkhed since a month. They had laid siege to Jadhavrao and not allowed him any relief. Jadhavrao had sought refuge here. Finding their approach unsuitable, the next day, the Mughal army repositioned itself, and we redeployed our artillery accordingly and opened fire. The artillery was placed along the entire front of the line, with infantry behind it. On the right flank, Dattaji covered us with his cavalry. The left side was covered by hills, and we placed some guns there.

We kept up steady fire of roundshot from our artillery, and the Nizam found it unbearable. The Nizam ordered his infantry forward. Leaving their artillery behind, Ibrahim Khan Gardi, led the center with around 5k infantry forward and marched straight for our cannons. On their approach, the gaps between the guns were filled with infantry and we prepared to meet their advance. On the right, Dattaji was engaged first, with Gardis in the first line, and Nimbalkar's infantry behind. They formed a square against our cavalry and opened fire. We returned fire with equal intensity. Both of us took a heavy fire.

Our cavalry made several attempts but they held their ground. This engagement lasted for 4-5 ghataks (about 2 hours). Dattaji's men attempted to break them 2 or 3 times but they held firm. By this time, they were on the verge of giving up. They had taken about 300-500 men and 200 horses dead. Our losses were fewer. Their infantry retired from the field, we held our positions. An envoy from the Nizam arrived in our camp.

Negotiations continued for 2 weeks. The Nizam agreed to cede territory with a revenue of 25 lakhs. We settled on the specific Parganas, and acquired Naldurg fort as well. This was confirmed on Margashirsha Chaturthi. Similar to Bhalki, Vishwasrao met the Nizam afterwards. Nimbalkar and Shahnawaz Khan were not present. The Nizam's diwan Vithal Sundar and Bajad Ali khan were present. This was Vishwasrao's first battle. He did well, may he gain more victories.
