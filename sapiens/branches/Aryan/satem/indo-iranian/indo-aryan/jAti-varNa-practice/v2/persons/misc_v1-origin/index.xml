He used to wake up at 2 am and do a complete reading of Sri Durga Saptasati sitting on his bed. After that, he would complete his bath and complete Vaidika Sandhyāvandana along with sahasra Gāyatrī japa.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Thereafter, he would offer pindadāna with approximately 40 kilograms of rice. He then would complete the daily worship of Pārthiva Shivalinga and then proceed to the temple of Goddess Bhagavatī. Here, he would perform the Tantrika Sandhyāvandana and do the pātrasthāpana according to the Tantras. He would then proceed to worship Goddess Mahākālī through āvaraṇa pūjā, japa, pancānga patha and then offer puspanjali along with Kakārādi Sahasranama. He then performed the pūjā and tarpaṇa of Kumarī, Suvāsini and Vatuka, followed by sāmayika pūjā. He would partake the Mahāprasāda and be ready by 10.00 am.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
