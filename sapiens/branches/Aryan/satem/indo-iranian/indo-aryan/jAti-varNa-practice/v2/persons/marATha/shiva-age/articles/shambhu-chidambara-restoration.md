Was watching the trailer of 'Chhaava', showing the history of Sambhaji maharaj. During the turbulant times, Sambhaji's contribution to Tamilagam, especially Tamil Shaivam is worth noting.

As per a copper plate inscription at Thiruvarar, Nataraja of Chidambaram left his abode on 24th December 1648. This was apparently due to the continued threats from the Bijapur Sultanate. The murthy was taken to Madurai, then to Kudumiyanmalai and was hidden there. The temple rituals and poojas took a pause during this time.

After 37 years, Sambhaji Maharaj took efforts to bring back Nataraja from Kudumiyanmalai. With the help of his Guru, Muthaiya Dikshitar, he did the consecration of the temple and installed Nataraja again in the Ponnambalam. His official, Gopala Dadasi was the one who looked after the ceremony.

This is the box in which Nataraja was taken to these places and was hidden, till Sambhaji brought the murthy back to Chidambaram. The copper plate has a beautiful Tamil verse which details these events.

விடையில்வந்த செம்பொன்அம் பலத்தான் அந்த
வெள்ளியம் பலத்திலே விரும்பிச் சென்ற
நடையில்வந்த வருடமோ சர்வ தாரி
நாயபமார் கழியிருபத் தைந்து நாளாம்
கடையில்வந்த வருடங்கார்த் திகையீ ரேழு
கதிர்வாரம் திரும்பவந்து கலந்த நாளாம்
இடையில்வந்த வருடமெண்ணிப் பார்க்கில் முப்பத்
தேழுபத்து மாதநாள் இருப தாமே !

Nataraja left Chidambaram during Sarvadhari year Margazhi month and returned after thirty seven years during the month of Karthigai, says the verse. Tamilagam should forever remember Sambhaji for this dharmic contribution.
