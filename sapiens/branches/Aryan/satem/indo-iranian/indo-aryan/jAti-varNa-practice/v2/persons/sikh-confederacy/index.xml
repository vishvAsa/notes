      <description>&lt;p&gt;bandA bairAgI bahAdur&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Some say he was rAjaputra. Others say  a janeudhari Mohyal (Ayachak Brahmin) of Bharadwaj gotra. He took up sannyAsa for inadvertently killing a pregnant deer in violation of the dharmashAstra-s, returned to the sword and gRhasthAshrama propelled by guru govinda-simha (while staunchly retaining his vegetarian vaiShNava base), avenged the guru, withstood torture, saw his one year killed and his liver stuffed into his mouth, refused to convert, and died. He never fully became an &amp;ldquo;sikh&amp;quot;ularist.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;After Gulab Singh his son, Maharaja Ranbir Singh, occupied the throne of Jammu and Kashmir. People remember him as an ideal Hindu king because of his interest in Hindutva, Sanskrit and the Indian culture. He opened many centres for the teaching and study of Sanskrit, built libraries and made efforts for re-establishing the values of Hindu life. Under the guidance of this Maharaja a Dharmarth Trust was set up for the construction of many temples. As a result of these efforts a wave of Hindutva swept the state. The Hindu society too started to get up and the people of Kashmir became impatient in restoring to the state its ancient glory.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;zorAvar siMha the intrepid Dogra general, a kalhuria rAjaputra of the mountains, who solidly conquered Ladhak and Baltistan, repulsed the Tibetans and Chinese, and forced his way in pilgrimage to mAnasasarovara and kailAsa, reached the nepAla border and died fighting Tibetans on his way back (&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zorawar_Singh_Kahluria&#34;&gt;wiki&lt;/a&gt;). So honest that &amp;ldquo;he would transfer to his master any gifts or tribute that came to him.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;</description>
