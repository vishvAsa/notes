      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;horse&#34;&gt;Horse&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Horse cavalry grants great military advantages - see &lt;a href=&#34;https://vishvAsa.github.io/notes/notes/history/military/horse/military-advantage/&#34;&gt;horse page&lt;/a&gt; for details.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;India simply didn&amp;rsquo;t have any answer to grand cavalry forces. Battle of Agincourt was fought in a place where archers held advantage due to topography. English were helped by topography in most places. Indian northern plains and Bengal had rarely such topographical advantages. Which is why Rajputana hill states, Orissa and Assam (with mountains and low water table + vegetation) survived better while the plains lost. Orissa finally was lost due to being weakened by Vijayanagara wars.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In recent times, many have succumbed to the British manipulative theories such as (MT&amp;rsquo;s analysis &lt;a href=&#34;https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2011/10/09/yuddha-vyuha-s-mlechcha-s-and-vanija-niti-in-the-last-hindu-empire/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;generally effeminate nature of Hindus (relative to vigorous Muhammadan-s and Europeans)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;military-discipline&#34;&gt;Military discipline&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Firing by rank&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;MT: &amp;ldquo;This culture of using the long-bow had already inculcated in the Hindus the precursor to the principle of fire by ranks – indeed Indian texts have long described the constant showers of arrows maintained by different kinds of archers in large scale combats. &amp;hellip; From the marAtha sources and reconstructing the events from the account of the French spy Francois Martin we see that a preliminary form of firing by rank was probably used by the marATha-s during shivAjI’s massive attack on Gingee. The Frenchman’s account indicates that the marATha-s maintained a continuous small arms fire along with heavy artillery fire which was heard as far as Pondicherry. &amp;hellip; The marATha-s used this effectively against the British in the battle of Aligarh, where they killed several English officers by shooting them from behind the treeline with some of the best long barreled flintlocks of the age.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
