The story of Chhatrapati Sambhaji raping a Brahmin Ministerâ€™s daughter was fabricated by the Dutch. There is not a single contemporary evidence supporting this. Portraying the Chhatrapati as an anti-Brahmin is the most foolish claim that anyone can make.

> K S T used that story in his book to forward his agenda

K S T was a CKP. Their hate for Sambhajiraje is well-known since the days of the Malhar Ramrao Chitnis.
