While the H came back in the north under the shinde and the sikh power grew rapidly in the northwestern reaches of the core Indosphere, one could make a case that Panipat-3 left a lasting structural damage that through a long chain of downstream events weakened the marAThA war machine. Barring the effort of the shinde-s, it seems to have made the marAThA-s fall back on time-tested mobile tactics that could yield immediate results but would not hold against a well-disciplined force with strong artillery elements (shinde understood this point well):  the times were changing under their feet as the late 1700s drew to a close. One could compare it to the last Mongol efforts to save the Qing, as the descendants of Chingiz Khan's brother Qasar valiantly led mobile cavalry assaults: they could only go that far in face of disciplined formations with good arti support. In many ways, I think bAjIrav-I was like Chingiz or Subedei reborn for one final time in jambudvIpa before nirvANa. His success in at cusp of the changing times influenced his successors to continue with such tactics after the setback at Panipat.

I know people will vehemently disagree, but testing historical hypotheses is not always easy.
