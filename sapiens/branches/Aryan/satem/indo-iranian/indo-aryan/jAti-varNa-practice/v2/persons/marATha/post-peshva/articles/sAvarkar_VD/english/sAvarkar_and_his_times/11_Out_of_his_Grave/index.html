The World War I terminated in 1918 and soon after a systematic and persistent propaganda was carried on through- out the country for the release of all political prisoners. People, popular leaders and the Press voiced their demand for the release of political prisoners through petitions, meet- ings, Conferences, Congress Sessions and in Coimcils. The National Union of Bombay, Sri Anantrao Gadre, Senapati Bapat and Sri Shivrampant Paranjpe took a leading part in collecting signatures of the people on the petition and the great petition was forwarded to Mr. Montagu, the Secretary of State for India. The Secretary of State for India rejected it. The Amritsar Congress demanded the release of all political prisoners by a special resolution. The District Home Rule Leagues from Maharashtra, too, wired to the Viceroy demanding the release of the Savarkar brothers. The royal proclamation in connection with the royal clemency to political prisoners issued on December 24, 1919, stated in clear terms ; “ I therefore direct my Viceroy to exercise in My name and on My behalf My Royal clemency to political prisoners in the fullest measure which, in his judgment, is compatible with public safety. I desire to extend it on this condition to persons who, for offences against the State or imder any special or emergency legislation are suffering imprisonment or restriction upon their liberty.”">

<p>The World War I terminated in 1918 and soon after a
systematic and persistent propaganda was carried on through-
out the country for the release of all political prisoners.
People, popular leaders and the Press voiced their demand
for the release of political prisoners through petitions, meet-
ings, Conferences, Congress Sessions and in Coimcils. The
National Union of Bombay, Sri Anantrao Gadre, Senapati
Bapat and Sri Shivrampant Paranjpe took a leading part in
collecting signatures of the people on the petition and the
great petition was forwarded to Mr. Montagu, the Secretary
of State for India. The Secretary of State for India rejected
it. The Amritsar Congress demanded the release of all
political prisoners by a special resolution. The District Home
Rule Leagues from Maharashtra, too, wired to the Viceroy
demanding the release of the Savarkar brothers. The royal
proclamation in connection with the royal clemency to
political prisoners issued on December 24, 1919, stated in clear
terms ; “ I therefore direct my Viceroy to exercise in My
name and on My behalf My Royal clemency to political
prisoners in the fullest measure which, in his judgment, is
compatible with public safety. I desire to extend it on this
condition to persons who, for offences against the State or
imder any special or emergency legislation are suffering
imprisonment or restriction upon their liberty.”</p>
<p>According to this proclamation all provincial Governments
opened the gates of their prisons. Many political and ordinary
prisoners were set free from provincial jails and the Cellular
Jail too. Even those who had come after Savarkar or were
his co-prisoners were released, but the Government of India
held Savarkar’s release incompatible with public safety. In
his case all rules were literally and strictly, and many a time
xinjustly, enforced. Ordinary prisoners were allowed to settle</p>
<p>142 SAVARKAR AKD HIS TIMES</p>
<p>on the Island after five years’ imprisonment, but the Savarkar
brothers were singled out as an exception to this rule even
after ten years. All hard-skinned convicts were given light
work, but the soft-skinned Savarkars were given the hardest
possible work from the beginning. After eight long years
Government permitted Dr. N. D. Savarkar to see his brothers
in the Cellular Jail. Savarkar’s wif^ and Dr. Savarkar saw
him in the last week of May 1919. The Savarkar brothers
were startled to find the absence of Srimati Yashodabai, wife
of Babarao Savarkar. The struggling flame of her noble life
had flickered away just two months ago ! And Yashoda
Vahini was to Savarkar his earliest friend, his sister, liis
mother and his comrade — all in one, all at once. She really
died as dies a satee ! Deserted by all relatives, cursed as the
wife of a convict by unpatriotic persons, separated from her
husband, crushed by overwhelming grief, she perished in her
unconscious state with the only thought of the Darshan of her
husband. Another lady, Savarkar ever remembered with
grateful tributes, was Madame Cama who had been a second
mother to his younger brother and stood so nobly and so
faithfully by them in the darkest hour of their life. “ At the
touch of one such faithful, noble, unshaken, loving hand,”
wrote Savarkar, “ one’s heart recovers its belief in Humanity
— belief rudely shaken by the disappearance of the closest
and by the treachery of the truest and by the indifference of
the dearest.” The above-cited interview terminated in an
hour in the presence of the jail authorities, Savarkar being
given some time to speak to his wife separately.</p>
<p>As regards other facilities, Savarkar was given the work
of a clerk and afterwards was allowed to work as the foreman
of the oil-depot and department in the latter part of 1920.
The authorities even allowed him to enjoy at times the
moonlit nights and starlit dawn which he loved so immensely,
in the jail yard with his brother Ganeshpant alias Babarao !
Barrie, who expected to see the bones of Savarkar in the
Andamans, had gone away to lay his bones in safety as he
feared that any one of Savarkar’s followers might blow up
his head in India !</p>
<p>At last the heavy brunt Savarkar bore all along for his
co-sufferers, the rigorous work, imhealthy food, crushing</p>
<p>OVTOFHXSGRAVS 143</p>
<p>anxieties, sapping climate, and the monotonous dreary and
insipid life told upon his nerves. He reached the lowest point
of vitality and was reduced to a skeleton. Chronic dysentery
and diverse other ailments thoroughly invalidated him. He
was, at last, taken to the jail hospital for treatment where
tuberculosis of the lungs was suspected. Till the appearance
of such a crisis in his health, for months he was sinking for
want of medical help and hospital diet. For want of milk he
wetted his rice with simple water. Half-boiled, half-cooked
food he no longer could digest, His brother, Babarao, who
was allowed at this stage to cook for himself, sent him ‘ Dal ’
secretly. But the malady was developing into a dangerous
form. Later, however, in the hospital he was given milk
when he could not digest it ! His diet dwindled to a sip of
milk. His body burnt with constant fever. He grew deli-
rious, often fell into dead faints and was troubled with
hallucinations. Forlorn, forsaken though not forgotten, he
was rotting, w&rsquo;ithering and pining awa3&rsquo; in a lonely corner of
the hospital, banned and barred from his near and dear ones
and surrounded by unsympathetic elements. Now death
began to hover over his head.</p>
<p>Yet with a peaceful mind and composed feelings of a true
yogin Savarkar invoked death. He was content with liis
achievements in life. He had seen the world, done his duty
and acted in great events heroically. If the end of life was the
passage to another world-heaven, then he was sure of a
reserved place there as he had testimonials from Lord Krishna
for having done his duty for duty’s sake and if the end of life
was to dissolve the composition of all elements, he was
prepared to immerse them in the Universal oneness !
Wordsworths and Tennysons and Tagores would sing the glory
of these self-experienced true feelings ! Such is the grandeur,
loftiness and piousness of these thoughts !</p>
<p>The jail life of any other Indian leader pales into insigni-
ficance before this horrible tale of Savarkar’s life in the
Cellular Jail. Lokmanya Tilak suffered most, but was at least
enlivened by the availability of writing material, help of a
cook and a special little house. Not to speak of those who
were speechless and peaceless even in ‘ A ’ class rich rooms !
And yet imbending, upright, and exemplary, Savarkar faced</p>
<p>144 SAVABKAR AND HIS TIMES</p>
<p>jail life with great fortitude. He agitated but within the four
corners of the law; he acted resolutely, but skilfully, and
reformed the jail life. At times he had to face mistmder-
standing among his colleagues. But he persuaded them to
realize the facts. Never did he speak ill of his colleagues, not
even of Barrie who inhumanly troubled him. All political
prisoners had respect for Savarkar. The convicts regarded
him as God. His spirit, soul and energy were of a deathless
stamp. Almost all the political prisoners from the Andamans
with rare exceptions bade good-bye to political life after-
wards. Bhai Parmananda and Sri Ashutosh Lahiri who
respectively spent four and seven years in the Cellular Jail
were the shining exceptions ! The permanent effect of this
jail life was seen later in Savarkar’s health, lonely deport-
ment, and his aloofness from the society.</p>
<p>During the two years 1920 and 1921 the release of political
prisoners was still more persistently demanded by Indian
leaders and Indian Press. Sri Vithalbhai Patel raised the
question in the Central Assembly. Sri Dadasahib Khaparde,
while supporting Patel, referred to the cases of the Savarkar
brothers in 1920. Tilak wrote a letter to Mr. Montagu urging
the release of Savarkar. In May 1920 even Gandhiji, stating
that the ‘ cult of violence had, at the present moment, no
following in India,’ wrote in his Young India in favour of the
release of the Savarkar brothers. Bhai Parmananda, after his
release, saw Colonel Wedgewood then travelling in India and
the Labour leader, on his return home, took up the cudgels
on tlieir behalf and expressed the terrible conditions in the
Andamans through the British Press in January and
February 1921. The Rev. C. F. Andrews, too, took up the
cause and wrote a series of articles demanding the release of
the prisoners of the Andamans. Savarkar’s letters from the
Andamans were printed and published in all provincial
organs and given wide publicity. People and leaders were
moved to read the letters. Meantime Dr. Savarkar paid a
second visit to see his brother’s health in the year 1920.</p>
<p>At this juncture the Cardew Committee that had been to
the Andamans for surveying the conditions in jail submitted
its report to the Government of India and consequently
Government decided to close the Andamans settlement.</p>
<p>OUT or HIS CRAVE 145</p>
<p>Savarkar propagated even at the risk of creating temporary
misunderstanding that the colony should be fully developed
and hence prisoners should not express their willingness to go
and rot in Indian jails, rather they should develop and bring
the colony to prosperity.</p>
<p>In 1920 Gandhiji started his non-violent non-co-operation
movement in India. Swaraj was to be won within a year.
Savarkar attacked the queer definitions of non-violence and
truth and emphasized that the Khilafat would prove an
‘ affai ’ — a calamity.^ Under the influence of this movement
some underground revolutionary leaders were inveigled into
appearing before the police and the result was that more
revolutionary leaders were exiled into the Andamans.
Savarkar told his colleagues that the end of politics was
neither co-operation nor non-co-operation. It always hinged
on responsive co-operation ; the goal of humanity was mutual
co-operation, he added.^</p>
<p>In March 1921 the Hon. Sri K. V. Rangaswamy Iyengar,
Member of the Council of State, moved a resolution in the
House that the Savarkar brothers be released. But it was of
no avail. Sri Iyengar said that he was ready to stand security
for Savarkar to assure Government of his good intentions and
honest motives. In the previous month the ‘ D ’ ticket was
removed from Savarkar’s chest.</p>
<p>At last came the day of Savarkar’s return to his beloved
Motherland. The unexpected happened. There was a stir
among the prisoners and the people aU over the island.
Savarkar was overwhelmed with feelings at the thought of
leaving those poor and patriotic hearts. Some of them
stealthily or with the connivance of the guards garlanded him !
Before bidding good-bye to the anxious and devotional faces,
Savarkar gave the sacred oath to the chosen few : —</p>
<p>One God, one country, one goal,</p>
<p>One race, one life, one language.</p>
<p>And Oh ! Look here he crossed out the ferocious gates of
the Andamans amidst the indistinct greetings from his co-
suflerers ! London could not captivate him, Morea could not</p>

<p>10</p>
<p>146 SAVARKAS AND HIS TIMES</p>
<p>carry Kim and the Andamans could not suppress him. The
Mother must feed him. What a ray of hope, a sigh of relief,
and a flash of emotion must have overcome the brothers !
The Savarkar brothers were brought in the steamer s.s.
MAHARAJAH, the Same steamer that had carried them to the
Deathland, and here Savarkar started on his voyage back to
India with his elder brother ! On board the ship a European
Officer presented Savarkar his favourite book, Thomas A
Kempis’ Imitation of Christ. On the fourth day they caught
sight of India ! Savarkar exclaimed, “ Behold Baba, the feet of
Mother Bharat washed by the blue waters of the ocean.” So
saying they reverentially bowed their heads and shouted,
“ Hail Thee Goddess of Liberty ! Bande Mataram ! ” The
same unflinching love for Mother India even after such a great
ordeal !</p>
<p>II</p>
<p>On their arrival the Savarkars were taken to the Alipore
Jail. Savarkar was already a name to conjure with. A
Chinese youth rotting in that Jail asked him whether any
bullet could harm him, for he had heard many romantic
stories about Savarkar. Savarkar replied that a bullet must
pierce him ! One policeman asked Savarkar how many days
he had swum in the ocean ! “ Not more than ten minutes,”</p>
<p>said Savarkar. Those artless simple believing souls got angry
with Savarkar for belittling his own story ! Savarkar belongs
to the line of rationalists and not to that of mystics and hence
he never made capital of his matchless exploits.</p>
<p>No sooner did they arrive in the Alipore jail than the
Savarkars were hit below the belt by the Capital, an Anglo-
Indian journal of Calcutta. ‘ Ditchar,’ writing in the Capital,
alleged that the Savarkar brothers had conspired with the
Germans. Messrs. Manilal and Kher, Solicitors of Bombay,
acting on behalf of the Savarkar brothers, extracted an
unconditional apology from ‘ Ditchar ’ and the Capital.</p>
<p>From Alipore the brothers were separated, Babarao being
taken to Bijapur Jail from which he was released after a
serious crisis in his health in 1922. Savarkar was taken to
the Ratnagiri jail via Bombay. There the same rotation and</p>
<p>OUT OF HIS GRAVE</p>
<p>147</p>
<p>repetition of the rigours awaited him. What facilities he had
secured in the Andamans were now lost. The monotony and
insipid life once again drove him to throw away life, but he
bridled his feelings and regained his balance at nightfall.</p>
<p>In the Ratnagiri Jail Savarkar came into contact with
Khilafat prisoners and Gandhian truth-seekers. Though
brought secretly, they persisted in reading the papers openly
as devotees of Truth, and secured eatables through secret
illegal sources and ate them stealtliily. Their perverted brains
did not mind, they said, if all Hindus became Moslems but
they wanted Swaraj which was now a fact in sight attainable
in a few months’ time. The Kliilafat Pathans in the Ratnagiri
Jail rioted and the Hindu prisoners were saved as they were
forewarned by Savarkar. It was in the Ratnagiri Jail that
Savarkar’s immortal work Hinduiva was written and sent out
secretly and was published under the pen name ‘ Mahratta
The whole movement for Hindu Nation and Hindu polity
is based on this book of Savai&rsquo;kar. Indeed, this book will bear
out the truth that if there be any political leader in
India who stands on a firm, far-reaching, profoimd, clear-cut,
well-defined and momentous political philosophy, it is
Savarkar alone. Some of his contemporaries looked to the
mystic fads of their inner voices and others acted as
messengers of Russian imperialism. The last chapters of this
book are typically Savarkarian in grandeur, profundity, and
eloquence. The poetical genius that produced the epic poetry
shines through the pages of the book with eloquent reason
and looks for a gleaming future ! This was the need of the
hour, the prescription of an expert doctor ! Reading the signs
of the times, Savarkar timely pointed out the ulcer that was
growing and vitiating the health of Hindusthan. The book
inspired the saintly soul of Swami Shraddhananda and he
exclaimed : “ It must have been one of those Vedic dawns
indeed which inspired our seers with new truths, that revealed
to the author of Hindutva this ‘ Mantra ’, this definition of
Hindutva ! ”</p>
<p>Moved by the great aim, lofty vision and inspired
exposition of the book, Sri Vijayaraghavachari, an eminent
leader of light and learning, remarked, “ Especially the last
chapter is inimitably eloquent and patriotic. I am afraid I
am unable to find suitable words to describe my ideas
regarding the book, especially the last chapter.” Sri N. C.
Kelkar opined that Savarkar’s thesis on Hindutva unfolded
a new scientific analysis of Hindutva unseen hithertofore !
Later on this book became the Bible of a great movement.
Savarkar’s poems and parts of his unfinished epic also
appeared one by one. One of them is ‘ Gomantak.’ This is
a canto describing the eighteenth century horrors in Goa. In
these poems Savarkar stirs the reader to the core. The reader
shudders. The poems enrage him and his face darkens with
shame. The poet narrates to the reader how under the guise
of love and Humanity the Portuguese in India perpetrated the
vilest misdeeds which were a black tyranny and a disgrace to
Humanity !</p>
<p>Shortly afterwards followed the transfer of Savarkar to the
Yeravada Jail. There he devoted himself to the spread of
literacy and to the development of the jail library, and
propagated his views on the current political questions among
the Gandhian prisoners. Gandhiji was then imprisoned for
sedition in the Yeravada Jail. Savarkar narrated the stories
of the lives of revolutionaries to the prisoners, whose
knowledge of historic events was as hollow as their caps ! He
described their thi&rsquo;illing deeds, great sacrifices and selfless
services to which, he said, at least their countrymen should
be grateful, humanely if not patriotically ! But they were
struggling to secure special classes for themselves in prison.
Why should they try to understand the sufferings, sacrifices
and service of those dauntless revolutionary souls ? He was
also watchful in the prison about the conversion of Hindus.
He had performed one shuddhi in the Ratnagiri jail and here
he converted one Christian officer and his bride to the Hindu
fold.</p>
<p>The year 1922 passed by. In 1923 at the third Ratnagiri
District Political Conference, Savarkar’s xmconditional release
was again demanded by a special resolution. The Savarkar
Release Committee led by Sri Jamnadasji Mehta agitated and
published one pamphlet ‘ Why Savarkar should be released ’.
A meeting was held in the Marwadi Vidyalaya, Bombay,
and a strong demand was made for Savarkar’s release.
Sri Vithalbhai Patel was in the chair. In 1923 the Indian</p>
<p>OUT OP HIS GRAVE 149</p>
<p>National Congress at its Cocanada Session at last passed a
resolutior, which was moved from the chair, demanding the
release of Savarkar. Now helpful winds began to blow in
his direction. His Excellency Sir George Llyod, the
Governor of Bombay, came with his Councillors to interview
Savarkar. Lt.-Col. J. H. Murray, I.M.S., who was the Jail
Superintendent in the Cellular Jail, was now at Yeravada as
the Jail Superintendent. The conditions of release were
prepared in the light of the discussions held between Savarkar
and H.E. the Governor and his Councillors. After
substituting a few words, Savarkar accepted the conditions,
signed the terms and was released conditionally on January
6, 1924, from the Yeravada Jail. The terms read : —</p>
<p>(1) that Savarkar shall reside in the Ratnagiri District and
shall not go beyond the limits of that District without
the permission of Government or in case of emergency
of the District Magistrate ;</p>
<p>(2) that he will not engage publicly or privately in any
manner of political activities without the consent of
Government for a period of five years such restrictions
being renewable at the discretion of Government at
the expiry of the said term.</p>
<p>The release of Savarkar was hailed with great satisfaction
all over India. Savarkar was taken away by Dr. Bhat to
the City of Poona where Savarkar saw Sri N. C. Kelkar.
Shivrampant Paranjpe, with his changed outlook, appeared
before Savarkar as a distortion of the great revolutionary
apostle ! Paranjpe talked to Savarkar about his proposed
new daily, Nava Kal. Savarkar abruptly remarked with
a pun that he knew only the old Kal !</p>
<p>But all was not yet well. The dark night of imperialism
was still reigning. The owl, popularly known as the old dame
of Bori Bunder, ominously hooted in its current topics, “ At
Ratnagiri he will have predecessor of a very diflferent stamp.
After the third Burmese War, King Thiba was exiled to
Ratnagiri and it was there that he died.” What more humane
and beneficial note can an owl hoot ?</p>
<p>The political situation in India was getting complicated
since 1915. Sri S. P. Sinha, afterwards Lord Sinha, was the</p>
<p>150 SAVARKAB AND HIS TIMES</p>
<p>last Moderate to preside over the Congress. He spoke in
favour of gradual evolution and cautious progress, and his
address proved to be the swan-song of the Moderates as
Congressmen ! The Liberals were the Moderates who had
seceded from the Congress. Their big Gokhale and Mehta
had passed away. The Left Wing was coming to the front.
Mrs. Annie Besant’s Home Rule League and Tilak’s grand
entry into the Lucknow Congress hastened the fall of the
Liberals. On the eve of the Lucknow Session the .shrewd
elements in the Muslim League adopted the Congress ideal
of self-government for India within the Empire. For winning
support of the Muslim League to the Congress, the Congress
made a pact with the Muslim League, conceding them
separate representation and communal electorates. The
Lucknow Pact, after Tilak’s death, unfortunately proved to
be a rift in the lute ! The pact reduced the political problem
to a simple equation. If the Muslim League represented the
Indian Moslems, whom did the Congress represent ? The
answer was all those Indians minus the Muslims. The
Moderates and Moonje opposed this pact from the beginning !
The Montagu-Chelmsford Reforms were declared on August
20, 1917, and were publi.shed in 1918. The Congress declared
the reforms as disappointing and unsatisfactory. The
Moderates pronounced this scheme a substantial instalment
of responsible Government to be welcomed and improved
upon.</p>
<p>Although Mr. Montagu, the Secretary of State for India,
was of the opinion that the “ separate representation and
communal electorates were opposed to the teaching of
history ”, and “ fatal to the democratization of institutions and
caused disunion between the Hindus and the Moham-
medans he yielded to the Muslim demand as he feared a
Moslem rising if he did not do so. Montagu confirmed the
policy of Morley and Minto and the Lucknow Pact. Gokhale’s
testament also held this view and his skeleton plan recognised
the need for separate and direct representation of Moham-
medans and other non-majority communities ! ^</p>

<p>&ldquo;H.H. the Aga Khan, India in Transition, p. 44,</p>
<p>OUT OF HIS GRAVE</p>
<p>151</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Rowlatt Act was passed in 1919 and the
Government of India took power to arrest and imprison any
individual without trial. Tilak was then in London in con-
nection with the Chiiol case. Martial law reigned in the
Pimjab and roused general indignation. Then came the
tragedy of Jallianwalla Baug and the inaugxu’ation of
Gandhiji’s non-co-operation movement in collaboration with
the Khilafat Movement which was entirely religious, essen-
tially fanatical and historically regressive. At this critical
juncture Tilak passed away ! The fiasco and futility of
Gandhiji’s non-co-operation and the collapse of the Khilafat
movement turned Sri C. R. Das and Pandit Motilal Nehru to
the Assembly with a view to giving organized opposition to
the Government. Kelkar, Jayakar and Moonje who were
sceptical of Gandhiji’s political tactics and who were
awakened by the Moplas’ atrocities and outrages on Hindu
women, men and children in Malabar made common cause
with this part 5 ^ The Liberals in the new Assembly carried
a motion declaring that they wanted a revision or re-
examination of the reformed constitution at an earlier date
than 1929. Hence they were also not liked by Government and
their wisdom with moderation was disliked by the masses who
were awakened to political consciou.snes.s by Tilak and Das.
The strange, enigmatic, and conquering politician in Gandhiji
was about to retire into oblivion for the next five years.
Although it was a fact that Gandhiji’s meteoric rise was due
to his unparalleled gift for organization, the self-centred
multi-millionaires and mill-magnates were not less responsible
for it. In the words of B. C. Pal : “ Mr. Gandhi has not been
helped to his unique influence in the country by merely the
medieval Indian mind, but also by the more practical support
that has come to him from the multi-millionaires and the mill-
masters of his own province who have not been slow to
recognize in him a very efficient instrument for advancing
their own economic and financial interests. They have
exploited him as he himself has, perhaps unconsciously,
exploited them. In the coming Gandhi Raj, if the Gandhi
movement succeeds, we shall have no democracy, but an,</p>
<p>152 SAVARKAR AND HIS TIMES</p>
<p>autocracy of the oriental type dominated by priestly
influences and worked especially for the benefit of profiteering
banias.” ^ Did we realize this in 1950 ?</p>
<p>The Liberals were routed in the election of 1923. They
lacked an organized party. The vociferous Das and Nehru
occupied their places. Savarkar was willing to work the
reforms. He always held that the movement for freedom
should be launched from within and without !</p>
