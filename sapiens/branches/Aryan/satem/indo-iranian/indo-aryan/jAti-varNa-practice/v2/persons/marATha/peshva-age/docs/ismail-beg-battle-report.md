On Jyeshta Shuddha 15 Pournima (18 June 1788), Wednesday, we fought a battle with Ismail Beg. From dawn to evening the battle continued. Mons. Lestinau and Deboigne's battalions were combined in the center, along with all the artillery. Our cavalry was on both wings, and one more detachment was sent to flank the enemy in their rear. Shrimant's good fortune and God's will has granted Mahadji a great victory. Our cavalry and battalions fought very well. 

Ismail Beg had with him 20 - 22 battalions. These were destroyed. A sardar who had joined him with 3 more battalions were cut down. 20 cannons were seized. Our battalions commanded by Thakur-prasad and others, in total 10 battalions which had defected to Jaipur after Lalsot, 6 of these and several others had joined Ismail Beg. With this, he also had 5000 Mughal cavalry. 

Their entire artillery and the guns used for the siege were all captured. I will send a detailed report when I receive the tally. In spoils of war, we have acquired 5000 camels, 2500 horses, 12-14 elephants, many tents, drums, standards and other equipment. Some 2000-2500 of the battalion sepoys drowned while attempting to flee and swim across the river. 

Around 8000 of the enemy were slain by our cannonfire and the melee attack. For a distance of one kos (3km), there are bodies of men and horses everywhere. Among our high ranking sardars, Rajashri Dharrao Shinde's brother Narayanrao Shinde, and from the new army, 3-4 sardars were killed. Jivaji Ballal was injured in the neck by grapeshot and his horse was killed. Vithoji Shinde was also injured. Jivbadada's brother is in the new army, his hand was grazed by a bullet. Venkatrao Nimbalkar's brother has 2 injuries. In addition, Shivba Baji Nimbalkar and Bhavji Jathar and other 200-300 men were killed. 500-700 were injured. 2000 horses were lost (killed) by cannonfire. Otherwise God has been kind. 

After his defeat, Ismail Beg has fled with his father across the river to join Ghulam Kadir.

(Repeated content of events before the battle is omitted.) 

The battle with Ismail Beg was enormous. Cavalry was split into three divisions, and one large division of the battalions.  
The battle began with cannonfire. Ismail Beg advanced on our batteries. Then the cavalry attacked from all three sides (2 wings and rear) and slew them in great numbers. Slaying the battalions, we captured 50 cannons, 8 elephants, standards and other camp equipment. A large number have been taken prisoner. 

Ismail Beg has a sword and spear wound. He fled with barely 20 bodyguards across the river to join Ghulam Kadir. The army performed exceedingly well. They marched right into cannonfire.
