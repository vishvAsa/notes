      <description>&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&#34;https://x.com/tskrishnan/status/2006987402137710971&#34;&gt;TW&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When Yusuf Khan, also known as Marudu Nayagam, was in the service of the English, he and Colonel Heron undertook a southern expedition to collect taxes from the polygars. Kumaravadi polygar Lakshmi Nayak refused to pay the tax, following which British forces launched an attack. The local governor, Mayana, fled to the Thirumbur temple (present-day Thirumogur).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Yusuf Khan pursued him, but upon receiving news of Yusuf Khan’s approach, Mayana escaped from the temple. Colonel Heron, however, remained unconvinced. He, along with Yusuf Khan, proceeded to attack the temple. The temple gates were burned down, and the shrine was plundered. All the idols were taken away. The Kallars, who were the worshippers and protectors of the temple, were enraged by this act.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
