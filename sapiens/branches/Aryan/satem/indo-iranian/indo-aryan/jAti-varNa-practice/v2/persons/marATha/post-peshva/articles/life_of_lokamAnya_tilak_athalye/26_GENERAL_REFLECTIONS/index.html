<p>We can sacrcely express the admiration which we feel for
a mind so great and at the same time so healthy and well-proportioned, so willingly contracting itself to the humblest
duties, so easily expanding itself to the highest, so contended in
repose, so powerful in action. Every part of this virtuous and
blameless life is not hidden from us in modest privacy is a
splendid-portion of our national history.</p>
<p>Macaulay on John Hampden</p></blockquote>
<p>The playground of Eton might have trained up the
conqueror of Napoleon ; but it is characteristic
either of the circumstances in India or of our college###life or of both, that Mr. Tilak owed absolutely nothing
to his alma mater. None of his fellow-students or pro###fessors could foretell his future career; none size up the
vast potentialities of the man. To most of his fellow###students, Mr. Tilak,— Mr. Blunt, as they preferred to call
him — appeared as a young man of rather extra- ordinary
abihties but certainly not of extra-ordinary ambition
or application, extremely obstinate, somewhat
domineering, simple and kind-hearted. Even to
Ranade, the most observant man of the time, the memorable 1st of January 1880 appeared only to usher in
the second stage of our public life. Even he, scarcely
realized that a dynamic personality had appeared in
the stagnant waters of our national life, — a personality
that was destined to measure its strength with ail
others and ultimately to triumph over them all. The
progress of Mr. Tilak was challenged at every step. On
the one hand, there was a strong body of Liberal and
Moderate leaders — Ranade, Mehta, Telang, Wacha,
Bhandarkar, to name only a few — and on the other the
vast forces of the powerful Bureaucracy despotically
ruling over the land. Alternately, simultaneously, Mr.
Tilak knocked the one or the other. He, in his turn,
received blows at every step, at every turn. Some###times, it appeared as if, he was done for, that he had
ceased to count as a factor in public life and would be
required to recede, crest-fallen, into the background.
Defeat after defeat was inflicted upon him, and on
many occassions, it appeared that the epitaph on his
career could be written. But sphinx-like, he arose
out of the ashes of every defeat more and more powerful
until at last his opponents, deserted, defeated and con###founded had to make room for him.</p>
<p>To fight with practically all the foremost men of one&rsquo;s
time and with an extremely powerful bureaucracy to
boot, one must be nothing less than a dare-devil — in the
noblest and best sense of the term. Even to attempt
such a fight is creditable ; to do it with effect is still
more so and to win laurels therein is reserved only for
a rare hero. It was even so with Mr. Tilak. The equip
ment with which Mr. Tilak commenced his life-work
was immense. His genius was of the highest order.
Its most distinguished feature was originality. Read###ers of his Gita Rahasya marvel at the calm assurance
with which he quietly sets aside the authority and tradi###tional interpretations of the last two thousand years^</p>
<p>GENERAL REFLECTIONS 359</p>
<p>To the study of the Gita, Mr. Tilak brought a mind un###trammelled by tradition, undeterred by authority and
unrestrained by expediency. So in every department
of life and thought — politics included — ^his genius must
run its course, heedless of tradition, authority or expe###diency. It was absolutely impossible for his fiery and
passionate spirit as also for his restless and original
mind to acquiesce in the easy-going, desultory and irre###solute pubUc life of the day. Where would it lead us ?
What was its goal ? Will these widow-marriages and
all that make men of us ? Will they break the bonds
of foreign domination that has enchained and well-nigh
paralyzed us ? To him British Government was an
evil — to be tolerated, to be made the best of, but after###all an evil, which has crushed us politically, socially,
industrially, and spiritually. Therein he saw no &quot; Di###vine dispensation of an inscrutable Providence.&quot; Two
generations of educated Indians had been lauding,
with a rare exception, the greatness of our English
&quot; deliverers &ldquo;; Mr. Tilak refused to dance to the tune.
Two generations of educated Indians had swallowed
all the sneers and gibes at Indian society in which the
English officials and missionaries indulged ; far from
uttering a word of protest, the English-educated Indians
had based their programme of Social Reform on that
condemnation. Mr. Tilak could not agree with them.
Two generations of educated Indians had pinned their
faith on the benevolence, righteousness and humanity
of the present rulers of India ; Mr. Tilak, gifted with a
more correct perception of the state of things relied
more on the people than on the conquerors, for the great
consummation of all our ambitions ; and the man, who</p>
<p>360 LOKAMANYA TILAK</p>
<p>rejected the authority of all the Acharyas in the interpre###tation of the Gita, the man who rejected the reasoning of
all European scholars with regard to the antiquity of
the Vedas and the cradle of the Aryan civilisation —
this same man rejected methods of Ranade, Telang,
Mandlik, Bhau Daji and all the time-honoured leaders
of the people and struck out a new path in public life.
To challenge in this way the work of two generations,
requires a degree of no ordinary courage. To strike
out a new path in the public life almost in opposition
to the previous generation requires vision of the first
order ; and the peculiar path selected by Mr. Tilak
called for self-sacrifice of the highest degree. Mr.
Tilak rushed into the arena of national activities fully
gifted with this vision, courage and self-sacrifice. An###other man was there, Mr. Tilak&rsquo;s peer in every quality
of the head and heart — Vishnushastri Chiploonkar.
Another man yet, Gopal Ganesh Agarkar, a smaller
chip of the same block. His broken health and strain###ed circumstances, later on somewhat altered the angle
of Agarkar&rsquo;s vision. But throughout his eventful life,
Mr. Tilak was found equal to any sacrifice, a match
for any misfortune. He took up the work of national
uplift in true Jesuitical spirit. Utter renunciation was
his watchword. He even regretted that his father
should have got him married ; and now that he was a
married man, he must seek for &rsquo; maintenance allow###ance ;&rsquo; but barring that, every pie he would get would
belong to his country. The hfe-long simplicity of Mr.
Tilak&rsquo;s dress and living was due to this vow of poverty ;
and the purity of his life — so conspicuously and deser###vedly recognised by all his contemporaries — instinctive</p>
<p>GENERAL REFLECTIONS 361</p>
<p>at first, was fortified by his gradual gaining in spiritual
stature.</p>
<p>It will thus be seen that the moral and intellectual
outlook with which Mr. Tilak started his career was
essentially novel and was destined to bring about
nothing less than a revolution in the public life of the
country. The older generation of leaders, however,
had a merry time of it for the next eleven years owing
to Mr. Tilak&rsquo;s long diversion and total absorption in
the New English School and the Fergusson College.
Three great idolas — to use a Baconian expression — had
seized hold of the public mind in India during the last
sixty years and diverted the nation from pursuing its
first duty, — freedom from foreign domination. To-day
we recognize that there can be no National Education
without a National Government. We now realise that
there can be no true Social Reform without and before
political reform. We have learnt to our cost that
there can be no regeneration of the national industries
unless and until political power is wrested from the
representatives of foreign capitalists. Education, Social
Reform, Industrial Development — all must wait and
make room for political reform. But about 1880 people
thought differently ; and so Ranade ran after the lure
of Social Reform, Tilak and Agarkar attempted to start
National Education, Kunte and others tried to intro###duce western industries in the unmanured soil of our
country. The attempts failed to achieve the intended
result. To be sure, a certain amount of progress did
result ; but at what cost ? Mr. Tilak&rsquo;s dedication of
eleven years to a school :ind a college may have made
him a bit less idealistic and more conversant with men</p>
<p>3^2 LOKAMANYA TILAK</p>
<p>and affairs. It may have enabled him to equip himself
the better for the mission of his life. But at the same
time, we must not forget, that he lost eleven precious
years of political leadership. Eleven years! and to a
man Hke Mr. Tilak ! What a world of difference it
would have made ! As it was, when lesser men were
dominating the public life, and moulding the national
will, Mr. Tilak was busy teaching Statistics and Astro###nomy, Sanskrit and Science to college students, figting
all the while with the ever-growing clique which ulti###mately threw him out. In the first Session of the
Indian National Congress, the first resolution was moved
by the late Mr. G. Subramania Aiyar, born in 1856,
the year of Mr. Tilak&rsquo;s birth ; while he, Mr. Tilak was
at Poona shaping the infant college into life and strength.
It is impossible and at the same time idle to discuss the
possibilities, had Mr. Tilak started life as the sole editor
of the Kesari and the Mahratta. But it is just possible
that in his pursuit of what proved to be a phantom, the
process of galvanizing the Congress and the public life
of the country was delayed by a decade.</p>
<p>Within the walls of the school and the college, soon
after their existence was assured, a struggle awaited
Mr. Tilak which gave a rude shock to his innate idealism.
It was a struggle between a great man and compara###tively small men, between idealism and worldly wisdom,
between unbending adherence to the original understand###ing and the demands of worldly ease. These differences
were probably aggravated by the introduction of
personal element. There is no thought more humilia###ting to ordinary minds than the growing consciousness
that the man, whom in school or in college we re-</p>
<p>GENERAL REFLECTIONS 365</p>
<p>garded more or less as an equal, stands head and shoul###der over us and extorts greater, more ardent homage from
the world at large. It is not impossible that such an ele###ment found its way into the otherwise noble heart of
Agarkar, who generally led the opposition against Mr.
Tilak ; and when such a paragon of sacrifice raised the
issues, need we wonder that Apte joined him, Apte,
who at the very time of joining the Society is said to
have stipulated for relaxation with respect to the ori###ginal agreement about extra income ? The cry was
catching and was taken up by others, even by Mr.
Gokhale whose ardent love of the Motherland and
sterling sacrifices in her cause are well known. Then
came the differences of opinions with regard to Social
Reform on which Mr. Agarkar was so keen; and they are
supposed to have accelerated the breach. It is also
just possible that the party led by Ranade might have
been led, by instincts of self-preservation, to exploit
the already delicate situation and utilise the discon###tented element in the Deccan Education Socity for the
enhancement of its prestige, which since 1880 had been
steadily dwindling. For eleven long years, Mr. Tilak had
been trying to enlist the active sympathy or patronage
of all that was best, most thoughtful, most influential in
the Bombay Presidency in the cause of the Society ;
what must have been his disappointment and mrotifi###cation to find that after all this laborious fabric had been
erected, ensuring the permanent existence and the
prosperity of the institution, he was made to feel that
he was no longer required and that for his own peace
he had better walk away ? Had the majority of the
members been grateful even by a tittle for the construe-</p>
<p>364 LOKAMANYA TILAK</p>
<p>tive and organizing work done by Mr. Tilak, when most
of them were nobodies, they would not, like rebellious
children, have stooped to pass a vote of censure upon
the father of the institution. The Hon. Mr. Paranjpye
might find it convenient to ridicule the public which
sympathised with Mr. Tilak on the occasion of his re###tirement from the Society, but the public v^as not far
in the wrong and Mr. Tilak was really the victim of
incessant intrigues aimed mainly at his downfall.</p>
<p>When, in 1890, Mr. Tilak left the D. E. Society, he
found himself almost shunned by the intelligentia of
Poona. A less courageous and enterprising man would
not have survived this defeat. Nor were his oppo###nents willing to let him alone. A most foolish, uncalled###for legislation was undertaken by the Government of
India as a concession to the continual pressure brought
upon them by the leading lights of Social Reform. Mr.
Tilak opposed it tooth and nail but was prepared for a
reasonable compromise. The turn-headed reformers,
however, brooked no conciliation. Mr. Tilak was stig###matised as an incendiary, a destructive worker. The air
was thick with his condemnation. Feelings ran so high
that whatever was opposed by Mr. Tilak was liked and
supported by his opponents. The Sharada Sadan, an
institution conducted by a Christian lady, had begun
to develop unhealthy features. The original compact
was gradually being set aside, and Christianity insidi###ously sought to be preached. Mr. Tilak got scent of
the matter. He raised a note of warning. At once
like mad dogs, his opponents rushed at him, &quot; Mr.
Tilak was an enemy of female education !&rdquo; &quot; Cut
him !&quot; At last after more than one year of quibbling.</p>
<p>GENERAL REFLECTIONS 365.</p>
<p>shuffling and prevarication, the leaders of Social Reform
had the decency to withdraw their support from the
school which is now purely and avowedly a Christian
institution. In spite of the cold shoulder that was
given to him, in spite of the cold way in which he was
made to understand that he was a busy-body, a mortal
in the midst of gods, Mr. Tilak attended the annual
sessions of the Social Conference and tried to infuse in
them a more constructive and responsible spirit. But
it was to no effect. A certain Rao Bahadur, a lieute###nant of Ranade, openly declared that unless Mr. Tilak
was dead, things would not work smoothty. This was
too much for human nature to bear. Utterly disgusted
with the autocratic and unthinking way in which the
the Social Conference was conducted, Mr. Tilak left it
and practically ceased taking interest in the work.
But his opponents would not rest or give rest. At the
time of the Poona Congress, in spite of the fact that
Mr. Tilak had repeatedly declared through the Kesari
and in the meetings of the working committee that
the question of the loan of the Congress pavilion for
the Social Conference should be decided by either Re###ception Committee or by the Congress itself, the cry
was kept up that Mr. Tilak was an extremely narrow###minded and quarrelsome man and that he did not want
the Social Conference to be held in the Congress pavilion.
It is, after all, best to throw a pall over all these exhi###bitions of the good taste, decency and fair-play of his
opponents ; but a Uttle peep into them is necessary in
order to understand the stupendous difficulties through
and inspite of which Mr. Tilak single-handed had to
deliver his message to the people.</p>
<p>366 LOKAMANVA TILAK</p>
<p>Nor were the Reformers and the Moderates the only
opponents Mr. Tilak had to reckon. There was a
powerful section of the Bureaucracy and its proteges
of the Anglo-Indian Press whose hostility so
often has proved a fruitful source of trouble to Mr.
Tilak. The success of the New English School had
given a headache to the Times of India, and in the esta###blishment of an innocent school patronized by men
like Ranade, Telang and Mandlik, it foresaw unpleasant
results. The tone of the Kesari and the Mahratta was
regarded as unfriendly to their interests by the Govern###ment. When in 1890, Mr. Tilak took an attitude of
opposition to the Age of Consent Bill, the Times of India
inquired how it was that such a man could be or remain
a member of an institution like the Deccan Education
Society ; and then with a sigh of relief and a chuckling
sense of satisfaction, Principal Apte wrote a rejoinder
declaring that Mr. Tilak was no longer a member of the
Society. Three years rolled on, years in which Mr.
Tilak was bringing upon himself the wrath of vested
interests. Then came the Hindu-Mahomedan riots ;
the sky was thick with the dust of controversies ; and
Mr. Tilak, without mincing matters, again and again
declared that the policy of favouritism inaugurated by
a certain section of the Bureaucracy was responsible
for all the mischief that was going on for well-nigh two
years. This was bearding the lion, rudely and un###ceremoniously. How boldly and uncompromisingly
Mr. Tilak expressed his views on this &rsquo; Divide and Rule &rsquo;
poUcy can be appreciated only by a study of all the
soft speeches of the so-called leaders of those times.
Even the late Sir Pherozeshah, Tribune of the people</p>
<p>GENERAL REFLECTIONS 367</p>
<p>that he was, gave utterance to the right view m the
mildest and most guarded language. If ever a leader
deUvered his message through storm and stress, thun###der and lightening, obloquy and persecutions, it was
Mr. Tilak ; and delivered under such circumstances, it
derived a meaning, it commanded a respect which
otherwise mere abilities or learning would not have
brought it. It is only the man who swims against the
current and not the one who swims with it, who deser###ves praise ; and Mr. Tilak lived to gain this due.</p>
<p>In the earlier years of his career, Mr. Tilak&rsquo;s pubUc
activities were regarded as merely destructive by those
whose influence and methods he had challenged. Let
us see what Mr. Tilak did during the fifteen years since
he measured swords with Ranade and Telang. He car###ried the message of the Congress to the smallest and
most distant hamlet in Maharashtra ; he spread broad###cast the teachings of Western liberalism, of Western
democracy. He opened the eyes of the people to their
terrible condition — stark poverty and utter bondage.
He held before their eyes the vision of the great ideal, —
Swaraj. He called upon them to work hard and sacri###fice their very best. He told them not to be deluded
by the words of the so-called Reformers who never
tired of calling them weak. He accustomed them to
look back to the past and draw therefrom inspiration
for the work of the present. He taught them to watch
the administration of the day with vigilance. He
trained them up in organised opposition. He showed
them by personal example how to suffer for one&rsquo;s con###victions and one&rsquo;s country. If all this be destructive
work, Mr. Tilak loses nothingby being called a &quot; destruc-</p>
<p>368 LOKAMANYA TILAK</p>
<p>tive force.&quot; Only one should like to know what
&quot; constructive &quot; work means.</p>
<p>When the pantalooned orators of the National Con###gress were in vain making passionate appeals to the
Government, Mr. Tilak had already pinned his faith on
the people. His gospel of Swaraj formed a refreshing
contrast to the petty demands formulated from time to
time by the National Congress. No doubt the festival
of Shivaji was a provoincial affair wherein only the
Hindus could participate. Still it did greater national
service in Maharashtra during the nineties than the
Congress itself. The methods of the national body
were outlandish and hence ineffective, uninspiring and
unpopular. The Congress stood for the glorification
of the British Rule, while the Shivaji festival took the
peoples&rsquo; minds back to that period when the slogan of
Swaraj was reverberating throughout the length and
breadth of the land. This powerful appeal to a glori###ous past, together with the lessons of courage and self###sacrifice which it inculcated did in those days greater
service to Western India than the National Congress.
Owing to its inherent limitations, the Shivaji festival
could not, of course, usurp the functions of the Congress
even in Maharashtra. The festival, however, stands
as a symbol of Mr. Tilak&rsquo;s methods of awakening and
organizing the people and did exceptionally valuable
political work supplementary to that of the Congress.</p>
<p>Mr. Tilak&rsquo;s strenuous efforts to awaken the people
together with the organized opposition he led in the
famine and plague agitations excited the liveliest ap###prehension in the minds of some ofiicials and a moment of
panic was seized upon to put him down. The prosecu-</p>
<p>GENERAL REFLECTIONS 369</p>
<p>tion of Mr. Tilak in 1897 was the first serious attempt
of the Bureaucracy to secure the silence of a &quot; trouble###some &quot; agitator. So weak were the traditions of our
pubhc life, that Mr. Tilak&rsquo;s persistence in braving the
ire of an inflamed officialdom was regarded almost as
an act of madness and great pressure was brought to
induce him to apologize. A similar attempt made
(i892)tosave a Calcutta newspaper from the operations
of 124A by a belated apology had been criticized by Mr.
Tilak and he was not a man to set up one standard of
conduct for others and quite another for himself. He
cheerfully went to gaol rather than bend his knee before
the powers that be. The terrors of gaol could not
cow him down, nor did the actual prison -Ufe with its
nauseating food and fatiguing work. Though he came
out of the portals of the Yeravda gaol a broken man,
his spirit was as unbending as ever and after a few
months of rest and recuperation, he took up the threads
of his public activities, unhampered by the reactionary
regime of Lord Curzon, imdeterred by the machinations
of his enemies in the Tai Maharaj Case.</p>
<p>A great man never suffers without gaining in spiritual
strength ; and the sufferings of Mr. Tilak in the Tai
Maharaj case were proverbial. In the earlier stages of
this case, there were occasions when Mr. Tilak&rsquo;s clouds
were unredeemed by any &quot; silver lining &lsquo;, when expres###sions of hope would have sounded as nothing but
*&rsquo; hollow mockery or premature consolations,&quot; But
he refused to be disheartened by the manifold odds
against him. The mighty resources of a prejudiced
Bureaucracy, coupled with the endless scheming of
unscrupulous enemies failed to shake his faith in the</p>
<p>24:</p>
<p>370 LOKAMANYA TILAK</p>
<p>justice and invincibility of his cause. Even when he
was sentenced to imprisonment on a charge of perjury,
handcuffed hke a common felon and sent to jail, cheer###fulness and equanimity never left him.</p>
<p>To all appearances, Mr. Tilak, when he emerged {1904)
triumphant out of the first stage of the Tai Maharaj
case, was the same man,a bit worried and dis###tracted, who was drawn into its vortex in 1900. But a
subtle spiritual change had come over him which en###hanced his prestige and power in the anti-Partition
agitation of which he was to be one of the foremost
leaders. Prior to 1904, Mr. Tilak&rsquo;s speeches and wri###tings were merely intellectual. There was of course a
&ldquo;background of spiritualit}/ which we notice in his career
since the very beginning. But the personality was
pronouncedly intellectual. His speeches and writings
arrested attention, extorted admiration and roused
enthusiasm by the ruthless logic of a trained intellec###tual gladiator ; but there was no consciousness of Faith
in Divine guidance in them. The veritable ordeal of
the Tai Maharaj Case, however, immensely contributed
to his spiritual growth. From a patriot, he was now
transformed into a prophet.</p>
<p>While the fortunes of Mr. Tilak were apparently in
the melting pot, his supposed rival, the Hon. Mr.
Gokhale was rising from one pinnacle of glory to another.
The careers of these two great Mahratta Brahmins
suggest a series of interesting reflections. Both started
life as school-masters. Both dedicated their all to the
service of the Motherland. Both took to public life in
true missionary spirit. Both were distinguished educa###tionists, professors of a very high order ; — Mr. Gokhale,</p>
<p>GENERAL REFLECTIONS 37I</p>
<p>studious, copious and methodical, Mr. Tilak, versatile,
profound and original. Both took to journalism in
the early nineties. Mr. Tilak remained an editor till
the end of his life. Mr. Gokhale gave up journalism
after less than half a dozen years&rsquo; apprenticeship, labour###ed at Statistics and became an enthusiastic student of
Economics and Politics. Mr. Gokhale&rsquo;s training and
equipment led him to the Councils and he attained re###putation as the first Councillor in India. Mr. Tilak
devoted his energy to the cause of journaUsm and
became the premier editor in the country. Mr. Gokhale
came to be a great favourite with the Moderate leaders.
Mr. Tilak founded a new school of political thought of
ivhich he was the undisputed and most influential
leader. Mr. Gokhale&rsquo;s politics and opportunities made
him a persona grata with the Indian Bureaucracy and
the English poUticians. Mr. Tilak&rsquo;s methods or fate
led him into bitter opposition with the Bureaucracy
and landed him into trouble and jail. Mr. Gokhale&rsquo;s
path was swept clean even by highly-placed officials.
Mr. Tilak&rsquo;s course, on the contrary, was often rendered
thorny by Bureaucratic ire. Mr. Gokhale&rsquo;s mis###sion in life was to be the awakener of the Bureaucratic
conscience; Mr. Tilak&rsquo;s was to rouse the soul of
his countrymen.</p>
<p>Till the end of his brilliant career, Mr.Gokhale:could
never overcome the struggle between his inborn enthu###siasm and innate caution. His enthusiasm landed him
into difficulties from which his caution hardly extricated
him ; on the contrary, his caution sometimes got the
better of his enthusiasm and made him take positions,
his better nature would never have allowed him to do.</p>
<p>372 LOKAMANYA TILAK</p>
<p>He lacked personality and forcefulness. The influence
of a strong-willed colleague was often responsible for
his inconsistencies. Then we must not forget the dizzy
height which he had ascended. Courted by Cabi###net Ministers, trusted and flattered by the Bureaucracy^
Mr. Gokhale was in a peculiar position during the event###ful years of the anti-Partition movement. His own
enthusiasm drew him in one direction, his Moderate as###sociates to another, while the English and Anglo-In###dian officials pulled him quite in a contrary direction ;
and Mr. Gokhale&rsquo;s politics reveals the evident struggle
to keep his balance between these contending forces.</p>
<p>With Mr. Tilak the case was different. As he never
aspired to win the applause at once of the populace, of
the Beuraucracy and the ministers at &rsquo; home &lsquo;, his line
of conduct during the eventful years just preceding his
last and longest incarceration was uniformly consistent.
There are those who sneer at his alliance with the Bengal</p>
<ul>
<li>Extremists *, which, they argue, led him to adopt
measures and preach opinions, which, left to himself,
he would never have done. One may reply this criti###cism by counter- criticism. The Moderates of Bengal
and the Moderates of Bombay had a world of difference
between them and though the Moderate leaders of
Bombay had not the courage to oppose the resolution
on National Education at Calcutta (Dec. 1906), still
they did not hesitate to oppose that same resolution in
the next Provincial Conference at Surat (May 1907).
Is not this inconsistency ? When the Congress had
passed resolutions on Swadeshi and Boycott, when the
Hon. Mr. Gokhale himself was warmly advocating the
cause of Bengal and the strong measures adopted there to</li>
</ul>
<p>GENERAL REFLECTIONS 373</p>
<p>give a home-thrust to our callous rulers, Congressmen
and Moderate newspapers were found to ridicule, &lsquo;Honest
Swadeshi &rsquo; and &rsquo; economic boycott &lsquo;. The circumstan###ces of Bengal were such that it was impossible for the
harassed, persecuted and well-nigh desperate Ben###galis to believe in the advent of a day when Britain
would make us their equal partners. Naturally the
Bengalis began to look to independence as their ulti###mate ideal, an ideal, be it remembered, which the Indian
law-courts and the then Secretary of State found nothing
to find fault with. Was it Mr. Tilak&rsquo;s fault that when
some of his Indian and Anglo-Indian opponents began
to stamp the ideal of independence as illegal, he rushed
to the rescue of his Bengali friends ? Did not Sir
Surendranath himself allow an amendment to the
Self- Government Resolution at the Pubna Conference
(1908) wherein, the Nationalists did affirm their faith
in independence as the ultimate goal to be achieved ?
So the &rsquo; inconsistency &rsquo; of Mr. Tilak amounts to this,
that knowing Maharashtra to be not quite ready for
this higher ideal, he preached in Western India &ldquo;Colonial
Self-Go vernment &quot; as the political ideal, though in
view of certain mischievous attacks, he felt bound to
draw the sword in defence of the theoretically perfect
ideal of independence.</p>
<p>The one work, which Mr. Tilak set himself to do
with his phenomenal energies, was to rouse the moral
and intellectual courage of the people. Where, as in
Bengal, circumstances considerably helped the process of
this awakening, he did his best to prevent it from dis###aster by a reckless extravagance which defeats its own
^nd. To rouse the latent moral and intellectual nature</p>
<p>374 LOKAMANYA TILAK</p>
<p>of the people is comparatively easy ; to divert it in.
constructive channels is difficult ; there the vested
interests, so firmly established try their best to knock
down every effort at organization. In the initial stages,.
infant democracy has to fight not only with the
rulers of the land, but also with the intellectual,
industrial and other magnates in the country. Tt is in
fact a struggle between those who are supposed to
have a stake in the land and those who have not. Is
it wonderful that this unholy alliance between money.
Government and intelligence should succeed, though
for a time, in crushing the leaders of the proletariat ?
The struggle at Surat was really a fight between the
old aristocracy on the one hand and the infant demo###cracy on the other; and looking to the vastness of
the issues involved, it is but natural that matters
thus came to a crisis.</p>
<p>The dazzling splendour of Mr. Tilak&rsquo;s activities
after the Surat breach shows how an accomplished
leader can defy a tacit alliance between the old aristocracy
and the alien Bureaucracy. But it is humanly impossi###ble for any leader to guarantee perfect peace in the rank
and file when the tyranny of the Government inflames
people beyond measure. The bomb-thrower at Muzaf###ferpore was out, not only to harm the Govern###ment but the Nationalist party as well ; and he created
the same muddle in Indian politics which Shakes###peare&rsquo;s Puck in the Midsummer Nights Dream did
in the even course of love between two young men
and women. Mr. Tilak knew full well that a strong
effort would be made to sweep his movement out. He,
therefore, called his principal colleagues in Western</p>
<p>GENERAL REFLECTIONS 375</p>
<p>India, and issued a statement deploring the outrages
and suggesting ways and means for their prevention.
But the Bureaucracy was apparently bent on put###ting down the Nationalists. Mr. Tilak was arrested
and within a month was sent away to Ahmedabad
and Mandalay ; he got an opportunity, however, to
declare in solemn tones a warning that repression,
though temporarily successful, would only strengthen
the cause he was fighting for.</p>
<p>And he proved a true prophet ; while he was at
Mandalay, alternating his time between Religion,
Philosophy, History and Mathematics, the surviving
party of the Moderates tried its best to take full
advantage of the Morley-Minto Reforms, as also of
the inactivity of its opponents. But it quickly realized
the truth, Mr. Tilak had repeatedly uttered that
the Moderate could expect a little favour only when
the Extremist was in the field. The Moderates were
quickly disillusioned and were ready to ask for an###other &lsquo;boon &lsquo;; the Moslems, who had accustomed them
selves to be considered as the special favourites of Go###vernment, had been exasperated by the attitude of
England in the Turko-Balkan and the Turko-ItaJian
wars. Even Mrs. Besant, hitherto somewhat indiffer###ent to Indian politics, had taken a plunge into the
arena of our public life.</p>
<p>It speaks much for Mr. Tilak&rsquo;s elasticity of mind
that soon after his return (1914) from Mandalay he
took in the situation almost at a glance. Being
always accustomed to place his country&rsquo;s interests
above everything else, he was prepared to forget and
forgive not only his Moderate opponents but even the
incorrigible Bureaucrats. To placate the Moderates
and the Government he made a declaration of his
loyalty, — a declaration which created hopes in the
mind of Mrs. Besant of Congress compromise. The
outbreak of War found him a staunch ally of the
Government. He offered any kind of help he could.
But neither the autocrats of the Congress nor those
in the Government were willing to grasp the outstret###ched hand of friendship. ^</p>
<p>The events of the last six years and Mr. Tilak&rsquo;s
glorious part therein are too fresh in the reader&rsquo;s
mind to need any reiteration. These crowded years
of public Hfe form the noblest page of Mr. Tilak&rsquo;s
life. It is a period when he emerges triumphant |</p>
<p>3ver his opponents. It is a time when we see him,
not, as in 1889-1905 — a brave soldier, hopelessly
fighting against tremendous odds, not, as in 1905-1908,
a party leader tr3dng to force his way through co###lumns of opposition, but an all—India leader, a tact###ful negotiator, a skilled diplomat, a far-seeing states###man, an all-wise prophet. We see the constructive
side of his work in all its splendour. We see him
brave as yore, assertive as before, but with a meUow
splendour which refined and softened the sternness of
his dominating personality.</p>
<p>Such a leadership is the accident of a century !
How lucky for India then, that no sooner did the
Lokamanya expire, than his place has been cons###picuously filled up by Mahatma Gandhi, whose
unapproachable sanctity has raised politics to the
height of rehgion. The leadership of the Lokamanya
was pronouncedly intellectual and that of the</p>
<p>GENERAL REFLECTIONS 377</p>
<p>Mahatma is essentially spiritual. In both, however,
there is an element of grandeur which reminds us of
the following memorable words of another equally great
patriot, Arabindo Ghose :</p>
<p>I am the lord of the tempest and the mountain,
I am the spirit of freedom and pride,
Stark he must be a Kinsman to danger
Who shares my kingdom and walks by my side.</p>
