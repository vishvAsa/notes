  <blockquote>
<p>For us there is but one choice. We have made it. Woe be
to the man or groups of men that seek to stand in our way in
this day of our high resolution when every principle we hold
dearest is to be Vindicated and made secure for our salvation.</p>
<p>President Wilson</p></blockquote>
<p>After nine long years of separation, Mr. Tilak
joined his old comrades at the Congress of Lucknow (1916). What a change ! In 1907, the nation was
on the eve of a relentless campaign of repression. Now
in 1916, the country was throbbing with the expectation of a vast political transformation, which Mr. Tilak
had worked so laboriously to bring about. No wonder
therefore, that when he stood to address the 2350 ex###pectant delegates and thrice as many spectators he was
accorded an enthusiastic ovation. He said : —</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot; I am not foolish enough to think that this reception
is given to my humble self. It is given, if I rightly
understand to those principles for which I have been
fighting, principles which have been embodied in the
resolution I have the honour to support. I am glad to say
that I have lived these ten years to see that we are going
to put our voices and shoulders together to push on the
scheme of Self-Government. We are now united in
every way in the United Provinces.&quot;</p></blockquote>
<p>Without depreciating the efforts of several leaders who
worked hard to accomplish the Hindu-Moslem Unity,
it may be said that Mr. Tilak&rsquo;s foresight and generosity
in substantially conceding many of the demands of the
Mahomedans gratified them beyond all measure. They
had been taught to believe that Mr. Tilak was anti###Mahomedan, that in the Hindu-Moselm controversies
of 1893-94 he had been unfriendly to them and that his
Shivaji and Ganapati festivals were instituted with
the sole object of irritating their community. They
were, therefore, doubly glad to find that Mr. Tilak was
in favour of an enormously big percentage of repre###sentation to the Mahomedans in the Legislative Coun###cils. To those of his more theoretical and hence less
compromising brethren who looked with alarm at
these concessions, Mr. Tilak said : —</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It has been said that we, Hindus have yielded too
much to our Mahomedan brethren. I am sure, I re###present the sense of the Hindu community all over
India, when I say that we could not have yielded too
much. I would not care if the rights of Salf-Govern###ment are granted to the Mahomedan Community only.
I would not care if they are granted to the Rajputs.
I would not care if they are granted to the lower
classes of the Hindu population. Then the fight will
not be triangular as, at present, it is.</p></blockquote>
<p>This is the language, not only of magnanimity but of
statesmanship also. By making this concession, Mr^
Tilak successfully accomplished his object entertained
ever since his return from Mandalay of winning over
the Muslims. Influences were at work to keep the
Mahomedans away from the Hindus ; for Sir James
Meston had publicly advised them to place communal
considerations over the National. It was at this critical time that Mr. Tilak threw the whole weight of his
advice and influence over to the side of the Muslims
and secured their lasting co-operation.</p>
<p>In criticising (October 1916), the &quot; Memorandum of
19 &quot; Mr. Tilak had said that the demand made therein
was pretty well so far as it went but that it was neces###sary that the succeeding instalments of Self-government
should be definitely determined and announced toge###ther with the time-limit for complete realization of all
our aspirations. He tried his best to press the inclu###sion of this limit in the resolution of Self-Government.
The Hon&rsquo;ble Mr. Shastri also was of opinion that we
should not &quot; hesitate to demand that Responsible
Government should be worked up to in the course of
the next thirty years.&quot; But the stalwarts of the Con###gress did not favcur this view and for the sake of unity
Mr. Tilak, dropped the matter. The Congress of 19 17
made good this mistake and included a definite time###limit in the resolution of Swaraj.</p>
<p>For the sake of unity, Mr. Tilak allowed his scheme
of a small and compact Congress Executive to be shel###ved. The All-India Congress Committee, the tim.e###honoured Executive of the Congress was found to be
quite unwieldy and the new body proposed by Mr.
Tilak was merely a supplem.entary body and never
aimed at usurping the functions of the old one. Doubt###less, Mr. Tilak took his cue from the War-Cabinet of
three or four members which Mr. Lloyd George institu###ted in order to save the inevitable delays of the Cabinet
When we remember that even Mr. Lloyd Goerge in
times of extreme emergency and national peril could
bring about this change only by creating a split in the
Cabinet and driving out of office his old chief, we are
not surprised that Mr. Tilak was unsuccessful. Pre###judices and prepossessions die hard. Mr. Tilak would
however brook no compromise on one point. He
wanted the Congress to call on the Home Rule Leagues
and other public Associations to carry on continuously
a vigorous propaganda. &quot; If the Congress &quot; he said
&quot; would not lead a national agitation, let the Home
Rule Leagues at least do the work.&quot; It was with evi###dent ill-grace that the veteran Moderates allowed the
Resolution to be passed. Even Mr. Jinnah and Pandit
Madan Mohan Malaviya voted against it. This reso###lution was only the thin end of the wedge and Mr. Tilak
trusted time to make the National Congress lead the
National movements.</p>
<p>The memorable 1917 dawned and found Mr. Tilak
busy with his Home Rule Propaganda. During the
whole of this eventful year, Mr. Tilak toured from one
end of the country to the other. He delivered lectures
at Calcutta, Delhi, Mathura, Nagpur, Akola, Godhra,
Surat, Jalgaon, DhuUa, Belgaum, Thana, Sholapur,
Satara and other places too numerous to be mentioned
in detail. It is estimated that he delivered over 100
lectures to audiences varying from 4 to 20 thousand.
He exhorted his countrjnnen to be up and doing ; he
wanted them to strike while the iron was hot. His
cherished plan of sending a Home Rule Deputation to
England was approved of everj^-where and people
gladly paid large sums of money to meet the expendi###ture.</p>
<p>During the earlier course of the war, the Bureaucracy
16</p>
<p>242 LOKAMANYA TILAK</p>
<p>had to hold the dog of repression in leash. But when
the Home Rule Leagues were started, the officials felt
that something must be done to arrest the tide of enthu###siasm. With this object in view, they tried to overawe
Mrs. Besant and Mr. Tilak. But the proceedings against
both failed to accomplish the purpose. Then came the
Lucknow Congress ; and the unique combination of zeal
and wisdom, of dash and caution, of idealism and
practical statesmanship which the session revealed con###vinced the Government officials that a New India
was really born. The Bureaucracy set itself a###thinking. Even as early as March 19 16, Lord
Hardinge had cautioned India not to hold any extra###vagant hopes and to remember that even in the now
Self-Governing Colonies, the step of progress had been
slow. Lord Chelmsford too had raised his voice against
what he called catastrophic changes. About March
19 17 &quot; the Government of India issued a Circular to
Local Governments outlining the policy to be pursued
by the latter in connection with the Indian demand
for reforms.<em>&rsquo; Circulars, prohibiting students from
attending political meetings, especially those convened
by the Home-Rulers or where Home Rule was likely to
be discussed were issued. In May 1917, the Governor
of Madras and the Lieutenant-Governor of Punjab made
&quot; pronouncements which betrayed by their similarity
of tenor and phraseology, a common source of inspira###tion. In these pronouncements, .these heads of two
provinces exaggerated the nature of Indian demands,
deprecated them in strong language, enjoined the
people to abstain from all agitation and threatened
them with repressive action if they did not do so,</em>'</p>
<p>•&rsquo; RESPONSIBLE GOVERNMENT *&rsquo; 243</p>
<p>Next to Maharashtra, Madras was the most active pro###vince in the cause of Home Rule; unfortunately its Satrap
-was extremely anxious to loom in the lime-light. He
therefore carried out his threat of repression by issuing
Internment orders against Mrs. Besant and two of her
colleagues. He had expected that the internment of
Mrs. Besant would cow down the people. He must have
been surprised to find his tyranny met with defiance.
The whole country with one voice condemned his action.
It was feared that this was only the first of a series of
repressive measures contemplated by the Government.
There was a widespread alarm that the internment of
Besant was meant as a blow to her Home Rule League
and that the Government would crush the Home###Rule Leaguers first and the Congressmen afterwards.
Viewing the situation from this standpoint, even
the Moderate leaders thought it their duty to join
the Home Rule Leagues. (The Hon&rsquo;ble) Mr.M. A.
Jinnah and several other leading Congressmen and
Muslim-leaguers in Bombay joined the Home Rule
League immediately after the publication of the
internment order.More important still was the attitude
of the Moderate leaders at Allahabad, who at this
most momentous crisis joined hands with the Home
Rulers and championed their cause. When we
remember how, so far as the Punjab at least
was concerned, the deportation (1907) of Lala Lajpat
Rai had ademorahzing effect on the people, we
can appreciate the awakening that had now come over
the people, in that they refused to take this gratui
tous act of repression with anything like fear or
submission.</p>
<p>244 LOKAMANYA TILAK</p>
<p>At the meeting (July 28th and 29th) of the All- India
Congress Committee, Mr. Tilak&rsquo;s voice reigned supreme.
He expressed his gratification at the united and strong
protest made by the people against the internment of
Mrs. Besant. He heartily thanked those of the Moder###ates who, at the call of duty, stood by Mrs. Besant and
the infant Home Rule Leagues. But he was not content
merely with the protest, howsoever strong and united it
might be. He called for action. What are we to do ?
Our first duty was, he said, to efiect the earliest possible
release of Mrs. Besant and her two associates. If the
Bureaucracy took the hint and did the needful, — well
and good. If however the fetish of prestige held the
powers that be from recognizing their mistake, we must
compel them to come to terms. Passive Resistance (or
Civil Disobedience) was he said the only weapon which
would rouse the slumbering conscience of the authori###ties. The Bureaucracy was on the war-path.It would not
even allow us peacefully to protest against the intern###ment orders. If a meeting convened by a leader Hke
Dr. Rash Behari Ghose was prohibited, what guarantee
was there, that liberty of expression and action would
be allowed to us? Mr. Tilak, therefore, called upon the
All-India Congress Committee to give a definite lead to
the people.</p>
<p>The Moderates were in a sore fix. There was not a
single bright speck in the political firmament on which
they could rely. On occasions when the spirit of en###thusiasm is abroad, * wisdom &rsquo; is at a discount. * Fore###sight and reasoned judgment &rsquo; are synonyms for timi###dity. The Nation thinks not with the bram but with
aa overheated heart. Who can say whether in the</p>
<p>?&rsquo; RESPONSIBLE GOVERNMENT &quot; 245</p>
<p>long run such discarding of all caution and moderation
leads to success or not ? It is only in the throes of
tumult that Nations are born. It is exactly at this time
that the moderate leaders, terrified at the narrow line
which separates them and the people from utter destruc###tion cry halt. Their gray hair, their long and faithful
services to the country fail to evoke anytking like rever###ential obedience. But what can the people do ? Is
not the maxim &quot; nothing venture, nothing have &quot; tme
in pohtics also ? Does it not perhaps become the only
honourable and probably successful course on such occa###sions ? Unfortunately these are questions for the
iuture historian and not for the soldiers in fight.</p>
<p>In the manly representation made mainly under the
inspiration of Mr. Tilak by the All-India Congress Com###mittee to the Viceroy and the Secretary of State, the re###presesive and reactionary policy of the Government
of the day was condemned and the urgent necessity of
■the immediate grant of a substantial instalment of
Swaraj was established. It was plainly stated that
unless a Roysd Proclamation regarding the early fulfil###ment of all our aspirations was issued and Mrs. Besant
and the Ali brothers were forthwith set free the prevailing
discontent would not be allayed. The Congress Com###mittee also testified to the unexceptionable and satis###factory work done by the Home Rule Leagues. It wiM
thus be seen that the representation of the Committee
was a statesmanlike document which profoundly in###fluenced the course of future events.</p>
<p>Though Mr. Tilak was anxious to get the All-India
Congress Committee pass a resolution recommending
the adoption of Passive Resistance, still he was more</p>
<p>246 LOKAMANYA TILAK</p>
<p>anxious to carry with him as many Moderates as he pos###sibly could. Instead, therefore, of insisting upon an
immediate passing of a resolution to the effect, he wil###lingly supported the idea that all the Provincial Com###mittees should in the first instance be called upon to
submit their views on the subject. He knew that time
was with him and that sooner or later Passive Resistance
was bound to be adopted. He could afford to wait,
being convinced of the ultimate result.</p>
<p>Mr. Tilak disagreed with all those who sought to bring
about the release of Mrs. Bealsant merely by prayers
and petitions. &quot; If we want to prove how keenly we
feel for her,&quot; &quot; let us elect her President of the coming
Congress.&quot; Released or unreleased, Mrs. Besant must
be President. This was both sentiment and statesman###ship. In accordance with this suggestion, the various Pro###vincial Congress Committees nominated Mrs. Besant for
the Presidentship of the Calcutta Congress. This atti###tude was in direct opposition to the conduct and policy
of the Moderates. Their policy was not to provoke the
displeasure or anger of the Bureaucracy by calling upon
persons disliked by Government to preside over the de###liberations of the Congress. With that object in view,
was Mr. Tilak &rsquo;s name repeatedly set aside, and when at
Calcutta, his election seemed fairly certain, the Grand
Old Man of India was invited (1906) for the honour.
With that object in view, was Lala Lajpat Raikept from
the Presidential chair, when the Nation with one voice
demanded his election at Surat (1907). The Hon&rsquo;ble
Mr. Gokhale while opposing the election of the Lala had
said &quot; we cannot flout the Government. The Govern###ment will throttle our movement in no time. &ldquo;..What</p>
<p>&quot; RESPONSIBLE GOVERNMENT 247</p>
<p>would have been Mr. Gokhale&rsquo;s surprise, had he been
living in 19 17, to learn that the overwhelming majority
of the Nation had determined to flout the Government
by electing Mr. Besant and Mr. Mahomed Ali for the
Presidentship of the National Congress and Muslim
League respectively even when they were in intern###ment ?</p>
<p>With the Moderates&rsquo; opposition to the adoption of Pas###sive Resistance and to&rsquo; the election of Mrs. Besant for the
Presidentship of the Congress, it was clear that a crisis
was approaching and that the unity, which the Nation
had shown in formulating the Congress-League scheme
and in conducting vigorously the Home Rule agitation,
was terribly strained. The loose organisation of the
Congress threatened to be wrecked on the rocks of
serious party differences. But the timely appointment
of Mr, Montagu as Secretary of State for India consider###ably improved the situation. The historic declaration
of August 20 th soon followed. Another announcement
still — Mr. Montagu was to come over to India to study
the question of Constitutional Reforms ! The situ###ation at once changed. The cry of Passive Resistance
was dropped ; and every set of politicians began to for###mulate the pohtical reforms to be sought at the hands
of the new Secretary of State.</p>
<p>If there was any politician in India whose pro###gramme of work was not materially altered by the an###nouncement of Mr. Montagu&rsquo;s visit, it was Mr. Tilak ;
with his unerring judgment, he clearly saw that what###ever concessions Mr. Montague would be inclined to
make would, to a considerable extent, be negatived by
the reactionary forces at work in India and England ;</p>
<p>248 LOKAMANYA TILAK</p>
<p>and that the only way of not only strengthening the
hands of the Secretary of State for India bur also of sti###mulating his generosity and sense of justice was an
effective appeal to the British Democracy. There were
those who argued that this was hardly the time to thrust
our grievances upon the attention of our distracted and
well-nigh disappointed rulers. Mr. Tilak begged to
differ from them. Though not prepared to hold that&rdquo;
&quot; England&rsquo;s difficulty is our opportunity &quot; he saw
nothing wrong in drawing Britain&rsquo;s urgent attention to
the easiest way of enlisting India&rsquo;s vast man-power in
their cause. Side by side, therefore, with the work of
organizing our resources and formulating the demands
to be placed before the Viceroy and the Secretary of
State, he continued unabated the still more important
task of awakening the people to a full consciousness of
the supreme importance of his plan of campaign.</p>
<p>Mr. Tilak&rsquo;s triumphant Home Rule tour was twice in###terrupted to suit the work of the moment. On November
26th, the joint deputation of the Madras and Poona
Home Rule Leagues waited on Lord Chelmsford and the
Secretary of State and on the following day Mr. Tilak
had a long interview with Mr. Montague. He was ex###tremely well-received and is said to have created a deep
impression on the mind of the Secretary of State. May
we add that the efforts of the latter to secure Mr. Tilak&rsquo;s
full support to the impending reforms were all unavail###ing?</p>
<p>f;!*, The Calcutta session of the National Congress under
the Presidentship of Mrs. Besant called forth all the
statesmanship of Mr. Tilak. The Declaration of August
20th, 1917, had in a sense, created a great muddle in the</p>
<p>•* RESPONSIBLE GOVERNMENT &quot; 249</p>
<p>political situation. The Congress-League scheme was
drawn up on the basis of an irremovable executive.
In all our agitation we had supported the Congress###League scheme. To change, even in one essential, the
scheme which was formulated with great care and
caution would have opened a flood-gate of amendments
and the unity of the Congress would have been weaken###ed by dissensions. Mr. Tilak, therefore, suggested that
until the Government scheme of Reforms was out, we
should stick to the one which had evoked the unani###mous support of the people. There was time enough to
decide, after the Government published its report on
constitutional reforms, whether in the light of the official
proposals, the Congress-League scheme should be
modified or not.</p>
<p>A welcome step in advance was the insertion of a
time-limit in the Resolution of Swaraj.</p>
<p>While Mr. Tilak was straining every nerve to collect
funds for the Home Rule League Deputation, the model
Moderates were gradually being won over and were im###pressed with the necessity of supporting any scheme
of reforms that would be placed before the Parliament.
When we remember, how eager our Moderate friends are
for co-operation with the Government, which sometimes
means quiet submission to the bureaucratic will; when
we remember how the unmeaning reforms of 1909 were
praised as &quot; generous and just/&rsquo; need we wonder that
the Moderates rallied round the banner of the Viceroy
and the Secretary of State ? Those who know some###thing of the inner history of Indian Pohtics during the
few months preceding the pubhcation of the Mont-ford
Report are well aware of the specific purpose for which</p>
<p>250 LOKAMANYA TILAK</p>
<p>the Liberal League was started at Calcutta under the
presidency of the Hon&rsquo;ble Mr. Surendranath Banerjea,
The circulars sent by the Secretaries of the League all
over Bengal, calling upon people to be fully prepared to
study the forthcoming report &quot; impartially and without
any prejudice &quot; and to accept the scheme even when it
fell short of our expectations, prove beyond all doubt
that many of the Moderates had determined to secede
from the Congress even before the publication of the
Report. In their beggarly impatience to get something
without any risk, they decided to abandon the Congress,
for they fully anticipated what the reception of the
Report would be. Instead of calling upon the Nation
to stand up, firm and strong, these Moderates began to
send round mysterious whispers; and for the sake of a
few crumbs of Self-Government they were willing to dis###card that unity which in spite of occasional tension, had
prevailed since 1915, in the politics of the country. It
was in this atmosphere of secrecy and conspiracy on
the one hand and suspicion and distrust on the other
that the Report, long awaited was published (July
1918).</p>
<p>The distrust with which the generality of the people
looked to the publication of the Report was due to a
number of significant events of which the nth hour
cancellation of the passports of Mr. Tilak and his col###leagues was not the least important. It was daily becom###ing clearer and clearer that a reactionary element was at
work, both here and in England and that it was useless to
expect a satisfactory settlement of our grievances so long
as these reactionaries were allowed to run amuck.
People had expected that Mr. Montague would attend</p>
<p>&quot; RESPONSIBLE GOVERNMENT &quot; 251</p>
<p>the War Conference at Delhi and make some inspiring&rsquo;
pronouncement. He did nothing of the kind. To the
War Conference held under the Presidency of the
Viceroy neither Mrs. Besant nor Mr. Tilakwas invited.
The Self-Government resolution proposed by the Hon&rsquo;ble
Mr. Khaparde was ruled out of order. The Conference
was all an ofBcial show and hence proved a complete
failure. Nor was the mistake rectified at Bombay
where Lord Willingdon inflicted on his audience a severe
sermon on Home Rulers, whose bona fides he called into
question. Mr. Tilak was called upon to speak but was
not allowed to make a mention of Home Rule and had
to stop. More significant than all these were the rumoured
recommendations of the Rowlatt Committee which
were intended as a set off against the proposals contain###ed in the Montford-Report. The notorious Rowlatt
report, so disastrous to the cause of Indian Liberty, was
equally damaging to Mr. Tilak, the course of whose
action against Sir Valentine Chirol it was likely to in###fluence profoundly.</p>
<p>The Montford-Report was condemned by the majority
of educated Indians. Mr. Tilak characterized it as a
*&rsquo; sunless dawn.&quot; Mrs. Besant held that the poUtical
reforms indicated in the Report were unworthy of
England to give and of India to take. The Hon&rsquo;ble
Mr. Patel showed how in certain details the report had
made retrograde proposals. Mr. N. C. Kelkar prono###unced the proposals as cruelly disappointing and
** almost a wicked attempt to let Indian leaders be
stewed in their own juice.&quot; The Hon&rsquo;ble Mr. B. Cha###krabarty said that throughout the report, the fetish
of peace, order and good Government was worshipped.</p>
<p>-252 LOKAMANYA TILAK</p>
<p>Prof. Jitendralal Banerjea declared that the reforms
were grudging, half-hearted, meagre, inadequate and
hence disappointing and abortive ; while the veteran
Dr. Subrahmanyam Ayer advised his countrymen not
4:0 touch the narcotic that was offered to them.</p>
<p>To place &quot; the essentials of the Congress-League
scheme within the frame -work of the Montague-Chelms###ford Report &quot; so that neither the fire-eaters of the Ex###-tremist Party nor the cautious members of the Mode###a:ate Party might find reasonable cause for grumbling
was an extremely difficult and dehcate work. Much
of the credit of having restrained the fury of the &quot; Ex###tremists &quot; can be claimed by Mr. Tilak and Mrs. Besant.
&quot; If your cavalry charges a-head brilliantly, galloping
on the foe, without the preparation of the artillery, with###out the support of the infantry, what will happen ?
The enemy will meet them in their charge, will find
-them unsupported, will mow them down separated
from the main body of the host, and then, having anni###hilated the cavalry, he would advance across the grounds
left empty to annihilate the infantry in its turn.&quot; Mr.
Tilak was in complete accord with these sentiments of
Mrs. Besant and co-operated with her in trying to pre###vent the Moderates from seceding.</p>
<p>Knowing that he would be required to do the work of
a Peace-maker, Mr. Tilak, with rare self-effacement re###fused to accept the Presidentship of the Special Session
of the Congress. Even when the Moderates definitely
parted company and, in the language of Sir Dinshaw
Petit &quot; collected round them some people who never
took part in politics except grind their own axes &quot; and
sought to have a separate Conference of their own, Mr.</p>
<p>&quot; RESPONSIBLE GOVERNMENT &quot; 2SS</p>
<p>Tilak was desirous of keeping the door open for their re###turn to the Congress Camp. On the fourth day of the
Congress (September ist 19 18), the Resolution on the
Reform Scheme was moved by (the Hon&rsquo;ble) Pandit
Madan Mohan Malaviya in a closely-reasoned speech
which will go down to future generations as a historic
and statesmanlike pronouncement. (The Hon&rsquo;ble) Sir
Dinshaw M, Petit, the distinguished Parsi millionaire
seconded the Resolution in a lucid speech which descri###bed how &ldquo;the Resolution dispels the fear of some of
our friends and shatters the hope of our enemies that
the Congress was going to reject the seheme without
discussing its merits or demerits.&rdquo; Eleven leading
Congressmen supported the Resolution. Pandit Motilal
Nehru showed how the Congress was &quot; able to perform
the impossible feat of uniting its appreciation, recogni###tion, and in plain English, its condemnation &quot; of the
Montague-Chelmsford Report. Mr. Fazlul Haq proved
how &quot; though we hear of the change of the angle of
vision, it is either an obtuse angle or an acute angle
but never the right angle.&quot; Mr. Jayakar showed how
the &quot; taint of the school-master &ldquo;was responsible for the
&ldquo;periodic examinations &ldquo;set for the Indian people. Mrs.
Besant wound up the discussion in an impassioned
speech. Speaking to the Resolution, Mr, Tilak said : —</p>
<p>&quot; What we have tried to do in the Subjects&rsquo; Com###mitee is to distil our different opinions, and it was very
difficult to distil &quot; the gourds and the cucumbers &quot;
together. It was no easy task ; even our enemies had
considered it to be difficult. They believed that we
were engaged in an impossible business and that by
the beginning of September the Congress would be no-</p>
<p>:254 LOKAMANYA TILAK</p>
<p>where. Unfortunately for them, their predictions have
not proved true. So long as the spirit of forbearance
and the spirit of give-and-take pervades in the Councils
of the Congress such a fatal contingency is never likely
to arise.</p>
<p>&quot; We were told that the Congress was going to reject
ihe whole scheme. I could never understand and have ne###ver understood what it meant. We are in the midst of our
negotiations. If you reject the scheme you have done
with it. What are you then going to tell the British
people ? &quot; That we reject the scheme ?&rdquo; I think
that we have learnt enough of politics to know that it is
absurd to take such a position. Fortunately for all, we
have been able to place before you a reasoned document,
a resolution, which combines the wisdom of one
party, I may say, the temperament of another party,
and if you like to call it, I do not like to call it myself —
the rashness of a third party.</p>
<p>&quot; The Montague Report is a beautiful, very skilful and
statesmanlike document. We asked for eight annas of
Self-government; that report gives us one anna of Res###ponsible Government and says that it is better than the
eight annas of Self-Govemment. The whole Uterary
skill of the Report lies in making us beheve that one
morsel of Responsible Government is more than suffi###cient to satisfy our hunger for Self-government. We
now plainly say to the Government, * we thank you for
the one anna of Responsible Government but in the
scheme we want to embody, not all that is embodied in
the Congress-League scheme, the rails might be
different but the carriages that carry passengers might
be transferred from one rail to another. This is what</p>
<p>*&rsquo; RESPONSIBLE GOVERNMENT &quot; 255</p>
<p>we have tried to do and we have tried to satisfy all
parties concerned and a very difficult task has been
accomplished. The future way is clear and I hope that
what we have done will be of material help in carrying
on this fight to the end.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The moderation and good sense of the special session
of the Congress disarmed all opposition and many of the
seceders returned to the old camp at Delhi (December
1918) where, however, in the absence of Mr. Tilak, a
variety of circumstances conspired to foment those
dissensions which have, ever since, made Indian PoUtics
such a hopeless tangle. Neither the rancour nor the
differences bom of the Delhi Congress has been allayed
or made up. On the contrary, the bitterness has been
further intensified by succeeding events, — the passing
of the Rowlatt Act in the teeth of Indian opposition^
the campaign of Civil Disobedience started by Mahatma
Gandhi, the irresponsible acts of Government&rsquo;s agents,
culminating in the shocking Punjab tragedy with all
its long and interminable sequal. All this while, Mr.
Tilak was a passive though deeply interested observer
in distant London.</p>
<p>While Mr. Tilak was on his way to England, he was
unanimously elected President of the Delhi Congress.
This was the considered reply which the Nation
gave to the prohibitionary order issued by Lord Willing###don. While the Bureaucracy lost no opportunity of
discrediting him, our hero was the recipient of the
highest honours at the disposal of his admiring country*
men.</p>
