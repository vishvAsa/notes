Asoka's is one of the most warped narration in world history.
1. He killed his father and his brothers to seize throne 
2. For support to his quest for throne, he converted to Buddhism and slaughtered the armies of Kalinga, which probably rejected his coup
3. Even after he became the king, his brutalities are well known. He murdered one of his wives, slaughtered the Ajivakas and Jains, unable to face his anger, a Minister of his fled to Tarim Basin. In fact, his son was that ashamed of his deeds, he rehabilitated everyone his father persecuted.
4. While Central Asia's conversions to Buddhism are attributed to him, the reality is, those conversions happened during the reign of Kanishka but narrative ended up praising Asoka
5. His pacifist model simply led the kingdom into a rot - a rot from which it never recovered for centuries. Pushyamitra Shunga tried to an extent but was only partly successful.
