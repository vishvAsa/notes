priyadarshin maurya (popularly ashoka) had his translators render dharma as eusebia in Greek. I think that is a decent mapping & suggests that two heathen nations had a reasonable intuitive sense for each other. 

They rendered dharma as qshyt in Aramaic. While of Semitic provenance, the sense of the word itself was probably colored by the Asha of the Iranians, who were big boosters of Aramaic.
