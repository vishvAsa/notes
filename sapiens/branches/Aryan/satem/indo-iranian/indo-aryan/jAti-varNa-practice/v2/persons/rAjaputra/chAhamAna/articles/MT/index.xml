During the attack on the Rajput stronghold of Jalor, a Mongol general Kehbru and his brothers from the Northern alliance of the Chagadai Ulus, who were arch-enemies of the Khaljis, had taken the side of the Hindus. In the fierce battle of Jalor, Kehbru and his brothers had slain Kaaloo Maliq the nephew of Sultan Alla-ud-din. After the fall of Jalor the Mongols fled to Ranthambhor and took shelter of Maharana Hammira Deva Chahamana. Enraged by this, and the recalcitrant nature of the great Rajput, Alla-ud-din decided to destroy him.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&#34;https://unrollthread.com/t/1595977047956164610/&#34;&gt;TW&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Mulla Abu al-Fazl, the courtier of tyrant Akbar, seems to give a more objective account of pR^ithivIrAja ChahamAna than his &amp;ldquo;coreligionists&amp;rdquo; or most vivAsa authors.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You believe the account of Prithviraj killing Ghuri?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To clarify, I don&amp;rsquo;t think any of the evidence supports that.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The history of pR^ithvirAja is shrouded in agenda-driven myth making. The Mohd. authors obviously wanted to illustrate the triumph of the army of Islam against the H &amp;amp; slant their narratives thus. The nirgrantha-s while acknowledging that chAhamAna rule was a golden age for them, are still ill-disposed toward the sanAtana-dharma that the kings followed. Hence, they tend to present the king in a negative light &amp;ndash; i.e., blame his defeat on being slothful or given to excessive love for this woman.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
