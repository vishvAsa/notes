## rAmeshvar singh
The daily routine of Rajarshi Maharaja Rameshwar Singh of Darbhanga was extraordinary. He used to wake up at 2 am and do a complete reading of Sri Durga Saptasati sitting on his bed. After that, he would complete his bath and complete Vaidika Sandhyāvandana along with sahasra Gāyatrī japa.

Thereafter, he would offer pindadāna with approximately 40 kilograms of rice. He then would complete the daily worship of Pārthiva Shivalinga and then proceed to the temple of Goddess Bhagavatī. Here, he would perform the Tantrika Sandhyāvandana and do the pātrasthāpana according to the Tantras. He would then proceed to worship Goddess Mahākālī through āvaraṇa pūjā, japa, pancānga patha and then offer puspanjali along with Kakārādi Sahasranama. He then performed the pūjā and tarpaṇa of Kumarī, Suvāsini and Vatuka, followed by sāmayika pūjā. He would partake the Mahāprasāda and be ready by 10.00 am.

After resting for an hour, he would perform his royal duties from 11.00 am to 3.30 pm. Then, he would take a bath, perform Vaidika Sandhyāvanadana, Gāyatrī japa and complete Pārthiva pūja during the Pradōṣa kāla. 

In the night, he performed sāngōpānga niśārcana of Devī Bhagavatī. During this niśārcana, 108 Brāhmaṇas collectively chanted the Durgā Saptasati and 51 Brāhmaṇas performed Rudrabhiṣēka. Even otherwise, there was continuous recitation of Saptasati and performance of Rudrabhiṣēka without any break during the day. The King, who had converted his entire life into a Mahānuṣṭhāna, was a well-read scholar. He was proficient in Sanskrit, Hindi, Bengali, English and French. In addition to Tantra, he was also well-versed in Sankhya, Yoga. Vyakarana and Vedanta.

## Kamsundari Devi

Kamsundari Devi, the Queen of Darbhanga Raj, passed away at the age of 94, marking the end of a life that quietly carried extraordinary weight. Born into royalty but guided by a deep sense of responsibility, she represented a generation where privilege came with duty. 

She was known for her grace, restraint, and unwavering belief that those who have more must give more. While she lived away from the spotlight in later years, her influence never faded from the cultural and historical memory of Bihar and the country. 

Her most defining moment came during the 1962 Indo-China War, when India stood vulnerable and unprepared. At a time when fear and uncertainty were everywhere, the Darbhanga Raj, under her leadership, donated 600 kilograms of gold to the Indian government. 

This wasn’t symbolic charity. It was a concrete act of national service when the country needed resources more than words. What this really means is that patriotism, for her, was not about speeches or ceremonies, but about stepping forward when it truly mattered. 

Beyond that historic act, she remained committed to education, social welfare, and the preservation of cultural heritage. She supported institutions, encouraged philanthropy, and set an example of humility rare in royal life. 

Those who knew of her speak less about her status and more about her character. Today, as we remember her, we remember not only a queen, but a woman whose sense of duty outlived her reign and whose legacy still speaks to what responsible leadership looks like.

## CV rAman support
Darbhnaga Raj not only provided the country with 600Kg of Gold during Indo China war, then the Maharaja of Darbhanga lent (1920s/30s) a large, 140-carat diamond to physicist Sir C.V. Raman and his student Bhagavantam for their groundbreaking studies on diamond's optical properties - leading to the discovery of the famous Raman line and X-ray topography. Most museums & collectors refused to let him handle their treasures.
