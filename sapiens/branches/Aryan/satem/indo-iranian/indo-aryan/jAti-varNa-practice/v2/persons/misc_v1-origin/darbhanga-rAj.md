## Kamsundari Devi

Kamsundari Devi, the Queen of Darbhanga Raj, passed away at the age of 94, marking the end of a life that quietly carried extraordinary weight. Born into royalty but guided by a deep sense of responsibility, she represented a generation where privilege came with duty. 

She was known for her grace, restraint, and unwavering belief that those who have more must give more. While she lived away from the spotlight in later years, her influence never faded from the cultural and historical memory of Bihar and the country. 

Her most defining moment came during the 1962 Indo-China War, when India stood vulnerable and unprepared. At a time when fear and uncertainty were everywhere, the Darbhanga Raj, under her leadership, donated 600 kilograms of gold to the Indian government. 

This wasn’t symbolic charity. It was a concrete act of national service when the country needed resources more than words. What this really means is that patriotism, for her, was not about speeches or ceremonies, but about stepping forward when it truly mattered. 

Beyond that historic act, she remained committed to education, social welfare, and the preservation of cultural heritage. She supported institutions, encouraged philanthropy, and set an example of humility rare in royal life. 

Those who knew of her speak less about her status and more about her character. Today, as we remember her, we remember not only a queen, but a woman whose sense of duty outlived her reign and whose legacy still speaks to what responsible leadership looks like.
