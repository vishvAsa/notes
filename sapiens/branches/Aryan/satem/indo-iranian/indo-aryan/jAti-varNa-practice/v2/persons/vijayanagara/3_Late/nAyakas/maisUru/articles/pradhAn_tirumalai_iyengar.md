The problem of writing a proper history and the forgotten chapter in the history of Mysore.

Dr. M.A.Jayashree.  
Sri M.A. Narasimhan.

We are a group of people who are trying to set down the norms for re-writing of the history of India with an Indian perspective. We felt, as we have a galaxy of scholars here, we can share our problems in formulating a structure for a proper presentation of History, by taking the example of the forgotten chapter in the history of Mysore. We hope you will not feel that it is out of the purview of this seminar, for after hearing the papers of yesterday we find the necessity of preserving these nuggets of information about the heritage of Mysore and to transfer them to the future generation. But how, is the question that is bothering us, hence this paper. 

## Misrepresentations
In our journey through the written history of our country, we found that from the Moghul historians downwards to the historians of the colonial and modern period, there seems to be a gradual polarization of presentation, which is glaringly biased. It some how slips into a mode where the conquerors are heaped with all the encomiums and the vanquished is made to shoulder all the opprobrium the historians can see and create. We felt that it was unfair to all the parties involved in the making of history. But it should be said that, to the credit of the historians, most of the time it has been due to his ignorance of the culture and customs of the place.  But there have also been a few historians, who seem to be deliberately misrepresenting the events with a motive not related to history. 

## Between the lines
That reminds us of an incident. When we were discussing about the vulnerability of the historians with a famous epigraphist, he said that in a meeting, he made a remark that history should adhere only to the written aspect of information, the great historian Romilla Thapar said that history is what you read in-between the lines of an inscription. Well that seems to be the crux of the problem. Many seem to have read and reading it in many wide varied ways! The result has been the history of the world in general and India in particular has become partial and single dimensional and insipid, failing to achieve its avowed goal of educating and inspiring the coming generations. 

This made us to go back still further into ancient history to find any clues or guidelines for writing a proper History. We came across two famous historians of our tradition namely Valimiki and Vaysa in whom we saw a way of presentation, which is interesting, arresting and also capable of making a tremendous impact on the future generations. We all know how successful they have been in their endeavor. There we found the structures for a multi-dimensional presentation of history. They do not fail to mention the fragilities or the weaknesses of their heroes nor they gloss over the admirable qualities of the villains. Their presentation has more of an emphasis on the events and how the chain of events unfolds themselves by the crucial decision taken by the characters at momentous times and so on. The emphasis seems to be always on the play and interplay of circumstances and individual initiative.

## Kalhana
But still the formula eluded us until we landed with Kalhana. Kalhana in his work Rajatarangini gives guidelines regarding the purpose of history and how it should be and what should be the qualities of a historian.  He says,

> “Dharmartha-kamamokshanam upadesa-samanvitam
puravrttam katharupam itihasah pracaksate”


We do find this structure that Kalhana has formulated seems to have been adhered to even before his time in the case of historical kavyas, like that of Kalidasa’s Raghuvamsa.

Coming to the present day, it is very obvious that the above definition of Kalhana is more observed in deviation than in conformity. 

## Lakshammanni's attempts
As an example we would like to take up the forgotten chapter of Mysore history during the period of Hyder Ali and Tippu sultan. That is about the heroic role played by the Dowager queen Rani Lakshammanni and her incessant battle for the restoration of the throne to the rightful heirs for nearly three decades. It is a pity her persistent effort and courage despite being confined behind the curtains of the royal palace and constantly threatened by the mercurial temper of Tippu sultan in bringing about the promise that she had made to her husband Immadi Krishnaraja Wodeyar does scant mention by the historians. We do not have even an authentic biography of this grand dame of Mysore. She lived most of her life in Mysore under house arrest. 

## Triumalai iyengar
 This brings us to the episode of the “Pradhans of Mysore” who are given a passing mention by the writers of history. The history of the Pradhans of Mysore is all the more endearing to us for we belong to the family of one of the Pradhans Sri Triumalaiengar who is referred to by the British as Triumala Row. 
 
Incidentally Sri M.A. Srinivasan who was the first minister of the democratic Mysore was one of the descendents of Naryana Row, the brother of Triumalaiengar. Without these two courageous brothers Rani Lakshammanni could not have achieved her cherished goal. Despite repeated disappointments, these two brothers were loyal to the throne of Mysore, risked their lives, and sacrificed their families for the sake of their queen Rani Lakshammanni. 

## Imprisonment by Haidar
The effort of Rani Lakshammnni starts from the time of the ascent of Hyder Ali. To be precise she started negotiating with the British in the 1760‘s with the help of Tirumala row and Narayana row. Maharani Lakshammanni had assured these two brothers of the Pradhanship of Mysore and 1/10th of the income of the state as their salary in perpetuity, if they were to succeed in their endeavor. On coming to know of this, Hyder Ali imprisoned all their relatives. It was their misfortune that their mission to the different powers in the British hierarchy failed repeatedly.  

## Masacre by Tipu
It was in the 1790’s Tippu sultan coming to know of the agreement between General Harris, the then Governor of Madras and Tirumaliengar, herded nearly seven hundred relatives, men as well as women and children of the Pradhan brothers living in the region between Srirangapatna and Mandya, and put them to a cruel death. +++(5)+++

> What I know if after I met Shri M A Narasimhan who is the seniormost descendant of the family and lives in the home adjacent to Parkala Math is that the members of the family were all officers and clerks at court and obviously being from the same family 'deemed' guilty of collusion and hung in srirangapattana. He was not sure of the numbers but had seen letters from Maharani Lakshmamamani to Tirumala ray and back in the book written by his father which mentioned about 600 numbers.

Is this a fact or fiction created by the enemies of Tippu sultan, one may ask? For, no mention of it is there in any history book. But we would like to mention that even today, that is even 200 years after this ghastly event, the families of Mandyam iyengars who belong to the Gotra of Bharadwaja, the lineage of the Pradhans do not celebrate the festival of Naraka Caturdasi, for it was the day on which Tippu sultan killed their ancestors. 

Every child of those families is told that story on that day. We all know how important for a Hindu the celebration of a festival is and here we find a small community discontinuing such a celebration. Perhaps that itself is a strong indication how true the event is and how strongly they felt about the cruel end that their ancestors fell in to for no fault of their own. 

## Purnaiah
This makes us to mention another element that is part of this drama. That is the part played by Diwan Purnaiah. He was in a position of power and had enormous influence on both Hyder and Tippu sultan. It looks, as though during the last days of Tippu Sultan, Purnaiah seems to have played the role of a double agent. It was he who was behind the imprisoning of the Srivaishnavas by Tippu sultan.+++(4)+++ 


This contention seems to be all the more probable when we see about his insistence that only the sons of Tippu should succeed to the throne and also his subsequent behavior with the King Mummadi Krishnaraja Wodeyar. 

Sri Anantharamu in his work on Mandya   “Sakkareya seeme” speaks of Lavanis (folk songs) which speaks of Purnaiah as a traitor and goes on to narrate vaguely some instances which seems to be sensible in the light of the above event. 

We also find during this juncture, the taluk headquarters was changed from Mandya to Yelandur, Purnaiah’s place and his income was increased. Was it a reward? 

Well, perhaps you might also be aware of the fact that five or six years ago the Tahasildar of Yelandur opened the dilapidated house of Purnaiah, which was left unopened for more than hundred years and discovered around ten trunks full of gold coins and valuable ornaments belonging to Divan Purnaiah.

Our elders had shown us a Manuscript, which was incomplete, which had recorded the whole episode of Rani Lakshammanni and the travails of the brave ‘Pradhan brothers’. At present it lies in the safe custody of one of our cousins. But we all know full well, none of these events find a place in the history books of today. 

## British alliance apologia
The reason is obvious by following the method of writing done by the British Historians of a one sided pro-British History, the historians of modern India jumping to the other extreme, seems to have felt that the Rani Lakshammanni and the Pradhan brothers were traitors to the nation as they sought the alliance of the British. This is understandable because the protagonists of the freedom movement in order to whip the passion of the people to join the freedom movement sowed the concept, that who ever fought the British was a hero and who ever sided with the British were traitors. Historians too fell for such a simplistic interpretation of history. Sri Ti. Ta. Sharma is one such example.

We feel that this is nothing but a case confusing the issues by equating patriotism with that of being the enemy of the British. After all, the queen and her Pradhans were fighting for their rights and even Kauitlya is on record that in polity, the enemy of the enemy is to be our friend and the action of Rani Lakshamanni was nothing more or less. Then there is the insistence of some physical proof of the events like an inscription or a record for authentication brushing aside folklore and tradition, which has been the backbone of Indian history. Perhaps more light can shed on this part of history of Mysore, if we can pursue the records that were taken away to London by the British after the fall of Tippu sultan.  

As you can see, if the narration of the simple episode of the effort of a queen to get back the kingdom to the rightful heirs can lead to many acrimonious debates among the historians, then what could be the scenario if one attempts to rewrite Indian History? That is why we would like to place before you a request in all sincerity to suggest norms by which we can rewrite the history of Mysore as well as India, perhaps as captivating as that of our epics. Do you think the norm of Kalhana is a possible solution? We await your suggestions. It is all the more important, as we are at a turning point in the history of India, for the Indian youths are eager to know more about their heritage and is it not our duty to deliver the goods?
