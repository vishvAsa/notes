## TRANSLATION
(Lines 1-3.) The cyclic year Plavamga, corresponding to the 929th year of the Saka era, being current-  
when Rājaraja Nitys-vinoda Rajēndra-vidyadhara, ornament of the Chola race, Nūrmaḍi-Choḷa, came accompanied by a host of nine-hundred thousand (men),  
halted at Donavura, and was ravaging the whole country, perpetrating murders of women, children, and Brāhmaṇs, seizing women, and overthrowing the order of caste,

(Lines 3-7.) Hail the auspicious king of kings, supreme Lord, supreme Master, Akalankacharita Irivabedanga, ornament of the Chalukya race, slayer of Tamils, the auspicious king Satyāśraya, drove away the Chola, captured his trains of baggage-waggons, and made a triumphal progress through the South;

(Lines 7-11.) And while in the course thereof, being at the ghaṭṭas of Tāvare, he was reigning over the circle of the ocean-sealed earth under the shadow of his single parasol, at what time... was exercising the office of county-gāvuṇḍa over the Pānungal Five-hundred, (and) ...  
follower of the courses of Mana, servant of Somèsvara, was exercising the office of gāvunḍa over Pottiyür,  
the beadle Gojjiga defended the kine of the betel-sellers when robbers were carrying them off ... and rose to honour in paradise.  
The Thousand of the betel-sellers in assembly granted 1 vīsa for each ox in perpetuity.

(Lines 11-12.) To him who preserves this there shall be the same reward as for an aśvamēdha sacrifice; he who violates it incurs the guilt of the five deadly sins. Māchōja of Indēśveragēri executed the order.
