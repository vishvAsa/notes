title: +Ethnic shifts

## Intro
Ethnic shifts provide important context for development of later social organizations.

## Initial peopling
- First came early hominids such as H.heidelbergensis from around 250,000-300,000 years BP.
- [Indian hunter gatherers](/notes/history/paganology/indian_hunter_gatherer) came next.
- Then the [iranian-farmer-invasion](/notes/history/paganology/iranian-farmer)
- Then, [Aryan migration/ invasion](/notes/history/paganology/Aryan/indo-iranian/indo-aryan/)
- Then, [Austro-Asiatic incursion](/notes/history/paganology/austro-asiatic/orissa-invasion)
- [dravidian-bloom](/notes/history/paganology/Aryan/satem/indo-iranian/indo-aryan/Arya-invasion)
- Great [Indo Aryan consolidations](/notes/history/paganology/Aryan/satem/indo-iranian/indo-aryan/Arya-consolidation)

## Islamic invasions
- Finally, during the Islamic invasions, we get some Turkik input.
- These seem to have left comparatively little genetic footprints even among muslims. Partly because they are genetically very similar to the earlier Aryan influx - albeit more admixed with Turkik markers. "Detectable ancestry - probably less than 10%, closer to 1%." - RK

## Foreigner absorption
> Originally foreigners seem to have been adopted into shudra varna. And in case of warriors, they were added to kshatriya (like Meitei, ahom etc). While magha priests from Iran were accepted into brahmana fold (an exception since v2 and v4 seem to be most common). 
> 
> Rajput men who took sullis as wives (under Rana kumbha for example) - their kids were treated as v4.
