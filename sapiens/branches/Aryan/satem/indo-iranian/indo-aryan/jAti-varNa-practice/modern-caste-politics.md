## Intro
- Dalit politics is considered separately.

## British and academic subversion
- "The British, at the pinnacle of their rule over the sub-continent succeeded in raising a wide section of Indic public opinion against brahmins. This resulted in several anti-brahmin movements that blamed the brahmins for the ills of various socio-ethnic sections of Indic society. They cited as proof for their grievance the dharma shAstras, chief amongst which was the mAnava dharma shAstra. These anti-brahminists claimed that these texts sanctioned the brahmins to ill-treat and oppress their people. These movements were orchestrated and their perceptions abetted by the British, and later by the collective Anglosphere, because they saw it as a potent tool to blunt the traditional Brahminical leadership of Hindu society against foreign invaders. This framework for the interpretation of the ancient Hindu texts was further built up by Anglospheric India-agents (“Indological scholars”) and their Marxist fellow travellers who had been planted in India just before freedom." \[[MT](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2004/09/01/inter-caste-strife/)\]
- This is concordant with the "divide and rule" policy.
