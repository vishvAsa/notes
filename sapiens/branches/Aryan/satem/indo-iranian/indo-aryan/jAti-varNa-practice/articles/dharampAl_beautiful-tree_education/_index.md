*...That does not finish the picture. We have the education of this* *future state. I say without fear of my figures being challenged* *successfully, that today India is more illiterate than it was fifty or* *a hundred years ago, and so is Burma, because the British* *administrators, when they came to India, instead of taking hold of* *things as they were, began to root them out. They scratched the* *soil and began to look at the root, and left the root like that, and* *the beautiful tree perished. The village schools were not good* *enough for the British administrator, so he came out with his* *programme. Every school must have so much paraphernalia,* *building, and so forth. Well, there were no such schools at all. *

*There are statistics left by a British administrator which show* *that, in places where they have carried out a survey, ancient* *schools have gone by the board, because there was no recognition* *for these schools, and the schools established after the European* *pattern were too expensive for the people, and therefore they* *could not possibly overtake the thing. I defy anybody to fulfill a* *programme of compulsory primary education of these masses* *inside of a century. This very poor country of mine is ill able to* *sustain such an expensive method of education. Our state would* *revive the old village schoolmaster and dot every village with a* *school both for boys and girls. * 

\(MAHATMA GANDHI AT CHATHAM HOUSE, LONDON, 

OCTOBER 20, 1931\) 

*...I have not left off the pursuit of the subject of education in the* *villages during the pre-British period. I am in correspondence with* *several educationists. Those who have replied do support my view* *but do not produce authority that would be accepted as proof. My* *prejudice or presentiment still makes me cling to the statement I* *made at Chatham House. I don’t want to write haltingly in* Harijan *. You don’t want me merely to say that the proof I had in* *mind has been challenged by you\! *
