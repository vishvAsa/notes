title = "nikhil on patrilinearity"

The Ā́rya designation is a marker of patriline rather than race; Ā́rya-s can have diverse genetic composition, as we indeed find today in India, so long as they are patrilineally descended from Ā́rya-s.

That being said, even in Vedic times (as of course among most old societies) it was viewed as far more virtuous to marry among your own kind (specifically, várṇa).  Thus we have Brāhmaṇá-s being excluded by their peers for having a Şūdrā́ mother (PB 14.6.6) or a Dāsī́ mother (ĀiB 2.19.1)—but, ultimately, still being considered Brāhmaṇá-s and accepted after proving their favor with the Gods.

Of course hypergamy was also practiced for women, so a Vāíşya wouldn't be able to marry a Brāhmaṇā́, or a Şūdrá any Ā́ryā. The Sū́tra-s more or less reflect Vedic morality in this regard, usually permitting a Brāhmaṇá to take a Şūdrā́ wife (PGS 1.4.11).  (Obviously not vice versa.)
