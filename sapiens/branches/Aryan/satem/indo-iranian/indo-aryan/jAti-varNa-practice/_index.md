Theory considered in [Agama pages](/AgamaH/AryaH/hinduism/social-cultivation/clan/theory/).


## Correspondence of theory with practice
- Frameworks always exist and make sense once defined - irrespective of how closely they were practiced. Whether or not one writes in the hindu decimal system, it exists.
- What matters to us (and the creators and interpreters of the many many dharmashAstra works) is - how useful is the framework in **organizing** or systematizing the society to make it function smoothly.

## Overlay of varNa-s on jAti-s
- varNa-s were overlaid on/ mapped to many many pre-existing jAti-s (which could vary). These jAti-s and sub-jAti-s had their own hierarchies and restrictions on marriage and inter-dining beyond what the varNa-system required.
- These myriad jAti-s were hypothesized to have arisen from the main varNa-s mixing together in various ways.
- brAhmaNa-s learned in the dharmashAstra-s adjudicated disputes regarding varNa-assignment.
- More details in [varNa subpage](varNa/).

## jAti pride
It is only due to jAti pride that in case of v1s -

- PhDs throw away money, and even marriage prospects to serve the Gods in obscure village temples; 
- spend decades learning and preserving recitation of negligible economic value etc.. 



## Sentimental life, rituals and Ananda pursuit
- This closely followed the theory described [here](../varna-theory/) (search term: Ananda).
- In some cases, brAhmaNa-s accepted non-brAhmaNa saints as honored gurus.
  - There are cases like a shrIvaiShNava brAhmaNa carrying a dalit on his shoulders so that he could visit the deva without violating temple rules, falling at their feet, insisting on eating food leftover after serving them ( [rAmAnuja](http://www.iskcontimes.com/archive/ramanuja-chides-his-wife) ).
  - madhusUdana-sarasvatI initiated many sannyAsins from other dvija-varNa-s with the intention of protecting brAhmaNa sannyAsins as suggested by bIrbal \[[IMG](http://i.imgur.com/WLSY6VL.jpg)\].
  - matsyendranAtha's 1k year old tradition initiates non-brAhmaNa sannyAsins as well.
