title = "komaTi vs niyogi"

Komatis are devout Hindus who donate to temples, so I guess thats why Vaidikis liked them. Vaidiki-s performed upa-nayana-s for them (as Arya-vaishya-s), but niyogi-s thought that they shouldn't. Komatis were also the trading class, and Niyogis owned land/sold their crops, so I'm sure they thought Komatis underhanded them, hence their dislike.
