      <description>&lt;p&gt;Madhavan&amp;rsquo;s upcoming biopic G.D.Naidu is about a remarkable genius, who was behind Coimbatore&amp;rsquo;s emergence as an industrial powerhouse. Inventor, Industrialist, Visionary, thread on the real life hero, whose story needs to be known more.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Coimbatore is often called the Manchester of India, due to it’s factories and industries. Tamil Nadu’s second largest city, also called as Kovai, is an Industrial, Technology, Textile hub of the state. And the reason is one man, Gopalswamy Duraiswamy Naidu, aka G.D.Naidu, the man who created the first motor in India. A school dropout, who was behind many inventions and also started many industries, playing a vital role in development of Tamil Nadu.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&#34;https://foundingfuel.com/article/the-contrarian/&#34;&gt;TW&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;After years in obscurity, Sridhar Vembu, an IIT-Madras and Princeton-trained engineer who started Zoho, a tech company, 26 years ago, regularly finds himself at the centre of attention.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The interest is partly because of Sridhar’s personality. When he returned to India from the Silicon Valley in 2019, he didn’t settle down in Chennai, the headquarters of Zoho, but in a village called Mathalamparai, 650 kilometres away in Tenkasi district in Tamil Nadu.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
