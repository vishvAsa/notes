## Archeology
- Copper hoards dating to 1750-1250 BC have been found in the Ganga-Yamuna Doab (pictured). They are filled with swords, harpoons, spears, axes, rings, & tools. They were not made from Indus Valley Civilization techniques, leading some to suspect that they are of Aryan origin.
- Many cities in the Ganga-Yamuna Doab that would become important in the historical era were founded in the Late Bronze Age (1750-1250 BC). Both rice & wheat were farmed. Cattle were herded. Possible animal sacrifice.

### Iron age
Independent development of ironworking in India. Starting in Malhar, Chhattisgarh in 20th century BC, it spread to Ganga Basin by 17th century, Karnataka by 13th century, and the entire subcontinent by the 9th century.

Several major cultures in India in early iron age. Red Burnished Ware in NW, Painted Grey War in Ganga River Basin, Black & Red Ware in the south. In late 2nd millennium BC Painted Grey Ware people neighbored the Black and Red Ware people to the west. Also Megalith Builders in the south too. Population grew in early iron age. 

### gangA basin clearance
Spread of ironworking is no longer believed by archaeologists to be reason for clearance and agricultural exploitation of Ganga River Basin. Spread of rice farming forced adoption of both intensive labor practices & greater social complexity.
