      <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the reasons Amin expelled Indians was because he was angry that Indians were the only minority that would flat out refuse to let any Ugandan man marry their daughters.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;There is the question of your refusal to integrate with Africans in the country&amp;rdquo;, Amin complained, &amp;ldquo;It is particularly painful that in the 70 years which have elapsed since the first Asians came to Uganda, the Asian community has continued to live in a world of its own to the extent that the Africans in this country have, for example, hardly been able to marry Asian girls. There are only six mixed couples in Uganda&amp;rdquo;. Eight months later, Amin gave the Indians 90 days to leave the country.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
