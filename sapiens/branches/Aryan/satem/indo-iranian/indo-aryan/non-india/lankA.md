Impact and influence of v1s considered [elsewhere](/notes/sapiens/branches/Aryan/satem/indo-iranian/indo-aryan/jAti-varNa-practice/v1/jAtiH/lankA/).

## Genocide 
Sinhalese were jealous of colonial era yapana (jaffna) Tamil success and dominance. So, they brought in the Sinhala Only Act 1956. By 1972, with the "policy of standardization", they restricted tamil entry to universities. There were riots and counter-riots; leading to tamil rebel groups; who were ultimately defeated at great cost.  

Major events were - 

- Burning of Jaffna library 1981
- Various anti-tamil progroms (rape, murder, looting, torture ... ) involving army, police, monks and general mobs

Anecdotally, every H seems to have a cousin or sibling who was killed or raped. This was one of the reasons tamils carried cyanide/exploded themselves to prevent capture.
