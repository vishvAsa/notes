## Genocide 
Sinhalese were jealous of colonial era Tamil success and dominance. So, they brought in the Sinhala Only Act 1956. By 1972, with the "policy of standardization", they restricted tamil entry to universities. There were riots and counter-riots; leading to tamil rebel groups.  

Major events were - 

- Burning of Jaffna library 1981
- Various anti-tamil progroms (rape, murder, looting, torture ... ) involving army, police, monks and general mobs


## Population impact
- 1947: Tamil Hindus made up around 11–12% of Sri Lanka’s population.
- 1983: By the time of the civil war’s outbreak, Tamil Hindus were about 10% of the population.
- 2025: Current estimates suggest Tamil Hindus now form around 8–9% of Sri Lanka’s population.
