Really interesting data from America. 60% Black and 21% White American mothers were unmarried when they delivered, i.e - they were having a kid out of wedlock. But only 1.7% of Indian mothers in the USA were unmarried, meaning they only had children within marriage.

Indian women in America also had the lowest rates for any ethnoracial group of maternal smoking before childbirth (0.1%). White & Native American women had the highest rates! 11% and 15% respectively.

Indian-American women were about 5'3" tall (161 cm) while White-American women were about 5'4.5" tall (165 cm). Samoan women were little over 5'6"(168 cm) and the tallest demographic.
