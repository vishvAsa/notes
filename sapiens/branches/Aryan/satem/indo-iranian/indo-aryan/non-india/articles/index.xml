      <description>&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/maitra_varuna/status/1709423410294509573&#34;&gt;TW&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Tang dynasty capital was home to 3 major clans of Indian astronomers:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;瞿曇 - Gautama , 拘摩羅 - Kumāra , 迦 葉 - Kāśyapa&#xA;some of whom were settled in China for multiple generations while maintaining their Indian identities  &amp;amp; translating key Indian astronomical works .&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The most famous such astronomer was Gautama Siddha (瞿昙悉达), a 3rd gen Sino-Indian. The Book of Tang records that Siddha was ordered to translate the Navagraha system (九執曆) into Chinese. His work - 开元占经 survives and includes explanations of Indian numerals &amp;amp; place-value. n 1977 a stele was found in Xi&amp;rsquo;an documenting the Gautama family&amp;rsquo;s presence in Tang China for at least 110 years, serving the Tang court for 4 generations. Siddha&amp;rsquo;s grandfather (瞿昙逸) was likely a Brahmin immigrant, while his father and brothers also served in the Tang Court. Gautama Siddha is also recorded as having worked on repairing an iron armillary sphere made by Chao Chong(晁崇) of the Northern Wei Dynasty (713). Perhaps the earliest Indians to work on such a machine.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&#34;https://threadreaderapp.com/convos/1645945300048318464&#34;&gt;TW&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve always wondered why the Hindu Majapahit Empire never appealed to the Vijayanagara Empire for help during its fatal conflicts with the Malacca Sultanate. The 2 Hindu empires could have easily countered the Ming-backed Sultanate. But I think I&amp;rsquo;ve figured-out why&amp;hellip;🧵&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Firstly, let&amp;rsquo;s clarify that Vijayanagara maintained both cultural and trade relations with the empires of South-East Asia. The trade relations are almost trivially obvious so I won&amp;rsquo;t bother with the details. But we see Hindu religious exchange even as late as the 1480s. A Javanese text from the late 1400s called the Śiwarātrikalpa (ꦯꦶꦮꦫꦴꦠꦿꦶꦏꦭ꧀ꦥ) introduces the practice of Mahā Śivarātri which was previously unknown in Indonesian Hinduism. Scholars suspect that this ritual was transmitted from Vijayanagara to a dying Majapahit.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

First Indians were numbered around 6000. This significantly increased to 38,000.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Overwhelming majority of these Indians were Tamils from French territory in India. They were brought to Grenade Chaloupe lazaret. They were quarantined here. These Indian were prosecuted and striped off their basic rights and forcefully made to convert to christianity. They were forced to assimilate to Frence identity.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Can diaspora please stand up?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As Washington’s stance on India shifts, Indian-americans find themselves caught between assimilation and allegiance. But silence has its costs&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Indian Express (Delhi Edition) 2 Oct 2025The writer chairs the Parliamentary Standing Committee on External Affairs by Shashi Tharoor&lt;br&gt;&#xA;C R Sasikumar&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;IN THE PANTHEON of immigrant success stories, few shine as brightly as those of the Indian-american community. With the highest median household income of any ethnic group in the United States, a constellation of CEOS helming Fortune 500 companies, six members of Congress, two former governors, and senior officials at the top of federal agencies, including the FBI and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the community is often held up as a model of integration, achievement, and influence.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Trinidad is a good example of the ceiling of Indian capacity to build a successful country. It became an industrialized nation off its natural gas/petroleum and agricultural exports. Indians are 35% of the population, followed by Africans.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;HDI is 0.800+&lt;br&gt;&#xA;PCI $30K (ppp)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;India wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have been so rich even if we had oil/gas. We&amp;rsquo;re too factionalized and too diverse to become a rich democratic country. Trinidad received indentured laborers mostly from Hindi belt, and sometimes even entire villages moved together. Mostly middle caste ones.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The air was heavy with dew and the promise of rain seemed imminent as mist whorled whitely across the surrounding forest canopy under a clouded sky. Undaunted, the volunteers of the Ganga Dhaaraa Teerath Committee seemed energized. In the shadowy confines of a makeshift bamboo shed, under corrugated galvanized roofing, preparations were already bustling for the day’s festivities. In the dark, peeled potatoes already lay in large silver basins of water ready for cooking as pots of coffee and tea steamed nearby. Though the sun had yet to make an appearance, the morning had already begun, for this was the day the annual Ganga Dhaaraa Teerath would be made. The faithful from all paths of life in Trinidad would already be wending their way through the dark and from far-flung parts of the country to meet and honour Mother Ganga at this spot as they have been doing for the last twenty-one years.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
