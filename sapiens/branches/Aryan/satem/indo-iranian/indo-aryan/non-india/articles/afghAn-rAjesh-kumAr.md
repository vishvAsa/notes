As the Afghanistan government of Ashraf Ghani capitulated to the Taliban on Sunday (August 15), one Hindu priest whose family has been in charge of the Rattan Nath temple has refused to be evacuated from Kabul.

Pandit Rajesh Kumar, the priest of Rattan Nath Temple in Kabul said, “Some Hindus have urged me to leave Kabul and offered to arrange for my travel and stay.”

“But my ancestors served this Mandir for hundreds of years. I will not abandon it. If Taliban kills me, I consider it my Seva”, he said.

Afghanistan was once home to lakhs of Hindus and Sikhs who lived in peace and harmony, but now the Taliban which has declared Afghanistan an emirate will impose Sharia law. It has said it will demand Jizya from any non-Muslim minority who stays in the country.
