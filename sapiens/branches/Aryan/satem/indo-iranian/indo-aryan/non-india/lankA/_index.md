Impact and influence of v1s considered [elsewhere](/notes/sapiens/branches/Aryan/satem/indo-iranian/indo-aryan/jAti-varNa-practice/v1/jAtiH/lankA/).

## Genocide 
Sinhalese were jealous of colonial era yapana (jaffna) Tamil success and dominance. So, they brought in the Sinhala Only Act 1956. By 1972, with the "policy of standardization", they restricted tamil entry to universities. There were riots and counter-riots; leading to tamil rebel groups; who were ultimately defeated at great cost.  

Major events were - 

- Burning of Jaffna library 1981
- Various anti-tamil progroms (rape, murder, looting, torture ... ) involving army, police, monks and general mobs

Anecdotally, every H seems to have a cousin or sibling who was killed or raped. This was one of the reasons tamils carried cyanide/exploded themselves to prevent capture.

### Rebellion
Indian help 

- India did train a bunch of groups after 1983 riots - but this was basic training and was sometimes focused on intel/recon on Trinco harbor. After IG death and Rajiv's sidelining of Parthasarathy for Bhandari, relationship frailed.
- The weapons given were standard and not for offensive purposes but was still welcome in the aftermath of 83. However, tigers diversified supply lines and got better weapons/comms equipment elsewhere. It was their foresight on not depending too much on the Indian state that saved them while other groups disintegrated
