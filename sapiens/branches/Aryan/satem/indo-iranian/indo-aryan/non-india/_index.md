## USA
### jAti
Data on Indian emigrés in the US shows a stark caste disparity: 90%+ are upper caste, compared to India where upper castes are ~26% (Pew Research, 2022). In India, OBCs are 43%, Dalits 22%, and Adivasis 9%. 

US migration patterns favor the privileged—education and economic barriers limit lower-caste mobility.
