- Roughly half of all Hindu Indian Americans identify with a caste group. Foreign-born respondents are significantly more likely than U.S.-born respondents to espouse a caste identity. The overwhelming majority of Hindus with a caste identity—more than eight in ten— self-identify as belonging to the category of General or upper caste.
- private surveys show that 25% of indian americans are brahmins. that's .25 of 3 million, so 750,000 brahmin americans. skewed to south indian brahmins and perhaps bengali brahmins. 4.31% of indian pop in 1931. conservative to assume 4% of hindus today, 33 million in india
