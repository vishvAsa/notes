Saw stuff about "caste discrimination is pervasive" among indian americans on my TL...to my knowledge, this is a total fabrication. i've said enough negative things about how some indians/browns behave in the west...i don't hold back, but i dislike lies a lot.

I condensed most of the important points in [my blog post](https://www.gnxp.com/WordPress/2023/02/23/america-is-turning-into-india-our-coming-caste-wars/), but to review...

Most ppl of brown origin are skewed to the 'elite', and indian hindus are mostly 'upper caste.' 25% are brahmin. 1% are dalit. if there is discrimination against lower castes, it is quantitatively not pervasive since there aren't many lower castes. 

The US, is not, india. most people are not indian in positions of action and decision-making. so most indian americans who work with mostly non-indian/non-hindu ppl don't have to deal with caste in anyway. they are more likely to be assumed to be muslim by their colleagues.

Minority of indian american hindus who r 1.5 & 2nd gen (raised or born in the US) are particularly clueless about caste and a lot of indian social norms and values. Mostly because they are american. Patrolling brown university indian americans for caste is dumb for this reason
